Draco inhaled deep, and, on the exhale, he smiled—albeit small and slight. 'Well, thank you, Harry.'
,’ interrupted Hermione. ‘We’d already agreed to, well, give him a chance.’ She looked at him pointedly.
, and has nothing to do with formality. With Harry's way, he found the students actually spoke their minds—and came to him with their problems.
He did as he said he would—kept the journal open beside his Charms essay as he scribbled away. He kept glancing over, but Draco’s writing didn’t appear on the page.
Potter laughed, darting glances from his plate and over to Draco and back. “But you like real human men too, yeah?”
Oh. Er—was this something he should tell Ron? That he was … corresponding with Draco Malfoy? (Was ‘corresponding’ the right word? Yeah, it probably was.) Ron might think it was a bit weird, but ... it wasn’t exactly a secret or anything. Yeah. He could tell him. “Just a letter from Draco Malfoy.”
They passed each other, and Harry found that he’d stopped moving. His body twisted around, to watch the stiffly-retreating man, as he walked further away, and disappeared around a corner.
He couldn’t even bring himself to smile back, as he watched her take Draco away into the circle that was quickly forming on the floor.
After setting his glasses down on the nightstand, Harry lifted the blanket and climbed in, resting his head on half the pillow. The one pillow. Draco looked down at him there and sighed, then he placed the book on the nightstand and clicked off the lamp. He scooted down under the blanket to lie flat on his back.
Harry clamped his mouth shut, staring at the daisy on the stall wall. He had nothing to say. If Draco would just leave it alone, then it wouldn’t need to be a big deal.
Evidently Pansy and Blaise had found their way back, as Pansy was swaying her way over to him, grinning. Blaise wasn’t with her.
The door opened quickly, letting out a blast of cinnamon-scented air, and a glaring amount of light onto his face.
So the wiry one must be the drinker, then. 'Ruben,' the bloke said, extending a hand, eyeing him closely. French, definitely French.
Harry turned back to his own plate, picking up his fork to shovel eggs and mash into his mouth. He was starving, and didn’t feel much like spying on Draco Malfoy—who was definitely
"Our fake marriage wasn't corruption!" Draco said, aghast, pausing in his vertical ascent. "That was, that was—strategy. No ethics were broken! No laws were flouted!"
Draco had the strangest desire to laugh and, at the same time, to reach out and soothe. Then came the surprising realisation that he
Well, at least he's had lots of practice walking into impossible situations. He takes a deep breath and chooses the seat directly behind Malfoy's annoying blond head.
He walked through the open door, wand raised, followed by a parade of objects, including a variety of nappies, clothes, and something that might be a swing. Lorraine, carrying a teetering pile of bottles, brought up the rear.
Harry realised that Malfoy hadn't been laughing along. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just—I thought you were up to something. I thought you were up to no good. I was suspicious and you were—you were like, vegan."
Harry yanked, trying to pull away, when the children's stifled laughter reached his ears. He turned towards them. "What did you do."
Harry laughs, delighted. "That is so, like…menacing. But like, in a good way. Like guerrilla love-fare."
She shakes her head, reaching a hand up to wipe one eye and walking determinedly towards her bedroom. "It's okay, Harry. I just need to be alone for a minute."
Harry tugged his shirt off and turned around impotently, no idea where he should put it. “Er, do you have a washing basket? Should we get a second, or…?”
He looked around. The entrance hall was less ostentatious than one might imagine, although Harry was dangerously close to invoking the word "vestibule."
"Yeah, I am," Nico said, brightening. "But I need like, a real job. Or at least, that's what my parents say. So it seemed like law school was a good idea."
Draco walked out of the room muttering incomprehensibly, then spoke up. "Well come on, then. Let's see what Lorraine's done on the fourth floor, and I'll give you the run-down of things about this house you should know now you're living here."
Harry laughed, but it came out like a single burst, an exhale. "Fuck, yes," he said, and Draco, wanting to drive him to distraction, slammed his hips down with purpose. "Ahh," Harry repeated, "yes, so much better that it lasts. And that you know what you're doing. Young people sex is for chumps—You're so fucking good at—" He broke off as Draco did it again, but this time Draco couldn't concentrate on Harry, focused as he was on the barrage of sensations—internal, external, Harry's mouth nipping at his ear.
"Honestly," Harry says, getting annoyed, "I wouldn't mind teaching you how to cook, but right this second I would really like to just finish this and get it in the oven, so can you give me like, a tiny bit of space?"
Harry's mouth split slowly into a wide, delighted grin. "What!? Draco! What the fuck! Why didn't you tell me right away!?"
The zoo was good people watching, Harry decided, as they walked. Muggles were as interesting a group as wizards, really. Especially the children. He saw one little girl who kept grabbing the hem of her dress and tucking it into the neck, leaving her belly and nappy exposed while her parents tried fruitlessly to get her to leave it.
And it hadn't been one moment, had it? There wasn't a moment when a switch toggled and Harry felt differently about Draco.
Draco caught his eye, and Harry could see all the ways that Draco understood. Draco's difficult, harmful family. The way his family put him in harm's way during the war. The way his parents constrained his options after. The way Lucius sometimes made Scorpius cry. The way Draco had to constantly atone for his parents' sins, getting nothing in return but lectures about tradition and a vague, aristocratic-distant regard.
“It very well may. Imaginative people always do seem to be sharers,” Malfoy said. “Good grief. We’re just going to have to embrace the chattiness, aren’t we? Unless you want to go our separate ways.”
noticed that you're hopeless at dating. Hapless, even. Hopeless and hapless." Draco raised his glass and tipped it back, finishing off the amber liquid. "Harry, I'm suggesting
"Infraction of 16 Ministry Code § 240," Draco said without emotion. "Ministry employees shall refrain from sexual conduct both in action and in speech, and—"
Harry shrugged. What did that even mean? “You mean because I’m not helping? Or like, existentially?”
Research reports prepared by his underlings littered the desk, and even though he'd outsourced that work, Harry was still pulling his hair out. He needed to draft a policy paper on racial and ethnic profiling in the DMLE, and it was the exact kind of work he hated—detailed, academic, research-heavy, and high-stakes. It was worse than writing an O.W.L.
"Okay," Albus said, running his hands through his hair and tucking it behind his ears. "Okay. This is good. This is good!" He seemed to be trying to convince himself.
Harry freezes, an icy chill falling over him like one of Mad-Eye's Disillusionments. He can't move. He can't breathe.
. And he knew he could eat Draco's food, but were there limits to that? What if that box of fancy biscuits was being saved for something?
They practice the arms until Hermione deems them passable and unpauses the video. "Alright, try to keep it together this time."
That's what Ron and Ginny could never understand—they have a place. They have a big, boisterous family and a stable home they can always count on. They have ramshackle heirlooms and an attic full of old stuff they can take when they move to their own places.
Harry’s laughter faded into a lazy smile. He loved his friends. They were alive. They were happy enough, weren’t they?
Harry had come to like Penelope in the weeks they’d been meeting. She was kind and fair, but firm and took no shit. He found that he didn’t want to show her that she’d overestimated his capability—he didn’t want to prove that he was even more fucked up than she already thought.
'Oh, well, I'm glad, then.' Harry picked up the self-care paper from their Mind Healer, and gave it another once-over. 'Is there something on the list you'd actually like to do?'
Harry looked down at the paper he’d been marking, and tried to continue reading it, but nothing was sinking in.
Harry tossed one last look at Malfoy, which he hoped conveyed some sort of polite apology. Malfoy just looked back, neutrally watching them rush off.
“I’d ask you inside,” Draco said, “But no one besides Slytherins have been in our common room, and, well... I wouldn’t want to be the one to break centuries of tradition.”
Harry eyed the kitchen table, not knowing exactly how he felt about it. The fantasy ... This was the spot Malfoy imagined himself bent over, with Harry thrusting into him. (As if fantasy-Harry would just fuck fantasy-Malfoy over the table, without first commenting on the amazing décor—but that was neither here nor there). Harry tried to quell a blush coming, along with the beginnings of arousal. Hagrid. Hagrid in a thong lounging on a beach. (No offence meant to Hagrid of course). That seemed to help some.
Harry blinked rapidly, coming back into himself. Ginny’s words registered late in his mind. “What?” He turned to her, found her smirking at him.
Thank you for reading, one more chapter to go! ❤️ And feedback is welcome (e.g. did they move too fast?)
They ended the call, and Draco turned to Harry, puffing out his cheeks. This was it, then, like Morgan said,
Harry groaned, turning over in bed, and throwing an arm over his eyes. He felt a bit worse-for-wear. Mildly hungover, perhaps. He could use at least two more hours of sleep probably.
Astoria pulled away, peering up at him. Instead of looking hurt or angry, she looked curious—concerned. “Are you nervous? Is there something you’d like me to do differently?”
Harry smiled. ‘Bossy.’ But he did as he was told. He shimmied out of his joggers and tossed them aside.
“No.” He sighed. “Wasn’t befitting a Malfoy, I suppose. Albino peacocks were more my father’s style. A pretentious and impractical choice, if you ask me.”
The walls were plastered with a red and navy-blue floral wallpaper, which Draco didn’t think matched the carpet at all. Potter stopped at a wooden door marked with a brass '221', and unlocked it with his key, pushing it open with a creak. Potter paused to hold it open for Draco, without looking back.
‘Um, well, you see, today we’re here for Fred—’ Harry tried to interject, determined to stay polite for as long as possible. These people meant well, he supposed.
Malfoy finished chewing, and swallowed. Then he dipped a chip in some tartar sauce, really taking his time with it. ‘There was something … But I wanted to get your thoughts on it first.’
They woke late and did a horrendous job of pretending they hadn’t been together all night when showing up at breakfast the next morning.  They’d even taken separate routes – but, as luck would have, they’d burst into the Great Hall, on opposite sides, at the exact same moment.
Harry bit down on his hand as Draco took him deeper, eyes flashing with annoyance at the sudden appearance of his lover’s ex.
Draco snapped out of his lust-induced stupor enough to reach out for his wand and mumble the countercurse.  Harry’s back arched as the sensations of the past hour intensified everything he was feeling now.  It was how the spell worked – and now, he was inevitably going to come-
Draco cursed himself all the way to his afternoon flying class, wallowing in self-pity about his inability to handle delicate situations
He turned back to the beam he was fixing before answering.  “I’m not,” he replied quietly, leaving enough space that he could pretend they’d both forgotten the question.
The man took a fortifying breath before freeing Draco’s cock through the flap.  He paused, taking it in, just as Draco was taking
The devoted Slytherins had come by again, and he’d updated them on his progress.  They, in turn, had told him of the other Houses and brought him a pumpkin pastie from Hufflepuff that was to
.  He didn’t think he’d been so obvious (not to anyone but Potter, at least), but if the students were catching on, he was well and truly fucked.  Nothing spread through Hogwarts faster than a secret.
For a second, the man was stunned into silence.  Then, his fury coalesced into a tidal wave of outrage.  “You
.  Out here in the main thoroughfare of Hogsmeade, an infinite variety of people could gawp as they passed by, not feeling constricted by basic politeness in this momentary, chance encounter.
FRED: That sounds lovely, George.  I wonder how our ragtag batch of former bakers are faring back at home?
Harry began to giggle, “You know that tabloid crap is written by wizards who don’t know the first two things about Muggle life?
But he didn’t get to hear what the boy was wondering, because it was drowned out by the squeals of several
Face crumpling ever more steadily into a frown, Draco rifled through his selection of ties until he found a somewhat crisp bowtie.  He decided that he’d just dress to look

He skated his fingers down Harry’s cock in one feather-light pull, gathering a drip of precum from the tip before smearing it down his bollocks.
And then he had, of course, gone through his daily ritual of Occluding and trying to forget about Potter’s face entirely.
Malfoy took up one hundred percent of his attention.  The victorious glimmer to his eyes, the teasing lilt to his lips, the sharp angles of the bones in his wrist as Harry took his outstretched hand…
again without permission – it’s just that the thought of being arrested for it, given his file, if it happened by accident sent a panicked fluttering up his spine.
anything – yet.  And it was that “yet” that had his heart pounding and fingers quivering as he reached out for the table to stabilize himself.
In the week following his realization, Draco tried his hardest to go back to work as usual – he slammed himself against the never-ending tide of potions to brew and unrealistic expectations to meet.  He suffered Morpheus’ snide comments about his accent and slept in two-hour shifts to stir the trickier potions at intervals.  His hands twinged and cramped as he worked, and his knuckles dried and cracked from scouring.  But still, he persevered.
was the time he’d stand up to his father and lay it all out there.  But every time, he found himself obeying out of sheer exhaustion.  He had used up all his courage in throwing open the door.
[HARRY has proven to be not great at de-escalation, so this is clearly the best he can do.  DRACO huffs and leaves it alone, eyeing the camera in turns with suspicion.  We cut to the moment they’re all pulling their doughs out of the freezer.]
“How about you leave before I grow irritated?”  His voice was tight, his jaw tense.  He didn’t let himself dwell on the sweet rush of adrenaline pulsing in his veins; he’d been spoiling for a fight for ages.  And he didn’t want to think about what that might mean.
Potter,’ if you will.”  He sounded smug about it too, like he could tell it bothered Draco that he had yet to reach the same title.
Once this picturesque scene has been established, it cuts to a work station that’s almost disturbing in its messiness.  At the station, an excitable young man peeks into his oven to peer at his pies.  Without warning, a loud
“Should I…?”  The recklessness of his actions began to weigh on him as the dreamy romanticism ceased.  What would the students say?  What would the
“Hmm.”  Her mouth quirked downwards in a little frown, and her eyes fell to her papers again, which sent Draco into a panic.
When everything was in place, he divided the class into six teams, then those teams into four.  There were four segments to the relay race, and each team divvied up the tasks between the people in their group; when that was done, they headed to each of the starting points.
jobs?” that he answered him honestly.  “They…weren’t pleased.  As I’m sure you can imagine.  Father had been sentenced to a year in Azkaban, followed by a lifetime’s house arrest, and my mother got off with similar magical restrictions as me.  It was a tenuous time for our family reputation – still is, really – and I couldn’t stand to stay in the midst of it.”
something – something other than sitting in the back of Morpheus’ shop, bowed over a potion and stirring until he
He helped her fit them all in her bag and then spelled it featherlight for her to carry.  “There you go,” he said.  Then, “It’s going to be okay.”
Draco chanced a glance at Grant’s face, and the expression he found there was hungry.  The man’s eyes lingered upon his waist, long after the spell was complete, and so Draco wasn’t even surprised when he reached out to grab it.  It felt inevitable.  He’d seen the glances, felt the heat of that gaze on the pitch, in the pub – he’d known the price when he’d agreed to be healed.
Potter seemed to have no such sense; it was that Gryffindor thing again.  He barreled right into the copse at full speed, sending a murder of angry crows tearing through the night sky.  Draco dodged them with a roll and dropped down next to where the branches still shifted and shuddered below.
Despite his current leave of his senses, Draco was no idiot.  He knew he was pushing the man too far – Morpheus’ face was mottled nearly purple with fury.  And the man had a wand, when he did not.
Draco took a deep breath, trying to get his emotions under control.  This wasn’t about him and his painful memories – this was about finding what set Harry off in the first place.  “So…” he ventured, “you feel guilty that Sam has to go through this when you don’t?”
“I prevented you from coming, yes,” Draco admitted.  “I certainly didn’t force you to keep yourself aroused for an hour and…” he checked his watch, “-fifteen minutes.  Nice stamina, Potter.”  He said it teasingly, but the thought of Harry here after he left, aroused and desperate, had his own body reacting quite uncontrollably.
But whatever Malfoy saw, he must’ve been amused rather than repelled, because his lips curved up into a hint of that trademark smirk that left Harry so, so weak.  “Yeah.  Now, turn around before Slughorn deducts points.”
know?” he asked, wanting desperately to believe her.  But he couldn’t afford to get his hopes up again – it was far too painful when they were dashed.
Mother wanted the past, but Draco had changed.  He had changed, and for the first time in his life, he found no comfort in the familiar – the etiquette, the influence, the traditions.  The war had destroyed the illusion of it all, and perhaps it had never existed concretely to begin with.  He needed something new.
It took a long minute for Potter to open up, but when he did, his face immediately shuttered.  “No.  I’m not doing this right now.”
Harry obliged and aimed his arse towards Draco. Draco aimed his wand at Harry’s butthole and said, “
[Harry carries over an enormous tray of rugelach, which the audience has not seen since they were potential disasters in the oven.  Now, they are laid out neatly, if a little eccentrically, in the shape of a Jewish star, with six rugelach forming each triangle.  It looks surprisingly impressive, given his disorganization not five minutes earlier.]
Draco glanced up sharply, blinking in confusion.  Harry’s blush arrested him, making him slide into a smile for real.  “Of course you don’t,” he murmured.
you’re a nosey git who needs to back off!”  He caught Harry’s surprise and rolled his eyes to diffuse the accusation, at least partly.  “Sorry, but it’s true,” he mumbled.
“I’m sure it was,” Harry assured him.  “My impressions are really good.”  He was clearly attempting to keep the topic light – impossible though it was.
He stopped in front of the ornate oaken woodwork, thrown by the unconventionality of having to knock on your very own front door.  Though, it certainly didn’t feel like his anymore.
Proving his point, they crowded closer to Harry and asked again directly.  “Hey Professor!  Are you on a date?”  In the background, he heard one of them protesting, “Merlin, Anna - you can’t just ask
But Potter started speaking again instead.  “Merlin, I was such an idiot to think that you’d have changed.  You’re still the same evil, selfish prat you were back in school! You-”
The little girl shook her head, sending her pigtails bouncing.  “No.  I just wanted to say that my dads were happy to read that we had some gay teachers at Hogwarts.  They said that it’s a ‘good influence’ and that it helps ‘smash the hetero-…hetero
Eyes locked, he pressed gently, and Draco’s mouth parted in silent wonder.  His throat bobbed, and –
That hesitant knock came again, and he figured that if it was McGonagall, she would’ve called out impatiently by now.  He walked over and opened the door.
“I can’t escape,” he said aloud – though he didn’t mean to.  Saying it made it real.  Saying it made him feel the stupid and useless urge to
Draco chuckled silently around Harry’s dick, eyes sparkling as he clenched and unclenched his throat.
but also far too adorable.  That he cared about hygiene at a time like this was endearing, though Draco’s revived libido would say otherwise.
“No, not that we saw,” Kat responded.  “They just wanted students to cycle through as they came by.”
It was enough to melt his heart, just a little – which Harry took full advantage of by talking Draco into sitting in his lap for about thirty seconds one afternoon until the flames of mortification engulfed him full-force, and he’d departed in a huff.  By the next day, an uncharacteristically tasteful armchair had sat beckoning to him in his favorite corner of the office, and he’d accepted Harry’s sheepish offer for him to stay as long as he’d like.
”?  Draco had developed a lot of restraint over the years, else he’d be shaking Harry by the shoulders and shouting in his face.  “Speak for yourself,” he articulated joylessly as he thought of just how much “time and effort” he’d spent getting Harry to notice him over the years.
challenge.  If he hadn’t been willing to see it through, then he shouldn’t have issued it in the first place.
, per say, but Harry still felt horribly guilty for the whole interaction and dead scared that Draco would misread the situation and leave.  “Draco, I didn’t… I mean, I didn’t
Potter was at his side in less than five seconds.  “Malfoy!  Malfoy – can you hear me?”  His voice was fraught with panic, and Draco didn’t even have time to be shaken by that before Potter was pleading, using his name.  “
Harry held his gaze until Draco couldn’t meet it any longer, and let his head fall back with a strangled-sounding laugh.  “Oh, Harry,” he said at last.  “That’s an unfair question.”
For a brief moment after their departure, Draco lapsed into a fantasy of Harry turning around and taking this opportunity to proclaim that –
.  Something was seriously wrong here, and Draco was willing to detonate a lifetime’s worth of precautionary knowhow in order to get things back on track.
“And-” Harry broke off his next sentence as he processed Draco’s response.  “Wait, what?  What’s that mean – you reckon you’ve put in a lot of time and effort that I’ve somehow missed?”
for the sake of it and then tease him into a tizzy.  It was lighthearted and fun, which he’d needed more than he’d realized, and – best of all – it had ended in a draw.
VOICE-OVER: Harry began working with the Weasleys after becoming friends with Ron back in secondary school.  Initially, he started working part-time at their family bakery in between his studies, but he eventually moved in with them as well in order to avoid a bad situation at home.  The Weasleys gladly took Harry in, and he’s been dedicating himself to learning his new family’s trade ever since.  He is currently a junior at Hogwarts Culinary, and he excels in bread and ‘unique’ fondant sculptures.
For a long time, Draco remained silent.  The fantasy of his peaceful Hogwarts Christmas with Harry coursed through his mind like a slow-acting poison, tightening his chest and making it harder and harder to breathe.  He wanted that – he wanted that more than anything.  But deep down, whether he wanted to admit it or not, he knew that he couldn’t.  That to do so would be utterly selfish; that his mother didn’t deserve to endure that alone, even if his presence didn’t amount to much.
“What?”  Draco knew what he was referring to, of course.  The redefinition of their relationship was the only thing currently on his mind.  However, since Harry seemed to like it when Draco played with him, he was disinclined to be straightforward.
“You did great out there, Harry!” she cheered, and somehow that managed to break the claustrophobic layer of tension pervading the pub.  The Slytherins began clapping as well, shouting, “You showed him, Draco!” and then people all over the pub were laughing and clapping, comforted in the idea that this was all just some absurd dare.
With effort, he dragged Harry to his feet and wrapped an arm around his shoulders to guide him.  As they passed the incapacitated boggart, Draco flicked a containment spell around it in case any students stumbled down here on their own.
Harry slumped onto the sofa, and Draco took a minute to appreciate that their positions had neatly been swapped since last week.
Seizing the theatric potential of the moment, Draco read a few key lines aloud, causing Harry to choke and splutter some more.  But the humor of it died when Harry stumbled upon the Malfoy article in unscripted retaliation, and he read the first line aloud before immediately trailing off at its unmitigated horribleness.
“Maybe you shouldn’t have gotten me going before the match, then,” Harry replied, smashing their lips together for a hard, sloppy kiss.
compared to this – none of the friendly teasing and passion.  None of the rapid staccato of his heartbeat, which stuttered every time Harry glanced up at him with those deep green eyes.  Even his previous orgasms had been understated and
.  Besides, with the time he’d spent in the shop, his interest in the subject had cooled more than just a little.
MINERVA: Let’s start with the savory.  [They each take a bite and chew for a not-insignificant amount of time.]  I like it.  I think the bleu cheese goes well with the ham, but there’s a little too much in there for me.
question is: why didn’t he get penalized?  If this show operated with any sense of fairness whatsoever, I’d have the opportunity to shatter 6 of his biscuits in front of
Draco hadn’t been able to sleep after their match, so he’d done what he did best – pour an absurd amount of time and energy into a prank to get back at Potter.  He’d gone up to Potter’s office, which wasn’t terribly far from his room, and tapped at the empty bulletin there.
Harry’s face closed off in an instant when he noticed the harmful words.  The song ended in time with his realization, and Draco’s easy grin slid, liquid, from his face.
The man finally looked at him, defiantly at first, then seemingly lost the longer it went on.  It was searching.  And Draco was searching his expression too.  He saw the lust first – he
Marla kept sneaking these shy little looks in her direction, and Draco felt his previous suspicions strengthening.  When prompted by her friend, the girl stepped forward and struck a victorious pose that would have looked convincing had she not been blushing terribly at the attentions and watching the faux-Gorgon out of the corner of her eye.
“Have you done this before?” Grant asked, drawing his cock from his trousers and stroking it a few times to full erectness.  His eyes were glazed, and he must’ve been distracted enough by the pleasure to miss the flicker of hesitation cross Draco’s unguarded face.
But then, Harry opened his mouth again, and Draco wanted to throttle him.  “Like, ‘The Chosen One’ different?”
But if he was to die, it was going to be against Harry’s mouth.  He ducked his head into the kiss, bringing their lips together, finally, in a culmination of that perpetual magnetism he’d felt pulling at him since age eleven.
“Well, that’s presumptuous,” he snapped, before he could stop himself.  Then, he looked up to see the smile sliding from her face, and he realized with trepidation that she very well might be the only one to show him any kindness here.  He couldn’t take that for granted.  Not anymore.
Sheepishly, he nodded; there was no point trying to deny it.  Where Malfoy was staring, the age-old button from the bottom of his old trunk flashed from “POTTER STINKS” to its new addition: “…at MATH!”
fashion (which mostly entailed adding bells to your robes, tilting your hat forty degrees to the right, and carrying dehydrated beans in your pocket on the eve of a full moon), but his internet diviner, Google, seemed confident that it was gay nonetheless.
Pansy Parkinson in that shower. Water running down her breasts, one leg propped up on the edge of the bathtub while he ate her out. Better.
Draco sunk into the chair behind his desk. It was riddled with papers and funny devices Harry didn’t recognise. There was even a bulky laptop. The walls were covered in more papers—notes and medical diagrams.
His face scrunched up in tears anyway. He allowed it. Allowed the tears to fall. He was okay, he was safe here.
. He hoped they’d all get it out of their systems fast, he’d rather like to be left alone. Ron and Hermione were doing their best as buffers, but they couldn’t be around all the time.
‘Yes,’ he replied, staring off at the wall behind Luna’s head, unseeing. He blinked. ‘No. I mean … do you know where he is now? Do you have his address so I can write to him?’
'Yes,' Draco hurried to answer. He didn't want Harry to think any of the possible answers to the end of his sentence. 'Just needed an education.' He licked his lips, realising he need to say more than just that. 'I do regret … my earlier opinions.’ He searched Harry’s eyes, and found him listening intently. ‘More than I can say, truthfully. I was wrong, and I freely admit that.' He dated a Muggle once, after all. But perhaps that wasn't enough to say either, it was a bit on par with saying
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry, pushing the trolley past a display of bananas. ‘Of course I have.’
Not really, not really brooding. He was … trying to move on. Trying to return to normal, to regain an equilibrium.
Draco smiled. “I’ll get the door. Tell you what, if you need to get dressed, I’ll shout the code word: marmalade.”
Seamus explained, 'If the bottle lands on you, you have to kiss the spinner for at least ten seconds!’
Harry picked up Ginny’s feet and slipped out from underneath them, making his way over to the window. The bird’s talons clutched onto the window box outside, just watching him in the dark, with seemingly patient, knowing eyes.
Fiddling with his hands, Harry looked around, but there wasn’t much to see besides side-tables with old and weathered magazines, and cheerful posters about practicing proper hand hygiene on the walls.
And the secret desire hadn’t been something smaller, a piece of something more tangible like: “to go on a date with Harry Potter” or “Harry Potter’s body”.
Draco Malfoy had been commanded to kill Dumbledore. By knowing this, by telling Dumbledore, it was supposed to have prevented it. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t fair.
A house elf appeared with a pop, carrying a huge tray of roast beef sandwiches and glasses of pumpkin juice. Harry’s stomach growled in anticipation. The elf left with a bow, and, just like that, it was just the two of them alone in the hospital wing again.
Malfoy pulled up the pajama sleeve on his left arm and thrust it in Harry’s direction, avoiding Harry’s eyes. The Dark Mark was there, black and twisty and horrible. Harry had been right. But he found no joy in that now. Now he just felt … was it sadness?
'Sorry,' Draco said, with a slight smile, following him with his eyes as Harry approached the island. Draco turned his body towards him when Harry set the bowl down. 'Why don't you like it, though? I'm only curious, because, well, most people desire fame, or fortune, or both, and it's generally seen as a sign of success. Something
Harry wanted to snap back, saying that there wasn’t really a ‘we’ here, they were Harry’s sodding letters, and couldn’t young girls just leave him alone? Why would
‘Afghanistan … Neville, I’m beginning to think these are not vacation places.’ Wasn’t there some kind of conflict there?
Potter’s eyes widened, and his mouth went into a little ‘o’ shape. “You wrote that?” His cheeks seemed to darken, too.
He smiled, as he spotted some black birds circling above one of the islands on the right. “No, I think I’ll stay here.”
“You still have things to offer to world, you’re a fucking genius with everything at school—if you just focus on one thing you’re interested in—who even knows what you can accomplish. And that’s
Draco shrugged. “Honestly, I have no idea. I’m going to assume, knowing Luna, that she’s picked up strays along the way. People who needed something to do with their Christmas.”
Draco exhaled, shaking his head. “I don’t know, Harry. Give it to the kitchens? Maybe the house elves can make a pie out of it.”
Some people spotted Harry and beelined towards him, wanting to tell him thank you, wanting to shake his hand, before wandering off. Harry politely obliged them, until he found himself surrounded by a small crowd of adults who just wouldn’t leave—trying to drill him for information. He should’ve hid
Harry shrugged, grinning. ‘There are so many children’s television programs with talking animals. I must’ve just thought I was like them.’
“Come on, we should go back,” Draco said, looping his arm in Harry’s and already steering him back from where they came. “Boyfriend.”
When he was done, with pruned fingertips and skin that felt raw from the abuse, Harry stepped out and toweled off. Walking back into the room, he sidestepped the pile of wet, bloody clothes and rummaged around in his trunk for a soft, clean cotton t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He changed quickly and climbed into bed, shutting the curtains around himself—shutting out the bloody clothes, shutting out the outside world. His breath came out in erratic bursts.
Potter moved his hips, bit at his lower lip, and lowered his eyelids. ‘Mary J. is in the spot tonight, and I’mma make you feel all right.’
His glasses fogged up immediately, so Harry took a moment to wipe them on his scarf. When he put them back on, the brightly coloured displays, under the department store fluorescent lighting, assaulted his senses. Er … why had he come inside?
“Yeah.” He looked out at the pitch. The sun was setting, and casting the grass in a warm, orange glow. “I guess I was hoping it was a living, breathing human, though.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, and leant his whole weight on him, as he grinned at the clear plastic wrapped item in Draco's hands. 'It's for when I'm chopping onions, Draco. You can put those on and your eyes will be fine! You won't have to run away to the other room!'
He went into the waiting room, and found Malfoy bent over a magazine—his face hidden from view. ‘Malfoy,’ he said quietly. Malfoy’s face sprung up—looking carefully guarded, but there was something very pinched about him—like he was a spring wound up too tight. ‘I’m done early. You can go in, if you want.’
Ron smiled a bit. “Yeah, of course, mate. Always.” He sat up straight, suddenly, like he’d just remembered something. “What about
A groan came from Potter’s bed. Draco froze, and turned his head slowly. Potter had a pillow over his face, and arms splayed over top.
He opened his bedroom window to let in a cool summer breeze, and looked down at the happy Violet on the windowsill. It had done well this year, it had grown, and it still had flowers. Neville had told him that was a good sign of health. He rubbed a thumb over one of its fuzzy leaves, perhaps for luck. Perhaps for courage.
She sagged in relief, before seemingly noticing him properly. She gave him a once-over with a puzzled expression. 'Oh, you look rather sweaty, don't you?' She looked around the living room, and noticed the furniture shoved all off to the side. 'What's happening here?'
‘I ... I see …' He clenched and unclenched his fists. 'Charlotte I'm really sorry that happened to you. It shouldn't have.'
Draco leaned back and squinted upwards, past the strings of fairy lights, past the tree branches, and up to the stars. ‘I did.’
Harry’s hand moved up his jaw, to graze over his cheek, fingertips travelling over the shell of his ear. And Harry’s soft mouth lifted off, and landed again, just beneath Draco’s lower lip.
“Malfoy,” Potter practically growled. His eyes flashed with warning, boring into Draco’s. He felt a skewed sense of accomplishment, at having gotten Potter’s full attention for once this year.
His body shook … perhaps from having stood so long in cold, wet clothes. Or perhaps from the swirling emotions within himself, that he was trying very hard to ignore.
He eyed Harry in his own swim trunks, considering. 'Want to borrow a pair of joggers? I, ah, well I over-packed for this trip, so I've got extra and they're clean. And I can't imagine wanting to sit in swim trunks all evening.' Oh Merlin, he was rambling, wasn't he?
He did. Draco spoke about Michelangelo’s sculptures and black cherry gelato in Italy, the Concertgebouworkest and tompouce in the Netherlands, the Matterhorn and raclette in Switzerland …
“Because Pansy knows I fancy you, and knew I’d never do anything about it—because you’re much too good for me, and I’d never be able to make up for everything I’ve—”
When Harry didn't say anything, Draco moved back into the line of sight from the doorway. Harry hadn't moved. Instead, he puffed his cheeks up with air, then expelled it.
Perhaps it was a nature versus nurture situation. In Potter’s case, his nature must’ve won out. All those good genes inherited from his parents.
'Well, thank you, seriously.' Dave looked at him pointedly, with a growing smile. 'He does seem better today, much better than we last saw him. I think your visit is helping.'
Draco nudged him off the bed, and scooted over with him, getting out from Harry’s side too. He found Harry's hand, and led him to the bathroom, turning on the bright light—which brought stars into Harry's eyes, causing him to blink a lot. Draco dropped Harry's hand, and stepped over to the shower stall. He fiddled with the nob, starting a noisy stream of water. Draco then tested the temperature with a hand, and, satisfied with the temperature, led Harry hand-in-hand into the shower stall with him, shutting the glass door behind them both. Draco nudged Harry underneath the water.
Draco leaned in to kiss him some more, wrapping him more tightly into his arms. Harry allowed it—just melted into it.
Well all right, his wife knew best, didn’t she? They settled down on the carpeted floor, leaning their backs against the foot of the bed.
So Astoria wasn’t opposed to sex outside of marriage ... She hadn’t outright said that she was actively interested, but hadn’t outright refused either. Just, in her words, “we both could”, and, "I'll let you know what I decide". Draco worried the side of his lower lip, and stared out the window, unseeing.
Draco frowned. He had a good life, a nice life. This was all rather un-called for, and felt a bit like a personal attack. ‘I have other friends … And … hobbies …'
Harry kissed at the edge of Draco's mouth. As far as he knew, Draco still hadn't opened his eyes yet. 'I want to ride you,' Harry murmured.
Draco left for the library after he finished eating. He read about alpacas, and then llamas too. Just for the fun of it.
Ron laid his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “I thought we were going to be brothers,” he said petulantly.
‘Sounds like fun.’ She laughed, a happy laugh. ‘Ah!’ Moira lifted a finger in the air. ‘I have just the thing for you.’
Dave grinned, clearly proud. 'Thanks, Draco. Well … the expansion is going well. Three more weeks until we can open up the new art room. The kids are really excited for that—we'll have a kiln, so I'm looking forward to figuring out how to make my own mugs and bowls and all that stuff.'
She got up and sauntered over to see what he was looking at. ‘It’s a rune. Gyfu, meaning gift or generosity.’
to know. It was difficult to ask, but he had to say the words. So, in barely more than a whisper, he asked: ‘Do you still love me?’
Draco started to point out constellations. Harry had taken Astronomy, too, but it was nice to hear Draco’s voice. And, granted, Draco remembered a lot more about Astronomy anyhow.
Harry bit at a smile, as he reached past his bed curtain and fumbled around his nightstand for a quill. His fingers brushed against feather—he found it.
‘I see,’ Harry answered softly. Everything was clicking in to place in his sleepy mind. Yes, this was all making sense, now. Draco was gay, and Harry was attracted to him. Fancied him, even. Harry fancied Draco. Of course he did.
‘Afraid so.’ He rubbed at a spot on his leg. ‘They are beautiful,’ Draco said softly, watching the bird as well. ‘The Monarch also owns every whale and dolphin within three miles of the coast.’
Draco frowned. And Pansy seemed very pleased with herself. Was Harry going to be like this as a boyfriend, then? All contrarian. Wait... did he just think ‘
Potter stretched out onto his stomach beside him and took a look. Draco could feel the heat radiating off Potter’s body.
Draco lent closer to Harry’s ear. “I tried the maroon one, it tasted like rummy eggnog and I haven’t died yet.”
Ack. He wasn’t a drinker, really. He didn’t feel sick, exactly, just kind of blah. Sticky, even. Had he spilled something on himself? Firewhisky? Marshmallows?
This time, Harry and Malfoy had landed in a long clearing surrounded by trees. And nearby were swarms of people with light spilling out of wands to guide their footing, walking in the same direction towards a patch of yellow lit-up sky, as they spoke to one another loudly in Spanish. Many of them wore brightly-coloured, tall hats, and some carried flags or banners.
Once dressed and ready to go downstairs, Harry tugged Draco into another quick kiss. When he pulled back, he ran his fingers through Draco’s messy hair to smooth it, and tuck the loose strands behind his ears. Then he planted one more peck on Draco’s lips, like a stamp of approval. Draco let it all happen with a soft smile on his lips.
He sat down hard onto the bed. He’d actually come to Ibiza. It felt strange, like it might not actually be real.
Oh Merlin, Harry was going to say it. He stared down at the dark liquid in his mug, as he admitted, ‘I’ve liked it.’
“Good things don’t always come quickly. You have to work at them,” Draco said, with a small smile as he kept turning his stick.
Inexplicably, he wondered what the old Draco would say to a message like that. He could see it—could picture Draco’s scowl as he spat, ‘You’re pathetic. Stop obsessing about me, Potter. I’m not interested in you, and it’s frankly hilarious you think I could ever be.’
“Well,” Minerva said, after she’d swallowed her last piece. “I’m going to have a talk with Septima, and you are going to have a talk with Draco.”
It was two men in black uniforms at the door, with a massive cardboard box on a trolly between them.
Odd how everything was so much harder to handle after it was already over. You’d think the saving-the-world bit would’ve been the hardest part—the most panic-inducing part—and that afterwards should be all smooth-sailing. But no, only once the dust settled had Harry discovered his anxiety problem. It was wholly inconvenient and unfair, if you ask him. He should’ve gotten to enjoy having a normal life for the first time, with no one actively trying to kill him anymore.
‘Right. Anyway, Potter, I think it’s time I got back.’ Malfoy said, hurriedly, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes.
Her smile faded, and her eyes got that glassy look she always got when she was on to something. “The Dark Lord,” she echoed.
Harry blinked at Draco for a moment, feeling his pulse quickening. ‘Okay,’ he said slowly. He felt about as apprehensive as Draco probably did. ‘You sent me all those things, yeah?’
Draco glanced up, to find Potter watching him with a small frown. He suppressed an eyeroll. “You can go, you know.”
To his surprise, there were new entries already. Harry thought he shouldn't really violate this other person’s privacy, and went to close it. But his eyes were drawn to the elegantly written words “Harry Potter”. It gave him pause. If someone was talking about him, he figured he should know what they're saying, right?
Draco could make out shadowy figures as they approached—some seated on horizontally-placed logs around the fire, others arranged in small groups nearby.
Harry’s stomach took that opportunity to rumble, reminding him they’d skipped lunch. ‘We should eat.’
Leaning in close to Draco's ear, Morgan whispered quite loudly, 'You know how to use computers, now, Draco.'
‘Yes! It’s not nice to make someone think you love them, then immediately take it back the next day.’
He picked up his fork and started stabbing the greens, maybe more violently than necessary. Perhaps pretending the leaves were Potter’s abusive family would make him feel better. When his fork was full of lettuce, he shoved it all in his mouth and chewed angrily.
‘Never mind that,’ Malfoy said, waving a hand dismissively. He walked the last few paces so that they were standing close, eye to eye. ‘I want you to know that I didn’t kill him.’
Instead, he looked around at the light-green wallpapered walls that pealed slightly in places, the ugly brown and yellow abstract painting hanging in between the two double beds—beds which looked decently comfortable with plush white comforters. There was even a telly-vision resting on a low mahogany dresser, positioned so that it could be viewed from lying in bed.
He couldn’t—and didn’t—argue that. Instead, he wrapped his arms around Astoria, and held her there. Long after Astoria’s breaths had evened out, Draco stayed wide-awake.
Harry looked from one friend to the other, and back. Feeling rather baffled by this sudden intervention. ‘Truthfully, I actually didn’t think you’d notice I left, it didn’t occur to me to tell you.’
He touched Draco's bollocks next, tracing their outline, feeling the paper-thin skin there. Returning to the cock, he held it gently, wrapping his fingers loosely around it, and leant in to kiss Draco on the mouth.
Potter picked his fork back up, and resumed shovelling his huge breakfast into his mouth. How could he eat after that? Well… it’d been
Potter sighed with relief as he voided himself. Draco was frozen, he stared at his own reflection in the mirror and willed himself not to blush, and not to look.
Draco blinked at him, and opened his mouth to speak. ‘I tend to feel …' He closed his mouth, swallowed. His eyes shifted to the pedestrians passing by. Harry waited, letting him take his time. ‘I tend to feel a bit like a wet tea towel, all wrung out, after these things.’
The bed felt warm and inviting from Malfoy’s body heat, the small bed barely accommodated them both, leaving about 5 centimetres between them. He drifted off easily, into a deep sleep.
Draco smiled sadly. ‘Yes. It can be. Unfortunately, not everyone is as lucky as the woman you saw today.’
Draco laughed, low in his throat. ‘Hush, I’m only teasing.’ And he brought his other hand to Harry’s other arse cheek—spreading Harry open wide with both hands. ‘I’m going to eat you out now, Harry,’ he said in a low, sultry voice.
'Perfect. Press your "on" switches now. For everyone else, the button has the following symbol.' Angelpreet drew a line and most of a circle on the chalkboard behind her desk. 'They may be on different areas of your computer, depending on the make and model you are using. But our computers here have them on the top of the computer console. Press them now, and if you're having any trouble, please raise your hand and I'll be right 'round.'
Nodding, Harry opening the door wider for Neville to enter. Neville sat in Harry’s one armchair, so Harry took the wooden chair at the desk.
Morgan quirked an eyebrow. 'Forgive me, but you don't really strike me as someone who travels to see beaches?'
He and Draco stood at the ‘drink’ table, and Harry could only look at the unlabelled bottles with increasing wariness.
She sighed. ‘Just start at the beginning. Of this school year,’ she rushed to add, rolling her eyes.
Draco nodded. 'I hope we did right by him. The veterans certainly enjoyed learning how to shoot, and had much fun going off in groups on photoshoots every Sunday afternoon.' He took a sweeping glance at the photographs displayed on the walls. 'It was a great way for them to try something new, something creative. They really took to it.' He was proud of them—he was
Malfoy must have dropped his bag; it and its contents were splayed out on the ground. Maybe Harry had been the one to knock it off his shoulder.
‘So,’ he started, his chair rocking on its own, as he looked from face to face, each peering back at him with poorly-veiled excitement. Well, except for Luna, who was watching him with a small, knowing smile.
Malfoy just looked back at him, while his expression betrayed nothing. “No. We’re not.” He said those words definitively and flatly.
Harry gripped tight to Malfoy’s hips, thrusting hard. He leaned over, planting kisses on Malfoy’s spine. A hand found Malfoy’s chest, found pebbled nipples, the sparse invisible hair on a chest, the smooth texture of Malfoy’s scars, the grooves of rib bones, the dip of a navel, a half-hard cock, and bollocks that swung with every thrust. Harry tried to memorise it all. How long had he wanted this? Years?
'Sorry. It's been nearly ten minutes, though.' Harry looked down Draco's chest, and a complicated expression Draco was too groggy to interpret passed over his face, before his eyes darted back up.
He waited until he was back at his spot before he allowed himself to absorb what Potter had said. He sank to his knees at the end of the dock.
'Evan,' the bathroom guy said, sounding rather patronising, really. And he took a step closer to Harry.
Harry obeyed, tentatively. That’s when something happened that Harry’s mind couldn’t quite process: Malfoy was unbuttoning his pajama top.
Draco picked up Harry’s hand from his lap and squeezed it. He didn’t drop it, instead he cradled it in his own lap. ‘Yes.’
And the room felt tense, as the space between them appeared to grow with each passing moment of silence.
He dumped his bag on the kitchen table, and slumped down on the chair. Well, he’d survived that ordeal. He eyed his bag wearily. Why’d he buy those socks?
They lay in bed, talking in whispers and kissing sweetly until the early hours—until it became time for Harry to return to his own dorm.
Harry knocked on their dark red door. It had a little autumn-themed wreath in the centre—all tangled twigs and coloured leaves.
-ed, then he bent around Harry to carefully do the same to his arse. Once they were clean, he looked up at Harry with an open expression. ‘You did, but, that was the catalyst that changed my life for the better, wasn’t it? I don’t regret it, and, I think, neither should you.’
Silence returned to the room, as did the heavy weight on Draco’s chest—like a metal chain wrapped around his heart. It seemed to tighten, weaving through his ribcage, heavy and impossible to ignore. He rubbed his knuckles over the centre of his chest, and felt minor relief.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, and looked rather apologetic. 'We ended up talking through the night. There were a lot of tears, and then there were laughs, and, um … Well we sorted everything out.'
‘Oh. Well, work-wise I founded a few charities.’ Draco snuck a glance at Potter to gage his reaction—but Potter’s expression revealed nothing, just staring straight ahead.
'Exactly.' He exhaled hard. 'Well, anyhow, it wasn't much. He just came at me, saying you belonged to him or some horseshite. I told him you were perfectly capable of deciding your partners for yourself. And that was that.'
Harry swallowed, and lowered his wand a fraction. Despite the disturbing sight, ghosts were not dangerous. He looked around at his classmates, Malfoy was staring at the thing, his face even paler (if that was possible). Malfoy gulped, and his eyes flashed to Harry’s—wide and unreadable.
Draco clamped his mouth shut, and picked at a loose thread on the seam of his trousers. Then he looked back at her properly. ‘Really I should … I should apologise.’
Draco had never thought Potter insecure—never thought he was insecure about anything. He was confident and perfect, always triumphing and doing what was right. So, he didn’t know where all this was coming from. He exhaled slowly, and found himself smiling again. “You did.”
'Oh, yes, sure.' Draco pulled out a bunch of clean clothes, and handed over a set to Harry. He blinked for a moment. 'I'll just ... change in the bathroom, then.' Why was he suddenly awkward? What—because they were alone in what was technically a bedroom together?
He obeyed, standing and walking to meet her in the centre. Harry watched on in awe, as the pair closed their eyes and brought their lips together in a long, closed-mouth kiss. So weird. They would make the oddest couple.
Harry broke away, and propped himself up on an elbow to look down at Draco. He tucked a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear and said, “You have beautiful eyes.”
‘Yeah, all right.’ Water might be a reasonable idea. He accepted the glass and downed the rest. Three empty glasses were firmly entwined in his sticky fingers. He eyed them, and said, ‘More souvenirs for me.’
Pansy hesitated; her eyes darting to the others at Harry’s table, who were, understandably, waiting to see what might unfold. So in order to grant the two of them a small semblance of privacy from the watchful eyes, he stood up from the bench, and walked the few steps toward her.
'He said it was just sex, that he needs to "blow off steam" sometimes. And if I'm not around …' Harry cleared his throat. 'Well, he effectively admitted to it happening before. He tried very hard to convince me I was overreacting, that everyone sleeps around.'
Pansy laughed. Draco’s soft expression had changed in a flash—into something infinitely more scandalised, paired with a warning glare.
Then Harry shuffled over to the refrigerator, and opened it up. Met with a blast of cool air, he remembered: that's right, Draco had nearly nothing to eat.
He shot her a pained looked, which just made her laugh. “Oh Harry. You’ll be alright. It’s just a kiss.”
,’ Harry mused, before taking a sip, and surveying the happy wedding guests—some dancing to Muggle pop music, some sat at the dozen or so round tables arranged around the grassy "dancefloor".
Harry huffed a laugh, and bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “I begged it to put me in Gryffindor, because you’d put me off.”
‘Oh,’ Harry said. ‘That’s … very nice. But I’m okay, really.’ He flashed her a smile, and then busied himself with piling toast onto his plate. He glanced up, to see Draco still watching him. When their eyes met, the corner of Draco’s mouth twitched.
Draco twisted around once more, and produced a palm-full of body wash. He rubbed his hands together to lather it, and then he brought both palms to Harry's chest, and rubbed his hands up to Harry's neck.
. “Well … what’s there to say. We weren’t happy, we didn’t really love each other anymore, and it took us both far too long to admit that to ourselves.”
And, maybe because it was the middle of the night (because in the middle of the night it’s easier to be honest), Malfoy looked off to his right, and, speaking softly, said, ‘The Dark Lord has given me a task. If I don’t do it, he’ll kill me and my family. I’m supposed to …' He groaned suddenly, and rubbed his eyes.
He took a breath, puffing out his cheeks. 'Hello everyone. I'm Draco,' he shot a smile at a couple people who caught his eye. 'I'm here because my work's gone paperless, so I'm told I need to learn computers if I'm to do a decent job moving forward.'
‘I don’t want to imagine what my life would be like, if you hadn’t offered to help me. What if I’d succeeded in killing Dumbledore? In getting Death Eaters into the school? I’d be beyond hope, then. Beyond redemption. I’d be a monster. I could’ve died if I stayed on the path—or gone to Azkaban. This,’ he said, touching a hand to his scars, ‘saved me. And it gave me you.’
So he climbed out of bed, and began his morning routine. Shower, put on pants, brew the coffee and have breakfast. Today … today he felt like something hot and cheesy. Frozen pizza. Yes, that’d be perfect.
‘I don’t know, I’m sure there’s some reason for it,’ he said, willing himself to keep it together. ‘You could look it up in the library when we’re back.’
Blaise threw Draco a knowing smirk, before continuing on with what he’d been saying. Though Draco was finding it very difficult to pay attention.
They passed by the heaps of fat bouquets displayed outside, and pushed through the door. It made a pleasant tinkling sound.
‘I’ll go first,’ said Pansy, with a devious expression on her face as she held on to Malfoy’s wrist. He looked like he was ready to bolt at any moment himself.
'I wonder …' Draco said, coming up close to the altar, eyeing the long table there, and hoping that it wasn't the sort used for sacrifices. Muggles didn’t do that anymore, did they? He turned to Harry, who took the opportunity to snap a quick picture of him in front of the altar and the massive organ behind him. Draco rolled his eyes, but chose not comment. 'Perhaps because we became too powerful, too strong united, that we thought
He felt himself getting hard again, just at the sight of Draco—naked and waiting. Draco's eyes were heavily lidded, his lips parted. He was just looking at Harry—Harry's body—watching as Harry's own cock filled.
It was so like Harry's own, but different. Pinker where Harry's was a darker brown, and just a bit thinner and longer. And Harry's cockhead was thicker. Harry's fingers traced over the differences, mapping them, trying to memorise them.
When Harry’s hunger was satisfied (he’d forgot that he hadn’t eaten for 24 hours), and Malfoy was still nibbling away, Harry filled him in on the meeting with Dumbledore.
Draco shook his head at him, but found himself smiling. He carefully manoeuvred the glasses off Harry's face, since they were crooked and one of the ends had come off Harry's ear.
Draco didn’t mind. So he carried her, and managed not to drop her until they reached the king-sized bed. He plopped her down onto the overstuffed white comforter and she bounced, giggling.
They sat in companionable silence, looking out at the landscape. Those vultures weren’t in the air anymore.
Before he was about to disappear around a bend in the path, Potter turned to look back over his shoulder, for some reason.
Harry went back to his spices, unable to keep a smile from his face, as Draco's clacking resumed. Harry poured the spice mixture into a deep dish, added the yoghurt and the lamb pieces, and mixed it all together. Next he covered the bowl, and set it inside the fridge to sit.
A sales associate seemed to take pity on him—he must look so lost, standing in the entranceway like that. She approached, with black hair cropped at her chin, wearing a bright red jumper and a little Santa hat atop her head.
Draco looked like he couldn't decide if he was amused or exasperated. 'You honestly expect me to put these on while you're cooking?'
People milled about again, with soft pop music playing from the wireless, and plump cushions arranged around the floor for sitting. The warm, golden room still smelled of cinnamon. Harry really liked Hufflepuff—it had to be his second favourite house, he thought.
Draco finished carefully placing all of his clothes in the drawers. The last item was his Muggle novel, 'A Clash of Kings'. He grabbed it and snapped the suitcase closed—sliding it against the wall, out of the way. He brought his book over to the unoccupied bed.
'I hope you like it,' Harry said, smiling through his bit lower lip. He'd never cooked for anyone while
He hesitated there, and an uncertain feeling wiggled its way into his consciousness. He hadn’t gotten Malfoy a wedding gift … should he?
it's lovely,' Harry said, awed. He rounded on Draco, and marvelled at the faint glow of different colours lighting his skin in the darkness.
Draco blinked at the florescent lighting of the hallway, as they weaved their way towards the lobby.
Harry pushed his way through, to stand in front of Draco, who, was eyeing him with a bit of bewilderment.
“Er, how have you been?” Harry asked, and suppressed a wince. He sounded so boring. Did Malfoy think him boring? (
here,' Harry remarked as he set a yellow polka-dotted towel down overtop the sand. He climbed onto it, stretching his legs out towards the water. 'And Bob Dylan lived in the lighthouse here for a time.'
When it did, he surprised himself at how happy he felt. Excited, even. Like it wasn’t just watching images move on a flat screen.
Harry tucked his wand away in the beach bag. 'Oh, not a whole lot, really. Just some cleaning spells at home, maybe an Accio here and there when I'm tired.'
Malfoy sucked in a breath. ‘I—Well, since I was the one that was supposed to do it—I wanted you to be sure. That it wasn’t me. Though … me just telling you, might not have been much to go on anyway. Though you say you were there, so, I guess I don’t have to prove it …'
It was Malfoy’s turn to be shocked, though he tried to hide it. His face contorted into what looked like surprise, then doubt, then something more complicated. His eyes were blinking slowly at Harry, Harry didn’t know what it meant. And then, just like that, the face was blank again, an impenetrable wall.
Harry let out a quick exhale, and shot the woman a forced, polite smile. He glanced at Malfoy—reluctantly.
Harry grinned, nuzzling into Draco's warm neck. 'I love you too, Draco Malfoy.' He planted a kiss there. ‘Now, time to get started on dinner preparations.’
In short, he’d ruined any semblance of a chance long ago. That’s why he didn’t disillusion himself to think Pansy’s scheming was anything but a
. And then that made him feel guilty straight away. It was mean to think it. Was he becoming mean? Resentful? So that anything she did that would be natural for anyone else bothered him?
Lila exchanged looks with her friends, and, ever the spokesperson, asked, ‘Have you figured out who your gift-giver is yet?’
Potter said the word “love” so sweetly (that was the second time now). Draco really liked the sound of it.
Harry used the controller thing to put on something called ‘Good Will Hunting’ on the ‘pay per view’. Harry had heard of the movie before, apparently. It wasn’t moving drawings this time, rather it was real people. The film looked like normal photographs, except better because they didn’t just loop the same scene over and over, and the film had sound. It was just as fascinating as Mulan, only in a different way.
to learn more about Potter, even if he learned some upsetting things. It was like... well, like Potter trusted him, at least to a degree. And that, in itself, felt like a privilege. And to speak to each other like they were just two people, instead of rivals who’d been at each other’s throats for years, was just... strange and new and kind of wonderful.
Malfoy smiled. “It’s been years since I got to see one, besides those shoddy amateurs at school, of course.”
Draco tried to keep up. But he was British and raised in ballrooms, so he was never going to escape a certain stiffness. The alcohol helped, though. And Dave didn't seem to mind.
“Then fuck me,” Harry said, pulling Malfoy’s trousers and pants down and off. Revealing the most perfect cock and balls. Leaking and hard for
He faced Draco, squirming to get comfortable against the pillow, and Draco slowly turned to follow suit.
But nothing was happening. She used to seem to glow when he looked at her. Like she was set apart somehow—more radiant, more alive than other people. But Ginny didn't seem to glow any longer. To him, she seemed like any other person. Her freckles that he'd loved, that he'd kissed … were just brown spots on her pale skin. Her long red hair was … just hair. Her eyes seemed to hold no light in them. Harry felt nothing, looking at her.
'You should stay here again, next time you come.' Harry looked around the room. 'Good food, decent room size. Fish tank in the lobby.'
Whilst shooting Pansy another frenzied, angry glare, Draco did what he was told, touching the Portkey that Pansy had in her hand—a toy doll with red yarn for hair.
“You don’t have to,” Hermione said. “What’s that quote? Ah … something like ‘One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.’ I think it was Paulo Coelho who said it?”
'Not all of it.' He kissed at Draco's mouth, once, twice. 'You know, I first felt a sudden urge to kiss you when I learnt you knew the words to a Britney Spears song.'
Harry walked down to breakfast with Hermione and Ron. Once in the Great Hall, he diverted paths, saying, ‘I’ll see you guys in Potions.’
'Well … it was a bit dodgy of a circus, to be frank. Small and clumsy and a bit rough around the edges. It had heart, though, I give it that.'
Potter pushed himself up, and turned to face him, sitting cross-legged. ‘This is all your way of telling me you fancy me?’
He rubbed at his forehead. Right. He usually picked a word for the end of the first line, something that would rhyme with other appropriate words.
Draco jumped, just a little, and turned to the source of the voice. 'Harry,' he said, trying to hide his shock. There Harry was, in the flesh, and ... and exceptionally handsome in a herringbone grey Muggle suit and black tie.
Malfoy clinked their glasses together. “It’s how you say ‘cheers’ here, Potter. Essentially means ‘to your health’.” Then, he took a sip, looking off of the terrace.
It was a Saturday morning and Harry found himself stood with a scrap of parchment in his hand inside McGonagall’s office. There was an address written on it, in Malfoy’s familiar elegant loopy handwriting.
Draco’s eyes dropped to the blanket, and he ran his hand over the fabric. ‘All right, so, I thought …’ He exhaled. ‘I thought you had your real friends back again so you didn’t need me anymore.’
Harry stared at the opposite wall to the one he was leaning on. Someone had etched a daisy in the paint. ‘There’s nothing to talk about. I’m gonna finish using the toilet, and then I’ll go back out there.’
Maybe she was the person on the other end of his journal. Maybe he’d been sharing his innermost thoughts and feelings with
So Draco switched it on, and a lovely Vivaldi concerto was playing. Reluctantly, he turned the dial. Celestina Warbeck. Something warbly. A man droning on about current events. Something twangy. Jazz. Piano.
He pulled up a stool so that he could sit on Draco’s right. A long-black-haired witch was bent over his left arm, tattooing him. Harry took Draco’s right hand into his lap, and peered over to watch.
Potter nodded, looking back at him. His eyes shone in the moonlight … it made it a little harder to breathe. Merlin. Draco had it bad. But … that was okay. He could handle it.
The waiter came along with the bill, which Harry paid by credit card. Malfoy fiddled with his napkin; eyeing Harry funny as he paid.
Ginny looked small, standing alone in the warm orange glow of the den with a too-big striped jumper on.
If they were ready, brilliant. If they weren't, well, that'd be brilliant too, because he'd get to be in a bed with Draco all night long.
Potter exhaled slow. ‘I moved to Barcelona first, when I left London. Weeks passed, and the guilt of my sudden desertion became harder and harder to bear. Eventually I had to tell my friends where I’d gone, and my reasons …’ Potter squeezed Draco’s hand, just a little. ‘It didn’t go over well.’
‘We don’t have to stay here, in the airport, you know,’ Draco murmured, still looking at Harry’s mouth—like he was a bit dazed.
Potter swallowed his food, and went to cut off another piece. Draco couldn’t tell if Potter’s cheeks had darkened or if it was just his imagination. “So, you like blokes then, I take it? I mean... you don’t have to answer that. You don’t have to tell—”
Draco turned to watch him grab a handful of Floo-powder, and arrange himself in the hearth. Harry looked up at him for a brief moment, and shot him a little smile.
God … Harry wished again that he’d never known, never heard that sodding magical pearl. It was better to think Draco Malfoy hated him—it was easier and far less complicated.
“Morning,” Ron replied, casting a glance at Harry—looking a bit frazzled, with hair unkempt and darkness under his eyes.
Draco shook his head. “Do one of those things you mentioned. I know you’re more of the ‘doing’ type.”
” he answered, leaning up to kiss Malfoy’s mouth. Softer this time. Malfoy melted into it for a beat—before stiffening and pulling back again.
Furthermore, maybe Pansy was right … that he’d wonder the rest of his life as to what could’ve been, knowing he hadn’t even once
Robespierre made a clicking nose with his beak, then flapped out of the bedroom, towards the living room. Maybe he needed a rest after all that flying.
Draco moved to look around, then stopped himself. He didn't really want an eyeful of anyone's bare body at the moment. Far too hungover. 'Well … thank you for the warning.'
Yes … overall, it was a bit lonely, being surrounded by couples, teenagers who were living in a Voldemort-free world for once. Happy, carefree people. He so wished he could be the same.
Molly broke off from the group, and stood still, watching Harry, just to the side of the path. Once he’d caught up to her, she placed a hand on his upper arm, and said in a low voice, ‘Harry dear, George doesn’t want to sleep in his room.’
Harry kept going. ‘The way I see it is … you were a child, same as the rest of us. You were coerced by quite possibly the most evil wizard who has ever lived. Your family, who were the ones who roped you in with Voldemort in the first place, were in danger. You did what you felt you had to, to survive. For your family to survive. That’s not to say that I think you’re completely innocent … I just … I just don’t think the rest of your life should be ruined because of it.’ He took a breath. ‘You don’t need the Mark as a reminder, because you’re not going to forget your past. You’ll never forget it, but … hopefully you can find some peace and self-knowledge there. And forgiveness.’
been the one Draco had emphasised, and it amused him how much the simple idea put Draco off. How bad could it possibly be, really? Could be good for a laugh, if anything. He scooped up the last forkful of food on his plate and shoved it in his mouth. Then he pushed his chair back, grabbed both their empty plates and brought them to the sink. 'Where's your parchment paper?'
things. I wanted to see the world, and see how much I could do … how much I could help. So, I joined MSF. And I
The halls outside Hufflepuff were a stark contrast to the inside. Gone were the soft sounds of pop music, the laughter of his schoolmates, the warm lighting.
‘I’ve refused anything from my parents. After the war, I … That’s why it’s …' He cleared his throat. ‘But I quite like it this way.’
Harry looked from Draco’s face to the tapestry. Sirius. Andromeda. He licked his lips. ‘We could burn yours off too.’
Hermione and Ron came by, looking about as sombre as Harry felt. They sat themselves around his living room, with mugs of tea.
'Are you going to phone the police?' he asked, rearranging the glasses more comfortably in his sticky fingers.
Then a cube-shaped package, about the size of a Quaffle, dropped down in front of him as well—knocking over a basket of bagels. Harry tucked his letters beside his plate and picked up the package instead, ignoring the toppled baked goods.
Malfoy sat down on his designer-brand wicker deck chair, and looked out onto the near-deserted London street below them. ‘So what have you been occupying your time with?’
“I don’t know—and no! You’ve got it all wrong! It’s just a joke! It’s a long story, involving a wedding gift and a salesgirl—”
He chose one at random, a small purple envelope, without a return address, and ran some diagnostic spells on it.
Harry leaned forward; he was going to get up. His traitorous heart pounded against his ribs, seemingly
. He gave his head a little shake, as if to clear it. ‘Well … what I came to ask was … are you still friends with him?’
The men made quick work out of getting the cabinet out of the box, out of the bubble wrapping, and finally pressed flush against the wall.
A happy, breathy laugh, and Harry’s hand on his shoulder shifted, until Draco could feel warm fingertips gently grazing the back of his neck. ‘It’d be romantic if we kissed right now, wouldn't it?’
They slowed their dancing to a stop, and Draco removed his hand from Harry’s so that he could touch his cheek, then the shell of his ear, and finally lace his fingers through those thick, greying black curls. And Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s back, and pressed him in even closer. Their lips moved in a tentative, somewhat uncertain, dance of their own.
Malfoy smiled. He seemed relieved. Harry felt a bit relieved himself. “Well … that was a heavy conversation to start a date with.”
Once paid up, they exited into the hallway, went down the lift, and emerged into the bustling street.
“But that’s not real—that's a painting or a story. In this world, people need people. People need to live their lives, even if that means dealing with the harder stuff, because that’s real.”
Both of them froze, looking up at Minerva standing just behind her office desk—dressed in a frilly pink and purple polka-dotted nightgown, and holding a paperback.
Harry hummed his acknowledgement, leaning his back against the cool stone wall. He stared off down the corridor, unseeing. He couldn’t get the sound of his name, softly spoken in Malfoy’s voice, out of his mind.
Someone straddled up next to him, unzipping their flies, right at the urinal next to him when there were two others open.
There seemed to be a lot of raucous young people in bathing suits and jean shorts on the streets. He squinted at them, and remembered his sunglasses. They were black, plastic things. More expensive then they ought to be, considering the material. He unhooked them from the lip of his shirt and put them on.
“Sure, out of pity or goodness or something.” He felt Potter’s eyes on him, so he looked over. And Potter seemed so earnest and wide-eyed there.
A pause, making Draco wonder for a moment if Potter had heard him. ‘I used to. I hadn’t for a few months, but …’ His eyebrows furrowed. ‘But I think I’ll start coming more.’
Potter licked his lips. Potter had beautiful lips. But everything about him was beautiful, and lovely, and
He kept turning the pages, reading bitter messages of scorn, of anger, about him. There was just one person he could think of who had spent this much energy, and this much time, hating him. Someone who’d be drawn with yellow pencil crayon hair, and skin the white of parchment paper. And that person, of course, was Draco Malfoy.
‘Ginny taught me to be more mindful of my feet,’ Harry said, and Draco watched his mouth move as he spoke.
“Oh. I don’t know.” The easy way they spoke, the easy way Harry would smile at him. It made his chest ache just thinking of it. He wasn’t sure he liked the feeling. It felt heavy, it felt ... like it was almost too much for him.
‘So, I entered the Muggle world, and I found every door open. They didn’t know who I was, they didn’t care about the mark on my arm.’
The door opened, and the crowd of Aurors came out, along with Professor Vector, noisily moving down the hallway.
The edge of Malfoy’s mouth lifted up a bit. God, Harry liked these new expressions. So much better than smirks and scowls. “Yes.” Malfoy leant forward more, almost to the centre of the table. His gaze fell to Harry’s mouth.
“You looked a bit tired, maybe a bit grumpy, that’s all I meant. And I like your clothes, they just aren’t what I’d expect you to wear,” Potter finished.
Draco nodded, and then he looked up at the television. “And we can actually watch a film in here? Muggle technology will work?”
He’ll have to try to pretend he’d never send it, he supposed. And, if it was bad, he didn’t even have to send it, he realised. That took a little pressure off.
He emerged out into the bar area, and found Harry leaning with his back against the bar, sipping a red drink. When he noticed Draco, a warm, lazy smile grew on his face.
Harry fumbled around for his glasses and his wand on the nightstand. He cast Tempus, and sat up abruptly. He’d slept a lot. The Portkey was set to take him back in roughly an hour.
He sighed and cracked the journal open to the first page. Harry's eyebrows shot up when he saw elegant cursive writing already there. He hadn't thought Flourish and Blotts would sell a used diary. He flipped the pages, but just the first one had writing on it.
Draco wiped the wetness from his eyes, and blinked out at the now-familiar scenery. It was peaceful, silent. Just the sounds of the lapping water against the shore, the birds, and a car in the distance. Like a soothing balm over his wounded chest.
Harry tilted his head up to look at Draco, and registered the worry there in Draco’s wide eyes, in his scrunched brow.
Draco winced. Sure, he could’ve just outright said that instead of the long-winded recap, he supposed. ‘Yes.’
He pinched his mouth shut, and leaned back into his pillow to face the ceiling above. “It just might all be … too much.”
Harry found a quiet spot, hidden from castle view by a massive tree, overlooking the lake. He cast a warming charm. He wasn’t exactly cold, but he was going to need it soon anyways if he stayed sitting for a while.
He watched Harry gracefully dive into the crystal-clear turquoise water as he pulled off his loose tank top and tossed it aside.
'This is just like what we'd written about, all those weeks ago,' Harry said softly, as Draco carded his fingers through his hair again. 'It started in the shower, that fantasy. When I didn't know you were you, and you didn't know I was me.'
Draco nodded, collecting himself after that surprise. “Very nice, except I muddied my sock,” he said, spinning his muddy sock around in his hand.
Perhaps it was a Gryffindor trait—direct kindness to the undeserving. They were probably going around
And then after dinner, he had to lug the thing back to their room. Potter was there already; Draco had come at the exact moment that Potter was pushing his arm into the sleeve of a dark green jumper. Potter adjusted the jumper’s cuff and eyed Draco.
Draco leaned in, holding a hand to Harry's waist, gently—for balance. And he kissed Harry's lips, soft and slow and gentle.
Harry flipped open his textbook with a sigh. He still had a week before the assignment was due, but this was the sort of person he’d evidently become.
And what was more, Harry Potter had a whole life here, a life that was farther away from Draco than mere distance. And Draco was nothing more than a momentary spectator, with no right to barge in. This much was quite clear.
As Harry walked through the Great Hall doors, the first thing he noticed was that Malfoy had shown up to breakfast. Harry’s heartrate sped up. Malfoy looked even more dishevelled than the day before. He had dark circles under his eyes, like he hadn’t slept a wink.
, until I saw first-hand how those beliefs affected real people.” He dipped his head for a moment and took a breath. “When I saw... when I watched people tortured and killed simply for the circumstances of their birth. I—” He sucked in another breath. “I realised too late how wrong I’d been. How sick and depraved those ideas are...”
Ah. There it was—a metal bit, sticking out near his shoulder. Tentatively he grasped it, and pulled. It unravelled a little, before halting full-stop. Draco tugged harder, and it wouldn't budge.
'Can I help you gentlemen with anything?' the lady with the ferns asked, wiping her hands on her apron.
Harry realised he wasn’t hugging back. He lifted his arms to wrap gently around Draco’s back. ‘Are you okay?’ he asked softly.
Draco opened his mouth, and closed it again. Opened it, closed it. Potter stretched his arms and legs—straight out.
A huge, burly, tattooed man came out to Harry. He eyed the poster in front of Harry. ‘This one?’ he grunted, pointing at the Gyfu.
Astoria wrapped her hands around Draco’s waist, and laid her forehead against his chest. Draco’s could feel his own heart beating fast, thrumming through his veins. He brought his arms around her, and held on to her tight. He was doing the right thing, for everyone's sake—he was sure of it. A little distance would help put his head back on straight. He needed to get his priorities sorted. He needed to focus on what was truly important.
They stayed like that for a while. Harry felt Draco’s body ease, as he sunk deeper into Harry’s arms. He was gripping Harry less like a near-drowner clutching a buoy, and more like a person holding on to something precious, something delicate. His tears slowed and then stopped altogether. His breath evened out, against Harry’s scalp and the top of his ear.
Everything he’d been trying to repress, to quash down, was flooding up to the surface. Ready to boil over.
holding doors for Draco, then. Though, would Draco really expect Potter to let the door slam closed in his face? Perhaps not. But... maybe.
Draco could use a laugh today—everything was rather repetitive these days. Was his life getting a bit dull? Well … he hoped not.
Salazar, this was rather complicated, wasn’t it? He sighed to himself, then took a long swig of his drink.
After a while, when the sun was getting higher in the sky, Draco wished he had his book. So he picked himself up, shook out the cramping in his legs, and made his way back up to his room.
'We didn't like each other much in the early years,' Harry stepped in. 'But we got to know and understand each other better in our senior years.'
He freed his cock from his pyjama bottoms then, taking himself in hand, swirling the pre-come around the tip with his thumb. He imagined her spreading her legs slowly, while he watched, and she wasn’t wearing any knickers. He’d push Pansy onto her back on the desk; he’d lean into her and ravish her with his mouth, between those long, pale legs.
Harry pushed the strands of sweaty hair out of his face, and he smiled. Probably dreamily. Or goofily. But … he was happy.
'Hello,' called a middle-aged woman from the back, wearing a dark green apron. She seemed to be sticking leafy ferns into a green cube of some sort.
Draco huffed from the living room, wiping his eyes with his wonky knitted blanket. ‘Let me know when it’s safe to return.’
Draco rubbed his face, then pushed himself up to stand. 'She's got a point,' he admitted out loud, even though Harry wouldn't likely have heard all the whispered words in his ear. Unless he had, since Morgan is not subtle in anything she attempts.
‘Later,’ said Draco, roughly, and pushed himself up into a sitting position, which made Harry have to scramble to sit up too. Their legs were still intertwined in the sheets.
Malfoy straightened up, and moved on to another station, looking inside the cauldron and smiling encouragingly at the girl sitting there. He tucked a loose strand of white-blond hair behind his ear, before moving to another row. Malfoy licked at his bottom lip, said something quietly to the student there, who hurriedly dropped in a fistful of an ingredient. Malfoy nodded, smiling at the boy. His eyes smiled too. It wasn’t just Malfoy’s mouth.
Harry pulled out a strip of parchment paper, and began to write his essay on the effects of bat tongues in revival-type potions, but his eye kept straying to the journal.
Harry’s smile widened. “It told me I’d do well in Slytherin, that it’d help me on the way to greatness, or some bollocks.”
‘Mm,’ Harry acknowledged, sucking a spot underneath Malfoy’s ear. Malfoy’s body arched with a gasp. He undid the last of Malfoy’s buttons, and pushed the shirt off.
And they’re friends. He won’t assume they’re anything more than that. Maybe Slytherins or Purebloods or whatever do this kind of thing—they … “help each other out”. Loads of people have casual sex, come to think about it. And this was sort of like that, indirect casual sex.
Draco dropped his hand from Harry’s arm, and reached into his dressing robe pocket, pulling out his wand. He cast a warming charm on Harry—enveloping him in a sudden, safe warmth. Draco’s magic humming on his skin felt fuzzy, like a blanket.
‘Harry,’ she said sternly, ‘did Malfoy look like he’d been having you on when you figured out the truth? Did he laugh and say, “Gotcha”?’
“Hmm?” Draco asked, adjusting the hoodie, getting it into the proper place. He looked at Harry, who looked back at him with mouth clamped shut, pulling on the other sleeve.
After that, he spent a few minutes, just looking around at the room. Thinking he’d miss it—miss Draco.
The song shifted into something else, and Ruben came up between them. 'Je m'excuse,' he said firmly.
“Draco!” said Pansy when she noticed him approach. “How’s your new arrangement?” She winked at him, grinning.
She’d grab his hair, grind his tongue into her, with her legs wrapped tight around him. Tasting her, hearing her moan his name.
academic articles. He was published in all the top potions periodicals. He was a bit of a nerd, really.
Both of Malfoy’s slender pale hands wrapped around his mug as he leant forward, just slightly. “Usually it doesn’t mean anything.” Malfoy’s expression took on a new intensity.
He popped into a cosy Muggle café first, finding it bustling with patrons all bundled up in their puffy coats and long scarves. Chatter, the whirl of the espresso machine, and the sound of fingers rapidly pressing plastic buttons on a few of those—what did Muggles call them? Laptaps? Laptops?—filled the air. The décor was dominated by warm, dark mahogany with green accents, and tasteful wreaths and garlands here-and-there for the Holidays. Draco breathed in the rich scent of coffee beans, as he joined the back of the queue. As he waited, he squinted at the chalkboard above the counter, trying to decide what to get. Perhaps he should get something festive … something warm and jolly to match the general feel of the season.
He blinked rapidly, unable to keep the sensory memory of Malfoy’s lips on his own from flooding his mind. “Er …" He felt a blush creep up again, and his heart hammered. What was wrong with him?
?” Other patrons were definitely staring, a waiter cast Draco an annoyed look. He didn’t give a shit.
‘He wouldn’t want us all sitting around, wearing black, sobbing and feeling bad. He’d want … he’d want music, dancing, a Quidditch game, even.
Potter exhaled. Slow. “Yeah. I don’t want to find out you’ve disappeared after school. I don’t want to wonder if you’re alive, or... or not.”
“Yeah,” he said, and it came out a bit breathless. “Thanks, I think this party is exactly what I needed.”
“Well, no,” Harry said, fishing around in his pocket for the correct Portkey. “I just asked if she’d authorize a Portkey, and she accepted.” He pulled out the wrapped-up clothespin, and unwrapped it to rest on the fabric on his palm, holding it out towards Malfoy.
In the clearing, Draco remembered fondly that initial calm he’d felt when they’d landed there. It'd been like a premonition for what was to come—essentially the best trip of his life, actually. Even better than the Paris vacation with his parents when he was ten.
But part of him still felt … somewhat rejected. And it’s fine to be rejected. It’s well within Malfoy’s rights to reject him.
Harry let out a moan, into Draco's mouth, and Draco just kept tonguing at him, as his hand pumped harder.
Harry shrugged, then took a bite of croissant. “Getting some fresh air,” he said as he chewed the flaky, buttery pastry.
Harry stared down at the menu, then glanced up at Malfoy, who was shaking his head again studying his menu. But a small smile played on his lips. Harry bit his, just looking at Malfoy.
‘That’s interesting,’ Harry said, grabbing for a spring roll, ‘because I think you look really fit in yours.’ He bit off the end with a crunch, and eyed the Panang. He'd try that next.
they weren’t going to understand. And it felt like a private thing—something he wanted to keep all for himself. But … if he was going to be "sort-of-friends" with Malfoy, his best friends were going to have to find out sometime. He bit his lip, then said, ‘I was with Malfoy.’
He knew he shouldn’t think it, he knew that there were about a million reasons he shouldn’t be thinking it now.
The rest of their day played out normally. No mention of their explicit conversation. Nothing had changed, really.
The next photo was Harry at twelve, Draco was sure of it. So little, yet so relentlessly determined. He licked at his bottom lip, and clicked through.
Dave beep-beeped his car open, and walked around to the driver's side. He looked up at Harry, tossing him a kind smile, then opened the door and slipped inside.
Before he could finish, a pimple-faced Draco Malfoy began shooting Stinging Hexes at the both of them.
Harry had smiled as he read, but the smile fell when he read Ginny’s name. Shit. He’d forgotten to include her in all this.
Harry exhaled, closing the book with a snap, while his eyes darted over to Neville (who was pretending not to pay attention). ‘This is Draco Malfoy’s childhood diary.’
“Five, four, three, two, one,” Flitwick counted down, with one hand on his Portkey umbrella that he held high above himself to share with four students, and the other hand on his pocket watch to read the time.
“I want to,” he said decidedly, and pawed at the blanket that was still wrapped around Harry’s waist. Harry’s hand—regrettably—left Draco’s cock, and he helped to free himself, removing the blanket and then pushing his boxer briefs down.
‘Okay, yeah. That’s good.’ He grabbed some clean clothes from his trunk and went to the bathroom for a long, long hot shower.
had died? Well … his Mind Healer apparently thought so. Getting back on the proverbial horse, so to speak.
Then, Draco closed the distance, planting soft kisses on Harry’s mouth. Pulling on Harry’s bottom lip with his teeth.
brilliant or anything—that wasn't it. Just, that was a lot of trivia all at once, and he never suspected Harry was a history buff. Afterall, word was he'd never even bothered to read Hogwarts: A History.
Coming back into himself, he swallowed, and did as he was told. Draco extended his stick to aim the marshmallow near the base of the flames, not
He felt himself melt into it. Sod the film. For the moment, anyway. Harry’s mouth was more important.
Draco’s heart broke for her. His own reflection showed scars and marks of evil—a history of pain and bad choices written on his 18-year-old skin. Was that who he was inside? He hoped... he rather hoped
Sat on Draco's desk was a brand-new grey computer. It wasn't like Pansy's laptop, this one was the big boxy sort. He stepped around the desk to get a better look at it. To think … these funny Muggle things held so much knowledge, so much to do and see. Somewhere in there was Harry Potter dancing in his house.
Ginny laughed. Well ... it was good someone could find this amusing. ‘Sorry. It just seems like something you two would do.’
Harry watched Malfoy’s face get closer and closer to his, so that his entire field of vision was pale skin and silvery unreadable eyes. Merlin ... those light colourless eyes were off-putting. Like ...
“Agreed,” he murmured into her hair, holding her like he’ll never let her go, because he won’t. Because he didn’t know any other way to deal with that evening. Because of the rush of grief, of fear, threatening to overcome.
'Not anymore!' Tears were streaming down Harry's cheeks now, and he fumbled to wipe them away quickly.
The upbeat number shifted jarringly into something slow and soft as soon as they stepped onto the patch of grass meant for dancing. A female’s voice began to sing longingly about love. Love … weren’t far too many songs about it? He’d sooner prefer a song about agriculture, like, say, having the finest turnips at the farmer’s market.
Peeling off his clothes in a rush, with stiff, shaky fingers as if the clothes burned him, he left them there in a pile at his feet. And, naked, clammy and cold, he hurried over to the bathroom and into a shower stall.
He watched their retreating backs and sighed in relief. Pansy could’ve easily got him in so much trouble.
Draco felt sad. And kind of stupid. He didn’t know why. He should be relieved that the man he loved thought he didn’t love him, but he felt empty and foolish for some reason.
Draco could only stare at Potter as he unravelled everything that’d taken Draco years to figure out.
'Relax,' said Pansy, with a laugh in her voice. 'It's not the press.' She laid a hand on Harry's arm.
Harry bit his lip, ran a hand through his hair, and leaned back. Well, he wasn’t about to answer unasked questions. It was either be direct, or get nothing. ‘Do you want to, or not?’
‘Don’t need no hateration, holleration, in this dancerie,’ Potter sang/shouted along, just like the French girls, looking back at Draco with amusement dancing in his eyes. ‘Let’s get it percolating, while you're waiting, so just dance for me.’ He tilted his head forward at each line for emphasis.
Her eyes lit up, practically sparkling, at the mention of ‘wedding’. So she was one of those types, then. A romantic. “Of course, sir. Please follow me.” She led him over to a little kiosk, where she selected a couple buttons, until the screen prompted for a name.
Harry felt the corners of his mouth lift … he was smiling. Smiling because of Draco Malfoy. They were smiling … at each other. Malfoy averted his eyes, looking off at the stacks. Then they darted back to Harry once more.
Draco was the first to come—his mouth open against Harry’s, uttering an ‘Ahhh,’ squeezing his eyes shut, and his body jerking and pulsating with pleasure. The sight of it made Harry come immediately, in spurts against Malfoy’s bare stomach, and onto his hand.
'So there wasn't much in the way of security, and Pansy thought it might be nice to have a talk with them. So we wandered around back, with me telling her I wanted to leave, as you can right imagine.' He puffed his cheeks. 'And Pansy chatted up an acrobat, then a few others meandered over. And … Rodney.'
This was all a lot. To take in. God, his heart was hammering in his chest. But … it was the good sort, he supposed.
Harry huffed a laugh, and stood up. In the back of his mind, he remembered his friends, and tossed them a distracted, 'I'll see you guys later.'
There Draco was, looking a bit startled with his Ibizan breakfast. Then a nicely framed shot of his breakfast, and, next … Harry smiling with
Shrugging, Ron said, ‘That’s how they were able to get past all the history. When you don’t know who you’re talking to, you can, like, have a fresh start I s’pose.’
Harry laughed dryly, and finally looked Draco in the eye again. The dry smile faded from his mouth. ‘I think I fancied you then, despite everything.’
Draco would be perfectly comfortable with Blaise in the original arrangement. Blaise never tried to make him do things he didn’t want to do, Blaise just...
Draco coloured and pinched his mouth shut. His wide eyes darted from Harry to a spot on the wall, then back to Harry’s chest. ‘Sorry, that was rude,’ he said, back in his normal tone, and blinking rapidly.
“Give that to me,” Draco said, turning toward the man, and getting hot air in the face as a result. “Ppah!”
They’d been okay this year, so far, but presumably because Draco had stayed out of his way—kept his head down. Granted, he’d tried to stay out of everyone’s way. And now Pansy was about to threaten that semblance of peace. And for what? Did Pansy think simply having them room together would spark some kind of friendship? Or, was it worse—something infinitely more laughable—was she delusional enough to think it could result in romance?
Draco smirked, as he tore the envelope open. “Why waste napkins, when I can just spell my trousers clean anyhow.”
Draco looked at him, and Potter really looked like it’d be okay if Draco did go with him. But, no one wanted Draco there. He knew it, and Potter knew it too. This... this invitation was out of pity.
The Slytherin table had the most free-space—he noted—and next to them it was Hufflepuff. Merlin, it was depressing him.
In the end, he just smashed the thing against the bed. Miraculously, it turned on. He kept smashing, and somehow found himself watching a blue screen and a castle appear.
'I'm … well, just like I said in my letter about me,' Harry started tentatively. 'I'm proud of you, too.'
“Ah.” Well, that’d been a failed attempt at conversation. Not that Draco’s question had been anything special—
Draco shot him a look that said something, something Harry didn’t know how to interpret yet. ‘Me too.’
The game itself was stupid, childish. What were they even doing? They were 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds. They were too old for this.
‘I haven’t done anything, Neville.’ The notes were no more than gibberish, as far as Harry was concerned.
‘We don’t talk about Rio de Janeiro,’ Pansy said quickly. Then she sighed. All she ever did was sigh around him lately, it seemed. ‘Think about it.’
The pulsing beat of the music shifted, and Harry brought Draco close to his chest, dropping his hands.
Draco licked his lips. He had no response for that. He could try to argue, but the fact was: he didn’t know. He didn’t know if Potter was right, or wrong. “Well... I want to... I want to make up for it. For everything. Everything done and... not done. To somehow do something good in the world. I don’t know what, but maybe after I graduate I’ll figure out how to... how to do something good.” Draco's words felt wholly insufficient.
He didn’t need them. He’d get a new jumper from Mrs Weasley this year, and so would most—if not all—of the people on his list. He didn’t have anyone in mind, for these. He just … liked them. Merlin, he was impulsive today.
Pansy led them up to the drink table, and dropped his arm in order to fix drinks for the two of them. Draco looked around while he waited for her. She’d been right, it seemed. It was a very casual gathering, with people just milling about—sipping from red cups and looking at the fire or chatting. Not really very scary at all.
And so it was over. Just like that. Years of fear and fighting, profound loss, and always looking over his shoulder.
“If it weren’t for her …" he began. He cleared his throat. Merlin, he might get emotional. “I wouldn’t have Harry. Suffice to say … I owe her. A great deal.”
Harry shimmied out of his pyjama bottoms, then ran his fingers down his stomach, over his bollocks, and took his cock in hand, finally. He felt a burst of pleasure, flowing hotly through him. His toes curled. Images swam around in his mind. Malfoy with Terry. Dean’s tongue. The fantasy shower. The cock in his mouth. Pansy Parkinson on the desk. The way Terry Boot had
Draco decided not to comment further, and moved out of Harry's line of sight again—back to the closet. He tossed his button-up into the hamper, and grabbed a clean t-shirt from the shelf inside the closet, pulling it on.
They snogged, and Harry broke off to run kisses down Draco’s chin, and along his jawline, then down his neck. Harry licked and sucked at Draco’s neck, and it sent something through him... some electricity, some wondrous feeling.
With one more deep breath, Draco got moving. He wrapped around the side of the building, past the over-flowing bins and up towards the entranceway.
And then Harry found himself lying breathlessly on his back, with Malfoy pinning Harry’s wrists to the bed. Malfoy was breathing heavily, with dark eyes glaring down at Harry.
A slow smile grew on one side of Harry’s mouth. “So I was wondering if... will you officially be my boyfriend?”
“You look doubtful,” she continued, choosing her word's carefully, “but let’s think about it logically. Rationally. How could a man loving another man be wrong? What possible reason could there be?”
He opened his eyes and, carefully making sure to avoid looking at the mirror again, put on his soft pyjamas quickly.
Draco sucked his bottom lip into his mouth to gnaw at it. ‘Harry. I’ve wanted to kiss you for a very long time,’ he said in a breath.
Draco stared at him a beat. ‘Well, ah, goodnight, then. Or, do you need anything? Extra pillow or blankets or …'
Fingers flitted over his mangled skin carefully, and thunder crashed again. Closer. The rain picked up, beating harder against the window. Harry’s fingers grazed over the top of his arse, before moving back upwards.
‘Doubtful. I’m Harry Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding World, and all that. Or have you forgotten?’ He could do no wrong, as far as the general population was concerned. It was sort of annoying. But … sometimes it had its perks.
A warm hand brushed over Draco’s darkened skin. Over his lower back, he felt the startling shifts of soft hand passing over scar tissue to healthy skin and back to scar again. The healthy parts were electrified, breaking out in goose bumps from the gentle touch, and hairs stood on end. Draco had to suppress a shiver, so that he wouldn’t scare Harry off with any jerky movements.
‘For luck,’ Draco murmured, blushing furiously, before swinging around and hurrying back to the funeral, passing Harry’s bewildered friends, with hands stuffed deep in his pockets and head tilted down.
'Yes it does.' He glanced up at Harry. 'You should consider your next actions very carefully.' He worried his bottom lip, and some girls in matching leopard-print dresses noisily passed by them. 'Going to Muggle jail can't be very fun.'
The train would be departing soon. Harry closed the book and tucked it into his satchel. He picked up his plant, and pocketed his shrunken luggage, and made his way down.
“What’s this, Potter, passing notes in class?” Draco did his best to sneer. He looked down at the note—confirming what it was. That sodding awful sonnet. How did the ghost—Potter tried to grab it back, Draco dodged him.
Draco pushed the key into the keyhole and turned. It clicked and the door swung open to reveal his flat—just as it always was. His shoes were exactly where he'd left them on the mat, his coats on their hooks. He took a step inside, and shut the door softly behind himself.
They got up after dinner to stretch their legs, and walk around the property. It also served as a tour. Harry showed Draco the garden (which had a single gnome trying, and failing, to pull up a turnip), he showed him the pond with its tiny minnows and frogs, the apple orchard, the chicken coup, and the garage with all of Arthur’s Muggle artifacts.
bloody long. 'Let's do a round of introductions, shall we? Names, and what you're hoping to get out of this class.' She gestured towards one end of the class for them to start.
She cast her husband a quick glance, smirking at him. Then, she turned back to Harry, and said, “Thank you so much for my jumper, I absolutely
Draco opened his mouth and closed it. He could tell Potter that he’d enjoyed it, but that was pretty close to a confession of... well, affection. And, to put it frankly, he’d rather dance with a Blast-Ended Skrewt. Probably. He took one step closer to Potter’s bed, before remembering his near-nakedness. “You didn’t...” he started. He licked his bottom lip. “You didn’t annoy me. It’s fine. Nothing to apologise for.”
‘Yes,’ she said, thrusting a finger at his chest accusingly. ‘He’s very vulnerable these days. He’s been through a lot, you know? And you lot decide to play a trick on him—’
‘Our Mind Healer does one Saturday morning a month. So I thought I’d take a mental health weekend, of sorts. See her, stay in my flat for the weekend, that kind of thing.’
'Oh, uh, yeah. Of course,' he answered, tearing his gaze away from Draco, who was climbing onto a bench. Harry surveyed the table in front of himself, and grabbed a couple slices of toast, and scooped scrambled eggs onto his plate.
He exhaled. He didn’t know why he’d brought this up, but he found he didn’t really mind telling Harry. “Yes. Sleeping in the next room.”
It was then that he remembered the diary he'd bought. He shuffled to the end of his bed, and opened his trunk. He fished around, and his fingers caught on the thick spine. Pulling it out, he scooted back and sank down into his pillow, hugging it to his chest. What would he even write about? His life had been chock-full of death-defying adventures up until last May, but now it was just nothing. He had no goals, no missions, apart from graduating.
'Ah. Did she,' Draco said, looking around the room for the offending subject. He found her, across the room, chatting with Morgan. She could've at least warned him.
As she approached, a thought passed through his mind for a moment—that he could kiss her, it had been what he’d wanted for a long time, hadn’t it? She was single now, and so was he. So, he did. She’d leapt into his arms … and he brought their lips together, and … it wasn’t bad.
Harry turned to him. ‘Don’t you think two people can love each other their whole lives? And be happy together?’
Pansy bit at her lip—she wore dark purple lipstick today. It suited her. She was all contrast: pale skin, dark hair, dark clothes. Harry watched those big, heavily-lashed eyes flicker over to the Hufflepuff table again. Harry’s gaze followed hers and spotted Pansy’s Hufflepuff friend grinning at her, flashing a thumbs up.
Harry shot him a scandalised look. Draco winked and flew off to take a lap around the makeshift ‘pitch’. Harry couldn’t help check out his arse as he flew away. After all, those grey trousers were quite tight, really hugging the curves of Draco’s perky round arse …
The man whipped around, right in the middle of the hall, there. Visitors to the country, and citizens returning home alike, racing by him on either side.
Harry bit at his bottom lip with an incisor. “Ah …" he began, fumbling around in his coat pocket. “There was a part two to this. But I understand if you’d rather go back to Hogwarts.”
He had his shirt sleeve rolled up, resting on the table. His other arm supported his head, as he watched the tiny girl meticulously stick them on, with great care.
Potter could mean a number of things: either just like he sounds—he’s just going to have fun with his mates and might crash in whatever room they’re in, or, he’s got a girlfriend he’ll be shacking up with, or, he’s just not comfortable sleeping in the same room with Draco. Maybe a combination. Whatever the meaning, it made Draco feel a bit sad. A bit lonely.
Hermione shrugged. ‘Think about it. He'd been on the losing side of the war; he’d made poor choices and it nearly killed him and his family. Now he’s getting attacked by younger years, by kids? And Harry of all people, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, the person whom Malfoy once thought himself equal to, has to be the one to witness it? Has to come rushing in, ready to easily fix everything as always? It’s embarrassing. It’s a matter of pride.’
'No. I just want to put on comfy bottoms, sample the vending machine options, and watch a film. Unless you—'
The waiter came back with a paper bag full of their leftovers and a plate of tiramisu with two small spoons.
As if on cue, Potter sauntered over, with what looked like a fresh drink in hand. He squinted at Pansy, and Draco’s arm around her. “That’s my spot.”
He exhaled slow, and chastised himself for feeling jealous. Draco was the one who'd decided that it was for the best to keep a little distance between them, a healthy distance.
“Huh. Maybe Malfoy’s toned down his showiness. Or, could be the wife’s influence, I s’pose,” Ron commented.
“Fuck,” Draco mumbled. How had he not known? How did the whole bloody wizarding world not know? Little Harry Potter was kept in a cupboard? He pictured the scrawny little eleven-year-old he remembered, dressed in too-big clothes and those hideous taped-up glasses. That tiny boy with big eyes and knobby knees—had been abused. He’d had no idea...
They lay down eventually, and Draco rubbed small circles over Harry’s bare back. They talked, like they had the day before, about nothing really, about the possibility of an 8th year. And othertimes they were silent. Until it was time to go down for lunch.
Draco appeared to be in awe, staring wide-eyed at Harry. He took a deep breath, and seemed to come back into himself. ‘Harry, this has all been …
He stepped around the building to lean against the wall—just to the right of the entrance. He took a breath there, in order to think of his next move. He should … go back to the hotel, he supposed. Then Portkey back to London in the morning.
This definitely counted as meddling, he thought, as he took the soft, thick black hoodie from her. He chanced a glance at Potter, who was eyeing the telly with a very neutral expression.
Sighing, Draco muttered, 'Why are Muggles so needlessly complicated,' as he mirrored Harry's movement. The strap behaved this time, and he was able to click the metal bit into the clunky box-bit, just like Harry had done.
Harry huffed his protest, but his heart wasn't in it. 'All right, fair. What's your second favourite then? And don't say silver.'
“No thanks,” he said. Salazar, as if he would ever want to ask a teenager for advice on which vibrator to buy his wife. He turned and kept walking, until he found the shelf with the vibrators.
Draco's hand on Harry’s thigh stilled, and he looked down at his own lap. “Well you keep kissing my neck,” he said defensively. Anyone would be hard, with the sexiest-man-alive’s tongue on their neck.
“Can I—” Potter began, before clearing his throat. Without finishing his sentence, he plopped himself down beside Draco on his own pillow, with a blanket wrapped around his body, and bare legs. “Uh, what did I miss?”
Draco flashed him a tiny smile. ‘Yeah, well ...’ He turned to stare out at the water. ‘If I tell my parents that I want to marry a man … they will never speak to me again.’
Harry flopped down onto his bed bedside her, face down, and groaned. When he was done, he turned his head to the side. “I used to fancy Oliver Wood a bit. Cedric, maybe, too.” He sighed. “And Malfoy has—” he buried his face in the bed spread and mumbled something.
Harry’s mind was a blank; he blinked at her and tried to think. What could be done? Install security cameras? That probably wasn’t even possible, not to mention the privacy ramifications.
Harry shrugged. It meant nothing to him. No one had wronged him. His last relationship ended years ago, and it’d ended amicably. They’d just … wanted different things. Harry had been ready to settle down, maybe start a family. Dillon, well, he’d wanted to keep clubbing and enjoying his twenties. Last Harry had heard, he was still on the party scene in London.
“We have to un-learn what doesn’t work for us... and discover what does work.” Potter smiled, somewhat bashfully, and looked down at his nearly-cleared plate. “You had to un-learn some things. And... so did I.”
‘I didn’t, not really. But I was in touch with his family. They wanted to do something to … well, keep his memory alive.’
They were sort-of mid-level. Harry liked being mid-level—he liked being in the thick of it, immersed in the middle of the crowd. Hopefully Malfoy wouldn’t mind.
‘Um …’ he said, his eyes flashing over to the back of Malfoy’s blond head. He got ready to protest—but at that moment, Blaise Zabini parked himself down beside Malfoy. ‘Yeah, okay,’ he finished, disappointed.
Harry put the mug down, and started to rise to his feet, before he thought better of it and promptly sat right back down.
That was … rough and quick. Harry was confused, and really fucking hard, but … was that really the way people saw him? A selfish lover, a rough lover, someone who wouldn’t even kiss? He loved kissing. It made no sense to him.
Harry exhaled through his nose. Merlin, he felt so dull compared to Draco. ‘I have good students … I … enjoy teaching.’ He didn’t know what else he could say about it ...
—Oh God, had he really just been annoyed at a ghost for sending him lovely poems? Just because she was too young, and he didn’t know her at all? How self-absorbed could he get?
Draco stiffened. So, it was finally happening then, Draco thought to himself. They were going to have sex for the first time. He was going to have sex with his beautiful, perfect wife. His best friend.
“Oh, okay.” Harry found he was relieved. He wouldn’t have to miss another holiday with his best friends.
Oh! He recognised this song—it was Britney Spears, "...Baby One More Time." (He’d bought the album.)
'I definitely did, but I won't bring that topic up again. Besides, wizards aren’t in the habit of using televisions, so your cooking show would come with too many complications.' Draco smiled at him. 'Anyway, I'm getting hungry, how long will this be?'
Harry bit at his lip. ‘Okay. Well it doesn’t matter. What happened, happened. We only have the present. And you’re obviously different now anyway. You apologised to Hermione. You’ve been defending younger years in the halls. I saw you say “thank you” to a house elf. You have Muggle DVDs, and you’re hanging out with me, for fuck’s sake.’
They stood like that a while. For long enough that Harry thought it might never end—and found he felt pretty happy at the prospect. He eased into it, relaxed into it. His heart rate slowed down, close to a normal rate.
“Oh. That’s good,” Draco said, facing towards the fire, though Potter hadn’t really revealed anything. “I don’t know what she said... but I know she is rather drunk, so she isn’t exactly her usual self. Well, granted, she’s usually quite nosey, but tonight—tonight probably much worse.”
After their meal and a quick trip to the vending machine for giant armfuls of snacks, Harry wandered over by the television and picked up the funny plastic thing with all the buttons, and turned the thing on—idly flicking through it.
—crush. Something she shouldn’t have been able to discover, but Pansy was too perceptive for her own good. For his own good. And she’d thought she was doing Draco a
Hermione smiled softly. ‘Great. I’ll write her back.’ She took a sip of tea, before adding, ‘And Professor McGonagall mentioned the possibility of a special 8th year, for those of us who missed, or could not complete, our seventh.’
The waiting room door opened, and Ron, letting out a tired breath, stepped inside. Every set of eyes turned to him.
Harry sighed, and shoved a hand into his pocket, taking a sip of his drink with the other. He looked out at the outline of trees in the distance. Everything felt so …
Inexplicably, tears welled up in Harry’s eyes. In the back of his mind, he knew he’d have to make some choices eventually; he’d have to face the future. Maybe he’ll be an Auror like everyone expects. Marry a nice person, have kids. Carve out some sort of life and have it all documented in The Prophet ... his every move judged by the wizarding community.
Fingers were suddenly in a place they hadn't been a moment before—Draco's fingers were pushing into the space below Harry's bollocks, searching for Harry's arsehole. And, within seconds, they found it.
There was a flash of white-blond hair out of the corner of his eye. And Harry turned his head so fast his neck cracked. He rubbed it, as he spotted Draco, exiting, with a rucksack on as he pulled a wheeled suitcase. Draco looked around warily, and started off quickly towards the door nearest the taxi stands. He hadn’t seen Harry.
‘I thought you’d be too posh for that,’ he said in a way he hoped came across as friendly, rather than rude.
Draco's eyelids fluttered in the breathless span of a moment. Then he smiled, and leant in for another kiss, through his smiling lips, reaching around Harry's back to hold him close.
Draco whipped his head back around to stare at him. 'You are … going back, though, right?' He had to … that was
“Right … right …” He took a breath. “Harry Potter …" He paused, just staring at Harry's mouth. "I hope you don’t mind, but I've wanted to kiss you for a very long while."
‘I had no idea … the stars were so … And the Milky Way,’ Draco said, moving in a little circle to look up at it again.
"The smallest one, I suppose." He didn't plan to linger for too long. Besides, he'd already had a coffee this morning, and was very-nearly at his caffeine quota.
‘That’s nice,’ Harry said as his eyes scanned the paragraph on proper use of peppermint flower heads.
And Malfoy did, for a moment, for long enough that Harry could kiss his mouth softly. Gently. Slowly. So that he could run his fingers past those cheeks, over shells of ears, and lace them into silken white-blond strands. So that he could pull his mouth away, and have their slackened lips hover—just a fraction apart—so that he could bring them back together, and feel their softness. To revel in that softness.
Blinking rapidly, Draco let himself be ushered by this perfect stranger. She parked him over by the wall to the left of the stage with a group of girls. Her friends, he figured.
He went inside, locking the door quietly after himself. Harry went to the bedroom, stripped off all his nice clothes, and went for a long, hot shower. Afterwards, in bed, Harry found he couldn’t sleep for a long, long time. He stared up at his ceiling in the dark, remembering the way the stars had looked at the wedding. Wondering if Malfoy was with Astoria underneath that same sky, still dancing and laughing.
Draco laughed again. 'Well okay. That's ... good?’ He leant back and held onto his crossed legs. ‘I never thought I'd be talking to Harry Potter about his gay sex life.'
So, out loud, he sang softly, ‘’Cause to lose all my senses, that is just so typically me. Oh baby, baby—’ And louder, ‘Oops I did it again, I played with your heart, got lost in the game. Ooh baby, baby.’
Draco snorted. “This is the worst one yet,” he whispered, feeling a heat rise in his cheeks. Sod it all, he’d made himself blush. Pathetic.
Hermione and Ron were already in the library, sat at a table with a pile of books in front of them. Hermione had her head ducked low, busy scribbling notes, while Ron sat beside her, staring off in the distance, twirling a quill. Harry came up behind them and threw his arms around their shoulders, into a hug.
He puffed out his cheeks, and stared out at the dark water. ‘I wanted to keep you out of it. I wanted you to leave Hogwarts behind, and not have to see … I was angry with you, and I was ashamed. So I …'
The game started. The Snitch was released, and Harry caught a glint of it before it disappeared. The other players flew around, throwing the Quaffle, hitting Bludgers. But Harry’s eyes scanned for that flash of gold.
Draco exhaled, slow, staring at the words. “You’re so thoughtful, Harry. So unbelievably thoughtful. And wonderful, and fit, and... Merlin, I could list off dozens of compliments, and I could go on wondering how I could ever deserve you as a boyfriend... I just...”
“Doesn’t feel like it,” Harry quipped good-naturedly. They’d certainly all been through their fair share of hardship in their supposed ‘young’ lives. He had to count for at least 40 by now, with all he’d been through. It certainly felt like it, anyhow. “Drinks?”
“As much fun as one can have with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, I suppose. It was okay. I got a bit drunk.” She sighed. “I should’ve come get you.”
Astoria looked thoughtful, returning to petting at his hair absentmindedly. "I'm not sure. I'll let you know what I decide?"
Harry found himself gaping at the page, at a loss for what to do. He had not felt this worked-up in a while. It was frustrating, maddening, to want to help someone and to be in a position to help them, only to be shot down. Well, he was going to do something anyway, he thought to himself stubbornly.
He didn't know what to do about this, about any of it. How did their relationship become so damaged, without him even noticing?
“Should we, I don’t know, do that stuff first then, so we can concentrate later? That is, if you want? It’s just a thought, though.”
‘This is … quite different from the way you grew up, isn’t it?’ Harry hoped he’d worded that neutrally-enough.
Harry had to suppress a groan—since he suspected it wouldn’t go over well. “I seriously doubt it, Septima.” She hated when he used her given name, even though Harry wasn’t a child anymore and they were both professors now, and proper
“I see.” Malfoy sighed, and opened the door wider. “Come in, I’ll have to change into something Muggle.”
. Maybe it was because he’d never been touched as a child—never hugged. He’d have to remind himself that he’d been hugging Molly too long, or Hermione too long. Or that he’d kept his hand too long on Ron’s back, too long to be considered normal.
The hoodie was a little large on him, and felt so warm. Draco never wanted to take it off. It was so
Harry already had a bag in hand, and was leaning against the counter, smiling cheekily at him. Draco rolled his eyes in response, laying his choices down on the countertop.
‘I was in China, just after the massive earthquake last year. A building had taken structural damage and it fell on me—just a case of wrong place, wrong time. It came down onto me, crushing my leg pretty bad.’ Harry’s eye darted to the right leg, the one that made Draco limp as he walked. ‘I’d sustained some internal damage as well, along with an infection that spread rapidly. So, as I said, I’d nearly died. In a small rural hospital in China. Alone.’
“I didn’t—” he started to say, too quiet to reach Malfoy’s ears through the door, probably. He sighed again. What was he supposed to do, shout that Professor Vector was a paranoid arsehole through the door? Shout that Harry didn’t think Malfoy was a criminal through the door? It was ridiculous. All of this was. And he had a lesson plan to write, and twenty papers to mark.
Harry looked at Malfoy for a moment, properly looked. And he seemed tense, but as if he was trying to hide it. “Will you go on a date with me?”
Neville came over to speak to Harry about some plant that he was studying, growing in the greenhouse now under Professor Sprout’s careful supervision. Harry spaced out a bit, absorbing the calm atmosphere, just letting Neville talk. As always, Harry just didn’t care about plants.
Nodding, Harry said, ‘I’ve given it much thought. And I would very much like to be with you, Draco.’
“It isn’t your average party. It’s not somebody’s room, where they’d all turn around to see who’d just walked through the door,” she continued, boring holes into him with her unblinking stare. “It’s going to be dark. It’s going to be relaxed. We are going to toast marshmallows, and you are going to enjoy it. If you get uncomfortable, you can sneak away in the dark without anyone noticing. You. Are. Going.”
“Ah.” Malfoy swirled his pasta around with a fork, and then put a piece of gnocchi in his mouth. They were definitely slowing down. Harry was getting so full … so pleasantly full.
Malfoy laughed, proper laughed. He’d never done that before with Harry. Harry … quite liked it. “Maybe a few people.”
Reminding himself to breathe, he took a breath. Draco's heart was in his throat. 'And to what do we, the general British population, owe the pleasure?'
Harry just stared at him in befuddlement—aghast at how impossibly calm and collected the man could look after that. Like he hadn’t just suddenly kissed his childhood arch-nemesis out of seemingly nowhere.
So, he did. Or tried to. And once he'd finished his retelling, he decided that was it. He was done with Ibiza, and its beautiful beaches, and he was done with bright green eyes, sun-kissed bronze skin, and sipping cold tea drinks from a plastic straw. It was back to reality now. Harry Potter had his life, in Ibiza, and Draco had his, in London. It didn't do to dwell on an impossibility.
Draco spotted Harry, sat on his towel, with purple camera in hand, and a cheeky smile on his face. Draco shook his head, but he smiled—couldn't help it.
A glittery holiday display caught Harry's eye as he was about to walk by. He stopped in his tracks, content to take his time getting home this evening. After all, it wasn’t like he was going home to anyone. There were mannequins in the window, in the ugliest holiday jumpers he’d ever seen, arranged around a coloured-paper fireplace, with a little dog mannequin in a similar outfit. All around them, were twinkling fairy lights. Harry smiled, feeling a pang in his chest. He wanted this, someday. He wanted a family—he wanted ugly jumpers and a shaggy dog or a crup. Sod it, he was getting sentimental from a fucking display of plastic people.
After a few long moments, when the chatter from the funeral became a distant buzz, replaced by the soothing sounds of the lake lapping against the shore, and Harry felt he could
The spray of the shower stopped, and Harry heard some shuffling in there, some things being moved around.
His own eyes looked bright and wide staring back at him. He did have tiny salty marks on his cheeks, from... from the tears.  He scraped at them with a fingernail. Thankfully he wasn’t red or puffy, at least.
Harry laughed. The word ‘date’ did something to him. Got his heartrate speeding. “Yes. Should we talk about Quidditch now or something?”
Harry shut his book, and tried looking out the window instead. Just watching the endless plains of green go by. After a while, he got up to walk, to stretch his legs.
Draco shifted his whole body closer, pressing the full length of himself into Harry. And it nearly took Harry's breath away. His body was so solid, with only thin pyjama material between them—so Harry could feel his body heat, the rise and fall of his breaths. Every bony part and every soft part. It was already sending Harry's blood pumping.
A slow smile formed on Harry's mouth. 'Works perfectly.' The smile turned to a grin, a grin he tried to bite back. 'Brilliantly.'
The hallways were narrow, barren, and silent. His trainers padding against the floors were the only sounds. It was a lonely feeling.
Draco smiled, a sad, soft smile, and squinted out at the swaying grass. ‘Perhaps I’m not as posh as I was. Perhaps I stopped being so posh when I was stuck in one room with Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs for the better part of a year.’
'Which is out of my house. Anyway, how's the Clubhouse?' He tossed Draco a glance. 'Dave runs a LGBTQ+ drop-in program for youth.'
Harry looked up in time, in front of the Professor’s table, to see the flash of a pink sphere fly through the air, from Vector’s gloved hand. And Malfoy, with his Seeker’s reflexes, who caught the object in his bare hand.
'You said you love me last night,' Harry marvelled aloud. It filled his chest with warmth, like a little burning fire inside him.
“Can we take the rest to go please?” Malfoy asked. His mouth was pinched, and he hadn’t even tried to say any of that in Italian.
Morgan rose to her feet, and spun to the door. She shot him one last cheerful smile, and said, 'Enjoy your class tomorrow,' before leaving his office.
He didn’t know this one. But … Potter did. And whatever weird mood Potter’d just been in clearly melted away. Because Potter was
Voldemort set the Sorting Hat aflame atop Neville’s head, and Grawp stormed in, the centaurs stampeded, and chaos ignited amongst the crowd. It was the perfect cover for Harry to pull on his Invisibility cloak.
,’ she said wearily. ‘And, no, you’d need an internet connection to watch your unrequited love’s videos.’
Dave clapped Ruben on the shoulder. 'No need to get territorial, honey. I'm sure Draco's very nice.' Dave met his eye, and winked.
He shook his head. No, he couldn’t possibly wait, not one more moment. “No.” And Harry pressed his lips hard against Malfoy's. God … why hadn’t they kissed way earlier? He really liked kissing Draco Malfoy.
'Yes,' Draco said slowly, feeling unease swirl up in his stomach. Surely his father was a difficult topic for them. He wasn't sure if he should say more, or let the topic of his father's bigotry drop. They both knew it, after all …
Draco sighed. ‘Well, I used to fancy myself in love with Blaise. We were 6, and I got the idea to play
Malfoy shrugged. “Without someone tethering me to the world of the living, I’d’ve been sucked into the afterlife.”
Harry shrugged, sheepishly. “I felt like kissing him.” He shrugged again. “I asked first, he said it was alright.”
“Love, I’m going to order wine and snacks and we’re simply going to be together tonight, all right?”
So, no magic and stuck in a room alone with Harry Potter—It was already shaping up to be a shit holiday. He must get out of it. He’s sick—he needs—
Okay … he wouldn’t ... Draco shut his eyes, and went back to dancing. ‘Oops you, think that I’m sent from a-bo-o-o-ve. I’m not that innocent.’
He stopped in his tracks, as if it were automatic. Malfoy had said his name like the pearl had. Soft. Fond.
The hand had dropped awkwardly to Draco’s side. His eyelids lowered and his mouth pressed into a firm line. Then, Draco had said, ‘Thank you.’
Later, Harry found himself talking to Blaise Zabini. The drink was starting to make him feel warm, and a little light-headed. Could Blaise be his journal-mate? The idea intrigued him. Admittedly, he didn’t know much about the man—wasn't sure they’d ever had a real conversation before. He was rather handsome, Harry could privately admit to himself.
Draco opened it—his mouth—as if about to say something, but no sounds came out. (What could he possibly even
His cock was hard and aching to be touched, dripping with pre-ejaculate, as he tried to grind his arse back against Draco’s wet mouth.
It certainly was surreal, yes. And Harry wanted to dive in, head-first, and see where these feelings would take them.
Draco took it as a sign to go—turning on his heel and marching right on out of the Hall. He’d had enough confessions for one day.
Harry dared to look at Draco then, and the man just looked back at him with bright eyes and a soft smile.
Draco sighed and rubbed his eyes. Then, he found himself eyeing the telly. He’d never used one before, and wasn’t sure if he could operate it properly, but it could be interesting to try.
Harry groaned into his hands. Did that sound pathetic? Did he sound like a lovesick fool—tangled in an unrequited situation of his own design?
The slam made his heartrate pick up. But it was nothing—just from the loud noise, likely. The room felt off and a bit too quiet after her leaving.
And Harry’s reaction was not what Harry would have expected from himself. Thin pink lines of raised flesh remained from the curse, but his body seemed solid, put-together. Mostly healed. Malfoy’s torso was as pale as the rest of him, and his body lean but muscular, from years of Quidditch. His nipples were almost obscene, pink and pebbled right there on his chest. Malfoy’s nipples. He’d never thought of Malfoy having nipples, though obviously he would have them ... Not to mention the trail of white-blond hairs that started at that little innie-bellybutton and travelled downwards underneath the blanket …
Until the front door creaked open and Hermione walked over to them, with two steaming mugs in one hand, and a plate of sandwiches in the other. Her hair was frizzy and escaping from her hair tie on the sides. The darkness under her eyes betrayed her tiredness. Though, Harry supposed they were all exhausted.
Draco’s eyes fell to his book on the table, which he’d forgotten all about. “A Clash of Kings. By George R. R. Martin.” He looked back up at Potter. “It’s about kings, wars, magic, dragons, and the like.”
Alas, those were breasts. Round, fleshy things. Nipples in the centres. Useful for feeding one’s infant.
‘Sometimes. But Draco was kind to us. He brought tea and biscuits and talked with us. He tried to reassure us, that you were going to defeat Voldemort soon and we’d all be free again.’
“You’re a Gryffindor and you’re Harry Potter. You ride Hippogriffs, play Quidditch, and rescue dragons from banks—”
. I should’ve …' Harry babbled, staring at Malfoy wide-eyed. How could he have been so careless? Of course that would be something difficult for Malfoy, his friend had died that day.
‘I think we should wait a bit before we tell anyone about us. Is that okay? It’s just … I only just, well, pretty much rejected Ginny last night …'
'All right, all right,' he mumbled, pulling the door open to find a rather rumpled-looking Harry Potter with his fist posed to knock more. 'All right, already.'
'Pfft.' Pansy smacked his arm. 'Don't be so dramatic, darling.' She looked around. 'So, where is he?'
That was yet another strange thing for Harry to try to wrap his head around. ‘Well, congratulations,’ Harry said, blinking dumbly at her.
Harry laughed under his breath. 'Ah well, perhaps one day.' He squinted out at the water, then unhooked the sunglasses from the lip of his t-shirt, exchanging them with the regular ones on his face. These were the mirrored kind, with gold wire rims. 'Just a fair warning—clothing is generally considered optional on this island, and some do take advantage of that.'
“He neglected to continue any of the topics we were discussing before. The note was very … cold. Abrupt.”
Draco pushed up on his elbows, and watched Harry walk into the water—his black curls ruffled by a slight breeze, the muscles of his back shifting with every step … and that fantastic perky little arse.
Ah. And there they were, back at Hogwarts, back in the courtyard. When he’d left it, he’d been a bit of a mess, to be honest with himself. Lonely, depressed, and self-isolating. Now... now he was coming back after having been to a party. And, most importantly, he’d come back with Harry Potter as his boyfriend. It still seemed surreal. Granted, it’d only been a few hours official.
Then the players left the pitch, and the crowds started to disperse with the noise lulling into more of a background buzzing.
Harry smiled, but he was distracted. He walked on past them all, out the portrait, and made his way to the library. He may as well start on that Potions essay due Monday, since there was still a little time before lunch.
The sun was setting behind Harry’s back as he walked, casting the sky—and everything below it—in burnt orange.
So, there he was, on the busy platform with trunk in hand, ready (more or less) for his final year. Harry gripped the handle a bit too tightly, and had to try to will himself to relax.
“Hold on a second,” he said to his Seventh Year class. They all lowered their wands, talking amongst themselves in hushed voices, casting curious looks at Harry.
A soft breeze ruffled his hair, and it felt rather nice. He wondered if he might keep his hair natural like this. Slicked-back was pre-war Draco’s style—harsh and aristocratic. And he wasn’t like that anymore.
A surprised laugh burst out of Harry, causing Draco to frown, and turn a darker shade of red—but he'd laughed because that'd been such an endearing way to put it. 'You think I'm some Casanova or some bollocks?' he said, forcing his voice to be gentle, so Draco would know he wasn't trying to tease him. 'Not at all. Okay—granted—yes, I've had sex before. But you may've noticed that I've been pretty busy in recent years, so everything has been hurried and definitely clumsy, and sometimes not very good. So, don't worry about it, honestly. I
Harry had friends here though: Dave, Ruben, Dimitri. The DJ bloke from the first night. Surely any of them would be better equipped to comfort Harry if he needed it.
Harry looked at him now, really looked. There was a desperation there, an anxiety in Malfoy’s demeanor. All rigid posture and wide, wild eyes. The white-blond strands of his hair fluttered in the soft breeze. ‘I know you didn’t kill Dumbledore. I was there. When it happened.’ He blinked at Malfoy. ‘You thought I would think you killed him?’
Harry was rather distracted by the sudden touch, enough so that the words took their time sinking in. ‘Er, oh. Okay.’
"Let's just—roll them onto their sides so it looks like they're asleep, and we need only look at their backs."
"Yes, that reminds me," Draco said, half standing and peering around the room. "Where's my bag? I need you to sign the papers that will add you to the deed."
“You’re asking me to imagine the sky is pink,” Malfoy said, but then he closed his eyes and smiled. “I’m imagining a pink sky.”
"What?" Draco asked, standing and making his way to the kitchen. He opened the cabinet with the cheese charms—evidently he thought cheese was the appropriate way to celebrate a birth. "Do you fancy a white Stilton?"
Draco sighs and closes his eyes, but he can feel that he’s smiling as Harry sits on his lap and presses a kiss to his cheek, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders and squeezing him tight.
Harry groans. "Ugh, I hate Richard Blackwood. What a chump." He waves his wand to send the cold items into the fridge, then walks over and sits on the armrest of the sofa by Draco.
it, did you say?  No, I’d rather say not.  [He glances off to the side searchingly, before looking back at the camera.]  Sorry – what was the second part?
In the end, the team that had been first for most of the race dropped to third, and the rest stumbled across the finish line in due time.  Some looked exhilarated, some disappointed, but all of them were huffing and tired – and that, Draco figured, was what was important as a flight instructor: tiring out the first-years so they wouldn’t get up to much trouble.
The jibe did wonders in curtailing Harry’s dangerously sappy expression, and he closed the door behind Draco with a scowl.  That was fine.
?!” Malfoy spluttered, backpedaling a step and unbalancing when Harry held firm to their interlaced grip.  And really, that was rich, because Harry was just answering
Guilt crushed at his lungs, and the fact that Potter was defending him now suddenly seemed too much to bear.  Not to mention the niggling doubt that this feeling wasn’t only guilt.  Deep beneath his layers of defensiveness and pride, a part of him held an awed, aching tenderness for this man who was testifying for him.  It was unwarranted and pitiful and, frankly,
Draco saw the moment Harry looked up and noticed his company.  His eyes widened, he paused comically mid-step, frozen by the unexpected scene in front of him.
“Mother?” he gasped as soon as he opened the door.  Because there she was – blue robes tidy and distinguished, a deceivingly neutral smile floating about her face.
He caught Harry’s face again and pinned him with a look.  “And you never answered the second half of my question.  In what ‘
And so, he got to thinking.  If the “him” that he’d fought so hard to bring into the world was still unhappy, maybe Father was right about him after all.
.  Then, she laughed again, crinkling her brow at his expression, and he sagged forward onto the table once more.
to you, and by hopelessly pursuing my enemy, you’re attempting to make a fool of me!  ‘Oh, look – there’s Lucius’ son,’ they’ll say, ‘running headlong into the wake of Harry Potter’s press.  How low the Malfoys have stooped!  Their line has produced only felons and
Harry offered a small smile, pulling them together into a hug.  “You’re a mess, I’m a mess – we deserve each other.”
He ran through several snappy comebacks in his head until he landed on one that was half-joke, half-truth.  He couldn’t bear to be flippant after everything – not fully, at least.  “When it comes to beating you, I’m never satisfied.”
“I’m really not the one you should be singing about – honestly.  Everyone will think you’re behind on the rumors.”
He was annoyed, but he also couldn’t argue with her.  If they pushed back the release of their wands, Draco wasn’t sure he could will himself to survive until then.
His hand twitched towards his wand, and Draco acted instinctively.  He disarmed Potter with a wordless incantation, marveling, as the famed holly wand sung across the grass, just how easy it had been.
Why was he being so agreeable about this?  Draco hadn’t wanted a fight, but he found this easy acceptance grated on his nerves just as much.  Did Harry even
“Yes – who better for the job?  A capable, energetic teacher like yourself would be perfect to guide the children through the Ball!  And there’s been quite a hubbub about your flying classes already.”
, because every time I think we’re getting somewhere, you pull away and give me that same, clueless look like I’ve gone and imagined it all.  I’m
At the end of their meal, Harry had injured his pride a bit by insisting on paying for everything – which Draco wouldn’t have allowed, if the Gryffindor hadn’t resorted to emotional blackmail.
It was infuriating.  Made more so, even, because Draco was unwilling to divulge his actual feelings in front of his father.  Thus, it became an impasse.
The man ran a hand through his hair, making it stick up even further.  “It made sense in the moment.  I don’t know.”
After a tense moment of silence, Draco raised an impatient brow.  “Yes?  Can I help you, gentlemen?”
Harry clenched the quill harder in his grip, a muscle in his forehead twitching as he suffered Draco’s incessant teasing.  “Get it yourself, Malfoy.  I’m busy here.”
Draco’s skin prickled as all eyes in the shop turned to them.  Before, they’d been noticed, sure, but not by

“Would you?” Potter asked suddenly, unable or unwilling to read Draco’s urge to run.  “Would you change it if you could?”
“Oh, um, Harry Potter,” he said with a sheepish smile, like it was ridiculous to have him say his name to a crowd who all knew him as
[Cut to a montage of bread rising, bread deflating, and bread being cut into warm, thick slabs.  In the corner, it reads, ‘Week 4: Bread.’  The camera focuses on eccentric TV personality and bread specialist, SIRIUS BLACK, as he kneads his dough with a certain winsome flair.  Behind him, SEVERUS works methodically and glaringly – even the most unaware of audience members can tell that there is bad blood between the two professors from Hogwarts Culinary.  SNAPE snaps his dough on the table with a thwack, taking on the most violent of the bread-kneading techniques as if it’s his new religion.]
Despite the pain, he had moved his stuff into his room at Hogwarts this morning, marveling at the bittersweet nostalgia he felt for being back within the castle walls.  McGonagall had given him a suite in the dungeons, and he hadn’t decided whether it was to make him comfortable in a familiar setting or if she thought he ought not be anywhere else.
Draco let himself smirk, enjoying the way Harry continued to wriggle in his grasp – this time, not trying to get
After several hours of furious grading, Harry had taken a break to inquire about the results of Draco’s potions experiment with Granger – which Draco had made the mistake of answering honestly, as it had gotten him into his current predicament.
Harry nodded, overcome with bliss. Draco wrapped his thicc lips around Harry’s wide cock tip and sucked it clean.
I did it?”  He leaned closer, forcing his eyes to stay locked on Potter’s, lest they drop traitorously to his lips.  He meant to say something clever, something scathing, like he was usually so capable of.
He dropped low to the pitch, ignoring the jeers and boos of the opposing fans below.  They were immaterial; he’d grown used to them.  He slid forward, slowly, waiting for the glimmer of gold to catch his eye.
It’s all in there, too – same premise as with lads.  Or, mostly, I imagine.  Now that I think about it, maybe they
“There’s no match tonight,” Draco responded, voice tight.  He looked as far as he could in his peripherals without turning; there were several men shifting behind him now.
He watched the other men grab their brooms from the sidelines and wandered over, giving them a wide berth.
Malfoy murmured something that sounded alarmingly like “I don’t think you ever stopped.”  But then he brushed it away in an instant with, “Anyway, math?  Really?”
But even without looking, he could feel that he was hard – harder than he had any right to be while thinking of a colleague and boyhood rival.  He bit his lip, weighing his options.
“Are we really doing this right now?” Malfoy asked, after Harry pulled him into a sequence of just-passable steps that he had only seen before in movies.  His voice sounded resigned and wary, and though he’d stopped fighting every movement Harry made, his body was still unbearably tense.  He wished Malfoy would relax a little, so they could—
was to not let himself think too deeply about his answers, lest he find anxieties that would throw off his reaction or complicate his answers.
with some ‘family additions’ to the recipes instead of writing anything new or delving into the alchemical processes of the brewing,” she was saying.
No.  He would not accept Potter’s play at pity, and he would not talk to him either until he’d wiped that false passivity from his face.  He would engage with Draco as equals, or simply not at all.
He was about to open his mouth to apologize, when Harry beat him to the punch.  “Right.  We aren’t, are we?  My mistake.”
But rather than relief, he felt like he’d been lit up from head to toe; his nerves sparked to life and danced at the possibilities that were suddenly open to him.
.  We both know I was there in the thick of it…just on the wrong side.”  He swallowed, trying to tamp down the fear in his throat.  “And if your feelings about…about
Draco hadn’t finished the first time they had sex.  The second time, he had; the third time, he hadn’t; and by the fourth or fifth time, he’d learned enough about losing himself in the sensation to come at the appropriate moment.
And so, Draco had done what he did best – he had closed off his mind and told Potter off in his coldest, most detached voice.  It didn’t matter if he regretted it – even as it was happening – it was done, and that was that.
[CEDRIC is engulfed by a sea of friends, family, and admirers, and he chats jovially with all of them, before turning to kiss Cho on the cheek.  The scene cuts to an interview montage where former contestants place their bets on who will win.]
His gaze was searching.  But whatever he was looking for, he seemed to find it, as he slumped against Draco’s collarbone a second later.  Draco allowed his hovering hands to settle featherlight against Harry’s back and rub gentle lines from neck to shoulder blade, marveling at just how
“She let us duke it out before dinner, through which she laid down her expectations of mutual compromise.”
[HARRY’s hand reaches out and grabs the pot of remaining cream.  In an angry, flourishing slash, he sprays DRACO directly in the face – and half the classroom as well.  DRACO sputters in nameless horror.]
The third teammate would then catch it – like the group currently leading was doing now.  A raincloud immediately coalesced above the holder’s head, and he frowned magnificently before taking off towards the starting point.
”  She skidded to a stop in front of Draco, who was, at the current moment, affixing a zombie hand to the wall.
After several minutes of fussing with the cuffs unnecessarily, he drew the emerald cufflinks out and slid his shirt from his shoulders.  He folded it with a neat charm – stalling yet again – and turned back with a small smirk that died when he saw Harry eyeing his Mark.
He kneaded what must’ve been a particularly sore spot, because Harry’s muscles jumped under his hands.
“Draco,” his mother responded, rising to wrap him in her customary embrace.  He endured it, preferring this to his father’s customary disappointment.
He busied his hands pouring out a firewhisky for each of them, keeping his voice carefully controlled as he muttered, “That’s rotten luck.”
Draco swallowed then drew his wand up Harry’s collarbone.  He slid it higher and higher until it came to rest just under his chin, tilting his head up slightly to look at him.  “Is this what you want, Harry?” he whispered, half aroused, half scared of the answer.
He heaved a sigh, stalking across the lawn and hoping the September breeze would wash the heat from his face.  It wouldn’t do for his students to see him like this.
Marla glanced up at him, wide-eyed.  “No!  I mean, maybe?  I don’t know.  I just…I want to be different than the way I am now.  I don’t know about the rest, though.”
This line of questioning made him uncomfortable, which he’d learned usually made it something worth revisiting.  It was part of his self-made mission of change, and he’d have to give himself the opportunity to parse it out when he could.
[Cut to shaky point-of-view footage from the waist pocket of HARRY’s apron.  The camera flashes over a classroom full of students, all whisking pots of cream on the stove.  It lingers on DRACO for a moment – two benches away – before wheeling around to view the edge of HARRY’s own station.  His hands come into view as he whisks his own mixture.]
Shit – this was where she told him he was too irresponsible to ever play ‘Head of House’ again.  Too irresponsible to be a teacher, maybe.  Or, possibly, that the latest articles were just more attention than she was willing to tolerate him drawing to their staff.
“Harry?  What is it?”  He tried to stay as neutral as he possibly could, but it was hard, knowing what was coming.  It was only as Harry’s eyes roved up and down that he realized what a mess he must be.
…there are flourishes here that are your own, and they transcend the work you’ve brought us thus far – good job.  [He cuts a piece with his talon-like nail, forgoing the proffered knife.]  Yes, very crisp; a good hint of clove.
He wavered, considering shrugging her off and leaving anyway, despite knowing how much it would hurt her.  In the end, he pulled his hand from the basket of Floo powder on the mantel and turned around to face her.
Without thinking, Draco slammed his hands to the wall on either side of him, caging Potter in.  Making Potter
He felt his eyes widening throughout the fervid rant, and at the end of it, realization dawned clear and amusing in his mind.  “Professor… Are you scared?”
on a date, and then snatching up Draco’s hand to present their unity to the crowd.  It was ridiculous, even by
He slid into a seat at the far end of the bar and thanked his lucky stars that the place was lit dimly to hide unsavory characters like himself.  After a moment or two, he was noticed by the bartender – a harried-looking woman in her forties – whose face flickered with recognition, but thankfully nothing more; she took his order discreetly and slid a firewhisky across the counter without a word.
“Oh, spare me,” Harry grumbled, but if his smile of relief was anything to go by, he would let Draco say whatever he wanted.  It would be a pain, wasting his talents on a Weasley, but Draco supposed that, if it helped Harry, he would do most anything.
The man’s great chin wobbled as he came to a stop beside Draco and caught his breath.  “I was hoping…you’d have a minute…to discuss something-”  His averted eyes fell unsubtly on the door to Draco’s room.
It was a long moment before the man seemed to remember he was teaching and spoke again.  “First, we bow.”  Potter dipped his head hesitantly, eyes never leaving his, and so Draco let his own head drop into the respectful obeisance he had never granted Potter before.
The boy nodded hesitantly, and Draco sighed again.  “That’s probably your issue – this thing is ancient.”
Draco’s heart tripped in his chest when Potter called him by his given name.  He wasn’t sure he had ever heard it from him before.
Then it rushed back into motion.  Hysterical laughter bubbled in his throat.  To his side, he could hear it rumbling from Potter as well.
“Please?”  Harry’s eyes grew impossibly wide with entreaty, and Draco would’ve missed the twinkle of mischief if he hadn’t been trained to look.
He smiled wryly, wondering what he had done to deserve such trust and admiration in his students.  “I’m sure I’ll manage.  And I still have time – get Max to come back and switch with me in another half an hour.”
Harry slumped, burying his face in his hands. It was worse than he could’ve imagined. ‘How far have you gotten?’
The ceremony location was set on a hilly stretch of land under a bright sky. Untouched, sparkling snow spread out over the ground in all directions, save the area for the guests to walk on—covered in a soft blue velvet carpet. Charmed to stay dry and clean, no doubt.
He stood up, scrambled around the coffee table, and even grabbed a handful of Floo powder, when a voice stopped him.
“After all these years, eh?” Ron asked, and made a humming sound. “Guess I can’t call him names in front of you anymore.”
The house elf bowed, beaming, while squeaking, ‘You’re most welcome,’ before disappearing back into a kitchen nook or cranny someplace.
Malfoy’s eyes were so intense, and aroused. Harry almost got lost in them, until he felt the pressure against his arsehole. Malfoy’s … Malfoy’s cock.
Draco sighed. ‘I was taught to hate them, yes. When I realised my father was wrong about Voldemort, I wondered what else he’d been wrong about. After actually meeting Muggles—and living as a Muggle—I discovered quickly how mistaken I'd been.’ He exhaled slowly, casting short glances at Harry. ‘Hating someone for not having magic, is like hating someone for not being able to play the piano. Or speak French. It’d be foolish, really.’
Malfoy laughed—breathily and not particularly happily. “See? You’ve still got the unfailing ability to see the best in things, the best in people. You’re a nice person.”
‘It’s so messy. You should see the dishes in the sink, or the soap build-up in the shower. It’s all really, really dirty.’
'Harry …' Draco dropped Harry's hand on his chest, and instead reached for Harry's shoulder, bringing him into a tight embrace. 'Harry,' he said again.
So Pansy Parkinson went up on her tiptoes, wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck. She smelled of raspberries and felt small in his arms. It was a good hug—a tight one.
It was a bit uncomfortable having Hermione and Ron touching tongues together in front of him as well, it was sort of like how he’d imagine seeing one’s parents making out to be. On the one hand, he was happy for them, but he didn’t particularly want to be an arms-length away from it.
Another laugh burst out of Draco. Good Lord. ‘He was immensely annoyed, yes.’ Draco could practically see his father suppress his eyes from rolling, saying, with tight lips, “You’ve told me this at least a dozen times already.” The memory sobered Draco. All those years ago … And now, his father was long-passed, and Draco was a middle-aged widower with a grown-up, now married, son. Where had all the time gone?
With a minute to spare, he grabbed the half-full bag of dried mulberries, since Draco had said he could have it, and pulled the Portkey out of his pocket. It was just a small metal bell.
“This won’t do, this won’t do,” she muttered to herself. “Hmm...” She pulled out a pair of black jeans. “Wear these.” She tossed them over.
Her eyes widened slightly. “A woman,” she finished for him. It wasn’t a question. How could she be so perceptive?
Draco's heart was really beating hard now, but he wasn't really bothered. The alcohol in his system was telling him not to overthink it.
‘It’s brilliant, isn’t it?’ asked Ginny, leaning forward and looking at each of their faces in turn. ‘Who wants to start a pool, betting on how long before they’re dating?’
“Oh,” she said breathily. “You could’ve told me, you know.” Astoria laid her hand gently on his arm. “You can tell me anything, because I love you—and I'm going to love you no matter what. You know that, don’t you?”
‘Don’t mention it,’ Draco answered, tossing a smirk over his shoulder at Harry. ‘Now, shall we play Quidditch?’
'You can stay here, if you want, you know,' Draco said, unbuttoning his trousers next. 'While you're in London. How long are you staying, anyhow? You still have "gigs" every Friday night, don't you?' He pulled on a pair of grey joggers. There, he was comfortable.
Ah. The blanket fell off his chest. He was shirtless. Hmm. He lifted the blanket up off his lap, and saw he was wearing yesterday pants. Well, at least he hadn't answered the door starkers.
But the faces that greeted them were cheerful. Harry exhaled hard, looking from face to face for a clue. Arthur spotted him looking, and beckoned him over.
Draco eyed him thoughtfully. ‘You really don’t like the fame, then? I’d always thought you were pretending not to like it. But you really don’t?’
When Harry was satisfied he had everything he needed, he stuffed it all into cloth grocery bags, and they hauled them back to Draco’s.
. All this talk about him, but ... “You know, if you wanted to seek physical … ah, satisfaction elsewhere, that would be … acceptable.”
The edge of Draco’s mouth lifted up slightly. ‘Well … thank you for trying to make me feel better.’ He turned to face Harry straight on, and bit at his lip. ‘I do, I do feel better. I wish I could forget things like that, though, you see? I wish I didn’t have to keep re-living it.’
Potter grunted, but lifted himself off the log anyway, taking his burnt marshmallow with him. Halfway, he turned around and shot Draco an apologetic smile, which was altogether unnecessary, but... nice.
Potter moved forward, towards a window at the far end, and placed his suitcase down. Then he flopped onto the far bed, on his back, frowning up at the ceiling.
She gave him a more thorough once-over, and grinned. She grabbed his wrist, and pulled him forward. And the crowd was just … parting for her.
Harry laughed again. This was weird. He tossed a look at Draco, who looked back at him, with a pinched mouth, but soft, tired eyes.
Harry stood at the glass door, looking out into the snow, into the tree line in the distance, and the stars shining above.
‘So you’re back together then,’ Draco accused, not quite looking Harry in the eye, more like somewhere around his chest. ‘Was to be expected, I suppose. If what she’s said all year is to be believed.’ He shifted his tone in a mocking imitation of Ginny, ‘Oh Harry and I only broke up because he has to go and
Harry pulled it open, and the book cracked audibly. In delicate cursive writing, the top of the page had— ‘Eshma Potter?’ He looked up at Draco, wide-eyed.
‘It can’t have been real, then. This has all been … made up. Some kind of … prank on me ...' Harry shoved the journal in Malfoy’s arms. ‘Stay away from me. Please.’ And he left.
“No bloody idea,” Harry said, staring at the paper blankly. No idea because ... it was true. He had no clue as to why he’d be invited. “Haven’t seen him in years.” He hadn’t seen Malfoy since the trials, since the day Harry had testified on his behalf, and given him back his wand. Malfoy had seemed so meek … meek and broken. With dark shadows under his eyes, small raised scars dotting his face. He’d merely grabbed the wand in a shaky, bony hand, and muttered a
He shrugged, squinting against the sun beating down on them. “It’d be quiet today. And the food’s good.”
Er, should he just leave? “Um, I wanted to see a gift registry. For a wedding,” he found himself saying.
Potter whipped his head to face forwards, to concentrate on his marshmallow again. With it secure, he extended his stick straight into the fire. The marshmallow ignited immediately.
Draco emitted a happy laugh, and held him close. They tumbled together, onto the bed, in each other's arms.
The train started to move—rattling and picking up speed. Harry glanced out the window, watching the wide plains of Scotland begin to whip by.
Draco lay flat on his back, with hands folded overtop the blanket. He watched Harry rather expectantly, so Harry gave a little shake to his head, and went around the other side of the bed, slipping in.
Draco pressed his finger inside, meeting little resistance. And fuck, did it feel good. Harry felt his softened cock stir. Maybe he
Draco tilted his head up, and captured Harry's mouth in a kiss, as his hand began to stroke Harry again. 'I want you to feel good,' he whispered against Harry's lips.
Harry looked at the bed, imagining Draco climbing into it every night, and then climbing out of it every morning. Did he dream? Did he have nightmares? Had he ever thought of Harry in this room?
“Er, okay.” The man scribbled something onto his paper cup. “You can pick it up over there.” He gestured to the spot where several other patrons were waiting. "Thank you. Next!"
else, as Malfoy calmly stood to meet Terry in the middle. Without hesitation, Malfoy laced his fingers through the hair behind Terry’s ears, his thumbs on Terry’s jawline.
sent him those things, right? It wouldn’t be, say, his mum sending him weird gifts and an old diary … Okay, he was definitely just anxious. ‘You sent me …' Merlin, what was
Harry shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. “I noticed you don’t decorate much, so I thought you might like a plant.”
She glanced up at him as he slid into the seat across from her, and shot him a smile. “With Ronald Weasley.”
Harry let out a startled laugh. (Because what else could he do?) Merlin, his friends were … well, overly invested. To say the least. ‘Come inside,’ he said, opening the door wider. ‘We can talk about it.’
“Something fancy,” Draco echoed, and turned back to the fish, some of them were mouthing at the water’s surface. He didn’t know what to make of that either.
Draco’s pounding heart didn’t slow down, even when he got back to his dorm room. He opened up his journal to a blank page, and gave a little manic giggle, and covered his eyes.
She’d never—”My chances?! There are no chances, Pansy,” he said adamantly, tilting his head to look her head on, with full eye-contact, hoping she’d get the message.
He nearly spat out his eggs. It was a miracle he swallowed them without choking. ‘Ginny …’ he warned, turning to glare at her.
Draco sighed deep, and stabbed a few pieces of lettuce, and put them into his mouth. They tasted flavourless now, though it was likely no fault of the cook.
