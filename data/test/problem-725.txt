Draco scrambled into a sitting position as she came in with a tray, large mugs with whipped cream sat on top. God, he loved his mum.
“Rugby training treating you well, Harry.” Cedric said, eyes smouldering as if he could see through the duvet and Harry’s underwear and sleep shorts to what was underneath. Harry resisted the urge to hide his crotch with his book. He felt rage rising up in him. How dare Cedric come in here and eyefuck Harry as if he hadn’t ruined their whole relationship with his condescension and snobbery. As if he hadn’t ended their relationship because he ‘wasn’t looking for anything too serious right now’ (a week before their six-month anniversary! That’s pretty fucking serious when you’re sixteen) and then immediately shacked up with Harry’s ex, Cho.
Neither Harry nor Ron were at dinner, which was totally within school rules- curfew was ten on weekdays and 11 on weekends for sixth formers, but still, Draco felt their absence. Oh alright, just Harry’s absence, but where Harry went, Ron went.
When they arrived back at Grimmauld, Pansy hauled Draco upstairs to get dressed while threatening that harry was not allowed to leave before she did his makeup. Harry and Blaise went to the kitchen, chatting amiably while Harry made brownies. Dean and Seamus floo’d in and the four of them sat around the table eating brownies and chatting. Then Pansy came down in a black dress that left nearly nothing to the imagination and pulled Harry and Blaise upstairs to get ready. After pushing Blaise into the spare room, she commanded Harry take her to his room. He showed her his collection of clubbing clothes, and she chose a pair of deep indigo jeans that clung to him like a second skin, and an emerald green shirt that she, like he had, only buttoned halfway. “are you trying to make me Slytherin for the night?” Harry asked. “No, you  handsome fool, it goes with your eyes. Now you’re dressed, show me how you usually prepare your face for these club nights”
“Yea, see? I didn’t even know that until just now. And Harry has a lot of trouble with outsiders, especially ones that come with the same connotations as you”
“Fuck. Fuck, mum. I saw Father in the garden, with, with Mrs Prewett, and they were getting off like fucking teenagers and it was so horrible and, just, fuck, mum” he finally says, tears streaming down his face as he holds his mother’s hands.
“I‘ll get rid of Peterson tomorrow, baby I promise” he said, green eyes piercing me when I finally look down at him.
Of course he wouldn’t want Draco- who would? Who would want an ex-death eater with anxiety and daddy issues and a mean streak a mile wide. As the familiar vice of self-loathing tightened around his chest, he felt Potter stir behind him and decided he had to get as far away from him as possible.
Harry felt fucking awful. He knew it wasn’t his fault, but he couldn’t help like his flirting had given Blaise the wrong idea- but then again, Harry was always clear about his relationship with Draco, and he was the same with Pansy, who had never ever made a move on him. It was all so fucked. The friendship group he had only just gained had been cleaved down the middle, and he couldn’t help but feel somewhat responsible.
Pansy decided to work off her debts by teaming up with Granger. She claims it’s ‘gratitude’ but we all know it's so she can regain even a crumb of social standing after her somewhat unsavoury comment made during the war.
Then it was back for a simple lunch of sandwiches and leftover cake- not that there was much- and Draco was faced with his free afternoon. Or at least he was, until Harry cornered him and asked if they could talk. Not wishing to seem disagreeable, Draco acquiesced and followed Harry, who led them right into the copse of apple trees on the very outskirts of the farm.
“And I hate that you’re still this immature. We’re not children anymore, Harry. Draco has done nothing to you, but you’ve done a lot to him since he’s been here, and you need to fix that.” Hermione said, voice unforgiving and Draco heard Harry heave a sigh. Deciding he’d heard enough, Draco quietly closed the window and pulled his sleep shorts on. Just as he was climbing into bed there was yet another knock at the door.
A large majestic farm house with stone walls and wooden shutters, that was clearly past its prime and looked a little dilapidated sat at the centre. Around it, garages and tractors and barns and hay bales and animal pens stretched into the green expanse, growing larger as the car made its way down the winding path bringing him ever close to his life for the next few months.
“Can you not come without Draco?” Peterson asks and I can’t help but smile. Harry laughs out loud, and Peterson looks startled.
“Good to see you again, Harry. I wish it was in better circumstances. As you know, the court ruled that as the Dursley’s were your blood relatives, you are to be kept in the loop, as it were, with key information about them” here the lawyer took a deep breath.
First, it seems as if Harry is gay. Then wedding bells ring when he can recite Draco’s favourite sonnet, and now he’s in love? With this girl? It was all too much. Rugby boys weren't supposed to be like this.
It was all becoming too much, and Harry could feel his heart beat quicken. He squeezed Ron’s hand, and the two immediately stood up and slipped out of the church. He could feel Petunia’s eyes watching him leave, burning into his back like a brand.
Harry turned to him, and he once again found himself pinned under the relentless green stare. “oui un petit peu, mais j’voudrais ameliorer donc je me suis inscrite pour la classe” replied Harry, in a flawless accent. (yes, a little bit but I would like to improve so I signed up for the class)
“surely it’s my balls for breakfast he wants” laughed Harry, before Teddy lurched forward in his highchair and spat up milk and banana all over his shorts. “oh for fucks sake” muttered Harry, shucking off his shorts so he was left only in underwear and spelling them up to the laundry. “why don’t you just cast a cleaning charm?” asked Blaise. “you do live awfully muggle”
“just because, I’m like, bi I guess, and I kinda hoped that the painted nails and gay books meant more than just superficial interest? I just, I don’t know” Harry stumbled over his words, unsure of how to express how much he wanted a friend like him in that innate way to his historic rival of seven years. It felt too,,, personal, and raw.
He had Ron, which was important, but he missed Hermione with all his heart. The people had been friendly enough. Purely by virtue of his place on the rugby team, he was treated with respect by most boys, possibly fear by others. That one posh blond from French seemed to view him with… apprehension and disdain, a feeling Harry was entirely unused to. People were never scared of him. Hermione described him as being the human embodiment of a chocolate Labrador. His friends’ mums always loved him.
Clearly hungover, and half dressed, Harry stumbled over his own shoes from the night before, and rolled onto his bed, not even bothering to get under the duvet, despite the Scottish September chill that had begun the permeate the air; warning of the winter to come.
“You may come here whenever you wish, to see the photo. I am looking into finding a copy for you to keep. Good luck, today. Take the rest of the week off if you feel you need it. Remember, we are all here for you.” she said, before silently exiting the room.
The two of them spent a pleasant day around the village after their tea, which was delicious. Draco was glad he couldn't drive otherwise he would be at that tea shop every single day of the summer.
Remus blushed a tiny bit as Sirius slung his arm over his shoulder, and Draco marvelled again at how in love the two were. He imagined Harry doing the same to him, but tried to ignore it. It was so hard though, with Harry sitting just diagonally opposite him, skin glowing in the dying light, Adam's apple bobbing seductively as he drank, his large hands almost covering the mug entirely. Looking around the table, Draco caught Ginny staring too, and wondered what the story was there.
“For fucks sake, Gin, fine. I’ll kiss you, and you’ll leave me alone, alreet?” Harry said, anger evident in his tone.
The one benefit of no one other than Remus, who was currently engaged with Molly, talking to him was that Draco was left to observe the little world he had stumbled into, and he was noticing more and more discord with every passing day. If he had been at school, he would have filed away this information to later use against them. Private boy’s schools were more cutthroat than given credit for, however despite the clear undercurrents of stress and pain and conflict, this world was peaceful on the whole, and Draco was loath to bring that discord to the surface.
He opens the door, which creaks, alerting his mother to his presence. She looks up and gives him a glowing smile. “Draco, sweetheart! Where’s Harry?”
Once there, instead of talking, Harry dug out a small tin from his pocket and sat on a log. He opened the tin and Draco was a little shocked to see him start rolling a joint. Harry did so expertly, and as annoyed as Draco was with the man it was annoyingly sexy.
Remus snorted and muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like ‘no it won’t’ and Sirius elbowed him playfully.
After what felt like aeons, the ginger boy straightened up and wiped his eyes, before ignoring Draco completely and turning to Harry and saying “he did Ken he was working on a farm, Harry?” He asked
Draco’s insecurities bother Harry somewhat, but only because he knows they are entirely unfounded. Harry can also tell that Draco feels uncomfortable that he developed feelings for Harry long before Harry developed feelings for him. It is what it is though, thinks Harry, smiling at the new pet name before going to collect fresh sheets from the linen cupboard and planning what he will make for his numerous guests that night. Whilst he dresses the bed and dusts and generally makes sure it’s up to scruff for the two very posh and very picky Slytherins that will soon be occupying it, he decides on salmon teriyaki and rice.
unis kicking my arse right now so I'm not able to write as fast as I want to. updates will be unfortunately much slower but I'm doing my best
“She’s just upstairs” the woman said to Sirius, with a strong Caribbean accent. She then turned to face into the house and hollered “Sirius is here sweetie” up the stairs. At the noise, a black man who Draco assumed to be her husband wandered out of another door and greeted Sirius with enthusiasm. Then, Draco saw a girl who must be their daughter descend the stairs. She was in knee-length shorts and a cropped polo shirt with converse. Her hair was in box braids and hung to her waist, tied back into a low ponytail.
He made it through unscathed and found Remus kneeling by a patch of wooden fence that had rotted through. On the ground by Remus’ knees were some sledge hammers and mallets and wooden posts, and thick gloves.
Draco expected a typical farm housewife to come bustling down the stairs; skirts and a blouse with an apron on top, a tray of scones in hand and victory rolls secured atop her head. Instead, a man slowly made his way down, gripping the banister. He was wearing black cargo trousers, socks with holes in the toe and a ripped t-shirt. He smirked at Draco, eyes glinting.
And as childish as he knew it was, he resented the fact that Harry had carried Theo- that they had gone on some sort of mad adventure together, and would now have some obnoxious inside joke about it.
Draco was bloody cold. So bloody cold and he was shivering alarmingly violently. He had hoped Potter was asleep but was proved wrong when a deep voice, thick with sleep, rumbled from beside him; “come closer”
“Thank you for trusting me with that, Draco” Harry said, sincere all of a sudden. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He had still half expected him to take the piss. He hadn't realised how good it would feel to be accepted. He still sort-of saw it as a problem. That there was something wrong with him because of it. Harry’s earnest reaction lessened that feeling somewhat.
They watched 10 Things I Hate About You first, followed by She’s The Man, and Remus knocked with a tray of sandwiches for their dinner, and a promise to try and talk to Harry a little bit more, which Draco thought was a little unnecessary. Harry hadn’t done anything but dislike him, which barely felt like a crime, even if it wasn't that nice for Draco himself. He felt like he’d caused a lot of aggro and for no reason.
All the Gryffindor boys drink, and Finnegan grins and says “we’ve only been together a week, we’re making up for lost time” whilst grinning and sliding a suggestive hand up Thomas’s thigh. I hope he never did that to Potter... I turn to look at Potter, who’s just grinning. He looks almost happy for the couple. It shouldn’t make me relax that he doesn’t seem to have any interest in Finnegan, but it does.
He skidded into the classroom twenty minutes late, and collapsed into his chair next to Harry, who looked upsetting put together for the first Monday back from the first holiday of the year.
Having gotten his timetable, he strode down the echoing, drafty corridors of the ancient stone castle that housed the main school offices, going towards his French class.
“It's a shame, Harry. We would work so much better together” Bryn said, winking and drawing a finger down Harry’s chest.
Embarrassingly, I do not drink from my cup. All the Gryffindors do, including Potter. Weasel turns red and squeaks.  I assume the Weasley sister, but the bond is flung to the forefront of my memory and I know that it cannot have been the Weaslette. Under my claim, Potter can’t sleep with anyone ever enrolled within Hogwarts’ Hallowed Halls. Having drunk too much for my own good, I say “calm down Weasel, it wasn’t your poor excuse for a sister”
Upon entering, he was enveloped by warmth and up until then he hadn't even noticed he was shivering. He glanced out the window to see Remus and Sirius walking back to the farm house, Sirius leaning on Remus, supposedly in lieu of his cane. Behind them, a Weasley boy and Harry were carrying the table back in, and they came back out for the benches. Draco had never before felt like such an intruder, but that small family tableau of the two older men followed by the two younger reminded him how much of an outsider he was there. He sighed, and pulled the curtains before readying himself for bed.
He looked at teddy, dozing in his high chair, and at Sirius and Remus laughing about something, and he revelled in how amazing his life was now, even as he ached at the decision ahead of him.
‘you’ve walked out a hundred times how was I supposed to know this time that you wouldn’t come, that you wouldn’t come home” Harry trailed off here, despite having barely started. It was clear he was too overcome to continue. Another shock in what had become a very surprising day for Draco, he heard Luna’s voice, clear and light, pick up where he had left off.
“I think” Ron whispered conspiratorially, now he saw that Harry had calmed down, “I think I could get some firewhiskey from George, really spice up the weekend, eh?”
Harry rolled his eyes and slid into the bed next to Draco, wondering whether sober Draco would still want cuddles.
“if you’re interested in the dance, I can teach you, or ask to Bianca to, she taught me when I went to one of Hermione’s family parties” replied Harry.
They got back in time for lunch, where Sirius asked whether Draco had liked his birthday, and Draco enthusiastically affirmed.
“I bought my portable dvd player and some films. I thought we could watch one?” she said, rummaging in her bag and pulling out something that looked vaguely like a laptop, and various dvds.
“I don’t think I will darling. I’ve never seen you look at someone like that. I must admit though, he is gorgeous. All dark skin and muscle, and that earring”
“Hi, mum” Sirius said, giving the woman - his mother? Draco was becoming increasingly confused by this family dynamic- a kiss on the cheek, before ruffling Harry’s hair and sitting down.
“I’m sure that’s not it” said Draco, almost calling Harry handsome but restraining himself at the last minute. “And Bryn sounds like an arsehole”
Harry looked like a god, toned body evident beneath his t-shirt (it said queen but there were for men on the t shirt, not an old lady, which Draco found confusing) , hair running wild. He felt like a god too. He always felt close to Sirius with his long hair running free and the triumphant tones of Queen keeping him buoyed. He looked to the boys singing with him, Draco and the girls just watching in amusement, and he felt a surge of happiness run through him so powerfully that he almost choked on his firewhiskey as he downed it.
“what are you making?” Draco asks, voice soft and quiet, as if not wishing to disturb the serenity of the kitchen.
The golden Trio turned to each other and those around them, Hermione looking sick at the sentiment that Hogwarts was not the epitome of thorough education. McGonagall continued; “we fought and won a war against bigotry, and division, and the prejudice-fuelled extermination of those considered ‘lesser’. The muggles did so too, centuries and decades ago, and now they educate their children about these hatreds, their source, their insidious nature, and how to stop falling into the trap of perceived supremacy of one group over another. Muggle history is fraught with division and prejudice, so we have decided to take a leaf out of their book, and teach you more. To ward against blood purist beliefs, we have added a new compulsory class to all years, wizarding politics. This class will teach about the war and the beliefs that fuelled it. Furthermore, all years will be able to take one of several muggle subjects, taught by parents of muggle-born wizards. There will be a list of these for you to choose from later”- at this, Hermione looked ready to combust.
Draco’s cheeks burned in embarrassment. His mother would be astounded to see him up at such an uncouth time.
Helplessness in the face of death, and loss and mourning is a world away from the helplessness he feels now, knowing Draco is in the same home as him, and yet Harry feels entirely unable to go to him. It is easier, though. At least Harry knows that even if Draco never wants to see him again, he will still be alive. None of the others are alive.
“I’ll send him to Hermione so it’ll look like a promotion. God, Draco I’m about to ask you to marry me, I don’t give a shit about my pa”
No one had come back into the kitchen by the time he was finished, so Draco just made his way back to his little cottage, changed into pyjamas and settled into bed. The late spring heat was a bit stifling and the duvet was thick and better suited to winter, so he got up and opened the window. He stood there and leaned his head out, savouring the breeze on his face and through his hair.
Draco and Harry were the only two who did French, however, which Draco revelled in. it meant that they could converse in French, effectively cutting everyone out of their conversation, and Draco was rewarded with the full weight of Harry’s attention on him.
Soon, they trudged back to Draco’s cottage, hands held and swinging between them as Pansy talked animatedly about the party later. Draco had to keep reminding her there were only three other young people there really, as well as Ginny but things between her and Harry had been frosty at best in recent times.
Once McGonagall stopped talking, Ron and Harry looked right at Hermione, who rolled her eyes but nodded, knowing she would spend the best part of her night in the Gryffindor boy’s room transfiguring all their clothes and essentially doing their packing for them.
“When Harry was a weean he found these piglets running down the track just beyond the farm's edge, and the daft boy scooped them all up and brought them home. Since then he’s tended to them mainly. Loves ‘em like children he does, given ‘em names and everything”
They were back at the house soon, and Draco walked into the kitchen to see Harry, Ron and Sirius devouring scones like starving men.
As he was stripping off his t-shirt he heard voices and smirked. He felt bad for overhearing, but he argued that given it was likely about him it was fair.
“Genuinely though, thanks for tha” Harry said, sitting up and bracing his forearms on his knees, looking at Draco earnestly. “She’s called herself in love with me since she was about ten, and it’s only gotten worse as she’s gotten older and hornier”
“I haven’t got a girlfriend, Malfoy. What are you on about?” asked harry as he leant over to sweep Draco’s fringe out of his face. When this bout was over Draco turned to Harry, brow furrowed and looking confused. “your girlfriend? The girl who looked like Hermione that you were all over earlier.”
“I assume it's dinner?” Draco asked to cut the tension and Harry nodded before turning around and walking back to the house. Hermione just hooked her arm through Draco’s and they walked back together. Sirius looked somewhat surprised to see them arrive together but Remus just smiled and Draco got the feeling that Remus was under-appreciated as a silent observer, and likely knew everything there was to know about everyone in his life.
“I’ll bring Pansy, like I always do” Draco said, hoping that his friends didn’t make a joke about it that accidentally outed him. He liked Harry and Ron, but he couldn’t yet trust them not to be homophobic.
Draco gasped, and received a weird look from the woman manning the sandwich table. He blushed and hastily walked away. He saw Ron reach for Bryn. Harry grabbed Ron by the bicep and pulled him away, followed by Remus. Bryn looked right at Draco and Draco tripped over his feet in an effort to turn around and make it look like he hadn't been watching the whole exchange.
Draco flushed with embarrassment, deeply ashamed at being so openly vulnerable, and to Harry, no less, whose parents were dead. Draco had no right to complain. Draco was about to say as much when he found himself crushed against Harry’s torso, Harry’s arms strong around him.
Sometime later, he heard the door open and he turned glassy, unfocused eyes towards the intruder, too far gone to care about being seen in this state. To his genuine surprise, it was Lovegood, slowly and softly making her way into the room. She knelt down by his bed, gently taking the bottle from in between his limp fingers. She then rose, and went to fiddle with the black box by the side of Harry’s unmade bed. Draco assumed she would curl up in the raven’s bed in some romantic attempt to replace the body that should have been there, but to his surprise she came back towards him, as music started to fill the air.
“it really is very kind of you to take Draco in” Pansy had said with shocking sincerity as they entered the nursery.
English passed okay. They spent the lesson on poetry, and his homework was to research Shakespearean sonnet form, pick the Shakespearean sonnet that he considered to be his favourite, and write a bit about why. Nice and easy work for the first day back.
“I know, mam” Ron said with exasperated fondness, before he started up the stairs, gesturing for Draco to follow.
Lucius was never allowed to know that Draco was gay. Ideally, he would die, leave Draco a fuckton of money, and then Draco could fall in love in peace. He hoped that at uni he could escape his father’s shadow, but he knew that many of the old doddery fellows at both oxford and Cambridge would report back on Draco’s every move.
He then took her all the way to the copse of apple trees, and the two of them lay stretched out in the shade next to it, basking in the early-July sun. they talked through Draco’s options, and Pansy said that he should stay here just so she could visit and drool over Harry, and though she was joking Draco knew it was her way of expressing support for him if he chose to deviate from the traditional path, and he loved her for it. Knowing had her support warmed him more than the sun ever could.
This just confused Draco further. The snatches he got of Harry’s life were going to give him whiplash.
Despite his eagerness to see Vernon dead and buried, Harry’s heart ached for Dudley. To carry your father’s coffin before the age of seventeen is something no child should have to go through, and from one orphan to what Harry supposed was a half-orphan, Harry pitied Dudley, with all his soul.
Of course, they took it upon themselves to be the paragons of virtue, all forgiving and holding hands and kumbaya my lord.
“I’m sorry” Draco said. He could assume that they had died from that, but he had guessed that already. He now knew who the James was that Effie had mistaken Harry for, and brought back painful memories of the past.
Narcissa looked up at Harry, eyes shining with tears. “thank you for allowing me to meet him Harry. He’s wonderful, perfect even.” A tear slipped down her cheek. “forgive me for saying this lest I bring down the mood, but this tea feels an awful lot like forgiveness, Harry, and I want you to know how much that means to me. I would love to stay in Teddy’s life, if you’ll have me, and Draco too of course.” Harry smiled, happy that this meeting had gone better than ever expected.
While he hated to be alone, he felt like an intruder at the Burrow, convinced that had he worked faster, George would still have a twin. But he was never truly alone, every moment he spent in his own company was in a way also spent with Queen, Bowie, Winehouse, Muse, Enigma- anything and everything.
“do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked hesitantly, aware that just because he trusted Harry with everything, the vast difference in their circumstances meant that it may take months, or even years, for Harry to trust him with things like this.
It was really nice, too. The film was sweet enough to start with- the young girl living with grandparents in a quaint French village, the beau that showed her the wonders of romance, carving their initials into church bells and singing their love to the world…
The night passed with easy, teasing conversation. Teddy fell asleep in Harry’s lap early on, but Harry was enjoying himself too much to drag him away to his nursery, so he let the baby sleep on him.
The second showed Harry with a baby in his arms. The baby was clutching Harry’s little finger in one of its chubby hands and Harry was looking down at the baby with an expression of muted elation on his face. The caption read ‘Teddy bear’. Some girl named Ginny had commented ‘daddy Harry’ and Draco felt an embarrassing surge of jealousy.
“sure” said Harry with a grin, before getting into Draco’s bed. Not onto, on top of the covers like all the times before, but fully into, snuggling up under the covers. Draco had no choice but to join him.
“I know” Potter whispered back, turning Draco’s face, bending down and kissing him. He tasted of chocolate, and Draco was so caught up in the feeling of Potter kissing him that he didn’t notice that Potter had gently manoeuvred them so that they were lying side by side against the green pillows.
Finally, they were all settled at the table with their dinner in front of them. Harry placed a hand on Draco’s thigh as they ate, and delighted in the faint blush that dusted Draco’s cheeks for the rest of the meal. Once done, Pansy and Blaise offered to clean up, and so the rest made their way into the living room. Harry sat and pulled Draco on top of him by the hips. Draco yelped, falling on Harry in an ungainly heap and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, propping his chin on Draco’s shoulder and revelling in the easiness of the touch. Soon, Pansy and Blaise came back in, a bottle of firewhiskey in tow, and the six of them drank long into the night. It ended, as it had many nights before, with Hermione lugging Ron through the floo, and Harry carrying Draco upstairs, Blaise doing the same for Pansy, even though he seemed just as drunk.
Someone- he missed who but he was fairly sure they were ginger- kept refilling his mug, and before he knew it he was well on the way to being drunk. The air was getting chillier, reminding Draco that for all the heat of the day, it was May and not July, and that he should have had the foresight to bring out a jumper.
“Same place the grey eyes come from, I suspect” Draco replied, inexplicably happy when Sirius threw his head back and laughed a deep hearty laugh in response.
“It was Remus’ idea, actually, I just helped him with it” Sirius said and then Draco was jogging over to them and wrapping his arms around Remus’ solid chest. Strong arms wrapped around his back for a moment before he stepped back again.
He lifted Draco up, but when Draco’s legs shook treacherously when he tried to take a step, harry scooped him up again.
He also realised how much he enjoys Draco’s company, too. When the blond had shyly admitted that he hadn’t don’t anything, all Harry could think was ‘I want to be your first kiss. I would make it so good for you’
On their way back, Remus introduced him to some of the cows, and Draco decided his favourite was a smaller one named Cordelia. When he said this Remus chucked and said
Draco maintains that Harry had no idea he had cried that night, but the raven had clearly latched onto Draco’s appreciation of the singer, and for the next few days, every time the blond entered their room, he would be wrapped up in the soft tones of one of Hozier’s songs. He took this gesture of recognition, understanding and friendship and held it close to his heart.
Harry hadn’t realised how tired he was until he fell into bed, Draco on top of him, snoring softly already.
Harry immediately lost himself in dancing with Draco. They set up a slow grind together, arms loosely draped over each other, moving sensually to the songs played at an ear-splitting volume. After what felt like hours, Pansy tugged Draco over to the bar with her, and Harry danced with Dean and Seamus, before the heat overwhelmed him. He yelled over the music that he was going for some fresh air and stumbled out into the smoker’s area. He heard the door open immediately after him, and turned, assuming Draco had seen and followed him out, but it was Blaise.
Greg and Vince didn’t have anyone, much the same as the years before, but weren’t into the whole wearing-suits-and-acting-posh-and-dancing-thing, and would probably leave very early.
The team was good. Despite it being an English private boy’s boarding school deep into the countryside, Harry wasn’t the only non-white member of the team, which was deeply reassuring. Dean Thomas was black, as was one of the other boys, named Isaac. It immediately put him a little more at ease. He had felt very out of place during the first few days of school. Academically, he deserved to be there, but neither his race nor family background fit the mould for the types of boys who attended these types of schools.
To dissolve the bond; for example, if you have found someone better (here, this usually means richer, or of a purer bloodline), or if your ‘claimee’ wishes to marry another, you must simply say ‘I hereby renounce my claim upon...’ and the bond is dissolved.
“you looked like you needed company, Malfoy, you’ve been away with the fairies all day and I just wanted to check you were all right”
“no, but I am Teddy’s” replies Harry, matching Draco in intensity, if not volume. “don’t you get it Draco? Teddy is all I have. Of course you don’t understand, you’ve always had a family, but I have never had one. Now I do.” Harry’s voice is low, and dangerous. In his green eyes Draco can see the conviction that killed Voldemort. Harry’s words suck all of Draco’s anger away and he’s stuck feeling like the bully he was trying so desperately not to turn back into.
“fuck” she whispered behind him after minutes of silence. “and we were so fucking awful to you at school about it. God Harry I’m so fucking sorry” she said, and he heard the tell-tale wobble of tears in her voice. He bent down to put a now calm Teddy in his cot and turned to her to say that all was forgiven, but before he could open his mouth, she tackled him into a massive hug, and he felt the wetness of her tears soak through his t shirt where her head rested against his chest.
He stopped writing about the supposed merits of the abandonment of the family unit to watch them cross the large room, Harry shoving Ron onto a sofa and laughing before Ron reached out and pulled him down too, except Ron miscalculated and Harry landed right on top of him. Draco was prepared for the typical display of fragile masculinity- Harry to leap off of Ron’s lap shouting about no homo, but instead Ron gripped his arms around Harry’s middle and jostled him about a bit, before saying
Draco nodded mutely, flushing pink at being the sole receiver of Harry’s attention for the last five-ish minutes.
Draco stayed and chatted to Hermione and Luna and Ginny. Ginny seemed somewhat suspicious of him, but laughed despite herself at his sarcasm, which he counted as a win.
“My dad hates me. Hates that I’m gay. Sirius is the first man in my family to ever care for me, or make me feel wanted.” Draco murmured quietly, watching Harry’s eyes widen in shock from beneath lowered, heavy eyelids.
“what's dinner then?” Harry asked, hopping back on to Draco’s bed. “from the size of you and your mother, I'm sure I eat double both your portions combined” he said, winking.
“I think that’s the nicest thing anyones ever done for me” he said, and he saw the look that was equal parts happiness and equal parts pity that Sirius gave him.
“I’m so, so sorry Draco, I’m so sorry. I had no idea he would ever do such a thing I really had no idea I’m so sorry.” He said, over and over and over whilst he stroked Draco’s hair and felt like everything was crumbling around him.
“You haven’t made this summer easy on me” Draco retorted, and Harry’s face tightened as he nodded. “Yea, that’s fair, I s’pose” Harry responded, finally cracking one eye open and looking at Draco. Draco just rolled his eyes and said nothing, waiting for Harry to finally gather up the courage.
“nothing’s up, I just like you” Draco whispered, feeling able to speak his feelings now he knew they were reciprocated.
“if you don’t mind, I would love to stay and discuss what lead to you raising Teddy with you. I know in my mind you are too young to be raising a child, but you act as if it’s all you had ever known.” Narcissa smiles up at Harry.
Eventually, he felt Hermione’s head drooping onto his shoulder and he helped her up and steered her to the bed, going as far as to tuck her in, before he pulled a hoodie on, not bothered to get the blanket from the farmhouse, and fell asleep.
“he started rugby so he would have an excuse for all the bruises when people asked. He then just happened to be good at it. I think it was a release for him, too. And the more he was at practice, the less he was at their house.”
“yeah” Harry said, giving Ron a last hug before he sped away to Hogwarts. He turned around and went back inside, curling around Sirius’ body on the sofa, as if one man could keep the terrors of the world at bay.
Feeling bad for the constant teasing Draco was suffering, Harry thought to rescue him and said, “let me put my top back on and then Draco you can come with me to get Teddy yeah?”
“i don’t think any of mine would fit you... let me ask my mum if she has anything” Draco said, suddenly realising that of course Harry wasn’t going to sleep in his clothes, and he had only asked for a t-shirt, which meant he would be spending a whole night next to Harry who would only be wearing a t shirt and underwear. Oh god.
“we’ll take our leave. Fake norovirus will give Draco at least three more days off school, so we’ll both be around.” Narcissa says, giving Harry a tight hug.
“Right, so I would say ‘never have I ever...’ and then if you have done the thing I've said, you drink. I have to say something I haven't done, though. For example, never have I ever done muggle drugs, and yes so if you have, you drink, great, everyone gets it.”
“not a chance in hell mate” said Harry, before floo’ing back to Grimmauld, and making up an extra bedroom for Dean and Seamus, should they decide to stay.
He could barely stand the service. Ron held his hand throughout the entire thing, but even with his solid, steadying presence, it was so hard for Harry to hear the priest drone on about the ‘wonderful’ life Vernon had lived, as if Harry wasn’t living, breathing proof of some of the worst parts of humanity, as if Harry didn’t have a triangular burn scar on his upper thigh, that even Ron hadn’t seen yet, for all the awful memories it brought up, from being forced to iron at age seven. As if Harry didn’t have crippling claustrophobia from being forced to live in a cupboard. As if Harry didn’t have permanent nerve damage in his fingers from all the injuries sustained whilst cooking.
He didn’t have to wait long though, as the floo chimed before he had finished his eggs. He yelled “in here, Draco” before continuing to eat. He offered Draco bacon and eggs, which the blond accepted somewhat hesitantly, and then gave Teddy to Draco, who held the child at arm’s length. “you can let him touch you, you know” laughed Harry “what if he vomits on me. Vomit doesn’t come out of cashmere” whispered Draco in a horrified voice. Harry laughed so hard he cried. “then don’t bloody where cashmere around a baby you git” he said. “come on let’s get you moved in” Draco was astonished when Harry didn’t shrink or ‘wingardium leviosa’ his trunk, but the boy simply hefted it up in his arms, before bouncing up the stairs. As much as Draco was loathe to admit it, he couldn’t stop himself thinking how Harry’s arms must look under the baggy clothing he always wears. Draco is appreciative of the room prepared for him, and seemed to Harry to be relieved when he realised, he wasn’t on Teddy’s floor.
After seeing Luna and Harry snogging in the corridor on his way to bed, Draco had gone right back to the hall and swiped a couple bottles of champagne. He definitely regretted it. He currently feels even worse than after the first whiskey night.
“No, no not at all. I’d ask you to offer Harry here some girl advice about Gin, but I doubt you’d know anything about that” Sirius teased, gesturing for Draco to come in. Draco sat on one of the armchairs and took it as a win when Harry, who was draped across one of the sofas, didn’t immediately leave.
Draco nodded and waited uncomfortably as Ron shoved two more pairs of trousers and some t-shirts into a canvas bag, before the two of them went back downstairs.
As with Narcissa, it was awfully formal, but Harry deeply appreciated the sentiment. He wrote back immediately.
Turns out it was neither Remus nor Sirius with Harry. Instead, a very tall muscled ginger stood leaning against the wall, talking animatedly with Harry.
Later, sat in his Harry-less room, Draco felt the oppressive weight of the emptiness and silence begin to weigh on him, and without thinking too hard he reached for the bottle he knew was tucked under his bed. Feeling a mixture of pride (this was his first time succumbing to the comfort of muggle vodka since returning to Hogwarts) and disgust (the minute he was alone he reached for the comfort held in the neck of a bottle) he unscrewed the top of the bottle and drank deeply.
Harry leave’s Teddy with Draco and heads to Sainsbury’s for ingredients, grabbing some drinks as well, and stocking up on the baking essentials that he uses up at a rate of knots. He arrives home to the heart-warming sight of Draco laying on his stomach on the floor making faces at Teddy, and Teddy giggling and clapping his chubby little hands in excitement. Harry made his way into the kitchen and settled into a long day of cooking. Ron and Hermione came early, and Ron helped him out as Hermione played with the baby.
“I’m not sure. Maybe French with business studies? And then maybe I could apprentice with you in the financial running of the farm?” Draco suggested tentatively, worried Sirius would find him too forward.
“something slow-ish, please” said Pansy, and Harry complied, soon the sounds of ‘redbone’ by Childish Gambino filled the room. Blaise gave a nod of approval to Harry, and started to nod his head to the beat. Harry guessed this was as close to kindness as he would get from Blaise, and smiled, sipping leisurely from his tumbler. He was careful not to drink too much in case there was a middle-of-the-night Teddy emergency, but he allowed himself just enough to dull the senses.
“I’m probably the last person he wants to see right now, other than Blaise, and you’re his best friend. You know him better than I could even hope to at this point, and even if you can’t magically fix it, you’ll do a better job than me”
“more so than I thought I would be” I admit. “the picture is too sweet for me to be angry. We look-“
He heard a soft intake of breath behind him and assumed Harry must have heard. ‘Serves him right’ Draco thought, finally stepping away from Hermione, allowing her to hug Pansy. Eventually everyone had left, and Harry and Remus were taking the table back inside. Draco and Pansy returned to the cottage and discussed everyone quietly as they got undressed then into pyjamas and climbed into bed.
“Right. It all starts with this girl, Cho Chang. She went to my school, and I started dating her like, near the start of year ten. Through her, I meet Cedric because he was always at the parties, she would take me to, and he and I became friends. We would chat sometimes online, we both liked rugby- I played, but he watched it with his dad as like a bonding thing- and he was mates with my girlfriend, so we spent a lot of time together.
“come on Malfoy, you’ll catch your death of cold out here, let’s go to the tent” Malfoy stood and stumbled a bit, and the two boys walked unsteadily to their tent, arms around each other for support. Harry fumbled around in the dark, grateful that he had had the foresight earlier to set his pyjamas out on his sleeping bag. He shuffled out of his sweaty tracksuits and into his thick plaid pyjama trousers, and shucked off his t shirt, exchanging it for a clean one and then putting Dudley’s fleece back on. He then slid into his sleeping bag and got comfortable, watching Malfoy have considerably less luck getting changed.
“Same people who came after Saint Dunstan’s day, and Percy. He’s another Weasley but he works in the city and only comes home for the summer. That's alright with you?”
He walked into his room, and Harry was lounging on the bed, reading one of Draco’s books. It hit Draco like a ball to the stomach that all he wanted was to crawl into bed next to Harry and have Harry hold him.
“you tempt me Potty, you really do. If I wasn’t such a loyal friend, it would be my hand not Finnegan’s there right now” sighed Blaise. Harry genuinely could not tell if the boy was being serious or not, so he just decided to go along with the joke.
And not a moment too soon. The minute the lock turned, he heard the door open, and heard footsteps come into the room.
“let’s get you to bed then” said Harry, unsure of how to respond to such affection. He picked Draco up, bridal style again, marvelling at how lithe and light Draco was in his arms. Draco snuggled into Harry’s chest, and Harry once again felt uncomfortable at the affection. He knew emotions ran high when drunk, and he didn’t want to make Draco cry, or give him the wrong idea. Harry was still trying to figure out his feelings.
The door creaked open. Draco’s heart dropped when he thought it might have been his father, but his mother poked her head ‘round the door.
He awoke early on Wednesday, and set up Teddy’s toys on the kitchen floor so he could bake and father at the same time, which was no easy feat. He baked all morning. His favourite lavender lemon drizzle cake, fresh bread for cucumber and ham sandwiches like at muggle birthday parties, orange zest and chocolate chip scones to go with clotted cream, and vanilla fairy cakes with strawberry icing. He arranged them all on the table before taking Teddy off to clean them both of the flour and cake batter they were coated in. he wrestled Teddy into his bear onesie before changing into the nicest jeans he owned and a button down. He wanted to look professional for Narcissa, remembering how fancy Draco’s robes were at school. The November chill was a bit much, so he begrudgingly gave up professionalism in favour of his favourite Weasley jumper, a deep mustard with a maroon H on the front. He had just managed to get back downstairs and settle Teddy into his highchair with a bottle of juice and some cucumber sticks before the floo chimed. He rushed out to meet his guests, palms sweating in apprehension. Narcissa stepped out first, in austere black robes, her hair tightly braided back. Then Draco stepped through, in muggle clothes, to Harry’s surprise. We wore grey woollen trousers and a thick, warm-looking charcoal turtleneck. Unlike back at school, his hair wasn’t gelled back but hung loosely around his face.
“Bonjour la classe. Aujourdhui, on regarde un film sur la deuxieme guerre mondiale, avec l’actrice connnue, Audrey Tautou. S’apelle ‘un longue diamanche de fiancailles’. Bien.”
He lay on his bed for what felt like hours, alternating between crying silently and berating himself for such unwieldly emotions. He longed for the Malfoy Mask that he used to don so easily, but had slipped away from him now. He felt too deeply to hide it, and it made him feel so disgustingly vulnerable. The sky outside his window was darkening and he was wiping stray tears from his cheeks when he heard the door knock.
“i’m sorry, Harry. For what it’s worth, if I were you I wouldn’t go either” the lawyer said, laying a hand on Harry’s shoulder, before leaving.
Hermione takes Pansy out somewhere. Harry wasn’t really paying attention when they left. He returns to his Simnel cake, using magic to make tiny chicks out of marzipan to decorate it with. He is so absorbed in his task, he doesn’t hear the faint footfalls, the soft breathing of two tired bodies until a long, lithe arm sneaks around his waist, and a head of soft blond hair rests on his shoulder.
“who’s the ex then? I didn’t see any girls I didn’t recognise near you yesterday” Draco said, curiosity winning over self-preservation.
Hermione sat next to Draco, on the opposite side and other end of the table to Harry, who looked somewhat hurt. Remus looked between them, but he wasn’t frowning this time. Sirius looked confused and Draco watched as Remus leant over and whispered something in his ear, and the furrow in Sirius’ brow immediately smoothed out.
“no, Ron this is bad things very bad things you were right this is awful things.” He said, unable to rip his eyes away.
It was a Thursday evening, and they were all gathered around the table they had commandeered for themselves in the corner of the common room in their building. They were all typing away at one essay or another, comparing notes or asking questions every now and then.
Shaking himself, refusing to let his thoughts go down that path, he waited for Ron to deposit his bag and the rugby tackled him, and soon the two of them were rolling over the soft grass, laughing freely. It was such a good feeling. He could feel the disapproving stares of the Slytherins, and just to piss them off more he reached out an arm and hooked it around one of Hermione’s legs, pulling her into the pile. They lay there, panting in the grass as if they were the only three people in the whole world even though they weren’t even the only three people in that field, and Harry thought to himself; ‘this. This is what I died for. The safety to piss about with my two best mates in the grass in the waning late-summer heat’
“I think our Harry told you to leave him and Ron alone” he continued. Bryn turned his back on Remus, and said to Harry,
Four years later, Potter works at a new wizarding primary school in Kent, and I am assistant head of medical potions development at Saint Mungo’s. we have a bigger flat now, but Potter still finishes my coffee for me every morning before we go to work. We look after Teddy every other weekend and we entertain our friends for dinner often. He loves his job. Mine wears me out. We are happy. Happy and in love. We’re still a regular occurrence in the Prophet, but more now alongside articles detailing my latest potion, or how Potter works with children and yet has none of his own, or pictures of us in Diagon with Ron and Hermione. It’s good. Better than I ever could have imagined as an insecure twenty-one-year-old who swore the whole world hated him. (only half of it did. Maybe a quarter still do.)
He was given his cup of tea in a slightly chopped William Morris mug that he couldn’t help appreciate. As he sipped he looked at the men in front of him, conversing earnestly in front of him about something to do with farming and he thought that maybe, just maybe the company could be bearable, even if the rest of it wouldn’t be. At the very least, he was unlikely to be hatecrimed.
“I can’t say I’m a fan of that, to be honest. Can’t bear anything involving the destruction of the family unit” Harry says.
“I cannot thank you enough, lads. Honestly, not many people would have done that.” Theo said, leaning across the table to them.
God, how he wished Pansy was there to complain with him and cuddle up with him on the chilly nights and discuss the others with him. He resolved to be more open about how much she meant to him when he returned, and also enquire as to whether she could come and stay for a weekend during the summer sometime. He also needed to ask how the post worked here.
He was soon distracted by the food they were organising. They had sandwiches that had been kept fresh under a stasis charm. Today was the only day they would have nice-ish food. There were cereal bars and chocolate as well. All in all it was a weak, childish picnic, and Draco had never been so eager to eat a meal in his life.
Harry wakes up in an unfamiliar bed with the unmistaken feel of a body next to his. He eases out of bed so as not to wake Draco and takes Teddy downstairs to prepare his milk and potion. Harry covers Teddy’s little head with kisses as he walks, so overwhelmed with love for the tiny figure he held in his arms. Soon, Teddy is happily suckling his bottle, subdued with the illness but looking immensely healthier than he had the night before. When he’s finished, Harry settles onto the sofa with Teddy curled up over his heart, before falling back to sleep.
“Come now Draco” his mother admonished. “I’m your mother. I’ll wager I knew you liked boys before you did”
“Take these Ron my love, for the boys” Ron’s mum said as they left, shoving a sealed tin into her son's hands.
She was dressed in muggle sports leggings and a zip-up hoodie, looking for all the world like a model for that muggle sports shop names after the Greek goddess of victory. As was his norm, as he arrived in the hall his eyes immediately searched for Potter. That was another anxiety/safety response. After the events involving the room of hidden things and the fiendfyre, and despite, surprisingly, the events that occurred in the bathroom in sixth year, Draco automatically felt safer in a room if Potter was there, and since then this feeling had only intensified.
“we’re good, then? This hasn’t changed things?” Harry asked, scared one drunken night would cost one of his dearest friendships.
“Yeah, it’s actually a ‘mood’. I think because it refers to the hypothetical? Anyway, that’s beside the point. The important thing is to remember which sentence structures are always followed by the subjunctive.
“all my friends love you, Draco. I’m sorry that you felt like you had to lie to me, and I’m sorry that you have so little faith in this. If you wanted though, we could test this out in the world of our flat? Not tell anyone until its less new, and more secure, and then start thinking about making it public? We live almost like a couple anyway- the main differences would be sharing a bedroom, maybe, and spending more free time together. We could even go out in muggle London”
Draco couldn’t miss how fond Remus sounded when he talked of Harry. Harry clearly wasn’t just a summer hand but special to Remus and Sirius, though Draco couldn’t help but wonder what the relation there was. Remus and Sirius themselves seemed worlds apart, to say nothing of the fact that Harry was an entirely different race to the both of them.
Draco ate silently, the feeling of being an intruder washing over him once again, and he kept his head bent over his food as if to ensure no one noticed he was there. It worked, Remus and Sirius obviously too preoccupied to engage him in conversation, and the minute it was polite to do so, Draco fled
“I say boys. Sixth form at last, eh?” Theo said, the perfect carbon copy of his father. Draco was very much a Rich Private School Boy, but he did so in an elegant, modern fashion, he liked to think. He wore his signet ring with cashmere and merino jumpers, and pressed slacks that cost hundreds that his mother imported from Italy. Theo, on the other hand, sported a mullet and wore shoffels and tweed. He was utterly old fashioned, and would likely die in the same room in which he had been born in the Nott estate near the New Forest.
“This is t’guest house. S’not much, a bedroom, a bathroom and a sitting room. You’ll take meals with us up at the house, aye?” Harry said, fumbling for a key and opening the door.
“it is with regret that I stand here before you all to tell you that Hogwarts failed you, and your parents, and their parents before them. While as a school and faculty we were arguably on the ‘right’ side of the war, we fed the prejudices of the opposition with our lack of thorough education.”
A few hours later, the bang of the door to the common startled Draco out of his reverie, and then he heard the unmistakable sounds of Dean shouting, followed by the previously unheard cries of Hermione. He went down to investigate, and saw a stag Patronus dissolve in front of Hermione, clearly having already delivered its message.
“as you did Potty” said Blaise, grinning, and soon the two were swinging their hips to ‘I feel love’. Harry made sure to keep a respectful distance between them, mindful of Draco’s feelings.
“I’ve not got time to be waiting around, let’s go” said Harry, but though the words were harsh his voice wasn’t.
“I didn’t mean it like that you arrogant prick, I meant we’d make good friends. Don’t worry, you’ll keep your balls”
“I wouldn’t worry too much about the team, mate. They seem decent blokes, and I’m always on your side”
“god Malfoy how much did you drink?” asked Harry, slightly worried when Draco was still being sick thirty minutes later. It was then that he heard the loud shouts from downstairs
Remus then led him out to the land rover where Harry and Hermione, who must have stayed the night, were standing waiting. Sirius was nowhere in sight, and Draco suspected that the day yesterday had affected whatever medical affliction he had too much for him to be able to come out today.
After breakfast, Draco followed Remus instead as they checked over the horses, and he and Remus made pleasant conversation about Pansy, how Draco was missing her, when she should come up next and the like. It was a nice change from the morning, and Draco relished it, talking more than he was helping and mainly just watching Remus do most of the work, which the other man seemed happy to do.
Draco was about to ask Harry if he could sing, or at least play some more Hozier but Harry beat him to it; “Malfoy” he blurted, as if surprising himself, “can I ask you a personal question? I’m not asking to be mean or offensive but I’m genuinely curious”
The funeral was on a Thursday, and so he was at school that morning. As he and Ron were leaving to catch the train to London, Harry heard his name called. He turned to see Minerva, his strict yet kind hearted English teacher, who was apparently a friend of Sirius’, striding towards them.
The pain Draco heard in Harry’s voice forcefully reminded the blond of all the people Harry had lost, and he wanted to reach out in comfort to the boy on the other bed, hold him and soothe his troubles away- never mind that Draco was likely the source of most of them.
“it’ll be okay, yeah? Call me whenever. I’ve done all my work so just let me know if you want to hang out again this week. It would be good to see you.”
Harry kept smoking, occasionally passing the joint to Draco until it was finished, until he said anything.
“I know you don’t Potty dearest, but as his closest friends Blaise and I do. You would do it for Weasley and Granger. Speaking of whom, where is your entourage?”
He didn’t know what to do with himself. He felt loose, untethered. On one hand, he knew he would never have to suffer abuse at the hands of Vernon Dursley again. His wrist ached from when he broke it when Vernon pushed him down the stairs. He stared at the burn scars from years of being forced to cook.  he put his hand to his upper thigh, where the clearest evidence of the abuse lay, hidden under his underwear.
When that made him feel too pathetic, he instead turned his mind to writing the postcard for his mother. Purposefully only his mum and not his Father, who Draco took every opportunity to undermine, such as pretending he didn't exist.
“I’ll leave you boys here. Draco, I’ll take you down by the cows as there’s a fence that needs mending”  and then Draco was off walking again, barely getting fifteen minutes respite before he was forced to exercise. He was eternally grateful that he bought the walking boots on his mother’s advice.
After dinner, he went to Blaise’s room with Theo where their little group convened for what they called ‘Nabini wine nights’. It had started in year ten when Theo and Blaise had shared a dorm, and they would each bring wine back, tucked into their suitcases, rolled into jumpers and hidden in welly boots and the like, and each Saturday the group of five- Draco, Blaise, Theo, Greg, and Vince would drink roughly about 2-3 bottles between them, just hanging out and chatting.
With that, Harry turned heel and left, leaving Draco with the stranger who’s name he now knew was Ron.
“Pans. If Harry held all that against us, do you really think he would be letting us all live in the home he shares with a child who is essentially Harry’s own son? Harry understands that we were children, and even if he doesn’t expressly forgive us, as I would never ever expect him to-“ here Draco looks up at Harry, and Harry sees grey eyes filled with emotion and silvery with tears. “he has moved past it, yea? I’m sure that if you apologise properly, as I did, Harry will be okay.”
“Just you being here helps, Draco. You think Ron talked to me about it today? No. He sat next to me, let me hold his hand and said nothing. The only thing he said during the actual funeral was whether I wanted to go to the pub whilst we waited for the actual burial. Ron doesn’t talk to me often about this stuff, he just lets me sleep in his bed when I need to, like when I was eleven and his bed was the first I had ever slept in.”
“after the battle, Andy succumbed to her grief. She couldn’t care for Teddy properly, and I don’t blame her. I had this massive house and all the time in the world given that I had completed my life’s purpose at seventeen, and I was too traumatised from the war to even think about working yet, so I said I would take him, and she gave me full custody rights. Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasley’s and some friends from Hogwarts helped me fix the place up and make it homely and baby safe, and the two of us have been living here ever since. We see Andromeda every Sunday for tea, and Teddy never has a shortage of babysitters. It’s hard work, but I’m alone less than I’m not, and everyone has been wonderful in helping me. I love him, so much, and I feel so grateful to be able to give him the childhood I never had.” Harry said.
When he got close enough, Draco put a finger to his lips and pointed to Pansy, whose head was lolling on Draco’s thigh as she breathed softly and deeply. Harry grinned and nodded his understanding. His glasses were smudged and greasy, and the sunlight glinted off of them in a way that shouldn’t have been endearing.
“Alright sleeping beauty?” he said, winking, and running his hand through Draco’s bed hair. Draco let out a shuddering sigh at the gentle touch that he desperately hoped Harry would assume was because he was out of breath.
He was proud of the way the tent looked, and he called over to Malfoy that they could put their stuff inside, and set up. As he turned to call to Malfoy, he saw that neither of the other pairs had managed to do their tent, so he sighed and ended up having to do all three. By the time he was done, it had started to get a little chilly, so he donned a massive berghaus fleece that used to belong to Dudley but that he had kept because it was warm and somewhat comforting, despite its associations. Tents all set up, sleeping bags and roll mats sorted, the six set about making dinner.
We are in the illustrious eighth year at Hogwarts. ‘we’ is of course Blaise, Pansy, and I. the golden trio also returned (ew) as well as a few other Gryffindors, (also ew) and a handful of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.
He wandered around the other tables, some of which just held groups of people talking, but some held arts-and-crafty things; hand painted postcards, friendship bracelets and the like. He bought a postcard to send to his mum, and a friendship bracelet to send to Pansy, who had been a childhood friend since birth. He hadn't expected to miss her as much as he did.
It was like everything in his life was coming together. Sirius had gained custody of him the summer before year twelve, and then he and Ron had won sports scholarships to the same school. It had felt like fate, like the universe was finally making up for the years of abuse. And it was going to be his first ever Christmas with Sirius. Since year seven, he had spent his Christmases at the Burrow- the Dursley’s had been more than happy to let him go, and they got to spend their Christmases as a ‘proper family’. Molly always offered to let him stay the whole holiday, but Petunia thought that someone would notice Harry not being there for the whole two weeks, and the carefully constricted illusion of four privet drive being a happy family and not a hell of abuse for Harry would shatter, and the Dursley’s would be shunned by their neighbours, and so Harry was always forced to spend his holidays there, bar one special, heaven-sent day of reprieve where he was allowed to eat what and when he wanted, and he was with people who loved him.
He wobbled back to his room, narrowly avoiding falling down the stairs through sheer force of will, and collapsed onto his bed fully clothed. He fell asleep almost immediately.
Apparently, Ginny had been Harry’s first kiss, after which he had said he saw her more like a sister, and irreparably broken her heart for a good year afterwards. They were friends now which was… nice, Draco supposed. He still wasn’t sure what to make of the whole thing.
Harry saw Hermione frowning over the instructions and ambled up behind her, draping his arms over her and bending down to rest his chin on her shoulder. She sighed and leaned back into him. “it reminds me so much of the forest of dean” she whispered, and he could feel the tired sadness in her voice. He supposed that for Hermione this trip wasn’t just a reminder of the horcrux hunt but also a reminder of Ron’s leaving. He hugged her harder and said “he isn’t going anywhere. We know that. And I’m always, always here.” He straightened a little, dropping a kiss to the top of her head before resting his cheek there, content to know he had the rest of his life to be with his friends like this, no longer fearing that the next stranger they met was Voldemort in disguise.
“i don’t think it’s important, Draco. For what it's worth, asexuality would never be an issue for me, in a relationship.”
The rest of the week passes pleasantly enough. There were museum visits, and Draco got soaked during one disastrous bath time, bemoaning his ruined clothes. He returned to his room to find a pile of hoodies on his bed and a note that read “just throw these over your poncy outfits before dealing with Teddy-H”. Draco would never admit it to himself, but he liked how they smelled of Harry, laundry detergent, and coconut soap. As the weeks passed, the two boys settled into an easy routine around Teddy. Harry still did the lion’s share of the work, insisting that he enjoyed it, waving off all of Draco’s offers to change nappies or do ‘night duty’ as he called it. Andy and Narcissa still came for tea every Sunday, and Harry’s friends still dropped by consistently throughout the week. Draco tried to avoid as many of these teas as he could, much to Harry’s disappointment. Within his first two weeks he had formally apologised to all the Weasley’s, as well as Luna and Neville, but he still felt out of place.
He was terrified. Hogwarts had never lost a match. Those were big boots to fill. He wondered why he let Sirius talk him into applying here. He had been so insistent on the school, with speeches about Harry’s rugby career and ensuring a good education and how qualifications from a private school of such calibre would secure the rest of his life but there was no personal touch.
He had spent a lot of time with Ron since his return, who had explained that the reason Harry went to Dursley’s rather than Sirius was because blood relations took precedence over god-parents, and the fact that the Dursley’s were a family with their own son meant the courts had thought they would be better suited to raising Harry than the single, childless man Sirius was.
“back so soon Potter? Pomfrey sick of the sight of you already” said Malfoy, hiding his joy at Harry’s return as he pulled out his charms textbook and started to read.
The drive back consisted of Draco and Hermione discussing their studies after realising that they had both studied English and History. Hermione had then also studied politics and sociology, and Draco had done French. They discussed which exam boards they had done, what their A-Levels had been like, and discovered they had also done the exact same History exams.
“we’re teenagers Hermione, and I refuse to let Voldy take that away from me. I need your help because you grew up with muggles too. I want to host a house party at Grimmauld place. A proper muggle-style one with lights and music and dancing. Muggle booze and everything but I need your help with the spell work. Ron agreed to help set up the kitchen and Parlour, but I’m gonna need your help to magically seal off the rest of the house. I’ve been owling with Dudley” at this, Hermione pursed her lips. She knew Harry wanted to forgive his cousin for the sake of familial peace, but she would happily hex him into next Tuesday for everything he had put Harry through.
“They are disgustingly in love” he said, going to lean against the wall- aiming for the picture of nonchalant rich boy at a party beneath him- but he was further from the wall than he had thought and he stumbled back, only to be caught by Harry who murmured
Draco awoke late on Monday. He really didn’t want to be at school, he wanted to be at home, with his mum, and now he wouldn’t be able to get ready properly or he would miss all of French. He pulled his uniform on and ran like hell towards the main castle for his lesson.
And then Harry’s other hand was cradling Draco’s cheek and he was bringing their faces together and then Harry’s lips were on Draco’s, so impossibly soft and sweet, and the kiss was so gentle Draco felt like he was falling apart.
The ball was going well. The dinner was lovely, Ron and Hermione were making lovey-eyes at each other over the table, and Luna had kept him entertained with her stories about all her mad pets. The terrapin was his favourite, he had decided.
Draco felt his cheeks heat at being remembered; being included. He kept forgetting that he was liked here. His instinct when addressed by adult men was to shrink back, hide himself, become smaller, as he did with his father, his late grandfather before his passing, the teachers at school who still believed corporal punishment should have been legal. To feel safe around men like this was still a new and tentative feeling for Draco.
The rest of the holiday was a whirlwind of kissing Draco; going to Draco’s house, walking around his grounds, going on long walks in the countryside.
The Rugby Boys ran the school, much to Draco’s chagrin. In his humble opinion, he should be at the top of the hierarchy, due to his endless wealth, his unnatural good looks and the fact that his father is on the board of governors. The top spot that he deserves, however, is reserved for the A-Team rugby lads, who are all- again, in Draco’s humble opinion- bumbling Neanderthals with more muscle than sense and the worrying ability to break bones on a whim.  They were loud, boisterous and utterly self-absorbed, roaming the ancient stone corridors like lions, as if they were the only pupils in the whole school. The teacher’s doted on them, and they could always get away with not having done the work with a simple “but miss, there’s a match this weekend”
“God here I am complaining about my parents not liking each other and yours are dead what the fuck is wrong with me”
Remus helped Effie get up and took her somewhere, maybe the family living room or her bedroom, Draco wasn't sure. Soon enough, he was left alone in the kitchen, and he fell into the monotony of washing and soaping and drying and stacking as he tried not to dwell on the pain clearly evident in this little world that he had stumbled into.
Panic and excitement hit Draco in equal measure. The idea of all that time with Harry was intoxicating, but Draco had never had a proper sleepover before, not like this. He and all his friends have chauffeurs, and so at the end of each day together they would just be picked up and driven home. If they stayed for a long time, it's because their whole family had come to the estate for a weekend of hunting or some such in the summer, at which point the family would have their own set of rooms.
“you’re lying” I croak. “they might be okay with me being your friend, but not your boyfriend. No one forgets the past that easily.”
Harry laughed and ran after his best friend. Draco would remember that laugh forever. Hermione gave him a soft smile before rolling her eyes, taking Lunas hand and exiting the common room, Leaving Draco sat there, reeling and realising that perhaps he had never experienced real friendship, if real friendship felt like that morning had.
“Eighth years” she said, pleased at how they all immediately fell silent and turned to her in rapt attention as she spoke.
All too soon for Draco’s liking, Dean, Seamus and Neville bustled in, arms full of Honeydukes sweets and contraband firewhiskey. They all nodded, or smiled at him as they entered, something that made Draco feel better than he would ever admit to. Harry and Hermione came in, a limping Ron between them, and the group settled themselves on the floor, Ron’s bad leg stretched out in front of him, and Hermione fussing over it. Harry waved his wand at his speaker and the room filled with music. “it’s our playlist, tonight Ron!” he yelled triumphantly as a man’s voice filled the room, and all the Gryffindor boys immediately started to sing along
“I don’t know how you know that Malfoy, as it certainly wasn’t you” Potter says, staring at me. I shrink under his gaze. Beside me, Blaise jolts. He must have cottoned on.
“I’m not going anywhere” Harry whispered, fierce and earnest, squeezing Draco impossibly closer, feeling as if he never wanted to let go.
The fear and worry in Draco’s voice now made some of the tears spill over, but Harry didn’t trust himself to speak and so he just grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed tightly, before raising his wand to his forehead and pulling out the memory.  He turned to Draco and said in a hoarse cracked voice, “I need to show you, I’m sorry”
I reach our flat and hear voices, naturally assuming that Ron, Hermione or both are over, but when I open the door, Potter is shirtless, and snogging some man against the kitchen table. It’s too much to bear, and I feel I might cry. My heart aches, and I feel cold and hot all over, and I feel just so unbearably sad.
It was now only a few days until his birthday, and though he dearly missed his mother he was glad he wasn’t celebrating 19 in the presence of his father. Draco had recently begun to think that there were a multitude of reasons for his being sent to this farm. Not least because he had refused to apply to Oxford University, where his father, grandfather, great grandfather etc. had all attended.
“I really enjoyed myself. We don't have things like that, but I wish we did. There's no real sense of community where I live”
“Shit. He must be working his way up. we have to get him up before Diggory leaves that room” Ron said, glancing towards the bathroom that was worryingly silent.
“then you must understand that your current actions do not merit you being good, either.” He looked confused at this, and more than a little hurt too. “look at it this way, Potter. Because you think you are a Good Person, you don’t act like one. You believe that by virtue of you being Good, everything you do it good, and that is complete bollocks, if you pardon my language. Take me, before the war. You thought that I was a Bad Person, thoroughly and completely, and so nothing I did to you was ever good. I was saturated with bad-ness, when in fact that isn’t true. I was awful back then, but I was capable of goodness and kindness despite this.I let Pansy sleep in my bed with me when her fifth-year boyfriend called her ugly so she wouldn’t feel so alone. I always shared the sweets my mother sent me with Blaise because his mother often forgot to write him. I did Crabbe and Goyle’s homework for them when they couldn’t understand. Those were good actions, done by a bad person. What you’re doing now are bad actions, but you can’t recognise that, because you are so unflinchingly good.”
To his eternal astonishment, breakfast also included Harry turning his gaze on Draco and saying “what d’ya think of yesterday?” It was said with so little softness that Draco half expected Harry to follow up with ‘because you’re a posh little twat who has probably never been to something similar’ but he didn't.
Draco collapsed into the chair near Harry, staring into space and thinking about how empty his room would feel without Harry and his music, dancing and cheeriness. He felt a coarse finger brush his hand, and heard a hoarse voice, “Malfoy, can you please get Luna, and my iPod, its tucked under my Pillow.” Draco nodded, and turned to leave but was stopped by the rasping voice again; “oh Malfoy, come back too yea? And bring me some treacle tart if you can”. Draco smiled at the fact that whilst Harry may have wanted Luna, he wanted Draco too. He strode off into the castle, wondering where in the hell he would find treacle tart at 3:37 on a Sunday afternoon.
“your portkeys are scheduled to leave once you have all touched them together. Good luck.” Within minutes, the hall was empty.
He took the plates and cutlery over to the sink before handing a tea towel to Malfoy. “I’ll wash, you dry?” he asked. “I do it the muggle way because I find it’s a nice way to wind down, and it’s what I’m used to” he explained, filling the sink with warm water and soap. The two worked in companiable silence before Draco coughed awkwardly and said, “you’ve changed so much. You’re a war hero, but he you are, living like a single dad and you’ve only just turned eighteen.” Harry smiled. “we’ve all changed, Draco, and I love Teddy and I love being able to fulfil the father part of godfather. It’s all I had hoped for when I was a kid” Harry explained.
He was settling in with Theo and Blaise, having gratefully swapped his uniform for soft woollen trousers and a merino wool jumper when he heard the door bang open, and the room flood with noise.
Pansy and Blaise then went shopping for a few hours, Pansy claiming she was in desperate need for a new outfit for tonight. Harry and Draco made cupcakes, or rather Harry made cupcakes and Draco watched and unhelpfully slapped Harry’s bum whenever it came within arm’s reach. Once they were in the oven, Draco pinned Harry against the counter and snogged Harry within an inch of his life.
There were pictures of Harry and Ron, wet and smiling in swim trunks by a river, Harry and Hermione standing in school uniform with massive backpacks and too-big blazers, more of Harry with Remus or Sirius or both. Pictures of Harry with the grandma that Draco had met.
“come onnnn Harry we haven’t been out in so long and I’m desperate to go on the pull” wheedled Seamus as Harry refused to go clubbing with them in Diagon.
Remus joined them immediately, dropping a kiss to the top of Sirius’ head before sitting down and dragging the plate of scones towards him.
Speaking of, Harry and Ron had wandered around the square and were currently chatting to an elderly woman who was sat knitting and surrounded by little kids munching on what looked to be cucumber sandwiches. As Draco ‘observed’ (spied) he saw a tall, lanky, brown haired boy who looked somewhat greasy slink up behind Harry and Ron, placing his hand on Harry’s forearm. Draco saw Harry and Ron stiffen, and Ron stepped up closer behind Harry, his height making him look surprisingly threatening.
The music held him, spoke to him, soothed him, and so Harry danced. He danced for those he wished he could dance with but never will; Sirius, Fred, Tonks, his parents, his friends. He danced for those he still had, envisioned himself dancing at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, and ultimately, he danced for himself, for the childhood he had lost and the future he was about to gain.
They wandered back to the car, and Sirius knocked on the door of the house they had parked in front of. A tall black woman opened the door, her face set like thunder. She broke out into a smile when she saw Sirius though, and drew him into a crushing embrace.
‘bought four drinks I’m wasted, I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you, at the foot of my bed, if I drink enough’
When at Hogwarts, if we see another pureblood of suitable lineage and wealth, we may stake our claim on them. It is an archaic binding magic, but weak and easily undoable.
“That he is. And of course your friend can stay. I’m sorry Harry hasn’t been more forthcoming but like I said, he probably lumps you in with the people who kicked me out at sixteen, who I’m fairly sure you’ve never even met.”
This was all getting to be a bit too much. He didn’t know what about him warranted him receiving so much of Harry’s attention, but his heart could barely stand it, and now Harry was talking about being mates with Draco’s friends. Even the anxiety coursing through him couldn’t drown out excitement at the prospect.
“Awfully sorry, Peterson. We must be going. Have a good remainder of your night” Harry says stiffly, and immediately begins pulling me away, out of the hall, away from the ball and down the two flights of stairs to the auror department. He pulls me into his office and I flop into his chair.
He dressed hurriedly, and stumbled out of the tent and into the tree line at the edge of the field. He collapsed against the sturdy trunk of a Rowan and tried to hold the tears back. He didn’t know how long he had been there when he saw Potter slowly making his way through the trees towards him. Fuck.
Of course, I don’t remember it’s my claim until months later. The newest Granger-Parkinson initiative is a party. I fail to be impressed. Pansy does the sales pitch of “no Draco, you don’t understand Draco, it’s a muggle party Draco, with games Draco, really cool games Draco, you’ll love it Draco, you have to come Draco, promise me you’ll come Draco, the games involve snogging Draco, and I know someone you’d like to do that with Draco, oh come on Draco, please come Draco, for me Draco, pretty please Draco.”
Draco thought he’d get whiplash from the abrupt subject change, but could tell it was the wrong time to push.
After refreshing his silencing charm, Harry threw his arms up in the air, closed his eyes and in his mind’s eye he was back in a gay club in a backstreet of Barcelona, being spun and romanced by any tall dark and handsome stranger that was closest. His hips swung with the music, head thrown back as the deep, grating voice surrounded him.
When they were precocious fifteen-year-olds who had believed the world was theirs because they had money- though, Draco was sure that the other four still wholeheartedly believed this- they had chosen to drink wine because they had thought it distinguished them from the rest of their cohort; specifically, the rugby boys who got wankered off of beer and Cîroc (because of course, they were all disgustingly rich too).
The Saturday dawned, and Draco awoke to the sounds of yet another song he couldn’t recognise. The beat was uplifting, but the lyrics held a sort of bittersweet regret;
The two other men barely spared a glance at Draco but both said “y’alright, Draco” in perfect unison. They both had long ginger hair pulled into buns at the back of their necks. Bill’s ear was adorned with piercings, and Charlie had strands of hair falling into his face that he kept tucking behind his ear. They looked so similar to Ron, only older, and Draco was confused at how anyone could tell the six boys apart when they were all together, not that he’d met them all yet.
Draco thought about his asexuality. He didn’t see it as a ‘deep dark’ secret, but he was hiding it from people nonetheless. He told Hermione though, which has to count for something, he thinks.
“no Malfoy, you spent new year’s bugging me about a girlfriend I don’t have” teased Harry, enjoying how pink Draco blushed. “that was so rude of me oh my god” he said, muffled by the pillow he had pulled over his head.
“Where’s Remus?” he asked when he had finished eating, surprised as Remus had never once missed a meal since Draco had been there.
“Parkinson, as much as you Slytherins love to think I’m a complete idiot, I do know we don’t have wands. I can do it without one”
“Sirius cordially invites you t’pre-party drinks at t’farm house. Ron’s here, helping Harry bring the table outside” he said, motioning to the house behind him.
“Nana does make it the best” Harry acquiesced a bit coolly, before standing to the side to let Draco through, and walking into the house. Draco walked back to his cottage with his hand covering the shoulder Harry had touched, trying to pretend it hadn’t meant anything.
“I see” was all Draco had time to say before they were scolded for talking, and had to partake in talking about their summer activities. And if Harry speaking French made Draco half-hard, nobody needed to know.  it wasn’t like Draco was ever going to act on it.
“Do you want to tell me about Ron?” Draco asked gently, rubbing his hand up and down her arm. It was weird, doing this comforting thing to someone who wasn't Pansy, but clearly Pans had been good practice, at least Hermione wasn't crying… yet.
And, to his eternal joy, he and Harry chatted almost every day. He had called Harry that first night back to explain what had happened between his mum and Lucius (he wasn’t Father anymore, just Lucius), and now he texted Harry every time he broke one of Lucius’ inane rules, and Harry would respond with teasing encouragement.
“sure Pansy, I can take you out later if you want?” Harry said, “I think Draco is out for the day to be honest.” Pansy gave him one of her rare, genuine smiles.
They looked clumpy and ugly compared to his near skin-tight jeans and thin fitted sweater. The air around him was cool enough for him to gather that it had to be very early in the morning. He dragged himself to the bathroom for a piss and cursory teeth-brushing before he steeled himself for the day ahead and opened the door.
Draco sat up front with Remus. He was somewhat surprised that Harry hadn't wanted that seat, but instead Harry and Hermione sat in the back, chatting quietly whilst Draco talked to Remus, who was rapidly becoming his favourite person. His no-nonsense yet friendly demeanour made Draco feel safe.
Draco is so overwhelmed by the invitation he forgets to protest. Forgets to remind himself that the Gryffindor’s won’t want him at their Christmas. He’s too giddy and it’s all he can do to breathe and say “yeah, okay” before grinning into his pillow like a maniac.
His finger hovered above Harry’s number on his phone. He didn’t know if they were the right kind of friends for this, but he had no one else to talk to, and so he pressed the ‘call’ button.
“You didn’t look like friends last night, Harry. You were all over her” he said, mustering a smirk onto his face. It took an embarrassing amount of effort.
“You handled that very maturely. Who are you and what did you do with my best friend?” Pansy joked, her face turning serious when Draco turned to face her, a strained expression on his face belying his inner hurt.
“Blaise. Stop it now” said Pansy with a sharp look. Harry admired how she brought him to heel so swiftly.
Hermione charmed a muggle speaker to work in our common room, and even I have to admit it’s quite brilliant. I envy muggles for the music they have access to. For some reason, though, the Gryffindor boys have such awful taste- who even is Kanye West and why is he so angry all the time? Though, I can hardly complain when Potter dances in his pyjamas with his friends. I don’t like it when Seamus smacks his arse, and then I catch them snogging in the loos an hour later, though. A deep, intrinsic thing reacts to it with a burst of archaic possessiveness.
“the saviour needing help from a lowly death eater, qu’elle surprise” intoned Draco, bending down to help Harry, nevertheless. Harry frowned and opened his mouth, no doubt about to launch into a spiel about Draco’s redemption arc, lack of choice, blah blah blah but Lovegood beat him to it, “we don’t think you’re a death eater, Draco. Your actions in the war could maybe count as death nibbling though, snacking maybe” she said in that dreamy voice of hers, and it was all Draco could do not to drop Harry with how hard he was laughing. Harry roared a laugh and then winced at the pain it caused, and the two slowly made their way to the hospital wing’s bathroom.
“Seems like quite the crush” she said, winking at him. Draco choked on his hot chocolate, spraying it all over his Egyptian cotton sheets.
He asked Ron to accompany, because Ron had been the one who was always there. Ron knew Harry and his feelings the most. Sirius would just get angry, and Harry wasn’t going to fuel his anger, he was going to seek peace of some sort, even if it was just the peace of knowing that Vernon truly was six feet under, and could never hurt Harry again.
“who’s this, Haz?” Cedric simpered, using the nickname he used to use when they were together. Just at that moment, Luna leant in and kissed him.
Eventually, Draco stopped crying and his breathing evened out. He pulled back a bit from Harry, looking at him and biting his lip in worry. “you- you love me?” he whispered into the darkness.
“Thank you for being there” she whispered to him, before pulling back and saying, “he’s in his room” and heading off to who-knows-where in the massive house.
“It gets worse. When we came back for sixth form Ron had this girlfriend, Lavender. And Lavender hated that Ron used to like me, and would use every opportunity to undermine me. Really nasty stuff, you know? She would insult my appearance, my clothes, and my nerdiness, and Harry noticed and tried his best but Ron was blind to it, you know? He was so wrapped up in her. Eventually, she started saying he wasn’t allowed to see me without her present, but she lived in the same village as the school, which meant Harry was once again stuck between us at home, like on the weekends and stuff.
“Fuck. Oh fuck. Luna, remember I told you about Cedric? Yea that’s him. Shit why is he coming here” Harry groaned. He didn’t want Cedric to ruin the night.
The three sat around the table, eating cake in calming silence. Hermione got up to make a pot of apple tea, which she sweetened with honey. Finally, Harry felt calm enough to face the others, so he loaded a tray with three slabs of cake for them and braved the living room. They were watching the screen with rapt expressions, but when they heard the trio enter, Blaise shot up, barely waiting for Harry to set the tray down before pulling him into a bone-crushing bear hug. Thankfully, he said nothing, just squeezed for long moments before pulling away. Draco thanked him for the cake with a soft, understanding smile which made Harry’s heart squeeze, and then the golden trio went upstairs, all getting into Harry’s bed and curling around him, keeping him safe.
A sleek black BMW pulled up, and Harry stopped talking immediately. Draco was somewhat surprised that it was Harry’s car- he had never indicated a level of wealth close to that of Draco and his friends. He immediately admonished himself for his snobbery, and also remembered that Harry had recently moved to stay with a godfather, who’s financial situation may have been different to Harry’s previous home, not that Draco knew anything about that. Harry was very guarded about it.
“Good riddance, eh?” he says, face grim. He passed the baby to Harry, who immediately felt better with the small boy cradled against his chest. Remus then followed Sirius into the kitchen and he heard low, muted and urgent conversation that steadily rose in volume.
“anyway, club night tonight lads? Blaise and Pansy are back in town and you had fun with them last time, yeah?”
“You’re my cousin?” Draco asked, eyebrows raising in disbelief. His mother had simply told him that it had been arranged for him to spend the summer and autumn with his cousin on a farm. He had assumed the cousin was his age, and the son of an elusive aunt and uncle. Instead, he was faced with a gay couple and a much older man claiming to be his relation.
Draco nodded. “of course, Harry. I’m sorry, about all of this. You were really good with Pansy. I’ve never been good at comfort, especially not so physically. Blaise will want to talk to you about this, just so you know.”
The next day, he had been allowed to lie in, and was awoken by Remus standing outside, telling him he could wear his ‘city clothes’ because they were going to the saint Dunstan’s celebrations. He slides on his most casual jeans and a t-shirt with the logo of his school on that he had intended to use as a pyjama t-shirt, but after his visit to the village yesterday he was aware that his normal clothes would still make him look out of place, so he used the least-posh clothes he could find.
Draco nodded, jaw tight and gripped Harry’s hand back. In unison, they dipped their heads into the cracked bowl of the pensive.
Harry chuckled. “Do you ever give anyone the opportunity to do that, though?” he asked, suddenly looking contemplative.
Oh god. Harry had just told Draco about how he has essentially been with three people all before the age of seventeen, and Draco is going to have to say that he has done nothing. Not even a first kiss- he doesn’t count ‘trying’ with Pansy in year eight- nothing at all.
“Blaise and I have a proposal for these last two years of boyhood. Wine nights are jolly good, don’t get me wrong, but… I can’t help but view them as rather juvenile. I present to you, Nabini whiskey evenings. Much more age-appropriate, don’t we agree?”
With everyone else massively hungover and not in sole custody of a child, Harry and Teddy had many long hours together. They enjoyed a breakfast of warm milk and Weetabix, and Harry even let Teddy have a few sips of his hot chocolate. After breakfast was tummy time, and Harry thoroughly enjoyed watching Teddy fail to lift his head off the ground. They then watched cartoons for the rest of the morning, and Harry’s hands and chest slowly got coated in a thick layer of baby drool.
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of that. I’ll look into it, thank you” Draco said earnestly, wanting to fling his arms around Sirius. In just a few short weeks, Sirius had become to Draco the father he had never had, and now Draco had somewhere to direct all the pent up affection he had once held for his own father.
Draco laughed again. “Maybe this will push her to divorce him. Their marriage was arranged, did you know that? I didn’t, not until this week. God and I bet your parents are so disgustingly in love”
Draco sat on another log about an arm’s length with Harry, and watched him light the joint and inhale deeply, before tilting his head back and blowing smoke up to the sky. That too, was annoyingly sexy and Draco sighed, holding his hand out. Harry passed him and joint and watched with a bemused expression as Draco inhaled deeply, holding the smoke in his lungs for a beat before exhaling it upwards too, cocking an eyebrow when Harry looked surprised.
“Molly’s cakes are God's gift to this earth” Sirius said and everyone around the table nodded vigorously, and Draco was once again struck by the sense of community he had found here. This life was so different to the one he was used to, and while a mere five days ago he thought it was an inferior way of life, he was starting to see that maybe his life, with its lack of true connection and friendship and love was the inferior way. This kitchen held more warmth than his whole childhood had, and Draco found that hard to fit in with his world view.
“What do you know,” he said, some tears spilling onto his cheeks, “Draco hates the Blacks too. I’m not alone against them anymore”
“right” said that same voice from right behind him, as the hand withdrew. “this is as good a place as any; lunch time”.
Draco hesitantly dropped into the seat next to Blaise, tucking into his shepherd’s pie with fervour. He had never seen Theo converse in such a friendly manner with anyone who didn’t come from landed gentry.
She was in a white lace top layered over a sparkly pink t-shirt. She was wearing a pink pleated tulle skirt over a pair of skinny jeans and bright yellow trainers. Her hair was swept up and pinned haphazardly with fake flowers that were a bright yellow that matched her shoes. Some of the boys were staring a bit, but no matter how crazy she looked, Draco had to admit that it suited her very well.
“I thought that went unsaid, mate. I don’t talk to anyone else in our class. Only you, blondie” Harry said. He knew the second sentence was laying it on a bit thick, but he had realised these past weeks that he really genuinely liked Draco, and given that Drao had never really done anything before, Harry was enjoying the modern-style ‘courting’ he was currently doing.
Then the hand moved to his lower back. He turned to Harry bewildered at the intimacy-the possession- of such a touch, but Harry just smiled softly at him and said
“oh dray” sympathised Pansy. Harry didn’t know how to feel, he thought Draco had a surface level physical attraction to him, he didn’t realise it went deeper. He wouldn’t have joined the teasing otherwise. He felt a bit sick as he remembers how he had poked fun too. He felt even more sick when he realised what this meant. Did he even like Draco? He wasn’t sure. He was attractive, but he had been such a prick at school and a few weeks ago. Harry would need more proof that he had really changed.
“I don’t understand why that’s a pipe dream for you, unless you’re hiding a deep dark secret. Of course you’ll find someone who loves all of you”
Somehow though, Harry managed to circle back to Draco just as Draco realised that perhaps he should have slowed down on the drinks four drinks ago, and now only Harry’s arm around his shoulder and Harry’s strong stocky body at his side was keeping Draco standing.
His mention of the morning reminded Draco that he was likely to be expected awake and functional at about four. He groaned and set about brushing his teeth to get ready for bed. He considered sleeping in pants only like he did at home, especially considering the balmy late-spring heat but decided against it. He didn’t need Harry seeing him so close to naked so early on in their acquaintanceship.
“you can hold him normally if you want, but you look terrified so I figured this way would be easier. If you want to hold him against your chest, you have to have one hand cradling his head and neck, and one hand on his bum and lower back. He’s sleepy so he shouldn’t fidget much.” Said Harry, demonstrating the safest way to hold such a young baby.  Draco gingerly picked up the child, before nestling him into his chest and laying his pale cheek against Teddy’s head. “he’s so lovely” whispered Draco, in awe.
“He had to pick something up from the village, he should be back soon. He’s sorry to miss your birthday breakfast” Sirius said. “And I hope you don’t mind, but we’ve taken the liberty of organising a little celebratory get together for tonight? I don’t know how you usually celebrate your birthday and you never mentioned anything but we didn't want to let it pass unmarked” he continued and Draco’s grin split his face apart.
Hermione’s hand shot up, as always, as did Dean’s. “yes miss Granger?” said McGonagall with an amused smile on her face.
Draco returned from a late dinner, and was shocked to find Harry on his bed. He had assumed that due to the nature of the injuries sustained, the weasel would be released first and yet the fiery red hair was nowhere to be seen. Next to him sat Hermione, with red rimmed eyes and dishevelled hair. “it’s fine, ‘mione, I promise. It’s just a tiny infection and he’ll be out before you know it. Stay here with me and Luna, and he’ll be back before you know it.”
Harry spends a lovely morning unashamedly ogling Charlie Weasley as the two set up what used to be Regulus’ bedroom. The two dragged the bed into the middle of the room from the dark cobwebby corner it had been tucked into. Harry found he enjoyed doing these things without magic. Similarly to baking, but more intense, the physical exertion helped calm him as the burning of his muscles became all he could focus on, preventing him from dwelling too long on the previous habitants of the house. They stripped and re-dressed the bed in neutral purple covers, and then scrubbed the shower in the en-suite until it was sparkling. Charlie then occupied Teddy whilst Harry baked an apple cake, before leaving for the burrow, half the cake wrapped up in his bag for Molly and Arthur.
The week before the ball was a flurry of activity. The main hall was kitted out with tables. There was a sit-down dinner, followed by dancing. Trucks bringing champagne came and went from the school’s side entrance, and every conversation overheard in the halls was discussing who was bringing who and whose date was fittest and who would be ‘getting some’ that night.
Well, snog is a better word for it. She took advantage of his open mouth and it was all tongues and spit. Harry quickly cottoned on to what she was doing, and began to kiss her back in earnest, revelling in his chance for revenge against Cedric.
Later that night, Draco heard sniffling and turned to see Harry, hunched over his Iliad, tears pouring down his face.
A few weeks into his new life, Draco gets shaken awake by a frantic looking Harry in the middle of the night.
Soon, Harry was three tequila shots in, loosing himself to Donna Summer, and wishing he could do this every week. Unlike what Draco had insinuated, Harry was greatly desired by muggles and wizards alike. He suspected the mix of dark skin and green eyes, and the fact that he had visible scars made him both attractive and mysterious. The muscles he had gained from fixing the house up, and constantly carrying a baby also helped. The intoxicating sounds of ‘I feel love’ filled him top to toe, and he lost himself to the music. When the song changed, he shouted over the music that Dean and Seamus should crash with him that night, and the two agreed. Seamus soon got absolutely hammered, knowing he was sleeping nearby. The night worked wonders on Harry. The three of them stumbled out of the club at about one, but none of them were ready to go to bed yet. Before he knew what he was agreeing to, he found himself in the chair of a sleazy-looking tattoo shop, while a heavily tattooed woman pushed a needle through his ear, then pushed a small golden hoop through the hole. Seeing the club name stamped onto his hand, and recognising it as gay, she winked at him and said “trust me baby, this will drive the boys wild” before wiping it with anti-septic and shooing the boys out the door, saying that the fun she had had with them whilst stuck on the nightshift was payment enough.
“if you don’t like it Blaise, I can change it.” Harry said, and dug his muggle iPod out of his pocket. Hermione had spelled it so it wouldn’t be affected by the magic of Grimmauld, and he had loads of music. “what mood are you guys in?” he asked.
Luna began unceremoniously stripping with Harry there. She was wearing matching underwear with little radishes on, which was just so Luna that it made Harry smile.
“I don't like strangers,” Harry said plainly, eyeing Draco. “And you’re one of t’strangest of t’lot. Sirius and Remus are the only family I have, and the same goes for them. To have you waltz in ‘ere as if you had some sort o’... deeper connection to Sirius and I just didn’t like you. Didn’t like it. Didn’t like the thought of some posh twat waltzing in and fucking everything up.” here Harry let out a humourless laugh and kept going.
After pondering the issue until his bathwater went cold, he resolved to do it. He would invite her to tea, he thought; Teddy was her family too, and he was Malfoy’s cousin. He could stomach tea with Narcissa and Draco for a few hours for the sake of Andromeda, he thought. Fatherhood had imbued him with a deep sense of patience, which was a shock to all given how quick to temper he had been in years before. He got out of the bath, and dressed himself, before sitting down to write. He still had three more hours of Teddy-free time, which gave him plenty of time to compose his invitation and prepare tea for Andromeda. Baking was another hobby he had picked up post-war. Molly had introduced him, saying that baking the muggle way had always brought her peace in the midst of such a hectic family. She had written all her favourite recipes into a book which she gifted him for his birthday. He had cried upon receiving it, overwhelmed by the time and care it must have taken for her to painstakingly write out each of her recipes for him. He sat at his desk in the little study that was tucked into a corner of the third floor, the only room in which he found any semblance of peace, other than the kitchen when he was cooking.
“I really hope Ron doesn't hate me” Harry sighed, and Draco remembered for the first time that Ginny was Ron’s sister, and that this would inevitably split his loyalties.
“If you would just kiss me Harry, and then try and tell me you don’t like me” Ginny responded, sounding both desperate and obstinate. Draco pitied her as much as he disliked her in that moment. He couldn't help but meanly think that she should preserve her dignity and just walk away, rather than begging for something she had already been denied.
Harry loved music, needed music, lived on music. The summer between second and third year, the Dursleys’ radio broke and he fished it out the bin when no one was looking, hiding it in his cupboard, and at night when the night was silent and the claustrophobia kept him awake, he would lie next to the radio and weep, listening to whatever he could get the failing machine to play. The music soothed and saved him; it kept him going through the long summers of neglect and abuse and starvation, until September first rolled around again.
“I know Sirius” Draco replied simply, and watched Harry’s brow furrow, guilt flashing across his face.
Luna immediately landed on Botany and scratched her name under it. Hermione settled on history, English and politics- no surprise there. Harry pondered the list, before settling on classical civilisation and French. When he passed the sheet and quill to Draco, the blond almost caused an inkblot when he saw Harry’s name under his beloved subject, but signed up nevertheless.  He could not control his shock, however when he saw that Harry had signed up for French. “you speak French?” he blurted out before he could stop himself.
