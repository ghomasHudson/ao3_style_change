Ginny came in as he was eating, red-faced and hair wild from a flight. “Malfoy’s here.”
makes him want to puke. “So, so many things to know. So many questions I had in school. Like just how exactly you always seemed to know where to find me, and how you got around the castle the way you did. But that’s really old news now. There’s all that juicy speculation in the
Malfoy huffed. “Well, come in, then. An apology from Harry Potter. I should be comfortably sitting for this. If I faint, don’t bother with a
A number of younger twenty-somethings sat with their laptops at the wooden tables, along with a few older people reading newspapers. The art on the walls depicted coffee beans in bright colors, flowers in shades of grey, and photographs of old brown cloth sacks and antique farm equipment. At the far end of the shop, a large open threshold led into a back area littered with big steel machines that he guessed were used to prepare food.
“I didn’t,” Harry said again, even as he placed the wrapped gift on Draco’s lap. It was rectangular, slim, and vaguely lumpy, having defied Harry’s attempts to keep it as flat as possible. Though, he supposed it added to the charm of the thing.
They made their way back through the woods. Harry caught the occasional whiff of carrion. Once, something large—several large somethings—crashed through the brush out of sight.
“And would you be willing to swear all of this under veritaserum?”
“Sure thing,” said the woman with the purple-streaked hair. She slammed the change drawer into the till, ripped the receipt from it, and handed it to the customer in front of Harry, then slid around Malfoy to disappear into the back of the shop.
“Yeah. You’re welcome.” Without thinking, he uses a charm to collect the teacups and put them into the sink, and that little bit of magic takes his breath. Fuck, he hates this. Back to square one. Again. Malfoy is still watching him, this time with a different sort of expression, and Harry says, “Don’t say a thing.”
At last, Hermione straightens and pushes back wayward strands of hair.
“I don’t get it. You opened a Muggle coffee shop with charmed decorations under illusion but have a completely Muggle back kitchen.”
Harry had another night of interrupted sleep, but this time he had a broom with which to fly over the countryside by night. He relished the dark rush, the chill air streaming around him. He woke again around dawn, tired and desiring coffee. Ginny announced that she would be happy to Apparate him to Portland on her way to the college, handed him a non-magical credit card, and told him he could find coffee in the city. He said sure, and Ginny took him via Side-Along to an empty alley. Then he asked her where his best bet was for finding coffee, and she only snorted at him before Disapparating, which he found frustrating until he wandered onto the street and saw the number of coffeehouses.
“I’ll leave this hospital anyway,” he warns. “You can’t stop me.”
“Yes, I can show you my etchings.”
me,” Harry said.
“If you touch a thing, Potter, so help me. Your piece of paper is not a search warrant, and you and I both know it.”
in its direction. He’d have to remember to replace the spell, or he’d have to waste another hour casting drying and dampening charms to get the soil back to the optimum level of moisture.
“What’s this about?”
“Sorry, Ginny. It was one of the eggs.”
“Oh?”
“Don’t— Don’t stop.”
Harry grinned at that. “Hey. Would you, um.” He scratched the back of his head. He was smiling hugely, and he had no idea why or how to stop. “Would you like to get together tomorrow? I’ll meet you after work.”
“It’ll be easier to show you,” Malfoy says, turning, and once again, Harry finds himself following him down the corridor, hesitating a moment before taking the stairs behind him. Malfoy leads him into a study on the second floor. The room has a large desk against the wall at one end and books and papers set everywhere, in piles and spreads.
“Most likely.”
“But what are they doing? Are they…?” Harry couldn’t make himself say what it looked like they were doing.
His mind drifted to walking on the beach at dusk. He could smell the salt spray, could see the bright points of the bonfires and Malfoy’s darker form against the deep purple of near-dark. Could feel the way his body cut the wind, creating a calm for Harry to walk in.
Harry thought it strange that Malfoy hadn't amounted to something...greater with his life. A politician, maybe, or—oh, he didn't know
And broke into a smile.
He crossed the train tracks into the more industrial-looking neighborhood with its equipment supply and repair shops. His stomach tightened. He stopped at a corner to read a metal plaque on a building’s wall, something about it being a historical landmark. (The idea of a 20th century building being historical still baffled him.)
Harry couldn’t look away.
“Of course she is.”
“You were pretty cheerful yesterday for someone who didn’t get much sleep.”
he’d said) because Draco had never let that go, not in the years that had passed.
“Potter,” Robards snaps.
Evening had fallen by the time he arrived in the attic, damp with sweat and hand tired from clutching the legal pad all day. He leaned in the doorway and looked in at the piles of junk. After being attacked by an almanac, nearly unleashing a deadly gas, and almost walking into a void, chucking a bunch of old stuff seemed…doable.
Harry and Ginny snarling over the kitchen table. “Harry, where the hell have you been? It’s one in the morning.”
“Binns! I didn’t realize you had a thing for history.”
“What’s
“I didn’t ‘retreat’ from the aurors,” Harry says, scowling. “You’re right. Here I am. Fully present.”
“I will, but you’d better watch your ice cream.”
“Uh.” Harry looked from his right to his left, to the scores of yellow and green and blue eyes staring at him from inside picture frames.
The truth is, a part of him regrets the decision. Sometimes, in his darker moments, he thinks he ought to have let the curse hit Alex as intended, or at least tried the shield charm. Then he immediately feels guilty and pulls back the thought. But it always lives there, lodged beneath his heart, like something small and flat and hard-shelled that lives beneath a rock. It’s not like ending up in a desk job would have hurt Alex in the long run. It would have got him out of the field; it would have been better for his family. And Harry could still be out there, doing the one thing he’s good at. The one thing he’s useful at.
Four years. Malfoy had owned a coffee shop in Oregon for four years, and had likely been friends with Luna and Ginny for that long, and Harry hadn’t known. He had been absorbed in his own life. Suddenly, he felt like life and the world had passed him by while he was stuck in the Auror office on repeat, day in and day out. He couldn’t even remember anything that stood out about the last four years. It didn’t feel like that much time had passed.
They turned onto a wider road and picked up speed. Golden fields and sprays of white flowers flew by. Almost like flying with Malfoy again, except they moved the same speed, and it was bright out, and Malfoy was the one steering, and Harry was okay with that.
Harry faced disciplinary action. The Unspeakables didn’t take kindly to the maltreatment of their own. Not that Harry could have known Malfoy was an Unspeakable. Robards argued this fact, argued that it was stupid to have kept the knowledge from Harry in the first place. It was irresponsible and reckless, and if Robards had been able to tell Harry as he’d originally argued, then they wouldn’t be in this predicament now.
Light flooded down into the courtyard beyond and gleamed off the leaves of trees and potted flowers and bushes and vines that climbed up the walls of the building toward the sun above. A fountain tinkled merrily in the center of the courtyard, though it was hardly audible under the din of voices, laughter, and music. Harry recognized strains of “You Should See Me in My Robes” by Billie Wixish.
Draco was the one who’d thought of making a gift for Teddy that held memories Teddy could relive and enjoy for the rest of his life and even pass on to his own children, if he had any. Harry suspected Draco had got the idea from a conversation they’d had late one night about Harry’s lack of pleasant Christmas memories from early childhood. They’d both been a little drunk at the time, and Harry had waxed poetic about how he wanted Teddy to have something nicer to look back on. A few days later, as they worked on their Christmas gift list—Draco was always very organized about these things—Draco suggested making some kind of memory record for Teddy.
Malfoy takes it carefully but doesn’t open it. “Thank you.”
Those went into the oven in a dizzying pattern that Harry was just starting to get a hang of. He had just maneuvered the last of the trays into the oven when Malfoy cast a Tempus above him. It was already nearly six in the morning.
He knocked, feeling like an arse. A minute passed. And another.
“Really, Potter. I would say nothing in here bites, though that would be a lie. Nothing in here bites if you don’t want it to. That’s a
“What? I’m glad for you, Harry. How long has it been since you’ve checked out someone’s larder?”
Harry clenches his jaw. When he refuses to say anything, Hermione continues, taking a deep breath.
Malfoy gave him another suspicious look but moved on down the hallway.
“It looks like the tree has been here for years. How long has it been sick?”
The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand up. It’s not like he hasn’t heard Malfoy say his name in that tone before, but now it’s wrong, all wrong.
“No worry,” Draco said. The rain was still coming down. His fringe stuck to his forehead in flat locks. His sleeves clung to his arms. He was shivering again. “I can even come by later and do it myself.”
“Ah…”
. Malfoy’s lost some of his pointiness, too, and Harry feels a different kind of pang at that.
Harry didn’t need legilimency to read Draco. He smirked and held out a hand. “Well?”
“Yes! It’s been a dry summer. Would you like to help Ginny and me levitate her a little later? We do that sometimes. So she can feel like she’s flying. She’ll water the fields for us. But maybe you’d like a nap first.”
“Er, thanks,” Harry says as he takes the proffered plate. There is not enough room for it on the table with the platter of food and Malfoy’s own plate, so he has to place down the tea in order to balance it on his knees. The strawberries shine ruby red and smell of sugar and sunshine. The shortcake is crumbly, and its scent rounds off the fragrance of the ripe berries with a sweet nuttiness. The fresh cream gleams white in its saucer. Harry doesn’t know how to tell Malfoy that he can’t eat. His stomach is twisted into a knot.
Harry resisted shoving his hands into his pockets. “Hey, Malfoy. I came to see how you were doing.”
Really, Haystack Rock was barely visible in the gloom, but Harry liked it that way. He liked the stars above and the sounds of the surf, and Malfoy—barely visible—standing next to him.
Harry spends time cleaning his kitchen. Pulls up weeds in his garden. But his thoughts keep straying to Malfoy. He wonders what Malfoy does on a Saturday. He probably does something worthwhile, like reading through stacks of books and government documents and serving himself shortcake and strawberries with tea while he puts it all together. Unlike Harry, who’s done nothing with his life since defeating Voldemort, and even that was kind of by accident.
Malfoy remarked as he watched Harry fall apart after casting
It took a moment for Harry to find the trays in question. Meanwhile, Malfoy Summoned dry ingredients from their containers and cast weighing charms and set them to mix in bowls. Harry pulled out the trays and figured out the charms that let him see the amount of time that the dough had been allowed to rise until the Stasis Charm kicked in, which made him feel good.
Ginny opened her mouth to reply, then paused, and a strange expression came over her face. She thumped her chest, frowned, and let out a loud burp and three pink bubbles.
It appears in his inbox a few minutes later, and he sourly notes that they had no trouble getting
, Harry wants to say to the back of Malfoy’s head.
“Mind if we make some tea, love?” Ginny asked, and pressed a kiss to the side of Luna’s head as she reached for the kettle.
Since he’d returned home, he’d been subjected to questions from the whole family about his trip. It seemed that almost everyone else had already been to Oregon, and they’d asked after Ginny and Luna and the farm. But this was the first time he was sitting down with Hermione and Ron alone to talk about his visit.
“Yes, really! Is that the only response you have? And what do you care, anyway? Why would you give a flying gnome’s arse about a bunch of squib muggleborns who will never know what they could have had?”
Malfoy’s gaze searches his briefly. His voice lowers to a menacing hiss. “I suggest you ask more questions of the Ministry before you barge in here demanding them of me. But you won’t like the answers. If you still feel like bandying them about, by all means, schedule an interview. I’ll be ready with my solicitor, and I’ll be glad for the whole wizarding world to hear about it. Absolutely delighted.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, and Harry turned to find himself nose-to-nose with him in the narrow space. Malfoy wasn’t quite smiling, but the corners of his eyes crinkled almost as if he were. “Pay attention.”
Malfoy was propped up in his bed, reading a magazine. He’d removed his shoes and socks, but those were the only things. Something about seeing his pale, knobby feet while the rest of him was clothed made Harry’s mouth go dry.
The door, he notices distantly, clicks shuts.
They parted, and she smiled up at him. “We’re so glad to have you here, Harry. It’s really nice that you finally have the time.”
“Makes sense,” Harry murmured.
“What do you suggest?” Harry asked now.
Draco drew himself up. “Of course.”
“If you’d like,” Harry said through gritted teeth, “I can ask the shop owner if he has the hat you’re looking for.”
“Light. Bitter. I like it.”
Malfoy shouted something. When Harry glanced up, Malfoy was looking at him. He shouted again, but Harry couldn’t hear. That was fine. Let him shout. Harry was getting ahead.
“Thanks,” he said, gruffly.
“I think I can keep all that straight.”
“Behold,” Malfoy said, as he slid the car into a parking spot.
Malfoy looks at the drink in his own hand and then back at Harry. “Of course. Fancy
“You— What?”
“Not the bravest,” Draco whispered. “How does that make you feel?”
Teddy had drawn something vaguely crude on the bracelet, the off-beat humor of the 12-year-old son of Tonks and Remus. Harry smiled to see it, and then frowned. That hospital visit had been the only time he’d seen Teddy in the last three months.
“Oh yeah?”
“I need to get to the shop before it closes,” he said. Actually, what he needed was air—and time away from Potter to think.
Harry thought that, perhaps, he might not touch anything for the rest of the night—or as long as he continued to feel the ghost of Malfoy’s tight, denim-clad flesh against his palms, which might be forever. Doomed never to use his hands again. Happily doomed.
Harry’s mouth twitches into a smile. “So tell me. What should we do?”
“What the fuck?”
Draco, suddenly lightheaded, said, “Just fine.”
“Do your worst,” he murmurs.
The house was empty when he returned to the farm. It was just past lunchtime, and he knew Luna and Ginny had a lot of work to do fixing some Disillusionment Charms around the forest before a non-magical group arrived. He put the beers in the fridge, hesitating a moment before taking the Daydream Doppelbock. Ginny and Luna didn’t expect him back till dinnertime, which meant he had some hours to kill. That, and he was still slightly tipsy from the beer-tasting—and he was curious.
“You did.”
“‘Phone number’? ‘Gotten’?” he said. He stolidly ignored Malfoy’s gaze, which he felt prickling the side of his face.
Luna’s sweet voice carried on the breeze. Harry felt a little guilty. He had been singing with her until Malfoy and Parkinson arrived. She hadn’t seemed fazed when he asked if he could stand back and watch the rest, though he still felt bad.
Draco spluttered. “Congenital!”
“Oh, I’m sorry. You’re right. There are
a good person, I’m going to do you a favor.”
Harry was following Malfoy. Not too far, not
the bruise blooming on his cheek and hip, but he accepted the hand Edward offered. He stopped himself just short of brushing off his trousers—his
—and safeguarded Luna’s feelings and ran a Muggle coffee shop. No, Harry wasn’t innocent of having his own preconceived notions about Malfoy. They had a lot of history. And for someone who apparently still believed Harry was an arrogant attention-seeker, Malfoy was exhibiting remarkable civility.
The cottage door opens for him as easily as his own. He takes off his shoes and drops them next to Draco’s neat line of brogues. He follows the smells and sounds of cooking into the kitchen.
Right. “So. Um. Stand to face me. Thanks.”
“Well, it’s just— You’re the investigator on this case.”
“Oh, my god. Get out of the doorway, you two.”
Malfoy’s gaze flicked over Harry’s face. “You’ve clearly got better taste in eyewear. But your hair is as atrocious as ever.”
Harry half expects another mocking comment from Malfoy. Instead, the other man only places the letters into Harry’s hand, his eyes hard. For a moment, Harry can’t look away. Then he unfolds the first letter and skims it. A frisson of alarm runs up his arms and neck, though he isn’t sure what he’s looking at. Some kind of formal request for documents, which goes on for pages. He flips through the letters, recognizes the Ministry seal on all of them.
“Nothing,” he said, and screwed the lid back onto the salve.
“Pansy!” Malfoy hissed. He snatched his hat back and jammed it on his head. “I meet plenty of people all day.” He said it as if it were a joke, but there was an edge to his tone.
Malfoy frowned.
“Brulee caramel, extra whip,” said the woman with the purple streaks, and set a mug in front of Harry. The mug was roughly the size of a small soup bowl, and there were lemon zest shavings on top of the whip as well as a narrow shortbread biscuit. “And a Black Forest sandwich.”
“Hey, Hermione. Can I come through?”
He finished his own broom, and with one more he had finished the row. He looked back at all of the brooms, which gave off a faint aura of fresh magic, and was surprised at how fast he’d gone through them.
“My legal counsel is prepared,” Malfoy puts in dryly.
“Too many good things to choose from,” Harry said, with a tight smile. Malfoy’s elbow was nearly touching his on the table, but he felt like if he moved it away, the movement would be too obvious. “Luna, would you order for me?”
“Nice of you to join us again.”
Harry stared into the mug at the fractured reflection there. “Malfoy—” He swallowed dryly.
Earlier that evening, Harry had invited Ron and Hermione over. Since Hermione was busy, Ron came over himself. He brought a Chinese takeaway and a treacle tart from Molly. A sense of déjà vu gripped Harry.
She gave a curt nod. “He wants us to hold Malfoy for questioning.”
‘Sickle Leaf.’”
Ginny did indeed have a broom he could borrow, and he spent the rest of the afternoon flying over the farm and over the same forest he’d walked through, and beyond, to a river that ran shimmering and cool. The air and the terrain still felt different from England’s, but in a pleasant and fresh way. He felt like a different person outside the dark walls of Grimmauld, with the bright open sky around him. With his feet dipped into the river, feeling the current of the water, he had to admit that Ron had been right: a break from the house was what he had needed.
A bolt of inspiration struck him, and he broke away to spiral high, high up—far above the balls of light, high enough that he was out of their light. From there, he could see the stars clearly. They surrounded him all the way down to the horizon in every direction he looked—as if he were in space.
“Dragonologist.”
And then there’s Bate, who Harry never liked or trusted; the sentiment is mutual.
Harry came to awareness again when the car slowed down. They turned onto a small side road. The car tires crunched over gravel.
“And sabotage,” Harry puts in.
Harry stumbled, folding the dough in the wrong direction and pushing too hard. He felt Malfoy’s disapproving look and reshaped the dough into a ball.
Malfoy was standing close enough that Harry could smell the scent of coffee coming from him—the scent of
Harry pulled his hand away (he could still feel Malfoy’s warmth against his fingers) and scowled. “Yeah, I fly. It’s not the same as this.”
Draco kissed him. Deeply, this time. He slipped his tongue in, caressed him.
Harry blinked. Wasn’t that what Draco was already doing? But he nodded.
“Don’t say a thing,” he said.
“If by ‘stay out of it’ you mean not make any more brash demonstrations without consulting me first, then yes, Potter.”
, the
Malfoy glanced at the digital clock. “An hour, plus the half hour I waited for you.”
“Do you want Hills to go with you?”
, Harry. But you’ll have to do
“Er, I can’t consume anything,” Potter said. When Draco turned to blink at him, he added, “I’m incorporeal.”
“Hermione,” Malfoy says in return, inclining his head.
Harry peeled back the sandwich’s flaky bread to see what kind of frilly thing passed for breakfast here. There was the ham with some kind of white cheese on top, flecked with green specks and a drizzle of sauce. There were no pickled carrots this time. Instead, there was a hash made with some kind of purple veg and onions. He tucked in.
Over Hermione’s head, Harry and Malfoy exchange an amused glance.
“I’m engaged in an investigation on you!”
After that, he put Harry on customer duty.
“Harry James Potter. Are you
“Which one is that?” Harry asked, and took a gulp from Ginny’s glass.
“Yes. All right. I’m going to grab a few references and see if we can’t begin to identify what kind of potion they used on you.”
He strolled around the side of the counter and met Harry’s gaze with a lazy expression, which was when Harry realized that Malfoy had known he’d been watching the entire time. His heart flip-flopped.
Harry found himself glancing frequently at Malfoy and jiggling his leg as he flipped through books. “How are these?” he asked when they met in the middle of the bookcase. To Harry’s surprise, he’d actually gone through more of the books than Malfoy had, but that may have been because Malfoy had spent time flipping through indices and poring over the pages. Meanwhile, Harry had picked the books that looked more impressive—the older books, those that were dense with text and large words, and those with authors that had long strings of letters after their names.
The dream of Malfoy cracked and fell away. He had a hand around his cock and his trousers half pushed down over his legs.
Harry knew Malfoy was being a tosser, but he couldn’t help but smile back. Malfoy was wearing one of the hats, after all—the baseball cap—which was absurd because it was a
He looks aside, throws a hand out, grabs the first book he touches. Opens it on his lap and pretends to have been perusing the literature the entire time. Malfoy doesn’t say anything, and Harry doesn’t look up again.
Except this time, Harry’s feet were bare and sinking into the wet sand. The wind tousled his hair. Malfoy was close enough that Harry could feel the warmth of him at his side. Their knuckles brushed, once, unintentionally. Harry made them brush again, this time deliberately. When Malfoy did not pull away, Harry slipped their hands together. Malfoy’s was warm and dry. His longer fingers parted to thread with Harry’s.
“It’s all right, Potter. Really. There’s nothing more— What
charm with my solicitor present?”
Malfoy glanced at the ceiling, perhaps praying for patience. Then he shook his head.
Luna waited for him near the edge of the forest and the Erumpent’s field, next to the faint oil sheen of the wards. She had told Harry that the wards kept anything not human from passing—mainly the Erumpent, though it limited the traffic of non-magical creatures, as well. Apparently, the Erumpent did not take kindly to coyotes and goats wandering into its field.
The music soared. Some kind of classical piece. It lent a ridiculous grandeur to the moment. And it
“Maybe… Once or twice.”
Now, Harry let the foot traffic sweep him further down the street—past a bicycle shop with a unicycle in the front window—before he stopped, turned, and walked into a coffee shop at random.
“Oh, they’re quite normal on farms with turkeys on them. They taste a bit like turkey, the same way duck eggs taste a bit like duck and chicken eggs taste a bit like chicken. Did you ever notice that?”
Draco smirks. Then he says, “I have something for you.”
“Looks like you’re getting ready to plant,” Edward said, stepping out into the garden behind Draco.
Malfoy sniffed.
It takes Harry a moment to understand that Robards wants him to go through all of the surveillance information.
Anyway. He’d long given up trying to guess what significant event was going to take place when he felt this way. He used to spend half the day trying to figure it out, only to be wrong and be surprised anyway.
Inside the brown picket fence, the grounds are well-maintained. No peacocks strut over the lawn, but the grass and bushes are manicured, and the low hedges along the path are cut straight enough to measure by. The flowerbeds are a bit overgrown, but even that’s in an artful, intentional manner. The house itself is a storybook cottage of faded bricks, red and brown roof shingles, diamond-shaped window panes, and frilly embellishments painted pale green. Ivy consumes half the house and creeps up the chimney stack.
So Alex hasn’t mentioned it again, but he still stops by the office when he’s in from the field, and Harry doesn’t mind, strangely enough. He likes Alex. If he didn’t, he wouldn’t have jumped in front of a curse for him.
Harry plucked a pear from an open cardboard box. Raised an eyebrow at Malfoy. Tasted it. Frowned.
Luna broke it herself. “Well. I think it’s nice that you’re getting to know each other.”
He opened his mouth to tell the cashier what he wanted, then realized that his usual drink order—with its mound of whipped cream and candied lemon zest—would not make for a good to-go beverage.
Harry nodded, properly chastised.
Harry did. A moment later, he felt the prickle of an unexpected Cleaning Charm, and squawked. Then Malfoy’s tongue was on him again, and Harry’s protest was forgotten. Malfoy traced around the base of Harry’s cock and nipped his way to the crease of Harry’s inner thigh, pausing to murmur things like, “The sounds you’re making—you’re desperate for it, aren’t you?” and “I can’t wait to taste you properly.” They sounded almost conversational, almost like Harry should reply—but Harry could only remember the words “
“Well… It wasn’t ever something that came up.”
They put him together again. For fun.
“Luna?”
“Yes. With affection.”
“Yes,” Luna said. “That’s my favorite part.”
“Knew it. You were practically glowing yesterday.”
“That’s very thoughtful of you,” he managed at last. “It’s good to see you.”
He is still standing there when the three of them return a quarter of an hour later. By then, he’s had time to process his own shock at the situation, so he’s aware enough that he can recognize the pinch of anxiety around Malfoy’s mouth when Hills announces his intention to search the rest of the ground floor.
“What?” Harry said, cautiously.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and twirls his wand. A snifter of brandy sails to Harry. Harry sits in the chair opposite Malfoy and takes a drink. He tries not to make a face—hard liquor’s never really been his thing, he’s more of a cider man—but must not entirely succeed, because Malfoy smirks over the rim of his glass.
Malfoy’s touch as Malfoy moved his hands away. Even well-marinated, he knows saying that would be a bad idea.
“Actually—yeah.”
“Mm. Yeah.” He smiled languidly at Malfoy. “Definitely liked that.”
Harry’s tension blooms into anger. “What do you mean by that?”
the only person allowed to take you down.”
That was enough to settle his nerves and his stomach, and Hermione practically force-fed him soup and bread and his favorite cheese. She didn’t ask him what was wrong, only sat by until he’d finished the meal and then escorted him to bed and pressed another potion on him, a draught of dreamless sleep.
Harry looked up from the gulls. “You sound just like Molly.”
Malfoy glances at him with a twitch of his mouth. “No one, except for the important people in the room.”
Malfoy gives him a once-over and wrinkles his nose. “You’re filthy.”
Maybe it was the lazy energy of the day, maybe it was the salt water, maybe it was the food or the soothing rumble of the car, but Harry found himself falling asleep as he watched the scenery pass by.
. But he doesn’t have to. The echo of them is there between them, and this time, Harry knows that Malfoy hears it, too.
“Yes,” Potter said, without hesitation.
Harry bristles, then his mouth forms an O. “Muggleborns.”
Malfoy’s eyes flickered. “Cretin.” He produced a napkin, smoothed it out, and handed it to Harry. It was still warm from Malfoy’s pocket when Harry used it.
means. You must have learned that one from Granger.”
They went down the street to an unassuming little ice cream shop with the strangest flavors Harry had heard of. Strawberry balsamic and peppercorn. Chocolate stout brownie. Maple and bacon buttermilk pancake. Lavender tangerine and rose water. Olive oil.
Malfoy launched into a knowledgeable discourse about the menu items, which Harry didn’t pay complete attention to. Really, he’d just wanted to get Malfoy talking again. Malfoy had opinions about everything, and he shared them in such a snide way. Even better, Malfoy appeared to have little clue how funny he was at times, and fixed Harry with a glare every time Harry chuckled at something he said.
Ginny stared at him. “So. Lift. Them.”
“Oh,” he said, looking around.
The pieces came together, and the revelation shook him.
“Malfoy expects you at four at the shop. Enjoy your day!”
Malfoy scrutinizes him, tapping his long fingers on the tea cup. “So when you cast powerful spells, you can’t breathe.”
Lately, they’d begun to post disillusioned aurors outside every suspected illegal brewery location. It was a 24-hour operation, with the aurors taking shifts. A resource-intensive endeavor, and not guaranteed to yield results. At least, not before resources dried up or the head of the DMLE questioned the success of the tactic.
A long moment of silence passed.
Draco slid into him. Harry lay back, his defenses down. His heart thudded in his chest. Draco was in him completely, he could stop it beating if he wanted.
are carved beneath.
Draco put his quill down. “And just what is that supposed to mean, Potter?”
That left two colors, green and blue—but there were only three of them altogether.
Harry’s face heated. “Merlin, Malfoy. And you were asking me what I do to books when no one’s looking?”
All thoughts fled. Draco’s mouth was hot and wet and teeth and sucking.
They had half the dough folded, and the timed Stasis Charms set on the individual balls, when Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly.
“What’s that?” Edward said.
Alex stands in the door, looking vaguely chagrined like he has since their last assignment together—Harry’s last assignment in the field. It wearies Harry, but it’s better than the wary and pitying looks he gets from the others—though the pity has mostly faded into a vague contempt.
Now thoroughly confused, Harry said, “Can you talk?”
part of the house primed for surprise muggle visits, and with the arrival of spring, he’d been spending every nonrainy moment outdoors—and even some of the rainy ones, as well, with an umbrella charm—and thus the cottage was unusually cluttered.
He’d never fucked a man before, and while Harry reckoned the mechanics of it were similar enough, he felt a great urge not to hurt Malfoy, to do it right—to make him feel good.
“Harry!”
been comforted by his own friends and adopted family. All the while, Malfoy was probably laughing at him.
“Oh, come off it,” Harry says, but he holds his hand out anyway.
Harry calmed his voice. “It belonged to my godfather. Sirius.” His throat was suddenly tight. “He left it to me.”
Then Harry stepped back, a touch sheepish. Malfoy only blinked at him, didn’t say anything.
In the quiet office, he flipped another page of the report.
“To be fair, that job alone will probably take the next five years, at least,” Ginny said.
A lazy smile spreads on Malfoy’s face. “Oh, tempting.” But then the smile subsides, and he says, “But what I really want to know is, why did you come back that second day? To deliver the summons, I know. But why did you really come?”
“I think maybe one more night for observation. How does that sound to you?”
To Draco’s relief and dismay both, the old man turned his attention back to the plants.
“What the hell, Malfoy? A little light reading?”
There is a collective shuffling sound in the courtroom. Shacklebolt says, “And then what, Mr. Malfoy?”
“What?”
“Harry,” Hermione says, biting her bottom lip. He can’t meet her beseeching gaze. “Harry. We couldn’t tell you now, could we? You’re on an official investigation into Draco!”
Ginny snorted. So did Malfoy. It was like he got the sound in stereo; they had similar expressions on their faces, too.
Harry drummed his fingers. “But you can’t talk.”
“Cookies.”
Harry blinked at her. She smiled and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
“Wait. Malfoy isn’t here, is he?”
“So,” he says. “That’s what you missed.”
She looks at Harry. “No one saw you access these files, did they?”
“The land
been there for the wrong sort of business, he could have put anything down in the registry, and his contact person in the Ministry would vouch for him.) Harry could have tracked down who in the Ministry is involved. He could have maintained access to Ministry records. Could have pulled Hills aside and learned more about the search, maybe talked him into keeping Harry abreast of other angles of investigation on Malfoy. Harry could have talked with Robards himself about his own suspicions about the activity against Malfoy.
“I—” He blinked away the vivid memory of Malfoy gazing at him from his place in bed, eyes guarded as Harry grasped his forearm.
“Some things never change,” Harry heard distinctly in his ear, repeated by the charm.
Steepling his fingers, Shacklebolt says, “Be that as it may, even if he were to give us his testimony under veritaserum, we are left with a conundrum. Two separate truths.”
Harry murmured the incantation Ginny had taught him to wake the practice Snitch and then released it. It glinted once in the glow of a floating orb before blinking out of sight.
“Yes. I was hardly going to stand around when someone apparated onto the scene.”
It was clear from Robards’s tone and expression that he did not want Harry for the position, and to be honest, neither did Harry. Twelve years had not improved Harry’s attitude towards paperwork, but more importantly, it hadn’t improved his tolerance of office and Ministry politics. Once upon a time, he’d dreamed of becoming Head Auror and reforming the division, but twelve years of ignored recommendations for improvements, declined budget requests, and grinding overtime had cured him of his fantasy.
“How was the Portkey?” Ginny asked.
“Poesy Potions? As in, ‘Poetry. Perfection. Poesy’?”
There is no reason for Harry to start guiltily when someone raps lightly at his door, but he does, slamming closed the book in his hands.
He took a sniff. “Smells…herbal.”
They dropped through the night sky, toward the floating lights and the winking Snitch.
Malfoy settles back in his seat. “Some background may help. I’ll give this to you for free because I doubt even you can find any nefarious intentions in my recent employment history. As you surmised, I was faculty at Gnosis University. Research faculty. I was working on a proposal to study the differences in brewing practices between traditional single-cauldron brews and potions made in tanks. Considering Poesy is the first mass manufacturer of potions, I was up to my ears in their manufacturing processes. I became especially interested in how they disposed of their waste materials and byproducts.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry watching. He gazed off toward the horizon. Then his gaze met Harry’s.
Back in the sitting room, he set the chest on the table and smoothed a hand over its top. His mouth was dry. He lifted the lid.
“What?”
“One of them gave me your information and suggested that you might be able to help. And I thought: I’m desperate enough.”
“Oh. Thanks. That’d be nice, actually.”
Malfoy gives a smile part wan, part self-deprecating. “That she is.” He clears his own throat and raises his voice. “To Hermione Granger.”
It’s the CEO of Poesy Potions.
“No,” Draco said, slowly. He’d just…never met a complete lack of resistance from Potter before, and it threw him. But to say that would make him sound mad. He gave himself a little shake. Then, seeing Potter’s curious look, he remembered he wasn’t alone anymore. He felt his face flush. He grabbed the quill and looked down at the document. “Good. Sign here.”
“What? You weren’t. Still aren’t. You won just now, didn’t you?”
She smiled.
It was a
“Stakes, Potter. What did you Gryffindors play for?”
He steps into the room. Many books still line the shelves. Whoever cleaned the study out didn’t remove everything. That makes the entire scene more frightening.
, Harry wanted to say, but Malfoy looked too sincere standing there with his hands hooked in his pockets, gazing down at the city.
“In Oregon.”
Malfoy had begun to lower his lit wand, so Harry couldn’t see his expression.
. I think I have never seen you so red.”
“I’m better at it now. I can add proper sounds to it.”
“Maybe I want to poison you.”
, he stops himself from saying.
She snorted, and they Summoned the basket and the potatoes off the floor.
“Yes. Yeah. Of course.” And he’ll punch the git for nearly giving his best friend a stroke when he finds him in his study with his back to the door.
Harry had nothing to say to that, only held Draco tighter to his side. Draco tensed at first, then relaxed.
She glanced up as he approached and broke into a smile. “Hi, Harry.”
Malfoy threw back his head and laughed.
“I’m touched.”
“It’s a load of bollocks. I know it is. I saw his research papers, and I saw the evidence in the Ministry’s public records myself. But Harry—you and I are the only ones who have.”
He sat with his drink and some kind of puff pastry horn with almonds. He didn’t
“Voracious scoundrel.”
“The living room,” he said, with a wave of his hand toward the sitting room. “The kitchen,” he said as he continued on, with a wave of the other hand. “Gas stove. Brushed steel. Behold and salivate.”
Harry watched the coffee pot fill, then he poured himself a cup and stepped into the back garden, the only place—besides his bedroom, which hadn’t changed much—that felt at all like home. The vines and bushes had been cut back severely during the Weasley clan’s occupation, though Arthur hadn’t come back yet to prune the trees, so the whole thing had a feeling of being simultaneously cultivated and feral.
Harry suppresses a grimace. “What can I do for you, sir?”
Harry was annoyed at this—but also grateful because it perked Luna up.
“You’re going to be the death of me.”
Harry ignored them and took a drink. He grimaced. “That is not beer.”
When he is sure that Robards has gone into his own office for the morning, he slips down the hall and into the lift to the canteen with the help of a notice-me-not charm. He’s getting quite good at skulking around the office, he muses. Of course, when he gets to the canteen (and when he remembers to lift the notice-me-not after failing to capture the attention of the severe-looking attendant), Harry finds that he has no appetite, so he orders the least offensive thing on the menu—a cheese toastie—and takes it back to his office with a cup of strong tea.
“No, I mean…” And he waves his hands at Harry.
“I think you must put something in your coffee.”
It was after three. He’d been helping Luna for hours. He skipped the shower, Apparated straight to the alley as-is, and walked briskly to the shop.
“No. But I thought—
“No shadowing today?” he asked as he set both the mug and the plate down in front of Harry. “Given it up? Or are you already finished for the day?”
The word “sex” sent an odd, not wholly unpleasant stab of sensation through Draco.
“What—fuck—” Harry panted.
Hermione and Ron have him over for dinner that night.
“More coffee shops,” Harry said.
, the
“I don’t know, Potter. Last I truly remember, you were beating down my front door in your finest auror robes.”
He gazed out of the window at the dormant south garden and the rocky grassland beyond. A fine rain fell. The clouds hung low and grey, but a trick of the late-winter light had the pink blossoms of the plum tree glowing as if with their own illumination. It was Draco’s least favorite time of year—endlessly rainy, lingeringly cold, grey as a pewter cauldron, and damp in a way that seeped into one’s skin—but it had its moments of odd beauty.
“That’s very kind of him.”
“He’s liked you for a very long time. Didn’t you know?”
“Any time,” Malfoy said, voice and face inscrutable.
They landed behind the vegetable garden. Under Harry’s hands, Malfoy stumbled. Harry braced his hips, steadying him.
Sod it. He scrubbed his face, whirled, paced for the entrance.
“Yes,” he said through his hand. “We did.”
Both corners of Malfoy’s mouth quirked back in an expression that wasn’t exactly a smile. “Finally visiting Oregon, are you?” He draped an arm over his knee.
“Oh, you know. I missed you both too much. I got into town today and had to stop by and terrorize this one. Next thing I know, I’m being dragged to the pub.”
Fuck, Harry was not going to hold on much longer. He bit his own lip, clutched hard at the base of his cock. Only the tip was pressed against Malfoy’s hole. He rubbed the head against slick skin, then pushed back in, slowly and exquisitely. Malfoy made a little high noise in the back of his throat as he slid all the way in.
“So what do you think of Oregon so far?” Malfoy asked.
Malfoy. Who prowled towards him now and put a knee on the bed. The mattress dipped. Malfoy stretched out over him, and Harry’s heart thundered. He wasn’t sure how he should feel about Malfoy acting the predator and him lying passively in wait, but it wasn’t fear or anger making his heart race.
A cold sweat broke out on Harry’s neck, although it wasn’t like he should be nervous to miscast on Malfoy. After all, the arse had come looking to embarrass him. It would serve him right for Harry to make the hat too tight on his head.
Draco found Potter in Draco’s own favorite little corner of the garden. This dismayed him and also made him feel some other, unidentifiable emotion, but it definitely had
“You’d already made this. You were winding me up.”
There’s no way to gracefully retreat now. Harry settles back fully in the fireplace. “Hey, Malfoy.”
“Malfoy. I’m— Sorry I’m late.”
She reminded him sharply of Molly in that moment. He rolled over and buried his head under his pillow. This was supposed to be a holiday. A minute later, he heaved himself up. It was for the best, anyway. He’d been lying there thinking about Malfoy. Malfoy and his coffee shop and his friendship with Luna and Ginny. He replayed the conversation in his head. It had remained unexpectedly polite, and was unsettling for that.
Shacklebolt: “…your expertise in potions…your reputation…”
“Lie back in bed,” he whispered. “Spread your legs.”
“You should do it,” Ginny said.
He turned his head on the pillow, and his nose pressed into it, giving him the concentrated scent of Malfoy: citrus and something woodsy and something indescribable that made Harry bury his nose deeper and take a deep breath.
He turns the page.
“Oh. Just us this time?” Harry tried not to sound hopeful.
Nothing. He can’t breathe.
“She’d love that! You know, she found a jar of blackberry preserves she’d forgotten about and wanted to send that along to you, but in my old age, I forgot to bring it.”
“It’s something else, isn’t it? Shall I put a dollop of red on his nose, just to see what happens?”
There was no time to think of anything. The fairies circled back around in a huge swarm, wings glinting hard and bright in the sunlight, and Malfoy shot another spell at them. Malfoy then closed the last of the green-tagged mounds in quick succession. When he was done with that, he began to help Harry with the blue mounds.
“Ron’s still at work,” she says. “Is everything all right?”
“Well! That’s kind of her. No bother. You can bring it around next time. A fair trade for these flowers, I say!”
Malfoy shook his head.
“You’ve been busy,” Edward said, taking in the sight of the stacked boxes. That was the one thing that had changed since the old man’s last visit—the height of Draco’s stock.
The conversation turned to Parkinson’s recent travels through Italy. Parkinson recounted tales of Venice and Naples animatedly while smoke trickled from her mouth and Ginny and Luna’s colored bubbles floated around her.
“I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.”
“Except his clothes closet.”
auror anyone in the department called when they needed a legilimens.
“You’re all the worst.”
As they passed shops and restaurants and parks, Harry had to agree that Malfoy was right: public transportation was a good way to experience the city. He’d got so used to Apparating to get from one place to another, he tended to think of “travel” as a purely practical action.
The doors of a large cupboard opened, and trays of dough flew out one after the other to line up on the table. With several swishes of Malfoy’s wand, a glowing Tempus Charm appeared above each of the ovens, showing 0:00. Several more appeared above the trays of dough, showing numbers that looked like they represented how many hours the dough had been sitting. The amount was different for each tray.
Malfoy said, “Fuck me, Harry.”
They stood in the corner of the kitchen that had been set aside as the break area, having bowls of broccoli and cheese soup with crusty bread and the blackberry lemonade that Malfoy kept as the special summer drink. (In the colder months, it was hot cider.)
Potter looked like he wanted to take a deep breath, but like he couldn’t
He glanced at the clock. He found himself as he’d been that morning: namely, wondering what to do with himself. He was tempted to dismiss the thought of accomplishing anything useful and settle down with a cup of tisane, maybe read a nice book. But he had at least an hour of sunlight left, and he ought to do something in the garden before it got dark. That, or he could—he really should—work on his mastery potion.
“Ten points to Gryffindor.” Malfoy twirls a finger.
“Uh. Credit?” He didn’t recognize the term.
“Lovely, aren’t they?” Malfoy said from behind him.
“Fifty non-magical. Fifteen magical,” she said, then cackled at Harry’s expression.
A little smile twisted Draco’s lips. “Really. It’ll be fine. Teddy will love it. Drink more. You’ll feel better.”
“How are— How are things there?” It was hard for him to ask the question for some reason.
“Oh, is that right?” Harry cuts in, and heat spreads over his face. He feels the angry sparking of his magic, and it wraps a tendril around his lungs and gives a squeeze. He can’t speak with the alarm of it, and his teeth grit.
to do with pleasure. Draco was not
Hermione is sitting at Malfoy’s table, they’ve just written the editorial for the
Hermione grins, her cheeks flushed. “Well, it was actually illegal what they were trying to do to Draco, you know. I knew right away something was wrong. There’s no such thing as an expedited hearing, not in a case with no arrest on record, he hasn’t even got a warrant out on him, just the FORCE form. I should know because I spent a lot of time going through law books after the Ministry’s witch hunt against you.”
He Apparated to a little alley close to Malfoy’s shop and walked across the street. Though it was summer, it was cool enough that Harry cast a Warming Charm.
“Huh,” Harry said.
“Protest!”
Malfoy hummed.
They moved over on the sofa to make room for him, and Harry settled in next to Ginny. Their shoulders rested together companionably.
“Hear that, Potter?”
Luna found Harry watching the sunset that evening. She looked especially soft under the pink-orange sky, and had a bloodstain on the front of her tunic—from feeding the Thestrals, Harry assumed.
“Cheers.”
Arthur. Harry’s eyes widened at the thought.
The closet door—which was enchanted to inspire disinterest in Muggles—opened to a narrow corridor. The corridor was walled with bookshelves and was just wide enough to admit Harry’s shoulders. It exhaled the scents of old paper, wood, and leather. After a dozen feet, it widened into a small sitting area and then a maze of corridors beyond that. Harry vaguely remembered Ron teasing Hermione about getting lost in Luna and Ginny’s library, and he could understand now.
Something comes back to Harry, a small detail he overlooked at the time. “You were stressed?”
“But you didn’t like waking so early.”
“Maybe a year,” Luna said.
Harry took a sheepish step inside. Andromeda’s gaze fell to the chest in Harry’s arms and then lifted again to his face, the serene mask of a good hostess. For the first time in a long while, Harry noted how much like Narcissa she looked. How she looked a little bit like Draco.
Ginny and Luna didn’t look at each other, but there was a brief, charged moment of silence, a silent current that ran between them.
He nods to Ron. “Yeah.”
“It’s doing much better here,” Luna said. She threaded her fingers with his. “It’s so good to see you. You look awful.”
“No. He’s not house-trained,” Malfoy deadpanned.
A curse involving a spell and a potion. Or possibly a curse exacerbated by a potion. Or interacting with. Or a potion whose effect was augmented by a spell. And could he rule out the idea that the spell and the potion were meant to work in conjunction?
Harry ran a hand over Malfoy’s hot thigh, knuckles brushing the soft skin of his balls, then gripped the base of Malfoy’s dick. It was insistently hard in that way of morning erections. Harry didn’t want to tease Malfoy—he wanted to taste him—so he only gave one lick to the head of Malfoy’s cock before sliding his mouth down and over it.
The beer in his hand was red. He took a drink. Frowned at it. “Why did I order this? Why didn’t I order just one drink?”
Malfoy scrutinizes him.
Draco.
“So Malfoy gave you the grand tour of his shop,” Ginny said, drawing his attention back. She had a peculiar look on her face again, and Harry didn’t trust it.
“That’ll be in the advanced class,” Malfoy said, smirking. “Let’s start you off with the basics.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything next to him, didn’t move. Harry said, “Yeah. It was nice.”
Potter frowned. “We were at the lab of a potion manufacturer developing potions without a license.”
“We’ll take a break.”
Malfoy tasted like musk and salt. He made a surprised noise, then leaned into it. Then he was licking into Harry’s mouth and thrusting his tongue in obvious echo of what he’d done to Harry’s arse, and the sensation went straight to Harry’s arsehole, and—Merlin—he was going to get hard all over again.
“First sale!” Sophie said, and clapped Harry on the arm.
,” Malfoy gasped.
Harry did. So did Ginny and Luna—and Malfoy, without hesitation. They all took another shot and pointed their wands at the mounds. Harry fumbled his first couple attempts at the sealing spell but got it on the third, despite the fairy that buzzed angrily into his face.
Harry picked up the next beer glass. “So, what are these, anyway? Are they meant to be a mystery?”
Grimmauld still hadn’t lost that air of being new but old. The sitting room and the extra parlor rooms and the kitchen no longer actively tried to attack, expel, or eat him, but they didn’t feel like somewhere he
Malfoy’s gaze drops from Harry’s mouth to their joined hands.
“Bugger it,” he muttered, and set off towards the rose bushes and the three tall, willowy dairy goats ripping chunks from the branches.
“Well, it could always be someone who was glamoured. Or polyjuiced.”
“I’m all right.” Better, now that he’d found her. He’d woken feeling out of sorts, only to find the house filled with light and with dappled, shifting leaf shadows—but empty. “What are you reading?”
All of a sudden, he wondered what he was doing there.
Harry wondered why Robards had bothered. It wasn’t like Harry would participate in the interview, and he wouldn’t have anything to do with the case for another week. Even then, he wouldn’t be allowed to interact with Malfoy—of that, he was sure. Robards must have called to update Harry for nothing but the sake of it, and maybe to flout the Unspeakables. Harry didn’t know if this made him feel better or worse.
“He spent a day with the brewmaster. Of course he knows what’s in it,” Malfoy said, taking up his glass again. But Harry was sure there were patches of pink on his cheeks.
Harry restrains himself from asking,
. Merlin. Not like Draco had any chance of figuring out a potion to help Potter, as it was. So it would be good if Potter disappeared on him. Anyway, if what Potter said was correct, then what he needed was probably some combination of spellwork and potion, which was out of Draco’s expertise.
At midnight that first night, Harry bakes three sheets of biscuits.
He found Ginny where she was fixing the side of one of the smaller barns.
“I take nothing for granted,” Malfoy said primly, and it was so ridiculous, Harry couldn’t be offended. Malfoy had already looked away from Harry and was playing with the car radio. Music came on. Classical. Of course.
“And you bring the wand up like this at the end,” she was saying, as Harry reined his attention in again. “And end with a downward motion.”
Malfoy paused to watch ten-year-old Harry flinch awake to the pounding of Uncle Vernon’s fist on the little door. He jolted upright into a spider web, yelped as the spider scuttled over his cheek. Shrunk back as the door screeched open and Uncle Vernon screamed at him for talking back. Spittle flew.
Malfoy had grown up. Malfoy had grown up, and he owned a coffee shop, and he lived in Oregon. And apparently he knew Luna and Ginny and spent time with them, and they had told him Harry was visiting them.
“Where is she now?” He reckoned he would have noticed the signs if Pansy were at the farm. There was a distinct lack of…shrieking.
“Huh? I’m the one waiting for you.”
“How nice of you to care.”
He returns the pensieve to its cupboard, leaving the memory inside, and locks it. Then he goes downstairs to drink his cooling tea, eat a sandwich, and look through the case file.
From there, the conversation turned to Luna’s experiments with pickled herbs and garlic scapes and other things Harry had never heard of before. Malfoy glanced at Harry more as the evening progressed, but never when Harry was looking at him.
Hermione sucks in a breath. The reaction shouldn’t be so satisfying to him, Harry notes. But it is.
Of all the establishments not to make use of Wizard Space, the hat shop seemed to need it the most. It was one of the smaller shops in the alley, barely wide enough for Harry to fit his shoulders into. It reminded him vaguely of Luna’s basement library, except instead of books, Harry was pressed in on all sides by stacks and stacks of hats: hats that greeted him, that sparkled, that gave off warmth or the faint smell of sandalwood. A number of hats featured animal parts—or even whole animals, like Neville’s grandmother’s vulture hat had. To Harry’s relief, there were no actual vulture hats, although he wasn’t sure hats with squirrels or songbirds were any better. (“All creatures humanely sourced” read a sign.) There were hats with mechanical animals, too, and outlandish-looking brass spectacles.
He stood at the back of the queue with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders climbing up towards his ears, and stared at the menu, which seemed like it was only partially written in English. His fingers brushed the credit card in his pocket, and he wondered how he’d become so out of touch with Muggle society. And when had Ginny become so familiar with it?
Harry peered around it to find another little alcove, this one smaller and brimming with felt, needles, feathers, leather cord, and tools. A desk had been crammed against the wall. A slight man with bottle-cap spectacles and no hair sat at it. He blinked at Harry with a perfect lack of recognition.
He searches in himself for the truth to give to Malfoy.
“Draco visits them often,” Luna told Harry.
Malfoy sniffed. “They’re not just non-magical things.”
“Oi. You talked about Quidditch, too,” Harry said.
“Not enough evidence?”
Malfoy showed him the shop’s two different coffee grinders (“But you’ll only be using this one”) and how to measure the ground coffee into the automatic coffee maker. Unlike the other morning, when Harry had been loading bread into the oven, Malfoy gave him very clear instructions, long fingers brushing over the machines and their parts as he talked. Harry’s hackles rose; he wanted to tell Malfoy he got it, he knew how to use a coffee machine (never mind that he had only just learned from Ginny), but he was entranced.
Nervous, but tinged with anticipation.
Potter came into the kitchen a few minutes later as Draco was pouring his tea. Draco studiously ignored him. He placed the tea on the table along with a plate of toast with slices of cheese.
The communication spell takes some effort on his part, especially when he’s drugged. But maybe they decreased the dose of the potion because his thoughts are clearer now, and the concern and anxiety are closer to the surface.
Harry thought as Malfoy pulled him closer to the images.
“They have a really good cashew pilaf. And the meatless loaf is very tasty, if you don’t mind that the garbanzo beans, oatmeal, and walnuts weren’t soaked first. I asked the chef once. It’s good to limit your intake of beans, nuts, and grains that haven’t been soaked. I told her that, though Draco says he doubts they’d change their recipe, even if I were to come and provide them non-magical-style evidence. It’s not feasible for such a large restaurant. That’s too bad, really. It has a really nice tomato gravy, though, and it’s filling.”
Harry holds his breath, lets it go. He says, “You have to know the Ministry would find a way to keep tabs on what you do.”
quiet.”
, after assaulting Draco’s mind.
“Potter, you need only walk into a room to make the front page. You
“Right! Harry! Good to meet you. I’m Sophus. You can call me Sophie, though.”
Harry looked down. Malfoy held up a tiny cup full of dark brown liquid. His first impression was that it was espresso, but there was too much of it for espresso, and it looked too thick.
Malfoy tucked his wand into his pocket. “It offended my sensibilities. And anyway, if you’re going to be my employee for the day, I get a say in your uniform.”
Malfoy’s eyes gleamed in the light of Harry’s
Robards looks ready to explode, but Kingsley holds up a quelling hand. “Mr. Potter,” he says.
Hermione visits late the next morning. Harry’s few belongings are packed in a bag on his bed, and he paces in front of the window, tight little movements. He pauses when she appears in the doorway, reading what he can from her expression. He hasn’t heard a thing yet that day, hasn’t talked to anyone except the orderly who brought his breakfast and the healer’s assistant who told him Healer Catherine would be in later with the discharge paperwork. Otherwise he’s been alone with his thoughts since dawn.
At least Malfoy was sitting across from him. And he was wearing the baseball cap. That was significant, right? That—out of his hats—he was wearing Harry’s favorite?
Sure enough, Malfoy was already inside. He had claimed a corner booth near a window. The glow from the stained glass lamp above the table threw colored light over his hair. He was dressed in a shimmery grey shirt and charcoal jeans, which were at once more casual and more fashionable than anything Harry had seen him in at the coffeehouse. In comparison, Harry felt drab in his khaki trousers and brown button-down.
She lets go, and he clasps her elbows. “That’s brilliant!” He glances at Malfoy, who watches them with restrained amusement. “Malfoy.”
Harry wonders if this is what Malfoy felt like when Harry brought over the casserole, because he can’t turn down any of the food even though his stomach is twisting with nerves and he’s almost up to his eyeballs in coffee and liquor. And Malfoy prattles on the entire time about the particular bakery in Paris his mother took him to as a child, and the provenance of the port, and how to pair it with foods.
“But. I haven’t ordered?”
“Uh. No.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open to respond with—what, he didn’t know. But at that moment, Luna appeared from over the rise.
he wants to ask Robards.
Harry bites the corner of his mouth. It’s not like he’s trying to hide this…“something.” Hermione already knows; well, if she didn’t before, he’s sure she does after this evening. It’s just that this thing between him and Draco simply…is. He can’t define it yet. Maybe he feels a bit like it’ll shatter if he tries to hold it too hard.
“Imagining what?”
Part of him wished he’d given Ginny and Luna a heads up about his return to Portland. It would have been nice to let Ginny drive him back to the farm. At least the Apparition was over in the next moment, and he was standing on their gravel drive.
“I say!” the duchess said as Draco ran by fast enough to clip the edge of a cabinet with his hip—the one previously uninjured. He cursed, stumbled, opened the back door, and hobbled into the garden, pain still spreading along his nerves.
“Good to have you back,” Ron says. He sits beside the bed, propping his elbow so their clasped hands are held aloft. “We were worried about you. Mum just left. I’m off to work in a moment, but ’Mione’ll be here soon. The healers have you all spelled up, but just to be sure: do you need anything? Give me two blinks if you’re okay.”
“Agriculture that restores the land, magically and non-magically. You need to approach it from both angles to really heal the land, although we only teach the non-magical techniques to the non-magicals. ”
He studied Malfoy as he waited. Same wiry energy. Pale eyes that flicked up to meet the gazes of his customers and colleagues. Mouth pursed with concentration, then breaking into a sudden smile that made Harry’s heart give another pound. Over the sounds of coffee-making, Harry could just make out the posh strains of his voice. He moved with certainty in the small space behind the counter, scooting around his colleagues and reaching for coffee, cups, baked goods.
And Harry was bumping into Malfoy at the Ministry on the way to the lifts. Except he wasn’t bumping into him. He’d memorized Malfoy’s patterns. He put himself in a position to cross paths. He turned down lunch with his colleagues in order to visit the canteen when Malfoy took his break. Because Malfoy was like clockwork. Like clockwork, but with enough unexpected behavior to keep Harry on his toes. To hook Harry’s interest.
Even that might not have been enough. But— Green eyes. Jaw set mulishly. A heavier, darker hand curled around his own hawthorn wand. Straight broad shoulders in auror robes. A face smirking at him in the canteen queue.
He pulled down the loose leaf and put the water on to boil, and—once he’d rinsed the dregs of Edward’s coffee from the mug left on the table—it was nearly as if the intervening episode hadn’t happened. Even the low-key sense of foreboding, which had returned to his gut, didn’t keep him from humming. It was a song Kara had taught him on her last visit, a disgustingly catchy tune. He’d have it stuck in his head all day now. Right then, though, he didn’t mind. The kettle hissed cheerfully. The toast sprang from the muggle contraption on the counter, a perfect shade of golden brown. The fire in the hearth stoked itself high. He poured the water for the tea. Opened the jar of jam. Arranged the toast on his favorite blue clay plate, the one with nice heft and a little chip on the edge. He smiled a curling sort of smile as he spread a thick layer of butter and then jam on each slice. It was a subtle science and art, achieving the perfect ratio, one honed through years of practice and experimentation.
The sensation of Harry holding him, so vividly imagined, it felt like a real memory. Of Harry taking his hand. Meeting his eye in the hall.
“Ron said you woke. How are you feeling? Wait.”
Malfoy looks dubious, but he accepts the plate Harry offers him. He regards the little quiches with a curled lip.
It occurred to Harry that he could walk around until two and return then. No reason for him to sit here. Then his gaze drifted to the street view beyond Malfoy, at a bus passing and a woman on a skateboard with a dog, and he thought he didn’t mind sitting for a little while.
“Oh. Hey. Cheers,” he said. “What is this?” He looked at the little tin she’d handed him.
And Harry’s tenderest secrets: his obsession with the peek of skin above the cuffs of Malfoy’s robes, the wrists delicate and blue-veined. The way Malfoy’s jeers warmed his stomach in a way that had nothing to do with anger.
Harry looked up from the flowers. “Did you feel in competition with me? What do you mean, you don’t need to boost her ego?”
Ginny took the glass from his hand and took a generous sip.  “It’s a red ale. Bitter. Malty.”
Right. Fuck.
“Just drink it, Potter. There’s nothing in it but cocoa, milk, and sugar. I thought you could at least appreciate that. You look like death warmed over. Without the warmth.”
“Is this task beyond your capabilities?”
Hermione was right—he and she are the only ones who know about Malfoy’s situation, and that places them both at special risk. So? Broadcast the truth.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry says, but there isn’t much heat in his voice. He’s had time to think about the entire incident. Too much time. And he’s heard possibly every version of chastisement and rant. “He has a wife and a newborn son.”
“Yes.”
“Almost have a mind of their own, don’t they,” he said in an amused way.
When did he plan to start learning the responsibilities of managing the Manor?
“You get them every time,” Ginny put in, teasing but fond, and pressed a kiss to Luna’s temple.
“Failed experiment.”
“And Ginny and Luna were asking after you.”
“That’s mine!”
with Parkinson anymore—so he had no choice but to take it. Parkinson’s grip was light, hardly a grip at all, and Harry didn’t put any effort into it, himself.
Harry had seen etchings before—those sort of…ink drawing things. Lots of lines and little details. He just hadn’t known what they were called. Though, he’d never seen etchings like these before. Some were macabre, some were carnal, featuring naked bodies in positions Harry had never seen people in. The forms in the etchings moved. Bending, writhing, crying out silently—but not, Harry thought, in pain.
Malfoy muttered the charms at Harry’s cone and placed that into his bag, as well.
Malfoy nods his head. “Thank you. Tea?”
Harry tries to resist squirming, but he can’t help but shift his weight against the counter where he’s leaned. “It’s nothing.”
But Malfoy had already turned away and avoided meeting Harry’s eyes in the mirror behind the counter.
“The dawn was nice,” Potter said.
“Oh, sure. Thanks.”
“I’ve got to go,” he says abruptly, and stands.
Harry stared out the window next to Malfoy. “It’s charmed.”
Harry could barely sense himself. It was like standing in a storm.
or with sweet parting words, it wouldn’t change the fact that he is in troubled waters. And Hermione is right, he hasn’t been happy working in the office. He hasn’t been happy for a long time. Even the threat of disciplinary action hanging over him, the uncertainty of Malfoy’s situation, and the corruption in the Ministry can’t dislodge the lightness in him. Despite his worry and doubt, he feels free. Untethered.
He tries to draw a breath, but there is simply nothing there. The magic coils tight in his chest where his lungs should be.
He looks at the bowl on his lap, at the remaining soup. Then he shrugs and scrapes it up with his sandwich since no one is here to take him to task. He pours another cup of tea with extra sugar and drinks it with his elbows propped on his knees, bemusedly listening to the creaking floor and muffled voices above and wondering how he’d come to be at this place in his life.
“A pain reliever for muscles. Rub it in over your arms.”
As Harry straightens on the other side, brushing soot from his robes, Hermione watches him.
“I’m sorry. Malfoy. You have to know the Ministry keeps a file on you. You have to know they keep tabs on everything you do, even anonymously.”
The wards tremble.
He leans against the counter and cradles the mug in his hands, not drinking but letting the heat ground him. Abruptly, he sets it down and jogs up the stairs.
“You really are something,” Malfoy said, but Harry was pleased when Malfoy took a drink from the coffee. His eyes crinkled at Harry over the rim.
Draco, who had been watching, dropped his head back against the pillow. “We’re going to talk about that later.”
He blinked around at the crowds of people and the line of cars driving slowly past. From the open window of one car, a number of people cheered and whistled at a man standing near Harry. The man waved back, picked up his suitcase, and jogged to the car before heaving the case through the open window and diving in after it. Several hands appeared to grab his clothing and pull him inside. The last Harry saw of the man was a pair of kicking feet through the open window, then they disappeared and the car slid away.
made Draco feel uncomfortably warm and squirmy.
Potter’s mouth pressed into a grim smile. “So I’ve been told.”
But Robards is already looking away, searching for something on his desk. “I’ll need a complete report of your interaction with Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry tried in vain to nap. His internal clock was too confused between London time and Oregon time and from waking in the middle of the night. That, and whenever he settled down, his thoughts returned to that morning. Eventually, he ambled back downstairs, heavy but awake.
“The hearing is being postponed.”
Malfoy turned to face Harry, which was unexpected and startling after he’d cooly dismissed Harry for most of the walk. Malfoy’s eyes
Maybe a part of him had hoped that they would make it up to Malfoy’s bedroom for the night, but by the time they got back to Malfoy’s house, the quiet between them had turned strange; the energy had changed. After helping Harry sort his things out of the car, Malfoy offered his Floo.
“And I’ll be done working on this prototype with George by then.” He made a face. “I’d better. Rotten thing’s already taking weeks longer than it should have. Point is, you don’t have to do this alone. You know?”
Harry stabbed a piece of chicken. He snorted. “It’s something else.”
The conversation rambled after that. They discussed other plants on the farm (including the onions, which were in flower), Luna’s latest experiments in spicy pickles, Ginny and Harry’s thoughts on the most recent bunch of Quidditch students, and the health of the farm’s creatures.
Luna smiled at Ginny. “You read my mind.”
of them, though.
“No, this is perfect as-is.”
Thank Merlin it was so early in the year. There were a few evergreens—mostly non-magical—but some of the more…interesting plants were still dormant or hadn’t sprouted yet. That wasn’t true for
By daylight, a little of Harry’s certainty has returned to him. It
Harry paid attention to more of the doors and windows that they walked by. Now that he knew what he was looking at, he noticed the symbol on more doors than he had before.
“What?” He finished the wand movement of the cushioning charm too sharply, and the charm landed on a wooden box instead and Transfigured it into a big fluffy pillow.
Harry waits for the rest.
“Wow,” he said. “Thanks.”
“I still can’t believe you hadn’t done that.”
“Well, bless you.”
“Auror Hills,” Shacklebolt says.
“Yeah,” Harry said, because he had, and what was the point of pretending he hadn’t? Even if it was annoying to see the smirk that appeared on Malfoy’s face. Only—it wasn’t annoying, really. Harry liked the smirk. It made Malfoy look like the boy he remembered, which was something of a relief—but also, confusing. It made Harry’s gut flip.
spy!”
“Luna really loves it here, and I do, too. She’s not the only one who takes care of the creatures and mucks around and cans veg.”
“Mmm. Thank you.”
A twig snapped behind them. Harry turned. Ginny stood there. She raised her eyebrows and looked past him to Luna. “Didn’t take him too long, did it?”
A bubble of incredulous laughter threatens to well out of Harry. He struggles to hold it in and thinks he does a good job of it, except that Hermione casts him a disapproving glance. He wrestles his mouth into a frown and looks straight ahead at Malfoy as the man pours three cups of tea. Harry doesn’t know what’s wrong with himself, why he suddenly feels hysterical while sitting here with his previous nemesis and his longtime best friend. Probably it’s the civility of the entire affair. The
“Good, even cold!” he said. He paused twice to savor the drink while Draco stood in the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, trousers drying slowly and stickily.
“I could share my memories with you,” Harry says, before he realizes he even planned to say it.
, though he didn’t want to start there, so he scrounged up a mostly-empty legal pad Hermione had left on a previous visit and took it to every hall and room in the house, making an inventory of the damage, curses, infestations, and sentient mold.
She showed him how to turn the Emitter on and calibrate it. She also showed him how to seal the fairy mounds with an incantation, which needed to be done as soon the fairies had left them.
“The guest room?”
Draco kicks his ankle, hard.
“You’re excused. This one is a fruit beer.” He sipped. “A sour fruit beer. Not bitter. Made with cherries.” He peered at the little label written on the block. “‘Release the Krieken.’ See?” He proffered it to Harry.
“Oh.” He saw them now. They were so small—no bigger than his thumb—and wiggling over each other. Every so often, they came in contact with one of the ward walls and turned sharply.
“I— Yes. Yeah, it looks good.”
“What? Did he say that? Wait. You don’t
And so they don’t ask any more, and Harry does.
Draco suppressed a little jump at the sudden proximity. He opened the back door. From her wall, the duchess gave him the same curdled look she’d given him before. Her gaze went to Potter, and her expression soured further. Draco resisted saying,
, he stopped. Checked the date. 1977.
Most of the customers were nice, though a few were apparently having less than ideal days, or frowned impatiently when Harry squinted at the money they handed him and had to peer at every note to count the unfamiliar change. Harry discovered that he could win most of these over with a smile and a few words in his British accent. Bafflingly, this tactic had an opposite effect on Malfoy, who scowled when Harry teased a laugh out of a dour-looking young woman.
Malfoy drummed his fingers. Harry smiled at him. Malfoy glanced at the queue over Harry’s shoulder, accepted his credit card, and rang up the order. He gave Harry a number stand.
Harry raises a knuckle to his mouth only to keep himself from laughing. When he’s confident he can talk without snickering, he says, “This is… All right, I’m not going to lie. This is completely mad.” The laugh bubbles out of Harry now, and he’s helpless to stop it. He quiets at the tensing of Malfoy’s already-rigid shoulders.
They assembled the salad and brought it to the patio with the deviled eggs and the chilled corn soup, a soft white cheese rolled in chopped herbs and nuts, and a loaf of bread.
He crossed the room and picked up the rabbit. How hadn’t he seen it before? Kara must have left it on her last visit. He could just imagine it: the little demon placing her toy right there, knowing Draco would find it and feel compelled to return it to her on his next visit to the village.
Luna and Ginny placed one little bowl of dipping sauce between them, which left the other for Harry and Malfoy. To
“Oi! Blame the post owl, why don’t you.”
Harry placed his plate and cup in the tub, while Malfoy waited near the table with a lightly supercilious look that Harry chose to ignore.
He began to fray.
Malfoy ran a hand over his mouth. “Yeah. Rocks.”
“So, what do we…just search for rocks?”
from the kitchen.
“It’s fine coffee,” Edward sighed into his cup, closing his eyes. Then his face lost its good humor and he set down the cup. “We’ve got a cold going around town. A chest thing.”
“No. Please.
“Doing what?” Harry can’t help the wary tone in his voice. A barb of defensiveness disrupts his cozy, peaceful feeling.
He palms his wand.
He liked it even less when Parkinson looked up and spotted them. Harry held back as Ginny and Luna made their way across the room. His gaze met Malfoy’s. He couldn’t quite discern the expression on Malfoy’s face in the shadow of the hat.
They added a charm so that the scents of vanilla and gingerbread wafted from the book. Draco applied an elegant little spell that fixed sound from the memory into the page: Harry and Draco reading out the recipe, Teddy asking questions, the creak and clunk of the oven door.
He caught the whiff of carrion and musk before he saw them. There was also a quality in the air, a pressure like that before a storm, an icy tendril in the summer morning.
“Well…”
about being domestic. I’m simply…surprised to see it on you. It’s not a bad look for you, really. And have you seen a house-elf here?”
“Pretending you don’t exist to preserve my sanity, while asking myself what in Salazar’s name I was thinking yesterday, and wondering if I’m not still in some extended and particularly vivid nightmare.”
No one told Harry that bakers start their work at four in the morning, so when he startled awake in the middle of the night, he was confused.
“Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp. Harry could sense Malfoy turning his head to look at him, could feel the incredulous stare. “I’m not your first man.”
Luna smiled. “You’ve got a good nose.”
The fierceness of the invasion swept Harry off his metaphorical feet. Malfoy flowed around his weakened occlumency walls, washed over them like a tidal wave, and then Malfoy was in every part of him, completely; Harry was drowning in him.
Harry scoffed. “Everyone. Before I got to Hogwarts, it’s the only thing anyone ever said about me.” Into the long silence that followed, Harry said, with bitterness he couldn’t help, “If you want to verify that, you can check it against my unofficial biography. Tells all about it.”
Malfoy frowned, but this time because he looked genuinely nonplussed.
“Circe’s tits, Malfoy. You’re a—”
“But it’s not really,” he says. “I shouldn’t have said that about obliviation. That was really shitty of me.”
The afternoon was lazy and dripped with sunlight. It shone through the leaves of the plants and gleamed off the wings of the crows that flew by overhead. Smells of lavender and herbs wafted up from the garden with the heat.
about you. You need to make time for yourself.”
“Indeed.” Draco took in the sight and then glanced away. It’d be easy enough to clean with a
Harry took the same table he’d sat at before. The shop had a different energy in the morning—brighter, busier. He considered the decor again. At first glance, the coffee shop was clearly Muggle, and he assumed the staff members were Muggle, though he couldn’t be sure. Ginny and Luna had given him the impression that wizarding folk in the US were more integrated with Muggle society. His gaze sought out clues—any unconscious moves to reach for a wand, any stray bits of magic, enchanted objects. He caught sight of a painting depicting a golden field that rippled in a breeze. After that, catching the few other magical details was easier: an extra clock behind the service counter with the hand pointing at “breakfast rush!” (“late morning lull” next to it), a small wooden bird that blinked at the customers from a shelf above the bathroom door, a pot that continuously poured steaming coffee into a mug. All shimmered under the faint oil-sheen of illusory magic.
A little before lunch, Harry scrubs the dirt from his nails and pulls on a checked shirt and a pair of jeans, then floos Malfoy. The sitting room is dark and empty. This time no one appears to greet him, but Harry steps through anyway. He doesn’t bring any of the leftovers from last night because he doesn’t want Malfoy to read into that—whatever he would read from that.
“Only about half a month,” Luna agreed.
Malfoy snorted. “No. You did by drinking it. What
Hermione pulls her lip with her teeth. “He’s alive.”
The first several months following their resignation were the most difficult, rife with tension and punctuated by frequent fights; to Harry, it felt like their relationship might fracture. They’d both enjoyed being Aurors. They’d enjoyed being partners. They didn’t blame each other for having to leave the department—at least, Harry knew rationally that this was the case—but they hardly knew what to
“Who said you were uncouth? I said the oaf is.”
the pegging.”
Harry found Luna in the library downstairs, half-hidden behind teetering stacks. He had only known to look for her there because the door had been left open, and he would have walked back out again if he hadn’t heard the
“Actually, yeah. You know. Why don’t I just stick around the farm? I’m really enjoying it here. I like working with the animals and the Quidditch students.”
She beamed at him and drew him towards the en-suite, where she showed him the basin and the shower.
“Here,” Malfoy said after some time. The bus stopped, and they clambered down onto the pavement.
Glancing above the hearth, Harry finds the milkmaid absent from her painting. He grips his wand tighter.
Draco took a bite of toast. Distantly, he was aware of the tart tang of the jam, the creamy butter. He chewed. Drank more tea.
“Erumpent caretaker.”
Malfoy’s words echo in his mind.
He took it back. “It’s beer.”
Harry’s gaze traveled down. He noticed the silvery marks criss-crossing Malfoy’s chest. The sight sent a stab of alarm through him, then another when he realized they were scars—and a wash of cold when he realized what had caused them. Who.
Malfoy was doing, work Harry thinks is important, work that Harry wants to contribute to, as well. At the time, he wasn’t thinking about himself or about Malfoy, not as personalities. But of course the press and the public would only see it that way.
The next morning, Harry had his coffee and pastry before climbing to the attic. He spent that first day rearranging the mess into rough piles. On the second day, he chose the pile in the furthest corner to start with, picked the largest chest, and opened it.
Harry shook his head. “Nothing.”
“Malfoy,” Harry says in a warning tone that has an edge of a plea in it. He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them again, Malfoy is watching him. Well, in for a knut. He takes a deep breath. “I was wrong. You were right. The Ministry— What it’s doing is wrong. I talked with Hermione—”
“Malfoy. You just insulted your own coffee.”
Draco bit the inside of his mouth against the things he wanted to say. “I need you to tell me the details of your incident again. Now that I’m over the shock. Maybe miraculously you’ll tell me something I can use, this time.”
. The IPA was
He returned to the house in time to join Ginny in picking blackberries, which was surprisingly companionable, even though Ginny laughed at the scratches on his hands and smashed berries against his neck and arms when he wasn’t looking.
He slammed the last book closed and looked at his notes. “So what I have gleaned from all of this is the potion smelled like licorice—by which you probably mean anise or fennel, but Merlin knows which one—and it, quote, ‘Had the viscosity of custard that hasn’t set long enough.’ Do I have all of that right?”
“What the actual…” He was awake but confused. Was Ginny playing some kind of prank on him? Then, he vaguely remembered Malfoy mentioning something during their conversation at the brewery about early hours.
When Harry arrives, Robards is behind his desk with a newspaper open in his hands. He slaps it down on. “The hearing’s been canceled.”
Swirling his spoon through his chowder, Malfoy said, “I supposed it never occurred to you to do anything else?”
Harry sits cautiously. This time, Malfoy scoots his own plate toward himself on the table and sets the platter to hovering, making room for Harry to put his plate down.
Malfoy lived with these names. He looked at them every day.
, and how Poesy Potions and the Ministry could ever hope to keep their pollution a secret anymore.
Robards’ mouth presses into an even smaller flat line. His dark eyes continue to scan in little movements over Harry’s face. After an uncomfortable moment, he says, “It means the hearing’s been postponed. Pushed back for two weeks.”
He cast the spell. The pages of the book in front of him flipped back and forth aggressively before snapping open and creasing deeply under the words.
. Such plebeian tastes,” Malfoy muttered loud enough for only Harry to hear.
“Did you ever see him when you were visiting?”
The fourth time Harry pulled all the way out again to rest the head of his cock against Draco’s entrance, Draco growled his protest. So Harry pushed in—fast.
Harry’s gaze sweeps automatically around the space. He’s not sure what he expected. He vaguely recollects Malfoy Manor, but this is nearly as different from the Manor’s cool marble and white balustrades as Hermione and Ron’s little home. A thick fleece jacket hangs from a hall tree to the side. Shining leather brogues line a shoe rack. There’s a collection of needlepoint still life studies depicting aubergines and cauliflower and carrots, an etching of thestrals, and a little felted wool birdhouse that is a replica of the cottage. Books on a shelf. A broom in the corner.
There’s one statement about Malfoy’s case with only a vague mention of the scandal with Poesy Potions. The rest is mostly speculation about Harry.
Ginny shrugged as she poured tea for both of them. “She’s my size. She’s soft. I grew up with men and dated men, and with her there’s no sense of competition and no sense of needing to boost her ego. We match.”
Draco scoffed. He pushed Harry away. “Where’s Teddy?”
Harry took her glass of cider and drained it.
By the little bit of light in the hall, Harry can just make out the shape of a person—a man, by the height and shape. Sparks crackle through the air as the wizard draws back his wand. Harry doesn’t know what the person has planned, but he funnels his magic up into a powerful shield just as a different spell crackles over it.
“And an IPA,” Harry remembered to put in at the last moment. When the waiter had turned away, he said, “Shut up,” before anyone could tease him for being predictable.
And then Harry was being ripped from the memory, from the private part of Malfoy’s mind, and he let it happen.
“Right. So if I just do this…” Malfoy slowly lifts his hands from Harry’s shoulders.
“Pyrotechnic engineer.”
lot aren’t the problem,” he said.
about it—mouthy and smug, a little bit of a show-off, with bursts of aggressive energy—but also: surprisingly tender. Caressing Harry’s sides, pressing kisses down his spine, even as he fucked Harry wide open and told him how he wasn’t going to stop until Harry begged.
Now that he was closer, Harry could see that her t-shirt had been cut at the bottom and tied with ribbons. She opened her arms and hugged him. She was slight, like a bird, and bony. She smelled of summer sun, patchouli, animal musk, and very faintly of vinegar.
“All right. Take your positions,” Ginny said. She, Luna, and Malfoy each took up at a corner of the field near their color.
“You’re right! They’re just her color, aren’t they? In fact, why don’t I send you home with a pot of these. I divided the bulbs and have more than I need.”
Heather placed the pale of food on the ground and let the goats tussle over the last pellets as she inspected the fence. “Let me put these girls away, and then I’ll come back to fix this. Summer can’t come soon enough.” She sent a significant look to the east, where the wire fencing gave way to a crumbling dry stone wall. Come July, half the village would turn out to help her and Rosemary replace the temporary wire fence with a new section of stone wall.
and layer them on sheets of dough
“A strange bird,” Draco said. “We get them here in the garden sometimes, you know, drawn by all the plants.”
He went to the bookcase, mostly to stare at it for a minute. He ran a finger over the spines. Well. Identifying potions and deducting their uses and makeup had always been a strength of his. With nowhere better to start, he would start with references on that subject.
“People drink this for pleasure?”
“It’s all right, just get back onto the motorway,” Harry said, after they were redirected for the third time.
“I’m off at two.”
she’d said, though he couldn’t care less about carbonating water. Or “warts”—a weird name for the liquid that would become beer. But then, they were wizards, so that kind of thing didn’t really surprise him.
Harry stared up at the ceiling, at the ridiculous chandelier with its slowly rotating planets. He did not move. He felt boneless, and raw where Malfoy’s cheek had rasped against him, and his arsehole tingled. He still wasn’t
Draco could use the money. He hadn’t been bluffing about the cost of supplies. Although he grew and collected many of his own ingredients, others weren’t feasible to produce himself; this tended to be true of the expensive ones.
A forceful exhalation, another nod.
“Hey. I’m Harry. Harry Potter? Luna called and asked if I could, er, help you around the shop today?”
The air around the clearing shimmered like a thin soap bubble. Harry recognized a Disillusionment Charm that would probably create the illusion of more forest for any Muggles—non-magicals—that came through the area. A slight pressure pushed against his skin as he passed through.
Potter sighed. “Come on. You didn’t
A hard feeling lodged in Harry’s chest like glass. It might have been anger or sharp glee.
“Clarke and Harris have had fuck-all luck with this case in Surveillance.”
“They do this every time,” Ginny told Harry in a stage whisper.
Malfoy sniffed and made a show of looking over each shelf while Harry stood aside, watching him hum and cluck and stroke his chin. Harry wanted to stuff one of the hats over his face.
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that, so he gives the brandy a little shake and takes a drink.
Malfoy’s mouth stretched flat, not quite a smile. “Any time.”
Harry looked at the big blue IHOP sign above the building. “Would you be very upset if I said I’m no longer in the mood?”
Harry’s heart twists.
“To my work. Not away from it.”
“Yeah? If I wasn’t before, I certainly am now. You’re enough to drive Merlin bonkers.”
Something isn’t right. The sense of it settles around him with the cool, sweet scent of Malfoy’s house, and he understands Hermione’s worry.
Malfoy was more familiar to him. Here was the haughtiness he hadn’t seen in evidence before.
“You have fucked someone before, right, Potter? Don’t tell me your previous partners did
“I’ll Apparate from your house, or I can take the Floo.”
From the corner of his eye, Potter moved his hands above the tabletop—never
Fear and some other strong emotion reach up to clutch his chest. Dismay, or grief. Somehow, over the last week, he’s come to—admire Malfoy. Care for him, even. This person on the stand isn’t him. This is a puppet, a caricature of the bully he once was.
Harry is still shaking when he returns home. He bangs the kettle onto the cooktop, casts a vicious
Malfoy’s smile sharpens, twists in a way that is clearly mocking
“Do they— Is there—”
questioning if I’m compelled to be examined. Do you stop to ponder the absurdity of the laws you enforce? Or are you just the dumb muscle they send when they need someone hexed without asking why?”
Ron gives him a smile. Exhausted, but genuine. “Good. Just rest a moment, then. Hermione is on her way.”
“Nope. Just as much of a surprise for me.”
As they walked to the door, Harry drifted close to Malfoy and brushed hands with him. “Thanks,” he said.
He gives two blinks for
“For a while,” Harry muttered. Well, it was true. It wasn’t like he hadn’t noticed how attractive men were since—since Hogwarts, probably. Malfoy didn’t need to know that he’d only really started to suspect recently.
Harry glanced at the menu. “So give me an egg and ham sandwich? But hold the eggs.”
Then Harry wanted to stop at a shop that made fudge, and at the tourist gift shop next to it, which Malfoy bore with dignity.
“Uh…”
“I have to see what your garden’s got up to,” the old man said. “Do you still have that great big blackberry bramble?”
Draco pursed his lips. He could press Potter, but the other man stared back mulishly. This was the person who had stood down the Dark Lord. Draco wouldn’t get anything out of him that Potter didn’t want to give. Knowing the git, he would just as soon walk away, even if he
“You’re wearing one of the hats.”
“Merli—
“Did you really bake all of this on your own?” He steps beside Malfoy and quiets his voice. Malfoy meets his gaze with guarded eyes. He gives a short nod.
Ginny said, “So why exactly did you leave the Aurors, anyway?”
The clock tick-tocked, tick-tocked.
“Low blow, Ginny.” Harry scowled.
Draco let out a bark of laughter. Harry still cherished these moments when he could make Draco laugh—spontaneously, without a care. Draco was still smiling when Harry returned from the corner of the room with two glasses of whiskey and handed him one.
“Yep! Thank you.” He smiled at her.
“Hell if I remember,” Potter said. “And it’s not like I can carry notes with me.”
“Harry?”
“Potter,” Malfoy said cautiously.
Harry looks around Malfoy’s sitting room, and his heart sinks when he spots more envelopes on a desk. Stacks of them, maybe a hundred separate letters.
Draco glared more.
It was a very nice arse. And Harry got an even closer view of it when Malfoy swayed precariously. Harry’s hands went up and caught Malfoy by the backs of his thighs. His very hot, firm thighs.
After a while, the meowing got to him. Several of the cats had gathered in the painting next to him and rubbed themselves against the frame.
Malfoy chuckled. Lowered his head. Took one of Harry’s nipples into his mouth. Rolled it between his teeth. Laved it with his tongue. Meanwhile, one hand trailed down to fondle his balls lazily. Harry planted his hands against Malfoy’s shoulders, steadying himself.
The smile on Malfoy’s face is hard and mocking, but seemingly directed at himself. “Trying to publish my research.”
“That’s right. You know where your food bowls are. And they certainly aren’t here.”
was missing, but it was just this vague sense of not enough.
Hermione looks at him, eyes dark and still focused inward. The frown hasn’t left her face.
“That’s great,” Harry says. “Thank you.”
“That’s interesting. Do they have a medicinal use, then?”
“Merlin! You need a keeper.”
Reinforced, the wards immediately go still, which doesn’t explain why Harry’s world is shaking and he is on his knees.
“Yes… And what do you care?”
“Oh, yeah. Sounds like loads of fun.”
The bushes shook again—a short, aggressive tremble that certainly wasn’t any wind.
“Wait.” Harry clamped his hand down on its edge. “What are you doing?”
“You little escape artist,” he murmured, and couldn’t keep the disgusted affection from his voice. “How in the name of Morgana are you getting out?”
“Yes. Please.”
She shrugged. “Just sayin’.”
Casting a wry eye over the mess of trays crowding the counters, Malfoy says, “Clearly.”
would have wanted to be comforted, the way he
His feet knew the way down to the forest. He passed the little creek into the cool humidity under the trees.
“You just seem awfully worried about Malfoy. It’s sweet.”
“Up, Harry,” she said, fists on her hips, and he could only blink and gawp as she clenched his wrist, all but hauling him into the kitchen.
“So I left. My records were only public domain so long as they were produced while I was employed at the university. I don’t need the faculty appointment in order to conduct research, and as a private citizen, I am no longer compelled to share what’s mine with the Ministry and the public at large.”
Then Malfoy says, “I left because of the FOIA requests. The letters kept coming from the Ministry. And it was obvious—” He pauses minutely, his calm wavering for an instant. “—that the university was reluctant to back me up with its legal team.”
The scent of pine wafted out. Someone in the Black family had loved Christmas. Harry almost fell into the crate while taking an inventory of its contents: snow globes filled with real snow, an angel that sang (but unfortunately didn’t want to stop), an Everlasting Tree thirty feet tall—all jumbled in a vast space created by an Undetectable Extension Charm and lit with floating green and silver candles.
“We already saw the dishwasher?”
Harry opened his mouth to respond, decided against it, and downed the beer. Bitter, thick, slightly sweet.
brief, gone the moment Draco snarled.
as well as some of the more obscure periodicals. For once, Harry is glad to see them—in a grim way—even when they catch sight of him and give a collective start. He braces himself, tightens his hold on the box, and approaches them. They’ve already begun to fling questions in his direction before he’s within a few meters.
“Wanker,” Harry muttered. He made his way across the shop, stepping around the tables with their upturned chairs. Lights from the street illuminated the menu board and the empty counter. The smell of coffee was less aggressive than it was during the day.
take a breath in his not-dead state and so instead spent a moment looking extra surly before he said, “Because
“Caprologist.”
They did look enchanting. The garden was a riot of different colors and shapes. The morning sun made the leaves glow a bright green. It looked magical enough to Harry.
Occasionally, Potter interjected a question, but to Draco’s mild surprise, they were mostly reasonable.
“Malfoy? Are you there?”
Harry grinned.
Slipping his foot into the first sandal, he felt the smooth round surface of an egg just before he applied his weight. He heard the crunch and felt the thick, wet splatter.
For an instant, he couldn’t breathe. Then he dragged his gaze back to Malfoy’s eyes. The desire hadn’t left Malfoy’s expression, but a little uncertainty had come into it.
The purple veg was potatoes.
Slowly, Malfoy shook his head.
“Brulee caramel coffee and a ham and egg with no egg?”
“So what do you propose?”
Harry’s own thoughts collected around that realization and filed into a blade that he used to cut through.
“Tell me this isn’t Wizard Space,” Harry muttered.
“I’m sorry, Potter. Are you suggesting I live under a rock?”
“Because I can add pages.”
Draco gestured. “There’s a perfectly good shelf of books. Take the opportunity and learn to read.”
It was so weird watching Malfoy. Harry’s feelings about him had been complicated since the last battle. He was still used to looking at him and experiencing a sense of distaste, a need to squash him. Although, the last time he’d seen Malfoy had been at the trials just after the war, and at the time, his emotions had been primarily of pity; Malfoy had looked so worn.
Harry brushes fingers over the titles of books in the bookcase, pulling a few out at random. Potions texts. Theoretical magic. More than one volume on dark magic—nothing illegal, but nothing that would be found in the general section of a public library, and nothing that wouldn’t raise questions.
Harry smiled faintly.
Then Ginny said, “On my mark! Get set! Go!”
“Earth to Potter.”
Harry realizes he’s smiling back. In fact, he’s been holding Malfoy’s gaze for longer than is socially acceptable. He looks away.
Last night, after leaving Ron and Hermione’s, a restless need to find something spurred him out into muggle London, where he rented a computer at an Internet cafe. There, over an ill-advised cup of coffee, he searched for news of the town where Poesy Potions bases its operations. He found nothing on Poesy by name, of course, but a search yielded results about its muggle alter ego. To his surprise, Perfect Products—as it calls itself—manufactures muggle goods, as well. Largely ointments for livestock.
Malfoy murmured a charm. A shiver of alarm went through Harry, but in the next instant, the view in the telescope cleared and sharpened. Harry found himself looking at a number of shops and buildings.
“Well, yes,” Luna said, as if it was an obvious fact.
There’s an answering call of magic in Harry. It recognizes
“You spent a lot of energy working in the attic this last week,” Hermione said, casually, as she unloaded a platter of chicken. (“Mum cooked it,” Ron mouthed at Harry, in reassurance.) “Bill said you liked Curse-Breaking?”
The smile widened. “Milk or dairy substitute?”
“Any flavor?”
Sophie was kind but clearly just waking up. He yawned hugely between sentences and took deep pulls from his mug. The strong, burnt smell of the coffee filled the cramped space, and Harry tried not to wrinkle his nose. Maybe it was that he’d spent so much time in Malfoy’s shop over the last few days. He was sure that, a week ago, the smell wouldn’t have bothered him. It would have just been coffee to him, like all the rest.
“Actually, we’re going to take you to another brewery,” Luna said.
Harry blanked on his complete vocabulary. He could only breathe—fast and shallow. Malfoy—
“This land was badly damaged. That’s why we chose it.”
“Well, that’s it,” Harry says. “I need to get home. Thanks for putting me up.”
Harry, however, held on tight; he had lots of practice. He pressed his face to the side of Draco’s neck and smiled. “Sex under the invisibility cloak. In the park.” He could feel Draco’s skin heating and Draco’s muscles tensing as if he were preparing to push harder. Harry sniffed. “Careful, now. We’re in your lab. And I’ll remind you that was
He pulled away. Harry’s face was wet again. Draco licked the tears. Smirked. Harry could only stare up at him, vision starred.
A strange look passed over Potter’s face. Then the corner of his mouth ticked back in a not-quite-grin, and he gave a one-shoulder shrug. He looked up toward the sky, and his face lightened. He said, “It’s nice out here.”
The roses had done well, even having gone neglected for decades. At Harry’s direction, they were the only plants that had been spared the pruning charms, besides the trees. Their pink and red and spotted blooms grew all over. Harry wondered if they were magical. He’d be surprised if they weren’t. Maybe Ginny and Luna could bring a preserved cutting to the brewpub’s rose expert.
“Yeah. Of course.” Harry takes the dish from him. He goes through the floo, and Malfoy’s words only register as he decides to go down to the kitchen to put it away properly like an adult instead of leave it on top of the fireplace mantel.
Bate is staring at Harry with wide, enraged eyes and flared nostrils. Harry never liked the man to begin with. He has a feeling the sentiment is mutual. The dark eyes flick over Harry, quickly categorizing the soft trackies and worn t-shirt, the bare feet.
Hermione came by while he was placing the security charms over his desk as he readied to leave.
Apparently, “taking a break” involved more baking: into each cup of a muffin tin, Malfoy placed croissant dough, a slice of bacon, and a raw egg. While that was in the oven, Harry helped him clean up the mess in the kitchen and load the cases in the shop with the cooled bread, biscuits, and croissants.
“Any of this. With a man? With your walls down?”
Draco smiled, all slyness and teeth. He pulled Harry’s shirt the rest of the way off, Harry moving to accommodate Draco’s hands. Pulled the jeans off, the pants. He loomed over Harry on hands and knees. “Have you ever done this before?”
Ron swore softly.
“This.” He lifts their hands a little. “I felt…something I didn’t before. It didn’t make sense because I couldn’t remember.”
“No…” Harry stared down at the letters, dazed. It was obviously a completely different set, but Harry could have been kneeling in the attic again, unfolding Lupin’s letter.
,” Parkinson said.
Harry noticed the flash of black ink at Malfoy’s wrist as Malfoy tossed the shirt to the other bed. Lifted his gaze to Malfoy’s face. Kept it there, even as Malfoy unbuttoned his trousers and pushed them down. The fabric brushed over Harry’s bare skin. Then those hit the other bed, too.
“Fine?”
Luna gasped. “Not the bench of shame!”
And even if Harry weren’t screwed because of his involvement with Malfoy, there’s the corruption of the Ministry surrounding this case. The unfounded harassment of Malfoy. The ploys to bury a public health danger, and the way the auror department is being jerked around like a box full of puppets in aid of the effort. It makes Harry sick to his stomach.
“Hungry?” she asked.
featherfee treats.”
And then, because Hills continues to look at him, he says, “Yes.”
“Now you may have it back,” Malfoy said. He reached into his bag and withdrew the ice cream cone—carefully, cradling it like a kitten. “It’s all right,” he murmured to the cone. “Harry can eat you now, I promise.”
His hand squeezed, then pumped slowly.
They walked along a winding path hidden by the herbs; it revealed itself as they went. The smell of mint wafted up as they walked. Luna trailed her hand along the plants, lightly touching leaves and petals as she passed. She named some of them for Harry.
“Oh.” Harry stepped inside so someone else could enter. The door drifted shut behind him. When he looked back towards the counter, Draco Malfoy had turned away.
to work. Even after paying reparations, Draco still had enough in the bank to live comfortably, as did Harry. But they’d realized that some of the tension between them was the need to
Lip curled in a snarl, Harry raises a fist to resume pounding on the door—and gets a face full of strawberry-scented soap bubbles.
room. Not his room.
“So, pub night?”
Harry snorted.
He stood for a while with Sirius’s chest of letters in his arms. He debated taking it downstairs and rifling through the rest of the letters. Not that he would read them. The thought discomfited him. They were too private for that, even if they did include mentions of his parents. But maybe they weren’t even all letters. And maybe he could ask Hermione about a spell to check for the presence of specific words. It wouldn’t be so invasive if he were just looking for mentions of Prongs and Lily. Sirius and Lupin wouldn’t have minded that, probably.
Malfoy’s expression grows more irritable with each word. Harry finds that strangely reassuring. Now Malfoy will tell him to piss off, and Harry can shove his face into a sink-full of cold water.
Luna led him around the side of the house, past a greenhouse and down a sloping path into another garden, this one filled with flowers. Harry recognized foxglove and others that he didn’t have names for. A tiny castle made of little stones and glass beads sat among the blooms.
Malfoy stared at him. “Yes. But. By all means, feel free to loiter. I’ll leave you to it.”
By the time the water is hot and the tea is brewing, Malfoy’s regained his composure and his prickles.
“Of course,” Malfoy says.
Harry wrenched and snapped like an animal, concentrated his will and
From her place at the end of the table, Parkinson scrutinized Harry over the rim of her drink. Harry didn’t know what to make of it, so he ignored her.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you couldn’t handle a sandwich if it’s not on stale white bread.”
“Of course it is.”
Not that any of it surprises Harry.
“Hi, Luna,” he said, and bent so that she could kiss his cheek. Then he frowned at the tree. It felt familiar, like he should remember it.
. That was when Harry remembered just how he’d shoved his plate back into the waiter’s hand. The meal she’d ordered him.
“Takes one to know one.”
Malfoy brushed Harry’s sweaty fringe from his forehead. Pressed a kiss to his ear. “Harry. Love. Are you all right?”
“Good croissants.”
Harry decided that the cottage pie was more important, so he dropped the topic in favor of taking a bite. It was really good—the beef moist and rich, the potatoes slightly crispy on top with a crust of melted cheese.
Harry turns cold, then hot. The newspaper Harry stares at him with green eyes.
Harry was still waking up. He’d thought he would have another laid back morning with Luna, making breakfast and meandering around the farm. Instead, Ginny had appeared at his door while he was still on the edge of sleep and waking, too cheerful for six in the morning.
“You live alone.”
Harry felt faint again. He reached a hand behind himself blindly, planted it against the floor, and sat.
“There it is.”
“Not so incriminating anymore,” Harry says, voice softer than he intended. “Right? There’s nothing there. You’ve spent the last ten years donating to charities, backing social causes, and researching.”
Linking hands.
He made a face at that thought, and went out into the garden.
A sigh. “Fine, then.”
. The same rune that was on his own.
She did, and they watched the rest of the film, and he was content.
“How’d you—” But of course Harry knows how Malfoy knew.
“Though not much has changed in several millennia,” Charlie had said while taking him through the process, from milling the grains to mixing them in hot water to straining the liquid and adding an array of herbs, fruits, and goops. She went on a lot like Malfoy had about the origin of the grains and relations with the farmers, but Harry wasn’t too interested. His gaze drifted to the ropes hanging from the ceiling beams, the pile of mushy grains sitting in a tub, the big glass jars of herbs—and he wondered, then, where Malfoy brewed potions for Luna and Ginny. Luna had told him about Malfoy’s brewing, but Harry hadn’t seen any evidence of it. Did he have a potions lab? Ginny had said something about Wizard Space in his wardrobe. Harry had assumed it was for clothes—but was it?
At first, the muggles look vaguely confused at the protest down a seemingly random street. Then—surprisingly and miraculously—they begin to join in as they catch whispers of what is going on, some with hastily-scrawled protest signs.
He had spent the later part of the morning and the early part of the afternoon with Luna, looking through the indexes of books, searching for information about curses and magical plant illnesses. Doing research with Luna was very different from researching with Hermione. The library didn’t seem to have any organizing strategy that Harry could recognize, and half the time Luna couldn’t remember where a book was. She gave Harry directions like, “Look at that shelf near the middle. It’s sort of up near the top to the left.”
Harry liked his job. He liked solving problems and closing cases and working late on most nights of the week because it suited him. He’d made deputy head auror by age 25, and with any luck—that is, if Robards would ever retire or be promoted to head of DMLE—he’d make head auror by 30. His life was anchored by comfortable routine, but he saw enough action to keep it interesting. He wasn’t stressed; he wasn’t bored.
“There it is,” Harry said.
The rain, heavier now, fell in a steady sheet past Potter and through him. He didn’t look at all wet.
Hermione gave him a narrow-eyed look, then turned back to Harry. “It’s not about making money. I didn’t mean that you have to
“Yes,” Malfoy says, the sharp voice pulling Harry back to the present, and Harry realizes he was absorbed with taking in the entry room. He turns to see Malfoy regarding him with open wariness now. But his arms are not crossed, they are at his sides, one held slightly out to the small side table that hugs the wall. The posture strikes Harry as vulnerable. “Poesy Potions.”
, Potter,” he said, and pointed at the wall.
Startled by a rush of movement to either side of him, Harry stopped dead in the doorway.
“I never did ask,” Luna said. “What did you think of the larder?”
Then there were the costs of feed for the creatures and delivery fees and repairs to the house, when he couldn’t manage those himself.
Malfoy was looking forward through the windshield. “I’m taking you somewhere.”
The look on the duchess’s face should have warned him. But Draco was used to her strange moods and indecipherable expressions, so he only returned the look she gave him before opening the back door and casting a strong umbrella charm to float over him, and didn’t think anymore about it.
“How’s your IPA?”
“Yes—”
Harry doesn’t know why he finds the garden so unexpected. Even in the dark, it’s apparent how well kept it is. Of course it is. The front garden is so tidy; why not the back? But there is something about this one that strikes him as—special. Like it’s not made for other people. The front lawn and the manicured shrubs that frame it are for appearances. This, Harry can tell, is for Malfoy alone.
Malfoy paid for the book and slipped it into his bag, then he took Harry through a side door. They exited into a sunken courtyard occupied by artists selling paintings and little stuffed magical creatures and knitted accessories. Harry bought a small Thunderbird for Luna and a Snitch beanie for Ginny.
“Nothing. Nothing should come of it.” At Malfoy’s flat stare, he stumbles. “No. That’s not—
Malfoy was looking at him again. “What do you mean?”
An odd feeling dropped through Harry. Adrenaline and something else. His cheeks warmed.
Draco curled his fist around his wand but didn’t draw it. With the other, he opened the door.
“’The Sociomagical Impact of Large Vat Potions Production: A Retrospective,’” Harry reads.
“Fascinating. Something new to learn every time I visit.”
They brought their motley collection of scrolls and journals to the table to add to the books already there, and Malfoy sorted the materials into small piles that appeared to make sense to him. Harry was reminded again of Hermione, but it was so uniquely
His heart raced. His heart should not be racing. It was Malfoy. Just…Malfoy. The prat he’d beaten at Quidditch. Who had sneered and insulted his friends and thought too much of himself.
Hermione tells him what Harry said, the whole story as she understands it from Harry, minus the way Harry had sat in her kitchen, at a loss for what to do. Somewhere about halfway through the telling, her mouth loses its determined stiffness and her shoulders relax and Malfoy leans forward in his own seat as he asks questions, his elegant voice going a little breathless. Harry watches the transformation but is still hard-pressed to say what caused it, what the turning point was. All he knows is that suddenly, Malfoy is agreeing to show Hermione his study, and the two of them are putting down their tea and dishes. The sandwiches have barely been touched. The soup congeals in its little bowls. Harry is the only one to have eaten his food, his appetite having returned around the time they started using words like
“Where’s your sense of adventure gone, Potter?” Malfoy said, and reached for the handle of a door at the far side of the structure. He pushed down on it once, and then up, and then pushed it open.
. He can feel the magic move through him, can feel that faint sensation of sucking or constricting on his lungs, though barely perceptible.
“We’ve come this far,” Malfoy said, drumming his fingers on the wheel.
Ron nodded. “You’re family. I bet Dad would be happy to help, too. And Mum. She’s dying to have a go at your kitchen.”
All right, then. He’d have time enough to get it out of Potter, whatever it was.
Malfoy returned with a little tray bearing four empty glasses and a collection of bottles. Harry accepted the cider Malfoy offered him but declined the glass. What was the point, when he could drink from the bottle? That level of fussiness was so
When he opens them again, Hermione is sitting at his bedside, reading. Harry recognizes the orange blossom scent of her soap and the intense quality of her silence, the occasional brush of a page turning.
Ginny snorted. “Draco taught him everything he knows.”
“And no one in your useless department thought of collecting a sample?”
Harry leans over the kitchen table, squeezing his chin. No word from Robards. That means he specifically did not inform Harry about the tip on Malfoy or the planned search.
“What do you mean?” she asked in a falsely sweet voice. “Malfoy did such a good job dispersing that swarm. He’d be understandably tired from it.”
Harry nods. It makes sense, but doesn’t assuage the discomfort lodged in his chest.
“Yeah. I mean. I’d like to see what it’s like. You seemed to enjoy it last night, and my previous partners did, too.”
Malfoy smirked and continued his explanation. Actually, the process was not too different from what Harry had learned from Petunia, who had been rather particular about her baked goods. Malfoy kept a close eye on Harry as Harry folded his first batch of dough, but quickly went quiet when Harry got into the rhythm of it. Though he didn’t offer any verbal compliments, he cast frequent suspicious glances at Harry. Harry pulled back one corner of his mouth in a smile.
“Well, Monsieur Rabbit. How would you fancy a new home? No?” He sighed and set it on the boxes he planned to deliver later that week. He’d return the wayward toy then. “Yet again bested by a child.”
Malfoy pursed his lips. “I might have been. What do you know? But in fact, I followed Pansy.”
“And they didn’t serve chips.”
“You said you were there with Draco. I don’t suppose you knew about the search?”
Potter’s arms were crossed at his chest. “What did you want, Malfoy? I told you even the potions masters at St Mungo’s had no idea what dropped on me.”
Harry remembered something Malfoy had said to him last night: “Two.”
“I was.”
The best part of the hubbub is that it keeps Robards distracted for the rest of the day, so Harry escapes the office without being pulled aside.
Draco scowled, ran a hand through a shallow pile of flour, and smeared it over Harry’s face. Harry squawked. Laughed.
With a last muttered expletive at his desk, Robards scoops up the newspaper and waves Harry out of his office with it.
Harry had a flashback to Hogwarts, and the reality hit him: this was
“I know. Hermione—”
“As if you’re a Quidditch star now, yourself,” Harry muttered.
He thought of the letters again. Lupin. His parents. The Order. Tonks. He threw another piece of bread to the seagulls. A small flock descended on it.
“Harry.”
A pause, as if she weren’t certain whether to say what she had to say in front of Malfoy. Harry, however, wasn’t going to let him out of his sight. The supercilious shit was up to something.
“What exactly are you asking, Malfoy? I pay in galleons, like anyone.”
The tea stops giving up steam. Harry sets it aside to stare at his loosely splayed hands.
“Nothing at all, really. We thought you might be hungry, though, and Ginny wanted to take you to one more pub before you go back. I thought it would be nice for you to visit Sassy Spider, but as a guest this time. You can tell us what you learned about the beers.”
“Potter.”
Harry bristled at the dismissal, then deflated just as quickly. He opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, the door clicked quietly shut in his face.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. Poor Heather. She was four-foot-nothing in height and had kind blue eyes the color of cornflowers, but she had the mouth of a dockworker and could lift one of the tall dairy goats in her arms. If asked to engage in an arm wrestling match with her, Draco would respectfully decline out of self-preservation.
Harry felt the burn of embarrassment. He rocked on his heels.
“Harry.”
many books. The sight dizzied Harry.
Abruptly, Ginny inspected the broom in her hand. She cast the charms on it. Her spellcasting was quick, her movements tight and her words barely a whisper. She had a look of utter concentration on her face. It was so different from Luna’s casting, which was airy and light, with broad, soft wand movements and lyrical incantations. They suited each other, he realized.
“Though some with unrefined tastes can’t appreciate the history that went into that. They treat it like a shot of tequila,” Malfoy said.
“Wait. Xeno—” Harry stumbled over trying to say the rest of Luna’s dad’s name. He gave up; Luna would forgive him for having a twisted tongue. “Xeno was here?”
Harry spluttered. “What?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. It was fun, catching him off guard.
“Harassment! You want harassment! What was up with your booby-trapped door!”
“Really.”
“Non-magicals,” Luna corrected easily. “We do. We teach restorative agriculture.”
No, though. Apparently, he’d just spent so much of the last twenty years in the wizarding world—the Ministry, Grimmauld, magical districts and neighborhoods—that the Muggle world had moved on without him. He passed groups of people standing around, tapping at touchscreen computers. A security guard on some kind of upright scooter that glided by, silently.
Malfoy glanced in the wall length mirror behind the counter and then back at Harry. “Hmmm. Nope. Still there.”
. It’s been fifteen years, and Malfoy still gets under his skin.
Harry gave himself a shake. He looked at his food and stabbed up a radish. “I reckon he’d rather not want to see me.”
He tucks the box under his arm and leaves, giving a wave to everyone whose desk he passes on the way out, aggressively polite. People don’t meet his eye, though they glance at him surreptitiously, and there is fear in their faces as well as curiosity. That’s when he realizes he hasn’t been a part of this team for a while. There’s no one that he wants to stop and say goodbye to. No one has been friendly with him for months, and he knows it’s his fault. He’s pushed everyone away. He’s glad that Alex isn’t here today. Alex is the only person who would talk with him, who would pull him aside and ask what had happened, where he was going, and was he sure he wanted to take this course of action?
that?”
“I don’t have to be a Quidditch star to go flying. I fly for fun all the time. You forget I have Ginny for a friend.”
Ginny. He hadn’t realized how much.
“It’s not something Ginny and I tried,” Harry said, and knew he sounded defensive.
Harry ignores that and sweeps the potatoes into the bowl with the carrots. “Bate was an arse, but Hills kept it brief.”
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
Draco slammed the final book in place at the top of the stack and slapped his notes down on it. “I think you’re in no place to defend anyone right now, Potter. Anyway. I need lunch.”
He walked a while down unfamiliar streets till he came to one that was more familiar, and he realized he’d come to one of the magical alleys—the one with the hat shop. He immediately dismissed the thought of visiting Sophie and the hats. Maybe sometime before he left, he would go in and say goodbye—but not when he risked getting sucked into making sales.
Draco strode in the direction of the sound.
“You’re awful quiet,” Ginny said, nudging his foot with her toe. Harry could hear the smirk in her voice.
“Where will you be staying?” he asked.
, that someone has been so able and inclined. There is something in the moment that echoes a memory: one grip in another, pulling, the gleam of frightened eyes in firelight.
“Shut up. I’m tired, as you well know.” Too tired, in fact, to tease her for saying “
“No. Not at all. I.” He could feel the heat working its way up his neck. “I know gay people. I was just. Surprised.”
“Oh?” Malfoy said, eyes glinting with malevolent humor.
“Latte with a shot of caramel,” a familiar voice said.
Before he could properly respond, Ginny came at him with the biggest yellow flower in the bunch and stuck it behind his ear. She grinned, gave her wand a wave, and Harry felt the prickling sensation of a Sticking Charm.
“Look alive. Loser spills his guts. Thank Salazar you’re not in the Slytherin common room. Loser took a dose.” Malfoy mimes tipping back a vial.
To his relief, she brightened. “You should! Do you need company?”
“I know.”
“Here, Potter. Look,” Malfoy said, and showed Harry the head-shaped torture device with the screws, which turned out not to be a torture device but some kind of beauty-measuring contraption. It didn’t make any sense to Harry, really. He got distracted from Malfoy’s explanation by the thought that Aunt Petunia would have used something like this, and Harry didn’t know if it was a good thing or a bad thing that she’d never been introduced to it.
“Nothing. Forget I said anything at all. Flying was nice. I’m sorry I brought that up.” Then: “Are you going to finish that, or just mangle it?”
“For me? Yes. Don’t worry though, Potter. It’s beyond your comprehension level.”
“You’re welcome. And thank you. I haven’t sold this many hats since Christmas.”
, he crooned.
“To simple tastes,” Malfoy says, with a nod of his head and a lift of his eyebrow.
beer was doing (when in fact they were only being drunk and obnoxious): brought their natural charm and charisma to the fore (if they had any).
“Package delivery sounds nice,” Ginny said with a completely straight face. “You’d have to learn how to drive, though, Harry.”
I’d kiss your arse, Malfoy.”
Malfoy leans forward. “No fucking way.”
“And you just happened to access that file.”
Harry looked down slowly. “What?”
Out of habit, Harry Apparated to the alley near Malfoy’s coffee shop. He realized it when he stepped onto the pavement and looked down the street to see the familiar big windows. He paused, then turned and walked in the other direction.
Malfoy sat, seeming completely unaware of the effect he was having on Harry. “Have you ordered yet?”
Harry dumps his handfuls of weeds into a pile and brushes dirt from his palms. He doesn’t really allow himself to think about what he’s doing, only goes to the kitchen sink to wash the remaining dirt away, wanders into the drawing room, and throws floo powder into the flame, calling out Malfoy’s address.
“And what about you?” Parkinson said to Malfoy. She’d turned the hat to a rakish angle. “Did you ever take my advice and find an assistant manager to help with your disgusting schedule?”
Malfoy’s gaze drops to his plate. He picks up a piece of shortcake. “I liked seeing you knocked down a peg for once.” The grey eyes flick back to him, and he mutters, “Not so much anymore.”
Malfoy scowls. “Did you even stop to question what that means?”
She sighed. To Draco, she said, “Here. Trade you?” She held up a small wheel of cheese.
Malfoy blinks. “No, you may not.”
Draco’s smile held a hint of something Harry had never seen before—a sweetness, and Harry had the immediate image of a young Draco in the Great Hall receiving a parcel before the Christmas holidays, face lit up with that same genuine pleasure.
The kitchen still felt unfamiliar. The bones of it were recognizable—the shape hadn’t changed—but the space appeared more open and light.
The file stretches back to Malfoy’s school days and includes his alleged and confirmed activities related to Voldemort. Harry skims the list with a morbid fascination, his skin tightening.
Besides, who had time to worry about a lack of a social life when you were eyeballs-deep in investigating an illegal potion ring?
“Not enough.”
Stricken, he said, “And what if I want to know for myself?”
“Potter. What a pleasant surprise.”
Downstairs, Arthur was enjoying a Firewhiskey with Ron over a game of chess while Molly swept the final cobwebs from the corners of the sitting room.
“Mmm, no. That would be more complicated than taking the entire ward system down. But there is a break built into the wards about half a mile south. Most of the small animals know to pass through that way, but hatchlings won’t know about it. I imagine they’re confused, having just been born.”
.” The suggestion sends an immediate lance of fear and nausea through him. Malfoy flinches, and Harry says again, in a more even tone, “No.”
“Not—not fair,” he gasped.
“Getting ready for bed like a normal person.”
