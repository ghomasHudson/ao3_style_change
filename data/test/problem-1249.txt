Narrowing his eyes, a little, Harry tilted his head slightly.
Ron shook his head slowly. “Well, that doesn’t surprise me. He did sleep with one of his old bodyguards. Or was it two of them? I don’t really remember.”
Malfoy giggles. “Do you like it?”
“Can I help you?” he said, with a drawling voice.
that he didn’t have one, that why he was fucking around that easily—but, who knows really? There are all kinds of relationships in the world.
“Why do you want to drink a coffee at midday? Are you a coffee addict or something?”
Harry holds out his package and Ron took one with a grateful nod. The brunette watched him as he lights up the cig, taking a long puff before resuming his monologue.
Just when he wonders if boredom could kill a man, the curtain flies open. Draco steps out with a proud smile, one hand resting on his hip.
“Master Draco,” Dobby said and his eyes flickered toward both of them, but Draco eyes were only on Potter. The elf bends forward and disappears with a pop, letting the two of them inside.
“I’m not done with you yet.”
“Shut up and fuck me.”
She makes a grimace, both contrite and concern, before bowing again.
Was she lonely? Here, alone with just some old books to keep her company. No one to remember her – not even her own son.
“I want to go to the Muggle side,” he declared with a beam.
There were a few footsteps and then Potter was next to him, facing the window as well. “It sounds like the two of you got on fine then?”
Much later that evening he spent his time boiling the first collection of sap into a thick syrup, enjoying the almost spicy smell that filled the cabin.
doing here!?”
“What the fuck is happening to me,” Draco whispered, clenching his eyes shut, his heart racing.
“Well, that’s nice, I guess,” Potter said, frowning. “Was it a, er, good visit?”
Draco was just contemplating reaching over to the half-empty glass of water on the table next to the bed when a woman wearing bright green Healer robes entered at a brisk pace, followed by Potter.
The owl let out a piercing shriek and remained on the perch.
“No, but they did demand a considerable amount in reparations. I decided to hand over the Manor since there was no way I would ever step foot in there again, and it was worth more than the gold they wanted. Though I did keep the woods on the grounds,” he added, gesturing around him.
He ignored Potter’s snort and replied patiently, “Yes, Hermione. Thank you.”
After that, it was as though a switched had been flipped and they could hardly keep their eyes and hands off each other.
Draco frowned slightly, then called out, “It’s open!”
She pursed her lips. “What have you managed so far?”
Draco let out a shaky breath, his forehead dropping against the man’s shoulder, momentarily overwhelmed by the tenderness in his voice.
die. And even once they had you under stasis here they had no idea what was wrong with you! Hermione needed to go out and consult with a muggle doctor and then come up with her own treatment. I—just please, don’t fight me on this.”
“I don’t believe that sort of help exists.”
Then he waited, continuing his simple routine of attending the horrid Ministry-mandated classes, and otherwise remaining his small section of woods.
“No, I don’t have a hidden torture dungeon here, if that’s what you’re implying,” Draco said tiredly. He just wanted his
“Then you can live with your mother for the next month.” There were a few beats of silence while Draco considered how much of a nightmare
He felt his throat tighten. “I’m not certain yet. Potter and I can probably meet you in the Atrium,” he said, hoping the words didn’t sound as strangled as they felt.
“Not anymore, no. At first he seemed quite frustrated, but after he asked what I thought you might be working on he’s calmed down. I think the visits have been good for him,” she said.
“And the options are yourself, or my mother?” he finally asked, looking over.
“Malfoy.”
The other man nodded, appearing to be mulling something over, then shook himself. “All right, I’ll keep that in mind. Later, Malfoy.” There was a loud crack an instant later.
He hadn’t needed to wait long for the books he’d ordered to arrive and those kept him occupied while the leaves outside turned to rusty oranges and fiery reds. Those same leaves were just starting to fall a few weeks later when his usual late afternoon nap was interrupted by the loud crack of Apparition outside and his eyes snapped open.
He snorted. “What, carve a tub from rock? Or what, wood? I’m not going to chop down a thousand-year-old tree for something wide enough to make a decent one.
It was a relaxing way to spent the afternoon, he decided, walking the woods, keeping an eye out for the papery bark, listening to the sounds of the shifting temperatures as branches creaked, as melting ice dripped to the forest floor, and as birds called to their neighbours.
“Reading my post now, are you? If I’d bothered to think about it, I’d have guessed you might have left your unfortunate stalker behaviour behind. Say, a decade ago.”
“Yes. Like I said, she’s intense.”
“Are you staying?” the man asked after a few more minutes of silence.
Potter looked completely miserable. “After the classes are you done with your sentence?”
Then his eyes widened in alarm as a burning heat filled his mouth, only to be momentarily blinded by a flash as Potter, the bane of his existence, snapped a photograph of his pain and suffering while he laughed merrily.
He was aware of Potter’s receding footsteps but decided it didn’t really matter to him what the man was up to, so he finished his work, made his marking on the ground, then circled back around to the front to stow the spade. He then found Potter slowly walking around one end of the cabin, running a hand along its log wall while he looked at it as if he hadn’t ever seen it before.
Draco considered, then suggested, “How about infusing the broom with a protective potion? I wouldn’t want to do anything topical in case it wears away, but if it’s absorbed into the wood. . . .”
They sat in silence for a few minutes longer, each of them intermittently drinking their tea, when Potter abruptly commented on his change of clothes.
“Make your own kid if you want one, Malfoy, this one’s coming home with us,” Weasley said loudly as he reached down and scooped Eddie up, swinging him up in the air and surprising peals of giddy laughter from the child.
“You don’t have to, I get it,” was the hurried reply.
The hot shower did wonders for his sore joints, and he spent some time running his fingers over the strange skin discolouration on his chest. Upon closer inspection it seemed to be focused in the same area as the fine white lines that remained of that incident in Myrtle’s bathroom all those years ago. Perhaps the nature of the curse scars had prevented the rash from fading during his hospital stay.
The weight of it felt glorious on his tongue and the taste, the smells, they filled his senses. Draco savoured the moment, briefly overwhelmed before the stinging in his scalp grounded him and he moved, mercilessly sucking him down, one hand stroking himself while the other held onto Potter for dear life. He heard groans and gasps from above him, each sound prompting an uncontrollable moan from himself.
Vince gave him a narrow look and shuffled a bit on his perch.
She appeared to consider, then replied, “Hmm, no. I’ve already made plans with Anthea tonight.” Potter then gave her a pleading sort of look, and she responded with a laugh. “Oh, fine. I’ll go see him off.”
His lips quirked slightly and he concentrated on the weight of the arm on his chest, and the fingers that were tracing lines across his ribs.
“Not for another few weeks.”
Draco was abruptly pulled out of the unpleasant turn of his thoughts by the sight of Potter taking a seat in his chair. As if he had any right to.
“Endless travel around the world wouldn’t even be an inconvenience, from a financial perspective.”
During the weekend he dug out his book on plumbing that he’d bought the previous year and set to work rearranging the pipes, preparing the hookups for when the bath would be installed, transferring the existing facilities from the little nook with the curtain into the new space. Plumbing was one of the few things in the cabin that he helped along with magic, though he did use actual physical pipes, connected to an actual nonmagical water source. He just didn’t want to deal with the mess of a pipe bursting, or things not draining away properly.
His partner’s grin strangely grew, and Draco felt a surge of
He sat down in his chair and flipped open one of his science books on his lap to read while he slowly sipped at the broth. When he found that his thoughts were drifting too much to be able to focus he set the book aside, and instead curled up inside his quilt, allowing his mind to wander.
“Did you need anything else?”
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, and Draco watched as the smile turned to a look of shock before Potter spun around toward his friend. She had leapt to her feet and was swiftly scooped up into a hug.
“Er, it can give you skin cancer? Why?”
The rest of the day passed agonisingly slowly. He thought it odd, given that his time in Potter’s house had been fairly lazy and unproductive overall, but a long walk through the woods failed to settle him, and he found himself unable to focus on reading for more than half an hour at a time.
“Draco, we’ve had posh food at every island stop so far. You can have your caught-an-hour-earlier whole grilled octopus tomorrow when we get to the next port. Tonight we’re doing souvlaki.”
“You are disgusting.”
“What,” he said flatly, watching impassively as Potter spun around sharply toward him, then stared.
“Good morning!” she said cheerily once she was indoors. “A bit brisk out today.”
He took a breath. “Anyhow, I do need to get going, regretfully. I hadn’t intended on staying over, so. . . .”
“Hmm.”
“I appreciate the forewarning.”
“Okay. . . . Then I can probably get those together within the next few days. Are you going to be working on them here, or at the Manor?”
He kissed the nearest patch of skin in response, and faintly heard Potter’s breath catch.
Draco opened the door and gestured them through, leading the way to the clearing.
Draco sighed and tilted his head back toward the sky, allowing the snow to fall onto his face. “I explained why I don’t even think it’s worth a discussion. I’m not the sort of person that people want to help. However much they may claim to only be interested in the work, or to be forgiving, no one wants to look past my history.”
Swing.
“Oh, for—” Potter huffed, rolling his eyes, then grabbed his arm and hauled him down the hill until they bottomed out in a wider intersection, taking a quick look to either side before strolling leisurely across.
Another crack, so loud it might have been directly overhead.
Once they’d arrived back at the cabin Potter followed him inside so Draco threw together some sandwiches for both of them and put the kettle on.
And this was exactly the reason that Draco hadn’t wanted to get involved in the mess that was his mother’s manipulations. Just seeing what Potter had managed to tangle himself up in over the course of a few hours made him want to return to his cabin. He sighed, raking a hand through hair and looping it into a knot.
“Nope. Tamper-proofing—” Draco glared “—but yeah, I might be able to disable that too.”
It had been the 11th of January when they’d gone to test the brooms. He was looking at the tree, wondering what it was still doing up when he felt Potter give his arm a brief squeeze before releasing it.
He dropped a wet kiss to the collarbone that was right there while he tried to hold onto his sanity, then with a twitch of his fingers he summoned his wand to his hand, a small part of him aware that there was something different about the grip but not caring as he then used it to summon whatever oil existed in the kitchen, dropping the length of wood again when a bottle slapped into his palm a few seconds later.
"If I ... if we're dead, don't cry for us, all right? I know we haven't had a long life and I know how unfair it is to leave you alone, but don't cry. You must go on and you must help Severus and Remus, not to despair, you must help the many orphans, will you do that for us?" he wanted to know and his voice broke too. Harry came to him, knelt beside him at the feet of the woman he barely knew and nodded. Narcissa looked at the two young men, who were still almost children, and her tears ran without stopping, but at some point she put a hand on each of their cheeks and nodded.
"Oh yes, they are crazy about each other. Believe me, I was in Severus' head!"
"Luc ..."
"Good morning, Mr Zabini, up so early on a Saturday?"
"Well, do you want to talk about that? So about yesterday and your injuries?"
Harry and Draco were lying chest to chest in bed together. Draco had one arm wrapped around his friend, his hand rested on his bare chest. Only through skin-to-skin contact could they keep the pain at bay. Gently, Draco caressed the other. Neither of them found sleep.
"Hey, don't do that. They're just scars and they don't define who you are, okay?", Draco had stepped up to him and smiled.
"So, today we're going to the forest to see what our bowtruckle are doing," he said and led the way.
"Fine," Draco said, pointing his wand at Blaise and only moments later his wand flew through the air. Irritated, the Slytherin looked around.
"Yes, it was wet, I couldn't think of anything else, unlike your kisses," Harry said, grinning.
"Take care of yourself," Harry growled, but the Ravenclaws kept going. Draco was seething with anger.
"Nice, so really nice," Harry said.
"We don't know, but supposedly he's on his way here. You-know-who has nothing left to lose," Draco said.
"Into you," Draco said with a grin.
"It doesn't matter, we haven't been a couple for a while."
"I know how bad that sounds now, but now it doesn't just affect him and that troubles me even more," Severus stared at him, understanding what Dumbledore meant. He felt dizzy for a moment and lowered himself back into his chair.
"I don't know. I'll talk to Dumbledore and then we'll have to separate them from the Slytherins first of all. I think ... well, I'll take them both to my place. I have one free room. Draco and he need to pull themselves together and stay together at all times. No one must know how serious it really is and that it could kill Potter," Severus said and sighed.
"I knew you liked to keep things to yourself, but I didn't think you'd be so stupid as to keep something like this a secret," Harry heard his own voice say coldly. He quivered with anger, what did Snape know.
"Come on Mione, we'll give my parents a hand," he said. The young woman looked once more at Draco and Harry, then let Ron take her away.
"It will," Lucius said, squeezing her hand.
"Yes..." at that moment Severus Snape came through the door. He looked at the two boys inquiringly and Harry was already about to pull his hand out of Draco's in front, but Draco held him tight. Severus said nothing, took off his cloak and sat down in the armchair facing the couch where Harry and Draco were sitting.
"You're lying, what's going on? Ron and Hermione are completely unhinged, so the truth please!"
"Go on Potter, not that you're late," Blaise said with a smile and stepped to the side. It wasn't a sneer and a snide smile, it was genuinely honest. Irritated, Harry nodded and continued walking, after a few moments he turned again and Draco's and his eyes met. It was only a tiny moment, but it triggered something in him. Without realising it, he was suddenly standing in front of the classroom. Sighing, he knocked and entered. His courage sank when he saw that a cauldron had been set up, complete with ingredients.
"Ready!" said the latter and they were both gone, followed by Narcissa.
"All right then, come on Potter, and I certainly won't be sitting at the Gryffindor table," Draco said and trudged ahead, making sure that Harry followed him. Harry looked once more at the teachers before joining Draco.
"Nothing!" came from the two young men simultaneously.
"Come on Potter! I have to go to the bathroom and we have to get to class," Draco urged. Harry nodded and stood up, eager to follow the Slytherin, who quickly disappeared into the bathroom.
"What's wrong?"
"Not only Potter, we don't know what will happen if this one dies. In the worst-case scenario, Draco dies too."
"Here's to the here and now, I suppose that's all we can drink to," Severus said and they toasted. They were silent for a while, but Severus could feel Remus watching him closely.
"Sure, but then keep that...", Harry made a sweeping motion around himself, "...for yourself too!"
"I'm watching and well Lily," Severus explained, smiling as gently as Remus had ever seen him.
"Oh no? Those are torture marks from a blood feather, something forbidden in the wizarding world for centuries," Severus said sternly. Harry held his gaze and said nothing.
"Please, I don't want this."
"Do I have a choice?" said Harry, swinging his legs out of bed.
"Have you heard of Horcruxes?" he began, and almost immediately Ron and Blaise looked at Hermione, who just shook her head.
"I hate to interrupt, but we should get going," he said softly.
"Tell me about him," Severus said.
"That's my business!"
"Tell me," Lucius sat down on the bed with the two of them and looked anxiously at his wife.
"Now?"
"Yes, all right, but I can show you the movement, that is the technique, and now come," Remus said, pointing to the table.
"Very nice Harry, you can stroke her. She likes you," said Hagrid. Harry reached out and ran his hand through the animal's soft fur. Draco was completely fascinated. Not only by the animal, but by the effect it had on Harry. The Gryffindor's eyes lit up and he seemed completely relaxed. Now the unicorn briefly rubbed its head against Draco's cheek as well before turning and disappearing back into the forest with the foal. The Slytherin froze, this brief touch seemed almost a silent invitation, but for what?
"And you-know-who created a Horcrux?" asked Draco at one point. Severus Snape sighed.
"Don't worry Mr. Malfoy, he will be fine. In two or three days you can go again."
"Do you like it?", Draco wanted to know. Harry looked out at the sea, on whose horizon the sun was slowly disappearing. He couldn't remember ever having seen anything more beautiful. He looked at Draco, who was standing next to him, his gaze also fixed on the distance. Harry smiled and, as if he sensed it, Draco turned his gaze to him. Immediately Harry blushed and hoped that it was not noticeable in the evening sun.
"You'd better not tell anyone," he said, then everything was quiet. Harry turned over as well and soon he was asleep.
"Oh yes! Can we blast something again then?" the boy exclaimed, hopping up onto the couch with Severus. Draco and Harry looked at the man, who smiled apologetically.
"What?"
"This is your room. The bathroom is across the hall and we share it, so I hope you two don't take forever in the morning. Here in these rooms you have permission to call me by my first name, so I will do the same. As soon as we are in class or in the corridors, this does not apply, understand?"
"Remus ... I'm sorry," Harry said, swallowing hard. The werewolf looked at him questioningly and put a hand on his shoulder.
"I'll take you back to my flat. Remus will gather the Order and I'll inform the other teachers. We will protect the school and you."
"It doesn't or I wouldn't have offered and now Lupin, excuse me. I need to sleep, tomorrow will probably be the hardest day of my life. Narcissa and Lucius are coming around late afternoon," Severus said and stood up.
"Aren't you a couple?"
"Oh Lupin, find a hobby, or a wife! Anything at all. Your work at the Ministry doesn't fill you up, does it?" Severus looked questioningly at his friend. He and Remus had a bond, especially Harry. Lupin, like the boy, had needed comfort and support after Sirius had died. So in the meantime he spent a lot of time in Spinner's End when there were holidays. Now Remus made a throwing gesture with his hand.
"What else have I missed, apart from your victory over the Dark Lord?", Harry now wanted to know with a grin.
"Yes, but surely the cut was not deep enough either, in any case they looked after me and left me more or less alone for a few days. But surely only out of fear of the neighbours' gossip if a dead youth were to be brought out of their house," he said bitterly.
"We'll only be gone two weeks!" interjected Severus.
"We are happy for you!" said Narcissa and again tears ran down the woman's face. Draco stood up and knelt in front of his mother.
"No, I'm sure he didn't but he was on the verge of a breakdown and that could have ended badly. You fell in love, didn't you, that's what you wanted to say?" Severus then asked.
"If you mean and now, who was it?", Draco wanted to know with a grin.
"No," was all Harry said. Draco put on his clothes and sighed.
"Why I don't fight back? Draco, this is my home! Hogwarts is the only home I know and if I defend myself then I can't go back. You know I'm not allowed to do magic and certainly not in front of Muggles."
"Oh, Pansy, I'll do other things with him," Draco said and kissed his husband fleetingly. One might have expected the hall to become noisy, but the opposite was the case. It was so quiet you could have heard a hippogriff feather fall to the floor.
"What was that about?", Ron wanted to know.
"Godfather, yes. But this has to stay between us, okay?"
"We'll handle it. Stay with Harry," Lee Jordan said, addressing Hermione and Ron, whose job it actually was to lead the Gryffindors into the dungeons. Gratefully, they both nodded.
"Not really, well not like that by any means, not like I'm happy. Until a few months ago, I thought I would marry some woman to keep our family's reputation," he said.
"Why were you defending me earlier, me and the Slytherins?" asked Draco simply. Harry looked up and swallowed briefly before answering.
"Do you want me to help you with your homework for Snape?"
"Remus, I told you I don't hold a grudge against you, really! I ... I love you, I really do and your, my, our past doesn't matter anymore," for a moment Remus looked at the other in complete surprise, then he leaned forward and kissed Severus gently.
"Er ... I don't want to say anything, but you can't Apparate inside Hogwarts," Draco interjected.
"Shhh ... it's over honey, he's alive and so are you. All is well. Come on, let's get him out of here," Narcissa said quivering and stroking her son's tangled hair. Gently she pulled him to his feet while Lucius bent down and lifted Harry in his arms.
"You don't look very happy. Didn't it work?" he wanted to know worriedly and let the boys enter.
"I'm so sorry ..." he sobbed. The Slytherin stretched and turned on the light again.
"And he said that if you ...", Harry looked at Severus.
"He's been doing it for six years, why should I do anything about it now?" replied Harry tonelessly.
"Dray, we ... we can't really get married anyway, how can we? Being engaged to you is enough for me," Harry said.
"No, not that I know of, it's not actually wanted. Soul bonds are very, very rare and soul mates don't want to break the bond at all."
"Mr. Zabini, Mr. ... er ... Weasley, you help me with these two, the rest clean up and then leave," Slughorn instructed. Harry felt Ron's grip under his arm and let himself be pulled along. Ahead of them walked Draco and Blaise.
"Sleep and tomorrow you talk to him."
"I love you," he said and kissed Harry's neck.
"You are so selfless," she said.
"What else? Any pain?" Hermione wanted to know.
"Sit down there on the bed," he said, and the two of them did as they were told and immediately grabbed each other's hands again. Worried, Severus saw that they were breathing clearly, which meant that the pain was probably getting worse. It took a quarter of an hour before Madame Pomfrey came to them.
"We'll take care of Dad," Draco said with a smile.
"Whatever you say," he said, corking his potion. It hit Harry harder than he had thought that Draco was obviously pissed. So they spent lunch in Snape's rooms in silence and walked to Defence in equal silence. Here Draco and Harry were left holding the bag. They were practising unsaid disarming spells. But that only worked if they stood further apart, further than two metres. And so Harry and Draco sat next to each other against the wall and watched the others practising.
"I ... we should get going, if it's okay. Miss Granger and Messrs Zabini and Weasley, will be at my door in half an hour," he then said hesitantly. Draco nodded and stood up, pulling Harry with him.
"Can swallow your pride?"
"Um ... yes," he said uncertainly.
In the hallway, Molly and Arthur Weasley were standing talking to Kingsley when the two of them joined them.
"Okay, are you all right?" asked Remus, a smile flitting across the teacher's face. Severus knew immediately what was going on.
"What is it? You don't have to be ashamed or anything, there's nothing there that I haven't seen before," he said as nonchalantly as possible, even if he himself didn't feel one hundred percent comfortable.
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong?"
"Of course Lupin and now let me in!" the latter said and pushed past the man into his flat.
"Which isn't," Harry said wanly, looking to Snape.
"Hey, are you all right?" the latter asked and Harry turned to him.
"In the kitchen," he said, and immediately the straw-blond boy with the green eyes ran past him.
"If you kiss me, she'll think that's why we've been gone all day and no one will be surprised if we make another quick getaway after curfew," Hermione said, now clearly red in the face. Ron looked at her and couldn't quite believe that he was suddenly so close to his goal. He smiled and said, "Okay sounds like a plan," and before Hermione could say anything else back, she felt Ron's soft lips on hers. She couldn't form a clear thought, which was certainly very unusual for the Gryffindor, and leaned into the incredible kiss. They only broke away from each other when whistles, cheers and shouts sounded in her ear. They looked up and the entire common room was staring at them. Some shouted congratulations and Ginny grinned all over her face, only Lavender Brown snorted and ran out of the room.
"Mum, please let him breathe," Draco said gently and the woman released Harry from the embrace.
"Ah Professor, good to see you. Come in," Lucius Malfoy said and let him enter. He closed the door a little later than one would. Severus put a finger to his lips, raised his wand and cast a few spells. Then he smiled at Narcissa.
"I don't know. I didn't wake up again until late in the evening. The hand was bandaged, the blood and the blade gone. There was a bottle of water next to my bed and that was it," Harry said, stroking the white scar on his wrist.
"Me too, but you know what. This, this feels right and we're going to enjoy it when the time comes, I promise you," the Slytherin said, stroking Harry's upper arms down to his hips and kissing him desiringly. Harry returned the kiss and knew that nothing more could happen to him with Draco by his side.
"I will ..." he sobbed.
"So I guess this is goodbye then?" said Blaise and swallowed before giving his best friend a hug.
"What? But..." stuttered Draco, looking to Severus, who sighed.
"We now know what the accidental potion did to you ..." began Snape and it was not only Draco who heard the deep concern in the teacher's voice.
"And me!", Blaise stepped forward and stood protectively in front of the two.
"I know Mione, but ... but it's hard to explain, maybe I can't explain it at all, but I want to put it behind me," Harry said wanly.
"What is it?" he wanted to know.
"Just a suspicion, but they were definitely closer than just friends!"
"What happened?", Harry wanted to know when they had detached from each other.
"I hope I'm not a one-night boy," Harry said, laughing. Playfully, Draco nudged him.
"You know!" he said without mincing words.
Yes, it's good to see you, Mione," Harry said.
"No, nothing more," Draco said.
"Here," she said, guiding her son's hand and placing it on Harry's chest.
"Well, everything. I mean, what would your parents say if they knew. Your father, he ... well, he's a Death Eater, isn't he? And you're chained to Harry Potter," Harry hadn't really meant to bring it up, but now it had just slipped out. He heard Draco breathing heavily today, then there was a rustle and the Slytherin turned the light back on. Harry blinked a few times and then looked at Draco, who didn't seem angry, but struck.
"It's okay, I believe it. I think it would be better if Poppy had a closer look at the injuries, but I don't want to do that without talking to him."
"No, never. Will you describe it to me?"
"Sorry, don't worry I won't say anything," he said with a wink.
"Severus, it's good you're here. I think some Death Eaters have been seen in Hogsmeade," she said. Severus looked first at her and then at Dumbledore, who was standing behind his desk, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
"Really? So kid, I've known you long enough, what's going on? Why don't you want to go on holiday with Draco? It's because of Draco, isn't it?" Harry buried his face in his hands.
"Ah yes, that's right, he mentioned something like that. Go ahead then. The two are back there in a separate room," the healer said, pointing behind her.
"I suppose it will have to go like this," he said resignedly and made bedding appear with the wave of the wand. The wand apparently obeyed him.
"Good. Remus, have the Order help and get the students to safety. Gather them all in the Great Hall and then we'll take them to the dungeons and from there to the secret passages," Dumbledore said. Remus nodded, went to Severus and kissed him briefly.
"No, and I'm sure I have a lot to make up for when I'm back in my body."
"Thank you and I am happy for you ... for you both," he said.
"You'll be fine," she whispered to him, then the two of them left the room.
"What's wrong?", Draco looked over his cereal at Harry, who was absently poking at his scrambled eggs.
"No, not like before. Something's not right. Come on Ron, we're going to Harry."
"Nothing, but if someone had told you a week ago that you would be lying in bed next to me one day and well .... would you have believed him?"
"Okay, now I'm even more worried, what's going on?", Remus wanted to know. Severus sat down with a sigh and told everything that had happened in the last days and hours. At some point the werewolf had jumped up and was pacing restlessly up and down the flat. When Severus told him about the Horcrux and its aftermath, Remus turned paler than ever and slumped back on the couch.
"Let's go," Lucius said, glancing one last time at the dead Voldemort and then leading the way with Harry in his arms. Draco, too, glanced once more at the now dead dark lord before grasping his mother's hand and leaving the clearing.
"Even so, that's no reason to treat you like that, you're not your father," Draco said. Harry laughed bitterly.
"Sure, but we'll talk about that when the time comes. Harry, I want you to know that you can always come to me. A suicide attempt, that's not something you just move on from. I want you to check in with Poppy regularly and come to me, whenever, if you don't think it's possible anymore, all right?", Harry looked at the man for a while, then nodded.
"I know, still," Remus said sadly as the door opened and Severus came into the room. Irritated, he looked around. They had pushed the furniture aside for practice, a fact Remus remedied with the wave of his wand.
"If the ... the Horcrux is destroyed, how .... or who is to kill Voldemort?" asked Harry hesitantly.
"It's still very early, let's go to Severus before the others all get up," Draco said and reluctantly detached himself from the Gryffindor. He nodded and gathered his things as well.
"What? Yeah, okay sorry ... um ... so you did?" asked Ron now very quietly. Again Harry nodded and sipped his orange juice.
"Talk, that's all. Harry tried to kill himself and that's not something you can just dismiss," Severus said, looking back at the Gryffindor.
"Well, I think we'll go and get Narcissa and Lucius. They've hardly slept the last few nights, let's see if they're awake yet," he said and looked at Remus, who nodded in agreement.
"How far away were you?" she wanted to know urgently. Draco shook his head in confusion, as if he was only now aware of where they were.
"Sev, you're not serious!"
"Yes ... Yes, I know, but then ... I'll just stay here with him in the summer, then he won't be alone."
"It's good that he has you now, or rather you have each other."
"O-Okay, so I'll see you later," Blaise said uncertainly and looked at his best friend. The latter only nodded weakly.
"Yeah, well, if ... if my parents had asked for it. You have to know, in the old magic families traditions are held very high, but apparently my parents are cooler than I thought."
"Not bad," he said.
"Yes he is, but I think I'm okay with you too," Draco said.
"They look so sad even in there sleep," she said softly.
"Sorry for what?"
"In the Room of Requirement. At least an appropriate atmosphere could be created here," said the Potions Master and Dumbledore nodded.
"Oh nothing, just that my dear son, finds Potter quite interesting."
"Is that ...?", Harry wanted to know and looked at Draco.
"Of course, okay wait...", Draco said and knelt down.
"All right?" asked Hermione quietly as they were busy repotting some potent herbs. Draco, who was of course standing close to Harry, pretended not to be there and was talking to Blaise. Harry glanced at him briefly and then nodded.
"Little brewing accident," Slughorn said, smiling.
"Yes, crap, I wanted to go to the bathroom," Draco said, smoothing his hair.
"W-Why are you doing all this?", Harry's voice trembled, as did his entire body.
"Er...hello sir?" he guessed. Smiling, Severus shook his head.
"Come on, let's go," Blaise said quietly and Hermione and Ron nodded.
"Honey, what does that mean?", Narcissa wanted to know.
"It's only fair. The boy is part of your family, or am I wrong?" Severus wanted to know.
"Remus, I know," Severus said placatingly.
"W-what?" he asked, confused, and Draco helped him sit up.
"The question is rather whether you really want to do that? In terms of you-know-who, it would certainly be good, but otherwise you seem to be ... very happy," Severus said diplomatically.
"Do you really think Sev will find a solution?" she asked now. They had hardly slept, fear for Draco and also for young Potter, had kept them awake. They both suspected that Draco found the other more than interesting and they certainly didn't want their son to be unhappy, but how were they going to help him now?
"Molly, I know that the boy belongs to your family, but I can't say anything now, because you would prevent it and ...", at that moment Dumbledore took the floor.
"So go slowly into the water until you are deep enough to lie on your back. Don't worry, I've got my hands under you, nothing will happen," Draco explained and led the way. Still hesitant, Harry followed him. The water was pleasantly warm in the small bay, but despite everything he had goose bumps. When he could just stand, Harry lay down on his back and spread his arms. Draco was right, the water was carrying him. He felt the other's hands on his back and enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness.
“Thank you, Ms. Brown, take 3 points for Gryffindor. Like many antidotes, the steps are exactly magically opposite of Amortentia, so we will be finishing it in this class and testing them in a controlled, private environment next class. There is a reason there are only 12 students in this class and 9 in my other. We are working with very dangerous potions.”
.  Perhaps it was psycho symptomatic, but Harry could taste the magic hanging damp and heavy in the air.
Father better be paying Poppy.
Spells went flying everywhere in a colorful cacophony.  Harry sent a nonverbal
The next day, Harry was in his Dark Arts class and desperately regretting waking up in the morning.  Breakfast had been fine, and so had Charms, but then he got to the DADA classroom and saw the blackboard with
-- if there was such a thing.
The rest of the day passed in a blur (from finishing up lunch to gossiping in Arithmancy with Pansy and Marietta while doing hieroglyphic hextangles to practically screaming at Sue about whether names or intent was more important in spell crafting).  Soon enough, he was sitting in his bed, the curtains drawn, quill in hand, staring at the black journal in front of him.  It took him a good seven minutes to gather up the courage, but eventually, he wrote out a simple:
“Why are you ssso obsesssssed with me??” Harry asked the Minister.
Harry had six minutes for the next step, so he quickly but carefully poured six grams of the dragon fruit gnats into the mortar and crushed them into a fine powder.  He then waited for the last two minutes and then turned on the hot flame and unceremoniously dumped the dragon fruit gnat powder into the cauldron.  Harry turned the flame back to low and waited for 12 minutes.  While he waited, Harry looked around the room and noticed that Finch-Fletchley was in the room, and Lavender looked more than a little queasy.
The students quieted down immediately and waited with bated breath to hear what the Headmaster had to say.  Many were startled by his announcement, especially Harry and his friends.
After several, long and painful minutes of watching the memory struggle, the memory took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and said, in a clear voice, “
Hey everyone!!  I hope you're doing well.  The doc I was working on was so impossible to wrangle (and this chapter was getting practically monstrous) so now I have two docs, and all of the chapters planned out (though they might be subject to change).  I didn't expect this story to be such a big undertaking, but I'm actually pretty proud of it and I'm so happy everyone else seems to like it!!
He continued, “I have set up partners for you based on your skill in charms from last year, but think of this as a pre-assessment.  Stand with your partner in a space in the room when I call your name.  Padma Patil and Ron Weasley, Lavender Brown and Millicent Bulstrode…”
, so check that out if you want!
Both the Minister and Harry looked up sharply when Professor Black snorted at that statement.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You will be getting new ritual clothes -- different ones for each rite --, and hopefully they’ll cover your frame.  You’ve been getting rather, dare I say, fat, so I better not see you pig out like normal at the dinner tonight.”

and from the tip of his wand, a nimble, silvery impala galloped over to join Hermione’s magpie and Draco’s hound.  The rest of the students had managed a shield and were told to practice till they could cast it for Thursday.
“That’s it?”  Harry asked, more than a little concerned.
Thank you so much for reading and the next chapter should be up soon!!
As usual, the next chapter should be up soonish!
He didn’t even care that in the deepest part of the Ministry, in a corridor filled with orbs of magic coated in dust, an

Back in the Potions classroom, Harry was listening to Professor Black call names for roll.
He shrugs. “Sure.”
Smiling genuinely for the first time since this morning, Draco drags the man with him toward the Leaky Cauldron. Potter wasn’t mad against him—and even if all his attempts were unsuccessful until now, he could feel that Potter walls were crumbling. Just a little push—that was all that was needed to make him fall.
He closes the door.
“They said a lot of things about me.” Potter responded. Draco leaned with her, as curious as she was.
His breath itches, and a choke moan escapes him. Moving again, he slides his hand further under him, parting his legs and exposing his intimacy, shuddering with anticipation.
him. Draco could see it in the coldness he was shoving, the silence he was giving. He hates everything the Malfoy stand for, and Draco knew it. And his father knew it too—but unlike him, Lucius was proud all the way to the moon, and they were no way in hell he would let a man like him slip out of his grip.
He grunted in response and lifted his head to look at them.
“Yeah,” he snorted, rolling his eyes. He leaned back, and the sly he saw before on his eyes returned. “I did some research, you know. On you.”
Breathing in, he raised his hand. His gaze was steady when he lifted the knock, three controlled strikes reverberating in the light mood of afternoon. He felt the wards wore off, and the gate opened himself as if it owned his own will, a loud rumbling coursing in the air.
A long sliver trail over his left eyes. Before he can stop himself, Harry lifts his hand and puts it gently behind his ear. His skin was smooth on his skin, and Malfoy blush a little.
Parkinson was the first to get out, stretching slowly with her hands above her head.
“Yeah, fuck” he lifts himself a little, and drove back. “Oh Merlin”

He let out a relief sigh. It was already humiliating enough that he had masturbated while fantasizing like a virgin without her being a witness. God bless her and her ability to sleep like the dead; with how noisy he had been, another person would have woken up.
And, as to support his words, he grabs the waistband and starts pulling it up. To his horror, Harry saw the material got up his legs and further and further until he could clearly see —
He really doesn’t like it when she does that; like she had something in mind, but just couldn’t bring herself to say it – either because she thought it wasn’t her place to, or just because she thinks it wasn’t important.
He closes his eyes and presses his lips right there, softly.
Harry sip on his glass. The alcohol was a good buzz in his guts. He scans the crowd and spot Malfoy in a corner, talking with Pansy. He was resting on his right leg, hip popped out, and he could see the way his skirt bounce when he moves. There was a space between the skirt and the socks, a bit of pale flesh that drags his eyes when the skirt shifts a little.
Harry stayed silent throughout the exchange, praying to Mother Magic that Father paid the house-elves, or at least wouldn’t get reported till Harry’s majority.  Merlin, Harry hoped nothing legal would happen before he graduated Hogwarts.  But at James’ pity party and Cousin Rhodesia’s steely gaze, Harry wasn’t too sure.
spelled his shoes to be silent, and crept up behind her.  When she couldn’t hear him anymore, she recalled the spell but was quickly disarmed and immobilized by Harry when he could see exactly where she was.
Eventually, he told them straight up it wasn’t anything personal, he just needed to be alone, and they hesitantly agreed and let him be. Harry went up to his room as quickly as possible, grabbed the diary and his invisibility cloak, and went to the Wishing Room. Pacing back and forth, he wished very, very hard for a room of lost things, and soon enough, a door appeared. Objects of all shapes, sizes, and colors were piled up to the ceiling, precariously balanced and one misstep away from an avalanche. Harry took a deep breath and called out, “
Hi everyone!!  I hope you're doing well!!  I am back with another chapter (very late due to finals week, I apologize), and this one is pretty heavy on the world/ritual building, so these are all my headcanons, stuff I picked up from other fics/tumblr, and ancient alphabets!  Slight T/W for self-harm (scratching and ritual based blood-letting).  More info on the ritual is at the end!
And the Minister was going to have him.  He never thought of taking a male in that way, but Harry was just so deliciously powerful.  Or maybe he could have the boy as his heir.  Anyway, who said it had to be one or the other.  The boy was delightful, and the Minister would have to duel him again sometime.  Too bad DADA was a lecture today, though it was fun watching his prey act all studious as if he wasn’t the most powerful being in the whole Hecate-damned room and could kill them all in a mere blink.  Oh, the Minister was going to enjoy this chase.
The rest of the Great Hall watched in abject terror as Harry, in a trance, rose from his seat and just stood there, direct eye contact with the Minister even as blood poured out his nose, eyes, ears, and lips.  People let out soft cries and covered the first and second years' gaze.  Eventually, he was released, and Harry crumpled into himself, collapsing onto the stone as the Minister looked on shocked and irate.  Sensing that Harry was in incredible danger, Draco and Hermione ran towards him and practically dragged him out of the Great Hall to the infirmary.  Headmaster Snape watched the proceedings, horrified but unable to do anything to help Harry.
While Susan’s charms work was outstanding, it was clear she was fighting a losing battle as Harry’s dueling ability came into play.  He made no mind of Professor Flitwick’s narration and began to cast verbal spells quickly and harshly.
tempestas harenae - a sand storm charm
and waited till his water was at 99 C º and then carefully measured out a third of the purpura brassica into the water and stirred three times counterclockwise, three seconds between each turn.  He repeated those steps methodically and precisely till all the purpura brassica was in the potion.
Daphne wasn’t seen the whole weekend and the following Monday and Tuesday, and Pansy, the notorious gossip that she was, refused to talk about it.  News still spread, of course, and as the names of their associates were leaked, the severity of the situation grew.  In raids looking at the friends of the two already caught, Romilda Vane, a 6th year Gryffindor was caught trying to dispose of Amortentia ingredients with her friend Leanne Maxwell, and Morsen Johnson, a 5th year Hufflepuff was caught with three kilos of tobacco-grade Alihotsy and a sack of Galleons.  All five of them were looking at three years in Sential Prison at minimum, and two years in Azkaban at maximum.
The trio was a few minutes late, so Professor Escrivá just raised a pencil-thin eyebrow, and Harry bashfully handed her the note from Professor Flitwick.  She let out an infinitesimal gasp, and her eyes widened.  Professor Escrivá then looked back up and waved them off, telling them to find seats and start taking notes.
Harry talks to Tom!  Everyone is terrified of the Minister!  What on earth is going on?? This was a fun chapter to write because I love the dynamic between Harry and Tom.  I hope you enjoy it!
and the three
” and cast a clumsy honey bear that clambered over towards Susan’s osprey and began to interact with it playfully.  The class looked on with awe and doubled down and continued to cast their charms.
He had to push that all to the side when people badgered him for answers -- not that he gave them any -- but he still had to turn them away and smile secretively.  Thank Mother Magic and Morgana that class was in five minutes, so he used that as an excuse to all but sprint to his Charms class.  Charms class was a welcome respite from the uproar at breakfast as Professor Flitwick would not have anything disrupt learning.  The previous class had been a lecture, so now it was time for the practical.
A thought hit him as he chewed the orangey fruit.
“It would be remiss of me to do so; after all, you were only a little third year.”
He took a deep breath and pulled out his biggest secret.  It didn’t look like much, but the plain black journal with a gold embossed name that he had found in the middle of his second year (he had pilfered it from the youngest Weasley when his magic called to it) on it was something he
It felt like coming home after years and burrowing your face in the pillows and oh
“Hello Professor Black,” they all chorused back.
“Darling, you’re spacing out again,”  Draco said, silky voice tiptoeing the line between friendly and outright flirtatious.
Hi!! So fair warning, there's mild blood and major creepiness from our favorite Minister.  This chapter is a lot shorter than the previous one, but it came to a natural close.
Harry’s second set of robes was a four-piece set, done in heavy black velvet and sickle-colored, silvery silk.  The high-collared top was first, gold buttons fastened into place with quick precision, and embroidery thread sewed itself as Topsy cut velvet with her fabric shears.  The pants piece was next, and pleats were ironed to a crisp fold by the palm of Topsy’s hands.  His skirt was draped and sewn into the belt piece that Topsy had decided fit better with the skirt than the top.  The cloak with its billowy shape and oppressive heaviness was the final part of the Black ritual robes.
Draco and Hermione made subtle eye contact with Harry, checking to see if he was alright.  He nodded, trying to be reassuring but unsure of how well he accomplished that.  Professor Snape stood, trying to regain control of the situation.
, and
An Unspeakable cloaked from head to toe in white linen, with only a mesh window for the eyes, walked up to them and spoke with a clearly altered voice, “Blessed Samhain.”
“I ssssmell green applessss becaussssse of Draco, dark chocolate becausssse of Uncle Moony, massssala chai becausssse it’sss ssssoothing, ink becausssse of Hermione, and vomit becausssse of Jamessss.”
“-raven black would be matching your hair better, but midnight black is being the Black family color-”
Harry slid on ivory slippers, which would be burned later -- it was a shame, given how comfortable they were.
Terry, of course, he’s excited for Alchemy Padma it’s such a fascinating subject.
And then, with the piercing note of a criyer, people began to dance.  At first glance, there was no rhyme or rhythm to the dancing, but as people found their tempo, pulling partners and children and cousins and aunts and uncles into dance, the plaza began to move in time.  A jaunty tune everyone knew played, and though there was no leading singer, everyone began to sing along, laughing and touching and being
to know more about this boy.  Just who was he?
I'm going to try and get the next chapter up quickly, but I make no promises.  And, as always, thank you so, so much for reading!!
Instead of dwelling on his anxiety, he ate the last few bites of french toast, and when the Great Hall was dismissed, walked straight to the library.  His assignments were already written in his school-distributed charmed notebook that teachers wrote a little summary of the class and the homework.  His friends rotated in and out of his table at the library, the only constant presence being Hermione, who had the same study day as him.  Draco and Cho dragged them out of the library for lunch, but otherwise, he spent the entire day catching up and reviewing.
At that last statement, Harry grabbed his stuff and Hermione’s hand and dragged her out of the Potion’s classroom, leaving a stunned group of students behind. The Minister took a deep breath and swept out of the room, going straight to his office; he did, after all, make a promise. Harry groaned and ran a hand through his hair, making it stand up almost vertically as Hermione patted his arm sympathetically. It wasn’t common knowledge that he was a Parselmage, but it wasn’t like he would receive negative backlash. Harry was more worried that all of his Merlin-be-damned secrets would get out before he finished his NEWTS.
"They seem shorter this year, don't you think?" Harry joked.  Knowing he towered over them satisfied him, given that he was the shortest boy in their year and two years below.
“You’re late.”
Some Information:
Professor Escrivá looked pleased and said, “Take three points, Ms. Dunbar.  It is, actually, a Dark Spell.  Mr. Macmillan, can you tell me why?”
Hermione and Harry got into a rhythm of writing and quietly conferring as the rest of their classmates finished up (they were the second group to have completed their potion). They pointedly ignored the hairs prickling up on the back of their necks and just outlined their body paragraphs.
In addition to his embroidered animal mask, Topsy made a white linen shift reminiscent of an overly simplified dress and braided a rope of crimson and cornflower blue for the annual rites.  Though no longer popular in family rites, even among the most old-fashioned, traditional way of dress was always adopted in the annual rites. So, it was most important to have a white shift, rope showing your family, and an animal mask showcasing status and family for the annual rites of Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lughnasadh, Mabon, Samhain.
Harry perked up, having bet several galleons that the first sorting would go to Hufflepuff.
Harry, Hermione, Draco, and the rest of the 7th years stood alongside the first years. They stood at the Ravenclaw exit as the first years walked single file towards them, Harry did a quick mental count, and the other 7th years did the same.  While they weren’t all prefects, as the oldest students, they had a duty to protect the youngest of them all.
"I h-have Double Remedial Potions first thing in the morning on my A Days AND Double NEWTS Potions bright and early on my B days!!  Well, I’m afraid it’s been a good year, my friends; I’m going to check if the carriages are still outside."
“Well, carry on then.  I’m enjoying the
Then the Minister got angry. “You will tell me why you smell green apples, dark chocolate, masala chai, ink, and vomit, Mr. Potter.”
Harry, Hermione, and Draco sat down next to Luna, Cho, and a very lost first-year Gryffindor.  They quickly showed the youngster (Viktoria Rowe) where she should be, and she thanked them profusely, skipping off to join her house.  Harry served himself oatmeal, dusting brown sugar over it, as the rest of the students who were not naturally early risers stumbled into the Great Hall.  Harry took note of who was here: the Slytherins were mostly all here, as were the Hufflepuffs.  Only about half Gryffindors and Ravenclaws were there, and all the teachers were present, including a very deranged looking Minister.
“Correct, but not exactly what I’m looking for.  Ms. Dunbar, can you help him out?”
The Headmaster continued, “We will begin the sorting now.”
Harry was glad he was towards the end of the class, and it was likely he would finish and be able to get a head start on his homework, but he was getting ahead of himself, so he focused back on his potion, and as the
The dinner was scattered with meaningless chatter: how was school, how is Little Cousin Aquila, what are some recent projects you’ve taken on, any new legislation?  It was mind-numbing and dull, though only made that way with James’ presence.  He refused to talk of anything but Lily.
Standing at the gates of Potter Manor, Harry took a sharp breath in, and on the exhale, pushed open the wrought iron door, letting the familiar copper magic bathe him in a wash of rust and citrus.  It should be comforting, but Potter Manor had never felt like home.
While Harry was sleeping, in the Headmaster’s office, an annoyed Dark Lord was grilling Headmaster Snape on everything he knew about the boy.  He had easy access to the school files and had already scanned it to learn it only had his name, age, date of birth, gender, mailing address, emergency contacts, courses, and grades. There was nothing more, nothing else of interest.
Come bother me on
“Get OUT!” snarled the Minister to the Great Hall. All the teachers ushered the students out as quickly as possible--out of the Minister’s ire and into safety.
The doc with all the chapters is over 100 pages and my notes doc (that has a list of the characters, the general outline, and a bunch of other stuff) is almost 20. And we're not even 10 chapters in :0
on Thursday, and to get full marks, you will be expected to cast a corporeal
“Hey,” Draco said, opening up Harry’s hand and passing the flowers over to the other boy.
Draco just groaned in response and put his head on Harry’s shoulder, his murderous mumblings muffled by Harry’s robes.  Harry just patted his head lightly and struck up a conversation with Anthony about Arithmancy.
“Exactly!”  Anthony added before continuing, “You could change trees into beasts, vines into rope, soil into ice, sand to glass, the list goes on!”
written on it in blocky letters and the surprisingly visible Dark Lord in the back corner writing something on a long parchment.  Harry sighed and dropped his forehead on Hermione’s shoulder.  Draco just patted his head sympathetically and led them to a seat in the front of the classroom.
Here's why I picked everyone's Patronus:
it felt good to see that -- not just because he needed it as a Horcrux, but as a Ravenclaw. He first cast detection charm after detection charm and carefully tugged away from the strands of evilness intertwined with the blue blue
Throughout the ritual, the Minister couldn’t help but feel the Potter boy’s irresistible magic, and oh, what a good heir he would make.  He was a Ravenclaw, to be sure, but a good Heir Slytherin he would make.  All the Minister had to do was wait.  All he had to do was wait.
“I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine.”  He repeated over and over as Draco cast all the detection spells he knew.  After Draco finished, his worries assuaged, Hermione, bundled them both up in a hug, slotting together like Matryoshka dolls.
Soon enough, though, he succumbed to sleep, and he slept till the next morning, unaware of what the future held for him.
They kept going back and forth, beads of sweat forming, as the rest of their peers won or lost their respective duels, and began to watch Susan and Harry’s duel.  Susan was unparalleled in charms work, but Harry had the advantage of being a much better duelist, so they were more or less equally matched, and it was showing.
over and over.
The Minister continued, “I wonder what happened to her, though.”
I have the next chapter written already, so that should be up soonish.  Thanks for reading and have a great day!! <3<3
with the Minister, something Harry was beyond grateful for.
“Thank you so much.”
Looking at the tapestry gave Harry a sense of pride, and it was with that sense of pride that he finally fell asleep, safe in the soft cocoon of his mind.
The rest of Harry’s classmates walked up, sniffed the vial, and reported their findings. Harry didn’t pay attention to them overly so (it felt almost like an invasion of privacy) except for Hermione’s (her’s was lemongrass, mint toothpaste, old books, and menstrual blood).
in 187.92 m/s2 gravity).
Like with the Amarenovis, I did make up the Pellisseato potion, so please use it if you want, and tag me if you'd like (I just want to see your cool works :P).
Harry thanked him again and grabbed his stuff.  He was immediately accosted by Draco and Hermione, who looked frantic.
Harry brushed his fingers over the sloppily trimmed bushes -- the family magic and ground enchantments had weakened over the years, and the house-elves had wasted away with the deaths of Grandmother Euphemia, Grandfather Fleamont, Great-Uncle Charles, Great-Aunt Dorea, and Mother.  Cousin Rhodesia was married to Heir Ingram Nott, so she was ineligible to inherit, and her magic had been pulled from the Potter Family at her marital rites, though her blood let her still perform remembrance rites.  Harry and his father were the only Potters left.
“I had forgotten ssssnakessss call me m’Lord.”
Day after day passed by, Charms, Potions, DADA, Alchemy, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, one after another.  Assignment, after assignment, spell after spell.  Harry went through sheaves of parchment and dozens of quills as the school year progressed.  He couldn’t wait till the next break -- yet he also dreaded it with every fiber of his being, because Harry knew he would be expected back home.  For the next break was Samhain.  Day of remembrance.   Day of the dead.
, which were a powerful lifting charm, the companion lowering charm, and the version of
Thankfully, the Minister kept his promise, and Harry spent the rest of the day and the subsequent weekend blessedly Minister-free. He caught up on all his work, finished his assignments, studied ahead, and finally, finally, got started on his house project. Each house had a final project that students had to create to showcase their talents and skills: Hufflepuffs did service projects, Slytherins had ‘if I had to change the world’ proposals, Gryffindors did impossible tasks from a list (ranging from retrieving three fae fruits to finding Atlantis), and Ravenclaws did research projects.
There used to be -- at least, according to the painting of Great-Great-Great Grandmother Melphia  -- a jewelry-maker house-elf, but no longer, so the only jewelry the Potter family had any longer was the rare heirloom and wedding gifts.  With the limited selection (wixen were buried with their jewelry), Topsy picked out the best accessories for his status and outfit and then proceeded to make his stag mask for the annual rites, complete with gold antlers.
Lunch was yet more mayhem, so Harry skipped it entirely and hung out in the library until it was time for Transfiguration.  He finished some of the Charms homework and felt quite accomplished when he walked into Professor McGonagall’s class.  Harry’s good mood was dashed by the magically taxing subject they were practicing: human to stone to human transfiguration.  He wasn’t the only one who had trouble with the subject since Helen Dawlish, Gregory Goyle, Hannah Abbot, and Vincent Crabbe all had to be sent to the Hospital Wing.  The whole mess of the Diadem hadn’t died down by dinner, and it didn’t die down until the weekend when a much more juicy topic was unearthed.  Aaron Woodbridge, a 7th year Ravenclaw, and Astoria Greengrass, a 6th year Slytherin were outed as having a pixie dust and blue genie elixir (along with other drugs) smuggling rings, bringing great shame to their families.
After everyone was in the classroom, books, and quills out, Professor Flitwick began lecturing.
Hermione and Harry looked at him unimpressed, but Draco remained unrepentant.
Harry shoved himself out of his mind-space back into his body and nodded, mumbling, “I really don’t want to do it, Professor.”
was perfect.
Some info:
“Don’t play coy; it doessssn’t ssssuit a man of your ssssstatus.”
He was stalling.
“I smell scorgio, strawberry chapstick, bergamot, and rotting fish.”
The three of them entered the classroom and scanned the room for the Minister.  They didn’t notice anything at first, but Padma discretely pointed out the warped shadows in the front right corner, and they took seats as far away from him as possible.  Professor Flitwick was sitting at his desk, and he greeted them with a smile, acting remarkably calm, given the concealed Dark Lord right next to him.  Harry, Cho, and Padma just smiled and waved before going over their notes as the rest of their classmates trickled in. It was a mixed house class as there were only two NEWTS Charms.
Susan cast a, “
The note Harry sent to Draco's rapist (retributum est peccatum) means retribution for sin, though I believe that was fairly obvious.
“Ah right, you gave statements,” the Minister said, distractedly, still leafing through his mental file.
Lisa looked calm as if she knew exactly where her sister was going to go, and she did because she was entirely unsurprised when “Hufflepuff!” was called.
Eventually, everyone’s chatter and small talk from all around the plaza died down with the unveiling of the platform where the seemingly omnipresent minister resided.  Despite his best effort, Harry zoned out during the Minister's speech, and when he refocused, the Head Unspeakable (denoted by their elegant lilac-lace veil) was on the podium.
Iron Knife - Tenacity and Strength
“Wonderful, take three points.  Mr. Malfoy, can you tell me the wand movement?”
Harry silently stood in the doorway and watched as a massive three-headed serpent slithered out of the man’s wand.  He smothered a gasp, and his eyes widened.  To have a runespoor as
Hyacinth Tears - Remorse (because that's how you put a Horcrux back)
That brought out some laughter from their peers as they all continued to eat.  Professor Flitwick walked over once everyone was more or less there (except for Rebecca Dawlish, who was always late to absolutely everything).  He went down the table with a clipboard and the stack of schedules.  Professor Flitwick could have easily charmed them all to each student, but he liked to catch up with his Ravenclaws and discuss their programs.
His father froze whilst cutting his sausage but quickly unfroze in attempts to act suave and guiltless -- but both Harry and Cousin Rhodesia could see otherwise.
He just smiled affectionately and let Padma, Sue, and Cho fill his plate with doi maach, white rice, and dhokar dalna.  He may not like his father, but he certainly appreciated their heritage and the gifts it gave him, namely parseltongue.  Harry sipped masala chai and let Anthony and Terry grill him over the spells he used and how he could improve, listening attentively and bemusedly.
“Hey!  I did. I just forgot.”  Harry said defensively.
Somebody was not as happy with their schedule as he was, as Draco let out a cry of horror.
“Take three points, Mr. Macmillan.  As you learned back in your first year, Light Magic uses latent magic and intent. Grey Magic uses either latent magic and emotion or inner magic and intent, and Dark Magic uses inner magic and emotion.  You will with Light Magic, but you have to want Dark Magic.  To cast a
It wasn’t alright at first, with Draco being all snobbish about Hermione’s status as a muggle-born and her home at Merope’s Home for Mundane-Borns, but they eventually made a close friendship that Harry wouldn’t change for the world.
Harry refrained from shifting from foot to foot, though he dearly wished he could.
hoping to catch Harry off guard, but he cast
“I’ll write you a note, so you don’t have to practice more magic next period. It wouldn’t do for you to get magical exhaustion.  What class do you have next?”
Harry eventually put it all behind him, and the rest of the school as well, to focus on his education.  He brewed Veratiserum in Potions class, well, the beginnings of it, as the potion took a full lunar cycle to brew.  Harry had worked himself into a loop for his Novo Novus project, so he mail-ordered some muggle books, but he had much more luck starting out his Alchemy project on limb regeneration.  It was a surprisingly undersaturated topic, so Harry had a lot of wiggle room to test out his hypothesis and other ideas.  Hermione had been quite giggly as of late which was both amusing and confusing -- of the three of them, Draco was the giggler.  Lots of Ravenclaws had been giggly, now that Harry thought about it.  Oh well, it wasn’t any of his business.
“Potter” Malfoy breath when they part their lips, and his voice was clouded with desire, eyes dark and cheeks flush.
With an oversize jacket on his elbow, he had looked himself in the mirror.
He was beautiful like this. With his hair messy, his skin flush red, and his skirt raise. Harry wants to eat him and never let him go again.
She didn’t seem impressed per se, and Draco had the awful feeling of being an angry cat in front of a scornful dog.
Harry lifts him. Malfoy startles, and closes his legs around his waist by reflex. They hip meet each other and they moan.
—and something like possessiveness roar inside him. No one was allowed to touch him.
She hummed. “You look like someone who has a crush.”
Draco closes the door and leans against it. It was strange, really, that this Potter seemed more real than the one he had rubbed shoulders until then. Of course, he was still reserved, but it was like the myth around him was gone. Maybe it was the situation that makes him think that. The simplicity of him, drinking a coffee while reading the newspapers—the normality that came with the act. Nevertheless, his eyes trailed over him, taking in each detail now that he could
“Me too.” He plays with his ponytail. “What do you want?”
Harry trusts, and trusts again, and leans and plants his teeth on the skin of his collarbone and bites, hard.
He goes down the stairs and walks toward the kitchen. Pausing in front of the door, he tries to catch some noises, but all he could hear was his own breathing. Was Potter actually there? And if he was, what was he supposed to say?
He shakes his head slightly, relaxing a little. “Does that mean that I exceeded your expectations, Sir?”
Maybe it was his self-destructive tendencies that tended to make them appealing for him. Maybe he was just that fucked-up. But there was something about them – something about their darkness that rubs him the right way.
The hall was large and wonderful. The ground was pure white, and the light seemed to glow through the tile. In front of him was a wide staircase, who seemed to lead to the first floor. The space was split in two, two wide wooden doors closed well. His eyes flicked around, mentally drawing a map in the back of his head.
Draco frowns. “Did something happen between the two of you?”
“So?” Longbottom asked, looking between both of them. “Who wants to get in who pants?”
“Yes, that. I have always wanted to try it.”
“I’m doing what must be done.” Because who else gonna do it? He wants to add, but the words never left his mouth.
, he was one of the rare that didn’t treat them like shit back then, but —
“How is he?” Theodore continued with mild curiosity, finishing buttoning his sleeve.
It wasn’t supposed to be maddening, but his eyes couldn’t help but follow the movement.
Potter turns his head toward him.
“Draco.”
“Mister wants to give me his coat, Sir?” Dobby asked, and Harry took off his coat. He handed it to the elf, who disappeared under it, pulling it close to his chest.
He didn’t dare look at him, afraid that he may meet his hard feelings again.
“Yes! I want to go to the thing with the big wheel.”
With that said, he didn’t even wait to be invited before he walks pass him inside the lounge. Like the first time he came here, he makes a point in looking around with curious eyes, before sitting on the couch. He crossed his legs like before, and stretches himself lazily, his body moving like a cat. He was doing in on purpose, clearly, but Harry couldn’t help but trails his eyes over the exposed skin, the curve just below his back and the sly movement of his tight waist.
He took off from the counter and walks toward him. Draco just stood there and craned his neck when he came near him. Even with his platforms on, he looks ridiculously small next to him. The thought wasn’t supposed to be thrilling, but somehow, it was.
But one thing at the time. There was still a long way to go.
Harry murmur again, and when the lube appears on his hands, he applies it on his prick, hissing when the pleasure it him.
“I don’t care either way, you know” he murmurs against his lips, exhaling the smoke in his face. Harry contracted his jaw and the boy smiled lazily.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek, because he feels like he was about to cry.
At his approach, he could hear the voice of one of the elves, sounding surprisingly distress.
When he steps out of the bathroom, thirty minutes later, Pansy was sleeping soundly under the blankets, her hair the only thing distinguishable among the bazaar that was on the bed.
“And I don’t even know who she was talking about!”
was a person, Lucius would be his perfect incarnation.
He seemed to deflate then, his eyes growing round with surprise – and even, maybe, relief. “You don’t?”
Draco stares at him – and for a moment, something seemed to waver in his eyes. But before Harry could grab it, the boy frowns and looks away. He bit his lips, like he was trying to say something, and huffed with annoyance – although Harry didn’t think it was toward him.
Potter hums again, and flips the journal without even a blink.
Potter grabs the two threads at the end. He pulls it abruptly, and a little whimper left him as he stumbles backward. His back collides with the man chest, and when he looks up—what a sigh he was showing, really. With his lips part and his red cheeks, he was like a bitch in heat, and this was so strange to him that he looks away.
“Afternoon, Mr. Malfoy,” he said equally.
Harry looks at him with a stern face, and after a few seconds, he bit his lips and let the skirt fall. He was pouting like a spoiled child, but at least he was listening—for once.
Relief washes over him. But with it came the need to run away again.
“I know what you’re doing,” Potter whispered. “You want me to fuck you that bad?”
“That's narcissistic.”
Rolling his eyes, he huffed in irritation. “Where do that sly come from anyway?” he grumbles.
Potter lifts—
Before he could regret it, Malfoy’s nod and tilt his head. Harry leans toward him, and when their breath melt, he shut his eyes and kiss him.
. The blond could feel it in his bones, dominant, nearly violent, and it makes him inhale sharply. It was suffocating, almost painful and yet gentle and reassuring in a strange way.
She seemed to dislike him, and the feeling was mutual.
“A Saviour, huh?” he waves his cigarette outside, and the ashes fell graciously. Moving his eyes on the road, he restarts the car, the light now green.
The man nods, without further emotions. “I see” he continued, with his
“Justin Finch-Fletchley.”
And just like that—he was gone.
“I hate you,” he said, sticking out his tongue.
The way he sounds was kind of mean, but Draco just shrugged his shoulders with derision. “What can I say? I’m a little self-destructive.” He pauses, then adds. “Must be a Malfoy thing.”
“Harry Potter!” he said with a loud voice, and Pansy giggles. Harry looks at him with a derisive shake of his head and walks over him.
It was suffocating, when he thought about this.
No wonder many had fallen for his charms.
He throws open the curtains.
). A thrill was making his body shook each time he squeezes the little ball of flesh.
The man bites and suck his skin, ravishes him in a way that made him see stars. His lower abdomen contracts, and just like that, he feels his orgasm coming. If he was in his rational mind, he’ll be embarrassed at how soon he was already close, but with the fog clouding his thoughts and the fire that was burning inside him, he could just whimper and curls his toes with how overwhelmed he was.
.” He huffed, and something rattle behind him. He must have changed his position. “I heard Harry Potter is your new bodyguard.”
Draco titled his head toward her, like he was intrigued, before blinking and turning his head toward him. “Harry Potter,” he repeated.
That wasn’t actually accurate. Due to some shady circumstances over the last years, the Malfoy name lost a lot of his reputation. Not enough to lose his place in glory, but quite to tint some shadows around the name. Nevertheless, they were still powerful enough to be a threat.
Draco lowers his voice. “What was that?” he asked. She looked over his shoulder, but Potter was deliberately ignoring them.
They had never spoken of it.
He didn’t even have it in him to regret it.
And even if all of this was false, he closes his eyes and let himself melt in the lies.
“Good.” Potter said, before starting up the car.
“Oh! I almost forgot!”
Shit, indeed.
He shrugged.
“Are you ready to pay?”
He opens his mouth to say more, but his voice was cut by a startle cry when the man suddenly rose to his feet and pin him on the table. His back collides with the wooden table with more strength than he expected, and an undefined moan left him. Potter leans on top of him, green eyes dark, and like his dream, he was holding him by the wrist, his arms above his head, open,
They were loud, but it was strangely relaxing. Some people were talking—he could spot Ron with Neville somewhere, waving and grinning with some Hufflepuff. Hermione was chatting with Lavender, and she seems pretty excited—and some other were flirting. He could even spot a couple of Ravenclaw snogging nearby.
She sighs. “You were so cute before. Now look at you.” She was making a face, like a deceive Mother.
Harry snorted. Taking one last puff on his cigarette, he crushed his butt under his sol and putted his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket.
Taking his bag, he stormed out of his room and get down the stairs. Vaguely, he heards some noises in the kitchen. The elves were usually quiet, and he didn’t even know if his father ever put a foot in there. He himself didn’t get there very often – well, he hardy leaves his room – and most of the time, it was like no one was living in the house. Curious, he walked toward the slightly open door – he could see a shape there, moving around with agility.
And he wants Potter’s dick.
He shook himself internally, and smirked with all the slyness he could gather, leaning just enough to be face to face with him.
“Please,” he says pleasantly, “help yourself.”
Patting his pocket, he reaches for his pack of cigarettes. He was about to take one out when he feels someone standing before him.
Potter lowers his head to look at him. “Are you planning on letting me go?” he asked sarcastically, moving his locked arm to support his point.
What did they look like? He wonders, then huffs. It doesn’t like it matters either way. Most of his past bodyguards were in a relationship, but they end up fucking with him anyway.
“I remember you,” he continued with a growing euphoria, “against me. Your arms,” he places his hands on his shoulders, remembering the firm muscles with delights, and slid his fingers on his bare arms.
Maybe it was the way the socks tied his legs. This infuriating, endless legs of him, tied up in long black socks, that just reach his thighs.
The boy seemed victorious as he stepped inside. His eyes flicked around, an appreciative nod making his hair wave. Harry carefully closed the door, resting himself back. He observed as the blond take in the place, his eyes never leaving him as he paced back and forth with slight curiosity.
She grips his arm tightly. “I’m not talking about them and you know it. Are you going to ruin your life for this?”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“That’s not your business.
He squirmed lightly. Fuck. What a turn-on.
He moves back, tugging at his shirt. Malfoy raises his arms and Harry toss it aside, letting his fingers trails over the pale chest. His nipples were pink, and when his nail pass over one, Malfoy keen under him.
Harry lifted one eyebrow, amused and confused at the same time. “Okay.”
I don't know what to say, so see you next time?
Draco blushes a little, and looks suddenly vulnerable. “Really?”
Draco had enough.
Malfoy shiver. Harry spread his legs more—damn he was flexible—and lets his tongue moves along the holy hole, not breaking the flesh yet, just teasing over and over.
“Hum?” He looks his plate like he had forgotten it was there, before shrugging. “Ah, no. I’m not really that hungry.”
“We’re throwing a party after, in the room of requirement. Want to come?”
“Ow. The world is spinning really fast.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Why would I?” he smooths his skirt and looks at his nails. “It’s not like it’s the first time you decide to skip school.”
“I—” He didn’t know what to say. Thousands of moments were flying through his mind from their countless stops. The use of his name. The touching. The shirtlessness. The insistence on taking care of their meals. The time spent together, even though they weren’t required to do anything more than attend meetings and actually complete the travel portion of the assignment in each other’s presence. The unnecessary kindness. The care taken to not return to the ways of the past.
He remained rather quiet after that so they drank their tea in relative silence. Draco was idly wondering if he should try to make biscuits with the frequency of visits he’d be expecting over the coming months when Potter stood and brought his empty mug over to the wash basin.
“Draco? Is everything all right?” A pause, then in an incredulous tone, “Hey, is that my dining room table?”
that attention.
Not for the first time, Draco was incredibly grateful that she was there to help.
Swing—
“I imagine you can throw quite impressive tantrums,” Draco said quietly, trying and failing at levity.
“Kreacher is watching him, Miss Hermione,” the elf then said, giving her a narrow look.
He was working on his third row of heavy logs for the walls of the addition when a loud crack rang out followed immediately by the sound of his door banging open, a yell that he couldn’t make out over the sound of the ice pellets peppering the ground, then a screech from Vince. Then the door slammed shut and seconds later Potter stomped around the corner.
