When he got closer to the lake he saw Harry in his usual spot, back against the same tree that Draco had slept under just the other night. In his lap was none other than his diary. He was stroking its cover in slow motions while he stared out at the reflection the moon left on the lake’s waters.
“Your eyes have always been bright crystal blue. They’re grey now.” Harry looked at him then. At some point they had scooted closer to each other. Their shoulders almost touching.
“My diary- don’t you dare make fun of me this isn’t the time- my diary is missing!” Draco finally admitted.
It took the better part of his first year for Harry to construct a mask to wear so that he would fit in more. He still didn’t trust adults or the children his age, but they seemed to put him on a pedestal, and actively sought to be near him. It wasn’t until they met him for the first time that they seemed to be warded away by his lack of personality.
It was nothing that a simple scourgify charm couldn’t fix but it was still embarrassing that it happened in the first place. Everyone was glancing over their shoulders to stare at him. He could feel his face burning. Blaise had been watching him especially closely and ended up catching Draco by the wrist as they left Mcgonagall’s class.
The next night when he made to go down to the lake he found a figure already there. Of course it had to be Malfoy. It was always Malfoy. It seemed he could never stay out of his sight. Part of Harry wanted to know why, another smaller part of him found it endearing in a way. Malfoy never approached him after their first meeting on the train. Yet still he was always near. Harry had noticed his ever present gaze years ago. He never went out of his way to stop or avoid it, he even sometimes enjoyed it during moments when he was simply reading or doing some other quiet activity.
Draco felt his heart clench at how numb Harry looked. How did the world break this beautiful boy so badly?
Draco looked down at his plate, feeling his stomach tie itself in knots. Harry Potter, watching him? Of all people? He fidgeted with his robes until Blaise started speaking again.
“I have eyes everywhere, Draco dear, plus my own. It doesn’t take a genius to see you’ve both been obsessed with each other.”
Draco did his best to stay calm until lunch at least to prevent any more accidents from happening. He didn’t bother going into the great hall, not even for a quick snack. He immediately went down to the lake. Of course his book wasn’t there, he shouldn’t have been so hopeful.
After a while Draco started keeping a diary, though he reasoned with himself that it was a journal to keep his studies and findings in. A Malfoy would never keep something so girlish as a diary. He carried it with him everywhere, even to class, so that he could write his thoughts the moment they occurred. He was careful to keep it charmed so that anyone snooping would only see him writing potion notes.
Harry nodded, and Draco slowly sat up, resuming his former position. He chewed on that information for a moment before an idea struck him. The entire school was sure to be jealous if he became Potter’s first friend. And his Father would definitely be pleased upon informing him he had befriended The Boy Who Lived.
The rest of the words died in Draco’s throat when he saw the look on Harry’s face. His eyebrows were creased just the slightest bit and his lips, although drawn into a smile, were trembling slightly.
“Your pride will never recover from spilling or breaking potions or having your cauldron blow up in your face like Nevill. I doubt Professor Snape would appreciate it either.” Blaise said like stating the weather.
Moody made Harry take Blaise to the hospital wing, demanding someone else volunteer to help. In a moment of stupidity, which he would never admit to, Draco volunteered. Harry smiled at him when they made eye contact and they both slung one of Blaise’s arms over their shoulders and took him to Madam Pomfrey. Harry didn’t linger however, and as soon as Blaise was deposited on a bed he turned to leave.
Blaise was his competitor. They bowed to each other and did the necessary steps to begin a formal duel before facing each other again. While Blaise had his wand at the read, Harry tucked his away, confusing even Professor Moody. He knew Harry was up to something and it didn’t look like he was forfeiting so he let the match continue.
“Let us be friends then, I can teach you all there is to know about the wizarding world and pureblood families.” He said with the confidence that Harry had already accepted.
‘I mean we were almost cheek to cheek before, there's no way he could have been uncomfortable and hid it from me. Could there be?’ he thought anxiously to himself.
Draco looked at Blaise in astonishment. He really is a genuine friend. Unlike the other slytherin housemates he spent time with, Blaise took the time to connect with him on a personal level. Between them it went deeper that the silly pureblood formalities and stupid alliances that he was forced to make as an extension of his parents.
“You really knew nothing of the wizarding world?” Draco asked, dropping his pureblood aristocrat habits in shock and instead leaning on the edge of his seat in curiosity as he stared at Harry.
He slipped into the classroom just before the late bell and stayed near the back, knowing a certain blonde would be looking for him. He was surprised to see Draco looking positively out of it. He was shifting from one foot to the other and his hands fidgeted together with his robes. He couldn’t stay still for more than a few seconds at a time.
When Hagrid came to take him to Hogwarts his first year, he could tell how unsettled he made the giant by his lack of warmth and response. He pretended not to hear when a witch in the leaky cauldron whispered to her husband ‘what’s wrong with him’ after he refused to shake her hand. Hagrid stepped between them and said he was just shy and overwhelmed after growing up in the muggle world.
Even though Harry was surrounded by his friends and housemates, Draco noticed that he never really seemed happy. Sure he laughed and smiled plenty enough, but Draco could see that the smile never quite reached his eyes. His eyes seemed dull, and the smile always fell when Harry or his friends turned away. It puzzled Draco to no end, and studying Harry became a hobby of his. Wherever Harry was, Draco was sure to be near.
“Do you know who my Father is?” Draco demanded, “The Malfoy name alone should be recognizable enough!”
“Meet me by the Lake after dinner,” he said softly. He slipped out of the room just as Madam Pomfrey arrived, leaving Draco no time to respond or ask questions.
Draco snapped his mouth shut and stood up in a sharp movement. “I suppose not.” He sneered, turning and leaving the compartment and letting the door snap shut harshly behind him. Harry was left alone the rest of the train ride.
“What do you mean you don’t know, you’re Harry bloody Potter! Survivor of the death curse, The Boy Who Lived!”
‘What?’ Draco didn’t know what to think. He had been rejected? By Harry Potter? That can’t be, no one would dare reject such a gracious offer. And yet Potter did it in a matter of minutes. Draco was staring at his hand in disbelief, his mouth hanging slightly opened.
“I don’t know who your father is,” He answered, adding before Draco could ask, “I was raised by muggles, I didn’t even know magic existed until a day ago.”
Harry stared at him for a long moment, like he was reading something within Draco. He looked back out at the waters.
Everyone was waiting for the spell to knock Harry unconscious but the spell never made contact. Instead it seemed to bounce off of some invisible shield and back at Blaise. Blaise narrowly dodged his own spell, looking at Harry in shock who still hadn’t moved.
Unknown to him, Harry was watching Draco out of the corner of his eye. Said blonde was worrying his bottom lip between his teeth, going between giving the stone floor a death glare and looking anxious, with his eyebrows knit together.
Harry hummed softly in response and they continued on silently. Draco was nibbling on his bottom lip, deep in thought. Did Harry really tell the truth, or was he lying when he said he hadn’t read his diary. Maybe he did read it and was just being nice out of pity.
This particular class was set up like a duel and Harry was truly excited to show what he’d been working on. Professor Moody drew names for partners and set them up against each other. The duels continued as normal, most of them quite average or boring. That was until Malfoy went up. Harry subtly cast a calming and good luck charm on him as he went to one side of the room and Hermoine went to the other.
‘Pretty,’ Harry thought to himself before looking back ahead so Draco wouldn’t be suspicious of him watching.
So Harry worked on appearing warm, smiling and introducing himself kindly to others, laughing at jokes, and accepting loose friendships with his housemates. It wasn’t so bad, but he wasn’t close to any of them. None of them knew of his past beyond the fact that he was raised with muggles and that he survived the killing curse of Voldemort and was left orphaned. They didn’t know of the abuse he faced for 11 years.
“I..don’t know.” Draco admitted, leaning back against the tree, his right arm flush against Harry’s left.
Harry never was what the wizarding world or at least what Hogwarts had expected him to be. He found that out quick enough when people gave him strange looks during their interactions. After his time with the Dursleys’, he had become withdrawn and cautious of others. He didn’t trust adults and kids his age were not much better. He was used to being bullied and abused by them, and those who didn’t abuse him either didn’t believe him or turned a blind eye to it.
“Harry! You just performed wandless magic! No 14 year old in history has ever been able to do such a thing!” She all but squealed in excitement, setting off the rest of the class to circle around him and ask questions until Professor Moody yelled at them to shut up and continue with class.
By 4th year Harry too had become like a different person than when he first arrived. He was no longer skinny nor plain looking. After recovering from the years of malnourishment he had suffered, he began changing. His skin which before was pale and ashy had now become richer in color and a few shades darker. More of an olive tone.
Draco made it to the transfiguration classroom with several minutes to spare before the designated late bell. The class was uneventful for the most part, especially since Harry was still absent. Draco prayed to Merlin that the day would go by fast so he could go search for his diary during lunch. He cursed to himself when he couldn’t help bouncing his knee and his hands became more shaky. He ended up spilling his inkwell twice!
“All I am is what other people have made me to be, what they want me to be! There is not a single facet of myself that is just..me! I like what people think I should like, I want what they think I should want!”
Even more surprising was that Draco didn’t even notice his presence, and he wasn’t looking for him either. Harry could feel the weight of his diary in his bag, humming to himself. That must be what was agitating him so much he mused silently as class began.
He didn’t let himself think about his following actions as he reached out a hand to cup Harry’s cheek, brushing away those beautiful tears. Harry was looking at him in what Draco could only assume was shock. Green eyes searched grey, desperate for answers. Draco didn’t know if he had any to give.
The most he spoke to them was during meals in the great hall and after hours in the common room when he couldn’t hide away in the library.
“Yes love, both of you. For as much as you stare at him, he watches you plenty enough.” he said with a sigh.
His housemates and the rest of the student body for that matter just thought of him as a quiet and studious boy. Even with the mask Harry had carefully crafted, students still admitted to him that they thought he’d be more bold and extroverted. More like the average boy he supposed. He kept to himself for the most part, always choosing to study when his ‘friends’ went out.
“Anyways, I’ll keep it a secret so long as you keep secret my...attachment toward another lion.” Blaise whispered to him.
His mind told him to jump up and immediately run down to the lake but his ingrained pureblood sensibilities left him sitting calmly in place. The great hall was full of students now, everyone would stare at him if he acted so idiotically. Their first class was going to start soon as well so even if he got up calmly now he wouldn’t have enough time to go to the lake and come back without being late. And no one ever wants to be late to a class with Professor Mcgonagall. He’d have to wait until lunch to go looking.
Draco held his breath, watching Harry’s expression for any sign of disdain or discomfort. Finally Harry said,
Harry felt his lips twitch up in a small smile as Draco returned to his spot with the rest of the class. He knew Draco himself was probably surprised he hadn’t messed up if his day had gone anything like Harry suspected it had. Harry moved forward to the cleared center of the room when he heard his name called. Immediately he felt Draco’s eyes on him. His lips twitched up further.
“I’ve stopped making decisions for myself, I’ve stopped thinking for myself. I feel like I'm floating outside of my body and I don’t even recognize myself anymore!” He was almost yelling now, his voice hoarse from holding back emotion.
Harry decided to turn back and wait near the castle for Draco to leave. It seemed Draco had fallen asleep when he didn’t move for some time until a bell, ringing from the castle, startled him awake, signaling that it was now curfew and all lingering students were to return to their commonrooms. Harry stayed in place, hidden in the shadows and Malfoy ran past, hurrying back to the dungeons. After a long while to make sure the coast was clear, Harry made his way down to his spot by the lake. There, laying next to the tree’s roots, was a beautiful leather bound book.
“Nothing important.” he said, glancing at Harry from the corner of his eye. Harry smiled at him softly, giving his hand a little squeeze as they turned a corner.
If there was one thing Draco Malfoy would never admit to, it would be his stupid crush on that prat of a boy Potter. Scratch that, prat of a man. Harry was no boy, even Draco could see that. He had stopped being a boy a long time ago. Perhaps that's what had attracted Draco to him, his strange maturity that was beyond his years.
Any thought Draco had of Harry lying was long gone, his smile was far too sincere and hand too warm for Draco to think otherwise. Draco didn’t want to let go when they finally reached the portrait door to the slytherin common room. He clutched his diary close to his chest.
‘Is this how Harry feels, I wonder’ Draco scrawled out in his diary. His once neat and beautiful calligraphy was now shaky and lacked the flourish it used to have. Stupid cruciatus curse, Draco thought while scowling at his hand writing.
Harry had tilted his head back to rest against the stone of the window seal. The light coming through the window made it look like little crystals were stuck to Harry’s cheek. Was he crying? Draco watched him in wonder.
To everyone else he was the perfect boy, smart and studious but also participated in activities with his friends. Even the teachers saw nothing out of the ordinary with him. He was the perfect role model of what a student should be. But it wasn’t the real him, and Harry knew that deep down no matter how much he tried to delude himself.
“I don’t know..Maybe it was for myself..” Harry said softly. He hadn’t made a move to get out of Draco’s hold and frankly, Draco didn’t want to let go.
It wasn’t until Harry was called up by the sorting hat that the rest of the school became aware of him. There was rumor he was there of course, but no one had suspected that such a scrawny and plain boy was the one of legend. The gryffindors were ecstatic to say the least when he was sorted and made his way to their table. Their excitement became more unsettled though when they were met with his lack of emotions and faraway look he gave them.
‘Dear Merlin, today is going to be awful’ Draco thought to himself as he got up and made his way to the transfiguration classroom.
“Clearly not.” he said flatly, letting Draco go only because the boy looked like he’d pull his wrist out of socket if he didn’t.
“Harry, I don’t think you're as far gone as you think you are. After all, you made the decision not to read my diary, you made the decision to ask me to meet you here. Those were for yourself weren't they?”
“Invisible? Harry that’s preposterous, no wizard has been able to become completely invisible and undetectable without an invisibility cloak and even then it’s not perfect.”
He shuffled through his bag searching. His eyebrows creased in confusion when his diary was nowhere to be found. He stared at his plate in deep thought, trying to remember where he had last left his precious possession. Yesterday it had been with him the whole time, through class, to the library, even dinner, and then- The Lake!
Harry blinked, then nodded at him. The boy wasted no time in stepping into the compartment, shutting the door behind him and taking a seat across from Harry. Harry watched silently all the while.
“After rejecting your friendship and almost never speaking to you for 4 years? Beats me.” Blaise drawled.
Those same beautiful, crystal tears from the day before. ‘Was this what made you cry?’ Draco thought.
Draco was in shock. Never in a million years would he have imagined that Harry Potter would be spilling his emotions out to him. Hell he didn’t even think the boy would speak to him. And yet here he was, watching Draco with tears now dripping down his face.
I didn’t keep you on tenterhooks for much longer though. I straddled your hips, kissing your soft lips and working my way down your torso. By the time I closed my lips around your glans, though, I felt your hands pushing against my shoulders, and only then did I notice the way you were panting. “Darling, if you… I’ll come straight away.”
Half of the Great Hall held its collective breath, which made me bite back my grin. I reckon half of them thought they ought to get under the benches lest hexes start to fly. I don’t want to be presumptuous, but I do hope they’ll all have to get used to more than us calling each other by our forenames.
I love that you look after me, Draco, and that you’ve made it alright not to have to be in control all of the time. Your care is like a warm jumper, supporting me and hiding me from the cold; you envelop me. Even when your actions are as simple as buttering my toast, or re-knotting my tie, I’m still infused with wonder. I can’t believe that somebody like you exists, and that you love me. So never change. You were the change in my life that’s made me fulfilled, the change that I didn’t even know that I needed.
Alright, I’ve got to go. They’re coming back. I can hear footsteps in the corridor outside. Don’t reply yet. I’ll tell you what they’ve said as soon as I know.
Thanks for this wonderful letter. I shall come back to your words immediately but let me share my visit to Whitby Abbey as long as my memories are fresh and the ethereal feeling of visiting such an ancient ruin hasn’t left my system yet.
Bloody hell, I hope I’m not putting you off. I know I can come across as fearlessly opinionated when it comes to things like pudding and Quidditch, but I can’t help it. I’m a passionate person as Nev used to say (half-jokingly? I hope so. I share dorms with him) and I fear that I come across as a bit loudmouthed. Quite bluntly, you had to be a bit noisy to actually get heard in our common room when we were younger.
“You don’t know your verdict by heart? You must be joking. You know these kinds of things, Draco. What does it say?”
I wanted to join the Auror Training Corps, straight out of school. Remember when we first began writing, and I wouldn’t tell you what my future plans were? How much has changed. I had big dreams of running into crime scenes, wrestling Dark Wizards to the floor with a swift, ingenious spell. Then I’d secure the villain with charmed restraints while my colleagues all looked on admiringly. It was all such nonsense, love. A childish fantasy.
I hadn’t realised that you were on the run. And under such dreadful conditions at that. I’ve heard that many Muggleborns and mixed-bloods either fled the country or went off into the wild, away from wizarding communities. Is that the time you were referring to when you said that you and your friends had each other’s backs? How many were with you?
I just read your words, and they had me a tad worried. You didn’t happen to look onto this nifty map of yours tonight, did you? Because if you did and you saw me in Theo’s bed, then I surely hope that you have faith in my fidelity, and that your wistfulness has nothing to do with that. Because I swear to all the deities above and below that I’d never ever even think of someone else. Sod the deities, I’ll make an Unbreakable Vow on that if you like.
Also, I feel honoured that I kind of had my part in that. It almost feels like we’re real friends, know what I mean? My words helped you come to a decision in the real world – yes, fine, Shakespeare did. Just wanted you to know that I think a lot about your words too. I’m just perfecting my skills in not doing anything whatsoever, which may be why your words don’t have much impact outside of my own mind.
“You are loved,” you answered, “and I know this isn’t our home, isn’t Grimmauld Place, perhaps, but for just a short while, we could pretend?”
Bloody hell. This is bringing up a lot of dark feelings, but that’s good. That’s positive. I need you to know all of this.
This is fanciful, but as soon as I arrived it was as if a great wash of calm streamed through my whole body. The stones themselves seemed to pulse with ancient magic, just as you experienced at the Colosseum, and I felt my skin quiver and hum along with it. The assembled wixen had already begun singing an incantation, and a young witch of maybe eight or nine years old welcomed me into the circle. She took my hand into hers without hesitation.
“Last but not least,” Ron said, rotating to face the pair of us, “the blond bombshell himself, Mr Draco Malfoy Esquire.” I felt your shoulders stiffen in my arms, apprehensive, I suppose about the next words that Ron would say. “Circe, but I used to think you were a right poncy git,” Ron began, “and most of me still does. Nobody deserves to look that good in a school-bloody-uniform… It pissed me off, the way that you used to lord it around Hogwarts, like money was shorthand to power.” Ron paused, talking the Firewhisky from Nev and taking a swig, “and then, when your family lost everything, it felt like justice. It felt like just desserts. I wanted you to slum it with the rest of us… But then you and Harry got together… Found each other, and I realised I couldn’t hold onto my anger anymore. Even though I wanted to. The thing is,
My love. I know I ought to be sleeping, and that my potions test tomorrow will suffer for my lack of rest, but the habit of writing to you before pulling the covers over myself is simply too ingrained now. It’ll be different next year, when there won’t be limits on our time together.
, are better kept until after one has made vows and a formal commitment. In my day, a young witch or wizard would spend their days practicing the art of moderate conversation with their matched partner.
And when I finally started telling you how unreal that all felt, you listened very patiently. I felt like an idiot for saying things like “I don’t deserve that,” and “We should just drop the whole case, adjust to the restrictions as they are now.”
wankers might be idiots, peddling bollocks, but they’ve been sending owls, Harry! To me and Hermione. To George at the Wheezes and even to bloody Perce!” He shook his head. “They’ve been offering Galleons right, left and centre. You pair are the biggest story since the end of the war and those tossers are willing to pay for every angle. That kiss at the award ceremony? It really pissed a lot of people off, Harry.”
I am almost glad that we waited another day, for it was quite misty this morning. We were spared from rain, but the grey weather and the fog that lay across the streets like a thick veil made for a rather fitting atmosphere. We took the famous 199 steps and long before the Abbey came into view, we passed a graveyard attached to a church. And the gravestones looked so old, some of them porous and mouldy, others furnished with copper plates, long tinged with green patina, that I think it perfectly understandable that this Muggle bloke chose this particular area as the setting for a horror novel.
Circe, but my heart skips a beat every time you mention having children of our own. I cannot believe that this is a possible, palpable future for us, darling. Only a few months ago- I won’t bother writing it down. But how things change. And they do change for the better for once. So, so much better than I have ever dared to hope for.
Before I do though, I wanted to say bravo. You obviously know me far too well. I didn’t get my Outstanding in Care of Magical Creatures or Herbology, but I did get Exceeds Expectations in both of those subjects. It was a proud day for me. Face it. Your boyfriend is a plant loving sap with a soft spot for cuddly, furry creatures.
“Yeah,” I said, wanting to be honest. “I mean, it always sounded good fun. But I reckon, after the war? The thought of chucking hexes about and having to defend myself? It isn’t who I am, not anymore.” I started to make my way back towards the table. “And since I got together with Draco? We’ve talked about careers, and how we want to spend our lives and me being an Auror just doesn’t feature in that picture. Right now, we’re just focusing on finishing Hogwarts, and then we’re going to think about jobs a bit further down the line.”
Please don’t worry, my love. I’ve had so many detentions during my Hogwarts career that they’ve pretty much blurred into one. I’ve washed potion vials for Snape (disgusting), packed envelopes full of autographs for Lockhart (boring), and even explored the Forbidden Forest on one memorable occasion with a certain very young, very bossy young blond boy beside me. Never once before, however, have I actually been given detention for breaking intimacy rules and I’m actually rather proud of the fact.
BUT. (And I spare you the talk on the exact latitude we were at.) Compared to Britain you can see about 15° more of the night sky there. To be exact, you can see objects down to 53° declination. So it’s not only great to see the Milky Way a little brighter, but you can see a whole new set of stars!
For Harry there was simply no other choice for his plus-one at the Order of Merlin ceremony when he was presented with his medal. “There wasn’t another person in the world that I wanted beside me,” Harry stated, looking very much like a man entirely in love. “Draco has made me truly content for the first time since the war. Draco’s brought joy into my life.”
“Yes, it was very cute. We were citing sonnets to each other,” I told her, slicing an apple and pressing my leg against yours under the table. You cast a side-glance my way. I hope you thought about the steamy contents we had shared that night as well. If I recall correctly, the conversation did involve that Barnfield poem at some point, didn’t it?
“Tulips.” After a moment of silence, you chuckled. I’m sure you saw my stifled smirk too, for you came closer and wrapped your arms around me, pressing kisses to the nape of my neck. “What are you even on about? Their different glass types for champagne?”
Getting him over the edge was somewhat more work than I had anticipated at first and my lips started to burn a little and my damn knees hurt from the stone floor. So I jerked him through it while I licked his head instead.
As a consequence of the trials after the War, I’m under quite similar restrictions like you mentioned only a few days ago when we were talking about Draco Malfoy. Someone in my family engaged in Death Eater activity during the war. I told you that I couldn’t travel – that’s because I’m not allowed to leave the country at the moment. I’m broke because my family paid so many fees that they don’t exactly can afford to send me pocket money like they used to, and our Gringotts accounts are frozen. Please don’t judge me. I know you must be Muggleborn or a half-blood, but I needed to tell you this about me. I’m not some kind of pure-blood superiority bigot. Not anymore, at least. I used to have horrible opinions about Muggleborns. But I swear that’s not the case anymore, not ever since the War had started and I witnessed what these beliefs really implied. Sorry for my scrawl, I hope you can read this.
This morning I rose before all of the other snoring, exhausted boys and I showered early. I woke with the first light racing through the crack in the curtains, and after that I was too keyed up to contemplate staying in my bed.
“During the class party I was saved by the return of my classmate. Three days later I wasn’t so lucky. As soon as we were alone in the Castle I hadn’t a chance. Malfoy was all honeyed words, big grey eyes, and he had my trousers open before I could take a single, solitary breath. It was immediately obvious that Malfoy was well versed in the so-called ‘French’ art of love. I was an ungainly, unworldly innocent; Malfoy was an experienced ingénue.”
My fellow Gryffindors broke their kiss with a sheepish smile. Oh, Draco. Didn’t they look happy? The two of them looked utterly besotted, and every bit like a real couple already. They linked their hands and sat down beside each other. They looked
My hands lingered on the jut of your pelvis and along the curves of your arse. I stroked your shoulder blades and down across your clavicle, awestruck that I could call you my fiancé and that I was lucky enough to wear your ring.
Well, I say ‘interview’ but that wasn’t like any interview I’ve ever had to endure - and I’ve sat thought a fair number of them, those horrible lime green Quick-Quotes Quill filling the pages with fibs and hyperbole – and I’m going to hazard a guess that it wasn’t much like any interview you’ve had either.
He fidgeted anxiously, overthinking about all the things that could have happened to his precious book. Did it rain last night? Surely not, but even the morning dew would soak the book to its spine and destroy all his writings. Did someone find it? If they did they would see his name on the first page and nothing but boring potion notes so they were sure to return it to him. Unless they threw it away.
Draco clenched his jaw tightly. He didn’t tell Blaise about his training with his father or how frequently he was under the cruciatus curse. Blaise just somehow figured it out himself and confronted him about it. At the moment Draco couldn’t even think about lying, it was still too fresh a memory and Blaise already knew it was the truth. It was the first time anyone but his parents had seen him cry.
Blaise nodded with a solemn face. “I’ll help you search during lunch and after dinner if you still haven’t found it. If that be the case I recommend you skip potions.”
Ever since Harry had rejected his hand of friendship in first year, Draco had developed an obsession with him. Probably because he always coveted the things he was denied more. So he took to watching him throughout the years. Draco didn’t like what he saw most of the time.
“Tell me, I can help. I’ve never seen you this agitated before and you haven’t knocked any inkwells over or been this bouncy since…”
Harry stared at Draco’s outstretched hand, long enough that his arm was beginning to hurt and the situation became awkward. Harry’s eyes then moved to Draco’s own and he stared for a moment longer, his expression showing deep thought. Then he turned his head to look back through the window.
“I will admit that I broke your protection charm on it, but it was very weak. I can teach you a stronger one if you’d like.” He offered.
When Draco didn’t respond he added, “I opened it to the first page and saw that it belonged to you. I should have known just from the cover really, you’re never without it” he chuckled a little.
Draco climbed the stairs up to the third floor where the library resided. He slipped inside the grand archway doors and started going through the aisles. He knew the library was the place Harry frequented most and he could almost always be found curled up in some corner of the place with a book in hand. As became a habit of watching Harry, so too did reading the same books Harry read.
Draco let out a shaky breath. It was like his eyes had bewitched him, he couldn't look away. He waited a few minutes, trying to work up the nerve to follow after him. It took Blaise squeezing his shoulder and wishing him luck to finally stand and excuse himself. He took his time wandering the long stoney passages leading to rolling hills of the grounds.
Unbeknownst to Draco, Harry had missed all of his classes so far. Even though he knew that the teachers would believe his excuse of stomach bug more if he missed the whole day, he just couldn’t keep himself away from DADA. It was the one class where he felt more like his true self.
Must belong to Malfoy, Harry thought, picking the book up and running a hand over its smooth cover. He could feel the tingle of a protection charm over it. Probably to keep unwanted readers from seeing what was truly written, his mind supplied. With a pulse of pure magic he felt the protection charm break and vanish. Harry had no idea that his entire impression of Malfoy would change that night. Without a second thought, he opened the book.
Upon getting on the train to Hogwarts he found himself a quiet and empty compartment, curling up in the seat and staring out of the window. Word passed through the train that Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was there. Not long after people began seeking him out. Nobody thought that the lone boy, staring out of the window was The Boy Who Lived. They passed his compartment by after a single glance.
Draco wrote all this down in his diary and more until Harry eventually wiped his face clean and left. He sat back in his chair for a moment, thinking about those beautiful crystal tears before finally getting up and making his way down to the great hall for dinner.
Harry stood up, still holding onto Draco’s hand. It felt warm in his own hand and he held it a little tighter on instinct.  Draco let Harry lead him back inside the castle, staying close to his side.
“We both have our secrets. I’d rather learn yours because you want me to know, not because I found your diary.”
His gaze turned to the Gryffindor table, scanning for a certain raven haired boy. As if Blaise had jinxed him, Draco’s eyes caught Harry’s from across the room. Harry didn’t look away. Green stared into grey for a long time before Harry finally moved, turning to his friend and saying something before getting up and leaving the great hall.
Blaise waved his wand, shouting out ‘Stupefy!’ and a red spark of light came toward Harry. Draco held his breath. What was that ponce thinking! He wasn’t going to dodge or defend himself?
“Going for a stroll.” Was Draco’s short reply before closing the portrait door behind himself. Blaise merely rolled his eyes and went back to his book, knowing full well Draco was off to search for Potter.
When he came back to school 4th year, after the torture that was his father’s ‘training’, he was a different person. He was quieter than before, and his housemates noticed that he no longer partook in bullying or bragging or calling his father’s name. Draco seemed to do nothing more than study for his classes and watch everyone else with cold, calculating eyes.
Harry turned to look at a boy his age. He was fair skinned, looking almost albino in his black school robes. His hair wasn’t much darker, a platinum blonde that was meticulously styled. He had bright, crystal blue eyes and a sharp, thin looking face.
All at once Draco felt the soft hum of Harry’s magic leave and in that same instant Harry himself vanished. Draco felt himself suck in a small breath as he stared at the empty hall in front of him. He let out that same breath and turned, whispering the password to the portrait door and slipping inside.
That didn’t seem right though, it would have felt different. As much as Harry seemed to struggle showing emotions, Draco could tell when other people made him uncomfortable. He didn’t seem uncomfortable at all the whole night.
No one knew that Harry had been mastering different magics not taught in the school curriculum. It was only a rare occasion when people saw him doing the school work he was actually assigned. He usually completed those assignments a day or two after they were given out, even if they weren’t due for months. The rest of the time he was studying all other kinds of magic that interested him. He even found a secret room on the 7th floor to practice his magic in.
want to think about his most annoying coworker on a night where he was supposed to be having fun. The man smiled, and Harry eased into one of the two leather chairs.
“A good amber whiskey,” Harry argued, “is better than any warming charm. Spiked Butterbeer with Ogdens original? Can’t beat it.”
not falling in love, though. Harry still woke up at five on the weekdays, his body aching. He still showered and prepped and drank his morning tea black. He still rolled his eyes at Malfoy when he walked into the Auror office late. He still struggled to ignore the blond git’s commentary on his bad taste and his disastrous hair. He still ground his teeth when he was forced to run jobs with the arsehole. He still had to control his breathing whenever Malfoy got too close, he still groaned when Malfoy did something annoyingly smart. And when he licked his lips and glared at Harry with fiery grey eyes, Harry ignored it. And when he brought him afternoon tea with a splash of milk and two sugars, well, that was just coincidence, wasn’t it? And when he laughed--actually laughed-- at Harry’s jabs, and Harry’s heart tugged in a completely unwarranted way, well, maybe they were just getting used to each other. Of course. That was it. Harry wasn’t pent up anymore, and now he could occasionally get along with his git of a partner. All was well.
“Be patient,” Harry growled, and Drake stilled but continued to whine. Harry dragged him up by the ropes, until Drake was sitting back on his knees. There was a trail of precum that travelled from Drake’s cock to the pool on the table, and Harry wanted to taste it, so he did. As soon as his lips touched the head, Drake was arching up into his mouth, moaning wantonly. Harry didn’t move, he just let Drake fuck weakly into his mouth until he was gasping again, and Harry grasped the base of the man’s cock roughly, cutting off the imminent orgasm. Drake sobbed at the stimulation and struggled in his bonds even more aggressively than before.
Beneath the headline was a small picture of Ron, Harry and Hermione, hugging after Harry and Ron completed their Auror training. Harry dropped his teacup.
“Harry,” he countered, one foot in the cool green flames. Harry didn’t say anything for a few long seconds, and then he reached out a hand. Draco looked at it, frowned, swallowed, then slowly took it, solid and warm. Harry squeezed, shook it once.
“People are leaving,” Draco said, backlit by the orange glow of the party. He was wearing shiny silver chainmail, a sword on his hip. His hair was slicked back and tied at the nape of his neck, and he looked all at once exactly like his father and yet entirely different. The charms on Harry’s own hair had faded, leaving it more black than pink, and his vision was beginning to blur around the edges, as if he were looking through a fogged glass.
“You don’t know anything about me Malfoy,” Harry barked. “And it wasn’t a breakup, it was the end of a contract. Suck my dick, arsehole.” But Malfoy was smiling--no--laughing.
“Please do,” Drake arched his back, and Harry stripped himself of his jeans. His head was a rush of adrenaline and arousal.
Harry only panicked for a second, but it was long enough to throw him even further off guard when a tall, lithe blond waltzed through the swinging doors that lead from the storage rooms of the establishment.
“Right. What gives?” Harry asked, and Hermione’s eyes were glittering. She only shrugged. Harry struggled for two seconds more before he saw it. A piece of paper was tacked onto the bottom of the second page, camouflaged into the curling scripts and photos.
“Ah, a party for Hallow’s Eve. ‘Was going to mention, but…” Ron glanced back and forth between Harry and Draco.
“A bit belated, that. But I accept.” Draco sounded like he was smiling. Harry couldn’t look. Ron laughed again, bright and hopeful.
“Starkly so, looks like a ghost when he’s not screaming like one,” Draco had smiled, happy to divulge, a fondness in his eyes that Harry tried not to be jealous of.
“Oh Harry, I would never!” She looked concerned, and Harry glared at her. She caved, dropping her act. “Well, alright, if you insist. I told you so.”
“Shove off, I don’t even look like me,” Harry replied, pulling his eyes from the strange figure in the mirror.
“Oh, of course. I’ll see you Monday. Thank you for the tea.” Draco smiled again, warmer than sunshine, and Harry felt his face flush. Before he could think twice about it, Harry stepped around the corner of the counter and bent to kiss the soft downy hair on Scorpius’ head. When he came up, Draco’s eyes were only inches away, his breath ghosting over Harry’s face. Harry blinked, glanced down at Draco’s parted lips, wet from the tea and rosy with the summer heat. He stepped away carefully, and mumbled a quick,
“You’re joking.” Both his friends were watching him now, Hermione with tears spilling down her face. The bacon was burning. “This isn’t funny.”
“No. Not particularly thirsty tonight,” he assured, letting his tone slip into a viciousness that he coveted for special occasions.
Harry shed his own shirt and kneeled on the ground next to Drake, dragging his fingertips over the mountains and valleys of his body, feeling out the hard planes of muscle. When Harry looked up again, Drake’s eyes were hooded and his mouth hung open slightly, taking in short frantic breaths.
He fought with Malfoy that week, exchanging a stinging hex and words that cut brutally into his psyche. He was so harsh that he almost regretted it when Malfoy’s eyes went wide and he worried his bottom lip between his teeth, just like…
“Wouldn’t be too sure. Our inside bloke will recognize you in a heartbeat,” Ron sniffed, then pulled his wand out from underneath his red Auror robes.
“Yes, well,” Harry sniggered, “we wanted a good send-off for Auror Malfoy here, seeing as he’ll be leaving us for a stint, and, well… It was Ron’s idea, really.” Harry brushed his hand through his hair and knocked his hip into Draco, making him stumble into Ron. “Are we in trouble?”
“Lovely night,” Draco said, his hands cupped around his drink, steam curing up and around his face. His tears had dried, leaving only a telling gloss over his eyes and a shadow of a frown.
Harry woke up angry and starved. The smell of bacon floated down the hallway to him, and he allowed it to rouse him from his morning grogginess. The sounds of Hermione laughing and Ron singing dragged him further down the hallway, and he was monumentally pleased to not find a blond slytherin sitting in his chair, as he had been last night.
It was easier to get a reaction out of Malfoy when Harry was focused on making him smile. Draco still came to work too early, but for the first time Harry noticed the breaks he took to go home, the amount he checked the clock before five, the owls he received every hour.
Rose Weasley was the sweetest child Harry had ever held. She was insanely small, startlingly inconsequential and yet so full of love and light, only two days old and already spreading endless joy. She had barely been set down since she was born, doted on by her parents and their friends. Molly had cried with Harry in the hallway two days before, weeping over each other and staining the sleeves of their jumpers with tears.
“Harry? Mate, Draco asked you if you’re staying here tonight.” Ron nudged Harry’s hand. The dark mahogany clock in the entryway dinged ten times, and Harry shrugged.
“Methinks he doth protest too much,” Ron snickered, and Harry was immensely grateful for the backup. Harry almost missed the flush that crept across Malfoy's face. Almost.
“I’ll have a Vodka-” Harry started, but then he was cut off, and he was dead. He was so, so dead. Harry braced for the impact, his wand clutched tightly and his prayers halfway sent… but nothing happened. No green light, no blanket of death. Instead, Jason Duchene leaned over the counter next to Harry, so close he could feel the sickly warmth of his body, close enough to smell his acrid cologne, and pulled Draco Malfoy into a bruising kiss.
“You’re pretty,” Harry said, blushing despite the fact he had already held this man’s ass in his hands and mapped his neck with his tongue. Drake moaned. Harry smiled.
“Do you want to know?” Hermione was a mad genius, but she was a shoddy actress. She sounded much too disinterested to be genuine.
When Draco Malfoy stopped by, Harry couldn’t bring himself to get angry, too overwhelmed and drained to muster up any foul feelings or bitter words. He watched as Draco hugged Ron, a hand clasped to his cheek, words whispered between them. Draco had brought a gift, wrapped in silver wrapping paper and shining brightly in his hand.
“No, no no no, Harry you absolute obnoxious idiot, don’t cry,” Malfoy said, wrapping his arms around Harry and running a hand down his back in a perfect recreation of Drake’s soothing motions. Harry wanted to rip Malfoy’s throat “Harry, you fool, look at me,” Malfoy tore Harry’s hands away from his eyes. “Harry. What’s my name?”
“So what does he have to do then? Save the world for you, repay his life debt?” There was color high on Ron’s cheeks, and that annoyed Harry even more. His best friend cared more about a Hogwarts bully coming to Christmas than he did Harry’s feelings. Figures.
Harry snorted, and Draco’s eyes didn’t hold a single spec of recognition when they turned to him. “Excuse me,” he whispered to the smuggler, then, “What would you like, Sir.”
Harry left a few bobbles out the next time Drake came around. A copy of the Quibbler on the coffee table, a remembrall on his bookshelf, his broom next to the coat rack. If Drake noticed, he didn’t say anything, but he did seem rather introspective as Harry slowly dragged him apart piece by piece. His orgasm was quiet and thoughtful, and he stared into Harry’s eyes as though he was searching for something. And then he was gone, and Harry was alone again.
They also talked about the joys life held. Draco told Harry that he always looked forward to Saturday, when he could hear the church bells from down the street chime every hour. He told him that he hadn’t cried when Astoria passed, he’d just held Scorpius for hours, held him and held him, seeing her eyes and her smile in his little face. Harry told Draco about his favorite pair of socks, the ones that made him smile every time he put them on, though they weren’t particularly special. Harry talked about his patronus, about how it changed after the war, about how he used Ron and Hermione’s wedding as his happiest memory because it had been rainy and warm, a haze of messiness and perfection.
“Sure, of course. And sending me into a pit of vipers without telling me who I’ll be working with is still, to this very moment, the most brilliant idea you lot have ever had.” Harry rolled his eyes and took in the disheveled appearance of their office as he closed the door behind him. It was still covered in the files from the last case they had, and they had barely gotten enough time to breathe before they were thrown into the thick of the illicit potions trade-- a case they had been slowly investigating for just over a year. Tonight, hopefully, would be the end to a wild goose chase, and the beginning of some well-deserved time off.
It was Harry’s turn to find Draco, the next time. He was sitting in the kitchen, changed into his house robes, palms pressed to his eyes, plates and food covering the island and the countertops. His chest shuddered with deep, uneven breaths, and Harry was all-too familiar with the pose.
Harry took a deep breath, looked into Drake’s eyes, and let it go. “I don’t want to pay for this anymore,” he said.
“Please,” he whined, his voice broken and strange in his own ears. He felt like he was ten feet above himself, his eyes shut tight against the sensations that threatened to overwhelm him. His fingers buzzed, and he dragged them through the head of hair on his chest. The hair was unusually soft, but it felt nice, perfect even. Draco was dragging his tongue over Harry’s chest, and though Harry’s breathing felt light and even, it skipped every time Draco brushed his tongue against his sensitive nipples. After what seemed like hours, Harry felt a finger press against him, and he was pulled back under the ocean of sensations. He didn’t register the stretching, or Draco’s preparations, but he did feel it when the man over him slid into him, brushing his prostate and making him hiss deliciously. “Pleasepleaseplease,” he muttered to himself, and he cried out when Draco rocked into him. It felt better than magic, better than butterbeer on a rainy day, better than anything. And when Draco leaned down and kissed Harry’s neck in just the right spot Harry’s whole body tensed.
Duchene up for a long, long time, and when he came back down to the ground floor, Duchene was thoroughly stunned, Ron was checking and double-checking all the potions Cho had gathered from the storage, and Draco Malfoy was staring at him with his own molten silver eyes.
“Why did you go to a sex dungeon?” Draco retaliated, and Harry saw his point. “We still need to do our jobs, Harry,” Draco smiled, running a hand along Harry’s jaw.
“I’m quitting the Aurors, Harry.” Draco shrugged, and his hands found Harry’s sweater, tugged the hem of it.
They talked about being queer, vaguely. Harry mentioned Ginny with all the grace he could, and Draco talked about Astoria as if she were an angel, his best friend and his closest confidant. They talked about work, about how Draco had found something in himself that could see a problem and find a solution.Draco told him that his wand holster had become a second skin, and he showed the inscription on the inside,
“Gentlemen,” he said, “would anyone care to tell me why we had to use a full Auror task force for a mild arrest?”
Harry had said, breathing in the magic and letting it lure him into fanciful nostalgia, back to a time where he felt found, seen.
“Hey, I don’t make the rules, just play by ‘em.” Ron shrugged, pulling Harry into a side-along as he spoke. The sudden apparition barely impacted the conversation, and Harry continued to grouse as they landed.
“No, listen. I heard you and Robards talking about it. I’ll tell him you need to stay, I’ll tell him we need you on still. You have to stay. You
Harry held out a biscuit, then pulled it back right before Teddy took it. “It’s like licorice, so you might not like it.” Teddy nodded sagely and sniffed it cautiously before he took a tiny bite with his one front tooth.
“Oh. I’ll think about it. Thanks Malfoy.” Harry dove back into his papers again, reciting the ingredients to pepper-up in his head and counting his teeth with his tongue to distract himself. He barely heard Ron over the racket in his brain, quietly asking,
“Me? Why?” Harry looked up at Draco, and he saw familiar fiery grey eyes, and life stilled to a grinding halt.
He managed to do this every year, to lock himself away and hide from the truth of it, the bitter taste of loneliness. He’d send a bottle of sherry to Petunia, his only acknowledgement of the family they had shared and lost. Otherwise he would sit at home and stew. For a few years he would let Hermione drag him out somewhere; to Bath, to downtown, to the park, to her home where she would dress up in a witch costume and charm paper stars to float in the air. But it turned sad, after a while, as he would sit and watch his friends laugh together. It was not that they were unfamiliar with loss, or pain, but it was different to grow up out of place, to never have a home he was safe in.
Hermione and Ron found him before they left, kissing him on the cheek, glancing around at the flowers and decorations.
“Oh, just lovely, thanks,” he responded sarcastically, but she didn’t flinch. They were seated at the kitchen table in the Granger-Weasley home in Sedgefield, a sweet muggle town in northern England. Ron and Draco were standing in the foyer, drinking fancy cocktails and sharing tales of their penpal-ship from the last four months. Four months where Ron was writing bloody love letters to Malfoy while Harry investigated a man they had practically already captured. The world was a cruel place.
They laughed together, leaving the pub early in the night, Draco claiming that he was a horrid father, Harry shoving him, denying it and smiling. Draco went home to his family. Harry went home to his empty rooms, his creaky floorboards.
“You’re Hal, right?” Drake said, looking to a paper that rested beside him. “You noted that you’re into bondage, breathplay, impact play and denial, but you didn’t write if you’re a Dom or Sub. I can do either, what would you prefer?”
“Okay, well. Thanks.” Harry pressed another kiss to Drake’s forehead and left the room as soon as he was sure he didn’t forget anything. He was all cut up inside.
“Harry dear, come in, come in!” Andy puttered about, putting the kettle on and sliding a tray of biscuits across the table. Malfoy didn’t look at him.
“Oh, trust Merlin, you will,” Ron laughed, then quieted as Harry glared. “Just say the code to the bartender, then you two will pounce when the time is right.”
“No, don’t play dumb.” Harry seethed. “I love you, I think. And I know this is stupid, and you don’t really know me, but I can’t pay you for this anymore.”
“Me? Are you me? I like your hair!” Teddy jumped up and down, his own hair flashing pink, then back to green. Teddy dragged him through every room, pointing out the costumes and describing what they were supposed to be. “Aunty Luna is a star, see! And Hermie is a queen, did you see her crown? And Uncle Ron is a pod, and Rosie is a pea with Scorbus. Draco is a knight, and Grams said she was an angel, but she’s not wearing a costume.”
“Right then, Mr. McDougall, you’re under arrest for smuggling magical creatures whilst on court-ordered probation. Auror Potter, feel free,” Draco said, and he waved his hand with vague nonchalance, still pouring Harry’s drink. Four Aurors were already apprehending the smuggler, stunning spells on the tips of their wands.
“Well that’s bollocks, has he even met you?” Malfoy was standing behind the couch, swirling a dark liquor and scowling at the papers in his hand. “You killed a mass murderer at seventeen, and he thinks you can’t handle a board meeting. Typical.” He had come over to retrieve some files on the Doxy wars for a recent case, but somewhere along the way Hermione and Ron had stumbled in, and then dinner was served, and so Malfoy was stuck in Grimmauld for the evening, fraying Harry’s nerves and chatting up his friends.
Harry went to the party, pulling on an old shirt and muddying the knees of his pants to go as himself, then thinking better of it and changing, dragging in his nicest robes. After staring in the mirror for a few long minutes, he decided to use some sight potions and leave his glasses on the counter, charming his hair bright pink and squinting through the headache that was already forming. He would go as Teddy.
“Mhm,” Harry replied thoughtlessly, finger dragging along the spines of the books, “Asteroid, Astro, Astro, Astrology, Astrology, Astrology, ha! Astronomy.” He pulled out the text and handed it to Hermione, oblivious to her calculating gaze.
“You are?” he asked thickly, and Harry nodded. “Oh thank Salazar. I thought you might be, but I didn’t want to break any rules by telling someone, and then last week with the broom, I thought for sure… I’m so relieved Harry, you have no idea.” Drake looked as relieved as he claimed, and Harry’s mouth was on his cock faster than either of them could say “lumos.”
“What’s tonight?” Harry glanced up from the stack of papers that crowded his desk. Now that he was looking closer, he could see the lines of tension in Draco as he leaned a hand on the door jamb, idly picking at the molding.
The curse was all Harry’s fault. He was the one who was supposed to watch the team’s back as they picked their way through the wards in the ancient building. Harry had underestimated the kickback of rushing in. He had misjudged the angle, he had acted carelessly. He had plucked the wrong cord of the protection spells on the third floor, and he’d barely had time to act before Draco had shouted at them to
“I, well I… Don’t know,” Harry sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses. “He’s… Different than I thought. He’s… I may have misjudged him.”
- was in his friend's home. He wasn’t okay with how Malfoy was wearing a french style auror robe and playing idly with his hair, how he was leaning back in his chair in such a way that made him look like he
“I hope so,” Harry chuckled softly, his mind full of his parents, of his family that was taken from him. “I’d tell them hello. I’d tell my mother hello.”
It wouldn’t have been that bad, but the man was impossible to pin down. At times he knew things nobody else knew, like where to hit wards cast by dark wizards so that they came down in only three hits, or how to get past mind-numbing fog bombs without losing track of time. Other times he was so calculating and cold that it felt like he was less a person and more a finely turned weapon, which was unsettling and left Harry with the taste of copper in his mouth. But then Malfoy would smile, or make a joke, and christ- the man could be painfully funny- and Harry would bite his lips and remind himself over and over that Malfoy was a Bad Person and Couldn’t Be Trusted. It was desperate work.
Once he was fully prepared, Harry rolled a condom on, slicked up his cock and straddled the man on the table. He pressed in slowly, listening to the man under him breathe in shattered gasps of air. And then he was in, and it was tight and hot and Harry had forgotten how fucking good it was to feel this. Drake was babbling again, “Please fuck me, please please please, let me come please, I’m dying,” he rambled, and Harry pressed his hands into Drake’s back. The angle was too awkward for anything more than shameless rutting, so Harry thought he would push Drake as far as he could, until he broke. Harry pressed down in circles on Drake’s back, massaging with the cooling charm and rocking the tip of his cock into Drake’s soft heat. The man was gasping and shaking again, his arms straining against the ropes. “I’m, I’m gonna come, I’m so close, oh, Hal-” Harry pulled off and stepped away from the table as fast as he could, and Drake cried out into the table, humping on instinct and whining deliciously. “No, no, no, no,” he muttered, and Harry licked the shell of his ear.
“I was in love with my coworker,” Draco replied, and he sighed when Harry slumped. “I had been pretending, pretending that you were really you, because I thought it would help get you out of my system. And it didn’t.”
“Thank you, darling,” Harry leaned forward into Malfoy’s space as he took the drink. He kept eye contact as long as possible. “You have lovely eyes. So blue,” he whispered, nearly out of his seat now. The eyes were safe to like, they weren’t Malfoy’s. Malfoy blushed, and it was almost pretty on him. Harry smiled and brushed a strand of hair away from Malfoy’s face, and that’s when Duchene snapped.
“Is that so?” Harry asked, taking a biscuit and nibbling the corner of it. It was anise, sweet and licorice-y on his tongue.
“No, no that’s fine,” Mafloy cocked his head to look Harry in the eye. He was insufferably guarded now, when only a moment ago he had been smiling and drinking as if he belonged with them. Harry was pleased that Malfoy had been shaken from that delusion. “We’ll just have to think of something else.”
of it all, I swear!” Hermione was sitting in the loveseat across from him, her feet perched on a footstool and a cooling charm hovering around her.
“Auror Potter! You’re still here, wonderful. I was looking into the list of potions ingredients that were found at Vimbards last week, and it seems as though siren hair was one of the boxes that had gone missing in the attack on Cherry street, you know, the one with the fox animagus as the witness, yes? Anyways, I think I found another link between the two incidents and I would be interested to see what you have to add, you see because-” Malfoy had moved into the office now, his eyes glinting in the dim light. Harry suppressed a shiver.
“Can I help you, sir?” Malfoy offered humbly, as though Harry wasn’t two moves from tearing his throat out and leaving the country, let alone the case.
Malfoy would not stop staring at him. Every time Harry would turn the page of his files, or stretch his arms above his head, Malfoy would drag his eyes over him, and it was unsettling.
It seemed that Harry was miraculously alone in his appraisal of Malfoy’s character. Everywhere he turned, people were singing praises for the stylish new “bad-boy” Auror, back from his fall into darkness.
Harry cried then too, watching as Draco spoke quietly to Rose in french, as Hermione dosed on the couch, as the evening light encased them in a soft orange glow. Draco stayed until it got dark, until Ron had come in, rubbing his eyes and yawning, until Harry’s feet went numb and he had to sit on the floor, letting his tears drip onto the hardwood and streak down his glasses.
“It’s fine. Draco, there’s a sweet hotel down the street called ‘The Impeccable Pig.’ It’s truly lovely, trust us,” Hermione grinned and looked at Ron, who flamed red. Draco laughed easily with them, and Harry’s chest tightened. “They have a few spare wizarding rooms that are usually open. I’ll call now and check.” Hermione eased out of her chair and meandered down the hall, leaving Harry alone with his best friend and his worst nightmare. Well, second worst.
“Really?” Hermione feigned shock. A hole was torn in the thick curtains that were draped over the window, and dust floated through the beam of light over Hermione’s shoulder, illuminating her fly-away curls with a backdrop of gold.
“I’m a wizard,” he blurted, squeezing his eyes shut against the incredulous questions he knew would be coming. When he opened his eyes, Drake looked faint.
When he came to, he was clean and wrapped in his covers. But he was also alone in his bed, the lights off, and he felt his heart collapse around itself. He was filled with indescribable dread, eating him from the inside, and then the door opened. Draco Malfoy stood there, backlit by the lights in the living room, a glass of water in his delicate hand. Harry took the glass gratefully, and then Draco was with him, wrapped around him perfectly, as though he was made to be there. Draco kissed the nape of his neck and Harry breathed in the sweet smell of jasmine as he fell asleep.
“I was perfectly civil!” Harry argued, and Andromeda just shrugged. “What’s with you knowing french?” He countered, feigning disinterest despite his burning curiosity.
The club seemed almost like a hotel, with its eerily empty front room and too-quiet hallways. Harry read the number on his key. 432. He walked the halls until he found the matching number, and he knocked.
Malfoy looked him up and down slowly, analyzing every curve and movement. “Nor I,” he said, shrugging. “Distaste isn’t quite as striking on this face, lovely as it is.” Malfoy mused, and Harry bristled at the criticism, as backhanded as it was. Raucous laughter burst from a far table, and Harry flinched at the interruption.
“Uncle Ree! Uncle Ree, look, Draco isa pirate!” The seven year old beamed, his hair a stark white replica of Malfoy’s blond head.
“Lay down.” Harry said, and Drake did, pushing himself until he was on his stomach. “Can I take these off?” Harry asked, lightly touching the fabric on the back of Drake’s legs, and his breath hitched again.
Harry ordered food before Drake arrived. He had polyjuiced already, his skin still stinging from the horrifying twist of it. He laid the pasta on the table, opened a fancy bottle of muggle wine and prayed that he was making the right call.
“No, you absolute hobgoblin. You just reminded me of someone, and I was trying to place it.” Malfoy responded coolly.
That night, Drake came screaming Harry’s name, and it felt so right that Harry had to fight to keep his mouth to himself. He cried after Drake left, curled up in his too-empty bed.
“Are you coming out to count down with us?” She asked, a smile on her lips, as though she’d just walked in on them discussing politics and not necking in the dark like school children. Harry heard Scorpius shriek with laughter from the other room.
The door swung open, and not a single head turned to watch as he sidled through the dark musty room. The music and general revelry of the place hurt his ears, and he swallowed down the thick scent of cheap whiskey and bitter herbs that smoked in the mouths of the patrons. Across the room, Harry thought he could see a figure that looked like officer Chang, but he couldn’t be sure in the dim lighting. He slowly worked his way to the bar, glancing at faces and listening to the conversations as he passed. Jason Duchene had already disappeared. A pair of rotten looking blokes were fighting over a card game. A dame in a shimmering black dress was lounging in a booth, two foolish half-dressed men promising her riches and fame in return for her “gifts.” A goblin was talking to a scared young wizard, waving his hands and sneering. Harry catalogued it all back to Ron as he walked. He took one last quick glance around the floor before he reached the bar, noted that there were three strong-looking guards in front of the back door, and then he looked up to meet the man he was here for. But there was nobody behind the bar.
“Is Alberts the bloke who tried to turn down the Wolfsbane Initiative?” Harry added, though he was sure he knew the answer.
“If you- If I can- If you need, I can, um-” Harry stumbled over his own tongue, and suddenly Draco felt too close, too loud, too alive beneath Harry’s hand on his arm.
“I was still in the garden. Did something happen?” Harry felt dread unravel in him. He hadn’t seen Draco this upset in years, even with Harry’s constant baiting and jeering in spring, even with their careful friendship, even with the struggles Draco had shared with him over the past few months.
,” was the muttered response, and Harry squeezed as Drake keened. Harry adjusted the other boy until he was laying with his dick trapped between his body and the table, and he caressed the milky ass that was on display.
“Ah, of course. Quite right.” Malfoy’s face had gone quite pale, and Harry was comforted by the fact that Malfoy looked as though he’d been chastised. He turned to walk out into the hall, but something took over in Harry and he grabbed Malfoy’s arm before he could leave.
“Oh, kind of you to notice - my new diet is strictly made up of evil planning and flobberworms,” Malfoy would quip, barely a beat later.
Harry nodded. They cleaned together in silence, plates clicking and water running intermittently. They picked up debris from the rooms of the house while the water boiled, straightening pillows and unsticking the lights from where they were draped along the walls. Draco called him in after a while, pouring rum into the tea when it was done steeping, adding lemon and honey. They sipped it in the garden, watching as the moon rose over the trees, hovering close to one another.
“Harry,” he responded, level as ever, though his cheeks were still flushed and his clothes had just been messily dragged on.
“Blimey Harry, when did you get so dashing?” He flashed a brilliant smile at Harry and wagged his eyebrows.
Though it was slow, he still made progress. He bought Malfoy a drink in the pub after work, and they bickered over the superiority of dark versus light spirits.
They slotted together like puzzle pieces when Draco laid him down, and kissed into his mouth so feverishly that Harry shivered. There was no power struggle this time, no one-upmanship, only the burning slide of skin on skin on skin, and Harry’s breath caught every time Draco ground down into him. He was near the edge when Draco wrapped his hand around the base of Harry’s cock, squeezing and keeping the orgasm at bay. Harry was wrecked.
Harry hovered in the doorway as Draco cooed over Rose, as Hermione asked how it was that her heart had never loved so fully before.
“Jus’ not hungry,” he responded, and it didn’t take a genius to figure out where he had adopted his imperious attitude from. Silence reigned for a few long seconds, with Harry carefully watching where Malfoy’s hand rested on Teddy’s back, strong and sturdy and pale. Malfoy cleared his throat.
“You trust him?” Harry fiddled with his buttons again, shrugging off his cloak and relaxing into his home.
The curse had collapsed Draco’s lungs, had sucked all the oxygen from his blood like a vacuum, and had knocked him into a three day coma. Harry barely left the hospital for those three days, only abandoning his post to check in at Andy’s, to talk to a mind-healer, to sleep on Ron’s office couch for a few hours at a time, or to snack on salty dry crackers with Hermione. He tried not to cry. He had been told it wasn’t his fault. He couldn’t stand the idea of Scorpius being like him. Alone.
to not scare him away like that. Every time you come into the room he skitters away like a mouse.” Andy sat across from him and poured them their tea, piping hot and steeped to perfection. Teddy climbed up onto Harry’s lap and grabbed his hand, brushing his small fingers over the scars he found, pale little treasures traced onto Harry’s rich skin.
Harry wandlessly cast a silencing charm over himself, and watched as Malfoy sneered at the display. It only took a few moments for him to come and stand in front of Harry’s stool, but the seconds dragged in Harry’s mind. There was no way he would-
A last hurrah, they had called it. Harry had gotten a stitch in his side from laughing when Ron told him the plan, tipsy and tired. Draco had just shook his head, telling them it was a terrible idea and smiling like a contented cat. It
“I-” Harry began, but Ron glared at him. “Fine.” He slumped back into his chair. A few seconds passed before Harry glanced up again, and Ron looked all too pleased with himself. The fire cracked, and it reminded Harry of jeering laughter. Fuck, he wouldn’t be surprised if this murderous house was laughing at him, it seemed to have a shine for dark humor.
“If you want to, sure.” Drake picked a spot on the floor and Harry went over to where toys were splayed out on a table that smelled strongly of disinfectant. He grabbed the rope, and then on second thought he also nabbed a bottle of lubricant and a soft paddle. Then, he walked back to Drake and began unbuttoning his flouncy shirt. He grabbed his arms and tucked them behind him, loosely wrapping the rope around Drake’s wrists and slipping his finger between the knots to make sure there was still enough space for him to move around, just in case. He was briefly distracted by the thought of Drake wrapped tightly in the back rope, contrasting with his pale skin and pulling his limbs taut. The man was really too pretty to be real, and Harry caved, nuzzling into the blond’s neck. He smelled like jasmine and apple, crisp and clean.
“Because he’s… well, he’s bloody smart. And he apologized quite sincerely to me. And he helped me with the case that had been bugging us for months. And he asked for my help, too, which Hermione agrees shows a great deal of awareness and growth, and… Merlin Harry, you forgive everyone else- why not him? You saved the man from hell and you can’t even look him in the eyes.” Ron swirled around his tea, and Harry sighed.
“He’s all right. He’s with Andromeda.” Draco looked confused. Scared. Their voices were quiet in the darkness, whispered like the wind through the trees, as if they were trying to leave the air untouched by the sound of them.
“Lovely shrinking potion you have there,” Harry would remark over his burnt coffee, barely looking up.
“You called me Harry.” Harry should have been elated, he should have felt joy at the sound of his name on Drake's tongue, he should have been doing cartwheels. Instead, he was crushed. Drake was thinking of someone else. He shouldn’t have been hurt, he should have just ignored it, but it stung. The way they had talked to each other, the pieces of their life they had shared, that felt like more than just an exchange of services and money. It had felt like… he didn’t know what it felt like.
They joined their family as the year turned over, a mess of shouting and joy that spilled out the open windows and into the icy night air. Harry didn’t know he could ever feel as peaceful as he did just then, the clock striking twelve, Weasleys singing, Draco holding his hand. It felt like magic. Perhaps it was.
Scorpius was asleep in Draco’s arms, and their conversation had lulled in response to the infant, both of them reluctant to wake him with something so callous as verbal communication. A cat meowed from the hallway, and Draco 'tsked, a small smile playing on his lips. He looked soft like this, mostly recovered, glowing, holding his son close.
“Antione!” He barked, and Malfoy flinched. “Come here, pet.” Malfoy nodded and was by his side in an instant. “À qui appartiens-tu?” Duchene murmured into Malfoy’s neck, and Harry shivered.
“I don’t kiss on the mouth, and I won’t do anything that involves scarring. Try not to pull my hair, but if that’s what you’re really into then it’s fine. My safe word is Chimera, and I don’t need any aftercare, so you’re free to leave when you’re done.” Drake took Harry’s hand in his and kissed his thumb. “We can go slow, you have me for three hours.” Drake’s eyes looked large and lusty, his pupils dilated just from the chat.
They should have been dead. They would have been, if Draco hadn’t been so quick, if he hadn’t shielded them when he did, seconds before it was too late. His lightning-fast reflexes had left Harry and Ron with little more than a few broken bones, well enough to pull Draco from the rubble, well enough to yell his name, well enough to apparate him directly to St. Mungo’s.
“What do you mean, Malfoy’s going to be there.” Harry was sitting in his office at Grimmauld, his auror robes half undone, and Ron was glancing queasily between Harry and the floo, his mouth in a tight frown.
Even Andy seemed resigned to the Shytherin’s company. Harry caught them in the kitchen talking quietly to one another, Malfoy’s head bowed, Andy’s hand resting on his cheek. He was holding her other hand in both of his, rubbing it over, shaking his head. Harry watched a tear roll down her cheek, and Malfoy wiped it away. He was so gentle, the back of his hand brushing her skin with reverence. Harry walked away before they spotted him.
“Of course you have,” Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat. Draco’s head was tilted slightly, his eyes bright and filled with the sunshine from outside. His hair caught a rainbow that had bounced off the decorative glass of the windows, washing him in color and softening his harsh angles, his high cheekbones, his sharp nose. He was wearing a light sweater, deep green and cashmere. Scorpius was cradled in his arms, small and precious, safe in his father’s embrace. Tiberius jumped out of Harry’s hold as he stared, mouth slightly agape and tears threatening him as they so often did these days.
“You’re right, it’s not funny. Terrible joke, Hermione, really, such poor taste.” Ron deadpanned, and Harry’s chest felt tight, full.
“Draco’s transferring… here. For a year. Robards requested it because of our teamwork on the Duchene case.” Ron rubbed the back of his neck and shot Harry a careful smile. Malfoy’s gaze was burning and unwavering. The lights in the small kitchen flickered gently as Harry felt angry magic lick up his body. “Brilliant? No?” Ron’s voice sounded small.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked, pulling up a stool and wrapping his fingers around Draco’s wrist. Draco let his hands fall, and his eyes were wet.
“Sure, why?” Harry had answered, his feet on his desk and his mind was back in his flat, with the lights low and his fingers in Drake’s mouth. He was rubbing the knuckle of his thumb over his bottom lip, remembering how Drake bit down on it in the throes of his pleasure. Malfoy was staring.
“Yes, yes! He just won the Navy and saved the, um, the Princess! See that?” Teddy pointed to a pot of jam and a pepper shaker. Malfoy remained impassive as always, his eyes never leaving a spot on the table. Harry nodded, his eyebrows drawn together as if contemplating a serious naval battle. “Can I have a sweet?” Teddy eyed the plate in front of them.
“Mmm,” he hummed and shrugged, as if it were a perfectly good answer. Ron didn’t look convinced. “I just don’t think he deserves it.”
It was on one of those nights where Harry was struggling to leave Draco’s home. They were up late, back from the pub and chatting up a storm in the kitchen. They had talked about loss, and how it felt to be without the people who raised them. They had talked about Astoria and Narcissa, they talked about Sirius and Remus, they talked about heartbreak, about the hopelessness of it. Draco had said the old records were muggle hits from the thirties and forties, that Narcissa had hidden them from Voldemort, that she and Draco used to dance to them when his father wasn’t around, swinging around each other in ballrooms filled with morning light. Harry had said that Grimmauld held echoes of everyone who had lived there, that it scared him when it was dark and quiet, that it reminded him of a cupboard underneath the stairs.
Harry shared that he felt lost when he didn’t have a cause, when he didn’t feel like he was doing enough to deserve the things he got. They never spoke about the war.
“Water?” He asked, and Drake lazily pointed to a cooler in the corner. Harry chugged a glass himself and then got one for Drake, watching as a trickle of it ran down his chin. Harry licked the spill up, dangerously close to Drake’s mouth, and he was met with fire when he pulled away. Drake’s eyes were eerily familiar now, a deep grey that was quickly clearing from the fog of submission, and it sent chills over Harry’s body.
When the knock on the door came, Harry felt his heart leap into his throat. But it was just Malfoy, looking shaken. His eyes were wide as he crossed the threshold, and he looked at Harry as if he had grown a horn. They stood in silence for a moment, and Malfoy just stared hard, at Harry, at the chairs by the coffee table, at the door to the bedroom, at the kitchen counters that were covered in mugs, Drake’s shirt that hung untouched over the back of a kitchen chair.
Draco peppered kisses down his body and engulfed Harry’s cock in his mouth, sucking and swirling his tongue in the way that made Harry scream. “Draco I can’t, I’m gonna-” And the hand was around the base again, stopping the burst of pleasure before it could rip through Harry. Then the hand was moving, and Harry was so painfully close that he saw stars.
And so Drake came over, and he came over and over and over. On Harry’s bed, on his kitchen table, on the floor, on the desk. And he kept coming over, at least once a week, for a month. And Harry could not fall in love with a muggle. He wouldn’t allow himself, not now and not ever. He wouldn’t fall for him, even when Drake showered in his shower, even when he ate crackers from the box in Harry’s kitchen, even when he kissed Harry’s jaw and whispered about all the things he would do to him. Harry wasn’t falling in love with a muggle, not even a little bit.
Harry didn’t. Instead, he slammed Malfoy against the wall, smiling when he heard the crack of skull against the wood. Malfoy’s mask didn’t slip in the slightest. “Make one wrong move, say one wrong word, and you’ll never see another Auror department again, no matter how far you run from your mistakes. If you hurt my friends I’ll find you and I’ll fucking castrate you myself.”
And now Draco Malfoy was in his fucking office, prancing about and bringing Ron tea every once in a while, as if he was wanted there. Harry wanted to throttle him. Or throttle himself. He wasn’t quite sure which one.
Oh, this reminds me of something. Do you realise that Grimmauld will react so much better to you once we’re bonded? You will share the Black heritage in the old sense of the word. I wouldn’t be surprised if the heart of the house didn’t recognise Sirius or you as the righteous masters. I’m not quite sure about this, though. Does the house take well to your commands?
again, Draco, but this time it won’t be because of your beloved. It’ll be because you’re the business-wizard of the year,” I teased, pecking sweet little kisses across your jaw. “Harry Potter, the public will say. Isn’t he famous because of his clever, gorgeous husband?”
I’m sure I must’ve stared at you for a whole minute with held breath and my mouth agape. And everyone there craned their heads just to get a glimpse of you, love. It was your day, after all. But you came so straight towards me. You made me feel like there was no one else in that crowded, noisy hall.
You noticed my aftershave some days ago, and I forget to tell you that your sense of smell did not deceive you. Vanilla, guaiac wood, and almond. It usually smells even better, but the original thing is fucking expensive. So when I started expecting to be a bit closer to you, mon amour, I wanted to smell nice and I wanted to put on some aftershave like I used to. As a makeshift solution, I started Transfiguring a rather neutral one, trying to get it to smell like one of my usual choices. I’m glad that you don’t think it’s pungent.
