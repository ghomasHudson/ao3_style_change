moved in, before the garden was full of werewolves, before the parlor was a place of nightmares, curtains forever drawn, house elves never quite able to scrub the blood out of the floor.
? Too good to help him or just too good in general? Was it a jab? An insult? He couldn’t think of a single time before today that Malfoy had ever said something nice about him.
There was something about being asked, not told, not yelled at, not tackled, that erased all Draco’s previous answers entirely.
Draco’s aim was wildly off, the pain in his arm was making his vision go spotty. He sent another curse as quick as the first, a crack echoing around the room. But Potter was just as quick, and Draco leapt out of the way just before the sink he’d been bleeding all over cracked and sent water shooting everywhere.
“I know.” Potter didn’t even look up. Draco stared at him. His hair was everywhere, a stray lock was glued into a point with Draco’s dried blood.
Even in the moonlight Draco could see Potter flush red. At the same time, though, his eyes went steely.
Draco rubbed little circles into Potter’s shoulder blades, unable to stop himself. His hands were shaking. So were Potter’s, he could feel them on either side of his face.
Katie Bell was back. Draco had walked into the Great Hall, and for the space of a heartbeat he’d felt relief. He had no illusions about his allegiances; if Katie had faced him on the battlefield he’d have no qualms about fighting her, about killing her if necessary. But this was not a battlefield, and he hadn’t hurt her in a fair fight. Hogwarts was not a battlefield.
Potter just stood there, staring at his arm and the spot on the floor where blood was plinking into a small puddle. It wasn’t enough, not yet. Draco raised his wand, this time at Potter.
“Hey!” Potter snapped, and jostled him. “Stay awake, you prat. We’ve got a ways to walk and we have to keep quiet.”
Potter huffed and didn’t answer. His arm was tight around Draco’s waist, and Draco realized that his own arm was slung around Potter’s shoulders, his hand clinging to him of its own accord. He could not remember a time they’d touched like this, not aggressive, not aiming to hurt, but to help. Draco cringed, remembering the way Potter’s nose had crunched under the heel of his shoe that night on the train.
He cast a quick scourgify on himself in the corridor outside the common room, but the blood had been dry for awhile, and he wasn’t particularly good at scourgify. His sleeves were still blotched with rusty-pink stains. Instead, he pulled his jumper out of his bag and hoped it would hide the worst of it.
Look where it had gotten him. He deserved this too, he knew. More than he’d ever deserved any of the rest. He sunk lower, into the well of self-loathing that was always there, just under the surface.
Because surely Katy Bell had told someone. If she hadn’t, she would. And if she didn’t, Potter would figure it out, or McGonagall, or Dumbledore. Or they would just kill him.
“‘Course you have one of these,” Draco slurred as they left the bathroom. “‘Splains so much, why you’re, you’re always…”
“Where are you even going to go?” Potter said, taking a step forward. “You know you won’t last a week out there with him after you. You won’t be able to use magic without having them track you, and I can’t imagine you know a thing about surviving in the muggle world.”
A moment later he snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face and Draco opened his eyes automatically.
Except there was a third option, wasn’t there. He’d said it himself: Potter was too good. He wouldn’t let Draco go just because he didn’t want to kiss him, he would get all apologetic, he would try and fail to hide pity and disgust, he’d tell him sorry but he just didn’t like boys that way, and Merlin’s beard Draco should have just stunned him the moment he’d showed up in the dark hospital wing to cause trouble, because kind rejection was so much worse than a long walk through the dark.
Draco stared at his bare arm. Pomfrey had spelled off his bloody sleeve and scourgified the rest of his shirt clean. The Dark Mark was prominent, unharmed. It hadn’t even left a scar.
“Damn it all, what is it, what’s the spell—Malfoy you absolute idiot, why the hell would you do this—?”
Had he been serious about his offer to help him? Of course he had. But now the thought of advocating for Malfoy, of the looks on Ron and Hermione’s faces as he attempted to explain it all made his stomach burn.
Draco rolled his eyes and started pacing again, back and forth in front of Potter, trying not to look at him. Potter was looking at
“Don’t call them that,” Potter snapped automatically, then looked at the floor. “And that’s a ridiculous question. Ron’s my best friend, and Ginny…Ginny’s got Dean. And you’re just trying to change the subject.”
“Believe me, my parents dearly wish I would date Pansy. Or any Pureblood girl, really. Or show any modicum of interest in girls at all.”
Sometimes in those first, startling, honest moments after waking up he realized it was his greatest fear.
That word sounded too loud in the otherwise silent hospital wing, reverberating around them. Potter seemed strangely affected by it. He took a shuddering breath and put his head in his hands.
Potter pulled back and looked at him, examining his face for a moment, trying to read beneath what he’d just said. He leaned back in and gave Draco a long, close-mouthed kiss, then sat up, sliding off of him to sit cross-legged on the floor. Draco joined him, leaning his back up against a bed post and stretching his long legs out next to Potter, whose eyes ran down to his bare feet and up again.
“Just a bit further, nearly there,” Potter said, and his voice was softer than Draco had ever heard it.
Potter’s scowl deepened. “I don’t want to hit you, you idiot, I want to make you stay here and not let you do anything stupid.”
Draco took a step forward as well. The door to the hospital wing wasn’t far, but Potter was fast, and Draco was still healing.
It was too much, an impossible loop that was winding its way around his neck. He couldn’t get out of it.
He lowered his wand and held up a hand, approaching slowly like Draco might bite. He didn’t. Part of his arm had started to clot, but the deepest part of the wound still bled freely. He watched the blood pool on the floor, mixing with the water from the broken pipes, dissipating into nothing. Maybe that’s what it would feel like, just a slow, slip away…
Draco needed to get out. They would be coming for him come morning, Dumbledore, Pomfrey, Potter, maybe even the Ministry. Potter had seen the Dark Mark, so had Pomfrey. How could he have been so stupid? He paced the length of the hospital wing, blinking quickly, hands twitching. The combination of potions Pomfrey had given him was still making him see spots, still making him tired, but his anxiety had won over his need for sleep.
“Malfoy,” Potter hissed. “If you don’t shut up, I’m going to leave the cloak and just levitate you down the halls in front of everyone.”
, found his body and everything that would be dragged with it into the light. The cabinet, the necklace, the poison, the
He cringed with renewed embarrassment that he’d told Malfoy he was ‘obsessed’ with him. Surely that wasn’t what Hermione had meant when she’d said it. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t remember it, hopped up on all the healing potions Pomfrey had given him. Or maybe he would remember it and lord it over Harry until the end of time.
“If I have to,” Potter said, and squared his shoulders. His seeker’s shoulders, well-shaped but rather narrow, made for speed, not strength.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. Pomfrey hadn’t bothered to scourgify his clothes. His sleeves and the front of his shirt and trousers were streaked with Draco’s blood.
Maybe it would be better if Potter did it. The Dark Lord couldn’t fault him for it then, and Potter wouldn’t be cruel. He never had been. But Potter didn’t finish his spell.
She disappeared into her office and Potter stood stiffly next to the bed like he was thinking about sitting on it. After a moment he pulled over a chair.
“Quit blushing,” Draco said, his own face bright red as well. Potter looked electrified, full of some quiet, inaccessible energy he didn’t know what to do with. His eyes were all over Draco’s body, like the last little ripple between them had finally smoothed out and he could see him for the first time. It felt like Felix Felicus, being looked at like that.
under his breath, and Potter was muttering back, peering into his eyes, one trembling hand on his face.
“How are you going to stop me?” Draco said, very quietly. Potter blinked, looked entirely overwhelmed. Draco leaned in a bit, just to see what would happen, just to give Potter something to think about. He was never going to see him again, and in these last moments he felt the rules that had always existed between them evaporating. Potter swayed a bit where he stood, eyes going impossibly wider, breath hitching—
Draco didn’t know why he was saying these things. His tongue had taken on a mind of its own. The combination of potions made him feel warm and far too comfortable, like he was drinking butterbeer by the fire.
Draco’s breath hitched because Merlin that sounded far too much like the things Potter sometimes said to him in his imagination.
Potter looked shocked. His arms folded somehow tighter, like he was trying to reign himself in. “Why didn’t I
“If you tell anyone about this, I’ll tell everyone about what just happened,” he said, and Merlin, what in hell was he on about? But he unfurled the blanket and threw it over both of their heads. It had gone silvery-transparent and Draco nodded. Potter didn’t want to be seen with him. Or didn’t want others to see the blood that had soaked through both of their clothes.
“Oh.  Er.  No,” Harry manages, tipping back his glass and pretending that he cares about every last sugary drop.  A tray hovers to his side, right on cue, and he swaps this second empty glass for one full.
James sighs, as though he’s been aware of this all along.  “It’s not a crime,” he allows, though it still doesn’t sound as though he’s in charge.  “He’s too proud of that life he lived without us.  He won’t let anyone get out of him what it looked like.”
“For Merlin’s sake, Granger,” Pansy snaps, pulling a face.  Her behaviour’s slipping, with Alfie in the other room.  “He’s thinking about seducing his boyfriend.”  She says it scathingly, flippant, distracting.  “Were you too busy being a swot to realise what it did to poor Draco, watching Harry Potty
Harry feels warm wool twill against his reconstructed skin, mostly in the arch rather than his heel and toes.  He feels more.  Draco keeps cradling him close as he shifts closer, pressing his thumb under the joint of Harry’s big toe, rubbing in again.  His hand is hard bones and warm.
.  Draco could feel him in the house nonetheless, a presence deep in his solar plexus like ancestral fault, original sin.
“It bears little relevance to our present situation,” Draco dismisses, because the write-up is for him, not everybody else.  With the parchment roll bound back up, he turns his attention to the veil’s forlorn near-empty bell jar and makes ready to vanish its extension, hopefully without bursting the thing and trapping them all in the choice between life and death until the end of time.  “Now, if you’ll let me,” he says, “I really do need to concentrate for this.”
“I thought that I could be presumptuous enough –” Draco mocks, opening his eyes and looking at Harry with a startling depth of longing, even fuzzy.  He must have apparated here, Harry thinks.  It’s the middle of the night.
.  This was the dream that he always lived for, the way that Harry always lived for his dad, and – and he thinks that he knows exactly how Harry feels, looking the man in the face, because it
, a charm for unpacking trunks.  Harry’s only ever heard about it; he doesn’t know the counter.  He’s never unpacked in his life.
With a sigh, Harry pulls back the duvet.  He’s only wearing his t-shirt and boxers, and can hardly be an attractive sight, all feet and toes and hairy legs, unnecessary aviators.
At the end of the day, Harry’s kind.  He only leaves their new addition hanging for a couple more seconds.  “You know,” he says lightly, arms crossed, “now’s about when most people say that I look like you.”
.”  He seems appalled by the idea.  “I had no formal standing with him at all.  He had his parents and Sirius was his godfather.”
For a single sudden sharp moment, Harry wants her.  Badly.  He’s turned on from before and it makes him cringe, because he’s not sure that he ever did want her, actually.  He didn’t know what he wanted to do with her.  They settled on this for Christmas, 1998, no matter how often Draco used to tell him that they would end up together.  At the moment of death –
Harry looks up and glares.  If she’s going to imply that Ron’s bad at his job…  “They’ll follow clues,” Harry says shortly, without hesitation.  “People always retrace their steps.”
Annoyed by the ugly, outmoded tent interior, Draco couldn’t comprehend why Harry Potter was there, holding Draco’s arm.  It was inevitable, he supposed, because Potter was always there at times like this, but it shouldn’t – it shouldn’t have been allowed.  He shouldn’t have smelled of sun and the sea, sharp stones.  He shouldn’t have appeared in the closing moments of the war, nor now, not freed the family prisoners nor stolen Draco’s wand, not saved Draco from fire, not now dragged Draco out of the house where his parents
“Erised.”  Draco lets it sound in his voice, deep and posh, like something from a period drama, and he nods, not saying no.  “It’s a start,” he agrees, and the charm flashes bright.
Without hesitation, without a single thought for the way it might come across, Draco makes a face.  “Has this war not been remembered enough?” he dares say, talking past Harry to the wardrobe behind him.  “The bastard’s dead and we’ve had ten years of mourning.  What’s left?”
All the same – “I’m attached to it,” Harry says.  It seems unnecessary to spell out why, even if he can’t look his godfather in the face.
It was a vision, really.  The boy who lived, their saviour, the wizarding world’s greatest living hero – hidden in plain sight by layers and layers of beige.  There was a different energy to him, Draco thought, deferring teenage indignation in favour of caffeine, outdoor sport and late-night binge drinking.  He’d heard tell of it from Granger, but that had never fully registered.  She’d said that the
“Your mum’s flooing the pubs,” James declares, as though Harry has asked, as though they’re moving on.  “She’ll have them watch out for Padfoot; she’s very persuasive.”  He leaves the spoons in the tureen and picks up a fork with his left hand, stabbing quills.
When silence falls, it’s heavy and thick.  McGonagall is looking at the ceiling, clearly taking comfort in her sherbet lemon.
, anyway,” mutters Sirius in the end, dragging the point back to something else, brushing greasy hair off his face.  “That Malfoy boy thinks he’s the sun.”
As the road rolls on, Harry looks out at the landscape, simple and lovely, trees in the distance.  The last of the lingering tension from the car park unwinds, and Harry keeps his eyes on the road.  He glances at the mirrors every now and then, but the world is bludger-free.
“Moony has to come back to see his son,” Harry says now, rather hotly, because that’s now been explained and he’s keeping his focus on the point.  It’s what they forgot, up in Hogsmeade, and Harry refuses to forget it a second time.
“Mm,” accepts Draco, looking down at Harry’s socks and calming down, making Harry wiggle his toes.  He’s the most perfect study in angles, draped with black, his face austere.  “We’ll locate Ron and Hermione,” he says as though they’re his friends, acquiescing, slipping like silk from the bed, and Harry doesn’t trust himself to speak.  “Granger’s been taking it hard.”
Draco is filling a roll of parchment with spellscript, which comes out rather akin to musical notation, keyed to his wand.  He won’t be able to make out much until he goes over it, likely tomorrow.
Eyes are set in Harry’s vision, not grey, not pale or dark.  Hazel.  Brown edged with blue, vivid colours not green.  Harry stared at them for hours, once upon a time.
“Did you book a big bed at this castle?” Harry asks, not sure if he wants to be there or here or drinking champagne, certain that all three lie in his future.
“It’s difficult sometimes, to feel proud of the Office,” Harry tells Malfoy.  The Ministry group keeps getting delayed with the action plan.  The findings of the inquiry weren’t pretty; Kingsley’s called the whole thing a farce, retired these days, though Harry asks him a lot for advice – he’s been divorced since Harry was fifteen because he chose Harry and the war.  “But if we don’t believe in what we’re doing, then what are we?  We’re nothing but trained thugs.”
“I’ll apologise to Katie,” Harry promises Ron, sitting back, smirking but not looking as Draco twitches in outrage under his hand.
Harry rolls his eyes, because for a long time this was true.  “Yeah, well, he shouldn’t be, and you should rise above it.”
His expression is alight, his handshake unconscious and cocky as ever and he claps Kingsley hard on the upper arm.
aren’t embarrassed by the prospect of such terrible embarrassment, and by this point it’s spiralled into the absurd, Harry thinks, because it’s only that Kreacher’s popped up the wrong plates, when he shouldn’t have to pop plates at all.
“You need this now,” Luna’s saying to Harry, dreamy, taking the conker-gleaming jacket from her lap and throwing it around Harry’s shoulders.  It’s sweet of her, because she’s been vegetarian since childhood.
“I went to her shop on the Alley,” Pansy admits, as though this is embarrassing.  “I think she volunteered her and her
A sigh.  “And this is why I love you, Ron,” Hermione finishes, rolling her eyes, which makes Draco laugh.  It takes Harry a minute to suss out what she means.).
Lupin snorts, forcibly ignoring whatever it is in his head.  “You’re good, I’ll give you that,” he says.  “Six out of ten.  No, let’s say seven.  But that’s being generous.  James is oblivious to most things at the best of times, so you must have done something
And Harry finds this confusing, because he’s always thought that Molly and Audrey got on like a house on fire.
“It’s from colonial India by way of servant British cooks,” Draco explained kedgeree, rolling his eyes at Harry’s suggestion that they might serve shakshuka in an establishment like this.  His expression was wicked over the glass and bright crockery, and it was nice to see him in daylight, out of his coat.  He was wearing a slim roll-neck jumper, like so often, this one midnight blue, the fizzing flip of Harry’s insides a reminder of what he wanted from him.  “It’s a symbol of this country’s entirely unpleasant history: curried haddock, eggs and rice.  It’s a classic; still keen?”
On Thursday and Friday, the stag follows Harry.  He talks to it about Neville’s love of plants and his own lack of love for anything besides Teddy, after the war.
“All right, Padfoot,” Lily humours him.  There’s the scratch of her quill, presumably scrubbing out James’s earlier interventions.  “Though really,” she adds.  “Have you never thought about going after someone more stable?”
Harry looks up at her.  Her brown eyes are dancing, and she’s grinning, holding her husband’s hand.  Harry finds himself laughing, because he’s never read Ginny very well.
he seems to say, and Harry knows it’s awful, but he agrees.  “I will accept that the fountain needed to go – we’ve all accepted that now – but the replacement looks like something from a catalogue…”
“You said it yourself,” Harry throws back at him from the lavender-purple old playroom, wanting him to see what he’s done to go to where he is from where Harry’s sitting.  “You’re surrounded by dickheads who’ve never left home.  What do they know?  Don’t confuse being right with having people agree with you, Albus.”
Draco sighed in disgust, and Harry knew that it wasn’t at him.  “Old houses like ours used to keep their best rooms for the king,” he explained.  “Father liked to think of himself as an earl from the War of the Roses.”
It’s being scratched down, the table wobbling once on Florean’s uneven floor.  “I always think of Hermione and blue,” he explains, with underlines.  “She casts these little charmed flames, like bluebells.  There were bluebells in the Forest of Dean when we…”
“I – am going to break my wrist, wanking over you,” Draco threatens him, his eyes already turning back to sharp silver.
But Lupin looks intent, staring out of the window.  It’s as though there’s a plan, and it makes Harry’s stomach twist up entirely into a knot.  He bites down on his teeth.
“You could have killed yourself, you reckless fucking imbecile,” Draco continued to splutter, clenching his hand into a fist around hair and looking for any sign of splinching, looking at the back of Harry’s neck and down to his calves.  “You could have…”  He could have sent himself into nowhere, Draco thought.  He could have splinched himself into nowhere…  It still wasn’t clear whether the Nowhere Room caught every case because
“I bought them to try and turn you on,” Harry tells him, and his grey eyes flash to Harry’s, though his mouth doesn’t move.  “Then I’d stick with my knackered ones.”
“This isn’t –” Harry tries to complain, clawing at hair and the duvet as Draco insists on sinking further down, sucking the flesh of Harry’s stomach into his mouth.  This isn’t what the mirrors would be for, he can’t say.
Harry had a new jumper, Draco noticed then.  It was plum purple, and it brought out the bright contrast between his eyes and his hair and his skin.  Molly Weasley might have grown broody, moreso the more it seemed that only Bill and Percy were interested in fulfilling the family duty, but she could still knit an excellent jumper.
The best map that Harry owns of Ibiza isn’t huge.  It’s part of a guidebook for the Mediterranean islands, because he likes the idea of sailing around the whole sea on a boat.  A small boat, cutting through high waves between ports, if not a yacht, so that Draco can drink wine and wear white and eat things off a plate.
“Such is life,” says Harry’s mum.  Silence hangs for a few seconds, and his dad huffs again, before – “Come and help me, why don’t you?” his mum suggests.  “If this is what you’re going to be like.”
He glances at Alfie at the table, who is very small and must be getting tired from all of this mental activity.  He reins himself in.  “What are you focused on now that’s done?” he asks, instead of starting another argument.
It’s not been weird between Harry and his dad, in the end.  There’s no doubt that he’s been coming up to Scotland, catching Harry’s runs on the Map –
“Ravenclaw!” the witch seems delighted to answer, her blondish hair heavy and thick.  “We all left for Germany, that Christmas,” she admits.  “And a good thing we did!”
"Don't think about the homework, stressing about it will only make you feel bad. I'll figure something out," he promised.
So... The Gryffindor had actually appreciated his music? Draco wasn't sure why this stunned him as much as it did. But that wasn't even all; Harry had also asked him to continue playing.
"Great." Draco stepped back but hesitated. Potter seemed very agitated. It'd be a shame to let that go to waste. "That potion requires a boomslang skin, not bloodroot," he remarked while scanning the list of sloppily written words beneath the other boy. "As much as I enjoy watching Snape roasting you over the tiniest mistakes, I can't stand stupidity."
He softly chuckled as he bent down, "You don't have a scarf with you, don't you?", fingers brushing over the red spots.
A groan left Harry's lips as he lifted his weight to have a better view of the book the blonde was holding. Why did they have to do this right now anyway… He tried to focus yet his mind still felt a bit fuzzy and the way Malfoy explained it in his own way didn't appeal to him at the moment. As he stared at the book, trying to look as if he was actually paying attention he could feel himself nod away and sink away from time to time. He didn't want to fall asleep though. Not only would it be rude, but he also didn't wish for another nightmare if the blonde would still be there.
After a while, Draco noticed that he'd gotten lost in his own words. He'd just been talking and talking, and not really paying any attention to Potter. When he shifted his gaze to the other, he noticed how tired he looked. Actually, Draco was pretty sure he was already dozing off.
A small hum left his lips as he dared to lay his head to rest on the blond boy's chest. It felt perilous to just act so freely with the Slytherin and sleep together with him, again. Yet laying down, cuddled up with the other in his arms he felt warm.
"Yes, you've said so," Draco nodded. "But you'll have to do it again, this is not the room it will show you for the party, sorry." Draco looked at the other, slowly tracing his features with his eyes and taking everything in bit by bit.
Malfoy was glad Potter liked the idea, and that he seemed to be willing to help him with it. It seemed like they were equally excited for it. "Great, great…" He said as he finished his tea. "I'll inform my friends, and the other Slytherins maybe. So if you could do the same with the Gryffindors, all we have to do is plan it out. Maybe find some people to help."
Before he could answer Madame Pomfrey walked up to the blonde. "He can't sleep anyway so I would rather have you keep him some company to keep the kid sane."
"I believe that's my own fault," he spoke up, this time the edge on his words sharper. "I get you might be disappointed or the sort, yet you seem quite furious. Can you stop that?"
If he didn't know better, Draco would've thought that was straight-up flirting. The situation, however, wouldn't have allowed that to happen, so he wasn't sure if that was really what was happening. Now it just left him blushing, but kind of confused. It felt weird to talk about stuff like this while they were cuddled up, it really felt rather personal. "Potter," he started, still considering his words for a moment. "Why would you say that?"
Even though the Slytherin had wanted Potter to leave since the first moment he'd noticed he was in the room, he couldn't get himself to just send him away like that. Besides, would Potter tell anyone about this? What did he even think of all of this? It was like giving him a peek into not only Draco's head but also his childhood. What would the other do with this information?
He suddenly remembered Pansy's earlier request. She'd asked him to play for her, but he was probably very rusty. He had to practice in order to show her something he deemed good. He'd wanted to pick it up again for a while now anyway, this was the perfect opportunity to actually do it. There was only one problem: where would he be able to play in privacy? In the past he'd used the room of requirement, maybe that could work again…
When Draco arrived at the entrance of the hospital wing, he could see that Potter was restless by taking one glance at him. He hesitated about walking in or staying at the entrance, but eventually caught the other's eyes and awkwardly walked in a little.
"I... suppose you're wondering what this is all about," the blond began, not even sure what he should say now that he'd practically invited the other to stay.
Harry was glad Malfoy felt comfortable enough around him to share this with, especially since he seemed to have held it back. It reminded him of how he had held little things back from the other when they had been open and he felt bad about it.
"Sorry if I made you worry, I just have a lot on my mind that is clashing with each other. Ron is avoiding me as the pest and Hermione stays out of my way as well to please Ron and get us to talk. And…" he paused to switch his gaze towards the ground. "My mood has turned grim because of that as well due my mind being fixec on... someone else. It's all just a mess. My apologies for saddling you up with my problems, I bet you might have enough problems dealing with your own thoughts and businesses."
He turned around and started walking towards the hospital wing, telling himself over and over again that this was just because bringing Potter there had made him responsible. That was the only reason for his curiosity for the other's wellbeing.
The way Potter put things, confused Malfoy a bit. He didn't question it though and simply nodded his head. Apparently, Potter didn't care if it was a girl or a guy, which was new to the Slytherin. It made him wonder, but he didn't say anything.
Harry could feel his cheeks heating up and his hands balled into fists as on instinct, grabbing the sheets tightly as his knuckles turned white. Why did he say that? Now he had to cover up or Malfoy would think weird of him, well if he didn't do that already.
"Potter, I believe you already have, seeing as how often you spend time in here," Draco sighed. He thought about the other's nightmares, a problem he had kind of promised to figure out. There was one time he hadn't had them, right? But that was when… Before he knew what he was doing, Draco, for once, spoke his mind.
"Oh, you are too," Draco said as he let out a short laugh, even though none of this was funny to him at all. He didn't know what would happen now. Would they continue to be friends? Would they be able to? Malfoy really needed to figure himself out, he couldn't leave Potter like this. He couldn't leave him to wonder what Draco thought about all of this, and if he felt the same way. He owed Potter an answer but simply couldn't find one just yet.
A nice and quiet thing like this couldn't last forever, which became clear when Draco noticed a black-haired girl walking up to them. Several alarm bells in his head started to ring, pushing him back into his normal behavior instantly. Pansy couldn't catch him hanging out with Potter, especially not this peacefully.
"Bloody hell," he softly murmured as he wrapped his arms tight around the other. He was going to get addicted to this.
Harry let himself sink in a chair, almost falling right next to it as he was totally lost in the other's movements. Was it normal for musicians to be this mesmerizing or was this just because it was Malfoy?
It would have been better if the other didn't just only lay there all stiff but actually gave in to the coziness as well. Maybe that was why he reached for the Slytherin's arm to pull it over him. It felt weird how he had been scooting away from the guy and feeling all nervous and fidgety just mere minutes ago while he was now draped over him and even going as far as to pull the other closer.
"Sure," he said, nodding faintly. "But you're not going with your friends..?" He'd been wanting to voice this question for ages.
"Well, for one, Ron's mom knits these lovely sweaters for everyone, including me," he started as he pulled on the end of the red sweater, a smile lingering on his lips. "Some might think they look ridiculous, but honestly they are the warmest jumpers I have ever had. As for the celebration itself, well, they have a long table in order that everyone can sit with each other, it makes it all quite cozy actually. Usually, they just have a nice meal and chat, that's about it, just being together. It really feels like a home when you're there because everyone shows so easily that they care about you." He paused with that.
Harry didn't really know how to respond to that, let alone had the will to do it. He simply shook his head with a sigh and turned back around again - he really had to find Ron or Hermione to help him after all.
"Potter," he murmured softly, not sure if that was simply a reaction or a request for attention. He supposed it was both.
Harry felt breathless as soon as the blonde played. The smooth sways he made and the concentrated gaze on the paper, made him really admire this. He had the front row to something that was so personal in the Slytherin's eyes.
As Draco got up, he noticed that his roommates were already up. This didn't surprise him, it wasn't even morning anymore. He quickly gathered some casual clothes, which were allowed during the weekends and which he was very grateful for because the dress shirts he owned were of much better quality than the hogwarts uniforms ones. He decided upon a dark grey one, and matched it with some black pants. He'd always thought dark tones suited him way better than the white dress shirt he had to wear for school.
"Harry," Hermione repeated. "How do you feel? Malfoy informed us that you were in the hospital wing, Madame Pomfrey told us it was indeed him who brought you here. Why didn't you tell us?" It started to dawn on him that he had felt extremely dizzy and Draco had helped him to get here. Though that the blonde had gone to fetch Ron and Hermione wasn't part of his memory. He barely knew that he had gone here at all.
Draco did hear him, but it took a while for him to fully register the words. He hated how he couldn't get himself to move, he had to get out of here. He took a deep, shaky breath, trying to unfreeze himself a bit. To Malfoy, it felt like it had taken ages before he finally kneeled down to crawl away from the weak spot. He knew that dividing your weight was a good thing to do, but thought it to be more efficient to crawl instead of roll.
He took one of the sheets out, took out his wand, and made it fly up in the air so that he could look at it as he played. He still felt a bit awkward, playing like this in front of someone else, but his Slytherin pride told him to get over himself and show the other that he was a brilliant violinist.
There was no way to rid himself of all his emotions and thoughts, so Draco just hoped it didn't show too much as he followed Harry out of the castle.
He turned to leave now that they were done in the kitchens, but got reminded of his awful manners once more.
Draco was a bit startled by all of this, but collected himself and looked over at the other. Harry raised his eyebrow before sitting up straighter in the bed.
Besides, Malfoy was mature enough to see that his childish feuds with Potter's friends should end. He wasn't 'my father will hear about this' Draco Malfoy anymore, he was nearly an adult. The war had changed him considerably, and he should've shown that from the start of their last school year. Now was the time to at least try to make up for that.
Malfoy, who'd been looking out over the lake, shrugged but didn't move his gaze away from the white scenery. Once again he got reminded of how much he liked the winter, even though it was freezing cold. He really felt the urge to look if the lake was frozen enough to stand on it. Maybe he could even use his ice skates this year, that would really be marvelous. He hadn't done that in ages.
Draco had heard people talk about him being a very unpleasant presence before he'd woken up properly, or at least before he'd gotten some coffee. As it turned out, they were absolutely right. It seemed as if he'd left the nice, kind Malfoy in the hospital wing. What was left was his usual cold posture. He eventually caught up with Potter and resumed their conversation. "May I remind you, that you've caused all of this?"
"And I'm quite sure your dad loves you, Draco," he mumbled to add to his words, his eyes failing to spot any tissues. He didn't happen to have any carrying with him, might have to start doing that if this was going to be a common thing. Though he hoped he wouldn't say something to break the other down ever again.
"It's not like I wouldn't expect that to happen to you," she started, "but I'm sure you also know how little that explains. You've been gone since yesterday's last class, from what I've heard you haven't returned to the common room since then. I'm just wondering where you've slept, that's all."
He desperately wanted the other to stay but wasn't even sure why. All he knew was that being left here alone was a scary idea.
"I see," Draco nodded softly. "Should I keep you company or do you wish for me to leave?" He asked, looking up at the other.
"I don't intend to be likable towards you, I thought you'd know that by now." Again, he ignored Potter's remark, but his posture had become a bit tense. Affronted, Harry stopped writing altogether and put his things down. "You know, Malfoy. There's a brief moment when you first wake up, where you have no memories. A blissful blank slate, a happy emptiness," Harry almost enunciated. "Whenever I see your face, I wish I could just stay in that moment." With that, he picked the feather back up and continued taking down his notes.
With a curt nod, Harry looked to the side. Where would Ron be around this time? Surely, the two of them normally hung out with Hermione, but there were times Ron and Hermione left on their own devices to get some 'alone time' together.
Malfoy's actions were clear to him, although he would be lying if he were to say it was reasonable to choose the side of a murderer like Voldemort. Though he understood on some level. You don't just choose for yourself, but for others as well. In this case, Malfoy had chosen to stay with his parents at the dark lord's side to stay with them and keep himself alive. People might have died because of him, but Harry knew very well that people around him had died because of him as well. If he had only…
Draco stared at the letter for a while, taking in his father's words. He felt a surge of anger coursed through him, but contained himself and neatly folded the letter back to its original state. There had to be an important reason for his parents to leave him at Hogwarts. Draco wondered if this really meant they had important things going on, or if they deemed the school to be a decent place to stay for their son. Either way, it had hurt him more than he'd like to admit. He put the letter away and collected himself as he continued on his way to the library. He had no time to be mopping or whining about a thing this. He just had to deal with it.
Draco nodded and turned around to get back to his dormitories. For the first time that day, he reached them without being stopped. He told the door the password and walked in. The common room was fairly crowded but not as busy as it could have been. There were students playing games, chatting or studying. This didn't surprise him, seeing as it was freezing outside, which meant it was freezing in the castle as well. It was nicer to sit in the common room, where there was a fireplace, instead of the icy great halls or library.
The reason why Draco even acknowledged Granger to be a living being, was because she was a top student. This meant they were often competing for the highest grade, and Gryffindors were bloody competitive. Slytherins were too. A combination made in hell meant to clash from time to time. Malfoy, for the first time in forever, let Potter do his work without interrupting. This was mainly because he'd have to explain it again if the essay turned out to be crap. Besides, the silence wasn't uncomfortable.
It took another minute before Draco had found his voice again. He cleared his throat and got rid of the pressing silence that had surrounded them. "What are you doing here?"
"Having you kiss me and then pulling back, showing clearly you disliked that? That hurts like hell. Like… youŕe toying with me."
"I'm going to bring this back," he mentioned, lifting it somewhat higher in the air to refer to the plate. He didn't bother to ask the other to join him, though he didn't come far.
"Anyway," he resumed, "should we get it over with right now, or can't you bear any more of me at the moment?" Still rubbing the sore spot on his head Harry huffed and turned to the other, unable to stop a small smile to form on his lips. "Oh yeah, duh. I always bang my head on tables in hopes to become friends." Once again he shifted in his seat, this time to open his books.
"I don't want you to say that when it was your mom that spared my life to get back to you," Harry snapped, freezing as he realized he had. He shouldn't have yelled, not with the other in this state. With a deep breath, he silently apologized, before pulling the other closer again. Harry reached for the other face again.
That was not what he expected. Harry thought Malfoy would just simply give him a nod in agreement and leave. He wasn't supposed to stay. Surely, Harry didn't want to be left alone in here but this was not how he thought that wish would come to existence.
"I know, sorry," the black-haired girl sighed. "Then at least play for me again sometime, it's been a while."
As soon as he'd drained his first cup of coffee, he got another one. After finishing that, he got some bread and got up. He was dying to isolate himself in his room with a book for the rest of the day but realized this wasn't possible. He still had quite some homework to catch up on, and he wasn't planning on just neglecting it.
“I’ll come down in a while.” Draco scoffed at the bravado, as if Harry could walk right now. The idea Potter was trying to fake it right now only said Draco wasn’t trusted.
“I can’t stay put you arse, I’m literally incapable of ignoring Blaise’s wishes--” Harry shoved him hard onto the floor and the ropes circled around one of the columns.
“Lotty!” Draco yelled and out popped the elf’s head from under the door handle, “Go collect all of these. Take the needles to the kitchen. Make soup. The rest - bring to us.” Lotty heard his urgency and left with a pop.
Draco set it aside and checked the other, its sender clear. Parchment was dyed and frilled near its edges, a trend outdated but one Daphne had never outgrown. Daphne’s was short. One word: ‘Tomorrow’, written in her swirly handwriting that was also too small for some to read.
“And you’ve come to file an official complaint against... yourself?” Draco laughed freely. “You should’ve came here earlier and saved me from Hermione.”
Draco hummed, he wasn’t interested in whatever Potter had to say. Poppy heads might work, combined with the herbaria and boiled. But boiled too long and it might lack the added effectiveness straight away. No, no, that wouldn’t work. This would be much easier if he knew what Charlie’s recipe.
“You did say last time I was here. Excuse--” Harry wouldn’t have it. He grabbed onto his elbow and Draco froze. Oh, this was the worst idea. Second only to snogging the bloke at a politically charged function.
The Manor continued to reject the monstrous energy firing towards its ward and Head of House. Theo didn’t bother to stay, he took Blaise outside and apparated away. It bled ash, clumps falling onto the ground as if it were made of brick. Around it the snakes of barbed wire rusted black, fell to the floor and withered away. Harry and Albus yelled to run. As if Draco had the strength for that.
And attacked him - attacked him - messing up his crown and crest feathers and — Draco tried to nip at him but an owl’s beak was small. Bastard, this would take forever to sit right. He flew, fled and shrieking by a stack of unfinished paperwork. Potter would pay for this.
“Tell them the ring’s a fake.” Draco blinked. Looked down at his hands and nearly died at the sight. Certainly there was a ring, one which looked identical on his opposing hand. It wasn’t one of the rings of Celius though, Draco couldn’t feel any of the malice and regret seeping through.
“You do?” The fact Harry sounded hopeful made Draco shift, and levitate over a cup of tea. This was going to be worse than any conversation they’d ever had.
“You’re off your trolly.” He shook his head like an actual teacher would, disappointment coming off in waves. “Smashed. Legless. Wait here, sober up a bit. I’m going to call Harry.” Harry wasn’t his caretaker, not his keeper. Why bother? Why even think to call Potter when he couldn’t even go talk to someone on his behalf? As if he’d even come find him.
“Do I have to?” Draco’s question was quiet and he couldn’t bare to see what Hermione’s expression said about it.
“I’m surprised you care so much for it.” Harry was looking down, so Draco followed the line of sight to his own hands, “Your wedding ring,” Harry explained.
“I don’t talk about work with my friends, it helps to separate the two. Draco sit and sign it.” No platitudes or begging, bribery or blackmail. It could be worse, it could be logged into the Ministry where anyone with high enough clearance could take a gander. He could take this and hide it. He could do that. He could do this. Hermione was trustworthy. Wasn't she?
“You should retire. Or go back full time. This half-way nonsense isn’t doing much but add stress you don’t need.”
Another match and another and another till Harry said, “I think I might be--” and the Manor buzzing concern filled his head., loud and consuming Draco lowered himself back to the ground, dizziness becoming too much.
Cooking Class did nothing new. Nothing Draco hadn’t done to the innards of beasts for his potions. He didn’t like the idea of having too many spices in his foods. Beside him Neville threw everything in till Draco could take a bite and breathe fire.
“Get out, and don’t come back.” It was the glare, the Malfoy Glare, not the sneer or the overconfident banter, Draco saw the contempt and for Scorpius to show it to Albus? Well, he wasn’t sure what was going on but Scorpius, as the Manor still told him, was hurt and Draco was still keyed in to halt that.
‘With whatever it is you’re planning,’ he left out. He bid Albus goodnight, Flooing to the awful place that demanded his presence.
“Fuck,” Draco said as he saw his weary reflection in the still water of Number Eight. He’d ruined his own life and taken Harry’s all in one fell swoop. What was the point in making potions for a dead man? Nothing anyone said would make this okay. A pop was heard behind him and he tensed, as Pansy used to call it, put up the walls. By the time Voldemort was in his house, Draco understood what she meant. He saw it, on his own face with an overlay of gaudy yellow as he bottled it all up and turned to address -- Lotty. He wasn’t sure how long this peace, these high defences and mazes of the mind would hold.
Blaise pulled out his wand to cast a shield or a counter-hex but the jinx knocked it from his hand. Swelling fast, with painful blotches made Blaise yelp and hiss as it bloated in size. He cradled his hand and Draco was satisfied. The sight gave Draco a rush, not many people got under his skin and less likely were the people Draco could retaliate against without qualm. Draco made sure to keep his on target, Blaise was known to fake injury if it helped in the long run.
Albus says that he hates the comparisons, but Harry can’t believe that this is true.  Two years as a reserve was enough for James to give up entirely on the idea of competing with his parents’ legacies.  Harry has secret hopes for Lily and Gryffindor, because he wants to make Minerva proud – even if Minerva says that she’s proud of all four of his children.
“And it’s not likely Dad can stay.  I know.  If he even…  Merlin,” Harry snaps, sounding entirely like himself for one crystal-clear delayed reaction, while Draco pulls his inner robe over his head.  “Who greets their son with a handshake and an introduction?”
His dad is looking at him, and if nothing else, then he’s the best friend of Harry’s godfather.  “I haven’t got anywhere with the eighties,” Harry says, looking down towards Draco’s tilted desk.  It’s clean and minimal, which Draco hates, though he likes to be tidy.  “There’s this letter from a GD, which says that in 95 he – or she, I s’pose – hasn’t heard from Moony in a decade.”
“Oh Harrio,” Lily Potter says at this moment, on her feet and crossing the floor to her son.  Draco looks up from the wooden floorboards to see that Harry’s flinching away from her touch to leave her looking distraught.  He looks at Draco and Draco knows, he knows that Harry is aware of everything that Draco’s been feeling for the past four years and more, all of it back to 1996.  He’s always aware of so much more than he ever fucking lets on.
There’s another cat coming in from the hallway, then another.  In the meantime, however, there’s a fluffy black kneazle-cross sitting on the back of the sofa and watching, not making a move.
There’s a boy in the frame looking back at him.  He doesn’t look much like Harry anymore, his eyes too wide-open and curious, his hair too big for his ears.  He stands between a mother and a father, who look exactly as they do in the waking world.  The father seems tall, because the son is not long eleven and his wife is shorter than him by several inches.  She’s slighter in much the same way.  The father’s hair is like the boy’s and he has quick hazel eyes.  The mother’s eyes are green like the sea.
Instead of replying, his mum tuts, pulling him into a hug and Harry squeezes her close.  “You don’t worry about me,” she insists before pulling back, tucking long blood-red hair behind her ears.
Stepping back, Harry Potter looked around, grabbing Draco’s wrist away from his jeans.  “This way,” he said, cocking his head as he led them down into a neat bricked-up alleyway.
He looks like a proud and impossible sneak thief who’s bullied his way into Draco’s flat – because he’s a father who looks like his
“Dora was a sweetheart,” Lupin declares with warm affection, as though this is what he’s been trying to say all along.  The emotion sounds odd, no usual part of his WWN voice at all.  “She couldn’t walk into a room without breaking china or otherwise making a racket, and I thought that that was the most wonderful skill to have.  She could carry a conversation entirely by herself and I was going to listen, get to know her.”  He shakes his head.  “I was going to have the wife, the family, the house…  Fuck being a werewolf and fuck being miserable and fuck being bent.”  He says it with no vehemence at all, smiling the softest of grins.  “Dora’d earn a salary and I would raise the children, so there.  Fuck the Ministry and fuck Dumbledore too.”
“This is a terrible idea,” Malfoy declares, the light in his eyes promising that part of him thinks the opposite.  “It’s only going to end with us wanking.”
“You and Mum both like being in control,” Ginny told him bluntly, once in lockdown, when they were lying together in bed.  “I don’t like being controlled.”
The school paid to run the Express yesterday for everyone in a similar position, so Ollivander and likely Luna with him will already be up here in Hogsmeade – but there are a number of places to stay, in and around town.  They’re all open for the season.  They’re all unplottable too.
Sitting up, Draco reaches towards Harry, crawling his fingers over the duvet in a way that makes Harry laugh and would make Ron shudder like anything.  “Have you never been frightened of spiders?” he invites Harry to confess.
Harry’s not sure that he can see anything.  He’s not sure why he’s talking about this.  “He was some dirty old man, is that it?” he asks himself, sniffing and looking at grass.  “He used me, he broke me and he killed me – that’s what Draco says –”
After showering and dressing in the flat, still alone, Harry makes his way downstairs.  There’s a couple of hours before lunch.  He thinks that he and Ron can play chess; he can lose and they can talk about nothing.
“It was only a chair,” Neville allows, looking towards Dumbledore’s white tomb, “and he didn’t really throw it…  I was being insensitive.”
“He murdered her, Moony.”  Potter’s voice is turning dark, full, vivid, and something lurches in Draco’s chest, because for the first time since all this started the man seems to be drawing himself up into something real, as though he’s only been a sketch of himself before now.  He’s an earthquake in the making, in the way that his jaw clenches and his eyes flare brown.  “Peter.  That fucking whoreson bastard –”
“You played?” Potter asks, turning his head.  Draco gets the impression that he’s trying to be polite, and there’s certainly more curiosity than suspicion on his face.  His eyes are almost warm, in their murky colour.
,” Gary mocks, complaining.  “Get off –“  Something more squeaky: a fridge.  “His name’s Harry.  He’s too young for you.  His mother’s stunning,” Gary adds, sounding jealous.  “That’ll be where he gets it from.”
Harry’s dad has been silent since Sirius completed the runes, but he clears the smoke and the flames with a simple, “
,” Harry tells her, turning his knee off the sofa and bubbling up again with something repressed, familial.  “It’s all very well him telling us stories, but the fact is –”
He scores a point, which marks itself out in Lupin’s nod of concession.  Neither of them speaks for a while after that, and the silence is comfortable, long as though they have all day.  It’s clear that neither of them intends to do anything but sit out the hours in this drawing room.  Draco can feel the calm deep in Black’s bones, at odds with the flickering, nervous irritation over the way in Lupin’s fingers.
Nebulously, Harry used to imagine Malfoy and his wife going to bed in nightclothes cut as high as Malfoy’s dress robes in fourth year, stiff and formal with someone flicking a wand at the light.  Now he knows that he takes men to bed, Harry imagines Malfoy waking up relaxed, not wearing a stitch, propping himself on the pillows and nattering, half covered in a sheet and always smirking, conceited, rolling to his back and stretching arms behind his head to witter something sarcastic at the ceiling.
His dad is struggling and suddenly he lurches, pulling Harry forwards.  “Everything you’ve done, Vernon, you fucking
“Mum and Professor Longbottom have always been friends, haven’t they, Dad?” James asks for reassurance, the Friday before the Halloween Hogsmeade weekend.
“This used to be the playroom,” Black is saying, looking around.  “I can’t remember what we called it.  The children’s room?”
The feeling quickly disappears as they make their way out into the hall and up the stairs.  The doors to the drawing room are open, and it’s clear that the two Potters are needling each other again, probably helped along by whatever wine Kreacher wasted on them at dinner.
“I should make you understand,” Draco told him, breathlessly.  Because there was no such thing as straightforward exchange.  Not for Harry Potter.
There isn’t much in the loft – a trunk of ratty clothes and a record player, a modest selection of LPs, all a bit random.  They’ve both forgotten that Andromeda years ago passed Harry the books.
Draco has never asked what happened between his mother and Potter that day in the Hogwarts forest.  Frankly, it’s bizarre to see his mother met by Harry Potter’s rough-and-ready deference, just as it is to see Harry Potter met by his mother’s most private whimsical charm.
Potter, being Potter, smiles awkwardly.  He’s clutching the straps of his backpack and slouching on one leg.  “Nice to see you again, Mrs Malfoy.”
And then Potter’s greeting Lupin with two violent hands on his shoulders, looking at him, clapping down tight and squeezing with visible effort – and it’s something, Draco supposes.
Gradually, Harry’s cuckoo-clock little brain comes to acknowledge that Draco is sitting in a visitor’s chair, not the bed, and in the bed is a man who should by rights be deader than dead.
“Shh,” Harry tells her, nodding to Draco, who’s twitching his nose like a rabbit while Harry strokes his hair.
Looking over his shoulder is a mistake, nonetheless, because James sounds utterly scandalised, as though Harry’s smoking a cigar in his dressing gown, not wearing an easy cotton shirt and trousers that fit, a jumper that Molly didn’t knit him.  “Are you at his right now?”
“You can’t stop me, though, can you?” Harry tells her to be difficult, and they share a grin as she ruffles his hair like his dad.
There’s a pause in chatter from the boy and Mandragora in the corner, here in the hotel living room.
“Don’t – worry, Alfie darling; Mummy’s only getting excited…” she says nervously, distracted, forcing a smile.  She puts her cup in her saucer, kisses her fingers and reaches out her hand as though to bless his forehead through the air.
But Harry kept on murmuring, clear as a bell in their thick cocoon of darkness.  “You’d be in trouble if I did.”  He nipped, kissed, blew.
As predicted, the question itself seems to come as a surprise.  Malfoy frowns, looking down at the food.  “It’s your lunch,” he repeats, like an idiot.
“Good lad,” says Harry’s dad today, and he’s smiling, weirdly, when Harry reacts, his eyes a murky brown-blue.
“He was on the outs with this lot,” Lily supplies for him, nodding towards Lupin and aiming her words at Harry.
Because of his duty to the Nowhere Room, Draco has special leave to apparate in and out of the Ministry building, so he could ignore this problem if he chose.  There is no reason for Draco to stay at home, but he does so nonetheless, in 2008, mostly sleeping, seeing Luna for a couple of hours in the evening, generally avoiding all things Potter and arriving back on Tuesday with everybody else.
“I said that he writes very elegant prose!”  Lupin looks scandalised, and Draco feels it in a sudden surge of panic.  “Merlin above, Padfoot.”
“Did you not look at that,” Draco asks, nodding to the silver on the table, “and think that it could be a risk?”
“I don’t imagine.  I act.”  The words come out of James as though with long practice.  He’s instructing himself, Harry thinks.  “
Teddy has plans, as he has done nearly all summer, to meet up with AJ, AJ’s brother and a mix of their friends at the skate park.  They’re making the most of the long days and they’re all ten or twelve now, keen to be off on their own.
This Thursday morning, as the kettle boils, Draco remembers how at seventeen he cast a wyvern from his wand to protect him.  He knew then, as he’s sure his mother knew, that it was Harry, always Harry.  A mountain lion broken and hardened by life in a cave and tainted by the Dark Lord’s soul, its heavy serpentine magic.  Towards the close of the war it was hopeful, that wyvern: a promise that their hero was something more than a simple beast, something that the Dark Lord could not know.  Narcissa Malfoy was
He’s been gaining insight into the work for the past few years.  The unspeakables report with one voice in these situations, presented through a liaison while Harry speaks for himself.  He feels increasingly suspicious that the liaison might be someone he’s been best friends with since the age of eleven, but he can never remember, once he’s left the room.  The muggles are jovial when he calls them for a meeting; he and they know each other’s names.  The muggles sign contracts instead of making vows; it’s quaint.
“What’s going on over here?” Hermione’s voice then demanded, bright in the darkness, brusque and Hermione-like.  “I can see hugging – why is there hugging?”
him.  He could turn into a rat, and the Manor’s doors were very old, many of them with gaps between their base and the uneven floor, which were of a size that a small creature could just about squeeze through.  No one would know if he was there, or if he was listening, or –
“I’m going to get some food, Professor,” Harry manages, before he turns away from McGonagall and downs his next glass of wine in one.
Draco laughed and stopped pacing, coming to a half a few paces away from where Potter was watching him more intensely than he thought the light turn of the conversation warranted.
Potter leaned down just slightly, that reckless intensity back on his face. “What if I told you that right now, I would go with you anywhere you wanted to take me. If you took me straight to Voldemort, I wouldn’t stop you,” he said, and somehow Draco knew this would be true. Potter played Quidditch like a gambler, sacrificing almost anything—his body, his sanity, his bloody
He looked up at Potter, hovering over him, still tense, arms propped up against Draco’s shoulders. “Why are you doing this?” he said softly.
“And how are you going to do that?” Draco knew he was goading him, but he couldn’t help it. One way or another, he was going out the hospital wing door. Might as well start the process now. He walked toward Potter with purpose, keeping their eyes locked, and Potter stared back, his scowl morphing into something like awe, mouth half open like he might answer.
“Diffindo,” he said, voice stronger, and this time it hurt, this time there was blood. He gasped and clenched his jaw shut as it began to spill over the his arm, began to cover the mark—
Potter shrugged and put his hands in his pockets like they’d started nothing more than a casual conversation.
But the Dark Lord wouldn’t just AK him and be done with it, no, he’d promised him to Greyback, he’d promised an excruciating, degrading death. And his mother would never stand by and let it happen, which means she would die too. Hell, even if Draco succeeded in becoming a bloody corpse on the bathroom floor and the Dark Lord found out it was by his own wand, she might be killed anyway.
“I told you I would help you, and I meant it. Dumbledore will understand, he’ll be able to protect you and your mum, whoever.” He paused, and looked a bit shifty, glancing at Draco’s bare feet, then back up at his face. “Your girlfriend too, if you’d like.”
What if he killed Dumbledore, he allowed the Death Eaters to kill students and teachers, he allowed the insanity to continue because he was too cowardly to do what needed to be done.
He’d become a dangerous, inept creature backed into a corner: striking at random, both desperate for freedom, and slowly realizing its impossibility.
“He’ll have to stay here overnight at least,” Pomfrey was telling Potter, as though she thought he cared. “And the two of you will need to explain all of this to the Headmaster.”
“Not exactly a compelling argument against,” he muttered. Potter glared, hands in his pockets going rigid. “So what, I’m supposed to stay alive, battle my way through this mess, watch people I care about die, so you won’t
Draco had no idea what to say to him. He struggled to sit up straighter, not wanting to be so vulnerable in Potter’s presence.
to be himself, to be a Malfoy. That he deserved it all—the manor, the wealth, the friends, the infamy—because of his blood and his right to rule.
Katie had seen him and his entire body had gone numb with fear. She remembered. She would tell, and they would find everything. It was all over, he’d been caught, he had
He wondered if it was Potter who would find him. Potter, who seemed to be around every corner, watching him, waiting for him to mess up.
Pomfrey was suddenly in front of him, flapping and fussing, and Draco listened to Potter attempt to explain his ‘accident’ as Pomfrey settled him in a bed and waved her wand over the wound. It sewed itself up properly this time. The blood on his arm was dry and sticky. It had gone rusty brown where it had soaked into his white shirt.
“Oh, have we?” Draco said, grinning shakily, unable to leave it alone. He couldn’t quite gauge Potter’s reaction to what had just happened, needed to prod a little to see what he’d do.
Potter looked at him then, his face a bit red. “You think I haven’t? Believe me, I’ve told anyone who will listen that you’ve taken the Dark Mark, that you’re planning something, that you’re dangerous, but they all just keep telling me I’m wrong, that I’m the one whose gone nutty, that I’m obsessed with you an need to just leave it be.”
Because Draco didn’t, was never raised to think of another person's needs, to show them mercy and ‘do the right thing’. And it was Potter’s ‘doing the right thing’, which went against most people’s ideals of a War quickly swept away and forgotten (‘he helped release a Deatheater early!’) and he’d done it anyway, spoke at his trial. And he was mad, really. Couldn’t possibly know Draco would leave and try and do - be - better. He couldn’t.
“I’d like to spend sometime with Scorpius without interference.” Draco curled his fingers away, desperate she wouldn’t say anything about the missing ring. Whether she saw it but decided not to comment, Draco couldn’t be sure.
Looking around the room he spied a few others who’d left their own circles of chatter. He really hated Mrs. Weatherby as she smiled at him from across the room. She was adamant in her old ways and not because they were proper or made sense to anyone but her, but because that’s what worked for her once or twice in the past never mind the coincidental events which led to that. As such she didn’t trust anyone never seen drunk and Draco suspected she knew he’d been nursing the same flute of champagne since the beginning.
Harry made an attempt to open his eyes but didn’t get very far, “I thought you said you could make the Sleeping Draught?”
Well, in usual fashion – a tantrum decades old about the shape of said meals – they’d always been diced up into triangles. Really, Lotty had never been told to stop once she’d started. Having only one slice wouldn’t be too difficult. Harry had seemed hungry too. Good all round really, if only Draco could finish this one.
He choked on the butterbeer he stole from Neville. His night got worse when he spied the curly hair by the bar.
“Thank you.” Siobhan stood, abrupt and gave a short bow, “I’m sorry. I’ll send for my things later in the week. I’ll send a list of other Healers who would be acceptable.” And then she left with no further explanation. Hearing her fast footsteps, Draco waited until she was gone from earshot before he started to talk.
“Wasn’t mine, Mary found ‘im outside a few days ago. Only the cruellest o’ people hurt owls. I didn’t want some sadist running around, y’know?” The old man pointed at Draco and instinctively he puffed up, trying to make himself bigger and in control of this situation. He was not.
And watched the screen unsure on if he should stare and see if Harry replied immediately or not. Was he a slow replier? He flicked back up to see the timestamps.
“Maybe it likes you? I heard it doesn’t let anyone touch it! Except Abbie...” Nathan’s face twitched at the name. “I’m so jealous. Why can’t I give you pets buddy?” Ollie pouted, fell upon the table. Wow. That was dramatic even to his tastes. “Guess you’re the favourite.” It was by no means, not even when Draco was at his most arrogant, could he ever believe the smirk Nathan tried to keep off his face was anything to do with him.
“Think your shirt’s ruined.” Harry put a finger through it and prodded him. The smile didn’t reach his eyes and Draco couldn’t feel any warmth from those hands. It was a hole in his chest and Draco laughed a bitter and petty laugh because how poetically shit this whole thing was?
“I told you, it’s bloody feral!” Collins appeared at the door, using it more as a shield to hide behind. The witch rolled her eyes and Draco returned the scathing look.
Harry tried his best to seem upbeat but as they’d walked off to find a quiet and Muggle-free area to apparate back, he stopped, miserable and guilty.
“When is Scorpius playing?” Draco leaned forward to see the Keepers and Seekers moving off the grounds. How long would this take? How long until someone here noticed him?
“You have a lot of Declarations of Intentions to write, I suggest you start now.” Draco spied what Blaise had taken from his home. Parchment, seal of Malfoy at the top corner, and ink were set up and Draco followed the command without much resistance.
Harry near bristled at the order and Draco could hear how confused and bizzare it sounded to him - he didn’t seem to know much about crups. He knew, Draco could hear the implications he was untrustworthy in every which way.
“Then, the magic before, returns.” The cup overflows and Draco squinted at the sight, “You made an All-Mother, so my guess is you’ve been taking that potion for at least, what, five years?”
As soon as Harry stepped onto the landing, the door which sat off its hinges with rot lit up. White and clean and the rest of the doorway took on a new, more appealing atmosphere. It reminded Draco of the foyer of the Ministry, a polished floor of marble and bright clear lighting overhead. The door opened inwards, a small mercy and they hobbled inside, Harry’s strength waning again and Draco tried to tug him back to his feet as he drooped.
“I didn’t consider she could die,” he started only to pause not sure if Harry would interrupt with platitudes. “She’s been around forever, she’s older than some of the rooms at the Manor. She was stunned, what does that mean? Who delivers a dead body and only stuns the elf that might see them?”
“I don’t provide services for Deatheaters. Suppose I can make an’ exception considerin’ Harry Potter said you saved ‘im an’ all.” Scorpius almost said thank you too before the shopkeeper added, “Double the rate and if you don’t like it, go some place else.” Scorpius looked, as if this was good and wholesome and not someone trying to fill their pocket while trying to feel morally superior. Draco would rather meet Wrek again and hand his extra silvers for delivery of Theo’s note.
Why wasn’t Ginny doing this? Where was she in this? What was this magical emotional mess? Scorpius spoke the truth back at the Manor but Draco’s magic had been on the china plates Astoria both cherished and loathed. He’d broken all but two dessert plates by the time he got a hang of his grief. A plate every few days then weeks, then a month or so, then another.
Draco didn’t need to wait the full hour, but he did. He didn’t need to slip into the same bed where Harry slept, but he did. For one, Harry had hilarious bedhead. Second – and perhaps Draco would acknowledge one day he was being facetious in his thoughts and this really was First priority - he didn’t want Harry to wake up alone and miserable.
“For now,” Harry told Lupin, “I think that I can set up the four of you as complementary to the four of us.  So you’ll be allowed in and out, not really because you’re part of the house, but because you’re an exception to the rule of what doesn’t belong.  If that makes sense.”
Even though he knows it isn’t true, Harry’s stomach drops away.  A huffing laugh escapes from Remus, bitter and flat, and it’s horrible.
Harry shakes his head, feeling in his hands as he holds them up in front of him.  “I’ve not been avoiding anyone,” he complains.  He tries to remember when he last spoke to Draco, and it was this morning, surely, after he’d finished in the bathroom and Draco was dozing and Harry told him to have a nice day at work before he took Lupin’s briefcase and went to work on it in the shed.  “And how is it
Moony is wearing a pair of black trousers and a short-sleeved shirt open at the collar, also black.  He’s wearing sunglasses, no matter that there’s at least an hour until dawn.  His hair looks golden in the firelight, and his face is freckly, more youthful than Harry’s been able to remember.  The set of his jaw is poised and sharp.
He’d caught on about Umbridge, Draco thought.  “I was rather preoccupied in sixth year, as you may recall.”
Lupin is smoking a cigarette, and Harry still means to buy Draco that pint.  The smell is acrid here, near the window.  There’s an odd sort of tall metal teapot, maybe, on the red table, an empty rack for toast and a jar of jam and used plates.  Other things; a newspaper?
“Sometimes I dream that I leave you in the fire,” Harry admits, drinking water, and he’s not sure why he does it.  This isn’t what he dreamt about last night.
He feels like a perv in the morning.  He just really loves his friends.  The war made him weirdly possessive.
Draco falls against him, and his voice is mostly a groan.  “You’re filthy,” he complains, pressing into Harry’s cheek, which is going rough with stubble.  It’s wet with the rain, still rattling down.  He forces a thigh between Harry’s legs.  “Perverted.  We’re in public, Potter.”
It’s true that Harry likes the chaos of the exhibition, every year.  He likes the different rooms, all painted bright colours and filled to the brim with colourful things to look at, floor to ceiling.  He likes that it’s full of people, and that while a good number of the pictures are large and imposing, a greater number are small and approachable, depicting things that he can recognise or words that he can read, or shapes.  Shapes and colours.
“First period’s in five,” her brother says, still an authority, four years older than her.  “You need your books.”
Draco’s laughing, his nose and cheeks a softer pink than the walls, and he’s biting his lip.  “My Lord Mountbatten,” he insists on calling Teddy, supercilious.  “How wonderful to see you.”
in front of their muggle audience.  “My lot,” he adds, pointing out the emeralds.  “The eagles,” he adds, for the sapphires, “and the badgers,” he finishes, pointing at the diamond.  There’s even the slightest earth-yellow tint to it, as though it’s been found brilliant and aged on a woodland floor, rather than mined and cut.
“It’s four o’clock in the morning,” says Draco, and it’s certainly very dark.  Harry chooses to believe him, rolling over, finding a leg, some shorts, nebulous not-so-squashy bits in which to rummage his hand.  “You can sleep for another few hours.”
“Luna says that they’ve got a lot of face, but more depth of heart than most witches or wizards give them credit for.”  Harry liked quoting Luna, as though if he kept repeating what she said it might eventually make sense.  “She and Liz went on a trip for Ollivander…”
“Weird,” Harry corrects.  That sounds more like it.  “But afterwards…  I felt mixed-up and awful, all that spring.  And I came back for the sleeping, didn’t I?  Was never sure if you – but I mean…”
“I can certainly talk to Mr Malfoy,” Harry agrees, aiming for positive reinforcement.  “Mr Malfoy’s a very good friend of mine…”  He glances up unconsciously towards the door, all the books tidy in their shelves on the wall.
“But in any case,” James goes on, almost awkwardly, making Harry reconsider the man’s blasé attitude.  James is holding his beer, fingers wet with condensation.  “It’s not…”  He seems to make a decision.  “It’s a, ah, muggle treatment,” he succeeds in telling George.  “Lily heard about it from her hairdresser.”
“I’ll always love my wife,” Harry accepts, his arms very low on Draco’s back.  “But I convinced myself –”
Scooping beans onto toast, Sirius belted out a laugh.  He was sitting on Harry’s right, as Harry gave in and sat down, right there opposite his dad.  The laugh made Harry’s dad look at his mum, open his mouth and close it again, glance at Harry with a flush of embarrassment in his cheeks.
Malfoy’s lap is covered by the duvet, but he does something squirrelly with his knees as Harry cleans his teeth right in front of him,
This isn’t strictly true, but it’s a good line – and the result is clean silence, prickling and stiff.
He’s talking about Lupin.  He’s talking about what he’s been doing, for thirty-six hours, because his thoughts must have spiralled until he was –
Lupin laughs – a deep, rolling sort of cackle.  The feeling of it seems to have been unexpected.  He looks at Black with stark, bright affection, a glare of winter sun.
And yet it seems to matter to Granger’s boyfriend, which is very strange.  “Oh, come off it,” he tells the man behind the counter.
Draco drifts away as they get into the back and forth.  It goes on for a while, and in the corner of his eye Harry watches his unspeakable slink among groups of people he cannot possibly know.  He likes to piss off the old-guard Slytherin dads, but he’s wearing robes, here at this party, and he fits in.  Posh white wits are welcome anywhere, really, and Draco’s very funny.  Everyone knows that he’s come here with Harry, but this only makes him an entertaining pet.
, but today he can’t quite manage it.  The command is loud in his head as he flicks a finger, walking by.
,” Harry mocks him, a snigger in his nose as Draco whines, working a heel into the bed, shifting so that Harry’s hand has more room between them.  He speeds up.
Harry’s never thought of himself protecting his dad, all the times that he’s shouted at him.  It can’t have been that, to begin with, all the time, can it?
Yet Potter’s voice is argumentative, much stronger than Lupin’s, deep and uncompromising.  “That is not the issue at all, Remus.”  It is very odd indeed to hear the man’s first name.  “You’ve been off with me since the day you got back.”
“Well,” the woman said, glancing at Potter.  “Like I told Harry here the other day, it’s sort of yes, sort of no.”
these things.  And Draco could – he could, that was the thing.  Harry had given him every weapon in the world to cut him to the core.  It would be
James Potter looks back, singularly unimpressed.  “And I know how his curses feel, when he and his disgusting friends are trying to kill me and the people I care about.”
They take drinks upstairs in the drawing room, where the fireplace these days only holds a standard flame.  Downstairs is the parlour; here was once the tapestry of Black.  Now there’s newly purchased muggle wine, in a fresh and fruity style, as well as firewhiskey, because Kreacher knows what they drink.  Harry will arrive downstairs, not here, and Granger will be the one to bring him up.
He’ll have to straighten out the basic facts, Harry supposes, if James and Cassie get married three years from now.  The pay gap will be why he feels guilty for taking Draco out even though he can afford it and for enjoying kedgeree, for shopping on Piccadilly and walking up the Burlington Arcade.  Some of that might be fixed eventually, along with the rest of it, if the Ministry group gets the guidance right.  There’ll be fits and starts of radical action, led by the kids’ generation.
“Merlin, it’s hot,” Harry says to himself, surprised, his muscles aching as he slips from the broom.  There are lights in the distance and the headlamp of Sirius’s bike is beaming bright as he descends; Harry has to squint as it blinds him, trainers sinking into sand.  Above him there are hundreds of stars.
“Are you dating Cousin Draco?” Teddy asks him sceptically, still living in number 12 by the final week of January.  He’s in and out so much, it’s more like having a pet than a child; he hasn’t been in quarantine again.  Harry’s often thought that he’d like to get a dog.  “Do I need to sit you both down and talk about commitment?”
“Doesn’t he live in your house?” Neville asks now, confused, in an accent which Harry never hears otherwise.
“It would have been a bloody cheat,” Harry said, focusing on Draco’s face, his eyes and chin, green eyes clearly emeralds.  “A bloody bastard cheat, to try and force something with my best mate’s sister, all because what I really wanted was for him and my other best friend to let me
For a moment, no one says anything, and Harry thinks that he’s made his point, nodding and picking up his wine for a swallow.  There’s the sound of the dishwasher, which is supposedly more water-efficient than spelling the crockery to scrub.  The TV’s quiet, away in the other room.
“Fire jars are holding up,” he said, acknowledging Draco before he swept an arm around Granger’s shoulders and took in the cake, which read,
The children see Luna more often than Harry does.  He should write to her, he thinks, though he’s not sure how to apologise the way that he’d like.
It was an easy solution, barely discussed.  Neither of them was clever when it came to hiding places, and both of them trusted McGonagall.  Potter was offered work for September, and the resurrection stone was hidden in plain sight.  They met in Draco’s room at the Broomsticks and brought each other off again, took dinner, spent the night apart and made their way back to London in the morning.
“It’s a party for Harry and Ginny,” Granger explained, and Draco immediately felt mortified.  Harry and Ginny.  Of course.  “It’s their birthdays,” she added, making it worse.  “Harry’s is today, though I expect he didn’t mention it – he never does anymore – and they’re both moving jobs.”
It had been a little funny, but not so much that Draco could remember it.  He didn’t laugh, instead crossing eyes with Granger’s boyfriend.  The man nodded over his pint as if to say,
Now, arriving through the downstairs floo and faced with something that he can’t shut his eyes to, Granger’s boyfriend is not coping well.
Harry interrupts him.  “Albus Severus, be quiet,” he says, hearing violence in his voice.  It’s all he’s ever managed, this audible violence, but his son goes bright red and shuts up.
“I’m not the one saying so,” Draco remarked, an odd look in his grey eyes, so close where his face leaned over Harry’s.  His energy is never warm, but it was unquestionably urgent right then, like a predator ready to pounce.
This sounds sensible, Harry thinks, barely blinking at the idea of Ginny having somewhere that’s hers.  He’s seen it once, now.  He writes an explanation to Draco(!) immediately, because they have unspoken plans – but something stays his hand before he can give the note to his loyal friend Spearow the eagle owl, as named by Lily.
don’t care,” Draco points out, charming the water, coffee and cafetière with absent thought.  If his mother could see him now, he thinks, after all the times she’d speculate that he would never cope without an elf.
“Of course, Master Harry,” Kreacher, affronted, insists.  He would insist on this whether they had things in or not.  “And there is beer.”  This at least is true.  There’s always beer in the house, these days.
“Do you remember how you were feeling,” Draco took another tack, hiding the old Mark back against his jeans, “when you were shopping that day?”
“Sorry,” Potter replies, as though unnerved.  He glances Draco’s way another few times as they move on again.  “I didn’t…  I can’t summon the hate for the Killing Curse anyway.”
Lily Potter rolls her eyes.  “Well, then we had Flitters and Pomona, who spent most of their time getting squiffy, and they thought that we didn’t know.  Meanwhile, McGonagall was as soft as a teddy bear, so no one took her seriously.  Saw us all as her babbies.”
It didn’t help that Harry’s tone seemed to be water off a duck’s back.  “You’ve been with that Malfoy for, what, five years now?” Sirius accused.  “Don’t you think that it’s about time –”
“He doesn’t think that,” Harry assures his son.  “He thinks I’m aces.”  He thinks better of Harry than Harry thinks of himself, he gets the impression, or maybe just that he’s better than him.  Harry doesn’t think that this is how it works.
“Yes,” says James shortly, and it makes no sense at all.  “I fear that Minerva may have learned her lesson about letting me into her office, or I’m not sure I would…”
Lupin blinked, as though he hadn’t been paying attention.  “I’m sure that it doesn’t matter whether or not I understand,” he said diplomatically, not at all like a teacher, and it made Harry frown.  “As long as the outcome’s there.  You’ll act as the key which lets in James…”
Harry imagines it.  He lets himself imagine it.  Nothing will change, and Ron and Hermione will get married just as happily somewhere else.  His mum and dad will find another place to live.
“You’re in the wrong career for pragmatics, son,” says Vespers, a joke in the twitch of her lips.  “Appeal to one of the popular fudges, if you want my advice...  Though it’s true that the world could use a new piece on apparition, if the spirit moves.”
“Draco!” Harry shouts, in such a state that it’s embarrassing.  He catches Draco’s eye and the words pour out.  “Are you – your
Part of Harry which can only be disturbed by hard violence accepts that this demonstrates, in the end, that Teddy’s mature for his age and that he likely could’ve coped with starting Hogwarts this year.  This was what Andromeda meant about Teddy getting distracted, because the Statute is only going to pinch harder, as everyone in his class starts talking about their next school.
Ron and Hermione don’t ask him where he’s been, but Harry supposes that the match could have gone on until two.
Frowning harder, Harry traces Draco’s scar of the M25 under his fingers, a wobbly spider-legged loop.  It’s beautiful because it’s his, and his own scars are only what make him.  He thinks of Draco’s iPhone, what it will have taken to create it and then for it to end up in his hand.  “I think that we have more control over this world than we like to pretend,” Harry reflects, glancing up and finding himself drawn in for a kiss, Draco’s nose nudging into his.  “I think that we have less.  And I think that I fucked up my marriage,” he concludes.
He knows it isn’t true, but Harry says it anyway, if only to wind Draco up and maybe snap him out of his mood.  He can’t cuddle him or cast spells on him; he’s driving a car.
,” she adds, looking up.  “I’m rather fond of Ron, really, in the end.”  She admits this as though it’s embarrassing.  “We’ve been together a long time.”
Ginny’s wedding made headlines.  It took place at the Hogsmeade Grand – the oldest hotel outside the village, once the residence of a Hufflepuff descendant.  Everything was classic in design.  Picturesque.
Stalking by Harry’s desk and circling, the wolf is keeping low to the office’s flagstones, never holding its head high.  It would be willing to send a message, Harry thinks – to check with Luna that Malfoy’s with her and Ollivander and that he’ll be safe, here in this castle.  Protected.  At least on this day.
First, he banishes and summons the coins from Black’s pouch, rolling them around the platform just to be sure, and then he vanishes the iron hoop as well, every grain of salt from the scorched lower step, still not entirely sure that he trusts himself to walk on the platform, not that he ever does, or ever would, or ever really understands why it’s there.
He must have sent a patronus too, Harry thinks.  He must have sent a dozen.  He looks a lot like a poser in his black t-shirt and his black leather jacket, his sunglasses glinting in starlight.  He’s crossed his arms and is sitting back against his saddle, hair swooping around his ears, tousled by the wind.  The bike is grumbling a little, cooling down from the journey and spitting interruptions to the beam of its headlamp.
“He said that we should go out,” Harry informs them.  Repeating the words, he realises how they sound.  “Not like that,” he corrects, because he’s sure.
“What?” Harry asks, looking too.  There’s no way that James is suggesting…  The amount of patience it would take, to work out the pattern; the intuition, to know where to start –
Around these fixed points, the rest of Harry’s dad’s day is filled with various things, mostly inconsequential.  If he’s doing anything to investigate Lupin’s disappearance, then Harry can’t work out what it is – which is odd, Harry thinks, because he sounded so adamant in the cemetery.
Swallowing his nerves, Harry moves to distraction.  “Why’d you put that one there?” he allows himself to ask.
Luna shook her head, shuffling over to encourage Draco’s head down to her shoulder.  “He doesn’t realise that his cousin feels that way,” she said.  “It’s very complicated.”
Harry hasn’t used the resurrection stone on Draco, Draco reminds himself, and he shouldn’t use it ever again, because the thing is powerful beyond the telling.  The elder wand lies buried.  And so even if Draco knows the theory, there is very little chance that he would be able to find his way out the veil if he fell inside.  He
She sniffed, now, Luna, her slender hand shaking as she stroked Draco’s face, the reverse of her fingers against his cheek and her thumb tracing his eyebrow.  The ice in her eyes was cracking as she fissured.
“I think that you look very nice, Harry,” says Hermione earnestly, and it’s going to make Harry cry.  “Are you thinking about a change in look?”
As he leaves, his eyes meet Potter’s uncanny hazel frown.  The man is thinking something, but Draco can’t read what it is.
“Is everyone paying attention?” demands Harry’s dad, bopping Harry on the head with his wand.  He feels it with a jolt, his dad’s magic, the rooted strength of its mahogany and the stubborn fight of its dragon core, the heartstring of a Hebridean Black.
They’re staring at each other, and again Harry wonders how they ever got away with it.  He can’t read the look that they’re sharing, but he isn’t sure that he wants to.  It’s like something from a painting.
There are wall mirrors, two of them.  Large and round and yet able to stretch free of the leather bag, which was made for this.  The mirrors have different frames, one thin in soaped ash and one gilt, wrought in a filigree pattern of needles and pinecones, which took Harry ages to cast.  The charms are finished; they’re linked.  He made them in time for Malfoy’s birthday.
In Harry’s office, now, his speech is lying under his hands, unrolled on the desk, and none of the words are going in.  It’s ten minutes long, by Harry’s estimation, and there’s half an hour before he’s due to head outside.  That’s more than enough time to practise once through and reflect.
“I should be going too.”  Draco forces the words from his mouth, diverting the conversation.  He stands, catching sight of himself in one of the mirrors.  He’s an embarrassment, his face drawn and his hair flat, a touch of stubble like glitter around his lips and his jaw.  His robes are solid, flat black, and they leave him as a floating head and hands.  “Bye all.”
And the thing is, Harry thinks later, lying in bed and waiting for Draco to come home, pretending to be asleep – he couldn’t apologise tonight if he wanted to.  Mrs Figg gave him a memory, and he thinks that it might finish off his understanding of 1995.  Tonight’s the last chance he’ll have before October, most likely, to break into Draco’s office and borrow his pensieve.
.  Much more mundane than this mouth, one of Harry’s hands is finding strength to smooth down his front, pull his dressing gown apart and take a grip high on his thigh.  Draco’s muscle jerks, and the hand swerves to reach between his legs, fumbling over the stretching fabric of his shorts.  His touch is slightly tentative, which it shouldn’t be, Draco thinks, and it’s then that Draco remembers.
Caught up in it all, Draco’s eyes closed shut.  It had just gone Christmas with as little ceremony as always, now well into Boxing Day evening.  These were the dark hours: too early for bedtime, and yet everyone’s hangovers were making them hurt and the high of Christmas Day was well and truly sunk.  Draco had been a little down himself, but then he’d received a visitor and now he was caught in a storm.  He didn’t know what he was feeling.
Why are you awake? Harry wanted to ask the man next to him, early in the morning on Sunday the fourth of May.
“He’s fifteen; we’ll forgive him,” James dismisses with a roll of his eyes.  “The facts are these,” he moves on.  “Even if I wouldn’t have castrated you with a big sharp knife from there beyond the veil, the pair of you are too similar and your eyes are turned in other ways.  I don’t know where you go,” he carries on without a breath, “when Moony’s crying
But it’s Justin Finch-Fletchley, with remarkable stamina, who points out the obvious.  “Isn’t this when we take the survivors’ photo?”
The sound of this voice makes Harry’s insides shrivel tight.  He glances at James, who is looking at the handset, surprised, and Harry thinks that he recognises the voice as well as Harry does.
He was at the age when this happened, Teddy, Draco knew.  His magic would be coalescing into something that would form his core, shape his soul and allow his wand to find him.  Ollivander had explained it all once in the cellar of Malfoy Manor.  Draco couldn’t remember the details.
“Oh, sorry,” Sirius tells him, giving himself away with a smirk.  His tone barely changes.  “I thought that you were keeping up.  I’m currently playing the Sirius Black who lives in Moony’s head.”
“I encourage my son to express polite interest in the lives of those he associates with,” Draco keeps talking while Harry scuffs up his hair, so annoyed.  Draco’s explaining, his eyes sharp and his elbows even sharper as he tucks his wand away.  “That includes me.”
The tea that Granger has ritually made, after all, is perfectly warm and milky and comforting.  Draco hates every sip, suppressing the shivers that run to the ends of his fingers.  It’s been days, and yet Granger is here, with her tea.  It’s been days; she should have let it go.
“Your fucking shit wooing is going to take us ten years,” Draco murmurs, kissing Harry softly on the lips.
Harry looks around them, at the way back to the castle and the forest, both eerie in moonlight.  There’s the sound of owls hooting, hunting, rustling trees.  “I’m talking to you,” he tells Sirius, because there’s no one else here besides Buckbeak, who’s focused on the grass.
On Harry’s other side, past Ginny, Neville has turned around in his seat, offering Oliver a brown paper bag of something like liquorice to suck on, given how he’s turned slightly pink.
At the mild sound of this voice, Harry jumped, his quill splatting ink in three dots across his work.
Draco picks up the eyelets, and they’re cold in his hand.  He apparates to his office, because apparating to the veil room is a foolish, foolish thing to do, and the eyelets come there with him.  He runs into Granger on their shared little landing, and she looks at him as though she wants to ask a question.  It seems to be late afternoon.
It makes Harry laugh, quite suddenly and quite urgently, out loud, even as his heart turns over itself.
Kreacher’s informed him that Granger and her boyfriend are holed up in the library, both just returned from work, so Draco treads cautiously up the stairs to the sound of voices.  He pauses on the landing.
,” Pansy repeats, appearing to choke on the word, leaning forward, her eyes blinking with incredulity.
It shouldn’t have taken all evening, but of course their hero had eventually started defending the no-hopers, drinks leading him into trailing anecdotes about what they’d been up to or how they’d helped him out with something, blah blah blah blah blah.  Did Draco
“Nicolas Flamel lived for seven hundred years,” Draco says bluntly, sitting up straighter.  “How is that fair?”  It’s simply – annoying, what Harry is saying.  “How is that fair unless there is no fairness, and it is all of it magic, for want of a better term?”
She didn’t flinch but she took a breath and Draco knew he needed to stop her from alerting the rest of the family. “Then we should all--”
He heard Harry apparate, he’d regret what was said and done tomorrow. He didn’t wait to hear Harry’s return, he immediately wrapped the majority of the covers around him and tried his best to have no more thoughts. He’d like to sleep and taking a deep breath, he wondered if it was ever going to be possible to give Harry what he wanted.
“Now, puffs, hurry up.” Draco shooed him away with shaky hands, unlike Potter he did not have any available funds for Muggle activities. Harry laughed and leaving Draco to swear under his breath as he left. It wasn’t possible, it wasn’t right for Muggles to come up with this ‘fashion’.
Blaise peeked his head out. “Thank Merlin.” Draco didn’t understand. He felt cold, colder than being thrown into a bath which water had yet to be heated. Blaise spoke but Draco didn’t want to hear the words, his head splitting at every sound. Harry was here, wasn’t he? He could feel the wards highlight his presence and then three others popped up and Draco groaned at them.
Their eyes met and Harry came over and Draco couldn’t handle more spouting lies-- Neville stormed over. With noticeably more energy than Draco had ever seen of him.
“The rumours of you and Pansy came out quite quickly, didn’t they?” Which from the perspective of the secretive Twenty-Eight, was a feat, a terrible feat which Blaise should loathe and try and stop. “And Nott didn’t seem at all worried over what that’d say about him. In fact I’m pretty sure his words were along the lines of: ‘Pansy could be shagged by a centaur for all I care’, that’s an odd thing to say about your wife involved in scandal. Wouldn’t you say so?”
James scrambled to his feet, veins popping in his face. Unlike what Draco expected, his rage was directed at Harry.
Oh. No. Of course not. Draco had only ever mentioned specific details to Matthews to explain, to reveal the chills and trembling whenever Draco didn’t rest well. He had to write what happened down? No. He didn’t want to do that, to have whatever Auror wanted to simply wander in and read it like a gossip rag. To comb through it as if Draco was lying or the one at fault.
“After her actions I trust Siobhan as much as I would a manticore with a lamb.” Not to say that Harry was the lamb, Draco gulped. Awake he clearly held the same attention most gave him wherever he went. Goven hadn’t been so nice to Draco and he was the one paying her. She was professional in that she wouldn’t let Harry die - and that was all Draco had to rely on. Notwithstanding her lying to try and score points and prestige were irrelevant.
“You’re already involved,” Harry parroted back and Draco couldn’t see how this was the end. How Theo was going to bargain his way out of this and use Blaise as a chip.
“Oh, making yourself something.” Harry yawned and finally Draco managed to fight the pull of sleep to open his eyes and spy him leaning against the wall much like he’d done before. He was in clothing - day clothes that buttoned up and Draco wondered if Harry had been awake for a time and was simply waiting till Draco left his room.
Maybe Draco meant that a little more than he’d care to really say. How many times had the authorities tried to lift Scorpius and blame him, argue with Draco that it was all Malfoy’s fault. Everything was always his fault. Hell, Potter even took Albus away from Scorpius - not even the precious merciful Saviour of the bloody Wizarding World could look passed the possibility Scorpius or himself was evil. A tainted family that corrupted absolutely.
Scorpius didn’t take the bait nor did he leave. The problem persisted until well after lunch where a FireCall from Albus had him disappear nearly immediately. Good. If Draco had to stay sitting up all proper his stomach was going to fall out.
I'll probably do some editing and double checking of earlier stuff tomorrow, maybe clean up some typos and wording but two chapters up the now to tide you over till then. <3 Funnily enough it is almost done in terms of chapters... but the next chapter is roughly 12K words long. ;d I shall see you lovely people tomorrow at some point.
Granger tried again, calling him and talking about how she’ll write a letter he could deliver - and Draco had to wonder how many owls were happy with the sheer expectation of flying around. He missed it terribly and he wasn’t born a bird. Just a coward.
He’d head to one of the balconies and return home. The summons were completed. No point in making this an entire night. Apparation impossible within the house’s influence. Could he escape on wings? Going to the Floo this early would just highlight who left early. Slow and steady, he would leave everyone’s sight and escape without notice.
“You’re--” Draco couldn’t do it any longer. To hold back the laughter, a bubbling aching laughter that cramped at his stomach and his face and Harry slumped forward, another battering of knees together and he heard him sigh in such relief that he laughed too, “I thought you were being serious.” He hid behind his hands again, embarrassed and giddy.
She smiled at him as she pushed away a blinding hair from her face. And when Draco blinked, she was gone and Draco was left holding onto the air. She was still gone.
“Don’t tempt me.” James didn’t manage to pull away from the iron grip on his wrist. Perhaps now he’d know Draco wasn’t some old man who was surrounded by money without any way to defend himself. “I couldn’t care less of your accusations, but don’t make my son the bearer of my mistakes. Understood?”
The silence droned that horrid way that even the scratch of fabric against each other sounded too loud.
“Just give him some time. He’s got your back. We always do but he’s not--” She flourished her words with a heavier sigh, “He’s not happy about it.”
When Harry started to lower his hands from his back - and it had nothing to do with Draco’s now absence of tears or his calmed breathing after the fact - Draco panicked.
Fine. They should. It took some time, a self-conscious nightmare as Harry seemed to watch whatever tiny movement Draco made.
It wasn’t the silence between two people who were sharing an experience or comfy within the quiet itself, just a confining tension in the air as Draco could only hope Harry calmed from his denial.
“Human form only.” Human form only? Another hoot and Harry set him down. Throwing the Snitch back into play.
Even if Albus was another person’s kid, he was still one of the very few people Draco was more than cordial with - the boy had ended up in his house for entire summers, chatted at length over a topic no one else seemed interested in. And even to Albus he still didn’t deserve a second chance.
“The hole in my roof says otherwise.” Harry scoffed, was about to open his mouth and probably be combative, say whatever impulsive thing he had in his head and Draco refused it. He bet him to the new topic. “How about this arrangement? I’ll make your Sleeping Draughts without any ingredients that would prolong your lack of control.”
I have no idea how AO3 works with alerts, so if I happened to spam anyone when I was tweaking the previous chapters earlier, I am so sorry. It didn't occur to me it might happen till after. Anyway, edited a bit of the older chapters from typos and such. Once it's complete I'll do another comb for stuff.
Scary how it became habit, to leave the Manor so often. To see Matthews, and talk. To see the Ministry without its glares and whispers and pettiness directed at him. In a flurry of style and exhausting flair, he delivered the newly made potions to Harry in shrieks and by wings. Collins’ jumped at the sight of him every time.
“Blaise.” Draco tried not to remember Harry assumed him as the culprit. It was a strange, weighty and yet hollow coldness which lay in the centre of his heart. Blaise couldn’t do this because they’d been friends for a while; he was one of the only classmates to come to Astoria’s funeral. Why would Blaise turn on him now? What could possibly cause Harry’s doubt – unless it was jealousy?
“Everything went well then?” He pocketed the galleon and watched as Luna laughed, outright and loud.
Oh, Merlin. Shutting his eyes, Draco cursed. Ginny. She was only through this doorway and she'd send him a slew of Hexes and Jinxes if this ever reached her.
“Date.” Harry corrected, “He’s my date.” An apology was sent his way in the form of a pale face and a touch of panic. One Draco dismissed because it wasn’t necessary, not yet. Out of the two of them Harry was the one most uncomfortable.
It was fine. He would tell Harry to piss off. Look down on him and feel nothing. He opened the door, in a fake rage he couldn’t quite pull off.
- not hair. How was this supposed to dry him? He eyed the metal cylinder with the handle. Harry too, looked over it carefully.
Draco hummed, didn’t want to say anything a nearby pixie might use against him. “Why did you have Nott’s cloak?”
“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” Not wanting to bask under Harry’s smug grin Draco scanned around the room. Where there were several Muggles - and wow, did Muggles have naturally green coloured hair - and what was that in her face - and Draco was certain he wasn’t sure what a Muggle and he, a pureblood could possibly enjoy together. They were separated for a reason. Magic was not known to them for a reason.
“That’s all?” He scowled at the blonde Healer who seemed to sink lower. “Really? Is she fine?” Using the bed’s cover as a giant tissue, Lotty sneezed and blew her nose into it the Healer didn’t seem fussed. A cleaning spell out of her mouth before Draco could tell Lotty to stop.
“You can’t even walk,” Draco snapped back and stood up straight, off to the balcony where the ballroom itself would help carry a voice without the need of magic. Harry had managed to walk two steps, before he’d clung onto Draco’s arm. He was pleading and it made Draco’s blood boil.
And Draco still hadn’t a clue as to what was so funny to warrant the attention. In cruel response, Harry hadn’t mentioned it again. Draco was bound to never utter the question, not unless he wanted to tell Potter how often his gaze created such a self-conscious and embarrassed mess underneath the Malfoy scowl.
Oh. Right. The Real Reason. Draco was slow to open up, going so far as to introduce the Rings of Celius first, noting they were destroyed as the first fact about them. And draco would pepper his answers, jumping back and forward in time of his life - from Hogwarts, back to going to the Quidditch match and feeling unsafe - then back to Blaise and Theo.
He left Harry to himself, keeping his back to him giving the smallest bit of privacy he could muster. This was all his fault. Now, Harry was going to admit this was the moment he knew his feelings weren’t real. Whatever was in that file had truly messed Harry Potter up, more than any dragonblood could. The Boy Who’d Lived (and Died) was scared and Draco hadn’t ever seen that before.  He’d fought Voldemort - and this, whatever was there - was what he was having a panic attack over.
Draco decided to cut the day short only because Harry himself apparently wanted to eat his weight in hot dogs and the most horrid pink stuff ever created.
Harry was on his way downstairs - those took him a little while, and Draco paused in his half-rabbit half-dragon attempt. He hadn’t seemed to take the stairs often, even at the party. Probably not strong enough to rushup and down them just yet. When he started moving again, Draco returned to blacking out the fur and pushing the worry out of his head with each haphazard stroke.
Draco’s sauce burned, smoked the air in a series of unknown herbs and spices. All it did was make Draco cough and move away. Without his magic he allowed Neville to take the lead in wafting the air and mentioning, “You’re shit at making this one.”
He scratched at his neck. “We could go see a movie. Bet you haven’t had popcorn in ages.” Draco’s smile faltered. This, this was dangerous. Dangerous in how easy it was to slip back into talking, pulling and pushing.
“Please, that’s my job.” But Scorpius’ face just soured and he bit at the corners of his nails. Draco didn’t need much to read him. “What do you want to say? Go on then, let’s hear it.”
“Don’t forget. This was a favour to Albus.” Draco fled, apparated directly to his kitchen, a snivelling Lotty asking for forgiveness for allowing Harry Potter to come into the Manor again.
“Fuck,” Harry sighed as he dropped back onto the bed next to him. “I’ve wanted to do that for a while.” When Draco was still reeling, Harry snuggled into him. “Is everything okay?”
“I just want to sleep.” When Draco almost said how he would take care of it – how he’d take care of him, Draco shut his mouth. “I don’t think the Healer meant this when he spoke about motivation.”
It couldn’t be seen as good, polite even as Draco’s defences were already on high alert. If first impressions mattered to this Healer Matthews, Draco was as good as gone as his first instinct was to ruffle feathers and goad. “Would you want to be called Healer Matthews or Marvin,” he drawled.
Tentative was what Draco would call it as Harry stepped into the bathroom fully and the door shut behind him and Draco wondered if he was right. If this was just Harry facing his fears like a good little Gryffindor.
And, next chapter has so much going on? Urgh it's gonna be so much fun to write! It'll be a monster chapter. (Spoiler/Hint: Harry isn't so subtle now).
Lying could backfire here. Especially if it were an eagle. That would make Draco look dumb. He sidestepped the question. Looked away. Harry caught it like a Snitch.
“Gryffindor would suit her better.” Harry sniped over her head and Luna sighed, in a dreamy way she was in the habit of that made Draco always wonder what she was thinking.
What Draco really wanted was—The game had continued on. And Harry didn’t so much as glance in his direction. No, he chatted with Ginny and Draco scowled. Another few rounds, some opting out if they hadn’t finished their drinks. Draco refused to join in at any point now. Luna was just making things up as she went but Draco couldn’t remember her losing any Whispers.
“I’m surprised you aren’t off to the Prophet to indulge them.” Draco rubbed at his wet, itchy face, only to realise his mistake. No point in being subtle in this any more, Draco wiped at his eyes and made no attempts to engage in any conversation. Blaise didn’t catch on.
And Harry just seemed quite happy to leave it at that. At least he hadn't ruined anything last night.
“At least you bought a decent suit.” Draco was back on the crowds watching them mingle, seeing who went to who and who ignored who. A small saving of face, that wasn’t too much. His attempt to ease Potter backfired and the smile fell.
Harry didn’t reply and Draco was relieved and anxious all over again. At least Lotty was simply stunned and nothing more. Meanwhile, Harry seemed to be writing more than he was reading. When the room grew too warm, Draco left deciding to brew some potions and Harry left him to it.
“Exactly. Good. We can go tomorrow.” He wiped his hands on his trousers before stretching up to the banister and hauling himself up to his feet. Despite the effort needed, the way veins raised under his skin Draco didn’t help, didn’t offer a hand because he was certain Harry didn’t actually want help. He’d sulked and bickered and hated how he hadn’t walked up those stairs to the lab before.
Blaise grabbed onto him, ready to apparate and Draco yanked his arm back. “I need to get the laboratory.”
Watching the duel was Harry and the two boys – a more timid Scorpius who had chosen to crouch down and watch through the spaces in the half wall meanwhile Albus stood, scowling. Since Harry was allowing this, Draco had to admit he wasn’t sure if Harry was using this as a test or not, he decided to play nice.
This was the best time to leave. Just before the silence returned. Draco did have a busy schedule today and to lower suspicions, he left again on his wings. He needed to Floo to Theo’s. Apparation might point that he was not in the Manor to use that Floo line which would raise the question: where was he?
The three of them spent time together – mainly Luna chatting about things Draco didn’t know and Harry hadn’t heard of – and sipping at tea. Luna never asked further on the lack of long-winded letters. Harry left after a Howler from Hermione arrived and chased him back to the office. Draco returned home later.
It was quite disgusting, raw, pink skin ripped and scarred in several wave-like patterns around the location the spell had hit. Five strange white blobs sat on the edges, like a young Scorpius trying to draw a series of triangles. Giving them a prod wasn’t painful, not nearly as much as Draco would think looking at the damage.
“What’s wrong with the house?” Scorpius asked, looking around the ceiling. Doing his best to leave out the fact it taken a day and a half for him to return. Draco ignored the urge to scold him there and then.
And nothing would soothe his raw nerves or shield him from how exposed that realisation made him. He’d lie forever. Because if he didn’t then that only meant that his parents were--He loved them. That’s all he had to acknowledge. That’s all anyone had to know. Harry didn’t make it easier on him - did he ever? - and Draco debated on whether he could dismiss himself without making it obvious as to why.
His revelation came in the form of Harry trying to keep to his side of the bed - he flinched away when his foot dared to tap at Draco’s shin. If Draco hadn’t seen the pattern before, he’d have been offended. The mattress shifted under him as he turned over and Draco tried to make out some details of the room. Only the black blob of Harry’s hair, the greys and whites of the covers and-- Harry turned around too, too close - too close - his hair tickling at Draco's neck and chin.
“Yes, Sir. Excuse me.” Abbie did not look pleased as she retreated back to a cubicle. No one ever looked happy in the Ministry so a moot point but this atmosphere was closer to working near Umbridge than a celebrity. Harry shut the door, leaving Draco to check to see if Potter was going to start yelling in private.
It wasn’t just Scorpius who flinched, Draco did too because he knew too. If Scorpius hadn’t opened up to Blaise, didn’t allow him such easy access to the Manor then It was probable Blaise never would have managed to find the Rings of Celius. And when Scorpius turned to see if Draco would reject what he was saying, well, Draco wouldn’t even if he wasn’t under the spell of agreeing with whatever Blaise wished. If Draco was lucky, Scorpius would take his silence as Blaise keeping him quiet and look no further into it.
Sighing throughout the house, Draco wasn’t sure if he should return it to his finger. Not until this blanket of guilt removed itself from his head. What was he doing? What did he really think would happen? Realistically? Nothing could come of this, nothing public.
Harry pulled it back, more water spilling, raised his above his head about to-- “So, I could break--” No! Draco reached out to grab it, his height making it easy to have a hand on it despite Harry’s attempts. Harry grinned and Draco deflated. Oh no. No, he hadn’t meant to-- Caught. Completely. This was it, this was how he died. Into a pool of ever rising embarrassment.
“--The radial artery, as low down in your arm as we can manage it. I’ll be adding a tourniquet to make sure you don’t bleed out. You’ll have to be awake to take any Blood-Replenishing Potions, any other questions?”
Oh. Right. And Harry glanced around, craning his neck to look behind Draco. What was he expecting? Draco hadn’t brought anyone, he hadn’t even meant to bring Hermione unless someone was coming? Draco glanced back-- warm fingers tingled at his neck and he turned back as Harry kissed him. Chaste and quick and enough to stop Draco from ever breathing again.
Draco saw it, the curiosity on Harry’s face as he glanced down and desperately, he hadn’t enough time to stop Harry picking up the poor attempts at writing on the table. “Wait.”
“I understand the sacrifices and I appreciate all that you’ve done Mr. Potter but I cannot let Draco Malfoy or any Malfoy near our creatures. Please understand it’s for the safety of everyone.”
Relief was a strange emotion. It implied the worst was going to happen, in this case, Draco was going to be tossed aside. That wasn’t an unfair thought when he’d caused such distress. Draco would leave himself, distance and make sure not to encounter someone like him. So, when Harry did pat at the crown of his head and Draco chirped again because - what? - and Harry sniffled a little more and Draco settled in the end, on Harry’s slumped shoulder he was relieved. Harry wasn’t crying but it might have been a near thing, especially as Draco was greeted in return with a scratch.
No matter how hypocritical he might be, distracting and wanting Harry to leave his work after admonishing him earlier for not trying hard enough gave him pause.
“Fine.” Draco stood away from the door, clenched his hand tight because there was no way it was going to allow him to remove it. This one liked to dig in and as much as the teeth were small and sharp, the ring itself would tighten and cause more damage in the long run. Astoria’s mother was adamant to check it every time they met and his hand was always flawless - of course it was - and no scars or quick healing magic used. “Take the specs off.”
“Could you repeat that?” Draco narrowed his eyes at both Harry and his mother on the opposite sofa. What could they possibly be up to? The both of them weren’t on the greatest terms, not after Scorpius and Draco had ran back to France. And here they were, drinking tea and the form which they alluded to covered up in the middle of the table with more parchment.
“Right. I see.” Matthews glanced between the silence that sat between them. He cleared his throat. “Personally, I find it quite odd. How you both bicker about Hogwarts and yet don’t talk about the later years. I am aware Draco had more than some hardships at that point.”
They’d never said goodbye, never avoided one another for a year, never quelled the urges and wants. Draco just tried to keep up, huffing out held breaths and pulling clothes. All tangled limbs, where Draco could never move again. And Draco slipped a hand, his long fingers down Harry’s side, skin as blazing hot as he remembered.
Really, it would be nice, to have someone… someone else to share the time left now Scorpius was out of sight. Draco Malfoy had a lot of time and potions weren’t engaging conversationalists. He sighed. No more thinking, damn it.
It was only when Scorpius fell back Draco could hear them whispering again. The same paranoia reminded him of the time they’d charmed hedges to scare the press that sat outside the Manor one year. Whispering was never good when it came to the both of them.
“Seriously? What’d he do? Don’t tell me he’s back into the whole betting shtick?” The grin, which usually had Draco follow suit twisted his insides up this time. What a mess, Harry shouldn’t have said anything. Draco shouldn’t have asked for his opinion. This doubt was too much.
“About Blaise and Theo’s grand plan? Me being sold to the highest bidder for marriage? The whole reason I haven’t been here?”
The mishmash of emotion in Draco’s head was nearly enough to make him pass out. His own anger seemed indistinguishable from Blaise’s, was he mad at Nott? Was Blaise? Whose emotions were these?
An uppity pureblood? Had his reputation dwindled so much he now didn’t strike even a hint of dread? The next time he was pulled in for an interview; witness or otherwise he would make it easier to pull blood from a dragon.
Draco rubbed his face again, “Just go over there and stay.” He pointed to the fence that intersected the fields, the outside, by the roadside, was hedgerows. Potter hopped up and sat on the fence. Deciding on caution, Draco moved another few paces away, and decided to ignore the chirpy Potter. Morning people were the worst followed close by the well-rested.
This was nice timing too with only a week - six days now, to the party, it might give some others a change of heart and come along even if it was just to snoop at where Astoria Malfoy lived.
He made it halfway down the hall before stopping. What if he was asleep, a rarity for him, and Draco woke him up - for what? Draco lingered for a moment. He didn’t really know what he wanted Harry to do or say, what he wanted to do or say to Harry. What could Harry hope to do that Draco couldn’t do himself? Nothing. He returned to his bedroom, got into bed and stared back at the jewellery box.
“He’s not doing well again?” She busied herself making some coffee, though the speed she did it at made Draco wonder if she felt as awkward standing there as he did.
What occured after was Harry talking into the box, a feat Draco was aware happened but had never seen. It made Harry look madder than anyone at Mungo’s.  He could hear another voice but it wasn’t clear and all he had to go on was Harry’s side of the conversation. Eavesdropper wasn’t what Draco wanted Harry to think about him and he tried to ignore it. He did. Honest. He was staying here so Harry didn’t accidentally tumble and break his neck.
Why Neville thought Draco would strive to defend Hannah confused him. Hannah was squarely in the category of people who loathed him, and he made it easier on Neville to never meet to try and fix it and avoided her as much as possible.
People weren't interested in Draco, they were interested in Malfoy. Nothing from any previous encounters of those who had flirted and made their intentions clear ever made this make sense. Where was Harry's endless sea of compliments and ego-bolstering comments, or boasting about feats that Draco thought bogus? Where was the questions about his money? Why had Harry asked about the Mark instead, like everyone else, ignoring it as if it was the dirty secret they would allow him? Where was his nattering that begged to be liked and happy to side only as a substitute to his dead wife?
Despite Draco’s assumptions on his son’s reactions, he didn’t expect the anger to be directed at him. “I didn’t know where you’d gone!” Scorpius was yelling, and Draco hadn’t heard him raise his voice ever. Not to him.
“We’ll talk after Harry’s better. Sorry, Harry. I’m so sorry.” Charlie chanted and Draco went to turn Harry’s head, away from the violent and gruesome scene of the bloody leech and his mangled arm and close his eyes. Blink rate should go up under times of stress and pain. Now it explained why he hadn’t shut them. Charlie pulled it away only after Siobhan cut away a tiny part of flesh that was stuck in the leeches’ teeth.
“It’s not the same, Draco.” Harry tried again, and Draco shrugged away the weight of Potter trying to lean into his space. “Hermione’s like a sister to me.”
The plates clinked together as the tray was placed down next to the stack of paper. Now in two categories of read and unread. The unread pile was still taller. Draco knew then Harry wouldn’t take silence as an answer as he stood, unmoving and stubborn.
“And? He started it by saying my son should expect abuse because he’s a bad kid. Idiot doesn’t even know him--”
“Heard you were out,” Blaise didn’t sound too pleased at that revelation, “I take it that means you’re out of the woods and all that?” Turning to look at the once proud Manor made Draco squirm. Hating the blasted place and letting people see it like this were two very different beasts.
If Harry wasn’t going to go even when told, Draco could infer well enough. Harry moved on, memories already fading. They’d never discussed waiting or pausing – Harry stopped coming completely. Had he taken Draco’s words to heart or had he kept away, his pride at slinking back and saying Draco was right too much?
Draco was awoken again, though he couldn’t be sure how much time had passed or when exactly he’d fallen asleep. A knock at the door and Ron – why was he here – wandered in.
“The Prophet would have a field-day with this. Harry Potter, Vanquisher of Evil and Detester of Tea.”
The hippogriff pranced about, rearing up, lowering its head keen on Potter’s attention. This wasn’t happening. Harry grinning and cooing all over it.
“Harry?” Draco put down his food and followed. “Did you forget you could just Accio--” He grabbed at his arm, wanting to tease him over how it was possible he forgot yet again, he was a wizard capable of magic. As soon as Draco touched his skin, he let go. Harry’s magic was wild, like it had been before Draco could feel it pulse in his bones and painful as it washed over his skin.
“I’ll live. How long have I been here?” Pain relief or healed, Draco couldn’t tell which, only his limbs were weak and his legs shaky whenever he tried to move them under the covers.
Albus’ potions were important for now and Draco couldn’t risk it. Decided to check ingredients and cut out the hardened stems and remove the turning mouldy-moss. Following on, an attempt at what this Alice wrote.
I apologise for the unannounced hiatus! My entire schedule was turned upside down and I hadn't the energy to write for very long. So, even though I was bogged down and couldn't do much I have made *some* progress.
“What, trouble in paradise?” Draco snorted, he didn’t like the attention some people gave him over his still worn wedding ring. To him, it was an absurd concept. He shouldn’t wear it because his wife was dead. But he still loved her, still thought of her as his wife no matter how long she’d lay buried.
What should he say to that? What would happen to a squib Harry Potter? Was he to blame for this? This should never have happened, Draco shouldn’t have allowed this. Harry would be so pissed, maybe it would be best for him to lack the same magical prowess.
“Definitely the worst lie you’ve tried on me as of yet. You sound awful by the way.” Hermione sighed as she scratched out another few lines on her parchment and started again. Another speech and going by the amount of ink and scored out lines it wasn’t going well. “Have you heard anything? The vote isn’t far now.”
Charlie left, begrudgingly and hesitant but leave he did and Draco told her another, “I didn’t think a Healer would be the one to torture the Boy Wonder.”
Neville faltered. The problem with Revealing Whisper was, embarrass someone enough and they’d utter not a word of it - even if it was in their favour. Right now Neville could say it word for word: but the point was, Draco could deny it. He supposed he should have mentioned that aspect. Lying and goading were the key points to this game. Knowing how someone would react versus how they thought of loss. Neville was not egotistical, he’d let this slide.
At some point, Draco slept, for how long he wasn’t sure. When he awoke, it was with a jolt - the book he last read lay haphazardly on the ground. Harry grumbled under his breath. His face was flushed now, and if Draco had not ordered Lotty to stay beside Siobhan, both now absent from the room, he would have thought Lotty had failed to wring the damp cloth and soaked the pillow.
Draco debated on what to bring, he wasn’t going to assume he was going to staying over at Harry’s for much longer. Although, Draco wouldn’t mind staying over again, he snorted. Right as if Potter wouldn’t be smug at that admission.
As soon as he saw the Gryffindor arming himself, Draco decided that the fight was on. Luckily there were patches of snow laying on the ice, of which he quickly took some munition. Before Potter had the chance to throw anything at him, he ran further towards the middle of the lake. The ice was probably weaker there, seeing as it was a bit darker, but that was exactly why he did it. He wanted to see how daring that Gryffindor really was.
Harry woke up abruptly and panic scourged through him at the bundles of sunlight in the room. What was the time? Was he late for- The realization of Christmas hit him and he let himself fall back on the bed with a huff, that was until he landed on something that was most definitely not part of the bed. His breath was stuck in his throat as he turned to find the blond lay there. He had almost forgotten, but now he thought back on it he remembered clearly how they had wrapped themselves up under the blankets and in one another's hold. It reminded him of his stupid feelings as well, as to why he rolled to the side of the bed before he sat up and placed his head in his hands. What was even going on here?
Draco decided there was only one thing he could do to get attention. As Harry walked away, he ran after him, dropped himself onto the floor and started rolling around dramatically. "Pottaaah!"
Pansy had always said he took too much care of his appearance. Or rather, that he cared too much. His morning routine was considerably longer than that of his roommates, but they'd accepted that by now. He just liked to look decent, another remainder of his upbringing. So after taking care of his hair, which he'd been dying to do ever since it had been messed up the previous day, he left the dormitories, carrying a pair of figure skating skates. He'd found them underneath his bed, where they'd been laying for quite a while. It had amazed him that the house elves had never gotten rid of them, not even after the war.
Harry tried not to laugh. "Yes, Master Malfoy," he joked as he took the cup. Somehow he felt in the mood of teasing around the blonde more and more the past few days. before he had always been groaning about the other when he mocked or teased him in that matter of his, but he could quite enjoy their more playful banter now. It might be because he knew it was supposed to be playful or because he just wanted to see the other's behavior positively due to his feelings, yet he didn't bother to figure out which was true. With the plate and their cups placed on top, Harry made his way back to the kitchen, a grin plastered on his face.
Harry's fist clenched tightly around the feather in his hand. That guy sure struck a nerve. Mission accomplished for mister Malfoy. Taking deep breaths, he looked up to the other. "It looks more as if you have a soft side to me, Malfoy," he asserted.
The other had secretly hoped that the blonde would have come after him, but obviously, that guy only cared about himself. He walked towards the library, that potion homework wouldn't write itself.
"Friends," He repeated, taking the other's hand. "I'll talk to them, but I can't guarantee anything." A small smile played on his lips. He was glad they had settled this. It was then he registered his surroundings once again. "Yesterday you brought me here, right? I can't really fully recall what happened, but seeing you came back I guess I was doiing quite badly, huh?"
Harry hugged himself as puffs of warm air left his mouth. It was cold, yet he was glad it seemed to cool his cheeks and the further heat of his body down.
"Just checking up on you, they'll find a way to blame me if you're dying." He mumbled, tightening his grip around the strap of his bag.
In a swift motion, he poured himself a glass of water, put the jug back, and with the glass in hand made his way over to the other two.
Potter's presence was bothering him less and less now, he actually didn't mind that much anymore. "But yes, I do value this," he continued with a softer voice. "Calms me down."
He could also still not comprehend why he was showing Potter such a vulnerable side of himself. Accepting the hug would mean giving in, it would mean he needed help. It would put an end to Draco's carefully composed, self-dependant image. But this wasn't about that anymore. The war was over, and his parents were cowards for trying to flee. He didn't have to act like anything anymore, he could choose what he needed the most. He didn't need to look strong and cold anymore to be able to gain respect. He could break down.
Draco moved up to kiss the other and instantly felt like he could breathe again when their lips met.
"I just couldn't accept the idea that I loved you, Potter, I'm still struggling with it. It's just so hard to ignore and it's shown me more than once that I can't. It makes me uncontrolled and emotional and confused. It scares me, but it's stuck within me. I love you and there's nothing I can do about it."
Malfoy smiled softly and made a sniffy, laugh-ish sound. "I am too," he replied. They still had two weeks of the Christmas holidays left, which meant they had all the time of the world to cuddle and be casual with each other, without lessons or other students interfering. There was no pressure, they could take this easy. Draco needed it to go slow and easy.
But there was another possible reason. Draco was alone. And that didn't mean he had no friends because he did, but then why did he feel so miserable as soon as he'd closed the curtains around his bed? Why could he be in a room filled with friends, but still feel like no one was enough for him? He felt like they didn't know him like he didn't fit in this school anymore after everything that had happened. Maybe he should've gone with his parents when they had asked him if he wanted to finish school or leave with them.
It couldn't be possible that Ron absolutely wasn't mature enough to allow Malfoy to explain things, to apologize, and to talk to him in peace. They could sort this out.
The girl returned his irritated look with a cold one as she leaned back. "As you wish, Malfoy." And with this, their conversation was over. Draco got up, gathered his stuff and decided to make his homework in the dormitories, his bed was big enough to fit some books on it. It was also able to give some privacy by closing the curtains, which was exactly what he needed.
"Yes, I'm fine. Just escaping the crowd," he explained to calm her down. Pomfrey seemed less on edge now she knew she didn't have to worry about yet another student, one who visited quite frequently lately to top.
Malfoy sighed and started to help him up, not even asking if he should help, but just doing it. "You damn stubborn Gryffindor," he mumbled as he sat him down on the bed. He'd been talking about leaving, but that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. "You haven't even rested properly, have you?" He asked.
That was Hermione, he noted. Wait. He shot up in the bed that wasn't his own, head aching. Why was he here? Where was here?
Harry snorted as he looked to the side. "It had its reasons, obviously." He couldn't say that he was not afraid of the forest, it had always scared him. Though Ron had been the one scared shitless when they had gone to see Hagrid's spider. Well, he had to admit the animal had been kinda scary. That reminded him… "Well, I can't help that you were scared of it."
Then why didn't he move? For Merlin's sake, why was he still lying there, contemplating useless things?
But first of all… Why did Draco care about this? Why did he take this so personally? Why didn't he want Potter to hurt himself like this?
"Ah," he raised one of his legs up to balance his hands on as he let his head rest on them. "I just remembered a specific blonde dramatically rolling over the ground when he didn't receive the so-wanted attention. Seeing our situation now, I found it quite ironic." He gave the other a smirk as he finished, quite amused with himself for some reason. It was he who had been embarrassed while Malfoy could have cared any less, so why would it amuse him like this? He had no idea, but it just brought that smile on his face for some reason…
A faint smile spread across his face and a few little clouds of hot air left his mouth. Without further hesitation he continued to walk onto the ice completely, feeling excited because of the thrill of it being able to break at any moment. It wouldn't though, that much was clear.
"I can assure you, I'm fine," Malfoy snapped coldly as he finished putting his skates on. Then he sighed and let some warmth slip back into his voice. "Thank you for caring, but I'm able to figure this out on my own for now. Potter's a delicate subject to me, for now, it's only my business." Draco got up and looked at the other, making sure they were okay again. Pansy just nodded and stepped onto the ice.
Draco shook his head. "I'm not cold." He had suddenly felt a lot colder as soon as Potter had let go of him, but he wasn't freezing.
"As it comes to the dizziness from yesterday, I think it's gone," Harry stated. "Although I still have a headache, plus I'm hungry."
A sigh left the black-haired boy's lips as he came to a halt, turning his head to spot white locks. "Malfoy." An eyebrow was raised at the sudden contact. "So he does understand English, marvelous." The boy remarked. Irritated at the sassy remark Harry rolled his eyes and continued on his way.
He was quite proud at himself for a minute when realization dawned on him that he had been acting normal around the blonde even after their way too cozy moments. Surely, he didn't mind, but to keep their friendship secured he had to keep his feelings out of it. He should count himself lucky that they didn't have to go through that ridiculous rivalry for another year. Harry sniffed at the sight of his plate. He wasn't hungry anymore after all that drama if he were to be honest.
Hermione gave a hand signal to Ron to stay put in the opening as she walked towards them and Harry felt himself getting small - as if she was his mom coming to scold him. She took rather small steps at a casual pace, which made him even more fidgety. With another wave of her hand, this time between Harry and Malfoy, she finally spoke. "What is it with the sudden silent interaction between you two, if I may ask?"
Draco couldn't help but turn slightly red after Potter had said that. Of course, he could have expected such a remark after what he'd said, he shouldn't be startled by this at all. Except, he was and he tried to hide it as well as he could. "Well you'd like that, wouldn't you?" He mocked back, not even sure what he was doing or saying anymore. This was out of his hands.
He was lucky that he'd given up crying years ago. All his body could do now was shake and heat up from the emotions. He didn't want to break down in front of Potter, he couldn't. At this point, however, it wasn't a matter of wanting. He'd already broken down.
Hermione had been looking at something behind Harry before she spoke, and the boy immediately knew what she was asking for. "Is Malfoy staying as well?" While she could have asked him directly, she was being rather careful with her words. He was going to evade the question anyway, though he felt like he should just come out and tell them. About the party and their plans about it, that is, leaving his love confession and the fact that. Malfoy and he had slept together out of the picture. That might be a story for another time.
"A moment of weakness?" he repeated. "I could have sworn you said you could care less about what people thought, It seems I was wrong."
"And you?" He wasn't sure if he was asking about Potter's love life or his plans for the future, but both answers would please him.
"I'm a businessman Potter," he said. "I'll do it if you've got something interesting to offer me in return."
"Well, uhm, I just sleep unwell thanks to the nightmares I have," Harry stated, "And I fail to get my daily dose of liquid as you know. I don't know, I guess I just forget to drink enough?" He knew that he didn't tell all of it, but he just didn't know how to bring it. He knew that most people would call him crazy if he would have asked if there was a possibility that You-Know-Who would return.
Malfoy let out a small, fake, offended gasp. "What are you referring to, Potter?" That was indeed a weird way to phrase it, it almost seemed like…
There was a moment when Draco looked up at the other. Things had been moving fast, but suddenly everything stopped.
. He hummed as he left the stairs. Now. The room of requirement. It was good to check what the room would give them. Malfoy and he might have different views for a party room, so he was quite curious about it. He was just going to look at it himself and ask Malfoy later whether the room differed from the one he had seen.
Malfoy shrugged and just started transforming the bed he sat on in an improvised desk. Then he moved it a bit closer to Harry's so that they could discuss stuff easier. "You're underestimating my abilities to teach others, Potter."
He could still remember it. Harry walking away. Damn it. He could handle an argument from Harry but this? Walking off, ignoring him?
“Only when you’ve been around. I’m putting a stop to this magic problem of yours.” Harry flinched, and his grin left with it but Draco was in no mood to give any consideration it was a harsh thing to say, “Maybe then, this bloody house will stop.” More noise, a clatter from another room, the chandelier above them twirling.
And no spell came, no matter how much Draco commanded, pleaded with his own magic to respond. The ring swirled and stayed on his finger. Unharmed without so much as a scratch, not even when Draco picked up what seemed like an antique and he’d raised it above his head and all put stopped when it came too close.
“You’re best at making knickknacks, Theo. Don’t start thinking you can play with politics.” Draco regarded how relaxed Theo seemed, how smug and sure. He might do well against Ron or Harry but Draco knew the man better. He continued, “so, you and whoever you can influence, will happily give Hermione another term.”
Days went by and every time Harry arrived, Draco made a point to touch him, platonic at most. A fix of the collar of his terribly pressed Auror robes, a squeezing hug which did not result in a snogging session no matter how Harry looked at him after. A double-check on if Harry was okay after his newly made batch of potions. All of it showed the same confusion on Harry’s face when Draco left after.
“Look here.” Draco pointed to his own eyes, and Harry just blinked and stared back. Two different sizes. His pupils were two different sizes. How didn’t he see this before? The one time he didn’t stare Potter down. “You took a pain relief potion, didn’t you?” Draco leaned closer and squinted at the left - it was changing size again. Well, what Siobhan had done was clear enough.
Potter touched the back of his neck and Draco retreated to the coffee table again. He would not allow this to go unpunished but a bite now would make Harry return to his drinking and grumbling.
The house elf nearly had a heart attack upon seeing him and the crup. Decimus on the other hand was sniffing the air in the direction of Lotty who gave a wary look towards the creature.
“Go on then, he’s not bought a round yet the cheap bastard,” Seamus slurred and Ginny had a smile that perhaps should count as a warning. As someone straining to see what Draco was up to and as someone Draco had been far too wary of all evening.
Before the idea settled to have an early-early drink to give reason to the burning in his gut, Scorpius took that moment to rush in. He stood stock still at the sight of Decimus, which had taken to sniffing the air intensely, ears perked and tails hanging low, with a hint of a wag.
Swallowing the lump in his throat he couldn’t allow this to happen, “No one will know? Not even that husband of yours?” He was spiteful, he was stuck.
“You’re the one that needs bloody help.” The words were spoken harsh and brittle, lashing out in defence - he most certainly was not incompetent. Be it from the anger or the need to not be looking up at Harry, Draco stood despite his arm hurting as the magic burned against it. And by the look on Potter’s face he was too.
I need you to find a venue which can hold the annual Association for Overlooked Justice, Rembrandt has been ‘unfortunate’ in his help to locate one within the time frame and no doubt will be of no help in any means worthy. For one evening and possibly into the night. In a week today. Formal event. Sorry for the short notice but I suspect this is another ploy to make me look incompetent.
“Shouldn’t you avoid apparating?” Potter had the audacity to check him over for more wounds, as if Draco was ready to hit the floor again.
Stone against stone, grinding harsh and loud that startled the guests below. The floor quivered and lurched, Harry grabbed onto Draco’s arm as the balcony morphed beneath their very feet, thick side railings raising higher and impassable. Unbelievable. The double-doors, once white and its panels of pretty glass vanished and left them alone, isolated. A box with no roof. No sightseeing guests.
Harry knew - Draco knew he knew - detrimental or not - but not what - Draco was hiding something from him. Fifteen minutes should help dry those stains in pretty well and give time for Harry to add in more.
From the outsider looking in, it was uttery shite in all its qualities. Too short, too thin, too few branches and no seeds created. It was a seedling, branching no more than a few inches in height and length before it faded out. Blaise assumed wrong, as Potter was at the middle mound. He thought Potter probably only managed one and a half, like most ‘powerful’ wizards and witches. Blaise had only ever managed one.
“I know you both, maybe the three of you think I was being cruel for cruelty sake.” Siobhan wiped her brow with the back of her hand. Her fingers were covered in blood too. “You need his magic - the dragon’s magic to be eaten, right? Having him feel nothing wouldn’t make the dragonblood rise. It would take longer if I numbed him, dangerously long. This was safer, I mean it. You can’t just constantly add Blood-Replenishing Potion upon Blood-Replenishing Potion. You know potions, you know that.”
