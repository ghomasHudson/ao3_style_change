“Il s'appelle Dumbledore, chérie”
Much love!
“welcome, welcome! Let me light up a couple more candles for you.” As he turned to do just as he promised Harry began to inspect the wands laid out before him and process the information that he was just given. They all looked so beautiful and delicate. A true fine piece of art. He just couldn’t see it anything really other than just that. Maybe when he finds his own wand he will feel differently. He had been told the bond between a wizard and their wand is very sacred and special. As Harry was inspecting the wands Sabrina and Benoît disappeared to the back of the shop and Adele left to buy a few ingredients for the potion she was currently brewing before the shops closed. Adele and Laurent were watching him like hawks and whispering back and forth among themselves most probably trying to figure out how to address all this later, nearly every shop they went to there had been comments about his parents and Lord Voldemort.
Harry did not disagree with him and so the hat loudly declared to the patiently waiting audience its decision. “... SLYTHERIN!”
After all of Harry's measurements were taken he was ushered into the fitting area in the back corner of the shop to try on some already pre-designed formal robes. which Mr. Tattings kept assuring Harry that anything could be changed and altered in any way that Harry desired.
“The Beaumont’s accompanied by Harry Potter! Isn’t this just our lucky day! Of course, we’ve heard all about the lot of you, so it's only fair to introduce myself, Mason Twilfitt and my husband and business partner Noah Tattings!” he said as he was gesturing to his husband.
. Memory Charms can be so strong that they completely remove a person's memory or even damage his or her mind permanently and then we have….”
“The vibes from nature could best be characterized as ‘Oh yea, Mother...!’” She cut herself off before her mother cursed her to next week. She was very big on good mannerisms.
Harry nodded enthusiastically, remembering the first time he spoke to her, asking about her peculiar last name, to which she responded that it meant a Champion, a Follower of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Upon seeing Harry’s interest on the subject she kindly asked him to give his opinion on the children’s book she was writing based on the Norse mythology and Harry having nothing better to do for the nine hours he attended this yellow walled hell-hole, accepted the invitation and spent Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in Mrs. Art’s small office listening to her beautiful voice and succumbing into a world of gods and adventures and occasionally asking questions about the characters and their origins, the mysterious force throwing the ball across the room forgotten…for now.
“As soon as you pick the right wand, you’ll know” Adele assured him with a smile while Laurent patted his shoulder encouragingly.
As she was taking a breath, Harry couldn’t contain himself and asked all the questions he was holding onto during her talk.
Harry was deep in thought, his calculus homework completely forgotten. It was moments like these that made him appreciate what he had done three years ago. He sometimes had nightmares that he was normal, that his magic was all a dream and he would have no means to defend himself against the Dursleys.
“Thirty, maybe forty minutes….” He had faraway look in his sea green eyes which was nearly buried under his long golden blond strands of hair, clearly not paying attention to Harry’s question.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hello, my Beautifuls!
Harry knew he had to put a stop to this now or it would go on for the next hour, as it had been happening every day for the past week since the incident in physics class were Felix made his mistake.
the possibilities were endless! He could finally live like a normal child and be treated properly…well maybe not, just conditioning the Dursleys to ignore him would properly be better, for both their sake’s.
Harry took a moment to think to himself, what was the most important quality needed in a house? Loyalty.
As soon as he lifted his magic from the Dursleys and freed them, Vernon got to his feet but Harry was faster. He started to shake the table next to them and knocked down a couple frames from the wall. That seemed to shut him up and the next hour was in a similar fashion. By the end it seemed that Harry had indeed conditioned them with his magic; and as he had read, fear was a strong motivator. To be honest he didn’t really enjoy it. He would have rather them have done this willingly, but that was not a viable choice. He had no other options.
“What can I say, you snooze you lose?” Harry responded in a very sweet voice and earned some chuckles from the boys around and continued to walk past the boy and plump down onto his now claimed bed with a happy sigh.
Chapter 2:
“What...” The silver-haired boy gave a small shriek as his belonging disappeared from his hands and appeared on the bed opposite Harry's.
and planned what games they will all be playing the coming Wednesday, July 31, 1991. One day before they were going to be off to their respective schools.
“I got you six of the books on your list:
The ride with Laurent was filled with laughter and jokes as always. He treated the kids to burgers and shakes and drove Felix and Conner to their houses. “Harry! My boy, I assume you will be joining us back at the mansion?” Laurent asked Harry but before he could respond Sabrina beat him to it.
After acquiring everything that was required to survive his first year at Hogwarts, the Beaumont’s made sure that Harry was okay, Laurent, in particular, was not happy that Mr. Ollivander brought up certain subjects that people usually danced around when Harry was present, even though Céleste always argued it would be better if harry just dealt with it all head-on, he was almost 11 after all and a prodigy.
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather – just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother – why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry instinctively touched his scar.
“Harry?” Hearing his name made him snap out of his musings. His friends had long accepted this little quirk of his, after spending so many years in his head and talking to himself, he had gotten used to it.
The room was now mostly empty, only a couple frames and marker stains left on the wall, but Harry knew he could just fix that with a little magic. He just had to will it hard enough. He knew he could make anything happen as long as he wished it hard enough, and he couldn’t wait to find the boundaries of his ability and discover new tricks.
Potter was still muttering under his breath, looking peeved, when Draco set the newspaper aside again. His eyes briefly lifted to Potter’s right wrist, where he now knew a
Now, during his stay at the Dursleys all he had gathered from his parents was that they were alcoholics, unstable and very jealous of the Dursleys life. Which resulted in the car crash that killed them both, and burdened the Dursleys to take Harry in. Sometimes Harry wished he had died with them but now he had a way of getting even. So for the next two years he practiced in the dark of the night, locked away in his cupboard and entertained himself in the non-magical pranks he pulled on his awful relatives. After all Vernon did only say
And just like that, Draco went rigid, and Harry knew even before his expression slid back into that composed, icy nothingness that he’d done it again, he’d said something he shouldn’t have, he’d fucked up a perfectly good conversation.
“Sabrina was trying to catch your attention for the last five minutes. Can you answer her before me Einstein here go deaf? Ow!” Conner was now rubbing his arm were Felix had punched him, his now flushed cheeks matched his fiery head.
“A Charm might cause something to flash different colors. It might cause an object to levitate or even fly through the air. Charms can make a person laugh or dance or even create a bubble of breathable air around a person's head. In all of these cases, the object or the person doesn't really change, they just do something unexpected. Some Charms can be extremely powerful. The Fidelius Charm, for example, can completely hide a person or a place in such a way that no one can find them unless they are given the location by a
“Do They Know It’s Christmas?” by Band Aid was playing on the radio as Harry, Sabrina, Brooke and Felix were trying to decorate a Christmas tree. Conner was away with his family visiting his grandparents in Ireland and he was not pleased, not at all. After a half hour tantrum and some bribing from his parents, Conner had agreed to go to Ireland ‘willingly’ after they bribed him with a Nintendo game thing. Harry had seen one at Felix’s house but he was never really interested in playing that game with some Italian lad named Mario or something. After playing with holograms and creating his wildest dreams into reality with magic, games like Mario just seemed really lame to Harry and Sabrina, of course but she was never vocal about it.
*six months later*
-Harry knew then that if he practiced enough, he could do anything he wanted and stop his tormentors. Which may not have been one of his best ideas because as soon as things started to move around the house and dishes started floating towards the sink to be washed, the Dursleys had reacted very
Harry recalled Adele had told him that Merlin himself was a Slytherin, not in bad company.

like the Norse god Loki; and finally and most important of all, his parents were like him!
“Oh Harry, mon lapin!” Here we go with the nicknames again. As much as he pretended to dislike them, he liked them, very, very much. And he knew that they knew. And unspoken truth among the family.
birthday was just around the corner, but Harry didn’t even care about all that, all he cared about was the fact that he was going to receive his letter from Hogwarts tomorrow, 21
“Which we can discuss at a later date.” She rubbed circles on his back and drew him to herself in a half hug. “Not all magical creatures can do this and for some it is harder than others, specifically human witches or wizards… The more we distance ourselves from nature the harder it gets, now I don’t mean physical distance, but our minds.”
“Merci Adele!” Harry kissed her cheek and smiled at her. “I will try my best! I won’t stop till mother nature loves me!” he proclaimed in a cheeky manner and dashed off to Sabrina, where she was pretending not to be listening in on their conversation.
“Spectacular physical manifestations are not a necessary sign of success. If you need a spectacular manifestation and nature spirits know this, you will get it. The best success in magic is on the inner planes and subtler than such manifestations. This success involves beneficial changes in consciousness that last longer. Also, working with Nature Spirits can also bring a deep sense of partnership with nature and bring new levels of attunement!”
“Mrs. Art...” That made her raise an eyebrow at him. “Sorry, Samantha,” He looked at her sheepishly; he still wasn’t comfortable with the whole ‘first name thing’. He had deduced that he had abandonment issues, if the psychology books that he had gotten is hands on was anything to go by. “We both know they will never let me go there, even though Ms. Hollingworth talked to them. It just made them angrier.”
He was afraid of what was to come.
“Now, now Mon lutin, stop being difficult and let me see if you’re okay. You were up two meters from the ground!” Benoit had a teasing smile, clearly loving making Harry miserable.
“Harry? Are you ok?” Benoit’s voice was asking him. His voice? Oh Benoit!
? Somehow he knew that she didn’t mean the neighbors, so who else was there that even knew or cared about his existence?
Mrs. Art had been most happy to help Harry prank his cousin and to make sure there was no evidence to lead back to him. She never liked the way Dudley treated him, but she had drawn the line that no prank should physically or
“I know we all know this but just to be safe” Laurent’s gaze swept across Sabrina and lingered on Harry. “toss a handful of floo Powder into the fireplace, walk into the green fire, and declare the desired destination
So sorry for the delay! I was traveling and naturally no time to write!
Sensing the uneasiness and tension still in the air the fifth year Slytherin perfect opened a spot next to himself and mimed for harry to sit next to him, as soon as Harry was seated, Avery loud enough for the whole table to hear, raised a glass and toasted Harry:
According to Sabrina that’s what older siblings are supposed to do, make you feel loved and miserable. Ugh.
“As I was saying earlier,” he gave Benoit a look. “I took Adele’s advice and meditated, trying to calm my magic and connect to my surroundings! And it finally worked! I was soooo close to giving up! But I finally did it! I could feel everything and it was… it was… I don’t even know how to really describe it…” Harry was shaking his head as if to get rid of the returning feelings.
The new students were then greeted at the Great Hall by Professor Minerva McGonagall, who tells them they will soon be sorted into their houses. The four residences: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin, with each house having its own team for Quidditch. Harry was very excited to try out for quidditch a sentiment Ron and the two other boys that were standing next to him agreed with.
“Please forgive me Sabrina, I believe you wanted something?” Harry was now crossing the room towards his best friend a fellow witch. She was smarter than him; always distancing herself from Conner, Brooke and Felix when doing homework, something that should take them all an hour or two hours tops, would take the three probably five hours.
“Ok then, now let’s go back to my story. Knowing you, I had written an alternate ending. Maybe you will like this better?” Samantha was saying as she bent over her desk to find her desired page. She always did know how to turn Harry’s frown into a smile. “Ok here I found it!” She snatched the paper up and shook it in the air.
“No thank you, I think it will be best if you drove me home, I don’t want Vernon grounding me because I interrupted them in middle of their favorite show….” It certainly wouldn’t have been the first time, not that it mattered. The Dursleys always found something to blame him for and lock him in his cupboard, and to be honest Harry preferred it, it was much better than having to suffer through their senseless conversations and Dudley’s hurtful comments directed at Harry. At least in the dark he could relax and use his magic to entertain himself. Recently, he had discovered how to project images from his mind into the air around him.
And now with my classes starting again next week, there might be slight delays again.
A couple of minutes into his chat with Hermione he had discovered that both her parents were muggles, So it was quite a shock when her letter accompanied by professor McGonagall had arrived at her house, therefore she had spent all summer preparing for her first year at Hogwarts and had already memorized half of the spells they will be learning the coming months. He appreciated her forethought and her similar thirst for information. Maybe they will get along after all. Ron was a whole different story, as Harry later in the ride discovered Ron came from one of the 28 pureblood families (which his own used to be a part of at some point in history) and had grown up surrounded with magic, but somehow still lacked the ability to perform a simple cleaning charm. Huh. Apparently, not everyone is naturally in tune with their magic, he wondered why that was? Was something causing a glitch in his magic?
He didn’t like this distinction between the classes, but at the same time -- if he was one of them (and Laurent having checked his family tree had assured him that he was) -- he could use his name and family status to get ahead in the world much more easier than a run of the mill simple wizarding family.
“What’s a seeker?” he asked her. It was probably a quidditch thing; he could faintly remember Benoit saying something of that kind.
If any of you are in college and maybe an architecture major, you would know there is hardly any time to do anything trivial and fun! But alas I have decided to update every 3-4 weeks, so I won’t be MIA for months!
“I will be in two months!” Harry injected. “That’s not the point, mon lutin.” He was now sitting in a way that was completely facing Harry and holding his gaze, things were serious now.
Upon arriving in Hogsmeade the 1
“Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember ... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter ... After all, He Who Must Not Be Named did great things – terrible, yes, but great.” Harry shivered. Laurent now had a protective hand on his shoulder, a nonverbal promise of protection. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. They paid seven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.
“I was meditating just like Adele told me! Trying to calm down my magic and connect with my surroundings! And… and ... it was amazing! I don’t even know where to begin! I could feel everything yet I was so calm and there were so many new colors! It was just so bloody awesome!” he exclaimed with a laugh.
“Sweetie, I saw you fall after the paper ball hit you,” she gave a dirty look towards Dudley the perpetrator of the attack. From experience she knew that reprimanding the children for picking on Harry only made matters worse for him. “Do you want to sit with me? I can read the rest of my story for you?”
The Sorting Hat snapped him out of his thoughts.
“bloody ‘ell” The boy shrieked, not expecting to be cheated out of his desired choice. Malfoys always get what they want. The silver-haired boy looked around to find the person who dared challenge him and when his eyes landed on Harry, he raised an eyebrow towards him.
“More like you’re jealous of us my little Einstein, even moving a mere frontalis muscle is hard for you! Not even in in complete control of your body…” Conner was now shaking his head in mock agony. Sometimes being cooped up in a room with these two was too much to handle.
Queen was giving him the stink eye. “King to d2” Harry watched as his king took long graceful steps to the spoken destination. “Bishop to c2” interesting move. “Knight to d7” “pawn to h4…” as both opponents commanded their pieces to move on the board, both having one goal in mind, it made it so much easier for Sabrina to douse both men with glue before they were suffocated by
“Harry, given your past and history it is no surprise that you are such a gifted wizard. Your powers are so advanced and you haven’t even started at Hogwarts!  There are so many wizards and witches that can’t do what you have accomplished so far! You don’t even have a wand yet!”
“How can we be of service to you today? I’m guessing a certain letter is going to be arriving soon?” now he was wagging his eyebrows in Harry's direction.
“Ron, you are going to get chocolate all over your robes! Its not even the first day yet!” the curly girl fumed at him and turned to look at Harry. “Do you know a cleaning spell? I know he doesn’t” she glares towards the orange-haired boy identified as Ron and continued “know it and well I’m awfully close to getting it right, don’t want to accidentally make his face explode” Harry without missing a beat willed the chocolate molecules away from Ron’s skin and back onto the remaining bits of the frog.
“Vernon? Vernon are you okay? Did the freak do something to you?” his aunt stepped into the kitchen and eyed him warily.
“When are
“Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus,” which Benoit entering the kitchen had heard, interjected that meant “Never tickle a sleeping dragon.”. Very fitting.
Chapter 4:
“… Earth to Harry… Harry….. Oi Potter!” That last part got his attention and his eyes snapped towards the owner of the voice.
As they were driving to Kings cross Harry was reminded of his goodbye with the Dursley family. When he had mentioned he will be taking the train to Hogwarts Vernon had cheekily said: “Funny way to get to a wizard's school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"
“Yes Ma'am!” Harry had already secured his jacket in one hand and was running towards the door to help Samantha open it.
“Fine, fine…” “GET YOUR BUTT IN THE HOUSE FREAK!” Vernon and Dudley started at the same time. No doubt dear old Dudders was enjoying this immensely.
“Measly? Newton's Law of universal gravitation is measly to you? What was it that you said the equation was?
They had all gone to Paris two weeks ago to get Sabrina measured for her first set of robes and to tour Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Sabrina had been so excited that nothing would have been able to wipe the smile that was plastered on her face. She was asking the poor, very
I’m so sorry for not updating the story these couple months…. *smiling widely*
“I found the star!” Harry shouted as soon as the statue was repaired.
“But before we end this conversation Harry, I must warn you. If nature spirits are approached with disrespect or by attempting to command them rather than listening to them and inviting them to work with you, nature spirits may flee, rebel, or attack! I once attended a ritual by some pseudo-Crowleyites who attempted to perform the "Ritual of the Barbarous Names" at a power spot in a forest and then to extend the circle several hundred yards in all directions. While the forest in general had loud insect and frog noises, the area at where the ritual took place got quiet immediately when the main ritualist declared that all spirits were subject unto him!” She paused for dramatic effect.
Harry was floating. He could feel everything. The vibrations, the textures, even taste the colors around him. As if nothing and everything in existence was now a part of him, just as a finger or toe, an extension of his body. There but not really there. It was so confusing. And the amount of emotions and vibrations around him did little to help him understand. He felt overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time. Emotions all blended together giving birth to something new.
“Oui, papa. Est-ce que Adèle et Benoît nous rejoindront ce soir ? Ils me manquent terriblement!” Harry loved it when they spoke French, and because he had been spending so much time with the family since Mrs. Art -- who had married a renowned mythologist, professor, and author named Dorien Katsaros, a Greek brown haired man with a very thick accent and five years her senior. Ever since they got married two years ago, Harry had been visiting them less and less. He understood that they needed time to themselves, being newlyweds and all, which reminded him that he promised to join them to see a play next week on Friday. At least he had that to look forward to.
“Plus I’m feeling slightly peckish and I know papa made his famous Sole Meuniere!” And with that the boys started running. Oh god Harry did not want to face Sabrina now. Bugger, she knew him better than he knew himself.
Hey guys!
The next day Sabrina woke Harry up at 7 AM sharp by jumping dangerously close to his face and possibly breaking his nose, which then proceeded to dismiss any protest from Harry defending her physical prowess. ‘I’m practically a cat’ a sentence that was declared at some time during her sleepy jumbled speech. After she successfully dragged him out of bed and down the grand stairs and into the kitchen he saw she had half-assembled a colourful foam board with cutouts of Felix, Conner, Brooke, and a couple of their other friend's pictures glued to the top with various stickers and feathers adorning them.
Harry was mesmerized by the breath-taking beauty of the chateau which was surrounded by colourful gardens and lawns created out of the mountainous landscape with magic. You could hear a mixture of French, Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch languages as they went about the grounds, a part of harry wanted desperately to be here with Sabrina. A stupid irrational part of him feared that he might lose touch with the Beaumont family after he starts attending Hogwarts, even though they had proved to him at every opportunity that he was truly and wholeheartedly accepted and loved as a part of the family, he could help but just wonder
“Vernon! Let’s get inside first! The neighbors can hear us! You don’t want
Benoit was now nodding his head in approval, clearly processing the information while echoing his answer “six months that’s…Incroyable! Truly impressive !” Harry gave him a small smile, loving the fact he could impress the older wizard, and to his credit he’s been doing so for a while now.
birthday so we can invite everyone! And I’m making a game board so we can keep track of the scores and give out a grand prize at the end! Sort of like the tri-wizard tournament, isn’t that a brilliant idea? oui?” she was shaking the board in his face now as if that was going to help change his mind. But he understood what she meant. You can’t always rely on magic to do everything, sometimes you have to take the time and do it by hand taking in the experience. Laurent called it a muggle meditation. From time to time he would find Laurent at his woodworking table sanding his latest designs, a table, a chair, a credenza… the list went on. Apparently, the movements he made with his hands helped him meditate and think, also helped with his wand movements which Harry found fascinating. That is one of the reasons he loved his piano lessons with Sabrina. He liked using his hands, another reason why he found wands so ridiculous. It inhibited the witches and wizards to actually feel and control the magic in a natural organic way, instead they channel it all through a stick to make their spells more accurate and potent. Why use an extension? An outside tool to control something that’s within you?
“Okay well make sure to get your jacket and I’ll get your books so we can hop in the car!” She exclaimed as she carried the stack of books that she had bought him towards the door and opened it.
“Oui?” Harry responded to her in French. He used every chance he got when they were alone to practice. He realized, after she asked whether her siblings were joining them tonight, he had completely missed anything said after that. “I said, Adele and Benoit won’t be joining us tonight.” A little frown crossed her lips. He knew how much she loved her siblings and she loved it even more when they used the Floo Network and appeared in the fireplace with green smoke surrounding them. When Harry had asked if everyone used this mode of transportation he was introduced to the rules and regulations surrounding this and apparition. Apparently one could use the Floo Network only in the wizarding world, unless approved by the Ministry of Magic. The Beaumonts being one of the oldest and a pure blood family had numerous networks in the muggle world which they used to run their business more smoothly, rather than wasting time on a plane. Being from an important family really did make all the difference in the wizarding world.
dress robe, a hat, a pair of gloves and a winter cloak the family was assured the garments will be sent in exactly seven days, two days before the very much anticipated
“So to get the best results, you should perform nature spirit attunement several hours to several days before the main ritual. The purposes of such attunement are to find suitable power spots and to get the help of friendly nature spirits. This timing gives nature time to gather her children and to prepare to actively participate in the main ritual.”
As much as he wanted to portray a strong façade, he was terrified! And he was so ashamed of feeling this way. He knew deep down that it was wrong, that what he felt was normal, but then again no human was truly flawless right? Just because you know something doesn’t mean that you could follow that line of logic. As Harry knew well, knowing and doing where two very different things.
The Slytherin common room and dormitories were located in Slytherin Dungeon. The students entered the Dungeon through a concealed stone wall.  Which they must present the correct password to open the wall and reveal the entrance to the common room. Severus Snape his head of the house, which Harry was getting a sense did not like Harry at all and seemed displeased he was sorted into his house repeated several times that the password to the common room changes every fortnight and that the students need to Keep an eye on the noticeboard.
“Sabrina, your dad will be picking you all up at seven sharp. So be ready and don’t keep him waiting, okay ma chérie?”
Well that wouldn’t do, Harry thought to himself. He needed to find the broken pieces and make it whole again. The spell that was meant to fix things came to his mind, ‘The Mending Charm, also known as the Repairing Charm (Reparo) is a charm that can be used to seamlessly repair a broken object. It works against most material. This charm was invented by Orabella Nuttley, in or before 1754.’ He remembered as Laurent was telling him about this Charm a couple of weeks ago. He never understood why other magical creatures needed words to conjure what was within them. After all, magic was a part of them and Harry didn’t need words to conjure it and make it do what he desired. He could just will it and voila! Whatever Harry desired (with some limitation here and there, as he had discovered during the years) would take shape or happen.
of July. Tomorrow. The thought of actually being whisked off to a magical school somewhere in Scotland where he knew no one somehow didn’t feel real to him. Receiving the letter would force him to finally accept the path that had been laid out for him or at least that’s what he was hoping.
“I need new clothing that actually
Snape's last warning before disappearing behind the flare of his dramatic robes was to never bring anyone from another house into their common room or tell them their password. No outsider has entered their common room for more than seven centuries.
They had all met the first day of classes at The Wiseman private school for gifted children and had formed a special relationship among themselves. They were his family now.
So as he was staring at the angel-faced star statue in his hands, he watched as the little cracks on the face begun to fade and the broken pieces found their way back to their original place one by one. No words needed to be said.
Where Harry buys a stick, to do magic with?
“Well, well see who we ‘ave ‘ere! ‘arry potter! last I saw ye were a little spot, barely weighed 2 stones!” he patted Harry hard on the shoulders and continued on. Now everyone was starring at him. “You’re THE Harry potter?” Ron poked at him making harry look at him. His questioning eyes roaming all over his face trying to spot the scar that was strategically hidden behind his hair.
- sometimes she let herself forget. After all how is it possible that the most mature and non-judgmental person that she had met upon coming to England was a four year old kid sitting by his lonesome in the corner of the nursery school and reading a book? She knew there were things Harry was hiding from her, and at first she had made it her mission to find out and to help the child, so he wouldn’t suffer the same faith she had.
The words reminded him of what Dra—
name on his wrist,
Draco stared at Harry’s outstretched hand so long Harry began to fear he wouldn’t answer at all. Harry didn’t notice, but those grey eyes were trained not only on the hand extended in the same fashion Draco himself had once held out his own—but also on the
It was barely an hour later that Harry’s Floo spat out his next handful of guests.
“I’m curious,” the brunette said, tone as icy as her glower. “Is there a reason, pray tell, why no one at the Ministry was informed that Harry had returned to the apartment and not, as we were led to believe, died a horrible death at the hands of one escaped Corban Yaxley? If so, please do enlighten us, I’d
His hand fumbled for the doorknob, but his fingers slipped, and he cursed himself and the door and fucking
Harry’s head snapped up, only to find Nic watching him with lifted eyebrows and a small, clearly amused smile.
Fortunately, before such demeaning urges could be acted upon, Weasley turned to Hermione, eyes accusatory. “You knew, didn’t you?”
Her dark eyes had narrowed to slits, but Harry thought to glimpse genuine concern underneath her heavy lashes. “Wait, how the hell were they allowed to publish that?! It’s an ongoing investigation, for fuck’s sake, the Auror Department—”
All the restless tension must have gotten to him after all, or Blaise simply knew him so well after years and years of friendship that he could read the emotions in Draco’s eyes without any further prompting. Because the other man offered him a small, if sad smile, and Draco felt a smidgen of the pressure in his chest loosen.
First of all, how he’d let Potter convince him to take them both to Knockturn Alley of all places, even with the extra protection the other two Aurors working the case provided, was still a mystery to Draco. One moment, it had looked as though he’d win—because, honestly, how could he have foreseen that Robards would act so…so…so bloody
Next chapter we'll be meeting a character I actually love a lot, despite her not-so-great taste in men xD
“So,” he said, keen to change the topic. Hermione’s dark eyes were already dangerously misty, and he wanted to avoid her breaking down any further if at all possible. For it was a fact of life just as universally valid as breathing or eating or sleeping that, if Hermione Granger ever broke down, the rest of the world was soon to follow. “Have either of you seen Robards?”
Harry seemed similarly awed, although his shock was understandably greater. “That’s…,” he tried and shook his head, making a strand of black fall into his eyes. “That’s actually rather brilliant, Parkinson.”
, there was no other word for it—while Draco shot Blaise the sort of glare that could level entire civilisations and turn metropolises into wastelands, while Harry just stared very intently down at his bedsheets, cheeks now full-out burning.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but the grin pulling at her lips betrayed her. Ignoring her boyfriend’s indignant huffs, she shifted her dark eyes to Harry. “So, Harry, how are you feeling about tomorrow?” To anyone who didn’t know Hermione Granger all that well, it might sound like a casual question. But the concern lacing her words gave her true intentions away, and Harry had to repress another grimace.
. Just shut up and listen, will you, you complete and utter moron?”
When she finally let go again and stepped back, Ron looked tempted to hug him as well. But Harry’s lingering pain must have been more visible than he’d thought, for the redhead wisely abstained. Instead, he said, “So, Malfoy. Is he…?”
“He’s quite nice, don’t you think, Harry?” Parvati was already continuing, oblivious to where Harry’s attention lay. “And rather handsome, too. Personally, I couldn’t like him as anything more than a friend, even without the obvious issue of gender. But Nic really seemed to like you a lot. He mentioned you might meet up at the pub sometime soon…?”
Healer Hodkinson looked distressed. “But I’m sure it’d be more comfortable for you if you had some privacy—”
And perhaps it was Blaise’s words from earlier still echoing through his mind, or Pansy’s remark about soulmates and her continuous stream of knowing looks, or just the knowledge that Harry cared about him, about Draco Malfoy, cared and liked and maybe even needed him. Whatever it was, Draco made up his mind that very moment, made up his mind and made himself a promise, the same promise he’d given Blaise less than an hour before.
“But,” Narcissa added when Draco once again opened his mouth. She reached out and placed a comforting hand on her son’s knee, saying gently, “You should know, my dear, that your father’s mind is not what it once was. Azkaban…hasn’t been kind to him. Loathe as I am to admit it, these could very well be the ramblings of a mad man—”
Because there it was.
Pansy lifted a perfect eyebrow and crossed her arms across her chest, jewellery jangling. “I know you’re painfully Gryffindor, Potter, but even you must be intelligent enough to recognize two people conversing.”
“If it
it, so easily and without thought, as though it were the simplest thing in the world.
He walked back to where Draco was waiting impatiently a few feet away, and it struck him then how abnormally
At that, everyone but Ron, who was busy eyeing the chocolate cake, raised an eyebrow in visible surprise. Had Harry not seen Draco baking with his own two eyes, he’d likely be similarly baffled. At the memory of the usually so immaculate Slytherin in his pink baking apron, chocolate covering nearly every free patch of skin as he cursed a muggle hand mixer, the corners of Harry’s mouth inadvertently lifted. Now that was an image he’d never forget.
Harry blinked. Rubbed his eyes. Squinted. Blinked again. And yet the image stayed the same. Then Draco started cursing, and the mystery of earlier’s disembodied expletives was promptly solved.
They were out in Muggle London, at some fancy-looking restaurant Nic had sworn had the best French cuisine in the area, the name of which Harry likely wouldn’t be able to pronounce even if held at wandpoint.
the work was without Harry’s added help. But Harry hardly listened. He felt someone’s gaze on him and turned, only to find Hermione watching him, apparently not listening to her fiancé either, that same thoughtful look back in her eyes.
to be this fun. It should be illegal—it probably was illegal.
Harry of course didn’t hold her abrupt departure against her; this was, after all, Hermione, and he knew from experience that keeping her from her work, whether school- or job-related, was a deadly endeavour.
“Harry. Mate,” Ron said, and the sheer amount of weariness in his tone instantly cleared away any lingering fatigue Harry might have felt, replaced instead by shock. “We only just heard about last night. When I got to the office, everyone was talking about how Yaxley attacked you in Diagon, and it was a right mess, and there was some sort of poisoned dagger involved, and you were here… So I got Mione and we immediately Apparated here, and then the Welcome Witch told us it was Malfoy that got injured, and…” Three pairs of eyes shifted to the bed across the room, and Harry felt his own chest become oddly tight.
And then he pulled Harry into yet another bone-crushing hug.
“Answer the question, Draco,” he said calmly. “Where is your injury?”
“It’s fine,” Nic said, his lips twitching into a small half-smile. “Really, it is. I don’t mind talking about Delia. I just…don’t do it very often.”
! Harry, someone tried to
She paused, looking at Draco expectantly, any trace of that earlier blush long gone, replaced instead by that fiercely glimmering purpose Draco had learned to expect when faced with Hermione Granger. It dawned on him then that she was waiting for him to answer, and so, although he dreaded whatever ‘it’ was, he gave a dazed nod.
When Malfoy’s voice sounded again, it was no more than a strangled whisper. “You think so? Genuinely?”
Harry did a quick survey of the room; both Lavender and Hermione were studying Draco with what might be described as wary approval, and although both still looked suspicious, the previous distaste in their eyes was long-gone. Parvati simply seemed curious, while Ron had both eyebrows raised high as he regarded the blond, evidently unsure what to think. And Ginny…well. Harry really didn’t know what Draco had said or done in the past few minutes to offend her so, but then again, even Harry had to admit he could, at times, be a tad slow when it came to unspoken signals.
unsubtlety, “Out with it, Potter. What’s bothering our divine Saviour now?”
For some reason, this only annoyed him further, and he grumbled, “You don’t deserve my love.” Harry only laughed harder, as if he weren’t single-handedly responsible for every and all of Draco’s frustrations, and Draco shot them both a glare.
“Harry.” Draco looked at him long and hard, tone so serious Harry had to do a double-take. “Harry, in case you haven’t realised it yet, I’m very, very gay.”
Because, as he had told the Slytherin the day before:
And call him a sentimental sap, but for Draco that was reason enough.
Hello my dear readers! I have a feeling you'll like this chapter...get ready for some teeth-rotting fluff ;)

It was the second time the man had looked at Draco like that, as if he
The other man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but all he said was, tone deceptively even, “Of course,

“For a Gryffindor, you’re incredibly conniving at times, you know that?”
Harry snorted, but the relief that crashed over him was far from subtle. “I wish. Then I could’ve saved a shit-ton of money after the war.” At Malfoy’s questioning look, Harry sighed and explained, “Hermione decided I needed to see someone to talk to about my, err, problems. She said it wasn’t healthy to keep it all boxed in. I did, for a few months.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Don’t get me wrong, I know therapists—err, Mind Healers—can really help people. It just didn’t work for me. Relieved me of a lot of gold, though.” Harry gave a strained laugh, suddenly uncomfortable under Malfoy’s unblinking stare.
Draco didn’t bother conceal the relief that engulfed him then, like a tidal wave crashing down on an unsuspecting fisher’s boat, and he sighed and let himself fall back onto the bed. “Thank Salazar.”
, I mean.”
“Ha. Yes, besides that.”
—is genuinely humble. They’re just putting on a show, to draw attention to themselves and/or fish for compliments.”
Draco pulled Harry into a narrow, dark alleyway, and he didn’t need any light to be able to say with utmost certainty that the Slytherin was currently scowling something fierce, for the simple reason that he could.
, made Draco want to punch something—preferably a face, preferably Yaxley’s. But he simply clenched his fists at his sides and glowered through the glass, as though it weren’t magically charmed and Yaxley could actually see how much Draco hated him.
Yaxley wasn’t fazed. He clicked his tongue, watching Draco with what could only be described as amusement. “You know, you surprise me, Draco. Honestly, you do. I’ve never been one to be easily nonplussed, and I certainly never thought you’d be the one to do it, and yet, you’ve managed it. Congratulations. It seems you’re more complex an individual than I initially gave you credit for.”
Nic didn’t answer for a moment, gaze fixed on his own glass of water, long enough that Harry started to wonder whether he’d done it again, said something stupid, something tactless, whether he’d just single-handedly ruined the date.
“Get up, Harry,” he gritted out, not sparing Nic a second glance. “We’re leaving. Now.”
Stunned silence descended upon the corridor, and Draco used those few moments of reprieve to take in the pasty faces across the hall. There were Weasley and Granger, of course, and Finnigan and the She-Weasel and Longbottom and Luna Lovegood. Those six Draco recognized instantly. The others were a bit trickier, but after a bit of brain-racking he identified Dean Thomas, Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well, plus some bloke Draco had never seen before. Briefly, Draco wondered how the hell all of them had gotten wind of Potter’s predicament so quickly, but then it hit him that, of course they’d be with him, it was his bloody birthday after all.
Malfoy was still sneering slightly, his arms folded tightly across his chest, but neither gesture was as hostile as it had been mere moments before. Harry felt a new surge of excitement; Malfoy wasn’t convinced yet, obviously, but he wasn’t
But Robards simply shook his head. “As much as I appreciate the offer, Auror Weasley, I’ve already made my decision on the matter. The case you and Mr. Potter were working on before all this happened, regarding the lunatic going round, hexing all those whose blood isn’t ‘pure’—it’s simply far too important to be put on hold. And, before you suggest it, I do not want to give the case to anybody else, just so that’s clear.”
So, he held out his hand expectantly, and he waited. Harry watched as an array of different emotions flashed across the other’s face, most of which were immediately reigned back in and hidden behind that veil of apparent cold disinterest. But not before Harry glimpsed the look of abject surprise that flared in Malfoy’s grey eyes as he stared down at Harry’s hand.
through his veins. For as much as he knew it was a futile hope, he wanted Harry to disagree. To tell him no, he had indeed misheard, that Nic was a friend and nothing more, that Harry wouldn’t ever go on a date with him no matter how much the man threw himself at his feet. Draco wanted that so. Much. More than he could even begin to fathom.
“Oh, by the way, Harry, speaking of wannabe Hogwarts Professors,” Parvati said then. “Nic told me you guys met at the pub the other day. I gave him your Floo, I hope you don’t mind. He said he might call you soon. Honestly, I think he rather likes you.”
was too important to give up on.
As he asked that last question the anger flickered away for a moment, leaving only one emotion in its wake. And suddenly, Draco understood just what was so wrong here.
. “What, changed your mind already? You wound me, Draco, you really do.”
It was true, of course, had been since the beginning. But Draco had never imagined, never so much as considered that maybe, just maybe, he was hurting Harry as well.
To be perfectly frank, Draco couldn’t remember a time in his entire life that he’d ever felt so utterly vulnerable, so completely and utterly defenceless.
‘That I have your name inked into my wrist’?
, the oiliness of his smile had Draco close to retching.
“Salazar,” the blond said, and gave a mirthless little laugh, all the while still staring down at Harry as though he might disappear if he so much as blinked.
When Harry turned to where Malfoy sat by the fireplace, legs crossed, reading a thick, leather-bound book, the outturn must have been evident in his grin, for the Slytherin scowled darkly, shutting his book with a bang.
—I’m far too fond of you now.”
Harry hesitated, before admitting quietly, “I thought it was an arranged marriage.”
When he looked up again, a smile was stretched taut across his mouth. “Dad’s not really in the picture anymore, I’m afraid. He and my mother went through a nasty divorce, just a little while after Delia died. It was just…a lot on everyone. I don’t blame either one of them. Anyway, he doesn’t live in the States anymore, so there’s not much he can do.”
Draco froze, knowing even if Harry pointedly did
But Draco couldn’t think straight, couldn’t think
But the other man ignored him, and as he continued, his tone became more and more heated. “None of you were. Do you have
“Fine. But if you get yourself killed, Harry, I’m going to be pissed.”
Draco stared at him long and hard. “Un—nope. Just no. I don’t even want to know what that is.
Draco snorted incredulously, but with his thundering heart and blood roaring in his ears, he hardly heard himself. “What the hell, Blaise? Spit it out, will you? I’ve gone through enough shit for one day. What.

“Wow,” Harry said, and his voice quivered ever so slightly, as though he could barely restrain his rage. Draco couldn’t blame him. “Just
Draco froze.
Yet, there he’d had it. It’d actually seemed possible, if only briefly.
Harry set down his own mug of coffee, and the sound made the Slytherin wince, which in turn only deepened Harry’s frown.
Harry whirled around, grinning, wand pointed at Draco, who in turn already had his wand pointed at Harry. They both came to a screeching stop, wands drawn, eyes locked, both waiting for the other to attack first.
Another moment of silence ticked by, and another, and then she nodded stiffly.
that man. Especially when he said, “Great! It’s a date.”
Harry inhaled a sharp breath, startled by the blunt hostility.
was a lie as big as it came. Imagine if Draco hadn’t found Harry that night outside in the alley, or if he’d gotten cold feet and left him at the hospital (because, hate the notion as he might, Draco knew that had been a real possibility), thus forcing Robards to assign some other Auror to Harry’s side, some random stranger, someone who would only see it as a job, an assignment to check off the list.
going to get me to put even a forkful of that nauseating muggle fodder in my mouth, is that understood?”
At his right, Harry could feel Hermione’s piercing gaze on him as well, and he turned to her with the same smile he’d very pointedly offered Ron a few moments earlier. “Yes?”
For the first time since entering the cell, Draco momentarily forgot his hatred for the man in front of him. It slipped for the briefest of moments, replaced instead by pure, unadulterated shock.
Because…he had just been assigned to…to
But then the brunet turned to Harry, forcing another smile as he nodded. “Yeah. Just some beignets. They’re sort of a family recipe, if you will; Grandma was famous for them. I could never get enough as a child, so I learned to make them myself, and, well. I thought you might like some.”
Ginny's not stupid, tho...
On a different note: Harry is totally the stupid, oblivious imbecile we all know and love, and I'm here for it.
here?” He spat the name out as though it were an insult, which, Draco supposed, to Weasley and many other witches and wizards in Britain, it very well was.
Draco fixed her with his best imitation of his father’s glower (the only thing Lucius had taught him that ever came in handy) and deadpanned, “Well, do try to do it into the sink, please. These dragonhide boots are new.”
Harry didn’t mean to linger.
But he swallowed his discomfort. It was better this way; if anyone save for Pansy, Blaise, Hermione and Ron were to find out about them, they’d be in trouble, to say the least. And neither he nor Draco needed that on top of everything else that was going on right now.
Harry quickly blinked again, shaking himself out of his momentary daze, wondering what the bloody hell had come over him. He cleared his throat, averting his own gaze, and said, “She was wrong. What Craigs said back there, about you being a disgrace—she was wrong, simple as that. You turned on Voldemort and your father, yes. But it was the right thing to do. Their ideals were corrupt and immoral, and even though you were brought up to take them as gospel, you managed to question and ultimately abandon them. If you ask me, that’s not weakness or betrayal; that’s strength.”
His 11
I just don’t understand how could all the gods decide that his kids are going to harm and endanger everyone before they even do anything?” Harry said heatedly. “To be honest Mrs. Art, I don’t think the moral of this story is good for kids, punish someone for something you assume they will do in the future? Maybe capturing them in the first place will make them bad people afterwards?” He turned his head towards Mrs. Art - or Samantha as she kept persisting him to call her. She was just looking at him, a smile stretched out on her lips.
“My parents are dead,” Harry said in an agitated voice. He had lost his glasses during the fire, so now everything was blurry and it was giving him a headache.
“umm…” Harry was unsure what to say. The board did not particularly look bad, but he was confident he could make it look a lot better with just a bit of magic.
By the time he was done reading the letter for the third time, he looked up to see Sabrina, Laurent, and Benoit looking at him with smiles on their faces. He loved them so much.
Also,I would like to Thank my Beta, CalliopeGalaxy!
“How long did it take you?”
Chapter 3:
“Oh Harry, it still baffles me how intelligent you are for your age! Have the Dursleys decided if they will be sending you to that private school for gifted children?” The subject of Harry’s education had been a sore topic for him. He knew that the Dursleys would never let him go there, not when it would mean that he was better and smarter that Dudley. Ugh, how he detested his name!
As they got closer to Hogwarts Harry's excitement grew, maybe this won’t be as bad as he thought. Ron and Hermine seemed very nice, so he was off to a great start. He hoped everyone else would be just as nice which he knew was statistically impossible.
“And Dudley, honey, we need you to go to your room. We don’t want you hearing this.” Petunia gave Harry a heated look, and turning around, she guided Dudley towards the stairs. Okay then, this was Harry’s moment to set the record straight. He just loved to use that analogy even though he didn’t quite get it. Samantha did explain it to him but still… that didn’t matter right now. “Actually Petunia, I want Dudley to be here for this. I think it’s about time that we… have a talk.” Harry straightened his back and pushed his headache away. He didn’t have time for that, yet. And by the glare that he was getting from her it seemed that trying to keep that headache at bay was a very smart move. He wanted to do this right and not get angry or show any emotion at all. He had read that that particular trait in people made others wary.
“Avada Kedavr—”
And now, without ANY further ado, enjoy!
The owl had obviously taken Harry’s request to heart, for less than a half hour later, it was back carrying yet another gold-sealed letter. Harry immediately hurried to get it, tearing it open and scanning its contents. And although it was clear Robards wasn’t entirely pleased with the idea either, Harry’s faith in Malfoy must have been persuading enough, for the Head Auror had ultimately agreed to the plan.
“You filthy blood-traitor,” Yaxley hissed. “You will pay for this, Malfoy, I swear on the Dark Lord’s immortal soul. Just you wait, you cowardly piece of scum, you sickening disgrace, you—”
Malfoy’s lips twitched slightly, as though the Slytherin might just smile. “You sure Auror’s the right job for you, Potter? You’re starting to sound an awful lot like a Mind Healer.”
Only they had. And the healers had already told Harry in no uncertain terms that, had he Apparated Draco to St. Mungo’s even a few minutes later, the Slytherin likely would not have survived until morning.
But not even that managed to dim her grin, and she blew him a little kiss before filling her mouth with another scoop of cake batter. “For you, my dear, always.”
Harry almost sighed in relief, but suppressed the urge, instead looking back at Narcissa, who’d stayed silent during their exchange. Her eyes were still trained on her son, though they snapped up to Harry the moment she caught him looking. And, yes, alright, Harry would be the first to admit he wasn’t always the best at interpreting Malfoy-emotions. His obliviousness regarding Draco’s feelings was a prime example for that.
he’d felt ever since storming out of the flat.
Fucking hell, what had he gotten himself into?
Harry’s eyes widened in alarm. “Bloody hell, Nic, are you okay? You look horrible.”
He did what he had always done in situations like these, when something or someone threatened to undermine him or expose a vulnerability he couldn’t let slip; he straightened his spine, narrowed his eyes and sneered at the ginger, “Something the matter, Weasley?”
“Deal, same stakes then?” The two best friends shook hands and a green light passed through them, sealing the deal. This would be interesting.
” he cast Sabrina a look. “robes for school but how many do I need?” she really only required four, but she couldn’t decide between the formal robes she liked and well, Celeste bought all three that she liked. Harry suspected it was her way of making up for the fact that she’s away too much for work, so she always compensated with gifts and sweets whenever she was around.
“Oh my god Jasmine! JASMINE! Where is my baby? Honey?”
Harry sighed and leaned on the counter. Damn his prank failed, miserably if you may. Ever since he had discovered that he could do things that no one else could, he had been practicing so maybe he could make his life easier. It had started with little things, like, moving a piece of crumbled paper around the nursery school he attended with his cousin when he was four years old. He didn’t have friends, courtesy of Dudley; that bloody rhino kept telling everyone that he was a freak, that they should all keep a distance, and that he had a disease like his parents! So naturally everyone kept a safe distance from him, and Harry not having anyone to play with, passed the time by staring at inanimate objects and making a life story for them. There was this particular old chair that he deemed a celebrity among the other furniture, it was posh looking with burgundy cushions and yellow stripes on them so he had decided that it belonged in the Buckingham castle, but due to its ugly state it was kicked out and gifted to his school. Honestly it went pretty well with the ugly wall that was painted yellow because they were too cheap to clean the stains.
“No,” he said, perhaps a tad too forcefully. Draco gave a slight wince, and Harry’s heart twisted at the sight. He gently reached up to cup the Slytherin’s face. “No. Please, listen.”
Also, on a wholly unrelated note, I have a physics exam next week and I’m panicking.
Harry stared up into Draco’s bottomless eyes, and perhaps it was because his mind was still covered in a thick haze and thus effectively useless, or maybe just because Harry was Harry, the biggest idiot in the world, but he found himself saying weakly, “But…you were homophobic.”
if he agrees and says it’s fine…we go.
Ron still looked unconvinced, but eventually he gave a curt nod. He planted a quick peck on Hermione’s cheek, squeezing her shoulder once, then hurried back towards the door. He was already half-way over the threshold when he paused and turned back around.
Even if Draco weren’t so hyperaware of Harry at all times, the way the Gryffindor went completely still was unmissable. At the back of the room, Robards and the unnamed Auror exchanged a stony look and then left the room without another word, slamming the door shut behind them.
Perhaps a better description would be…exasperatedly affectionate. Or fondly frustrated.
Lovely. Just his fucking luck.
Unfortunately, that particular reaction sent yet another bolt of pain through his stomach—one that was, it should be stressed, much more intense than the previous few, almost like an internal stab wound—and he hissed involuntarily, hands immediately going to his stomach despite there being nothing they could possibly do.
But Yaxley simply tutted, while Draco (and Harry from across the alley) stared down at the blood soaking through his shirtsleeve. Merlin, it
Harry chuckled. “You’re honestly hopeless, you know that, right?” But, secretly, a part of him thought maybe Draco—obnoxious, arrogant, overbearing prick he may be—was right.
“Oh, sod right off,” Harry grumbled petulantly. Only he still hadn’t made any efforts to shake free of Draco’s loose embrace, so the latter didn’t fret much. “You’re evil, you know that?
“Hey,” said Harry softly, those dazzling green eyes of his already combing over Draco’s face, tone gentle but indisputably worried. “What’s wrong?”
;nothing about the use of his brain and taking advantage of Dudley’s stupidity.
A battered old hat on a stool awaited the incoming student at the center of the podium. The hat could be heard singing: “… Oh you may not think I'm pretty, but don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me…”
“Oi! You two stop taking a piss! Her room is around the corner!” Harry shouted at them and was met with a nurse’s icy glare. Oops. Better walk faster. The door to her room was open and Harry saw Brooke’s mum, Ms. Adkins, sitting on a chair by the window and typing furiously on her phone. Her red hair spilling around her in odd angles attesting to her staying by her daughter’s side every second.
harm him. Well she added that last part after Harry had proposed to make Dudley crazy by making him believe his room was hunted. “Okay, well try to think of a good one! After he threw his cranberry juice on your painting last Wednesday…..” she just shook her head madly.
Which resulted in Harry being slapped very roughly by his aunt and the four dishes and glasses on the way to the sink shattering on the floor. Dudley, trying to catch the floating dishes, cutt his foot on the crystals sprawled all around the floor. However, that wasn’t enough punishment; Vernon sat on a chair by the scene of the crime and berated Harry on his freakiness and disease, while watching Harry to see that he picked every single shard of glass by his hands and discarding them in a little bucket nearby. If he ever dared to do any sort of that magic voodoo like his sick, unstable parents, he will be shipped to a mental institution and straight into a straight-jacket.
As Harry was trying on different colored and styled robes, the two men kept going on about how Wizard clothing and fashion is frozen in time, harking back to the seventeenth century, when the magical community went into hiding from muggles. Mason thought that this nostalgic devotion to this old-fashioned form of dressing is a way to cling onto old ways and old times, and Noah argued that it was a matter of cultural pride. Both were very interesting points that Harry had never thought of until then.as they were poking and measuring various limbs Harry couldn’t help but notice in the mirror the way the two men worked around each other, completely in synch just like Celest and Laurent do, the rare moments when they are together, work had been demanding a lot of the trio's attention more than usual, something about a big show coming up and the winter line.
