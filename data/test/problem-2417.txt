As he focused on the light, a figure walked out from the forest edge. He could just barely make it out, but it seemed to be a dog. Massive like Fang but more shapely, trim where Hagrid’s big slobbering buddy was all wrinkles.
He had a dark circle under his eyes and a dull look to his skin that was a hallmark for a sleepless night. Where ever he had gone last night he must not have left early enough to change before coming here. What could he possibly be doing that it kept him out all night? The question was on the tip of his tongue, he wanted to ask it so badly but then again Ron and Hermione might just think he is obsessing again. Then they would just fret about him and not listen to him even if his concerns were valid.
At this point, Harry would have even been happy to be stuck in the humid greenhouse listening to lectures on proper watering techniques. Now though, probably brought on by the effects of war, Sprout had completely changed her teaching style. No longer were their hours spent in greenhouses tending to beautifully bloom poisons flowers. Now Students were expected to find their materials out in the real world.
He could hear mumbling, too faint to make out the words but it was there nonetheless. It was clearly a man’s voice, whoever they were talking to was either not responding or too quiet to be heard. There was only one set of shoe prints though. Something was not right.
“You’ll have to do is play me for it,” Harry announced, turning and heading down the hall, certain that Malfoy would follow him. Several seconds passed where he could hear nothing behind him, then a rustle of robes and fancy shoes on stone told him that Malfoy was hot on his tail.
“Yeah, Harry and I used it in our first year.” Ron threw him arm back, around her shoulders, leaning back with a look of waxing reminiscence on his face. “I remember now, I saw myself being a house boy and Quidditch Captain and winning the house cup.” The small smile on his lips was nostalgic in a way Harry wished he could be. Hermione was even smiling fondly, shaking her head good-naturedly.
Walking out into the lake, the water lapping at his chest, Harry came to a drop-off. With one last confident smile, he dived in headfirst. The air bubble quickly appeared around his head and he got a clear look into the lake. It was eerie as he remembered it from the Tri-Wizard tournament. It was like a murky film had developed over his vision making even his hands hard to see as he put them ahead to stroke.
“A better life.” He said completely devoid of feeling. His voice was so empty of emotions because they seemed trapped in his eyes, swirling around like a storm.
“Don’t you have an appointment with Madam Pomphrey?” He spat back, a small part of him taking pleasure in the annoyed snort Malfoy gave.
The duo launched off at the same moment, rushing into the air, high above everything else. The autumn air felt amazing as it whipped wildly through Harry’s hair. Nothing felt better than being high in the sky, above it all, looking down at the rolling hills of the Scottish countryside. Harry and Malfoy circle each other in an unchoreographed but intricate dance.
“I’ll beat you into next year.” Harry couldn't hold back the full belly laugh that though brought him.
“The Aurors are still having problems pinning down several Death Eater cells. The paper is trying to pin it all on Ministry failures.”
“We are sorry Professor.” Luna apologized. He hummed, not really accepting the apology.
years. It took a moment but slowly everyone started to clean up their workspaces, carefully take their cauldrons to the side of the room and make sure they knew when they needed to come back and work more.
Amongst the commotion Harry stood up, looking at Hermione, he told her, “I am going to find him.”
“N… Yes Sir.” Ron stammered unprepared to be confronted by the new teacher on his first day.
“Go Die, Potter.” Was the last angry scream he heard from Malfoy as he slipped back out of the Room of Requirements.
Harry's cheeks grew hot with an embarrassed flush. Ron’s ears became a flaming red that blended in with his hair. Seeing their reaction Hermione gave another sigh “…boys…” Hermione went back to mumbling to herself, “I feel like I read something about it, something about it having a ‘controlling power’ or something.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione gave him a perturbed look, snapping her heavy textbook shut. She was worried, she was always worried. It was something Harry both adored and loathed, she cared so much that sometimes she couldn’t not fret.
“True. There was an op-ed in it last week hinting at a big government conspiracy over it.” Hermione conceded in a tone that belied her utter contempt for the idea.
years and I have heard,” He shot Harry a singularly chilling glare. Harry could feel the questioning glances of his classmates, “that you lot want to be treated like adults, because you’ve seen and done it all, right?” He pointed the question at Parvati like she was the spokesperson for her grade. No one moved, hanging by a tight string just waiting to see what he would do. When she didn’t respond right away, Professor Davies gestured bigger and scrunched his brow like he was readying to a fight.
As Harry and Neville, shifted the body back and forth, trying to get a better idea of what happened, Luna grabbed Neville’s shoulder. Her voice was tense, having lost of its breathy airs she was known for, “Neville… What happened to the birds?” A chill ran down Harry’s spine. The birds were silent. Gone or silenced, he couldn’t hear their obnoxious background singing that had been pulsing in his head. Straining his ears he couldn’t hear a thing. The Forest was instantly deadly silent.
“I should be the one asking that question, Malfoy,” Harry demanded, refusing to lower his wand even a centimeter. He may look a mess but Malfoy was still a threat, Harry didn't care if he seemed to be falling apart at the seams.
“Do you want it or not?” Harry demanded, getting a little fed up with Malfoy’s fussiness, “It seemed like it was important to you okay… Just… Just tell me what it is and I’ll give it to you.”
“Fear propaganda?” Ron asked it was well known to the trio that the Prophet more than dabbled in fear-mongering when they had something to gain. Journalistic ethics tended to take a back seat to fear and rumor if it sells more copies.

years, those who came back at least. To find an empty alcohol bottle or two, drank not in the throws of a party but in a secret late-night binge, under the common room beds was not an uncommon occurrence.
“The mirror?”
A great column of billowing smoke stretched high into the sky, small tendrils peeling apart between the branches before marching once again with the larger mass. The grays and whites are clean and controlled, most likely a bonfire rather than raging forest fire that would cause concern. Hagrid must be in the woods, burning something.
Seconds, minutes, or hours pass. It is hard to tell. There is no movement on the map and Harry doesn’t want to pull his eyes away long enough to seek out his watch.
When he opens them again, he notices something off in the distance, deep in the forbidden forest.
Harry simply nodded, “Couldn’t sleep.” She raised a glass to him, a small cheer in support, her friend doing the same. Many portraits didn’t seem to sleep much anymore. Those who survived the wreckage were hyper-focused and seemed to deem themselves the front-line security for the entire castle.
When Harry can't sleep he heads to a place that knows how to give him what he needs. It seems though, he isn't the only one up and about.
floor. Taking them two at a time he made it all the way, past the gossiping paintings and meandering ghosts, to the 4rth floor before running into another living person.
“Break rules already?”
Harry had lost track of how many passageways they had turned down. Every hall was empty, not a single perfect, teacher or ghost crossed their paths. Malfoy didn’t seem to hesitate at all, not a care for being caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, Malfoy started scaling the stairs. The stairs were currently latched onto an east-facing upper corridor. Harry waited till he was over halfway up the stairs before coming out from the shadows to follow.
“Confringo!” An explosion of red-hot embers bounced off the side of the cabinet, the spark taking and lighting the already burnt wood up one more time. Whoever fired the curse at him kept going, “Confringo! Confringo! Confringo!” All around him objects sparked and sizzled, burning ash landing on his skin in small sharp pains. Forgetting stealth all together Harry ran.
“You’ve had a lot of those Harry. It isn’t healthy.”
“You’re not going to find the snitch if you keep staring at me, Potter,” Malfoy yelled, smiling wildly, in a teasing tone.
“You alright there, Mate?” Ron asked, finally releasing several strands of Hermione’s hair he seemed fascinated with to eat his own meal.
Harry sat across from them, reaching for a severing plate of toast. He could just catch the headlines as Hermione readjust the paper to read easier.
It's becoming clear that Malfoy is struggling against a powerful obsession with the Mirror. For some reason, that Harry can not really verbalize, this bothers him. Is it his savior complex or something else?
“We were looking for Living Stones for Herbology, Professor,” Harry admitted, slowly standing up, his muscles burning from overuse.
“What about it.” She retorted, not even bothering to lower her voice. “If he wanted to do that, he has had plenty of opportunities to do it. There is no reason for him to try some convoluted secretive plot if the fingers going to be pointed at him anyways. He might as well just use an Unforgivable in the Great Hall. Either way, he ends up getting the kiss.” She said with finality, setting her heavy books down on a desk and taking a seat. Ron settled next to her, giving Harry a ‘what can you do’ kind of shrug.
“While I don’t disagree with you on his methods being… crass. He doesn’t seem to play favorites as Snape did.”
“Yeah…” He tried to hand it over but Malfoy refused to take it.
“What do you see?” Harry had to ask. He couldn’t come this far and not feed his curiosity.
A horn blasted, water deep based sound that Harry felt more than heard. The mermaid, distracted, turned its attention away for just the briefest of seconds. Seeing his chance Harry stunned the creature and raced for the surface. Scratching was all around him as he managed to make it to the rocky edge and drag himself out of the water.
Rolling his eyes Harry actually went to grab Malfoys hands, trying to force the pendant into it, “Who said I want anything.” Why couldn’t he just take the damn thing and stop being a Git?
gear. Fresh-faced first years talked excitably, about every new magical detail they just discovered in the last 24 hours, washing out the more mellow slower tones of 7
“Stalking me now, are we?” Malfoy looked unimpressed, with the haughty air that clings to him like a stench. Hearing the term stalking made Harry’s hackles raise, he wasn’t stalking. He wasn’t obsessed with Malfoy; he was just keeping tabs on a potential enemy. Why could no one else see that?
Was emblazed in the 130-point font on the front of her paper, accompanied by a photo of a tired and frustrated looking Shacklebot, snapped at a press meeting. He was standing to the side of the podium as an aid spoke, light bulbs flashed in his eyes as he looked side to side not saying anything before closing his eyes and giving a sigh. He looked as if he had aged years in only months.
Malfoy is hot on his tail, banging their shoulders together trying to jostle Harry off his broom. He could feel the heat coming off the other both as they both pushed themselves and their brooms to go faster. The Snitch ascended upwards and the pair followed. Just as Harry was about the wrap his hands around it, the tricky ball instant plummeted back to the ground, slipping through both their hands. Malfoy quickly courses correctly to the left and Harry to the right dropping lower to the ground.
“So?”
As soon as the door closed Harry felt his throat tighten, the urge to cough flooding his system. Throwing his hands over his mouth, he tries his best to not make an audible noise, trying to breathe through the thick dusty smell of ash. Each breath burned his nostrils like coarse salt water accidentally inhaled. Eyes tearing up, the space around him blurred slightly but it was all too obvious where he was.
“You wish, Potter.” The venom in his voice was thick. His eyes though flare with the challenge, a sudden bit of life coming back to his expression. “I could fly circles around you.”
Malfoy was covered in blacked smoke, the edges of his hair burnt, his cauldron nearly melted from the heat it was trying to contain. Professor Davies waved his wand, instantly evaporating the smoke and cooling cauldron. Then he turned his fury on Malfoy, “What did you do?”
“Or what Malfoy?” Harry straightened his wand arm, pressing it right into Malfoy's chest, bringing to attention the fact that he was ready to magic Malfoy into submission. Malfoy didn’t even have his wand near him, it was left on the floor in his haste to stand up. Though he didn't seem to be thinking about that. His behavior was erratic.
Drifting around the pitch, Harry scanned the skies, but constantly his eyes kept coming back to Malfoy. There was grace in the way that flew about, his broom seeming like an extension of his body, moving with a ballerina’s fluidity. Harry would be lying if he didn’t admit that Malfoy made flying look easy. Even from their first lessons, when he took off practically standing on the bristles, Malfoy had an air of confidence and control that was enviable.
Shoving the map into his bag, hiding it out of view, Harry shakes his head, “You guys go ahead; I need to go take a nap or something.” He tried to lie convincingly. Ron simply shrugged not bothered in the slightest.
“Ron, do you really think he deserves Azkaban for doing nothing more than looking at a mirror?”
Harry was disquieted by his own lack of interest in anything not pertaining to Malfoy or the mirror. Every night he would try in vain to get a few hours of sleep when all his mind wanted to do was stare at the map. It raced with questions about what was happening, what was going on, who was awake, were the teachers monitoring the hall, had they caught on to Malfoy going to the 7
“Mreow.” At the end of the hall sat Mrs. Norris, pinning Harry with her lamp-like eyes, seeming as though she had been set there all night simply waiting for him to show up. Leaning against the wall, messing with the candle inside his old rusty lantern was Filch. His head popped up instantly at his partner’s meows.
“But you won.”
“…Yes?”
“I am no-“
The bruises on his knuckle only just start to heal, turning from inky black blue into bile yellow, when Harry starts to monitor the hallway to the Room of Requirements. He begins to carry the Marauders Map around with him wherever he goes. Pulling it out whenever given a free moment to seek out one name, Draco Malfoy.
“Maybe Neville, let me think about it. Thank you…” A glint of bright white caught his attention from the corner of his eye. Whipping his head around, Harry realized it was Malfoy entering the Great Hall. He looked as if he was wearing the same robes he had on last night, a prominent layer of dust clinging to it. Even in robes that surely would be dreamed ‘a disgrace to the Malfoy name’, Malfoy strode through the Hall, head held high as if he owned the place.
“Naturally? So, your saying something killed it.” Harry watched as Luna nodded, delicately brushing away stray bits of kelp off the body. “Whatever did this must have been vicious” Harry added, harrowing memories of desperately swimming to dodge carnivores sharp teethed merpeople. They hunted like a pack of bloodhounds, chasing him around the lake floor like a scared fox.
and went into great detail about the book in his letters to Harry.
No one else seemed to pay him any attention as he sat down at the mostly empty Slytherin table. There was at least a 10 ft gap between him and all other of his housemates. A space that wasn’t hard to maintain simply because of the sheer lacking of students at the table. All of the Hogwarts houses were smaller than they had been in generations, it was inevitable between the death toll and terrified parents who felt the school was no longer safe after Dumbledore’s death. The space of missing students at each table had a visual weight, but none was stronger than the sheer void that was the Slytherin table. Simply no one was left in Slytherin.
Draco is pretty sure he’s in an alternate dimension. Harry did not say that. Did he?
He’s out the door before Draco can protest about reasonable amounts of sugar, so he resigns himself to grabbing the softest blanket and putting on the cheesiest movie he can find.
“Why?”
“Would you like some tart, Harry?” Says Draco, trying to keep his voice neutral.
Draco splutters for a minute, under the amused look of Teddy, before gaping and, to his own surprise, saying, “Not precisely.”
“No need,” replies Teddy with a dismissive hand gesture, “he put in under a stasis, said it would still be good for a couple of hours.”
“Eh… Sure.”
“Ugh, why do we have friends?” Draco complains.
Draco looks taken aback for a second, but recovers quickly and says, voice soft as silk, "Only if you're a good boy."
cupcakes, if only to spend the butter, which means Harry has to change the main course to something lighter or they’re going to end up eating cupcakes for a couple of days —Draco’s croissants are a bit of a favourite within their friends, so Harry doesn’t get his hopes up on getting some of those left.
Draco just sits there, waiting.
“Don’t be so dense, Draco,” says the boy, exasperation rolling out of him. “What are you and Harry fighting about?”
“What about?”
Ten minutes later, Harry purses his lips at the opening of Wimbledon and lets Draco drape himself on his front, taking a pointed bite of his brownie.
“Ha! Wouldn’t that be an interesting role-play,” laughs Harry.
“Ever since we got together you have rejected all my attempts to make things between us physical beyond a kiss on the cheek.” The hysteria is getting to Draco too. “Harry, we live in the same flat and sleep in different rooms.”
want brownies.” Draco snorts. “And,” he continues pointedly, “I’m getting the ones with dulce de leche.”
"Don't worry, Draco, you would be the first one to know when I find a lover," says Harry with a wink.
Harry takes his hands and cradles them to his chest, looking softly at Draco.
“We’re not fighting!” He protests. Teddy gives him a look that says
“Harry, just don’t.” The exhaustion in Draco’s voice is enough to stick Harry to his chair.
“Why would you think that throwing sex innuendos around would hurt me?” He’s getting more confused by the second, it seems.
“Me?!” Squeaks Teddy from the other side of the kitchen, conveniently perched on the stool farthest from Draco, trying and failing to suppress a smile.
He hears the soft casting of an
Teddy nearly spits out his tea.
Finally, Harry holds both of his wrists in one of his hands —the sight makes Draco weak on the knees, his mind flying with all the possibilities— and holds them to his chest, pulling their faces closer.
Yes, he’s aware that he’s starting to sound a little manic. But, c’mon. Twenty five pounds of butter. That’s enough to feed all the Weasleys for like two weeks. He’s about to tell Harry exactly that when a giggle interrupts him.
“I wanna make clear that I’m going to Lola’s because
Draco pulls back with an airy laugh and flickers his wand towards the stove to turn it on.
Draco perks up, scooting closer to Harry to pick him on the ribs until he’s squirming —he could stop him if he really wanted, but Draco relishes in the fact that he doesn’t. “Well,” he says, barely avoiding the hand trying to catch his, “I was thinking we could watch something on Netflix and stuff ourselves with ice-cream.”
“So,” begins Harry in between giggles, “you’re telling me that you’ve been under the impression that I’m asexual for, how long?”
“Sounds good to me,” says in a pant. “I’ll even let you pick the movie if you stop being a bloody menace for the day.”
“Whoa, whoa, hold up. Harry’s not gonna leave you, he’s so absurdly in love with you I don’t think he would know how to just be without you.”
The bang of the door closing gets him out of his slumber, and he sighs heavily as he levitates his plate and some stray dishes to the dishwasher before walking to the studio —it’s just an extra room where he has put a desk and some shelves for his, but mostly Draco’s books.
Harry sits rigidly on the chair next to Draco and watches as a knife, a plate and a fork float from the cabinet, slice and serve a healthy piece of still-warm tart. He starts eating in silence forking his way through almost the whole piece before looking up and locking his gaze with Draco’s soft one.
and raises an eyebrow, clearly waiting for something else. “We’re not. We just… had a bit of a disagreement yesterday.”
“Oh, are you cooking?”
“So this
“I mean, with you being somewhere in the ace-aro spectrum-”
Harry’s cheeks start to hurt from the smile permanently on his face. He’s a little bit more than fascinated with the way they move around each other, anticipating moves and words, like they have been doing this relationship thing for a while instead of just hours —which is true in theory, but still.
“Yes, for the past eighteen months, as I just told you not that long ago,” Draco feels like they’re talking in circles. Harry’s answering silence makes fear crawl up Draco’s spine. His voice is small when he asks, “Aren’t we?”
Draco huffs, as if he would ever let Harry pick the movie.
Draco scowls at him. “I know, Ted, no need to remind me.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?!”
“Craving something specific?”
“You okay, love?”
Teddy gives him something really close to a pity look, a few locks of his hair turning dark blue —clear sign of discomfort.
are gonna love it?” He has a smug grin on his face, he knows, but the expression on Draco’s face every time he has the curry is in the top five of the most lovely —and indecent— facial expressions Harry has seen.
They’re finishing lunch —some lasagna sent by Molly around noon— and going over the menu for their turn at the biweekly Friday get-together, per Draco’s request. He insists on making croissants
Breakfast is a tense affair, with Draco and Harry each on opposite sides of the table avoiding each other’s eyes and giving short, distracted answers at Teddy’s attempts to carry a conversation. Harry is the first one to finish eating, leaving the table before anyone can say a thing.
“My my, Draco, did you fight a vampire last night?” Asks Dean with a smirk.
— head and runs a hand down his spine, squeezing a cheek and rolling them to get on top. Draco looks like a grumpy kitten, his hair sticking in every other direction and his eyes puffy from sleep.
Harry's fairly used to Draco making this kind of comments —along with the pet names and the casual touches—but he still promptly chokes with a bite of lasagna. He's coughing so hard, he feels like he's gonna spit a lung any second now.
“Yes,” Draco stretches full on the bed, the sheets uncovering his hip. “Now we’re talking love.”
“Shocking as it is, I had already figured that out. But it’s so hard to get him to talk to me. Sometimes I wonder if he’s just waiting for a chance to leave me or something.”
“If it weren’t for the fact that I really want you to fuck me, I would kick your balls until you cried.”
Draco hums non-committedly, still petting his neck. There's a few beats of silence before he takes his hand back, picks up his plate and walks to the sink, regret etched on the lines of his forehead.
“I’ve wanted it for so long, Draco. To shag you, to…” He hesitates.
Harry is at loss for words, frozen looking at the lines of Draco’s back as he grabs the counter and breathes deeply a few times.
“Nah, I just know you.”
“Hopes of what?”
“Don’t you dare laugh about this Ted, you’re not precisely innocent either.”
“I’m not having this conversation with you!” Draco is practically screaming.
They spend the next few hours finishing the food for their friends and charming furniture around to fit everyone.
“You want to shag me?”
He turns back to Harry, his frown melting to a fond smile when confronted with the sight of Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, the Saviour himself, fidgeting with the sleeves of his cardigan and looking, by all means, like a kicked puppy.
“Thanks, love,” Draco’s voice is barely above a whisper.
“Usually, I’m all for letting couples figure their shit on their own, but the two of you are looking like someone killed your Kneazle and really fucking bad at communicating. So, what the fuck is up?”
“Of course!” Teddy’s words, along with the loving look he gives him, help Draco let go of some of the irrational fear that was clinging to his heart.
Then, “I’m not asexual. I just didn’t want to get my hopes up.”
He cleans his mouth hastily and starts gaping like a fish, trying and failing to say something.
“Thanks, Ted, I’ll heat it up later.”
Draco hums, blinking slowly. He moves his hands to play with Harry’s hair and says, “Do we really have to get up?”
“Do you mean
Harry blushes at that. Draco kisses him, hard.
“C’mon! Guys, dinner? Please?” Teddy is essentially growling at this point.
, no matter how close they are. Apparently, he doesn’t need to say anything, as Teddy is humming in understanding and motioning for him to elaborate.
Harry Potter was a mess. Lovely, cuddly, soft and nice; but still a mess. That was no news to Draco, and yet here he was, surprised once more by the amount of things that could —and would, knowing his luck— go wrong when one lived with Harry Potter.
“Yeah, I-I’m fine. I just…” He exhales soundly, his warm breath on Draco’s neck raising goosebumps. “What are you talking about?”
"Said he was tired," he mumbles. When Harry doesn't reply, he adds, "Went straight to his room."
Harry shrugs, not meeting his eyes, and mumbles, "Didn't think it was that important… I mean, you just wrote 'Butter' on the list."
"I'm sorry, babe. Didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
Harry interrupts his rambling putting a hand up. Draco looks at him as he stands and starts pacing the kitchen, hands on his hair and a slight manic expression on his face. After a few laps, he stops in front of Draco, takes a deep breath and laughs. Huge belly laughs that double him over and have him grasping the table for support.
As if being summoned by thinking of him, Teddy storms into the studio and hops on the desk.
“O… kay,” replies Harry with a confused chuckle. “So, do you have plans for the day?”
On their way to Harry’s room, Draco makes sure to knock on Teddy’s door and says, “You might want to go back to your nan’s, Ted, I’m getting eighteen months worth of sex today!”
"Since you're so interested in dinner, Ted, why don't you help me cut up the veggies?" Says Draco in a fake-sweet voice.
“Oh, yeah, all that love for me,” replies Harry coming closer again.
Later that night, when there’s just a few people around, Harry is cuddling a tipsy Draco and chatting with Dean. Something he says makes Draco laugh loudly, his head thrown back and his neck exposed.
“Always have been,” says Harry over his shoulder, closing the door of the ensuite.
His words are met with more silence and a minuscule nod.
“Sounds amazing.” He rolls out of bed with one last peck. “I’ll take a quick shower and make you pancakes while you shower.”
Harry blushes. Draco laughs so hard he falls to the floor.
He looks around and can’t believe he really thought his relationship with Draco was platonic.
"Yeah, ok. So what am I supposed to do with a hundred bars of butter? Do you know how many croissants I would have to bake to use twenty five pounds of butter?”
“Care to elaborate?”
“Oh…” Draco panics a little. “W-would you rather not put a label on it? ‘Cause that’s fine too, it’s just easier for me to understand it under certain terms-”
and then there's a cup in front of him and a soft hand on the back of his neck, rubbing soothingly.
“Are you trying to break up with me? You’re making it terribly confusing and unnecessarily painful.”
Harry chuckles at Teddy’s antics and goes to unpack the rest of the bags, boxes and cans floating through the kitchen to their respective cabinets. After a bit of rummaging he holds up a bottle of wine and raises his eyebrows at Draco in a silent question.
“I am looking. And it isn’t pretty,” Harry said.
“Oh,” Harry reluctantly picked up the bundle and glanced around. “Er, where do I go to uh…?”
“In that case, can you not halt the deterioration and store what’s left?” Asherath asked.
“Of course, towards the end, they were mostly killing their own,” Lestrange laughed from the cell next to Harry. Harry felt a little sick at the thought regardless of who the victims were.
“Mr. Potter was imprisoned without a trial, and subsequently kept in an unsafe environment for weeks. While there, he was not only permanently marked with an Azkaban serial number, but sexually assaulted by one guard. The other guards did not heal his injuries until I insisted,” Hale counted off the ministry’s offenses. “Furthermore, he was denied his right to attend his own trial-”
“People that
Burke turned to Harry, looking horrified. Harry didn’t know if Burke realized it was Harry or just his own worst memories had started playing in his mind. The more scared Burke got, the more giddy Harry became. Harry knew it was only a fraction of the joy the dementors got when they did this. They pulled a person’s good memories towards them like a damn appetizer before they claimed their soul. This left the dementors all warm and fuzzy while their victims were left with their worst feelings and drowned in misery. It incapacitated them long enough for dementors to pull out their vulnerable souls.
“It’s a place to start,” Hale offered. Harry thanked him but was boggled by how Hale thought this was only the start. There was so much information on the scroll that Harry didn’t know how he’d address it all, let alone whatever else Hale thought he might need to look into.
“An understandable reaction. An exaggerated one that many of us might use when hearing such a story. If anyone here says they don’t want retribution, they are either lying or heartless,” Hale boldly stated. Despite how uncomfortable Harry felt, he relaxed as Hale brought the topic back in the direction Harry was aiming for when he decided to share.
“Yes?” Harry said, though he could understand why she was concerned. He and Draco did not have a great history, so he wasn’t surprised when she just scoffed in response.
There was a small debate amongst the wizengamot about whether or not the guards would have thought Harry was escaping, but fortunately one witch called a stop to it rather quickly. “It doesn’t matter what they would have done. Potter didn’t think they would help, so he asked the dementor for help instead,” she summed up and pressed them to move on.
“Of course, Harry. I wouldn’t expect any less from one of my star pupils!” Slughorn complimented. Harry smiled until the professor moved on to check on someone else’s potion. With Slughorn out of the way, Harry noticed Zabini had been watching the exchange. He raised his eyebrows at Harry. Harry’s attempts at manipulation were probably too blunt for a seasoned Slytherin, but Slughorn’s ego was big enough that it worked. Still, Harry blushed at being caught, though he only sent a shrug as a response.
“Clothes next,” stated Anton and Harry flinched as the silence was suddenly broken.
“What?” Harry asked surprised.
benefit from the defense review.
“Are you here about my letter?” Harry asked once the standard pleasantries were done.
Despite more or less bearing his soul to Albert and Lucius, Harry did not improve his occlumency skills. He always ended up with a major headache and couldn’t prevent them from entering his mind any more than he could stop Snape. At least they were careful and considerate as they picked at his memories. They also waited until Harry recovered before trying again. Regrettably for Harry, this was one skill he simply lacked.
“We’d all been wearing it for awhile. I think it siphoned off energy or magic or something from us,” Harry said.
“Shouldn’t you be in class?” Harry asked. He wasn’t surprised to see Ron and Neville skip, but it had to be a first for Hermione.
“Right, well, common,” Theo said impatiently and the others couldn’t miss his excitement. He started to walk away, and Harry was glad to see the others follow. Theo brought them to an empty classroom. After quickly scanning it to ensure no one was there, he announced, “this will do,” and looked at Harry expectantly.
Harry looked at him helplessly. “I need to...” Harry trailed off, but glanced towards the toilet in the corner of his cell. When he glanced back at Nott and Malfoy, it was clear that they both understood his problem. It was also clear that they both could clearly see him if he went to the bathroom now. Harry realized he has yet to see either of them go. He wasn’t sure if Azkaban’s diet contributed to constipation or if both men managed to do their business when he was asleep. Harry wished he could train his body to wait until the dead of the night. Unfortunately, he didn’t think he could hold it in for much longer.
The dementors glanced at each other for a long moment. As they seemed to silently debate something between themselves, the moans of the other prisoners echoed down the hallway. Harry couldn’t stop himself from shivering. Eventually they turned their attention back to him.
“Yeah, he... likes you,” Draco said. Harry wanted to ask what exactly Lucius had said, but the blush that formed on Draco’s cheeks stopped him. Almost crying aside, the conversation was going remarkably well considering their history. Harry didn’t want to push and ruin it. He was happy enough to assume Lucius had written good things if Draco’s impression was that his dad liked him.
Harry was glad that it was Perkins joining them. Even though Perkins had made it obvious that he wasn’t going to stop this from happening, he was marginally better than Bradley. Harry would rather have the almost ally than two men who clearly hated him.
I hope no one feels Harry is too OOC. I figure he’s quiet here because of shock and fear. Also, he’s not always good about sticking up for himself. If they had arrested some of his friends with him then he might have fought more or tried to escape. I’ll try to bring in sassy Harry later on once he’s grown accustomed to the situation.
Hale, Runecraft, and Scrimgeour circled around the issue a few more times, essentially stating the same things again and again until another wizengamot member cut in.
Harry had just finished performing the blood magic needed to make the mirror permanent when the door at the end of the hallway opened. The prisoners began whimpering as their dreams turned into nightmares. Harry braced himself for seeing a dementor for the first time since the incident. He hoped he’d finally get some answers.
"I would have though Mulciber would be a rabbit given he's always randy," joked Harry. "Are you the kind of rabbit with the floppy ears or straight ones?"
,” Draco said. He moved away from the comfort of his fiancés’ arms so that he could look into Harry’s eyes. “I know the ritual to create a horcrux.”
Harry watched his son with a bit of wonder. Hermione assured him that James was healthy, and the others all took turns filling him in on what he’d missed. George tried to claim he was James’ favourite uncle, but Ron had protested claiming he’d always be the favourite because he was also his godfather.
Harry second-guessed how wise it was to open up to the press as he walked up to them. This man looked to be the opposite of Rita Skeeter’s in-your-face personality, but that did little to put him at ease. Harry didn’t have a good track record with the press, and it was hard to forget that even though he was the one to request the interview. He knew that whatever would be printed from this meeting, even if it portrayed Harry favourably, would result in the school gossiping about him. They hadn’t exactly stopped watching him, but the novelty of his return had finally started to wear off. He didn’t want to regain that attention.
“I don’t know. The dementors don’t usually linger,” countered Malfoy.
“Bloody hell,” Harry stated once the court proceedings were finally adjourned.
“Of course not,” Dumbledore said good-naturedly. “In fact, we should probably head there now,” he added and subtly gestured to the crowd of reporters that were barely being held back from swarming Harry by some harried ministry workers.
where one man would demonstrate to another in the cell in front of him. It slowly moved diagonally until Harry would see for himself the wand movements. He rather hoped nothing got lost as it moved from man to man. He wouldn’t put it past the Lestrange brothers to purposely screw it up.
“That’s Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott,” Harry told him.
“If you’re saying you can’t handle it...” Snape hedged.
It was a ludicrous suggestion. Harry might have grown to like Crabbe and vice versa, but the man’s wife would have no reason to believe so. She was unlikely to give Harry books from their personal collection. And yet, Harry believed Crabbe was genuine in his offer. It brought tears to his eyes. How could this man, a death eater, so readily offer Harry help when it was his lord’s soul Harry was carrying? And Crabbe made this suggestion in front of his fellow death eaters. More shocking was that no one, not even the overzealous Lestrange brothers were calling foul on Crabbe’s offer. Even after Lestrange’s bleak prediction that it couldn’t be undone, Crabbe’s instinct was to offer support to try to spare Harry this fate. It made Harry’s belief that Dumbledore was not doing the same all the more painful.
“I imagine your parents would be so disappointed,” Burke continued.
“I know,” Draco interrupted softly.
“Regardless of their motivation, they will provide food. But all other creature comforts are hit and miss,” Lucius stated.
“They would have to explain why it was used if they want any replacement potions.”
It turned out that Lucius had excellent timing, as less than an hour later the guards guided Harry towards the meeting room.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore said happily. “I’m sure Miss Granger has kept a list of all the homework assignments you missed. You’ll be back on track in no time.”
No idea if 77K galleons (£232035.44 according to an online converter I found) is enough compensation for what Harry went through by court standards. It probably varies by country, and who knows what the wizarding world standards would be. If Dumbledore had been representing him, the headmaster would have been satisfied with just getting Harry acquitted. However Hale is one of the best lawyers money can buy... he probably would have asked for even more money, but this amount isn't arbitrary. I got plans for what Harry will do with it ;) *tease tease tease*
give. He supposed it wouldn’t hurt to create something and decide if it was worthy later.
“I thought you said it was an unforgivable curse,” Malfoy drawled, still amused. Harry was thrown by how much Lucius reminded him of Draco in that moment.
“My dormmate has had it in our room for two years now,” Harry explained.
“Oh! In that case, Luci could tell you about his favourite poisons,” cackled Rodolphus.
“Dumbledore will get me out,” Harry said with a confidence he didn’t feel.
Harry left the meeting feeling a lot lighter. As with all good things in Azkaban, it didn’t last long. When they passed the room where Harry was forced to get his prison tattoo, he noticed that a couple of guards where there with Albert. His fellow prisoner looked confused. Harry recalled the warning about guards tampering with prisoners’ memories so that they couldn’t share the atrocities they suffered with under their care. He was considerably happier that he gave Hale his memory. When the other man realized that Albert was unable to relay what Harry had witnessed, he would realize Albert’s memories had been tampered with. Harry was confident the judicial-wizard would use it as another nail in the ministry’s coffin.
Once they were back in their cells, Mulciber confirmed that the wards in his cell worked. Albert asked Harry to transfigure some rocks into parchment and a quill so he could create quizzes as Harry had carelessly suggested. The rocks were not the ideal material to use for transfiguring into parchment or quills, but Harry had enough power to push his will into the spell.
“It is,” Harry said miserably, but couldn’t elaborate. “You should hate me.”
“I owe you an apology. I have failed you. I suspect it has been multiple times over the years,” McGonagall said.
Harry shivered at the mention of dementors. He’d somehow forgotten about them and wondered if he was feeling so cold because some of those creatures were close. It was an unpleasant reminder that there were worse things in this place than Burke and his unsettling smirks.
“I don’t know,” responded Harry. He was pretty sure the answer was no but didn’t want to talk about it.
“They won’t let it go any time soon,” Draco warned. He said it in such a matter-of-fact tone that Harry didn’t take offense. He mostly just felt worried about the lingering stares, questions, and comments that he would have to continue to deal with indefinitely. Harry wondered how much Draco had dealt with after Lucius was arrested.
“What?” he asked blankly. The entire hall was so silent that Harry heard his own heartbeat. It was pounding in his chest.
Instead of elaborating, Harry push over a scroll with the theory he had managed to work out last night. “I tried this last night, but it didn’t work,” Harry said. He had tried again in the morning, roughly around the time he thought the prisoners would be eating breakfast, but nothing had happened. Harry only saw himself reflected, and frankly he was tired of looking at his own reflection.
He started simple. He transfigured the rock into a pot, and then filled the pot with soil. He weaved transfigured rocks into something resembling a flower. All in all, it was a decent looking fake plant, but Harry wasn’t satisfied. It was something he could have easily made in his third year. He knew Crabbe would be happy with the gesture, but he wanted to give the man something that properly expressed his gratitude. And the little boy that had been starved for affection from the Dursleys wanted to show that he is worth all of the effort they put into teaching him.
“Would it help to see my memory of that night? Well, er, parts of it anyway?” Harry asked. He knew the full scene of that night might work against Albert and the others, but Harry could concentrate on a few moments that were tame or supported Hale’s angle.
“You have no proof of that,” said Runecraft.
“True,” Harry said and held out the mirror for Draco to take. “You’ll need to time it when the guards aren’t there, but you can pretty much talk to your dad at almost any time of day.”
“If it was my underage son in this shithole, I would hope someone would do the same,” Nott responded.
“But?” Harry prompted when he deduced there was something Draco debated mentioning.
“The dementor kissed Burke,” she pressed on.
Harry could do nothing as Burke carved the runes and numbers into his neck. He stared over Burke’s shoulder at a spot on the wall and tried to ignore everything. It wasn’t the pain so much as the fact that he felt helpless. He couldn’t stop them, and if Burke was telling the truth, he wouldn’t ever be able to remove it. Even when Dumbledore rescued him – if Dumbledore rescued him – Harry would never be able to truly put it behind him. The tattoo would always be a part of him.
Harry was led to a room not far from where he was given his tattoo. As they approached the door, Harry noted that there was a large window that allowed anyone in the hallway to look into the room. Harry noted that a man was already waiting in the room and had a bunch of items laid out on a table in front of him. Harry only had enough time to notice the camera before he was being pulled forward.
“Look, I’m never going to think you’ll find someone as good as Ginny... but that doesn’t mean you have to be alone the rest of your life,” Ron elaborated.
“Are you sure?” Hale had asked when Harry slipped him the letter. “Considering why you’re in here...”
They made their way down a long hallway until they came to a branch. Bright light was coming from the right side and Burke lead the party down that hallway. The light was giving the place a more uplifting feeling, but Harry’s spirits crashed again before he was able to even start to relax. He saw a sign that said “Criminal Processing”.
Harry let Draco take the ring from him. His breath hitched a second time that night when Draco got on bended knee with the ring held up as an offering.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry looked down at the clothes in shock.
“Yes, so
Harry’s testimony was set to take place after two ministry workers were questioned. The two of them had been present the night of Albert’s arrest, and were asked a series of questions that had them confirming Albert had been arrested while in a Death Eater’s uniform, and they later saw his Dark Mark. Despite the damning evidence, Hale did not seem worried. When he was allowed to question them, he asked them about the other Death Eaters’ behaviour that night, especially Bellatrix’s, and contrasted it to Albert’s less enthusiastic demeanor.
Not even an hour after breakfast, the prisoners were herded into the showers. Harry knew something was going on because the guards usually allowed them a shower in the afternoon. They also rushed the prisoners, telling them to wrap up even before the water naturally went cold. As they were ushered back to the cells, a guard told Harry to remain in the hallway. Lucius gave him a final pat on the shoulder, and Harry was suddenly alone in the hallway with several guards. One guard cuffed his hands behind his back, and they led him out.
About 40 minutes into Lucius’ systematic review of charms, they heard the door at the end of the hall open. Feeling panicked, Harry recalled the heat he had spread out to the other cells. He heard Crabbe and the Lestrange brothers whine at the sudden drop in temperature and softly apologized.
“It’s... mostly accurate... but your dad has an advantage. His, er, peacock,” Harry cringed as soon as it was out of his mouth. He was trying to be discrete in case someone was sneaking around nearby, like they had been doing all day. Instead, he just made it sound like he was using inappropriate euphemisms.
Evenings were spent casually conversing. Occasionally someone would ask Harry about his life, but often the men seemed inclined to share details about their lives. Harry tended to pay more attention whenever Lucius or Crabbe talked about their sons. Harry thought it was because he knew Draco and Vincent, though both Lucius and Albert noticed Harry perked up more whenever Draco was mentioned. Harry became suspicious when Albert started asking Lucius questions about Draco, successfully steering the conversation back to Harry’s rival. It seemed especially odd given that Albert rarely talked about his own son. Whenever Harry asked a question about Theodore, Albert would merely say something along the lines of his son was a smart and capable boy. It left Harry with the impression that Albert didn’t spend much time with his son. It was odd given how much fatherly interest Albert was showing Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re not on trial here-” Hawkworth said.
“What did he do though?” asked the first man. “I wasn’t even aware he was standing trial. Bloody papers sure missed that one-”
“Er, tell you what exactly? I don’t know how I stopped the effects you have-” croaked Harry. He assumed the dementor wanted to know why Harry suddenly stopped being affected. Harry glanced down at his body in case he spontaneously shifted into an animal. He was still human, though his ability to talk should have been indication enough.
Almost everyone was just as happy for them. Mrs. Weasley had prepared a celebratory brunch for them, when they stopped by the next morning. She’d been rather pleased about the role she’d played in helping Draco plan the night. Draco hadn’t gone as far as asking the Weasleys for their permission, but including Molly had meant a lot to her, and consequently scored points with her sons. They were all amused when James squealed in delight at the news, though Harry suspected he was working off everyone else’s energy. James already saw Draco as his second father whether it was official or not. Mr. Weasley had let go of his anger towards the Malfoys, or at least towards Draco and he spoke respectfully about Mrs. Malfoy. He generally avoided saying anything about Mr. Malfoy in order to keep the peace. He welcomed Draco to the family with sincerity. Still, Harry made a mental note to make sure Arthur and Lucius were not seated near each other at the wedding.
“Get up Nott,” yelled Burke as he stopped by the man’s cell. He made banging noises despite the fact that Albert had already groaned and was making an effort to sit up.
If it couldn’t be Hermione, and he had no idea where Ron was, the person he’d trust the most to keep the ring safe was Ginny. It would be risky since she was at school with Death Eaters, but he knew she’d do her best to protect it. Besides, she was one of the few people who had experience with horcruxes and would know how serious and dangerous the ring could be. Certainly, she’d take precautions.
“What did they say?” he asked.
With a self-satisfied smile, Harry told him, “I got it to work.”
“Not Dumbledore, your blithering idiot,” said Lucius. “The dark lord has staked his claim on the boy.”
“It’s... tied to my blood,” Harry said, voice barely above a whisper despite the privacy spell.
He wasn’t sure when it happened, but somewhere along the way Harry had fallen hard for Draco. It didn’t help that Draco was so good with James. He was certainly a better role model than Harry was. Draco was so patient with James too. Whenever he watched them together, it made Harry want Draco even more. He feared it was completely obvious that he perked up just as much as James did whenever Draco walked into the room.
“Right,” Harry sighed.
Snape looked like he wanted to join Harry and Hale as they left, but he had no reason to do so. Nor could he prevent Harry from walking towards the gates with Hale. Harry told Ron and Hermione he’d meet them in the library later before walking in step with Hale out the school. Hale asked a few generic pleasantry questions while they navigated away from the crowd. The man hadn’t failed to notice their audience and their excitement as news spread that Hale was Harry’s judicial-wizard. Fortunately, no one immediately followed them outside, so they felt comfortable stopping in an alcove not too far from the entrance where they were protected from the cold wind.
“What did you tell him?” ask Hale. Harry glanced at him nervously. He knew he was off script and that Hale wasn't prepared for whatever Harry was about to say. Harry debated if he should move forward or back out. He hadn’t come to the trial expecting to mention the Dursleys. Harry knew he could use it as an example of ‘acceptable’ anger and hatred spoken about muggles, but he didn't know how much that would actually help Albert. It didn’t directly relate to the Death Eater charges.
“That sounds like a reasonable trade,” Harry said as he tried to quickly move the conversation along before Ron or Hermione could ask more questions. At Harry’s acceptance, Nott started pulling out his own school supplies.
it?” Burke asked. He gripped the bars tightly. Harry noticed that the man’s knuckles were still bloody. Apparently, he hadn’t bothered to clean himself up either.
“Harry Potter! You are under arrest,” the elder wizard stated loudly. The auror immediately to the man’s right, turned his attention to where Harry stood and quickly aimed his wand at the boy.
“Er, right,” Harry answered.
There was silence at Harry’s bold accusation. For a few minutes, he could only hear his own angry panting but it allowed him to calm down when no one immediately jumped to defend her.
“Perhaps. But you don’t have to live with Pansy.
“I thought you weren’t going to cause any trouble,” said Burke and roughly pulled Harry back upright. “We don’t take too kindly to troublemakers here, Potter.”
“Yes. I didn’t know at the time, obviously, but it fits. It had his memories, was able to possess Ginny, and it was trying to use Ginny’s lifeforce to gain his body back,” Harry pointed out.
“Then perhaps you can attend his trial as character witnesses. In the meantime, Potter will be taken into custody. Now, there are five other students we need to question about their involvement in the break in at the ministry,” Runecraft reminded everyone. Bole pushed forward with Ron and Hermione.
“No, but I used it in my sixth year to get out of taking a transfiguration test I hadn’t studied for,” Crabbed reminisced with a laugh.
“And maybe one at a time,” Theo added. “I mean, there are things I know I’d rather not say in front of everyone.”
The door swung open to reveal Harry standing at the top of the staircase. Snape sneered at him, but Dumbledore offered Harry a seat before Snape could say anything scathing about Harry eavesdropping.
The slow pace wasn’t Burke’s insightful way to increase Harry’s worry and fear. They were moving slow because Albert seemed incapable of going any faster. The guards seemed content to let Albert take slow painful steps rather than help by levitating him or healing his wounds.
,” Harry retorted.
“Alright, we’re both awesome then,” Theo bragged. Harry smiled and ignored the disbelieving snort Parkinson made in response.
He settled in for another day at the library. Ron and Hermione joined him once again. Harry wasn’t too surprised when Nott joined them a little later as well. Both Ron and Hermione still watched him suspiciously but didn’t protest aloud.
“They would hardly protest,” Nott pointed out. Harry considered both points. He didn’t want too many people knowing about the interview before it happened, but he didn’t care if Nott told his roommates either.
“Great!” Malfoy clapped his hands together. “Are we missing anything else?”
Harry picked at his food wishing it was something else for a change. He froze when he suddenly tasted Mrs. Weasley’s Sunday roast. He concentrated on his food and was delighted when his next mouthful tasted like treacle tart. Harry felt mischievous as he focused on Lucius’ food and shared the Sunday roast flavour. He giggled when Lucius paused mid-chew with wide eyes when he registered the change.
Malfoy gasped drawing Harry’s attention to the man. Harry was tense. He hated thinking about Umbridge, let alone talk about her. Remembering those detentions still filled him with a sort of impotent anger. Harry half expected death eaters to approve of her methods, but Malfoy looked genuinely horrified on Harry’s behalf. Consequently, for the first time, Harry began to feel at ease with the scar. It was a relief that an adult acknowledged the harm that was done and was repulsed by it instead of attempting willful ignorance.
“Admit it, you miss having me around,” Mulciber said.
“You didn’t –” Harry started to ask. When Malfoy nodded his head in a negative fashion, Harry turned to Nott for confirmation. He too shook his head.
There was a short argument over which one of the men would be stuck pulling up Burke’s pants. When one guard reluctantly agreed to do it and turned Burke over, Burke’s cock was put on display for everyone to see. Harry had to look away. His eyes landed on Burke’s forgotten wand. That inner Hermione was urging him to leave it be, while his inner Ron suggested he ought to hide the wand before the guards noticed it. His magic still felt easily accessible, so he decided to chance it. Once his brain felt the danger had passed, it was likely he wouldn’t be able to purposely access his magic wandlessly. Having a wand would protect him in case one of the guards decided to finish what Burke started.
“You’re not a shit dad. You’re patient with him. You make sure he’s healthy and happy. You do more than you know,” Draco reassured him. Privately, Harry thought about the reasons why he did those things. He remembered his own childhood filled with hurt and a desperate need to be loved. Thus far James had not been burdened with those memories. In many ways, the baby was innocent, even if the soul in him was not.
“Alright,” Draco said slowly.
“What? I’m not,” Lucius denied.
“Did she talk about legonian purioes then too?” asked Theo with a bemused smile.
“And they could say you provoked them by being violent first,” Mulciber sounded like he was speaking from personal experience.
Harry sat up from his cot and turned towards Malfoy. “Yeah?”
“Shall we go for a walk and
“Attacked how?” Hale pressed.
“Well, now you can teach Potter,” Mulciber replied.
Harry paced nervously as soon as Nott disappeared. Lucius tried to distract him by reviewing spells, but Harry wasn’t able to focus. He kept wondering if Nott’s judicial-wizard would agree to take him on as a client. By the time Nott was returned to his cell, Harry was a nervous wreck.
“Go,” Burke hissed and waved his arm at it.
“I allegedly cast the cruciatus curse on Lestrange,” Harry repeated. His voice a bit stronger that time.
“I thought so at first, but... they’re actually not bad,” Harry said cautiously.
“Yes, I still want to know how you got a mirror into Azkaban,” Parkinson said.
“That dementor did more for me than any of the guards ever did,” Harry said. It was similar to the statement he made about his fellow prisoners and ministry, but if anyone noticed that, it was drowned out by the shocked gasps that went through the room.
Harry was completely lost. He wasn’t holding anything. He watched the dementor helplessly. A particularly pitiful groan from one of the cells eventually broke Harry from his staring contest with the dementor.
The top of the box slid open and revealed a bunch of rolled up scrolls.
"Oh, could you Harry?" asked Crabbe. Harry couldn't say no to that once he heard the hope in his voice. It was also a better solution that sticking the letters to his person and stealthily transferring them to the bottom of a bench when he had to shower. The first time, he’d almost forgotten the letter on the way out.
“You don’t have to. Especially if you think it would get you in trouble with the ministry,” Harry responded.
“So, it’s not a Death Eater plot?” Harry asked. There was silence and Harry immediately regretted asking. He wasn’t ruling out the possibility that this was somehow Voldemort’s plan to make him miserable and get him out of the way. But the question also reminded him and the men around him that they were on different sides of this war.
“The ministry takes these types of crimes seriously. Potter must be held accountable for his actions,” Runecraft stated as Harry was guided towards them.
To his surprise, Ron, Hermione, and Neville were waiting for him when he returned to the dorm room.
“Even mum’s alright with it. Well, she’s not pleased that you’ve chosen a Malfoy, but he’s good with James. That counts for a lot with her,” Ron told him.
Once the wards were complete, Lucius encouraged Harry to continue reviewing charms. A couple of times, he corrected Harry’s stance but overall was pleased by how much Harry retained of their lessons. Every so often, Lucius paused and asked Harry to describe what he was feeling. Eventually, Harry got a feel for how the magic built up within him and passed out into the world. Harry found he was repeating himself, which didn’t seem helpful to him until he subconsciously deodorised the whole area after Lestrange had gone to the bathroom. Harry belatedly realized that his sense of the magic in both cases was the same. He was not able to stop any accidental magic, he could adjust the strength of the spell if he caught it as it happened.
“Booty call,” suggested Mulciber.
“You do have a way of catching my son’s attention like no other,” Lucius said, smirking slightly. Harry’s blush deepened and he averted his eyes. Draco had a similar effect on Harry. Draco mostly inspired negative emotions, but Harry couldn’t deny that he paid more attention to him than any other student he had confrontations with. Zacharias Smith and Cormac McLaggen were prats, but Harry didn’t dwell on his encounters with them. Harry
This hadn’t changed much once he got to Hogwarts. Despite having the time and resources to do schoolwork properly, Harry preferred to learn more in class than out of it. Perhaps if he and Hermione had been close from the very start, she could have changed his habits. However, his closest friend from the beginning was Ron, who was just as ‘intellectually lazy’. Harry felt that had recently changed, but by now his habits were set. He assumed he had excelled with Lucius and the others because they had been teaching him themselves, answering all questions, and never once told him to read dry books on the subject.
“Keep it,” Harry replied. He thought himself a fool for hoping he actually had a chance with Draco. He knew it was just a grand delusion on his part. As Goyle proved, they all knew about Burke, and Harry couldn’t fathom any reason that Draco would want him after that. Still, he wanted to do something for Draco, even if a silly box was a poor gesture.
“I have a small collection of rare poisons,” Lucius answered. “...for prosperity.”
“Still doing things wandlessly, I see,” said Albert as he too sat up on his cot. Like Lucius, he watched the movement of the rocks and was impressed by Harry’s ability to converse and keep up the fluid motion.
"I don't know why this is even a question. Clearly the last animal should be a dragon," teased Mulciber. Harry rolled his eyes, thinking it was just a joke, but Crabbe and Avery were ok with that option.
didn’t it kiss you as well?”
Snape insisted on both being present. That had to be the shortest interview of the bunch,” Ron explained.
Lucius didn’t respond as he was too busy hissing and jumping back from shower. Harry felt the water temperature in his stall suddenly drop a second later. Harry tried to quickly rinse off the remaining soap on his body as the water was quickly becoming ice cold.
“Who’s this then?” asked one of the men as he helped Perkins guide Harry onto the boat. “Bloody hell, how old is he?”
“If there is anything I can do,” Dumbledore offered. Once again, Harry felt Dumbledore’s full attention on him. He made sure to avoid the avoid eye contact as the man assessed him.
“Are they still trying to interrogate you?” asked Harry.
“What do you want?” asked Ron rudely. Harry turned to the boy next to him with surprise. He too wondered why Nott was sitting with them, though Harry wasn’t as affronted by this as Ron.
“You taught Draco, didn’t you? They’ll be fine,” Mulciber said, then steered the conversation away from sex spells. “So, what do you like about Draco?”
“But you weren’t spoiled too?” pressed Mulciber.
A silence fell on those in the hallway until Theo held up Harry’s notes to Draco.
“A young man,” Malfoy conceded. “My point is that your youth will work in your favor. Throwing someone who hasn’t even finished their education into Azkaban without a trial will backfire on the ministry.”
“Outline?” asked Nott curiously. Harry bit his lip as he considered his options. He didn’t know Nott as well as his father, so it would be stupid to instantly trust him. But Harry didn’t get the sense that Nott was at their table for any nefarious purpose. He didn’t think there would be any harm in telling Nott, especially since it impacted his father.
“Then I don’t think whatever you say will make me hate you so much I break off our friendship,” Draco concluded.
” the voice questioned after a few moments of Harry sitting and staring dumbly at the dementor.
“He just said he’d kill them five minutes ago,” Ito pointed out.
It was a bittersweet find, but Harry was glad to have it. He kept it safe, but in light of the horcrux hunt, it ultimately slipped his mind. At least until they’d been attacked.
Harry knew it wouldn’t be the most impressive or useful gift Neville would get, but hopefully he’d like them anyway.
“You should wait for true love,” Rodolphus added unexpectedly. “Everything is so much better with Belly than any other woman I’ve been with,” he sounded wistful. If Harry hadn’t met the woman, he would picture a saint with the way her husband spoke of her.
“Your judicial-wizard would have to petition the court to allow him to bring his wand to the interview room. Unfortunately, this gives the guards advance notice. Since the petition must be specific, the guards would know what memory is to be recorded. Many prisoners have mysteriously been addled just before the memory could be extracted,” explained Lucius. Harry knew his face was ghostly pale as it really sunk in how much power the guards had over his life while he was stuck there.
“What was that?” a low voice asked. Harry turned his attention back towards Malfoy’s cell. The man was no longer in peacock form.
decide I’m ready?” asked Harry sharply. He knew Snape would take his time in declaring Harry fit. If the man suggested Harry return to the tender loving care of the Dursleys in the meantime, there was going to be another ‘accidental’ crack in the wall. Preferably right above Snape’s head.
“He doesn’t know how,” Lucius explained.
” one of them asked.
“What?” he said, blinking owlishly.
“They didn’t hurt you, did they?” Harry asked. He recalled that the other aurors and Runecraft had wanted to question them. They had a pretty strong hold on the ones they already had in their grasp.
“They’ve started your trial without you,” Hale informed him bluntly.
the bad guy? Playing innocent and helpless but you’re nothing but a filthy dog,” Burke spat and punctuated his point by backhanding Harry again. The force of it brought tears to Harry’s eyes.
“You’ve made your point,” Lucius said angrily from his cell. “The boy is successfully frightened. You should stop.”
They had to wait a few more minutes before Draco exited the classroom. Everyone turned to watch him. Harry could immediately tell Draco had been crying. All tear tracks had been removed, but Draco’s eyes were a telltale red.
about it. If this keeps up...”
“How the hell did the Dursleys come up at Nott’s trial?” asked Ron.
“You should probably stop cock-blocking your son,” added Mulciber sounding very amused.
Lastly, I want to apologize for taking forever to respond to some comments. It means a lot when you take the time to leave me notes and encouragement. It's great to know that some of you are sticking with me even though I take forever to update. I was completely uninspired all of July and August, but all of your support help keep this fic on my to-do list. <3 you all!
“I see him too,” the man in the cell beside Malfoy answered. He was in the other cell that Harry could see into. The man was older than Malfoy and he looked familiar to Harry. Unfortunately no last names were coming to mind so Harry wasn’t sure how he knew him.
“No, they gave up on that. But they briefly went after my dad,” Ron said bitterly.
“Potter,” was hissed at him. The voice confirmed it was Burke. He quickly strode over to the groggy boy and pushed him back onto the mattress when Harry started to sit up.
Their first year together was occasionally rocky, but not as explosive as their old classmates and professors might have assumed. They still had disagreements. Not as many as when they were children, but just as intense when they were both angry. That first year was an exercise in learning how to compromise. Harry put off starting his career so he could continue to be a stay at home dad during James’ early years. He would have preferred starting auror training but knew that wouldn’t be fair. Firstly, because James was his responsibility and he didn’t feel right asking family and friends to watch him every day. Secondly, because Draco was working to attain a double mastery. One in Charms and the other in Divination; both to help Harry. Draco liked Charms well enough but would not have bothered pursuing Divination if he wasn’t exploring soul magic for Harry’s benefit. They were the two legal subjects whose magical theory might also apply to soul magic and horcruxes. Harry felt guilty, especially since he knew Draco would have chosen a Potions mastery, but he couldn’t talk Draco out of it. His boyfriend insisted he had enough money and time to pursue a third mastery later. The fact that Draco found soul magic genuinely interesting helped assuage his guilt.
“What’s he doing here?” asked Ron.
The only one who seemed reluctant to celebrate the news was Lucius. They decided to officially inform Draco’s parents during dinner. Draco had already spoken to his mother earlier. She had known of his plans to propose and wasn’t going to wait the whole day to find out how Harry responded. She must have told her husband, as he was subdued since they arrived and Draco preemptively asked Molly to watch James that night. Harry expected to finally hear that he wasn’t good enough for his son. Instead, Lucius brought up a different concern.
“Perhaps not condone it but I can understand it,” Malfoy answered. “Don’t pretend that you would have done differently. Either of you.”
“Yeah,” Crabbe said. He turned towards Draco and Harry with a huge smile. Harry’s breath caught when Draco sent Crabbe an answering smile. He hadn’t seen Draco smile like that in months.
Harry was sweating by the time his name was called. He hated being back in the courtroom and was terrified he’d screw it up for Hale and Albert. McGonagall tried to be supportive as Harry rose from his seat, but Harry was unable to look at her knowing she wouldn’t like whatever he ended up saying while on the stand.
“It probably isn’t anything special,” Draco said.
Harry used the marauders map as inspiration to have the shrinking and enlarging triggered with a password. He spent over an hour trying to figure out how to do it without disrupting the other enchantments on each object. He was glad he’d chosen the bottle to run his tests as his first attempt resulted in the bottle returning to a rock before it crumbled into dust. Oddly, it also left behind a smell that reminded Harry of the roll caps Dudley used to play with as a kid. His second attempt wasn’t any better. The bottle shrank but the lube inside didn’t. It left a huge mess – luckily it was as easily banished as it had been to conjure. Harry was frustrated and tempted to give. He also considered waking Albert up as the man was good at problem solving, but he wanted to see if he could do it on his own. He determined that if he was unable to succeed by morning, he would ask the man for help. Harry was glad he decided to keep trying, as he was eventually successful.
“If all else fails, Harry can cast simple confundus charm whenever a guard becomes suspicious,” suggested Lestrange.
“There you go, Potter. One nice little souvenir,” Burke smirked at him. Harry was tempted to spit in his face, but bit back the impulse. Who knew what else the man would draw on him as revenge. Wiblin moved back towards the cabinet and returned with another potion bottle. Burked poured some on a new piece of cloth and pressed it to Harry’s neck. Harry hissed at the newest sensation of pain.
“He’s been acquitted,” Hale volleyed back, “the compensation he is due is from Azkaban and the ministry’s gross mistreatment.”
“Why?” Harry asked.
“Father, that is hardly a discussion for today,” Draco said.
Nott snorted and said “Burke’s idea of a perk is just an extra serving of that crap they call a meal around here. It’s hardly worth the trouble you’ll face.”
“That’s not the spell for lube,” Mulciber said, sounding amused.
“Why would you deliver it though?” asked Crabbe.
“But you are,” insisted Asherath. “The closest comparison would be when one of your kind is with child. At first the difference is imperceptible, but as the new soul grows, their combined light stands out above the rest. And yet, none I have seen has matched your brightness. The child’s soul is too new, still developing, and once the pregnancy is over, both humans return to a brightness that is no different than the rest. Appealing but no more so than any other of your kind.”
impress Draco. Harry internally debated whether he ought to create an entire vanity instead of a small mirror. That would probably get Draco attention... assuming Harry figured out how to send it to him. He didn’t think owls would be able to manage an item that big. As soon as Harry started to consider the logistics of it, it occurred to him that Draco might be more insulted than impressed. With Harry’s luck, Draco would probably think Harry was calling him vain.
“Vince? My Vincent?” asked Crabbe from the cell next to Harry. Harry wondered if he should start referring to them by their first names so he could keep everything straight.
“And how’s school?” asked Malfoy during a lull in Harry’s narrative of some of the more recent prophet articles. Harry immediately understood that Malfoy was asking after his son. Harry bit his lip while he considered how candid he ought to be with Malfoy. Harry eventually decided to be open given the fact that if the situation was reversed, he would want to know about his loved ones even if it wasn’t all good news.
Before he could finish reprimanding Mulciber, the door at the end of the hall opened. Almost immediately Burke’s angry voice shouted out.
“I say stick to classics like ‘wanker’ and ‘git’,” suggested Avery.
,” one of the creatures murmured which terrified Harry. It couldn’t be a good thing that they found him interesting even if it sparred him the horrible memories.
“Permanently damaging school property isn’t
He made no progress researching in the library that night, though he found it encouraging that Ron seemed less tense around Nott. Whatever happened during their chess game was enough for Ron to not only tolerate having the Slytherin at their table, but actually greet him when he sat down. Harry wouldn’t go so far as to call them friends, though they were at least friendly.
“I think I might have unintentionally healed myself too,” Harry admitted. His cheek didn’t hurt where Burke had slapped him multiple times. His neck didn't feel sore even though Burke had strangled him. When Harry finally moved to put on his pants, he didn’t see any marks on his lower body even though Burke had gripped him hard enough to bruise.
“Gee, thanks,” Harry said drily.
Living with the Weasleys was difficult in a way it never had been when he was a child. There were reminders of Ginny everywhere, and every kindness the family showed him just piled on the guilt.
“It’s not the first time the guards have done something like this. They’ll use any convenient excuse whenever they want to scratch that itch. It wouldn’t have mattered what any of us did or didn’t do,” Lucius said as he took over explaining.
“There is still some paperwork we need to do,” Hale said, but sighed deeply. “Though we should probably do it when Runecraft isn’t standing across the room, looking like he’s one snide comment away from murdering us all.”
“Theodore Nott,” Harry said.
“Gin, I – fuck, I love you. I know it isn’t right or fair of me to give you the ring when I... I... I’m sorry. I’m painting a target on your back. I just – there’s no one I trust more, and I need you... You have to know-” Harry stumbled as he tried to explain his regret at asking her to hold his horcrux.
“Shine?” Harry parroted. It should be a relief to hear he wasn’t carrying Burke’s spawn. And yet, his apprehension only seemed to grow the longer the conversation went on.
“It’s an honour to be cho-“ Lestrange started to say from the cell next to Harry but Malfoy interrupted.
“Alright... if you can’t... I won’t ask again unless I get stuck and need a new angle to explore,” Draco offered. Harry nodded in gratitude, knowing that he’d made Draco’s research significantly harder.
"Do you know what a golden poison dart frog looks like?" asked McNair. Harry didn't.
The boat jostled as it came upon the dock. This dock didn’t look to be in any better condition than the first one. Perkins helped Harry move off the boat while Bradley once again trained his wand on him. The group then made their way to the fortresses’ rather intimidating doors.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry said as all nearby prisoners groaned at the brightness. He quickly dimmed the light to a more suitable level.
Perhaps inspired by his comment about Snape, the men decided Harry should start today’s lessons with potions. Since Crabbe had shown he was quite knowledgeable in the subject, Harry decided to ask him some fundamental questions. He was slightly embarrassed when the others seemed surprised that Harry didn’t already know the more essential aspects of potion making. Harry addressed this embarrassment by venting about Snape’s (lack of) teaching style. His tirade was eventually interrupted by Lestrange commenting that Harry sounded like Bellatrix when she bitches about Snape. Harry pouted and decided not to comment further.
With shaking fingers Harry undid his Gryffindor cloak and placed it on Anton’s desk. He was glad that the clothes he was wearing underneath were not his most embarrassing set of Dudley cast offs. The shirt was fairly old so it was pretty faded but Harry liked it because it was one of the few that almost fit him properly. The jeans were atrocious but hardly the worst pair he had. It could be worse and more embarrassing. Harry pulled off his shirt and immediately noticed how much cooler it was. He picked up the Azkaban shirt and quickly slipped it on. It was not comfortable but the material wasn’t itchy or anything. It was pretty thin so Harry still felt cold.
Harry laughed at Malfoy’s recounting of his own glory days playing quidditch. It seemed he pulled as many dirty tricks as his son. Even if Draco wasn’t playing quidditch at the moment, it gave Harry some ideas of what to look out for. Assuming Harry ever got out of Azkaban.
“Shut up!” snapped Harry.
Based on previous comments, I know some of you were hoping for an angry Harry, holding a Harley Quinn sized mallet, ready to play whack-a-mole with Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione... but this isn’t exactly a bashing fic. I do think Dumbledore’s actions towards Harry are morally questionable, but Harry isn’t going to start hating his guts. I totally understand the impulse to slap Dumbledore on Harry’s behalf. However, Harry admires Dumbledore on some level. He’s hurt that the headmaster never visited him and is scared to confirm his belief that Dumbledore knows about the horcrux in him. He might even pick up on Dumbledore’s attempts to manipulate him. There are definitely trust issues between them, but Harry isn’t going to go around cursing him or anything. Elements of “bashing” might pop up because their relationship is fractured and Harry might be more critical about what Dumbledore wants from him. But it will be softcore bashing, at most.
. Not really. But he’s still all there. Like, mentally. He’s relatively healthy. Er, he lost weight, but he’s still eating!” Harry said. Despite not painting a good picture, he thought Draco looked less tense than he had a moment ago.
Another time, he’d literally tripped over his own feet the day Draco stopped by in a perfectly tailored suit. Draco had laughed and assumed Harry’s surprise was due to the muggle outfit and not how sinful Draco looked in it. He’d bought the suit to attend a charity gala hosted by a half-blood proud of his roots. Draco hoped that by wearing the muggle attire he could regain some prestige for the Malfoy name.
Asherath and Isanders debated amongst themselves if anyone in their clan would be able to follow up on Harry’s theory. When it became clear to the dementors that Harry was no longer in a state to contribute to the discussion and planning, the two dementors bid him goodnight and stated they’ll let him know if anyone comes up with a way to test his theory. The dementors leave, happy to have some answers but still confused about the strange soul magic humans used.
“Well what’s your favourite colour?” Harry asked Asherath. He thought perhaps if he learnt their answers to the questions, he might be able to figure out what they wanted from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see… well, if you’d like to use my office…” Snape drawled. It couldn’t be a more obvious attempt for the man to snoop on their meeting.
Eventually, the questions died down as they realized Hale was twisting their words. Madame Bones was able to move on and call a vote. Harry didn’t know how it would turn out given he hadn’t been present for the trial. Hale ran circles around the wizengamot members today, but Harry had no way of knowing if that had been the tone throughout the trial. He held his breath as he watched the wizengamot vote on his fate. A significant number voted against him, but the majority voted to acquit him. Harry made a soft, relieved noise when the vote was official and the chains holding him fell idle beside him.
don’t all understand it,” Lestrange cut in. “You can’t just go throwing unforgivables at people’s wives.”
“Shut up, Mulciber. We need to think,” said Wiblin harshly.
“Shhh, dear,” Mrs. Weasley said and ran a soothing hand up and down his back. “It’s not your fault.”
“There’s the toenail curling hex,” suggested Malfoy.
“She’s a
He found Draco in a ridiculously large dinning room, made even more absurd by the fact the man was eating alone when the table could easily fit twenty-four people.
“You don’t know?” asked Harry in surprise.
” added Malfoy. He had been teasing Harry with that all morning. The teasing coming from him especially, was so reminiscent of Draco that Harry felt at once comforted and homesick.
The voice started laughing at his own joke but it sent an uneasy feeling twisting in Harry’s abdomen. He was already postponing the piss he had to take due to feeling a little awkward. But that would be manageable. His back would be to Malfoy and Nott and it probably won’t be any different to using a public urinal. But what was he supposed to do when he had to shit? There was no way to avoid doing so in full view of two men. Harry considered that perhaps he should start skipping meals and cut down on how often that embarrassment had to happen…
“So, there wasn’t much to go off of,” Hermione pulled her hair back into a messy bun, “but I think I found a reference to the mirror itself in here.” She pointed to a block of text, “Harry can you remind me again, what exactly Dumbledore told you about the mirror.”
“Quite right. Miserable experience.” He meant to mumbled mostly to himself but Harry caught it nonetheless. Pulling out his want, Mot recited an interacted spell and transfigured a nearby fallen tree into a small boat. “Now get in the boat and get back to the castle. Classes are about to change over.”
Turning his attention to Harry, Filch’s fond smile fell into a spiteful sneer, “What are you doing out of the bed?” He came closer, clearly trying to put up his most intimidating front.
“Luckily we won't need Gilly Weed this time.” Harry joked, pulling out his wand. With a quick series of flicks with his wand. Harry had enchanted his clothes to stay warm. He performed an air bubble spell, the same one Fluer had used in the Triwizard tournament, to make sure breathing wasn’t a problem.
“Give it to me!” He was starting to sound distressed. Whatever this little charm was it seemed to mean a lot to him. Harry rolled it between his fingers, inspecting it to see if it would tell him why it was precious. It looked beautiful, but then again so did many of Malfoy’s things and he didn’t seem to treat them with as much reverence. Pocketing the item Harry knew he had the other man tethered.
Draco Malfoy looks haggard; a thick coating of the kicked-up ash clung to his platinum hair turning it a steely grey. He appeared to be wearing the same clothes that Harry saw him in yesterday morning. The bags under his eyes seem to have only settled in deep and were now accompanied by the distinct redness of bloodshot eyes. Whatever Malfoy was up to, he had been losing a lot of sleep over it.
I hope you enjoy and if so please leave a Kudo and comment. It really helps to let me know what you think and to keep the drive up with a long story like this.
“My mum gave it to me.” He held it with such delicate fingers, almost as if it would shatter under too much heavy breathing. The little flower inside was rustling side to side, like the wind was thrashing around it. “It’s a Black family Heirloom. Suppose to keep me safe but I don’t know what else. It really hasn’t done anything but…” He liked it. It was soft, delicate, a gift from his mom and he liked it. That’s all that mattered.
-Draco watches Ginny making out with Harry in the common rooms knowing Harry isn't enjoying it.
Harry was happy to just fly past - get on with his day, but Malfoy decided to fly over to him on his Firebolt Supreme. Harry hovered a few feet away from Malfoy, and apart from being polite, he really didn’t know why he’d stopped.
He wondered.
Wouldn't that be funny; Harry potter, the golden boy that everyone wants a piece of, arrested for breaking a dating service agreement.
Draco: "I never asked you to come to my trial. Saint Potter, protecting Death Eaters. Maybe you require a mind healer."
It was quiet solitude over the lake as he returned in a slower pace. He’d never seen anyone flying out here before, so it was surprising when that was exactly what he could see now - another rider. He instantly noticed that familiar platinum white-blond hair, almost glowing under the sunlight and reflecting the rays - Malfoy!
The Burrow is actually rather quiet than it usually is.
“Shut it Potter!” Draco whispered, glaring at the raven-haired man. Why did he have to be right? Bloody saint Potter!
Fuck! His conflicting emotions were whirling. He was a little angry that Draco had just walked in… and hadn’t he locked his door last night? He wanted to shout at Draco to piss off, to express his vexation regarding Draco’s lack of common courtesy – you didn’t just let yourself into someone else’s private rooms when the door was locked! Yet, despite his embarrassment, the man he had come to love – even if it was unrequited, was comfortable enough to take such liberties – what did that mean? If only Draco was here for other reasons though… actually, why was he here? It
“I’m not sure.” Draco slouched slightly as he thought. “Mmm, I am an adult now. The right of lord Malfoy is already mine because my father has been sentenced to life in Azkaban. Worst case scenario, I will have to become a Black like my mother. I don’t think It would come to that though, and seeing as I am the remaining male of the Malfoy line, they should honour the protection of the sacred families act. To be honest though, my family’s name no longer holds the respect and reverence it once did. I don’t care if it ends with me.”
Ron: "Maybe you could ask the Councillor to check your head mate. Malfoy is a traitorous tosser!"
Draco throws down his napkin and leaves the Great Hall angry - jealous.
The music had stopped, but the kissing lasted for a whole fifteen seconds longer. When Draco pulled away, it took Harry a moment to realize they were no longer under the effects of the magical radio. The look on Harry's face - questioning, hopeful maybe, imploring, and dazed with infatuation, was enough to encourage Draco to speak.
“I didn’t know that Ceridwen’s sold potion ingredients?” Harry asked.
Draco cursed himself and blamed Potter for his current brain malfunctions. His eyes moved so that that were no longer staring at Harry’s lips… Harry still looked a mess – he had his excuse then. “You will not insult my help by leaving half way through it.” Draco said.
“Yeah, sorry. I shouldn’t have bothered you. I should just-” Harry stopped talking the moment a warm hand touched his shoulder.
-Making out in Harry's room.
"Don't Potter!" Draco pulled back his wrist. "Don't ruin what we have!" His eyes pleaded as they met Harry's begging green ones. "Don't! Nothing can happen between us… I have Padfoot, and you're–"
-Monday 7th September- 9am Herbology, Harry staring at Draco but he won't respond.
"Nope. I was…" Harry hesitated, deciding a lie by omission couldn't hurt. "When I was eight, I fell over at school. I was outside, my leg scraped across the steps I was climbing up. The school had to call an ambulance to take me to hospital. I ended up needing four stitches in my left shin, just below my knee. The cut was really deep." Harry finished his story and images of what actually happened flashed into his mind…
-Images of the constant animosity Draco faces.
When Harry finally reached the door to the potion’s classroom, he was greeted with a raised eyebrow from Draco. Draco was standing outside the classroom, waiting for Harry to straighten out his breathing, and It didn’t evade him that Harry had literally come running the moment he’d asked for him… but he tried not to think on that.
Draco watched as Harry removed his glasses and rubbed the space between his eyes. What was going through that mind of his?
Harry almost jumped when words appeared on the parchment before him, nearly making him splatter up his coffee. He had been so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t expected Tau to reply so soon.
Malfoy heir’. Harry also knew, that Draco felt like his father was never proud of him growing up – nothing every satisfied Malfoy senior, and there was always more that Draco had to learn.
“What?” Harry asked, wondering if he’d heard wrong.
Knowing he’d take his dinner in his chambers later, he slipped into his short-sleeved pyjamas and black slippers. He threw the towel into the wash bin, then sat down at the table with a fresh cup of coffee. Sighing to himself, he opened the box to start pulling out his lesson plans.
- The child's eyes looks into Draco's imploringly.
-Draco looks over at Ginny, and she shoves him before trying to pull Harry away with her.
They were dismissed, and Harry found himself walking down the corridor. He was lost in his own mind however - a moment of sadness, and a feeling of being incomplete washed over him. He was previously filled with joy - knowing that Hogwarts would soon be gaining so many, innocent, smiling faces ... but he wished for his own, imagining a life with two kids and someone to love.
"Come on!" Harry laughed. "I'll show you. Just transfigure your robe into a coat, your trousers and shirt are fine in the muggle world."
“It’s nothing to ashamed of.” Harry tried, but Draco was already running behind his shields.
Draco used a simple colour changing charm to turn the water a pastel blue colour. Then sky blue, cerulean blue, sapphire blue, maya blue, azure blue, midnight blue, and steel blue.
Pansy: "What makes you think it was cursed?"
Draco: "Are you mad? They will dig up our past, ask difficult question, and then manufacture some complete cock-and-bull story because it increases their profits. It will be complete fabrication with no truth to it at all - painting us once agian as bad guy corrupts the chosen one."
“Perhaps.” Minerva didn’t sound like she believed that either. “Go knock on his door for me. Remind him that as head of Gryffindor house, he will be accompanying the students to the train with the other head of houses, and that I wish to see him when he returns.”
“My place.” Harry gestured, half-heartedly, at his living room in Grimmauld Place: Low white panelling sat below the towering Aegean-blue walls; the double armed Victorian wall sconces, gave light where the floor to ceiling windows – dressed with dark azure curtains, failed; the three dark-blue chesterfield sofa’s – with various pillows and throws, sat a-top the Moroccan trellis carpet, in front of a stunning white marbled fireplace. “You can’t disapparate within Hogwarts grounds…” Harry continued. “…Or I’d have taken you back to your private chambers, and I didn’t think you’d want the students gossiping either.”
Harry: "If we do nothing, we'll fail!"
Harry was almost positive that Draco
“So, you’re stuck here over the Christmas holidays?” Draco asked.
“The lion finally rounded up his cubs then?”
Draco took Harry face into his hands - kissing him lovingly.
-Thursday, 8th October, Herbology class. Draco watches Harry with a yearning desire.
Harry knocked on Draco’s office door … but there was no answer. If Draco wasn’t in his office, then he was most likely in his private room seeing as there was no reason for him to be in the potions’ classroom today. They walked in silence to Draco’s private chambers, but again, when he knocked, there was no answer ... until Harry swore that he heard a muffled groan. He knocked louder, listening closer to the door … a sudden wave of concern washed over him when he only heard a loud thump.
“Are you sure Potter? What if-”
Screaming, kicking, and blazing with an inferno of obvious, were the words that neither dared speak. The troll in the room, the lump in their throats, the heart beats almost loud enough to hear…
“Yeah, that might be a good idea actually. I’ll talk to Neville tomorrow.” Harry agreed, thinking about Miss Payne’s behaviour so far.
Reid and Gibson hung their heads once more, completely ashamed of their actions.
“Yeah?” Harry frowned slightly, nervous yet hopeful. Silence, Draco obviously couldn’t say or ask what had been on his tongue just seconds ago.
“Nope. Flying relaxes my mind actually. All the planning we had to do fried my brain. I needed the fresh air and a break. Besides, that’s not … what I mean by active mind is … when I’m casting spells for example. Watching the students battling keeps my mind active and sharp.” Harry explained.
“It’s obvious that your eating habits are not healthy Potter – – Harry. I’d like to know why that is… I won’t pressure you into telling me, but I am curios.” Draco admitted. He had his theories; Harry had said that his life with his muggle relatives wasn’t exactly splendid, and that made him wonder if they had been poor and unable to afford food, or if they had withheld food from Harry. Had Harry been abused while the world thought their saviour was pampered and loved?
Harry: "I'm not one of your minions you can order around." (Harry shouted).
“Well, I have some ideas for his detention assignments, and we need to go over the memories that would be the most effective to use as well.” Harry said, deciding to just get on with it. He could try and figure out what had changed with Draco later… hopefully. “I Have a list of memories that I have been considering…”
“Pain relief? Dream sleep? Pepper up? Anti-Hiccup? Calming D-?”
“Very well,” Minerva said, “as it is Christmas, I’m sure we can all agree to excuse your ridiculous behaviour this time around. Let us enjoy the rest of this wonderful feast. I think the deserts will be along soon.” And as an after though she added, “I’m rather looking forward to the Christmas pudding!”
Draco used a spell to melt a bottom section of their snow fort, while the girls pointed their wands at the ground and said, “Gliaciar!”
The Dursleys had raised him to believe he was a freak, and he’d found it hard to trust that anyone would accept him if they knew who he really was. He’d learnt at the age of eleven, that the Dursley's views were wrong however, even if a part of him always suspected, but he’d been forever scarred by them.
-Memory: Draco crying in the bathroom.
“I want you!” Draco cried, sobbing into Harry shirt as he realised his fighting was futile.
Tau seem to hold a very strong opinion that Elliot was at fault and didn’t deserve forgiveness. He blamed Elliot for his blind following of Azorren, even though Azorren was the one pulling the strings and manipulating him.
Molly: "Not really Dear. It is rather shocking I must say, but I trust you to be careful. I would be cautious around the boy - he is Lucius's son after all, but if you see something in him ... then there must be something the rest of us are missing. Am I right?"
Hope you are thinking about me.
“Thank you, Poppy, we’ll talk to her.” Neville said. “Can she return to her dormitory?”
“Hey Draco.” Harry greeted him with a nod, filling his mug with coffee. Caffeine had certainly become a necessity if he had any hope of getting through all the students’ homework, along with lesson plans and such.
. Of all the times to be reminding him! What the fuck was wrong with him?
Draco walked up to the Astronomy tower, alone. He was simple overwhelmed with happiness; everything new but perfect. What would his parents say if they saw him now - he chuckled slightly at the thought. Harry, he believed, was his soul mate. He wanted to spend the rest of his life learning and living with him. He was finally a better person now, and because of him and Harry the world had shifted; Harry freeing people from the terror Voldemort promised, and them, teaching people to be more accepting and forgiven by just loving each other. People weren't judging other for their pasts or given houses, it was surreal. He had changed.
-Draco throws an uneaten bean at Ron and laughs.
When dinner time rolled around, Ron was getting annoyed at Harry.
Draco: "A what?"
Harry Potter was no longer falling…. He was soaring on the winds of love and he hoped that Draco felt the same about him. Right now, however, he had a Slytherin to beat in a friendly wand duel.
“Me? I was a coward. Too scared and too ignorant to do the right thing.” Draco sighed, staring at his bent knees.
Draco stood panting, wet, covering in snow, exhausted, and with thoroughly mess up hair. They were both breathless and sore, both bruised from the onslaught of snowballs, and both freezing bloody cold – although Draco might admit that Harry must be worse of on the cold front right now.
Harry opened the door slightly, poking his head around the door, and called out Draco’s name. He heard a groan coming from near the sofa. Shutting the door behind him, so that Samuel wouldn’t see into the room, he moved closer to the sound and found Draco sprawled face down on the floor in front of the sofa. Draco was still in his pyjamas – a long-sleeved dark-grey top, with checkered dark-grey trousers.
Please comment and like, I enjoy seeing the comments - to see who is there lurking between the pages lol.  Any feed back is also welcome, but this really was just a random story idea and not my usual more detailed work.
Draco sighed, wishing he could just retreat to his private rooms, but he sat down in the empty armchair instead so that he could do his duty as teacher. “The best moments always seemed to accelerate and slip beyond one's grasp just when you want to hold onto them for as long as possible.’ That was a quote from a muggle writer, E.A. Bucchianeri, who rather liked music and chocolate, but it is quite true. You can measure the moment by how fast time sees to move.”
“Okay, we can talk about it when you get your voice back.” Harry smiled, hoping it would put the boy further at ease.
Draco sighed and continued to sip his coffee. Harry didn’t think he was going to say anything about his own trip down horror lane, but when he did, Draco’s voice was distant and pained deeply - as if eroded into his very being.
Harry was just preparing the defence against the dark’s arts class room - to accommodate the larger number of first years that would be arriving in two weeks, when an Owl started tapping rapidly at one of the windows. Harry smiled as he went to open it; after nineteen years in the Wizarding world, it still amazed him how owls could find him nearly anywhere he went. As long as there was a window - or a way to enter the building, they would find him.
