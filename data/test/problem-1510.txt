Draco checked his watch, it read a quarter to five, “it’s four forty five, we slept through class.” Draco sat up, realising that he was still lying on Harry.
Draco didn't know the answer, so he turned to poetry. There were a few muggle poets that understood love and Draco liked to read them. He'd memorized a few by a particular muggle called Atticus. He liked to write about love and loss and magic. Draco was fond of one that went; I'm glad I found you//Because//Before you//I never knew what to wish for. Draco felt like that when he saw Harry. Draco had found what he'd never known he'd been wishing for. But could he tell Harry that? No. So what did he say to Harry?
Draco started on Harry’s hair. He pulled out all the stops to get Harry's hair to cooperate, and eventually Harry's hair looked somewhat decent. Though Draco was exhausted from all the spells, brushing and physical exertion that it took to get this far, he was proud of his accomplishment.
Dinner was worse because now all he could think about was becoming a ferret again and finding Potter so that he could stay with him tonight too. He did have some homework to do but it wasn’t much. He’d be able to go to the library after dinner, get his work done in an hour, put his things away and go find Potter before eight thirty. It would be fine and he’d be able to sleep in because there are no classes on weekends and he can go to the kitchens for food if he needs to.
“Yes, yes go faster.” Harry pushed back in and pulled out increasing his speed with every thrust of his hips. Harry pulled Draco up towards him to get a better angle and started thrusting even faster. When Draco cried out Harry knew that he'd hit Draco’s prostate so he thrusted back in at the same angle to hit it again and again and again. He kept doing this until Draco gave one last cry and came between them. The combination of Draco's cum on his stomach and the way Draco's walls squeezed around him urged Harry over the edge and he came inside of Draco.
“Of course, Potter, I’ll apologize and explain everything to all you Gryffindors, I want to be on the right side of the war. I completely understand that I need to work to gain all of your trust, and I will, I’m here to help.” Draco said.
Draco thought it best to do this in the room of requirement, it made sense, no one would be here. The room had conjured a mirror for him, which he was standing in front of. He wondered what would happen to his clothes when he transformed. Would they go to some magical limbo? Fall to the ground? Get shredded if he changes into a larger animagus? None of the books seemed to mention this detail. He quite liked the shirt that he was wearing, a stylish button up, cream coloured, soft and wrinkle free, absolutely immaculate, unlike Potter’s clothes. Jumpers with holes in them, muggle jeans. Great now he’s thinking about Potter when he’s about to change into a Ferret, way to ruin this Potter. He looked back into the mirror, facing his reflection, challenging it, he looked at his sleeve, he knew what was lurking under there, that horrible Dark mark. That was another reason this shirt was his favourite, it hid his Mark. He hated that Mark, but he had a job to do. He looked away from his forearm searching for something else to focus on. He looked into its eyes, moved closer to them, they usually looked grey but sometimes they were more blue. Right now they looked pale blue, pale like the rest of him, unlike Potter’s naturally tanned skin. Merlin! He’s thinking of Potter again. It’s just the nerves he tells himself, pull yourself together, he takes a deep breath that fogs up the mirror, you’ve read about this for months, it doesn’t hurt, you’ll be fine. He moves back from the mirror, looks himself up and down almost as if it’s the last time he’ll be able to, and then closes his eyes.
It didn't stop there though, because by this stage both boys had become very aroused. They started rubbing against each other, moaning and kissing. Harry started to kiss down Draco's neck making Draco feel all the more pleasure from Harry's mouth. When Harry reached the edge of the T-shirt Draco was wearing, he sat back up and motioned for Draco to do the same. Once Draco was sitting Harry quickly drew Draco's shirt off and pushed him back down to attack his chest with open-mouthed kisses. Draco brought his hands to Harry’s hair and ran his hands through the strands as Harry continued his way down Draco's body. When Harry finally reached the hem of Draco's boxers he pulled back to admire his handy work for a second, both boys looking at each other. Harry looked as if he was proud of himself, Draco thought, when his gaze turned back to Harry's face. Though that look quickly turned to one of desire and wanting, Harry's hands moved to Draco's hips. Draco got the hint and lifted his hips to allow Harry to pull his boxers off. Harry moved off of Draco then to allow him to pull Draco's boxers off completely, once he'd taken Draco’s off he also removed his own. He quickly moved back to straddle Draco's hips, their erections rubbing together as he moved back into place, causing both boys to moan obscenely. Harry began kissing Draco again, reaching between them to take hold of both their cocks and stroking them together.
“Well I'm talking to you, and you really should stop swearing.” they were facing each other again now.
Harry eventually got into a rhythm, in and out as Draco thrust his hips back against Harry's every time he pushed back in. Harry was fucking into Draco faster and faster with every thrust of his hips. He wrapped his arms around Draco's chest and pulled him up so Draco's back was against Harry's chest. Harry, still holding Draco up with one arm used the other to wrap a hand around Draco's prick and started stroking Draco in time to his thrusts.
Harry helped Draco back into his bed, then got in beside him. Harry cared about Draco and he didn't care that he could get sick too he just wanted to make sure that Draco was OK. Harry pulled the blankets up around both of them and brought Draco closer to him. He started to stroke Draco's hair and kiss his forehead. After that it didn't take long for Draco to fall asleep. Harry on the other hand stayed awake for a while longer to watch over Draco and make sure that he would be OK. Though after about an hour Harry couldn’t stay awake any longer and drifted into a fitful sleep.
“Right, well you can stop fretting I’m just having a nap, apologising is tiring.” Draco tried to sound like he wasn’t hurt by the fact that Potter didn’t trust him, he knew that it was reasonable for Potter to still be untrusting but it hurt none-the-less. “But Potter, if you don’t even trust me then why call me ‘Draco’?”
“OK, I know we have an unspoken agreement about not talking about my wand but I just have to know, did you keep it in a good condition because you like me, like because you wanted to be friends with me?” Draco decided that it was safe enough to ask this now.
Draco’s heart was beating out of his chest. He could barely breathe by the time he got back to the castle. He decided to skip his transfigurations class and just go straight to his room. He needed time to think about what Harry had just admitted to him.
Draco apologied to Neville first, for all the years of bullying and unnecessary torments. He made sure to make it utterly clear that he was very sorry for everything that had happened and that he would work hard to make things right.
“I know, you already apologised for everything, and it’s ok we all forgive you.” Potter said to Draco, pulling him back into a tight hug.
“Actually I get up and dressed fairly early, I have to wait for Ron or someone to finish getting ready before I go down.” Harry stated.
Potter gets into bed next to Draco, is this really creepy? Draco thinks, well it’s only as creepy as I make it. Draco decides. It was Potter who brought him here anyway so really he’s to blame, bringing random ferrets into bed with him, it’s like he’s trying to be the dumbest ass in the whole of Hogwarts. It’s surprising, really, that The Dark Lord hasn’t been able to kill the prick yet. Also, who cares, Potter is his own personal heater. Draco thinks, So really it’s just all about warmth, not Potter, no one is taking advantage of Potter, nope, just maybe the situation. Besides, Potter never needs to know.
The process of becoming an animagus is long, but Draco was determined, also it would help to get Potter off his back. And to think all he needed to do to get Potter’s attention was act like he didn’t want it, well too late now. But after all those days and weeks of preparation, he was finally ready to change for the first time. Draco hardly ever got nervous, no he just got butterflies in his stomach. They just seemed to be swarming at this moment, making his hands shake, his palms sweat, his vision was even starting to blur, but he would remain undeterred. Nothing and no one would stop this now. He’d finally get to find out if he truly was a ferret.
Draco knew that Harry meant it, so with exhaustion creeping up on him he replied simply, “Love you too.” and they were both asleep, snuggled into each other.
There is smut in this chapter and I've never written smut before so sorry if it's really bad. Otherwise thanks for reading and enjoy.
“Draco how many times do I have to say it, you didn't do anything bad, you don't deserve to live this way.” it was like talking to a brick wall.
Draco let out a yelp as he hit the floor. Potter must have rolled over and made Draco fall off. That knob, to think Draco wanted to be friends with him. “Oh baby, I’m so sorry! Are you ok?” Potter had jumped out of bed and crouched next to Draco, he picked him up and was rocking Draco back and forth in his arms. “I’m so sorry, baby,” Potter kept murmuring to Draco. Once Potter had put Draco back on the bed, he also got back in and propped his pillows up so that he could sit against the wall. Potter pulled Draco into his lap and continued to apologise to him, patting him and making sure he wasn’t hurt. Draco was more shocked than hurt, he really just loved that Potter was so worried about him. Draco was sure now that he wanted to be an ally to Potter, a friend. He would tell him later though. Potter would probably not appreciate the fact that Draco had slept with him the last two nights.
Harry did in fact still have Draco's wand from when he took it in the war. He'd kept it in either his draw or pocket making sure that he always had it with him. Harry didn’t know why he did but he just felt like because it wasn't his he should take extra caution over it’s wellbeing. Luckily or rather, unluckily Harry kept to his previous need to keep it near him and had it in his pocket. He didn't want to give it back, he'd gotten used to its weight in his pocket, having the constant thrum of magic against his thigh or in his robes (which is where it was now), so he was reluctant to give it back but Harry couldn't morally keep Draco's wand, could he? No. It would be wrong. So Harry reached into his robe pocket and produced Draco’s wand, wordlessly gave it to Malfoy and then picked up his pace to catch up to his friends.
Harry knows that he's got no real chance at a relationship with Draco but still he can't stop himself from hoping. Because if he hopes then he has something to strive for something to live for someone to live for. But as Harry looks over at Draco sitting with his head down looking paler than usual and duller than a light bulb that’s about to go out, Harry realises that maybe Draco needs something to hope for too and decides to be that for Draco and finally accept his hand in friendship.
Draco had no idea why he was doing this. Really he just wanted to see if he would turn out to be a ferret. Since his fourth year at Hogwarts he’d wanted to know if his animagus would be a ferret, like what that horrible Mad Eye turned him into. It was a truly horrific day, first Potter barely paid him any attention, then when he finally had his chance the weasley ruined it AND on top of that Potter had the audacity to insult his mother. It didn’t even end there, no no, Moody came out of nowhere and transfigured him into a ferret, then tortured him until McGonagall had to save him. It was a horrid day, not to mention his talk with Snape.
That was until Malfoy bumped into Harry’s shoulder on his way past, turned around to look at Harry and said, “Oh look, the saviour of the wizarding world doesn't even know how to walk.”
“But it is my fault, ever since the war I haven't been able to eat anything and if I try I just end up throwing it up.” Draco explained.
“Whatever, as long as you're gone I don't care what you do or why you do it.” Draco had started to gather his books for transfiguration.
He was one of the last to breakfast, sitting down next to Blase and across from Pansy. He quickly ate some toast, slathered in butter and honey, and washed it down with tea, sweetened with two sugars and a spoonful of honey, with milk lightening the colour. Pansy gave him a look that said you’re late, but we’ll talk about it later. Blase barely looked at him, too absorbed in his conversation with Nott to pay any attention to his surroundings.
“OK.” Draco said then shamelessly added, “What were you thinking about anyway, it must have been good because you're blushing so much.” Draco laughed.
He explained how sorry he was for all he’d done over the years. Said that he realised the error in his ways and that he wanted to change, that he wanted to help Potter defeat the Dark Lord. While he explained this Potter nodded, not speaking, just letting Draco talk. Then he started to smile, no he started to grin.
“Merlin, do my ears deceive me or did the famous Harry Potter just say ‘fuck’?” Draco was laughing too.
“Sometimes I regret all of my life choices, this is one of those times.” Draco said, shaking his head.
“Potter, what are you doing?” Draco swept his legs over the side of the couch and sat facing Potter.
“Look, no one knows about this, not Ron, not ‘mione, no one. So you have to promise not to tell anyone.” Harry said very seriously.
“No you’re not. Look Potter, I know that you think you can do anything because you’re the chosen one, but really you can’t. And you can’t just sit there and watch me sleep. For one thing, it’s creepy and for another, it’s creepy. Now leave before I make you.” Draco pointed his wand at Potter.
“Yeah it is a bit, but let's just go back to my room and we can talk do whatever.” Harry put his arm around Draco.
Potter ran over to Draco and pulled him to his chest, hugging him, “Hey, hey Draco, it’s ok, I forgive you. I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” Potter whispered, soothingly and stroked Draco’s back with one hand, the other running slowly through Draco’s hair. Draco hugged Potter back, clinging to him for dear life.
“Well firstly, I said you take long showers, then I said that your cock is--” Draco cut him off before Harry could finish.
This brought Harry back to reality, the one where he wasn't with Draco and where he still hadn't come out to his friends who were dragging him onto a train.
“The famous Harry Potter just complimented me, this is the best day of my life.” Draco said sarcastically.
Draco shook his head and pulled back again, “No, it’s not ok, it never will be. How can you forgive me, I was going to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts to kill Dumbledore, I still have to. If I don't He’ll kill them, He’ll kill me. I’m so sorry, Harry, I’m so sorry.” Draco stood up and started to run again, too ashamed of himself to stay.
“What’d you mea- oh right, well I don't care anymore so just go, would you?” Draco remembered the events of the previous night.
“Then that doesn’t matter, all that matters is that I love you and we’ll get through this, everything will be OK.” Harry felt Draco melt into him.
He makes his way to the slytherin dorms, keeping to the walls and shadows to stay inconspicuous. It didn’t work. That damned Potter just has to ruin everything. Of course he sees Draco. Potter doesn’t just glance at him either, no, he looks almost like he recognises Draco, THEN, he picks Draco up. Picks HIM up. He also smiles at Draco! It’s like he wants to annoy Draco.
Hermoine gave them a look that said “You’re late” as they sat down at the end of the Gryffindor table to have breakfast, still holding hands. Harry returned the look with one of his own that he hoped would say “I know, but I don’t care”. She went back to eating her breakfast and reading from ‘The Prophet’. After a few moments of silence Draco spoke up and said, “Can I read that when you’re done ‘Mione?”
The throwing up started during his sixth year. After becoming a death eater and having the Dark Lord live at the manner with him and his family, it became impossible for him to keep any food down. He'd thought that it would stop once the war was over, that he would go back to normal, be able to eat and dream and sleep and just be happy. He should have known better. He hadn't been able to eat, sleep or stop the nightmares after -- and during -- the war.
“Yeh, I'm good, I just got lost in thought and you startled me out of it.” Harry explained, trying to be honest.
Sorry for not posting for about a month, I've just been really busy with school and work and I just couldn't be bothered to write. But I finally finished this next chapter - there is some smut in it - and I hope you like it.
Then the two were kissing again, more intensely and passionately than before. Harry broke the kiss to ask, “How do you want to do this?”
After a few more thrusts of his hips Harry pulled out and flopped down next to Draco. Draco groaned from the ache of his stretched hole as he rolled over to lie on Harry's chest. “Sorry, let me help with that.” Harry said as he reached for his wand. He cast a quick cleaning spell on himself and Draco then a simple healing spell to quell the pain Draco was feeling.
As soon as Draco got back to Harry's room he started to take off his clothes and put another of Harry's T-shirts on then got back into Harry's bed. Harry watched as Draco did this then he also got changed back into his boxers and a
Draco didn't have as much luck as Harry. Draco was plagued with thoughts of Harry. This wasn't new to him, Draco thought of Harry a lot especially before he went to sleep. But his thoughts of Harry were usually the hateful kind, so when he started thinking of how soft Harry's lips looked or how much he wanted to touch Harry's hair (and other parts of Harry too) he started to freak out a little. He lay awake for a long time that night, thinking of Harry, eventually he couldn't ignore his erection any longer so he wanked to the thought of Harry. Draco chalked it up to his hormones, he didn't actually think of Harry that way he was just horny and he was becoming good friends with Harry and it was just all of these new emotions towards Harry that were not romantic or sexual at all. Right?
“Oh, sorry. At least we can still make dinner.” Harry said, stretching as he sat up too. He started laughing.
“Ha, I know all about your reputation and it’s going to be changed right here, right now.” Draco said proudly.
“You don't need to apologise.” Draco said after a beat. “I think I just need a second to digest this information, OK?”
“I do love you but if you don't send a letter to your mother then she will probably come here and kill me.” Harry brought one of his hands to cup Draco's cheek.
Though these days there was someone else on Harry’s mind, three guesses who, yep, you got it, it was Draco Malfoy.
He then apologised to hermione and Ron, for not just the slurs and name calling but for any harm he may have caused them in their pursuit to rid the world of the dark lord. He made it abundantly clear that he would do what he could to help them from now on.
“You are brave though, and I know it seems as though I'm brave but without everyone helping me I would have been cowering in a corner long ago.” Harry's attempt at joking didn't work so he gave in to the seriousness of the conversation.
That was all the thought he could give it because his erection was becoming painful and required wanking. So, Harry got back to bed pulled his pyjama pants down (they had little snitches on them -- Ron had given them to Harry for his birthday) and also his boxers, seized his cock, said a wand less lubrication spell and started to rub his throbbing prick faster and faster -- thinking about Draco doing this to him or sucking him off or a whole lot of things -- until he came in his fist. He laid there for a few minutes revealing in his orgasim before he cast another scourgify on himself. He went to sleep thinking about Draco and his wand, then thinking about Draco's actual wand and if Draco would confront him about it again tomorrow.
Out of breath but finally sure he was alone he slowed down to a walk again, he always came here when he needed to be alone. It was his only sanctuary, the Room of Requirement, full of everything and nothing at the same time. It was whatever he chose it to be, all he wanted right now, a couch. He’d brought a book but what he wanted, needed more than anything was a nap. Draco put his book on the floor next to the couch, draped his blanket on it and layed on the couch curled up under the blanket.
To which malfoy responded “Yeah, actually I do have a problem,” he paused for a second to consider his next words carefully, “I have a problem with you stealing my wand. Which if you still have I would like it back.”
After a few more seconds, while both boys caught their breaths Harry pulled out of Draco and used a quick wand less charm to clean the sheets and both the boys. As Harry laid down he pulled Draco down with him, letting the other boy rest his head on Harry's chest, Harry kissed the top of Draco's head. “I could get used to that.” Draco said, already half asleep.
“You ready to write to your mother?” Harry asked, voice muffled due to his lips still being pressed to Draco's head.
Draco finished his food and abruptly got up, all eyes turned to him, “Um, thanks for being so kind to me, I know I don’t deserve it, so thanks. I’ll be leaving now though, I’ve got a lot of homework to do so I’m going to go to that now. Anyway, um, bye.” Draco had never felt so inarticulate, so vulnerable, he didn’t know what to do so he just left, as swiftly as he could. He didn’t want those eyes on him anymore. He definitely didn’t want Potter’s eyes on him anymore, finally looking at him like a friend. So long he wanted Potter to look at him like that, so long that it didn’t feel real. Almost like it was forced, or imagined.
“I don't want to go to class either but I also don't want to go to detention.” Harry kissed Draco's shoulder.
Draco wasn’t going to lie, he would have loved to take Potter up on his offer, but he really needed to get out of here. So, as soon as Potter’s back was turned he made a break for it. The door was left open by one of the others so Draco could slip through. He leaped down the stairs and out the portrait hole, left open by another careless Gryffindor. He ran as far and as fast as he could, slowing only once he got to the corridor that led to the Slytherin dorms. He checked to see if anyone was around, surprisingly no one was, and changed back.
“Right well, if you won't let me thank you for that then let me thank you for not telling Bellatrix that it was me in the manor that day.” Harry was looking at his hands, it seemed as though he was remembering that day.
“I didn’t say anything because I was waiting for you to say something first. I came up here to give you the chance to say something, when you didn’t I realised that I would have to, I just wanted to give you the chance to tell me.” Potter got up, “Well I guess that’s it then, I’ll see you later.” Potter started walking to the door and Draco got an insane idea.
Harry got to Draco’s door and knocked on it. It seemed that Draco was in the middle of getting dressed because what Harry saw when the door was opened aroused him. Draco was standing in the doorway on just his boxers and socks,hair mussed and sticking up every which way. Harry had never seen Draco this way, so casual and vulnerable. Harry almost turned around and left in fear that he wouldn't be able to stop himself from taking Draco right at that moment. Though Draco saved him the trouble by saying, “Oh, sorry, I'll just put my clothes on and I'll be ready to go in a minute.”
“What? No, you can't!” Draco was still lying down but he had his arms outstretched towards Harry. “Please Harry come back, keep kissing me.” Draco was begging Harry.
“Well I should have just said something earlier. Instead I said nothing and made you think I was weird or that I'd done something to your wand.”
“I didn't tell you because there's nothing you can do to help, and I deserve it anyway, after everything I did in the war, I deserve this.” Draco said also sitting up to face Harry.
“OK, but I'm telling you now, nothing can tame my hair.” Harry was in the chair now, facing the mirror.
Harry was panicking. Draco was getting dressed in front of him. What was he supposed to do? Did he start talking? Did he turn away? Was he supposed to go? Harry had no idea, but luckily Draco saved him again by saying, “I'm surprised that you're dressed before me. Like, usually, I'm one of the first down to the great hall for breakfast.”
“Hey love.” Harry said as he kissed the top of Draco's head. Despite the fact that Draco was taller than Harry, Draco still made himself smaller so he could fit into Harry's arms and feel properly comforted.
“Did the famous Harry Potter just say that I was right.” Draco cut him off, but Harry grabbed a pillow and hit Draco with it.
“That's all in the past now so don't worry about it OK, we're friends now.” Draco wanted this trip down memory lane to be over.
Draco curled into Potter, relaxing into his touch as the boy began to stroke his back again, so soft and soothing, Draco wondered why he was so mean to this boy so full of love. If only things had gone different that first day they met, and their first day at Hogwarts together as well, maybe they could have been friends. Draco didn’t get to dwell on this for too long because after only a few moments he fell asleep.
“Honestly I’ve slept better the past two nights than I have my whole life. I’m meant to hate you, but, I just feel so much better when you’re around, like you keep me grounded or something, I don’t know, I’m not very good at expressing my feelings. I can hardly identify them most of the time anyway.” Harry laughed without humor.
Not that it mattered anyway, especially with what he did during the war, he deserved this. It was his punishment for becoming a Death Eater.
“I'm not that brave Harry.” Draco said genuinely feeling as though he was a coward. “I'm definitely not as brave as you.” Draco added.
He couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t get comfortable, he thought of Harry, how warm he is, how when Draco curled up as a ferret next to him he could always sleep. He may not have Harry but he did have himself, he could curl up as a ferret. Perhaps that would help him sleep, the past two nights were better than any this year, maybe it would help.
“Hey Draco it’s OK if you don’t love me. You don’t have to love me. OK just take some deep breaths and calm down a little.”
“Well that's not very nice.” when Draco just continued to glare at Harry he relented “Fine, fine I'll go, but only because I need to get my stuff.” Harry turned towards the door to go.
“Yeah? Oh Merlin, what time is it?” Harry looked around, then he reached down beside the couch to retrieve his glasses.
“You don't need to thank me, in fact I should have given it to you earlier, I don't know why I didn't.” Harry said a bit sheepishly.
“Like this?” Draco asked. Harry nodded in approval as he moved off the bed. Harry quickly removed his boxers and settled himself between Draco's spread legs, admiring the way the position allowed him to see all of Draco. He kissed his way up Draco's thighs to his lips where he lingered for a second, his left hand stroked along Draco’s cock and his right hand went to Draco’s entrance. After breaking the kiss he asked, “Wanna know one of the wand less spells I learned?” he circled Draco's entrance with his middle finger.
“Well I wouldn't have walked into you if you learned how to walk!” Malfoy returned a little too loud, causing people to look in their direction. This made Harry more than a little uncomfortable so he simply said “whatever malfoy.” and continued walking. Surprisingly draco also continued walking and was striding along next to Harry, invading Harry’s personal space slightly and sneering at Harry until Harry broke and asked, with as much annoyance as he could muster “Problem?”
Draco woke up a few hours later, disoriented. He felt something move beneath him, then he remembered, “Harry?” he looked down and evidently he was no longer a ferret.
“If I'd have known that all it took was giving you food I would have done this sooner.” Draco laughed, still blushing.
“Maybe, but you still helped us even if it was just so I would win, that was still really brave of you to do, hey maybe you should have been a Gryffindor.” Harry was trying to change the serious convocation back to joking again to ease the tension.
Harry walked into the bathroom and heard a sound that he recognised as someone vomiting. He quickly ran to the source of the sound and found Draco kneeling over the toilet and vomiting. Harry knelt down behind Draco and rubbed small circles on Draco's back to ease his sickness. Harry also muttered some encouraging words, ‘It's OK.’, ‘You're almost done.’, ‘Take some deep breaths and try to calm down.’ etc.
Yes this would work, if Draco could just explain to Potter that he has had a change of heart, that he wants to help and that he’s sorry for all he’s done in the past, then maybe, just maybe Potter would forgive him. Draco looks back at Potter, so peaceful, and trots onto his stomach, curls up and falls asleep, content with his decision to formally switch sides of the war.
Draco remembered that day too, he knew it was Harry. He would know Harry anywhere even if he was blind, deaf and stupid. But he just couldn't do that to Harry, he had wanted Harry to win the war anyway so it was just a good opportunity for him to give Harry a way to win. “Yeah well, I just wanted you to win, my life at the manor was horrible and I knew that if I said it wasn't you, then I'd be able to get out of that hell-hole.” Draco confessed. He didn't know when he got so comfortable with Harry but he was glad that he did because otherwise this would be really oversharing.
“Ok, ok. On- the-the count of th-three we... will both stop laughing.” Draco said, barely able to get his sentence out.
“It’s ok, now why don’t you do what you came up here to and have a nap, and you know what I’m going to nap too, you can sleep on my stomach, if you still want to sleep in your animagus form.” Harry said, as he started to lie back.
Harry laughed even harder, “no! No more laughing! Just take a deep breath.” Draco tried. “Stop it!” Draco’s sides hurt and his cheeks were aching, he just wanted to stop laughing, he didn’t even think. He really didn’t mean to, he was just suddenly kissing Harry Potter. “I- sorry, I just had to stop laughing,” Draco broke the kiss.
Draco lunged forward, knocking Harry’s hand out of the way to hug him, he squeezed Harry so hard, scared that he would change his mind, or that he wasn’t being serious, “You’ve no idea what that means to me, no idea.”
By the time all his classes for the day were over and he could go back to Harry’s dorm room, and was finally able to see Harry again, (they had a different schedule for their lunch period so they couldn't see each other then) he practically melted into Harry's waiting arms.
Harry cut him off saying, “Potter? I guess I must be in a lot of trouble for you to call me Potter.”
Draco’s plan was going well so far, he’d gotten his homework done and was making his way to his dorm to put his things away. However, he didn’t quite make it when he was accosted by Pansy. He’d forgotten that she would want to talk about why he was so late to breakfast.
“I promise, no one but me will know.” Draco said making a cross over his chest with an index finger.
Once Draco finished his breakfast he looked up, he just couldn’t help himself, though he wasn’t expecting the chosen one’s eyes on him. He just wanted to glance at that arrogant prick, but now he was locked in a staring contest with Potter. Draco started to worry that maybe Potter was on to him, that he knew Draco was the ferret, but he couldn’t know, not really. Sure Potter could suspect that it was him but, Potter can’t possibly know. Draco would be safe so long as he alway made sure never to give Potter any reason to suspect him. Still Potter was staring at him, the worst part was that Draco didn’t even mind, in fact he liked it, more than liked it, it was turning him on. He had to look away just to prevent an erection. What was happening to him? He hated Potter, he didn’t get turned on by him. That was something that was not meant to happen. All he did was accidentally sleep in Potter’s bed with him. There was no reason to feel this way about Potter. He’d have to worry about it later though because he had potions now, with Potter as well, hopefully he wouldn’t get too distracted.
However, horrors aside, being a ferret had its advantages. He could sneak around the castle unnoticed, spy on people, sneak out of the dorms or the manor and not get caught. He could do a myriad of things and go unnoticed, he could get away with anything. Especially now, in sixth year, when he had been given a very important task by The Dark Lord himself, it would be so much easier to complete if he could sneak around as a ferret.
“I’m happy because I get to kiss you and tell you I love you.” he kissed Draco’s forehead to prove his point.
Draco was the first over the edge, crying out as he did and tensing as he finally released his load onto the bed sheets. Harry went over the edge seconds after as the walls of Draco's arse went suddenly tight, and Harry finished inside of Draco.
Draco walked through the open doors, looking behind himself only once to make sure no one was watching. When he was sure he was out of sight, he ran. Ran all the way to his dorm. When he got there he grabbed a book and a blanket from his trunk, then he was running again.
He had to give it to Draco, though, the punch was spot on. It was as if he’d been keeping a good eye on Sirius with his punching bag for a while - or did Sirius give him private lessons?
His second heat happened on the 6th of October and took half a day of build up and lasted the night. It seemed like his cycle went for a little less than three months, so - without anymore irregularities to his cycle - his heat was due somewhere around the end of December to the start of January… But he was fooling himself if he really believed that his guess could be certain, the unusualness of it all was making it all impossible to predict accurately.
,” Pansy yawned into her pawed hand, the other directed towards the Alpha with her claws extended. “I look good.”
“If I’m going to be honest,” He continued, turning slightly around to look back at Harry. Green eyes were boldly staring back.
“It’s settled then. Draco will stay with you throughout his heat, and will return to school as soon as he’s ready.”
He wasn’t dancing seriously, Draco wasn’t sure if Harry even knew how to. Harry just looked like he was only in it to have fun, to listen and to participate, rather than to be the best. Draco looked over at the corner of the Hall where the Slytherin’s controlled, he instantly made out Adrian and Blaise competitively dancing, each one offering a perfectly performed traditional Wizard’s dance, to the point they were both a little flushed and puffed out. Draco decided Harry wasn’t worth over-performing for anyway, likely he wouldn’t have appreciated the complexity of the choreography.
“Those are mine!” Luna gasped, struggling to get up from her spot on the floor. She must have been there for a while because she wobbled and had to catch herself with her hands on the grass a couple of times before she could stand. “Give those back, I need those to see the Warblers.”
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes, and he shakily raised his own hand to give a little wave goodbye in return.
The walk back to the castle was a shameful one, he was in a shock blanket conjured up by Snape. It was bright orange and felt like a target on his back.
“That’s fair. You said you coped okay because you were put on suppressants early like you were supposed to… But that can’t be it, surely? Is there nothing else keeping you from exploding? What have you done that keeps you from needing an Alpha?”
Severus scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Oh, please. If it were up to me you would have been on the next train back to Grimmauld Place, as your Mother wanted. Waiting for any bonds on you to fizzle and die.”
Once over the threshold of the slope, lo-and-behold Harry Potter there waiting for him in front of the castle’s entrance. He was propped up with his arms crossed against one of the stone pillars up the stairs leading to the grand door, even still several kilometres away Draco couldn’t mistake the height and black mop of hair.
“Very well.” Dumbledore said, accepting defeat this time, and nodded once to the young Omega. “Speak to me in three days with who you have chosen. They would have to agree to the terms we have just discussed.”
It started with a bright ball of light being made within the cup of his hands. He couldn’t believe it. But then it started to grow, uncontrollable, the wind around him howled and his sleeping clothes flapped in the wind.
‘Why is it so important?’ Harry asked, feeling uncomfortable by how drastic a turn the conversation had taken since greeting the man and sitting.
. He should have known it wouldn’t have lasted long. He regretted not asking more questions, but it was hard to when Snape was hellbent on belittling Draco in every way possible. It was unfortunate that the man was an absolute cunt -
“Sounds good,” the dark haired Alpha said, not quite looking at Dumbledore, more interested in staring perfervidly at Draco himself. “See ya then.”
“Draco, stop,” Harry said to him. Draco could hear him, but he wished he couldn’t - the Alpha’s tone was loud enough to cut through the music but he wasn’t shouting, it cooled the burning in him.
“There is evidence that both moments are related,” the older man said, pleased with the prompt. He sat down in his office chair, leaning back. “If you remember, you brought about this lack of control with your heightened emotions. You felt frightened and helpless with your rapist - “ Draco flinched at the brash phrasing “ - and then you felt depressed when you obsessively thought about everything that could make yourself feel worse. Omegas are emotional creatures, boy, your emotions greatly affect your scent and the way your magic behaves. Try and think about something else.”
Finally after what felt like an excruciatingly long time, Sirius slowed his pace and peeled into a nearby road. Once stopped, Draco ripped off his helmet and stumbled away by unhooking a leg and hopping a couple of steps back, but once standing his legs betrayed him with a slight tremble and he realised he needed to brace himself against the motorbike for a few seconds longer until he recovered his bearings. He also now noticed how his fingers, which were pale blue and still slightly hooked at the joints, looked like a corpse after Rigor mortis set in…The site was unsettling to say the least. As he made a show of not looking like the trip had been too much for him, Draco looked up in time to see Sirius shake off his own helmet into his awaiting gloved hands, that inky black hair was slightly damp from sweat and had formed multiple tangled ringlets. The man only spared Draco a quick smile before snapping his fingers, the motorbike and both their helmets blinked out of existence, then he made his way to the magically revealed door of Grimmauld Place.
From above Draco could see the dozens of curious heads poking out from the shattered windows to see what had happened below. It would be a miracle if the Headmaster could explain how an area mass the size of a small Quidditch pitch was burnt to cinders without mentioning Draco. Perhaps they could say a dragon flew over and sneezed?
“Okay. Thank you. You’re right. Anyway, I’ll see you soon. I’ve got to check in with Romilda to see if the band is ready to start, I think most of the students are here now. Dumbledore’ll begin his opening ceremony any minute now.”
“Draco? What are you doing, darling?” That was Pansy’s voice, she prowled from out of the shadows, hands behind her back. One of her dark eyebrows was quirked up questioningly. “I was on my way to the kitchens. Did you want to come with and sneak some food to bring back to the common room?”
The potion he downed this morning had been somewhat of a relief, but experiencing his first day back at school after everything was still a headache on its own.
Snape had his arms crossed and he was tapping his fingers to his bicep, waiting for an actual answer. His black brow quirked.
She didn’t respond, but she couldn’t hide for long, and Draco found her ducked down nearby an owl’s perch - she had on a cloud-patterned pale blue dress and was sitting on her backpack, there was a book in her hand. A textbook.
omg welcome!!!!!!!! thanks for checking out the story and i hope you guys have a good time reading :^) <3
“Only if you say yes,” Harry looked up at him, there was a twinkle in his eyes. He wasn’t wearing glasses, Draco finally realised. You could easily make out the thick lashes surrounding the edges of his eyes.
“Listen to me right now. Stop.” The warning rumble of a powerful Alpha emerged from that bulging, stubbled throat.
EDIT: no seriously thank u so so much for sticking around and reading this long omg... this story is 86k long now... that's a lot of words to go through :'O we'll pop champagne at the 100k mark!
“Yes, whatever. Can you tell me anything or am I wasting my time?” If this didn’t work out he fortunately had another plan in his cards, but he’d rather the ghost tell him now so he didn’t have to spend much longer in this dirty, abandoned bathroom than he had to.
“Move it!” Draco snapped at a small crowd of Second Years in his path, they scuttled uncoordinatedly out of his way. Pansy snickered as she stuck her tongue out at them.
Although Vincent, Greg, Millicent, and Theodore never did turn up this semester. Draco wasn’t so sure if he’d ever see them again. Draco wasn’t sure if Headmaster Dumbledore ever expected the record number of Slytherin student pull-outs after his Daily Prophet statement; even a few pureblooded families with children in other houses were holding the attendance of their children hostage. One thing Draco knew more than anyone was how rooted into their beliefs conservative families could be. More than
impatiently waiting for their arrival, and they hurried up the stairs without stopping to question it.
It wasn’t until later into the night did Sirius jerk back awake. A sound came from Draco’s room, like he’d fallen out of bed - an unmistakably bodily crash followed by a pained groan. For a long time after that no other sounds followed. The smell that crept from the room to meet Sirius was akin to torture, like he was held back from an oasis by a flimsy wooden door.
Now was his chance. He took a breath and slowly started to rise, intending to follow. “I’ll see you guys later…”
He then kept his attention on the clock, following the progress of the second hand as it came full circle. His ink well had dried by now and his quill was sticking unpleasantly to his clammy hand, his other was drumming an incoherent rhythm with his fingertips on his knee.
Once they got to her dormitory and rushed to her bed, Draco settled into her mountain of Pegasus-feather stuffed pillows, the feeling of them on his back made him hiss in pleasure. Pansy busied herself by yanking closed the curtains around them, keeping out the curious eyes of some of the girls that idled around the room, then she put up a skilled silencing charm. She picked up a plush toy pygmy puff and handed it over to the blond, who took it in his hands and clutched it to his chest, using it both as a cushion to prop his chin on and a thing to squeeze his frustrations into without actually killing something. Pansy herself held on to silver unicorn in her own arms.
“To be honest? I’m not all that into Omegas. No offense, you’re lovely. I just can’t really stand the smell for too long, I don’t like losing control.”
That large, toothy mouth split open. Greyback started to laugh. It rumbled and echoed in the amphitheatre.
“Oh, okay. Thanks.” Draco heard Harry say in response, his heart was too busy beating to the point of a heart attack for the Omega to manage words.
At some point late into the night, Draco had managed to slip out of bed. He stumbled and collapsed onto his belly on the floor, and the freezing wooden boards against his exposed, sweaty skin made him scream suddenly. It shocked his system and he scrambled to his knees and hands -  he spared a glance at the door, to see if Sirius was still outside. No one knocked, or called out to him to see if he was okay, so he must have been alone.
He refused to glance at the dark-haired boy, determined to pretend he wasn’t there. But it was like someone had rubbed his Alpha scent on every possible surface, it was so much it was becoming sickening. He was physically making himself ill having to inhale so much of the other boy. They were supposed to be doing observation sketches of cursed items when Snape first noticed Draco raise his head to look out the window to clear his mind, a bird was soaring past.
so sorry for the length of time it took to finally get this out there!!!! i wish i had a beta reader but it's just me, my bong, and google translate for a few hours lmao
“Feels like it’s been hours,” Draco groaned with his eyes shut, Pansy combed out a knot forming in his hair. “Maybe I should mutinise? I’d be a great Headmaster.”
“I don’t believe Draco is capable to set aside his personal beliefs to do what it takes to bond with you, Harry.”
believe this was all it would take to win Draco over? Pretty little favours? But to Draco's horror - after long days in solitude - it was working. The man had fucking snatched him so hard it left bruises for days. He’d shouted in his face and insulted him in front of people over something Draco couldn’t control. He was an old bastard who, just like Harry, was just biologically succumbed to infatuation over his sex Draco had no choice being.
“I’m so, so sorry, Draco… It’s… This is important. It has to be this way or you’ll get worse. You can’t control it, you know you can’t. There’s no way you can fix it. I had to tell him what you were going to do…” Lucia was crying now, holding herself tightly as she did. Each tear was the size of a small coin, rolling clear down her freckled face to drop in rapid succession from her chin.
They walk down the series of steps in silence, until they reach the classroom. It’s filled with light-coloured wooden desks, their legs had spiralling plants on them. All around the room hung different types of potted plants and pots, Draco had never seen so many
Her big blue eyes blinked. “Alright… Could you help me hand out my the next copy of the Quibbler, it’s coming out Tuesday. I wouldn’t normally ask but it’s just been so popular.”
On queue, after the last person had made it off the stage, a swarm of shadow animals rushed to the stage. They glided against the floors and walls, then peeled off like shavings of black paper. They drifted and fluttered into the air weightlessly. Then exactly as Draco had cast, they performed an ornate dance routine against the colourful sources of light. Soon they draw together to create a little picture show of Hogwarts, its founders, and the Pagan Witch history following the epic tradition of Samhain, leading to Halloween. No one asked him to do it, and just because it was a punishment didn’t mean he’d hand in shoddy work. Draco was always proud of his work. And he was a great fan of history.
and don't mind me just casually adding boxing into this.. it's more just for kink. guys boxing is just....*chefs kiss* muah. ;-))
“Darling!” Pansy greeted happily, noticing his arrival through the wall, she lifted up part of the quilted blanket beside her as an invitation for the Omega to slip in.
“I do… I really do.” Draco said, heartbroken and feeling a little nauseous. He had almost been in a very similar situation, considering his odds bonding with Sirius Black, who was his second-cousin and twice his age. He needed to know more. “So why do you reckon it’s like this?” Why did all their magic come out of them like a burst damn? Why was it so difficult to control?
The dark Wizard, not man, never a man, was an unstoppable machine, and his fragile alliances was making things difficult for him.
As soon as they made it to the stone Gargoyle, they were surprised to see it was already standing aside, like it was
Voldemort laughed, a black, oily sounding thing, then acquitted her betrayal to the Malfoy’s being weak. Merely Alphas pathetically helpless to the charms of an Omega. “You can’t help it, your nature is inherently flawed. Pack of stupid
the Omega was staring down at his plate, his snow white hair stood out like a beacon against all the black, brown, and deep green that surrounded him. Even from one end of the Great Hall Harry could make out that sweet blush marbling his pale skin - it was no mistaking it, since the whole hall was buzzing with gossip about Head Master Dumbledore’s announcement. Although, it was a little hard to tell but it seemed the Slytherin table was solemnly quiet about the whole ordeal.
His magic would occur during unusual times, like he could control it, or even more questionably it wouldn’t appear at all during times it was expected to most.
“Yes…” Blaise sat down at the foot of the bed, respectfully keeping his distance but maintaining his intense eye contact. Their silhouettes were lit by the glow of the lake coming through the windows, beside them kelp brushed against the glass, and a school of fish hurried past. He wanted to make this meeting quick. “I think it would be beneficial for the both of us if you were to bond to me instead of Potter.”
The wolf - enormous, scarred, and greying - approaches him, it merely phases through the wall of trees like a ghost.
Snape paused, snarled, and then leant back far enough that he was once again leaning against the open door.
“I don’t know…I just.” Draco rubbed at his eyes, they were watering up again, he was too exhausted to come up with a good enough lie.
“Please do, I’d love to share notes.” She stuffed the mystical bright pink artefact back into her canvas book bag. “So not much time for a strategy, huh?”
Like Draco had predicted, Sirius was there waiting for him on the platform. Instead of on his motorbike, however, he was sitting on a bench - the screeching metal contraption of death probably parked somewhere outside.
The Alpha swung in for a bicep-bulging bear hug, crushing a pop out of Draco’s spine somewhere. Draco stuttered but didn’t push himself free, he couldn’t quite believe what was happening and stood there frozen in place.
Blaise couldn’t help the smile. “Why would an Alpha like me want to be bonded to a powerful and influential Omega like yourself?”
“Alright, alright.” Sirius ebbed off. “So what’s the plan? He’s training it back here and I deliver him to Grimmauld?”
Sparing no time to waste, their helmets were enchanted over their heads, and then with a harsh lurch forward they kicked off into the streets. As soon as they were out of site from the main roads, the bike tilted onto its back wheel and launched into the sky.
Her skin still tingled from the remnants of the Crucio curse and Narcissa couldn’t help the full-bodied shiver coursing through her. She couldn’t remember who struck her with it first, if it was the Dark Lord himself, or her sister, or another servant. She remembered how terrible it was, and how loud her screams sounded in her ears. It was like her blood was boiling inside, while a current of first-degree electricity ran through her nervous system. It felt endless, like an eternal, time-capsulated Hell on Earth.
pikes a real dude - but he's from the movies - so i thought hell with it and chucked him in too.. i needed more cast members while also pulling out quite a few lol!!! and let's all just pretend marcus is in draco's year. i was running out of people hahahah
,” she said, without hesitation. “After everything, you owe me a hell of a lot more.” Draco looked down to see a smile threatening to take over that firm pout, her perfect lips looked like they were cut from diamonds as the low-light glittered in her pink gloss.
He took a calming breath through his nose and watched himself in the grimy mirror, rust stains were peppered over his reflection.
“But he declined.” He said, sarcastically self-pitying. “It’s not you, if you’ve been wondering what the hell is keeping you out of his pants. If I’m going to be honest I think he’s warming up to you. Pansy’s told me enough of the things her and Draco talk about involving you. He just wants to be treated like a normal person. Now the real reason why I’m here…” Zabini leant in, lowly growling to match his rival under his breath. The two Alphas shared a tense moment where no one spoke, and the growls were rumbling in their chests like a pair of lions squaring off territory.
Potter slowly trodded his way down the stairs until he was towering a head over Draco, who stood his ground with every muscle taught and strung under his clothes, his chin jutted up like a weapon. They stared at each other haughtily for ages until Harry finally faltered. His big green eyes glowed in the reflection of his glasses, and his tan skin looked flushed by the blood obviously rushing to fill his head.
It didn’t help just how pretty he was. Pale grey eyes, full pink lips, and perfect, unblemished skin. He was a fantasy made flesh. His white hair made him look timeless. Draco Malfoy had the beauty to defy age itself, and he’d possibly never look ugly in his life.
“Hmm…Yes, and I suppose I share many similarities to a Pygmy Puff. Skin, the ability to defecate. However, still, I’m not a weak, frilly, dulled creature that only cares about eating and being bred. Creatures like that belong away from schools and kept at home, nothing more than pretty, out-of-fashion pets.”
also! lemme know if theres a scene you'd wanna see illustrated, ill draw the one with most fan clout. still coming up with some rough sketches as i post this now.
Draco felt Harry brush a strand of stark blond hair out of his face and stare deeply into his eyes, earnestly listening. That same hand trailed down the curves and contours of his face, stopping to cup his jaw, the tips of his fingers brushing the lobe of his ear.
“That’s great news.” Dumbledore looked agitated, and very tired, despite the earliness of the night.
“Well, you didn’t say anything either. I thought you were still figuring things out.” She said through another bite of her sandwich.
Maybe it was the alcohol muddying his brain, or maybe because it was just Pansy… But Draco couldn’t help but stare off into the warm fire and ponder the question seriously.
keep his body satisfied. Instead, Dumbledore unloads this crackpot tale of an Omega who was so unusually powerful that he takes out an Alpha nearly twice his size, then again nearly taking out the school. He had a line on hand of exceptional Alpha’s willing to mate with him, satisfying a great deal of people and organisations for traditional reasons, but it would also bring relief to his family to know that he was now properly looked after. Not only that, no matter the number of times this proud Omega is told about his horrifying magical curse, that it could either kill himself or others, he still insists on going through this crazy ordeal on his own,
watched in amazement at the performance. Draco felt a pull to look away, and turned, surprised to see Lucia staring sadly at him.
“How much do you know, Harry?” The Headmaster leant further back into the purple leather chair, sighing as he did.
By the time he made it to the top floor he was flushed and slightly sweaty. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, the other pushed in the door to the final set of stairs leading up to the owl’s keep. He gasped out a wheezy “Luna?” Into the tower, the sound travelled up the spiral stone way and echoed for a couple of seconds. If she didn’t respond he was going to assume she wasn’t up there, he didn’t want to pointlessly walk all the way up only to make his way back down again.
Now that they were alone together, Draco couldn’t help himself, he had to ask a question that’d been gnawing at him all week.
The Dark Arts teacher lead Draco up all seven floors (eight including the dungeons) to the entrance of the spiralling staircase. The gargoyle stood there unmoving in their way.
“I smell something.” Slowly replied another deeper voice. It couldn’t be. Snape would have known. But Draco already knew, he knew what it meant when he saw Snape flee the ball with his hand clasped around his forearm through his sleeve. He wanted to pretend it would be okay, but it only wasted time. Draco was certain he knew who was here now.
“Must be confusing,” she said after a while, and then tossed another crumb to an adolescent elf owl. “All this mumbo-jumbo. I’m sure your family never talked about this stuff.”
The bell to end lunchtime rung throughout the school, but being the highest point of the castle the sound in the Owlery was a little faint. “Sorry I couldn’t be of more help,” she brushed her skirt of crumbs and hay. “If it makes you feel any better, an Alpha doesn’t have to be forever.”
Maybe the spiked punch was like liquid courage in his veins, or maybe he was sick of the angry memories that refused to go away, what ever it was it powered Draco’s strides and made him feel untouchable. He passed narrowly through the remaining crowd in his way, ducking and weaving around obstacles with practiced-ease. Once finally at the Professor’s side, Draco mimicked his posture, he crossed his arms over his chest and leant back against the stone wall. He let himself slide into shadow, he was now spending a moment alone and unseen with the Alpha.
He admired the way he looked - his clear skin was a little pink at the cheeks but not in a bad or unattractive way, his nearly white hair was tousled in deliberate loose waves to the side, his straight-cut jeans and cropped hem emerald shirt looked flattering and hugged him in all the right places. He looked expensive, with his fingers decorated in his collection of fine silver rings, several of them studded with green or black gems. He looked like a prize.
“And Draco,” Dumbledore said gravely, turning to him. The effect that grandfatherly frown had on a person was bizarre because Draco was suddenly feeling the shame that Potter must have been feeling.
finally!!!! i had this chapter sitting at around 3k words for ages and for most of that time i had no idea how to wrap it up! fairly happy with the chapter. and as an apology for taking so long i threw in a few doodles here and there! :-) thanks everyone for still giving kudos and leaving comments! it kept bringing me back to this story and reminding me to continue it!
They both knew he would, most likely returning with Harry for holidays once the official union was complete on his next coming heat. Draco couldn't escape, and almost laughed outloud at the morbid humour.
Draco’s luggage flew from out the last carriage to hover beside Draco’s shoulder, and he made his march from the train step over the platform gap towards the man now lifting himself off the bench. He was dressed in a denim jacket with a wooly cuff, in dark chinos and a thin grey shirt with an unbuttoned slit at the chest. Merlin, he looked as much of a teenage heart throb as Potter did, playing the contrasting persona of the rugged bad boy to Potter’s jock-all-star and boy-wonder.
Giving him a considerable once over, Harry was dressed up rather dedicatedly as some inaccurate portrayal of a Medieval muggle knight. He was never going to let Harry know that he was the inspiring source to his own costume idea.
. I would prefer we post-pone any information about his parents until he is bonded to Harry as planned.”
Headmaster Dumbledore had cut him off in the hall on the seventh floor that morning on his way to breakfast to casually fill him in that Draco had been sent back too Sirius for the week.
Like Monday, Tuesday’s classes were a blur. The only note worthy thing was how tense the usual banter during breakfast and lunch with the Slytherins felt, as if they hadn’t really recovered from the Luna incident on Saturday.
“No, Pans. Darling - shit - “ Draco dropped his mountain of tabloids to the floor, some of them slid and skid across the polished wood. “Listen to me, Pansy. I’m not upset with you. You piss me the hell off a great deal of times, but Morgana’s promise I would never hate you. A lot’s happened. A lot I’m not ready to talk about, and I’ve been having to deal with it a lot on my own. Lovegood was one of the first people to actually just think of me as a person since this awful summer break. I felt like I owed her, you understand don’t you. It’s like… Remember when you weren’t sure about those green robes to one of my parents functions, you were worried people would make fun of you? You were scared they’d call you a fat lime?”
,” Harry said again, coming closer. The intimidation, the power, the allure, what ever it was seemed to be working, and slowly it quelled the Omega’s rage.
"A vibration, a sound straight out of a cosmic-horror inspired nightmare, erupted from inside him. Draco couldn’t stop, or control, the energy rapidly building in his core, and only helplessly wrapped his arms around himself, hunched forward in pained submission. He tried to think peaceful thoughts, but anger would rear its powerful head and rip the thought to shreds, which only fuelled its intensity." me after burritos lol rip
Harry’s growling grew in volume, and his hand was slowly reaching for his wand hidden in his robe’s pocket. A few girls gasped at the mention of the Omega’s name, sounding confused and intrigued. Why couldn’t this scheming bastard have had this conversation somewhere more private?
“We haven’t had the time to find him yet, he may be in the Slytherin common room.” McGonagall said without looking up at him, she was busy spelling a weeping girl’s wound closed.
It roared around him and Draco was frightened someone was going to come running out any moment, surely someone could hear this…
“Okay…Draco… Stop this now.” Snape attempted to say calmly, leaning back into the chair as far as he could, obviously nervous. This wasn’t meant to be a practical exercise.
Draco nodded frantically at first, but slowed when it quickly made the new ringing in his ears worse. He forced his throat to produce the words. “Yes…Auntie.”
“Perfect, so did I.” Without warning Draco grabbed him by the neck of his shirt and dragged him along the corridor. The taller boy weakly argued and half-walked-half-stumbled after the abrasive Omega. The entirety of the floor felt un-intruded,
Narcissa gripped her skirts so tightly she might have stretched the expensive fabric. In translation: What did the Dark Lord know of Draco?
As soon as she had left down the halls of the dungeons, Blaise asked, “Have you thought about what I offered?”
Voldemort curled up a finger and the door swung open silently, opening from his magic. “Come in, Fenrir.”
“Yes…” He finally growled, he shifted sorely in his seat, wincing against the obvious bandages lining his upper body. He was only wearing a loose, exposing black shirt and dirty, blood stained jeans. His clothes always seemed to have blood on them, Narcissa never could find out who’s.
“It doesn’t only have to be Potter, does it?” Draco deduced, staring the old Alpha down challengingly. “I just need an Alpha.”
Before someone could rush in fast enough to grab a hold of Draco he was running forward, delighting in getting in a couple more punches. Potter gifted him the time to land four before he was holding Draco’s thinner forearms with his hands. The Omega wasn’t prepared for the jolt that came when his Alpha tugged him forward with a knee to his gut, he was launched upwards and flipped before crashing down onto the stone floors. Draco’s head was absolutely spinning. He couldn’t tell who’s voice was coming from who. So many people were screaming and shouting at him or for someone - or maybe they were trying to cast a spell. Possibly he was hexed? Everything just hurt so damn much.
And so Draco did. He shut his eyes and opened his clenched fists, palms out. Before his damned birthday, he was on top, not because of some meaningless second gender, but because of his wit and drive.
In the periphery of Draco’s blurring vision he could make out two very large, hairy bare feet step into view beside him.
Severus could only tell her so much without compromising her position, the Dark Lord regularly would slip into her mind during meetings, turning over any memory and unchecked thought, prowling for evidence.
Harry whirled around to him as if he could sense it, slowly holstering his wand back into his costume’s belt.
The ground could come away from beneath Draco’s feet in that moment and it still wouldn’t have been as sudden and gut-wrenching as the feeling of being told his one freedom was going to be taken away from him. So much for the promise from the old man that he would be given the tools and assistance to handle this himself.
Dumbledore gave a single nod to the explanation, then summoned his pipe from a shelf tucked away on the second level of the study. Once it was packed then magically lit, the Headmaster went into exhausted retelling of recent events from his perspective.
“I‘d gone outside to think. I wanted to know how I’d done... y’know. What I did. What’s happening to me?” He was twisting the itchy blankets in his hands.
“Are you… studying here? Why wouldn’t you just go to the library?” Draco didn’t want to kneel down in case his knees came into contact with any droppings, his robes cost his parents at least 500 Galleons a pop.
He sucked in a sharp breath when it parted the skin slightly, pushing the plump lips apart… Fireworks exploded in his head and he gargled out a ridiculously loud cry into the cemetery silence. He felt his torso and hips lunge downwards, his body engaging in its own desires, greedily attempting to swallow the large fist sized lump.
Draco decided to stick his head into the Great Hall to scan the Ravenclaw table. He wasn’t surprised to see she wasn’t there. It did, however, give him new enthusiasm to find her. For a moment Draco considered doing something he wasn’t quite ready to do - at the end of the hall he could make out Potter’s mop of black curls. The map could be helpful, but Draco didn’t believe the boy was going to be overly thrilled with helping him find her again this time.
Draco remembered the vial Luna had given him, the small corked glass tube was hidden somewhere in the front of his suitcase, and he’d managed to scavenge for it.
Sirius could be heard marching up the stairs before poking his head in through the door, a slight smile on his face but he feigned innocence easily enough. “Yes?”
“Then why can’t you just fuck off?” Draco spat, spinning around and shoving him roughly at the shoulders, the force of it had the taller boy skidding back a couple of inches, nearly slipping and falling in the crowded entry hall.
Snape had used Legilimency on him to find two particular memories: the one of Draco and the Hufflepuff Alpha during Snape’s Class (which Draco very much hesitated to show until Snape had to forcibly wrench the memory from his mental hands) and his midnight flying by the lake.
It was finally the weekend. The Slytherins had been planning to try the new ‘iced coffee’ trend at Madam Puddifoot’s, it was all people in Hogsmeade were talking about according to Pansy, and - after everything that’s happened this week - Draco felt like he deserved the break.
Pansy interrupted his surveillance by appearing at his shoulder and putting a goblet of punch into his hand.
4/7/21 GUYS THANK U FOR THE COMMENTS!!! I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS LMFAO I GOT A NEW JOB WHICH HAS BEEN A LOT MORE FAST-PACED AND WITH A LOT MORE RESPONSIBILITY SO ITS BEEN HARDER TO GET BACK INTO THIS PROPERLY (THE LAST CHAPTERS R THE HARDEST BECAUSE I WANT TO TIE EVERYTHING OFF SOMEWHAT SATISFYINGLY) - CHAPTER 23 IS NOW AT THE 17K AND I STILL FEEL LIKE IT NEEDS 6K+ WORTH OF ADJUSTMENTS!!! AAAAAaaaHHHHHHHHH
that is? Fuck!” The tears had dried and he was getting angry now. “I think I understand why I have to, and why it’s important. But I need
“…I did,” Draco said, staring off into the fireplace, searching the embers for inspirations of wisdom and patience.
“Do they? Do they really? Yours didn’t, they got together right after high school because it looked good and that’s what people were expecting them to do. Same with mine. Same with Blaise - in the beginning, at least. True love is bullshit, kitten. You know that. It’s stupid and a waste of time. Potter has money and power, what more could you ask for really?”
honestly beware, this has some heinous non-con smut and if that makes u queazy i suggest waiting for the next chapter.
, only to take a deep inhale of the bubbling liquid. The eyes that bobbed on the surface fluttered their eyelids at her. “How? Who? Oh no, I’ll be in so much
“No - fuck. You being good looking helps sure but - “ the boy was floundering. “I mean, come on! You’re an Omega, and I - “
“You might not know much about me, there’s not much you need to know. I’m here to pass on my advise, if you’ll take it.”
The two of them had been quickly healed but their clothes weren’t cleaned, they both had caking patches of blood lining their shirts collars.
What could explain what was happening without opening the door and giving away his position? As a distraction, he tried to deduce it all using the clues given by Draco’s scents and sounds.
Draco whipped around, excitedly. He inched up close to her and grabbed her by the shoulders. Finally, someone who could really understand. There was always Luna, but she just seemed to be in her own world most of the time.
you’d think five years of Quidditch and the summer holidays spent dragon riding in France would make him capable of trekking seven flights of stairs. “I - huff - need your help.”
He inched his fingers closer to it, until they felt the rubber. He knocked it over, and watched it roll before it collapsed onto the floor in front of him. He needed both hands to pick it up and shimmied on his knees back towards the bed.
Even now, while teetering on the edge of insanity brought on by his heat, Draco could only think angry thoughts.
The soreness in Draco’s crotch from the assault was gradually taken over by a new, and overwhelming tingle.
“What? When did he do that?” Sirius made sure to check the door, he strained to hear for any signs of the boy, and heard nothing. His hearing was never wrong, so he relaxed a fraction, but not much.
“Any longer, Potter, and you may stay behind to hand-pick the toenails off chopped oger's feet, I just had a new bag recently purchased,” Snape snapped, and the shaggy, tall boy wordlessly picked up the pace until he was out of sight, shutting the door in his wake.
“Snape is losing Voldemort’s trust. As far as I know Voldemort has little faith in anyone, even the Malfoy’s have lost all control of the Manor. I predict we will have to engage with wands soon. Having Draco on our side could possibly turn the tide.”
He didn’t give anyone a chance to stop him as he shoved past the crowd into the hallway, running as fast as his legs could carry him down the corridor, up and then down flights of stairs, he ran until every breath he could take burnt.
He let out a pained cry and felt the first onslaught of fresh tears tumble their way down his hot cheeks.
.” His Headmaster boomed, this was the first time Draco had truly seen the man frustrated. His pure-white hair was wilder than usual, and his usually immaculate robes were wrinkled from lack of proper spell-care. Everyone looked as if they had flinched from the volume in his voice. “No,” he said again, this time more gentle, swiping his hand once through his beard. “Everyone has to make a sacrifice for the greater good, and this is yours. Please just agree to these terms, and I will make sure you’re taken care of during the whole ordeal. Harry will be good for you.”
” Repeated the Boggart. The way it said his name sent a cold, blood-curdling shiver across Draco’s whole body.
He could already anticipate what would come out from those carved wooden drawers. He knew the spell. He knew the wand work.
Draco let go and took a couple of steps back, fortunately for Sirius’ crassness he was able to get a hold of himself.
- it came like an explosion, the magic everyone was warning him about. It erupted around him in a flurry of bright colourful lights, resembling an aggressive and ever moving Aurora Borealis. Despite his lack of wand, hands, and strength, Draco’s magic burst out of him with enough power to sound like a miniature bomb, propelling the 80 kilo Alpha across the room.
Sirius nodded, but painfully clenched his teeth behind sealed lips. No use complaining, Dumbledore was right. Omegas were too rare and too dangerous to leave to their own devises, one case of them and their fearsome power was one too many, and resorting to the Old Ways wasn’t a question, but an accepted reality of life for the Magical World. Alphas took care of Omegas, calmed their raging magic, calmed their emotional spirits, and in return they birthed powerful Wizards.
Colour. It was everywhere, bright and moving. It danced in a glowing amalgamation of shapes and sizes all around them. As if the ball of energy in Draco’s hands was a small stained-glass ball, and it contained the smallest sun in existence.
“But I know I can figure it out… They’re not giving me enough time. “ That part in the back of Draco’s mind reared its smug head, reminding him that he knew all along that everyone had been right.
Draco wasn’t prepared and sputtered, shoving the boy off of him. “Wh - No - You - You can’t do this you’ll be expelled!”
“I…Yes.” Harry had to take responsibility. For himself and for Draco, if this was to save everyone. “Anything.”
Draco wasn’t so sure if they came accurately or on an irregular schedule, since he’s only had his first.
This probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do, as Sirius was expected to keep Draco under strict supervision. That meant he was was supposed to stay in the house. If it wasn’t the problem surrounding his Omegan magic bursting like a muggle atomic bomb, it was the Death Eaters eager to kill him. But something inside Sirius was telling him that this was the best way to get through to the boy. This was what the man needed to do.
laura madley is a legit character but lucia isnt lol. i hope y'all can appreciate that i try to keep as many of jk's original chara mentions as possible
“I thought we got over this when we did this the first time.” Potter said bitterly. “It turned out fine.”
Maybe it might be time to take up Luna’s offer of advise? Or maybe he could buy one of those stinky necklaces?
No Slytherins, Draco mentally rolled his eyes. Typical. What a waste of talent, for what? Draco would never understand the unpopularity his house suffered out of the four. All his life he was told Slytherin house was home to the greatest Wizard’s of our time, and yet here they were, not welcome to join a damned school club. His father blamed the Muggles assimilating into Wizarding lives -
When he looked up for an answer, there was what Draco could only describe as a sad smile on Sirius’ face, his eyes were lowered and the lines around them from the expression made him look even older. “Never say never. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you again, cousin.”
Harry kept his mouth shut. Ron would never understand what this was, and Harry himself would never really know how to even explain it. There was just a natural fascination that bewitched him, in spite of the way the Slytherin bully had treated Harry and his loved ones for all these years. Just from the way Draco moved, with the calm and deadly precision of a tiger, had Harry go wild. The authority in his presence, even if he was the smallest in the room, could subdue anyone. It made Harry’s unwanted celebrity status feel insignificant, which kept him from flying too close into the sun.
a name in his house since he could remember, was flirting with him. Then he reminded himself that they’d already fucked once before, and he couldn’t help the familiar tight feeling wind up in his belly.
“I’m fine, leave me.” Draco said, covering his eyes with one hand and used the other to gesture in a swishing motion towards the door.
Draco parted his lips to let out a gasp of surprise - from what, exactly, Severus couldn’t tell. The closeness? The oath? Perhaps both.
He needed somewhere to breathe. He was sick of listening to his House pretend not to gossip about him - he knew they couldn’t help it, if this nightmare weren’t happening to him he would’ve talked till the cows came home. He was panting after a session of riding on his broom. It wasn’t necessarily hard to sneak out if you paid attention to Filch’s schedule. He wasn’t worried about getting caught anyway, he didn’t care, there was just too much pent up energy he couldn’t shake off, it made it difficult to sleep, and flying always seemed to help. He looked up at the starry sky he’d just descended down from, despite the realism of the Great Hall’s enchanted ceiling, it never could perfectly capture the sense of awe one felt just staring into the vast wonders of the truly unknown.
