Harry partially wishes he did, then. "No. Hermione did. She made three of them, just as a sort of experiment. That one's Ron's, actually…" He clears his throat awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. He feels a bit guilty for stealing it, especially knowing that Ron often uses it to talk to Hermione at night, but he's sure she'll just think Ron lost it and make him another one. "I'd thought… instead of… what we do, we could just… talk from our own rooms? If we have trouble sleeping, I mean. Only if you want to, of course—"
“He's happy now,” Harry says. “He really is.”
And there he learns of another one of these newfound weaknesses of his; that no matter how much he argued with himself over it in his already restless nights, he could only momentarily evade the feeling of being an absolute wanker for hurting a boy he's indebted to more than he can repay in a lifetime. A boy he'd dreamed of loving forever.
"Took long enough, great, all you wrecks are here! As you know, this is saturday detention, which means no talking, no moving! You are to write on your parchments why you're here." Umbridge instructed.
"That can't be all?" Draco complained.
Draco really felt like he should be the one thanking Harry, but, maybe they were both equally thankful.
"I appreciate the honesty from you all." Hermione smiled.
"You can't eat until lunch." Hermione reminded.
"That's it? Really?" Draco scoffed.
"You really make me happy Draco..also, this piece of hair is out of place." Harry noticed.
"It'll make you happy..I do things to make you happy, remember?" Harry convinced.
"Well qt could be an acronym for "Quidditch Team," so you could still use it." Planter P smiled.
"Seriously? The fight barely begun, why'd you drag me away?" Pansy complained, slouching at the table.
"You runts!!" Umbridge entered the auditorium.
"Oh how I hope no one bothers you at Diagon Alley, you're too pure for that." Draco hopes.
"Huh?" qt questioned.
"I do..I'm queer." Luna revealed.
Draco snorted, clearly Ron wasn't familiar with a broom.
"No. That I was bisexual, I think I am." Harry admitted.
"I wanted a party." Draco explained.
"The beds at your manor are definitely bigger in terms of size, but these beds are much more comfortable." Harry thought.
"Finally, now I can actually start playing with you! Are you as good as me?" Draco wondered.
"I'm assuming you went to Hogwarts then?" Pansy connected.
"Then you shouldn't have a problem going out to lunch!" Pansy said.
"Oh, Draco!" Harry quickly got off the chair as soon as he spotted the blonde.
"Ron and my mom have been saying how you aren't doing well.." Harry started.
"Draco Malfoy!" McGonagall pulled him away.
Harry made it to the destined area, but his breathing soon picks up when he doesn't see Hermione anywhere in sight. Harry was beginning to think he should wander around the mass of people until he found her again, but when Harry Styles appeared upon stage, his plan was quickly subdued.
"I will, I'm sure he'll love it." Luna nodded.
"He'll miss you." Harry claimed.
"Ow." Harry grimaced, placing his hands on the ground to stand up, which was definitely a mistake once two big shoes stomped on them.
Draco entered the ice cream shop with Harry, there wasn't too many people inside.
Draco stared at qt, to whom he couldn't actually see the face of..but he stared at him for a while.
"Oh no, you're bleeding." He observed.
"I'm sorry?" Umbridge grimaced.
"I'm assuming that's your way of saying thanks, if so, you're welcome." Hermione said.
"Oh, are you seeing someone Harry?" Pansy smirked.
Truly yours, your biggest fan,
"I wish you didn't get your stupid robot-" Theodore began.
"Yeah, I'm positive." Harry pulled away with a shaky breath.
"It looks lovely on you." Hermione complimented.
"I'm not being loud." Draco defended.
"No he's not!" Draco disagreed.
"I don't mind..can I sit on what appears to be your bed?" Draco asked.
"Dray's just playing around! He loves when I call him that!" Pansy insisted.
"It's ok..you're here now." Harry smiled.
"Y-yeah, her n-names Hermione." Harry nodded.
"Well I won last time, so yes, let's settle this on a bet!" Hermione declared.
Harry wanted to die when he saw that his inbox was still empty, how long would it take for an email back? Perhaps Sky read it but didn't know how to reply..Harry felt dumb for having to check his email for a person who might not even reply.
"Hey, who said you could lay in my bed?" Draco retorted.
"Excuse me Professor Snape?" Hermione raised her hand.
"Yes, that is what I said." Draco nodded.
"Ouch my elbow." Harry muttered.
"They aren't common, but it's nothing too unordinary..I'm Ernie Macmillan." Ernie introduced.
"Quit laughing Potter, and you Granger! Stay to your seat, no touching your boyfriend!" Umbridge ordered.
"It was." Luna smiled.
3:30 pm
"Malfoy, we were in the middle of a debate-" Pansy intervened.
"Ah, you know Luna!" Pansy noted.
"Even if I'm a robot?" Harry itched closer to him.
"No, I told them it was private, and that you didn't want me to tell anyone..they didn't budge too much thankfully." Harry smiled.
"How come you don't have anything, Draco?" Hermione noticed.
"Maybe if I s-sneak o-out you c-can p-pick me up-"
"Do you ever shut up?" Harry asked.
"Pleasure. Is your robot allowed to be sorted?" Hermione wondered.
I had a aunt who killed herself over a bloke who didn't want her.
"Oh, happy birthday then." Daphne wished.
"Yeah, sure..well, have a good sleep." Pot wished.
Except it wasn't successful as he hit his elbow against the window.
"Hm, alright..I bet they'll say yes." Pansy decided.
"I bet Pansy will be right." Harry enters.
"Harry are you seeing this?" Draco whispered to his robot.
"Come on Draco, let's go see your dorm." Harry suggested, grabbing one of Draco's fists.
"Harry's my robot, he could've fallen into the water and if that leads to carrying, so be it..besides, there's no way in hell I'm letting anyone else touch him." Draco defended.
Draco: Age 8
"You're welcome, you should be careful..I'm Draconis." He introduced.
"Excuse me!? Open this door right now, or I'll give you the pencil Potter!" Umbridge threatened.
"No, don't be silly..it was just a quick conversation." Harry flushed slightly.
"Dolores! I was informed a student has been harassed in your care, from the looks of it, they just may be right." McGonagall examined.
"You were?" Draco blinked.
"That doesn't matter, I'm happy to be spending my 11th birthday with you." Harry smiled again.
"I see." Harry understood.
Harry groans, walking over to the closed door. He pulls the handle, struggling to get it open.
"Harry, you don't have to follow her." Hermione whispered.
You gotta write me, back! I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose,
Hermione, Harry's best friend, well, Harry had more than 1 best friend..however, Hermione buying the tickets for them, might've helped her claim the "ultimate best friend" title.
Harry looked around the field, quickly noticing that Ron Weasley was being charged at by some bloke on the other team..this set off alarms, alarms forcing him to run over as fast as he could.
"Thomas and Weasley? Why're they fighting, aren't they friends?" Draco thought.
"I'm sorry." Draco apologized.
"Don't worry, I'm here with my best mate! It's his first time as well, but he got a bit held back in the crowd." She shrugged.
Thank you for reading the story, I appreciate every kudo and hit :)
"What makes you say that?" Draco wondered.
"My gift's a doll?" Draco blinked.
Draco got up on his feet, debating whether to tell Pansy he was leaving or if he should just ditch them all together.
"I asked if anyone had an apple, not to eat." Draco defined.
"Was it t-that obvious?" Harry sighs.
It'll be over your mother, Lily.
"She can't right now." Draco smiled.
"At least tell Umbridge or McGonagall that someone's hurting you.." Ginny suggested.
"Don't disrespect me, Draco..you'll do as told." Lucius sneered.
"Great!" Draco smiled.
"He's a bit pathetic." Ron shrugged.
He wondered if qt was thinking about him..cause lately he was all Draco could think about.
"Anyways, I see Harry's gotten a new outfit put together, is there an occasion?" Narcissa noticed.
Draco remembered Harry's motivating words when he first got sorted, and for the most part he believed them..although, the result was unlucky as he originally expected.
"Technically I'm the one who lied, you don't have a girlfriend." Draco said.
"Draco called me Harry." Harry gaped.
"Lucky for you, I have a green apple to offer." Hermione smiled, grabbing an apple out of her bag and gesturing it to Draco.
"I d-don't, I don't know." Harry sighed.
"Is that so? Who do you like then? I see you staring at Lavender a lot.." Draco noticed.
"Yes, do try to keep up you two." Draco huffed.
"I don't know, I was waiting for you and ended up falling asleep..did you get in trouble?" Harry wondered.
"Sitting next to your girlfriend, Potter." Draco Malfoy entered, taking Hermione's seat.
"Theo's still in the closet to his parents, he wants to wait, and if it means fake dating you than that's what'll happen..unless you aren't onboard." Draco explained.
"A robot?" Neville's eyes widen.
"Draco? Are you sad?" Luna asked.
"He's an old friend of father's. Follow me, alright?" Draco enters with Harry.
"How about we spend the last few hours of detention roaming the halls? I think we suffered this library for long enough..Potter, the choice is yours?" Draco smiled.
"A Weasley, makes sense...Draco Malfoy." Draco returned.
"I'm just saying, sometimes you need to be curious..I didn't even know they were shagging, maybe Pansy should be more investigative! Or whatever you wanna call it." Harry backed up.
Dear Mister writer, "I'm too good to call or write my fans!"
"It made me mad, when he kissed you." Harry admitted.
"I don't." Harry said.
"Enough emailing your online boyfriend, he can wait a few hours!" Pansy argued.
"Who said I was worried? Cause I'm not." Draco scoffed.
"Thank you." Harry smiled.
"Yeah, I know..you don't need to ask someone you don't like..Is there anything else bothering you?" Harry wondered.
It definitely wasn't.
"We shouldn't be eavesdropping any longer, we've heard enough." Hermione suggested.
"A ridiculous one by all counts..what's the matter Malfoy?" Hermione shifted.
"Being calm tends to spread, the more calm I appear, the more likely it is you'll be." Luna explained.
"Where is this robot of yours then??" Theodore looked around his room.
"Draco? You seem unsettled." Luna spoke.
"Ron isn't stupid." Luna disagreed.
"It isn't painful." Luna reassured.
Harry follows Umbridge, trying to block his friends complaints.
Draco couldn't protest because they were already gone within a second.
The way Sky talked about his end, was something Harry felt he could relate to.
"Unlikely." Draco doubted.
Harry: Age 11
"I reckon he was thinking about his-" Pansy began.
"With all due respect, my mother is dead." Harry said.
"Up." Draco succeeds, broom in hand.
See? Harry was just so nice..he complimented Draco a ton, and it didn't annoy him like it did with Pansy.
(See the end of the chapter for
"But we aren't going to school." Harry reminded.
"What if I wanna talk to Granger?" Draco wondered.
"I'm not moving." Draco denied.
"I think it will." Harry agreed.
"Have a look." Lucius insisted as he opened the door.
"Yes, that is what I said." Draco nodded.
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too.
"Address him by Draco only!" Harry demanded.
Draco apparated home, fighting the urge to cry..qt was so happy to receive Draco's green lily..of course, Draco didn't know if qt returned all of his feelings. But if he did, Draco simply forgot about him to cuddle Harry Potter of all people??
"Ask Cho then." Ron said.
"Hello." One of the bloke's greeted.
"Thank you." Draco waved, apparating back home.
"Since June." Draco replied.
"Up!" Ron says for the fifth time, groaning as the broom smacks him in the face.
"No, I'm referring to what happened with you and father.." Draco meant.
"Some fight going on." Draco said, making Harry snap his head up.
"They're so uncomfortable, what a ridiculous email!" Draco huffed.
"Don't call my robot a moron, Smith." Draco warned.
"How fascinating." Hermione suddenly commented.
Warnings: Humiliation and slight body-shaming
"To be clear, Theodore Nott started everything before I even got involved..Harry heard him insult Neville, and being the nice robot he is, decided to defend his friend. It turned into quite the argument. Theodore wouldn't stop taunting, and made very harsh comments about Harry. He's my robot, and I suppose that lead to me pushing Theodore.." Draco explained.
"I mean, I don't really wanna go, but I like it the best when I spend my time with you." Draco shared.
Draco placed a kiss on Harry's elbow, "So do I."
"We went to the same school- where did you guys go?" Harry asked.
"Uh..yeah?" Draco flushed, shocked by the use of his name.
"Why is it that she seems to only yell at you?" Hermione observed.
Draco simply preferred Harry anyways, maybe that was why.
"Then just say it here." Dean shrugged.
"I'm sure you've liked someone at one point though." Ginny smiled.
"Wasn't he a dentist? Or did he get fired?" Draco wondered.
"I think they already look beautiful." Harry insisted.
Harry couldn't think properly. He was pacing around his room, not knowing what to do with this knew information.
"Fine, then I'll have to do it for you." Draco says as he squirts a few pumps of lotion on his palm.
"Is that a phobia?" Draco asked.
"Nice? I think you're being more civil than-" Ronald disagreed.
"Hey, what do I address you by?" Draco intervened.
"Hey, shut it Weasel! You're the one who isn't being nice!" Pansy accused.
"Did you steal Snape's drugs??" Draco wondered.
"Good." qt says.
"I've heard enough of this!" Draco storms to Umbridge's closed door.
"As in relationship wise? Oh, uh..I only dated girls, but funny that I'm honestly more attracted to men. Well, it's not actually funny, but yeah. Uh, what about you two?" Harry struggled.
Harry was so overwhelmed, and it just caught up to him that he was in a car accident.
"It's gonna be so fun! Oh shit..we are totally late for class!" Harry realized.
"Mhm, sure." Draco chuckled.
But Harry knew who it was, he knew it was Draco..even if he wasn't totally aware of his surroundings.
"How about we go together then?" Harry asked.
"Draco?" Harry approached.
"You can't tell me what to do..bloody moron." Theodore huffed.
Draco: Age 14
"I'll have you know that being a janitor comes with a lot of privilege..I see everything, what your lockers store, I know a lot about you all." Janitor Granger claimed.
"It can easily be a side job!" Ronald defended.
"No, qt, sounds like your saying cutie." Planter P explains.
"I'm sorry Harry, but we can't go to the Christmas Ball like I promised..my parents aren't letting us come back to the manor." Draco revealed.
"Really?" Harry wondered.
"It is?? Ok qt, what do you refer to me as?" Draco wondered.
"No, but I will be soon." Harry determined.
"You always t-treated me d-differently than the others..like I meant something bigger to you, or that you liked me a little bit..but when I saw Nott kissing you, I realized I'd been wrong.." Harry frowned.
"He is a robot!" Draco repeated.
Draco definitely wasn't gonna email that planter p again..at least that was his original plan.
"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well it's not very good is it..I've only tried a few simple spells for practice, and they've all worked for me." She gloated.
"I've told you thousands of times to study with me, but never once have you agreed!" Hermione huffed.
"Maybe that's why mother called detention a club.." Draco flushed.
"Y-yeah, that settles it, I do too." Draco agreed.
"You'll need to fix that injury up." Hooch intervened.
"Harry, you're a robot correct?" Draco turned.
Draco was thankful that the ginger interrupted their conversation, he didn't need to hear Hermione's unwanted explanation.
My girlfriend's jealous because I talk about you 24/7.
"Her outfit might be worse than us." Draco insulted.
"I can tell, it's in your eyes." Luna explained.
"Could've been worse." Pansy shrugged.
"You're a very cool wizard..oh look! It's Ron up there!" Harry pointed.
"I argue with everyone." Draco claimed.
"Yes." Draco nodded.
"Thanks..I l-love you."
Harry was beaming with adrenaline, the bleachers were extra packed for today's game. Draco seemed to be a bit more nervous than usual, but maybe it was his way of dealing with the excitement.
"Yes, but only a small amount." Lucius nodded.
Draco stomped to the basement, recklessly searching for a parchment and pencil. Draco had just argued with his pregnant girlfriend Astoria, and was now about to write famous writer Harry Potter.
"She will if you keep talking." Ginny insisted.
"I said asking, not investigating!" Hermione rebounds.
"This one's tricky..ravenclaw is not the house."
"Dolores, this pencil is sharp as a needle point! Care to explain why Mister Potter has it?" McGonagall observed.
"I meant what I said, if that's what you're worried about.." Harry reassured.
A Gryffindor rose his hand.
"Who said I was tired?" Pansy objected.
"I accidentally gave him Professor Snape's drugs! I must've mixed up his for my headache one!" Hermione realized.
"You're a jock, how low can your confidence get?" Draco laughs.
"Well we have our phones if you need to use them." Draco offered.
"Teach your robot manners, he's being disrespectful!" Pansy accused.
"Inappropriate state of mind? Don't all high schoolers think about that stuff?" Draco thought.
"Too bad, I already heard. Really, Harry? Stalking Malfoy, again??" Pansy appeared next to them.
"Fine..go ahead to class, I'll be there after I hit the loo." Draco insisted, walking into the near boy's room.
"Well, I like her..and since we're kinda faking a relationship soon, you might be able to see her more..but even if we don't do that, you could still hangout with us." Harry offered.
Grade: Last Year of High School
"Mister Malfoy! Do I need to repeat myself?? I said no talking." Umbridge reminded.
Harry: Age 17
"He does seem rather shallow..do not worry, I am like that as well." Luna spoke up.
Dear Potter, you still haven't called or wrote, I hope you get the chance.
"What??" Draco asked.
"Yes, anything." Harry nodded.
"Hey, there's Ron!" Harry pointed at the ginger who sat in front of him.
"..you know my jealousy towards Lavender? It's not necessarily due to her connections with others, it's a lot of things..well for one, I fancy her boyfriend, your brother, Ron..but that's not the situation. She and her friends were saying I wasn't smart, but instead utterly annoying. When she saw the B I received for my Chemistry test, she said I should shoot myself for having such a disappointing grade..the school found a firearm in my locker. That's why I'm here." Hermione explained.
"The door shutting in her face constantly is hilarious." Draco laughs.
"You still remain with plenty of Slytherin traits, but your loyalty sticks out the most.."
Remember when we met in London? You said if I wrote you, you'd write back.
"Not to pry, but I've seen plenty of interactions between the two of you..and it really has me wondering.." Hermione hummed.
"What else does he do for you?" Ron wondered.
"Where's the guy that hit me the stick?" Harry asked.
"Well let's Floo there shall we!" Narcissa says.
"That's why I said bet, stupid." Draco insulted.
"I suppose." Draco shrugged.
"Uh, o-ok..bye I guess." Harry stammered.
"C-an we, can we kiss?" Harry stuttered.
"Oh, I'm Hermione Granger!" Hermione sat beside him.
"qt?" Draco itched to the figure.
"I shall read it to you." Harry picked up his book.
"Hell, you good mate?" Ron furrowed his eyebrows.
"Right." Lucius huffed.
"You're so strong, Draco..I am really impressed by you." Harry praised.
"How come you always take her judgement over mine?? I have the better record after all." Hermione thought.
Therefore, Draco hesitantly went over to Harry's bed. Feeling a little bad that he had his eyes shut too..
"You shouldn't call people fat." Harry ridiculed.
"I was embarrassed after the match, everyone said it was small..so that clearly boosted my confidence." Harry slumped.
"Do you wanna borrow some of my clothes, I'll allow it as it's your birthday?" Draco offered.
"Living with Draco has been absolutely boring lately, he's always on his laptop." Pansy rolled her eyes.
"Hey can I sit with you guys? The other compartments are full.." A red head approached.
"For the record, you were right from the beginning." Harry smiled.
"Ok.." Harry nodded unsurely.
After a minute, Draco seemed to notice he had received an email.
"Yes." Draco insisted.
"Good?" Draco blinked.
"Absolutely not!" Hermione ridiculed.
"This is bollocks." Harry muttered, being dragged back to the table by Hermione.
"He couldn't be more wrong, I know who you are..he doesn't know the first thing about you, he solely judged you on the fact that you're a robot." Draco knew.
Draco takes a seat behind the row of Gryffindors, insisting Harry to do the same.
Draco recently was finishing up work on his bakery, and when not doing so, he took the time to email qt. Although, he was a bit excited to see Luna again. He had been extremely grateful ever since she helped deliver his green lily.
"Where will we sit?" Harry wonders.
"Definitely!" Draco nodded.
Everyone's gaze falls to Harry, who was now looking on the verge of tears.
"I thought Granger was the brains here?" Draco said.
Draco's kissed many guys before, but none of them had a bigger effect than this very one.
"Are you ok?" He asked.
Harry clicks send, running a hand through his messy hair. Picking a name based off your dad's lacrosse stick might be random, but it did the job.
"Everyone's jealous, isn't that normal behavior?" Draco thought.
"We need to call someone, she won't listen to any of us!" Hermione began to think.
"Hm..I had a liking towards Zabini, but I only thought he looked fuckable." Draco chuckled.
"Yeah, it's detention." Draco stated the obvious.
"I can tell, you stand up for him more than anyone else." Luna noted.
"We can do a play." Luna smiled.
"You don't even address them by their real names, how do you expect them to agree?" Hermione wondered.
"I do not!" Harry oblivedged.
"I admire a clean room, ask if you wanna use something." Draco said as he entered his room.
"You only talk to Abbott..but I guess while we're at it, how did you know you were queer?" Draco asked.
Draco shared one final look with his mother before beginning to board the train, he knew deep down that he'd miss her.
"Are you ok?" Harry asked, who could clearly sense his irritable mood.
Draco saw the frown on Harry's face, causing him to get even angrier.
"I'm actually bi myself..I told Dean, and that's why we broke up." Ginny related.
"I don't care who you runts date, but locking me in my office, roaming the halls during detention, and cutting Lovegood's hair so she looks like a boy? It's sinful behavior." Umbridge disapproved.
"Theodore didn't think so..he started laughing once you left, saying you're lucky to get some space away from me.." Harry pulled out of the hug with a frown.
"Hey! I could've had my dick out you wanker!" Draco scolded.
"Well, turns out they were..and of course Thomas dates Ginny, Ron finds out they cheated, he gets mad, and then they fight. That's pretty much it." Harry explained.
"Baking, I guess." Draco shrugged.
"My parents named it after a constellation in the sky..it also means Dragon." He explained.
"He is..who am I kidding, he's always sassy!" Hermione stated.
"Bill and Charlie, they don't stay at home much." Ginny added.
"What?" Harry's breath hitched.
It was later that night when Draco saw Odyssey flying up to the dormitory window.
"Mhm, his name's Harry." Draco added.
Hey everyone, this is the last chapter..I can't believe I finished this story in barely 72 hours. I guess writing during school keeps you busy lol. Warnings: Harassment, Drugs.
Sky had emailed him back!
Funny, Draco had a very similar reaction when Pansy mentioned qt..if Draco was looking at this correctly, then it seemed Harry might be seeing someone too.
"Thanks, do you still want a hug or?" Draco trailed.
"Which proves my exact point! Now, what are you doing at the moment?" Draco asked.
At some point along the ride, Harry found himself wanting a drink of water..so he made the decision to reach for his water bottle.
"Tricky? I'm Slytherin through and through." Draco claimed.
"Yes?" Harry answered confused.
What will his friends say? They always talked about being in Slytherin together..more importantly, what would his father think??
Harry was sleeping in the egg-like chair.
Harry knew Draco, he knew when Draco was upset, and right now was one of those moments. Harry noticed that Draco always seemed to avoid the topic of when it came to the school dance. He didn't wanna annoy his friend and pry about it, but when something's up with Draco, Harry wants to know.
"Let's do it!" Harry decided, the others cheering with agreement.
"I'm a wreck t-too..you know I don't cry, but lately all my tears have been about you..missing you."
"Anybody as fat as him would've fallen like that." Theodore insulted.
"And I know there's a bigger reason why..I'm not trying to annoy you..I just wanna know if something's wrong." Harry frowned. Draco moved to sit in front of Harry, looking a bit distraught.
"No! Don't you understand!? If Umbridge finds out I told you 4 or any other teacher, she'll give me the pencil! Then she'll somehow convince my father that I'm a liar!" Harry revealed.
"Yeah." Harry laughs in agreement.
"Why?" Harry wondered.
"It'll make you happy." Harry reassured, climbing into Draco's bed with a book in his hand.
Draco kept his eyes set on the cauldron, the boil looking seemingly content..that was until the boil started overflowing.
"Oh finally! I made it to the right dorm!" Neville bursted through the doors.
"I would but I'm too busy watching Snape giving detentions, he looks so mad." Pansy laughs.
"Oh..I'm sorry that we got caught during your birthday party Dray.." Pansy apologized.
"What's it to you with all these questions? But no, I'm an only child, and I doubt father would ever consider adopting..whether he's a robot or not." Draco crossed his arms.
"Yeah, on daily secrets!" Parvati said.
"Ask that when it's your turn." Draco glared.
"Right, forgot he was with you..uh hello." Theodore waved awkwardly.
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but was soon gaping when he spotted Hermione.
"Us? You came with a friend?" Draco caught.
"Quit gaping like a fish..I've assembled a personal robot for you, addressed by the name Harry." Lucius explained.
"I apologize for arguing, I respect you for making amends with me." Draco appreciated.
Harry threw a sharp glare at Ronald, clearly angry with his friend.
"It'll be fine, she'll see the messages." Draco reassured.
"I'd say so..Ron has been distant ever since he got with Lavender." Ginny noticed.
Ginny sat down, being the first of 5 to arrive.
"He's not my boyfriend." Draco denied.
"It's ridiculous.." Harry insisted.
"It feels good, being this close to you." Harry admitted, his voice strained with awe.
"Perfect..I have my book." Draco says.
Draco didn't even notice her presence, but the realization of the situation started to settle in.
Harry looked through his email as he trotted down the hall, but not for long when his phone got snatched.
Draco knew this made him look like such a git..and he hated himself for it. He's lucky that he woken an hour prior to the time he'd visit qt, he would feel 10x worse if he somehow missed it.
"It is, that's why I asked." Draco reassured.
"What for?" Draco asked.
Draco would never let someone like Theodore or Pansy read to him..Theodore would be laughing the whole time, and Pansy would exaggerate everything. Blaise would make an attempt to act serious, but would no doubt fail at it. Crabbe and Goyle could care less about a bedtime story, but Draco was positive that they both didn't know how to read. Daphne isn't one to judge, but she'd be the person that would fall asleep while reading
"There's no need to be jealous of her, she is nowhere as smart and interesting as you." Luna spoke up.
"He's allowed to eat one meal per day..if he digest's too much he'll get really unwell." Draco explained.
"Harry? Do you mind grabbing the ingredients for me?" Draco asks.
"Who the hell would email me? I haven't started by baking company yet?? Draco blinked.
The blonde boy returned a brief smile as he scooted beside him.
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm gonna be a father.
"Neither will I." Harry sincered.
"Hello." Draco greeted.
"And knocked Harry over! Honestly, do people watch where they're going?" Hermione helped Harry off the floor. Harry gave her a quick thanks as he brushed his knees, only to be knocked over again.
"It's about Pansy, kind of..I'm just really sick of everyone telling me to ask her. You know I don't fancy her..and it's getting under my skin." Draco explained.
"It's a bit big on me, you'd look way better in it." Harry thought.
"So you wouldn't like me better if I was a wizard like you?" Harry wondered.
"Uh, what about you, Draco?" Harry questioned.
"Mate, you two gotta ask someone..blimey, I even have a date." Ron chuckled.
"I don't think he likes me." Harry muttered.
After they talked a bit more, Draco found Harry reading to him in his bed.
"I know a lot of things, Potter." Draco replied.
"Draco just likes the band better because it's more boys to look at." Pansy chuckled.
"The spells I casted beforehand will allow him to eat one meal per day...too much of it could cause immediate damage." Lucius warned.

"The auditorium, there's loads of seats and space!" Ginny thought.
And soon Draco fell asleep, the same way he has been since the day he turned 11.
"Chang left you for a college footie boy, damn, she has game." Draco smirked.
"Yes..Lucius gave you to me. I'm his personal robot that will do anything to make him happy." Harry declared.
1:00 pm
"No, no, no." Harry pants shakily.
"Draco?" Harry said.
"I will calm us down, please be careful." Luna smiled.
"I find that to be none of your business, so shove off will you?" Harry glared.
"Lower your voice." Luna said.
"I've known him way longer than you, of course I know he's good." Theodore rolled his eyes.
"I never declared that it was innocent in any way!" Hermione crossed her arms.
Hermione nudged Harry, insisting to him that he should ask Draco for his number.
"They're talking with the other coach." Ron said.
"GRYFFINDOR"
"I bet you have a crush on Longbottom." Draco assumed.
"No, unless you want more contact?" Draco smirked.
"That means a lot to me, thanks Ginny." Harry smiled.
"...harry."
"You get the honor of having first-name basis, Hermione." Draco accepted the fruit.
Draco wonders what potions would've been like if he was a Slytherin..
"No, unless Potter here has a kink for that-" Draco began
"He's a good looking red-head, wouldn't you two be celebrating? If Weaslette stalked me, oh I'd be screaming." Pansy shared.
"How do you manage to be so calm?" Draco wondered.
Draco tuned their conversations out, leaving himself to organize his things.
"You must address him by Draco." Harry ordered.
"Don't you have a million brothers, wouldn't you be used to talking?" Draco assumed.
"No!" Draco shook his head frantically.
"Anyone with proper sight should've noticed that..what should I do to fix this current problem?" Severus questioned.
Draco's eyes fluttered open, quickly realizing that he was curled up to Harry.
"I r-really don't like Nott..s-sure he's a g-good looking bloke..but he isn't you." Draco admitted.
"You misunderstood-" Umbridge began.
"I'm intrigued." Ginny nodded.
"I would've been a git if I just stood there..it was my decision." Harry reassured.
"What?" Hermione frowned.
Draco knew he had some traveling to do outside of the UK..
"How does that help?" Ginny rolled her eyes.
McGonagall opened Umbridge's door, her gaze falling to Harry, who was holding a sharp pencil above his palm.
"I will not be sharing anything of that information..it's nobody's business but mine." Hermione stated.
"Right, sorry about that." Harry apologized.
Oh no.
"I knew they shagged!" Pansy insisted.
"Still the same." Draco muttered.
"Be ready in 30 minutes! We're apparating!" Pansy ordered.
"Harry Potter! You know I'm not a fan of using phones in the hall!" Lockhart held his phone.
"No! I told Draco to tackle Theodore!" Harry lied.
"I don't want Ron to hear this.." Ginny explained.
"Normal boyfriend stuff..uh shoot, have you dated anyone before?" Draco wondered.
"Ah, you must be the talk of the school..Draco Malfoy's robot." Severus drawled.
"I know, but he'll be furious.." Draco reminded.
Harry: Age 8
"Of course they don't, they're not picture books-" Hermione defined.
Once Ron visited an awake Harry, it was mentioned that Draco wasn't doing well..hell, even Harry's own mother said Draco wasn't doing well.
12:00 pm
And because Harry was his robot, Draco assured him that he'd be able to go. At the time he didn't think much of it, but now that he and Harry were so close, letting him down was the last thing he wanted to do.
"Do I really have to go?" Draco complained.
"I do not approve of violence, but I'm not Head of Hufflepuff for no reason..It's clear to me that you were only trying to protect Harry. I didn't see you as a Hufflepuff right away, but the hat of course is never wrong. Seeing students in my house protecting one another is exactly what I cherish..5 points will be taken. I advise you to study and keep your distance from others for the night." Sprout decided.
"Are you ok?" Pansy asked Harry.
"Shut up." Harry muttered.
"Follow me then, Potter." Draco guided. Harry hesitantly followed, very confused as to what Draco could possibly want..they hardly talked on a regular basis, so there had to be some sort of catch.
"My mother."
Malfoy's leg was shifting impatiently now. Harry was somewhat afraid he might end up reverting to his old self if they keep him waiting any longer.
"All right," he ended up saying, looking only at Emelie, with a slight smile.
"You wouldn't know for sure."
Warning: this chapter deals a bit with jealousy and a depressive+dissociative-like response
Malfoy hummed, his temple close to the side of his hair. His mouth was near his jaw. Harry could smell his fresh toothpaste. "It's just sex, you know. It doesn't have to mean anything."
Harry swallowed hard. Draco closed his eyes, leather-gloved fingers curled into the back of Harry's hair.
He could not explain, either, why he continued to pretend he didn't notice.
"Would any of your other childhood enemies turned involuntary spouses buy you
"Why you?"
"I'm sorry," Harry said after, breathing heavy and slow, his brain feeling heavy and slow too. He swallowed hard, watching Malfoy step back, avert his head away just so. "Sorry. You had to
But Luna's words vaguely drift through his mind that night, It's
Luna hugs him too, after, and Harry sits there at breakfast with them, answers all of their questions. But mostly he finds himself quietly watching him, and the two of them, all throughout. Mostly, he finds himself noting all the little, lovely changes in him. How much more settled he's become within himself, grounded and bright and easy.
Harry and Blaise get along well enough. He does not seem to hold the same protectiveness and fears that Pansy does about their relationship. When Harry asks him why, he says, very calmly, "because I'm going to hex you if you hurt him in any way, of course."
"Did you really think I'd have let you — ?"
Harry had stopped expecting an answer, and he was just on the edge of reaching a hand out for him, blindly wanting to touch him.
Draco paused, there, going silent for another few seconds. Harry could see him, jaw shifting slightly again, close-mouthed, in that way he did sometimes when he was contemplating.
In April, Teddy's birthday came around, for which they had a celebratory party at Andromeda's.
In the journey from the stairs up to what must be Draco's old bedroom, some of the fear had begun to melt into a kind of anger as well.
* * *
"That's… that's not what I meant."
In the Fifth Chapter, it is discovered that Lucius is dead. Harry speaks for Narcissa at her trial and searches for anyone who can awaken Draco, to no avail. The chapter ends with him pondering over Draco's fate and shedding tears of sorrow and remorse at his bedside.
"Did you eat?" Draco rasped, whilst they were laid together sideways, facing each other. Their legs were tangled together.
At that, Draco pauses. A corner of his cheek lifts, a soft half-smile. "Alright," he says. "Good."
"How was your date?" Draco asked, when he noticed him there, smirked in amusement at whatever Harry must look like.
There was only that.
. She was holding her small hand out for him to shake.
In the winds is an open space for Harry to speak. Draco is there only with his presence, his solidity pressed up all against Harry, inclined into him.
me, Potter, you
* * *
He's been feeling like a liar, trying to love her, knowing he loved somebody else. He feels like he's told her the truth now.
Draco's first mandatory visit to the school's Mind-Healer's office is merely introduction, a series of personal questions building up into a whole life story that trails off at the events of the past year, at the war on the very Hogwarts they sit together in.
It's quiet again, for a moment, but for their breathing, but for the music that echoes on still outside this room — made low in quality by a sound-amplifying spell. Something with a much slower piano melody now, playing up into the quiet of the room.
Harry realised only then that there was warmth in Malfoy's body, having seeped back somewhere in the middle of all that. When he could finally bring himself to look at him, heart pulsing wildly between his collarbones
"Dosa," Harry says. "South Indian."
But whatever expression Harry has on his face, undoubtedly a reflection of the whirlwind of his guilt and shame, seems to smoothen some of the hardness of Draco's face. His lips press together again, those pin-dot again that Harry's been noticing too often these past few months. He breathes a sigh, close-mouthed through his nose, glancing away in a private sort of gesture. Almost as if caving to something within himself.
"Can I ask you something?"
Potter spins him under his arm, gently pulls him back into the circle of their dance, the two of them smiling, just two silhouettes in the dark. Somewhere underneath it all, Draco dreams, reliving, a hand closing over his in the daylight of a kitchen, a hand warm and gentle at the middle of his back, just like this, the two of them drawing him into the slow spin of a dance, just like this, and the sound of a wireless singing on, under the echo of laughter.
The answer is obvious enough. "He didn't want to go to Azkaban."
Draco puts his hand on her forehead to check her temperature. Narcissa shakes her head, taking his hand and kissing the back of it, pressing it against her cheek.
But Harry still loves him, and he wants him back so much it leaves him sick and aching most days.
he is when
"They hurt her, bad, with the Cruciatus Curse on repeat. Your aunt. Your father." Draco's chest tightens, his breaths high in his chest, trying to hold it steady. He knows his father had done terrible things, but to know he'd hurt a girl only as old as himself, just as Rowle and Greyback had
"So, for Merlin's sake, could you at least try to keep your damned wits about you this time? Just for one night?"
Harry keeps the coat around him all the way until they return to their dorms at night, the faint scent of Draco's cologne at the collar of his coat constant in the back of his senses. It follows him all throughout their journey to Honeydukes, then the pub for a couple of drinks, and then back to Hogwarts, the Eighth Year commons.
Draco was an awfully restless person who didn't like staying still, and so after a few days, he tired of being in bed so often and began to grow exasperated by Harry's insistence on rest, though he did soften by his clear anxiety.
"No, for Merlin's—" Harry said, looking around him quickly. Everybody seemed bemused. He closed his eyes. "No. Whatever. I'm going."
"Shut up."
There, Harry follows the cobblestone path until he's led to the back of a beige overcoat, dark trousers, the collar of a black rollneck. His white-blond hair at the nape of his neck. He is stood by some bushes, was examining them with a hand in his pocket. But his fingers have stilled at the sound of Harry's footsteps.
Harry came to a stop in front of Narcissa, who was turning towards him, saying, "Harry." They were both tearing their eyes away, looking at her.
"Keep your hands off of me," Draco hissed through clenched teeth, eyes red-rimmed. "I don't need anything from you."
Harry wasn't even afraid of dying from it so much as he was of living with it.
"Do you remember Third Year here?" Harry asks, glancing over at Draco. His gloved hands are shoved into his pockets. "When those snowballs had started coming at you out of nowhere?"
* * *
"Right," Harry said.
Harry was watching him from over the rim of his mug, getting a bit distracted from his own thoughts by the way he looked. The daylight was shrouding the kitchen bright. Malfoy was regarding his parchment, contemplative, elbows atop the table, his coffee half-drunk next to them. The tip of his quill was dipping at the centre of his bottom lip, a hint of teeth at the top. His attention kept focusing itself on that.
"Tell me if you can. Please."
"I'm sure you're aware of the legislation recently passed?" Narcissa said, a hollow smile on her lips. "That all service providers now reserve the right to refuse service to former Death-Eaters? Now whether that is fair or not is an argument for another day
"Yes?" Draco says, when he sees him. Matthew perks a little.
"Narcissus flowers."
Draco tried to show him how, without a wand, but it took him several tries to focus his magic and really manage to cast it. He seemed bewildered by this.
Harry's face breaks into a grin. "Yep. That was me. Under my Invisibility cloak, throwing snowballs at you."
He couldn't see his face, his hair hanging in the way of his profile. He was kneeling on the ground, a little hunched over with his hands on his knees. It was only a second, two, and his feet were again just on the edge of moving further towards him, getting to him, thinking of touching his shoulders, his face, making sure he was okay again—
, he said. He'd almost forgotten the ring he bought for Draco on their coffee table until Olivia suddenly remembered, went inside and got it for him.
"Mister Potter," Scorpius says as he comes to sit next to him at lunch break. "Why's you... why's your hair so long?"
Harry sincerely appreciates her efforts, but he has already decided, from then on, to just take all his meals straight from the kitchens.
Oh, fuck no.
be in a relationship together at the same time. But surely it's a bit natural to feel a little out of place, sticking around with a couple. They bicker like an old married one, too, which admittedly is nothing new, but it can be head-ache inducing if it seems to be tenfold more intense after them getting together.
"After your mother."
He's entirely breathless and sweaty, his heart pounding terribly, by the time he's turning into the crack of an Apparition and landing where the anti-Apparition wards started, by the time he's running the rest of the way to the Hogsmeade station. Far in the distance, the train is a mere pin-point. He's breathing heavy and hard, folded at the abdomen with heaves for air, a hand on a pillar. Draco is in that train, and he is leaving Harry behind, going Merlin knows where, all without even a word to him.
Harry was tracing his fingers very lightly around the shape of Draco's nose, his mouth, his eyes. Stroking his thumb over his brow.
* * *
Hermione shared a glance with Ron from the rather low chair. She worked her lower lip, that silent communication thing that they did sometimes. She looked back at him. "He's...not awake yet," she said, a little slowly. "We don't, um… they won't tell us much. They said you're the only one who can know."
Draco hums, feigning contemplation. "Perhaps that depends on whether my partner isn't a clumsy oaf."
Harry couldn't say anything to that. Draco turned, walking up the stairs.
He hardly seemed to be mentally present in classes, his gaze somewhere far away deep in his own mind, always hazy and lost. Always so lost.
he tells himself, and it's enough of a comfort and acquiescence. "Yes. Alright."
Harry was still smiling after they were all gone out of the room, leaving him with a kiss on the head, a hug, a hand on his arm or shoulder. His head dropped back gently to his pillow, warm, eased just so with a softer feeling of
"Do tell, Malfoy. What's the special occasion right now?"
"He seems rather…" Narcissa continued, paused as if in search for an appropriate word, settled on, "strange... these days."
"I want him back," Harry whispers. "I want him to come back."
Jenny raises her hand. "Is your lab a secret room?"
They also did not know that, though it showed up at around the same time, it did so at different rates for the two of them.
"You make me feel real," Harry whispered to him, the warmth of Draco's cheek on the back of his own hand, watching him press a kiss to it.
, Harry thought. "Right. But are you going to
"How in the world are we going to pay for this?!" Harry exclaimed out loud, before he could stop himself. He didn't bring many Galleons and Sickles with him. Far from this much. What was so great about the food here that one tiny custard dish would cost nearly one hundred and fifty Galleons?
"Who, I imagine, believes other students would be more likely to require protection from
"You weren't very good in my dream either," Draco says.
His gaze focused back onto Draco, who was looking at him.
Draco looks up at him. Harry doesn't really know what to say. But maybe Draco isn't really waiting for him to. He just takes Harry's face in with fingers to his jaw, kisses him sweetly, lingering.
"Only if you go too."
Draco frowned. He touched his face with his inked fingers, got more faded smudges there. Harry smiled, dropping his head a bit to hide it.
Harry's shoulders were tensed up to his neck, his anger a sickening burn in his chest. He transfigured a misplaced quill on the nightstand into another pillow and shoved it between himself and Malfoy as a barrier. It startled Malfoy, to Harry's fractional satisfaction.
letting you
"But I do now. Harry," Draco said, softly. "Because you make it so difficult not to believe it."
When he startles awake that night with a cry half-buried in his throat, he isn't alone. Harry is there right in front of his eyes flying open. It takes a second to register it's him, with his face and the green of his droopy, half-mast eyes in the starlights, but it's his voice shushing him softly and his hands all in his hair, running featherlight over his face and shoulders and down his back, the bumps of his spine. His arm is pulling him closer when Draco finally does reach calm and steady breaths, and his face is very close to his own on the pillow. The pounding of his heart is settling down—just by the sight of his face, the warmth of his hands, his breaths steady against Draco's chin. He tries to stay awake to watch Harry's eyes slip shut, watch him return to slumber first, but is too tired and falls asleep quickly after.
"Come on. I've been following the news. Just a few months ago you were saying you'd never marry somebody like him
And so, with a face stone-still, he said, "I don't think so, Malfoy."
"Somebody has to." Harry smirked. He nudged his shoulder.  "If you could have anyone you want, Malfoy. Come on. Who would it be?"
And Harry would know now what it meant, to lose even more than he already had.
The next morning, when Harry woke up, Malfoy was gone. Downstairs, Ron and Hermione were making breakfast together.
In the papers, that was what everybody seemed to expect of him — that he would go on and continue to be the saviour of the world in some form. Saying that now, he kept having the strange sense that he disappointed somebody ever since the words left him.
"Well, he's
, here he is, right between his hands and holding his fingers to Draco's face with a fragility as sweet and careful as the way he's kissing him.
He's always been a cruel and selfish boy, and that cruel and selfish boy in him wants to be chosen above all, but he's also been a person that cares about somebody else more than himself. He can be that person again.
"Thank you," Harry murmured, the movement of it on Draco's lips, smiling into it. Draco huffed a small, amused laugh, took his face and kissed him again, heads bobbing together.
" He gestured vaguely.
"What's your favourite colour?" Harry asked him at breakfast, almost mindlessly, but for that vague thought he'd had that morning somewhere in the back of his mind, somehow still stuck, it seemed. The Bond-intensified sex, and the long run after, had him feeling good, and the words came easy in the lingering rush of it.
Draco looks up at her. "Why can't you sleep?"
There were the beginnings of a slight burn at the corner of Harry's eyes, a line between his brows — something ablaze and raw and frayed at the nerves of his heart and weighing down on his voice. Draco didn't see it.
3) The candidate(s) would oblige all instructions, if any, of the curse-alterers and medimagical staff following the Alteration. If failed to do so, the resulting outcome would not be due to fault of the staff, and legal action may be taken if necessary against the responsible party.
kitchen table now, because we are bloody
"Don't tell me you're going to use some illegal means—" Harry said, and then trailed off when the thought struck him. "
"Why do you do this?"
Draco's already guessed where that one could come from, having heard later on the disgusting truth of Umbridge's detentions. He's held that hand often, brushed a thumb over it.
Pansy doesn't seem entirely convinced, and maybe after what she was there for, nothing will be enough to convince her for a long time. Maybe Harry will just have to show her, that he will be there for Draco this time. That they will face it all together.
And he's the one that left two weeks before what he's always called
At the exact same time on weekends too, either stood at the fireplace in his high-collared, starched shirts and neat, pressed trousers, hand in his pocket, brushing floo ash off of himself.
"You'll have all your answers if you meet me tomorrow, Potter," Malfoy said. "So will you come?"
The first time anybody referred to their 'marriage' was a teasing by an elegant, middle-aged woman when she saw how close they were standing next to each other. The second was an old, bizarrely dressed lady that made everything her own business, it seemed. She noticed how aloof Harry was, and was going on about how
"I want to be free with you."
He had been on the edge of erasing him from his mind, wholly and irrevocably, that day. He would have. Pansy says that he should have. That surely nobody could be worth remembering, holding on to, after such terrible grief. That, he did remember, though hazily when it was so closely associated to his lost memories, but he remembered the way it had felt, with not much exaggeration, like he may just be dying without him. Love at its worst. Too much of it, and too much of anything was never a good thing.
"My…" Harry smiled slightly, tasting the sweet word that came in his mouth, the way it felt to think of Draco with it. "My husband, actually."
He is standing there with his hands in his pockets, shy as a schoolboy, head slightly low. But his face is something bare and strange, looking at him. His lips twitch, a helpless and breathy sort of flick, that stops before it can become anything like a smile.
"He's gone, Harry."
"I, um… I found this under Draco's bed. Think these are for you. I didn't read anything. Just saw your name on one of them." He holds it out to Harry. "And I just thought you should…"
Harry takes a second to imagine how
"I brought 'Mione's duplicated notes," Potter announces as he shuffles in through the curtains, stacks of papers under his arm. He drops them down beside Draco with a thud.
"Looking forward to your date next week?" Draco asked, soft and drowsy.
His hands were on Harry's face, by the next second, straddling him, and it was just that almost-kiss again, sharing each other's air as they were looking at each other, Harry's eyes falling on his mouth, and everything was held right here — all the years of circling around each other. The two of them on the edge of finally meeting, crossing over into new meaning.
"What?" Draco asks, when the pause has gone on too long.
Harry's hand shakes. He swallows hard, puts it away on the growing stack of already-read notes. He doesn't pick up another for the rest of the night.
"Yeah. Okay," Ron says. He nods, turns his head into the part of the door. He looks a bit like he doesn't really know what to say. Harry looks down at his hands, wide and fixated. "Um. Okay."
Just as the thought came, however, it went when he remembered the glint of light and life in Malfoy's eyes. He had looked happy today, almost, after months. So was he really?
Hermione smiles when Harry tells her about it, sort of delighted behind the rim of her drink. She's always liked creating influence, even in odd little ways. "Tell him Hermione Granger approves of his work," she says, turning it over in her hand. Harry grins, and tells him so later.
"Potter!"
"No," Draco said. "But I did try to court her, through third and fourth year on my father's orders, but I could tell she was just as disinterested in me beyond our friendship."
And then Ron reached into his pocket and took out a box himself, breaking into a shaky laugh as he held it up, still half-shocked. And the room broke into a laugh right along with him, a raucous full of applause and whoops from several people, Harry grinning so hard his cheeks hurt.
did you make up with her then? How did they take it?"
Draco's lips tighten together, showing those pin-dot dimples again. "You keep trembling like an old man. It's irritating to watch."
"I love you," Harry said, very softly, and Draco went quiet, looking down at his face. It was very close to his own. His mouth quirked, in that way he only ever smiled at Harry with. He looked back to what he was doing, running his hands through Harry's hair. All tender hands and damp hair, that light apostrophe smile mellowing his cheeks.
Harry grimaced in disgust. Did he have to say that?
"COME OUT RIGHT NOW, MALFOY! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUT I KNOW HARRY WENT OUT TO MEET
It goes on for a long time, her crying against him, whispering—
Between them, in the winds of their silence, are all the years, time and history and the things said and unsaid. Done and undone.
"Tell me another," Draco said.
Harry half-laughs. "I'm looking forward to him telling me bedtime stories."
After they finished with lunch, Malfoy stood up, said, "Come on," took hold of his arm and, without warning, Apparated them both over to what appeared to be the outside of a musical concert. It took a minute to orient himself after the sensation of being squeezed through a tube.
At some point, Harry glanced over at Draco, having come back beside him, and found him completely outside of it. Without Teddy or Luna or Andromeda, he couldn't seem to look up from his own plate, pushing at the vegetables and chicken with the tip of his fork, seeming disinterested.
I wasn't able to reply back to most people in the last chapter - been a little up and down these weeks. So I'm saying a general thank you here to everybody who's reading, and who took the time to share their thoughts and leave their kind comments in the last chapter!! As always, I loved reading all your musings on this very odd and complicated little story
It feels a lot like freefalling, when Draco begins to speak, his voice only between the breadth of their faces apart. Potter's arms are a tight grip around him through that freefall, grounding and comforting. He just listens and holds him together all throughout.
"I think I..." Harry said, staring up at the ceiling, unspeakably exhausted in a way that felt deeper than his body. "I think I pressured him."
weird. It's just… I woke up this morning, casted a
Sleep creeps upon Draco like a surprise, without him knowing or expecting, his head full of dreams of a brighter and more beautiful world. Of bright green eyes. Of a hand around his. Of a smile, following him into sleep.
They were sitting on the rug, Harry's arms around Teddy, holding him on his lap as Draco took Teddy's foot in his hand
It's normal, Harry thinks, to feel flustered and discomfited about something like this, especially if he's not into boys, especially if the boy is one he knows has feelings for him. He averts his head further away, looking down at the cracked concrete floor. He gathers his things, feeling Drado's sharp gaze bore into him. "Nothing, I just…" He stands up quickly, dusts his knees. "I just remembered I had something, so I have to go before the classes start." He spins on his feet, and then pauses. He turns back around, clearing his throat. "I'll see you at lunch. Draco."
"Funny how it all turned out, didn't it?" Harry said, softly.
"I'll wait," Harry said.
(Strange, how much he does. How much he wants to see him all the time.)
The sickening fester in his chest is soothed only by the way that, every now and then, when Potter pulls a great stunt that has the crowds cheering and wild, his green eyes find Draco for a short moment, a broad smile on his face that puts his own swollen heart to his throat, slow and erratic, hiding just so behind an uplift at a corner of his mouth.
Either that, or they give each other the googly eyes, and sometimes, if given the opportunity, they disappear off to snog and do other stuff that Harry's not interested in thinking about.
"But you don't like her very much, do you?" Luna says, her eyebrow raising. "I've noticed you always leave whenever she joins us."
are funny, if sometimes of a peculiar sense of humor, and creative, and interesting.
Draco waves back and takes Scorpius over to them.
Harry swallows, frowning. The love he felt mingled with shame, a complicated ball of emotions. He feels it for Ginny, who respected him and protected him even after what he did. He feels it for the boy he loves, that he hurt so terribly that he left everything behind.
They got up only to get themselves something to eat, somewhere around noon, finally. Harry made them both coffee, and then got started on breakfast.
"Fun," Harry said, dryly.
"Time to, er—to work some things out." Draco looks very much on the cusp of his patience, likely at his dawdling about, but seems to be reigning it in. Harry swallows. "I should have said something to you."
Malfoy's eyes kept slipping shut, all droopy. It made him look softer, and Harry felt very tender and raw in his heart. He was thinking about his aunt saying,
Harry remembered Draco again, sickly in the firelight the day the curse had happened to both of them, and knew she understood.
Potter comes right in the middle of Draco's lessons with Luna, smiling in a chagrined way when he notices he's disrupted them.
Harry's brain, in that moment, was very intensely stuck on everything he should not have been thinking about.
Draco groaned, of course Pansy was here.
"I never knew your gray eyes had a blue speck to them." Harry continued.
"Yes, I haven't played in a long time though..do you?" Planter P asked.
"Email them back! You could make your first online friend!" Pansy teased.
"What happened?" The blonde boy noticed.
"Mhm, stalker or not, you sure aren't one to talk mister!" Hermione glared.
"Don't think because you're a robot that you'll be granted with any difference in expectations.." Severus warned.
"You show great loyalty to your robot.."
I left behind my telly, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom.
"Not a lot, just one pill..they look the same!" Hermione argued.
"Honestly Pansy, not everyone shags! But, what did he want?" Hermione wondered.
"Do you guys have a brotherly friendship?" Ron wondered.
They all slowly got out their food, minus Draco who brought nothing.
You dare me to drive??
"It was?" Harry perked.
Which only meant one thing.
"Even if your right, it doesn't get in the way of school.." Hermione determined.
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it then." She insisted.
Then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
"How bad could it be? You guys never talk." Pansy noted.
Yeah, Draco went soft for his robot..
"M-o-mm-a." Harry choked out.
"S-sorry..want me to read for you?" Harry blinked.
"See, it's a good thing I got you out of that!" Hermione insisted.
"Lay off, Malfoy!" Harry raised his voice.
"Hello Theodore!" Harry waved.
"Just shut her door and undo the screws." Harry said.
"Imagination, it's a gift." Luna replied.
"Of course!" Ginny nodded.
Thank you for reading and I appreciate the kudos <3
"Nothing..sorry. What's your name?" Ron asked.
"I wonder what's gonna happen? I bet the whole table will split up by tomorrow." Harry guessed.
"You make me feel like a giddy 13 year old." Draco confessed, leaning on qt's side.
"He's not going anywhere!" Draco intervened.
"What? It is??" Draco panicked.
"But you like everyone." Draco protested.
"He didn't want me near him, or you..maybe he thinks it's weird that I'm a robot?" Harry frowned.
Harry felt like he had been waiting ages for an email back from Sky, it was now the next day prior and every time he checked his email, it would be empty.
"Did you unscrew the door, Potter?!" Umbridge guessed.
"That I do not agree with.." Draco crossed his arms.
"I saw you on the floor, how the hell did that even happen?" Draco wondered.
"Let's cry later, can we talk in your car?" Harry asked.
"Quit arguing!! This topic was something Harry wanted to avoid, this will not solve anything." Hermione objected.
"You get bumped into all the time." Pansy laughs.
"He's gonna be furious if I tell, not even his best friends know.." Harry rambled.
"He said I'll probably hurt someone..what if he was right?" Harry sighed.
Draco casted the spell at 12:30, and yet again, saw qt's outline.
"Explain the constant staring then??" Draco pestered.
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on them perfect.
"Right, whatever..now who did it?" Draco repeated.
"Better break it to him, then." Draco shrugged.
According to his mother, Draco visited the hospital within a few hours after the incident. But when he wasn't allowed to see Harry in his room, Draco went ballistic and broke the windows open bare handed.
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan.
"Good, because I like you, baby.." Draco smiled.
"Harry? Can I ask you something?" Draco wondered.
"Please quiet down." Ginny said.
"Well you are right now! That wizarding family over there is staring due to how unpresentable you look." Lucius scolded.
"I was just giving you shit..I could barely tell I was gay." Draco chuckled.
"What happened?" Draco wondered.
"I'm always upset, Harry." Draco reminded.
"No, I'm being unreasonable..father hates denial, he would've been more agitated if you didn't listen. Considering you're my robot, it's a responsibility that I make sure you're not hurt." Draco believed.
"Yes, we're ready." Draco nodded.
"I already have scissors." Luna grabbed a pair out of her jacket.
"Nobody has a robot, think about the positive side!" Narcissa exclaimed.
"Why are you sorry?"
"Who said I was gonna listen?" Draco chuckled.
"It's easy to tell.." Luna thought.
"It was probably her annoying the class." Ginny figured.
"Perhaps I could do that someday, but as of now I'm not capable of such an heroic act." Draco knew.
"You bloody pushed me you dimwit." Harry insulted jokingly.
"Lucius..remember, the times are different now that he's dead..we can't torture muggleborns forever." Narcissa reminded.
"Do you, do you wanna cuddle with me?" qt broke the kiss.
"No, it's just-" Ginny shook her head.
"Pansy! Why would you email some random person?!" Draco ridiculed.
"You did say that." Crabbe nodded along.
"My first time skipping a whole class period, in a bathroom stall floor next to Draco Malfoy." Harry stated, laughing a little.
"It'll find her I'm sure!" Draco bet.
"I wasn't thinking about anyone." Draco cut off.
"How are you, Luna?" Draco smiled.
"I'm not that stupid, why do you have them?!" Draco asked.
"Thanks so much." Hermione smiled, shutting her eyes.
The good thing about Harry was that he didn't push Draco for answers, the only exception being if Draco was near the extent of crying..he understood Draco's lack of emotion.
"But father, we have house-elves." Draco reminded.
"I would rather go with you than anyone else." Harry admitted.
"I'm jealous of her, not infatuated!" Hermione admitted.
No, Harry didn't like him just because they happened to have the same name..he liked the celebrity for many reasons.
"I'm sorry, I'm nobody else's..only yours." Draco promised.
"Now, back to the nickname thing..you can call me qt, or pot because I have tons of pots." Planter P shifted.
"What? What am I looking for?" Draco wondered.
"Of course, I'll do anything for you." Harry confirmed.
"Hey." Draco greeted.
"Narcissa said she wouldn't read you a bedtime story.." Harry began.
"Aw, these are quite nice..are they a gift?" Luna guessed.
"Sorry Harry, we didn't mean to yell.." Ginny apologized.
"He knows briefly, but nothing in depth." Hermione answered.
Ron's face turned more red when the spell resulted into nothing.
"Why have I been hearing rumors?" Ginny asked.
"Yes, I want you to be mine. Only mine." qt said angrily.
Funny, Harry was Draco's ride home too. Although ditching him just allows Draco to ride with Nott, and as much as that hurt Harry to think about..he'd rather have that than even look at Draco.
"He's missed more practices too." Harry added.
"It's my toad, uh Trevor." He raised the animal.
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me!
"I have an idea! I'll turn Scabbers yellow!" Ron decided.
"Yeah, I'll be there." Harry nodded.
Harry knew there seats were closer to the stage, so he figured that would be his best chances of finding her.
"Dray, I-i love you, so m-much, a-and I missed y-you." Harry sniffled.
"I heard countless amount of mudbloods are attending Hogwarts this year.." Lucius scowled.
"Can I try on your sweater? Please?" Harry asked.
"Look at what I sent them." Pansy gestured to the screen.
"I actually have a pocket-knife, should we go and pay her a visit?" Draco threatened.
"That bothers you? Or is it bothering you right now?" Harry questioned.
"No, you don't." Draco glared.
Draco watched as Harry stirred, and almost felt bad for waking him up.
"Huh? That you had a small dick?" Draco questioned.
"Thanks, y-you guys don't think I'm crazy?" Hermione smiled.
"I have never ate ice cream, but I would like that." Harry grinned.
"Why on earth would he be doing that? Spying is a bit peculiar as it is, why would it be directed towards me of all people?" Hermione wondered.
Harry touched his slicked hair for a few moments, before pulling his hand away.
"Thank you..I wonder if she found out about Thomas and Finnigan shagging?" Pansy wondered.
"So do your manners, now quit whining! I'll be in my office." Umbridge said, entering the office area.
Grade: Last Year of Middle School
"Very cool." Harry complimented.
Warning: Drinking
"The barrel's are cute." Harry smiled.
"I don't know, we always drive nowadays." Draco shrugged.
"And I didn't listen." Harry retorted.
"He called you- you're cool Harry." Crabbe said.
"What, you aren't exclusive yet?" Draco smirked.
Draco practically jumped out of his car, rushing over to Harry frantically.
Draco really didn't mean to, but he scooted closer towards Harry..hoping the chances of getting slapped were lower.
"Alright, Sky..well, you better go home then. Thanks for stopping over." Pot suggested.
"I better get closer then." Pansy moved, standing next to a pillar nonchalantly.
"..harry!"
"Determined and clever yes, but I'm leaning towards another.."
"You'll probably get knocked over." Harry figured.
"No story tonight, next time think before you make a decision like this." Narcissa shook her head.
"Minus 10 points from Hufflepuff!" Severus docked.
"Lower your voice.." Luna reminded.
"Father says a lot of nonsense when he's frustrated. I said it looked good, and nobody's judgement is as accurate as mine." Draco reassured.
"I do not, Neville is just a friend of mine." Hermione dismissed.
"Mhm..uh, I like it." Harry laughed a little.
"No, Luna doesn't want us listening to rumors." Draco denied.
"I didn't go bonkers." Draco claimed.
"Daddy, can I stay at Annie's tonight?" Scorpius asks, holding Draco's hand and looking up at him.
Draco hums. There's a rustling sound, like he's shifting around, and it comes through in his voice, "Honestly, you know, I'd say I'm still getting used to Weasley."
"He can't floo over time to time?" Ron asks.
In the dark, he could see the tremors of a narrow back.
"You look like shite," Harry pointed out, then, just to say something that would cut through the quiet. Malfoy was pale, even paler than normal, and it stood out starkly against the dark shadows around his eyes.
Harry thought, trying it out. He was looking at the face next to him.
The voice is now closer. There's a face below him, the radiating heat of a body at his legs. He blinks, hard and rapid, focusing on it. On the green of eyes, bright and brilliant. On the ebony of hair. Dark brows. Glasses. Golden-brown skin. Lightning scar.
Draco sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. "Even so, I doubt they'd want to help a former Death-Eater, Harry." He briefly got stuck on the sound of his first name in his voice, for the first time ever in a way that felt personal and close. "It's not… it can't work. You know that, so just. Just let it go, okay? Please."
"And clearly you'd changed your mind," Potter lifts one hand out of his pocket to gesture at him, vaguely. "What did it?"
"Yes." Draco sounded like he was trying very hard to go along with this
"Was it…" Harry said, the sickening burn in his chest making his voice a rough, uneven rasp. He took a second to let that settle, speak again when he sounded more controlled. He tilted his head slightly down and closer, wanting to see Draco's face. "Was it somebody you knew?"
"Did it scar?"
adores him. Like it wasn't enough that he has always been favoured in everything Draco has ever wanted to be good at, now even his son worships the ground he walks on!
Overhead, the stars scatter across the sky, Draco already half-asleep in the cocoon of his heat and solidity and comfort, to the sound of his name in Harry's voice, the reverberating of it in his chest under the curl of Draco's fingers. All his good and joy and comfort. Forgetting, in the minute just before he falls over the edge, where exactly he is.
So Draco was being affected by his negative emotions, and he was in love with Harry. Because of the pain of unrequited love, it wasn't enough for them to be on friendly terms, as Harry was told it would be (and he didn't know Draco was in love with him, ofc, so he couldn't understand why it didn't work). So this was what made Draco ill, because there was a bigger hole to fill between them that friendship and civility wasn't enough to fill
* * *
"Not a lot, no. It
"Just asking."
"It's our last year here, isn't it. I'll be visiting them all the time after school anyway. But a Christmas at Hogwarts, as a student — that won't happen again after this year."
"No," Harry says, shaking his head. He scrubs his hands down his face. "Sorry. I don't... I don't know what I was thinking."
"I didn't 'drag you out' of anywhere. I was going to leave you there, wasn't I?"
At some point, Luna had made her way to him, smiling, pulling Draco in close by the shoulders. There was a very strange look on his face, when he held her back after a delayed second of astonishment, settling his chin to her shoulder.
"I just… I don't feel right, that's all," Harry said, hand half in his hair, a tremulous and uncertain sort of laugh. "I don't know."
"Oh there is another way," Ezekiel said, a satirical cheer to his tone. "Though I'm sure not everybody would be on board with this. Shall I
He was interrupted by a loud sound, a roar of fire from the other room. Molly came rushing inside as Ron and Hermione stood up, and was onto them by the next second, touching Hermione's shoulder, Harry's face with both hands, her eyes looking Ron up and down, frantically asking, "What's happening? Merlin,
Harry rubbed his hands down his face, fingers hard over his eyes under his glasses. "God, you're
onto the makeshift dance floor of the living room, but soon he was laughing, shaking his head, letting all their goofy spinning and dancing make him forget for a moment.
When the silence begins to press down on his lungs, he asks her to speak to him, and she does. She keeps up a chatter of everything and nothing, about her wild rose bushes in the garden, sometimes asking him of Potter and his time in the hospital, but sometimes there isn't anything left to say inside a big house with little to do.
He and Draco haven't talked in days. Harry thought he would go to him when they were both feeling a bit calmer, though Harry doesn't think he's entirely calm about everything yet. There is still a lot that he needs to wrap his head around, and he thinks it might take him a lot longer to, but he hasn't talked to Draco since that night on the Astronomy Tower. The guilt sank in deeper the longer he ruminated over what he said, tried to understand better how Draco must be really feeling.
Everything was so very slow and calm from up here. All these rivers of life and people, flowing from place to place, unaware of the pairs of eyes on them all.
"It's not infidelity if I didn't choose this," Harry said, his defenses hiking up. "It's not
" She swallowed, inspecting the smoke that dissipated a few seconds after. "It's a curse. From the looks of it, it's a dark one. Oh, Harry, why didn't you say you haven't been feeling well?"
Harry is desperately, painfully relieved to hear that, that he has people there around him, that he's safe and getting better and not alone. He wants to ask who the friends are, but he thinks Narcissa won't answer that. There is a lot she doesn't answer, to protect Draco's whereabouts.
But Harry's eyes drift, in the midst of chaos and applause and wolf-whistles, to the boy he told weeks ago that he was in love with him.
Draco waits, his face poised and set. He raises an eyebrow when nothing further is said. "So what?"
"Maybe. Yes. It's… it's the only thing that makes any sense, what little it does," Draco said. "But… if I am honest, I wouldn't have listened to you if I didn't have my own reasons as well."
And so, all that it meant, and the thick layer of gunk that had furled itself around his heart every time, was locked away inside those moments too.
Narcissa is still as kind and fond of him as she was before, greeting him with an embrace and a kiss to his cheek, so Harry doesn't know if she's aware of what happened between him and Draco. She sits him down for tea.
On the porch Draco comes to join him, wearing his coat. Harry doesn't notice how cold he is until the heavy warmth is seeping into his body, down his back. Draco has lifted a side of his coat and draped it over Harry's shoulders, the two of them huddled closely together under it.
"She speaks of you," Draco tells her. "Often in ways that, I believe, means she misses you."
Harry stared at him, at the ripped apart man in front of him, on the verge of becoming frantic. He sounded like a caged man begging for freedom.
Malfoy's expression shifted slightly, something nearly of a softening, but not quite. He smirked, long, nimble fingers curling around his hand. "Goodbye, Potter."
Harry wanted to touch the bruises around his eyes, but he didn't.
Harry supposed it was about time he try to make proper conversation now. Malfoy's been quite alright so far, so why not?  "Do you come here often?"
He left out the door without waiting for Elias' reaction, without even a goodbye, hardly able to think. He was overwhelmed by the malaise, the suffocating shame and guilt thickening over his sternum. He found the closest Apparition point and went home.
Draco made a noise, a mirthless sort of laugh. "Oh, you're not the one they'll take that up with."
"It is..he was a gift from my parents, I quite like him actually." Draco admitted.
"You were gonna shoot yourself?" Harry frowned.
"Well, I better get to the car! See you for brunch tomorrow, Harry?" Ginny opened the door.
I'm not too mad, I just find it cruel that you don't answer fans.
"In my defense, it's impossible for her to have known what your mother would've said..I found that hateful." Hermione comforted.
"None of you believe me it seems.." Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry can't tell Pansy or Hermione about his conversation with Draco, but things get heated during lunch when people start accusing Thomas and Finnigan of shagging.
"Your aunt and uncle are cunts by the way." Draco motioned to Harry.
"Harry, honey..please, say something, anything!" Lily begged.
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
Within seconds Harry was laying next to Draco in his bed.
Inevitably, they were nothing out of the ordinary.
"Which is the perfect time to leave a scene." Hermione mentioned.
"You're not convincing me." Hermione said.
I never knew my father neither.
"Hm, you're a very smart robot." Draco noted.
"I don't know what you're on about." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Dray!" Pansy approached, Daphne trailing behind her.
"And? I'm pretty sure Finnigan and him are shagging." Pansy thought.
Perhaps Harry thought it was Draco's birthday..or maybe he really did find Draco to be those things..
Draco had kissed Harry on the cheek before, and it made him believe that something might've been there..maybe there was..but whatever it is, Nott definitely had more of it to land himself an actual kiss on the lips.
"Alright, why are all of you in detention?" Ginny asked.
Grade: First Year of Middle School
Once Draco was able to get Harry situated successfully, it was time to talk..for real.
"Draco, don't you think you're overreacting a little.." Blaise said.
Draco knew where this was leading, he wasn't totally naive. People don't just constantly think about a friend, unless there's something more to it..and he knew his thoughts about qt were beginning to be more than just platonic.
"He likes to watch me fly up close." Draco says.
"Alright." Draco gestured him to the closet.
"Thank you." Harry smiled.
"I was able to bring Draco with us, he honestly needed it!" Pansy exclaimed.
"For a Slytherin you sure aren't the best liar." Ronald chuckled.
Draco wondered how long he had been sleeping for, and what drew him to that spot in particular?
"You play sports, use that fat body to use!" Umbridge yelled.
Harry slammed the door shut, letting out a breath that somehow turned into a sob.
"I knew it was a mouthful!" Theodore called.
"Do you think we can stop arguing all the time?" Harry asked.
"I've never seen you in this.." Harry looked at a red-orange patterned sweater.
"No, he's always talking with his-" Pansy began.
"Yeah.." Neville nodded as he made his way to the unoccupied bed.
"You'll totally humiliate me, so no thanks." Hermione declined.
"Pathetic, a Hufflepuff knows better than a Gryffindor..boil cure is what we'll be focusing on for today's lesson. I hope you all can keep up, as I know most of you will struggle in this area." Severus assumed.
Yes, Draco did admit, his wand was rather nice..
"I can't, this door is heavier than you I think!" Harry jokes.
"Do you need something?" Harry wondered.
"Hm, that's too bad..my ex is obsessed with Quidditch, so I used to play with her a bit after the war. We broke up a few years ago, but we're still friends." Planter P explained.
"I love you too." Harry smiled. He really meant it too..Harry has never said those words to him before, nor has Draco said it to him. They would always just comfort each other by saying, "you're my best friend." Which, of course, was true..but it didn't nearly make Harry this happy. Harry has said the words many times to his parents, but with Draco, it was a different kind of love. He couldn't really explain why it felt so different, but it made his heart flutter with pure happiness.
Hermione crossed her arms stubbornly, although there was no point doing so as she leant against the pillar too.
"Draco, that is perfect." Draco admired.
"Shut up and go back to the table! I'm trying to listen!" Pansy scolded.
"No, go ahead." Harry gestured.
"A robot?" Goyle blinked.
"Fine! Have it your way, but I'll be the one winning! I bet they'll already have a new seating table by the time you ask!" Hermione bet.
"Dray?" Harry said.
"Without a script or production? That'll surely be difficult to manage." Hermione doubted.
"Why are you jealous of Lavender?" Harry asked.
"Yeah, but that's totally different..she's a girl." Draco claimed.
"Uh, Ron Weasley." Ron responded.
"Hermione!" Harry shouted.
"I find you cool as well Gregory." Harry smiled.
"Who forced you to do it? I know someone did, who was it?!" Draco asked.
"No, I wouldn't do that-" Dean denied.
"I just hit my elbow." Harry grimaced.
"Thanks for noticing." Harry sighed.
Harry can't stop worrying about Hermione's absence, and it hits him that he brought his phone to the concert. Harry sighs in relief and goes to reach for his phone, but the relief vanishes immediately when he remembers that Hermione was holding onto his!
"I can't say, I'm prohibited from telling anyone!" Harry said.
"I know your mind keeps drifting to that, but put it away for a minute..you don't know me that well." Luna shifted.
Harry did plenty of helping, what was his godfather on about?
"Congrats?" Draco blinked.
"Well, it was really fantastic meeting you..can we go back to your room Dray?" Pansy pleaded.
Madam Hooch brought Neville to the Hospital Wing, leaving Draco and his peers by themselves.
"Not intentionally, but he knows the seat numbers..I'm Pansy by the way!" Pansy introduced.
"Harry." Draco spoke up.
Hm, small world.
"Listen Dean, maybe we should talk in private.." Ginny frowned.
"It's fine..she's right, I'm a liar." Harry said.
"Fine, in 20 minutes then!" Draco declared.
"Look at your inbox." Pansy suggested.
"What did you do?" Lucius daggered toward Harry.
"I think you're cooler than everyone here." Draco poked Harry's right cheek.
"The spell wore off I think..sorry." Harry frowned.
"Will do." Harry nodded.
"Draco? Isn't t-that latin for d-dragon?" Harry thought.
"Fuck off, I'm not doing it." Harry repeated.
"You're gonna bake everything yourself?" Harry questioned.
"No, you wouldn't do that..not to hurt her intentionally." Planter P thought.
"Boil cure..it's a potion that'll remove one's boil." Draco answered.
"I still work at my potions shop." Pansy says.
"You will stay here to make sure Mr.Malfoy doesn't miss any importance." McGonagall decided.
"Lovely to see you, Pansy! Oh, is that Draco??" Hermione noticed.
Harry's breathing tenses, panic rising through him.
"He did." Ron insisted.
"No, birthmarks." Harry lied.
"Enlighten us then?" Draco pestered.
"Would you like to come in?" Luna asked.
"Yeah, actually you're the moron! You've only known Harry since June, how is it you keep defending him!? He's a robot, you don't know what he's capable of doing!" Theodore spat.
"Sorry..uh, did you like the kiss?" Draco wondered.
"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one." A girl interrupted.
"I do not have a boner! How could I get one from a simple conversation!?" Harry crossed his arms.
"No. You're the first Malfoy in Hufflepuff, that's a milestone..If you were to be in Slytherin you'd grow into a replica of Lucius, who wants to be someone who already exists? It's a good thing to be different, I think it makes you cool." Harry believed.
"I didn't mean that Malfoy is a bad person, I was just saying that he isn't nice." Ronald defined.
"A Malfoy?" Ron blinked.
"Easy enough." Draco stood up from his chair, walking to Umbridge's office.
"You are also cool Vincent." Harry returned.
Draco ordered himself pistachio, and noticed Harry eyeing the chocolate..because it was his birthday, Draco decided to order that for him.
"I am tired." Draco yawned.
"We're sitting over here." Luna motioned.
"Well she's here somewhere, might've went to the loo." Pansy figured.
"My confidence is lower now, great." Harry rolled his eyes.
"It sucks that he's your crush, if it were someone like Zabini you'd probably tell us." Pansy figured.
"She won't bother us, good enough reason for me." Draco shrugged.
"Luna! Brilliant, I'll text her to give me Hermione's number!" Harry exclaimed.
"I always taste my products myself, I trust my own judgement." Draco stated.
"I must go, my dad just arrived..stay calm for me." Luna smiled, pushing the exit doors and heading to the parking lot.
"You're the wizard with a robot?" A bloke guessed.
And the thing Draco feared came to place as he saw the letter drop on his bed.
"That takes a lot of work, good for you mate." Ronald smiled.
"See you at school!" Ginny called after her.
"Yes, it is..how's the concert been over here?" Hermione asked.
"Yes, I was worried...I didn't see you get sorted?" Neville noticed.
"It was sharp, like needle point sharp." Harry grimaced.
"She doesn't even go to our school anymore." Harry reminded.
"Well, I can't be too shocked can I? How do robots normally spend their birthday?" Draco wondered.
"How so?" Harry stared at him.
"I'm sorry, I swear if it were my decision I'd tell you guys, but he told me specifically not to.." Harry frowned.
"Uh sorry, let me get this straight..you wanna fake date? Why don't you just tell your mom if she adores him?" Harry wondered.
"Just, go away." Harry murmured.
"Harry?" Draco knocked on his door.
"Ginny and I will search for my dad..Draco, Luna, do you mind waiting in here?" Hermione asked.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Harry repeated.
"He's asleep." Hermione says.
Harry snapped back into his conscious state, still feeling the urging pain from his hit to the face.
"Let's go back to me locking Umbridge in her office..anyone have ideas?" Draco wondered.
"Harry? Are the other's asleep?" Draco whispered from his bed that following night.
"Hey! What's going on with the door!?" Umbridge yelled, shaking the door handle.
Having a personal robot is weird, but Draco's parents weren't lying about how beneficial Harry would be.
"I wanna s-see you so b-bad."
"Don't be ridiculous, he'll do you well..if not, I can discard him by the end of your first year." Lucius reassured.
"Nott would've gave me up.." Draco tilted his head.
Apparently it wasn't close enough because he felt a hand slap from Ronald a few minutes later.
"You wanna know why I haven't had a girlfriend since age 15, Ginerva? It's because I turned her down for sex..I've never had sex with a girl, probably never will..all cause of me being gay." Draco admitted.
"Draconis, that's a cool name." Harry complimented.
Hey Potter, I drank a fifth of vodka.
It's been six months and still no word, I don't believe it??
"That's a shocking one..since you're my personal robot, I take it I can tell you anything?" Draco assumed.
"I was a poor 10 year old living with my auntie and uncle, now my dad has lots." Harry smiled.
"Well I am your teacher, and you will do as I say! Now, come over here and open this door!" Umbridge demanded.
"5 months." Pansy replied.
"Sure, he may not look creepy, but once we're asleep he'll make a plan to hurt us all." Zacharias assumed.
"Yes, but I haven't been on a broom since the war..Quidditch felt more like a chore than a fun game to me." Draco replied.
"Pansy came over again yesterday." Draco shared.
"He's tolerable." Draco stated.
"Asking a guy for his number won't help either dray." Pansy smirked.
That didn't last long, when Hermione Granger was second to arrive.
The next to arrive was Harry Potter, who chose to sit in the spot next to Ginny.
Sorry for the shortish chapter, thanks for reading :)
"Yes?" Draco wondered.
"Hm, I tell you what to do? That'll be intriguing." Draco noted.
"You know I don't fancy a school dance." Draco reminded.
"Come sit down then." Hermione ushered.
Only 5 points? Consider Draco as satisfied.
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest.
Warning: Slight harassment
"You're hot. And blonde." Harry blurted.
"No prison for me then." Draco shrugged.
"Who contacted us?" Theodore wondered.
"Well Hermione sure can." Draco teased.
"No, I think you're already perfect." Draco believed.
"You know for a past Slytherin you sure suck at lying..now what did you do this time? Sign me up for a gay porn site?" Draco assumed.
"You never look silly, I am always impressed by you." Harry complimented.
"There's always rumors babe." Dean chuckled.
Harry was truly a great birthday gift.
Time: Final Lacrosse Match
"My pencil needs to be sharpened." Draco complained.
"You show the lacrosse team your dick?? Is there tryouts?" Draco wondered.
"Luna will be coming, and I reckon she did you a huge favor.." Pansy reminded.
"Drinking tea is a pleasure." Draco thanks Harry.
"Hello." Draco returned, feeling anxious at the sight.
"It's not forcing, just a few simple questions?" Ginny rolled her eyes.
"A robot??" Crabbe blinked.
After begging Ginny and Harry, they eventually all agreed.
"It's fine Pansy, I am a mean person.." Draco shrugged.
Which, was an overall accurate description if you think about it..except, there were things nobody knew about Harry but himself. The biggest one being that he was a gay teenager in the closet..nobody knew this, at least that's what Harry thought.
"I do. You want me to give him this?" Luna assumed.
"I don't want a 10 year old robot reading me a bedtime story.." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Hm, must be as bad as Potter's I reckon." Draco jokes.
Now it's too late, I'm on the thousands downers now, I'm drowsy.
"Do you like stars, Malfoy?" Harry wondered.
"I think this'll be easy!" Draco figured.
So, he called him.
"Yes, that would be perfect! Tell him it's from Sky or star baker, please." Draco grinned.
"Consider it to be a harmful hex." Lucius hinted.
"That's n-nice..I saw Neville in your contacts, how do you know him?" Harry shifted the subject.
"Uh, yes." Harry nodded.
"Fine, I just wish I was friends with the people she's close with.." Hermione admitted.
"Dray, you aren't fooling us..maybe Daphne's sister would believe it." Pansy says.
"Did your parents go there?" Harry wondered.
But qt was different.
"Draco is strong in many ways..he is a strong quidditch player, he has a strong heart, he's the strongest person I know!" Harry stated.
"He just asked me about the fight, what was happening, and why I was on the floor.." Harry explained.
"Quite well, and not just because I'm sitting next to an attractive bloke." Draco laughed nervously.
Dear Potter, I wrote you but I still found no response.
"Alright." Draco sighed.
"Besides the pain..I did." Harry nodded sheepishly.
"Mental that one, I'm telling you." Ron whispered.
"Potter, sit down you wreckless child!" Umbridge approached.
Harry gulped before hurrying to open the door, revealing a red faced Umbridge.
"Yes." Harry confirmed.
Harry anxiously waits for an email back from Sky, but it keeps him distracted during the school day.
"You're a muggle at a wizarding school?" Neville blinked confused.
lol bitch what was that RHYME- bake the wait away, help me..
Luna and Pansy drag Draco out to lunch, he wanted to stay home and email qt..what makes it more unbearable, is that the golden trio was eating lunch with them. They didn't torment each other, or use any childish antics like that..but it's always awkward having lunch with your prior rivals..and even weirder to get drunk with them.
Hey Potter, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
"Have you heard that Thomas and Finnigan have been shagging?" Harry asked.
Draco responded with a quick grin, trying to ignore the way Harry's words were affecting him.
"What?! How am I gay??" Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco goes to Diagon Alley with his robot.
"Fine, I think it's time Malfoy comes into my office." Umbridge thought.
"You go into the tunnel last..that way no one will look at your bottom." Harry says.
Great, another embarrassing moment to add.
"Yes..I'm the only bloke who should make you feel giddy." qt lowered his voice.
"Yes..only for like a minute." Harry shrugged.
"This is another level of risk taking, let's go Hermione-" Harry moved, but of course a body had to knock him over.
"I've kept collected around my parents, but between us, I am counting down the days until King's Cross." Draco admitted.
5 calls later, and Hermione hasn't picked up.
"No, I do, I do." Lockhart insisted.
"Who do you think you are?" Draco clenched his fists.
"You would wanna go with me?" Draco blinked.
"Can you cut it for me?" Luna asked.
Harry: Age 16
For more clarification, Harry's hair looks very well done due to Lucius' hair spell..therefore Draco has never seen his natural messy hair. Thank you for reading :)
Draco knew before even opening it that his father had been the one to write it..he's seen the way he writtened plenty of times.
"Thank you." Draco nodded, exiting the greenhouse.
"You are special." Luna complimented.
"I bet it looks lovely on you!" Harry figured.
"You'll be explaining this to your head of house, follow me Mr.Malfoy!" McGonagall instructed.
"Shut up you, git!" Harry stood from his chair.
"No, no, it means a lot to me..it just gives me such high hopes, and you know I can be pessimistic." Draco elaborated.
"Uh, sure." Harry allowed.
"Thank you, follow me Harry." Draco directs.
"Hm, that's interesting!" Daphne commented.
Harry: 16
"She probably just heard the rumor." Harry assumed.
"Beeve will excuse himself." Beeve leaves the room.
"Yes..are you ok?" Draco hesitantly walked to the figure.
"Sorry.." Draco muttered.
"I don't think it's bad to be gay..maybe you were right, maybe I am bi." Harry said.
Draco did not find Theodore's comment agreeable.
"Call him Draco." Harry glared.
"At least just tell us how he got one??" Pansy begged.
Harry ignored his friend, groaning in anger while seeing his inbox still empty.
"I think you do..I don't like liars, admit the truth now!" Umbridge demanded.
"Yellow? That's the color of urine.." Draco noted.
"No, and don't change the subject! You like Brown!" Draco insisted.
"Fine, later Malfoy?" Harry asked.
"Surely you could tell us what that was about?" Hermione hoped.
Harry was still haunted by the memory of Nott, but it didn't compare to what Draco witnessed during his coma..even if Draco didn't return his feelings, Draco was still his best friend.
"Floo, like how Draco fly's?" Harry assumed.
"Quit gaping like a fish...no, they got me an actual robot." Draco insisted.
"Well then we must get in touch!" Hermione declared.
Harry lived with parents, Lily and James Potter, along with his younger sister Lisa. Lily was a kind mother, who always did her best to help the family. James was more of the fun parent, but at the end of the day he loved them both equally.
"Well I better keep searching for Neville's toad, make sure to change into your robe's Ron." Hermione reminded as she left the compartment.
"Hey, don't be an ass!" Ginny ridiculed.
"What makes you say that?" Draco wondered.
and kissed him.
Draco followed her inside, he barely went to Hogsmeade anymore.
Draco complied, walking over to the Hufflepuff tables wearily.
"I've never even seen him with a book..I bet he was spying on you, again." Harry assumed.
"How was that?" Harry snorted.
Harry sits on the available chair sloppily, his brain consuming everything.
"Is that a toad?" Harry spotted.
"You do, you mean the world to me." Draco insisted.
"It's f-fine..I missed you." Harry tried to touch Draco's hand, but a broken wrist made it a bit difficult.
Towards the end of the game, things started to get more aggressive between the two teams. More of Harry's teammates were getting injured, the other team was going up in scores, and Harry was seemingly more stressed.
UH OH IS RIGHT
Time: First Year Anniversary
Draco: 16
"Just, don't talk." Harry insisted.
"I can sense the reasoning." Luna spoke up.
"Hello!" The bus driver greeted.
Harry wasn't gonna object, but he did find it a bit random that a boy wanted to sit next to him.
"Minus 5 points for a Gryffindor answering a question with pure stupidity.." Severus took away.
"Sorry..wow, Hogwarts looks out of this world up close!" Ron awed.
"Draco!?" Narcissa approached, a very angry Lucius behind her.
"The sophomore? Why would you do that?" Ginny asked.
"If you're so good, then try out for the team with me next spring." Draco glared.
"Anyway, how about you fly by me and Blaise, Draco?" Theodore continued.
"Thank you..I'm opening a bakery soon, and if you want you're welcome to stop by whenever." Draco offered.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco?" Harry entered, noticing right away that Draco was taking up one of the stalls.
"There you are- Oh my! What is going on with Harry's hair?" Narcissa found them.
"I do, actually..look, this is highly random, so I understand if you don't wanna..but you remember how we worked on the piano lesson together at my manor a few months back?" Draco recalled.
"I'll talk to Ron!" Ginny and Harry promised in unison.
"Harry and I of course." Draco replied.
Harry sighed into his hands, anger boiling from his confrontation with Umbridge.
"That is not true!" Draco flushed defensively.
Right, Draco knew what a hex was...the dark lord used them plenty of times before he died.
"A private school. My mother wanted me to attend Hogwarts, but my father despised the place." Draco explained.
"Hmm, something looks off at their table.." Pansy thought.
Perhaps there was a problem at the post office or something.
"I bet you don't know what my constellation looks like." Draco challenged.
"Clean it up." Finnigan replied.
"Oh, is it not qt?" Draco blinked.
"Really?" Ginny huffed.
"Are you talking about the sinning of liking both men and women?? Did I hear mister Potter is this?" Umbridge approached.
and at the realisation as to why exactly Malfoy had wanted him to come along. "Oh."
"People are saying very unkind things about you," Lovegood points out, stroking a Thestral's fur. Draco has been able to see them since Fifth Year, but now many others at Hogwarts can as well, from the way several of the students are staring right at the creatures. They are mesmerizing and unsettling in equal measures to look at, gaunt and mystical.
"Yeah," Harry says into her hair. He swallows. "I love you."
"Well, I did also say a sore loser."
Was this distance the reason why Draco wasn't able to tell him?
Draco is sort of stunned about it, for a couple of seconds. "Merlin help me," he says then, snickering. "You're sickening."
* * *
In this dim and grey world now, he is the only thing that is still as bright and beautiful as his dreams. Still the most beautiful boy he's ever seen. From a boy in a robe shop to the boy sitting here in front of him. From a boy in a robe shop to a man he'd spent a faux life with sitting beside him, holding his hand.
He seemed awfully surprised for a brief second, straightening upright with a hand on the arm of his sofa. It changed into a blandly polite squinch at the corners of his mouth, turning his face away as he put his drink on the side table.
Harry doesn't say anything.
"I don't know her."
But it was fair, and he knew it was. Hadn't Harry not wanted him then either? Hadn't he made that very clear as well?
It took him a while to get his voice back again, and say, "Big D." The carefulness of keeping his voice even, his expression casual, came through. "Surprise seeing you here."
"Boring! Boring! Boring!" Matthew chants.
After that was a trip to Honeydukes for some sweets, some Butterbeers at Leaky Cauldron, and then a Quidditch match between the Holyhead Harpies and the Wimbourne Wasps.
"You have a lovely room." Harry observed.
Thank you for reading
"Oh yeah, your ass was big." Draco remembered.
"Pathetic? I saw you after getting sorted, you were about to cry!" Zacharias accused.
"I'm glad you came." Harry spoke first, trying to clear the silence.
"That's weird? You two both got out of relationships recently..was it so you two could be together?" Draco implied.
Besides that, how's your son?
"I never thought you'd ask..I'd love to." Draco agreed.
He wants to be just like you, hell, he likes you more than I do.
"Feisty girl you got, Potter." Draco teased.
I read about your wife's friend, I'm sorry.
"There's a secret? Oh, if you don't feel comfortable we won't force you to say.." Hermione reassured.
Janitor Granger eyed the 5 before leaving, Hermione sighing to herself.
"Mate, I-"
"My birthday is on the date July 31st..I'm 10." Harry says.
Growing up Harry always admired concerts, but of course, he was never eligible to attend thanks to his awful relatives.
"No." Harry cupped Draco's face, looking into his eyes before leaning in and kissing him. Draco made a gasping noise, that allowed Harry to slip his tongue into his mouth. Draco contemplated the thought of whether to kiss back or not, but the feeling of Harry's tongue devouring him made it impossible to resist the urge of kissing back.
"Went to the wrong dorm? So did I." Justin flushed.
"Also, single." Pansy winked, causing Draco to shoot daggers at her.
Draco blinked, it was dark like Planter P had said..but he could see just a little bit.
"Quit calling him that!" Draco shoved the Slytherin's shoulder.
And Harry loved it too.
Draco didn't bother asking questions, and instead walked to his dorm with Harry.
"How did Lucius get a hold of a robot? Tell him to contact my parents so they can get me one too!" Pansy cheers.
"First concerts can be scary, but you'll be fine." Pansy reassured.
Harry wheeled his chair to the parking lot, trying to look for Draco's car.
Draco glanced at the muggleborn, who was clearly distressed.
"Way to bully me..in all seriousness, what should I call you by?" Draco wondered.
"My decision stands..come along Mr.Malfoy." McGonagall directs.
"Pencil? Potter, is that your fear?" Draco asked.
"Let's skip till next period then." Draco decided.
Warning: Suicidal thoughts, traumatic childhood, mentions of death, homophobia, drug use. Please exit the story if you don't feel comfortable reading further.
Oh well.
"I don't recall saying that.." Draco hummed.
"I'd love to continue watching this..whatever this was, but I'd like to speak with Potter if you don't mind?" Draco interrupted.
Draco didn't dare to think on it any longer, and opened the email.
"I suppose, we'll finish up with your supplies." Lucius agreed.
"Ron, the twins, Percy.." Harry trailed.
"There you are!" She hands the cup over.
Maybe my writing was too small, I do that when I'm in a brawl.
"Yes, but you're still really cool..I'd do anything to be cool like you." Harry admitted.
"My mom's a drunk, my dad's a bastard politician..he's embarrassed of me, but everyone is, so it doesn't matter. About the fight with Nott, he was calling me a fag, a queer basically. Normally I don't let that stuff bother me, but I've known him since age 3..having someone you've grown up with calling you a slur- it just sucked." Draco sighed.
"Nobody as amazing as you deserves to be upset." Harry thought.
"I locked you in the office.." Harry lied.
Harry quickly picked up Draco's voice..was someone hurting him?
"I'm fine, now kiss me-" Harry insisted, grabbing Draco's shirt, but rather disappointed once Draco stepped away.
"I'm sorry qt, I'm so sorry..I was with some people from Hogwarts, and we had some butterbeers..we were all stargazing, and I fucking cuddled up to the bloke next to me- and y-you are m-my favorite p-person, and I feel so s-selfish for n-not thinking a-bout you..I'm sorry." Draco cried.
Draco froze, feeling the desire to disapparate.
"Yes..park in the lot, I'll find a way to get out."
"Yes, you can." Planter P nodded.
"I think you should be able to express yourself." Ginny thought.
"How do you get him to praise you like that?" Daphne wondered.
"Father might have another one of his tantrums, he despises when unexpected guests arrive..mother and father would scold me for my behavior, I definitely can't have that on my very own birthday." Draco remembered.
"That's very considerate of you." Hermione smiled.
"You're the one yelling." Hermione glared.
"You speak?" Draco noted.
"I always thought girls were more fascinating than boys, it occured to me early..I even had a liking to Hermione when I was 15, but it wasn't meant to be more." Luna admitted.
Draco squinted, Odyssey was his parent's owl?
"Who do you think it is? I'm thinking Neville-" Parvati continued.
Harry sat calmly on bus seat 11, until a certain blonde practically launched into the spot beside him.
They Floo'd to Diagon Alley, the setting totally opposite from the manor.
Harry awakened shortly after, who didn't seem to notice that it was Draco who woke him up.
"I might've done an email of my own..using your email." Pansy smirked.
"There you are!" A blonde male approached the seat between them.
"I understand if it's sudden..but do you wanna be my boyfriend? I mean, I love you and we kissed-" Harry rambled.
"Thank you, this has been my best birthday yet..sit if you'd like." Harry accepted.
"Hey Hufflegrump." Theodore greeted at the pitch.
"Everyone has brains..but I won't say if you wish." Luna promised.
"Apparently him." Blaise shrugged.
"Yes." Draco nodded, leaning to press a kiss onto Harry's lips.
Draco examines his robot, that hasn't spoken a word yet..how is a non-verbal robot beneficial?
"You're right, it simply cannot..could you perhaps invite them in secret?" Draco compromised.
But things change, and Harry can't believe that he's about to enter a stadium for bloody singer, Harry Styles!
"Maybe you're right." Draco sighed.
"Well I'm not becoming friends with a random ass person, but I should at least apologize..it was probably frightening after all." Draco decided.
"I thought we'd skip school today?" Harry figured.
"You like Harry now?" Luna assumed.
Harry didn't, and instead scooted on the floor so he was in Draco's stall.
"Absolutely bollocks..she's nice, but I don't thinks she's learned how to keep her hands to herself." Draco thought.
"You were annoying before..and you are now, but less." Harry rambled.
"Alright, you're bisexual. Does that fit better?" Draco snorted.
qt brought his hand to caress Draco's left arm, the touch was safe, warm.
"No! I was just shocked at how you'd let people see you, I wouldn't.." Harry rambled.
"No, it looks good on you..how about we head downstairs?" Draco decided.
Harry blinked, absolutely astonished at Umbridge's insults.
July 15th
"Or get you kicked out!" Pansy warned.
"Oh god, Pansy looks like she's about to tear Seamus' hair out! I'll be right back!" Hermione rushed back.
"Master Draco, Master Lucius told Beeve to tell you that lunch is served." Beeve, one of the house-elves said.
Harry was grateful that he got along with his sister, she barely put up with fights. Lisa takes an interest in cooking, and wants to do it professionally. Harry and his parents support Lisa's passion, and that's what made his family great.
"Of course you'd find it ridiculous.." Hermione huffed.
"Wow congratulations." Pansy deadpanned.
"Cool, do you two know each other already?" Ron wondered.
"You're so pathetic, no wonder you're in Hufflepuff!" Theodore shoved him back.
"Uh..I uh, caught them about to kiss the other day-" Neville spoke.
"I'm Reina Jones your house prefect, welcome to Hufflepuff! Please follow me, as I will escort you to our common room!" Reina instructed.
I liked the book you wrote with Lovegood too, it deserved the high demand.
"No! I like it! I mean, uh, it's nice..but you've just never been this close to me before, you don't need to apologize." Draco assured.
"Or put your own phone number in." Pansy smiled.
"Mhm..Draco, are you done with your food? We have a lot of shopping to do." Lucius asked.
"If that's true, I reckon there's gonna be a fight.." Hermione sighed.
Including the debate he was having about Draco possibly visiting him..he missed Draco, really, really, bad.
Harry entered the room, closing the door on his way in.
"Do I look sad?" Harry frowned.
"It's the color raven actually..he's my personal robot, Harry." Draco motioned.
"It's a castle! Draco, you can be the person who saves everyone from danger!" Harry thought.
"Did you get a head concussion??? Since when have you looked at my eyes?" Draco gaped.
"I'm not using that." Harry huffed.
"Right, sorry." Harry turned.
"Harry." Harry replied.
"Why can't you fix his hair here?" Draco wondered.
"No- just check your email!" Pansy directed.
"Yes, can I call you that?" Draco asked.
"You're the wizard who has a robot! I heard other students talking about it." Hermione realized.
"Cause I didn't bring anything." Draco shrugged.
Maybe
What if he never found Hermione?? What if she was alone and got kidnapped? What if someone kidnapped him?!
"I can sense it, you are extremely concerned over Harry Potter's loss in contact." Luna thought.
I hope you know I ripped all of your books I bought on my own!
"The decent-looking Weasley is here, got that..Mister Potter, wish you were expelled instead..Malfoy, your father isn't happy I assume..hey, where's Lovegood?!" Umbridge wondered.
"Sorry Dray, but a robot?? I understand that he looks un malfoy-like, but he clearly doesn't pass as a robot." Pansy snorted.
"Good story, like I buy that for a second." Draco scoffed.
"I love you." Harry whispered.
"What is?" Harry asked.
"Calm down, it's just a nickname, right Dray?" Pansy reassured.
"Right, thanks..I'm Ron by the way, Ron Weasley." Ron introduced.
"I'm not sure why it happened...I didn't mean to make you look bad." Harry defended.
"No..maybe I should just call her." Harry decides.
Bit of a short chapter, next one will be longer :)
"Pretty good, you?" Harry replied.
"Draco, why were they here??" Narcissa asks.
"You're our best friend, you need to tell us!" Pansy insisted.
Draco's first potions class goes simple enough, however, the tension escalates between his robot and Theodore during their flying lesson. Later that following night, Draco gets a letter from his father.
"Hm, sees you caught Malfoy's eye." Pansy winked.
"Sorry p-professor Snape." Neville turned a bright red.
"Please take a seat." McGonagall instructed.
"No, I did it to myself..but I didn't wanna." Harry grimaces.
"I was gonna show the office he was using, I forgot I had them.." Hermione groaned.
P.S. We should be together too :)
Severus directed the subject, "I have a potion boiling, watch closely at my demonstration.."
"In Umbridge's office, where is Ginny and Hermione?" Luna asked.
Sure, Pansy tends to compliment Draco constantly, but it doesn't feel the same..
"I don't know, wanna bet on it?" Pansy challenged.
"Well, I guess a hurt elbow made us friends..maybe I appreciate this bloody window." Harry laughs.
But she doesn't know you like I do Potter, no one does.
"Just sod off, Malfoy..no wonder you haven't had a girlfriend since the age of 15." Ginny widened her eyes.
"Are you weird about touching?" Ginny questioned.
Draco rubbed his chin immediately, now that was another embarrassing moment to add on his list.
"Why?" Harry snorted, following Draco anyways.
Grade: High School
"Hopefully Hermione responds.." Harry sighed.
"Stop!" Hermione tried to say.
"He shouldn't have called you that." Harry shook his head.
"Sorry." Harry stood up.
"I wouldn't know..we hardly see each other. I know, it makes me sound like I abandoned my own mother-" Draco admitted.
"Why?" Draco asked curiously.
"You should be honest, it's good for you." Luna informed.
The blonde boy held something in his other hand, which Harry soon found it to be a bandage. Harry watched as the boy gently placed it on Harry's wounded elbow, the gesture meant a lot to him.
"Sorry- I wasn't being serious with the nickname." Planter P chuckled.
"Is Pansy still awake?" Harry asked.
"Go away." Draco said.
"Oh yes, it is, good job." Draco clapped.
"Draco, you deserve a cup of tea." Harry scooted the steaming liquid towards him.
Harry looked at his elbow, and sure shit, he was bleeding.
"Online friend??" Draco questioned.
"You're a great robot, who would do that to you??" Draco frowned.
"Girls." Ron rolled his eyes dramatically.
"Yes." Draco nodded.
"I know, Dray!" Harry picked.
"You will not." Pansy objected.
"You know this isn't sex ed?" Hermione spoke up.
"You hug your mom." Harry insisted.
"How come you're so nice to me?" Draco asks.
"Draco, you know how to make me so happy..I've never met someone as lovely as you." Harry declared.
"Is it bad for Harry to digest food and water?" Draco wondered.
"I'm pretty sure it wouldn't come as a surprise to most people, it honestly makes me laugh when people ask if I'm dating my best friend." Draco chuckled.
Umbridge's door isn't staying open, Hermione's dad is the school janitor, Ginny starts to question things, Draco is acting more human, Luna suggests to read everyone's palms, but Harry has scars on his.
"Great, now get this! Every year my parents host me a birthday party, they invite my pureblood friends, and we do whatever I please..but this year they won't! Can you believe how unfair that is?" Draco ranted.
"Sorry! Old habit!" Pansy apologized.
"You should come over to my house." Ginny spoke up.
It wasn't just due to him being anonymous, the feelings were more than that. Draco fooled around with Adrian Pucey, Terry Boot, but it was just sex, no pure romance.
"Ca-r." Harry winced.
"How it h-happened is a h-heavy story..I wanna tell you, but I can't say it all over the phone."
"You're into girls?? Oh." Draco collected.
Harry moved towards Draco so they would sit together side by side. Harry felt rather brave today, and couldn't help but wrap his arms around Draco's one arm.
And he hadn't ever thought loving somebody could hurt quite like this. Like a sickening pluck at the strings of his heart, all tender as a bruise.
Later, by the floor of the bed, they sit together, Draco's stack of letters piled up in his old box. He's reading them, an odd, unfathomable frown on his face all throughout. Harry's touching his shoulder against his bicep reassuringly.
Harry looked up to find Timothy. He had his hand held out.
By the time they got to Dubai, they were spending relatively less time going to many places, due to the fatigue taking Draco faster, and the headaches that were at times so severe that they left him too sensitive to noise and light. When they could, they went to the very top of the Burj Khalifa, which was so high that the small stars in the sky illusively seemed aligned at their eye-level. Below, they could just hardly see the dancing fountains, the coloured beams. All of the city stretched out ahead of them like golden and blue and white pinpoints of light, lines of blurry golden roads, the dark shapes of architecture.
Draco is, as of now, leaning sideways on an armchair as he waits the crowd of people out. All long legs crossed over the knee of the other, the cuff of sleeve at one wrist resting on the arm of the chair, the other hand curled loosely at his jaw. His fingers are flexing in thought, thumb running over the pads of his fingers.
The city lights twinkled in the distance, reflecting on the shimmer of water, like there was a thin layer of glass over the surface. A breeze swept through the two of them, playing up Harry's curls and making them wilder and in his face, strands of white-blond dancing light against Draco's cheek, in his eyes, until he brushed them back behind his ears again.
Over Teddy's curls, Harry could see Ron spinning Hermione under her arm, grinning broadly, and Ginny and Luna dancing, the two of them standing very close. Ginny's hands were on the curve of Luna's back, and she seemed to be laughing a little too much as she talked to her, her freckled face flushed with delight, her eyes roving over Luna's face, whose arms were around Ginny's neck. Draco was on the couch with a drink, engrossed in conversation with Andromeda.
be affected by a
The smell of smoke and wood was high in the air. In the warmth of inebriation, and the way everything looked as bright as it did hazy, Harry found himself transfixed by the firelights casting itself over Draco where he stood. It was strangely serene and lovely, with the body of the violin tucked under his chin — arm relaxed high, his bow poised over the string, and the way he moved it slow, tender to the point of melancholy.
They watched Luna sidle up against Ginny, laying her head on her shoulder, George carrying Teddy on his shoulders to stand at the doorway of the kitchen, where a muffled conversation was taking place.
Harry laughs. "No. Just you."
It was when Harry had laid down next to him, shifting under covers, that he heard, softly, "My love."
His gaze dropped, following the line of Malfoy's throat, the fine skin there. Need pulsed at the pit of his gut, pulled in his chest, somewhere deeper. Shame drove it the other way, sick and tight.
Harry scoffed, shaking his head, but didn't reply.
Harry glanced at him over the canvas. "What's what?"
All his joy and good and comfort.
and Harry tells him it is, but he doesn't know how comforting it is to hear that when his dreams were more real than reality itself.
Harry didn't know what the uncertain tone meant. He was then fumbling single-handedly through the medicine bag, not budging the other hand from Draco, trying not to be frantic. The painkiller potion came into hand, and he put it to Draco's grip, his own remaining there as Draco opened it with trembling hands and drank it down until Harry stopped him with a hand to his wrist.
He halted at the door, and his eyes found Draco first, examining him with a frantic mind, roving over his body language.
Draco hummed. Another beat. A quick glance again. "And you?"
scouring the entire ground floor, which was enough time for the announcement—or rather, warning—of a visit.
There was one that he stopped and stared at, for the longest time.
Draco had gone to the Manor before they arrived, announcing that he would be back in an hour. He was never there when any of Harry's friends were around, and it was only after Hermione told him about the apology letters she, Ron and Dean had received, and showed him her own, that Harry learned it was out of respect, trying to keep himself out of the way of those he wronged.
"Harry!" Hermione said, upon seeing him, grinning. She shook a loose strand of curly hair out of her face, escaped from a messy, slightly damp bun on the back of her head. Ron saw him and smiled too, tossing a cheerful
Sometimes Draco would take a step towards him, and Harry would turn and leave, not entirely certain why. Only that something keeps him rooted back, an intangible sort of tension, like trying to break through a thick, rubbery film of resistance and confusion in his mind, like if he went to him, he wouldn't know how to act around him. And yet, a need, a desire to be with him again brimming just behind it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well. What about you?"
"Luna?" Harry asked, surprised. Draco glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. "You and Luna are friends?"
happened, but not much the memory or moment itself. Not in detail, anyhow, more in a blur of facts.
"Could you owl to him, then? Tell him I'm looking for him?"
me with a mullet and some leather pants. Don't you think I'd look good?"
For an act, it was the easiest thing, to hold his arm out for him, and smile broadly at him, and have him move up next to him, sidle up against his side. He was watching Draco hook his arm through it, touch Harry's bicep with a hand, smiling a little back.
"I don't remember it," Draco tells him. A corner of his mouth turns up, though it quivers. "I don't even remember what they look like. Or their names. Anything about it. They're gone forever."
It was annoying, all these people speaking about Harry's personal life. Hell, even about
A few couples were swaying together at the open space by the piano, and there was a man sitting there at the stool, singing along to the soft melody playing to his fingers.
In the silence, in which the man at the piano sang on to fill it, Draco looked much too solemn, his mouth small, a faint line between his brows. He seemed very lost in the haze of his thoughts, gaze distant over Harry's shoulder. They were moving in the small steps of a dance, feet a little unsteady and out of sync sometimes, when they swayed and ended up leaning a little too much into each other.
Draco strokes a hand over his hair. "Go back to sleep."
across between them.
"Harry?" Bill sounded concerned. "Are you alright?"
"Do you like dancing?" Potter asks, voice a bit croaky, putting a hand on Draco's thigh.
"It was like being homesick," Draco says, finally, when it comes to him. He shrugs, a slight bounce of his shoulders. "Only there was nowhere to go back to."
Draco looked deeply alarmed, seeing him begin to weep again out of nowhere, and Harry laughed, tremulous, shaking his head, taking his wrist and kissing the inside of it. Draco smoothed a thumb over his cheek with that same hand, even as he was bemused.  "Sorry. Nothing. I just
Then Draco was making his way towards him, throwing the coat over his arm aside half-way through.
"Fine, nice to meet you robot." Theodore huffed.
"Yes." Draco confirmed.
They all walked out the exit door, forgetting Umbridge's complaints.
"Don't live under a rock, yes they are! I bet Longbottom has realized, I tried asking him and he totally ran away like I insulted his birth or something." Pansy insisted.
"I'm Justin..who's the brown-haired bloke behind you?" Justin asked.
"Right." Ron nodded unsurely.
Harry climbed into the empty bed, a smile written on this face.
"I don't really hug people that often..sorry if I'm bad at it." Draco sighed.
"It simply wasn't fair, you always throw me a party!" Draco complained.
"That was brave kid, we wanted to invite you and your parents for brunch next week?" Arthur Weasley offered.
"He's so daft, why did he cover for me?? I have a pocket-knife, I could've defended myself." Draco shook his head.
"I've been hinting at a matchmaking possibility." Pansy smirked.
Time: School Dance
"Hi." Daphne waved back shyly.
"Father, can you fix it?" Draco asks.
"If it helps, I got detention for taping Colin Creevey to the lockers.." Harry admitted.
"It would make your birthday worse..that cannot happen." Harry determined.
"Your hair is complete!" Ginny declared.
"You know, I don't really think so." Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly.
"Beeve will take Master Draco's friends home! Draco's friends please follow Beeve!" Beeve escorted.
"Can you speak?" Draco asks.
"Oh, yes!" Draco nodded, switching phones with one another.
"Once poor, always poor." Umbridge claimed.
"He's a stalker, or more like, fancies you." Harry claimed.
Honestly, I'm just like you in a way.
"You're jealous?" Draco assumed.
"I'll introduce you to my pet snake, follow me." Draco stood up, navigating Harry to his room.
"I can give you a few pointers, it's nothing too in depth..just make it seem real if that makes any sense? Honestly, nobody knows that we're together, and we'd like to keep it that way for as long as possible..so please don't tell your friends about this?" Draco hoped.
"Shut up." Draco put a hand over her mouth.
"I'll convince you." Harry determined, looking right into Draco's eyes.
"Hurts a little." Harry said.
"What does it sound like stupid?" Pansy snorted.
"But things are just now getting heated!" Pansy observed.
"You're looking red in the face.." Luna appeared, sitting down in the back row.
"...I mean, it makes me a bit sad that you cuddled with another bloke, but if you really are sorry.." qt trailed off.
"He is?" Harry perked.
"Ah, and Malfoy..the one who locked me in my office. And quit gaping like a fish Potter!" Umbridge accused.
"I'm coming back in." Draco opened the door.
Draco was kissing qt, waiting for any sort of signal or indication that he should continue or stop.
The food appeared in front of them, wonderful scents filling the nostrils.
"No, just do as I say." Lucius instructed.
Draco blinked in annoyance, why was Theodore so uptight?
"Hermione, let's face it. Studying with you is like us studying for a final exam- oh shit there's Weaslette!" Pansy noticed.
"He can have one meal a day, no drinks though..too much water can damage his system." Draco explained.
"I understand, but I'm here for you." Hermione promised.
"I'm stupid." Draco slaps himself.
"I- well, I mean..I do too." Draco flushed.
Time: Hospital
"Harry, go back to class..I'll be there in a few minutes." Draco repeated.
"Eavesdropping is not a good idea." Hermione warned.
"Then I won't be the only student at Hogwarts with a personal robot.." Draco huffed.
"Yes, we'll be in the office.." Lucius leaves the room.
"Wonder how long it'll take for her to get out." Draco laughs.
"Sure." Draco nodded.
Great, Harry scoffed. Now he'll need to wait even longer for an email back from Sky.
Draco let out a sigh in relief, "I'm so happy you aren't mad.."
"Yay!" Harry patted his back encouragingly.
"You should be sorry for covering me, I could've handled it." Draco insisted.
"Well yes, I am his caregiver after all." Draco nodded.
"Harry, I'm the first Malfoy in Hufflepuff, it'll disappoint my father and our name!" Draco worried.
"My parents got me my own personal robot!" Draco hid a grin.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He didn't say your name." Ron retorted.
"So you'll go to the dance with me?" Harry felt a smile tug at his lips.
"Last match of the year, let's make it count!" Oliver prepped.
"You know I despise liars..I have the pencil in my office." Umbridge reminded.
"You literally said, "You can't go asking others about personal information-" Pansy objected.
"I know." Draco pushed Harry into one of the empty seats, which Harry assumed was for a quick kiss but instead it hurt rather than anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why is my door shut?!" Umbridge screeched.
"Oh..I'm not mad you know. I'm kinda sad, because I wanted to go with you..but it's ok, I'm happy to still be celebrating Christmas with you." Harry smiled sadly.
Draco shot awake at the sound of his laptop beaming, as tired as he was..he reached for it quickly and soon winced at the bright light.
"You'd be surprised." Harry muttered.
Draco had viewed his previous email to Planter P, who still had yet to respond. Draco would be lying if he told someone he didn't enjoy the emailing. He actually really liked the fellow wizard. Draco wasn't necessarily keen on figuring out who it was, he didn't wanna find out and somehow regret anything..most importantly, he didn't want the planting wizard to end up hating him. Not many people liked Draco, and it was a bit saddening to think about his online friend disliking what he saw.
"I have 6 older brothers." Ginny stated.
"Would you like me to do it?" Harry offered.
"They are??" Harry's eyes widen.
"No. I don't know why it was so heavy.." Harry defended.
"You gave him drugs, how much?!" Draco asked.
"Is something wrong?" Neville asked.
"No, he's my personal robot..he goes everywhere with me." Draco explained.
"Exactly my point." Umbridge sneered, walking back into her office.
"We'll leave it at that." Hermione decided.
"I might skip the whole thing." Draco differed.
Harry entered the boys locker room, he knew Theodore and Draco were in there somewhere. If they wanted to skip lacrosse practice, they should've at least let him join.
"It doesn't matter..it's just a school dance filled with sweaty middle schoolers." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Too last minute Dray, who invites guests the day of the party?" Pansy ridiculed.
"You adopted a son for the family???" Draco gaped.
"B-boyfriend??? You m-mean qt- I mean, Planter P?" Draco stuttered.
Draco did date a bloke once, Theodore Nott..and he truly liked him.
"What will it be for?" Hermione asked.
"Bye." Harry waved hesitantly, walking outside to the bus.
"Pansy! What the hell, that makes me look like a 10 year old?! What if this person finds my place when it opens and totally digs at it!" Draco scolded.
"I never really met another robot, I can't be sure.." Harry shrugged.
"I do think she is nicer to me than most, but we don't know each other well." Luna thought.
"It's a private thing, he didn't want me to tell anyone.." Harry shrugged.
"Sure, let me help you." Draco opened the passenger door, grabbing a crutch.
In the end, Harry didn't even bother to stop and think of a way out..
"Wait, how can he eat if he's a robot?" Pansy wondered.
"That's not the point! Pansy's right-" Harry agreed.
"Pansy's the one who told me they were, she finds out everything." Harry replied.
"I'll have you know I'm not stubborn, I'll accept my fate." Hermione sighed.
"That won't happen." Draco insisted.
"She wants us to be quiet, yet when we are she thinks we're up to something? This woman drives me mad.." Ginny complained.
"I love you too, I'm sorry." Draco apologized.
Harry couldn't describe the sinking feeling in his chest..but it was enough for him to run out of the locker room immediately. He didn't even care if the two noticed he was in there, all he cared about was the repeating image of Draco being kissed by Theodore.
"I meant it, I want to be your friend." Harry hoped.
"Thanks for noticing." Draco flushed.
"Fine." Draco agreed.
"What a smart robot you are, of course I do!" Draco praised.
"Great, see you around Draco!" Ginny leaves.
"No! I can hear your complaints from my office, that's enough! What would your mother say?" Umbridge wondered.
"Y-yeah." Draco stuttered. Harry couldn't help but look at Draco in concern, he's never stuttered in front of him before..maybe he was too close.
In case some of you are unaware, I am from America and don't originate with a UK background..therefore the accents and terms may not be as accurate.
"I don't know..I shouldn't have. I would listen to you over him any day." Harry sighed.
Draco returns home after spending two weeks out of the UK, he decides to pay Luna Lovegood a visit, and a favor as well.
"Yes, she mentioned that when we first became friends..she told me it was about Zacharias and drama with her ex-girlfriend, but she doesn't like talking about it..I mean, who would?" Harry said.
Draco entered the room, a interior of yellow and black.
"This is the common room! To the right is our stairs that lead to the boy's and the left stairs lead up to the girls! All your luggage is up in your dorms, if you have any questions feel free to ask me, the other prefects, or even Professor Sprout!" Reina explained.
"It's my first time at a concert too." The blonde boy related.
"What else would you use it for? Throwing it at Harry?" Hermione guessed.
"Before I go, I wanted to say sorry..for how obnoxious I acted when I had the drugs in my system." Harry laughs.
"How come?" Harry asked.
"I hope it doesn't make you mad..but during lacrosse practice, I went to go see what you and Nott were doing..because, I noticed you guys left and I figured you guys were skipping or something..but I uh, I saw Nott standing in front of you, shirtless...he kissed you, and I got upset." Harry began.
"That's...nice." Lucius commented.
"If you want to know, I've been hearing rumors about Dean shagging Seamus!" Ginny revealed.
"I might be thinking a bit crazy because you're attractive..but yes, I think you were meant to be here." Draco's eyes locked with his. Harry didn't respond to this right away, and instead took a moment to really look at the blonde beside him. Harry must've been getting dehydrated, because he now couldn't stop thinking that Draco was the most attractive person ever.
Arranging in the order from Pansy, Luna, Hermione, Ronald, Draco, and Harry.
Harry barged in front of Ron, knocking him away as number 13's stick collided right into Harry's face.
"Aunt and uncle always said I didn't belong at an event like this..maybe they were right." Harry sighed
"Oh, nothing..Pansy and I used to be friends is all." Draco shrugged.
"Quiet, Potter!" Umbridge yelled from her office.
"You stare at Harry and Ginny, do you like the both of them?" Hermione asked.
Draco stopped by at Luna Lovegood's home, knocking on her door with a potted plant in his hand.
"I said he was, but I was just joking with him..he has a girlfriend, he can't have romantic feelings for guys." Draco explained.
"Your mother and I went to this school, we found each other..I have no doubt you'll get along with the others." James patted his back.
"Hermione and I were trying to head back to our table, but of course I got knocked into..twice." Harry explained.
"Tea." Harry ordered, giving her some galleons.
"Too many people, right? I almost didn't come tonight, but Pansy forced me..I'm Draco." Draco introduced.
"There you are, I fixed it. Although, I think your hair always looks good.." Harry smiled.
"I do, but I like you the most..these past few months have been the happiest moments of my life." Harry poked Draco's right cheek.
"Happy birthday." Harry wished.
"You're too kind, really.." Draco flushed.
"Oh, so a secret relationship?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Alright. Harry, claim the bed next to mine." Draco instructed.
"Then I'll stand on top of this chair and scream her name!" Draco planned.
"What happened?" qt asked.
"Clammy hands?" Draco guessed.
"Draco is nice, my birthday has never been this good." Harry shared.
"He's just trying to annoy you, ignore it." Ginny advised.
"And? She likes Harry." Ron stated.
"I didn't say where we were going at all." Pansy scoffed.
"Mind if we sit with you both?" Pansy asked.
"Harry? I told you not to wait." Draco sighed.
Currently, they were laying on top of a grassy hill.
That's how he knew qt was different from his past lovers, just the simplest touch made him feel so content.
"We won't throw anything." Hermione promised.
They finally entered the common room, and Draco couldn't deny the place had a calm demeanor. It was sunny, full of grass and plants, it seemed cosy.
"Definitely! I honestly prefer his music over One Direction." Harry replied.
"Are you good at quidditch?" Harry wondered.
"Malfoy? Are you bloody drooling???" Ronald interrupted his thoughts.
"Yes, they were both sorted into Slytherin..actually, every Malfoy/Black that's still on our family tree has been sorted there. No doubt I'll be as well." Draco figured.
"I see.." Pansy nodded.
"No foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art the dispersion making, however for those select few who possess in the predisposition. I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death." Severus stated, his eyes beginning to gaze at Harry.
"It probably won't be your last." Draco jokes.
"Draco's right, it'd be kinda weird to go with your sister..no offense." Harry thought.
There were so many people, and the constant being nudged by random sweaty strangers didn't really sit with him well.
Yes, Draco was 11, but the routine stuck with him for years..
"He's my personal robot, of course we know each other." Draco claimed.
"Good..I'm happy you came." qt says.
"You look like Malfoy, who's a boy! If you want your hair short, at least have it look good." Umbridge scoffed.
"No." Harry shook his head.
"I'm sure it's just bad luck." Pansy assumed.
When you heard of Harry Potter, most people at Hogwarts High would recall that he was the junior who had a small circle and did theater.
a pothead stan.
"Fine, follow me, but be quiet!" Draco demanded.
"You bake?" Harry wondered.
"Not becoming friends my ass! Now, I better head on out to meet Hermione and Harry at the pub! I'll see you later." Pansy left.
"I think he's cool." Goyle admired.
"I'm good, thanks." Harry denied.
"Just stop talking..you know I love you, Dray. I wouldn't say all these things about you if they weren't true." Harry spoke a bit slowly.
"Harry's first concert is Harry Styles, quite fitting." Draco jokes.
"Maybe get out of the way." He glared at Harry.
"You 5 should sleep, I will stay awake..do not worry." Luna offered.
"You're Neville! It's good that you found him!" Harry realized.
"Thank you." Harry takes his phone.
"Enough learning, this is a flying class!" Ron approached.
"Yeah, uh are you a wizard?" Blaise asks.
"No, wait..Potter, are these scars?" Draco observed.
"Ouch." Harry pulled back.
Draco blinked furiously, who in the right mind would invade someone's home, and on top of that..who the hell would kill a plant so meaningful!? Draco tried to calm down, but with his consciousness still a bit dead, he couldn't contain it very well.
"Harry." Harry replied.
Draco almost fell out of his chair, qt just sent him a heart!! Draco felt like such a softie, he was 23 not 13.
"Yes, and I don't have a clue on how father managed it." Draco confirmed.
"Not causing any trouble." Harry stated.
"I can't move." Draco claimed.
Draco casted a voice charm, waiting anxiously for the it to turn 3:20.
"Hey, you gonna eat those fries?" Draco broke his gaze.
He wanted to see him.
"No..I'm gonna read the bedtime story for you." Harry decided.
"Sure, it's bad luck..but I don't really belong here. Let alone looking at Harry Styles.." Harry frowned.
Grade: 3rd Grade
"I was worried about you too." Draco returned the hug.
"Sorry, I know you aren't used to muggle jokes..It was clever though, you were gonna continue calling me that." Planter P smirked.
"I told you to stop calling me that, and honest he's a literal robot!" Draco groaned.
"It's hard to understand..I was in a car accident with my parents when I was little, m-my mom died, and I, along with my dad lived..he was struggling, and couldn't take care of me for most of my childhood. I had to stay with my aunt and uncle for over 10 years, but they hated me. My cousin, Dudley, had two bedrooms, while I was left with a cupboard to live in..when I finally moved in with my dad, he was always trying to get me above everyone. He's always pushing me into relationships, and especially lacrosse. Now for the relevant part..my dad told me to tape up Creevey. That's why I'm in detention." Harry revealed.
Harry lay'd his head onto the table, not wanting to be involved with this fight even more.
"You're talking.." Hermione whispered.
"No, it was nothing..go ahead Harry, catch up with us later?" Hermione nudged.
