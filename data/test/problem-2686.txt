fighting down his unease.Hari was actually quite adapt at cleaning charms after weeks of trial and error, cleaning up Grimmauld place so it was suitable for the Malfoy’s to move in. Other than the ground floor, every room in the house was suitable for use. Although the furniture and decor were dated, Andromeda ensured Hari, the antiquity spoke of the Black’s affluent lifestyle.
Hari hesitated only a second before he discretely took out his wand and tapped the table three times, muttering “
Hari appeared to struggle with something. “I want more out of life, than to struggle to survive. Maybe I gave up once, or maybe I just thought that was what I wanted, because someone said it was for the greater good.” Turning away from Draco, Hari kicked the kickstand up and rolled the bike into the shed. Saying all the while, “But you know something, Draco Malfoy? The world doesn’t end when we do. The same life problems still exist. We just wouldn’t be a part of the solution. I am no longer going to sacrifice my happiness for others. I am going to find it; my happiness, my light, my warmth, and I will hold onto it, by God or whatever deity you choose to pray to. And that sounds a bit selfish, yeah? But I gave, and they took, and they want more. Well fuck them.”
"Er...no." Hari tentatively answered.
“It’s just Harry,” Harry instructed. “My godfather, Sirius Black was the last male decedent of the Black line. When he died without an heir, he willed it to me instead of letting it fall into the hands of his cousins, who are associated with Dark magic. But hang on, Asclepius? “You said you could bring Kreacher back, how?” Harry asked in a croaking hopeful voice.
Draco scoffed at that, but waved Hari down to him with a rueful smile and quick headshake. Yanking Hari easily off the broom and kissed him hard.

Narcissa straightened on a pleased laugh. Hari chuckled along. “All aunt Dorea did was use transfiguration to make the candles and sell those, without giving away the secret.''And so clapping her hand on Hari’s shoulder, led him back into the outer room.
“Sssseeeevvverus!” The dusty image of Dumbledore is advancing on Harry. Forgetting momentarily Moody's "constant vigilance," Harry let out a startled shout backing up against the closed door behind him, yet remembering to get his wand raised. With a selected curse Harry mentally kicked himself before he remembered how to deactivate the curse Moody put in place as a defense mechanism for Grimmauld Place.

A rattling was heard from the other side of the alley. Cursing and the sound of crashing glass could be heard. A finger rose to the boy's lips in a silent request for quiet. Draco was then lead to the opening of the alley. Whatever was behind them went quiet.
"I wa...want t...t...ed" Hari stuttered out at Draco's sudden closeness. Draco's gray eyes, reflecting silver pools surrounding dark pupils. Hypnotizing.
Hari looked close. “Sorry, Andra. They’re the same as usual.” Hari said disappointed.
“It’s a very similar technique to bringing portraits to life.” Draco said matter of factly.
"Potter, that's what dating is." He laughed in relief.
Cho looked absolutely a fright when she realized what Hari had said and it dawned on her that if Dudley was Hari's Muggle cousin, then Hari had just outed her as a witch.

He wanted to just stay collapsed and lay on the floor to rest, but it still wasn’t safe. The Bogart was still in residence. But those three spells which he used regularly on the run, often with a string of other spells, drained his magic severely, something that had never happened before. Completely getting rid of the Bogart would have to wait. Kneeling on the floor, and trying to muster as much concentration as possible, he quickly cast a locking charm, “
“How so?” He inquired with a slight tilt of the head.

“What’s your favorite colour, Draco?” Hari suddenly blurted out when they found a small food stand and sipped from plastic straws in an outdoor picnic table.
, Draco thought as he hesitantly stepped away from the door and closer to the counter.
The flames from the fireplace disappeared, but the green flame on the candle remained. Hari’s jaw dropped, but the others were unsurprised.
Some time had passed, they didn't talk after that, comfortable in each others silent  company. Andromeda brought tea out for the two of them, and settled down on the couch once more. From the bassinet next to them, Teddy began to fuss again. "Oh dear, it's time for him to eat and have a nappy change. Harry, love will you wait a moment while I tend to my grandson?" Jumping, startled by being called love, but finding he quite liked the endearment.
Hari gently came to a stop just inside the barrier. Shutting the engine down, Hari turned to Draco over his shoulder. “You’ve been quiet the whole trip here, Dray.  Did I drive too fast and you are feeling nauseous? Shite, you ate a lot today, and I was inconsiderate. I’m sorry.”

Andromeda then clapped her hands, the unexpected movement causing Hari to jump. “Good, we are ready.” Andromeda said, raising her voice to her sister, busily bouncing and rocking Teddy who giggled madly. When Narcissa came closer, she said sadly. “Teddy can’t make a sound.” Narcissa raised her eyebrow. Nodding her head she took out her holly wand and silently sent Teddy to a gentle slumber. Hari was upset but he held his tongue. It was better than a

No sooner had Draco set down the previous letter than the second owl, a stout western screech owl; grey with darker streaks all over, and tiny ear tufts, arrived with its own letter for Draco. The owl carried a black envelope bearing the golden emblem of the Bank of Gringotts, the Goblin chieftess cast in a circle and two stars book-ending it. The owl landed by Draco's forgotten tea cup, hooting insistently and raised its leg for Draco to take the letter tied to its leg. Having done its job, the owl snagged a piece of toast and took off.
Winston, the bouncer simply unhooked the velvet ropes and allowed Sheryl and her entourage to follow in her wake. Once through the entrance, Draco and the rest of the gang discovered that the club had three levels. The entrance opened out onto a narrow railed metal staircase that they could follow down into the mash pit of bodies dancing near the stage, or go up a level to private booths. On their level was the bar and a scattering of smaller intimate two or three people tables.
Hari vaguely recalled what happened next, the memory hazy and fleeting.

That Norwegian Ridgeback is going to grow to the size of the hut in a month. I got to do something about this. I can't write Mon Mère, Father reads all her mail. What can I do?
The final weeks of June brought many changes to the occupants of 12 Grimmauld Place, beginning with a flurry of owls. The morning began like any other, with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Draco sitting around the head of the table in the kitchen and Hari at the stove. Narcissa and Andromeda were easily sipping at their tea, chatting while Draco’s own tea sat in his hand going cold and untouched whilst he watched as Hari danced around the kitchen--literally.
Narcissa was still pacing, now biting at her thumbnail, “Okay, but can’t the Ministry just retrieve the stolen gold?”
Dear Journal,
True to Narcissa’s word, the house-elves vetted each owl; rather, Kreacher did this, as he insisted vehemently was his job. Instead of clambering for the recipient's attention, each of the three owls waited patiently in the pot and pan rack above the kitchen table.
If Harry had looked up, he would have seen an unusual sight. A big brown owl, with amber eyes watching from the roof. He glided behind the pair unnoticed and just as it was about to reach the boy on silent wings, a great big snake reached out from the shadows and swallowed the bird. The letter it carried landed on the dirty paveway and was quickly trampled on.
Aunt Petunia did not move a step forward, her fullward march frozen mid-step, face stuck in that awful position. Was she even breathing? Yes, he saw the slight rise and fall of her chest.
She thought grimily to herself.
Not really sleepy, Draco wandered over to the window facing the back garden, wondering if Hari was still out there or if he had gone to bathe and was in bed or not. Perching on the edge of the windowsill he left propped open from earlier, he was pleasantly surprised to see that he was still sorting out the mess they had made of the garden. An unfamiliar pang of guilt plucked his heart. He should have offered to help, but common sense told him that he would be useless down there. Content to just watch in secret, he swung his right leg up and bent it at the knee, while he let the other leg dangle off one side. He moved the curtain back further from the window, and draped one arm around his knees and rested his check upon it as he watched the dark haired figure work below.
“Oh, wouldn’t Hermione be happy then? I’d officially be a member of S.P.E.W…hic…I…I think I’m going to spew, actually.” With a horrified squeak, and quick reflexes, Kreacher was able to get Harry's head over a bucket, before he made a horrid mess of the antique desk.
Dudley squared his shoulders, "You're not going to make me jealous. She's dating me now and not Hari. Cho is a beautiful woman, smart and kind. She looked past my size and my character flaws and is currently working with me to improve myself." Dudley sneered at Draco. "Clearly she chose the better, man."
"Whose that bulking lad with them? Oh Hari doesn't look too happy. Oh, he's furious. Best go bail the savior out, shall we?" Blaise says clapping his shoulder once, before striding away seemingly without a care in the world. his stride was long and confident.
He tried to convince himself that was because of the shock of having Hari bloody Potter walking in on him bathing.
presumably worked better than a cold shower.
Harry Potter now sat at the base of the grand staircase clutching the lifeless form of his house-elf cruelly named Kreacher, and sobbed. He sobbed for the unfairness of his childhood, thinking of all the times he was beaten, or starved, or locked in his cupboard under the stairs. Worse of all he thought of all the times when he was ignored or neglected. There were times when Harry wanted to be alone, from the abuse of the Dursley’s, or away from his friends at Hogwarts. But it was worse when all he wanted was to be surrounded by people who loved him, cared for his wellbeing, and they were gone.
Embarrassed, Hari ducked his chin and mumbled, “I cast and unforgivable on her.”
"I have nothing against her. I don't know her." Hari relaxed and didn't even feel as his tail crept closer to the warmth between his thighs. "Though she did punch me in the nose."
"It is not our goals tonight to humiliates any of you. None here will laugh at you." Sheryl says alongside her sue-chief, partner in crime, and on again-off again, but mainly on again, lover. “Do you think we do it for laughs? As a joke?” Sheryl says raising an eyebrow in challenge.
Hari's brow furrowed in confusion. He’d mastered this spell in fourth year. He wasn't so distraught that his wand wouldn't work. He was just about to try again, when he heard a muffled voice, words indecipherable. “What?” he said, turning abruptly.
Andromeda sighed, "You want Teddy."
Narcissa raised her eyebrow, a move that was mirrored by her sister perfectly. She said, "Awe,
“Ha ha.” Hari said sulkingly. “I only memorized all that, because I rewrote that letter five times.”
what they felt like, pillowy soft and moist, the
If you looked passed the exterior, the heart of the area, the people, were open and welcoming to everyone. Which is why, Hari felt comfortable surrounded by the strange and weirdly beautiful people who frequented the area; although, Hari had to protest verbosely to a teasing Sheryl that he wasn’t gay each and every time he stepped through the door.
“I’ll see that you are.” Hari promised.
Hari too embarrassed over his admission didn’t look up, seeing the looks being exchanged around him.  “Yes. One moment he was a four-legged magical beast surrounded by stars and the next he was his usual pointy self.”
"Don't you dare give me that crap, Albus. Three letters! Three!" Minerva strode up to his desk and struck out her fingers in emphasis.
Hari was brushing his teeth just a vigorously as he washed his body, spraying toothpaste over the faucet and mirror. Draco would have been irked, if he wasn't still memorized by the sight of Hari nearly naked next to him. Gulping once, he trailed his eyes over one scar that stood in stark contrast against tanned skin as it went from right hip past his taut buttocks, and over the right outside thigh. Draco noted on a quickly muffled giggle that Hari's ass and thighs, what he could see of them from the barely concealing towel, were lily white in comparison to the rest of his body.
With a grunt, Winston hauled Justin out of the room and likely the club, but first calling the boys parents.
They both ended up laughing hysterically. And when Andromeda and Narcissa, holding Teddy, came out of the parlor, peered over the railing to the ground floor below to ask what was so funny. They only laughed harder at their inside joke. Hari continued the tour, including Narcissa this time, who still refused to give up her hold on the two month old baby.
When his vision finally cleared, he blinked again at the sight before him.
"I guess not." He said. Their was an ache in Draco's heart at that searching look. A look that he'd probably never truly know. And Hari was likely to take the knowledge to his death; again.
Was Harry living with them all this time? Were they abusing Harry Potter? Where they stealing his money How can I let this happen? I should get him away from them, before it's too late.
As a last ditch effort, Malfoy's only hope for completing the task was in trying to restore a Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirements in Hogwarts, linked to its twin in a shop in Knockturn Alley. The night of Dumbledore's death, Malfoy managed to repair the Vanishing Cabinet, letting Death Eaters into the castle. I was with Dumbledore that night, finishing an important mission off school grounds, when the Death Eaters broke in. Dumbledore had been mortally injured during this mission and most likely would have died either way, but I was there on the Astronomy Tower when Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore. Dumbledore was emploring Malfoy that he was not a murderer or an assassin, and to cease his foolhardiness, lower his wand and offered him sanctuary for him and his mother. Draco was lowering his wand when the rest of the Death Eaters showed up with Severus Snape in tow. Although Draco disarmed Dumbledore in the Astronomy Tower that night, it was Snape that cast the Killing Curse that ended Dumbledore's life. I watched in memories after the fact that Dumbledore had an accord with Snape. Dumbledore had been cursed by a ring of Voldemort's creation, with only a few months left to live anyway. Seeing as Snape was a spy for the Light, Dumbledore knew of the plot on his life and wanted Snape to kill him instead of Malfoy. Malfoy would have to live with his choices and there was no going back. He witnessed the death of Dumbledore and with it, watched as what he glimpsed his only hope die with him. He was then forced to flee the castle with the rest of the Death Eaters or risk capture or death. I saw Draco Malfoy on four other occasions after Dumbledore's death.

“Los Vegas?” Hari asked not really understanding the discussion, he often daydreamed in Church forced to go to keep up appearances. It was the one time Hari was actually allowed to wear an outfit that fit him. But Hari had heard the city in America referred to as Sin City by the older boys at his school. That question earned him a cuff on the back of his head.
Did Hari just take me to the gay district? He was astounded. First, Draco would never have dared set foot anywhere near the flamboyant neighborhood, despite himself being gay. His father would really have killed him first than admit his precious heir had no interest in the female persuasion. Now, the green eyed, raven haired boy next to him was another story. Second, Draco thought Hari was straight. But he brought him here, so…

"Marge, I have to go. I have a freak to deal with." She didn't wait for a reply just hung up and advanced towards that door. Each time the door swung back around to reveal her closer and closer with a mocking squeak of the door.
"M'not, yu'r wasted." Draco sulked as he finally caught the offensive drink that eluded his hand before. As he went to retract his hand, his night robe rolled back to reveal a white bandaged hand. Hari's gasp was the only warning he had before his hand was snatched up in painfully strong hands.
"Okay Kreacher, what's up? How do I get out of here?"
I have also started a new series in the HP fandom. Shameless self promotion:  Peculiar Harry Potter (He calls it magic). It's rated Mature for now :) it is a Drarry. It is not ABO or a creature fic. Prompt: What if Harry Potter discovered he was a wizard on his own, ran away from the Dursleys, was sorted into Slytherin, became friends with Draco Malfoy, and that friendship developed into something more?
Hari shivered. Actions. Draco had kissed him once before. When he first arrived, with his mother. His mother had kissed him on both cheeks and the lips in gratitude. Draco had done the same, but wiped his lips afterwards in disgust. He then avoided him for three days. And Hari couldn't help but remember all the cruel taunts in school over the years. Those were not the actions of a a person in love. Would reading Draco's Journal really solve the underlying issue?
Draco caught the stare and smirked. “Hari…” Blushing, Hari turned away.
Hari introduced Draco to bourbon. Draco introduced him to firewhiskey. Draco admired the smooth taste and slow burn of the Muggle whiskey. Hari appreciated the quick burn and spicy notes of firewhiskey.
“The Dark Mark was forced on him by his Aunt Bellatrix, and Voldemort; all whom lived in his home for three years. What else was a sixteen year old supposed to do? He came home from school after finding out his father had been arrested by Order members,
Harry needed to run, survive, and outlast the snatchers, Death Eaters, and Ministry of Magic under Death Eater Regime, so that they could finish the task Dumbledore left them, find and destroy the Horcruxes. Sometimes, Harry resented Dumbledore, he didn’t tell him so many things, lied to him about his parents death, the prophecy, that he was the last Horcrux. All of Harry’s life was a lie. Harry never felt like a hero or a savior that they made him out to be. He felt like a fraud but people worshiped and fawned over him.
"Ssssssh. If I remove my hand, will you scream?" Draco glared harder over the hand. An elbow was jammed into his throat making him gag. "Will you?" Draco nodded, before shaking his head in a negative affirmative to his answer. The pressure stayed on his throat for a moment longer, as green eyes narrowed into his. Nodding to himself, the boy released Draco.
Narcissa was once so impressed with the Malfoy Manor, she was to call home. It was a handsome manor house, brick walled, grand peaks, and two gardens fenced in with yew hedges, and a fountain that sounded like bells in the distance. The entrance to the Manor grounds was guarded by a wrought-iron gate closed off against outsiders. Beyond the gates, the diamond pained windows of the Manor glittered in the distance in pre-dusk light. The gates did not open as they approached, but dissolved into smoke and solidified behind them. Nineteen years later those very gates would hold her and her only son prisoner within a gilded cage.
With no one in the room with him, there was nothing holding him back; no
Narcissa didn't need to know the answer to that.
I am sorry for the delay in publishing this chapter. I looked up and it was over a year as the last chapter I published was 07/07/2019.
Leading the way back to the ground floor, Hari carest the banister and it came alive with a hissing greeting from Asclepius. Draco jumped back with a very unmanly yelp. Hari laughed as he hissed a greeting back at the carved snake that had become his mentor in healing the last couple weeks.
Hari thought desperately.
"May I sit with you? We could go through the journals together."
Harry was very overwhelmed. He didn't know what to expect. He had momentarily had a lapse in memory, when he offered to pay off Andromeda's loans in the wizarding world. Did he even have access to his own vault? What type of retribution would the goblins take for breaking into Gringotts, stealing an artifact, releasing a dragon from the lower levels, and destroying the ceiling.
“I’m not getting out of Azkaban, Mother, you are? I’m doing all this cooperating to get you a lighter sentence."
Fingers teased and coxed their way past the tight ring of muscles that made up his anal opening and made their way into Hari’s tight passage. One, then two, then three.
"Mum, who is it?" A equally wide boy as his mother was tall waddled into sight.
Stay awesome!
Draco glanced up at Hari, placing a hand over Hari’s own. “Don’t be. My father was long dead before he received the kiss.” Draco said with hard eyes that soften only for Hari. Draco ducked his head to kiss Hari’s knuckles.
Draco was eating a summer salad with mint leaves, strawberries, and blueberries. Hari had moved onto dry toasted pumpkin and squash seeds. Both boys argued over the difference between fruits and vegetables and whether carrots or potatoes were even considered either.
Hari felt the sleepy smile spread against his bare torso. "Gryffindor...a kiss. I want a kiss."
"It's a basic guide...oh you can't read it...here!" Draco fumbled for his wand and tapped the cover much like he'd tap the Marauder's Map. "sponsum et stirpis" He muttered the words in Latin.
That was it. Harry couldn't stay. Channeling his rage, he let it explode out of him, blasting the hinges off his cupboard. The revolving door of the kitchen squeaked as it swung back and forth from the wind caused by the blast, revealing his aunts petrified face.
"So let her." Draco said as he imagined Hari in a short Muggle black dress. Maybe something that showed off his shoulders.
Harry spun around fast on the bench, nearly tripping over his own legs as he scrambled over the bench to Kreacher’s side, collapsing at his feet, as uncontrolled sobs of remorse and relief racked his shoulders.
Tears began to prickle at the edges of his eyes, and he bit his lip to stop it from trembling.
From the floor he glared at his cousin, his glasses had been knocked askew, and he scraped his elbow on the cement flooring. He felt a warmth in the pit of his stomach, a serging of magic from his core, and radiating out like an invisible ray of light heading directly for the glass that the Boa Constrictor resided behind, and Dudley's nose smashed piglike against.
"Naw, this prissy cat, he owes me money. Broke my skateboard. Then Mad Dog was after us, so..."
Draco saw that with a little maneuvering and a bit of spell work, he and Hari could fit in there comfortably. Taking Teddy from Hari, he held one end of the hammock steady so Hari could settle in the swaying ropes. Then he handed over the content baby who stared up at the green leaves of the branches above.
The first owl to glide down was a silent winged barn owl with tawny wings, pale face, and empty black eyes. The letter it carried was cream coloured with purple inked letters. The black wax seal had an emblem stamped into it of an M with a wand proudly expelling light from the center.
"Shoot!" Panted Arlys, "The sign-in sheet for the first round has already been turned in! I wanted to be in the group who sang the opening number."
It was a nice retreat from the June heat inside the reptile exhibition.  cool and dark. All along the walls were lit windows showcasing snakes and lizards from all over the world and various colours and sizes. They crawled, hung, slithered, and hid behind, in front of, next to, on top of, and beneath various wood fixtures and rocks.
him.  Sirius was his godfather; best friend of his father James, and didn’t even know him. But Harry was his best friend’s son, and Sirius would take him in because James father Fleamont Potter, took Sirius in when he ran away from Grimmauld Place at sixteen. He was willing to take Harry in, no question asks. But then Peter Pettigrew escaped justice again, and Sirius had to remain a fugitive, and Harry had to stay with his abusive aunt, uncle and cousin. Then at the end of Fifth year, Harry fell for Voldemort’s trap, and Harry got Sirius killed when he left the protection of Grimmauld Place to rescue him.
Andromeda didn't say anything, she just briefly closed her eyes, then opened them on a snort and felt a wide wild smile grow on her face. She thought to herself, 'If I had to be indebted to someone, at least it's to someone unpredictable and definitely not boring, like Harry Potter.' Squeezing his shoulder once in silent support, leading him the rest of the way to the Head Clerks desk.
Hari laughed along with Draco. If that comment was made even a month ago, the world would have seen them rolling around on the floor in a true Muggle fist fight.
Could that be it? Could he channel his emotions and desires into a physical action?
“Well he agreed to go shopping for our date, so I’ll have the opportunity to, won’t I?” Draco sounded smug.
Mon Mère shares many secrets with me. She calls them Black secrets, and Black secrets are different from Malfoy secrets. This journal is a secret from Papa. Mon Mère  got it for me and other presents too. A multi-compartment trunk that also only opens to my blood and some books that Papa didn’t want me reading. They’re not even Dark Arts, just kid books, about the most powerful little boy in the whole wide world, Harry Potter. All the children my age wanted to read the colorful pages. Even some of the adults. But Papa said no and he never says no to what I want. I got really mad and yelled at him in front of his friends. Papa beat me with his cane in front of his friends. He says son must show their father respect. My back is bleeding. My head really hurts too. Papa refused to allow Mon Mère to fix it. He says let them be a reminder of my rudeness. That’s not the word Papa used, but Mom Mère says that’s what it means.
With a wry smile, Harry thought that would be easy, seeing as he is the last of the Potter's and as Petunia Dursley née Evans and her big fat pig of a son, and his cousin, Dudley wouldn't be able to find this place anyway.
They followed a trio of people down a flight of steps into the shopping center beside the abstract metal winged angel. All around, Draco gaped at multiple floors of shops made of tall glass framed in cold steal. Signs above each shop glowed with multicolored torch-less lights. Inside the shops was another world entirely. White faceless people posed motionless at odd angles advertising a wide array of clothes.  Glossy posters advertised merchandise inside. Draco could see through unobscured windows, Muggles as they congregated, talking among each other, sipping at strangely marked goblets made out of flimsy white material, or looking out into space talking to nobody with a metal square raised to the side of their faces. In their hands they held bags with labels of the shops they visited printed in weird typeface.
Potter moaned once and Draco mirrored the sound as his cock began to harden at the sight and sound of him lying helpless and unconscious at his feet. It wasn’t every day Draco had Potter right where he wanted him. Potter moaned again as he slowly stirred to consciousness, spurring Draco into quick action. Draco smirked mercilessly as he advanced on the unconscious boy of his fantasies, slowly loosening the Slytherin silver and emerald tie from around his neck. Kicking Potter’s wand further out of reach, Draco got on his knees, straddling Potter’s hips.

“Potter, that makes no sense at all. You can’t just accept any random horse, you don’t know if its diseased, not properly broken, the beast might be more trouble than it's worth.” Draco said exasperated.
A sound on the stairs had Draco swirling around. Hari was leaning against the banister, Asclepius twisting up to great him. His arms were crosses over his chest, messy hair gloriously tousled and eyes sparkled like green gems behind his glasses. He was wearing a raggedy red T-shirt, and ripped blue jeans, and white scuffed trainers.
"Alice, please call me Alice, Hari. Sheryl is the only one to get away with that name." The spikey haired girl replied.
“Massster asssksss where I am? Look around your head. I’m here.” And Harry looked at eye level to his left and was met with the wall. He turned his head to all around but no one was in the hall with him save the dead house-elf and portraits on the decaying walls.
"Hari, you have to understand. Families were dying out at an alarming rate with no male heirs to pass on the names anymore. Circe, with all the different fractions we have today, they still are and those that adapt so their family lines don't die out, are written off. In the case of the Black's; blasted off. Look, you've seen the
Hari’s eyes reflected his own sadness, to have never known any of his family. Hari remembered the Mirror of Erised and numerous nameless Potter’s that milled behind him in his reflection. Perhaps Dorea and Charlus were among them.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter.
Of all the things that Draco Malfoy loved about Hari bloody Potter, being an oblivious idiot was not one of them. But to honestly not know about the creature’s inheritance was almost blasphemy. After all it was a major part of the evolution of magical society. Draco took handfuls of his hair and pulled in frustration. His perfect hair now reflected the turmoil inside his head.
"Yes!" Andromeda threw herself at Harry, clutching the distraught boy close to her bosom, "Yes, Harry love, yes. Teddy and I will stay with you." She said on a happy cry herself.
landing would be Narcissa's bedroom as it was the largest bedroom with adjoined bathroom.This room use to be Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's room, but Hari was wise to never mention this to Narcissa afraid of her rejecting the room over a petty family feud. There was also two tiny bedrooms down this hall that use to be Fred and George's shared room, and Remus's. These rooms would too, be unoccupied.
"No, Pup, no. It's not wrong. Your emotions are never wrong." Sirius said. He looked at his godson, and wished things could be different. That he wasn't dead. That he wasn't just a portrait on the wall that Hari would sometimes talk to. He wished that he could step outside the frame and just hold his godson. Reassure him that everything was going to be okay. And just be there.
"Dragon! what happened? Let me see, mon petit."
"So sharp they could cut glass." Alice agreed. Draco inwardly preened at the compliments.
“Er...sorry to disturb you, I... ah didn’t wake you, did I?” Hari said, putting his hands in the pockets of his jumper and pulling down to cover the front of his crotch just in case. He was suddenly glad he took that cold shower.
Draco stood wide-eyed and disbelieving as he watched Potter slip in the spray of water, blood blossoming at his temple where it struck the floor, and his wand slipping out of limp fingers. ‘Potter, one of the greatest wizards of our time, brought down by a puddle of water. Un-fucking-believable! Draco now watched him momentarily hypnotized by the scene that played out before his eyes; Potter lying wet on the slick tile floor, legs slightly spread alluringly, and watched the gentle rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
After the second interruption, Draco rinsed off in the bath and went to the vanity mirror to apply some type of lotion to his skin. Hari’s vision had been blurry  without his glasses, but he remembered flashes of pale skin as Draco ran fingers over raised arms, chest, and neck.
So I laid in wait for them in a hidden nook outside the third-floor corridor. I do not know what is with the trio and midnight, but sure enough, half past I saw the locked door open on its own.
With a tightening of the lines around his mouth and a hard glint in his eyes, Harry Potter opened the gate and took the six steps up to the front door with only a silver snake knocker, doorbell, and no doorknob. The door opened ominously on its own into a dark hallway, which matched Harry’s mood perfectly.
Two completely irked, and flabbergasted Aurors ran up to them from the drive.“The Manor is on fire, how did this happen? What did you do?” The first arsehole of an Auror from earlier questioned accusingly. Narcissa scoffed.
Draco laughed, punching Blaise shoulder lightly. There was a beat of silence and then...
Draco turned back to Hari, who was taking another shot and set the glass back down. From the clutter of other shot glasses on the table, Draco couldn't tell if Hari had just the two, or if he had more.
Harry shed his Invisibility Cloak once he entered the bank. Andromeda stood by his side with Teddy in her arms.The hundreds of goblins working in the bank stopped what they were doing to stare.
correct?”
For a halted moment the too just sat in silence. Draco snorted a laugh.
A very good thing that loose tongues could easily be tied with a handy Tongue-Tying Curse. Problem solved-now anyone who is aware of the location couldn't speak of it, if they tried.
It was great to get away from everything he knew and see things unexpected. Even when Vernon was spitting venom at the strange and beautiful people across the street, Hari took no notice to it, having been subject to the verbal abuse for seven years now. “Don’t let me ever catch you over here, you hear me. Especially you Freak, this place just breeds freakiness and weirdo’s like you. Homo’s the lot of them. I’ll have you out by your ear before you could even say homosexual, boy.” Uncle Vernon had often gone on these rants that to a seven year old brain had no idea what he was talking about. “Unnatural if you ask me. The downfall of civilization, the Book of Genesis talks about them. You know what those cities are called, don’t you?”
Draco was exhilarated at the motion the motorbike made as it zipped and swerved around much larger cars. It was much like flying a broomstick, the steering, except instead of being high in the sky and only having to worry about a couple bludgers knocking them off their brooms, they were on the ground with thousands of other vehicles, too close for comfort. But Draco wasn’t scared, he felt oddly safe with his arms wrapped around the taunt muscles of Hair’s abdomen, this moment paralleled the terrifying fiendfyre chase in the Room of Requirements. Draco used the pretense of being scared to hold on tighter to Hari on the busy streets of London.
“I’ve rode on this thing several times,” wisely not mentioning nearly dying last summer riding sidecar, “and Sirius taught me how to ride the summer before fifth-year. It’s perfectly safe, I won’t let us crash.”
“You blackmailed the Ministry?” Draco asked in awe.
"I DO NOT LIKE WHAT YOU ARE INSINUATING, SIR!"
"I'll keep an eye out for the lad." The officer replied. "Try to get him help, before the true horrors of this world get to him. But I have a feeling he's already seen monsters made out of people."
Hari’s bedroom door was left ajar. Taking that as an invitation, he first peered inside the room before stepping bodily inside. It was empty. He huffed in annoyance. He honestly expected Hari that dunderhead to still be sorting out his room, unless he suddenly became very apt in using cleaning charms since sixth year. He supposed it wasn’t entirely out of the question. From what his Aunt Andromeda said, this place had gone to disrepair since his great aunts death, more than a decade past.
I have to dodge around that red headed weasel. Apparently, being a pure-blood means you know something about dragons. He barely knows anything. Maybe his brother might be a dragon wrangler but his younger sibling is not. You have to be more gentle with the scales. What type of brush have they been using?
Hari’s face was a tomato red. He had nearly forgotten how outspoken Sheryl could be. Being a prominent member of the resident gay neighborhood, she would often tease Hari about his sexual preferences and experiences. Hari never spoke of is one failed relationship with Cho Chang and didn’t intend to talk about his uncertain future relationship with Ginny Weasley. The truth of the matter was, Hari hadn’t given Ginny a second thought since returning home from the war. Dating was the last thing on his mind with the funerals, the trials, settling everyone into Grimmauld Place with him.  Now he wasn’t even sure if he was even ready to get back together with her.
Hari’s hips were tilted upward, and Draco settled easily between them. He felt something hard wedge against his anal opening. Instinctively he tensed.
"Asclepius's two daughters, Hygieia and Panacea. Hygieia is the snake that is carved into the tapestry in the Parlor. And Panacea is the snake carved into my bedroom door. There is also Ashur, on the entrance. But don't worry, they won't attack you...well...er...Ashur will if you enter the house uninvited, but don't worry, he won't attack you because you are invited into the home." Hari rushed to reassure Draco, who was still really pale from his earlier scare.
"Wicked!" Was all he said as he stepped out of the floo soot fireplace, now flameless like it was heatless; straightened his color and glasses in a centered and upright position, and walked out of the doors.
"Uh, I'm wearing contact lenses in my eyes." Hari explained with a vague wave of his hand near his face.
All he could think of at that moment was Sirius.
I think I can be true friends with Zabini.
In the kitchen he grabbed a beer and plopped his heavy weight down in his chair. twisting the cap before taking a swing, he looked at his wife with beady eyes.
Draco was shocked at The Hari Potter, the Saint Potter, and the Do-No-Wrong Golden Boy’s profanity.
"First thing you do, pup...snoop through that boy's diary before he wakes up and realized what a mistake he made handing it over so freely. Then you use it as blackmail..."
Draco was only half listening as they made their way to their seats. Sheryl shooed a couple out of a little alcove table that allowed nearly 360 degree view of the restaurant. Rather than sitting across from Hari with his back to the room, he opted to sit next to him instead. It was a tight fit and Hari gave Draco a strange look before turning back to Sheryl to continue the argument.
My whole life revolved around this war. The Cursed scar on my forehead a physical reminder of the burden placed on my shoulders at fifteen months old. The burden of being your Savior, being hidden away from the wizarding world, being hunted and targeted by Voldemort and his followers, and the burden of knowing that because of this scar I was the only one capable of defeating Voldemort once and for all.
Hagrid took that as his cue to leave the disgusting cookie cutter neighborhood. He pulled out a ruffled feathered tiny owl from one of his many pockets and searched for ink and paper.
Qualities that he once found infuriating now seemed endearing.
I am officially a Slytherin. Well, really there was no doubt that I wouldn't be. Can you imagine a Malfoy in Gryffindor or Cerce forbid, Hufflepuff? Slytherin's are ambitious, cunning, and resourceful. We are also not beyond using any means to achieve our goals. For the past six years Slytherins have won the House Cup.  I am not blind to the stigma against my house, but despite what other people think, we are not all evil. That's preposterous to think, that any eleven year old in Slytherin is doomed to be a Dark Wizard.
"Little Whinging, Surrey?"
It's been two weeks since the deaths of Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, and Collins Creevey, (The flash of creevey's camera would have been the only welcome paparazzi for Harry's state of mind) and all Harry Potter wanted to do was find somewhere quiet to grieve.
“Blessed be.” Hari acknowledged. Even as one binding broke, the golden binding remained on his arm,
“Pretty much...the Chieftess told me to write this statement, “The Goblins will not stand for theft and withholding of clientele’s gold entrusted in us, as such, Goblins Global Guild must remind you of the treaty of 1726, ‘No Witch or Wizard of the ilk represented in the elected offices of Magicks shall henceforth have any legal or authoritative powers over the contents in clientels vaults higher than the Chieftess herself, in penalty of this act shall have access to personnel vaults sealed, liquidated, and wealth distributed elsewhere at the pleasure of her greatness.’”
Draco's magic was a blinding white with black specs scattered throughout. Hari's own magic—a soft green glow—tentatively reached out to caress Draco's before getting to work healing the flayed forearm.
11 December 1991
When he finished the processes of tuning the piano, some two hours later, the sun had set completely and the gas lamps in the room were lit. His back ached, muscles were stiff, and his fingers were sore, from this grueling exercise. But he felt accomplished in finishing his task. For one; he spent two hours with his mind distracted instead of waiting for Kreacher to wake up, and two; he now could play the piano uninterrupted.
"I'm warning you, now, boi-ey, any funny business, any at-tal, and you'll see no meals for a week."
Harry's messy head of black hair and thick rimmed glasses peeked over the edge. It was a new person.
[(HBP:24:521-523 but from Draco’s POV) (what goes on outside his dream is in
His gorgeous blonde was nowhere to be seen. Instead, lounged against a swan chaise, a magnificent silver dragon glinted in the moonlight. The silver dragon raised it’s head to look at Hari with swirling eyes of opalescent colours.

"And if I win?"
Hari was taking Draco out to lunch at Sheryl’s Place, a popular barbeque restaurant which just so happened to be located within one of London’s notorious gaybourhoods. The area got its reputation from the large LGBTQ+ community and popular gay bar and nightclub that guarded the entrance against homophobic, xenophobic, and racist people like Hari’s own uncle Vernon. Sheryl Mason, the owner and head chef was a rather tall and intimidating black man in full drag, with a gleaming meat cleaver used to deter any negativity towards herself, her staff, customers, or her restaurant. Sheryl didn’t discriminate against anyone, race, gender, or sexual orientation.
Once dressed in
When they cleared the alley, Hari let the motorbike rev, enjoying Draco tightening his grip around his middle and sped on their way. The ride was short, probably could have walked the distance in quarter an hour or less, but nevertheless fast and exhilarating all the time. Draco was thoroughly lost, but Hari seemed to know where he was going.
"No. As if I'd give you another one of my journals. Once was enough. Thank you very much." He sniffed with his pompous head in the air.
Hissing came again, and Ashur hissed for Hari’s ears alone, ‘Bessst not to dally, massstersss.’
In the boy’s dormitory, they talked roguishly about sex, masterbation, and sex dreams often. He heard it from the upper years, both sexes in the quidditch locker room, and even his own year mates. Third and fourth year especially, Dean, Seamus, and Ron often tried to rope Hari into their discussion of their most elicit wank sessions or erotic fantasy. There always seemed to be something more pressing on Hari’s mind to worry about that school year than join a game of Shag-Marry-Kill, but mainly shag.
Hari didn't know what to make of it at first and then it clicked. He dislodged Draco's hand and leaned in close to hiss into Draco's ear, "Not in public."
Draco was mortified to be listening to this conversation as well. He hoped whatever gunk, goo, and powder Sheryl and Alice put on him hid his hot cheeks.
Despite the chill of the morning, and the grumbling of his stomach, Harry hesitated about following the man.
“Not at all, I was quite enjoying the kiss.” Draco’s hand fell back to land on a stray article of clothing. Draco looked down at it with a frown, then at the rest of Hari’s room.
Arlys who was standing behind Hari mumbled, "Oh Lordie, wouldn't that just be a shame to miss out on the tone deaf and squawking gaggle of geese." Arlys said sarcastically.
Hari looked anywhere but at those intense grey eyes. Deciding deceit was more than likely unacceptable, he decided on a half-truth. “Well, I...you...you were in it.”
Resigned, having no where else to go, he bowed his head under the flap. Lifting his head, his eyes widened and his mouth dropped.
Sweeping open a flap that must have been the door, Alleycat held it open. "Trust me, its a lot roomier on the inside." The boy said with a secretive grin.
Each of the black cabs pulled up and dropped off their passengers in front of a two story building with a grand sign of a rampant horse. The sign flashed blue for its body, and went dark when the mane and tail flashed a violent shade of neon red. An arched canvas cover shielded the entrance and bouncer from the drizzle of rain that wouldn't quit. The bouncer checked I.D's at the door and allowed customers and party goers through with a lazy wave and an unhooking of velvet ropes.
But, Sheryl found herself worrying for the young blonde. She always assumed Hari was asexual, if that was the case then Draco was setting himself up for heartbreak. She had to know his intentions.
Tapping his nose, as if he knew some great secret, Draco revealed his cards. “And how do you think your godson would react to those curious little…” He sucked air between his teeth, “sticky magazines I found throughout the parlour? Got a little lonely chasing your own tail, Padfoot?” Revealing he knew Sirius’s nickname. “Birds aren’t enough for you and you’ve got a bit of a thing for Poodles, do yah?” Draco mocked.
Draco interrupted. "It's a journal, okay? Not a diary, a journal!"
On the sixth of June, Narcissa Malfoy and her son, Draco with the aid off their two house-elves Dot and Kokoa, disapperated to Kings Cross Station, a day earlier than expected. They were hidden behind a glamour and Notice-Me-Not charm so the Muggles going about their early morning rush to work, wouldn't see them arrive. They and their luggage walked right out into Muggle London unnoticed. The ancestral home of the Black's was only a few short blocks and a twenty minute fast-footed walk from the station.
First a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon, named Norbert, and now a Cerberus named Fluffy. Hagrid (I finally remembered his name) is absolutely mad. When Harry jumped first down the trap door, I immediately ran back out of the corridor to get help.

Looking down between their bodies, Draco noticed a thin trail of dark blood drip down his own cock, another trail dripping down Potter’s thighs, adding yet another grotesque lubricant to Potter’s tight and resisting asshole. Potter was on his knees, chest touching the wet tile, head bowed over his tied wrists, wails and screams ripped from his throat. Draco also took note of the blood pooling from between his lips, ‘he must have bitten his tongue or the inside of his cheek, or something’.
And you pay enough attention to know I've been abused. Why are you so obsessed with me?" Hari half joked.
"STOP! FREEZE! DON'T MOVE!" He hallared louder than even he expected, his adrenaline high and air cracking with electricity.
"Oh, that might be a problem...I have to tell you something, pup."
“Sheryl…”
Hari didn’t hear Narcissa come up behind him. “I understand your apprehension, Corbeau, but blood-adoption is a very common thing in wizarding society.”
"He attacked my son, Marge and put your brother in jail. He is a delinquent freak and needs to be locked up for good. Can you arrange that?" She was saying. Harry was frozen with shock.
"Hey, I heard that." Arlys said indignant. "My parents say I have a lovely voice."
Harry Potter won! Gryffindor won. I am not happy about that. BUT HARRY WON!
Dumbledore tried for comforting. "Now is not the time for tears, we must find him."
"I am not lying! I have it written in my journal. I have the scars to prove it." Draco was incensed. He rose up, dropping Hari's legs from his lap, and began to strip, slapping Hari's hands away when he went to stop him. The marks of the caning was evident when he presented his posterior to Hari. Horizontal lines marked up his lower back, buttocks, and thighs.
Draco shivered at hearing the hissing noise come from Hari's mouth, a freakish reminder of the Dark Lord talking to the giant snake that was his familiar as he walked the halls of Malfoy Manor. Draco felt the walls close in on him, he couldn't breath, he felt trapped, no way out, the hissing was getting louder, louder, there was no air.
Any moment, he would wake before the pain. Like dreaming of falling from a great height, the dreamer always woke before impact.
Do you think the animal portrayed on each of the Founders house crest represents a Patronus or an animagus?
"What?" Draco said, "I don't know you. I would have been seven, eleven years ago. If I was incompetent, I would have thought you mistook me for my father; however, you said my given name and not my sur name."
'Twelve years in prison, sentenced to death, then stuck at 12 Grimmauld Place until his death, never a free man. 'What a cosmic joke' Harry thought.
Narcissa laughed, “why yes indeed. And I imagine you kneeled in front of the fireplace the whole time to better see and hear the person you are speaking with.” Narcissa had an amused glint in her eyes. “Quite an undignified position that puts one in. This way, no kneeling is required and you could sit comfortably anywhere to have the Floo conversation. And if you still wish to see the face of the person you are speaking with; all you need to do is the procedure in reverse, transplanting the flame back into another fireplace. The only downside is the inability to step through the flames in the new fireplace.”
A little sheepishly, Draco removed his feet which were entwined with Hari's legs and ceased the rubbing he was doing. At the same time, he removed the tip of his tail which had slowly made its way up Hari's leg to wrap around his muscular thigh.
Draco took a quick assessment of the barbeque restaurant. Sheryl’s Place was a lot more spacious than he initially thought. There was a bar with open kitchen where three staff was busy cooking over open flames, their backs to the customers. A dozen or so square tables were spread out evenly, with a few tables lining the windows. Hari and Draco were in the only alcove seating, a tight fit sitting side by side, but Draco felt safer facing the room and street at large. Sentiments that Hari obvious felt, because he didn’t move himself, or demand Draco do so instead. It was so much different than Draco have ever visited before. He decided he liked it.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
jinx, so you can't even talk about the name, least of all the address. It's also anti-muggle, and unplottable." Harry continued stepping back into the study.
12 Grimmauld Place is a full house with Andromeda and Teddy, Narcissa and Draco, and Hari living together. This is one bizarre family. Also, Draco's still in his pre-rut stages as it is his first rut. All he wants to do is lock himself in his room... with Hari, until it his pre-rut is through. Poor Draco!
Sputtering now, Sirius growled like a vigorous Grim, his animagus form was, “Why you insolent little…”
Kokoa hastily filled their cups with steaming-hot tea. Hari winced as the liquid burned his throat. Panting and fanning his tongue, Hari reached for a slice of apple on a plate in front of him hoping the cool juices would relieve some of the pain.
Hey! I'll have you know that I mastered that spell fourth year during the triwizard tournament." Hari said with some haughtiness.
Sheryl was loud, very loud. Draco couldn’t help but overhear what she said, and a dozen other patrons turned to face them, no doubt overheard the conversation as well. Draco fought down a blush and tried to act nonchalant, leaning back on the bike with arms crossed over chest, when the two turned to face him fully. His Malfoy mask was firmly in place, his facial featured carefully blank.  Hari was unsuccessful in doing the same. Clearly mortified, he squawked out a protest.
Sheryl was not happy that they were leaving. Hari was sobering enough now to quickly decline Sheryl's offer of calling a cab saying they already called one.
Hari starred in fascination. They were beautiful, and deadly.
It was C'iemone who answered. "Shortly after eight the first round Queens take the stage. The sign in sheet is available at the DJ booth. Throughout the night, there'll be say four or five rounds or sets, 5 slots per set, and only one slot per person or group. No repeats allowed.  Each singer is ranked first in their set between 1 and 5. First place gets a free tab for two and some kind of discount."
"Awe, Sorry Andromeda. I was going to sit down at write that letter to Kingsley, but what the goblin Chieftess said, got me wondering...so I found my birth certificate."
When Harry awoke sometime later, the sun was setting, and a breeze was ruffling the dust and Doxy-free curtains. Harry slowly stood up, looking around him. He could hear the sounds of birdsong over the sounds of normal day-to -day activities of Muggles returning home from work or going about their business.
Hesitantly and as quietly as possible he inched open the door, keeping a sharp ear out for the sound of his relatives awakening. He heard his uncles snores interrupted by a particularly loud snort, and then silence. Harry held his breath until he heard the snores resume. If he listened closer he could also hear the nasally snores of his aunt that sounded like the whiney of a horse. His cousin would be the hardest to hear. He didn't have a distinguishing breathing pattern while sleeping, yet. Instead of snoring or heavy breathing, he listened for the sound of squeaking floorboards overhead. Dudley would often get up in the middle of the night for midnight snacks, or to use the toilet. He listened closely for any signs of wakefulness. When he heard neither the sound of squeaky floorboards or the sound of the toilet flushing, he elected to wait ten more seconds. Just in case.
The evening went on, with Draco and Hari trading drink after drink. Both sure that they could drink the other under the table. They retired to the couch rather than the bar stools after their third, maybe fourth shot saw Draco nearly falling on his arse. Draco would not admit that happened. Least if they fell, it wouldn't be too far before their bums hit the ground. Or was Hari's reasoning, anyways.
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
“Hermione calls her Eliana.” Smiling ruefully, Hari continued. “Hi Eliana, I’m Hari.” Grinning cheekily over at Draco, he says,  “This blonde pounce is Draco.” Hari joked.
“Draco, mon petit, you’re drooling.” His mother’s voice interrupted his thoughts before his fantasies could get too explicit. Oh merlin, he WAS drooling. How embarrassing to be caught in a day dream about Harry, a boy, by his mother. He wiped his mouth on his sleeve and glanced at his mother.
She was saying something now to Hari as he approached. "Come on Hari, Bear will give you a pass on your age. The club will be fun. It's Yas! Night! It'll be fun." She repeated again. "We'll all dress up and sing. You can show me your improved dance moves." She says shimming in a tight circle. "Your boyfriend can come too." Alice was vibrating in her trainers.
C'iemone and Aryls laughed. "Predictable. That must had been on the set list and the bar is rolling those out, hot. No thanks, babe and I will pass. We want one Sex in the Driveway and one Blackberry Gin and Tonic."
It wasn’t long before Hari took notice of the lone figure blocking the entrance. If possible Hari’s shoulders tensed even more. Draco watched a he physically tried to relax his muscles before stepping away from the motorbike and out of Draco’s reach entirely to approach the bulking form. Something his alpha clearly did not appreciate.
was cast, which allows for the caster to perform a string of incantations without ending the previous. An eerie wind was building up around Harry, rustling his hair and clothing, but nothing else moved in the stale aired room.
Harry was stunned speechless,
Hari huffed out a laugh and obliged reluctantly. He shuffled his way to the door, looking back with worry reflected in his eyes before finally disappearing out of sight.
Draco ran in the direction the boy went, having lost sight of him in the mass of people. He could still taste the skin of the Muggle he bit back--wherever. Oh, no, what if he became diseased? What if he got--the pox? He’ll get horribly ill, red pox would appear on every part of his body, and he’d die an itchy death. So his father told him one reason to stay away from Muggles. He desperately tried cleaning his tongue off as he ran.
Sharp clawed fingertips gripped Hari’s hips tightly, and he found himself twirled in a tight circle and then tossed effortlessly through the air.
He refused my hand. How could he? Saying me, the wrong sort! Unfathomed!
“Then you can borrow something of mine and we’ll go shopping. We’ll need to do a complete overhaul of your wardrobe. Get a move on.” Draco said as he left the room.
“Nooo, AWE!” There! With a satisfied smirk, Draco continued to press into that spot, over and over again.
Mrs. Malfoy was raised as a proper pure-blood daughter, whom once married became a dutiful wife, staying by her husbands side, hosting parties for rich pure-bloods, and attending all of her husband's important business parties. She may have been a silent member of Voldemort's inner circle; yet she never took the Dark Mark as her husband (Lucius Malfoy), sister (Bellatrix Lestrange née Black), brother-in-law (Rodolphus Lestrange), and cousin (Regulus Black). Yet, Mrs. Malfoy has shown on more than one occasion that her true allegiance lay not with Voldemort, but to her only son, Draco Lucius Malfoy. She went against every belief she once held of high importance, defied Voldemort in revealing important insider Death Eater information and lied to Voldemort by telling him that I was dead, when in fact I survived the Killing Curse for the second time, all to save her son.
Right, suddenly Harry remembered that in second year, the class had learned how to get rid of Doxies and wondered why no one had thought to do this before. Gingerly, Harry placed Kreacher on the same sofa cushions Hermione had slept on when the three of them were on the run. He stood up straight, turned to face the two large East facing windows that overlooked the streets of Muggle London, drew the Hawthorn and Unicorn hair wand from the wrist holster, took a breath and began eradicating some pests.

Harry left first, returning to the ballroom with its loud music and glittering lights. Bright, sparkling robes swirled around the dance floor as the band played. Harry grabbed a flute of champagne off a floating tray and emptied half the bubbling liquid without tasting it. A flashing smile of recognition from across the room sent someone hurrying over to him, and Harry forced a genial smile he didn’t feel in the slightest and went to meet them.

He scowled at the familiar features trademark to the Black family, only skipped in his mother; the curly black hair, and pale grey eyes, much like his own.
Hari looked over at his exclamation with a concerned frown as he set a plate of buttered toast on the table before them. Draco shook his head with a bemused smirk and offered his lips for a kiss. Spatula still in one hand, he caressed Draco’s cheek with the other to grant a brief meeting of lips.
Dusk arrived before they knew it. When shadows of the trees fell across their picnic area, Andromeda called the boys over from playing an interesting Muggle game of tag, with the added bonus of laso charms and tickling charms.
"When Tom Riddle as Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry of Magic, he also took over many positions in Gringotts that rightfully belonged to goblinkind. There certainly would have been a third goblin war if humans did not return Gringotts back to the hands of the goblins. So first off, thank you for defeating Lord Voldemort, and returning Gringotts to its natural owners." Did Harry really do all that, end two Wizarding Wars and prevent a third Goblin War?
Now that they were inside, Draco set down the hindersome bundle of bags, content to know a house-elf will put them wherever Hari needed them.
My verdict is mostly inconclusive and further study would need to be conducted. After all, we just had one class together. Not everyone had as good a potions tutor as I.
Brain backtracking, he tried instead. “So shopping…we could go…” Hari once again drew a blank. He had no idea where to go shopping that would suit Draco’s tastes. Shit.  Hari sighed, rubbing his brow. He really was mucking this all up. He hadn’t any experience with high end shops, or shopping at all, really.
That doesn't mean I haven't stopped working on SCES, I am!  I have the next three chapters already blocked out. It'll just take time to get there.
"Nearly" Harry sassed back.
Was Professor Snape right in his outrage when he said, “raising the boy like a pig for slaughter, only to die at the right moment”? Before he could reflect on this new development the fire in the hearth blazed loud and green and seemed to spit out Bill Weasley.
Just then Draco came up to them with the herbs; mint, rosemary, thyme, oregano, chives, parsley, and basil. “My mother is right, Hari. I thought we explained the ceremony to you, did you not understand.”
Church going folk, the people suspected her of sorcery and wickedness. They had plans of betrayal and deceit. They went to the king, who listened and became swayed by their talk. Although he knew of the dark deeds planned against his once beloved wife and Queen, the King agreed with the people's plans.
I guess you are just not good at that charm are you?"
“Awe… but Kreacher I am not a Black, my last name is Potter and I have no family it’s just me.” Harry mumbled as he chugged the water down, trying to get rid of the sour taste of vomit.
"I don't know what to say, bae. He was your father. You had to love him at one point, he was in your life, influencing you, providing for you. I'm kind of jealous actually." Draco leaned up at this, one hand on the arm, the other the chest.
He knew that he was downright nasty to Hari’s friends while in school. Jealousy could do that to a person, but there was also the feud with the Weasleys. And Damn it, Draco just realized that Bill Weasley probably told the rest of the redheaded turnip clan about them living with Hari. That wouldn’t go over very well with the Order member’s either, seeing as he was a former Death Eater and his mother considered a Death Eater symphasizer, as she was married to one. Never mind that he and his mother were considered blood traitors by their former circles.
"What do you mean by broadened. I thought it very much was not having any Muggles in the family."
“Laugh it up Potter, I may not know where exactly we are, but we’re in my domain now. We are going to shop until we drop or our gold runs out.”
The first drunken confession only confused Hari, the second more heartfelt one caused Hari's heart to nearly beat right out of his chest. Instead of pushing Draco away, he wrapped his arms around him tighter instead.
The song opened up with a ballad on piano. When the chorus struck, Arlys enthusiastically bounced around the stage, the long heavy velvet cape not hindering her movements at all as she sang.
Hari must have keen ears for an un-presented wizard. "Like an attribute test. Personality. Different dorms, that kind of thing." Hari rushed to clarify.
"Sorry Narcissa. Draco is drunk. I am just getting him to bed." Hari panted out.
Hari reached for Draco’s hand to help him to his feet, teetering a bit on the wet and muddy ground. Nearly headbutting each other on the forehead they giggled as they tried to keep themselves in an upright position, holding onto each other’s forearms to keep from slipping again. Their lips threatened to break out into grins, but they accepted the scolding from the irate witches.  With a huff, the two witches retreated inside, pretending to be irked at the two teens when in fact they both were suppressing merry giggles of their own.
He wasn't deterred. A good scientist always made multiple experiences to test their hypothesis.
Wake up, Harry. Wake up.
The plan was full proof. Except for it wasn’t.
Hari laughed along with him, jiggling Teddy, the young heir Black, in his arms.
The books he could understand. After all, he had six years of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, and Herbology. Add to that his five years of History of Magic and three of both Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, and the amount of books was far from surprising.
“That’s because he is still developing his eyes. Andra says, once he’s about three months old, he’ll see in color and to not be surprised if he mimics your hair or eye color. Right now it's more like a sporadic mood thing. Here, come here.” Hari said excitedly.
I’ve already told Ron the wondrous news, I’ve located my parents in Australia. The memory and compulsion charm worked. Oh, how I wish I didn’t have to take pride in my skills. I never liked the idea of sending my parents away, for their own protection or not. It was too dangerous in Hampstead with families of Muggle-borns being hunted down, and I just couldn’t leave them vulnerable like that.
"You're forgetting, Mother, we were going to burn the place down anyway." Narcissa only laughed and gave a quick squeeze around the shoulder.
Maybe, he should just get advice from Draco. Then again, Draco would take great pleasure in lording it over his head.
“Did the house-elves make all this?” He asked as he settled down on the blanket, taking a bite into a round bread that turned out to be pumpernickel.
The Dursley never made Harry feel at home. Maybe he could make a home for himself, find someone to settle down, have a family all his own.
Severus scoffed. "Potter." He sneered. "Spoilt, arrogant."
My plan was ruined. Madam Hooch was gone, no doubt would be gone the entire class hour, and Potter would never see me fly. My hand reached into my slit pocket in my robe and found Longbottom’s Remembrall. I could still get him to pay attention to me after all. So I taunted him. I wanted to fly and I wanted Harry Potter to fly with me. I did finally get him in the air, but as an opponent.
with a moving photograph of himself in a white straitjacket. ‘There you go again, Harry. Your Muggle roots are showing. Wizardkind would just use a Full Body Bind curse.
"Are you writing a book on me then, or..."
Happy Easter!
If his dream was leading him towards Draco, who was he to question.
"Fine don't tell me how you injured yourself, probably a potion for skin care gone wrong, or something. What did you use as treatment?" Draco was simply gawking at Hari who turned his hand and raised it to closer to his nose to see. Alcohol surely wasn't helping his eyesight any better.
Draco really didn't want to be too close in case he couldn't control his alpha, but his alpha was absolutely delighted to be as close as possible to Hari without triggering Ice-blood. Frustrated beyond belief and just wanting to lock himself away in his room, he demanded a little harsher than intended. "Why do I have to sleep on the same floor as you, Potter?"
his alpha said reared its head. Draco still loved his sassiness, especially when it was directed at him.
"Oh, master must use either floo powder to step through the fireplace, use
The taunts the jeers. Harry has heard it all. The pain of those words hurt almost worse than the casual abuse inflicted on him from a young age. The open palmed slaps, the cuffs to the back of the head, the pinches, the neglect and near starvation all let Harry Potter know that he was an unwanted burden for his aunt and uncle from the moment he was orphaned and abandoned on their steps at 15 months old. Alone and unloved.
Hari wrapped his arms around Draco’s head, holding tight as he squeezed away the tears in his vision. Hari didn’t like seeing Draco looking so vulnerable. It wasn’t right. The Draco in Hari’s mind never kneeled at anyone’s feet. Heck, Hari certainly didn’t want
Not looking up from feeding Teddy, Andromeda said, "You owe me ten Galleons, sister dearest."
Harry knew that on an 88-key piano like this baby grand, there are 52 white keys, and 36 black keys. The white keys are called naturals and notes run from C-D-E-F-G-A-B. The Black keys also go from C to B as well but play sharp or flat notes, and are called accidentals. Sharp notes run from left to right and if asked to play a C sharp, the pianist would hit the black key directly above the key with the C note. Flat notes run from right to left and are essentially the same as the sharp notes. For example, C sharp is the same as D flat, and D sharp is the same as E flat, et cetera. There are 8 C notes and 8 octaves on an 88-key piano. Every eighth key stroke lands on a C and goes up one octave. The C note can be found by this pattern; 2 black keys followed by 3 black keys, and right before the 2 black keys will be the C note. Behind the keys and beneath the lid of the piano are no less than 230 strings that would need to be tuned, a process that could take two hours.
Laughing with a secretive gleam in her eyes, Narcissa revealed, “The secret of the Floo Candle is...nothing.” Narcissa said mischievously. “There is no trick to it at all. It’s just a candle. All you are doing is scooping the floo powder onto another kindling surface. The candle is just an aesthetic. Witches and wizards everywhere bought into this scheme, earning her a pretty sum of Knuts in the process. Our aunt,” for Dorea was their shared aunt, no matter how many generations separate them and through marriage, ''was a brilliant witch.“
Tomorrow was Dudley's birthday, while they were out at the zoo Harry would practice and prepare for his escape.
Mrs. Malfoy witnessed her family's unrelenting cruelty first hand, before she even left Hogwarts. Her eldest sister, Andromeda Black went against the beliefs of her family, fell in love and married a muggle-born, Edward (Ted) Tonks. They had been married for over twenty-five years and had a remarkable daughter together, Nymphadora Tonks, who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as an Auror and a Metamorphmagus. Ted Tonks went on the run during Voldemort's regime, refused to register under the Muggle-born Registration Commission in the Second Wizarding War and was captured and killed by Snatchers in March of 1998. Nymphadora Tonks was killed at the Battle of Hogwarts along with her husband, Remus Lupin, leaving their infant son, Edward (Teddy) Remus Lupin an orphan. Mrs. Malfoy never met her brother-in-law, niece, or grand-nephew, because Andromeda was disowned and Narcissa hadn't talked to her elder sister in twenty-five years. Similarly, my godfather and Mrs. Malfoy's cousin, Sirius Black, was sorted into Gryffindor; defying the Slytherin tradition, his relationship with his family deteriorated, and he had his named burned from the family tree after running away from home when he was sixteen to live with my father, James Potter. Both Sirius and Andromeda were born into the House of Black and deemed blood-traitors, disowned by the rest of the family, and had their names burned from the family tree. Mrs. Malfoy witnessed first hand the consequences of going against her family, and she would not be so foolhardy to make the same mistakes.
Oh, so maybe he isn’t brilliant at potions or transfiguration, maybe his talents lies in DADA or Charms? Maybe he does better in practical than theoretical knowledge. I mean he took on a troll.
“Ah, Andra, dragon, corbeau! Good, you are all up. And something smells wonderful.” Narcissa bustled into the kitchen was her arms full of odds and ends needed for the altar. Catching her sister and son’s odd looks, she looked between them “What did I miss?”
Butterbeer cost 2 Sickles=~£2
Narcissa had a particularly hard time telling the next part.  For years she locked those memories away in a secret part of her heart. But once she started talking, she needed to continue, to finish. Even as she clung to her only son, she felt herself distancing from the words, the memories, and the pain.
"That was the first, the worst, but it wasn't the last. Anytime I displeased my father, for speaking out of line, or failing in sports, or school. Usually it was over you, or your mud-Granger. Anytime you succeeded, I failed, and therefore was a failure to him." He shot back another finger of alcohol.
After a few attempts Madam Hooch gave the go ahead to mount the brooms. I followed instructions to a ‘t’. Longbottom the great lump, couldn’t control his broom at all. His broom was jinxed. It flew up over twenty feet in the air, twisted and flipped and tried to buck its rider. The broom won, and Longbottom fell, his robes catching on an unlit torch, but he survived with a broken wrist. Pansy thought I did it, but how could I when I had the perfect plan. I wasn’t going to ruin it. Potter was going to be my friend I just had to impress him enough.

For all cases and purposes, you are a now a Black. Therefore you own two high security vaults, and one trust account. "
Hari was nervous to say the least. For some reason he felt that this was a trap, despite Draco's numerous reassurances that Blaise could be trusted. But still, as they apparated into a secure location provided by Blaise away from Muggle prying eyes, he kept his wand out. For Draco's part, he only rolled his eyes and made a point to slip his wand back in the sheath. He trusted Blaise explicitly.
Stay Awesome.
I looked at the scoreboard. Slytherin's only managed forty points, and Gryffindor won with one hundred fifty. The game had to have only lasted FIVE minutes. I nearly missed the game because of Weasel and longbottom. FIVE Minutes. Incredible.
"Draco?!" Hari hissed trying to tug his arm free from Draco's vice like grip. Draco stumbled to a stop before the stairs. he let go of Hari's arm to grip the cool metal between his two now clawed hands and rested his sweaty forehead against the cool pole. He breathed in deeply trying to regain his control over his alpha instincts. His dragon who sensed he was frightened and wanted to go on the attack-to rip with talons, burn with fire, and tare into with teeth until he tasted blood and crunched on bone marrow. Draco's gave a full body shudder before turning to face Hari.
“Fine” Sherryl mumbled under her breath. When Hari said, ‘sorry, I didn’t catch that,’ she waved the boy over to her side. “I said, how about this. My place has a meal challenge. If you can eat the whole lot of it, no wasting food at my place, it’s free. If you can’t finish, you take it home for leftovers, and you as a special offer get to work off the price of the meal instead of paying, by working three hours in the back, sound like a deal?” She finished with that very tempting offer.
umbrella stand. He grazed his hand over a slash in the wallpaper, smoothing it flat with the palm of his hand. Hari whispered something under his breath, but Draco’s keen dragon ears could pick out the sound of a pink pygmy puff from a nest of squabbling poffles meters away.
I watch him at meals. I watch him in class. I watch him talk to his friends. Each one of them are more different than the last. Granger and Weasley are the most prominent members of his exclusive group of friends. The Golden Trio. Who came up with that horrible name? The other wizards in his year also hover; the fat near squib Longbottom, the Irish Finnigan, and the black Thomas.
Cedric? Even after three years, the image of his death was fresh in his mind, his memory still too painful. Hari always thought of Cedric as the flickering flame on a candle—a life that was snuffed out too soon. If the attraction was there, it had long since been overshadowed by pain and grief and forgotten in the wake of war.
All around them, Muggles glanced at the pair and whispered. Some happy for the open couple, others concerned at the show of tears, and more so with reproachful eyes. Draco paid no mind to the small minded Muggles and focused his comfort in Hari who cried into his shoulder.
“Care for a nightcap, Dray?” Hari ended up saying when Draco stepped into the room, cheeks red.
I don’t know how the spell is initiated, but it is hereditary. It affects all witches and wizards over the age of eighteen from having relations with the younger.”
The expression on Hari’s face changed to worry. “Draco, are you unwell?” Draco realized he hadn’t answered. Was this the right moment to confess all?
"The front entrance is still boobytrapped from the war, I am having a Curse Breaker come in later this week to get rid of it. This place is still under
Disclaimer: Use of a scene from Half-Blood Prince, but in Draco's POV. No plagiarism is intended.
“Oh, mother and I will be performing a blood ritual at the summer solstice to strengthen the wards on the house. Aunt Andromeda was going to ask you to join us, but I am asking you now.” Draco turned to Hari.
“I am. Now what has Hari said about tonight’s entertainment?” Sheryl asked.
The black haired, green eyed boy clicked his tongue, yet he lowered his fist.

boys."
A cold shower always did the trick. At the Dursley’s he wasn’t allowed hot showers. Over the summer that was actually a blessing for sun blistered skin after a day in the garden; and then there were those times he couldn’t control his hormonal urges and a cold shower was the only relief he was allowed.
Hari was in a good mood as he skipped down the stairs to see the progress Bill had made on getting rid of Mad-Eyes booby-trap.  Draco was sitting down at the bottom step, immaculately clean, while Bill was just covered in dust. Hari joined Draco at the bottom step. Bill turned around and Hari had to hold onto Draco’s shoulders tight as he burst into wild gales of laughter, tears streaming down his face from laughing so hard. Bill looked like a dust spectre himself, gray dust clung to him everywhere, red hair was barely visible and blue eyes stared shocked. Draco just sat there smirking, happy to have Hari clutching him close.
Draco looked lost, so vulnerable in Hari's arms.
Hari smiled not really understanding what they were laughing about, but happy that the two sisters were getting on well enough to be laughing together out in the open air in the back garden of Grimmauld Place. Hari knew that Narcissa called her son Dragon so he knew that they were laughing at Draco's expense, but he didn't realizing that the corbeau,
Draco jumped caught off guard, but Andromeda replied calmly. “I was just suggesting to Draco that perhaps Hari would like to host a housewarming party once the rest of the ground floor was cleaned. Draco disagreed with the idea.”
Somehow Draco managed to wrangle Hari into the business casual section and they selected a few blazers and suit trousers.
(See the end of the chapter for

U.K./U.S. exchange rate in 1991 vs. 2019
Lily Potter née Evans was the only witch born to a non-magical family. Muggle as those...people...no those wizardkind called normal people, such as herself. And her husband. And no doubt her perfect son.
As I am currently updating this chapter to be replaced with the real chapter 13 on April 20th, I've transfered the message here. This way I am not deleting the comments left by everyone.
To Draco’s irritation Hari didn’t try to discourage her advances. “Um thanks….er….Candice. I’ll be sure to call on you if we need anything.” Hari said biting his lip, flushing, and blinking large green eyes behind black wire rimmed spectacles at the Muggle. She didn’t seem deterred at all, and Draco gritted his teeth, sealing a growl.
"That will have to be decided after the trial. I'll have one of my employees show you to your vaults, so you can withdraw some gold" Looking around her own pile of books, and said "...Awe Mr. Weasley, come here." Bill Weasley stepped up to the Chieftess' desk. "You'll help Mr. Potter set up a Muggle Bank account at Our Ally Banking, to exchange gold for muggle currency. I believe you know how to get around the pesky muggle rule of needing to be at least eighteen to open one, yes. Alright, go, go. I am a very busy goblin I have a whole bank to run world wide. " Apparently that was them being dismissed. So as quickly as possible Andromeda with the still resting Teddy in her arms, and Harry following at her heels, rushed out of the room before the brick wall could fold in on itself once more. Right before the final bricks went back into their proper places, Harry heard the chieftess shout, "Oh, Mr. Potter, do remember to grab your birth certificate, it will be needed to set up your muggle bank account. And one last thing, Mr. Weasley worked as a Curse Breaker in Egypt, dismantling all types of boobytraps in the ruins of ancient Carro, he might be able to help you with a certain spectre in your home."
“I’ve taken art as an extracurricular since third year. Mother encouraged it…” He paused a beat. “Father had no idea.”
“Don’t mention it,” Hari said gruffly. “Can I, maybe have that, I don’t have any pictures of Teddy and me, yet.”
Andromeda carefully read over the letter, both appalled and amused at his chicken scratch handwriting. Before pausing at the bottom of the letter. His name hastily scratched out and rewritten.
"Oh, right! That." Draco hedged not sure what
"Hmm, okay..." Harry said quietly. He seriously hoped it wouldn't eat the flowers, he knew several of them to be poisonous to some pets, especially if it got into the the potion's garden on the west wall. "This is the garden, as you can see there is a terrace patio, but there is also a shaded patio and hammock between those trees, out there." Potter was pointing, but Draco was scarcely paying any attention to what he was pointing at, but concentrating on the cadence of his voice. Draco tooned back in to hear Potter say, "To leave the house, we will use the secret entrance behind the shed, for now. If you have any Quidditch gear, you can put in there. But don't touch my bike." Harry said referring of course to his godfather's flying motorbike.
"Circumstances aside, we couldn't leave him in an orphanage unprotected.
Hari hummed.
Draco couldn't help the scowl on his face. Right now, his father was looking back at him in the mirror and he hated it.
"Scarier than the Horntail; than facing Voldemort?" Draco asked. Hari looked up deeply into Draco's eyes.
Potter threw himself sideways, throwing a wordless jinx of his own but Draco was able to block it with a flick of his wand. He raised his wand once more, trying to concentrate over Moaning Myrtle’s shouts echoing loudly in the tiled room, “No! No! Stop it! STOP!”
“You’re back! Cissy and I found it, but the state of the room I’m afraid...well, look for yourselves.” Andromeda stepped aside fretting. Hari peered past her to take a glimpse inside.
Hari's face broke out in a toothy crooked smile. "I like it a lot. I was beginning to wonder if a wand would ever choose me like my first time in Ollivander’s."
"Just stop talking, Draco!" Hari says mildly. To his surprise Draco listens. Hari took his hand away. "Let me read a bit."
Bill’s eyes were twinkling in humor. “Is there anything else you would like to add?” Bill asked, completely taken in by these two.
Ahead of the two boys, walking arm in arm with her sister, Narcissa pretended to not hear a thing. Thick braids obscured the frilled ears of her alpha dragon, eavesdropping in earnest.
Diaries are girly. This is a journal, I told Ma Mère so. Mon Mère says to write in you like I were writing a friend. To write down my thoughts and dreams and secrets so no one but me could read it. You’re warded so that only my blood can open your pages. I cut my finger on the edge of the spine and my blood opens the pages to write. That’s brilliant, but it hurts really bad and my blood stains these pages as I write. Mon Mere says you’ll be my friend, but Papa says Malfoy’s don’t have friend’s only underlings. Papa says lots of things. Like how Malfoy’s don’t cry, or show emotions, because they are weakness and Malfoy’s are not weak. So I don’t have any animate friends, only Crabbe and Goyle my underlings. They are stupid. They can’t even read or understand big words. So I use big words and even if I use them incorrectly, those morons would never know.
Ashur coiled in on himself with black tarnished silver scales grinding against one another. “Tellsss him, I’sss aiming for hisss pointy nossse.” Ashur said to Hari.
"Hey you boys, what's going on 'ere?" A rougher, louder voice than the spectators said.
The betrayal happened one Sunday morning, while leaving Church. A mob surrounded Melusine and her children, throwing accusations at her. The beautiful Melusine turned tear filled eyes towards her thought to be loyal mate and King, but her mate did not aid her.
Well, he wasn’t getting back to sleep now. He needed to be up before dawn to help prep for the Litha celebration. It was something new and exciting, like learning more about his lost heritage.
"You're joking, Potter? That's barbaric."
Once out in the garden, Hari walked through the grass, while Draco took the gravel circle path around. Hari rolled his eyes, but said nothing. The shed door was on a slide instead of a hinge, and it was a little rusted, so he had to put a little muscle behind the push to the right to open the door. It was a tiny space, most of it taken up by the motorcycle Sirius had left him. After the disaster of an escape from the Dursley’s on his seventeenth birthday, Mr. Weasley had shrunk it back down and fixed it up after it was crashed into Andromeda and Ted Tonk’s yard. Mr. Weasley was fascinated with Muggle artifacts, flying vehicles in particular. Hari remembered the flying car from second year, they flew it all the way to Scotland, before crashing it into the Whopping Willow Tree, and it now runs wild in the Forbidden Forest. Hopefully, Mr. Weasley didn’t take out all the security measures, he could live without the giant brick wall, but he quite liked the dragon fire from the exhaust pipe.
So here they were, in Diagon Alley running from mobs of a different kind. When Hari finally made his way to Ollivander’s he shed his disillusionment charm upon entering the door, the bell above sounded his arrival. Hari physically bristled at what he heard and saw. Draco was standing his back to the door, his hands raised in surrounded, and pleaded for service. Not only was he pleading with these two ungrateful witches for service, they in turn were ridiculing him. Prior to sixth year, with all the ridiculing Draco Malfoy had done to him and countless others, Hari would have called it cosmic justice, or karma. However, in light of the events leading up to the war and how much Hari has seen Draco change, hearing Draco plea was just wrong, somehow. He was really angry. Draco had not ridiculed them or caused them physical pain like he has others. If anyone had the right to mock Draco it would be him.
...really?” Draco choking on his tea.
Shrugging it off, he stripped from Draco’s borrowed clothes, and laid them across a chair as for them not to get mixed into his own laundry by mistake. Before he put the shirt down he smelled the collar. It smelled faintly of Draco’s expensive shampoo.
"What did a Half-blood sneak in?" Hari tried to joke.
When Sheryl peered across the street at what her fellow shopkeeper and friend, Wanda, took to be a shoplifter, she just shook her head sadly. The would be hoodlum was no older than sixteen, tall and rail thin, with unruly black tousled hair, and oversized tattered worn out clothes, giving him the impression that a breeze could knock him over at any moment.  Although, Sheryl imagined he looked that he might be desperate enough to steal something, she didn’t believe he didn’t look like the others who vandalized for the sake of vandalizing. She sighed, resigned to the fact that she was about to scare him off just for the peace of mind to her friend. When she opened her mouth and shouted towards the boy, he didn’t run like expected but spun around and faced her, with eyes impossibly big and green behind black round rim and broken spectacles, face pale bruised and gaunt with obvious malnourishment. Sheryl fought down the pity and hollered to the boy.
Harry never considered what would happen if he got married and had children with a wife of his own. He just wanted to make sure that he took his responsibilities as a godfather seriously, and provide for his godson. Could he just hand over the Black estate to Teddy, and leave the Potter vault to his own children? What if he died before having any children? He always wanted a family, had even considered a future with Ginny before he split up with her, in what he believed was protecting her. Now he didn't even know if he even wanted to get back together with her. He could honestly say, he hadn't thought of her that often while hunting Horcruxes. 'Does that mean I never loved her to begin with, only the idea of what we could have together, a family?'
Sincerely,
He didn't have to worry after all. He finished the crisps and tried a bright red, twisting rubbery candy that smelled faintly of strawberries.
McGonagall firecalled Severus, who was instructed to owl my father. I begged him not to. I told him everything. Harry, Hagrid, the Dragon. He looked disappointed in me. But he never did owl my father.
"It's open." Nik hollered not moving from his perch on the other side of the counter. Harry turned panicked eyes to Nik who didn't look phased in the least. Panicked eyes roamed the bakery, looking for an escape. His eyes landed on the the land line on the wall next to the electric kettle.
They didn't even believe in birthday wishes or Christmas miracles. Santa Claus and the tooth-fairy, dragons and unicorns, or elves and fairies, were all simply children's fantasies, pretend, and make believe.
21 May 1992
Hari reached for his wand, but found that too gone.
The Muggle girl immediately put Draco on edge with her overly mascaraed eyelashes, coy smile, and inappropriate display of cleavage. From her posturing, Draco could tell she was obviously making advances at Hari. His alpha immediately reared his head in challenge. Draco bit down on his rising temper and glanced over at Hari to see what he would do.
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
"Don't put words in my mouth, Potter." Draco pulled Hari in close and kissed his forehead, then his lips.
"He recognized us. I don't know who he is or what he wanted, but I had to get you out of there. We have to go." Draco said.
Draco coughed trying to get his breathing and heartrate under control. He then looked up at Hari, with only a forearm between them, and said with his signature drawl, “Sorry, Potter. I think my virtue might be in danger here.”
“My godson,” Hari said.
“Ohs yes, Mistress. Dots hears yous. Does Mistress needs anythings else?”
The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black are distant descendants of the Antipodean Opaleye. The how is speculated on, but the results are the same. Opaleye's are remarkably peace-loving dragons with pearl like scales and glittering pupiless, multi-colored eyes, and firey-red breath.
With minimal effort the hammock began to rock. Draco looked down to see Hari’s emerald eyes trained intently on his face, a soft smile on his lips and faint rosy blush on his cheeks. Answering the smile with one of his own, he rested his head atop Hari’s messy black mop.
She spoke in a dead voice, void of emotion, “I was told constantly that I was a failure as a wife, because I couldn’t even perform my duties properly. It took me years to conceive, as female alphas tend to do. That wasn’t an excuse; I was forced to endure a loveless coupling each time. I might as well have been raped. I’d finally conceive but then I’d lose the baby each time. One time…one time I made it to the eighth month and suddenly I couldn’t feel my precious baby moving anymore-I couldn’t feel them moving. The mediwizard made me carry the dead baby around until I passed the baby naturally; they said if they removed the fetus magically, I might never conceive again. I had no say over my body. I was the property of my husband. Until you were born healthy and hail, if premature, I didn’t rejoin society. I couldn’t.”
