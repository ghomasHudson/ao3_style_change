“For six months? You would not have. You’d have tolerated it for maybe two, then you would have told me to buck my ideas up and get back out on the scene,” Pansy said, gesturing at him with a glass that she’d picked up. “What makes Potter so different?”
“Yeah, they only had bacon ready and I didn’t want to be late,” Harry replied, his voice muffled by the cupboard door. He emerged again with his apron in his hands. “Is that okay?”
“Ah. I’m just going to stick with the truth for that,” Harry said. “Or part of the truth. We went out for coffee.”
“You and everyone else in that corridor, I’m sure,” Harry laughed. “Merlin only knows what Ginny was thinking. George still reminds her of it every now and again.”
“Yeah, I’m sure. We haven’t been that busy today so it’s not that messy,” Draco replied with a shrug. “We’d have to mop up in the morning if this rain carries on anyway.”
“We both did,” Harry said. “I’m not complaining that we’re busy because Merlin knows it’s better than twiddling our thumbs, but it is a lot more tiring. I usually get home on a night and, once I’ve eaten, go straight to bed. I don’t sleep, but I haven’t got the motivation to do anything else, either.”
Draco nodded. “I’m quite looking forward to it, I have to admit. Not that I have anything planned for Christmas. I’ll probably spend the morning with my parents.”
Harry nodded slowly. “That doesn’t sound like a bad idea, actually. It’s so close to Christmas now that it would be a bit… I don’t know, it would seem odd for us to break it to everyone now. Afterwards it might be easier for them to understand it. I don’t think we should change our plans for Christmas either. You should go to your parents as planned, and I’ll go to The Burrow.”
Draco waved goodbye to Harry and hurried along the street to the Apparition point. He had been invited to join Pansy and Theo for dinner and he didn’t want to be late.
Harry could hear him rummaging around in the store cupboard and wondered briefly if he should offer to help.
“Me too. Trust me, it’s a good thing. I’m pretty sure that takings are up compared to normal,” Draco said, smiling. “Mother is over the moon.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco replied, balling up the paper bag and throwing it at Harry. “Finish your coffee. The delivery will be here in a minute.”
Draco finished eating and sent his plate soaring off to the sink where it washed itself up and put itself away. Smiling to himself with satisfaction, he went to the fridge and took out the bottle of wine he’d put in there earlier that day, then he turned and headed to the lounge, picking up a wine glass on his way. Settling himself into his favourite armchair, he poured himself a glass of wine and set the bottle down on the table. He lit the fire using his wand and picked up his book, allowing himself to become immersed in the story.
Harry made his way to Paperwhite’s, checking his watch as he walked. He was right on time to meet Draco. As he reached the section of the street where Paperwhite’s stood, he spotted Draco waiting for him.
“At least you had the sense to cast a water-repelling spell,” Pansy said as she shut the door, peering out at the rain one last time.
“That’s exactly the attitude I don’t want,” Harry said, pointing his finger at Draco. “People wanting to date me because I am who I am. I’m sure I’ve told you this.”
“But the stripping is part of the fun,” Draco argued before darting his tongue out to lick along Harry’s collarbone now. “Don’t you think?”
A week later, Harry found himself face to face with Ron, who had stumbled across them in a dark corner of the New Year’s Eve party venue.
“Can’t wait,” Harry said with a grin, taking his cloak from Draco. “Thank you for coming here tonight.”
“True. But these are new designs, we have to take a bit of time over them to make sure we get them right,” Draco said with a chuckle.
Harry sighed. “Apparently when I’d go in in a bad mood, it took me ages to bring myself out of it and I would grunt at the customers, meaning he had to deal with them.”
“We need to go through all the sales receipts for the past year and see what’s not selling,” Draco said to Harry as he returned from lunch on the first Saturday in March.
“When we have guests, yes. Appearances are important, Draco,” Pansy said, standing up. “Come along, or it’ll get cold.”
“Where’s your tree?” Harry asked, walking through to the lounge and looking around. “I thought you were getting one?”
“It can be,” Harry agreed, gasping softly at the tickling sensation. “But not today.” He slid his hands down Draco’s back until they were on his backside and then he squeezed gently.
“Bloody hell. I always forget how time flies when we’re doing this,” Harry sighed, shaking his head as he followed Draco. “Why is it that the hanging display always makes things take longer?”
“I think lighthearted is a good idea,” Harry replied, nodding. “I don’t think I could cope with anything too heavy after that week.”
Draco grinned too. “I’d say this is possibly even fairer than a Quidditch match. Okay, let’s get started.”
Draco turned and headed back along the stacks towards the café, leaving Harry alone to contemplate what his life had become. He picked the book up again, turning it over to read the blurb once more.
“It will, but it’s pointless us coming in,” Draco replied as he pulled the stepladder out of its cubby-hole. “The last few years have taught us that. Better we have time to relax, don’t you think?”
Harry shook his head. “Merlin knows why. An ironing board is an ironing board, whether it’s magical or not.”
“Potter… it’s her shop,” Draco said wryly. “I’m not sure she’d take kindly to me giving her some of her own stock.”
“Yes, that was the last slice,” Draco replied as he sat back down on the sofa. “I thought you might prefer this to the chocolate cake.”
“Yes. It would,” Harry smiled. “This place is perfect. I can’t believe that we haven’t been bothered at all. Not even when we went to the café counter.”
“Sorry for calling, Charlie,” Harry sighed as he got a bit closer to the fire. “I’ve made a mess of things.”
Heading back down the stairs, he walked into the dining room to find the table set for two. He turned to find Narcissa entering the room. “Who’s the other place for?”
Draco nodded. “Yes. I know that also seems like a big leap, but I wasn’t sure how you’d feel about a restaurant meal.”
“School, if you’re anything like me,” Draco snorted. “Unless you count the catalogue at work when we look at it together.”
“Well, when you put it like that, neither did I,” Harry said with a huff of laughter. “It was nice though.”
As Harry began to sort through the boxes of returns, he could hear tuneless humming coming from the shop. Giving a soft huff of laughter, Harry shook his head and carried on.
“Ah. Alright, well that’s fine, I’ll just tell Hermione that,” Ron said, shrugging. “It was just a thought she had, I think.”
“Halloween-themed dried flowers, which led to remembering the troll in the dungeon at school,” Harry chuckled. “So, if we’re going to design some Christmas displays this afternoon, should we maybe get started?”
Harry snorted. “I don’t suppose they’d use the word ‘hate’ but I would think that you did get a few of their backs up. Professor McGonagall for one.”
“I thought so too,” Draco replied, gesturing to Harry to sit down. “But you know what Mother is like. Very traditional.”
“I didn’t…” Ron muttered, looking around. “But, now you mention it, I’ll just have a look at the potted plants. I might take one of them for Hermione.”
Finally everyone at the table had served themselves and they began to eat. They hadn’t been eating for five minutes when Molly turned to Harry from her place at the head of the table. “So, Harry, Hermione tells me you had a date at the weekend? How did it go?”
Harry laughed and headed for the door, Draco following him, extinguishing the lamps as he went. They stepped out into the chilly, dark air and turned to pull the door shut after them.
“I don’t know. I offered to leave the job, but he said no to that,” Harry continued with a shrug. “He did ask me to go in early, so I
“Yeah, sorry, mate,” Ron said, jiggling Hugo back and forth as he spoke. “It’s really not that surprising.”
As he took a drink, he wondered what had possessed Harry to do what he’d done. While he knew he hadn’t exactly been honest with Harry about his own feelings, he hadn’t outright lied to him. Apart from the treacle tart. Sighing, he tipped his head back against the chair. He’d meant it when he’d told Pansy that he was afraid of ruining the friendship between himself and Harry by attempting a relationship, but it looked like that had been managed before anything had even happened. Could they possibly get past this?
“A Muggle game played by children,” Harry said. “It’s very easy. I’ll go first. I’m going to give you a letter of the alphabet and you have to guess what I’m thinking of, okay?”
“Apparently Rose wasn’t well, so he left Hermione to deal with it on her own,” Harry replied with a shrug. “I don’t know what goes through his head sometimes.”
“I see,” Draco said quietly, gazing down at Mr McGregor. He lifted one hand and carefully ran it along Mr McGregor’s back, smiling as the cat purred happily and leaned into his touch. He looked up at Harry. “We have to have him.”
“Oh. Alright, yeah,” Harry nodded. He tried not to let anything show on his face, but he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that they wouldn’t be working together as they usually would, but at the same time he wasn’t really surprised that Draco was taking this stance.
“I feel better about a private meal,” Harry admitted. “But only because I’m not sure how to tell everyone about this yet. If you even want people to know? I can’t imagine hiding it forever, but having spent so long telling them I’m seeing a bloke called Adam…”
“Sounds delightful. I like that pub,” Draco said, still smiling as he lifted his mug to take a sip of his coffee.
Harry grinned and turned, heading into the back room to get the mop and bucket. He picked up the sweeping brush and passed it to Draco as he went. His stomach was full of butterflies as he put the bucket under the tap and turned it on. He knew it was silly, really, considering they hadn’t talked about anything yet, but he couldn’t help but hope that this was the step forward they needed to get their friendship back to how it was before The Confession.
During the silence that followed, Harry took the opportunity to look at Arlo properly. He was a touch taller than Charlie with straight, dark hair that brushed the tops of his shoulders, dark brown eyes and a rather attractive smile.
Draco grinned. “Good. I wanted to give you something different, but enough to avoid being boring. And yes, yes they are. I have fallen asleep here more than once.”
It was midway through June when Draco brought up the fact that they hadn’t been on any more ‘dates’ again.
Draco smiled again, smugly this time. “I know you do. And I love you, too. Do you think I’d go to all this effort if I didn’t?”
“Oh, believe me, I know,” Harry replied with a nod. “I might not have looked like I was paying attention in his lessons, but I know he was a good teacher. I may have paid more attention if he hadn’t given me the impression that he hated me from the moment he first set eyes on me, though.”
“No, no, you’re fine,” Harry said, stooping down to pick the egg box up. “Although the same can’t be said for my eggs. I’ve just got home from work and haven’t eaten yet.”
“I have a few more places I want to take you,” Draco said, giving him a mysterious smile. “But I’m not telling you where, yet. I like to see the look on your face when you realise where we are.”
Ron made his way back to the counter, his jaw dropping slightly as he looked at the bouquet. “Mate… that’s perfect. You really know your stuff, don’t you?”
Harry shook his head with a smile, then he picked up the quill and charmed it to be self-inking before he forgot.
“Good. I’ll help you water the plants when we’re done. We deserve a bit of a break,” Draco said, nudging Harry back towards the counter where they could sit down.
“Because he is a people-pleaser. He wouldn’t be able to do that without feeling bad about it. If I arrange something, he’s not technically lying to them,” Draco explained. “Do you see?”
“So, you’re helping Harry avoid bad blind dates,” Narcissa began, cutting into her ham. “Do you have any blind dates of your own to avoid?”
Harry nodded, still smiling as he turned away and slid off his stool. He picked up a trug and headed onto the shop floor to pick up the dried flowers they would need, making sure to collect enough for two bouquets.
Draco shrugged one shoulder, a faint red blush colouring his cheeks. Although he was very proud of his creation, it embarrassed him to talk about it in such a way.
They fell silent as they worked, each of them adding and moving the flowers around until they were happy that their efforts were beginning to look like their designs.
Harry gave him a torn look. “Yes please,” he said eventually. “I really want to carry on reading, but I also want cake.”
“A date. You and me. Me and you,” Harry repeated, holding out the little paper carrier bag he had in his free hand. “I bumped into Molly. She wanted me to go out to dinner with the son of one of her friends. I told her I already had plans. You should be proud of me.”
Draco nodded. “Let’s get started then. I’ll do the floor, you sort the back room. I cleaned all the display units when I was watering.”
Sitting forward again, he took another drink, continuing to mull over the evening’s events. It had all started so well, and it had got even better when they were eating their desserts. He knew that if Harry hadn’t admitted to lying about being set up on dates, he would have confessed that he hadn’t bought the treacle tart from the café but had made it himself. It was lucky that he got on well enough with the café staff that they didn’t mind him putting the treacle tart on one of their plates to give to Harry.
“Not yet. I was hoping you could help me with that,” Pansy said, drawing her legs up underneath her as she sat down. “But not tonight. You know my tastes, and my colour scheme, so I’ll come into the shop and we can talk about it, yes?”
Draco grinned and shrugged, opening his book. “Let’s just read, shall we. Another three chapters, do you think?”
“I’m alright with it,” Harry replied. “I think. I can’t remember the last time I shared a book with someone.”
“Now that would have been interesting,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “What will you tell them if they do tell you to bring him?”
“Are we reading while we’re there tonight?” Draco asked, looking thoughtful. “Or just having coffee?”
“So tomorrow we need to start getting the centrepieces done for the wedding booking next week,” Draco said as they walked through the shop. “They’re dried flowers so we can do them early.”
“See you soon, Harry,” Charlie said warmly, taking a handful of Floo powder from the tin on top of the fireplace.
Harry turned to a page in the back of his notepad and frowned. “I haven’t thought about it. I just think about going out for coffee with you as friends.”
“The only way this could be better is if you made it yourself,” Harry continued, savouring another bite. “Because then I could ask you to make it for me all the time.”
“If you don’t mind?” Harry replied hopefully. “We will tell people, but we want to do it in our own time. We’re sort of still getting used to it ourselves, what with Christmas and everything going on.”
“I was just thinking about how I’ve never seen this street empty,” Harry said, grinning. “And I was admiring the fairy lights.”
“Eventually, yes,” Harry said, feeling his neck beginning to grow hot. “But don’t expect it to be any time soon.”
Harry caught Ron’s eye briefly before nodding. “I get what you’re saying. I don’t drink a lot, I have to admit.”
“Trug,” Draco said, pointing to the pair of trugs that sat beside the counter. “Does that mean I win?”
“I think that it would be a very awkward affair if I were to turn up,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Blaise Zabini and I are very different people.”
“You make a good point,” Harry laughed. “Alright, let’s get inside. It’s colder than I thought out here.”
A few moments later, Harry was holding a tray containing their food and drinks and they were heading along the aisle to their usual alcove. Unfortunately for them, when they got there the alcove was occupied.
“Don’t worry, this is not the last you’ve heard of this,” Pansy said, sweeping past him and out of the door.
Harry took the book from him and looked at the cover for a second before turning it over to read the blurb. “Oh… yeah, I see what you mean about the blurb. I think you’re right.”
Harry grinned and sat up too, pulling a notepad across. He picked up a quill and drew a rough rectangle on the first blank page. “Alright, do you want to do the drawing or should I?”
“Definitely. Should we start this afternoon, do you think? We’ve got nothing else on,” Harry suggested.
“No,” Harry sighed. “That’s true. But honestly, besides Quidditch and knowing Angelina, we had nothing in common. Conversation just didn’t happen and I ended up talking to George more than Jordan. So we know younger men are a no.”
Draco studied Harry’s drawing before reaching over and taking the quill from his hand, their fingers brushing against one another. “What about this?” he asked softly, making a couple of adjustments to the page.
“Well, it’s alright for some,” Draco said teasingly. “I can’t blame you. I could have a roast dinner every week if I went home to the Manor, but I just can’t do that.”
Harry pushed himself up off his chair, picking up his glass at the same time. “Should we do the dishes first?”
“Not a bad way to spend a summer,” Draco said, nodding slightly. “So where did you go from there? Many wild nights with many men?”
Harry shrugged. “It was ten years ago. We’ve both grown up and realised there are more important things than a childhood rivalry.”
Buttering two slices of bread, he layered the ham on top and finished it off with some lettuce. Cutting the finished sandwich into two, he sent the butter floating back to the fridge and dropped the knife into the sink. He didn’t bother with a plate, but got himself a glass of water and took the sandwich into the living room to eat.
“No! Well, yes, but not in the way you’re thinking,” Harry exclaimed, dropping his fork again. “I kept turning up to work the morning after a date in a bad mood. Draco, I suppose, got a bit fed up with it and told me to let him know the next time someone tried to set me up and he’d arrange something better. And he did. We’ve been going to a bookshop-cum-library-cum-café and having a kind of mini book club.”
Harry lifted his hands as he returned the kiss, one snaking around Draco’s waist and the other moving to cup the back of his neck.
place he would be chained is the kitchen,” Pansy sniffed. “Why do you think we have a wrought iron bed frame?”
“Alright, alright,” Molly said, standing up and pulling out her wand to clear the table. “It’s Eve’s pudding and custard, I hope that’s alright with everyone?”
Harry laughed too. “It will, don’t worry,” he said as he walked around the table to sit beside Ron who, again, had Hugo on his lap and was blowing raspberries. “Ahh, we’re still on this, are we?”
Harry grinned and stepped forward and slid his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him close. “Me too,” he murmured as their lips met. He ran one hand up Draco’s back as they kissed, caressing his neck gently.
“Quiet,” Harry said, making his way through the shop and joining Draco in the backroom. “I didn’t go to The Burrow this week. How was yours?”
Draco nodded. “I’m not sure we will get the book finished today at this rate, you know. We’ve taken too long eating cake.”
“And there’s nothing wrong with that,” Narcissa said. “But are you not thinking of settling down at all?”
“I thought we’d do a sort of book club evening,” Draco replied, gesturing for Harry to sit down in one of the squishy leather armchairs they’d reached. “If that’s alright with you?”
“No, good point,” Harry nodded. “I suppose it is a bit harder to make a whole row of wizard-owned houses Unplottable.”
“If only more of them thought like you,” Harry sighed. “I want this night to go well, not with us having to watch our backs in case someone attempts to ambush us.”
Turning the corner, Harry was pleased to see that it was empty. In fact, the whole café was very quiet compared to normal. He could definitely hear the crackling of the fires more than he usually could. “Do you think we’re the only ones in here?”
“Not for me. Things have changed since we were at school. Working with him for the last however many years has made me… appreciate him for who he is,” Harry replied. “If that makes sense?”
“No, neither did I, actually,” Draco replied. “Although it does make a lot of things in my past make sense…”
“Yes, please. I would love to have dinner with you,” Harry said with a grin. “Are we keeping it casual or will it be a formal occasion?”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Molly said, her voice wobbling a little bit. “I didn’t mean it to sound the way it did. I just… I know how much you looked up to Sirius and he never got the chance to settle down. I don’t want that for you.”
Harry nodded, concentrating on the sign as he began to cast the spell. After a few moments, he was finished and put his wand away. He carefully set the sign up again and stepped back, watching to see whether anything would happen.
Draco nodded. “Exactly. You never know what’s going to take off. Whatever is in the magazines usually takes off so I suppose we should also check those to see if there’s anything we don’t already have.”
“Not really,” Draco said as he hopped off his stool and headed for the back room to get the catalogue. “I have vague ideas about colours, but that’s about it.”
“I’m glad it worked out for them,” Harry said, turning his head to look at Draco. “They went through such a lot.”
“She sent an owl this morning saying she’s ill,” George replied from his place next to Hermione. “A mild case of Spattergroit, by all accounts.”
Harry grinned. “That was kind of the idea. Although I suppose working together has the added bonus of not being able to forget me…”
Charlie gave him a sympathetic look. “Ideally, yes but not everyone is good at talking about things like that. What will happen when you go back to work?”
Harry shook his head. “Not at first. I knew I shouldn’t be doing it, but it was already too late. I thought that if I told you the truth you might put a stop to the dates. So I was selfish. The dates were a bright spot in my week, or month, and I didn’t want to lose them. I really can’t apologise enough. I should have been able to talk to you about what I was feeling.”
“It’s fine by me,” Draco nodded. “What about you? And if one of us reads a bit quicker, that’s okay. We won’t turn the page until we’re both done reading it.”
“He seems a very pleasant young man,” Molly replied carefully, and it was evident to Harry that she wasn’t fully sure about Ginny’s choice in partners.
Draco chuckled. “Fair enough,” he said. “Well, we’re both here now, so you won’t have to wonder any longer.”
Draco blinked and followed her into the warmth of the hallway, shrugging off his cloak. “How are you?”
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, pulling a binder out of a cupboard. “Sometimes I think not much has changed, because we always seem to sell the same things, but then I look at the receipts and realise that we haven’t sold as much of a particular thing as I thought, or we’ve sold loads more of something that I hadn’t even considered.”
“Exactly. But don’t worry, now you’ve explained it, I understand,” Draco replied with a grin. “We just need to get the books and we’ll be all set.”
Harry dug his hand into his pocket and pulled out his money, watching as the falcon fluttered down beside the witch and held out its leg. He handed the letter over to the witch, along with the six silver coins. She deftly rolled the letter up and tied it to the owl’s leg. Harry breathed a sigh of relief as the falcon spread its wings and flew out of the window that was behind the witch.
“Hm. Maybe we’re more alike than I thought,” Draco said thoughtfully. “I didn’t think of it like that.”
“Presumably he didn’t tell her of his intentions,” Draco said, checking his watch. “Or she wouldn’t have arranged it. Come on, get out the back, the delivery will be here in a minute.”
“That’s all well and good, but I need to get the antidote for this potion,” Draco said. “I know I don’t have any because I don’t keep Draught of Living Death in my house. I don’t suppose you do, do you?”
“Ginny said she’s only just told Mr and Mrs Weasley, so maybe they’ve been keeping it quiet on purpose?” Harry suggested, glancing over at Draco. “Our reactions are probably mild compared to some people’s.”
“Well, let’s just say we don’t have it anymore,” Draco sighed. “I was going to try and repair it, but the pieces were so small, it wasn’t worth it.”
“That’s besides the point,” Draco said, with a shake of his head. “As soon as he stops talking about ‘Adam’, his friends try to set him up with someone else. So the pretence continues.”
“We were kissing because it was midnight, and we were both here and…” Harry trailed off, looking at Ron hopefully. “Are you buying any of that?”
“Well, if it’s company you want, I could always come with you,” Pansy said, raising one eyebrow. “But you’ve never asked me.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, I’ve got another couple of pages of chapter two to read before I can start chapter three.”
“I know, I remembered,” Draco smiled as he took a bite of his cake. “You mentioned it at work once.”
“Good thinking. Can you draw a poster?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “Because that kind of art is not my speciality.”
“Are they freshly made?” Harry asked, lifting his plate to eye level so that he could examine the sandwich.
“Ah, I see,” Draco replied thoughtfully. “I suppose it’s nice that all of his family accepted him for who he is.”
“I can’t wait forever for that though, Harry. I need something to take my mind off it,” Draco replied. “I want you to take me to that Battersea place tomorrow. I want a cat.”
“Pansy, I’m not against being happy! I’m against ruining one of the best things in my life on a whim!”
“Just some water, please,” Harry nodded, as he rubbed his stomach absentmindedly. “I don’t think I can move.”
“Hopefully that’s not easier said than done,” Harry said, putting his quill down. “What time is it?”
Draco snorted. “Why do these things always happen when I’m on my lunch?” he asked, an amused grin on his face. “And why, for the love of Merlin, didn’t you move that pot with magic?”
Harry nodded, turning away as he ran one hand through his hair. He ignored the little pang of guilt that he felt in his stomach from knowing that no-one had tried to set him up. He hoped that if Draco ever found out about the little fib, he wouldn’t be too angry.
“Mm, well, we’ll see,” Harry said, sitting back slightly as the pudding landed in front of him. He took hold of the serving spoon and cut himself a portion, depositing it into his own bowl before the pudding dish moved on to Ron.
“It’s looking likely,” Draco replied, deftly wrapping a length of red ribbon around the vase. “Normally it’s starting to slow down a bit by now, but I think we’ve actually been busier than ever this year with these dried arrangements.”
As the afternoon wore on, and the customers got fewer and fewer, Harry and Draco took the opportunity to take the weight off their feet for a while. Harry picked up a quill and began to doodle on his notepad, while Draco watched.
“As a matter of fact, he did,” Draco replied, lifting his chin. “It was certainly less stressful than a blind date. We went as friends, we ended the night as friends so in my eyes, that’s a win.”
“I know, I know,” Harry said with a sigh. “She’ll get the message. I don’t mind her setting me up, I just want her to vet the bloke properly.”
“Alright, so the book. Should we set a goal to read tonight?” Draco suggested, looking at Harry. “Maybe three chapters? They’re quite long. Then we can read the rest next time.”
Harry laughed. “Well, I hope so or you’ll be disappointed. I think Mrs Weasley is doing roast beef and Yorkshire pudding this week.”
Draco gave him a smile, pleased that his choice had been received well. “I’m not sure we’ll get it all read today, but we can always come back to finish it off.”
“The artefact he went to investigate was more dangerous than anyone knew,” Hermione continued. “As soon as he was within two feet of it, he couldn’t move away. He was compelled to pick it up.”
“Oh. Well, thank you. I suppose we have time to eat the sandwiches before we get started,” Draco replied, putting his notepad and quill down. “I want to do a move around of the displays. They’re looking a bit tired.”
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted with a shrug. “It hasn’t come up during Sunday lunch for a while. I just keep hoping she’s forgotten about me.”
“Oh no, no, it certainly won’t be formal,” Draco said, shaking his head. “No. Don’t you dare arrive in dress robes. I’ll be making spaghetti, so it’s probably best to wear something you won’t mind being covered in sauce.”
Harry unwrapped a small box containing a badge that looked familiar. As he held it up, he realised why and began to laugh. “Is this a ‘Potter Stinks’ badge?”
“Yes, well. I’ll get you back. You won’t know when, but trust me, it’ll happen,” Harry replied as he accepted the kiss from Draco.
“Fancy a bacon sandwich?” Harry asked forty minutes later, looking over at Draco. “We’ve got time before we have to open up. My treat.”
As he ran his eyes down the list of dishes, he felt a light tickle on his leg. Frowning at the menu, he shook his leg to get rid of whatever it was. A moment later, the tickling feeling was back, but making its way further up his leg. He shook his leg again, tutting.
“Take as long as you want, you’ve earned it after all,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I’ll be alright on my own. I can’t see us having a mad rush this afternoon.”
“Just checking,” Draco said with a grin as the barista came over to serve them. “Yes, I’d like a chicken salad sandwich on brown please, and a slice of that chocolate cake. Oh and a large latte.”
“Really? And you still think you’re only friends?” Pansy said, raising one eyebrow. “How long has it been now? Six months?”
“Yes, eventually,” Draco said. “Thankfully. Once she understood that it wasn’t that I fancied other girls, but boys, she stopped being so overbearing and I was glad of her friendship.”
“But does the new Draco want to be happy?” Pansy asked wisely. “Because he’s in danger of letting something good go, if he’s not careful.”
He went to the bathroom and used the toilet before washing his hands and face. Then he made his way back into the bedroom where he changed out of the clothes he’d worn all day for work and into the fresh outfit he’d sent over that morning. As he’d told Harry, it wasn’t anything fancy and he was wearing a soft jumper in a bottle green colour accompanied by a pair of his smart but comfortable jeans. He’d never owned jeans until Pansy had talked him into trying a pair on when they were shopping in London one day. He hadn’t looked back since, and when he had to go into Muggle London, jeans were his choice.
“Yeah, good point,” Harry replied. “Sometimes I don’t fancy the usual places when I go out at lunchtime. I can come here instead.”
He abandoned the bathroom and ran back along the landing and down the stairs to the kitchen. He grabbed the tin of Floo powder from the mantelpiece and threw a pinch into the flames, calling out “Ron Weasley!”
Draco nodded, turning away slightly with a smirk. He hadn’t lied, exactly, but there was an element of wanting to cheer Harry up as well as pulling him out of his funk. “So, we have no preorders to make up today. What do you say we have a go at some of the dried flower arrangements?”
“It smells divine, darling,” Pansy said as her hand disappeared beneath the table to pat Theo on the leg.
“I should hope not,” Tim replied. “It can have a very detrimental effect on your health, you know. The same goes for fast food takeaways. We’re very lucky to have these bodies in full working order. We should respect them.”
“Yeah, do you want me to try and get the order amended so we can do the display in the morning?” Harry replied.
“Oh, Harry, don’t be silly!” Molly exclaimed, suddenly seeming more like her usual self. “I never wanted to dictate your love life at all, I just wanted to be sure that you weren’t missing out on anything.”
Draco shook his head. “Not really. I wasn’t told about the members of my mother’s family who’d been disowned for similar reasons either. It’s only been over the last ten years that I found all of this out.”
Harry waved and then pulled his head back out of the flames. His stomach had uncurled itself some time during the conversation with Charlie and he took the opportunity to go straight to bed. He knew if he sat up any longer, he’d run through everything over and over and probably not sleep all night.
Harry laughed and jiggled Hugo slightly. “I don’t think I’ll make much difference. How’ve you been?”
“No, I don’t want to think about it, really,” Harry replied. “But I suppose I’ll have to. I don’t want to push him to talk about it if he’s not ready.”
“I can’t say it while you’re in this state,” Pansy said, making a face. “I want to, trust me. Do you think that is the reason?”
Draco sat down beside him, leaning across to put his own glass on the table. “Now, this present isn’t anything fancy,” he said warningly. “But I wanted to give you something.”
“Simple. Two boxes, one labelled left and the other labelled right,” Draco replied. “That way they won’t know whose arrangement they’re voting for.”
“And then a mixture of red, yellow and blue flowers,” Draco continued, his shoulder pressing against Harry’s. “Mostly yellow with pockets of red and blue.”
Draco nodded. “That works for the purpose of this, anyway,” he said. “So. Athletic. Tall? Short? In-between?”
“I know, don’t worry,” Harry said, returning the smile. “It always sounds cliché, but I would happily do it all over again. “
“She does. Don’t ever tell her though, it’ll only make her say ‘I told you so’.” Draco grinned. He pulled out his wand and flicked it at the wireless, smiling as it stuttered into life with a Christmas song filling the room.
For the next few minutes, neither of them spoke as the air grew warm around them and was filled with gasps and groans as they lost themselves to each other.
“That sounds like an excellent idea,” Draco said with a smile. “Do we know how much longer lunch will be?”
“You can say that again,” Harry said, making a face as he continued working the dried flowers into place. Pushing the last stem in, he picked up the white ribbon and wrapped it firmly around the base, tying a bow. “Alright. Done.”
“Well, when you put it like that, I see your point,” Ron said with a laugh. “Certainly sounds like an easier life than the Aurors anyway.”
“Yeah, Jordan,” George replied with a nod. “He’s alright, loves Quidditch. I think you’d get on with him.”
Harry knew that Narcissa was preparing to retire, despite only being in her early fifties, because she’d achieved her dream of owning and running the flower shop. Now that Lucius was home, he was sure that she must want to spend time with him that wasn’t dictated by a lunatic and that it made sense for the running of the shop to be left to Draco as a more welcome legacy than the one he’d almost been left by Lucius.
“Exactly. This lunch will be fine. Ginny is bringing Blaise, so you won’t even be too outnumbered,” Harry said firmly. “I think that Charlie might be coming as well, with Arlo.”
Harry’s lip twitched slightly. “How exactly were you sweeping? I’ve never known you to bump into the units while you sweep.”
“Bye, Hermione,” Harry said, giving her a wave as she headed back out of the shop, tugging the hood of her robes up as she went.
“Alright, alright, if you insist,” Harry said, holding out his hand to take the egg from Charlie. “Thank you.”
“Well, you’d think so but apparently we’re wrong about that,” Draco replied. “It’s a good job we can hide away and do them so no-one gets to witness the abominations we sometimes come up with.”
of all people. I don’t know if I should be offended that you’re choosing him and not me,” Charlie said, his grin widening.
“I wasn’t sure if you might have changed your mind,” Draco said, carefully climbing down the stepladder.
Once he’d realised that he was starting to see Draco as a potential boyfriend, he’d panicked. He and Draco worked together and had become very good friends over the years, but how could he possibly admit to Draco that he’d like more, given their history? They were finally in a good place and he didn’t want to do anything to upset the balance.
“Thank you. It’s not too bad,” Draco replied as he shut the door and turned to face Harry. “You can use magic here. The last occupant had everything converted so that magic could be used in place of that electricity stuff.”
lucky. It served us well as a headquarters, to be fair. But it was only after the war that I managed to get it redecorated properly.”
Harry laughed and pulled a notepad towards him, before taking a quill out of his apron pocket. “Yeah, I remember it well. Alright then, what exactly are you after and when for?”
Draco nodded. “Indeed he would. He viewed procreation much like a dog breeder would, I think. He wanted our bloodline to carry on and be the best it could be. He conveniently forgot to mention the fact that a lot of the Malfoy ancestors married half-bloods when he was spouting it all to me.”
reporters are just as vile as they were when we were at school,” Draco said, making a face. “I don’t think they’ll ever improve.”
Pansy laughed. “I’ll be honest, I think you’ve repaired a lot of damage that was done while we were at school. Not all by you, either.”
, of course it’s bad,” Draco said with a groan. “How could anything ever work between us, Pansy? We’ve been through so much and so much of it was bad.”
Draco nodded, looking around. “I think so. Everything is clean and protected, the sign is on the door… let’s get out of here.”
“Aren’t you?” Harry countered. “I’ve been thinking about the book ever since we were last here. On and off, I mean.”
“No, I didn’t get to that before you came back,” Harry said, glancing up at him. “If you want to check it?”
“Exactly, and this way, we take advantage of both markets,” Draco said. “Which reminds me. I had dinner with Pansy and Theo a while back and Pans mentioned something about Christmas displays.”
Harry paid the bill at the café and headed home in something of a daze. He didn’t remember how he got there, but it seemed like no time had passed at all and he was sitting on his sofa, staring into the fire which was crackling away. The room was warm, but Harry’s stomach felt like it was made of ice.
“Right, let’s get our food on the way in this time,” Harry said, steering Draco towards the counter. “Then we won’t waste any time.”
“It would help, but I suppose it’s not a necessity,” Draco replied with another shrug. “Unless they ask. But I don’t suppose they’ll want to know every little detail just now. Maybe decide on hair colour though.”
Harry nodded again. “Yeah. Yeah, alright. Thanks Charlie. I’m really sorry for bothering you and interrupting your evening with Arlo.”
Then, they hung it back in place and carried out their normal cleaning routine, making sure everything was clean and tidy for the duration of their break. Once they had finished, Draco pulled out his wand and cast a charm over the remaining stock of flowers that he knew would preserve them while they had a break. He was thankful that there wasn’t much left in terms of the fresh flower bouquets as they never quite handled the charm as well as the potted plants. A thought struck him and he turned to Harry. “We’ve only got a few bunches of flowers left. Do you want to take some for your friends?”
Draco tilted his head, considering Harry’s words for a moment. “Fair point. Alright, shall we have a little competition? You do one arrangement and I’ll do one, then the customers can decide which looks better.”
“I am, I just wasn’t ready for it to happen at a crowded New Year’s party,” Draco replied, making a face. “That is absolutely not the way I pictured breaking the news to my nearest and dearest.”
“Oh, you didn’t have to do that,” Molly replied, stepping backwards and gesturing for Harry to go inside. “But thank you.”
“No, I didn’t really know I had the date until lunchtime,” Harry admitted. “It’s a blind date, so I can’t tell you anything else because I don’t know anything else myself.”
“Aha, these will do,” Draco’s muffled voice came from the cupboard. He emerged into the shop once more, a non-identical pair of white vases in his hands. “We can temporarily change their colour so we can get an idea of what will look best.”
Harry groaned. “You could say that. Apparently my love life is, yet again, everyone’s top priority.”
“Me too,” Harry replied. He was currently behind the counter, wiping it over with a damp cloth to ensure any spills and dropped pollen were cleaned up. “Have you got any plans for tonight?”
“Fair play to you,” Charlie nodded, pointing his wand at the kettle to start it boiling. “I suppose I’m lucky I don’t need it after wrestling dragons all day.”
Harry laughed. “Not really. Unless you want me to be, anyway. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind you coming with me, given that Ginny brought Zabini.”
Draco looked down at the box, turning it in his hands slightly. “Well, I could only find an old ripped one, so I used a bit more magic on it to fix it up and make it look nice.”
Draco chuckled, rolling onto his side so that he could look at Harry. “Your face was a picture. Did it feel good?”
“What do you think you’ll be having for dinner tonight, then?” Draco asked as he moved around the shop, wiping the counters.
“Glad to hear it. I’d have had to give you a disciplinary if I thought you were doubting our ability,” Draco said with a laugh. “I think next week looks a little bit easier. No weddings.”
“Ah, uh, yeah,” Harry said, his cheeks flushing until they were the colour of the tulips that sat in a vase on the counter. “I’ve got a date.”
you end up with soil in your hair anyway?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “I didn’t want to ask earlier.”
Harry smiled to himself as he continued to sketch. The feeling of Draco’s shoulder against his own was comforting, in an odd sort of way. “There, what do you think?”
“I can’t believe you remembered. I don’t even remember saying it!” Harry exclaimed, picking up the fork to take a bite.
A few moments later, Draco returned carrying two bowls. He set one down in front of Harry. “There you go. Enjoy.”
“Hi Arlo, nice to meet you,” Harry said, giving Arlo a smile and reaching past Charlie to shake his hand. “I’m Harry.”
“We came through it, and that’s all I’m going to say about it. I don’t want to bring the mood crashing down,” Harry replied. “I’ve had a lovely time with you tonight.”
As he reached the top of the stairs, he quickened his pace and found himself at Harry’s bedroom door within seconds. Hesitating briefly, he pushed it open and immediately let out a cry of surprise. Harry was laid, unmoving on the bed. “Harry?”
“You didn’t,” Draco said. “You took a vial of Draught of Living Death by mistake. I had to get Granger to bring the antidote, because for some unfathomable reason, you didn’t have any of that in the house.”
Draco nodded, sucking the chocolate off his fork as he pulled it back out of his mouth. “Yes. I’m glad you like it.”
“This won’t take long,” George said, placing both hands on the counter in front of Harry. “What are you doing on Saturday?”
Charlie frowned. “I’ll never understand the mentality of people who do that. Oh! Harry, this is Arlo,” he said, his eyes widening briefly.
Harry began piling food onto his fork with relish. He turned to Ron. “It’s a shame Ginny couldn’t be here, isn’t it? She’d love having Charlie’s boyfriend here.”
“Exactly,” Draco laughed, turning off the tap and lifting the bucket out of the sink. “It’s not the first Valentine’s night I’ve spent alone and I’m sure it won’t be the last. I’ve got used to it over the years.”
“Absolutely not. We can talk about your desire to abandon me for three months later,” Draco sniffed, quickening his speed as they reached the table so that Harry couldn’t reply. “Hello Mother. Father.”
Draco celebrated by punching the air before he turned his attention to what he could say. “Alright, I spy with my little eye something beginning with T.”
going to get the chocolate fudge cake, but when I got there they barely had any left so I thought I’d get something else.”
Draco chuckled. “Yes, they are. Let’s order,” he added, nodding to where the café assistant was waiting to take their order.
Molly was on her feet, staring down at her plate in shock and as Harry looked over, he could see why. In the middle of her pie was a live baby chicken, chirping away happily.
“I always forget how much I like that about you,” Draco said, grinning against Harry’s collarbone where he was planting soft kisses. “The impatience is always something to behold.”
“A table is much easier, though,” Draco said, carrying the plates across to the table. He set Harry’s down in front of him before sitting down with his own. “Please feel free to use the napkin as a bib. I will be.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Ginny said, waving a hand. “You could have been a pro if you hadn’t joined the Aurors, you know that.”
“No, I’m happy with things the way they are,” Harry replied. “It’s nice not having to share you. What about you?”
Finally, Harry rolled off Draco, breathing hard as he collapsed next to him on the bed. “Well,” he panted. “Was it worth it?”
Draco flushed slightly. “Thank you. I’m glad to hear you think that. I’ve worked hard to put those days behind me since we left school.”
“It is nice to have someone worry about me, in a way, but I’m just… I’m not used to being the sole focus of one person, never mind a whole group of them,” Harry replied. “It gets tiring. So when Draco offered, I jumped at the chance.”
Harry laughed. “Well yes, if you must know. I knew we were coming here so I put a little bit of Sleekeazy on it. Not too much, mind. I wanted you to recognise me.”
Harry sighed internally with relief, hoping that his face wasn’t giving anything away. “Yeah, he had quite a different experience to us. Although that would be true of anyone, I suppose.”
Draco laughed again, shaking his head. “In my defence, I didn’t really start making it until after we started working together, so although I
“Excellent choices,” Harry said with a grin. “Right. Let me just get some greenery to go in with them. The ferns always look good mixed in with the roses. And some Gypsophila. Do you want it in a vase or just wrapped?”
“I’ve been going out with Draco, to–” Harry began before Charlie cut him off with a disbelieving laugh.
“No, I haven’t,” Draco said. “I promise you, I haven’t. I wanted to help you out, and as the months have gone by, I’ve enjoyed it more and more. I’ve actually looked forward to coming here.”
“No, she’ll be happy, I think,” Draco replied. “She, ah, she knew how I felt about you before you did.”
“You and I have a date on Saturday,” Harry said, taking a sip from one of the cups of coffee he was holding.
“Please don’t ask me to recount that experience,” Harry groaned. “There were at least a thousand white roses. At least.”
“I can’t either. My life might have changed somewhat since last year, but I’m still not really fond of the crowded restaurants and clubs on Valentine’s Day,” Draco replied, pausing in his sweeping. “Unless you’d really like to go somewhere like that?”
“Ha-ha,” Ron replied sarcastically, the tips of his ears red. “If that was the case, they’d all be for you.”
Harry snorted. “Thanks very much. And no, for your information, I didn’t call it a tune. I was just humming, if that’s alright?”
“Yes. Very slowly,” Harry said firmly. “I’m not interested in rushing into anything. But I am enjoying getting to know him.”
“Probably. It just seemed like it would be fun,” Draco said. “I don’t go out often, as you know, but New Year’s Eve is always a totally different kettle of fish.”
Before long they had reached the end of the chapter and Harry turned to look at Draco. “It’s getting good, isn’t it?”
! Oh, yes, hello Arlo,” Molly exclaimed after a moment. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” She hurried forward, her hand outstretched.
Draco snorted as he picked up the sweeping brush to give the floor a quick once over before he could mop. “Not this year. You?”
The bell above the door of Paperwhite’s Petals rang for the final time as the last customer exited – a man who’d come in five minutes till closing desperate for a last-minute Valentine’s bouquet. Draco turned the lock and flipped the ‘open’ sign to ‘closed’ in one swift motion. Valentine’s Day was always one of their busiest days and, as usual, they’d had a steady stream of customers from the moment they’d opened the door that morning. It was finally five o’clock and they were sold out of every last rose in the building.
“Probably after Easter,” Harry said, frowning slightly as he realised they hadn’t seen a date. “I need to double check that with Draco, actually. We didn’t decide on any specific date.”
Ron groaned softly. “I told him to take a sleeping potion, not to put himself into a coma,” he muttered. “He was knackered the other night after work.”
“Much later than school,” Harry said, also shifting in his seat slightly. “Ginny and I made a go of things for a couple of years after school, but somewhere around my twentieth birthday things changed.”
“I know we are, but nothing can happen between us. I don’t want to ruin all of the good work we’ve done,” Draco said with a sigh.
“Don’t worry, I will. Right, I’ll see you when I get back,” Draco replied with a grin and a wink as he headed out of the shop.
Harry laughed and did as he was told, settling himself back on the sofa and shifting closer to Draco so that they could both share the book comfortably. “Ready?”
Harry nodded. “I am. It might have taken me a while to figure things out, but yeah. I’m happy. But can you do me a favour?”
“He must have a reason for coming then?” Harry asked as he and Molly made their way into the kitchen where he knew the rest of the Weasleys would be.
Molly smiled and nodded. “Apparently we did, yes. I’m sorry,” she said before turning to Draco. “So, Draco. Welcome. It’s nice to finally meet the man who’s made Harry so happy over these last few months.”
The following evening, Harry arrived at Draco’s flat at five o’clock on the dot. He’d Apparated rather than taking the Floo as he’d forgotten to check whether it would be alright for him to Floo directly into Draco’s flat. He paused for a moment on the doorstep, looking up at the building in front of him. It was more modern than he’d expected, although the building itself was clearly an old structure. On the face of it, the building was a house, but Harry knew better. There was a big bay window facing out onto the street and a wide stone staircase led up to the door, which was painted in dark green with a bright brass door knocker in the centre. He glanced at the neighbouring properties, wondering if Draco had some sort of charm set up so that any visiting wizards could Apparate in and out without breaking the Statute of Secrecy. He lifted his hand to knock.
Draco snorted. “That does make me feel a little bit better, yes. But it can wait a bit longer while we have coffee.”
amazing. Don’t be shy about putting food on your plate either, there’s always plenty and if you don’t take what she deems is enough, Molly
“Oh, how awful,” Molly said with a sigh, spearing a slice of carrot with her fork. “The poor boy has been through enough without adding gold diggers to the list!”
“But you don’t want to choose. You said so yourself,” Draco pointed out. “Maybe you’re just not ready to be thinking about settling down?”
“Excellent!” George exclaimed, rubbing his hands together. “Angelina will be sorry she’s missed this one.”
“No, one each,” Harry laughed, giving Draco a light shove. “I didn’t think I needed to be that specific.”
“As long as you’re sure then,” Harry said, giving him a smile. “I will try and make sure they’re kept to a minimum, just in case.”
“Okay, here you go,” Harry said, walking around from behind the counter to hand her a quill. “Don’t tell Draco.”
“I’ll mention it to Harry tomorrow. See what he thinks,” Draco said, rubbing at his chin with one hand.
“Alright. I spy with my little eye something beginning with… “ Harry began, pausing as he gazed around. “P.”
“But why did you need to arrange something? Why couldn’t he just turn them down and stay at home?” Pansy asked, a frown creasing her brow.
“Well, be prepared for more questions from Mum and Hermione later. They’re dying to know who he is,” Ron said as a large pie dish floated it’s way to the table.
Charlie’s frown deepened. “But how do you know that? How do you know that he doesn’t feel the same?”
“I didn’t. I just assumed from what you told me about your prospective date that it would not go well,” Draco replied with a shrug.
“I would like to hold you to that,” Harry said, popping the last bit of the treacle tart into his mouth. “And if they do it warm, that would be even better.”
arrange something that means he’s busy when they wanted him to go out with this latest one. We’re going to the bookshop café, we’ll read a book and have some coffee. That’s it.”
“It’s stupid. I should have been honest when I first realised,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I didn’t mean to lie to you about it.”
The next few moments were silent as they all continued to study their menus. Eventually, they had all decided on what they wanted to eat and the server appeared to take their order. Harry’s thigh, disappointingly, remained untickled and he wondered if Draco had had his fun.
Harry coughed as he took another drink of water and Ron thumped him on the back. “Thanks,” he choked. “No, I suppose they don’t,” he added, glancing at Molly.
“Alright, when you put it like that,” Harry replied, frowning again. “I suppose I can. Maybe we should have just met at one of our houses.”
“If only everyone thought like you,” Harry said with a chuckle. “It would make my life much easier.”
“No I didn’t. Not because there’s anything wrong with you, before you say it,” Harry replied firmly. “Just because they’d wonder why I hadn’t said anything about you sooner. This way, all they know is I have plans.”
They fell silent for a few minutes as they continued to drink their coffee, listening to the soft crackling of the wood burner.
“He’s my boyfriend,” Charlie said, looking at Molly who hadn’t said a word yet. “I wanted him to meet you all.”
“No, not pansies. Pansy!” Draco said, pointing across the road to where he could see Pansy hurrying along on her way back to her office.
Harry inhaled deeply and made his way to the Leaky Cauldron to use the Floo. He hadn’t imagined it would feel so strange to walk away from Draco on Christmas Eve.
Draco nodded before glancing around and then quickly leaning over to capture Harry’s lips in a heated kiss. “See you then,” he murmured as they parted, then turned on his heel and headed for the Apparition point.
Draco nodded, one of the sandwiches already in his hand. “Absolutely. Now, these display units. I want to move everything that’s in the window over to this side,” he said, pointing to his left. “And everything that’s on that side to the middle. Everything in the middle is to go to the other side.”
Harry shook his head. “No, we didn’t. We managed to persuade him to go to an Italian restaurant that was still open for food, instead. He drank tonic water all night.”
They both settled back into their chairs, books propped open as they began to read. They were quiet as they were absorbed into the world that the author had created, the only sounds being the turning of a page or the occasional sound of one or the other of them sipping their coffee.
“I could hear what you were saying,” Harry repeated, giving her a look. “Charlie is right. I am capable of sorting my own love life out.”
Draco nodded, opening a drawer and pulling out two forks before carrying them and his plate through to the table. He passed one of the forks to Harry as he sat down.
“Your father and I were in our twenties when we had you, and we’d been married two or three years prior to that,” Narcissa said simply. “It is not unheard of.”
Harry snorted, then coughed as he choked on the mouthful of food he was eating. “Let me guess, there was washing on it at the time?”
“Yes, there’s plenty of time,” Draco replied. “I’ve just got the sauce on cooking at the moment with a charm on it to prevent it boiling over or burning.”
“I know, but I think I enjoy the whole experience of coming here rather than just enjoying reading the book,” Harry replied, grinning. “I like the discussion.”
“Let’s just try and ignore them,” Draco said. “Or maybe we could pay the restaurant to kick them out?”
“Alright, come on then,” Draco said with a smile of his own. He took Harry by the hand and led him from the lounge to the bedroom.
“Ah. He must have been a wizard though?” Draco replied cautiously. “To be attracted to the idea of going out with you?”
“Ah, the jasmines,” Harry smiled. “Yeah, they’re one of my favourites. Well, here you go, your bouquet is finished.”
After he’d paid, he made his way to their usual table. However, it wasn’t empty as it usually was. Instead, as he approached, he recognised the back of Hermione’s head. Her hair was less bushy these days, but it was still instantly recognisable to Harry. “Hermione?”
He stood up and strode over to the fireplace. He lifted the tin of Floo powder off the mantelpiece and took a pinch before returning the tin to it’s spot. He threw the powder into the flames and hoped Pansy was available for a call.
“No, definitely not,” Harry said, shaking his head. “It’s nice not to have to worry about who they’re setting me up with.”
“Of course. We were out tonight and we were talking and, well, I told him the truth,” Harry said. “He didn’t take it well.”
Draco smiled, shuffling close to Harry and resting his head on the pillow, one arm draped across Harry’s stomach.
“No, seriously, I know that Mother didn’t hire you because you’re Harry Potter. She hired you because she knew you’d work hard,” Draco continued. “The fact you are Harry Potter might have helped at times, but believe me, if the bouquets you made were shit, you’d know about it.”
“I’m glad I’m not the only one then,” Harry said with a chuckle. “I know this happens every year, but it always surprises me.”
“Here,” he said as he walked back into the shop, shoving one of the cups into Harry’s hand. “And I got us bacon sandwiches today.”
“It does,” Draco said with a smile. “I was hoping you’d be doing roast beef. At least now I won’t have to hex Harry tomorrow.”
“It’s a good job I’m not helping you avoid marriage,” Draco said. “That would look a bit more weird than two friends having coffee together in a bookshop café.”
“Probably,” Draco replied thoughtfully. “It’s not something we’ve discussed, but I suppose there will likely be a market for them, won’t there?”
“I thought you were going to tell them you already had a date?” Draco asked, frowning as he shrugged off his cloak. “Come on, shift out of the way.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry said, nodding. “Have you eaten? I could do you a healthy fry-up too… although it will be without eggs now.”
Harry nodded slowly. “Alright, I suppose I can give it a go. I hate the thought of losing his friendship most of all. Who would have predicted that, eh?”
A few moments later, he found himself looking into the kitchen of Charlie’s cottage in Romania. Charlie and Arlo were both gazing at the fireplace with concern. Charlie’s brow was furrowed.
“I couldn’t do anything to help, Rose only wanted Hermione,” Ron replied with a wave of his hand. “Are you going to tell me
“No, it seems like this year has passed in a flash,” Draco replied, fixing the padlock to the gate. “It hasn’t been a bad year though.”
“I’ll say,” Draco said with a sigh. “Sorry I disappeared. I didn’t want to stay and cause more of a scene.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I did not. I had a feeling he was seeing someone, but he hasn’t said anything. He’s been very happy lately.”
“I’ll be quite sad when we’ve finished this book, you know,” Draco said as he settled back against the cushions once more and picked up the book. “I can’t believe it’s kept us busy for almost a year, though.”
Draco laughed. “Their family meals sound a lot more eventful than Malfoy ones. They’ve always been quite staid affairs.”
Harry continued into the back room and Draco could hear the cupboard door being opened and left to shut itself with a bang before Harry appeared behind the counter. “Isn’t the delivery here yet? How are we meant to get everything ready when they’re late?”
“No,” Draco agreed. “I would say not. I think they’ll appreciate the extra touch if you get some sparkly ribbon.”
“There’s not really much call for a roast dinner when you live alone,” Draco replied with a shrug. “Don’t you find that?”
“No room for treacle tart?” Draco asked, one eyebrow raised as a smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.
“Only if you get time. But it’s not essential that it’s done today,” Draco replied with a shrug. “We haven’t got the arrangements made up properly yet, so it’s not really needed until they’re done.”
“Yeah, it is, but I like that we did,” Harry said. “I think these presents are more meaningful than anything we could buy from a shop. I mean, I did buy this one from a shop but you know what I mean.”
“Will do. Alright, I’m finished here. I’ll put it in the back until they get here to collect it,” Harry said, picking up the arrangement he’d been working on to carry it into the back room. “Do you want anything else while I’m out?”
“I doubt it,” Draco said, shaking his head. He picked the bucket up and carried it into the back room to pour the water out. “She might own this place, but she knows that
“Right… but you think these are good?” Draco said, giving him an odd look as he gestured to the drawings.
On Sunday the fourteenth of February, Draco flipped the sign on the door to ‘closed’ at five o’clock and turned to face Harry. “I am exhausted.”
Harry laughed again. “Of course, but you’ll have to do the talking. I don’t speak a word of French.”
Harry shook his head slightly as he allowed himself to be chivvied along. He knew they wouldn’t get much work done this afternoon, but he had to admit that it was nice to have a bit of downtime after such a busy couple of weeks.
Draco snorted. “Alright then, let’s go. Do you want to get sandwiches on the way in or should we find a seat first?”
“You’re telling me. I still remember Fred challenging me to a flying competition after Sunday lunch once. Mum was
“Well, yeah, I suppose so,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Luckily most people have changed their opinions.”
He wasted no time and Apparated, but not to his flat. Narcissa greeted him as he walked into the kitchen at Malfoy Manor.
By the time Saturday rolled around, both Harry and Draco were exhausted. On top of all of the orders they had to make up on a daily basis, they had been inundated with walk-in customers requesting all manner of bouquets and arrangements. For the last two days, neither of them had managed to leave the shop to get lunch and they had been grateful when Narcissa had brought them some sandwiches.
Draco shook his head. “No, thank you. BDSM is so far from being my thing that I might as well be a… a… Muggle.”
Draco shook his head again. “No, don’t worry about anything like that. I’m sure I’ll have some wine or something in the house that we can drink. Just bring yourself.”
“I know, you’re right,” Harry said with a sigh. “But I am really alright with being on my own. I quite like the occasional date but I don’t feel like I’m missing anything at the minute.”
The more he thought about it, the more he realised that he wanted to visit Bookworms and Brews again with Draco, and that could surely only happen on one of their fake dates. And so, it was with that thought in mind that Harry washed up his plate and headed upstairs to take a bath. He knew what he was going to do from here.
“What? What do you mean? It’s my day off,” Harry protested, turning his head to look at Draco. He frowned and threw one arm out, fumbling on the bedside table for his glasses and shoving them onto his nose when he found them.
“I know. I promise you, I am fine,” Draco said. “I am very happy with my life at the moment. Everything is going well.”
“Well I was walking backwards and pulling it after me and then I bumped into the freestanding shelving unit,” Harry said, wrapping his cloak around himself. “The Peace Lilies on the top shelf were a bit close to the edge and, well, I’m sure you can work the rest out.”
“I know, but I’m supposed to be going out with Draco this weekend,” Harry sighed. “I want to be able to stay awake to actually
Draco smiled again. “Me too,” he replied, heading into the back room and putting the bouquets on the worktop. Then he made his way back into the shop with the sweeping brush.
“His friends keep setting him up on blind dates,” Draco said patiently. “But so far, they’ve all turned out terribly. He doesn’t really want to settle down with anyone right now, but they won’t stop arranging dates for him. So I said
“That’ll be the hardest part,” Harry replied with a frown. “I don’t know what I can tell them without accidentally telling them it’s you. Because then they’ll assume that you and I are seeing each other and it’ll just get… weird.”
“Well, I don’t know that I’d call Barnard Park delightful, but it’ll be a nice walk,” Harry laughed. “And we’ll have a nice lunch at the end of it.”
“No, probably not,” Harry said, making a face too. “They’re the lowest of the low. Some of them, anyway.”
Turning the taps on the bath, he put the plug in and moved to the cabinet to select his bubble bath. He felt like he could do with a relaxing bath, with something to help him sleep, so he picked up a bottle of lavender-scented Radox and poured some under the running water. He smiled as the smell of lavender filled the room. As the bath continued to fill, the bubbles climbing higher, Harry stripped off his clothes and threw them into his washing basket. Finally, there was enough water in the bath and he turned the taps off. Dipping one toe into the water, he tested the temperature before climbing in.
Before he could wonder anymore, Draco popped his head into the room again. “Food is ready if you’d like to come through.”
When they parted, Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s. “We have time for some breakfast here before the key activates again. Fancy a croissant?”
“Oh good,” Harry said. “You’ll be able to do the baby one first thing then, and I’ll do the birthday one after. Do you think gold ribbon for the bow?”
“Oh, sorry,” Harry said, turning back to the counter. “Two chicken salad sandwiches and two lattes please.”
“I think we’ll be alright,” Harry said, glancing into the shop. “We’ll just see what looks good. We’ve got all the colours we’ll need so we must be able to come up with something that looks half decent.”
“It’s all written down. Go on, get out there and get started,” Draco said, gesturing to the notepad. “I don’t want to see you until it’s done.”
“Nothing fancy. It’s our favourite place to go,” Harry replied, smiling. “It’ll probably be just the two of us, all cosy. We’ll have coffee and maybe a sandwich before we head off home.”
“I’m supposed to be a brave Gryffindor though,” Harry said with a chuckle. “I don’t think people would have had as much faith in me during the war if they knew how much I’d struggle with things like that.”
“Absolutely,” Draco replied. “Our midnight kiss was interrupted so I’d quite like to try again now.”
Arriving at Grimmauld Place, Harry unlocked the door and stepped inside. The door had barely closed behind them when Draco wrapped his arms around Harry from behind, pressing light kisses to his neck. “I thought we were walking home and getting takeaway?”
“Oh, you know, just a date with the hottest man I know,” Harry replied casually. “He’s taking me somewhere nice.”
“I agree,” Harry said. “Hopefully we won’t get to a really interesting point before we have to stop.”
“That would have been the perfect time to talk to her then,” Draco said, looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “You could have complained properly. With swear words and everything.”
“Well, I’m not much better to be fair,” Draco said with a sigh. “It’s been years since my last serious relationship. Not that I’m actively looking for one. I must admit I’m quite happy as I am.”
“Alright. I just need some greenery to go in with this lot and then I’ll join you,” Draco said, glancing down at his trug.
“Yes, of course,” Draco nodded, putting his coffee down and picking up his copy of the book. “Let’s see what we make of this.”
Harry smiled and shook his head. “It’s fine, honestly. I’ve got some for Hermione, Ginny and the others, too.”
Draco snorted softly as he took a bite of his steak, and Harry wondered how he could be so composed while carrying out his teasing.
“Paris, yes,” Draco smiled. “I thought we could start the day by French kissing in France. Sorry we missed the sunrise, I didn’t think you’d appreciate being woken up while it was still dark.”
Harry laughed. “I suppose not, no. At least you managed to change it successfully, anyway. I remember Colin Creevey trying to change them and making it worse.”
“That chocolate cake looks divine, don’t you think?” Draco replied, pointing at the large gooey chocolate cake that sat in the refrigerated glass cabinet.
Draco flushed again and ducked his head slightly. “I’m glad you think so. I would be glad to make it for you again now.”
just because you are in a bad mood,” Draco muttered, not looking at Harry. “This has been arranged for weeks.”
“It was good to see you,” Harry said, smiling. “I hope you’ll make the next family dinner, though. I need someone else on my side. Charlie wasn’t enough.”
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged, making a face at Hugo and grinning as the little boy giggled at him. “I don’t know. I haven’t thought that far ahead.”
Draco shook his head. “Absolutely not. I do, however, think it might be best if we end our evening here. I’m not really in the mood to carry on with the book right now.”
“A new assistant at Hermione’s office, apparently,” Harry sighed. “She thinks I’ll get on well with them. But, honestly, I just can’t bring myself to trust her judgement anymore.”
“I should think so. Lunch is normally somewhere between twelve and one, so I’ll have plenty of time,” Harry said. “If that’s okay?”
“Molly will be the same. I’m only going for lunch, I think,” Harry replied. “I know they usually have games on the afternoon, but I wasn’t planning on staying because it would make the teams uneven.”
“A cat. I can’t walk a dog, can I? So a cat is the only real option,” Draco said. “I’ve looked into it. I’m going to adopt the cat that’s been in the shelter for the longest and it will come and live here with us.”
“A lot has changed over the years,” Harry said. “Whoever would have thought we would be friends with some of those Slytherins, eh?”
“Talk to Potter!” He heard Pansy call as he pulled his head back out of the fire. One thing was for certain, he was
Charlie watched him for a moment, chewing quietly on one of the biscuits. “So, what is it that you needed to chat about?” he asked, swallowing.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked immediately, noticing the frown. “Surely Rosa Lee didn’t mess up your sandwich?”
“Of course. I think we should be alright though,” Draco replied, reaching for some of the flowers. “This will be a good way to tell if we’ve estimated right, anyway.”
“Right, I’ll see you tomorrow,” Harry said, turning and walking backwards away from Draco. “You don’t need me in early, do you?”
They continued to make small talk as they ate and before long, their plates were empty. Harry leaned back in his chair, a soft groan escaping. “I think that I have eaten far too much today.”
“Remember Theodore Nott from school?” Draco asked. He was slowly working his way towards the counter, mopping as he went. “Him.”
Alice led them along to the meeting room, letting them get settled before leaving the room to fetch Mr McGregor.
“Very well. I’ll be back in a moment,” Pansy replied, disappearing through the door that led to the kitchen.
Harry knocked on the door of The Burrow, a bottle of wine in his hand. He didn’t normally bring anything to lunch, but he thought he’d make an exception this week.
Harry laughed. “I have to hand it to you. I did enjoy this evening more than any of the dates I’ve been on in the last few weeks.”
“Stop it at once, the pair of you,” Narcissa said. “We are here to have a nice meal. Now, we took the liberty of getting a bottle of wine already. We just need to order our food, so perhaps we should look at the menu.”
Harry chuckled. “The rules of the game are easy. Playing the game is a bit harder. You can give up if you want, and I’ll tell you the answer.”
Alice hovered in the doorway for a few moments until Draco looked over at her. “We’d like to take him, please.”
Draco returned the kiss and slowly climbed off Harry and took his hands, pulling him into a standing position.
“Well I’m not the one choosing, am I? Maybe that’s the problem,” Harry muttered, taking a very large bite of his bacon sandwich.
Draco smiled. “I know. It’s alright, I appreciate that you worry about me. But this is fine. I do need to get something to eat before I meet him though.”
“Oh, it was a tie in the end,” Harry replied, laughing. “Although if you ask Draco, I’m sure he’ll say that he won. Don’t believe him though.”
“Listen, Harry, if you really like him then I think you’d be mad not to go for it. But, having said that, I can understand why you’re hesitant. I don’t really know what you want me to say…” Charlie said softly.
“I didn’t want to continue reading it without you,” Harry admitted, his cheeks slowly turning pink. “It’s our thing, so it wouldn’t have been right to come on my own.”
Draco laughed, reaching for their cloaks from the rack. “Wait until you sit on my sofas. They’re even better.”
“Which is absolutely fine,” Draco said, taking a sip from his glass. “You just need to know that enjoying it shouldn’t mean telling me about it.”
“Yes, go through. You can tell me how your date went the other night,” Pansy said, giving him a sly look as she gestured for him to walk.
By the time Saturday arrived, the weather had taken a turn for the worst and it had rained on and off for a few days which meant that the footfall past the shop had decreased as people had opted to stay inside during the frequent showers. Which had given Harry and Draco plenty of time to work on the pre-booked wedding centrepieces and they had all but completed the order.
“Sort of, yeah. I mean, they don’t stick to it religiously, but if they have people over for dinner they tend to,” Harry replied. “Molly doesn’t like to repeat a meal that someone has had before. Last time I had dinner there, we had a roast chicken dinner.”
“I’ll have to think of something to make for you. But that’s a job for later,” Harry replied. “So, I was wondering, are there Disillusionment Charms or something on this place? In case any Muggles get too close?”
“Are you sure that this will do?” He asked, turning slightly in both directions while looking in the mirror. “I’ve never dressed so casually for a lunch before.”
When they were done, Draco got up and went to get their books, bringing them back and handing one to Harry. “We could borrow these, you know. They’re from the library section.”
As they entered the kitchen, Harry blinked in surprise. “I don’t know why, but I didn’t expect this much food.”
The bell above the door rang clearly as Harry entered the shop and he winced. It always sounded so much louder at this time of the morning. Stepping away, he let the door swing shut behind him and he made his way through the shop to the back room.
“He never really seemed to like being a teacher,” Harry said. “Even when it came to you Slytherins, he didn’t seem to actually want to be at Hogwarts sometimes.”
“I knew it was going to rain today, I just didn’t think it would be this bad,” Harry replied, his chin propped up on one hand as he gazed out of the window.
Harry laughed. “Honestly, if you never got me anything for the rest of my life, I’d be happy because today has been perfect. How did you decide where to go?”
Draco nodded. “I had to duck into a couple of other places and cast a few charms to disillusion myself before continuing on my way.”
“Well, we haven’t been on a ‘date’ for a good few weeks now,” Draco replied with a shrug. “Have they stopped trying to set you up?”
Draco shook his head. “No, I only got here a few minutes ago. I would have been here sooner, but there were people following me,” he replied with a slight frown.
Harry opened the door a crack and peeped out, before slipping through it and running down to the Floo.
“He tried to claim that he meant to say ‘till’ but he actually said ‘tile’,” Harry said, shaking his head. “There is no way he’s having that as a win.”
“Anyway, when do you want to start going through the receipts?” Harry asked. “I’m going to have dinner at The Burrow tonight, but we could make a start if it’s quiet this afternoon?”
Arriving home for the night, Harry deposited the bag from the local Chinese takeaway on the kitchen table. He’d made a spur of the moment decision after leaving Draco that he couldn’t really be bothered to cook that evening, so instead of taking the Floo straight home, he’d walked into London and detoured past the Chinese takeaway to pick up some chicken chow mein.
“Harry, please don’t be upset with us. We just worry about you,” Molly said kindly. “I don’t want you to end up watching all of your friends getting married and having children while you’re… left on the shelf.”
Harry took the summoned jug and filled his glass back up, as well as Draco’s. “We’ll be alright in a few minutes. Then we can at least relocate to the sofa.”
Within minutes, he was stepping out of the fireplace in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. He took off his cloak and headed into the hall to put it away in the cupboard before coming back into the kitchen to make himself something to eat. He pulled some bacon and sausages out of the fridge, intending on making himself a healthy fry-up. He turned to get some eggs when the Floo chimed, making him jump and drop the box on the floor.
The last weeks of February passed fairly uneventfully. After the rush of Valentine’s Day, business was always a little bit slower, which Draco was grateful for. It gave them a chance to think about whether they wanted to redesign the layout of the shop, whether they wanted to bring any new stock in and which of their range they wanted to phase out. It was something they did every year, but it never got any easier.
“Well it would be something to do,” Harry replied, shrugging one shoulder. “Either that or we sit here like this for the next three hours.”
The room lapsed into a comfortable silence as they finished their dessert, including a second helping for Harry.
Harry laughed again. “Alright then. We’ll come back to that. Let’s get this finished so we can go back to the book.”
Harry grinned. “One day I’ll get you all in the same room, don’t you worry about that. Now, are we going to finish our game?”
“No, no, you stay there,” Draco shook his head. “It’s literally just plating up that I’ll be doing. Just… relax.”
Ron nodded, grinning. “Yeah, he’s been so close and then he finally cracked it – no pun intended – at the weekend. He was quite disappointed that we had roast beef on Sunday. He wanted to surprise her with it then.”
partly true. At the beginning, I was just happy to have something that kept everyone from setting me up. But the more ‘dates’ we went on, the more I realised that it wasn’t just that that I liked. I liked spending time with you, I liked reading the books, and I liked coming here. When my friends stopped setting me up, I realised that if they stopped forever, it meant I wouldn’t get to enjoy all of that with you anymore. So I did the first thing that came to mind. I lied and told you that Ginny had tried to set me up. And then I just kept on lying.”
Harry couldn’t help smiling as he cut himself a piece of the treacle tart and lifted it to his mouth. He sniffed it and gave a soft groan before he stuck the fork into his mouth. He chewed slowly, savouring the taste before swallowing. He looked at Draco, who was watching him anxiously. “This is amazing. I can’t believe you made this.”
Ron shrugged. “You know what people can be like. Anyway, what about you? How did your date go on Saturday?”
with it,” Ron said, shaking his head. “I just didn’t expect it to be someone who sounds so… normal.”
Draco nodded, looking pleased with himself. “Yes. We’ve got time to eat and then we can take a sunset gondola ride along the grand canal and take in the view of the Rialto Bridge.”
“That’s absolutely fine,” Draco said, picking his mug up to take a drink. “I do like all the fancy drinks, but I don’t think you can go wrong with a nice plain coffee, do you?”
Draco broke the kiss once more, pressing their foreheads together. “Harry, what are you doing to me? I don’t do things like this…”
“Alright, sounds good,” Harry replied, nodding. “How come your mum never gets involved with this bit, anyway? I’ve always wondered.”
“Thank you. I’ll see you at work on Monday,” Draco said as he stood up. “Early start if you don’t mind.”
“I don’t know either,” Harry sighed. “I just had to talk to someone about this whole thing and you were the only person I wanted to talk to. I couldn’t have talked to Ron about it.”
“Draco! You could have brought me this any time in the last ten years,” Harry exclaimed, his eyes wide. “Why didn’t you tell me about this talent of yours?”
“It’s all fun and games in the shop, Pansy,” Draco said lightly. “You should drop in one day, find out for yourself.”
Draco threw a stack of buckets to Harry with a grin. “You do those three boxes and I’ll do these ones.”
“Have you got any plans tonight?” Draco asked with a smirk as they picked up their sweeping brushes.
“I suppose it’s not unheard of,” Draco mused. “In fact, I’m sure we’ve had mistletoe appear before when we’ve had flowers from that supplier. It’s always a task to make sure you don’t end up under it with a customer if it appears above the counter.”
“We suggest not closer than two feet away,” the Healer by Draco’s bedside replied. “We have not yet managed to stabilise the curse.”
Draco put his wand away and gestured for Harry to sit down while he went back into the kitchen to pick up his own plate again. “Do you want cutlery?”
Harry smiled as he hung their cloaks in the cupboard. “She’ll be thrilled that you think so. Did you really enjoy it?”
“I’m only joking,” Draco said, pulling out his wallet and counting out the money to pay for their purchases. He handed it to the assistant and told him to keep the change, before turning to Harry. “The usual alcove?”
“Alright. You go and get yourself ready. I shall have the house-elves prepare a quick meal,” Narcissa said with a smile. “Although I don’t know why you decided you had to come here to get ready instead of going home?”
“Draco!” Pansy shrieked, pushing Theo backwards and pulling her thin shirt back down from where it had ridden up. “This is
“Hm, I suppose I can forgive you. It’s not like you’re lying after all,” Draco replied, smiling. “Yes. Let’s see how much further we can get. What time do you want to be home for?”
George frowned thoughtfully. “Now there’s a question,” he said, tapping his chin with one finger. “He must be about twenty by now.”
company over that of your friends ,” Draco replied, giving Harry a sideways look. “Not that I’m complaining. You’ve got me out of the house more than normal.”
Draco nodded again. “I think we should. Other shops are starting to sell Christmas things now, so we don’t want to be left behind.”
“Excellent! Should we get the books first?” Harry asked, half out of his seat already. “We can read a chapter and then reward ourselves with cake.”
“Not right now,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Maybe later. This cake is far too good to waste time talking about things I remember.”
“Well, no-one, I suppose,” Harry said, taking a bite of sponge. “That doesn’t mean you can’t get it wrong.”
“Absolutely. Did you see his eyes? They remind me of yours,” Draco said with a smile. “Well, the colour, anyway.”
“They’re people like Dad,” Ron said, shrugging. “Fascinated by Muggles and their ways, and they think that bewitching something like an ironing board will make it better.”
Harry laughed again and gave Draco a light squeeze. “If it helps, they still don’t know it’s you that will be turning up.”
Hermione smiled but didn’t laugh. “We didn’t want to assume in case we were wrong. We knew you’d tell us when you were ready. Of course, we were prepared to meet ‘Adam’, too.”
“I think it might be, yes,” Draco nodded, pulling his cloak around himself a bit tighter. “I’m certainly not complaining though. She didn’t go for the cheap ones.”
“Oh, you’re welcome, Harry,” Molly replied with a tired smile from her armchair beside the fireplace. “Perhaps we’ll get to meet your young man in the new year?”
“You are more than welcome,” Draco said with a smile. “Come in any time and we’ll sort you out. Do you have any ideas of what you want?”
Draco laughed. “I’ll be back in a few minutes, don’t worry,” he said, sliding off the sofa and standing up. “Anything in particular?”
“George, hi,” Harry said, deftly wrapping a bouquet of brightly coloured tulips in cellophane and securing it with a bit of tape. “What can I do for you? I’m on my own, so it might take me a little while.”
“I’m pleased for them too, honestly,” Draco said. “It was just a surprise. I wonder if Pansy knows…”
He didn’t have to dwell on it for too long, as Draco was soon back and handing Harry a cup of coffee.
“Good point. Anyway, come and grab a seat before Charlie gets here,” Ron said, shifting slightly in his seat.
“You’ll find someone,” Arlo said, leaning in again. “Probably without realising it. That’s what happened for us. It came to the day I was supposed to leave and I just couldn’t. Not when I knew I might not get a chance to go back. So I contacted my reserve and asked to transfer.”
“Theo, usually,” Pansy said with a smirk. “Although I don’t think he would call himself the victim when he’s the one begging for it.”
A few seconds later, Hermione returned with a bottle of wine and three glasses, plus a bottle of tonic water topped with another glass. “Here we go. Let’s have this and then we can go somewhere else. This place will start getting busy soon.”
“No problem. And just a regular latte,” Harry said, sitting back down in his chair. “Hope that’s okay.”
Harry obliged and stepped inside, slipping past Draco until he was standing in the hallway. He looked around surreptitiously. “This is nice.”
Draco grinned. “That sounds perfect. Okay, so you’ve got a little bit to work with there. Just try and memorise it.”
When they parted, Harry felt an immediate sense of loss. The explosion of butterflies in his stomach slowly calmed down as he continued to gaze back at Draco. “Well?”
Draco hurried to the Apparition point. He knew they weren’t really going on a date, but he still felt like there was some sort of expectation of him, and the feeling just reminded him of
Harry laughed and shook his head. “No, I just don’t wear them very often. I didn’t think full dress robes were necessary.”
“Draco, hello darling,” Narcissa said with a smile as Draco stooped to kiss her on the cheek. “Hello, Harry.”
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand at the mention of roast beef. After hearing Harry’s tales of the legendary Weasley lunches, he was anticipating great things.
As soon as they were seated, the food appeared on their plates. Smiling at each other, they began to eat.
“Everyone else, help yourselves to vegetables and potatoes,” Molly said, looking around the table at them all. “There’s plenty for everyone.”
Draco shook his head. “No. I came across it when I was browsing the other day and thought it would make an interesting read.”
“Let’s get out of here then,” Ron said. “Hermione will be wondering where I am by now, I suppose. I didn’t realise it was so late.”
“Maybe we can do a giveaway?” Harry suggested, turning to Draco as they stood admiring the arrangements.
“Definitely. I have a written description of what they want, but I’ll need to sketch it out tomorrow,” Draco replied, following Harry out onto the street and pulling the door closed behind him.
“That wouldn’t surprise me,” Harry said. “I would if I was living in one of these flats. My house is still Unplottable, but it doesn’t really need to be anymore.”
“Or, and this is probably a crazy notion,” Draco began, putting the sweeping brush back and picking up the mop and bucket. “You could just assume he’s a Muggle and not say anything until you know otherwise.”
Draco sighed as he gazed out of the window. It had been drizzling on and off all day. Draco knew this because he had been sitting in the window ever since Harry left for work that morning. It was how he’d spent the majority of his days since he’d been put on sick leave. He wasn’t sick, he was
“Come in,” Draco said as he opened the door a few seconds later. “I wondered when you were going to knock. What were you doing?”
“I hope she wouldn’t have,” Harry said, turning and heading into the back room. “I will be having words with her later though.”
“Do you fancy going for a coffee?” Harry asked as they turned the sign in the window and locked the door at the end of the day. “I’m sure we could both do with something stronger, but I don’t feel like facing the crowds.”
“You bet your arse I am,” Draco replied. “I’ve had to share you all afternoon. I want some time alone with you now.”
Draco laughed as he made his way into the back room. “Carry on, don’t let me stop you. Weasley,” he added with a nod.
“So? One more week wouldn’t do any harm,” Harry said. “It would be better than sitting through this after that argument.”
“Oh, honestly!” Pansy tutted, sitting back in a sulk. “Draco, you’re being ridiculous. You’ve changed, Harry knows that and he likes you. He’s not going to suddenly hate you if you take a chance and it doesn’t work out. Wait until Theo comes in here. He’ll tell you the same thing.”
Draco raised a hand awkwardly in greeting as the faces of Hermione, Ron, George and Ginny turned to them.
A couple of hours passed and they made their way out of Bookworms and Brews and to the Apparition point.
“Might be an idea, yes,” Draco said, nodding. “Just don’t say anything that will tie you in knots or get you into trouble.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll still get your leg over when I go,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Pansy, I need to talk to you.”
“Maybe not an interrogation as such, but I imagine there will be some questions,” Draco replied with a chuckle. “They’ll probably just ask how your date was or something.”
Draco snorted softly. “Alright, that gives us another hour then. We should be able to get another chapter read at least. Wait, are you at the same place as me? Just before the end of chapter two?”
“What? Why would I want you to leave? Do you have any idea what my mother would do if you left?” Draco exclaimed, staring at Harry.
Harry opened the door and stepped outside, Draco following a few seconds later. They went through the ritual of locking the door and pulling the security gate shut before locking it with the padlock.
“What plans? Why didn’t you tell me this last night?” Harry asked with a groan. He pushed one hand through his hair, wincing as his fingers caught on a knot that had appeared overnight. He pulled his hand free, leaving his hair sticking up at all angles.
“Go on, go home and get ready. I’ll finish these reports up,” Ron said with a smile. “There’s only half an hour left until the end of shift anyway.”
Draco waved a hand at him as he took his own apron off, hanging it up beside Harry’s. He looked around, checking that they’d done everything that they really needed to. Narcissa had already called in for the takings on the way to the bank, so he knew the till was empty. He wasn’t sure why he and Harry preferred to do the final clean up by hand instead of using magic, but it had been their routine ever since Harry had started working there. He had to admit, there was something relaxing about swirling the mop around the floor. Satisfied that there was nothing else to do, he flicked the lights off, leaving only the fairy lights twinkling away in the window. He made sure that the delivery door was locked before making his way out of the shop, crossing the mopped floor carefully. He turned the lock again, stepping outside and pulling the door shut behind him. He locked it and pulled the wrought iron security gate shut across the front, securing it with a chain and padlock.
“Her favourite colour is orange,” Ron said, scratching the back of his neck with one hand. “All shades of it. And… I don’t know about flowers.”
Harry shook his head slightly. He still couldn’t quite believe that Ron and Hermione had children, even though Hugo was their second. He often wondered if their eleven year old selves would have believed this was how their lives would turn out.
Harry snorted. “No, no. But, Draco… her cousin is only twenty! I just… what could I possibly have in common with him?”
“Yeah, I know. I had plenty of arguments with Draco when I first started working at Paperwhite’s. He really didn’t want me there,” Harry said, a sympathetic smile on his face. “But we’ve worked through it. We’re really good friends now, and sometimes I find it hard to believe we were ever enemies.”
“Oh. Good point,” Harry said, nodding. He turned to look at the flowers again. “I suppose I could take them over to The Burrow with me in the morning. Are you going to take some for your mum?”
The street itself was empty, which was unusual in Harry’s experience. Every time he’d visited Draco in the last couple of weeks, there’d been people out walking. Harry supposed that they were all home with their families. Turning around, he knocked on the door.
“Okay, that one was for Madam Jenkins,” Harry said, coming back into the shop and crossing the name off his list. “There’s five more to do.”
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, gathering up their coffee cups and depositing them in the bin. “It’s the same date every year.”
“No, I don’t have it here all the time. The room isn’t big enough for it to be here all the time so I shrink it down and keep it in the cupboard,” Draco replied with a sheepish grin. “Mother hates it.”
Harry shook his head, making a face. “No. I did have a blind date the other night, but it didn’t go well.”
“Should we have a colour theme?” Harry suggested, taking another sip of his coffee. “For the display, I mean. We can do arrangements in any colour.”
Harry shook his head, an amused smile on his lips as he took a drink from the bottle. He settled back against the sofa and gazed out of the window. He could see people walking past on the other side of the road, but they weren’t close enough to see into the house. He wondered whether people
“I know,” Harry said after another moment of silence. “I promise you, Molly, I’m alright. I’m in no rush to settle down. It’ll happen when it happens. It’s not that I don’t want to settle down, you understand? I just haven’t found the right person, and I sort of believe that when I do, I’ll know.”
“Harry Potter. I’ve heard your story,” Arlo replied, shaking Harry’s hand firmly. “You accomplished a great deal.”
“Well done,” Harry said, shaking his head. “What time is the delivery due? Some of that Gypsophila out there is looking a bit wilted. We’ll want the freshest stuff for these bouquets.”
“Honestly, I’m sure I’ll love it whatever it is,” Harry replied with a smile. “What I’ve got you isn’t fancy either. Just a token gift, really.”
“Fair enough. We should be able to take our time with them at least,” Harry said, pulling the door open.
“We need to decide what kind of Christmas vases or baskets we want to get to put these flowers in,” Draco replied as he walked back into the shop. “We’ll just use this for now, to get an idea of what the display will look like but we probably won’t get the full picture until we put them in proper vases.”
“Well,” Harry said as Draco unclipped the padlock. “I’ll see you on Monday. Enjoy your lunch tomorrow.”
“It’s nice and private,” Harry said, looking around briefly before reaching for his sandwich. “I dunno, it’s just cozy and homely here. Maybe it’s just because this is where we sat that first time.”
“I know what you mean. It’ll be nice,” Draco said as he unhooked the other side of the display unit. “Have you told them about us yet?”
Harry moaned softly, one hand caressing the back of Draco’s neck as he slid it up to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Ron nodded and wandered over to the displays while Harry headed back behind the counter with the flowers.
“Exactly,” Harry said, grin still in place. “Right, I am going this time. See you in the morning,” he added, waving a hand as he walked backwards for a few paces.
“Oh, well, obviously. We’re at a good part,” Harry said. “And I can’t wait to see what happens next.”
“Sometimes,” Draco nodded. “If there are lots of people around, it can be quite off-putting. I like a quieter atmosphere for reading.”
“It’ll be nice even if there’s snow,” Harry said, continuing to sweep the floor. “It’ll make being home even nicer.”
“Five altogether,” Draco said with a smile. “A lounge, a kitchen, a bathroom and two bedrooms. Although one of those is my lab.”
“No, no. I had dinner with Mother last Saturday,” Draco replied quickly. “No, I’m going over to eat with Pansy and Theo.”
“I can imagine,” Harry said, nodding. “Sirius and Hagrid both told me how awful the place was. Although I thought it would have improved a bit when the Dementors were removed.”
Harry laughed. “Alright, if you’re sure. Anyway, it’s your lunchtime. Should we put the sign out before you go?”
Ginny bit her lip. “Blaise Zabini. He was doing some publicity shots for the team and I recognised him.”
“T… Tulips?” Harry asked, his gaze immediately falling on the brightly coloured blooms in their display buckets.
Harry opened his eyes immediately, all pretence of sleep gone as he racked his brains to try and recall if he’d missed someone’s birthday. “...Tuesday?”
“I wanted to do something nice for you,” Draco replied. “And you can count this as an early birthday present too, if you like. I will still have a present for you on your actual birthday, of course.”
Once they were happy with their selection, Draco put his plate down and went to the cupboard, taking out the table and chairs. He put them on the floor in the lounge and pulled out his wand before pointing it at the table and reciting the incantation.
“To a certain extent, yes. He was never on the same level as Crabbe and Goyle, of course, but he was a close second,” Draco said, nodding.
Harry groaned again, rolling out of bed and making his way to the bathroom. He wanted to protest again at the early hour, but he had a feeling it would fall on deaf ears. When he was in a mischievous mood, Draco didn’t pay any attention to what Harry said. Shaking his head, Harry closed the bathroom door behind him and turned the shower on. Whatever Draco had planned, he knew it wouldn’t do to be late.
“Well, it makes sense to me. We might as well get comfortable before we bring food into the mix,” Harry said with a shrug. “Have you got a book in mind for tonight?”
“Alright, you go and get that sorted in the back room then, and I’ll man the shop,” Draco said. “Then once it’s been collected, we can start the clean down.”
Draco snorted as he leant over to press a kiss to the top of Harry’s head. “Hark who’s talking! Alright, I’m going. See you later.”
“No, I don’t suppose you could have. For what it’s worth, I’m flattered that you wanted me to be your
“Alright, then thank you. I will take them,” Harry said with a smile. He began to pull the bunches out of the bucket they were in, then paused. He dropped the bunches back into the bucket and picked the whole thing up. “I’ll bring this back with me after Christmas.”
“Well, you definitely did that,” Harry replied, leaning down to kiss Draco hungrily. He groaned into the kiss, pushing his hips down so that his erection brushed against Draco’s rapidly hardening cock. “I’ve been waiting all night for this, you bastard.”
“No, I did think it might be more controversial. It was good though,” Harry replied, nodding. “It was nice to read about the wizarding views on sexuality. They’re much better than the Muggle views. Although the views on marriage are a bit more lenient, I think.”
“Did you tell Hermione that?” Draco asked as the driver turned the engine off and got out of the van.
“Yes, I think we should,” Draco replied. “We’ll need to get them right before we put them on display.”
“Ah, well, maybe another time,” Harry said apologetically. “Now, this bouquet… follow me,” he continued, coming out from behind the counter and gesturing to Ron. He made his way around the shop, showing Ron the different flowers they had in stock in the colours he’d mentioned.
Before anything else could be said, the door swung open again and Charlie poked his head into the room. “Is it safe to come in here? No arguing going on?”
“Oh. Well, he said he was going to have dinner with the Weasleys and they were having roast beef,” Draco said, unfolding his own napkin and placing it on his lap. “So I told him if I wasn’t having roast beef too, I’d hex him.”
Harry laughed again. “Alright, alright, I know you’re not lying now. I’m glad you’d tell me if my bouquets weren’t up to scratch. How can I improve if I never get told?”
“Can’t we get ribbon with diamonds on it? Or at least little sparkly bits?” Harry asked, straightening up, a frown on his face.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, absolutely fine. I liked it there, it was nice and cosy, and easy to have a conversation. Not like some of the bars.”
“Glad to hear it,” Draco murmured, taking another sip of his coffee. “Now, forgive me, but I need to eat this chocolate cake because it smells too good to ignore any longer.”
“I do, don’t worry,” Harry laughed. “And you’re right, you have been the best friend. Just don’t tell Ron, okay?”
Harry laughed. “Well, they can’t be much worse. What if you’re busy when they want me to go on a date?”
“That makes sense,” Harry nodded. “And, for what it’s worth, your efforts are definitely paying off.”
,” Draco replied. “We’re friends and work colleagues. We wouldn’t do anything that would affect the shop.”
Harry grabbed the sweeping brush and moved around the counter onto the shop floor. He swept from the door back to the counter, making sure to get all of the fallen leaves from under the display units. He deftly swept them onto the dustpan before depositing them in the bin. He moved to get the mop and bucket from the backroom, filling the bucket with water and squirting some disinfectant into it.
Harry grinned, but before he could say anything more, a shout of “Present time for the grown ups!” rang out across the room and he and Ginny joined the rest of the group around the tree as George took charge and began handing out presents.
“Hi, Ron, what are you doing here?” Harry asked, looking up as the bell above the door chimed. He was alone as Draco had just gone out for lunch.
Together, he and Harry took turns in putting vegetables onto both of their plates and trading tureens with others at the table.
Harry stepped inside and followed Molly through the house. Just like his previous visits, the house was warm and welcoming, and he could hear the chatter of his friends through the door which was slightly ajar. He could smell the roast beef cooking and he smiled. He always felt at home here. “So, is Charlie coming again today?”
When Draco walked in a few moments later, Harry was still standing in the entrance to the backroom, bucket in his hands and a confused expression on his face.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Harry replied, managing to sound coherent as Draco’s foot stroked its way further up his thigh. His muscles twitched with every stroke of Draco’s toe and he felt a blush creeping up his neck. “That bit was just a bit…
“Oh, it absolutely was,” Harry replied, nodding. “I think it would be amazing warm with custard, but I am completely okay with it cold too.”
“It’s alright Hermione, I’m over it now,” Harry said, smiling. “Just vet them a bit more in future, okay?”
“Not too bad though, are they?” Harry asked, looking concerned. “They should be okay for another week or so by my reckoning.”
Harry snorted. “It is, as it happens, but that’s not the point. I just don’t want to be responsible for attracting a crowd of onlookers while we eat.”
Harry nodded, reaching a hand into the pocket of his cloak which he’d left over the back of the sofa when he arrived.
“Oh yes. Don’t think I’ve forgotten about that,” Draco said, stretching. “I’ve been looking for something good this whole time. Right. I spy with my little eye something beginning with…”
“Thanks. I got enough flowers for us both,” Harry said, smiling. “At least I think I did. If we need anymore, we’ll have to go and get them as we work.”
Draco nodded. “I like that too, funnily enough. It’s nice to see myself represented, although I don’t think George has done as many awful things as I did.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry nodded. “We always have time to make bouquets for people who walk in. So what colours are you after? Any particular flowers?”
“We were both invited, so we came,” Harry replied. “We didn’t think anyone would notice us at midnight, considering most people were kissing someone else.”
Harry blinked again and looked down at the notepad. Draco’s looping handwriting covered the page, listing all of the details of the order. Then, without another word, he headed into the back room.
“Hey, don’t complain,” Draco said, pointing a finger at him. “The more business we bring in, the better wages we end up with.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t either. I now see why you like to go there to eat. Mrs Weasley is a very good cook.”
“Exactly. And look at you two, working together and everything,” Ginny replied. “For years, no less.”
“Yeah, I like the sound of that,” Harry nodded, taking another bite. “And it’ll save you from coming up with different books each time we come here.”
Harry grinned and led Draco down the stairs and into the kitchen where they stepped into the fireplace.
Draco shook his head. “No, normal time will be alright in the morning. I’m certainly not coming in any earlier.”
Draco snorted. “I can imagine. Well, you know where I am if you need me. We still have that book to finish.”
Pansy rolled her eyes dramatically but smiled. “I bumped into your mother at the bank. She told me you had a date.”
Harry snorted. “Let’s keep that as a last resort. I’d rather be on the front page of The Prophet for being seen here with you than to be on it for bribing the restaurant owners to kick out other customers.”
“You carried on telling him that you were being set up so that you could go out with him,” Charlie finished, nodding in understanding. “I see.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, picking up a stack of buckets that needed to be returned to the delivery driver and moving them to the delivery door. “Won’t your mum mind?”
“Oh yeah? Do you have a reason for wanting privacy while you’re reading?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Don’t be silly. It was no trouble,” Hermione said, smiling. “I trust you know how to administer it?”
“I know, I know, I’m only teasing,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. Anyway, should we read some more of this book? I want to see what happens next.”
“There’s always one,” Draco nodded. “I had one that did that last week. Took me three attempts to get the bow right.”
“The Draco Malfoy you know has changed a lot over the years,” Draco replied, giving her a look. “The old Draco would have gone for it, regardless of the damage it caused. The new Draco, well, he’s a bit more cautious.”
“Yes, it is. Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing,” Narcissa replied. “I am simply expressing my concern.”
“You can have more than that,” Ginny said softly to Blaise. “Honestly. Look at everyone else’s plates.”
“I don’t think I could either. I think I’ve gone snow blind from all of those white roses,” Harry sighed. “At least we pulled it off.”
“Yes. You and Harry work together. Do you really think this is a good idea?” Narcissa replied, fixing him with a stern look.
“Is that your way of saying you think I’m attractive?” Draco asked, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as he looked up at Harry from where he was mopping the floor.
Draco grinned to himself and walked around the shop, adjusting the position of a bucket here and a vase there. Everything looked perfect and he smiled with satisfaction. If anyone had told him while he was at school that one day he’d be working in a florist owned by his mother alongside Harry - bloody - Potter, he would have laughed in their face. But now, he thought, now he wouldn’t change things for the world.
Draco’s face was impassive as he continued to eat and Harry cursed inwardly. Draco’s toes were continuing their tracing journey, repeating the motion that had caused such a reaction in Harry.
“It was going well. We’d had food and read a chapter of the book we’ve been reading for the last few months, and we were talking about the whole situation,” Harry explained. “He said he’d started looking forward to our ‘dates’ so I felt I had to tell him the truth.”
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, of course I will. Although don’t hold your breath for anything happening soon.” He stood up to shake Charlie’s hand.
The assistant nodded and set about making their coffee before moving to the cabinet and taking out two slices of chocolate cake. He set them on plates and put them onto a tray, then he finished making their lattes and handed the tray across to Harry.
“Oh, well that’s a step in the right direction then,” Harry said, shrugging his cloak off. “Have you adapted a potion or come up with something completely new?”
“I was thinking the same. We’ve only got a few chapters left,” Harry nodded, picking up his sandwich and taking a bite. He gave a satisfied groan as he chewed. “This
“Thankfully, no,” Harry said with a grin. “We don’t sell anything carnivorous or poisonous, for exactly that reason.”
“Good. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to do a quick check of what we’ve got out there on the floor while you finish your sandwich,” Draco said, moving past Harry and into the main shop area.
Once they’d finished, they set up a table in front of one of the bare walls of the shop, setting their vases next to each other on top.
“Because, apparently, you’re unwilling to come alone,” Draco replied, raising one eyebrow while he paid the barista.
“Good. Well, should we head off now then? It’s getting quite late,” Draco said, returning the smile.
Draco glanced up at the clock above them. “Ah, you’re right. We haven’t got long, so let’s just do a quick sweep around tonight. We can mop in the morning if we need to.”
“You know perfectly well what I mean,” Harry murmured, his nose bumping against Draco’s ear as he pressed a kiss to the soft skin.
“Yeah, but you had a reason to behave in that way, given how he sometimes spoke to you. What was my excuse?” Draco replied with a half-grin. “Other than being a brat.”
“Well, if that happens, it’ll be a good thing,” Charlie said, nodding. “But have you thought about what you’ll do if it doesn’t?”
“Don’t worry. Most people do,” Tim replied with a smile. “It’s a common misconception that alcohol is necessary for a good night out.”
“Is this the last one?” Harry asked, nodding to the half-finished dried flower display in his hands.
“Yes,” Harry replied. “Because I didn’t know what else to do while I waited for you to get back. So I checked on the plants.”
Draco shrugged again. “No idea. It just makes sense to me. Alright, get a new page in your notepad and we’ll brainstorm. What do you picture the bloke looking like?”
“I don’t mind at all,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I’m surprised we’ve never had this conversation before to be honest. I knew at school. Never acted on it, but I knew.”
Harry laughed and leant closer, pressing his lips to Draco’s in a soft kiss. He smiled as Draco kissed back.
“Oh, we’re doing this now, are we?” Harry asked, putting his mug down and picking up one of the muffins. “I like how similar the story is to our lives. You know, we hated each other at school, became friends later in life.”
In between making up all of the arrangements that were needed to decorate the wedding venue, they also had their regular customers to attend to. The winner of their dried flower competition was drawn and Draco had tried very hard not to gloat when his arrangement was deemed to be the best.
“Thank you,” Draco replied. “I’m finished here and I’d better get going. I’ll be going home afterwards, so I’ll see you again soon,” he added, standing up and moving around to kiss Narcissa on the cheek. “Thank you for this.”
“No,” Harry said, frowning slightly. He hadn’t imagined they’d be allowed to take him there and then.
“Yeah, there was no queue, miraculously,” Draco replied, handing one cup to Harry as they met at the counter. “Or maybe it’s not so surprising, given that it’s pissing down.”
Harry groaned. “I know, don’t remind me. Although I suppose I should be glad that it’s not Christmas that’s coming up.”
“I’ll do that, don’t worry. Tea or coffee?” Charlie said, walking across the kitchen and picking up the kettle so he could fill it with water.
Draco nodded this time. “He does. He… wasn’t too happy about that, but ultimately, Mother reminded him that it has nothing to do with him and that you’re a good worker.”
“We wouldn’t have missed this for the world, Mother,” Draco replied with a smile. “Would we, Harry?”
“I have to say, Harry, that it’s remarkable how you two get along now. You were always so suspicious of him,” Molly said. “I’m glad you managed to put that all behind you.”
“No, but I don’t think Mrs Weasley is the worst one,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “We’ve still got to tell George.”
“Of course. I’m sure I’ve told you this before,” Harry replied with a chuckle. “Custard is one of the best parts of a dessert.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, I do, luckily. Alright, now we’ve exchanged presents, let’s get settled for this show on the wireless.”
“I think we do a main prize of a deluxe bouquet in the style of the winner’s choice, and then a couple of smaller prizes,” Draco replied, placing the box on the table with the dried flower arrangements. “Those can be gift vouchers, worth less than the deluxe bouquet, of course.”
“That’s fair enough. I’m not a huge fan of Christmas pudding either,” Harry admitted. “The fruit is too chewy for my liking.”
the fresh flowers, as you know, but replacing them can be costly, so I thought for the winter time, I’d take a chance on something new.”
,” Draco said. “I very rarely venture out of my flat outside of coming to work and doing my food shopping. But going on these dates with you has made me realise that people are starting to forget what happened… what I did. It’s not the same as it was straight after Hogwarts and it’s time I started realising it.”
Draco smiled. “Me too. You look nice, by the way. Even your hair doesn’t seem as messy, did you do something with it?”
“Oh, ha ha,” Draco said, making a face. “Is that all you think about when you think of me? That I’m a posh boy from a Manor House?”
“Really,” Draco replied, getting up and sitting on the edge of the bed. “I want to be here to see you every day after work, not just the weekends. I won’t care how tired you are, or how hurt you are, I just don’t want
Within moments of everyone sitting down, the hot tureens of vegetables began floating into the room.
Harry laughed. “Come off it, you know you’re an attractive bloke. You don’t need me to tell you that.”
“I know. I arranged a date for him on Valentine’s night with someone I know through work,” Hermione said. “But it turned out that all he was interested in was Harry’s fame.”
“The delivery will be here shortly,” Draco said, screwing the paper wrapping from his sandwich into a ball. “We should have all of our supplies for the dried Christmas arrangements arriving today. We’ll be able to make a start on those this week. We need a display board put together to advertise them too, if you wouldn’t mind taking care of that.”
“Okay. Make sure you tell her it’s urgent,” Draco said. “I have no idea how long he’s been like this.”
Draco nodded slowly. “That’s good. I know we normally do the spring bouquets and they always go down well. I’ve never thought about doing dried arrangements on the same theme.”
Draco snorted softly. “It’s a good thing this wasn’t one of the things you had to face in that battle.”
“I still don’t really know that myself,” Ginny admitted with a laugh. “He was doing posed individual shots after practice one day and wanted to get some from the game the day after. He stayed in the same hotel as me and we ended up having a few drinks together. Not that I was drinking alcohol before a game, of course.”
“Oh, that must be this box then,” Harry replied as he lifted the lid of the next box in the pile and revealed a large variety of ferns.
Harry laughed now. “No, I don’t think there’s any need for you to do that. We can either have a sandwich at the café, or we can just get some cake or something to go with our coffee and then get a takeaway on our way home?”
“So,” Harry repeated, before taking a breath. “I like you. I’d like to see where this could go if we took it further. I know it could get awkward, with us working together, but I think we’d be daft not to give it a go.”
Harry nodded and headed back behind the counter to begin sorting his arrangement out. Usually they would make the bouquets up in the back room, but occasionally they liked to make them up on the counter as they found it helped when customers could see the care and effort they put into each creation.
“Excellent. I’ll go and get the coffees. I think we deserve them,” Draco said, walking out from behind the counter and heading for the door.
“Oh my word, you thought right,” Harry said as he looked at the treacle tart longingly. “This is my favourite.”
“Indeed we will,” Draco said, returning the smile. “I wonder what has happened to Jeremy and George since we were last there.”
“Oh, yes, I would think so. You could make a fortune,” Pansy said, nodding. “It’s certainly something you should think about.”
“Of course,” Draco nodded, taking a seat in an armchair and crossing his legs. “Harry has an extraordinarily good eye for these dried bouquets, so I’m sure he’ll be able to help too.”
“Keep going down here, there’s bound to be one free,” Draco replied, gesturing towards the end of the main aisle between the stacks.
“Maybe,” Harry agreed, nodding. “I don’t know though. I don’t know if I can see myself with a woman forever.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. Because if you hadn’t, then I probably would have run away. Even though I wanted you to kiss me. I don’t know how that mistletoe got there, but I’m grateful for it.”
Harry smiled, taking one side of the display unit from Draco. “I’d love to. We could listen to the Christmas show that’s on the radio and have hot chocolate too.”
Draco smiled. “You’ll find out later. Right, let’s move on,” he said, gesturing for Harry to follow him again as he turned to leave the room.
“So am I,” Harry replied honestly. “And I think Ginny is just as capable of it as I am. She knows what she’s doing.”
“I’ll be ready,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “I wish I knew what this fascination with my love life was all about.”
Draco laughed. “Alright then, go and get the books. We can finish it tonight. I have to say I’ve been wondering what will happen.”
“Oh. Well, sorry. I’m not here to buy anything, I’m afraid,” Hermione said apologetically. “Harry, Molly asked me to call and see if you wanted to come for dinner at The Burrow tonight? She meant to send Errol yesterday but he wouldn’t get off his perch.”
“Maybe… it won’t be with the delivery though,” Draco said thoughtfully. “You’d have to go and buy it from somewhere.”
He pulled out his wand and flicked it, sending his cloak soaring across the room to the cupboard. Then he strode across to the cupboard in the lounge where he kept the few bottles of alcohol that he had. He pulled out a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky and poured himself a large measure before carrying it across to his armchair which he slumped into.
“Well, yeah but we can do orange and black ones and put some bats and stuff in among them,” Harry said with a grin. “You know the kind of thing. No trolls though.”
“It’s a good job I’m good with a water-repelling charm,” Draco muttered, taking a drink from his own cup.
“She’ll just be biding her time, you mark my words,” Ginny replied darkly. “She’ll mention him one day, completely out of the blue and you’ll be forced to bring him to dinner.”
Molly nodded, closing her eyes briefly. “Alright. Well, let’s have no more talk of this tonight. Who’s ready for pudding?”
Harry couldn’t help but smile adoringly at Draco. “You are the best. I didn’t have time for breakfast this morning.”
“This is Mr McGregor,” she said as she led them to one of the pens. “He’s only five years old, but he’s been with us for over a year.”
,” Harry said with a derisive snort. “I mean, I don’t mind juice bars. During the day. Not on a night when you’re trying to relax after a busy week!”
“The coffee is very good here. It’s a shame they don’t do takeaway though,” Draco said, lowering himself into the armchair beside Harry’s. “I’d definitely come here for it if they did.”
started, might I remind you,” Draco hissed back, finally turning his head to glare at Harry. “All because I said I didn’t think you should put your name forward for that overseas mission.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Don’t worry,” Harry laughed as he picked up the bouquet and carried it into the back room.
“I don’t really have a preference. Maybe a Muggle name will be easier. Less chance of them thinking they know him,” Harry said thoughtfully. “And not a name of someone I’ve already gone out with.”
Ginny shrugged. “Of course we did. If you’d have broken this news before Christmas, I’d have won an extra five Galleons.”
“Well, I suppose you can be forgiven. You’ve only been here a dozen times in the last two weeks,” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow as he looked at Harry over his shoulder.
“I’ll have you know that I am a very capable cook these days,” Draco replied haughtily. “I am very proud of my spaghetti.”
“Exactly. Except you’re all settled down now, and even Ginny has a boyfriend, so there’s only me for her to worry about,” Harry sighed. “I don’t want her to worry about me. I’m
Draco rolled his eyes. “Mother, honestly. We’re twenty-nine years old. We’re past everything from years ago now. We’re not about to fall out over something silly.”
Harry shook his head, laughing too. “Listen to us. Once over, we wouldn’t have cared whether anyone thought we were doing a good job.”
Draco shrugged. “It doesn’t matter who my first official date is, really. They’d all wonder who was lowering themselves to go out with me. The fact that it’s you is like their wet dream, except there’s a bonus of them all being far too afraid of upsetting you to approach me. Or worse, hex me.”
Draco grinned and headed up the steps and into Bookworms and Brews, making his way to the café counter.
“Nothing yet,” Hermione said, glancing around. “We were waiting for you to get here. Should we get a bottle of wine?”
“No, funnily enough, there aren’t,” Harry laughed. “At least not in our shop. I can’t speak for others.”
“Exactly. Right, get your cloak off and get comfortable. I’ll go and get the books, then we can get coffee and sandwiches,” Draco said, shrugging his own cloak off as he spoke.
“I can’t believe you’re making us do this,” Harry hissed in Draco’s ear as they entered the restaurant. “Don’t you think we have bigger problems to worry about than dinner with your parents?”
“The dragon tamer who lives in Romania. The one I had a bit of a thing with all those years ago,” Harry replied. “He listens without judging, and he’s kind of been there, done that.”
Draco snorted. “They’re not. Trust me. Weasley and I are civil to each other on the odd occasions he comes into the shop, but that’s about as far as it goes. Harry is a different story.”
Draco shook his head and straightened up again. “I don’t mind. I’ll ask them to set us up a tab so we can pay when we leave.”
it is,” Draco replied with a grin that looked almost proud. “I have the day off too and I’ve made some plans for us.”
! Look, even Charlie has got someone now,” Hermione exclaimed, gesturing at Arlo who flushed slightly.
“They will. Things aren’t like they used to be,” Harry said. “Ron can even be civil to Draco when he comes in now.”
Harry laughed and steered Ron towards the Apparition point that had been set up. “Can you make it home in one piece?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry said, waving his hand. “I know it wasn’t exactly a run of the mill thing.”
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “It wasn’t really a date. I was just helping Harry out.”
Just as he was heading to the back room to get the watering can, the door opened and Draco arrived back with their coffee. “Are you working?”
“Well, they’re not exactly similar in looks or build or anything, are they?” Draco said. “Apart from the two Weasleys, I suppose.”
Draco blinked at him again, reaching into the carrier bag to pull out one of the boxes it contained. “Oh, I am. I am. Right, okay, well I’ll let you know what we’re doing before Saturday, if that’s alright?”
“Oh? Do tell me more,” Draco replied, glancing up as he neatened the small pile of dust and debris that had accumulated throughout the day. “You didn’t mention it this morning.”
“I sometimes still can’t believe it, you know,” Draco mused. “Who would have guessed that this is what would become of the Malfoys?”
Harry laughed. “I don’t mind at all, because I got you something too,” he said, also turning slightly pink.
I’ve got myself into a bit of a situation and I need to talk to someone. I can’t talk to Ron or Hermione, I don’t think they’d understand. Have you got any appointments in the UK soon? I could really do with a chat.
Harry felt himself flush at Draco’s words. “I don’t know, I really don’t. I honestly thought they knew me better than that, but their choice of men has been dodgy, to say the least.”
“Well. I will reserve the right to say it anyway,” Pansy said. “Because I don’t think you’ll be able to keep this up for long if you keep taking him on dates.”
Groaning softly as he removed his travelling cloak, Harry looked across at Draco. “I don’t know about you, but I haven’t got the energy to do much now.”
“I know, but I can’t help apologising,” Harry shrugged. “I feel like you had to put up with a lot from me at the beginning of the year.”
“Told you it was comfy,” Draco said, having walked back into the room as Harry sat down. He grinned as he held out an opened bottle to Harry. “Do you want a glass for this?”
“You… are amazing,” Harry said softly, taking Draco’s hand and pulling him close. “I can’t believe you planned all of this for today.”
Harry swallowed and tightened his grip on the key. While it wasn’t as bad as Apparating, he couldn’t say that travelling by Portkey was a favourite of his.
“Tea, please,” Harry replied. “I try not to drink coffee once I’m home from work. I have a few different kinds of tea though, so just pick what you fancy. I’ll have chamomile.”
“Ah, well, I’ll look forward to it then,” Harry said, smiling too. They fell silent as they continued to work until the hanging display unit was bare.
“Well, we haven’t been for a while,” Draco replied. “We’ve either been at your place or mine, doing things we definitely wouldn’t be allowed to do here.”
“That sounds perfect,” Harry replied, returning the grin. “We can eat, exchange presents and then we can snuggle under a blanket and listen to the wireless?”
Harry chuckled as they reached the table and chairs at the end of the aisle. “Of course. I wasn’t going to go shouting or anything.”
Upon arriving home, he threw off his cloak and ran straight upstairs, taking them two at a time, so that he could have a quick shower. He didn’t know why, but he always felt that turning up at Pansy’s
“If you insist,” Draco said, heading into the backroom to get the cloth they used for wiping the counters over.
“Thank you,” Draco said again, moving across to the counter and picking up the cup with his name on. “Are the sandwiches both the same?”
Draco shook his head slightly as he gathered the old display flowers into small bunches, putting the best ones into a bucket. With a flick of his wand, he conjured a sign reading
“I hope so. I think I’ll just have to start answering with that, whatever the question is,” Harry replied, taking his cloak off and hanging it in the cupboard.
“I know,” Ron said with a chuckle. “To be honest, I think she was just worried about not getting grandchildren.”
Draco watched her go before slumping back in his chair with a sigh. He hadn’t wanted to admit it to Pansy, but he had thought about his feelings for Harry quite a lot lately. He’d known for a good few weeks now that his feelings towards his former nemesis had changed, but had tried his best to dampen them. What he’d said to Pansy was true, he didn’t feel that anything could possibly happen between himself and Harry without potentially ending badly and affecting both his personal life and his work life. His mother would never forgive him if he lost her one of the best employees they’d ever had due to a failed attempt at a relationship. It was far safer if nothing ever happened between them.
“Does that matter?” Harry asked, pausing and looking back over his shoulder. “It’s open twenty-four hours a day.”
“Indeed they do,” Draco said softly, smiling at Harry before pausing. “What were we talking about, again?”
“Good morning,” Draco said, poking his head out of the back room. “How was the rest of your weekend?”
“Fair enough. We need to change the hanging display unit over,” Harry said, sliding out of Draco’s way and moving into the back room of the shop. “No need for hearts everywhere now.”
Harry nodded. “Oh, yeah. I think we’ll both be too busy to have dinner before then. But afterwards, definitely.”
“I, on the other hand, love a good drink,” Ron said unapologetically. “Not that I do it every day, of course.”
“You’re still a bastard for getting me all worked up at dinner,” Harry pointed out, poking Draco in the ribs. “I’m pretty sure your dad now thinks I’m even more of an idiot than he already thought.”
Harry grinned as they swapped tureens and before long, everyone at the table had piles of steaming vegetables and roast potatoes on their plates, topped with thick slices of roast chicken and rivers of gravy running down the sides.
A few seconds later, Draco walked into the back room, two cups of coffee and a paper bag in his hands. “I thought you might want a Danish too.”
The rest of the week, as Harry had predicted, was mostly spent checking the sales receipts until they’d identified the flower-buying trends of the wizarding public. By the time the weekend came, Harry would have been quite glad if he never saw another sales receipt again. He and Draco had drunk copious amounts of coffee throughout the week and he felt like he might not sleep for the whole weekend.
“I hope so. I can’t cope with doing the deliveries every day,” Ron said, causing Hermione to tut loudly across the table.
Draco locked the door and pulled the security gate across before securing the padlock. He turned to Harry. “Well, have a good Christmas morning and I’ll see you tomorrow evening.”
Before he could give the matter anymore consideration, Harry appeared at the end of the aisle again, a tray in his hands. Draco smiled and set his book aside properly for a moment. “Is it still busy out there?”
Harry laughed and came up behind Draco who had, by now, turned back to the mirror. He slipped his arms around Draco’s waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. “Trust me, this is absolutely fine. No-one else will be dressed up, I promise you.”
“Erm, yeah, here,” Harry replied, quickly locating the reel of red ribbon and throwing across the shop to Draco. “There’s not much left on it though. I hope the delivery comes on time tomorrow.”
“Yeah, I think it did, actually,” Harry nodded. “I know I’m not a failure just because I’m not in a relationship right now.”
“That looks good,” Harry commented once the sign was finished. The word ‘win’ flashed in big letters at the top, followed by a short description of the giveaway in fancy, scrolled letters. In the bottom corner, there was an illustration of a flower arrangement in a vase.
Harry laughed and closed the notepad, putting it back into the drawer. “I’ll do the floor tonight. You do the counters.”
“If you wouldn’t mind. I’ve got another one of these to do before I’m finished with this order,” Draco said, making a face.
“Fair enough,” Draco said, nodding. “Alright, food might be a good idea next time. We’ll work it out when it happens.”
“Did George not tell you anything about this man?” Draco asked, turning to Harry with another frown. “You really need to stop accepting dates with people you know nothing about.”
“I still don’t know how you work with him,” Ron said, shaking his head. “How can you have managed to forget everything he did at school?”
“I’ll get them,” Draco said, waving a hand. “You can get the next ones. Any particular kind of coffee?”
was the last thing that really worked. It’s not a bad thing though, it’s been one of our best sellers since we introduced it,” Draco replied, running a hand through his hair.
“But you’ve moved past it. You’re such good friends now, surely you can see that?” Pansy asked, her brow creasing slightly.
“It might look strange to other people, but it doesn’t feel strange to me,” Harry replied, meeting Draco’s gaze. “We’ve spent so much time together over these last few years that I… I would miss you if we weren’t in each other’s company. What about you?”
A few moments later, Draco joined him at the other end of the counter and they worked quietly for the rest of the afternoon, each concentrating on the bouquets they were making up.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, I think Mum was trying not to show how surprised she was,” he said before sniffing the air. He lifted Hugo up and sniffed again before making a face. “Ah, sorry, I need to go and take care of this situation before he puts everyone off their dinner.”
Draco shook his head. “I wouldn’t offer if I minded. No-one has to know you’re just spending the time with a friend. All they need to know is that you’re busy.”
“Alright, if you insist,” Draco said, holding his hands up. “While you’re gone, I’ll make a start on watering everything.”
“Not just a bookshop. A café too,” Draco said. “They do the most exquisite pastries, and the coffee is good. I come here all the time.”
Harry shook his head with a smile. “Don’t mention it. I think I would have had trouble accepting it too, if I hadn’t become friends with Draco.”
Harry nodded, watching as Draco headed back down the aisle before turning his attention to his surroundings once more. For all the wooden shelves were dark wood, the aisle itself wasn’t dark thanks to the multiple lamps that lined it and he was sure it wouldn’t be hard to read a book at all.
“Really?” Draco asked, looking up with a frown. “I wonder where the other one is. Well, it looks like we’ll have to share doesn’t it?”
“One; Charlie Weasley,” Harry admitted. “I had to talk to someone, but I couldn’t talk to Ron or Hermione. I don’t know why, but I’ve always gone to Charlie with things like this.”
Draco looked down at the box in his lap with a start. “Oh. Hang on,” he muttered, opening the box to reveal a glass sphere. He lifted it out of the box carefully and looked across at Harry. “A Remembrall?”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but only a wide yawn came at first. “I am,” he said, blinking his eyes as the yawn subsided. “It’s staying awake for so long on these bloody surveillance nights. I wish they’d just show themselves.”
“What do you mean you don’t know what’s wrong with you? Why do you think there’s anything wrong with you?” Draco asked with a frown.
Draco arrived at his flat within moments of leaving Bookworms and Brews. He hadn’t bothered walking to the Apparition point, he’d simply ducked into a dark alley before turning. He pulled his cloak off as soon as he landed, marvelling at the fact he’d got home without splinching himself.
need you to sell to people,” Draco said, one eyebrow raised. “Not because you are who you are, but because I need the help in the shop and it takes far too long to break in a new colleague.”
“Sounds good. I am intrigued. Have you gone for fact or fiction this time?” Harry asked, glancing across at him.
“Rosemary roast beef with honey-glazed roasted vegetables and gravy,” Theo replied, pushing Pansy’s chair in and sitting down himself. “I thought I’d go classic. Oh, and there’s Yorkshire puddings too.”
“I agree, as it happens,” Draco replied. “We’ve always been thrown together in the strangest of circumstances, so why should this be any different? I think this could be something special. If we give it a chance.”
Shrugging, Harry pushed the thoughts out of his mind and headed back into the lounge. Looking at his watch, he decided that it wasn’t too early to go to bed and continued through the lounge, into the hall and up the stairs to his bedroom. Looking at his watch again, he doubled back on himself and went into the bathroom. He had a shower every morning before heading into work, but he hadn’t had a proper bath for what felt like ages.
“Because I wanted it to be a surprise,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Come on. We’ve got half an hour before we have to leave.”
Draco regarded Harry carefully. “That’s not a bad idea. Considering we haven’t really offered these kinds of things before, it could be good advertising.”
The moment that Draco shut the door behind them, Harry was upon him, pinning him to the door. “Did you have fun?” he asked, his mouth millimetres from Draco’s ear and his voice low. “In the restaurant?”
“No. But I’ll go and find out,” Pansy said, standing up. “The wine is chilling in the fridge anyway, so I have to go into the kitchen.”
Harry was still laughing as their lips met. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to Draco’s spontaneity or his fondness for celebrating something that he’d just read about in a Muggle newspaper, and if he was honest, he wasn’t sure he ever
Harry winced as Draco pulled the sandwich board out of the cupboard, causing a lot of noise. “Do you need a hand?”
“He told me that he loves Quidditch. That’s it. I don’t know what team he supports or anything else,” Harry sighed. “I know I do. Don’t worry, I’m not accepting any more dates after this one.”
, Pansy,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “We’re going for coffee and reading a book. Sometimes we eat a sandwich. But… yes.”
“No I know it’s not,” Ron replied, shaking his head. “But Hermione was on about doing things for our parents
“How old is he?” Harry asked, frowning. In all the years he’d known Angelina, he’d never heard her talk about a cousin so he couldn’t be around their age.
“No. I still want to keep you to myself for now,” Harry said. “I thought about telling them, but no, I’ll wait until after Christmas like we said.”
Harry shook his head again. “Nope. I thought it was strange too. I even expected them to be a bit put out by it, but they didn’t seem to be. Hopefully they won’t be in such a rush to arrange any more dates for me.”
Pansy laughed. “He is in the kitchen. I have no idea what he’s doing, but the smells coming out of there are incredible.”
Harry snorted. “Good point,” he said, lifting his cup to take a drink. “But this coffee makes your sacrifice worth it.”
“Good. Now, come on, let’s get caught up on these orders,” Draco said, nudging Harry’s arm. “If we both work on them, we’ll get them done in plenty of time.”
“Well, yeah. I don’t think they’ll stop setting me up any time soon just because I’m going on a second date with ‘Adam’,” Harry said, shrugging. “They’ll already be thinking of someone else to set me up with in case this doesn’t work out.”
, so we played ‘I Spy’. The rain ruined our afternoon. We’re normally a lot busier than that on a Monday.”
“Aside from rendering him unconscious, it has also caused some – hopefully temporary – paralysis similar to a full body bind,” the Healer replied, frowning as he checked a chart that was floating beside him. “It is almost like he is being kept in a suspended state of consciousness that we can’t break into.”
They fell silent for a few moments as they began to eat. Harry concentrated on his sandwich, while simultaneously trying not to let his coffee go cold.
“Alright, I’ll be back soon,” Draco replied with another grin. He gave Harry a wave and headed back down the aisle towards the café.
Frowning, he plated his food up and carried it across to the table, still deep in thought. He began to eat absentmindedly, wondering when he’d started to feel this way about Draco. He knew it hadn’t been this way when they’d first started working together, not given the amount of arguments they’d had over those first few months. Narcissa had made sure she was always present while they were working back then. It hadn’t been until they’d proven they weren’t about to hex each other silly that she’d felt comfortable enough to leave them alone in the shop, and now they ran the shop together with only occasional visits from the Malfoy matriarch.
“I’ve been making it for years,” Draco admitted, relief evident on his face. “In the hopes that someday you’d get to try it.”
Draco shrugged. “This is nothing special, but I wanted to make an effort given that it’s our first Valentine’s Day together.”
“Oh, believe me, I can,” Harry said with a laugh. “I imagine you felt much the same as I did when I thought about leaving my aunt and uncle’s house. Granted, I didn’t actually leave under the circumstances I’d always imagined, but it
“Probably somewhere like the Manor,” Draco replied as they turned the corner towards the coffee shop. “She seemed the type.”
“Really? They didn’t want to know anything about who you were seeing or what you did?” Draco asked, surprised.
Breaking into a smile, she nodded. “I’ll go and get the paperwork and you should be able to take him with you today. Have you got a carrier?”
“I enjoy it,” Harry replied with a shrug. “It’s just the kind of thing I was looking for after leaving the Aurors. It’s a much more peaceful way of life.”
They parted and settled themselves to watch as the sky changed from bright blue through a range of oranges, pinks and purples, Harry leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“He ended the date early,” Harry said. “Left without even looking at me or saying a proper goodbye.”
“Mm, I know,” Draco murmured, his eyes travelling over Harry’s body from his chest, down to the erection that was standing flushed and proud. “I wanted to take your mind off our fight.”
“This is the lounge,” Draco said, gesturing for Harry to go into the room. “It’s not huge, but I like it well enough. And my sofa is the comfiest sofa I think I’ve ever sat on.”
“Ah. Maybe,” Harry said, nodding thoughtfully. “I suppose that way you can be prepared to deal with it properly.”
“Read, probably. Enjoy a nice mug of hot chocolate or a glass of wine and a good book,” Draco replied. “Have an early night so that I’m prepared when Pansy comes to regale me with tales of
“Then we’ll do that. It’ll be good,” Draco said, a small smile appearing on his face as he turned away from Harry, walking into the back room.
Harry nodded, ducking his head slightly. “Yes. As friends, you understand? He wanted to help me out, although I think he did have some selfish reasons too.”
“You have no idea,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Anyway. Can I get you anything else or is this it?”
“Alright, that works for me too,” Draco replied. “I’ll probably just have a sandwich while I’m getting ready too.”
“I do, I do,” Draco nodded. “I just like reminding you. Anyway, we should make a start on these arrangements. I’m not as familiar with dried flowers, so it might take some getting right.”
“Alright, let’s have a go then,” Harry said, sitting up and pointing at the sketchpad. “I’ll do this one, you do that one.”
“Ah, Potter, you’re here. Good,” Draco said, looking up as Harry entered. “We’ve got a lot to do this morning.”
Harry nodded, sighing at the same time. “Exactly. I thought we were past that whole thing. Like we were just saying yesterday that they’d stopped. Maybe I haven’t been talking about ‘Adam’ enough or something. Anyway, are you alright with a fake date on Saturday night?”
“The thought has crossed my mind,” Draco nodded. “But I didn’t give him a chance to explain properly.”
“No,” Draco panted, dragging the sandwich board into the front of the shop. “Here it is. Heavier than I remember.”
“Well, it’s certainly not the same as it used to be,” Draco replied with a sigh. “It hasn’t been since the end of the battle if I’m honest. Mother did her best to transform it, but it still feels tainted. I never tell her that, though. She’s happy with it.”
“Well, you’ve got your friends to thank for that,” Draco said. “If they weren’t setting you up on awful dates – which, by the way, how have they been your friends for so long without knowing the kind of person they should be setting you up with? – we wouldn’t have been on this journey together.”
Draco shook his head. “No, definitely not. You probably won’t understand, given your home situation while we were at school, but after spending nineteen years there you can’t imagine how much of a relief it was to finally have some proper independence.”
The week passed quickly and before they knew it, it was Saturday night and they were locking up after another busy day.
“Of course,” Draco replied, pressing his slips to Harry’s once more for a brief, light kiss. “To sleep, or… ?”
Draco shrugged as he plonked the bucket in the sink and squirted some disinfectant into it before turning the tap on. “There’s no-one on the scene at the minute. I’m okay with it. After being in here all day, I never want to see another Valentine’s bouquet for at least–”
Draco grinned and shifted so that he could kiss Harry hungrily, pinning him to the sofa with one hand.
Harry followed him around the rest of the house, being continually surprised by Draco’s choice of decor in each room. Each room except one. He wasn’t shown into Draco’s bedroom, which he supposed was to be expected.
“No, that’s good enough for what we want right now,” Draco nodded. He took out his own wand, casting the same spell as Harry had done. “Now let’s see what these bouquets look like.”
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry about him. He’s not as bad as he likes to make out. Anyway, it’s not like you don’t know them all.”
“They weren’t. I knocked one of the display units while I was… sweeping and you know that potted orchid we had?” Draco replied, making a face.
Harry shook his head. “I’ll be honest, they were left over at the shop and Draco said I could take them,” he said. “They’re in addition to your proper present.”
we could maybe do something a bit active,” Harry continued. “Like we could walk down to Barnard Park and have a stroll and lunch at the pub there.”
“Yeah, and full of Dark magical objects,” Harry replied. “It took a while, but it’s all good now. You’ll see when you come for dinner.”
Ginny laughed as she made her way to the door. “Don’t worry. I’ll be there for the next one. I’ve told Mum to make sure it’s not a night before a big match.”
“Then why did you?” Draco asked, his frown turning into a hurt expression. “I thought we could talk to each other about things like this.”
“She’s changed since school, just like we have,” Draco shrugged. “She’s been very supportive, I’ll have you know.”
“Oh, bugger, have I not put one out?” Harry groaned, standing on his tiptoes to look over Ginny’s shoulder.
“Not the same as he was,” Draco said quietly. “I mean, in a way that’s good. Less of the inclination to follow insane maniacs. But he’s not even… we can’t have proper conversations anymore. The time he spent in Azkaban has certainly taken its toll on him.”
Draco was always very aware of his surroundings when he was in Pansy’s home, simply due to all of the Muggle contraptions it contained. He was very grateful that the armchairs and sofa had been taken from Pansy’s family home. “Alright,” he said, fixing Pansy with a look. “Spill the tea.”
“Stop! Don’t you dare sing another word of that,” Harry laughed, swatting lightly at Draco’s arm. “I’d almost forgotten it.”
Yet, when he thought about spending time with Draco, he felt none of the distrust he’d had for so long at school. It was one of the reasons he’d been so quick to tell Ron he already had a date, along with the prospect of spending more time in Bookworms and Brews. Spending time with Draco was now something he quite looked forward to on a daily basis. They still challenged each other, it was just more light-hearted now and they could laugh together instead of at one another. It hadn’t been easy, getting to that point, but after years working together, their relationship was certainly much improved.
Draco laughed. “You’re not getting old, well, you are but it’s fine, it’s happening to us all. If it makes you feel better, I like being able to have a proper conversation too.”
“Yes, well, I am prepared to forgive and forget about that,” Draco said, looking at Harry. “As long as you talk to me about things in future, no matter how awkward.”
As the water began to cool off, Harry carefully pushed himself to his feet and climbed out of the bath, allowing his warm, fluffy robe to envelop him before his body really noticed the temperature difference. He leaned down and pulled the plug on the bath, muttering a quick spell that he knew would have the tub sparkling once the water had all drained away.
“I was alright, just starting to feel a little bit peckish as we got here,” Draco replied. “That has hit the spot though.”
“With Blaise Zabini as a friend, a lot of conversations in later years revolved around girls. Not to mention Pansy throwing herself at me at every opportunity,” Draco replied with a chuckle. “I love Pansy, but as a sister, I suppose. Definitely not in any other way.”
“That won’t be necessary, thank you,” Harry laughed. “I don’t mind being a couple of pages behind you.”
“Ah. No. That is not my style at all,” Draco said, shaking his head. “After spending so long looking at all that mahogany and dark paint, I vowed to have something completely different when I bought the place. Do you like it?”
Draco snorted. “Fair enough. I suppose Quidditch players do have a bit of a reputation and that’s something that you don’t need now.”
“No I don’t suppose you do,” Harry said softly. “You know I’m not sorry he got punished, but I am sorry you don’t have the same relationship anymore.”
Draco snorted again. “Well, actually, you’re in luck. I did make one. I’d had enough of Christmas pudding at the Manor.”
“Heathen,” Draco said, taking another sip from his mug. “Anyway, what do you think of the book so far? I know you’re enjoying it, but what specifically?”
Harry felt his heart sink slightly. It wasn’t that he, Ron and Hermione spent every weekend getting drunk, but they certainly didn’t want to be preached at for having a few drinks on a night out after a busy working week.
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything. He opened the box and peered inside. “Lemon drizzle?”
Draco snorted again. “Alright, so… ? You’ll have to think of something because I’m not as familiar with acceptable Muggle names.”
Harry’s frown deepened as he considered the question. His past relationships were certainly varied, and nothing alike except for Ginny and Charlie. “I don’t think I have a type…”
“Not much, to be honest,” Pansy said with a sigh. “It was quite disappointing. But now you’re here, you can tell me.”
A wall of gentle noise reached their ears. Muted chatter was mixed with gently clinking china from the café that was fairly close to the entrance, and the air smelled of a mixture of leather, wood polish and freshly brewed coffee.
“Have at it,” Draco said, stepping back. “I’ll go and find a box to put the votes in. And some cards for the votes to be recorded on.”
Harry laughed and made his way around the room to hand the remaining bunches of flowers to Ginny and Angelina. “No Blaise, Ginny?”
“I’m going, I’m going,” Harry said, swatting at Draco slightly as he set off down the aisle. Reaching the chairs and table, he took his cloak off and hung it on the coat rack that stood beside the wood burner.
Draco nodded, pushing his sleeves up and taking a crate from the driver. He carried it across the room and put it onto the table that lined the wall where they would be able to check all of the bunches once they were done.
Charlie opened a cupboard and took out two mugs, before pulling the tea chest out and opening it. He picked out a chamomile tea bag for Harry before rifling through the selection and picking out a Yorkshire Tea bag for himself. He deposited the bags into the mugs and waited for the water to boil. “So, you mentioned that you didn’t want me to say anything to the family…”
He pushed the kitchen door open and headed for the stairs, sticking his head into the living room on his way past. Frowning again, he climbed the stairs two at a time.
“Now you mention it, it does ring a bell,” Draco replied. “Forget I said anything. Someone came in to order a wreath just before you got back. I was going to do it, but I think you need it more than me. Here. I wrote it down.”
“Well I suppose that would make sense,” Harry nodded. “I half-expected her to tell me to bring him for dinner.”
“Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine. Are you going to go for your lunch now?” Draco said, leaning against the wall.
Harry groaned as he shut the door to his office behind him, turning to rest his back against the glass.
“Goodness me, you’re keen to read more of that book, aren’t you?” Draco asked, blinking in surprise as he found himself propelled towards the café.
“But if it works out, then you’d have the best of both worlds,” Pansy said. “Lover, best friend and colleague all rolled into one.”
“It’s spaghetti. Hardly the tidiest food to eat,” Draco replied, shrugging. “I have trouble with it so I can’t imagine you’re any better.”
“A year?” Harry asked with a grin, sweeping some more fallen petals off the counter and into the bin.
“Anything that helps you feel better,” Harry said with a smile. “I don’t want you being bored anymore.”
Draco nodded. “That’s better. Not as easy to confuse for my name. How old? Our age? Where did you meet him?”
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry, I’m not complaining. Just surprised that this completely random day in June could be so busy.”
Harry didn’t know how he got through the rest of the meal, but he did. Lucius had questioned him several times, but had seemed satisfied with the responses he’d given and had gone back to his food each time with a roll of his eyes.
“Okay, so no need to apologise again. He knows you’re sorry,” Charlie said. “Maybe take him a coffee when you first go in, but then just keep conversations work related unless he brings up anything else. Let him make the move. Do you think he’s angry or hurt?”
Harry snorted. “I wouldn’t care if they did. Although it would probably raise some awkward questions from Molly next time I see her.”
“Then why is your face tripping you up?” Draco asked from where he was sitting behind the counter, a brochure open in front of him.
Draco leaned over and nodded. “Looks like it. Put them to one side and we’ll sort that when we’re done checking the rest.”
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t keep the smile off his face. “Yeah, yeah. Alright, are we all done here now?”
“Look. This is obviously stressing you out. Why don’t you tell them next time they ask you about a date, that you already have one,” Draco said, the idea coming to him in bits. “Then let me know and I’ll arrange something better.”
Twenty minutes later, they were standing on the doorstep of The Burrow. Harry gripped Draco’s hand tightly. “Ready?”
everyone to think, but if you’d really hated him, you would have done a lot worse to him than you did,” Pansy said, waving her hand. “It was always interesting, watching the two of you.”
Harry chuckled and shrugged. “I don’t know, but it feels right. Anyway, you get on alright with him now. I’ve seen it plenty of times in the shop.”
“My ‘date’ on Saturday night?” Harry said with a sigh as he turned back to face Draco. “Turned out that Conor liked the idea of being seen with me more than he liked the idea of actually getting to know me. He spent the whole night talking to other people while I just stood there like a spare part.”
Ginny laughed. “Well that’s good. I don’t think your career would last long if your best friend beat up the boss's son.”
Draco watched him for a moment before moving into the back room to pick up some florist’s foam. “Hey, Harry?”
“Probably,” Draco said, shrugging slightly. “I honestly haven’t thought about it. This ham is delicious, don’t you think?”
Harry shook his head. “No, of course not. He just preferred to concentrate on his work rather than finding a boyfriend.”
Harry ladled some baked beans onto his plate and carried it over to the table, sitting down. He turned and opened the cutlery drawer behind him, taking out a knife and fork as a second thought. He began to cut into his fried egg.
“Back in a second then,” Harry replied as he reached the door, slipping through it and heading down the street. It was a good thing that the coffee shop was open from six am, he thought.
“I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, nodding. “I would be too, given how much I’ve talked about it.”
“I am helping out a friend,” Draco said firmly. “There is nothing going on between Harry and I. And even if there was, we wouldn’t let it affect our work.”
Harry gave a soft huff of laughter. The blurb was short and sweet, and if he was honest, reminded him of himself and Draco. He could certainly see why it had grabbed Draco’s attention. Placing the book on the table again, Harry looked around. The atmosphere was just as cosy as it had been on his first visit. The wood burner was crackling away, making their alcove nicely warm. Strictly speaking, he thought it should be too warm for a wood burner to be on, but there seemed to be a charm at work to prevent things from getting
Harry drained his coffee cup and threw it into the bin before joining Draco at the door to bring the delivery in.
“How in Merlin’s name did you find out about that?” Draco asked, whipping his head around to look at her.
“Oh, I love roast chicken,” Draco said, pausing for a moment with a faraway look on his face. “I can’t remember the last time I had it.”
“Excellent!” George said, rubbing his hands together. “We’ll see you on Saturday then. Meet at seven o’clock at The Leaky and then we’ll go from there.”
“Yes, please,” Harry said, leaning forward to put his plate on the low table. “Let’s get another chapter read.”
“Neither have I, but I saw some in one of those magazines we were looking at when we were rejigging the stock,” Harry replied. “I thought they looked good and wondered
“Really?” Harry asked, his eyebrows lifting until they disappeared under his fringe. “I wouldn’t have put those two together.”
“I agree. It was probably the first brand new thing I brought into the house,” Harry smiled. “A good bed is very important.”
They parted and headed in opposite directions down the alley. Harry glanced over his shoulder briefly to watch Draco walk away. Since they’d broken the news to their families and friends, they’d spent more nights together than apart and it felt odd to him that they were going their separate ways tonight in particular. However, they had both agreed that doing things exactly how they’d done them the night of their first fake date was what they wanted to do. Given that they’d only been officially dating for two months, they hadn’t had any discussions about living arrangements and had just been staying at whichever house they felt like.
“No, well, let’s not talk of that,” Molly said, a small frown creasing her brow. “I’m glad you’re happy, Harry. You’re more than welcome to bring him for dinner when you’re ready, you know.”
Harry shook his head, pulling his own wallet out of his pocket, counting out his money. “Very reasonable, I’d say. Why don’t I come here more often?”
“It does,” Harry agreed, his eyes studying Draco’s face for a moment. Then, impulsively, he leaned forward and pressed their lips together. It wasn’t anything special, barely more than a peck, but the jolt he felt in his stomach told him that maybe, just maybe this was worth pursuing. “So… coffee?”
“Why not?” Draco shrugged, still smiling. “I told you. It’s International Kissing Day, and I think we should celebrate it.”
had a bad night. Alright, I’ll put them into a bucket and we can sell them as a clearance item. Someone might get a few days' use out of them.”
They spent another ten minutes finishing their coffee, chatting and admiring the view until Draco put his cup down. “Ready?”
“Thank you,” Harry said. “I agree, this has been fun and I will be forever grateful to you for doing it.”
“Draco! You’re early!” Pansy exclaimed as she opened the door. She leant forward to give him a kiss on each cheek. “Come in, come in. The weather is simply awful.”
“What would you say to a night of drinks and frivolity with me, Angelina and Angelina’s cousin?” George asked, a wide grin on his face. “Mum will have the kids so we can party all night long!”
“Ah yes, but that was your own daft fault! You and that hero complex of yours,” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow. “You were eleven, what on Earth made you and Weasley think you could take it on?”
“What arguing would there be?” Ginny asked, craning her neck to look at him from her place on the floor. “Everything’s fine.”
Draco nodded, picking up his glass to take a sip. “Indeed we can. That Christmas show will be starting soon and we have presents to exchange.”
“Just how is that supposed to help me, Potter?” Draco tutted, slapping Harry’s thigh with one hand. “If anything, that makes me
“No, I suppose not, but it’s still a bit weird isn’t it? Twenty years old is just… I don’t know, maybe my view of being twenty is a bit skewed,” Harry said, frowning slightly.
The next couple of weeks passed in a flurry of flower arrangements and it was soon Christmas Eve. While most shops along the alley had closed early, Paperwhite’s Petals was still open at five o’clock. There had been a steady stream of customers since they’d opened that morning and they hadn’t been able to bring themselves to close early.
“No problem,” Harry replied over his shoulder as he headed into the back room again. “Once the bouquet is gone, we’ll both be able to pitch in properly.”
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco said softly, still gazing into the pen. Mr McGregor had moved closer to the glass now, looking at them curiously. “I’m rather housebound at the moment myself, thanks to this leg of mine.”
“She caught me watching one of her brothers after he’d had a shower,” Harry admitted, a faint pink tinge appearing on his cheeks. “Before you ask, no, it wasn’t Ron. Or George.”
With a swish of his wand, the lamps flickered into life, bathing the living room in warm light, and the radio turned itself on. As the soft notes of jazz music filled the flat, he walked through to the kitchen to make himself something to eat. He’d become quite adept at cooking for himself since moving out, though Narcissa still occasionally tried to send him a house-elf to help him. Shaking his head, he smiled to himself as he remembered the last time he’d refused her offer. He put those thoughts to the back of his mind and concentrated on his food.
“Good point. Right, I think I’ve got everything I need,” Harry said, looking at the pile of flowers in the trug. “I’m going to make a start.”
“People are still bothering you, then?” Ron asked, giving him an amused look as he paused in his report writing.
“No, I think you’re probably right there,” Harry replied. “And I don’t think that Jeremy has had to die to save everyone else, but it’s still nice to see similarities isn’t it?”
Draco nodded, squeezing the mop out before beginning to swirl it around the floor, starting at the door.
“Who would have thought this would be so difficult?” Harry asked softly, a smile on his face as he looked down at his coffee cup. “It’s like being fifteen all over again.”
Draco laughed. “Alright, alright, don’t worry about it. I was kidding. I’ll make a start out the back and get everything tidied in there.”
“Do you think there’s anywhere on the alley that will sell something like that?” Harry asked. “I want to make this a special bouquet.”
Draco bit his lip briefly before sighing heavily and tipping his head back to look up at the hanging display. Then he frowned. “Did you put mistletoe in this display?”
“I think they just want to be sure you’re alright,” Ron said, half shrugging. “You’re nearing thirty and most people are settling down by thirty…”
They made it to the end of the month without Harry having to ask Draco to keep him company on another ‘date’, as the message that Harry was, indeed, serious about ‘Adam’ seemed to have got through to his friends.
“Hi Harry,” Ginny smiled, approaching the counter, her hands stuffed into the pockets of her duffle coat. “I hear I missed an eventful dinner the other night.”
“At least your mother was surprised,” Draco muttered, shaking his head and causing Ginny to snort with laughter.
Ron nodded and turned to watch as the steaming pudding floated across to the table. “If we meet anyone we think you’d like, can we still set you up?”
Harry snorted. “You know, I think you’re right. That rings a bell. We probably should have expected it then, shouldn’t we?”
“Please, Pansy, we’ll be eating soon,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose. “I do not need to be picturing you two kinky bastards while I’m tucking into my food.”
“Well of course we can. A colour theme for the display is a good idea though,” Draco replied. “What did you have in mind?”
Harry snorted. “Fair enough. Alright, I’ll come in casual clothes. Would you like me to bring anything with me?”
Harry, who found himself missing the warmth of Draco’s shoulder, shrugged. “I don’t know. Have we not got any orders we could make up?”
Harry shuffled backwards, realising that he was still holding the bucket. “I was, but I didn’t expect George to… he asked what I was doing on Saturday and I was up to my neck in orders – which I’m now behind on – and I didn’t think he was going to ask if I wanted to go on a date.”
“We will be the best dressed people in the café,” Harry said with a grin. “So, are we having sandwiches or takeaway?”
“This is all quite new to me,” Harry said. “I’ve never really thought about the wider wizarding population of London before.”
