All throughout the descend deep underground Draco tried to keep his face neutral, which was difficult. He never had trouble appearing calm while in distress, but when a smile tried to break out, it wasn't as easy. Especially because the bulk of positive emotions Draco felt came from Harry. Draco tried to use different mind tricks that sometimes helped to detach himself from what he was seeing and feeling. But, as it was the case most of the times, it was barely of any use. Draco's cock had woken up even from that imaginary light spanking, and now it was rock hard. Arousal was arousal, and his body was never able to differentiate its own from Harry's. More so because Harry's seemed so much more intense, easily overshadowing its own.
"I can't just do it with some stranger!"
After inhaling deeply Draco held his breath, knowing that this would prevent his already waking up dick from hardening further, musing where to go to spend the rest of his lunch break.
"Huh?"
"Oh, really? Thank you for reminding me. Completely slipped my mind... I said YOUR blood, Potter!"
"Potter, no IFs! You hardly have much more than a minute or two to decide before you would be able to add a Murderer to the list of your titles. After which expulsion from Hogwarts would be the least of your worries. Does the word Azkaban ring a bell?" Harry nodded. "Is that a yes to giving your blood or merely you remembering what Azkaban is? You have to say it properly!"
"Do you see me laughing? There's your answer... We're having a pretty good time with just oral and handjobs anyway. Why spoil it?"
"Whatever you say."
"It's like you're having an anti-witch prejudice!"
"- implanted memory. Of course. Descartes would be proud of you."
"Don't talk as if I'm not here!" he said, barely containing himself from going into tirade about Harry telling her about his house arrest.
No matter what Draco had tried. No matter all the Occlumency specialists he had consulted. Nothing had ever helped. Multiple healers, who had found nothing, had asked him to bring Harry along to check everything more thoroughly and from other possible angles. Not that Draco had ever mentioned that it was Harry's thoughts that he had been tuning in on a regular basis. Or the precise and limited nature of those thoughts.
"I bet you simply haven't gotten a good blowjob... That's where the problem lies." Draco huffed. "With you sequestered away for years you must have -"
"Pff... It's so... It doesn't even count really. Don't break the law and read ONE book a month that Hermione gives me? When I was six or seven there was much more that was expected of me. The expectations were different, sure, but the pressure was already there."
"Isn't still hating him is against Hermione's program?"
"The agreement was for you and me. Not for you, me, and a bottle of wine."
As he stepped into the packed lift he glanced at the tableau, only to see that the button to his level was already glowing. He sidestepped to the other side of the cabin, knowing that most of the people behind him would come out earlier. With his single free hand, because his other one was holding two newly-purchased books, he grabbed one of the handles dangling from the ceiling a moment before the lift started moving backwards.
"I... I rather wait for... Ehm... Professor Dumbledore."
Then, when they were past the minus sixth level, to not much of a surprise, it turned into fucking. No preamble. With Draco once again being clad in the outfit from the cafeteria.
"Come on... Give me a handy..." Draco huffed and stepped under the second showerhead. "I gave you head. Well, for a few seconds at least."
Draco stared at Harry completely speechless, in shock; his mind barely started to process Harry giving him a handjob as it turned into a blowjob. Everything happened so quickly. The sensations that Harry's mouth provided washed over him in waves and blanked his mind, so the idea of stopping Harry didn't even enter his thoughts. Through the confusion he had one thought - it felt good. Such sensations he hasn't had in a while.
"What if I'm really gay like she said?"
"Currently? Stroking your cock. But in a second I'm going to be sucking on it," he said simply. Then leaned down and enveloped the tip with his lips.
"Just being honest, I guess... I'm in Hermione's program and I am actively trying to become a better person, right? At least officially. So it all might be an act to make you let your guard down. Who knows? Definitely me. But there's no possible way you would ever know for sure."
"I meant to say that you better try it out on him and a few others beforehand. Also think about whether you want to confuse them further by claiming that you're bisexual. Because -"
"The Slytherin way?"
"Ouch! Be more careful!" said Harry theatrically as the sponge grazed his crotch. "Or should I better say to be more gentle?"
"Well..." Harry skidded closer to Draco and pressed his fully naked body to Draco's pyjamas-clad one. "Either way, my-sober-self has enough love for the two of us."
"You mean... Just... A single kiss?" slurred out a fairly drunk Draco.
"Neat? Did you just call it neat?"
"Because."
"But I like having sex!" said Harry standing beside Draco's bed, clutching a pillow he brought along hoping to get in bed with Draco for the first time without having any prior discussion about it.
"Try it."
"You don't love me so stop saying that!"
I turn around and start walking towards the door. Ten steps at most. I walk slowly, I'm in no rush, barely a step per second, so Malfoy has whole ten seconds. Now eight. To stop me and finally... No! He wouldn't as always. Because he's a selfish prick! I don't need it anyway... But what if... No! Stop thinking about that! And don't even think about turning around! Five more steps. But maybe he wants ME to ask? No way in hell I'm going to ask! Three steps; and I'm definitely not slowing my steps down. I already sucked his cock, why can't I ask? Because! ... And he doesn't even have to ask. He can just go down on his knees and I'd get the cue. I grab the handle and open the door. Last chance to ask. For him, not for me! I make a step into the corridor. I glance at him as I'm closing the door and my heart skips a beat as I see him lean down, but immediately I realize that it's him just reaching for his pants.
Harry was about to refill his glass as Draco grabbed the bottle and yanked it out of Harry's hand. Which he wouldn't have dared to do just months ago.
"Me obviously. And you know it already. Why are we even talking about this AGAIN?"
"Sure."
So soon after lunch all stalls of the bathroom stood empty, which was perfect for Draco. He dropped his books on the table with auto-replenishing rolled-up towels and stepped to a sink to wash his hands. He never understood why people washed their hands only afterwards, and not before as well. He sure was not going to be touching his dick, especially touching it so thoroughly, with dirty hands.
"Tomorrow..." muttered Harry and turned away. Unlike Draco, Harry had to wake up early in the morning.
"Harry's might be impaired and you're not impartial because if Malfoy plots something, it would mean your RJ program isn't as successful."
Draco snorted. "So? Is that supposed to be an argument? Muggles are superior in all this thing. There's no point in denying the obvious. I mean, had I known about this, I would've stopped being a shithead way-way earlier."
"I'm sure you can... But this feels better, right?" Draco huffed. "Admit it. ... Not going to?" Draco kept pretending he didn't hear that. "Maybe then I should just stop?" Draco still gave no reaction. "Alright then." Harry pulled his hands away and waited for a few seconds for a reaction, but got none. Harry sighed and patted Draco's back. "Don't worry. I'll finish you off. But first things first. Turn."
Draco long ago acquiesced and stopped considering himself straight, but he still had not dared to try it with a man. Mostly because it seemed that the only man he was drawn to was Harry. Draco was not even sure whether he found Harry attractive, at least attractive the same way as women. He was only certain about his own desire that Harry's suggestive or outright pornographic thoughts never failed to ignite within him.
Ron's face got red and he almost knocked Hermione off her feet when he abruptly stopped and turned around. He grabbed her wrist and led her back.
"Fuck that! Give me a real answer!"
Finally I think it's time for the main course. I tug the foreskin back, revealing the pale pink glans. They look glossy from the precum and so smooth that I almost can see my distorted reflection in them. Merlin, his cock looks fine... Thank god, Malfoy accidentally learned by dirty little secret. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a chance to do this.
"Potter, you won't turn me gay or whatever you're trying to do."
"So you really don't want to do it?"
Hermione closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths, then said, "If today you're going to make a peep about it to either of them, you're going... No, I meant to say I'm going to be sleeping on the sofa until the end of the summer. Got it?" Ron nodded without trying to hide that he was less than happy about it. "And no more checking anything! Your wand stays in your holster until we get home."
Harry sighed. "I don't have time to explain now. Just don't touch anything that seems too muggle. Stove in particular."
Harry sighed as he stroked his cock. "Feels good. Thanks."
Ever since, things only escalated. Harry's fixation on cumming on food, and then usually Draco eating it, was one of several most recent additions. Chocolate desserts being his Harry's favourite because on them semen was most visible. Overall Draco was never able to understand Harry's fascination with semen that bordered on obsession. And because the realm of unreal had no constrains, the amount of cum one of them produced for Harry to play with sometimes exceeded what even the strongest male fertility potions were able provide.
"Well, I... I ate already so I'm going to bed. Good night."
The spanking was not rough and was done in a playful manner, looking more like Harry was patting Draco's naked, obviously, bum - Potter wasn't a sadist. The reason? Draco leaving the cafeteria when apparently he shouldn't have. It wasn't said in words, but it did not have to be, Draco was just able to understand the reason. He felt it. He was able to disassociate from that emotion to a degree, but partially it still felt like self-flagellation, as if he was unhappy with himself for leaving. Luckily it soon was overshadowed by Harry's arousal. The whole thing was erotic and amusing at the same time. Who else would call Draco a bad boy in a reproachful tone while giving him soft pats on his bare behind? The approach on its own was a turned on for Draco.
Draco instinctively was about to go right, where his office was, but at the last moment he turned on his heel and went in the opposite direction, to the lounge, where the bathroom was. He decided that working without taking care of his problem would not be productive.
"You could just get a girlfriend and then talk her into a threesome."
Harry nodded and got down onto the carpet inbetween Draco's legs. Draco was as always already slumped way down, but Harry grabbed him under the knees and yanked him to himself even more, so that his bum ended up just at the edge of the couch.
"Yep. The blue nail-polish seems alright. Though I prefer a clear one or none at all."
"You're being ridiculous. I mean, if she really were fat, then I'd understand."
"I told you about it," said Harry. "That kind of special closeness when I was in somebody. That is what I miss." Draco raised an eyebrow. "Not that we're not close! I just... Ehm..."
"Exactly. Just say that I should go to my knees and choke on your cock. ... Or to lie on the couch with my head hanging over the armrest so you can go around and fuck my throat."
"...And?"
"No... But I'd turn into a witch and let you fuck me if you were into it!"
"It is my business what I do in my free time as long as I don't break any laws!"
Draco did not forget that Harry had an invisibility cloak. But so what? With Draco's self-consciously-driven paranoia there hardly could have been a possibility for Harry to spy on him wanking. Even back in Hogwarts, or more so in there, since Draco had been even more uptight back then. But overall Draco did not think that Harry spying on him wanking was something Harry would do. Draco thought that the most plausible option was for Harry to pay some of Draco's past girlfriends to get a memory to see in a Pensieve. And if so, Harry, of course, would've paid handsomely on top of that for a magically binding non-disclosure clause, so there was no point of contacting them to inquire.
"First of all, chances are, this hypothetical girlfriend wouldn't agree. And second - I already have a boyfriend."
"It's just weirds me out to see two men going at it. I don't see two men when we do stuff."
"Of course only if I find out."
"Okay..." Harry said and pecked the back of Draco's neck. "You're saying that as if I ever asked."
"And with sound!"
"I want... to cum... in your mouth," said faux-Draco breathlessly.
"But I want more!"
"Malfoy bewitched Harry!" he said through gritted teeth.
"Nothing," said Harry without turning away from the book he was reading.
Draco froze mid-bite and his cheeks got a bit pink. He put his fork down and as calmly as he could muster said, "So what if I was? I finished my shift. I was back here on time. Nobody said that it wasn't allowed. What laws did I break exactly?"
"It's hardly muggle with you asking me to do things that -"
I tried to give blowjobs to strangers. And I hated it. Every single time. So even Malfoy, relationship with whom I hardly even can call friendly, is by orders of magnitude better than some stranger. I just can't do it with strangers for some reason; I always have to know a person well. I don't know any muggles; all of my my friends and acquaintances are from the wizarding world. Malfoy is the only one who knows that I'm bi. At least he's the only one with a cock who knows it. If only she knew who I'm doing it with... But carte blanche means she doesn't have to know.
“Unless there’s anything else you’d like to say or ask.”
“Ok.” Harry said as he swam toward Draco.
Harry stared at the smooth skin shown to him for a moment and willed his blood to stop rushing toward his groin. “Oh. Well uh… maybe you should take them off so I can compare your real height to mine.” He congratulated himself on keeping his voice even.
Just then another knock sounded throughout the room. Harry got up to answer the locked the door.
“Harry, why won’t you tell anyone what he’s doing to you?” Draco asked as he pulled the smaller boy into his arms.
“How does that feel?” He asked when he pulled away a minute or so later.
The pair laid together in an amiable silence for long enough that Harry nearly fell asleep. He was only pulled back to awareness when pale, nimble fingers found their way to his semi-soft cock. He looked down their bodies to see Draco was already standing at attention.
“I-I hurt you.” He replied faintly.
“You sounded like you were in pain
Scorpius gave the girl a watery smile and attempted to hold back the happy tears that threatened to fall.
“I agree punishment is in order, but… he didn’t completely go against us.” Harry calmly explained.
“Hmm?”
The nineteen year old blanched. “Yes?”
“Can I-I stay here?” Harry asked nervously.
“Yes.” Harry hissed in pleasure.
Harry rolled his eyes. “But you’re
Harry frowned. “Why do you think he’s sick?”
“It’s alright, Harry.” She said softly as she walked out of the room at a brisk pace.
Draco felt his entire body shudder as he pressed himself as deep into her as he could go, nearly roaring his release as he filled her with his warm seed.
“We found out about a week into August last year. By that time he was nearly a month along. The next day we made an appointment with Healer McNamara. Everything was going fine; at least, that’s what we thought.” Harry explained.

When Draco pulled away to let them breathe, Harry's knee buckled. Luckily, the blonde held him up.
Not wanting to spend so much time in close proximity with two wizards, Mrs. Dursley hurried back to the kitchen when neither boy said anything.
“I want you.” Harry muttered against his lover’s mouth.
Harry was astonished. He couldn’t remember the last time Draco had something so inconsiderate. Finally, he recovered from his shock. “I grew up without parents… so I’m a slut. Is that what you’re saying?”
“If you’re going to be like that…” Draco teased, crossed his arms, and looked away from the adorably shocked brunette.
Potter, not because of this.” He said gently and laid a hand on the shorter
“No, they’ve already been woken up once. Let them sleep.” Draco replied. He then spotted the unfamiliar person in the room. “Who’s she?”
For the first time all over again, their lips met in a fiery kiss. But kissing Harry was somehow different than kissing Harlot. She had been confident, while he was much more shy. Being in another’s skin must have made quite a difference.
The auror lightly touched his shoulder. “You couldn’t’ve known. It’s okay. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
When Draco was fully seated with his balls against Harry's ass, he waited, panting at the feeling of pressure surrounding him. “A-are you alright, love?” He asked in a slightly shaky voice.

“Sit down, Weasley!” Snape said fiercely. Reluctantly, Ron obeyed.
“Have a seat.” Ethan offered as he moved a few articles of clothing from the full size bed to his pile of dirty clothes in the corner. The raven-haired teen plopped himself down and got comfortable while his host tidied up a bit.
“If you absolutely must, you can pay me back later when you have the money to do so.” Harry responded with finality.

back to the page he was on, the girl had raised an arm to reach for a book on a
Immediately Harry tensed and Draco would have thought he had cum if it weren’t for the terrified look in his eyes. He stopped moving to let Harry calm down.
“Gladly.” Draco breathed as he bent down to explore Harry’s mouth with his tongue.
Suddenly Harry found himself on his back with the other man hovering above him. “Slide up,” he was directed. He did as told and before he knew it, Draco was lying on top of him, their tongues battling for dominance once again.
Harry smiled as his feet hit the ground.

The brunette shook his head. “I’ve just been wondering something for a while, about four months to be exact.” Harry started. He glanced down at Scorpius before looking back up. “Not that I don’t think it suits him, but why did you pick Scorpius?”
“He was crying?” Harry asked, shocked to hear that more than anything else.
When Draco started moving faster, he grabbed the top of the headboard for more leverage. Doing so made him lean further forward and as he dropped down again, the head of Harry's cock pushed right against his prostate and he couldn’t hold back the high-pitched scream that erupted from his throat.
Not trusting his voice, Harry managed a small nod.
A moment later, the pain that was becoming all too familiar to Harry began again and he was pushing with everything he had.
Harry nodded and watched the boy happily run off. He sighed in relief that his curious son didn’t have any questions after that. After all, he had a cute blonde man that needed de-stressing.
“Quicker than you think, I took the
“Good, good.” Vernon clapped his hands together jovially. “Here, let me get the door for you.” The large man practically ran down the hall.
Unable to find his voice at the moment, Harry nodded and before he even stopped, Draco bowed his head and in one fluid movement sucked Harry fully into his mouth.
“And you’re sure you’re okay with this?” The brunette asked warily. “I don’t want to make you do something you’re not ready for.”
Ethan brought their lips together once more as he complied.
“I can come back in?” Draco asked skeptically.

“Everything.” Draco replied. “At work I have to redo half my subordinate’s papers because they can’t do anything right. I get paperwork from other departments on my desk because

drawn just in case someone followed him.
“What is it?” Harry asked as he looked up at the other man.
“How’s the baby?” The bushy haired girl asked next.
A dark brow was raised. “Just like my dad.” Scorpius stated rather than asked, a half smile on his lips.
For a few minutes, the couple just watched their tiny son sleep.
“Hmm?”
By the time he’d actually reached the door, Draco had planned on telling whoever it was to bugger off. But when he got to it, he could hear sniffling between knocks.
Another hour passed when Anna Manuel seemed satisfied with the amount of information she garnered from the pair of young men.
A shriek reverberated around the tiled bathroom when Draco felt a pair of arms wrap around his waist from behind. If you asked him though, he would deny any such sound ever came from his lips and that it was, in fact, a very manly yell.
Before anyone could reply, Oliver stood from his chair and marched into the kitchen. It was silent for a few seconds before the three Potter-Malfoys heard a shout of, “Get your arse home, NOW!”
Harry laughed at his husband’s enthusiasm. “Could be a month.” He teased. “Could be a week.”
Harry stood in his window, watching Draco’s retreating back only to note a familiar car already parked outside the house. He watched as Eric exited the vehicle and walked up the sidewalk.
Instead of continuing with words, Ethan leaned forward and placed a small, chaste kiss on Scorpius’ pale lips.

noticed that her skirt was far too short and assumed she had probably borrowed
“How did I do what, love?”
“Like hell are you keeping those things in.” Draco seethed.
Harry sputtered and coughed as he fell backwards, arms flailing, and knocked the lamp off his nightstand as he went. He sat there a moment, coughing. In the background, he could vaguely hear Draco apologizing.
“Now then, for the next month, I would you like to meet with Ms. Haysley every Wednesday night at seven o’clock. At the end of the fourth session, the three of us will decide how often you should continue meeting with her. It could stay the same or be reduced but we won’t make you see her more often than you like.” Dumbledore explained.
A voice finally broke its way through Harry's trance. He looked up at Draco who was walking next to the stretcher that was now being rushed toward the hospital wing.
“Harry…” He sighed once they parted, trailing off when he wasn’t sure what he wanted to say.
Harry cried out in both pain and pleasure. He arched up into the mouth sucking him partly to get more of the wet heat and partly because he was trying to get away from the pain.
“I’m a wizard.” Scorpius finally piped up. “I thought
“Oh, my.” Narcissa said softly, bringing a hand to her mouth.
At the door, Remus turned back and said, “We’ll be spending the night so if you need anything later on, we’ll probably be just a few beds down from you.” Harry nodded and watched the two men leave.
“The baby.” Draco said with a smile. “It’s from Hermione. Shall I open it?” He asked slyly, tearing the shiny, blue paper slightly.
Harry didn’t need to respond verbally. The continued reddening of his face and down turned head was answer enough. “I didn’t want you to think it was a big deal.” He said with a shrug.
Draco put a hand on either of side of Harry's face to capture his attention and gave him another kiss. “I love you.” He said with his forehead against the other’s.
“That’s easy for you to say.” Harry groused. “I’ll probably have all of my summer homework done in three days. What am I supposed to do after that?”
Harry sighed again but allowed his
“How bad was the damage done to Harry’s body?” Dumbledore asked.
“What’s going on?” Ron asked as he came to.
Draco smiled down at his sleepy lover. “You said that ten minutes ago now. If you don’t get up soon, we’ll be late.”

“I’m staying here.” He replied somberly.

to be something else we can do. We have hundreds of books filled with the old laws we could look through, see if we can find something in one of them.” Draco suggested as calmly as he could.
With a great sigh, green eyes finally popped open. “Alright, alright. I’m up.” Harry murmured. He sat up slowly, eyes drooping as he did so. “Dress me.” He requested, raising his arms toward his husband like a toddler.
“You’re welcome, Harry.” He kissed
Harry nodded weakly.
Harry did as he was told and pulled the digits into his mouth, thoroughly wetting them with his saliva. When then were sufficiently coated, Draco pulled them back and started to circle the tight entrance awaiting him.
“What do you think?” The redhead
“The train ride is going to go by so quickly this time.” Harry said sadly as they were pulled toward Hogsmeade.
“I’m sorry, Harry, but you thought Weasel was your friend too.” He said caringly.
“-lo? H-ry?” Harry couldn’t quite understand his husband, but he didn’t need to. He just needed Draco to hear him.
“It’s ok.” Harry mumbled and buried his face in his knees.
When he came back to earth Harry realized Draco was no longer on his lap and he had maneuvered them into a spooning position. It took him a moment to notice that he was being spoken to.
“Sweet Merlin.” The older man declared as he finally sank into a chair, pale-faced. “I’ve never heard such an awful thing and I…” He trailed off when Draco gave him a pointed look.
“What the fucking hell, Potter?” Draco screeched in mortification.
“What’s wrong, Olivia?” The man rhetorically asked of the small child. He picked her up and his nose was immediately assaulted by an awful stench. “Ah, I see.”
“Well I think you just did. But you can ask me another question if you’d like.” Draco replied with mock arrogance.
“I see. Could you tell me why he’s the one trying to carry this time?” She asked quietly so as not to disturb the sleeping man.
“Good, because I’d like to do it again.” The blonde said just as quietly. “Ok?”
Once he’d managed to pull himself together, Draco backed away from the slightly worried man and wiped his face of the drying tears.
Emma gave Harry a brief rundown of that evening’s events.
“Love you too.” He replied with his own smile. Hearing this, Draco had a sudden longing to hear those words, in that voice aimed at himself.
said as he looked his oldest child over.
the red hair.
Once they were snuggled up under the blankets, Draco took a deep breath to calm his nerves for what he was about to say.
Harry scrunched up his face in mock concentration. “I think… you lazed around and drank cocktails by the pool.” He replied with a laugh.
“Selling myself? Working the street? Pulling tricks?”
“You can’t possibly be okay with this, Harry.” Draco finally stated.
Upstairs, Harry found Lily and Emma sitting in the same bed looking at a puzzle book. “Did you girls brush your teeth?” Their raven haired father asked. The pair nodded in unison and flashed their pearly whites. “Good job. I’ll be back up at 9:00. You can stay up until then. And just in case you’re already asleep when I come back…” Harry made his way to the bedside and gave both of his girls a goodnight kiss. “…I love you both very much.”
The contraction passed and Scorpius relaxed again. “You’re here now though.”
“Do you ever wear any undergarments?” He panted as he mouthed her neck and squeezed her arse.  Draco briefly wondered if she would ever let him go there but dropped the thought since he knew it definitely wouldn’t be happening this time.
“Fuck, Harry. Did he do it again?” Draco asked as he knelt down next to him. Harry buried his head in Draco's chest and nodded.
“Hey, Draco. Nice seeing you.” A passing Slytherin said. “Harry.” He added amicably.
dropped to his knees before pulling the door closed behind him. “What
“I’m a procrastinator?” Draco tried sheepishly.
“Where ya off ter? Hogsmeade?” He asked cheerfully. The boy nodded and tried to move around his large friend. “Why don’ I join ya?” He said as Harry finally managed to make it out the door.
This time Draco was forced to wait behind a curtain for Harry's privacy. Although he just knew that Harry would have preferred him to be next to him seeing as Draco was the first person to help him.
“As long as you’re not Ron, I don’t mind.” Harry said with a coy smile. “Besides, it’s your bed.”
“How are you feeling?” Dumbledore asked.
Harry trepidatiously took the hand Draco extended to him and carefully pulled himself off the floor. He could feel most of his body protest against the movement. As the dark haired boy started moving forward, the hand still holding his tighten and stopped him.
“Of course.” Harry leapt up from his seat and headed toward a different door than the one they came in through. “I’ll get the first-aid kit and then see if I can find some clothes you can wear. But you’re like a foot taller than me, so I don’t know.”
“I don’t have to. He’ll find me.” Sure enough, the sound of tiny feet running across the floor above them was soon heard. “It’s nothing too bad though. He has nightmares about being taken away from his parents.” It didn’t take long for the footsteps to reach the stairs where they were muffled by carpet.
was hit in the face with a jet of light and lost consciousness.
Sirius and Remus watched as Harry then took Draco by the hand, pulled him to the bed, and pushed him down on it before sitting himself and snuggling into the blonde’s side.
Just a couple of minutes later and Draco deemed his partner ready. He moved up the tan body below him and kissed him with bruising force.
“Friend of yours?” Eric asked upon entering Harry’s bedroom.
“Hey, now. What’s wrong?” Harry asked the troubled teen.
Harry poured himself a cup of tea and took a sip to give his hands something to do. “What do you want to know?” He asked as he did so.
“Never?”
Harry moaned into the redhead’s
“I been meanin’ ter make a trip there meself.” He said, quickly catching up with Harry. It seemed he thought Ron would spring up from behind a tree and try to hex him.
“Why’d she ask so much that didn’t get used in the article though?” The dark-haired boy asked, taking a sip of orange juice.
Draco turned to look at him and replied, “To catch up on homework.”
Turning his head toward them, Harry stuck out his tongue and, with a big grin, said, “You’re all just jealous.”
Immediately, Draco's muscled clamped around Harry almost painfully and pulled him into the strongest orgasm he’d ever experienced. For a moment it was as if he didn’t even exist anymore.
The pair acquiesced but just as the flash went off; Draco tilted his head slightly and planted a soft kiss on Harry’s temple, maintaining eye contact with the camera. Just a little extra way of saying: He belongs to me.
“Well what’s gotten into you?” She asked happily. “I haven’t seen you this happy in a long time.”
Harry was sitting in the entrance hall on top of his trunk, waiting for the carriages with a few other students. Most of them were already outside, but some of them stayed inside to get out of the hot son.
Taking his hand, Harry softly explained, “I went home while you were in surgery and took them to Ron and Hermione’s.” He thought for a moment then added, “I know it’s only five in the morning but I can go get them if you want.”
and clasped his hands behind the blonde’s back.
“Absolutely not!” Three oldest men in the room answered simultaneously.
Harry didn’t respond to that. The two of them sat in silence for a few minutes as Draco tried to come up with something to say that wouldn’t piss the other off.
book?” He asked as he held it up, smirk still in place.
“And baby.” Harry added with a small smile and looked down at his stomach.
“Are you going to tell her about the other thing? Or do you want me to?” He gently asked the younger boy.
Anger dripping from his voice, Eric said, “I can and I’m going to. I paid for him.”
each leg.
someday.”
Madam Pomfrey immediately got up off the floor and conjured a stretcher to put Harry on. “Mr. Malfoy, help me get him on here. We need to get him to the infirmary right now.” She said quickly.
“How did Mrs. Weasley put up with this six times?!” Harry exclaimed when he was finished in the bathroom. “I’m only two months into my pregnancy and it’s already driving me crazy!”
It was silent for a few moments as Harry looked over the piece of paper in his hand.
Tentatively and awkwardly, Draco wrapped Harry in an embrace, lowered them both to the floor, and allowed him to cry.
“One’s from Fred and George and the other’s from your mum.” Harry said, mostly directed at Ginny. He tore open the one from the twins as Draco sat back down on the bed. He read it to himself and then aloud:
“I don’t know!” The red-head shouted back.
“What is going on? Why does he do that every time I mention Ron?” Hermione asked, getting angry about not knowing what Draco evidently did.
left the room and came back with a set of robes in hand. “Try these on in the
“Are they too big?”
“Shouldn’t have told me? I think I would’ve noticed on my own eventually, love.”
It took a minute, but eventually, Tonks had ten feet of hair sprouting from her head, half of which was pooled on the floor.
The young Malfoy frowned at his boyfriend of nearly twelve hours. He didn’t have a clue what he was supposed to do now. He’d never seen anyone so depressed. For now all he could really do was be there for Harry and hope it was enough.
Harry flopped onto his back on the bed he was sitting on, arms spread out and his head hanging off the other side. “Mother fucker.” He repeated.
“Not very reassuring.” The twins deadpanned even though they calmed down anyway and sat back down on their couch. Tom just shrugged.
After thinking it over, Harry finally decides. “Alright, I’ll do both tests. What do I do?”
Draco was the next to find his familiar. He led Aidan to a cage a little farther back inside the cats section.
“It was Harry Potter’s owl and it had a note.” He said handing the bloodstained note to Voldemort, who read it then handed it over to his father.
“And what, young Malfoy, was so important that you had to interrupt my meeting with your father?” the Dark Lord said softly also looking slightly irritated by having his meeting interrupted. Draco was glad that the snakelike body that the Dark Lord had gotten in the ritual after the Triwizard tournament had been temporary and he had regained his human looks. Malfoys do not bow to half snake creatures.
Mariela Chrysanthemum Evans (pureblood-deceased)
Tom Marvalo Riddle (pureblood)
Bursting into the room, he had two wands instantly drawn at him and he paused in order to catch his breath.
Adopted Mother’s Name
“Harry the article said you were blind. Is this true?” the twin on the left side of the couch asked.
By: Rita Skeeter
“I think that Potter must be very desperate to contact his rival. Lucius, take young Malfoy here and Snape and go check it out. Don’t tell Snape where you’re going until you get there but make sure that he brings healing potions. Be careful not to get caught by the insufferable order.” Voldemort ordered.
“Yeah who didn’t know about them? They were brutally attacked and the Light assumed it was me eve thought the Dark Mark wasn’t cast. The Dark knew it wasn’t me and it wasn’t any of my rogue Death Eaters. Are you saying that was Harry?” Tom asked when it clicked.
“That ferret! Why is he still with the Boy-Who-Lived?” That was the youngest Weasley boy.
“This,” he says with a smirk, “is my father.”
“What do you think my lord?” Lucius asked after reading the note.
“Calm down and take a breath.” Draco did as asked. “Now, what is the issue?”
“WHAT ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE CONTRACT?!!!” was heard over all the shouting.
Draco started to choke on the tea he was drinking.
After putting on the outfit that the house elf had set out for him, he opened his bedroom door and nearly ran into Draco.
Harry had had enough of his relatives for the day. From the moment he got back, he had been worked to the bone. He was also being starved and beaten again. He decided to go to the park to get away for a little bit. While he was sitting in the park, in a secluded area that most people didn’t know about, an owl flew up to him. He saw that it had the Gringotts seal on it. He opened it up and it said:
RS: But he must still be guilty of killing off Peter Pettigrew then.
“What’s wrong?” Aidan asked walking into the dining room and feeling the heavy atmosphere that the adults had.
Flashback
Checking through the rooms, they found all of them to be empty, except for the last room which they saw had locks running up and down the door with a cat flap at the bottom of it. They all looked at each other confused, what could be so dangerous that it had to be locked up from the outside? This time it was Snape that unlocked the door. The sight they saw right inside the door was one of the worst things the hardened Death Eaters had ever seen, worse than some of the raids they had been forced to go on when the Dark Lord was at his most insane.
“Let him in please.” Harry said not bothering to move his head towards the goblin.
Harry just shook his head looking grim.
“Where is Rita Skeeter?!” was heard throughout the Daily Prophet office. When the workers turned to see who was causing the ruckus, all protests ended when seeing that the instigators were the Boy-Who-Lived and Draco Malfoy.
“Didn’t Dumbledore tell his loyal chickens? Vernon,” Here Harry spat the name with enough hatred to make everyone in attendance flinch, “this summer, after begging Dumbledore not to put me back there and being shot down once again, I told myself that I would fight back. Well, Vernon didn’t take well to that. He beat me black and blue and I almost died. Thankfully my dear friend Hedwig managed to get me paper and a quill and I was able to write a distress note, in my blood. Hedwig sent it off to Draco, who saved my life. Without him I would be dead instead of just blind.”

Charlie was shocked to say the least. He couldn’t believe that his mother could be so conceited. In all the times that he had met Harry, never once had he thought that Harry would be evil. And if Fred and George had wiped their hands of their mother, then there must have been a very good explanation. With that thought in mind, Charlie picked up Fred and George’s letter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course. Did you get Fred and George’s letter as well?” Bill answered also lowering his wand.
“Oh, I did tell people. Dumbledore knew, all of the Weasleys knew, Granger knew as well. The only people who tried to do something about it are the twins and they are just like me. Now can someone please explain to me why there are bandages on my eyes when; one there are no bandages on me anywhere else, and two there is no pain or cuts on my eyes as far as I can feel.” He says getting fed up of having the bandages around his head and not being able to see the people he was talking to.
When Draco finally stopped covering his face in kisses, Aidan put the ring on Draco’s finger and smiled.
“Ah, ah, ah.” Narcissa taunted waving it out of reach. “You can wait to find out who the marriage contract is. When Draco comes home with Harry and the Dark Lord, then I’ll tell you all who else is on the marriage contract.
Now I’m not one to start major rumours, but there was a certain blonde head whose face brightened quite a bit at that news.
“Maybe, but we have to check it out anyways.” His father said looking at the pictures on the mantel. “Look at this, he’s not in a single portrait or picture here.”
“Thanks Tom. From what Draco read to me, it sounds like she really went to town with it.” He says with a smirk remembering the blush he could hear in Draco’s voice when Draco had gotten to the part that insinuated they were in love. “Draco told me that we were going to be leaving in about ten minutes. Lucius scouted Gringotts earlier and there is a line of well-wishers there to ‘give their support’ to me.”
“Well, we’ve had a long and stressful day. I think it’s time for bed. Anything else that needs to be discussed can wait until the morning.” Lucius announced after he managed to calm himself down.
When they had finished the goblin greeting, Harry took Draco’s hand and let him and Tom lead him out of the bank.
“Of course.” The twins say at once leading them towards their shop.
Speaking of Sirius, how was he able to change the will? He shouldn’t have been able to fight off the compulsion spell that made him give most of the Black money to Dumbledore.
“Okay. I’m ready to go whenever.” Potter says wobbling a little as he stands up, trying to regain his center of balance. Draco, seeing he was about to fall onto the bed post, rushed forward to help steady him. He held Potter’s hand as he led him out of the Manor Infirmary. Potter’s hand felt very warm and soft in his.
“Malfoy?” Harry said hesitantly, hoping he had identified the voice correctly. “Hedwig delivered my note to you?”
“I want no one else but you to be by my side for the rest of my life and I want to shout it from the mountain tops. I know that we have already signed the betrothal contract, but I want no one to doubt my love for you. So I am asking you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, my Dragon, the love of my life, and holder of my heart and soul. Will you do me the honour of becoming my fiancé?” Aidan asked as he pulled out the small box and opened it, showing him the ring that he had made.
“He lives here?” he said confused. “Weren’t we told he was pampered?”
Aidan and Draco walked down the hallway together, looking immensely powerful together as they made it to Rita’s office. When there, they opened the door and were heard saying “How would you like the story of a life time?” before the closed and no one heard anything.
“Your new husband is...” the tension in the room was so thick that you could cut it with a knife. Draco and Aidan were both holding their breath in anticipation for what Narcissa was going to say next.
Sighing, he sent the Order home and decided to wait for Harry to get out so that he could talk to him.
“As long as you continue to be my King, we shall have no problems,” Aidan added wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist.
“Harry, wait a second. You don’t have to do this.” Dumbledore said trying to appeal to him. “I took good care of your accounts and it is a big responsibility for one so young. Let me control your accounts until you are ready.” As he said this Harry could feel the compulsion charm try to latch on. He had never been so thankful for the bracelet Tom had given him except for that moment.
To Dumbledore, I only leave to you the knowledge that I have a letter for Harry to read in my vault that explains all the manipulations that you have subjected him to as well as all the money taken out of his vaults as well as the knowledge that when the new Lord Black is given the Lord ring, Grimmauld Place is forever barred from the Order of the Phoenix. Even if you somehow coerce the new Lord Black to let you use it only those that follow him fully and do not manipulate him, are allowed in there thanks to a handy ward that I got from the Blacks. I also tell you, you can kiss my cold dead ass.
One of the twins cuts her off there. “You guys never listen to us! We did. Not. Do. This! I swear you haven’t heard a word we said since we could start talking!” Fred or George said angrily.
“Well?” Hermione says getting impatient, “was she right?”
Hello everyone! I'm just letting you know that the first chapter is up for my rewrite of Enough is Enough. I've been asked quite a bit and I just wanted everyone to know that I will not be deleting my original story. It'll stay up along with the new one. I hope everyone has a great day and loves the changes to the story!
“Of course I can! I’m your mother!” Molly says a little uncertainly. “You’re Fred!” she says pointing to the twin on the left.
“Let’s check upstairs for Potter before the Order comes.” Draco suggested already heading towards the stairs.
Harry blushed. “I just haven’t found an opportunity. When we met I was passed out, then I found out I was blind, there was about a day of an adjustment, then we had an interview with Rita, then there was the will reading, after that was the inheritance testing and claiming of all my lordships, and right after that we ran into you. I was planning on telling Dad and Draco at least today though.”
“I think I know the best way to inform Bumblebee about my blindness. We can post it in the Daily Prophet. Just imagine the headline, Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived hurt so bad by relatives that he is blinded for life. The public outcry would be huge. We should probably do it before I have to go to Sirius’ will reading.” Harry says looking in, hopefully, Tom’s direction. “Draco can take me to the reading as it will create the least amount of drama.”
When they got to the house, his father unlocked the door and they all went in. Nothing appeared to be wrong, but something felt off.
“Why didn’t you tell anyone about the abuse, brat?” someone who sounded like Snape snapped.
Magical Inheritance
/I don’t have a name. I would love for you to think of a name for me. I am female./
“And I too vow to show you the love and affection YOU deserve as well.” Draco said still on Aidan’s lap with his face as close as possible to Aidan’s without kissing.
Dumbledore had been sitting in his office when one of his silver doohickeys (AN: I don’t know what they’re called so this is what I’m calling it. If you know what they are, put it in a review and I’ll change it.) started to go off. It was followed by two more. They all had one thing in common; they were all tied to one Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived. The first one told Dumbledore that Harry was dying. The second told him that Death Eaters had breached the wards, and the last said that the blood wards had failed. Then, all of a sudden, they all went silent. The only thing that could make the third one stop was if Harry was either dead or no longer considered #4 his home. And the latter wasn’t possible because of all the compulsion spells and loyalty potions, not to mention the personality-changing potion he had made Harry ingest to keep him compliant.
Oh my god! I can’t believe Siri did this!! I can’t believe he knew!! What if Draco hates me for making him marry me? What if he doesn’t want to marry me? I’m so worried!! Were the thoughts going through Aidan’s head as he stood with a frozen expression on his face.
“Bill?” Charlie yelled coming through the floo. The redhead hoped that he could reach his brother before the letter did.
“Well, Draco and I need to go. I’d advise you two to go get an inheritance check from Gringotts.” Aidan said with a smile while also holding out a hand for Draco to take in order to lead him into Knocturn Alley. “Dumbledore had his hands in everything and might have blocked or taken something from you guys as well.”
Tom opened his drawer and pulled out-
“Harry! Harry calm down!” a familiar voice said to him from somewhere. “Calm down Harry, you’re safe. Calm down!” Now he remembered.
Harry was humming a cute lullaby while stroking Draco’s hair as he lightly dozed with his head in Harry’s lap when the first explosion jolted them out of their content little bubble.
“Potter probably made the whole thing up. He is a spoiled brat.” Professor Snape sneered.
Dumbledore watched the mysterious man disappear down the hallway and frowned. He needed to know who the man was so that he could find that man again. If he could find that man again, he could convince the man to tell him exactly what went on during the meeting. If Dumbledore could figure out how much Harry knew then when he did damage control, it would be a lot easier.
“You are not a fail of a mother. Fred and George were always the black sheep of the family. Harry has turned them Dark. Trust Albus Dumbledore, he has never failed you and will never fail you. Harry is slowly turning Dark, the Malfoys are corrupting him. Sirius Black was also tainted by the Dark.”
“Nothing is wrong with your mother, Draco. She’s just overly happy.”
In front of Grimmauld Place there were all the Order members in various stages of undress.
AN: Updated 2-15-15
“Of course. The Wackspurts wish you a happy marriage and the Flutterby’s tell you that he’ll love it.”
RS: What disability is this? Why are you hiding out from the Order? Why are you so friendly with Draco Malfoy? What muggles are Draco talking about?
“Who is this person?” Aidan said with no emotion in his voice. Inside he was so angry that his magic was close to bursting out of him. Once he got a name, he was going to hunt them down and destroy them for thinking that they could touch what belonged to him. Being blind, he missed the appraising look Tom gave him at his ability to hide and mask his emotions.
That comment stopped everything. Tom was jolted out of his thoughts and Aidan’s face went completely blank. There was no emotion seen on his face or in his eyes. Draco’s reaction was the worst. His face went extremely pale, paler than normal. He almost looked like he was going to pass out.
After Aidan got everyone’s attention, he turned towards Draco and began.
Bloodhook didn’t say anything for a minute just processing what was said before he started to speak rapidly in Gobbledygook.
Lucius was impressed. Not only at the insults spewed by Aidan towards Dumbledore, but also at the amount of magic that could be seen swirling around him. Lucius felt more confident in leaving his only son in Aidan’s hands. Lucius was not a fool. Sometimes oblivious about his son but not a fool. He realized that his son was submissive, and needed someone to take care of him. Hopefully Aidan would be that person.
“Of course. I, Fred Weasley-”
Before he had to answer, the goblin came back.
“Bill and I are in agreement. If Dumbledore or Molly ever tries to charm us again, spells are going to go flying.” Charlie said with a wry grin.
“The seat a few steps in front of you is yours. Young Draco here is to your right, I am to your left. Lucius Malfoy is right in front of you and Narcissa is diagonally to your right.”
“Do we? You are talking to Harry and Sirius’s prized pupils! Of course we have other talents.”
Draco was in awe. He couldn’t believe that this man, this extremely strong, extremely good looking man, was into him. The magic swirling around him was only a testament to that power. As more and more things were picked up and were added to the mass chaos of glass already swirling around the room, Draco realized that someone would have to calm Aidan down. Slowly Draco stood up from his seat and moved towards his boyfriend.
“First up, the Slytherin heir rings.” It said handing Harry the ring and telling him to put it on his left pointer finger.
Draco could see Tom’s eye twitch but couldn’t resist a giggle. “Right.” He says trying to get back on topic. “Well let me just read you the inheritance out loud and then the questions can be asked;
His mother gave her nod in agreement with a knowing look on her face.
“She actually should have been asking your permission to make any changes to the Longbottom vaults when you turned eleven. Since by your expression I’m guessing she didn’t we shall audit all of the Longbottom vaults to makes sure funds were going to where they were supposed to. We wish for you to go through an inheritance ritual to make sure that nothing else is glaringly wrong.”
“What are we doing here Lucius?” Snape impatiently asked, waiting for a reason to why he had to leave his last potion just to come here to this quiet neighborhood.
Tom paced outside of the ritual room worried as he could hear the screams coming from inside. Draco stood against the wall trying not to show any of the worry that was clear in the way he was leaning against the wall, tensing up at each scream.
RS: Well, what do you plan to do this year for school? You will be separated due to your different houses.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The same with you.” Harry says with a smile, “We live together, fight together, and die together.”
“I think that Aidan will finally have the family he deserved. Although you have to admit, when Aidan thinks he won’t be caught, he can be as cruel if not crueler than the Dark Lord. How anyone could think he was Light, I’ll never understand. His magic is as dark as could be.”
“Harry!!!” was the only thing he heard before he was practically tackled in the middle of the street.
Draco was outside in the gardens when he heard a hoot. He looked up and saw a white owl with red splotches. As it came closer he could see that the red splotches were actually blood. It landed right in front of him and he realized it was Potter’s owl, Hedwig, or something like that. She hooted again and he finally saw the note in her claws. Wondering why Potter had written to him, he picked up the note. The first thing he realized was that it also had blood on it. Horrified, he read the note. After he finished, he carefully picked up Potter’s owl and ran inside to find his father. Calling a house elf, he asked where his father was and heard that he was in a meeting with the Dark Lord. He told the house elf to take Potter’s elf to the Owlry and take care of her. Deciding that this was more important than anything they were talking about, he burst into the office.
“Maybe, but we still have to check it out anyways.” Lucius said creeping into the living room and looking at the pictures on the mantel. “Look at this. He’s not in a single picture that’s on this mantel.”

The man sat beside him on the bed and asked, “What’s wrong, love?” Harry

Harry sniffled and replied, “I was just thinking how badly I wanted you here holding my hand.”
“Uh, yeah… that.” The brunette replied sheepishly.

“I thought we could take a nice, hot bath together.” Draco explained as he started turning on the taps.
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Harry
“For almost 16 years now.” The blonde man answered.
Together, both males reached into their robes to pull a ring out of an inner pocket. Harry’s hand grazed the contract as he did so. He always kept his copy on him, just so he could check and see if it was destructible yet.
Draco took a seat on the edge of the bed while the other two men occupied the two available chairs. “They’re asleep in the waiting room. Mum is with them.” He replied.
“Do you have any other surprises for me?” She asked.
“Ginny?” The classroom was dark when he walked in. Harry was about to cast
After turning off the vehicle,
At the door, Sirius pinned the taller man against the wooden surface. They shared a deep kiss before making their way inside.
One door over, the brunette could
“Draco, hush.” Harry admonished, but he copied his husband’s movements on the other side of their son’s head, catching sight of a second earring there. “What were you thinking?”
“You seem to be doing well, as well as can be expected anyways.” Madam Pomfrey said as she finished checking him.
“Yes, it is my business. It’s been my business since I found Harry crying and bleeding in the middle of the night three months ago. Why do you think he’s been happy even though you keep abusing him?” Draco asked as he tightened his hold.
Then he put it back in his robe and said, “That is entirely up to you Harry. Ms. Haysley has agreed to clear her Wednesday evenings so she can focus on helping you recover. However, I think there should be a minimum of one hour.”
“Harry?” He called as he stepped into the room. The blonde immediately noticed his husband’s naked form on the bed and was both surprised and confused he hadn’t received a response. His heart jumped into his throat as the worst possibilities raced through his mind.
Once he was fully sheathed, Harry sat back up and positioned a pale leg over his shoulder. Draco automatically pulled the other one up to his chest and waited for the onslaught of pleasure to begin.
Harry smiled a bit at the thought of his blonde lover. He forgot though, Hermione and Ron didn’t know about his relationship with Draco either. Neither of them had thought their friends would take it well and they had agreed to keep it a secret for a while.
Harry disengaged from the stirrups and sat up. “Are we done?” He asked as he pulled his sweatpants back on.
Ethan reached Scorpius’ bedside and took a hold of his hand. “Of course I’d be here. I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”
he pulled out his wand and cast
Suddenly a vivid image of a small, blonde boy floated into Harry’s mind and he jerked awake.
“Stop.” Harry whimpered when the hand sped up and he began panting. “I said stop!” He stated more forcefully. Eric gradually slowed his hand down before pulling it away with a frown.
Draco’s confusion rose. Harry rarely called him Malfoy and the few times he did, had only been during incredibly bad fights. He could probably count the number of times Harry had called him that since their wedding on one hand.
“Hello, Eric.” Harry quietly replied, still staring out the window at the sunset orange sky.
Draco’s heart sank into his stomach as his son spoke the words he had secretly been terrified of hearing one day. He knew Weasley was out of Azkaban, but he never truly expected the redhead to try something against them. The man then stepped back to the podium and quickly announced his departure to the room.
of you for being pregnant at seventeen.” He replied.
Draco went from a happy grin to guilt-ridden worry. “Love, what’s wrong?” He asked as Harry’s shoulders began to shake.
Taking the hint, Scorpius wrapped his hand around the other’s cock and pumped it a few times to spread the lube.
“Really? Because James would have just accepted that he was cute instead of whining and insisting he was a handsome young man.” Harry countered. “And which one of you is always pulling pranks on us?”
waiting for an answer though, he reached for the doorknob.
is why the Weasley boy was thrown in Azkaban?” Came Lucius’ incredulous question.
“By me,” Sirius added. “I misinterpreted a situation, thought he was hurting my god son, so I attacked him.”
“Ok.” Harry said quietly.
The pair fell silent as Draco finally extracted himself from the bed and began to redress himself. Harry joined him in his task.
doing this.”
“I think that Papa is very cute.” He said, cracking a huge smile.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut to block out the unwanted spectators and gritted his teeth against the rest of the pain. The only thing he wanted at that moment was for Draco to be next to him, holding his hand and telling him it would be ok.
Harry stared at his husband in shock. “Y-you did that for me?”
Sirius let go of him but didn’t back away. He looked back over his shoulder to see Harry getting out of bed. “Harry, lay back down.” He said softly.
“Ya think?” Harry snapped,
The blonde woman sat up a little straighter before pulling another item out of her bag. It was a small hand mirror.
“Then why are you angry at our son who needs our love and support right now?” Harry shouted with his hands balled into fists at his sides.
“First we’d like to ask you two a question.” Draco started after letting the boys, mostly Scorpius, squirm for a few more seconds. They both turned their attention to their blonde father.
“I-I felt him move.”
When he was done eating, the medi-witch cleared the tray and left with it and the one from breakfast.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked cautiously. He didn’t want Harry to regret the decision later.
“Harry, Harry, wake up.” He said quietly and gently shook his shoulder.
? As in, the son of business tycoon and multi-millionaire, Lucius Malfoy?” Harry asked incredulously.
“No.”
Draco thought for moment about how best to answer the question. “Would you believe me if I said yes?”
Hearing his name, Draco groaned loudly and tightened the hand around Harry, stroking faster. He started kissing his way across Harry's neck when the raven tilted his head back some to look at him.
Feeling much more like himself now, Draco checked to make sure Scorpius was still asleep before making his way to Harry's bedroom. He knocked a few times and opened the door when he received no answer.
“Have you ever hit him for no reason?” Professor Snape asked before Professor Dumbledore could speak again.
the library. But that didn’t mean anyone had to know about it.
“Can I come in, Harry?” A slightly tired Emma Haysley asked. The dark-haired man didn’t react. “I’ll take that as a yes.” She said softly to herself, closing the door behind her.
The distraught man sobbed in relief and bent to get closer to the phone.
“Can… can I see him?”
“You… sure?” Ethan panted between thrusts.
Draco followed Harry in and shut the door behind them. The latter sat on the edge of the teen’s bed while the former chose to stand.
The moment Draco signed his name; the parchment folded itself up and took off. He watched it zoom around the room before it flew out an open window.
With a groan, Harry replied, “Fuck yes.”
“Don’t you know what today is?” The blonde asked as he shook Harry's shoulder.
with a scowl.
By the time Harry had calmed himself down, he felt a frustrated scream bubble its way out of his throat as he felt the beginnings of another one. This time, he tried to remember his breathing and congratulated himself when he didn’t go into a panic again.
Said blonde whined and wrapped his arms under Harry to hold him in place. “Let’s skip.” He suggested as he cuddled more into the warm body beneath him.
This story currently has 4 chapters. I have yet to decide if I'll be adding more to it. I do have a couple pages of a prequel chapter written so we'll see.
He let go of one of her hips, unfortunately forcing the pace to slow, and brought his thumb down to rub her clit. “Come.” He ordered. “Now!”
The four Gryffindor boys chatted amiably as the carriage lurched toward the castle. Draco just sat back watching his lover with a happy grin.
The dark-haired man gave each child a final kiss before heading out of the room and gesturing for his husband to follow him. “Talk about what?” He asked as the pair made their way toward the living room.
Fed up with his release being denied, Draco slid his free hand between their bodies and took matters into his own hands, stroking his own cock expertly. “Please… I… I need to come so bad.” He begged as his hand sped up, twisting at the head just the way he liked it.
Draco licked his way up the side of Harry’s neck. “We can’t have sex. I don’t recall anything about not being able to blow you.” He said as he slid beneath the blanket and coaxed Harry onto his back.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry started. “Are you feeling okay?”
“What it is?” Harry asked as he
around Harry's shoulders, and pulled him in for a quick kiss. “Very.” He stated
This continued for a while. Draco would lift up higher and drop back down a little harder and a little faster and each time Harry would let out a near scream as his hips tried to thrust up.

“Well then, to be my dates, you’ll
“Yeah. Mum, this is Ha—”
Harlot smirked and grabbed the back of his head. “You have no idea.” She then pulled him back down into another steamy kiss. Their mouths and hands continued to explore each other as clothing was torn away.
“Relax, Harry,” Draco soothed, leaving a few soft kisses on the brunette’s inner thigh.
“I’m tired and sore.” Harry replied groggily.
As he crossed his arms, Harry snorted, “That’s easy for you to say. You get to go home to people who love you. Why do I have to go back there anyway? Voldemort’s been gone for two years now.”
“I don’t mean to interrupt…” Healer Carter started, “But we do need to take care of the afterbirth.”
into his seat. “Harry.” He said a little louder and shook him a little harder.
“Stay here. I’ll go find a couple of carts.” Draco said once they were off the train and out of the way. With a quick peck to Harry's cheek, he was off.
After giving Harry a few minutes to adjust, Draco pulled back halfway before sliding forward again. He continued in this matter, slowly moving farther out as he went.
As he contemplated his current predicament, a familiar cramping sensation hit his lower abdomen like a wave and he froze in panic.
“Why does it matter?” He asked.
Barely having to lift his head, Harry pressed his lips to the blonde’s. It started as just a light touch of lips and then Draco's tongue slipped into the other’s mouth to slowly slide along Harry's.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!” Was Harry’s muffled response. He pulled harder at the ropes binding his wrists. “I’m not doing this again!” He mumbled.
Carefully, Draco pried Harry's arms away from his midsection and kissed the skin below his navel. “You’re not fat, Harry.” He sighed. “I would have a problem if you
“Are you sure?” Draco asked him with concern clear in his voice.
After checking for any wards that might go off, Lucius unlocked the door and they entered with their wands up, ready for anything that might come out at them. After taking a glance around, nothing looked out of the ordinary, it looked like a simple muggle home.
Molly gave a little gasp and looked uncertainly at the two of them.
“Now that we’re in private, what was it that you wanted me to sign again?” Harry said while being guided to a seat by Draco.
Now to the really boring stuff and some not so boring stuff.
“And to answer your question, I left the Dursley’s because they blinded me. It was in the papers, yesterday, I believe. If Draco hadn’t gotten my letter and came immediately, I would have died. We’ve been staying at Grimmauld Place.” Harry said looking to the left where he had last heard Dumbledore’s voice.
“Now, Sirius wanted you to be emancipated when he died, so we can do that now. He also wanted you to get an inheritance test as well as a test to see if there is any magic on you that shouldn’t be. That includes blocks, spells, and potions that may influence you in any way shape or form, good and bad.”
“I wanted to ask if I could join you as an equal. You can run it and everything, I will mostly be in the background, but still part of the Dark Order. I just don’t want the Dark Mark.” Harry said as confidently as he could, trying to figure out where Tom was.
The inhale from Rita told Harry that Draco had appeared. A hand touched his right shoulder to tell him where Draco was sitting.
“Yay!” The outburst startled the couple into remembering that there were other people in the room. The newly engaged couple jerked their heads away from each other and looked at the other occupants in the room.

(Readers, after that, I saw Draco Malfoy in a new light. He wasn’t just the spoiled prince we all though he was. He had a heart and he used it to help out our saviour.)
There was no rustling of cloaks so everyone there was supposed to be there.
“Lucius, I need you to go home and tell Narcissa to prepare a room and have numerous potions ready to go.” Snape says as he pulled out his wand and started casting spell after spell. His father apparated away without another word. “Draco help me support his head while I pour a Blood Replenishing Potion down his throat. It should help stabilize him.”
“Potter?” someone familiar said.
She seemed to be weighing the pros and cons to agreeing to this, “If I agree to this, exactly what light did you want me to put on this?”
“Oh, Harry you know this person extremely well.” Now everyone but Draco and Aidan knew that something special was going on with this marriage contract.
“Whoa. I didn’t think it was possible, but you actually look hotter Harry.” Fred said jokingly.
“H-Potter.” The person nearby said, the voice extremely familiar to him.
“That’s a Cù-Sith. I wonder how the owner of this shop found one. They usually stay with the fairies.” Draco said, his voice sounding shocked.
“Okay. As I was saying earlier, James and Lily aren’t my parents. My parents are actually the Dark Lord and Mariela Evans. I was taken from my parents by Dumbledore during a raid on one of the dark houses. He killed my mother and led my dad to assume that I had also died. I don’t know if James and Lily were in on it, but I do know they adopted me. I found out about my being adopted because of an inheritance test. Draco called the Dark Lord and he accepted me as his son. He’s also here right now.” Harry finished with a smirk on his face.

Glaring from the direction Dumbledore’s voice came from, “Yeah, that’s why I got a letter before I left the Dursley’s stating that you, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Mr. Weasley have been stealing from me. I would also appreciate it if you would refrain from trying to put compulsion charms on me.” He said with a tone so cold everyone could feel a shiver rundown their back, but for different reasons. For Draco, it was with lust, but for everyone else it was fear.
“No.” The twin on the right said with angry fire in his eyes. “You got us messed up again! You call yourself our mother and you can’t even tell us apart! We’re tired of you doing this to us! Both you, dad, and the family have done it since we can remember. The only one in the family who hasn’t done that is Bill and the only one outside of the family who has ever gotten us right is Harry. From now on we refuse to acknowledge any of you as part of our family ever again!” they finish together before they Apparate away leaving a stunned silence behind.
“So what are we supposed to do?” Bill asked with a sigh as he sat down on the opposite couch.
“Oh! I-I-I-I was just about to come in there and get you.” Draco stuttered, his voice conveying the shyness he probably felt at that moment. “You were taking a while and we need to go down for breakfast soon and we also need to about all that is involved with the engagement and-”
“Sure.” Draco says with what sounds like a smile on his lips.
“Do you know how long this abuse has been going on?” the Dark Lord asked, his face clouding over with anger at the thought of any child getting abused, especially one this famous. Children were considered sacred in the Wizarding World and no proper wizard would ever think of abusing a child.
“Yeah,” I say trying to get up. “Actually….Could you help me find the bathroom? And helpmepickoutanoutfit?” Harry says embarrassed.
“With their magic it’s just the slightest bit different. When I look at people, I see both the strength of their magic as it moves through their bodies and also the colour. Every body’s colour is a little different. Draco’s is silver, Dad’s is a mix between red and hazel. Fred and George’s are both blue but they’re both subtly different. Fred’s is a little bit lighter than George’s. It’s nothing major. I bet that if you paid attention, you could also pick it up.” Harry finished with a shrug.
Harry was astonished. “I-I don’t know what to say. Thanks Tom.”
“I’m sorry father, but I thought this was something that couldn’t wait.” He said trying to catch his breath.
“All you have to do is cut your wrist and put four drops of blood onto this piece of paper.”
“I would wish to know as well.” Harry said with a shrug. “I took an inheritance test and Draco said I couldn’t hear what it said until we had summoned you.”

“There must be some mistake-”
“How could you?!!”
He smiled, knowing that this was just precautionary, they both knew she was going to say yes. “Don’t worry. I won’t make you write a whole paper about how Dumbledore is the best and it was all Voldemort’s fault I’m blinded. This article will cause chaos.” He assured her with a smirk.
“Yeah…..
“Yes, I’m afraid so. I assume that Sirius corrupted him and the Malfoys only added to it. Azkaban probably did quite a lot more damage to Sirius then we thought and he reverted back to the Black family nature. The only thing left is for us to nip it in the bud before he becomes a full-on dark lord.” Albus fake sighed.
“I know, I know, but I just got the best marriage contract ever!!!” she says waving the paper in her hand around. “He won’t be able to refuse this one, you wouldn’t even say know to this.”
Molly was sitting in her room crying and thinking about her decisions. How could she not have known the difference between the twins? She was their mother! That brought out a new round of tears.
“Together forever, Dray. Together forever.” He says as he says the last two words he would ever say.
Hey Bro!
He and Harry had come to a ceasefire which had slowly progressed into a relationship.
“How did you find this?” Lucius asked breathless.
“I’m sorry father, but I just got a note, and I thought that this was something that couldn’t wait.”
“Yes.” Harry said with a sigh, “Those attacks happened because I had reason to assume they were doing some absolutely terrible things. I sadly found out that I were right. They were testing on werewolves. I found them in the process of doing some of their ‘tests’ on children. Their screams haunted me for weeks afterwards. Everything went red and I demolished them for it.”
of his bloodthirsty relatives.
Hey everybody. I'm wondering whether or not to continue this fic. If you guys want me to continue I will but i'm not sure I will continue right now. It's just not as popular as my other fic.
Arthur gasped. “You don’t really think that Harry has gone dark, do you?”
“Who is it?” Draco asked not noticing the smirk on his mother’s face.
“Do you think we can get Rita now to write the story, because the will reading is in two days and I want to get this out with enough time to cause mass chaos?” Harry says changing the subject. Deliberately ignoring Draco’s spluttering, he looked to Tom for an answer.
“You’re going to get married!!”
Tom, never expecting Harry to call him father so soon after learning the truth, calmed down fairly quickly. Most of that though, was do to shock.
He left as soon as the goblin finished speaking.
“If I don’t make it back-” Harry says but is cut off by Draco.
“I asked what you thought about the marriage contract.”
RS: Hello Mr. Potter. Are you the one that had the story of the century for me?
Thank You so much for all the positive comments. I also love the constructive criticism! This made me rejuvenated to continue writing. I didn't know so many people loved this story!
“Now why would he buy a bitch like you an engagement present? He’s not even dating you. He’s dating me.” Draco snarked back, angry that the little chit thought that she could barge into their new relationship. He had just gotten the man of his dreams without having to go against his family or morals, he wasn’t about to lose him to a lying, gold-digging little bitch.
“And if it doesn’t?” Draco asked curiously.
Spells:
“So. What did you need to talk to us about?” Bill said when the twins had finally gotten quiet.
“Yeah. If it hadn’t been brainwashed into me by both Ron and Hagrid that all Slytherins were evil and if you hadn’t dissed the first two friends I’ve ever had; then I would have been in Slytherin.”
“You been”
“Ginevra.” Aidan curtly said with barely a nod in her general direction. The whole mob quiets down to see what would happen between them.
Harry looked up at his father and gasped.
“Oh, Well…” Aidan glanced quickly at Draco who was also waiting for the answer, if not a little anxiously. “I think that I hate… Siri for doing this without my knowledge, but I love him for doing it at the same time. Draco,” He turned towards Draco and took hold of his hands. “I admit that this is happening very quickly, but I will admit now that I have admired you since first year and been in love with you since fourth. I don’t know if you love me as well because, frankly, I was terrible to you for a long time and don’t deserve your love.
“Okay.” Harry said once they stopped walking, making him assume that they had reached the goblin’s office. “What do I have to do in order to claim my inheritance?”
Tom opened his drawer and pulled out-
A little bit later, they got escorted into an office that had a sign saying Bloodhook, Longbottom account manager.

“We’ll be here when it’s over.” Draco said helping to get Tom to leave his son in the hands of the goblins.
“Flickr, where is my father right now?” He asked trying to catch his breath.
“MOM” “CISSA” They shout together turning around before running to their rooms.
After a pause one of them said, “Well? Can you tell us apart?”
“Of course.” Bill replied.
“My father, Severus, both of whom helped to bring you here, my mother, who healed you, the Dark Lord, and I.” Malfoy said, still next to the bed.
“Yes sir.” The goblin said as the door creaked close behind him.
Dumbledore was irritated. It had been over two hours and Harry, Mr. Malfoy, and the mysterious man were still in the bank. What could Sirius have left that was so important that it would take more than two hours? There was no way that Sirius could’ve known about the spells and potions that littered his system. There was also no way for him to be able to break the mind charm that made him believe that Harry was actually Lily and James’.
Understanding dawned on Aidan’s face and he made his excuses before he quickly made his way to his father’s side.
“Okay Hedwig, Take this to someone not associated to Dumbledore.” I say spitting out the last word with as much hate as I could muster at the moment. I hear her chirp an okay and fly away before I succumbed to the darkness.
