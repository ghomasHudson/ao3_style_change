"He's not a Slytherin, he's a capybara" Hermione said, sounding uncomfortably similar to the headmistress. "I don't think you're allowed to do that, Harry."
Harry opened his mouth to give a sharp retort and then realized that would be a terrible idea. Instead, he narrowed his eyes, "You didn't say I had to be good. You said I had to beg," he bit out the last word.
Charlie bites back a groan. “Before that," he replies, voice low and rough. "When I told you to admit what you were fantasizing about when I caught you wanking in my room."
When the Gryffindors got back from Quidditch Blaise was sitting on his bed next to the window. Ernie Macmillan and Terry Boot were in the common room studying with Hannah Abbott so Blaise was alone when Seamus Finnigan came in. As predicted, he was followed closely by Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley.
"You have a beautiful home," Ariel said, wanting so badly to comfort this woman who carried sadness with her like a piece of jewelry she never took off and to distract herself from the growing dread in her stomach.
Narcissa paced the laboratory a thousand times in their absence. Her racing heart bashed against the inside of her chest as her mind circled back to every possible worst-case scenario: What if Lucius gets caught? What if they all get caught? What if she made a critical error and got them all killed? And what fate worse than death would await her and her family should something happen to Ariel? She white-knuckled the neck of an unopened bottle of wine, convinced at any second, death would come for her and everyone she loved.
She turned her head. Young Tom was back in Voldemort's old robes. His face blurred back into Voldemort's then in a flash returned to handsome visage that currently regarded her like she was the most important creature in the universe.
"You always knew I'd be great in whatever I did." He said after a while. She glanced at him. He was wearing an arrogant smile.
"No," Voldemort said, his voice soft with a genuineness that Snape had never heard, or expected from the Dark Lord, before. "No, I meant everything I said in there."
Ariel's eyes couldn't move but if they could they would have bulged and her eyebrows would have furrowed in utter bewilderment. How did this creature know her name?
Ariel kicked him in the shin and for a few horrible seconds, the two of them were glaring at each other. Draco thought the house would explode from their quiet intensity but then Ariel turned her head away and told Draco with a smile, "Thank you for cleaning the house."
"Oh, I know you swear. Because make one mistake—one tiny mistake and…" He chuckled darkly then told a terrified Greyback, "Well, let's just say. If you think I'm scary…wait 'til you meet her."
Narcissa didn't reply. She merely watched the unlikely pair as they continued to talk like old friends while the beginning of the idea formed in the back of her head.
He let out an exasperated sigh. "Trust me, I'm aware." He paused, looking her over. "How does your hand feel?"
The mouse made out a terrible, high-pitched squeak, convulsed twice, then collapsed, dead against the stone-made fireplace.
"I got them," Bellatrix said with cruel pride. "But," her face turned from joking to serious, "she has no ID. And the ridiculous part, My Lord, she didn't even use a wand."
"Kill yourself." Ariel snarled and the wizard's arm reversed away from her and towards himself as they produced the killing curse. The corpse collapsed mere steps from his friend's twitching, bleeding, dying body.
Snape took his potion and watched the midnight saturated window as he transformed into another Ariel.
Her voice was snuffed out like a candle flame. She stood stricken, mouth hanging open uselessly, underneath Voldemort's rueful smile. He laughed in her face. "Catfish got your tongue?"
He felt like fate was rewarding him with fulfilling his destiny by giving him a mom finally. That's he went quiet for a moment. Not because he was embarrassed by her love but because he was imagining himself sitting in a throne of his enemies bones, while thousands bowed before his blood-soaked feet, Potter's head impaled on a pike and a crown-wearing Ariel next to, telling him, lovingly, "I'm so proud of you."
“Tea sounds…” She began, a waft of blood reached her mouth and coated her tongue. She could literally taste the metal in the air. “Lovely.”
Snape kept his head low the entire time but every once and a while he'd steal a sideways glance towards Voldemort and catch him smirking behind Ariel's beautiful hands.
"My Lord," Snape cut pleadingly. "Ariel is the love of my life. I adore that creature. I want to spend the rest of my life earning her love, worshipping her the way she deserves. And should she decide one day that she isn't happy with me anymore and does leave me I'll be grateful to have her in my life as long as I did."
At first, he didn't mind. It was summer anyway when it started. And he enjoyed the long nights alone to enjoy the silence of his house. He found them tranquil. Besides, nobody cared when he slept the mornings away. His mother had too much on her mind anyway. He supposed he'd be a wreck too if the love of his life was wallowing away in a blackhole while she lived with the worry that he'll die before she'll ever see him again. In her defense, she did try to keep a brave face for him while he was home. But that wasn't to say she didn't try to talk to him about what was going on. Though, she couldn't offer him assurances. To her credit, she was never a mother who sugarcoated things for him. She told him things he already knew. Like how they had to be extra careful now. How things were going to be bad, for a while, before they'll ever start to look good.
Her beauty made his stomach stir but her nakedness burned him to the core. He had to keep his eyes on the placid lake or else he would embarrass himself, and her, with an erection even he couldn't control.
Then she looked down and saw a legion of rotted corpses standing upright and staring directly at her.
Bellatrix and Narcissa exchanged befuddled glances before Narcissa said to Ariel, "Have you…used it?"
Ariel scoffed. "You better stick a fresh one in some ice then. Because I'm going to have that guy back home for you in thirty minutes or less."
"These are what muggles use to clean with," Voldemort informed gleefully. "And you, little Draco, are going to use them to clean your godfather's house. From top to bottom."
He stepped aside to open the door with his wand and allow Ariel's first entry. She grinned at him, excitedly, when she passed by.
"That emphatically includes your big sister." He insisted, his voice an angry hiss as he began pacing the room.
"You should see her in combat. I've seen this magnificent beast take down creatures four times her size," said Voldemort as he went to the kitchen.
Ariel let out a panicked yelp then bolted out of her chair, pushing Nagini onto the floor as she darted for the sponge that fell to the floor then hightailed it for the kitchen. "Sponges can't be out of the water that long!"
"Why don't you sell it? We'll split whatever you get." Snape said with a smile. "That way you have money to start your new life and I don't go to Azkaban for possession of and attempting to sell stolen merfolk artifact."
"Tonight, right now." He said wand in hand knees plunged into the mud. He was about to reach into his pocket for his wand when a thought crossed his mind and he stopped himself to unbutton his cloak and laid the cloth down on the wet ground. He gestured for Ariel to lie on it which she did and then he took his wand out and said, "Okay. I must warn you this is going to sting for a bit."
She tore it open hoping to find a letter, but found instead a golden badge with his former name on it, saying for special achievement, and a single photo. An animated drawing of a mermaid doing a swan dive.
Ron sighed, rubbed her back with his hand until she picked herself up, and told Harry, as his arm hooked around her elbow and led her down the road back to Hogwarts, "Love you mate."
Dumbledore waited until he heard the footfalls disappear from the living room to apparate, camouflaging himself to blend into the walls. He pointed his invisible wand at the window, his aim set on the back of Voldemort's head.
"Draco," The Dark Lord's tepid voice called for him when he was halfway up the stairs. Draco looked past the mop and broom his struggled to carry and saw Voldemort's cruel smile. "You forgot your sponge."
When he woke up the world was black and there was something covering his face. He thrashed for his wand then shot upward, pointing his arm straight out at—Ariel.
Ariel didn't say anything right away. Instead, she continued to scan over his lovely face with widened eyes for a heartbeat. Then she took a step forward and slowly lifted her hand to his hairline. He didn't move his head when she ran her fingers through his dark-brown waves.
To Draco and Narcissa's bewilderment, out from an unseen corner hopped along with a collection of, what they would find out later to be, muggle cleaning supplies: a mop, bucket, a rectangular sponge, a dustpan, some rags, a spray bottle fill of white vinegar and water, and a plain old broom. To Draco's confusion, the cleaning supplies hopped right into his arms.
"Oh, professor." She gasped happily. Pleasure and bliss swam over her and she wanted him to know that he was doing great. "Oh, Severus."
"I'm afraid I must leave," he announced with audible regret when he returned to the moonlight lagoon.
After a while, once the shock wore down, did Ariel push herself from the ground, her knees wobbling as she struggled for balance and straighten her back. Once her knees were still and she looked down at her own feet, her toes wiggling against the soft, damp fabric, did she smile. And from that smile came an explosion of joy.
He chuckled briefly then went quiet for a few seconds and asked, "Did you tell Draco Malfoy the Sebastian story?"
"Are you sure?" Dumbledore inquired, incredulously. "I mean, this is Voldemort we're talking about. Voldemort can't love. Direct-descendent from Salazar Slytherin, the product of date rape potion, soul split seven times, talks to snakes, can't feel love. That's his whole thing, right?"
"Oh, it gets worst. We were still on the boat to go on our honeymoon when I found him in bed with another. So, I murdered him in a jealous rage, wrecked the boat, went back home, got disowned for leaving the ocean and spent the last couple decades just drifting around being depressed and taking up potions in my spare time." Ariel explained. "So, yeah. I'm nothing now. Just a depressed asshole hoping against hope that maybe someone can help me hate myself a little less."
His two friends watched in awe and horror as their friend did precisely as she said. His wand fell from her face to his own waist. A second later, blood exploded from his crotch and the wizard wailing from excoriating pain.
"Well, well…well." She breathed as a cruel smile stretched across her lips. "Now, this is interesting."
"Ariel, I'd like to introduce you to my family." Voldemort said as he gestured to the first row and informing her as they strolled by, "This was my maternal grandmother. This was my maternal grandfather. This was my maternal uncle…" Then they veered towards the tree, towards the little square grave marker, which bore only the name 'MEROPE' and the numbers 1907-1926 and he told her, "And this…was… my mother."
Snape said nothing as he turned his head and looked everywhere besides the slain body of the wizard he just murdered. Thomas Fiddlebicker, newly retired. A longtime friend of Scrimgeour. Imaging the old lion-faced wizard's reaction from finding out a close friend had been murdered combined with the guilt of being that murderer, pained him like a repeated stab to the chest.
Ariel chuckled, then pecked his nose. "Got any floo powder?" She took the crown from her messenger bag and pushed it towards his stomach. "I'll pay you back I promise."
He growled. "Ugggh! I'm in the kitchen." He stood where he was while Bellatrix skittered into the kitchen, looking more crazy-eyed than usual.
Eventually, Nagini got bored with the chase and she crawled down from the ceiling, into the middle of the kitchen floor, and kept still.
"Leave the boy alone," Ariel said, listlessly. "You know, I had a marble statue of my crush in my treasure room when I was his age."
Voldemort waited until Draco's frightened footfalls disappeared into the second floor before he asked with an exasperated sigh, "Must you undermine me in front of my servants?"
"I know!" He said with a good-natured laugh. "I have definitely changed a lot since you last saw me. But then again," He gestured to her legs. "So, did you!" He took a step back and appraised her. "Wow. You haven't aged one bit! It's a good thing too. I almost didn't recognize you without the tail." Then he turned his head over his shoulder and addressed a stupefied Bellatrix, telling her with great reverence, "Bellatrix, I'm delighted to inform you that you are in the rare presence of royalty." He gave Ariel a flourish of his pale arm and announced, "This is Ariel, former siren princess, daughter of King Triton, granddaughter of King Neptune, and…" He turned his head back to Ariel and added somewhat tenderly, "A childhood hero to yours truly."
"One of my students." Snape replied. When he buckled his belt, he took his wand out and performed a silencing spell over the room to spare himself from his godson's nosy tendencies.
"Oh Ariel," he moaned watching her slid his penis back into her vagina without an instance of discomfort. "God, you're so wet."
Author's Note: Okay so 6 years ago I wrote an Ariel/ Snape fanfic that was so bad that when I reread it this year I vowed to not only delete that shit out of existence but rewrite the whole thing because frankly Movie Snape and Post-The-Little-Mermaid Ariel are my OTP and they deserve a better story.
Hermione let out an uproarious laugh. Then she propped her fist under her chin, turned her glassy eyes onto Ron and asked, coaxingly, "What about you, Ronald? Are you going to defend your best friend's honor and fight me?"
Draco gave him a shark-like grin. "Potter, you noticed I was out sick today?" He reached to his collarbone, feigning endearment. "I'm deeply flattered by how much you care about me."
One moment, they were sinking into the cool floorboards. The next thing he knew, he was scrunching his white toes in a batch of warm, bluish sand and they were outdoors underneath a balmy sun. Tom craned his pale neck towards a twinkling, clear, sunny sky and smiled with his eyes closed. The sunlight felt magnificent against his skin and what little modesty he possessed fell away from him as he slid off his black robes. He stood there, allowing a perfect breeze and a glorious sun to caress his bare body and he took a giant breath so he could drink in the pure ocean air. He opened his eyes with lazy happiness and turned his head to the horizon where aquamarine waves undulated as if to greet him and him alone.
Ariel didn’t say anything. Instead, she propped herself against the ultra-plush pillows, then turned her head all the way towards him, giving him a weak but heartfelt smile. Then, she pushed herself into the middle of the giant bed and gestured at him to join her.
"Ariel." It came out of him like a summer breeze. She gave him a small smile when it passed his lips and he had to avert his gaze to the top of her head, so that he wouldn't get tongue-tied looking into her eyes, to tell her, "But you are on Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry property. And as a teacher here, I must inform you that for the safety of our students, anybody that isn't authorized to be on school property, must leave. So…please leave."
"How is constantly solving my problems for me supposed to be good for me?" (Snape balked) "I don't know how many times I need to tell you this but: No one asked for your help."
He was so bony and pale he was looked like a skeleton, swallowed up in his black and white striped uniform. "Who are you?" He had a voice like broken glass.
Handsome Tom gave her an odd smile then he took a step towards her and wrapped his arms around her. "Yes, I do."
Pain exploded within her like a grenade as her tail uncurled and stiffened. A yellowish glow surrounded her as the sound of something being ripped tore through the air. She gnashed her teeth while agony sluiced through her bones. Wind from the Forbidden Forest roared as Snape continued to mutter out the words he needed for the spell, his unblinking eyes never leaving the tail which slowly split down her middle and eventually—with a horrible RIP—separated into two.
Something shattered behind him. Next thing he knew he was being run down by the Dark Lord. He watched as the Dark Lord rushed to Ariel's side, furiously patting over his robes' pockets in desperate, almost frantic, search for something.
Ariel smiled but said nothing. Her silence tempted Tom to search through her thoughts, to see what troubled her, but then Adella addressed him. "So, Tom, tell us about yourself."
"I missed you too…" Narcissa murmured, blinking away tears as she tightened her embrace, afraid that if she ever let go that would be the last thing she ever did.
"I'm afraid there are few options," Snape informed her, holding her close to him afraid that this was going to be one of his last chances to feel her body pressed against him or to be the focus of her crystal blue's eyes. "You can either reverse the glamor charm and go back to the ocean…"
Eventually, Ariel remembered her plans and she prepared their leave by placing seashells in a circle on the ground, which Tom watched with a vague smile on his handsome face. He was filled with a joy he never knew or never expected to know. Everything was coming together for him: Albus was dying, no doubt the old man would be dead before the end of next year; he had more followers now than he did forty years ago; and soon, when he obtained the Elder Wand, his powers will be stronger than they ever were, even before his quasi-death; and now, on top of all that, he was apart of a family.
"Yes." He sighed, rolling his eyes, looking more disappointed with himself than with her. He glanced at her and upon noticing her baffled expression, he said, "I would never force you to do anything you didn't want to do, Ariel." With another roll of his eyes, he muttered, "God, I'm going soft."
"Lucius," Voldemort said in a lukewarm voice that Lucius knew, from a previous life, often foreshadowed the calm before the raging storm. "Sit."
"Fuck off," Ariel replied without stopping which only served to make the janky wizard's friends cackle.
After a few minutes of blinking and trying to remember where she was, it occurred to her that she was still at Malfoy Manor. She looked down at the black silk blankets then over her shoulder to find, to her immense relief, that the bed she laid in was empty. She tried to look around the room but was impeded by the painful pulse in her forehead. She fell back into the pillows, with a groan.
"Ariel, you already know Narcissa." Voldemort introduced lazily. "This is Narcissa's son, Draco. One of our newest recruits. He's also the owner of the room you'll be staying in tonight."
It was the nicest compliment someone had ever given him, outside of his accomplishments. And the best part, it was sincere.
"Why are you so obsessed with me?" Draco demanded when the bartender handed Harry his drink and left to go restock the Fire Whiskey keg.
He hadn't slept in days. His decaying hand wouldn't let him. Every day, that rotting hand grew blacker, sicker, bonier. Some days he would wake up to the smell of Death choking him out of a sound sleep and he would look down at his hand and find it laughing at him. You arrogant old man, it would sneer at him. Sometimes it would be in Tom's voice. More often, it sounded like Aberforth's. His father's.
Ariel stared at the book the wind caught in her breath. She opened the cover and saw a stamp that read property of the libraries of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was already crying, spotting Tom Riddle's signature on the borrowed/ returned column. Wordlessly Narcissa opened the book to one page specifically which beheld a second envelope which bore the word 'mom'. "I found it when I was decluttering the house."
They didn't stand there holding each other long. At some point, Nagini came out and warned him, "Sssssomeone's here." Voldemort lifted his head and peered through the streaky window. He didn't see anything but he sensed what Nagini meant. Enemies were near. Too near. He pulled himself away from Ariel and told her, "Sleep tight, drunky." Before she could respond, he pinched a nerve in her neck. Instantly, her body went limp and her eyelids slammed shut. He carefully laid her down on the dirt ground, propped her head against her cloth bag for a pillow, then ordered Nagini to protect her. The cobra compiled, slithering over to her side, laying its body lengthwise against sleeping Ariel, who snored peacefully against the welcoming earth.
They rematerialized in a bare, dimly lit room. Ariel was struck immediately by the barrenness of the place: Aside from a meager chair that sat against the back wall beside an unused fireplace, like a squatter, everything about the place indicated that it was long abandoned. Cobwebs stretched from the ceiling to the floor in thick streams. No paintings or pictures decorated the walls. It was a decidedly unloved place. She felt a chill swim through her veins when she looked down at her bare feet discovered they trampled on years' worth of dust.
He smiled, locked the door with his wand, set it on the nightstand next to her empty glass and climbed into bed with her. She allowed him to rest his head against her chest, curling one arm around him as he cuddled into the crook of her warm body. For a moment, they merely held each other, pretending this wasn’t at all strange.
It took two weeks but she proved herself right. One morning during another thrilling round of sex she blurted out, mid-climax, "I love you." Snape ceased thrusting long enough to stop and ask, "What did you say?" But Ariel lied and said it was a heat of the moment act, nothing more. They continued fucking but Snape, who felt what Ariel was too cowardly to admit, exerted every last ounce of passion he could into their sex so that when they both came undone, he could plunge forward into an open mouth kiss look her in the eye and say, "I love you too."
"The man literally called me his 'hero'. He told me that 'I wouldn't be the wizard I am today if I wasn't for you'." Ariel ranted, her voice rising with anger and shame as she pushed herself from the floor and started to pace. "He literally called me his origin story. I am the reason that Lord Voldemort exists. I'm the reason there are little kids running around with no parents. I'm the reason millions of creatures are dead. I'm the reason—"
Desperate for adventure, Ariel hopped out of her chair, grabbed her mug of wine, and said with a sincere smile, "I would love that."
"Yeah, I'm great." Ariel replied sarcastically as she lifted herself up from her couchant position. She turned and shot a piercing look at the elderly wizard as she added, "Tried being nice to a kid in a cave and look what happens? The kid grows up and commits mass fucking genocide."
He was still sending goodbyes when he and Ariel made their leave for the shoreline, waving and shouting as he walked backward, drunk on love, "Goodbye Auntie Adella. Farewell Auntie Adriana. Arrivederci, Auntie Arista. Adieu, Auntie Alana. Adios Auntie Aquatta. Au revoir Auntie Attina!"
“Everyone but her sister and her nephew it seems.” He said, moving his ear to her heartbeat. He listened for a while in indulgent silence then remarked, “This is nice.”
It took sixteen bodies for him to admit he couldn't murder his problems away and he finally fled to the one place he knew nobody would look for him.
Ariel reached over and took the book from him. Then she got up, took him by the hand, and lead him to the couch. He took one end and she took the other. With the book propped up on her bended knees, she explained, "I figured we could read some of the stories together." She glanced over the top of the book and caught his stunned stare. "I mean if you're not too old to be read to."
Snape let out a heavy exhale which Draco knew was a sign of relent. He smiled at Snape as he retreated back into his office. "So, what's her name?" He said teasingly. He couldn't help himself. Teasing Uncle Sev was one of his favorite pastimes, besides goading Potter and writing hilarious diss tracks about his enemies.
"Walk much, Potter?" Draco sneered before he shouldered past Harry and rushed into the bar's entrance.
"Good. Probably for the better." He agreed. Then, with his elbow pressed into his armrest, he leaned towards her and explained in a hushed tone, "I have a meeting with the Full-Blooded Giant Mafia in the morning that's best have clandestine."
Voldemort frowned hard. He looked like he was going to burst from a boiling rage. Abruptly, he snapped his head at Draco and ordered the young man to scatter. He did without hesitation though inwardly he wished was braver and could have stood up to the Dark Lord on Ariel's behalf. But he couldn't and he left that poor woman alone and defenseless with that deranged wizard.
He gently pulled her into a hug and told her hairline as she wept uncontrollably into his robes, "I know." He rubbed her convulsing back as she cried out years of regret, loneliness, and heartbreak, telling her, "I know."
They meandered to the shoreline where Adella spotted them first and all their collective attention span was zeroed in on Ariel and this new younger stranger.
"Or you can stay on land," Dumbledore piped in, "And, hopefully, use your influence on Voldemort to do some good."
At some point, he remembered himself and pulled himself out of the reverie to find dutiful Snape quietly waiting for him to return to the present.
"Yep," Ron said, showing his scribbled-up papers as proof. "I did the easy assignments when I got them and worked on the tedious projects ahead of time instead of procrastinating."
“Um, I’m not that hungry,” she confessed as she watched a sour-faced Bellatrix cast a water spell onto the ground, spraying the ground with her wand, and forcing the blood into a nearby balcony where it undoubtedly was pushed onto the property’s soil.
Ariel smiled. The way he said it made her insides ache. She reached for his hand and started rubbing his thumb, never losing eye contact as she said, "Oh yeah."
Holding his blazing wand above him like a torch, he held out his other hand for her, which she took with only small hesitation, and led her through the curtain of darkness that leads into the heart of the cave.
Voldemort lost track of time. He didn't even realize Ariel had left the garden until Greyback had lost control of his bowels which was usually around this time that he found the task of torture tedious. When he idly glanced out into the garden to discover the small white round table was empty, he told Greyback, as the werewolf writhed in his own waste against the kitchen floor, "Today's your lucky day, Greyback." He planted his blood-speckled foot onto Greyback's throat and pressed down until he felt the man's Adam's Apple flatten under his weight. "I've decided not to kill you. Better yet, I've decided not to tell Ariel of the horrible things you said about her."
The decision came out of nowhere. They were reading quietly on the couch together when Snape looked up from his book and found himself staring at Ariel, his heart burning with profound love. He began listing all the things he loved about her: things beyond her beauty and her kindness, small things like how she hummed when she was happy and sang when she was sad; how her nose turned upward when she was mad; how she easily she cried whenever she spotted a cute animal; how she was quick to forgive and quicker to understand. He could've written a list on a mile-long parchment in all the ways he adored her which is why, out of nowhere, he asked her, "Will you marry me?"
At some point, she woke up in a bed she didn’t recognize fully clothed with a heaviness weighing over her eyes and a pounding headache. The windows revealed the sun hadn’t moved much. It was still not yet evening.
"We only asked because we made a list of words we wanted him to say," insisted Adriana with her cheerful lisp pointing to an area of sand where words were had been written with a finger.
She waited for him in the garden. She sat at a round little patio table, watching two albino peacocks wander through the manicured backyard freely until eventually one of them got tired of being followed and attacked their companion for no discernible reason. Shrieks were made; talons were drawn. The squabble ended as soon as it started with one victorious and the other cut up, missing tuffs of feathers, red streaking the immaculate white body.
"How did this happen?" He asked, his voice muffled as he face-planted into the ornate rug. "How did I become…that guy? That seventy-year-old guy with mommy issues?" Narcissa opened her mouth to offer her thoughts when he cut in again, head turned sideways so he could breathe, "I mean—I know I was an orphan but…Merlin's beard, am I really that weak? Am I nothing but an overgrown child who needs their mommy?"
"Every year it's something!" He raved from his desk, throwing his bad hand in the air while his good hand cradled a bottle of Firewhiskey. "Every year! Merlin's beard I can't wait to die."
"This is about you achieving apotheosis! Don't lie to me. I know you, Tom. You want so badly to be immortal you’ll take the whole world down with you! And exploiting people's hates and fears into getting what you want!"
Each time the sound of a knife connected with a cutting board jutted Draco's racing heart. He looked around for the Dark Lord but it was only them.
"This is too fucking weird." Bellatrix spat, folding her arms across her chest, frowning and glaring.
She drew a sharp breath, preparing a scream that would've blown every last one of them to smithereens, but Voldemort silenced her by taking her by the upper arm and swearing, quickly and with vehemence, "They're not going to hurt you! They're not going to hurt you!" She looked him in the face then gawked at the shambling masses of half-decomposed, half-falling-apart corpses. "Trust me. I've trained them not to."
When she came back into the hallway, he thanked her profusely (if the Dark Lord hadn't already thought less of him for his father's actions and his shrine, then his diary would have sealed his fate at the bottom of the Dark Lord totem pole right next to blood traitors and Peter Pettigrew) and Ariel, to his gratitude, was kind enough to smile at him and pretend like she had no idea what he was talking about.
Minutes eked by as he stood there, eerily silent and still, rummaging through her belongings as if he were deciding which he wanted to take from her after he took her life from her. He disappeared from her vision to bend down and retrieve something she couldn't see before straightening his back, his eyes focused on a drawing she was fond of.
A second later, Snape was in the doorway with a small glass vial in his hand. Draco reached for it but he withdrew his hand, telling him firmly, "Don't make this into a habit."
"That one you always sing," he said as he lowered the top half of his body, resting his head on her tail.
He frowned, hard. "You're disowning me." He said it with the finality of someone who knew this day was coming for a long time.
"We should give the married couple some privacy," Bellatrix said to Ariel, feigning annoyance at their affections.
Ariel had set a glass of water in front of him. When he caught her eye, she looked away as if embarrassed.
He gestured to her in-tact tail. She glanced at it her eyelids heavy the moment they landed on scaly appendage which curled towards them, away from the water, the paper-thin webbing of her dorsal fin shimmered against the pale moonlight. She turned herself until all of herself was out of the water and her tail hovered before Snape.
Potter chuckles, “Of course I would. Not only is she gorgeous she’s charming and sweet and she’s been there for me all my life. Plus I’ve heard how she sounds getting shagged and I still wank to the memory.”
“Of course I did. It’s amusing for me to watch you try and persuade Slytherins,” Draco replies, tilting his head to give Potter better access for kissing and biting his neck. “Come to the kitchen, I will make you some tea.”
“She doesn’t have any magic, so you will need to keep a careful eye on her. It’s your responsibility to keep her safe and teach her about our culture.”
"What about the thing Ron asked you to do for me on Tuesday night? I want that as well," Pansy said.
Swinging his bag over his left shoulder Harry said, "I don't know. Probably about Malfoy being a git."
Which, to be fair… he had a point. Harry tried to scoff but it came out more choked and breathy than air-of-annoyance he had been going for.
“I ordered it to go,” Potter said from behind Draco. He reached over to grab the bag. “Don’t worry, I remembered your poncy mustard.”
“Just to recap,” Pansy said, her dark hair swinging against her jawline as she turned to Blaise, “you think the Savior is trying to cockblock you?”
He had the rebellious traits of both parents, the wildness of a werewolf, skills of a metamorphmagus. His father's high intelligence and his mother's wicked sense of humor. Raised by two Slytherin women and doted on from birth by none other than Harry Potter. At twenty years old Teddy was the darling of the wizarding world. Sweet, kind, seductive, cunning, and reckless.
Harry grabbed his hand and inner locked their fingers, "I mean it," he said, making purposeful eye contact with the blond. "Ron isn't going anywhere, so you will have to find a way to get along."
Pansy scoffed, rolling onto her stomach. Blaise watched Daphne's eyes travel appreciatively over the curve of Pansy's back before she started drawing the other wing. “That's a waste of a lie, honey," Pansy said. "Of course you want to date him."
That opened his mind to too many possibilities and dark forbidden fantasies began to bloom. Harry tried to stop thinking all together and asked, "How did you know?"
Harry looked at Draco, panicked at the idea. He hated Umbridge but there was no telling what would happen to her at the manor. Draco didn't look concerned in the least, he just smirked and even had the nerve to wink.
“No,” Neville said, “It wasn’t that, so much as it was the war. At least that’s what Luna and I think.”
Draco is fascinated by the exchange. He doesn't think he's ever felt so thrilled by someone else's jealousy. When the waiter leaves the bill in his hands Draco waits until he leaves to open it. Sure enough there is a phone number written on the paper and a messy 'text me' beside it. Draco's been hit on this way before but Potter clearly hasn't.
Pansy's eyes were bright when he looked back at her and he could feel a lump in his throat that he swallowed through before leaving for the night.
talk about this. He tried to make the rest of the question come out, but all his throat could produce was a self-pitying groan. Orion came over and hopped up on the chair next to him, snuggling himself in between the plush cushions and Harry’s leg.
"Fuck you Potter," Draco says, kissing Harry hard and breathless. His hands raking over every part of Harry's bare skin that he can touch.
to offer it!" McGonagall spat the words at Umbridge. Harry remembered when his Headmistress had told him to keep his temper with Umbridge in 5th year, and how both of them had failed miserably. The woman just brought out the worst in people.
Harry looked at Draco properly then. When the door had opened Harry had only been able to see Draco's heated eyes, the way his lips curved. Now, looking at him, Harry could see that his hair is naturally messy instead of on purpose, and his feet were bare, and Harry wanted more. More time. More mornings. More nights. More Draco. He surged forward, burying his nose in the soft pale-blonde curls above Draco's prick, and breathing in the musky smell of him. Leaning back, he wrapped a hand around the base of Draco's cock -there's no way he could fit all of it in his mouth- and licked the tip.
"Right, right. Anyway, she went through this whole list of questions with Potter, which he basically gave one-word answers to. Then she asked him to describe your hair!" she finished, vibrating with excitement.
Harry closed his eyes, breathing in the scent of citrus and high-dollar cologne that he’d quickly come to associate with pure lust. Draco had shoved him to the bed and straddled him before Harry had even said hello. The blond was currently sitting atop him, his legs spread out to bracket Harry’s thighs, and pulling brightly colored rope from his bedside table.
At home, Harry inhaled a sandwich and changed his clothes. He was late to meet his friends at the pub. On his way to the door, he was stopped by a fire call from Ginny and Hermione.
"Please take me to her. I think we should get ahead of this." She turned to Draco, "The meeting tonight should not be in the paper. We need to distract the public, lest your Father become front page news."
Neville, ever the perfect assistant, reminded Harry of his meeting with the interior designer tomorrow, and text him the address so it was a fresh notification on his cell.
"I don't understand," Ron said, "didn't we already have this conversation when you told us you like blokes?"
"Hi," she said, "Did you order a ride? I'm sorry I'm late. I had trouble with my mobile, but I did try to call you. Do you want me to carry anything? We can still make it to the meeting easily. Traffic isn't bad."
Pansy bears her teeth at him and Draco thinks she might have been trying to smile but couldn’t quite manage. The two of them sit at the table while Draco finishes making the tea. Pansy pulls her copy of Witch Weekly over and looks at the picture.
They were scheduled to sign the paperwork on the flat in two weeks. Part of Draco had wanted to wait for this moment until they had that paperwork signed. He just couldn't resist the date, September 1st. So, he conspired a plan with Anna who was happy to help. She wasn't originally happy, as she had -in her words-
Ernie leaned over to look at the note, far too close for comfort. Draco tried to back up only to remember that his back was already pressed against the wall. "I think she was trying to reward you. It's always nice to go out to eat."
The magic danced before him, showing itself like a stained glass curtain. Being taught to see magic this way was Draco's favorite part of Unspeakable training. Growing up around magic meant that it felt commonplace most of the time, but seeing it like this, in the wards, still inspired awe. He'd spent long nights during his training talking to Granger about her first experiences with magic.
Harry's face broke into a broad grin. "It's from Lucius Malfoy's private stock. I think Narcissa gives me bottles of it just to piss him off."
Draco smiled broadly, "Because you came to save me but I'd already taken care of it. I stole your hero moment." He looked exceedingly smug.
To his surprise, Potter choked on his coffee and blushed furiously at the question. "I know a little," he said, once his breathing returned.
Mr. Malfoy pointed to a door on the other side of the deck. "I'll bet that door takes you right through Sirius' room."
The Room of Requirement has pulled out all the stops. Hermione must have been in charge of telling the Room what was needed because it's perfect. There are plush pillows in one corner, a large table with Exploding Snap, a deck of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes cards, and a Wizard's chessboard.
"I've been through far worse the past few years than those fuckwits," Draco said. He eyed the spot where the other students had been tied up, "I did take a bit of anger out on them. Not physical though, except for what was needed to keep them here. But there was a lot of shouting before you got here." He shrugged one shouldered.
Neville met Blaise at the door, grabbing his hand and dragging him to the middle of the room. Keeping their fingers entwined, Neville excitedly told Blaise about the Songbell flowers he was growing.
Harry thought, as loudly as possible, panicked at the thought that Zabini was going to tell Neville about Malfoy.
Harry helped him up and Ron flashed him a lopsided smile, pulling him into a hug. "Thanks for the help."
Harry managed a laugh to go along with his eye roll. She wasn't lying, oddly enough, she often tried to help him. Years ago, Parkinson had offered to fund the building of the Burrow in order to make amends for her actions during school. He'd declined, of course, but did agree to a cup of tea and a long conversation. They hadn't become friends after that, but they were more than acquaintances.
He looked over the railing of the stairs first, just to make sure Orion hadn't fallen through the wrought iron. Able to breathe a bit easier after
"Don't worry," Draco said easily, "after the glowing review you gave about me to the Wizengamot, I'm the only Malfoy allowed to make decisions about money or property. Father doesn't have the power to fight this, only I have that power."
Harry stepped forward, his heart beating so wildly he was briefly concerned it might be loud enough to give him away. Draco was turned mostly away from the door but not fully, looking down. Harry could still see his profile, and the smirk that played on his lips as he crossed his arms in front of himself and pulled off his shirt slowly, purposefully. The flex of his biceps and the shift of Draco's back as his arms went up made Harry light headed with
Pansy takes a breath and pushes out her next words as quickly as possible, “I’m sleeping with Astoria.”
Harry nipped at Draco's bottom lip before answering, pleading, "I want to bottom," and felt the way Draco's body shivered at the words.
She held up a comic book, showing Hermione the cover. When Hermione didn't immediately object, she opened it and pointed to a picture.
Dracos stomach swooped before settling somewhere beneath the soles of his shoes. Maybe talking to Anna had been a bad idea. "Whatever Potter," Draco said, fighting the urge to smile back at him. "Could they get in the way I did?"
“Malfoy,” Draco interrupted, pointing a finger in Potter's face. “You call me Malfoy. What is with everyone today thinking they can use my given name?”
Draco looked back and forth between them, his brows drawn together in concentration. "I-" he began hesitantly, but, finding he had no response, he fell silent, absorbing the information. Then he looked back to Blaise and said, "I don’t understand. I could easily describe Potter’s hair, and it’s no surprise he can describe mine. He’s known me since he was 11, he-”
"He's in bed," Harry answered, then his mouth tilted into a lopsided smile. "He's not exactly speaking to me at the moment. We had a bit of a disagreement."
Harry looked at the gargoyle for a moment, then down at the paper in his hand, sighed, and said, "Elder Wand." The staircase appeared and he took it to the Headmistress' office. When he entered he looked around, noticing McGonagall standing behind her desk with Professor Loire standing next to her.
"Don't be rude," Hermione said. Then, addressing the group, "I just worry about spin the bottle because you don't have consent."
Scorpius offered what he hoped looked like a boyish smile, "You always say that some exposure before your first day would have helped you. Besides, she's your niece, don't you want to be around for the first chocolate frog card she gets?"
Zabini hummed in response and said, "I don't suppose you have something sweet I could have instead?"
Draco flicked the bow, lifted an eyebrow and drawled, "I hope you don't think you will get laid that easily."
Draco pulls back with a laugh, “You’re an insatiable beast, Potter. If you behave yourself I’ll suck you off before my date.”
Hermione thinks, trying to decide if that's better or worse than assuming he was trying to make a statement. "I see," she says.
Harry sank further into his chair. From the corner of his eye, he saw Draco's fingers tighten their grip around the arms of his chair.
“I think,” Boot said, “this assignment is a joke. There’s nothing we can really do about the books at this point, except continuing to promote the idea that they are only works of fiction.”
Harry turned to the wall he had been working on and thunked his head against it. "How do they not have better things to report on?"
Draco’s heart beat so loudly, he thought it might drown out all other sounds. Of course, he wasn’t that lucky. Instead, he heard the string of Parseltongue whispered softly against his skin. Potter pulled back, his eyes dark, brilliant green edged out by lust-blown pupils.
Astrid watched delightedly as her clothes floated up and wrapped themselves on the hangers. Afterwards Scorpius caught her wrist and clasped on the bracelet that matched his own. He smiled and touched his with a thumb and then his finger. Her wrist went a little warm and she looked down to see the words, -
Pansy smirked, "I've seen the outfits doll, that's why I chose this theme. Daphne is going to dress as Harley Quinn."
, and dark smoke filled Harry's field of vision. He was breathing hard by this point and dropped to the ground to inhale as little smoke as possible.
She shook it and said, "Yes, of course. I'm Professor Loire. I'll be your new DADA professor," and dropped his hand.
"Weaslette," came a voice from the other side of the door, which opened immediately, allowing entrance for Ernie Macmillan.
“Pansy, what’s the matter? Whatever it is, you can tell me.” This is true. He’s not just saying it to coerce her, he is fiercely loyal to Pansy regardless of what she’s done.
Behind him, Draco chuckled. "You don't share me. And Weasel is right. I definitely don't share." He wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and set his chin on Harry's shoulder.
Loire pressed the palm of her hand to her temple, closing her eyes, "There has to be someone. Someone at the ministry who is worse than her, who can beat her, throw a bigger tantrum. Someone who everyone fears more than her." She looked to McGonagall, "You've been around for nearly a hundred years Minerva, you must know someone who would be able to fight her on this. We have to fight fire with fire."
Draco shoved the finger away, "Don't even finish that sentence, Potter. I already know how your self-righteous high-morale-ground speech is going to play out and I don't need to hear it."
On Sunday he went to the burrow. The house was abuzz with people, hugs, and food. After dinner, he joined Ron and Hermione to discuss her parents and the offer Ron and Harry had received from the auror department to start training.
was the word Headmistress McGonagall had used -eyes narrow and lips pulled tight in a grim line- when Blaise and Potter had explained the rooming situation after waking up in infirmary.
Harry dropped to his knees, tugging at the string that's lacing up the front of Draco's pants. He looked up, knowing Draco couldn't resist pleading eyes, and waited patiently for permission. "Please. I've been good for you."
"Harry!" George's voice broke through the moment. He walked over to the 3 of them, the sleeves of his robes covered in dust that he was brushing off.
"Astoria is working?" Draco asks. It's not common for a pure-blood woman to work outside of the few in the Ministry.
The words of praise spread through Harry the way they always did and he felt a flush invade his face. He chided himself for blushing so easily. Of all the kinks he could have developed as a teenager, why did it have to be praise?
Draco kissed him again, slow, sweet and purposeful, taking his time to lick into his mouth and slide his tongue against Harry's. When Draco started to rut against him Harry lost all notion of control, his hands wrapped around gripped the blonde's waist, pulling him in.
Blaise liked his new room much more than the old one. He'd thought of swapping to be with Draco more and even the playing field so that Draco would be more comfortable in his room. However, there were several benefits. Blaise's bed was next to the window now, which he much preferred over the middle of the room.
He arrived early, to miss the other students, and headed to the eighth year dorms. He listened to a morning show until Pansy arrived.
“Um,” he said. This was not something he said very often. Even though he was raised with softened standards compared to the stringent traditions of his Father’s generation, there were some things that didn’t change. Bottom line, Malfoys do not say ‘um.’ So, it wasn’t surprising when Draco stopped talking and everyone in the kitchen turned to look at him. Scorpius picked up the invitation and handed it to Harry who stared at it, speechless, before handing it to Draco and dropping his face into his hands.
Harry set the kitchen to cook his breakfast with a few waves of his hand while he sat at the table drinking his coffee and considering how many cups of it he could have before it was considered a problem.
Harry's lips pressed against him ruthlessly until Draco could taste copper. He threaded his fingers in that messy hair and pulled him back. Harry stood panting while Draco removed his glasses and dropped them on the floor. Draco chuckled, "Slow down, I'm not going anywhere."
Harry and Draco both shuddered. Blaise laughed and Ernie turned to Pansy and said, "Oh really? Have you already done that?"
He glanced over at her, surprised she was willing to do this, and walked through the shop door. Ginny came around the counter upon seeing them. She wore a pale green summer dress with matching Converse. Harry had gifted her the shoes when he came out to her as gay. She'd rolled her eyes at the offer and told him that he was being ridiculous, said she couldn't be mad at him for the way he is. However, she did keep the shoes and seemed to wear them often.
Blaise thought. He reasoned that Draco kept to a regimented schedule though. Maybe Potter was just observ-
“I see,” Draco looks over Harry slowly, eyes lingering on the rapid jumping of his pulse point, his bare chest, and the hem of his jeans. “So you didn’t know it was supposed to be someone who looks like me? Is that why you jumped on me the second I walked into your office?”
"Oh stop it," Hermione said through an embarrassed laugh as she went back to her desk. "Nothing is going on behind Ron's back, Harry."
The Headmistress looked at Harry for a long moment, then turned back to Professor Loire. "You're right," she said slowly. "We don't need a heroic Gryffindor for this, we need someone who can take her down, no matter the consequences." She looked back at the boys and took a measured breath. "Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said, and waited for him to meet her eye, "I think it's time your Father heard about this."
Harry casts a protection charm over both of them right before Draco spells lube onto his fingers. He spreads Harry's ass and his smile turns feral. "Fuck you're hot."
Harry felt a smile bloom on his own lips, and was thankful Malfoy wasn't looking at him as he followed down the stairs.
"Oh, thank you," Draco said, running a hand through his hair. "I can't at the moment. The lions went to play Quidditch so I have the room to myself." He motioned to the empty beds. "I'm going to have a breakdown and then a shower before dinner."
Draco hooks a finger under Potter's chin and tips his face up so Potter's looking up at him. "Shut up, Potter."
"I know 'Mione but we are all of age and there's no rules against it." Harry smiled as he watched Hermione grimace. "Don't worry. If it works well for a week I'll submit a formal request, all right?" At least that seemed to appease her.
Harry walked with his hands stuffed in his pockets so that he wouldn't be tempted to touch Draco with his mother here.
“I need to try some of your dessert, it’s a different flavor than mine,” she said, with complete sincerity.
Malfoy’s eyes drop to her left arm where the word is carved into her skin, and he draws in a slow breath before meeting her eye again. “I didn’t think you had this in you, Granger,” and the way he says the words makes Hermione feel like he’s being completely honest with her.
Draco hips roll, his erection pressing against Harry's. They both groan before Draco answers, "Were you planning to have that rentboy fuck you in here?"
Ron turned an incredulous look on her, "And what would you do if I said those words to you?" he asked.
Blaise glanced at Draco and raised a questioning eyebrow. He received a single nod in return. "Yes," Blaise said.
Scorpius Malfoy seemed to always be blushing when he was around James. Or, more accurately, when James saw him with Albus.
Draco huffed a laugh and gave Blaise a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Well, when you find something better you come tell me." His long fingers reached out for the door to close it. "See you at dinner."
"I'll take one too," Draco said, using that easy smile he apparently had more, on the sales clerk, "if you don't mind."
Blaise, who had been attractive for as long as he could remember, trained in the arts of seduction by his mother, and raised in the Slytherin dorms, hardly knew what to do with Longbottom. The only experience Blaise had with someone who was a late bloomer was Pansy. Except Pansy knew that she was hot now, where Longbottom still seemed unaware. The only thing Blaise knew for sure was that he needed to be careful around the boy. Longbottom wasn't just a Gryffindor, he was a war hero, and Potter's best friend.
Blaise walked up to the North tower to join his fellow 8th-year students with Draco and Pansy trailing behind him. Coming back to Hogwarts to repeat 7th-year had been an easy decision. His other option was to stay home and sit through the ‘romance phase’ of his mother’s new relationship and he just didn’t have it in him. Besides, Draco had a court order to attend Hogwarts and he wanted to be with him.
Harry noticed the way her voice floated through the hall without being loud or abrasive. "Yes," he said, "I didn't- that is the other students- I mean- No, actually, there's not. It won't happen again."
Draco swallowed through a wave of nausea, images of Potter limp in Hagrid's arms flashing through his mind. He pushed on, "Do you know when the next full moon is?"
Umbridge shrank back ever so slightly, then she replied in a high pitched screech, "Working here so long has addled your brain! I'm going to the ministry to report this to sane people! I will have someone come here and remove that boy!" She stormed over to the fireplace and disappeared in a burst of flame.
Blaise huffed, and stood up. "This is ridiculous." He glanced around the common room but there were no other tables available.
“I know you are dealing with the same thing,” she said, as though the matter were already settled. Harry would like it stated for the record that the matter was
Yep. Harry had seen plenty. Enough that Hermione had offered him a glass of water during one of the meetings, stating that she and
Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously "That's ridiculous, you've been happily tormenting me since I was eleven."
Sitting down, she glances at him to see if the dress has had the desired effect. Though his eyes are definitely taking her in, he looks more suspicious than interested. “Thank you for meeting with me,” Hermione says, giving him a small, sweet, practiced smile.
was a good look on Potter, with his flinty green eyes and clenched fists. Draco shook his head trying to focus. Macmillan was still touching him, doing his best to look as though he wanted Draco's attention.
They both stop and stare at each other. Pansy opens her mouth to talk but Draco holds up a hand and she waits. “What do you mean, you’re sorry?”
“Save it for someone else Potter,” Pansy interrupted. “I promise we will be back in time for you to go out tonight. I know you don’t have a life so don’t try to get out of it.”
Harry was surprised to find it only took a bit of focus from him for the wall to come solidly back into place. He spun on his heel to the loo, eager to take the fastest shower of his life.
Harry didn't reply, only blinked at the idea of Hermione talking to the Slytherin. A fresh smile was pulling at Draco's lips, and Harry tried desperately to keep making eye contact rather than letting his eyes drop.
"Hermione specifically told me not to do that," Harry said, rubbing at the back of his neck. "She said we should talk about things first and have a proper date," he said, thinking of the whispered lecture she had given him during dinner when Ron was distracted with Seamus talking about the Chudley Cannons.
Harry sat cross-legged on his bed with his charms book laid out before him, freshly changed from his Quidditch gear into denims and a Cannons t-shirt. He was studying for the group project they were starting on Friday. At least, he
paparazzi had ever managed to take of him. The first few pictures had been awkward. The people would hold up their phone and push the buttons, then look at the picture and pout. Finally, a girl with dark eyeliner and purple streaks in her hair had fixed the issue.
Harry chuckled, "You didn't really think I would give you caffeine this late. You have to be up at a reasonable hour tomorrow."
Since then he had put together a renovation business that was thriving in the post-war world. By May 2001 he'd done 7 renovations, hired a part-time team to help with building, hired an assistant, and moved into this new apartment.
Blaise gave him a charming smile and walked back into the room. He waited until Potter was back on his bed, carefully not watching Draco, before making a move.
"Thank you," Draco replied, accepting the cone. What else could he do? Draco loved dessert before dinner, and Potter had just bought him ice cream. Besides, he was to worked up from the conversation with Anna to be shirty over ice cream.
Draco turned to him with the haughtiest Malfoy look he could muster, “You do realize that if unspeakable is going to be your actual job title you will have to find a way to stop talking?”
A handsome, high strung, sales clerk who smelled faintly of cinnamon had claimed Harry as soon as he'd walked through the door. That was another benefit, the staff was always good looking. Harry hadn't told anyone yet, that he found men attractive, having only been honest with himself about a few months ago. It was confusing. During his brief relationship with Ginny, before she signed with the Harpies, the sex had been great and there was no denying his attraction to her. However, he also couldn't deny that he did check out guys. He had tried to deny it, but his friends were all to happy to point it out every time they caught him checking out a blonde.
