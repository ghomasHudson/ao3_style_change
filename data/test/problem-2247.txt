“That’s why you will end that engagement tomorrow. I will confront Lucius myself tomorrow.”, I answered Draco.
“Lexie.”
“And I’m his mother, Martha Robinson.”
They started the questions and by the time that the potion lost its effects, Draco saw Harry with a hurt look on his face and tears streaming down of his face.
“Look, my visit to your ex-husband is a personal one.”
“My wife’s name is Lexie.” Robbie told Draco, and Draco instantly shut up.
“Harry you don't understand, please don't.”, Draco said while sobbing.
Harry turns around to look at his husband missing the way that Robbie is smiling.
It was his lesson to never cheat on those you love in search for something better because by the time you know that the best was already in your arms, you already lost them. And to those who are side-pieces please know your place, and please stop. You are worth more than being a side-piece, but that doesn’t mean that you should have the audacity to demand more than what you have.
“Oh, by the way, I haven’t introduced myself.” The woman says as she walks towards Harry. “My name is Lexie, but to my friends and Draco I go by my sexy nickname known as Slexie: by sound and by nature.”
“Oh shut it Astoria before I get angry and throw your whole family out of Britain right now.”, that finally shut her up.
No response from the mother-son duo.
They went back to Britain where they renewed their marriage vows. They had Luna as their surrogate, she happily agreed as she knew that both men are in search for someone that they could trust to be their surrogate. Then 9 months after that, their son Scorpius Orion Potter-Malfoy was born and with his birth Draco never sought out anybody else.
Harry looks at her and scoffed and looked at her.
After 2 months, our baby finally arrived. Well our babies to be exact. We found out on my 6th month that we are having triplet boys. Altair James was first, he had the iconic Malfoy blond hair and my green eyes but this time his was lighter. Alphard Siri followed, he had my hair and Draco's silver eyes but last and not the least. Atlan Remus met the world, he had Draco's hair with strands of black hair mixed in. He was also heterochromatic. His left eye was silver and his right eye is green.
All of our children eventually went to Hogwarts. Aurora was sorted to Slytherin while Aquila was in Ravenclaw. Alaric was in Slytherin, Azazel was in Ravenclaw and Aries was sorted to Gryffindor. Everything was the greatest that it has ever been in my life. No more Dark Lord that wants my head and a prophecy that wants me dead.
“And the actions are?”
“I-“, Draco tried to talk but Harry sent him to a chair and tied him down, then a vial of potion was floating in front of him. Veritaserum, Harry popped the vial open and fed Draco a few drops of the potion.
“Draco I have one more thing to say so please let go of me.”, I said.
“Tell the truth, my brother.” Robbie says as he walks into Draco’s space. “Don’t forget that the truth will set you free.”
“Do you know her, hon?”
“Why didn’t you just ask me? We could’ve gotten a surrogate, is it really a child or the need to fill another hole?” Harry asked making Draco flinch, he was right. Draco was in need of something else that Harry couldn’t give him.
“Move out of the damn way!” A voice bellowed.
“Then watch-” Martha says, walking towards Harry as she digs into her purse, but Draco cuts her off.
“Burn the evidence, babe.” Draco repeats in a dangerous tone.
“They said that it was imperative.” Harry answered.
The doorbell starts going off like crazy.
“Sorry? And what should I be sorry for? If I were to ever say that I’m sorry, that means that I have done something wrong and I haven’t done anything wrong.”
“I’m sorry got held back at the meeting, you know that Father can't do it anymore you know? He is basically preparing me for when I become Lord Malfoy.”, Draco lied because by the way he smelt he was forced to stay with Astoria clinging to him.
So; this was it then.
night his husband would bed him.
“We didn’t have the cat when I bought the groceries,” Draco pointed out.
The kitchen fell into silence, Teddy glaring at him from his vigil in front of Malfoy. It was…unbearably awkward.
“Okay.” Harry agreed, but before he could react Teddy was grabbing his hand and dragging him towards the television.
Hermione grimaced. “I have no issues with diplomacy. I have issues with you sacrificing your personal life in the name of duty.”
In the beginning, after the war, Harry had felt both a steadying feeling of peace as well as a calm drive to help the people who'd been affected by all that had happened. Weeks went by with Harry at hospital bedsides, letting people he'd never met but who had fought know they were going to be okay. That it was over. That there was hope again. He cried when they cried, but when he left at the end of the day he was at peace, because he'd helped someone find their own.
His name was Teddy.
Harry sighed, but his mood was still high. Not even walking into work to a thick file on his desk could ruin his mood.
“Sit down, Potter,” Malfoy scorned, but his tenor was much softer than the scorn he’d shown at Hogwarts, “You’re our guest.”
“Uh,” Harry didn’t want to break Teddy’s stride, “Because they’re alike?”
Tucking Teddy into one arm, he extended his other hand in the mimic of a handshake. Teddy stared. Reaching out, Draco took Teddy’s hand in his and gave it a decisive shake. “There. Thank you so much for forgiving me.”
Swallowing his nerves Draco quickly moved towards the bed, gliding past his husband and ignoring the heat coming off the other man’s body. He reached the bed and heard the heavy half-run Harry did to catch up to him. The bed was a four-poster monstrosity with the typical blood-red colouring in both the canopy and the duvet. Draco hesitated, then blanched.
Teddy nodded, giddily taking off to the kitchen just beyond the archway. Harry watched as Teddy reached down and produced a small ceramic bowl full of kibble that he gave a careful shake. Immediately, the cat jumped from Malfoy’s arms, using his chest as a springboard and launching himself towards Teddy. Teddy squealed once again, eagerly placing the bowl back on the floor and backing away.
Malfoy exhaled, straightening up and dusting his pale blue jumper. “So,” he said, not making eye contact, “supper will be ready soon. We’re having roast.”
Since begging was obviously not working Harry slid a prime cut of roast bird off his plate and onto Ron’s. Ron looked at him like he’d hung the stars.
Harry inspected the film. It had a number of different cats in different states, some playing instruments. “
“This is why we never got you a crup.”
“I need to see Teddy.”
"But I always put peas in the stew." Malfoy said reasonably, glaring at the sky before snaking his arm back inside and coming back with an umbrella.
“What will happen to him if I say no?”
“We’re going to have to wear our robes to bed,” Harry said from behind a hand towel. Apparently the servants had prepared the room beforehand, a detail Draco should have noticed by the lit candles. Had they prepared…other things? How two men got on was as foreign to Draco as sex with a woman would be, but you needed…extra things, right?
“I used to.” Teddy said. “But then my hair got all wobbly and Draco thought it would be better to go to a magic place.”
Draco barely felt the days pass.
“So it appears.” Malfoy said peacefully, brushing a hand though Teddy’s hair. Malfoy bit his lip,
The final piece to his outfit was the snow white cape attached at the shoulders with metal links. The cloth was heavy, a testament to the length that the seamstress unfurled behind him. The fabric was delicate, but it felt like it could stretch the whole length of the great hall. Draco hoped it wouldn’t.
Even the fear that slowly grew on his face was familiar. He'd always been the cowardly sort.
Harry seemed surprised before a smile stretched his face. “Oh, yes please.”
A few notes before we get started:
“I do.”
“Then why bring it up?”
Fuck that.
Draco steeled himself, chin high and back straight. Posture that was immediately undone with the undignified crawl across the duvet to the other side, leaving room for Harry. He didn’t watch the other man get into bed, instead lying stiff and silent, staring up at the canopy unblinking.
Draco breathed out shakily, forcing calm.
But whether he liked it or not, Malfoy had made an impression on him. He was undeniably recognizable as the Malfoy Harry had experienced in school, dignified and pompous when he’d talked down to Harry with such a posh accent. But he’d berated Harry…with a toddler tucked into his neck, effortlessly placed there in such a familiar gesture that made a nerve in Harry’s heart twinge. Even now, after a full day of slogging through work and replaying that picture over and over in his head, Harry couldn’t reconcile the slytherin death eater bully with the man who had so carefully cradled Teddy’s head.
And the whole Teddy situation felt the same. Too big. Hard to control. There wasn't enough calming draught in the world.
Teddy made a face. “Duh. I’m six.”
“Ha!” Kennedy barked. He was a bit too loud and reclined in his seat with his hands behind his head. “I’m sure of that, Harry.”
"Can I help you?" And there was Malfoy, wearing more casual muggle clothes from what he’d been wearing that morning and with a dishrag over his shoulder, but still bearing a startling resemblance to the pointy git who'd been the school bully.
Teddy whimpered and looked up from Malfoy’s shoulder, eyeing Harry with both curiosity and trepidation, his thumb finding it’s way to his mouth. Malfoy’s hand found Teddy’s neck and guided him back to his shoulder.
,” Draco expressed. “Look, that was the knife my friend gave me, okay? From earlier toady? It was a comfort. Nothing more.”
“No!” Teddy squawked. He looked around frantically then picked up the film he’d dropped in his tirade. “It’s because Draco is like Duchess! And the orange cat is in love with Duchess just like how Thomas loves Draco! Doesn’t it make sense?”
to care for, Draco. You’re the one who assumed responsibility, so I don’t know what you want from me.”
Teddy made a sour face, curling into Malfoy’s hip and grabbing at his belt loop. “Is supper almost ready?”
"And?" Harry pressed, a stress headache forming.
"We only just got him crawling." The woman hushed, in deference to the swaddled baby dozing in the ministry's blandly decorated bassinet.
He nodded. "Anyone who was interested."
It wasn't suppose to be this cold this time of the year. The atmosphere around here was a starling contrast to his wing. Dark. He could smell it.
“But as one woman to a young man, you have a right to know what a dirty shit- woo!” Martha exclaims to the sky as she accidentally cussed. “You have a right to know what a dirty piece of man your husband is. Oh, Lord, please do not permit me to swear. I know that Jesus will fix this horrible situation for us.”
“Thank you, mommy.”
“I’ll be back.” Harry says as walks towards the door.
“Take your hands off of me.” Harry said as he sat on the couch.
“Denial is just as bad as sitting in the dark. In fact, the first reaction to catastrophe is denial.”
“You never told her about us, baby? I wonder why?” She says as she walks away from Harry. “I wonder why?”
“I’m sorry, what?”
After shopping I went home thinking if I should confront Draco or should I wait till he is the one to tell me. I thought about it for too long and didn't even notice him come, and dear Merlin he really is cheating on me. He smelled different, due to my enhanced senses. I felt a bile coming from my stomach so I bolted towards the restroom.
“And he’s destroying people’s lives here.”
“I never stole your man. Draco is my husband. You are nothing, you delusional bitch.”
“Afraid? And why should I be afraid of God? He’s always gonna be on my side!”
Lexie took a hit of her cigarette and looked directly at Harry.
Draco didn’t cheat on me, he was being forced by Lucius! Hmmm I heard Lucius inviting a Prince Pendragon-Emrys but he doesn't know it's me. I will definitely come tomorrow and confront Lucius. I laughed at my plans. I went to our bedroom and laid down, I heard the door opened and saw Draco going in slowly.
“Such powers of observation.” Harry says.
“Merry meet to you too Lord..”
At my 3rd month, I proposed to Draco with the Pendragon Engagement Ring. At my 4th month we got married. All of our friends were there and even Lucius was there. I still hate him though. At my 5th month I got coroneted, Draco became my consort. Few people were outraged that I was the one carrying the child and not my consort. I obviously explained that I got pregnant before knowing my position.
“It’s all in the hands and the centre of gravity.” He gripped the broom with his knees and flew a bit closer, moving Harry’s hands again, and then his hips. It took Harry another second to realise he was still talking. “...It’s kind of an internal twist.”
Hermione blinked. “Oh. I see.”
They played a fast-paced Seekers game. Draco wasn’t up to his usual strength but he still had his tricks so it wasn’t boring in the slightest. By the time Harry caught the Snitch he was covered in a thick layer of sweat and dirt. They collapsed next to each other on the grass.
“Honestly? I don’t have a clue. I’m just working it out as I go,” Harry shrugged.
Harry blinked at him.
The next half hour went by in a blur of back-patting and shouting. Before Harry really had time to process what was happening he was pushed onto a stage to take photos with the Cup, and then a microphone was thrust into his hand.
Draco blinked at him again but before he could reply the mediwitch  turned back to them. “You should stay, Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy needs someone to keep him company until the potions begin to kick in, and I’m sure he’d rather it be you than me. I’m no good with all that Quidditch talk.”
“Yeah, of course, but hold on—” Ron began to say something but Harry didn't wait around to hear what it was, just turned and headed out the door.
The table was high enough that Harry could see them dancing. In fact, he couldn’t tear his eyes away. Draco moved with the same grace he did on the pitch, except that he was pressed up against Camille, who seemed to be just as graceful. They moved together, her face against his neck, his arm around her waist. It felt voyeuristic to watch but Harry couldn’t help it.
Malfoy looked at him blankly, eyebrows raised, but reached out for Harry’s hand nevertheless. “Potter.”
“Is that a question?”
Malfoy shrugged. “Or are you just up late?”
“You’re drunk.” He couldn’t help but laugh, genuinely this time.
Those photographs swam around his head alongside the new image of the dark-haired man leaning into Malfoy’s personal space. They became a confusing tangle, and Harry decided to head back to the hotel as he was feeling a bit nauseous. It must have been that last drink, he rationalised. It was quite strong, after all.
“Oh, for the love of…” Harry muttered and then stopped himself again and forced a smile. “I’m just resting.”
In the kitchen, Mrs Weasley seemed to be trying to flip an enormous round pan onto a wooden board.
Harry felt himself inexplicably moving closer rather than further away, and it must have taken Malfoy by surprise because his lips parted but nothing came out. Too late Harry realised that he was looking at Malfoy’s mouth, and when their eyes met again there was something in Malfoy’s that made a bolt of terror shoot through Harry.
Harry didn’t really have a response to that.
Malfoy blinked. “Oh, right. I see.” There were two tiny spots of pink right at the top of his cheeks.
“Good to see you, Harry,” Benjy was saying, patting him on the shoulder. He turned to Draco and gave him a warm smile. “Thank you for reopening this place, lads. Zoe is very excited to be part of the first class, aren’t you — love?”
Later Harry wouldn’t be able to remember who lent forward first, perhaps it was at the same time, but one minute they were staring into each other’s eyes and the next their lips had met in the middle. It was a small, chaste act but to the two small boys balanced precariously upon the toilet seat, it was the whole world. The bathroom and Hogwarts disappeared around them and Harry could swear he heard thunder and felt lightning. They clutched onto each other, Malfoy’s small, cold hand resting on Harry’s burning cheek, light and dark, like two halves of a whole.
“Oh my god,” Harry cut him off. He felt like he could possibly pass away from embarrassment at any moment. The worst part was it wasn’t not working for him. “Please stop.”
They switched positions with no small amount of difficulty but eventually Harry was situated between Draco’s legs. He watched his face carefully as he licked a long stripe up Draco’s dick, and was rewarded with a moan that gave him the boost of confidence he needed to take the head into his mouth and suck it lightly.
As soon as Harry got back to camp he sent Pansy Parkinson a letter. He didn’t necessarily expect a reply but he needed to at least try. To distract himself from the stress of waiting for a response he went for a practice fly, which kept him busy until sunset.
“Davies, can you tell them to cut it out?” McLaggen yelled as he dodged a particularly vicious Bludger from O'Flaherty. The captain turned from where he was showing reserve Chaser and Beater Delila Matthews and Peregrine Derrick a tricky move he’d been developing, and rolled his eyes.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fuck off, it’s not like that at all. But anyway, that’s not the point.”
“Why not?”
“Harry?” Angelina sounded a little worried now.
“I see,” he replied. “Was it out of line because it was inaccurate?”
“Make me a cup of tea, would you?” Draco asked over his shoulder as he went to sit down at the table.
“What?” Harry was starting to get a bit annoyed by this whole thing, and his nose was getting awfully cold.
Benjy studied Harry’s face carefully, and then sat back in his chair and took a sip of his drink. “Hmm.” He looked thoughtful. “That’s a tough one.”
They could have just been talking, Harry told himself. It wasn’t as if he had actually seen anything. It was stupid to jump to conclusions. Malfoy wasn’t gay. There was no way that Malfoy was gay. For one thing, Malfoy was a pureblood, and while Harry didn’t know much about pureblood culture, he was pretty sure that they frowned upon things like not continuing the bloodline. Besides, Harry had vivid memories of the many, many pictures of Malfoy out and about in France with his tongue down the throat of various gorgeous women that had graced page six of the Prophet.
“Leave some room in there for my stuff,” Harry said, pointing at the wardrobe. Malfoy gave him a look of disbelief.
“I don’t need you to say you’re sorry, I just wanted to tell you that I thought what you said was out of line,” Harry said, forcing himself to look Malfoy in the eye.
“My magic feels different here,” Harry breathed, without even meaning to.
Malfoy wasn’t bending his legs to reach Harry, he realised with some delay. He was looming over him. Harry's pride decided that that just wouldn’t do. He pushed Malfoy off him and pulled them around so that the taller man’s back was now pressed against the wall instead. Harry really hadn’t thought this through, however, because now the ball was very much in his court.
They sat in silence for a few more moments before Ginny spoke again and her voice sounded a bit nervous. “Harry…”
“Just…” Harry paused and reminded himself once again that he was supposed to be trying to be friendly. “It looks nice and er… expensive, but you don’t really need it. You look fine as you are.”
“I think…” Harry scrubbed his hand through his hair. “I think that I need to go back to London.”
Malfoy pretended to pout. “You’re no fun, Golden Boy. All work and no play makes Potter a dull boy.”
Harry felt all the frustration and anger from the game well up again and he had to clench his fist to keep from hitting something. “Of course you have. Come to gloat, I expect?”
Harry blinked at him but didn’t move. “Okay,” he said slowly. “I can stay a bit longer.”
Draco looked back out at the party, it was overwhelming, but in the best way.
“Merlin,” Draco lowered his head onto Harry’s chest again. “That’s so hot.”
Draco turned on him again. “Do you want to know what I think? I think that you felt bad after losing the Cup, you wanted to make yourself feel better, and I was there. You think that the moment you win everything will be fixed, that you’ll feel whole again. But I don’t see how you plan to fit me into that.”
Harry wondered if he should leave them to it, but before he could escape Ginny looked up at him over Hermione’s shoulder. “Oi, you. Get in here, idiot.”
Draco explained that his great aunt had held very progressive views about the rights and powers of house-elf magic, and had insisted that Una and her mother be educated and provided for generously.
In the next picture, she was about thirty years younger, in full Quidditch gear and holding her broom. With her curly, light brown hair, she clearly wasn’t a Malfoy, but there was something about the sparkle in her eye that looked exactly like Draco did when he was winding Harry up.
He was restless nonetheless, dying to go and find him, but he knew that he had to let Draco come to him this time. He was so distracted that he didn’t notice Ron standing directly in front of him until he cleared his throat.
He turned to look at her, confused. “Why?”
Ten minutes later, Harry headed home with a lighter wallet, a tiny silver thing that seemed far too small to be a real phone, and a renewed appreciation for magical modes of communication. When did the Muggle world get so confusing?
He stuck his face directly into the stream of water, eyes closed, and let the rushing sound drown out his thoughts for a moment.
“I fucking love Australia,” Angelina announced from next to Harry as they surveyed the scene.
Harry laughed, warm and deep. It was an unusual role reversal for him to be the one trying to get Draco up in the morning, but even through the sleepiness, he could feel Harry buzzing with excitement. “Come on.” He poked Draco in the ribs. “If you get up I’ll make you a cup of tea.”
“Firstly I’d like to thank the team, the management, the trainers, and the coaches, particularly our head coach Ron Weasley. We would not have made it here without every one of you. To our Captain Davies: thank you for being the leader this team deserved and never wavering in your conviction that we would win.
Harry had the next afternoon off as he wouldn’t be playing for a few days so he decided to do a bit of exploring. The Marvelous Magical Map of Melbourne he picked up from the front desk of the hotel told him that the inner city was set up like a grid with trams going in all directions. The map had a handful of little glowing spots that expanded into descriptions of the magical sites when he tapped his wand against them.
“Of course you do.” Harry actually did laugh then. “That seems like a lot of effort.”
Quidditch was the only thing keeping him from fully losing the plot so he threw himself into it completely, and luckily for him there was a lot of it. He had training every day with the England squad.
“Uh, thanks?” He grinned. “It was a team effort.”
“What if I find out something important? Then maybe we wouldn’t have to use the polyjuice after all,” Harry knew he was pulling at straws a little here.
“Mr Potter,” she drawled. “I heard you were looking for me.”
Harry’s brow furrowed. “Is that why you disappear every time someone finds out about us?”
In frustration Harry lurched to the side without warning, knocking Malfoy hard. He was gratified to hear him make a little huff of surprise. Seekers fighting wasn’t against the rules, so long as they didn’t use their wands, but Harry had always thought of it as dirty play. He was furious that Malfoy had pushed him to it.
“How do you do that?” Harry asked before he could stop himself.
Harry felt a little stung. “I don’t know what you want from me!”
Harry managed to stammer out something resembling an affirmative, and followed him to where he was rooting through the fridge. He pulled out two small blue bottles of gin and summoned some glasses with a flick of his wand, pouring in the gin and a splash of tonic water, before handing it to Harry. He turned and walked out to the balcony. Harry followed again meekly.
They sat in silence for a few minutes before he finally spoke. “Harry, I want to… check on you.”
2005 melted into 2006 without much fanfare. Harry spent most of January and February training and playing, but when March rolled around he suddenly found himself being trotted out for all the pre-World Cup events that he had enjoyed so much the last time around. This time, they felt like a chore. Worse than a chore, actually - he felt actively anxious and overwhelmed by the entire affair.
He would have to see Malfoy because they were playing Slytherin and,
It was so out of character for Draco, whose emotions were never this close to the surface. Before he could think better of it, Harry began stroking Draco’s hand with his, and was rewarded with a soft sigh.
Harry nodded. It did feel like that. Like the rocks and the dirt hummed with something ancient and powerful. The only comparison he could think of was the feeling he had had when he visited Stonehenge with Hermione and Ron, but this felt even older and more powerful. Usually, when he cast he drew from his inner well of power, but here he felt as though he could draw from a blade of grass or a stone in the dirt and feel the same power.
He let out a laugh at that. Potter. Poor little Potter. He let himself feel a touch of sympathy for the git. His life was marked as well, for what the Dark Lord's fascination with him unveiled.
"I'm not here to drench your gruesome unawareness. Why don't you tell me another reason for your tactless judgements."
"I wish for nothing more, my Lord."
How in hell would he
His ming reeled. He felt completely consumed by him. His power. His words. His promises.
She didn't even bat an eye.
Snape's lips twisted funnily before settling into a thin line. "Every hidden thing is not necessarily a secret."
. Those were escapes. He was blessed with a fair dose of luck and could only hope that it won't run out in the inevitably sticky situations to come.
was making him snort. "Why do I dislike him?" He huffed. "Maybe because he insults me and my friends in every named occasion? Or maybe because his Death Eater father is out there planning my murder with that maniac? Or maybe because he's prejudiced, snobbish and an absolute arsehole?" He laughed. "I can go on forever, Snape. For all I know, he could be a Death Eater himself."
Fuck.
He sighed yet again and walked back to his bed. His eyes again darted towards the darkened alley but this time, halted there. The peaceful brightness of the streetlight was blocked by a figure. On closer inspection he caught the outline of a man.
A sudden pang of loss was enough of proof. He opened his eyes, maybe he was in heaven? Or wherever one goes where he feels this free?
Snape fall silent. For a tiny fraction of a tiny second, Harry saw an unusual intensity of pain in his eyes. But he could only guess as it lasted as long as a blink. Was he regretting it?
And to know that the very person who saved him from it was a fucking werewolf himself, didn't settle him.
who wants anything from you. It's not me who wants you to flare your almighty wings and perish all their fears like drenched kittens." He said somewhat calmly. "It's definitely not me who you've filled with wild hope that there's even the slightest possibility of making through this mess. And I thought it was quite obvious that I don't expect you to win."
Snape's eyes widened and then narrowed. He gave Harry a curt nod before following him inside. "I have a few things to discuss with you. Is your room fitting?"
Time stopped for Draco. Breathe knocked out of his lungs and his heart beat accelerated. It seemed to have the same effect on the other occupants of the room. No one spoke, for seconds that seemed to last forever.
"Are you ready for this, Draco? Ready to be taken up by Dark magic, to feel the intensity of the raging  and overwhelming strength I'm about to give you?"
Well,
he was to stay. But he didn't care. Maybe his fatigued legs would steal his attention. Maybe this feeling would go away. Maybe he'd be fine. Maybe all will be well.
"I remember you agreeing to let me finish before throwing your unwanted tantrums." Snape interrupted him.
He saw the werewolf's eyes shift. Still hungry but raged. Draco's stiff legs shook, his senses told him to run away a hide. To scream and scream and scream untill this was all over. And just as Greyback snarled inhumanly and set up to pounce on Bellatrix-
That was before.
Harry snorted. Oh the holy times,
Shape's face was blank, practiced and fake. "Your facial expressions. You aren't even aware of what your face does when you're deep in thought, the rarity as it is. I've never seen anyone of the human race making so many atypical faces in thrice as much time as you did." He said, tilting his head sideways. "It was bouncing from one emotion to another like a peckish monkey. Like really, how do you do that?"
Just a short chapter. I wanted it to be longer, but it's been too long since I've posted and I'm still working my ass off on the next part. So here it is! Hope it's satisfactory, enjoy! 🍁🌼🍁
Snape's eyes widened meaningfully. "Fat words, Potter. I see that you really were bored if you had time to swallow the dictionary."
Snape sighed and took a step towards Harry. His hand reached out to touch Harry's and just as it did and a pitiful jolt of being
Snape seemed to hesitate. The minute stretched on for too long to be comfortable and Harry could feel the sense of unease edging up again. Snape was very unexpected, after all. Very very unexpected, indeed. A single long-lived conversation with the twat- the one that was currently on an awkward pause- was enough to aware Harry of his natural talent for taking a simple non-offensive comment personally.
he was surprised to find it ticking towards midday. It was about nine, when his mother had come to let him know about the later events, and to wish him a happy birthday as well of course.
Change is a part of life, he knew that.
He was waiting for the right moment, yes, but it was too long a wait. Too long for Harry to not feel a tinge of betrayal and cozen. Because Harry hadn't been a child for a long time now. Not since his past few interactions with the fount. Not since his blood had ignited Voldemort with life and not since he felt himself bestowed with his skin and soul.
"That's what I said, yes." Harry nodded. "But I really didn't appreciate you calling my mother names. She was helping you, for Merlin's sake."
It was strange, to say the least. Talking to Snape and not wanting to throttle him. Not every second, that is. It wasn't quite as unpleasant as he would've thought in regards of experience. Generally, they both seemed to avoid the other on principle, as much as one could under the same roof; and when found in each others' company, it always seemed forced and the air charged with mutual dislike.
to please him. To serve him, follow him, guard him.
The sorting hat wasn't flawed in it's decision, he's a Gryffindor to the core.
Harry couldn't comprehend what was that supposed to mean, so he just murmured cautiously, "Uh-huh."
It's confounding, terrifying really, how much can change in mere months.
room.
Harry didn't like it. He didn't like it at all. "Not before you tell me where we're going." He demanded, folding his arms and trying to look stern. And not failing, hopefully.
The same thoughts crowded his mind with vivid images, clouded his eyes with moisture and sometimes his palms with blood from the mere force of his nails digging into his skin unveiling his anger, guilt and remorse. His shoulders felt heavy, dense with the weight of the responsibilities vested upon him. The responsibilities he was too young and too weak to be expected from. But the future was foretold, awaited and demanded even, and he was never the one to back away from escapades.
"Now?" Harry stuttered. He glanced at his clock. "It's half past midnight!"
Harry was perplexed. But more so, enraged. Just a few moments ago they were having a moderately polite conversation, even though the subjects in consideration were highly uninvited. Well suck a fucking dildo, if he was to go along with the man's mood swings! And for Merlin's sake, he didn't even make an honourable insult to deserve such a reaction.
have to scrub the entire house in the morning, so if you don't mind skimping both of our time, I'd like you to come in and state the reasons of your pleasant visit."
exactly do you have such strong feelings about your classmate? Snape raised his eyebrows.
So that's the first chapter. How was it? Bad or worse? Corrections and suggestions are highly welcomed. It'll take time to post another chap though, I'm still working on it. So stick with me, if you like it? And please comment and let me know if you liked it. Hearts and kisses!!
The Dark Lord's cool fingers touched his arm softly, caressing him with rigid, loving power. The Dark Lord whispered a spell, a foreign one that sounded like a song. He felt heavenly. Not a sign or touch of pain, not even a twitch of skin as He caressed his skin with his elegant, beautiful wand. And the he hissed something, like a call, a command and a large, heavy snake entered  his field of vision and he gasped. The snake was beautiful, just like it's Master. It slithered towards in gracefully and stared right into Draco's eyes. Draco smiled at it, naturally.
and making his own wrong choices.
He could do nothing but obey. It felt
Harry blinked and flushed as he realised what the man was implying. "No. I'm sorry. Please come in." He invited him in as politely as he could. But the bastard wasn't done.
When the boys were 10 I got pregnant again. This time with twin girls who looked exactly alike. Aurora was first and Aquila followed. They looked like a mix of both Draco and I. Both girls have blond hair. The only thing that separates them was their eyes. Aurora had blue eyes while Aquila had green eyes. Draco was so happy to have new children.
“Oh Harry please, I'm sorry Father forced me into it. I'm really sorry Harry.”, Draco dropped to his knees and hugged my legs.
Kingsley and the Auror Force knew about the prince so they pushed that I must have auror bodyguards. Kingsley haven't been filled with the news that I'm the prince. Heck even the Weasleys don't know yet so I decided to drop by the Weasleys first before I go to Kingsley.
“I don’t know.” Harry said. “I know that there are people out there who are jealous of what we have achieved together.”
“Well, I thought that you’d be younger, but you probably are around our age but I can’t tell with all that makeup covering the scales on your face.” Harry told Lexie who’s smoking her cigarette. “Why don’t you do like the two guests that were here and just get the fuck out? Just leave!”
“I am Prince Kale Saros Potter-Black, Prince Pendragon and Emrys, Duke of Le Fay, Winterios, Aquanius and Peverell, Earl of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, Lord of Potter, Black, Yaxley, Rowle and Vane. Your father would be sending me 11 invites tomorrow so please just go with it Draco and uhm Draco…”, I answered and decided to tell Draco of the good news.
“Then if she was a heiress so what's your title now?”, Draco asked.
Martha stares back at him before Draco turns to Harry.
Lexie yelps in pain, she tried to stand up and hit Harry one more time but she didn’t see that he was holding something. Harry was now holding his wand, he sent an Incarcerous at the woman who was then tied down on all fours.
Both Martha and Robbie look at him like they are over him, while Harry is wondering what is happening in his life.
Harry nods and walks towards Martha.
“Even if you're a prince Potter you are still a half-blood”, Lucius sneered, other purebloods snickered. I laughed loudly at them.
“You are stupid aren’t you? Now let us see if you will have a child.” Harry took a gun that they bought to threaten muggles from the hidden compartment from the sofa.
At the end of my pregnancy everyone met Alaric Rigel, Azazel Freydd, and Aries Sevirr. The looked exactly like Draco but with my eyes. I was so happy with my life, I know that if Mom, Dad, Siri and Remus were here they would be happy.
I dropped exactly three drops of blood before casting
“What the hell is going on in this house today?” Harry asks as Draco pulls away from him.
“Aaaahh.” Harry sighs as they dance together. “I can totally feel it in my hips.”
It was quiet for a moment as Harry was looking at the evidence, contemplating what to do with it.
A pasty skin woman with brown hair struts into the living room with Draco rushing after her.
Harry looks into his eyes.
“Who are these people?” Draco asks. “And why the fuck are they here?”
The past 6 years were some of the greatest years of my life. After the war we had so many funerals and memorials that it was tiring but in those six years I also found love. I currently live in Grimmauld with Draco, yes you read that right. I am with Draco Lucius Malfoy for three years now. I attended their trials and saved them from their fate. We dated for a year before I gave him my answer which was of course a yes.
Hermione and Ron got married and had two offsprings. Rose and Hugo. Viktor came back from Bulgaria and got married to Percy Weasley, their marriage gave them two lovely kids, Frederick and Zarrick. Theodore Nott got married to Charlie Weasley after a year of Theodore's courting. Everything was great and I never regretted anything about having this life with Draco.
The test was finally done. I am so happy that it showed me that Draco's my soulmate! I always ask him about marriage and he always talk me out of it but maybe now he will talk about it now that we are soulmates.
Harry’s mouth drops.
“Prince Kale this is my son Draco and his fiancé Astoria Greengrass.”, Lucius said.
“Come on, babe. Just leave them.”
“I am Lord Florian Greengrass of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Greengrass.”, he said while puffing his chest.
Harry smiles at this.
“What do you mean Harry?”
“I know.”, I replied making Draco look at me with wide teary eyes.
Fernir Greyback.
"And I'll be taking little Draco room, here. Oh, how I fell for the bed, my Lord. Salazar, it's so comfy! And let it be said that I won't take no for an ans-"
"So, what do you say?" Snape urged.
To Harry's relief, Snape just sighed. "He did want me to tell you something, yes." He blinked much less than required, Harry noticed in mute horror. "But he wouldn't mind of if I add a few more words myself now, would he?"
He asked slowly, aware that his eyebrows have already crossed the boundaries of his forehead. Snape rolled his eyes.
, even a few Slytherins worship you. Your fat eyes have failed to ever notice."
. And he'll welcome all the help he could receive to do so. He blinked back tears and took a deep breath.
Harry searched his eyes for signs of mocking and burst out laughing when he couldn't find any. "Are you serious?" He managed to let out.
, he needed no clarification of who he was.
"What?" Harry choked out. That was not even the very last thing on his mind. That ferret hasn't even crossed his mind over the previous weeks, and quite unsurprisingly.
. She had said.
to follow and someone to blame when everything goes down to hell.
Harry sighed. He wasn't resentful towards Dumbledore, not really. He understood that Dumbledore couldn't have just called him out to have a chat with an eleven year about his certain death over a cup of tea. Not when the said eleven year old was having the best time of his life.
"Tell me Potter, do you have any friends from other houses?" Surprised at that sudden change of subject, he answered.
He furrowed his brows, repeating the sentence mentally. "So you want me to keep
It was just his wonderful luck, that the 'someone' happens to be one Harry James Potter.
At Harry's reluctance, Snape shook his head exasperatedly. "We're apparating." He said in a matter-of-fact voice that Harry decided he didn't like at all. "But of course, you don't know what that is." He continued. "Just come on now and I'll try not to insult you."
he was.
Alluring.
At the same time, the fact that Snape wasn't relying on him to save everyone, was oddly reassuring. That there was someone in the least, who saw him as he is - a child.
So ugly and so enchanting. So dark and so bright. He could look at the face forever, he'd do anything,
Staring out at the darkened street from the corner of his bedroom window, Harry Potter was lost in thought.
"I think you've said enough for me to decide that I'm not interested in your offer. I'd like to avoid him if I can help it and you're asking me to

He'd do anything for her. Even the remotely significant word his mother utters cannot be groundless.
(See the end of the chapter for
Snape's lips settled to form a thin line. "Not really." He said smoothly. "That was merely an unsuccessful attempt at courtesy." He looked around his room and approved; a chiseled lie it was. "Well, that's more like it."
"I need to go." He blurted out. Everyone startled as he spoke up.
"Well well, isn't it my little nephew." He heard a high pitched voice mutter, too loud in the quiet.
"Oh are there a lot of other Malfoys attending Hogwarts whom your expecting to meet?" Harry ignored him.
Harry narrowed his eyes. He couldn't help feeling a bit testy at the prospect of
"Uh, no startling difference as you're here anyway. But really, did he?"
But, facts hold a significant place in the area of observation and it was plain as a bloody day that Harry didn't like Slytherins. Almost as much as the other way around. But his dislike was justified as the only Slytherins he knew were far from being the light of his life. They were known to be arrogant, vile, self-absorbed and overall stinkers and he couldn't find a single incentive for not believing so.
He has a thing for saving people, Hermione had said. He laughed bitterly at that. He was not very good at it, was he? Sirius indeed was a better man than he was. And the fact the he
That definitely surprised Harry. There were Muggle borns in Slytherin?
Harry's eyes snapped open. The words were spoke so quickly that Harry had to blink a few times to make sure he wasn't just imagining them. But Snape was no longer looking at him, staring at the floor quite intensely.
"Well?" He said irritatedly when Snape remained silent. He was getting rather frustrated. Neither of them were fans of the the other, so why wouldn't the snob just blurt it out and leave him the fuck alone?
It was obvious that it pained his professor to drop his bloated ego and admit what he did, but the fact that he went out of his way to reassure Harry, brought a smile on his face. That yes, the expectations about his win were about as low as it could possibly get, but they weren't at least, non-existent. The group of people he was worrying about a few moments ago,

He felt dazed. Scared and lonely. Hurt and disturbed. Uncertain and terrified. But along with the dread; a foreign, exotic,
He felt inevitable.
His room. Gone.
If a bunch of people worshipped him, among them were ones who saw him as a nobody, an insignificant teenager pinning for spotlight. Even when the spotlight was a result of his parents' murder and an ugly scar on his forehead.
. This was where he belonged, he always have. "I believe your heart is as pure as your blood, Malfoy. Furnished with love for the right people and detest for the damned, is it not?" The Dark Lord's voice rang bells on his mind and soul. He could feel the power radiating from him.
Snape gazed over his shoulder, inside the house and again back at him. "Is there someone at the corridor?"
. But it didn't hurt anymore.
Her eyes followed his frame. He stiffened under her scrutiny, uncomfortable and revolted. He swallowed audibly, struggling with words. "It-It's nice to finally meet you. Did you just arrive?" Her eyes snapped to his, twinkling with evil mischief. "Uh-huh." She said, teetering her  eyes that were transfixed on his bed, pinning and ravenous.
that it rendered Draco lost, frightened and so so alone, he wept. A ringing silence followed his wails and the beat of his heart was loud and harsh and vexing.
Huh. Harry was out of words. He wisely kept his mouth shut.
Being kept in the dark for so long, Harry wasn't keen of 'knowing' a secret anymore than 'unknowing' it. But the idea of not telling Dumbledore about something, something that seemed important, was alarmingly, wickedly tempting.
"What's your problem? What did I even say to blow up your snotty fuse?"
hopes on. To guide him, reassure him. But a little was always too much to ask from him.
Before you say it, I know Draco birthday is in April. I just realized it much later and I feel terrible. But, let's just ignore that, yeah? Please? Sorry? It's a AU after all. 🙂
Snape stood up, brushing off his cloak. "Now, if you please."
Lucius opened the door. A fresh scent of magic hit his senses. He didn't know if one could
"Your soul is dark. Future, bright. You're able, my boy. Much more than your father. You realise that, don't you?"
His eyes landed on the Mark. Bright and ugly and dark and pained. Blood fell gracefully from the point where the Dark Lord's snake have bitten him. It shone, dark but bright. It felt
Snape's eyes twinkled wickedly. "Oh yes of course, your inapt choice of words. Another acquired trait evidently."
have to say about your moonshine sentiments about Gryffindors?" Harry said pointedly, folding his arms.
Harry gasped. Surprised and too shocked to move a muscle, he stared at the familiar face as he moved over and was now standing just behind the front door of the house. He blinked a few times and shook his head to clear the vision, but the man still stood at the same spot, waiting patiently. But knowing the man and that it was far too dangerous to test his patience, Harry jumped out of his bed a rushed out. He walked down the stairs carefully to not wake his kind-at-heart relatives from their snooze and opened the door.
But what he
Dumbledore had known about the prophecy, about Harry's goddamned

Her profile left no doubt about her identity. Not because he's seen her pictures a number of times before, but because she looked the very way she was chronicled.
It took him a may moment to sink the words in. When they did, Harry blanched. "You want me to keep secrets from Dumbledore?"
"Tomorrow?" He murmured. A little forewarning is always nice, and people always refused him
on his side and they too would be pleasantly surprised to see Harry doing his best to live up to the expectations. And if supposedly Harry won, they won't curse, but bless him.
. His father's words surrounded him. Along came his mother's, sweet but stern, reminding him of his position, his loyalty, his obligation, his
Snape's eyes flared. "A professor. And I'd like to be addressed like one." He glared at him, suddenly furious.
"Okay." He said. A bit too sadly to be convincing. But this was the right thing to do, he knew. Snape had given him something to think about. He'd almost forgot about-
was keeping Harry in the dark and unaware of something he deserved to know. Something as important as his life, which seemed to be none of his concern.
Or maybe he'll die.
Snape widened his eyes, clearly not believing his ears. He eyed Harry for three long seconds before looking away, which had Harry fidgeting his hands. "You're sorry." He repeated.
"I'm sure my Draco will not disappoint. I'll guide him."
for long enough to be forgotten by some, but did he utter a word? No. Did he mention anything that may have suggested Harry's ill fate so that he could have started up on his bucket list? No? No.
The clear sound of a throat being cleared brought him back to the present. He looked up to see Snape's eyes on him. Looking almost bored, but a treacherous bit of amusement flickering his eyes. "You have quite the talent, haven't you?"
Snape narrowed his eyes. "And the inverse includes all the students from Slytherin." He said, deadpan. "Even the ones who came to me with complaints about her bunk practices. Even the ones who acknowledged her evident incompetence. And even the ones who genuinely wanted to learn something, isn't that right?"
Huh. Isn't it?
He was young enough to be appalled at the thought of quietus, sure, but old enough to except it. Easily enough, after brushing past it more times than he'd like to admit.
"I understand." He said lowly. "But, why me, though? Wouldn't it be better if you talk to them about this?"
He murmured. Snape stared at him, without blinking. The creep. He seemed to be at loss of words, for which Harry was surprised. But also, glad. They both needed a few seconds of silence before taking up on their strangely electric conversation. Harry had always wanted to apologize to Snape for his intrusion that night, but the time, place nor the words would have been right.
feeling surfaced.
And then, it was over.
"Forgive me for intruding, my Lord." His mother's voice jerked him to awareness. So bland. "But you said you have a task for my Draco?"
"May I ask
Harry stared at him. Snape's words were frank and sure. True and hid no possibilities of his inner motives about safeguarding Harry's modesty. What he didn't expect, was for them to be hurtful. Of course Snape didn't believe in him.
HARRY POTTER : THE CHOSEN ONE?
Draco was shuddering. He replayed his earlier exchange with his mother for what seemed like the thousandth time, which struck him with precisely the same potency as it did at the earliest. Blinking furiously, he closed his eyes and inspired, keen and deep.
Severus Snape's lips curled lightly as he spoke, "It's lovely to see you too, Mr. Potter." His voice betrayed his words. "Please excuse the late hour, did I disturb your slumber?"
The Manor had dark areas too, he wasn't allowed there.
Snape narrowed his eyes, his eyebrows came together to form an elegant 'V' and lips thinned dangerously that warned Harry about the tirade he was about to receive. "It's not
The others crossed his wing and descended the stairs with faint steps while Bellatrix jumped two steps at a time. The act was more savage than childish. They halted behind the staircase and Bellatrix asked him haughtily, "Can you apparate, dear boy?"
Draco's heard about it. The mission. Bits and pieces of information by eavesdropping on his parent's conversations. No one even bothered to tell him what it was about. What changed, how and why.
She squealed gleefully, sighing in contentment and sweet-mother-of-Merlin,
Harry turned to speak but Snape interrupted him. "And you ought to be quick, you'll have to pack once you get back. Dumbledore will be collecting you tomorrow."
He turned towards the voice and allowed himself to relax a tad.
A haughty, tall women dressed in dirty dark robes stood at the head of the door. She wore a strangely electric smile, beaming in a way, one could only describe as unappealing. He turned towards the voice, a certain guess on his lips, "Aunt Bellatrix?"
She laughed. "The one and only." She moved closer, parodying a predator. "You're certainly older than I imagined, little boy. Cissy breeds well."
"You have a lovely room." Snape commented somewhat awkwardly. Harry's eyes widened. Why the greasy git trying to be polite? He was pulling off a rather disturbing performance.
“That reminds me - are we still on to watch the Magpies play the Cannon this arvo?” Ron asked over his shoulder. Despite being employed by Puddlemere United, he was still a dyed in the wool Chudley Cannons supporter.
“Wow, Ron.” Harry couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face. “That’s fantastic.”
Benjy had been Harry’s mentor when he’d first been recruited to Puddlemere, as he had been their Seeker for nearly twenty years. He was about Harry’s height and build with a wide, friendly face, dark brown skin, and tight curls that were growing increasingly salt-and-pepper as he got further into his forties. He had retired a year before the 2002 World Cup and recommended Harry as his replacement for England. It had been one of the proudest moments of Harry’s life. Benjy’s opinion meant everything to him, which perhaps explained why Harry had been avoiding his calls for the past year.
“Shit,” he mumbled.
She gave him a withering look. “Don’t pander, Harry. It's unbecoming.” His smile wavered only slightly. “I just came over to tell you that I could see your disturbing lack of cufflinks from across the room. Go and put them on this instant.”
“No, don’t worry.” He gave her what he hoped was a normal smile. “I won’t say anything at all.”
On the plus side, his normal post-booze shame was totally eclipsed by the panic that swelled in him when he remembered the way that he had left things with Malfoy. If he had been capable of it he would have buried his face in his pillow, but as it was he made do by squeezing his eyes shut.
“You spend all your spare time holed up in the hotel room like a shut-in. It’s strange,” Malfoy said bluntly.
Harry looked up and found Viktor Krum’s handsome face staring back at him, looking about as shocked as Harry felt.
In the kitchen, Ron and Mrs Weasley were having some kind of battle over the cake while Mr Weasley tried to get between them.
“Fucking hell, Gin, you can’t just ask me things like that!” he coughed, laughing in spite of himself.
Harry didn’t really have an answer for that. He was starting to feel more than a little bit guilty. “I hadn’t really thought about it like that.”
and amongst many Quidditch commentators, but, as Davies said, they’d proved them all wrong: they’d won the 2004 British and Irish League Cup and the respect of the Quidditch community.
Malfoy huffed out a tiny breath he had obviously been holding, and the motion drew Harry’s eyes to the other boy’s lips. Harry felt something flip in his stomach that he’d never experienced before, like a monarch butterfly fluttering its wings for the first time as it emerges from the chrysalis. The feeling made his head swim and his mouth dry, and he felt more than a little bit faint. His eyes flicked back to Malfoy’s and somehow he knew, he just knew, that Malfoy’s veins were thrumming with the same electricity. He tightened his grip on Malfoy’s robes.
Harry thanked him and watched him wander away, head down.
“You’re a real git you know that Malfoy,” He hissed.
Harry nodded miserably.
Part of him wanted to confront him, but about what? He couldn’t very well accuse Malfoy of sexually confusing him. It was impossible, really, and thinking about it made Harry’s head ache.
“Among other things.” Malfoy smirked just a little bit.
He made his way over to where she was sitting at a wooden table, and then screeched to a stop when he caught sight of who was sitting across from her.
Harry patted him on the shoulder in a manner he hoped was comforting. “You’ll be okay, mate. Just say the right name and that.”
He spent so long in the gallery that by the time he had returned to his rooms the sun had set and the lamps in his room had been lit. He found a tray with some hearty stew and thick cut bread slathered in butter on the table in the corner of the room and wolfed it down gratefully before collapsing into bed. His last thought was how much he preferred the sound of the wind howling around the castle to the sound of London traffic.
"You haven't even taught your son to apparate, Lucius? How useless can someone ge-" Her words were cut off as he felt the pull of apparation stuffing him. He closed his eyes at the sensation and when opened them, he found himself standing in front of his parent's bedroom.
Snape narrowed his eyes again. "You're aware, that not all purebloods end up in Slytherin, aren't you? And also that they're not all from such a household?"
Draco didn't need to be told twice, he stood up and turned to leave. His mother cleared her throat pointedly. He quickly uttered and 'Thank you, my Lord' and rushed out.
"You feel the power I possess. And you want it too. You need it as much a I did when I was young boy like yourself. You can sense it flowing in my veins, my stance, my soul. And you crave it." It wasn't a question, so he didn't replied.
Harry's eyes widened. 'Pitiful' described the idiots perfectly, but never did he thought he'd hear Snape of all people using the word for his snakes. Snape rolled his eyes.
"If we're clear about that, shall we move to the next matter?"
Too bad you're a disgrace." She concluded offhandedly. Draco waited for his father to come up with a smart retort, to shut her up and show her who was in charge, who's roof she was splitting under. But Lucius looked resigned, like he accepted her accusations.
He stared unblinkingly at the horrid man that stood at his door, lips curling in a way that made him look hungry.
"I do. I am on good terms with a handful of people from other houses. Everyone was welcomed in the D.A, you know, where we used to practice defense last year? Some of us are quite close, I'll say."
His father's eyes flashed angrily. "You too were a part of it Bellatrix, no need to feign innocence."
I believe I said I'll post this chapter a 𝘭𝘰𝘵 sooner than I actually did. Well I lied (unintentionally of course!) And I'm sorry. REALLY. I got caught up in my exams and well..yk. Sorryy. But at last, the chapter's here! So enjoyyy!🖤
He snorted. As if he expected to be gleeful and all jolly-jolly after their talk.
He shivered involuntarily just as his father took hold of his arm. They locked eyes and an unbearable sense of unease filled his veins. Father nodded and Draco nodded back.
"Oh Lucius!" Bellatrix squealed and attack him with a bear hug. He saw his father stiffen and not quite returning the hug. "How are you doing, Lucius? I believe I haven't seen you since...since you horribly failed in your mission?"
Snape's almost amused look dropped and he eyed Harry sternly. "What difference does it make if he did or didn't?"
engulfed him, he heard Snape's soft murmur, "Godric's Hollow."
that.
"Will you shut up about my father already! I know he wasn't-" He took a deep breath, as fluttering images of Snape's worst memory rushed through his mind.
Draco's eyes rolled back. The feeling was so strange and so foreign, he stirred. He awaited pain, a sense of unease that didn't come. What he felt was cold, viscous blood flowing his veins. Filling his body with rage, dread and elation. So many emotions surfaced up that he wanted to cry. And he was happy. More than he's ever been. More than he'll ever be.
"Albus Dumbledore." He whispered angrily. "The old cunt is still hovering above my head. Behind the mask of goodness, he craves my power. His want is invisible, terribly so, but I see it. I know him."
He felt his legs take him towards it. Anticipation, as strong as dread. He was  scared, he realized and electrified. Feverish and intoxicated. He wanted to turn back and run away, and he also really really wanted to feel the power residing there. He
Harry smiled sweetly. "Just answer the bloody question."
Harry snorted. "If I'm judgemental, what do you call yourself then?"
want from him? It was when he raised his gorilla eyebrows that Harry realised he's spoken aloud.
the Chosen One? And it's you lot who have to work together. Trust is hard to earn, even harder with history like yours. But you'd be surprised at the amount of faith they put in you. And before you ask,
"Oh no need to look all surprised, Potter. I'm not going to overlook the obvious just because I'm privileged to have them in my house. I won't judge on those grounds, unlike some people." He eyed Harry with critical eyes.
He gulped a large heap of air. He didn't let his intellect to wander in that direction and blinked back the previous thoughts.
It lasted. The pain, it always does. Long enough to wreck him, but not enough to kill him. Pity. The pain faded to a dull ache and only then, he heard the voice again.
Harry groaned. The newly found confidence about a possible victory, gracefully slipped into annoyance. What more could Snape
it to him."
It didn't smile back but tilted it's head slightly in acknowledgement. With a nod to it's Master, the snake pressed it's fangs to his arm.
It was revolting.
"I'm sorry for…that I looked through your memories that night. That was - that wasn't right. It was disrespectful, rude and wrong. I of all people know what it's like to be denied privacy, but I still - umm, I'm just really really sorry, I hope you know that." He said firmly, though feeling extremely uneasy.
Malfoy shrugged. "It was easier for me to walk around with him. I didn't want people accosting me when I was carrying a baby, as you can imagine."
Teddy snapped his fingers as example and squeaked as foamy toothpaste began to drip down his neck. Draco handed him a towel.
, and even though it confused him and made him uncomfortable and even made his stomach clench if he thought about how it came to be, it was still good. He was still lucky to have discovered such a…
“This is very good.” He finally spoke, leaping onto the only subject he felt was safe.
like he'd cared, but sitting alone in his cell knowing his mother was in much the same position while his father was dead made him re-evaluate that. Draco was starting to understand that he'd never understood what
“There there.” The woman shushed, gently brushing his cheek. Teddy looked at Draco beseeching, as if vying for a rescue.
It was like Harry had been holding up the sky his entire life, straining under it but never letting go because it would hurt the one's he loves. Then someone had gently informed him it was alright, they would be fine, he can let go now. So he had, and that had been the relief, but then the sky had fallen down and clung to him like a film. Heavy and hot, it restricted him but also made him want to curl up with it, like a heavy blanket in midwinter.
“Um…” he started, then shook his head. White sheets were used on Malfoy wedding nights in order to gather the evidence of consummation, but it had been generations since the last same-sex marriage occurred. Maybe…no one bled when it was two men?
“Are you
"You know, stunning you wasn't an idle threat. You're not exactly my favourite fucking person at the moment, Malfoy."
“Whoever I married would never have been part of my ‘personal life’ and you know it.”
Teddy’s mouth dropped open, jaw hitting the floor as he clutched Malfoy’s pants. He gathered himself impressively for his age, but shifted on his feet, looking back between Malfoy and Harry. Malfoy had completely turned away from them, busying himself with the food on the counter.
“Uh,” Harry sat down and Teddy immediately tucked in. “What’s the occasion?”
The point was that there was no ill-will. They had found a seat at the table and new connections could be forged.
Ron cackled. “I’m just saying! If you ever need a back-up army look no further than the peasant women. I daresay all of them would gladly give up their lives just to hear you speak.”
Draco’s foot almost stepped on Potter’s cape but he caught himself just in time, his heart rate picking up at the close blunder.
There were funerals, memorials, tributes, awards, charities, and all sorts of functions post-war. Every day Harry would wake up and already have a million things to accomplish. He had to be there for the Weasleys when they finally buried Fred, not letting himself think about the affair beyond what he needed to do to get Ron back on his feet. He had to be there when Hermione took the obliviate off of her parents, which had not gone over very well. He'd had to be there at Lupin and Tonks' funeral, buried together just like his parents had been, Teddy wailing out in Andromeda's arms even though there was no way he could understand the impact of the ceremony.
