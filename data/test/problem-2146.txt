Dumbledore raised his hands for attention as people calmed down. His cheerful yet strong voice rose.
“Merlin sake, Harry! You were sending me signals constantly when you were staying at our house. But fine, keep your silly fling with the ferret! Just don’t come crying back when you’re alone again.” She snarled before storming off.
Laughing, Harry told her how the closest thing to a snowball fight he had ever tried was when his cousin and his friends were chasing him and throwing muddy snow at his face.
“Really?” Harry was rather surprised. This was the first time he had ever heard a story similar to his own. The general idea of the sorting hat was how you were divided by whatever qualities and abilities he saw in you. But Harry, and apparently also Sandra, had asked him for something specific, for Harry to be placed anywhere but Slytherin and Sandra to follow her brother.
Luna nodded understandingly. “Yes, I can only imagine how hard it must be to keep your temper while thunderflies are laying eggs on your shoulder.” She said completely serious. “Tell him to scrub with pomegranate seeds next time he takes a shower. It will really help his balance.”
“Severus?” A gentle voice irrupted in the otherwise quiet living room. Quickly removing his hand from his arm, he pulled the sleeve a little further down before answering the floo. Albus’ face shone brightly in the kindles from the last burning coal. “I wish to discuss something of rather important news. May I come through?”
The day of the final exam in Defence Against Dark Arts had arrived. They had already taken the written exam so there was only the oral exam left. Seventh year students were gathered outside in the steaming hallway, waiting for their name to be called forth. Dean and Seamus had already been up, both more than happy to receive two E’s. Hermione was inside the stuffy rom right now and nothing could be heard from within.
“Sure.” He reached out and Harry slowly handed him the package. The students around them had almost all boarded and whistle blew for the first time. Saying goodbye, the dark haired boy got on the train.
Malfoy as well, continued to take part in his dream. In it, Malfoy had certainly seemed like a guy he could be dating. Harry had had a hard time looking past how much of a prat the boy was, so it had never really been a question, but he definitely wasn’t blind either. He understood why so many of the girls – Gryffindors and others – thought of him as ‘attractive’.
In a way it had worked. The moment Draco realized his father wouldn’t cuddle or spoil him when he was crying, he dried his cheeks and started arguing instead. His father believed it was better to have an argument to push people into doing what you demanded, rather than get it through empathy and pathos.
Even though Harry knew now that he had been hit in the head, it seemed rather odd to see a blob of orange in the corner of his eye. Blinking a few times, he tried to get used to the blurry masses.
Surprised but none the less very happy at the revelation, Jason kissed him again at the top of his hair. Breathing in the soothing smell of wood, spices and cold air, he continued to kiss his way down his face. Kissing slowly down the side of his head, to the ear where he gently bit the top, to his warm cheek. Blaise had kept composed and had been breathing very deeply. To Jason it had sounded very forced but he loved the fact that Blaise was so strictly holding himself together. It was only so much more fun, watching him crumble underneath his administrations.
Looking at himself in the mirror, you could barely tell he was tired. The cheering potion and concealing charm had worked wonders on his skin. Although he still felt like crap, it wasn’t exactly a new feeling. He straightened his tie on the horrible tuxedo, Pansy had insisted he wore. Why the pureblood circle had adopted this as the newest fashion, he would never know. It was quite uncomfortable and restricting as he kept pulling on his wrist cuffs.
Getting closer he made a quick decision. He had only one piece left of Lauris whom had given him another chance to make up for everything he had done wrong. Lauris had forgiven him his cowardness and sent him his own son to find him.
Harry eat, slowly. He wasn’t really that hungry to begin with. He had had a lot to think about the last couple of months and tonight he felt the unpleasant darkness in his heart that arrived with loneliness. He wasn’t alone, deep down, he knew that. Harry had many friends and people he felt close to, but when it was just one certain person you wanted to speak to, others seemed to pale in comparison. He gulped down the last bite with some water and told the others he was going back to the common room. The gang nodded absently and turned back to their conversation.
“Isn’t it just a little too coincidental that You-know-who is gone and suddenly this Jason guy appear out of nowhere?” Ron leaned back smugly.
At the end of last class, the gang waited for Luna to join at the entrance. The four boys had grabbed all their warm clothing, gloves and hats, making sure they could stay outside without freezing to death. Between all the students wandering around, Harry could finally see a platinum blonde head poking up. He waved a hand waiting for her to get close enough to notice.
“I… should go? Outside.”  The second he finished his sentence, the owl took off, flying out the back window once more.
The students had as always assembled in front of the main gate, where Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra were waiting for them. Harry shot longing glances at the small snowcovered cabin, where smoke was raising from the chimney.
“I know, Potter, but you will.” About to protest the professor silenced him with a glare. “I understand your predicament, but right now the best thing you can do is pretend everything is as it should. The more suspicious you behave the easier the gossip will fly amongst your peers.”
Then a third joined the party and Harry had trouble remembering how to breathe. He felt full. He certainly couldn’t reach that far on his own. Then Draco hit his prostate.
“My boy, the day parents stop meddling in their children’s life is the day they die.” He stuffed his mouth with a second cookie.
Almost wishing he had had homework, Harry had spent the days worrying about Draco. They had been going out for what he considered a while now, and he had yet to bring up either Christmas presents or wither they should go to the dance together. Harry wanted to ask him, really, but he was terrified of pushing Draco’s limits. He wanted to move at a pace they were both comfortable with and going to a dance together officially, could be something his parents would not find pleasing.
The fingers moved back up and circled his opening once more, before entering it slowly but firm. It was rather painful and even the pleasure of being touched couldn’t distract him from the burn. Panting, Harry tried to focus on the feeling of Draco behind him. Listening to the noises he made. He could hear the deep sighs and by the way Draco was dipping the bed every other second, Harry knew he was getting impatient.
“Your eyes-“ Harry quickly stopped himself from blurting out. Feeling the blood rush to his cheeks, he felt grateful when the Australian boy just laughed heartfully.
“But he did start-“ Harry tried weakly to defend the boy whom had become a good friend to him. He really didn’t wish to say Draco deserved the cuts he got for it, but Jason was the kind of person who would beat himself in the head with it for a long time.
Nodding defeated, Harry went for the door. Still hoping to change the man’s mind, he gave it a last shot before leaving.
. Thanking the professor for letting him stay, Harry tried to ignore the horrifying dread upsetting his stomach.
“Mr. Potter, I have recently discovered a few ingredients from my private storage have gone missing. You wouldn’t happen to know what had happened to them, would you?”
“Yes, I suppose I did.” Luna agreed lightly as she unpacked her own school stuff. “But I don’t have a lot of friends in my own year, so I have plenty of time for studying.”
The students were even more a bunch of dunderheads than usual. They had clearly left whatever small part of their functioning brains outside the classroom, as most of their limited concentration seemed to be centered around Christmas vacation. This did not in any way affect Snape’s work moral, oh contraire. Instead, it made him work even harder to pound whatever small amount of information and learning he could into the youngsters.
“But you’re not in love with me, Draco.” Pansy finally looked at him. “And I deserve to be with someone who is.”
The teen in front of him froze before turning in his direction. As their eyes caught, the bronze boy smiled at him.  “Ready for lunch?” The tan boy smiled.
Knott didn’t retort, but simply raised his eyebrows and smirked, getting back to his breakfast. Hoping the annoying banter was over, Draco was about to continue his own eating.
Behind him, he could hear the clear sound of heels on the floor, but he didn’t bother to turn around and ask why Snape was following him.
At the end of class, students were sweating from head to toe and spent the rest of the day picking out thorns from their clothing. The Ravenclaws, who weren’t exactly the type whom enjoyed exercising, seemed very unpleasant and tense for the remaining day. Harry didn’t just feel physically tired, but mentally as well, after a rather lived discussion with his friends. Waving goodbye, he headed for the library. Hermione offered to join but he declined. He would rather be alone for a while. Walking past students and the great hall, he left his two classmates behind.
He took another bite out of his toast when he heard a screech. A smaller grey owl landed next to the jam and stretched out its leg for him to take the giant package wrapped around it. It almost looked comical how small the owl was compared to the gift but as Harry removed it from the animal, he noticed it was rather light. The second he had removed it the package became heavy in his hands. The gift must have had a feather charm placed before the owl had taken off.
Severus took a deep breath before confirming the Headmaster’s theory. He told the Headmaster shortly, without too many details of his relationship with Jason’s father. However short-lasted, he had truly come to care for the man.
“Well guess what, Parkinson! We made a deal! It’s not my problem how you sort out your own ones. Me and Potter have nothing to with you, all you how to do is sit back and enjoy the show!” His voice changed to a mocking stance as he gave a bow as if he finished a theatre performance.
“You know… people just make a big deal out of going together…. All the couply-stuff and I thought we should, you know, try to catch a dance at some point.”
“There!” She pointed to a rather down lit shop. The insignificant tree sign outside showed the letters; “Well-dressed Wizardry.” If Harry squinted, he could almost make out a little purple dress painted underneath.
“I’m really excited this year! My grandma’s cousin Laverne have just married some rich guy in Oklahoma and we’ve been invited to celebrate Christmas there.”
“Yeah-“ He continued to shove chocolate chip crepes into his mouth. “He got me tickets for the next Quidditch Season Opening -      Bigonville Bombers VS whoever wins the finals.”
Harry scratched his head. “I’m not sure. I’m looking for a Christmas present...” Continuing to look at the stuffed animals, an idea hit him as a strike of lightning.
Going past the huge pumpkin patch, Harry wondered how big they would become this year. Each Halloween Harry looked forward to seeing the huge pumpkins filling the air with color and light. Simply for fun, he ran his hand through the tallest growing leaves that twisted and turned in and out between the large fruits. As he neared the hut, he could see through the only window. Even though it was quite dirty, the giant’s shadow couldn’t be mistaken. Hagrid was obliviously pacing as his shadow turned back and forth. Harry wondered would could possibly have the giant trudging like that? (un)fortunately, knowing Hagrid it was almost certainly a magical creature and if it was, it was no doubt dangerous or ‘misunderstood’ as Hagrid like to call it. A loud bark wrestled him out of thought and Harry barely had the time to react before a black Dane had attacked him and drooled over his sleeves.
“Well yes. Some of them.” Harry felt himself blush at the mentioning. “I have decided to go out with Malfoy. He asked and I said yes.” He stumbled.
“You are very welcome.” Lifting their joined hands, he kissed the back of Harry’s. “If you ever find yourself needing another favour, just ask.” He teased.
Now sitting at the breakfast table, he carefully tugged on his sleeves to get them over his hands. He was still rather chilly even though the cold had gone down. He was already drinking and eating only hot items. Warm tea with honey, oatmeal with raisins and bananas and he was eyeing a very good-looking muffin if he had any more room afterwards.
Professor Snape didn’t look very impressed as he rubbed his glabella and closed his eyes. Finally, after a great deal of silence, his strong black eyes connected with Harry’s emerald greens.
Neither boy could withhold the laughter and only settled down when Professor Flitwick lightly scolded them; “
The sound of a door opening fell behind him and he groggily turned around to see Snape entering the room.
Soon everyone split up into smaller groups and left Draco and Harry to be the only ones standing back. Harry couldn’t help but look back, wondering if Remus and Snape were fighting. He hadn’t seen the closest person he had to a family, in almost 8 months. Was it so terrible he wanted to spend some time alone with him?
Trying not to let it bother him that Malfoy was discussing him with the Slytherins he kept a straight face and tried to seem bored.
“Hey, don’t you dare blame this on us.” Seamus held out the sugar quill pointing disapprovingly at him. “This place was a total mess before we got in on it.”
“You’re welcome. I have tried to tell them it’s new times, but apparently they’re still getting used to it.” Malfoy said sheepishly. Combing a hand through his silken-gelled locks. Harry had the habit of doing it himself, whenever he felt embarrassed or out of place.
“What? You were going to tell me the truth? YOU LIED TO ME FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR!” The forbidden section almost shook with the power of his roar. The shackled books around them rattled slightly at the disturbance.
“No? Then how is this?” Draco threw his wand to the side and fell down right on top of him. Harry was glad, Draco wasn’t that heavy, otherwise it would have hurt. Still huffing, he moved his lips out of reach as Draco tried to kiss him. After another failed kiss, Draco grabbed his chin and forced him to stay still. The Gryffindor was still chuckling, but it swiftly turned into a moan as the blond, pushed against him. Their simple but strong embrace became hotter as Harry nervously licked Draco’s outer lip.
“Yes, I was thinking about last night. It was rather enjoyable. Sitting outside. Together.” He stretched it out.
“Yes I’ve almost got every present I need, but one is still on the way. I really think it will be great this year. It’s kind of fun we get to celebrate it together.”
“Oh really?” Harry challenged him. Before Draco realized what he was hinting at, he found himself with a chocolate covered nose. The horrifying look on his face was totally worth wasting his precious dessert, and Harry only laughing harder, when Draco used a napkin to wipe it off.
Harry didn’t know where to start. He knew his parents were a sensitive topic to the professor, but he was the only person beside Remus who had known his parents well, or at least his mother.
“He did. I told him everything one day, but he still refused to see me again and I couldn’t blame him. I had hurt him deeply.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Esben quickly explained. “I don’t think you are jealous or anything, I just don’t think I would be that easy around Parkinson if Malfoy was my boyfriend.”
“Stay here with me. Really, it would be so much fun and you could also spend some time with, you know.” Harry didn’t wish to say the name out loud in case anyone was snooping around the shelves.
Remus was probably already heading for the school gates and Harry quickly ran towards the entrance. His lungs burned from the frosty wind blowing through his body; heart beating and legs starting to hurt, he at last saw the small sight of a man heading west.
“It’s just… Draco and I have known each other for years, yet I don’t know anything about him really. We have fought for years and it never got us anywhere but becoming a childish school rivalry. Now, we have a chance to let people see it is okay to change, give each other a second chance, and if I say something wrong… I’m afraid to waste my chance. To say something wrong because of our history. I wish we could just be two people meeting for the first time on our first date. No houses, just two people.” Harry said, now realizing how worried he really was becoming.
“Unfortunately no, I haven’t sewn in years, my hands aren’t steady enough anymore. But if the gift is for your girlfriend why not try a teddy bear or a music box?” He suggested and picked out a pink box from the shelf behind him.
At last, Harry settled on a navy shirt and darker denim pants. It wasn’t anything fancy, but the shirt was a little tighter around his waist than others. Looking at himself in the sharing floor mirror, he rotated a couple of times, making sure there was nothing on the set from behind. The pants did look rather nice on him. Even though Malfoy wouldn’t be able to look at his ass.
“What exactly… is happening between you and Professor Snape?” Seeing the shocked face on his favorite professor, Harry quickly apologized for his meddling.
Laying his hands behind his head, he pondered his following move. He somehow had to convince Potter to become more than ‘friends’. If that was ever going to happen, he would have to get him alone and away from the know-it-all and the Weasel.
After being shushed by Madam Pince for scraping the chair against the floor, Harry sat down at a corner table, away from prying eyes. Getting out his things, he started reading chapter twenty-one and twenty-two. This would be a good place to start, according to Jason. Underlining a few paragraphs he took extended notes on the parchment next to him. For a long time, the only sound he heard was a few whispering students or books when they were pulled from the bookcases. He had almost finished the first chapter when something shadowed his book page. Looking up to glare at whoever was staring at him, Harry was surprised to see the Slytherin boy.
Thankfully, Jason was such a bubbling personality and immediately brought up when and why Remus had decided to become a teacher. The four men slowly lightened up and as they continued to drink the (strong) eggnog, the atmosphere became warmer. Snape rarely spoke during the conversation, but he didn’t seem as tense as when they had stepped in.
The two boys weren’t exactly interested any longer and only gave him a quick glance before nodding along.
In the end, Harry gave up and simply sat down to watch in silence.  He had truly come to care for the dragon as he fondly watched him tug on a root poking up through the fallen snow. As he furiously tugged on the bigger root, his tail assiduously flicked the cold piles from side to side, reminding Harry of Uncle Vernon’s wiper blades. A few fireballs and a lot of cold water later, he was sitting in Hagrid’s cabin, drinking chamomile tea. He actually managed to eat a biscuit after leaving it in his tea for a few minutes. It wasn’t even half bad.
Nodding understandingly Remus sadly answered; “Yes, Professor Dumbledore told the staff. How is he?”
Seeing the careful look in the green eyes, Draco nodded and tried not to sound too disappointed. “Right.”
He felt so relieved. Draco wasn’t angry nor had he ignored him on purpose! Hopefully, they could just make up and forget the whole thing happened.  “Guys I forgot my bag downstairs…” That was definitely one of the worst lies he had ever produced.
“No!” Draco moved towards him, but Harry moved out of his way. “I- I don’t expect you to do anything! But Merlin, Harry, I miss you! Okay, it’s not easy but even if you would never want me back… I just really want my friend back. I just miss being with you.”
“They are still behind and I’m sorry to interrupt, but Blaise-“ He turned to watch the dark olive-skinned teen look at him with surprise and suspicion. “Have you seen Draco? I haven’t had the chance to say goodbye.”
Blaise was watching them, and discreetly nodded for him to get up and leave. Nodding back, the blond teen got up and answered the annoyed girl.
Looking away quickly hoping to avoid the sneering banter, Harry turned his gaze to look at the bare stonewall in front of him. Concentrating so hard on the wall, Harry’s eyes started to water from not blinking to long. He almost jumped when a warm body sat down next to him.
“Students of Hogwarts. Once again, we find ourselves looking forward to another Christmas, but this year is a special year.” He held up a teasing finger. “Because this year is indeed the first in many, we’re celebrating a world without Lord Voldemort. Thanks to many great peoples sacrifice, but one we can thank in particular; Our own Harry Potter.”
“I’m freezing. I thought our normal school sweater was enough, but it’s not really holding up.” He gestured with an arm swing.
While the boys each described the great and awkward moments with their many family members, Harry discreetly looked around at the other groups of students heading for Hogwarts. He had hoped to catch a glint of Draco, at least before dinner. He really wasn’t in the mood to start the second semester by being in a kind-of-fight. A dreadful dark cloud settled over him as he grabbed by a stray thought. ‘What if Draco couldn’t really be bothered to be with him any longer?’
Standing in front of him was the cashier with his bag, smiling so brightly you would have thought Christmas had come early.
“Argh! Oh…” Potter moaned, clearly surprised by his own voice. Draco wanted, no needed to hear him again. The idea of the golden boy, Dumbledore’s little prodigy, lying underneath the Slytherin god, begging Draco to fuck him, was the biggest turn on, Draco had ever fantasized. He continued to grind slowly as he felt Harry pull him down for another kiss.
He had finished packing his bag and everything was ready to go, except him. Severus had never before wanted to stay away from England a badly as now. Even when he had to leave Hogwarts with the train to go back to his disgraceful parents. No, he wished to stay here, maybe start over. H couldn’t leave the deatheaters of course, but maybe have a slightly smaller role to play. Just by bringing potions and finding rare ingredients…
“A student?” Albus pondered, mostly to himself probably. Severus ignored the rhetoric question and filled up his cup.
“Don’t be foolish. Whatever is in that letter is clearly for Severus to see, not you. I trust my lord to tell me whatever information I need. Do you believe yourself so arrogantly that you would dismiss his direct order?”
‘Okay, now it was personal’ Draco realized. Only few times over the last six years had Snape called him by first name in school. Turning back Draco tried to keep his features open and tranquil.
The café was a small place on the corner of a rather busy street. You didn’t really notice the tiny chairs outside before you almost sat down. People continued to walk past them, probably on their way home from work. A few couples sat outside a few tables away from them. when a waiter had approached them and handed them the menu. Lauris immediately ordered a coke and when Severus confined that he had never actually had one, Lauris was ecstatic and demanded him to try one.
Seeing the interior, Draco sniffed in disdain. “Really? You couldn’t think of anything besides your own dorm?”
Lauris seemed rather confused at his antic but simply smiled and answered his question. Severus was barely listening to it, since he was too busy mentally hitting his head against the door.
Harry tried, he truly did, but finally seeing the man he loved again even after everything, hearing him say the words he had longed for, for so many months were overwhelming. A great sob left him as he stared down into his lap, refusing to see the shock on Draco’s face.
Draco clenched his fist trying to sooth his boiling rage. How dare the fool? Draco didn’t have to waste his time speaking to someone of lower stature than him. Potter should be pleased he had tried to take an interest in his dull life. After all, Potter wasn’t anything special. He had just been at the right place at the right time and ‘puff’ he had been famous. Stupid Potter. The rest of the way, Draco fumed. It didn’t help that Pansy looked as if she had the time of her life across from them.
In the dungeon it wasn’t unusual to be little chilly but tonight it seemed almost to the extreme. The second Harry had descended the stairs, goosebumps rose on his arms and legs. By the time he was a few steps from the potion Professor’s private quarters, Remus had finally caught up with him.
“What?” usually, Severus wouldn’t dignify with such a foolish answer but he was most surprised by the chance of subject. Figuring the boy would be angry with him for snooping, he hadn’t expected such a dejected tone. Looking him straight in the eyes, blue and brown clashing black, Jason elaborated.
“Not next time like now, but you know, always. In addition, I could use your name too. Your first name.”
“Don’t worry, it’s not hurting him, it is simply tickling.” Hagrid explained as he saw the doubtful look in Harry’s eyes. At last, after a great deal of sweat and muscles, all Aodhan’s claws were neatly trimmed and Harry went around the floor gathering the remains. Harry finally had a full vial of dragon claws. The brown reddish clippings were stacked and he magically sealed it with a cork.
“Don’t you have to get back as well?” Harry asked. Malfoy didn’t bother to answer but dragged him along towards the fat lady’s portrait.
“Yeah, I wish I didn’t have to interfere, because I know he is one of my best friends but what he is doing just isn’t right. That’s why I’ve been trying to get him to back out all this time. He obviously wouldn’t listen to reason…”
Smiling, Draco suddenly grabbed his wrist and then they were off. Harry tried to keep from laughing at his boyfriend eager. The snuck out amongst the other students and went up the stairwell.
Because of the deep calming silence beside Hagrid’s voice, it wasn’t very surprising that Harry noticed the sound of footsteps behind them. Turning to look, he realized Malfoy was joining the group and he desperately tried to get eye contact with the boy. But as Malfoy turned away from him, Parkinson latched herself on to him and pulled him closer to the unicorns. Harry tried to push down the feeling of disappointment and another feeling, a rather stomach eating one, he didn’t wish to focus on. Seeing another shadow move behind him, his eyes widened as Professor Snape stood behind them in silence. He quickly turned back to the lecture.
“No, not so far.” Harry bend over the table trying to see inside the crack. The egg was completely dark but slowly a yellow beaming opened up. The color quickly changed, getting used to the light from outside. The eye turned large as it finally connected to Harry’s. As if Harry’s presence became encouraging, the egg began cracking in several places at once. The shell flicked off and hit both Harry, Hagrid and a couple of pots, until nothing was left except a slimy very bright red dragon looked up. His eyes instantly sought of Harry and the second he noticed him, it tried to walk over the edge of the table. Thankfully, Harry’s seeker reflections were up to date and he caught the slimy reptile. The dragon moved even further up against him and tried to climb up his shirt with its tiny claws. Laughing, Hagrid sat down exhausted.
Harry got distracted and through the rest of the breakfast the teens joined the conversation with the other students as they discussed their plans for the day.
“Harry.” Remus coaxed and gently let go of his suitcase. It fell to the snow-covered ground and Harry didn’t need any more encouragement. He leapt forward and ran the last few steps and was enfolded in a warm hug. Feeling Remus so close again, made Harry feel at home again for the first time in months. He buried his head into the werewolf’s shoulder, trying his best to keep the tears back. He threw his arms around him and fisted the cold fabric of his robe. A large warm hand settled on the back of his neck, simply holding him.
“Oh, ermh… we’re going sir. I just almost forgot the way and I asked Malfoy where it was.” That was without a doubt the worst excuse he had ever come up with. Seeing the expression on both the Slytherins faces, they thought so too. Malfoy remained quiet and Snape sent them on their way to the Potion room.
“Explain? You had a year to explain!...” Taking a shaking breath, he lowered his voice. He forced himself to look into the eyes that for only a day ago, was the first person he had ever loved. A person whom he had actually been dumb enough to believe would never hurt him.
“A few weeks later I was filled with anger at my own stupidity as I overheard a conversation I wasn’t supposed to. In that anger and dread I told the Dark Lord, begging him for understanding and considering sparring the only person I had left back here in England. Pathetic.”
can’t fit them. Maybe you should consider shopping in the girls department next time.” Malfoy laughed. Harry hurried and tried to push of the Slytherin as he distracted. Even though Harry’s body was smaller he still had a lot of muscle power from training. Malfoy almost fell off but quickly reestablished his position and went back to throw Harry off the bench as well. Mock fighting for the bigger spot of the bench they finally settled by merging their fingers and Malfoy laid his forehead against his.
“Oh,” Looking behind the taller man, he did indeed see Professor Dumbledore cheerfully smile at them. He lifted his wineglass in greeting to Harry’s glance. “Well thank you for telling me, Professor. I will watch out and notify you if anything should come across.”
Running a hand over his eyes, probably itching after forgetting to blink, the tanned teenager faced him.
“Shut it.” He had had enough. Theo shouldn’t believe himself to be on his level. There was only a certain amount of attitude he would withstand.
‘Fine! If it will get him to stop talking.’ Expecting everlasting doses of sugar and simple bread, he took a small bite. He easily bit through the crunchy tier and chewed it thoroughly.
Most of the way to his date’s home, Severus spent the time watching him. Seeing his reaction to different things around them. The children running between them caused a small smile. Every time they passed the painting-selling stalls, he would either wrinkle his nose disapprovingly or slightly nod in acknowledgment. Severus wasn’t sure if he was even aware of his own doings but he found it… somehow adoring.
“No, not actually. There would be so many complications if either of us had dared to turn it into something more. We met in secret whenever we could and just enjoyed the time we had together in a time of war.”
Snape merely shrugged which told him to do as he please. Perhaps he had had a bit too much of that eggnog. Maybe something else would somewhat sober him up. He called for a one of the house elves, ordered a pot of coffee before glancing at Lupin, and ordered a hot chocolate as well. The elf disapparited and Remus thanked him for remembering hot chocolate.
Walking back towards the school the friends joked and laughed. Showing off the items they had bought at the WWW, they continued to pull out things from their bags, showing Harry what the newest stuff trended. Even Hermione had admit some of the pranks were incredibly clever and certainly didn’t lack imagination nor magic Ability.
I will hopefully return sometime with another story. I’ve actually started writing a crossover between Harry Potter and Twilight; Where the main pair will be Draco and Jacob.
Giving a final nod, his father went to the fire pit gathering a handful of powder, waiting for his wife to follow. His mother rose and gave him a single kiss on the cheek before joining Lucius. Together they entered pit and a giant green flame embraced them, sending them back to the manor.
The second the cock hit the back of his throat he had to stop. He felt his eyes water and pulled back enough to breathe properly. Reminding himself to watch the teeth AND not hit the back of his throat, he went down once again. Trying to relax helped tremendously. Settling on a rhythm, he bobbed his head up and down and continued to suck.
“Foolish brat.” Snape sighed. Harry wasn’t sure if it was meant for him or Jason. “He has been in a depressive sort of rage ever since you and Mr. Malfoy ended your… paramour.”
The boys continued to discuss the matter of the Land down under’s absence from the wizarding world. While most countries in the world outside of Europe had stayed neutral concerning the dark lord, it was rather unusual for such a large continent to stay completely out of the matter. Especially since most of its countries had a long history of wizarding wars against each other as well as others.
“Why on earth would that matter now? Beside if you keep fooling around like a child it won’t be long before you’re not a student anymore!” Severus sneered at the childish argument.
How could his son possibly believe he was ashamed of him, when in fact the truth was quite the opposite? Jason was not only rather remarkable in schoolwork, no he also had an astounding easy way of gaining friends as well. Something Severus had envied people through most of his childhood. Every conversation with new people had left him stumped and shy, after his own father had beaten the shit out of him at every chance he got. After this continued for years, Severus had learned quickly to remain unheard.
“Right, sorry.” Harry tried to smile. “It is going well. We’re getting to know each other better and he has actually changed a lot. He isn’t so-“
“Alright, now please take a few balls –yes, there is plenty for everyone- and sit down to practice. If you manage to transfigure a nice shape, then by all means hang it on the Christmas trees.” The jolly old man waved a hand towards the gathered trees in the decorated hall.
A happier smile subtly replaced the darkened face, and Harry could again recognize the illuminating boy.
Malfoy could surely hear the turn his voice had taken and quickly took his hand to try to temper him.
As Severus told the slight slip of information, he realized the dread of never actually telling anyone of the true result of his travels. It had been over a decade and he had been a completely different person back then. A persona, which he had left behind as hate and promises of power, had corrupted his every thought.
They sat side by side and didn’t speak for a long time. Harry was actually relieved it wasn’t more awkward than this. It could possibly be a thousand times worse considering it was them. Together. Alone.
After teasing himself for some time, he took a single finger and circled his tight ring. Forcing himself to relax he carefully entered the digit. The first minute it slipped through wasn’t so much pleasant as strange. Harry waited till he felt himself relax once more and then moved the finger back and fourth. Still just strange but it certainly didn’t hurt. With his other hand he teased his head. Gripping it a little harder and gently twisting it upwards.
The silence was suffocating. How badly Harry wanted to look away from those piercing eyes. His gaze withheld. The lump in his throat became even bigger and seemed to slither its way down into his stomach like a giant snake.
“Damn.” Harry cursed. He rarely did but this was surely a proper moment to do so. He couldn’t believe Snape was a father. Not truly. He was more of a sour uncle-type or maybe even a stepfather, but the idea of him having any sort of romantic relation gave Harry goosebumps and not in a good way.  He had been a great help most of his life, he knew that now, but the sarcastic and snarky smirks and mean comments hadn’t mellowed him out over time.
Finally getting up, Harry could see he held a bunch of smaller rocks in his glove covered hand. Reaching out the hand, he offered one before picking up one himself.
Harry must have gone back to sleep without realizing it because there was no doubt he was dreaming. Trying to shake himself awake, he strained to gather the nerve to reply.
But thank goodness we are still going to follow the characters outside of Hogwarts. Let’s see where our favorite pairs are heading in the next chapter.
With that in mind, he gently pushed against the wooden door, almost afraid of breaking it in half. A tiny bell rang above his head, indicating he had arrived. Walking inside he quickly noticed he was the only person in the quiet store. While the store looked almost abandoned from outside, the inside seemed clean and newly painted. Shelves wasn’t filled with different plastic stuff like in the muggleworld, instead large quantity of space was placed between the modest toys. Wooden boxes with bears and magic fireworks. Small black- and white painted music boxes was laid out, and the display showed old springs and metal gears screwed in.
On their way home, the wind had truly picked up and almost all the students were scooting together and holding up their scarfs to avoid the hail. Harry had already replaced the warming charm on his clothes, twice. As gross as it was, he kept drying his wet nose on his cloak. Thankfully, the trip from Hogsmeade wasn’t too long and the students soon found themselves safe inside the warm castle. Almost everyone took off their cloaks, gloves and scarf in the hall, the wet clothes were dripping with defrosted snow. The Professor summoned a few houseelves from the kitchens and they quickly collected the offered clothes.
“You are kidding? How could that possibly be true?” she grinned. “Unless of course… the little golden boy actually has a crush on you? Oh, Draco please become my special little Gryffindor snake?” She mocked and batted her eyes at him.
But right now, it seemed like Malfoy might be wanting more. Harry tried to calm his beating heart. His hands were getting sweaty and he discreetly wiped them on his black robe as Malfoy came closer. In the end Harry forced his eyes shut and just waited, anticipated the following move.
Inside the cabin Harry greeted Aodhan and was immediately sloped in drool. Aodhan was now the size of fang and his tail was almost as large as his body. The dragon must have caught a whiff of the treats Harry had hidden because the animal started pulling on the hem of his robe.
“Well… it’s about tomorrow,” Harry sat down on Dean’s bed. The boy pulled back his legs for him to sit down properly. “I was thinking about being with Draco, physically.”
“So, after almost three hours the game ended. Their seeker, Hisoku, did a Spiral dive, nearly hitting the ground. He caught the golden snitch and Japan won with only thirty points.”
“The keeper from Japan broke his arm. The Russian teams’ beater exchanged the quaffle for an incoming bludger and the keeper didn’t see it before it was too late. They paused the game for a few minutes because Japan’s coach was so pissed off, he nearly drew his wand.” Malfoy laughed.
DADA was still Harry’s favorite class. He always imagined how rusty he would feel getting back from a summer at the Dursleys, but his wandwork and agility had stayed just the same as he had left it at Hogwarts. Dueling with his teacher was the closets he would come to a true challenge at school. He didn’t mean to brag but having fought against the dark lord and practiced with Professor Snape as well as the headmaster, Harry couldn’t find competition amongst his peers.
“Very good.” Draco confidently leaned in to kiss him. Their lips quickly moulded against one another, capturing the other’s unique taste. While Draco minded a lot of things about Potter, kissing wasn’t one of them. The smaller male fit perfectly against his as his own lips were rather thin but broad, Potter’s were fuller and narrowed. Sneaking a hand to his chest Draco gently pushed him down on top of his silk sheets. Falling down, Draco captured the slightly gasped out air from Potter’s mouth.
The bell-like voice could only belong to one student and Harry quickly finished his toast so he could say hello.
As he entered the castle, the carolling ghosts floated past him and although he didn’t want to interrupt the… interesting music, he needed to know if Nearly Headless Nick knew where Jason had gone to. The ghost didn’t stop singing but merely pointed a pale finger towards the great hall. It was weird how much the ghost resembled to John Cleese, a muggle actor Harry had seen on tv once. Nodding his thanks, Harry found a larger part of the left students in the hall – Jason included – with Professor Flitwick. The smaller wizard was eagerly pointing his wand at an ordinary red Christmas ball in his hand. Getting closer to the group, Harry listened.
“Now, Malfoy!” Looking up he could see a good radius of students around them had heard Pansy and were clearly ready to see the argument unfolding before them. Throwing her claws of him, Draco looked at Blaise a few seats to the right having breakfast with Melck. They had been incredible chummy ever since Melck had been attacked by a unicorn.
Meeting up with his friends, he saw them gathered at a round table, almost sitting on top of each other since the bar was full of students and shoppers. Placing his bags beside his feet, he sat down next to Neville. A warm mug of butterbeer was slide in his direction and he quickly warmed his cold hands on it. The others were already chatting quite loudly of all their purchases.
They spent the day together at the edge of the forest as he tried to teach Aodhan to sit. The dragon wasn’t very interested in listening to Harry’s command but would rather spend the day chasing rats and smaller lizards running between the piles of snow.
“No, don’t. It’s not your fault in any way…” realizing he wasn’t the only one hurting right now, he wisped around to face him. “Harry, you have to know, I didn’t! Know, that is. Nothing, I swear. I would have told you!”
“Yes.” The answer seemed to finalise his thoughts. It brought clearance, yet so many questions were left unanswered.
Politely declining, Harry asked him again to clarify. “I don’t want to run with gossip.” Esben once again apologized.
Toys? Well, Draco was certainly to grown up to get a toy. But perhaps… if he was so grown up, he might see the irony in getting him one. ‘Either way’ Harry thought, ‘He will surely want to exchange it, no matter what I get him. So why not?’
In the end, Jason had to break it off and let his hands down. He looked quite exhausted and slumped back against the couch.
“No I still believe it, but I just don’t think it make you less of a wizard not to be completely pureblood, anymore. I mean, the Potter family has always had a strong magical core to their name. it’s not like you’re a mu-“ Stopping himself, Malfoy obviously realized what he was about to say, but so was Harry.
“When I lost my father, I suddenly had to make massive decisions which I wasn’t ready to take. The officiant aurors came to stay with me while I… packed everything. But as I cleaned out our finances one of the aurors whom had been staying with me, had collected my birth certificate and other valuables from another vault my father had. As it turned out I had another parent.”
“Perhaps not, but that is my decision, so as it will be, when I start talking to Potter, he will be automatically drawn.” Hopefully.
“Hey Harry, I wondered where you were. I thought you would have arrived with your friends to say goodbye.”
No matter what had happened between him and Potter, he had to focus on the bet. It didn’t actually matter if Potter made him feel anything – which Draco had a harder and harder time convincing himself of – because in the end what mattered was his freedom. He would never have to see Potter again after graduation and hopefully, Pansy would sink her pink-colored claws into another man.
“I do believe I have someone who can finally help. Beside you of course.” Dumbledore gently stroked the large bird down his chest. Blaise said nothing as he watched the interaction between the pair.
Glaring at the talking teacher, Draco understood he had to be careful around him. The professor knew more than he intended to, and he didn’t have the time for Snape to interfere with his plans. Snape was always right behind Potter and had been ever since he first came to Hogwarts. Even though Draco had never understood why, Snape had somehow kept Potter safe from the dark lord. Draco had just only realized this fact after the dismiss of the Dark Lord.
A rather hard slap on his back startled him. The boys had caught up and the group walked together towards the great hall. Lunch was mostly the same each day. Sorted warm- and cold dishes, salads, breads and fruit. Harry had just grabbed a big piece of chicken breast when a smaller shadow covered him. Turning his head towards the intruder, Ginny Weasley stood beside him.
“Jason,” Harry tried to seem as apologetic as he could. “It wasn’t just Draco. They all knew… they were all a part of it.” He whispered.
“No fair! Malfoy tackled Harry to the floor first, that got to count right?” Seamus, the absolute most competitive teen from Gryffindor, hectically sought Jason out for a ruling.
“I haven’t seen him in so long; I don’t even know where he is.” Harry sighed distressed. A light soothing hand was placed on his shoulder, patting him a few times.
“Hey guys.” Finally out of the cold, Harry’s mood generously lifted and seeing his friend, he smiled.
“Yeah, I heard it. But it was never ‘real’. Wasn’t it just something your parents had discussed. Beside Draco has already told his parents ‘no’.”
DADA had started this week with Remus Lupin as their teacher and it was great to have him back. Students, now aware of his condition, had had a hard time relaxing around him. Thankfully, Remus was a kind soul and it as only a few of his lectures before the school remembered him from third year or at least the students whom had arrived at Hogwarts at that time. It would still take some time for the prejudice against werewolves in general but it was hopefully only a matter of time. During the class with the Hufflepuffs Harry sat down in the second row, wanting to be able to see whatever dark creature Remus had brought in today.
“Fine! No, not really. He wanted to date him, so I’m just guessing Draco likes him, okay? You don’t really talk about your feelings in Slytherin, especially not if you are a man.”
Hermione and Ron were still his friends but at times like these, Harry was worried they were outgrowing each other. They had been through so much together, walked through fire – literally – but they were becoming adults and were truly starting to find their own paths, instead of just the one of homework and Voldemort related incidents. Perhaps it was for the best Harry kept his distance for the time being. He couldn’t imagine losing his two first friends, especially over something as silly as a date but unfortunately, it seemed to be the only thing they discussed, recently. Giving each other some space, might not be the worst idea; At least for now.
“I still don’t believe you.” Harry continued to be in disbelief. He knew that Australia was known as one of the more dragon and lizard overpopulated countries but that rule was ridiculous. He would have to see a set of rules from an actual school before he believed him.
“Sorry, Professor, we were just about to go in.” Hermione apologized and practically dragged Ron along.
“Hey Potter, need a little for the nerves?” Luke from sixth year pushed a flask under his nose. Luke’s date – Amber something- had her arms around him and shyly smiled encouragingly at him. Her purple dress was rather tasteful as she leaned against her date.
Meaning that hurting Potter was hurting him. Seeing stupid saint Potter hurt was actually hurting him…
“What is that?” Blaise leaned over to take whatever Draco was playing with. The blonde quickly pulled it out of reach and clasped it tighter between his hands. The silver chain gently rattled as it rubbed against itself.
Still completely, lost Harry and Dean sent each other equally confused as to what the strange boy was talking about. As he realized his suggestion wouldn’t get the grateful reaction he was hoping for, Seamus gave an exasperated sigh before making a very crude hand gesture, earning him a blushing Harry and a very sore arm from where Dean had hit him in offense.
Draco couldn’t say he cared much for their social life. Many of their associates had fled the country the second the news of the dark lords falling had reached them. Their Slytherin house would be rather quiet this year, but Draco swore it would remain the strongest. Looking past the window from his side, he was happy to say most of his… friends had made it back. He didn’t care too much except for his one true friend Blaise Zabini, who had convinced his mother to let him back. The olive-skinned boy was sitting right across from him, looking thoughtfully out at the green landscape. Both of them had definitely been around their fair share of women, before realizing it only led annoying girls whom kept trying to worm their way into their bed again.
Sighing greatly, the professor composed himself and the two men continued their walk in silence. As they approached the dungeon, Snape stopped.
“Did we make you uncomfortable? I don’t wish things to get difficult between us, so please if there is anything, just say it.”
Dancing the second dance, Jason felt so incredibly consumed by happiness. The veela inside him purred as they danced with their mate so close. Holding the smaller man tightly against him, Jason couldn’t help but rejoice as Blaise seemed ignorant or at least careless about the stares they gathered.
“Yes, thank you indeed.” A grumbling dark voice coldly stated from behind them. “-For disrupting school property CLOSED OFF, when it is not being used for official games.”
A strong grip held his arm up, keeping Harry’s body from hitting the floor. Embarrassed as he was, Harry was rather grateful for the rescue.
Blushing slightly at the mention of Draco, he tried not to smile like an idiot. “Good. It’s… really great. The other day we were sitting outside and just talking. Nothing else and I couldn’t believe I liked it as much as I love kissing him. I honestly thought it would be the more ‘normal’ part of a relationship.”
Leaving the dining hall, Harry stayed close to the wall. Staying out of the other students’ notice. Most of the time it came in his favor that he hadn’t grown very tall. Many of his mates towered over him, hiding him in the most convenient times, and then there were other times when-
“So, Harry why did you suddenly feel for a snowball fight?” He lifted his hand in a surrendering motion. “Don’t get me wrong, it sounds fun, I just didn’t realize you were such a fan of violence.” He laughed while Dean elbowed him in the side.
“Erm, yeah just the burrow as usual.” Ron shrugged. “But Charlie is coming home, so that’s something.”
“Yes, I miss it so much. It will be my first Christmas without… away from Australia, and I just don’t see why Christmas is worth celebrating anymore.”
The boys decided to each find a few possible themes for their paper before actually discussion them.
“Staying here.” Harry followed with shrugging. “Usually, I head home with the Weasleys but things are still… challenging.”
“Careful Lesley, if you talk to him too much, he might think you are hitting on him.” They laughed mockingly.
Either way, Harry yelled the first thing that came to mind, in hopes of saving any of them from a very difficult conversation.
“Yes and no. While it wasn’t intentional, werewolves don’t back out. So my feelings for Sirius had never changed from that of a brother and a friend, but the wolf inside me controlled a part. He wanted to be with Sirius no matter the consequences. As long as I was “with” Sirius, I could control the animalistic part of me. We would hold hands, kiss on the forehead, sleep in the same bed and be together in the forest. That was enough for me. We were never ‘together’. I was grateful that Sirius - who was a wellknown skirtchaser- was comfortable helping me. The days where we tried keeping apart I would break out in fever. So most nights we stayed together.”
Of course. Of all people, he had to run into Potter. The most Annoying golden child, who only lived to be a pain in the ass.
In that second, Harry found himself begging to every god he had ever heard off. Let it be a lie, a horrible lie she had made up. In a minute she loud laugh at him and turn away. Simply trying to amuse herself by seeing him in distress. She would turn away from him and everything was as before.
Smirking the blond teen leaned in to kiss his cheek gently. Even though his warm lips quickly left again, Harry couldn’t keep the smile of his face.
No matter how hard he tried to forget his terrible childhood and pathetic parents, he was actually glad he grew up in a mugglehood, since he understood and remembered most of the things they did and said. Not that he would ever dare to tell a soul in their circles. Unless he wished to be the reason of ridicule for the rest of his service.
Had Draco not been standing in direct moonlight, Harry was certain his eyebrows would have disappeared altogether as they froze at his hairline. After blinking comically for about a second, he snapped out of it.
Looking out through the small hole between the stature’s arm and side, Harry watched as Snape marched past him and down the corridor. Harry was painfully aware of the fact that he had stopped breathing and he soundlessly gasped for air. Snape had really been helpful this year and saved his life on multiple occasions during the war, but he was still probably the scariest man, Harry had ever been alone with.
He grabbed the boy around his waist for support and dug his nails into it. The tiny amount of pain was apparently the right choice because Harry started to sound like a cat in heat. The man held his shirt in his fist and begged Draco to fuck him. Unfortunately, being their age, it didn’t take much more for Draco to come and he slammed a last time in, before ridding out his orgasm on top of his Gryffindor.
“I think I found your jumper.” He handed Harry a red sweater with the golden snitch on it, which was hard to tell since it was covered in dustbunnies, right now.
“My son…” He whispered, trying to comprehend the overwhelming feeling of love one could only have for a child of his own. They didn’t need to speak to feel the comfort of home from one another, and Snape just kept rocking the boy as he felt the wetness dripping down his shoulder, where Jason had buried his face.
“Good, I think. I don’t really have any idea how to win a snowball fight. I never tried it.” She said bashfully.
“Isn’t it impressive how they managed to get Weazters Burns to make all these ice sculptors?” Luna gently poked at the freezing centerpiece.
He kept looking around for a certain pastry shop that Mr. Knott had fallen for whilst here. It was a muggle store and Severus was apparently perfect to blend in with the wastes of breaths. He had never even seen the place but by direction is should be a small shop looking like a cousin to Madam Puttifoot’s Tea Shop.
A roaming fire lit up the small livingroom where black and grey furniture took up space. Books were scattered all around the room. In the giant bookcases against the walls, on the black marble coffeetable and on every smaller surface.
Yeah, he could certainly see the appealing idea of lying under Draco, their chest and groins pressed together. But he wasn’t sure how to even breach the subject? Should he simply tell Draco he was ready? Oh god, the idea of just saying it aloud seemed horrifying. Maybe he would just wait and see if it came to a natural point. Maybe this would have been easier if he had been with a woman first… then at least, he wouldn’t feel self-conscious about being naked in front of Draco.
“Come now, my boy,” Dumbledore grabbed the taller man by his elbow as he led the annoyed man with him. “It has been a very long time since we’ve had a drink together.”
Draco ignored her. Pansy just leaned back with a real grin on her face. They both knew neither wanted to be at the end of their parents’ wrath. Pansy had won this argument so many times but at some point, Draco hoped she would give it up.
The awkward silence was stretching. God, Couldn’t Malfoy just have stayed upstairs with his friends?
“Yes, thank you.” Coughing slightly he didn’t gather the money in his pocket. As Lauris looked at him and removed at slightly loose curl from his face, Severus tried to remember why he was there.
“The auror whom had spent the next on my couch decided to help me, in secret of course, but a quick search on eyes changing colors was an easy target in the wizarding world. Beside spells, there are usually no possible ways for human eyes to transform. Problem was we’re only looking for ways to alter humans…”
Slowly they ventured into the less crowded streets and, houses and apartments replaced the shops. Only a few locals were sitting on a three-step staircase having a smoke. Beside them, the street was empty.
“Yeah, but I’m just wondering… if you could tell me how to…” Harry left off. At the blundering look on Dean’s face, it was obvious he had no idea what he was hinting at. “How to start it.” He sighed.
Draco quickly pulled his wand out and pointed it at Harry opening. Slicking it with a spell made Harry hiss.
“And I say bullshit.” Harry argued. “You haven’t known each other long enough to even say that. I can’t imagine it being easy, this situation, especially not with Snape in it, but I really think you should try.”
Opening his eyes, he sat up startled. He was shaking and tried to calm his heaving breath. His heart was racing at the thought of something still lurking in the dark. Looking around he saw light, but without his glasses, everything was mostly blurry shapes and colors. In front of him, an orange dot sat on his bed. He could feel the warmth of another human being. Unless Ginny had decided to join their dorm, Harry was most certain it was Ron. The color couldn’t be mistaken for anyone else. Some of the other shapes moved and Harry could see his glasses as they came closer to his face and he reached out to grasp them.
Harry tried to keep his focus on the food and his friends out of sheer stubbornness but he found himself more often than not, looking back at the blond head, hoping for him to turn around and notice the glance.
“Not everyone, but this guy seems pretty cool.” Seamus intervened with a mouth full of buttered toast.
“Yes, I know. Okay, it just isn’t as easy…” she started pacing in front of him. “Alright Potter, no one can ever know I told you…”
“Not you too! This is insane! He is a completely nice block, and he hasn’t done the slightest thing to even raise suspicion.”
Draco pushed his way through his fellows and tried to escape the embarrassment of the other students looking at them. He didn’t get to far considering everyone else stepping off the train at the same time, had created a bit of a line to the carriages. His friends had finally caught up with him and while most of them were still trying to keep in the glee of having to watch Draco Malfoy court Harry Potter, Blaise seemed concerned.
It didn’t last long before the group heard the approaching sounds of footsteps in the crisp snow. Green and Black- dressed in cloaks, the Slytherins joined them. Harry only recognized a few, such as Draco, Zabini and Knott. The rest seemed to be friendly enough, just a little withholding. The minute Draco was close enough he quickly but gently swooped in for a kiss. Even the smallest contact from Draco still sent a tingling feeling down his spine. Letting go of his lips, Draco leaned back with a smirk. His eyes quickly turned cold though, looking at something behind Harry. Harry also looked and realized Hermione was watching them with narrowed eyes.
Entering the Charms classroom, he slid behind a few Ravenclaws, hoping to find a seat where he could have a better chance of staying clear of Flitwick. Settling for the back of the second row bench, he sat down quietly as the rest of the students found their seats. Bringing out is things he would have barely noticed the person next to him, If it weren’t for the light blonde hair swinging in the corner of his eyesight.
He hadn’t really noticed how close they sat before he realized Malfoy had a nice smile. Somehow, he looked more matured and centered, not sneering at anything and everything in his way. Shaking to clear his head, Harry exclaimed he would have loved to see that game.
That thought was so scary, Draco stopped up in the middle of the corridor. Some of the third years’ almost walked straight into him. Complaining quietly to each other they moved around him and continued towards their next class.
“It matters!” Jason fist hit the coffeetable so hard the empthy glass on it feel to the floor with a loud crash. The sound of glass busting into tiny pieces filled the room with silence. The two males watched the other as they tried to regain control. After a long pause, where neither knew what to say, Jason finally spoke again with a strained voice.
“I know.” Harry was still heaving for air, trying to ignore the hurt of Remus’ comment. “But I wanted to talk to you in private. Why do you have to leave so soon?”
Coming to a halt, Harry noticed Hannah Abbott amongst the Hufflepuffs. Gently stopping her by grabbing her arm, he certainly surprised her.
“Thanks, Neville.” Harry took the offered piece of clothing and quickly spelled it clean. He pulled it on and gathered the rest of his clothes lying on the bed. The boys got ready as everyone finally found their missing pieces.
If you didn’t know Snape well, you would think the news didn’t startle him. The stone cold face showed no sign of emotion or surprised at Draco’s honesty. But frankly, Malfoy had known him since birth and he could recognize the smaller signs that Snape found the ‘truth’ problematic. The slightly clenched jaw and the fact that his fingertips pressed even harder against each other.
Carting his fingers through his hair in nervous habit, Harry shrugged. “Well, I just don’t imagine it’s easy for them to come back this year. With most of them gone overseas and parents’ in jail, you know?”
Harry felt him pull back, but this time a second finger joined. This time it barely stung at all. Harry was quickly starting to get impatient and horny for that matter. It was almost humiliating, fucking himself on just Draco’s fingers. But he couldn’t help himself.
“So,” He started cutting the smaller branches with a pair of scissors. “I hear you and Harry were on a date, how did it go?”
“No, sir.” The elf apologized, his giant ears dropping. “Elves don’t usually get involved with other magical creatures unless they are asked to by their master. Dobby wasn’t even the elf, asked to deliver the stash of food for them, Mr. Potter.”
Harry had been so lost in thoughts he almost got a heart attack, when Dean’s voice echoed in the small room. He was sitting up again, his lap still covered.
Harry was truly confused how to answer that. Of all the ways he had imagined Draco asking him, this was not one of the scenarios.
Trying to find something to say to break the again-awkward silence, Harry was suddenly pulled behind a giant shelf and pushed against the wall as Malfoy slammed his hand over his mouth. Trying to comprehend what the hell he was doing, Harry heard the sound of footsteps and someone mumbling getting closer. He barely dared to breath when suddenly the door was slammed open and light entered the room again.
The leader shook hands with Dumbledore a final time, before climbing his own broom as well. Aodhan didn’t even flinch as the cage got off the ground. He was steadily asleep and would probably not wake before they were back in Africa. Harry continued crying silently as someone grabbed his hand. Draco had finally decided it was safe enough to step closer as the dragon was levitated into the cloudy air. His warm slender hand grabbed his tightly and Harry leaned against the shoulder. Whishing he could stop the crying before turning towards the professors once more.  In complete silence they watched the group turn smaller and smaller until they had disappeared into the night sky.
“It’ll be fine, ‘arry.” Hagrid drank the last of his tea and reached for a cookie. “Besides, he had nowhere to go. The Peruvian vippertooths’ aren’t supposed to leave the country. If anyone else gets a hold of this, Charlie could lose his job and in worst case be charged for felony. It will be fine…” Harry wasn’t sure which one of them Hagrid was trying to convince.
Trying to keep from shaking, Harry started toying with the leather belt. It seemed strange but the smell of the leather was rather arousing, and he leaned it closer to smell it.
From the low podium at the front of the great hall, Severus was eating his egg benedict and slices of green bell pepper. Crunching the thin slices, he tried to ignore the usual chatter from his colleges. Flitwick beside him was enjoying his strawberry yogurt with such a delight, that most of the sticky mess ended up in his beard.
Shocked, Harry felt his jaw actually dropping, slightly. Did Malfoy just ask him to do something together? Outside of school? This day could certainly not get any weirder. Harry had no idea how to respond. What reason could Malfoy possibly have to ask him?
“Potter, have you by any chance lost you mind?” Zabini spurted as he escaped the fistful and started smoothing out his wrinkled shirt.
“How dare you?” He boomed. “I will not have you anyway near my son! As if you could ever be good enough, a simple half-blood!?”
“Well, it’s nothing, but they kind of don’t like the fact that I have decided to start hanging out with you.” Malfoy shrugged.
Gathering the suit from the clerk, the round older man went off to find him a matching tie. It didn’t take too long before he stood in the changing room, looking from side to side at his reflection. No matter how long he stared at himself, he felt self-conscious. The suit was gorgeous but it just made him feel like a child trying on his dad’s robes.
Blaise didn’t answer but only regarded him for a moment before turning back to his book. For some reason, Harry could see – not doubt, but a kind of unsettling expression in the hazel colored eyes. As he obviously wasn’t going to get a response, Harry returned to read the chapter he started.
“Yes, Mr. Potter, but unfortunately you must quickly get used to the fact that friendship changes over the years, particularly when you are teenagers and that it indeed,
“Oh, sure.” He quickly peered at the Slytherin table where a smirking blond gave him a soft wave goodbye. Harry shyly waved back before getting up to leave with his friends. The weather outside was mild and it was thankfully not snowing yet again.
“I always had it with me and then one night I had a nightmare so I sought out my parents. I knew they were somewhere in the manor but it is a pretty big mansion. I finally came across my father’s study and I heard him talk. Figuring it was okay, I entered.” He sighed.
Unfortunately, his faking calming demeanour only lasted until a hissing cat sound ran its gross warm breath into his ear.
“That’s it?” Harry huffed. “You think everything is just okay now that you’ve given me a half-assed apology?”
“And then what? What am I supposed to do with that? Say ‘thank you for coming back’?” Harry almost laughed tragically at the pain he felt.
Both walked in deep silence, each contemplated their conversation just now. As they arrived, the Fat lady was leaning on her hand snoring quietly into it.
“Okay! I get it.” Harry blushed. Well, it was at least better than to stay up all night worrying about tomorrow. A nice warm shower and a bit of wanking my actually do him some good.
“Sorry,” Draco laughed. “I won’t waste your time; I just wanted to know if you were feeling better.”
“Alone.” The stretched tone actually made him wonder. Sighing in great exhaustion, he got up and followed the strutting woman outside. The January air was cold and exiting the entrance, Draco did his best not to show his discomfort. Casually, he folded his arms, staring at her in expectance.
Returning the smile, Hagrid poured them another cup of tea before sitting down next to him. Once again, Harry was amazed that the chair didn’t break underneath the weight. Aodhan was all snuggled up between a pillow and the blanket on Hagrid’s bed. He was probably quite exhausted after all that struggling. The long red tail was the only thing moving, swaying from side to side while it snored.
“OH, right!” Harry couldn’t help the nervous laugh. “I’ve been good. Schoolwork is going well. My friends… well most have been very supportive, but it has taken its toll on a few of the others.”
But it was soon time to study for the newts and the OWLs, and the student body had enough on their plate. The whispers and the gossip were exchanged for studying and minor breakdowns, every other day. Harry could honestly not wait for the exams. He wished to gather whatever grades he could manage and hopefully get accepted into a healer internship at Skt. Mungos.
He didn’t mean to pry for details, but Harry felt no need to be within a hundred yards from any of the Slytherin group right now and being friends with Jason could certainly complicate things.
A sinking feeling, cold as ice, were sinking into his gut and but Blaise would not be stupid enough to show any sort of emotion before he was certain Jason even knew the truth.
Well. Potter, I actually had a proposition for you.” A proposition? That was certainly a surprise. A dangerous one coming from the blond Slytherin. Malfoy didn’t exactly look at him but rather over his head, staring. He seemed sort of nervous, blinking a little more than what was necessary.
Suddenly the blonde shuddered rather harshly and a warm flood forcefully entered Harry’s body, as Draco rode out his orgasm. After a final push, he fell down on top of Harry and they landed together in a sweaty pile.
“Sorry guys,” Harry took a huge piece of shepherd pie. “I went to Hagrid’s and I just lost track of time.”
He hated begging, but he could understand Pansy in a way. She was facing dealing with the wrath of her parents alone, and being a woman who rejected a marriage had not become easier than it had been a hundred years ago in their society.
As Snape re-entered the room he held a warm goblet of something smoky. He almost bumped the table in a hurry to place the golden cup in front of Remus before sitting back down.
“Sorry there’.” He apologized. “I saw you from me’ window and noticed you were heading another direction. So, I got curious.”
“Do not be absurd. I have no use for anything there; I am simple going alongside you until the tower as I am heading for the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey says a larger amount of snailburn healing potions are missing and when the spring comes, she will want to be fully stocked.”
Slowly the larger hands on either side of him was removed and Jason just fell back against the bookcase to the right. He rubbed his eyes, tired and angry.
The lips he had come to love, dove in and met his own. The pleasure and warmth melted him and still crying he clung to the head of his lover. It was impossible not to find comfort in the arms when he felt so alone… so hurt… even if Draco was the one who caused it.
Besides, his parents were happy, Pansy was happy, and their fellow purebloods had seemed pleased by the match, so why should he be the only one to complain. Besides, it didn’t really matter. If it wasn’t Pansy, it would be someone else, so why spend anymore fuss. He didn’t even want to think about how much money his parents and the Parkinsons had spent on this ceremony.
It had been so long since either men spoke. Unsent letters and painful memories arose as Harry worried how to act.
As Dinner was cleared and dessert had been shared, the orchestra began playing, indicating it was time to dance. Few couples got up to dance at first but soon gathered followers. Harry was not especially eager to dance but found it rather amusing when Jason got up like the perfect gentleman and asked Blaise for a dance. Even though the Slytherin complained and cursed his boyfriend to the moon, all the way to the center of the floor. Hermione also seemed to have had enough of her boyfriend discussing Quidditch through most of the night, and she quickly linked their arms and forced him up to dance as well.
“Veela by blood, but squib. My other father must have been a wizard and released that part of my father, which was able to carry children. I never saw any signs of him affected by the creature-side.”
Could this possibly have something to do with their newest member of the faculty? Severus knew it wasn’t his place to decide whom the position should be delegated to, but he couldn’t help the feeling off betrayal, looking at Albus face. He could at least have given him a notice that the werewolf was coming back.
“Erhm. No sir, I wished to speak to you and noticed your schedule didn’t show any class this morning.”
“Which can only be proven if you willingly take a stand in the court and register yourself under their Creature Value and Protection law, meaning you will be under sharp measuring and detection constantly.”
A small child in a floral white dress shyly waved at him and hid her blushing face in her mother’s skirt as Harry returned it.
“SHH!” Madam Pince hissed at them as she walked by with her cart of returned books. Waiting for her to pass them far enough, Harry lowered his voice.
“Yes, he changed a little, okay? But that’s normal when you start dating and seeing each other all the time.”
“Okay then, the teams are alienated, now each team has exactly ten minutes to make snowballs and walls to hide behind, NO MAGIC! When the game begins, you can only be hit once. When that happens, you will step to the outside of the line, cheering for your team to win.” Jason explained while crossing the line towards his own team. Setting a tempus charm in the middle he set the timer.
A quiet knock on his front door pulled him out of thoughts. Knocking back the rest of the disgusting drink, he left the empty glass on his coffee table and went to investigate who had dared to interrupt his evening. Opening the door however was a moot point, because before the he had had the chance to open the door, his son entered looking sheepishly around.
Harry undid the belt quickly and pulled down the zipper. The bulge – larger than his own, dammit- almost sprung up and tented the black underwear along. With a single finger, he leaned closer and felt the shape through the silky underwear. He could hear Draco breathing deeper, but he was too concentrated to look.
He couldn’t help himself. Desperately Harry tried to lie still but his hips pushed back towards Draco’s face. Harry wasn’t sure for how long Draco touched and licked him, but by the time he pulled away Harry had drool on his chin from how much he panted in pleasure.
The teen didn’t answer but continued to drag him along. It wasn’t much further before he was pushed into a darkened room, most likely a broom closet. Blinking furiously, Harry tried to get used to the dark and focused on the pale face standing in front of him.
“What? No! I wouldn’t do that.” Harry then explained his idea and thankfully, Hagrid could see the sense in using Aodhan instead of buying some expensive claws from the apothecary. Anything coming from a dragon could be used in magical experiments but because of the difficult in breeding and gathering the supplies, dragon items could be very, VERY expensive.
Walking in further, he stepped on something very soft. Fearing it was a cat, Harry got frightened and fell into the shelf with music boxes, sending one off. A plinky-plonky melody began as the metal disk ran over the small strings. It was quite louder than he had expected from such a small box.
Seeing as Draco still wasn’t done dancing, the shorter boy left to find his other friends. He had barely walked a few feet before a rather loud squeaky voice called him out.
They were at the floor where Harry was supposed to turn to head for the Gryffindor common room, when Malfoy grabbed his hand stopping him from leaving.
Severus slowed down as they came to a natural stop by the front door. Lauris didn’t talk but simply gathered a key from his pocket.
Munching on a ham- and cheese sandwich, Harry focused his attention to the subject at hand. He had actually said yes to going out with Malfoy. THE Draco Malfoy had asked him out. Him. On a date. No one would ever believe him even if he drank an entire bottle of veritaserum first. They were going out on a date next time Hogwarts planned a trip to Hogsmeade. Well, maybe not a date, actually. Malfoy had only said he would like to spend some time together. But did he mean as a friend? He hadn’t really seemed like he only wanted to be friends but he hadn’t exactly mentioned the word ‘date’ either…
But now, his son knew the part of his youth that was becoming common knowledge around Great Britain.
Draco just hummed in part agreement. Just the idea of making small talk with the golden trio made him nauseas.
Severus couldn’t help the snort that left him at the ridiculous notion of a bottle of wine costing the same as a few pounds.
Coughing uncomfortably Dean and Seamus started to clean up Harry’s tornado just to have something else to do. Harry wasn’t sure if he should say something or let it stay a simple nice encounter.
But even if the man was simply flirting for the sale, no one would blame Severus for trying, right? He was a rather pretty boy, almost his own complete opposite. His brown eyes started bothering Severus in his sleep and when the third Monday came around and Severus had been woken drenched in sweat and other liquids, he wanted to get it over with.
“Oh no, I barely just arrived here in UK, but I have talked to him on multiple occasions. He is… helping me with a personal matter.” Jason explained. “I do not wish to speak of it, if that’s all right.” Giving a nonchalant smile.
“It will be the following-” Pansy declared. “Draco must find a person from Gryffindor, whom he will have until summer, to deceive into falling in love with him, declare their love and sleep with him. This will have to happen before the final exams begin, in order for him to win.”
Sitting down again after taking a walk around the infirmary, Blaise carefully used a finger to feel down Jason’s face. The second he actually felt the cracks beneath his fingers, he almost screamed. Removing his fingers quickly he watched as part of Jason’s dusty skin was stuck on him. He had to slowly harshly as bill arose in his throat. Leaning across his face, watching where his fingers had dug into the love of his life, sweeping away his beauty, Blaise wept. The tears rolled down his face, leaving his cheeks wet and clammy.
God, I really loved this chapter. Jason and Blaise are my favorite couple in this story. I don’t know if it seems a little narcissistic since I created one of them, but I just think their different personality matches so perfectly and the fact that they aren’t perfect.
“Winky!” he called into the empty space. Immediately after, an apparition pop sounded and the small female elf was standing in front of him, holding onto her stained gown.
“Draco, wait,” Harry tried to pull away, even as Draco groaned in disagreement. “Draco. I’m sorry, I just… it’s too soon.”
Outside the sun had disappeared behind the grey wall of clouds and a breezy wind caught up to him and swirled his hair into an even bigger mess than usual. Tying his robe closer around him, he went past the long stone hall and went down the green hill. Even from here, Harry could see that Hagrid was home as a cloud of smoke left the small hut through the handmade chimney. Continuing down the stone path, he put his hands inside his pockets to keep them from freezing. Already, he could feel the cold burning red imprints on his prickly skin. Hopefully, the hut would be nice and warm or at least he could get a warm cup of tea.
“Maybe.” Harry tried to seem indifferent. “But I think it would be more fun for him to stay here. You know, with us. Erhm, you are staying this year, right?” yes innocently and totally after the plan.
A chimming doorbell rang as he opened the door. Severus tried desperately to keep the sneer of his face from the off-putting ensemble. The walls were covered in beige and mintgreen stripes, with giant paintings of dukes and duchess’ posing in golden frames and the cups and teakettles on the table against the disk, were in real shiny tin as if something had just polished them.
If this was what a broken heart truly felt like, Harry hoped he would never love another soul again.
Slowly blinking he opened his eyes to see Neville stand beside his bed. Placing his glasses firmly on his nose, he got up.
His hands, clothes and hair were slowly seeping down his body and soiled his couch. The tiny drops prickled him uncomfortably and irritated he dragged a hand down his face and up through his hair. Thinking of the last time he and Draco had been stuck outside in the rain, brought painful memories forth. Draco had been so annoyed since it had ruined his hair, but Harry had said he looked cute. Draco – who denied this to ever have happened- seemed to brighten and tint a slightly pink blush. Harry having noticed this and pointed it out was quickly kissed to shut up. The passion of that kiss had seemed unreal at the time. To this day, Harry couldn’t believe you could fake that kind of feeling.
He looked quite uncomfortable and she didn’t want to push him. After everything that had happened, it didn’t seem wise to test his patience. No matter her divided opinion of Malfoy, Harry was important to her. Although she couldn’t help the nagging feeling that this had something to do with the Slytherin.
Blaise just shook his head. “I believe I shall spend this year on something more progressive than a puerile bet.” Looking out the window Blaise loudly noted that they were almost at the train station. Collecting themselves the Slytherins started getting up.
Harry had to bite his cheek from the pain of seeing him. Looking into the gray steel eyes, he was overcome with homesickness and for a second, he could feel any anger melt away. Malfoy was paler than usual, his eyes seemed dull and desperate. And then it passed. Malfoy had passed him, and the moment was over. Harry had to remind himself of his self-worth to keep from reaching out.
Jason just mumbled something, but even though he sat right next to him, Harry wasn’t able to hear it. Complaining so, Jason sighed.
“No, Harry, I was wrong.” The tearful teen looked at her for the first time. “I should have trusted you. Even if… even if it turned out badly, I should have supported you when you decided to give someone a second chance.”
Blaise hadn’t even blinked before a larger hand had twisted around his wrist and pulled him into a passionate kiss. And so, five Slytherins were left in the middle of a staircase picking up their jaws from the floor. Had Draco not seen it with his own eyes he would never have believed it. Knowing how his friend felt about public affection it was a big step for Blaise to even bump shoulders or as much as touch another person.
No longer hungry, Harry continued to play with his food, waiting for his friends to finish. He knew he hadn’t been eating as much as he should have, but for most of the time, his appetite seemed to settle for less. If he could get a few bites down, he would be good to go until dinner at least. Not even his favorite dessert treacle tart could tempt him anymore.
“Shit,” Seamus got up, taking the last of his cinnamon bun in one hand. “I still haven’t finished wrapping m presents.”
“My eyes haven’t always been different colors. But all of a sudden my right eye was a warm hazel color, and I was scared. I was terrified. I had a panic attack for the first time in my life and the friendly auror, whom were still in my house, helped me calm down. Since she was the only ‘friend’ around me, I ended up telling her everything. About my father’s picture, the suspicion of illegal potionmaking and my eye’s sudden change. I could no longer hold it together and I just sat there crying while she held me.”
“The present…” Draco looked him directly in the eyes and Harry awkwardly stared at his chest, blushing. “It was wonderful.” He whispered.
Walking out of the infirmary, Harry thanked whoever was listening that Jason was better. Although it didn’t seem like the scars across his face had completely healed yet, it was a huge improvement already.
“Please sir,” Harry begged. “I know you don’t like to discuss my parents-“ Snape scoffed. “-but you are the closest person whom I have left except Remus and… I haven’t heard from him in weeks.”
“This is for you.” The taller boy handed him a small flat present with a blue ribbon and silver lining. “I’m sorry I didn’t send it or give it to you before we left, but with everything…” he let off.
provoked, sir. But I am truly, truly sorry for my behaviour.” Blaise just grabbed his hand harder and gently stroked it.
The recognizable bell rang as he stepped inside the shop. An older couple sat in the back with each of their papers, completely ignoring his presence. There was no line at the register as Lauris came out from the back.
Entering the empty classroom, the Gryffindor was surprised to see Remus already sitting at his desk, correcting papers.
“Oof.” Harry groaned as his back hit the cold wall. Draco refused to take a second glance around. No, it wasn’t exactly a romantic spot snogging beside a toilet, but he was at his wits end.
“I did no such thing!” Harry had to clench his fist under the table, digging his nails into his palms to keep from yelling at the younger girl. “I never once said we would be together.”
“He was in his right to hate me for what I did to him.” Remus cleared his throat.  “Either way, it is in the past and I’m truly grateful we can still work in the same place without him bringing it up at every time we see each other.”
Looking away from Lupin, he pondered if he should continue his story. If he was able to handle such vigorous memories coming back, all of a sudden. He had been so desperate when he left that life behind and in it, apparently a pregnant man whom was now deceased.
So, when he noticed that Jason didn’t take the empty seat beside him during breakfast, he didn’t really pay attention to the usually loud teen. Eating the last of his honey melon, Blaise took the trip towards the classroom, alone. He was never truly alone at Hogwarts but he didn’t mind getting away from his fellow students every once in a while. Drama wasn’t a wanted activity in his every day, and unfortunately, Draco had a horrible habit of bringing it wherever he went.
The bird quickly crumbled under the pressure of warmth and a soon as the fire had died out, Harry blew the ashes of his desk. Harry didn’t really feel in the mood for researching anymore.
For once, Harry decided to be impulsive and without thinking further, he opened his mouth just slightly enough for Malfoy’s finger to slide in. Without breaking eye contact, he gave the finger a few tiny lick before wrapping his tongue around the digit. As he began truly licking the sweet taste of Malfoy’s finger, he watched the silver eyes almost turn completely black with lust as his pupils dilated.
The member twitched underneath him as Harry carefully grasped it in his hand. It was warm and firm. The cock was already oozing with clear liquid and Harry really wanted to try it.
“OOOH.” Pansy’s eyes practically feel out of her sockets in blinded glee. “Potter is there, you don’t say! May I join you?”
“Oh Mr. Potter! So generous and humble! Dobby would be honored to be standing behind him, yes, he would. To tell Mr. Potter about his life… it’s simply too much.” The elf cried, trying hard to keep the sobbing down. Using his left red glove, he wiped his eyes. Harry just smiled, used to the antics of the sensitive elf. And so, Dobby started telling about the kitchen and visiting some of his older family in Brighton. An uncle of his had taken him in for two days as his family allowed them to clean and cook together. Finishing his soup, Harry pushed the tray aside and Dooby snipped to make it disappear back to the kitchen.
“I just feel like we have to start over somehow. I can’t just pretend nothing happened.” He whispered and enfolded himself.
It had been almost two hours since Harry had joined and the firth time he had left to get fresh air. Getting back from the firth turn, he almost tripped over the tiny step when he heard a noise, ‘pop’. Hagrid suddenly looked up and both men hurried to the fireplace. Another pop, and another, until it sounded like someone was making popcorn. Inside the cauldron the egg twitched around, hitting the sides constantly.
“He never seems to have time to just talk… every time I have been in his personal quarters was to… feed and get yelled at. I just don’t think we have a lot in common.”
Ignoring him, Draco continued to take notes in the middle of Professor McGonagall’s sentence. He wasn’t even sure what they were discussing, but he refused to let Blaise have the satisfaction of seeing how much this little rumor bothered him. It wasn’t even true. Of course, he and Potter would go together, they were dating after all. That kind of indicated that all social events were handled together. Potter had probably misspoken to the wrong person and Blaise had only recited a half-assed rumor.
“Ah, that is a conversation for another day.” Remus replied. “For now, tell me, are you planning on going to the burrow this year?”
“Don’t. call. Him. That. He is nothing to me, but he is still a Slytherin and a person!” Blaise practically growled. Draco was sure he would show him teeth any second. The olive skinned boy turned back to watch the two new pals laughing together. Draco was stumped. Blaise usually never showed this much emotion towards anything. He was used to Draco’s temperament. And in the middle of the chaos, nothing could have prepared the pale teenager for the next event.
Hermione should have been used to Ron’s indifference towards school, but the witch still couldn’t help but roll her eyes and sent Harry a rather exhausted look.
Harry wanted so badly to say no, to stay strong and deny Draco the pleasure of once again taking something that was his. But no matter the consequences, he found himself nodding slightly. Draco’s eyes, still slightly glazed from tears, dilated slightly before he leaned down. Harry could only hear his own beating heart and the gentle puff of air from the man he loved, as his lips were gathered.
“Hermione, this was Snape, he is not exactly keen on Gryffindors, remember?” Hermione just huffed and turned back to eating even though it was obvious her cheeks were a slightly darker color.
The giant ignored him for a while as he grabbed a plate of what Harry assumed was Scottish dream cookies.  Although the color was slightly darker.
Trying to relax, the potion Professor found his mind concentrating on the smiling face of Lupin. Annoyed by the presence, he opened his eyes again. He refused to be sucked into that catastrophic event once more. Remus had once again left and he weren’t even sure if he had truly understood what had happened the second time before he left. No, the werewolf was already bound to another human being and Severus would never be a priority. He had his own priority now. Teaching the students had been a mediocre task but after years of believing he was alone, he had found out about his son.
And his determination blossomed. In the bookstore he found a great novel to Hermione about a muggle who grew up as the only wizard in the family. Harry was sure Hermione could use it to compare and analyze her own upbringing. He also found a newly edited album from Celestina Warbeck for Mrs. Weasley. The three teens had been to seven stores and heading for the eighth, when Harry asked them a question.
In the end, he had to admit defeat as Lauris had clearly had a bigger impact on him than he had come to care for. While they spent most of their days at Lauris’s house having sex, eating lunch at the beach or park, or in the shop talking, Severus found it to be a very pleasant way of life.
“No, really honey, it looks good!” Seamus went after him only to get the middle finger. Laughing at the pair, the others continued searching. Finally, after who knew how many, Harry pulled out a completely black suit with a black tie option. Pulling it out Harry notices the seams sparkled slightly*.
Panting quietly, Harry moved his hands up and into the blond locks. If it was even possible, his hair was even softer than his lips and Harry couldn’t help himself but weave his fingers into it.
Harry got the feeling Zabini wasn’t telling the truth but he couldn’t exactly demand to know was going on and he didn’t want to overstay his welcome before Malfoy even got back. So ignoring the uneasy knot in his stomach, he went back to reading, occasionally pausing to take notes. No one spoke again until Malfoy arrived.
been?! You should have been back in common room a long time ago. The curfew is ending soon and you promised to help Vera Fegatti with her runes homework, and for some reason she pestered me until I promised to drag you back!” Zabini snarled at him.
Picking up the discarded rolled up paper, he checked his watch to see if he had the time to skim it. Five minutes.
“Maybe you should sit down.” Dean tried to save them from an uncomfortable silence. Jason simply shook his head. “I’m almost late before it’s my turn so I should be ready.” Jason barely had time to finish his sentence as the door to the DADA classroom opened up. A beaming Hermione joined them, but she immediately changed when she saw the horrible state her classmate was in.
He obviously expected Severus to answer him and the taller young man tried to withhold his feelings of enjoyment.
The answer had been the obvious one he had told anyone who dared ask, and somehow it had become a reflex. Snape didn’t seem satisfied by the answer like everyone else did. His eyes narrowed and Harry squirmed under the dark glance.
As they left the corridor, Harry had to take another case of stairs, while Dumbledore had to walk to the left. Leaving his hand on his shoulder for a bit longer, the icy-blueyed man smiled.
“I’m sure that will be fine,” Dumbledore patted him on the back. “Oh, Severus, why don’t you join us?”
Ever the gentleman, the redhead simplemindedly stepped forward and flabbergasted. As the silence became slightly awkward, Dean punched the boy in the stomach.
This was without a doubt the most awkward conversation, Harry had ever had, including his date with Cho Chang in fifth year. Coughing, Malfoy tried again.
A few months ago, this point would have bothered Harry. Never again having to discover something rare or secret at nighttime in forbidden corridors. But now? He couldn’t wait to keep the focus on his homework and hopefully Malfoy. Speaking of which, he hadn’t seen him so far. He hadn’t been at lunch even though Harry strategically placed himself on the right side of the table this time.
Even though Harry didn’t see the appeal in a shell, it was certainly remarkable how the deep seablue stripes fondled the sapphire blue tone.
“Professor, I assure you, whatever you might think I’m interested in, concerning Potter, is absolutely nothing.” Draco explained. “In fact, the one thing I would like this year is to keep away from him so I can concentrate on my NEWTs. That is why you saw me talking to him before class. To keep… polite.”
But today, he would have Blaise all to himself for the entire day. None of his own friends nor Blaise’s; it would just be the two of them together.
A few days into September, the leaves had started to become orange and golden. The weather had already gotten colder, and Harry felt the need for his short-sleeved sweater almost every morning. Looking around the Great Hall whilst enjoying his breakfast, Harry noticed all the people he had barely spoken to last year. Since Harry hadn’t given much thought to his attraction towards men since the beginning of summer, he was finally able to stare at boys for real. Especially a boy from Ravenclaw had gotten his share of attention walking past the Gryffindor table just a few seconds ago, giving Harry a morning wave. To stop himself from looking after him, Harry desperately tried to concentrate on his breakfast.
“I. don’t.” He stretched. “I don’t like it when people act as though it’s any of their business. I hate it when they stare as if I’m a unicorn.”
He could already feel his blood pumping, hoping to achieve completion soon. The moment he felt the tight entrance slightly relax, he pushed his head against it.
Fearing Draco was about to give him a hissyfit, Harry tried to come up with an explanation. Unfortunately, before he even had had the smallest of ideas as to why he was attacked, Draco had already figured it out.
Everyone in the great hall immediately began whispering amongst each other. Hissing quick ideas of clothing and partners.
Seamus smiled cockily. “Sometimes, but we are usually more careful to place charm-“ Slapping him on the chest, Dean interrupted him.
“’member to keep your distance for a’while.” Hagrid grinned. “Spread out to your sides -a little more- can everyone see? Good, let’s begin.”
He took a deep breath feeling the harsh lump in his throat but refused to acknowledge its existence.
Storming in, he grabbed Malfoy by his collar which nearly pushed him to the floor in the haste. Everyone in class were looking at them as the three men came out. Harry couldn’t look anybody in the eyes, only imagining the horrible stuff they were quietly whispering amongst themselves. Getting back to the table where Jason looked rather worried and Zabini gave a chilling stare, Harry realized he had forgotten the honey once again.
Smiling slightly, she continued; “I’m glad. And now that it’s over, we can just go back to how things were.”
“Harry, good to see you man!” the ginger hugged the smaller boy close before Ron’s protest of acknowledgement came fourth.
For a long time, the professor stared at him, seemingly lost in thought. After an eternity, Snape sighed and rubbed his temples.  “Go to your room.” He sent him off with a casual wave of the hand.  Harry kept from commenting and went for the door. Just before he left, Snape stopped him once more.
“How has the first week been?” It wasn’t even over yet and Harry felt silly for asking. Malfoy was thankfully either unaware or didn’t care enough to point it out.
His parents could have seen the present he gave him and they were surely a giant influence on the teen.
Harry would love it if Draco had gotten him something for Christmas but he wasn’t the one whom had been describing their relationship as barely anything. He felt totally joyless as he listened to the excited murmurs around the hall. He and Ron still weren’t really speaking like they used to, and things were actually changing permanently between them. They had been fighting before but this one seemed rather final.
The sounds from downstairs became louder as though a small army was gathered to watch the blessed event.
“Escaping!” Lauris laughed as they continued. Severus was suddenly glad he had begun to duel as much as he had that year. He had never been the athletic-type and a few years back he would already have felt his lungs burning. The darkness must have hidden them from the streetlight, because soon the yelling stopped. Lauris suddenly pulled him into a swing, and they ran down a staircase that led them to a beach. The warm sand made its way into his tight round up shoes and he felt slightly uncomfortable as he trotted around in them. Finally Lauris stopped beside the stone wall towards the sea. Letting out a huge breath of relief he laughed and sat down in the sand. Looking up at Severus, he started pulling his hand, asking him to sit with him.
“Two of them.” Malfoy sounded smug as he always did when he bragged. “Greenland against Pakistan ended after one and half hour, so it kind of sucked, but the second, Japan against Russia, wow.”
Looking at the dragon once more, Harry finally felt the impact of the goodbye. Aodhan purred as Harry hugged him tighter around the neck. He felt the beating pulse against his chest and the roaring pure, vibrating. Hagrid continued to sob beside him, while Harry tried his best to keep the lump in his throat from escaping. He had watched the creature literally through his entire life. How did you say goodbye to that?
The students quietly hurried off the pitch and Jason looked down at his shoes while Zabini guided him by hand. Harry too felt quite ashamed. It had been really fun to have a make-believe battle, but it was true that the Quidditch field was off limits.  Draco subtly grabbed his hand, and the gang was completely silent for the rest of walk towards the castle.
“Yes, well, it had been some time since I had asked for company on Christmas eve. I suppose the attention was not completely unwelcome.”
“I live right down there.” Lauris pointed at narrow building. The red brick walls were fading slightly while the cement in between was dusting. The building was only two storages and very narrow but it seemed to be two different apartments.
Nodding, Harry vanquished the used tissue, picked up his bags and waved goodbye; Hurrying upstairs to change, as he refused to be sick in the infirmary on Christmas.
“Face it, Potter. You would be placed a thousand times in Hufflepuff before they would even consider letting into Slytherin.”
Slowly he approached the only occupied bed in the infirmary. Professor Snape was sitting beside his son, his stoic face keeping the usual calm exterior, but Harry couldn’t help but notice the two hands clutching a single pale one. Remembering the horrified look on Jason’s face Harry tried to stay positive.
As he sorted through his stuff, he didn’t see where he was going. With a pained ‘ugh’ he landed flat on his ass and the content in his bag flew across the floor. Embarrassed he hurried to collect his things when someone ‘accio’d most of it. Turning around he realized he had walked straight into Malfoy. ‘who else?’
A huge silence filled the almost empty room and Harry finally had time to think. His head barely hurt after the potion and his thoughts could gather whatever small memory he had of the accident. The unicorn had seemed very friendly and calm, so why had it suddenly flipped out? Looking back at Jason, he couldn’t help but wonder if something had ticked it off. Closing his eyes, he tried to push it aside for now. He was actually really tired…
“Well, Jason isn’t really like most of them, beside why does it even matter? He is nice and he even promised to help me with the History of Magic assignment.” Harry tried to reason with his redheaded friend.
“No, Draco, it isn’t the same… Everything is so messed up! I don’t even know when you started caring, if you ever did! I don’t know which Draco I fell in love with… and can’t look at you now without seeing the ‘you’... laughing with your friends, telling them about us, what we did… what I said to you… I feel…
Harry was unsure where on earth he got the confidence from, but he found himself teasingly touch Draco’s thigh and running his hand unbelievable close to his crotch. He involuntarily cheered as he could feel Draco shift excitingly under his warm hand.
“The only thing I should have done was ask him to hit you harder.” He furiously tore his shoulder away from the burning hand.
“When our parents are involved, it is most certainly real, Potter.” She failed to keep from sneering. “But yes, if Draco said ‘no’ then it isn’t going to happen.”
In fact, it had been quite pleasant to speak to him. The night unfortunately, had ended in a dreaded nightmare featuring his parents again. Harry had tried to push it away but the look on their faces had seemed so real. The anger, sadness, disappointment…
Jason didn’t really look surprised. “I see. Well that’s nice, he did seem rather fixated on you, so I suppose it makes sense.”
“You know why I left. Why… why I had too.” Lupin whispered in a regretting voice. “But I never wanted to-“
“How is that possible? Japan could barely qualify in the counter finals against France and Belgium. What happened?”
Sighing, Blaise tried to negotiate. “I’m not saying we have to fuck in the middle of a forest, but we can do some stuff, can’t we?”
For a long minute, they merely watched the other, soaking in each others’ presence as if they hadn’t spent almost seventh years practically living together. Draco looked no different than usual, but somehow Harry had missed the smaller details about him. The way his hair glowed in moonlight, lightest patch of freckles across his neck and the steal grey eyes piercing through him.  In the next second, Draco almost ran towards him and used both his hands to tilt Harry’s face towards him. Their cold lips met in a desperate motion and Harry tried not to wince when he felt the scolding tongue enter his mouth. Their breath entangled and Harry had no choice but to hang on to Draco’s shoulders, trying to keep his legs from buckling.
“Shit.” Draco cursed and they hurried to correct their clothing and hair, well, Draco did. Harry had given up years ago on his mop of hair and it would most likely look the exact same as always. As they left the dark tower, the professor was waiting for them at the bottom of the stairs.
Malfoy looked... different today. Up close, anyway. Perhaps it was the fact he didn’t look at harry like he was about vomit. He almost looked
Severus simply nodded his consent and sat down once again, after making sure the headmaster had settled in the couch.
Finally, the train had come to a stop and the students departed. A lot of their friends and some he barely knew by name, waved hello. Many students also ignored him, but he tried to focus on the friendly faces he had missed during the Holiday.
Feeling defeated, Harry nodded without further argue. He quickly tried to straighten his wrinkled robes since he had slept in them and preformed a mediocre
“I never wanted to marry her, Harry. But I didn’t want to hurt her anymore. She was still my friend…”
He doubted the Lord would be very accepting on this development. Beside he would wish to know why he wanted to stay and staying because of a muggle - and a male one at that – was not an option.
Blaise almost hissed at him to be quiet. Looking over his shoulder, Draco realized their head of house was wandering around, handing out their schedule for the semester. When Professor Snape passed Draco’s along, he hesitated.
“Oh please- just last night you practically fell out of your chair as Oliver picked up the book he dropped on the floor.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“I understand.” Draco nodded. “I don’t think I would be either, but raised properly….” He left the conclusion of his childhood in the air.
“I’m sorry, but you have to taste this. It’s really good.” He smiled. And a very attractive one at that.
Draco almost felt guilty. Clearly, Blaise cared more for the tall Slytherin than he let on. Making sure no one was watching them, Draco discreetly placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. Blaise made no indication of noticing him but did not bother to shake him off, which for Draco meant he wasn’t mad at him anymore. The rest of the class they touched shoulders but otherwise concentrated on their assignment.
Potter was about to respond, when an angry red head practically tackled past him and brought Potter along.
The wolf sighed as he explained. “Harry it was the middle of the seventies’. Adults and teens at that time feared the shame and the obvious hatred that came with being homosexual. Adults were assaulted on the open street for kissing a member of the same sex. Certainly, no student would ever admit to it at that time. It was simply… experimentation. A way to seal yourself away from a life as an outcast.”
Two hands grabbed his hair and he almost flinched from the tugging on his roots. Keeping up the pace, he sucked him off as he continued to circle the wrinkled hole. Familiarizing himself with each and every bump, he carefully inserted the finger.
Almost attacked Draco had to support himself against the wall as Harry flung his arms around his neck and kissed him. Their teeth bumped and it hurt slightly, but it was worth the enthusiasm sinking in through the lips.
“You’re kidding!” Harry felt the grin on his face split. “You’re coming back to Hogwarts? For real?” Remus laughed at the childlike wonder.
Looking across the hall, he could see Malfoy enjoying his breakfast. Considering everything, Malfoy wasn’t exactly the type of person you brought home to your parents. Not that he would ever be able to, but Harry could certainly pick a boyfriend whom his parents would possibly approve of. Hmm…
“Some tea, perhaps?” Albus suggested. Not even waiting for his potion Professor to answer he called upon an elf from the kitchen.
Leaning against the railing, Jason looked as the hills surrounding them turned white. Harry was rather curious as to what could be so important they had to discuss it up here.
“It’s okay,” Harry smiled. “I trust Draco. I’m sure it’s nothing either way. But I would still like to know.”
As it was still early during the schoolyear, most of their dueling lessons had consisted of smaller hexes and counter curses. Today was no different.
“I’m not, okay?” he looked anywhere but at their teasing faces. “Honestly, we haven’t even… well I haven’t ever really…”
Time flew by and before he even noticed it – probably because of all the time spent in the library – the insignificant small patches of snow had melted and daffodils were sprouting. It was still too cold to sit outside for longer study periods but Harry and Draco took advantage and took walks further away from the castle, hoping to enjoy the light sun in private. Birds were starting to appear again, and Draco wondered why he had never taken notice before. If only the sun was slightly warmer, then it would be the perfect day to sit around.
Harry felt a stone dropping into his stomach. Had Malfoy seen them leave together and therefore followed them down here? Had he overheard their conversation? Him, being a Slytherin and even more for being a Malfoy, it was certainly a possibility. Harry knew he had to be causes now.
“The only reason I would be jumping off the tower would be to hit you at the bottom!” Ron yelled back, both of them ignoring Harry.
“Jay… god! I’m gonna cum, naAh!” Jason quickly pulled out to get a finger wet before hurrying back to the desperate mess laying in front of him. He couldn’t believe this gorgeous creature could feel so good around him, in him. Jason knew he was close, even without the warning. The member in his mouth pulsed and bounced against his tongue. Not wishing to let this rare opportunity go to waste, he used his hands and pulled the pants further down, until he could sneak in a finger beneath the cock. Trying to keep from touching the balls, he instantly headed for the wrinkled temple of pleasure. He wished to touch it so badly, knowing he could store it as masturbation material for weeks.
“You’re freezing. Now, hand out.” He ordered. Harry obeyed and felt slightly lightheaded. He had never worn a piece of clothing that belonged to Malfoy. Knowing his fingers were covered by fabric which Malfoy’s hands had been in, was weirdly intimate and a very surprising turn of event. Harry had never seen Malfoy share anything off his, let alone his clothes. After readjusting the gloves a few times – since Harry hands were kind of small for them – Malfoy let him go.
Thankfully, Harry didn’t give a girlish whine but he was certainly close. Right behind the third row, a small counter stood and behind it, a broad backed old man leaned over it.
Harry really didn’t care. He tried to remember what Dumbledore had said about unity. If he could befriend one Slytherin, then perhaps he could befriend another. He would definitely remain open minded.
Jason thanked the group for the offer but as already heading for some chess play in the dungeon. Nodding understandingly the Gryffindors’ headed upstairs, while Harry stayed to chat.
“But I guess,” Harry smiled goofily.  “IF I should say it, I don’t think it would be very far from now.”
He had just had his first real kiss with a man, and to top it off, it was with Draco Malfoy. The kiss had been incredible. Harsh, yet passionate. He could have sworn his lips were still tingling. Wherever the Slytherin had touched him had left a warm print. On his face, his back and chest.
As Harry laid back down, he watched the body in the next bed move. Jason was asleep and had apparently been moved since Harry feel asleep. Right now, he was laying on his side with his back turned to Harry.
Harry tried not to squirm under the intense attention and almost whined when he failed to pull the Slytherin close to him again. A bit of the whine must have escaped him, as Draco shushed him and pulled further away. Looking around he suddenly laughed and Harry confused by the distraction, followed his eyesight. The second he realized what it was, he started laughing a well.
“Mr. Potter,” Dumbledore asked. “Do you believe Tom would have changed if he had found love here at Hogwarts?”
He must have noticed the crackled grin on Harry face, because he quickly enquired about his feelings for Draco.
Loud claps of running feet across the marble floor met him and he turned to watch Harry run towards him. Hs overcoat was fallen half off his shoulder and he was heaving for air.
Realising Snape was no longer walking beside him, Harry turned around. Against the door to the infirmary, Snape was leaning heavily. He was massaging the bridge of his immense nose, seemingly forgetting Harry was standing only few feet in front of him. The Gryffindor stepped close enough to lie a hand on his shoulder, showing whatever comfort it might bring.
Even though there was still another month and a half until Christmas, Snape despised the month of November. The dungeons as well as his rooms had a constant cold demeanor and no matter how many heating spells one used, it could never replace the real heat from a roaring fire or the natural warmth from the sun.
“I’m sure you’ll find the energy when it revolves around him. After all, having found his mate so young it probably won’t be too far into the future to expect grandchildren.” Remus teased.
“I don’t know,” Dean sarcastically drummed a finger against his lip. “Maybe because half of our classes are
“Shall we?” Draco lent him an arm that Harry gratefully accepted. He never knew where to place his arms or how to move correctly, when you entered fancy places and festivities. The violins and cellos got louder as they finally entered the magically enhanced hall.
The truth was in fact quite different. Harry and Draco hadn’t really been able to get much time alone since they started dating. Beside classes, homework and hanging out with their separate friend groups, the two boys had rarely had time to be alone. While talking and being out was great, sometimes they required meetings that were a bit more… discreet. They were after all two teen boys and Harry couldn’t help but think about sex every single time Draco smiled at him.
Malfoy sighed deeply. He looked away from him and kept his eyes on the dark forest in front of them. Harry looked away as well, realizing it was easier for both of them to talk this way. After five years with the Slytherin boy, Harry had learned a few things, watching from afar. Malfoy was a stubborn creature. Everything beside glory and material matters were difficult for him to speak of. Pushing him wouldn’t give him any answers. Harry wasn’t sure how long they sat beside each other just looking at the forest. The wind moved the tress as if they were dancing. Shadows shaped by the light, shinning from the moon, made the illusion of a waving sea across the land.
He waited for most of the students to walk past him. A smaller group of girls – probably fourth years’ – smiled and giggled as they passed him. It felt like forever as he awkwardly waited for Malfoy to step by. Finally, the Slytherins started passing and the group gave him very weird looks as he tried to ignore them.
The rest of the class, Harry was determined to keep his eyes on the front. Even though Malfoy could piss him off, he did not want to press his luck and find out what Malfoy would send him back after he showed him his middle finger. Harry had never done that before, beside to his friends in witty banter. He didn’t know what came over him, but for whatever reason, Malfoy always brought out the worst in him.
“I understand.” And Harry really did. “I wondered SO many times what my life would be like if I had just been Harry.”
“You have so many qualities I admired… moral, stubbornness, ethic… everything that made up for all the shit you pushed me through. But it isn’t enough anymore.”
But they did unfortunately worry his boyfriend. Harry had insisted on entering the training Healers program this summer and while his friends kept insisting any subpart healer school would accept him, Harry insisted to be accepted because of his talent, and not based on his status. Therefor Draco found himself without his boyfriend for many nights of the week. Although he was very understanding of Harry’s need to prove himself and gracefully accepted the many hurried apologises from his lover, Draco couldn’t control his desperately need for Harry’s body. It had taken him months to finally get Harry into his bed and they had only just had sex a few weeks ago. For Merlin sake! He was a healthy seventeen-year-old man.
“He needs to be turned over every three hours as his mother would move him. Would you like to turn him?” Harry could recognize his animal loving friend again. The excitement shone through his eyes as a child on Christmas day. Agreeing, Hagrid handed him just a single oven mite, as both of his hands could fit into it. Leaning over, Harry carefully pushed his hands underneath the egg.
If Potter had figured out that Draco had held him up, deceived him, was it possible the golden boy had told Jason? They were friends of sort, at least Jason had said so, but enough for Potter to reveal such a sensitive matter? Humiliating even.
“Perhaps.” Severus felt slightly better although he would never admit it to the pushy wolf. “I just feel like a have no energy left anymore for teaching. His life is barely beginning and I… I wish to be a part of it.”
someone I dated while I was in Australia. He has lived there his entire life and offered to show me around. He was sweet and hot, so I agreed. We spend an enormous amount of time together, almost every day, for three weeks.” Blaise could finally look him in the eyes again. “Unfortunately, I accidently meet his aunt, whom he had lived with for a while.”
“Easy. I’m going slowly, okay?” Harry didn’t stop biting his lip but simply nodded in consent. The burn continued but after what felt like an eternity, his ass met with Draco’s pelvis. Leaning over him, Harry moaned as Draco kissed him across the back and his neck.
Dumbledore lifted a hand, asking them to calm down before he turned to face his student.  “Harry, while I appreciate you wanting to support your friend, I must ask you to leave the teachers and I alone for this conversation.”  Harry started to protest but a big hand on his arm told him it was alright to leave. A smaller sterner hand grabbed him around the collar, dragged him outside, and pushed him back on a bench. Glancing up he saw the scolding face of his potion professor.
“My love, where have you been?” Jason reached out a tanned hand to wrap around the waist of the new arrival. Harry could only stare in surprise from the sideline as Zabini struggled to free himself from the grip of the much stronger boy. Trying to kiss his cheek, Jason was cut off by a dark hand closing over his mouth. If Harry hadn’t been so bewildered by the silly fight, he would have been rather amused.
The atmosphere and the desperate way Lupin uttered his name, made him feel somehow anxious and right now, he longed for the peace and quiet Christmas’ he remembered.
Theodore Knott had come back to Hogwarts as well, but Draco hadn’t been worried he wouldn’t. The Knotts’ had never been an openly supportive group of dark arts, but what they lacked in dark arts, they made up for in connections, money and knowledge. Even if it killed Draco to say so, he knew the Knotts were a few generations older than the Malfoys.
“Fine. Mother brought her new husband with us this time. She seems different with this one. Almost giddy.” He scrunched up.
“Actually… I don’t think I have much to do before lunch…” Harry teasingly pulled at his tie, showing them towards the entrance and what Draco soon realized was the nearest broom closet.
“I guess.” Harry was still thinking. “You know what, there is one thing you can do, if you are really serious about changing?”
Slowly he let go of her hand, feeling more empty than he imagined he would. But he realized by letting go, he wasn’t just saying goodbye to a marriage. He was letting go of a future where he would have stayed good friends with his father, maybe getting his own children someday. Everything he had imagined his life would be like for so long, would pass by when he went the other way. But it was barely anything compared to what he could gain. So letting go, he gave a final smile to the crying woman before leaving.
“Have you any idea how to even begin talking to him? You are not exactly on civil speaking terms.” Blaise stated as he kept eating his egg benedict.
Even though the Professor had been a master spy and had practiced his poker face for years, Harry was still able to see the slight change in his demeanor.
Keeping that in mind, Harry thought about Christmas with Remus. He was honestly hoping for their Christmas to be absolutely perfect, together. Maybe he would be able to see Jason as well. Hopefully, if he decided to speak to Snape before the train was boarding.
Potter whom had been standing behind him, seemed to silently agree and headed after the potion master in quick march.
The last thing they heard was McGonagall being informed to contact him whenever the team of Dragonalogists would arrive.  As Harry went towards the classroom, he watched the back of Hagrid as he retired. The handkerchief was pulled up once more from the giant’s pocket and a loud blow was delivered. Making his way further into the hall, students started gathering around him. The sounds of idle chattering and annoyingly unimportant conversations only lead him to feel even more alone.
It didn’t happen often, but this time Severus was deadly wrong. The sweetness was there but hidden inside was a tiny amount of salted caramel that spread across his taste buds. He almost moaned when the powdered sugar laid a small extra vanilla taste on top of it. It was delicious. He took another bigger bite this time and then another. In the end, he had completely forgotten where he was when he sucked a single digit free of sugar.
Harry got his things and settled on the small corner of Snape’s desk. For a second it looked like the professor was about to object, before he continued to write. Harry was careful to be as quiet as possible, as he started his own notes on Herbology. Besides the scratching of the quills against parchment the two men sat in comfortable silence. Harry had worried Snape at some point would have had enough of him dipping his pen in the ink too much or commented on the way he licked his finger every time he turned a page, but nothing. Snape kept quiet the entire time and when it was time for Harry’s next class, he simply thanked the professor again. However, right before he closed the door, Snap called after him. Turing around the man looked conflicted.
“Oh, right! Sorry.” Harry agreed. “Jason, these are my friends Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan-“ He introduced the boys as they shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. “-And this is Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.” The 2/3 parts of the golden trio only nodded their heads in acknowledgment. Trying to ignore the almost touching-awkwardness their cold greeting had created; Harry hurried and asked the group to head for the breakfast hall.
“Sure, Luna, if you really want to.” Harry perplexed answered the bubbling blonde girl. “That reminds me…” Making sure Professor Flitwick was looking in the other direction; he quickly ripped off a tiny corner of his parchment and wrote a note.
“It goes without saying that no one in this room will tell others of this bet.” Draco sneered, looking around every single person in the compartment. Crabbe and Goyle quickly nodded their agreement, while Blaise just shook his head in amusement.
Harry must have had a worrisome expression on his face, because the teen laid a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“I will try this time, I promise I really will! I was… it was hard to imagine you together, but I can see now I was wrong.”
Potter couldn’t answer him but opened his eyes wide. Seeing the lust crazed eyes, having almost darkened the emerald colour, Draco frenzied. He was so close…
As Harry went downstairs, Theodore must have noticed him, because he leaned in and whispered something to Draco, before the blond abruptly turned around. Aphrodite must have stolen his lungs because Harry couldn’t breathe. Standing in front of him was the descended of a Greek god. Draco had pulled back his hair as when they were children but this time, the hair didn’t make his look pointy and arrogant but rather distinguished. The silver eyes matched his suit perfectly and Harry almost laughed at the irony when he realized the Slytherin’s suit was almost identical to the one he had declined back in the store.
“Harry please-“ He heard Hermione calling him. Ignoring them he hurried up and tried not to slam the dorm door shut. Around him his friends were sleeping. The light snoring from Neville’s bed was unmistakable, considering it had accompanied the dorm for six years. Harry tried not to disturb the others as he got ready for bed and threw his shoes on the floor. Closing the curtain around the bed, he laid down and closed his eyes. Even though he was exhausted, thoughts and dreaded scenarios continued to roam around inside of him. Of course, he wasn’t for sure that Ginny had told anyone. She wasn’t a chatterbox nor a tattle tell, but that wasn’t the problem. Ginny had a tendency to hang around Parvati and Lavender. And those two girls spent more time with their mouths open than closed. Trying to force the almost nauseating feeling in his stomach to settle down, he kept breathing deeply.
The Professor’s face didn’t change for a second at the mention of the Marauder. He simply continued to drink his tea and Harry saw it as a good sign to keep talking.
“Heavens forbid.” Snape dropped his hand, but the tight lips did curl in a tiny smile. Just for a moment, before the students behind Harry came too close and he had to move along. Stepping down and joining his friends he sat down on the nearest chair, waiting for Hermione’s name to be called. Obviously, she graduated on top of class and McGonagall seemed proud to announce it was the first in many years since that honor had gone to a Gryffindor.
“Nothing, it just amazes me how much you’re eating this morning.” She snickered. “Perhaps also because you’re unusually….
As he rounded another corner, Harry was surprised to see the headmaster talking to some of the paintings.
“I know, but I promised we would hang out.” Draco gave him an apologetic kiss on the cheek. “Sorry babe.”
“’even bigger’? Do you know what the old coat is talking about?” Draco whispered behind his glass. Almost invisibly, Harry shook his head.
“Malfoy if you get the knives and gloves, Harry you get the ingredients, then I will get the fire started.” The two boys nodded in agreement and Harry headed for the table. Coming back with his hands full of jars, Zabini asked him to help Malfoy shred the Bartle wings and chop the Alistsky bark. Grabbing a knife, Harry stood silently beside the blond boy and started chopping. It was mostly quiet beside the occasional bubbling sounds from the cauldron, but Harry couldn’t help but feel it was kind of comfortable. They each had their part of the job and whenever Harry or Draco had finished an ingredient, they would slide it across the table where Zabini and Jason would collect it and use it at the right moment. Trying to concentrate on not cutting his fingers off, Harry tried his best to ignore the heat from Malfoy whenever he gently bumped his hip against his. It was so gentle and only happened when Malfoy reached for something in the middle of the table, so it could easily be passed off as accidental.
“Of course, you could.” Malfoy shrugged casually. “And if it looked like you couldn’t reach it, then I’m certain you would have used your wand a second later.” ‘Smug bastard’, Harry thought, fairly certain he was blushing now. Sometimes it sucked to have grown up muggle-raised. Magic wasn’t the single first thought that came to mind whenever a simple problem arose. But it was true that an
For a whole minute, Harry thought Jason was going to leave him right there, but thankfully his natural even temper stopped him and in the end, he gave in.
“Hey! We accept it, we just think they aren’t being honest about this whole… friendship.” Ron grimaced.
Jason didn’t answer yet. He wasn’t even sure he was heading in the right direction and he didn’t want Blaise to be disappointed in case he was wrong.
On the other hand, his son had been placed in Slytherin for a reason, so until further notice he would be keeping an eye on Jason’s interference with the new Professor. Emptying the last content of his mug, he placed the ceramic on the table.
The blond looked up with raised eyebrow as if Harry had interrupted him during an important case of work. Harry wasn’t even sure what to say, it wasn’t as if he didn’t wish to continue, he was simply nervous.
“Oh!” Harry suddenly realized, gathering the strong scaly head in his hands. “You did it! You can breathe fire now!”
Looking at his torn robes, he left it on the bed and sat down – reminding himself, he had to fix it later.
“Well, since it is none of my business where or should I say whom, you were with, then I suppose I won’t mention the fact that you have a so called ‘hickey’ forming on your neck.”
Still incredibly annoyed, the boys set out for Herbology. Today’s class hopefully wouldn’t demand too much attention because Draco certainly didn’t have any left for it. The rest of his house stood a good distance from the Hufflepuffs at the third greenhouse. This particular greenhouse was always overwhelmed with the powerful smell of mixed flowers. Even though there were no specific greenhouse for flowers, the third had always seemed the most overcrowded.
Blaise soon pulled away to breathe and Jason wasted no time and continued to bite his ear and neck, hoping to leave a hickey behind. As the air grew heavy around them, Blaise gasped in pleasure as he bit him on the juncture.
long distant cousin.” He waved a non-caring hand. “Either way, you can find our great grandparents related. It just so happened my grandmother immigrated to Sweden and was therefore not able to keep in contact. Thank merlin for small mercies.” He grinned behind his glass.
“Do you want to go and prepare for the next charm lesson after school? I can help you with the ones you forgot.”
“I’m sorry, love.” He kissed him gently. “I just want it to be the right time and not in the middle of a freezing forest.” He looked around.
The next month passed by in a haze. As January went by, the joys of winter and Christmas laid to rest and the teachers picked up another mood. ‘Prepare for your future’, ‘Where do you see yourself in ten years’ and ‘The final exams are near’ were their main ones. Professor McGonagall never seemed to let off. No matter what they were repeating or discussing, it somehow always led back to their careers. Draco wasn’t overly worried about the finals but he did have a clear idea of how much he would have to practice and read before they arrived. He had already changed more this year than his parents could possibly handle. If his grades became average in any way, his father would surely have a stroke.
“Right,” Hermione gave him another side-glance before pouring herself another cup of tea. “…all the dancing.”
“Well sir, very well indeed! Dobby has gotten a raise to two sickles a month AND two hours off every Sunday!” the proud elf claimed.
“No, it was…” What had his dream actually been about? Right now, being awake, everything seemed so dazed and foggy. Harry hated how dreams had a tendency to do that. When you were asleep everything made perfect sense, no matter how crazy it was. Could you fly? Normal. People turning into others? Of course. But as soon as you woke up, ‘puff’, you could barely find head or tail on anything. Thinking hard for a second, things began to dawn on him. His parents had been there, so had Malfoy… they had been standing next to each other and his parents had seemed so angry. So disappointed…
Harry choked on a mouthful of cookie and Remus had to pat him on the back, until the last bit of chocolate was gone.
As most of the Gryffindors now had a free period – except those who had chosen Aritmancy as an elective – Harry decided to go down and visit Hagrid. He hadn’t seen the giant beside in Care of Magical Creatures and even though he hadn’t missed breaking his teeth on cakes, he had truly missed the joyful bearded man.
Sitting down, Harry noticed the smell in the hall was different as well. Where it usually smelled of fresh bread and roasted beef, tonight was sweeter, sort of like a bakery. Seamus leaned over the table and told him Professor Dumbledore had insisted on celebrating the muggle’s International Pie Day.
The redhaired boy, looked like a little chipmunk with his cheeks puffing out from the mouthful of egg. In the end, he settled for a quick shrug.
“I don’t believe I asked you Lupin, and don’t ever believe yourself or your opinion to be valued from me.” He practically snarled. “You made certain of that long ago.”
Professor Dumbledore was sitting at the end of the table, wearing a rather big muggle festive hat. The red santa-hat was dangling of the back of his head although the small fuzzy white ball constantly fell into his food as he turned to speak with his colleagues. Harry had to remember to thank Dumbledore for the gift as well as professor McGonagall. Waving discreetly to Remus he had to remember the gifts in his room as they had decided to exchange gifts later back in Remus’ private quarters.
The last part was screamed so loudly, the crows beside them flew away in a haste. Draco watched as tears started streaming down her face. While she flicked her hand across her cheeks angrily, he gently reached out to comfort her. She slapped his hand away and stepped a few steps back.
“Hey.” Blaise came in, looking quite handsome in his dark azure suit. That was the one thing Draco was glad about this wedding; Blaise had immediately agreed to be his best man. “Just came to see how you were doing.” As the man entered the room, his bodyguard stood behind him, leaning against the doorway. He didn’t seem even remotely interested in being here and Draco was certain he was only here because Blaise had forced him. Tiny pale scars were still prominent on his face and left hand, but his hair covered most on his forehead nicely.
Thank you for all the support this story has gathered! I’m so grateful for every review, even a simple ‘good story’ has truly made my day.
Continuing to eat in peace, Draco imagined what the best scenario for asking Potter out, would be. He didn’t actually know that much about the boy, except he was brash and had a tendency to get into trouble. Most importantly, Potter’s friends were a bunch of idiots. Beside the bushy haired mudblood. Draco hated himself for even thinking it but she and him had tied two years in a row for scoring most points in their finals. Of course, this only happened because the teachers favorited the mudblood to look more divers.
This time, he trembled as he took the letter. The Dark Lord had personally written a letter to him. He hadn’t even so much as looked at him since the initiation. A small black waxed shield held the letter together. He firmly held on to it as he bowed and once again took his place. He carefully glanced at his friends seeing both the envy and curiosity shining in their eyes.
“Harry.” For the second time that night, Snape placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. It wouldn’t seem like much but for someone like Harry whom had never felt the loving touch of a parent it was enough to break him. Sobbing like a child, he tried to gather himself.
“What were you two talking about?” Normally such a question would have been asked out of simply curiosity, but knowing Hermione, Harry decided to ignore her, as it would only lead them into a new discussion. Instead, he said ‘hello’ and sat down on the other side of Neville, picking up a ham and cheese sandwich as he did.  Neville with a face full of chicken asked what was going on. Smiling at the teen, Harry told him about him and Draco going to the dance together. Again, he chose to ignore the strong-willed girl on his right as he clearly heard the scoffed voice; “-Still won’t listen to reason…”
“In a way.” Draco went to open the bottle. “We’re in La Rochelle. This is my room in the manor where we spent the summer.”
It didn’t take more than a couple before Harry too shook and groaned as he slumped against the stall.
“No thanks, Parkinson. In fact far from it, considering whom I was outside by the lake with last night.”
It seemed so weird and incredibly uncomfortable to cry in front of another person. Especially his teacher. Yet… if he had to ask for help at any given point during this year – no matter how little he wished to do it – then perhaps it was time now. Trying to gather what courage and strength he had left, Harry finally said;
Then he roared. Unlike the normal preteen state of the common dragon, this roar continued even further than Harry had ever expected and with it; fire.
For a second Draco felt horrible having left Pansy to deal with all four of them on her own. But he trusted her ability to know what she needed to do. She was a tough woman, she would be alright after the first blow was over.
What curse could possibly how caused such damage? Blaise had heard of potions and hexes that could turn you to complete stone, some that turned you to porcelain but never had he seen one that broke your body as IF it was made of porcelain.
“-That is why he became so obsessed with you from the second you bumped into him. Had you been one-step behind, it would have been the Weasel or Longbottom, whom would have had the pleasure of getting stalked.”
“Okay Parkinson, you are speaking in riddles.” Harry rubbed his face. “What does this have to do with us?”
Snape did not look convinced but thankfully he had a soft, or at least a less rough spot for Jason and Harry would have liked to think Snape had changed his opinion of him as well.
Harry shrugged and turned back to restlessly flipping through his book, making sure to look busy in case Professor Binns came by.
‘That‘s just great’. Malfoy tried not to look too exhausted and annoyed. Dealing with Snape was never easy, but the best strategy was to remain calm and collected.  Letting his companions know they could go on without him, Draco sat back down in his chair.
Steadily set on ignoring them, Potter got into the carriage from the other side. When the cart was loaded with students, it slowly went into motion and an uncomfortable silence settled. The ride would only take ten minutes tops but it was without a doubt the most silenced moment in Draco’s life. As if everyone tried to breathe carefully, so as not to make too much noise. Draco looked out the window, realizing it was starting to rain. Enormous wet drops smashed against the small windows. A gentle cough turned his attention to Theodore, who not so subtly tilted his head towards Potter. Right. He supposed that now was as a good time as any to start easing the tension between them.
Handing Severus, a cup of black tea, Albus took his time filling his own with sugar and what appeared to be half a carton of milk. Severus involuntarily suppressed a shudder at this creation, as if it had anything to do with real tea.
Finally walking, Seamus dropped his hand to his and pulled him back. Four boys now stood in front of him. Two who looked rather concerned, one who looked unsure and a fourth who seemed ashamed.
“You just seem a little too interested in Potter these days. Are you perhaps… falling for him?” Theodore teased him. Rather unusual for the quiet boy to make any form of mockery, but none the less, Draco certainly wouldn’t let him off the hook by the indication.
Draco waited until Potter had turned around before dropping the smile. A strange feeling was lowering over him as he watched Potter walk away from him. It wasn’t an angry nor an annoyed feeling, but it was more like… he didn’t know. It simply didn’t feel good watching Potter leave after they had just kissed. A rather great kiss, at that. The golden boy was actually starting to pick up the skill.
Oh. Had Harry really been that far off? His confusion was clearly written across his face, ‘cause the no response made Jason laugh, double.
“Watch it Potter, I will still kick your ass even outside the field.” Malfoy sneered, while Harry leaned back his head and laughed. This was actually nice. Talking like normal teenagers. Not having to worry about anythin.
Turning his head like an owl, Ron must have finally seen what he was searching for because he quickly dodged to the left and Harry was now close enough to see what he had found. He could recognize the blond haired head anywhere.
“Oh.” Harry looked around the table. “Sorry, I most have forgotten it. I will just go get it.” Zabini only nodded, as he was counting the clockwise turns the potion needed.
Distracting himself had worked enough the whole day and now Harry had fallen into the abyss where Draco -the posh twat- was king of making him depressed. His eyes stung and before he had gotten a hold of himself, the drops of rain had become warm tears. Sniffling he moved over and turned on the tv. Desperately he searched around until he found a comedy he had never heard of. Anything that could make him smile a little would be a godsent. It did work, slowly. This guy named Michael and most of his employees seemed rather consent in their little bubble of an office. It was a bit much with all the loud noises, but some guy named Jim and a rather peculiar fella named Drew was a rather funny pair. A few chuckles had managed to leave his lips when he felt his wards vibrate. He could feel the magic inside him curl and the recognition of other wizards or witches. Only his friends had access without setting them off.
Looking into the mortar, he was surprised nothing had happened. The claws lay exactly as they were before. Not a single little scratch or dust had been made. Putting the pestle back into the bowl, Harry tried using both hands this time. After almost sitting for five minutes he started sweating lightly again. Beads of condescension was gathering on his over lip. But the effort bore fruit. The claws wasn’t completely turned to dust but it gave out and turned to smaller grinded clippings. Overly slowly, it turned to dust and when Harry went to put it into another clean vial, his hands were raw. He wouldn’t be surprised if he found a few blisters by tomorrow morning. Looking rather discouraged at the vial filled with clippings, Harry decided to only make a few, each night. That way he would, hopefully, be able to finish before Christmas and keep his hands intact. Checking his old watch, he noticed there was still at least an hour before dinner began. Since he was sweating, so much he should probably have a shower before leaving.
“Can we speak for a moment?” a smaller hand grabbed his shoulder, sinking sharpened nails into his collarbone. Turning slightly, he wasn’t the least surprised to see Pansy standing behind him.
“Harry!” a lunately hand waved above the heads of a few Ravenclaws. Walking around the group, Harry saw Colin Creevy stand amongst some of his friends. Thankfully, the young man hadn’t brought his camera with him. Waving back, Harry figured he’d better go and say hello.
Later that evening, after the boys fell asleep, Harry pulled on his cloak and went to visit the prefects’ bathroom. Inside the large marbled room, everything was quiet and slightly cold. The eggshell colored walls and floor echoed any sort of noise, such as Harry naked feet. The mosaic mermaid on the large window laid gently over her rock sleeping. Her tail was harmonically slowly waving back and fourth in the water. Harry turned on the pipes of the multicolored waters and soon a hot-bubbled bath of purple water and lily-scented, stood ready for him to dive in.
The tiny creature frowned her non-existing eyebrows at him, probably finding it odd for a student to send a Professor a load of presents.
As Draco moved down, Harry tried to breathe deeply. Embarrassed by how loud he was being when Draco had barely even started touching him. The sound of Draco’s wet lips moving along his throat was incredibly arousing and Harry felt his member twitch, trapped underneath the pale firm body on top of him.
“Well, I guess Ron is just a little sensitive, thinking you an egotistic asshole who never cares about anyone except himself!” The hissing sound leaving him might as well have been in parseltongue.
“Maybe he didn’t want to hurt yeh. Maybe the whole idea of being casual is easier for him to make everyone happy.”
“Well, most wolves usually bite their mate. It is a special bite, that usually occurs when they are in love or at least have found a respectable mate to carry their cubs. I never believed I would need to worry about such animalistic behavior when I was in Hogwarts. I was never around humans when I was a wolf and had no intentions of finding a ‘mate’ in any way.”
“There is another reason why I wanted him to supply me. It is one of the few excuses I have to talk to him.”
“Well, I…” stopping himself, the strawberry blond boy shook his head. “Sorry, I don’t want to be the cause of any misunderstandings.” Gathering a glass from a drifting tray, he offered Harry, one.
Feeling tired all of a sudden, Harry didn’t bother to correct her, and the pair stood together in comfortable silence, watching as more and more families disappeared through the gates of Hogwarts.
He could storm out and find Draco. Hex him to pieces and not give a shit who saw. He could quietly leave Hogwarts and never come back, just disappear into the night. But no matter how much anger pierced him the one other emotion that had grabbed its hold on him was shame.
As the Professor proceeded to tell the class about the Flutterby bush - which had bloomed- Draco tried to keep his focus on her instead of the flower. Looking at the blooming bush, the blood red flower almost breathed. If Draco kept his eyes on a single flower, he could see the petals move in and out from the centre. Potter would probably like this flower as well, considering the Gryffindorish color. Reaching out he almost touched a flower.
On the front of the daily profit, a huge magical photograph had taken front page and familiar faces smiled at him as they quietly moved their mouths in chatter. On the left he saw Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy standing straight beside each other as they looked towards the middle of the photo. And there, in the middle stood the reason for his pain; arms linked, Parkinson had a strong grip on the pale muscular arm clad in dress robes as Harry saw his ex, smirking at the camera and returning the look of horrible adoration of the woman. A woman, whom by what Harry had read about months ago, was now expected to be called his wife. A word that sparked jealousy and bitterness through him. He knew it was completely irrational but somehow it felt like betrayal all over again.
Snow was covering the Hogwarts grounds and Harry had to lift his legs higher for each step, as the amount of snow only got bigger and bigger on the way to Hagrid’s hut. He was alone and on his way to see Aodhan. It had felt way to long since he had seen his little friend that weren’t, in fact, so little anymore. Dragons grew the first two years at a rapid pace. They almost reached full height within the first year and then simply gained weight and experience during the next decade.
It must have been obvious how he was hitting himself over the head inside his mind, because Malfoy only chuckled; “Poor Potter, never got a clue.” He teased.
“What? You wanted the bet. Of course, the second the golden boy goes out with anyone, someone will notice.”
“Potter, while I know how much you value Miss Granger’s help and you cannot sit on the floor, I suggest you take a seat at the front.” Snape drawled.
“Mr. Malfoy I believe it is time for you to head for the common room. Mr. Potter needs to rest.” She said strictly and they knew it wasn’t simply a suggestion. In a gentler voice, she reminded Zabini as well, and the two Slytherins left together. But not before Malfoy leaned close to steal a last kiss and whisper; ‘We need to talk.’
“I don’t want to go.” Hating how much like a child he sounded, Harry stuck to it. He didn’t feel like seeing his friends right now. Didn’t feel like discussing his whereabouts last night. And he certainly didn’t feel like looking at the smirking asshole to an ex-boyfriend.
After almost three hours, he had gotten a present for everyone on his list, except one for Snape and Draco. Normally, he wouldn’t have bought a gift for Snape but he had been really helpful this year and saved his ass through most of his life. Besides, Jason was his friend and Snape was his father, so just like he bought something for Molly and Arthur, he felt like he should buy something for him as well.
“Not so much worry,” Harry continued. “More… aware of their lack of presence. I just wondered if the few that stayed back has changed their mind or at least their attitude towards muggles and halfbloods.”
“While we won’t punish you for endangering the school and therefor wont have to involve the schoolboard-“ Snape snorted in disdain. “But we will punish you for keeping a creature in captivity where it didn’t belong and for keeping a secret wellaware of the consequences. You will have detention for the remaining of the months and will be kept from leaving Hogwarts grounds for the rest of the year. Meaning, no more trips to Hogsmeade.”
