Harry blinks in surprise.
”You stay out of it, Snivellus!” Sirius barks back.
”PLEASE!”
” They hear Ginny Weasley’s weak voice calling from the tunnel.
The day goes by surprisingly quickly, but almost as if making up for that, the Hallowe’en feast seems to drag on forever instead. And being the second feast in as many days, none of the students are all that impressed by the extravagant dishes put before them this time around, but rather more interested in the Goblet of Fire that is now standing in front of Dumbledore on the Head Table, its blue and white flames dancing almost hypnotically… Harry finds his gaze drawn to them over and over, even as he tries to focus on the conversations going on around him instead, even though they’re half-hearted at best.
”Yes — I mean, no!” Harry says desperately. ”I’ve done — I’ve done as much as I can, I think.”
! In just a week it will be Christmas and he gets to leave all this chaos behind him and go home to his dads!
Harry reaches out and grabs Draco’s hand and reins him in. The blonde immediately tenses up and looks around quickly, but relaxes again when he realises the dorm is empty.
”Yeah”, Harry says. ”She has at least fifty of them on her walls.”
He whips his head up to meet his best friend’s astonished look with a defiant glare. The girl draws herself up, her mouth pinched into a very disappointed bud and then she sniffs, turning her head loftily she gives Daphne a meaningful look. The two girls rise as one and stride off towards the girls dorms. Draco sags a little in his seat, looking after the two of them glumly.
”I’m going to see if he’s okay”, the girl says haughtily.
”Harry Potter can have his letters, if he gives Dobby his word that he won’t go back to —”
”No, thank you”, Pansy says coolly, after a beat, but a thoughtful look settles on her face as she gives Harry a once-over.
”Stand up and take out your wand, Harry.”
”Wait, what — what are you saying —?”
”You want to be careful, Harry…” Draco says coolly. ”If you hang around with riff-raff like the Weasleys it might rub off on you —”
Harry can
But when he wakes up the next morning, his panic sets in again…
, and it’s if something large and scaly has suddenly reared up inside of him, clawing its way up the inside of his stomach and chest. Harry’s blood is running hot, the inside of his skull has been transfigured into a cauldron boiling over and he can’t think of anything besides his own sudden desire to tear the other Harry limb from limb.
The former potions master comes striding down the corridor, throwing the door to the DADA classroom wide open with a flourishing wand movement and then stands there impatiently waiting for them all to file inside ahead of him.
”Oh, not this again…” He murmurs. ”Draco—”
Dumbledore pushes to his feet with such sudden speed, it makes both Harry and Draco jump, and he turns swiftly to the portraits of a sallow-faced wizard with dark hair and an elderly witch with light-grey ringlets, hanging side by side near the ceiling.
he thinks gleefully and begins to write.
Draco chuckles and nods in agreement, but there’s a small glint of something less than happy in his eyes that makes Harry’s good spirits immediately sink again and his chest feel tight.
Lunch is a tense and drawn out affair and by the time Draco has finished eating, and he and Harry head back outside to continue exploring the campsite, the afternoon sun has already started to set. Salesmen carrying trays or pushing carriages full of merchandise are Apparating and Disapparating left-right-and-centre, lit up like Christmas trees with their bright green rossettes for Ireland and red ones for Bulgaria, pointed green hats with dancing Shamrock and red scarves decked out in roaring lions, as well as flags from both countries that start to belt out their respective national anthems when waved, which makes for a very chaotic atmosphere when Harry and Draco wade through the many salesmen.
Again, Dumbledore’s keen blue eyes are peering at him over the top of his glasses, but they aren’t twinkling so much as boring into him.
?” he demands. ”He should be here, with us! I don’t care that he’s — that he’s
… I don’t trust
”It wasn’t a dream!” he exclaims loudly.
”Not the same”, Draco says with a dismissive hand wave in his direction. ”I want sit somewhere with hideous heart decorations and eat stuff that will rot my teeth while we hold hands and gaze stupidly into each other’s eyes—”
”Hey…” Harry says lightly, perching on the side of his bed.
Feeling his stomach knot, Harry looks up towards the ceiling hopefully. But there is no round window there at all. He has no idea of how he’s supposed to get back to the office.
In just that moment, the real Professor Dumbledore chooses to push to his feet and Harry stares in mounting dread as the sparkling old wizard makes his way to the small podium in front of the Head Table, the word
”Yeah, we definitely should! Although, I wouldn’t be surprised if Flint picks you to be the new Seeker… You’re really good, Harry.”
However, his attention is almost immediately pulled back when a loud
friends in this world either, Harry Potter and I, but there’s a world of difference between the nature of my relationship with Harry Potter and your relationship with Draco Malfoy, isn’t there?” the blonde more or less hisses at him, his grey eyes flashing angrily again.
”That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the heir of Slytherin alone can control”, Professor Binns says, looking even more annoyed when the class exchanges nervous looks. ”I tell you, it does not exist. There is no Chamber and no monster.”
won’t hurt—”
Harry grabs the elf’s tiny wrist in a firm grip, to keep him away from the Skele-Gro or any other blunt object.
he thinks uncertainly as the merpeople seem to be closing in on him.
a black dot moving across the grounds,
”For me it smelled like grass and rain and broom oil…” Draco murmurs conversationally next to him and Harry’s inner voice lets out an expletive mid
Taking a deep breath, Harry pushes himself up to sitting. He hears his dad let out a bark of laughter and gestures rudely in his general direction.
Remus sighs softly. When Harry’s shy gaze darts over to him, he gives him a pinched smile.
”I AM DOING MY BEST, ALL RIGHT?”
Harry nods, looking down, ”I love you too.”
The boys look up and catches the scowls on the girls’ faces and they quickly whip their heads around to see Granger standing behind Harry. She seems to shake herself out of her thoughts and looks between Pansy and Harry, blinking several times.
They trundle on through the darkness along the small path leading from the village to the castle on top of the hill, past the massive wrought iron gates flanked by a couple of winged boars carved out of stone, that can just be seen through the dim light of a couple of torches on the columns below and finally come to a stop below the stone steps of the castle.
”Granger, Professor”, the Gryffindor says. ”I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”
”That’s enough…” he says quietly.
Harry looks up as well, straining his ears… He can hear commotion of some sort and someone sobbing and wailing loudly…
Harry stays in bed, focusing on the growing ball of self-pity that’s made itself at home in the pit of his stomach. After about an hour so, he’s aware of someone walking into the dorm and moving about behind his back. It’s not until he gets a whiff of coconut that makes his stomach flip, that he realises it must be Malfoy.
”Yes…” Parkinson says slowly, narrowing her eyes at him. ”Remind me again why that’s a good thing?”
”Harry?” Draco calls after him.
When the clock chimes half past eleven and he’s saying good night to Ron in the Entrance Hall, he feels extremely relieved. Despite this, he tells Ron he had a really good time — and he does mean it, just not for the majority of the eveing… The Gryffinor gives him a pinched smile and nods.
so hard to remind everyone of how special you are,
Snape’s hand tightens on his shoulder. Harry winces and Snape immediately loosens his grip and lets go of his shoulder altogether.
To his immense relief, Draco is stubbornly stuck to his side despite all of this, but at the same time Harry is uncomfortably aware that even the blonde is acting  differently around him now. It’s a subtle difference, and when Harry looks directly at the other boy or talk to him, he can’t tell at all; but whenever Draco thinks Harry isn’t looking, he keeps shooting him worried looks and there’s a tension to his shoulders that’s not there normally, like he’s ready to bolt at the slightest noise… Harry would confront his best friend about it, if he wasn’t so scared the boy would take the opportunity to abandon him once and for all, if only Harry gave him an excuse…
like that, Harry would not be smiling… He’d be running in the opposite direction!
he thinks giddily.
”Sir?” Harry frowns.
Or is it even longer back than that, maybe when he first discovered the Mirror of Erised and saw his parents for the first time?
”Did I,
”We’re not going to miss the train”, Sirius says calmly, then urges Harry to finish his breakfast in an undertone and Harry quickly stuffs the piece of toast in his mouth then burns the roof of his mouth when he tries to wash it down with his tea.
that I’ve been listening to all summer, the singer died last spring so the radio keeps playing their greatest hits… there’s this one song called
”I’M UP!”
”Want to dance?” Harry asks Draco hopefully.
The door immediately flies open and Sirius tumble inside, staring around the room in alarm —
to open the door and
, he tells it and storms out of the bathroom.
”Did you ask an older student to do it for you? Tell the truth — I won’t be angry—”
Harry turns around and sees Professor Dumbledore smile back at her, then begin to clap. Many of the students hurry to copy and the smile on the woman’s face grows.
He follows Bagman out of the tent again, and the man leads him down the edge of the forest and looks around furtively before giving Harry an almost fatherly look of compassion and grabbing his shoulder.
and frowns. Bellatrix Lestrange’s sneer seems to be even more taunting than when he’d seen her portrait last time.
Professor Snape stares at him.
Familiar faces swim in front of him, but it takes Harry a second to really register them. His heart skips a beat, and then begins hammering wildly as the truth finally sinks in… Crouched down in a half circle around him are none other than:
”What the
”—and it wouldn’t be the usual sensational tosh”, Granger ploughs on. ”It would be the true story. Your story. All the facts, exactly as you report them. What really happened that night. Who was there. What Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip of yourself”, she snaps at Skeeter, who jumped so badly at the mention of Voldemort’s name that she’d slopped half her butterbeer down her front.
, Harry thinks and picks up his pace with determination.
Turning around slowly, Harry stares hopelessly as the masked figures step back to create a semi-circle in front of him, leaving just a small opening through which another hooded figure steps silently… He’s not wearing a masks, he doesn’t even have a face at all, just a pair of scarlet eyes that burn into Harry…
His friends all give him looks of sympathy and he grimaces slightly and mutters to them to go ahead. He can hear the Potions Master’s quick footsteps behind him and turns around slowly to face his fate… that’s overly dramatic, he tells himself. But when he looks up into Professor Snape’s glittering black eyes, his stomach drops.
Funnily enough, Umbridge seems to be the only teacher really trying to get rid of them, the other professors showing little to no inclination to lend a hand, especially since the fireworks seem to harbour a vendetta towards Umbridge in particular.
”Yes”, Sirius responds simply, without missing a beat.
”Very good, Harry”, Dumbledore inclines his head.
Harry throws the girl a sidelong look, the memories of the two End of Year parties in the other world already fresh in his mind. The other Pansy hadn’t seemed all that concerned with ”Gryffindor cooties” when she was plastering herself over Granger on the dance floor and cosying up to her on the floor behind the sofa… He doesn’t think this is the right time or place to be sharing that particular memory with anyone. But he makes a mental note to definitely
”No”, Harry says again. ”I want you to leave Ron alone!”
”No-one else has come up to me to offer their sympathy”, he says, turning to Pansy and mirroring her glare. ”
Harry tunes her out again, trying to think where he’s heard the term
”I’m not a Parselmouth”, he says gently. ”But I have learned to master the basics of parseltongue over the years…”
”Nevertheless?” Remus demands incredulously. ”
Apparently there are a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts, wide and sweeping ones, narrow and rickety ones, some that like to change things up randomly and move their positions and some with vanishing steps that you have to remember to look out for. Then there are doors that won’t open unless you ask them nicely, and some that won’t even show themselves unless you tickle them in exactly the right place, and then there are doors that aren’t actually doors at all, just walls pretending. And the staircases aren’t the only thing changing either, the inhabitants of the portraits tend to leave their own frames to visit each other, and Harry is sure the coats of armour can walk as well.
”I’ve already seen you once”, Harry reminds him. ”You were howling and everything—”
, after all — and it doesn’t matter that he is an awful man (and even a rather rotten dad), because if something were to happen to him it would break Draco’s heart all the same.
”Chocolate for me”, a strangled, but distinctly familiar man’s voice mumbles above Harry’s head and he frowns,
, he leads Harry to his office. He wordlessly points Harry to the chair in front of the desk, before sweeping around it to stand next to his own chair. Harry gingerly perches on the edge of the seat and continues to hang his head.
”He’s not really gone”, Harry says, willing Riddle to believe him, willing Riddle to doubt, to fear. ”He’ll never truly be gone, not as long as there are people at the school who believe in him…”
Curling shaky fingers around the other boy’s erection, familiar and yet completely different to touching his own, Harry marvels at the feeling of the smooth skin pulsing against his palm and starts moving his hand carefully, experimenting with pressure and speed, and soaking up all wretched sounds escaping from the other boy’s throat.
he thinks.
”Yeah — Yeah, I’ll — I’ll see you, R-Remus”, Harry says.
”Okay”, Harry says, relenting.
Quirrell screams and tries to shake Harry off — Harry’s scar is searing again, but he screws his eyes shut and clings on to Quirrell’s arm for dear life — Voldemort shrieks at Quirrell to
Harry props himself up on his elbows, ”What are you doing back? Shouldn’t you be at work?”
”What do you say we go to
”Yeah, yeah”, Harry says. ”I’ll meet you there…”
”You’re taking eight classes?” Harry whispers to his boyfriend, craning his neck to see the blonde’s time table.
again and Sirius eagerly asks him what’s new in the world.
Sighing, Harry reaches for the fork and stabs at the scrambled eggs sourly, but only ends up rearranging them on the plate. The action reminds him of Draco and he feels a tightness in his chest again.
Relief floods Harry with such force he feels almost light-headed from it.
Harry says nothing, just frowns at the shadows ahead of them in the corridor.
As he suspected, not a lot of explaining is required in the end. Sirius surprises them both by welcoming them home to a finished dinner and takes one look at Harry carrying the kitten in one hand and the owl cage in the other and immediately turns to look at his husband with an exasperated look.
”That is enough”, Snape tells Draco sternly. ”I don’t want to hear another word… five points from Slytherin, as well. That is the end of it. Have I made myself clear? Good”, he snaps, before any of them has a chance to respond. ”All of you, get to your classes.
They mount their brooms and kick off the ground. Swooping and swerving around each other in the air, the two boys start to relax more and more. It’s the most exhilarating feeling to be flying, and now for the first time ever, Harry gets to share the experience with Draco. He feels on top of the world… and judging by the ecstatic look on Draco’s face, he’d say he’s not the only one.
Draco hesitates. Harry gives him an encouraging smile, then scooches forward and pushes off the edge before the other boy can protest.
”Maybe…” Harry mutters.
When Harry reaches the part where his wand connected with Voldemort’s, his throat begins to close up…
” Pansy gasps, shooting to her feet once more. ”
”What?” Harry says.
He’d been so caught up in the whole interaction, that he’d completely missed Professor Trelawny’s instructions and jumps when a massive tome suddenly hits the table next to him with a loud
Halfway down the chamber, a massive statue comes into view at the far end of the Chamber. Harry stops walking and cranes his neck back to stare up into its face, then trail the long, stone beard down its body —
The little growls and huffs of frustration that Granger keeps letting out is making it harder than usual for Harry to concentrate on the dense textbook, but he’s pretty much given up on understanding it anyway. Instead, he enjoys watching the lurking blonde’s slow but definite progress across the room through the corner of his eye.
”Harry”, Draco mutters. ”They won’t harm
”He told her…” Professor Snape trails off, glaring at another jar.
”Fine”, Harry sighs and stands up again.
Harry nearly hexes him.
”Who, Wood?” Flint says incredulously.
”I’d heard rumours
Pansy and Daphne have gone halfsies on a beautiful golden tie pin, decorated with a solitary gemstone made to look like a Snitch, with a pair of wings engraved on either side of it.
”Her— what? I thought you were at least going to say we need to go to the Headmaster, or better yet, Professor Snape!”
”, Harry mutters and grabs his own homework and proceeds to ignore his boyfriend for the rest of the evening.
”Hang on”, Harry starts to protest.
Harry sears their mouths together in a feverish kiss and clutches the blonde’s shoulders, desperate for closeness and friction. Draco allows himself to pulled and presses his body against Harry’s with sensuous slowness that makes Harry’s blood boil. But no matter how frantically he paws at the other boy or how hard he tries to deepen their kiss, Draco is determined to set an excruciatingly slow pace.
”Sorry, Sir…” Harry mumbles.
”Don’t be”, Draco says immediately.
”What… the hell… was
”What is it with you”, Draco says and throws his hands up in exasperation, the light from his wand following the movement and distorting the shadows between them. ”Why do you have to —?”
”Yeah, well, I need a tutor who actually grew up like a muggle”, Draco mumbles.
”How?” Pansy pipes up, raising a perfectly trimmed eyebrow at the half-giant.
the considerable protections placed on the castle, and Harry relaxes slightly again.
Although, compared to time it takes McGonagall and Sprout to go through this process, Professor Snape goes through each student’s results almost as swiftly as the Head of Ravenclaw, Professor Flitwick, something that the Potions Master is clearly proud of, judging by his posture and the subtle looks he keeps throwing across the Hall, where McGonagall is rifling through her notes restlessly. Harry looks between the two of them and smirks, wondering if they’re conscious of their little race down the long tables or if it’s a purely subconscious competition.
”Gryffindorkish, you mean?” Harry says lightly, but the blonde simply shakes his head.
”With Dumbledo—”
Finally the Easter holidays rolls around, but piles upon piles of homework to do on top of revisions for the end-of-year exams, Harry barely gets a moment to relax at all and even has to decline his dads’ invitation to Easter Lunch.
Remus lets go of Harry’s hand and grabs his wand, then closing his eyes briefly he mutters, ”
Harry and Granger walk across the room and take their seats, while the Headmaster watches them quietly. There is a hint amusement in his face, but Harry can’t help but think that there is something not quite twinkly about his eyes now. There is a sharpness there, but one of alertness rather than joy.
”Feeling of
”But that’s not all he is famous for, now is it, Lucius?”
”Relax…” Draco says slowly, his smile morphing into a smirk. ”Your secret is safe with me.”
”Do you mean
They reach the station just as the Hogwarts Express pulls into the platform and Remus levitates Harry’s trunk towards one of the carriages, before pulling into a massive hug.
”Thanks”, Harry mumbles again.
I’ve been having — erm, about a classmate, and er — dreams too — and I when I wake up my pyjamas are always we—”
”Are you all right…?” Professor Snape murmurs quietly.
a vicious voice whispers in the back of his mind.
”Yeah?” Harry mutters.
”Ye-eah”, Harry gasps softly. ”Or we c-could… erm…”
”Good”, Remus says decisively, then turns to shout over his shoulder. ”Coast is clear!”
”That’s a
The air vibrates between them, he feels his veins and nerve-endings thrumming with it.

Harry jerks his head up and stares at the other boy in surprise.

Madam Bones looks over at Remus and Sirius and gives them a pinched smile. Sirius stands up and so does Madam Bones. She follows Sirius over to the doorway, but pauses on the threshold to give Harry a kind smile and says, ”It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter…”
”How are you feeling today? Better?”
Draco nods absent-mindedly, now gently opening the book up and carefully flicking through some of the pages. Harry sits back again with an indulgent smirk. He doesn’t quite understand his boyfriend’s fascination with wands, but seeing him happy makes Harry happy and he supposes that’s all that matters.
”I’m sorry, Mr Potter. I can’t let you in. Mr Malfoy doesn’t want you here…”
”Yeah, I get it”, Draco says softly.
” both his dads say in unison.
… you have to tell me if you don’t feel up to playing, as your boyfriend I want to know that you’re okay, and as your Captain, I need to know that you’re okay to play.”
”Thanks for telling us the truth.”
the one who said it would be too dangerous and stupid to do anything—”
Dumbledore is leaned over the desk, his crooked nose mere inches from Mrs Norris’s fur as he studies her through his half-moon spectacles, ignoring Lockhart as the man hovers at his shoulder giving suggestions, ”It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably the Transmogrifian Torture, I’ve seen it used many times before, so unlucky I wasn’t there, I know just the counter-curse that would have saved her…”
Draco huffs, ”You’re not
”Yeah, that one”, Harry nods.
”Hey Harry”, Seamus says. ”Want to play Exploding Snap?”
”Indeed, Sir”, the house-elf confirms, nodding his head vigorously, his ears flapping and tears spilling all over his small face. ”I is hiding and waiting for Harry Potter to arrive and sealing the gateway — I is having to iron my hands afterwards —”
”Harry…” Remus says from the doorway, giving the doorframe a cursory rap with his knuckles. ”Can I talk to you for a minute?”
”All right then…” Harry tells himself.
Draco wheels around, locating Pansy and squinting at her through sleep-swollen eyes.
A moment later, as Harry is placing the four presents from his dads on the the floor beneath the Christmas tree’s lowest branches, his daddy reappears with the massive breakfast tray floating in the air in front of him.
”I don’t want you getting into any more trouble, Harry”, Remus says in his sternest voice, but his frown quickly fades as Harry pouts. ”You do not need an Invisibility Cloak while at Hogwarts… Stop looking at me like that, Harry…”
”Work?” Harry repeats with a frown.
Draco sniffs, but there’s a glint of uncertainty in his eyes when he peers over at Harry and his fingers twitch against his palms.
No-one puts their hand up this time, even though Harry’s sure they all know at least one more… However, eyeing the spider on top of the desk, Harry isn’t about to offer it up and he’s certain he’s not the only one who feels that way.
I didn’t hurt you?”
Harry feels his stomach jolt pleasantly when he sees his dads squeezed together between Seamus and Professor Snape, looking slightly out of place but grinning proudly back at him and — Harry lets out an incredulous chuckle — they’re both wearing
”What—?” Harry says.
he thinks intently, memorising the items.
Harry realises then that Quirrell must have been the one howling. The man is staring down at his hands, almost sobbing in pain. Even Harry can tell that they’ve been burnt raw, they’re that red.
”Outside — just now!” Harry exclaims. ”It’s pulling the carriage!”
Suddenly, flames erupt on the top of the pillar Riddle is standing next to and the sixteen-year-old flinches, eyes flickering in panic —
”How do you know?”
Voldemort says nothing for a moment, just stares at Lucius with unblinking, piercing eyes. Immediately the laughter dies down around them. Lucius’ eyes flit up to Voldemort’s face for a split second, then instantly fixes on his chest again.
”— quick, like that! — yeah, what?”
With a strangled yell of frustration Harry hurls his pillow off his head and across the room. It bounces off the opposite wall and lands with an anti-climactic flop on the floor.
”That girl, Merope…” Harry sighs, choosing his words carefully. ”That was Tom Riddle’s mum. Gaunt was his granddad.”
”Really? Dad already said yes?”
”That’s enough, Alastor”, Dumbledore says.
Harry bites his lip to stop himself from gasping, because for one horrifying second he’d been sure that those light-blue eyes had flickered from Lucius face and landed straight on him and Draco, as if Dumbledore could see them, despite the invisibility cloak.
so he nods without hesitation.
”It’s mad.”
Blaise huffs out a chuckle, ”Like Draco would ever mess up his haircut…”
”I see… Where did you arrive?”
Harry blinks in surprise, looking between the Gryffindor girl and the scowling journalist.
Towards the end of the last week of term, Draco begins to calm down a bit about his revision, knowing he’ll have all of Easter break to study without any lessons, Quidditch practise sessions or Prefect duties getting in the way, which is why, Harry figures, he doesn’t have an apoplectic fit when Umbridge calls a last minute meeting with the Inquisitorial Squad. He gives Harry an apologetic look and leans in to peck him on the lips, then leaves with Theo and the girls.
”Reliable historical sources tell us this much”, Professor Binns states drily. ”But, these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets… The story goes, that before he left, Slytherin built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing… According to legend, Slytherin sealed the Chamber so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing…
”Riddikulus”, Remus says clearly and the orb turns black drops to the floor and starts scurrying around, but with a bang, Remus sends it flying back into the wardrobe and quickly locks the door again. ”S-Sorry everyone, we seem to have run out of time… But that was great work! Very good, indeed! Have a great weekend, everyone! Harry, can I have a quick word with you?” he adds in an undertone.
”Tell it to Malfoy and Potter!” Seamus grouses. ”They’re the ones shagging and waking everyone up!”
”Sorry”, Harry mumbles. ”One sec…”
Mind made up, he pushes himself to his feet and makes his way to the dorms as well. He grabs the first shirt he finds in the trunk by the bed that looks remotely nice, and clean, and replaces the one he’s already wearing. He decides to keep the jeans on, because he might be going to a party but it’s not like he’s got anyone to look attractive for… Walking over to the weird window, he squints at the slightly distorted reflection of himself and tries to flatten his hair with his hands.
”Okay, yeah”, Harry nods quickly, his face swiftly going from hot to cold. ”I understand—”
similar to what Remus and Sirius has and if, for whatever reason, they were to break up again now, Harry doubts they’d be able to go back to being friends at all.
Dumbledore stands up suddenly, and a hush breaks out across the entire room.
The owl gives an affectionate hoot and then takes off through the window. Feeling too excited to go back to sleep, Harry eagerly accepts Professor Snape’s offer of a cup of tea.
… Since you haven’t been replying to any of his letters all summer, he’s apparently been rather heartsick”, Remus replies with a smile, but what’s so funny about, Harry really doesn’t see. ”Relax, Harry… I explained everything to Narcissa and she promised to send us an owl as soon as she’d talked to Draco. She also offered to take you and Draco out for the day in Diagon Alley. I said I’d double check with you, but that it sounded like a lovely idea… Sirius, do you think you’ll be able to go to Gringotts today?”
Neville lets out a squeak and scurries away, but the remaining four Gryffindors turn to face him as he approaches which Harry chooses to see as encouragement, even if none of them are smiling. Rather the opposite, Harry thinks, his eyes darting nervously over to the twins identical frowns.
” Remus calls after them.
… he cups the other boy’s face in his hands and gently caresses his cheekbones with his thumbs, and smiles softly at the awed and almost alarmed expression on the other boy’s face.
still in place.
Umbridge seems to still then, her narrowed eyes boring into Harry as another insincere smile splits her flabby face in two. Harry frowns.
”There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr Potter—” she hisses.
”You’ve got a… love bite…” Draco mumbles, his voice barely above a whisper and Harry feels his fingertips brush his neck where he’d bitten down. ”Sorry…”
There’s a ripple of snickers and snorts amongst the older students and Harry shakes his head in amusement. But as the silhouette gets closer, it turns out that the second first-year’s guess wasn’t too far off the mark… It’s not technically a house, but the horse-drawn carriage is certainly the size of one… And the dozen winged palomino horses tethered to it are all the size of elephants… They all come soaring towards them and touch down at alarming speed, causing the carriage to land with great
Harry gives him a cross look, ”You shouldn’t use that word…”
This time, Harry just has to remember the tingling sensation and the feeling of feather, and the transformation starts again. But Sirius had been right. It’s difficult to control the transformation in the beginning and it’s especially difficult to
Although he’s never been here before and has no idea of what these glass spheres are, Harry knows where he’s going and with his scar searing and heart hammering, he begins to run again…
”What? Yeah. Of course”, Draco mumbles, blushing a bright pink. ”Why wouldn’t I be? Are you? Okay? I-I- m-mean, how are you? How was your ehm h-holiday?”
”Oh — Sorry, I thought maybe it was one of Fred and George’s jokes… And have you really got — you know…”
The blonde starts to back towards the bed, pulling Harry with him. They both tumble onto the bed in a heap of sprawling limbs, without once breaking their lip-lock.
He holds out the jar of murtlap salve and Draco quickly grabs it from him with a nod. He hurries out of the office, leaving Harry alone with their Head of House.
Remus appears in the doorway, looking frazzled, ”What happened?”
”And why did you want to meet me?”
”Well…” Seamus says slowly. ”Maybe not quite as bad, but definitely the worst in our year!”
Harry gets the feeling he means
”Harry”, the blonde says in a small voice. ”I really don’t want to talk about it, I just want to forget it ever happened.”
”Are we okay?”
Harry shrugs tensely, avoiding his gaze now.
”I say…” one of the portraits mutter. ”Such rude language…”
When Draco, Theo, Pansy and Daphne return from the first meeting, they reveal that only Slytherins have decided to join the Inquisitorial Squad, or at least they’re the only once Umbridge has decided to accept, and her main reason for creating the Inquisitorial Squad is that she suspects Dumbledore is secretly training students in Defence Against the Dark Arts.
”Yeah…” Draco murmurs. ”Maybe…”
doesn’t have to die? What if he’s just weakened, or — or —”
”Draco!”
”I will now escort my student to the Hospital Wing… After I have done so, I will contact his guardians… But when they arrive at the castle and demand to know what has happened to their son,

”Yeah yeah, fine. I really did like it.”
Harry thinks with a jolt.
anything”, Harry snarls.
” Pansy repeats sharply, her eyes narrowed to slits as she stares him down.
”I don’t really care”, Harry says.
Remus watches him silently for a moment, then sighs, ”No, Harry… You can’t have both, you have to choose one…”
”But she doesn’t know about the troll”, Harry says and turns to Draco. ”We need to warn her!”
swirls to the front of Harry’s mind, of sitting at the kitchen table in Creirwyn’s Hollow drinking coffee with Sitius and idly watching Draco and Remus cook together, Draco carefully mincing a glove of garlic and Remus instructing him to crush them with the side of the blade first…
”Professor Burbage was telling us all about it last week, and Granger and I were talking about it as well, and I couldn’t really get my head around it, but — this is what it looks like!”
He blinks. His heart is pounding so hard in his chest now, he’s almost worried it’s going to break his ribs and come flying out…
”But… But…
”My mother died shortly after… she was careful to take the Polyjuice Potion until they end, and so they buried her under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”
”Come on”, Remus says and steers him through the archway and round the corner.
Remus raises an amused eyebrow, ”Sounds very Slytherin, to me.”
so sure —
It turns out that, despite it being Sunday, the news of Colin Creevy having been attacked and now lying as though dead in the hospital wing has managed to reach the Slytherins — and probably the other houses as well, Harry figures — but that the Chamber has been opened once before, none of the other second year boys had found out until Harry reveals it later in the dormitory.
go away—?”
”Okay, this way…” Harry says, noticing a stone passageway leading out of the room.
”I know”, Krum nods.
”I agree, that does indeed seem the most plausible explanation”, he murmurs. ”It would appear the two of you are subconsciously linked somwhow and… able to connect with the other’s experiences in your sleep, when your own conscious mind is at rest.”
”What was it like sleeping in Gryffindor Tower?”
They come together for a hug with jerky, hesitant movements, but by the time they have their arms locked around each other they relax into the embrace and hold it for beat too long. Harry feels a twinge of longing for his own Draco, but also the same heaviness he’d felt saying good bye to Granger.
”Yeah, I’ll be fine”, Harry nods. ”I’ve just got a headache. You guys go ahead, I’ll see you later for dinner…”
A dark look flickers past his daddy’s eyes, but he quickly blinks it away again.
you could have…
fine.
team has got the pitch booked?” he asks.
”Okay…” Draco says slowly. ”So what do we do now? We can’t go to Snape. Not without proof. There’s no way he’ll believe us without the diary. If anything he’ll give us detention for disregarding the new rules five seconds after he told us about them…”
”Don’t forget our appointment tomorrow evening.”
Draco pulls away with a gasp and stares down into Harry’s face in wonder, as if trying to figure out what just happened even though he’s the one who started it, Harry thinks hysterically and huffs out a breathless chuckle… Draco’s eyes are more pupil than grey… Harry licks his lips again and taking a shuddering breath, he gently pushes his hips against Draco’s again, exhilarated to feel the other boy is just as excited as him…
”Same reason everyone else wants it — to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets!”
”I know”, Flint says with a malicious grin. ”But Gryffindor is…”
much of a blast, but you only live once, that’s my motto!
He looks up to see both his dads file into the tent, their wild expressions barely softening as they lay eyes on him. Remus is on him in the blink of an eye, his hands grabbing at him roughly as if feeling for hidden injuries.
”About time ye turned up!” Hagrid says. ”I’ve been waitin’ fer an hour already!”
”You’ll get used to it”, Sirius says. ”You just have to be a bit careful when you use your tongue, you know when you eat and… well, when you eat.”
parents who wants you to be discreet?” Harry gripes back, but even as he says it he feels bad for bringing it up and when the laughter fades from the blonde’s glittering eyes he reaches out and touches his leg under the table. ”Sorry. I didn’t mea—”
Harry wrinkles his nose, ”You planning on getting lucky, Granger?”
”Well if there’s nothing else…” he mutters. ”We’ll be… be going… yes…”
”When was this?” Harry asks eagerly.
”Professor!” Harry exclaims happily. ”What are you doing here?”
”What?” Harry says.
”I can wait in the Atrium?”
”What matter?” Remus asks immediately.
Just as he’d suspected, it’s with a red raw hand that he makes his way back to the dungeons three hours later. Umbridge had interrupted him an hour earlier tonight, not out of kindness or mercy, but simply because that’s the amount of time it took Harry to create a deep enough cut in his hand.
of Apparition can be heard in the near distance. Looking in the direction of the sound, desperate hope wells up inside Harry…
”Look, Granger”, he says calmly. ”I had a dream — although I’m sure it wasn’t just a dream—”
be true…” Sirius says, smiling for the first time since Harry brought up the memory, but it quickly flickers out again as meets Harry’s gaze. ”I know it’s a lot, Harry… But do you think you can forgive your dumb old dad his deliquent past?”
towards him. The affronted looks on his and Draco’s faces in the photograph, as the magicked subjects keep scrubbing at their punctured faces surlishly, would have made him smile at any other time.
Sirius’s confusion morphs into mild alarm, but he seems to collect himself and shakes his head. He straightens up and clamps a hand over the back of Harry’s neck and starts to steer him towards one of the doorways. Harry remembers running after Bellatrix Lestrange … her voice echoing tauntingly around him as he ran —
”Oh…” Harry mumbles. ”All right, then… thanks…”
Harry, my ankle—!”
”So, anyway… how come you didn’t take him to this thing, then?”
Besides the gifts from his dads, Harry has received birthday cards and small gifts from a few of his Hogwarts friends and, to his astonishment, Hagrid the gamekeeper.
No-one speaks. No-one even seems to breathe.
handed one in!”
Aware of merpeople still surrounding him, leering and watching him struggle with shining eyes, as they rise towards the surface with him and Draco, Harry begins to worry about what will happen when he runs out of time… if he doesn’t make it to the surface before the hour is up, will they seize him and Draco and pull them back down again? will they be held captive in the depths of the lake until they suffocate and drown? will their bodies rot at the bottom of the lake, just like the merpeople sang in their stupid song?
”Coming, Harry?” Seamus asks as he pulls a jumper on over his pyjamas and steps into a pair of boots.
Harry looks between all three of them, panic building in the pit of his stomach. He’s just about to demand someone tell him what the Hell is going on, when Draco beats him to it.
But still, nothing from Draco.
Ron and Granger exchange a look, then continue to cross the courtyard until they’re standing right in front of Harry, who suddenly wishes they’d just followed their Hufflepuff friend inside the castle and left him alone.
It’s not bleeding anymore, but the
”— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows, he alone knew exactly who we all were —”
”Settle down”, Snape says smoothly as soon as everyone is seated.
He gives Draco’s hand a gentle squeeze, then pulls him along from behind the griffin and follow Snape’s fading footsteps. They creep quietly along the next corridor and Harry peers out from behind the corner.
out of line from now on…”
An involuntary noise of disgust escapes Harry and he gives the man an outraged look.
Harry glances back at his fathers again, and just before the train lurches around the bend and they disappear from view, he sees fresh tears spill down Remus’s face and Sirius wrapping an arm around him.
He’s had plenty of headaches in his life, but he’s sure he’s never quite experienced this before. His brain feels like it’s been turned into lead and yet it seems to be pulsing and throbbing like an organism… An organism that keeps sweeling and growing, pushing in his skull…
emerges from the small crowd and obediently joins his teacher’s side. Several people gasp and others begin to whisper furiously, but if the boy notices he doesn’t let on.
”Number Two Creirwy’s Hollow
Harry risks a glance at Zabini and discovers the other boy glaring back at him.
”Who haven’t you had sex with?” Ron squeaks next to him.
Harry is halfway to the Great Hall with Granger, when a young boy comes barelling down the hallway behind them, puffing out his full name at the top of his voice. They both pull to a confused stop and watch as the boy continues trotting towards them, waving a small bit of parchment in the air above his head.
”I wanted to ask you about Draco”, Dumbledore says and Harry’s heart stutters. ”I believe the two of you are very close—”
”Yeah, I know.”
”Yeah, no”, Harry says uncomfortably, frowning at the mere suggestion.
After having broken down in Herbology, a tearful Hannah Abbot stammered out that she is clearly too stupid to sit any exams and then requested dramatically to be taken out of school immediately. Professor Sprout, Hannah’s Head of House, kindly refused this request and sent her to the Hospital Wing and thus she became the first of many students to be given Calming Draughts by Madam Pomfrey.
for Harry and yet
”That means
”Well done, Ron!” Hagrid shouts ecstatically. ”Well done! Right — yeh can touch ’im now. Pat ’is beak, go on!”
”Wait, wait, wait, back it up”, Sirius says seriously, straightening up in his chair. ”Pansy? Parkinson? No way—”
”I will take him to Poppy, Severus”, he tells Professor Snape gently. ”You stay here and look after the rest of your students.”
Warning: This is an angsty one!
”Yeah,
”The feeling of change—”
”Because
”So…” Draco pants. ”Forgive me?”
”Bastard…” Harry mutters.
At breakfast Hedwig comes swooping down to land on his shoulder and he beams at her, taking a moment to pet her head and feed her a piece of bacon before untying the note on her leg. He immediately recognises his daddy’s swirly handwriting and perks up further.
When they get to the library on the third floor, Draco commandeers a small table in the far back and then slowly but steadily begins to fill it up with books on hexes and curses. But it’s when he drops an especially heavy tome about
boys”, Pansy corrects Daphne, glaring at Seamus and Harry. ”Just the
Thoroughly awake and with no chance of going back to sleep, even if the other boy would leave him alone, Harry gives up trying to buck him off his back and lets out a final howl of frustration, before going limp under his weight.
Harry just shakes his head, then sweeps his gaze down the other boy’s body, noticing a slight limp.
The door opens with a click, and then slides open with a low groan. Taking a deep breath, Harry sidles through the doorway, just far enough inside the room so that he can have a look around. Although it’s not a room. It’s a hall, and a rather large one at that. A small thrill of recognition sparks at the back of Harry’s mind, but he can’t quite place it.
”I’m not!” Draco says. ”What, you’re going to have a Beater on your team? Or two Keepers?”
As soon as his dads have said good night to him and shut themselves in the master bedroom, Harry grabs a quill, an ink pot and some parchment then throws himself down on top of his bed to compose a letter to Draco telling him all about it.
”, Draco demands, he whips his head around to stare pleadingly at Professor Snape and Remus in turn. ”Professor —
Draco says nothing, just keeps clutching Harry’s arms and staring in shock at the door where the troll had been. Harry gingerly moves out of the blonde’s grasp and edges towards the open door, his heart hammering wildly somewhere in the near vicinity of his throat…
”Stop skulking and loosen up, Severus — it’s a party!” Slughorn exclaims, jostling the man and receiving a murderous glare in response. ”Have you had anything to drink? No? Well that’s the problem, I’d wager, here, have some punch!”
”Hey, don’t I know you…?” Harry says, moving a little closer to the ghost and holding his wand aloft.
”All right, if you’re sure… Hey! Where’s your button?”
” Voldemort screams.
Harry thinks impatiently, shifting the weight from one leg to the other, but staying silent.
The blonde keeps snickering, but reaches for his wand on the bedside table, ”Relax…
”All right”, Harry mutters nonplussed. ”Do you want me to use my own ink?”
, Harry thinks, his heart stuttering.
”, Snape mutters, then shoots another dark glare in Sirius direction. ”Black…”
”Yeah”, Harry says, forcing a shrug into his shoulders. ”But it’s only stalled my death really, hasn’t it… I’m the one who has to fight You Know Who, because I’m the only one who can defeat him, except I
”I don’t know. I suppose so. It was sunny and the water was quite warm. I mean it was cool, but it wasn’t cold, you know…”
Harry nods. Whatever the girl
”Everything okay?” he asks anxiously.
”Haven’t you guessed it yet,
”I’m fine”, Draco tells his best friend in a long-suffering voice and receives a sympathetic pout from the girl before she starts petting his hair.
”Bode, he was my dad’s colleague, in the Department of Mysteries. Remember he had some kind of accident and was taken to St Mungos, where he was killed by a plant?”
”Gather round, gather round —!”
”No, no, there’s another entrance for Ministry workers”, Sirius tells him. ”It’s on the other side of the Atrium and it’s disguised to the muggles as a public toilet…”
with those muggles,
the unicorn and, Harry realises with a sickening jolt, it’s already dead… Harry feels a clenching sensation in his chest. He’s never seen anything so beautiful and so sad at the same time.
”No, not right now, Harry. I’m still eating…”
”You’re getting a tutor who what now?” Pansy says delicately.
”Really?” Harry perks up excitedly. ”What’d you get me?”
… Then one of them grows a pair of blurry arms and seems to be holding them up in a placating manner. Harry can barely hear the murmured voice over his own pounding heart, but he would recognise that gentle barritone anywhere…
” Harry exclaims, mind whirring to a stop suddenly.
”I’m sure you didn’t”, Remus says in a soothing voice that makes Harry bristle, because that’s how you talk to little children when they’re scared a Boggart is hiding under their bed. ”And I’m sure Draco knows that too—”
”Thanks”, he says as he accepts the offered cup. ”Do you mind if we step outside for a minute, it’s really hot in here…”
Harry gapes as a heart-shaped pink cloud comes zooming towards him and explodes in a hundred little glittering red hearts, all squeaking
, he thinks.
”I got three!” Harry says eagerly.
”Right!” Umbridge says shrilly, her flabby cheeks burning a vivid red and the clipboard nearly tumbling out of her hands when she hops down from her stool. ”That’s — right — well, I must be going! Other meetings to — yes —”
All major canon plot points that shouldn't realistically be altered because of Sirius being a free man, him and Remus raising Harry or Harry being in Slytherin, will therefore still take place (e.g. Triwizard Tournament will take place, but the DA will not)"
His eyes scan the Great Hall for the source of the croaking and just are skirting past the Head Table when a third one rings out, louder than the previous two and he catches Umbridge slap both of her hands over her mouth.
”Get out!” Snape barks. ”
Draco startles and scrambles up to sitting, staring up at Harry with bleary eyes.
”Oh, Barty Crouch for this sort of business, I’m no great shakes at languages…” Fudge sighs. ”Where is Barty… Oh, I see his house-elf is saving him a seat…”
”Thank you again”, Remus says, shaking the hand of an official-looking witch wearing scarlet robes and horn-rimmed glasses. ”Oh, here he is… Harry, this is Madam Bones from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She’s come to give you back your wand.”
Harry lets himself be dragged deeper into the crowd and positioned in front of a middle-aged man almost as short as Harry, but a lot skinnier and with a slight stoop to his shoulders.
He’s waiting for Draco in the Entrance Hall where they’d said they’d meet up and head to Quidditch practise together, but once again the blonde must be so engrossed in his muggle studies that he’s lost track of time because according to the clock above the doors to the Great Hall, he is already ten minutes late. Harry sighs heavily and starts making the trek towards the library.
”No, his name was — ehm — Dotty or something — Daddy, he has been stealing my mail!”
Draco opens his eyes again and it’s like he can see right into the core of Harry. Another whistle can be heard from the train behind them and Draco reluctantly pulls away from Harry, taking a few steps back towards the steps leading up to the small doorway.
Even though he genuinely doesn’t think he did anything to deserve the detentions, just being in this office and sitting in this chair, with his Head of House literally towering over him, Harry can’t help but feel the weight of guilt from all the other times he’s been in here, in trouble…
Suddenly, he hears footsteps coming up the stairs behind him and turns his head around.
”, Umbridge’s simpering voice filters through the oak.
Harry blinks, startled and follows Mister Worple’s eyes to the vampire who in the last few minutes must have wandered away from them, seemingly making his way over to a group of witches with a particularly hungry look in his eyes, which, Harry is astonished to notice, didn’t seem to terrify the girls at all. Quite the opposite.
”So, don’t you go talking to us like we’re dirt on your shoes —”
”Potter…” Professor Snape growls quietly. ”I don’t know what game you’re playing, but I will not be drawn into it…”
Draco isn’t the only fifth year acting strangely now that they’re nearing the end of May and June is tapping them impatiently on the shoulder, reminding them of their imminent examinations.
When they reach Hagrid’s hut, they’re surprised to see all the curtains drawn. Harry knocks on the door and Hagrid calls, ”Who is it?” before opening the door and ushering them inside.
”Okay…” Remus says slowly, his voice carefully neutral.
”They better”, Draco mutters.
”Yeah”, Draco mumbles. ”Better not.”
”So, now that we are all fed and watered”, he says gently, smiling down at them. ”I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices… Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frosbees and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it…”
”It’s your daddy’s wolfsbane. Don’t break it.”
— but finally he just opens his mouth and lets it all tumble out, all of it… He tells Draco about doing the essay on werewolves and putting the pieces together, that his daddy never told him and still hasn’t told him, but Harry figured it out and tonight… Harry just shakes his head as tears tumble down his face…
kill Viktor Krum, now, mightn’t we?”
”Malfoy and Finnigan are fighting”, Blaise mutters churlishly.
… You’re not allowed to use that… that…
, are you?”
He rights himself on the broom and ducks as the bludger makes one final attempt to hit him, then gently touches down on the ground, still clutching the snitch since he’s the last person to try out. He hands the small ball to Flint who gives him an appraising look.
”Seriously though”, he tells Harry then. ”It took a few centuries, but once we started paying attention to the things we had in common, rather than the things we didn’t, we started getting along quite well… He thinks so, too… He’s just a bit of a stubborn grump, is all.”
”Sorry…” Harry mumbles again, voice scratchy suddenly and he swallows thickly past the small lump swelling in his throat.
”I don’t know”, Malfoy says in a mock casual tone, waving a hand around vaguely. ”Maybe after a late Quidditch practise or something, both of you taking your sweet time in the showers, waiting for everyone else to leave, then when it’s just the two of you…”
Based on what the younger Dumbledore had managed to lure out of him, he was already using magic to hurt other people. Even then, not even eleven years old.
”That won’t work…” Draco mumbles uncomfortably. ”You don’t know my father, he refuses to answer questions… the only way you’re going to get anything out of him is if you make him forget you’re actually there and then, if you’re lucky, he might let something slip.”
”What do you — how — no — no, she’s not — she wouldn’t —” Pansy shakes her head violently, her gaze finding Granger again across the dance floor.
”Wait, what? You
As soon as he’s finished speaking, a large, revolving shape appears inside the flames and in the next moment, Harry daddy steps out of the fireplace looking particularly grim with soot on his face and ash stains on his robes.
”Yes”, Dumbledore mumbles, his eyes darting between Harry and Remus again, hesitating for another second. ”Yes, we shall leave you to it… I might be stopping by in a day or two, just to see how things are going…?”
Harry shakes off the sleep tugging at him and sits up a little against the headboard of the bed.
Remus arranges to meet up with the Malfoys in The Leaky Cauldron just before noon and then spends the rest of the morning fussing over Harry’s clothes and trying to get his hair under control with a wet comb. Harry finally ducks away after an especially painful yank and Remus gives up with a sigh.
Oh, it must look very weird indeed, Harry realises. Seeing only strips of meat being pulled from the bones and then disappearing into thin air.
If it’s a weekend, his dads might even sleep in and he can sneak a couple of cups into his room and save for later… but usually, at least one of them will hear the kettle and join him in the kitchen before the coffee is done, and they’ll make him some toast and ask him how he’s slept… two out of three mornings he’ll lie and tell them he’s slept fine; those are the mornings when he hasn’t slept at all, and he can almost fool himself into thinking it’s not
”Am I right, or am I right…” she murmurs.
that makes Harry jump slightly.
”No! No, I’m innocent! I haven’t done anything!”
”I could lend you the money if you rather not go inside Gringotts today?”
Harry catches himself leaning over the table top again, batting his eye lashes in a mock flirtatious gesture. Malfoy’s lips twitch a little in amusement, but it’s a delayed reaction and his eyes are gleaming with something that’s not amusement at all.
”Harry Potter, Sir!” another voice squeals and Harry turns around to see none other than the house-elf he freed from the Malfoys almost a year ago, looking almost exactly as Harry remembers with its pencil-shaped nose, tennis ball-shaped eyes and huge bat-like ears. The only thing that’s changed is the elf’s clothing. Rather than a filthy pillow-case, the elf is now wearing a ghastly tie over his bare chest, short shorts made of some weird, shiny muggle material and a stained tea cosy as a hat.
(See the end of the chapter for
He leads him to a classroom that Harry wouldn’t have known was the DADA classroom at all if he hadn’t recognised the paintings in the hallway outside. Without the many portraits of Lockhart crowding the walls, the room is quite unrecognisable. Remus keeps ushering him to the back of the classroom, then opens the door to the office and lets him step inside.
”I mean he was possessing the snake at the time, so you dreamed you were inside the snake, too”, Snape snaps, wrenching his right hand away from his left wrist and clamping both hands down on the armrests of the chair. ”The important point is, now that the Dark Lord is aware of your ability to access his thoughts and emotions, he has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realised that he might be able to access
”Now, listen to me…” she says softly, her voice quivering in a show of sincerity. ”You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead —”
”Well, I’m sorry”, Harry says again, stomach churning. ”I would never —
”All students will return to their house common rooms by six o’clock in the evening”, Snape states seriously. ”No student is to leave the dormitories after that time — no exceptions — and you will all be escorted to each of your classes by a teacher… No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher… All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed—”
thought so, even
you dropped it in the woods, it’s not the end of the world… Come on, calm down, have some more chocolate…”
and slumps back in his seat with a sullen sigh.
”Yeah, maybe”, Draco mumbles thickly, then nods decisively. ”Yeah. That’s a good idea. I can owl from Hogwarts, that should be safe… I’ll do that.”
The other man heaves a sigh, but pushes himself to his feet and comes to stand behind Harry’s chair next to Remus.
Professor Snape’s eyes had narrowed as he stammered out,
”It’s
”You’re a Parselmouth, Potter”, Snape says sharply. ”You didn’t know?”
”It’s been so good to have you home, Harry”, he murmurs thickly, sniffling into his hair. ”You be good now and keep out of trouble, okay?”
”Crying?” Harry says surprised.
”Ready, Harry?” Bagman’s booming voice rings out across the Stadium and Harry nods quickly. ”Well, in position then…”
Snape gives him a small nod of acknowledgement, but his eyes immediately flit back to glare at Sirius’s back.
”It’s just a scratch—”
”It wasn’t that urgent”, he mumbles, feeling his face burn.
”So? Why can’t I stay here with you?”
”Come on, let’s go talk in my office…”
”No, don’t be silly…” Draco frowns, shaking his head dismissively.
Harry thinks as he trails after the blonde towards the dorm.
His abdomen tightens with pulsing pressure and for some reason, Harry manages to create enough presence of mind to think he needs to warn the other boy… but not enough presence of mind to

”How is it okay?” Draco says quietly, his eyes wide.
”No”, he says again and actually means it. ”I’m okay.”
”It was my idea, though…”
and part
”How?” Harry demands. ”You think it’d be obvious? Could you tell
The low, rumbling voice of Professor Snape alerts Harry of his Head of House’s presence a second before the man appears behind Draco. His black eyes quickly finds Harry and then flicker down to his arm; his face immediately drains of what little colour it had to start with and he whips his head around and fixes Lockhart with a piercing death glare.
”And why would we want to raise them?” Draco asks shrewdly from his vantage point behind Harry’s shoulder and Harry turns his head to see a familiar sneer, barely concealing a spark of worry in the blonde’s steel grey eyes. ”I mean, what do they
”—way! Yes, Mr Potter, you had something to say?” she adds, the sweetness now gone from her voice.
Harry frowns. Why would Professor Snape of all people be afraid of his daddy’s wrath? If anything, his dad is the one with a temper…
. He scowls at her, but she simply sits back still smirking calmly, looking very much like a cat that’s just stuffed itself on cream that wasn’t meant for it.
”—you’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words!” Slughorn’s booming voice continues, but without any of its previous joviality.
Deeper and deeper into the Forest, the trees grow so close together the starry sky is completely hidden from view overhead and Harry’s cloak keep snagging on the branches. Deciding it’s more trouble than it’s worth, Harry removes the cloak and stuffs it into his pocket before continuing the trek.
Yes, he’s faced him several times and got away. But each time he’s only done so because of a combination of insane luck and the protective magic of others. Harry is under no delusions that his own powers and skills are even close to a match for someone like Voldemort.
”Fine…” Harry sighs.
Draco and his friends. But by the sounds of it, he’s lucky if he even gets out of the maze alive…
Harry thinks and plucks at the Spellotape.
”Okay”, Harry nods in agreement.
”And if I make the team, I’m expecting you to at least make a button”, Harry says.
”—and Mr Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.”
”Brilliant!” Draco squeals. ”This isn’t magic — it’s logic — Oh, that’s so clever! Most people haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever!”
Remus looks down and nods, ”Yes, it is. I usually just curl up and sleep through the full moon.”
”Yeah, be right there!”
”Hello Remus, Sirius — Happy Christmas!” Molly Weasley says as she ushers her children in front of her towards the barrier. ”Oh, and to you too, Harry dear…”
What the Hell do you think you’re—?” Sirius barks, but then cuts himself off suddenly.
But he’s not even the same person now. Even if he could time travel back to this spot a year ago, would Draco even recognise him? Would he even be
”Go”, Remus mutters. ”We’ll see you when we see you…”
Even Harry feels a thrill at the idea of winning a phial of Felix Felicis and scans the pages of his copy of
”Ehm, yeah, sure…”
Feeling a twinge in his chest, Harry looks between Draco’s smug face as he begins to read the article out loud and Ron’s steadily darkening face as he listens.
”And don’t forget to ask your parents about Nicholas Flamel”, Harry whispers quickly before he runs into Sirius’s waiting arms and hugs him tightly.
Harry quickly finds the Entrance Hall on the map and follows the two dots labelled
Blinking hot tears from his eyes, Harry flattens himself along his Nimbus and speeds up, plummeting towards the ground and pulling up at the last minute, his heart pounding… swerving faster and faster; flying in tighter and tighter loops to mirror the progress of his thoughts, until he’s too dizzy to think at all, and then he simply cruises in lazy figure eights over the tree tops and lets his pulse settle down again…
He quickly averts his eyes again. Sirius snickers next to him and Harry throws him a half-hearted glare.
Harry unhooks the latch on the window and beams as Bertram swoops inside and lands deftly on top of his shoulder.
”Spells?” Harry asks blankly.
The Potions Master’s black eyes narrow into dangerous slits and Harry feels his heart leap into his throat and quickly adds a
”Well, that is his prerogative, it is his private business—”
”Good. Now off to bed with you.
” He repeats. ”Really?”
”That’s okay”, Harry mumbles awkwardly. ”Is that why daddy left?”
He flicks his wand and a glass box containing what first appears to be a small cloud, or a wisp of smoke comes floating out of his office and lands on top of the teacher’s desk. On closer inspection, they can make out a pair of pale yellow eyes, a spindly leg and a frail-looking hand clutching a small lantern.
”Come on, Harry”, Sirius says in a long-suffering voice.
”Having fun in the snow?” he asks with a knowing grin. ”It’s jolly good fun, isn’t it? I love a good snowball fight, myself!”
”Wait”, Draco says hurriedly, as Harry moves to walk past him. ”I’m sorry. I didn’t mean… I’m just…”
”Oh, come on, lighten up…” Draco huffs later as they’re trudging through the snow back up to the castle. ”
”I’M NOT GOING TO DIE!” Harry hollers right back.
”He’s not good, he’s great”, Flint says. ”I’m sure we’re going to win today!”
Blaise shrugs with a smirk and hands the bottle to Ron, who grabs it from him with a scowl and without tearing his glare away from the other boy, he grouses out, ”Truth or Dare?”
Harry waits for Draco to choose a pouffe for himself next to Pansy and then deliberately chooses an armchair on the other end of the room. He imagines he can feel the blonde’s eyes on him but forces himself to keep staring ahead.
He watches Professor Dumbledore move his wand carefully, wrapping thin glowing tendrils around the blonde before performing a Locomotor spell to move him off the ground.
”It’s good to see you again, Mr Lupin. I hope you had a good holiday?”
It’s very obvious who is on her list of suspects for the prank, he thinks. Because he never catches her narrow her eyes suspiciously at Draco or Blaise, nor Pansy and Daphne, as she does at him. He does catch her do that to Seamus, though. And the Weasley twins and their friend, the Quidditch commentator, Lee Jordan.
As it is, he merely glances at them briefly before turning to page two and starts skimming the article.
”—We know it off by heart by now, anyway! So it’s all yours…”
He tells him earnestly, ”No, I just wish I could come stay with you immediately.”
is only temporary; Draco just needs to cool down and then things will be back to normal.
he thinks sourly.
”Says you”, Sirius mutters. ”If I’m stuck inside for another day without much to do, I’m going to go stir crazy…”
you mean?”
”There’s plenty of time”, Remus says and pours coffee into a second cup for Harry. ”I’m actually surprised you’re up this early, Harry. Usually we have to drag you out of bed when it’s time to leave…”
In Divination they begin to learn about palmistry and Professor Trelawny proceeds to inform Harry, loudly enough for the whole class to hear, that he has the shortest life line she has ever seen.
The atmosphere in the Common Room starts to shift a while after that. Some of the older students have begun to take turns sneaking food and various beverages in from outside and some have reappeared from the dorms or showers looking decidely dressed up —
”You’re in for a rough night, m’boy… Re-growing bones is a nasty business.”
”What is going on here?” the stern voice Professor McGonagall barks and Harry is immensely grateful to see the old witch come marching down the marble staircase.
At the sight of the Magical Menagerie, Harry’s mind finally slows to a stop and he can focus again. There’s not much room inside, every inch of wall covered by different sized cages and it’s both smelly and noisy, the occupants of the cages all squeaking, squawking, jabbering or hissing, but Harry couldn’t have been more excited. He’s always wanted a pet, but his fathers always told him he was too young, and that a pet was a big responsibility…
have seen it… If I go to Snape and tell him, I’ll have to explain to him that not only did I not do my relaxation exercises before bed, I was also completely sloshed…”
The majority of the class, mainly the gryffindors, immediately burst into a chorus of complaints about Snape’s behaviour while filling in as DADA teacher and setting them such a difficult homework assignment, but Remus smiles gently and gestures for silence.
Harry glances over at Snape quickly. The man’s eyes glitter dangerously, but his face remains impassive.
”Sorry, Sir…”
”Oh, oh — Devil’s Snare —
Harry can guess that he’s looking for signs of Death Eater activity or possibly something that will give him a hint of how his own parents are doing. The gut feeling is confirmed when the blonde stops flicking the pages, his face draining of colour as he stares down at the headline:
In the dorm, after he’s disposed of the books and homework on top of his trunk to be sorted later, he helps Harry out of his uniform and then gentle rubs some salve into the still bleeding cut. As soon as the salve starts to work its magic and soothe the stinging wound enough that Harry can focus on something other than the pain, he notices for the first time just how tense his boyfriend is. His face is drawn and his whole body is tight with tension, as he works silently and efficiently.
”Can you get rid of him”, Harry grumbles, providing the blonde with an alternative way to help him.
”That… that’s actually really clever…” Harry murmurs. ”I can’t believe no-one’s thought of it before!”
”Severus is a very accomplished Legilimens.”
”What? Fine… Who don’t you want to invite, Harry?”
Harry realises with a jolt. The phoenix is flying around the Basilisk head, scratching its’ skin with its’ sharp talons — and then suddenly it dives and Harry can see it’s long, golden beak sink out of sight and before he knows what’s happened, the Basilisk lets out a loud hiss that sounds almost like a wail and it turns its head, looking right at Harry —
Harry hears the door slide open with a familiar creak and a couple of swift footsteps approach — also familiar — then stop again abruptly.
”What did it smell like?” the blonde asks.
”No news, just my dads checking in. They say to say hi as well”, he says and finally looks up.
”You okay, pup?” Remus murmurs quietly.
… Clearly, whatever made the witch croak like a toad, wasn’t that easy for Madam Pomfrey to fix.
to accommodate this in our lesson plans—”
Harry watches him fondly and chuckles tiredly as makes another hilarious observation that has Pansy snorting with laughter and Daphne clutching her sides. Their laughter finally dies down as Professor Snape comes striding down the length of the Slytherin table, handing out their timetables with a stern look on his face.
Harry nods again.
”Stop it!”
away from Harry and narrowly misses cuffing him in the chin with its’ corner in his haste to wave it at the Gryffindors.
take credit for the mayhem that Umbridge has had to put up with — but this is better, he tells himself. She suspects he’s behind it all, but has no way of pinning it on him… It’s perfect.
Mind made up, Harry jumps off the bed and shakes out the invisibility cloak with determination. Draco watches him with huge, terrified eyes and before Harry has even opened his mouth the blonde is shaking his head furiously.
Harry looks over at the snowy white owl again and feels a pinching sensation in his chest. He can’t choose. He’s fallen in love with them both.
”There hasn’t been an attack for months! Maybe the monster has gone back into hibernation or something…”
”Fine…” Harry says heavily and slouches down in his seat. ”Can I ask one more thing though?”
, he thinks heartily.
They weave through the dancing crowd and make their way over to the refreshments table in the corner. Harry wipes the sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his robe while Ron pours them both a cup of punch.
, Harry realises with a jolt and stares in bewilderment at her twisted face.
”He can’t breathe”, he squeals and fixes Harry with a tearful look.
which he’s never even heard of, and what’s even weirder is that it’s got the exact same layout and typeface as
Feeling all eyes on him as he hurries to his feet and promptly trips over the hem of his dress robes, Harry quickly grabs Ron’s arm as he the taller boy reaches out to catch him. Face burning, Harry mutters a

that the reality of the situation really dawns on Harry, and he remembers that time when Remus got into an argument with Barty Crouch Sr. over Harry’s entry in the Triwizard Tournament and Harry found out that Remus wasn’t actually registered as his legal guardian…
Harry tears his eyes away from the blood red words and squints at the dark shadow beneath them… Despite Draco grabbing his arm tightly enough to leave bruises and hissing at him to
”They—?” Harry snaps his mouth shut again and straightens up quickly, his heart pounding in his chest.
”Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you, Sir…”
”What — what’s — going on?” Harry gasps, struggling not to trip over as Professor Snape continues to drag him through the doorway, down the corridor and into his office.
Harry quickly turns back to Snape and catches an amused twitch of the man’s lips before he schools his face into his usual stoic mask and meets Harry’s eyes.
When he enters the Fifth Year Boys’ dorm, everyone is standing in a kind of semi-circle in front of Snape, exchanging curious looks with each other, until they hear Harry push the door open. Then they all turn to stare at him instead.
” Sirius calls back from the hallway.
Slughorn brewed some to show us—!”
”Okay”, Ginny repeats, looking extremely relieved. ”So I can tell Hermione you’ll be there? At Midday on Saturday?”
”Now, now, don’t be disheartened, Harry… You’ve made great progress… A Shielding Charm, however indescreet, is still an effective way of shielding your mind from the Dark Lord’s penetration… You have done good. We are merely taking you to the next level.”
He stops just as abruptly as he started walking, causing Draco to bump into his back. The blonde seems to take the opportunity to wrap his arms around him and hug him from behind. Harry feels the sudden tension drain out of him again and melts into his boyfriend’s embrace, allowing himself to sway together to the music.
” he sobs.
”There’s no need, Harry — really — plus they wouldn’t be able to do anything”, Sirius says heavily. ”The threats are always anonymous…”
”No”, Harry says firmly, shaking his head and then, a horrible thought occurs to him and looks over at his dad. ”Why? Did you?”
With a forlorn sigh, he climbs into bed and snuggles under the covers before closing the bed hangings around him with a flick of his wand. And for the first time in his life, he actually welcomes the darkness…
Professor Snape’s black eyes flicker down to Harry’s hand and widen as they come to rest on the patch of raw skin. His face drains of what little colour it had to start with and he takes a deep breath.
Harry brushes the soot off and looks around with interest. The sitting room is huge. It looks like a ballroom. Narcissa Malfoy stands in the middle of the room with her hands clasped in front of her, the glow of the gigantic chandelier hanging above her head making her white-blonde hair glow golden. Harry smiles at her.
”No it’s okay”, Draco says quickly, before either of the older men has a chance to say anything else. ”It’s more than okay. I don’t mind at all.”
”Headmaster”, Snape snaps coldly and the dread immediately gives way to relief as Harry realises that the scowl in not for him at all.
”Okay”, Harry says, not fully understanding his boyfriend’s reasoning, but happy to support him in the decision anyway.
The other boy just shrugs awkwardly. For a moment, they just stand there in the middle of the road, halfway between Hogsmeade and Hogwarts, staring helplessly at each other as the weight of the situation settles over them. Blaise, whose pathological nonchalance is usually evident by the seemingly permanent smirk on his face, now looks drawn and the grimace that twists his lips in lieu of a smile fills Harry with a hopelessness he hasn’t felt since Narcissa Side-Alonged him to that pub at the end of the summer and left him there.
Before long, Harry starts to drift off where he’s snuggled into his daddy’s embrace and only half-listening to his dads whispered conversation.
Draco finally agrees not to go to Snape, but he’s still not convinced of Harry’s theory. And as the weeks go by, and their final exams are looming ever nearer, Draco becomes less and less interested in the Philosopher’s Stone and more and more worried about his revisions.
”—and
It’s the weirdest sensation; as if hanging upside-down in the crisp February air before being lowered head-first into ice cold water, Harry feels like someone has suddenly dumped a bucket of fresh air over him, as his head breaks through the surface… Gulping desperately, he sucks in a lungful of it and splutters.
”And then you go through the Visitors’ entrance, like we just did?”
”Professor, Weasley’s mutilating my roots, Sir…”
When Harry returns to the top of the steps, he can tell Professor Snape is itching to throw a Locomotor Spell on his trunk as he awkwardly and loudly manoeuvres it down the stairs, his fingers literally twitching at his sides before he resolutely pull them into fists and the slits of his dark eyes flit over to Dursley in annoyance. The trunk gains momentum and thunders down the last few steps and then falls over onto the hallway floor, narrowly missing Harry foot and he swears.
”Twelve years ago, James and Lily went into hiding because the Voldemort was after them, after—”
Feeling slightly indignant, Harry frowns.
”Yeah, of course, what—?” Harry frowns, looking between Dumbledore and the two wizards in front of them, then remembers the snake nailed to the front door of the house. ”Oh — is he speaking parseltongue?”
memories, as opposed to trying to block me out entirely… If you are successful, the next step will be to try and guide me towards
Sirius snorts humourlessly and shakes his head.
”What?” Sirius barks.
”No. Stranger.”
He recognises the man as the muggle — Mr Roberts — who pointed them in the direction of their campsite, and the other three must be his wife and children, Harry thinks with a sinking feelings as he watches in mute horror as the four muggles struggle and writhe in pain…
Then suddenly, he feels a large hand grip his shoulder and give him a rough jostle, dislodging his grip from the thestral. He feels panic flare up in his chest and his heart begins to hammer wildly.
Harry looks over at the Gryffindor table and catches Ron’s envious look before the redhead quickly looks away again. He’s not the only one though. In fact, it seems like every student at both the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables are either glaring at the Slytherins or making moon eyes at Krum. Throwing another furtive look at the boy’s sharp profile, Harry realises he can probably be counted amongst the latter.
”Blaggard—”
”Your mum’s birthday is in July? So’s mine!”
”Those of you who
the one shaking, not his daddy…
I want to go home—!”
Harry thinks, his heart thudding hard in his chest.
”No, Sir”, Harry says. ”I think I’ve found the entrance to the Chamber.”
”I can do it myself”, Harry protests feebly, but they both ignore him.
”Well, come on then. Let’s go find him, so you can make up already…” Zabini says in a long-suffering voice and Harry bristles.
”Yes…” the witch mutters, looking none too pleased about it. ”I have been lead to understand you’ve been inside the Department already, mister Potter.”
He tries to drown out the noise of the audience and Bagman’s nerve-wrackingly vivid commentary. The canvas walls of the tent have gone from the light yellow of mid-day to a deep orange as the afternoon wears on and evening begins to fall.
”I thought so, that’s what I told Pansy…” he mumbles.
”You sure did!
Harry doesn’t dare respond. The Potions Master seems to be vibrating with a contained emotion and Harry is scared to find out which one it is. Instead, he nods his head and plants his feet squarely on the ground, raising his wand with a steeling breath.
Remus tells him simply and smiles…
”So you don’t know how to get back…” the boy says, sadly.
”Now?” Harry says uncertainly.
He swallows thickly and wets his lips. His heart has begun to hammer inside his chest as his own words bounce back at him and fills him with some kind of purpose. He’s aware of Pansy’s narrowed eyes finding the side of his face, but ignores her and keeps his own gaze pinned to Slughorn’s. It’s all an act, all part of the plan. Except a part of him is acutely aware that none of what he’s saying is actually untrue.
Harry just shakes his head.
”Get Madam Pomfrey”, Dumbledore whispers.
”Yes, I wanted to ask you something… If you don’t mind…”
”Now that
Remus levitates the cake over to him and makes it hover in midair in front of his face so he can blow out the thirteen candles, before directing it to perch on top of a pile of books on the bedside table.
”A wise move”, Snape murmurs. ”For once… Now get out of my sight.”
They walk a few paces away from the other two Gryffindors and the half-finished snowman, the unnaturally loud crunching of the snow under their feet highlighting the silence between them. Harry glances up at the other boy, noticing how much taller he’s become since the last time they were this close and swallowing a sigh… seems like every boy in their year, apart from Harry, is having growth spurt after growth spurt…
”Yeah, Draco?”
Harry and Draco exchange a look and quickly make their way out of the Common Room before the fight escalates further.
”, Harry says sharply and gives the other boy a pinch when he snickers, then promptly smothers the resulting yelp with another kiss.
Draco’s eyes widen in horror and his face drains of what little colour it had to begin with.
, he thinks miserably.
managed to read the simple instructions and follow them”, Snape tells the rest of the class. ”Fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing… homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
”So… if you’re tutoring me, but I’m not allowed to stay here, then… am I going to stay with you?” Harry says slowly.
Just then, the door to the dormitory opens and Draco comes in. His blonde hair is wet and slicked back from his face and he’s carrying a damp towel and some toiletries.
Harry shuffles over to the slightly smaller chair in front of him and slumps into it. There is no Pensieve on the desk between them this time. Instead the wooden surface is covered with pamphlets similar to the ones that has appeared in the Common Room.
Harry scrambles to his feet and wrenches the bedroom door open. He thunders down the stairs, disproportionately happy to see his Potions Master framed in the doorway and scowling darkly at Vernon Dursley, who’s yet to invite him in.
cosy, and so far quite private as well (the only other customer to have entered the teashop since they sat down is a witch in her late twenties, sipping black coffee from a massive mug while writing something on a piece of parchment trailing over the edge of her table), but that’s not the only reason Harry likes it. Although he would never admit it out loud, the main reason he likes it is because neither one of them have been here before, so there’s no history for either of them.
”No, no, I don’t believe that…” Draco murmurs quietly and peers up at Harry sheepishly from behind his long fringe.
, he thinks.
”What do you plan to do?” Lupin chokes out hopefully, wiping his face quickly on the back of his hand as he pulls away from Sirius.
”Wow…” Harry breathes and steps outside, staring in wonder at the display in front of him.
”I know”, Harry mutters, throwing a surreptitious glance down both ends of the corridor.
Once they’re safely in the second-year boys’ dormitory, Harry tries to question his friend about this legend of the Chamber of Secrets, but the boy is very elusive and quickly disappears behind the hangings of his bed, claiming he’s exhausted and wants to go to bed.
”Yes, well”, Remus says in a rather clipped tone. ”It’s complicated, is all I’m saying…”
”And my pet”, Harry says, worried that his daddy might have forgotten his promise, but at the man’s amused smile, he realises he’s being teased.
But he can’t tell them any of it, because his throat has closed up again.
Harry is riddled with nerves all day and by the time he’s back in Professor Snape’s office for his Occlumensy lesson, his stomach is so knotted with anxiety that he fears he might throw up, or faint, or both.
Harry gives the bag a hard tug, but instead of pulling the dwarf off his feet as Harry had hoped, his entire bag rips open and all his books sprawl out around him on the floor and his ink bottle breaks and splatters ink all over them.
”I also confiscated this”, Snape says quietly and holds up the blank map.
Even after finding out his dads have been dealing with something so sinister, essentially because of him —
The next thing he knows, he’s lying on his back on the cold stone floor and Professor Snape’s worried face is looming over him. Something slaps against the side of his face suddenly, jostling him out of his sluggish stupor and he blinks some of the cobwebs from eyes and glares up at the Potions Master.
from?” Harry exclaims.
”I had suspected”, the other man mutters. ”Well… do try to remember what House you
He looks up and gives Remus a grateful, teary smile and the older wizard nods in understanding, smiling back. Harry cranes his neck to get a better look at the book cover.
wrong
Harry nods quickly and looks back at the Headmaster. There is a new tension in the old man’s body and the sharp glint in his eyes is now unmistakable. Harry takes a deep breath and begins to talk. He’s aware that some of the tension leaves the Headmaster’s shoulders again the more he tells him, but the alertness in his eyes doesn’t turn twinkly again. Harry feels an odd shiver at being taken so seriously, it makes it all more real somehow.
… Because I don’t have all the information I need…”
”Hey, you made the team, too”, Harry says. ”We still get to practise together!”
”What?” Draco yelps next to him.
”I’m fine”, Harry says shortly.
”Yeah…” Sirius with a dry chuckle. ”But… I’m not like Remus, I don’t have his… instincts… you know? Half the time I have no idea what I’m doing, and the other half I’m sure I get it wrong anyway, but he… he just knows exactly what to say and do, no matter what the situation is… I envy his and your relationship sometimes — No, that’s not true — I didn’t mean that. I just…”
As if reading his thoughts, Remus starts to tell him anyway and Harry gets to see his daddy’s eyes well up with tears for the second time in his life and just like the first time, it shakes him to the core. He cautiously walks up to the desk and perches on the seat opposite Remus as the man struggles to choose his words.
”Snape, get Harry out of here!” Sirius bellows before he too transforms — into a big, black dog!
Harry isn’t sure he’ll be able to continue playing, his mind too distracted by worry for his boyfriend to focus on finding the Snitch. Madam Hooch seems to think the same thing, because she pins him with a narrowed look and asks him if he wants to swap for his substitute. He thinks about it, but in the end decides it’s unfair to the rest of the team. They still need their Captain, so he wouldn’t be able to leave and go sit with Draco in the Hospital Wing. And if he needs to be here anyway, he rather play than sit in his worry.
but…”
Within moments, Diggory and Fleur have swam ashore as well. Diggory with an arm around Cho Chang, but Fleur empty-handed and quite hysterical, as she had to leave her hostage at the bottom of the lake when she couldn’t get past the Grindylows… Madam Maxime restrains her and tries to calm her down, but the girl doesn’t stop fighting her until one of the merpeople bring her hostage to the shore. It’s a young girl with similarly long, blonde hair as Fleur herself and Harry thinks it must be the Beauxbatons champion’s little sister.
Harry lets out a sob and turns away, curling up against the headboard and hugging the pillow to his chest miserably.
at the top, but none of them seem to be addressed to him at all — feeling a wave of relief wash over him with such force it nearly knocks him over, Harry lets out a chuckle.
your condition, though?” Harry asks finally, silently wishing not to find out which is why, when Remus makes a vague excuse and changes the subject, Harry doesn’t press the matter.
”What’s a thestral?” Seamus asks from where he’s squeezed in on Harry’s other side.
from Hogwarts.”
But he’s not about to offer to help with the trunk, Harry realises almost immediately, because the man’s hands are dangling tensely at his sides, pulled into tight, trembling fists. Harry swallows a sigh.
He slumps down on the nearest available surface gratefully, aware that he’s hugging his book bag to his chest and quickly puts it down on the floor next to his feet. Granger smiles kindly at him.
When he was following them, they’d been the largest spiders he’s ever seen… Until now —
got a Nimbus 2000, as well —!” Draco whispers excitedly.
He makes the rounds, shaking hands with the guests and even hugs Andromeda back when she throws her arms around him and exclaims I can’t believe how much you’ve grown in a watery voice. Harry gives her a pinched smile as he pulls out of the hug again, moving over to say good bye to Professor Dumbledore.
”Aberforth, the old man who runs the Hog’s Head Inn, said he saw two of them attacking you behind his pub. He… he chased them away and then brought you home”, Remus says thickly, unconsciously tightening his grip on Harry’s hand.
Still gasping for breath, Harry blinks some of the blurriness away from his eyes and vaguely register the chill on his cheeks as the warm tears quickly cool. There is an immense chimney in the near distance, a relic from a disused mill or factory that now stands shadowy and ominous in the gloomy dark, dispersed only by a couple of streetlamps.
”Oh-ho!” the portraits says. ”Such impertinence!”
As the first song finally finishes and a new one starts, most of the students grab their partners and flood the dance floor all around them.
Huffing out an annoyed sigh, Harry reaches for his wand and starts correcting his essay, replacing the word
Harry wakes up to the feeling of being
Go think about what I’ve said —”
”The hell it is—!”
”Ha-ha”, Harry chuckles.
”That one”, Blaise jabs the bottle in the general direction of Ron. ”Truth or Dare?”
”He has a name, Marcus”, Adrian says in a long-suffering voice.
Morfin says viciously.
”Yes”, Remus says shortly.
A few hands shoot up and Harry isn’t surprised to see Granger’s twitching eagerly in the air, but he
”What the hell do you think doing?” he hisses, stomping over to the table and slumping into the chair opposite.
”On three then…” he says and reaches out for the cup again. ”One… Two… Three…”
”Well clearly it’s not working.”
”Dear, dear…” Lucius tuts. ”That temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid… I woud advice you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won’t like it at all.”
Harry feels all of two centimetres tall when he’s reminded of what he’s done, and what it means. The churning ball of guilt in his stomach grows bigger again, spitting out acid that rises to Harry’s throat like bile.
to each other and head in opposite directions. Harry slips inside the Sixth Year boys’ dorm as quietly as he can, so as not to wake up the others. He curls up in his bed and lies awake for the longest time, just listening to Crabbe and Seamus’ snores.
”Thank you”, Narcissa says shortly.
Harry stares.
”Yeah, but…” Harry blinks. ”But I’m not allowed my broom, just my wand —”
”He doesn’t care what it was like for you
Finally, at the stroke of ten, Umbridge lets them leave. They trudge through the castle in tense silence. Not until they reach the end of the spiral staircase leading to the dungeons does Draco open his mouth to mutter grimly, ”Now let’s see if father cares about her methods of discipline…”
Professor Snape nods curtly, his face revealing nothing, but there’s a glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes that tells Harry this is surprisingly good news.
Gryffindors
”Well, he feels angry, presumably!” Granger answers for him and Harry frowns. ”Who wouldn’t be? He’s told the Minister of Magic the truth, yet the Minister is too much of an idiot to believe him—”
”I know…” the other boy mumbles in a small voice.
”Yeah?”
”No”, Professor Snape says suddenly and Diggory turns around in surprise. ”He’s not here — I’ll explain later — just move on to the next one.”
”Wonder what cutsie name he came up with —
The lopsided gash of a mouth widens in a slightly manic grin and both the good and the magical eye seem to shine with excitement.
He lies flat along his broom and speeds up, catching up to the small golden ball as it tries to flit away from him. He throws himself sideways and tumbles in the air as the snitch zips to the side and manages to swat it with his numbing fingers, then clutches it tightly in his fist and pulls the broom up into the air again only seconds before colliding with the ground.
A dozen small groups of Slytherins are spread out across the Common Room, pockets of social hubs of various ages that are scattered around the room. Some are just chatting, some are playing games. There are also one or two individuals not part of any of the groups, just reading to themselves. Harry can see Malfoy across the room, reading to himself but still part of the group of friends that Harry had also been part of this past week.
Harry hides his smile behind his hand and looks away. He can hear Ron coughing, but it definitely sounds amused.
She waves Harry in and he quickly stumbles after her into the back of the shop where a boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blonde hair is standing on a footstool while a second witch is pinning up his long black robes.
”I hate when you do that”, Ron grumbles, glaring between the two of them.
Harry hangs his head and sighs.
Several of the Slytherins raise their hands and even Harry starts to tentaively raise his, but Hagrid turns to Granger with a beaming smile and tells her, ”Go on then!”
”No, I was just thinking… The Quidditch field is too open and we’d be silhouetted against the sky, look… If someone were to look out a window, they’d definitely see us if we fly there…”
is barely audible.
The lawn is empty.
”PARTY IN THE COMMON ROOM!” Seamus shouts at the top of his voice, but it’s quickly drowned out by a deafening roar of cheers.
”Oh, Sirius, before I forget”, Remus says lightly. ”I need you to take a look at the grandfather clock in the lounge, I think there’s a Boggart in it…”
”Morning”, he mumbles quietly, fingering the handle of his Nimbus nervously, unable to look up. ”I couldn’t sleep, so I… I just went for a fly…”
”What?”
Hagrid, McGonagall, Flitwick and Moody come traipsing towards them, the three shorter professors all wearing pointy hats with big red stars on them while Hagrid has stuck his star to the back of his moleskin coat.
!” Draco snarls. ”He only cares about himself and his — his —
A heavy silence sinks down over the group. No-one makes a glib joke or sarcastic comment. Harry swallows thickly and watches Draco exchange a look with Blaise and Pansy. The girl’s face seems paler than before, he notices. He almost wishes she would make a flippant comment now.
Harry wheels around and stares at the Sphinx. Her serene smile widens and she gives him a slow nod, then strecthes her legs out on front of her and stands up again.
He looks up again and pins the woman with his coldest stare.
Steeling himself, Harry walks up to them with determination.
”Yes, Sir?”
The next morning, Harry and his friends try their hardest to pretend everything’s normal and Seamus and Pansy in particular try to maintain a lighthearted stream of chitchat throughout breakfast, but it’s slightly negated by the obvious lack of redheads over at the Gryffindor table and every time Harry looks up from his bowl of porridge he is reminded of another redhead, spurting blood and screaming in pain…
Soon they’re joined by Fleur Delacour and her partner, a very handsome blonde boy from Beauxbatons, wearing matching silver and blue, and Diggory with his arm around the waist of a pretty Ravenclaw Fifth Year called Cho Chang, whom Harry recognises from the Quidditch pitch. She has the Seeker position on the Ravenclaw team and is very good.
Harry immediately walks up to him and snuggles into his other side, transferring some of his weight from Sirius to himself and together the three of them walk into the lounge and collapse on the sofa. Sirius gently disentangles himself from his husband again and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek before disappearing out into the kitchen to start supper.
” Harry adds hurriedly. ”We were just talking and happened to fall asleep!”
Riddle’s face falls and contorts hideously into a scowl.
He trails off. Harry doesn’t need the pregnant pause to read the subtext in what he’s saying, though. He knows that the man is essentially doing him a favour by letting him brew his animagi potion in the school lab after hours. Professor Snape had offered to let him use his private lab to brew the potion if he needed, but he’s already started it now and it’s at a very delicate part of the brewing process at the moment, where it needs to sit under a Stasis and simmer at exactly the right temperature. Harry doesn’t want to risk ruining it by moving it from one lab to another.
”I’m tired”, Harry lies. ”I’m going to go to bed…”
”Don’t you agree?” she demands, her eyes flashing with excitement.
Even the teachers find ways of showing their support, even though none of them can say anything to Harry out right, due to Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but Professor Sprout rewards Slytherin twenty points when Harry passes her a watering can during a Herbology lesson, Professor Flitwick sneaks a box of squeaking sugar mice into his hand at the end of Charms and says, ”Shhh!” with a beaming grin and scurries off, and Professor Trelawny breaks down crying at the end of Divination, announcing dramatically to the whole class that Harry won’t suffer an early death after all, but live to a ripe old age, become Minster for Magic and have twelve children. The students blink at her in shock and exchange bemused looks, while Umbridge slams her clipboard under her arm and stomps out of the classroom.
Harry finds himself holding his breath as he watches Ron bow low in front of the massive beast that just keeps staring haughtily at him. But then, to his immense relief, the Hippogriff bends its’ front knees and bows back!

Harry stares at him.
”Sirius”, Lupin says sharply, almost overpowering the whispered
”What…?” Harry says breathlessly. ”Wh-what did it say…?”
”Do either of you know what house you might be sorted into?” Hermione continues, unperturbed. ”I’ve been asking around and I do hope I’m in Gryffindor, it seems the best, I mean Dumbledore himself was a Gryffindor after all — But I suppose Ravenclaw would be all right, as well… Anyway, we should continue looking for Neville’s toad… And you two had better get into your robes, I expect we’ll be arriving soon!”
”I can dress myself”, he says.
”But just to be clear”, Draco adds in a husky undertone once they both come up for air again. ”It’s the perfect size and so’s the rest of you.”
”Don’t fight”, Harry mumbles half-heartedly, staring up at the birds and thinking…
”Wormtail had made a blunder, a big one and You-Know-Who was furious with him, but at the start of the dream he got a message by owl telling him that the problem had been taken care of and that someone’s dead… so he wasn’t going to feed Wormtail to his snake, after all… he’s going to feed me to it instead… then he tortured Wormtail with the Cruciatus curse and that’s when I woke up — ehm — and my scar was hurting… as well…” Harry finishes lamely. ”I wrote my dads and told them, they said to tell you… but I… I didn’t really want to bother you with it, Sir, so we went to Professor Snape instead, but he just took me to see you… and here I am.”
”Precisely. It simply wouldn’t be safe for you here… As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is already talking about closing the school entirely, after what happened to that poor girl…”
”SHUT IT—!” someone shrieks.
Ever since the disasterous lesson with the pixies, Lockhart has not brought any more living creatures to class. Instead he has taken to reading passages from his books out loud to them and sometimes re-enacting the more dramatic parts and, to Harry’s immense chagrin, he almost always asks Harry to assist him. So far, Harry has played the part of a yeti suffering from a head-cold and a vampire who, after Lockhart had dealt with him, had been unable to eat anything besides lettuce.
than alright, and Potter will see that too — from like
”Moony…”
”You have one in your house?” Pansy asks curiously. ”Why?”
”Fine,
”Muggle term for homosexual”, Sirius says, smile softening.
, fighting the Dark Arts…”
”What do you mean?” Harry says in alarm.
As he and Pansy waits for the First Years to scramble about and trip and stumble down the length of the table, Draco leans down and whispers in Harry’s ear, ”I’ll just be a moment… try not to fall asleep?”
Without thinking about it, Harry opens his mouth and swipes his tongue around it when Draco eagerly thrusts his hips forward.
”I didn’t want to… worry you”, Harry mutters.
”Don’t call him that”, Harry mumbles, his voice muffled against the other boy’s neck. ”I think that girl has got some Veela in her, he probably didn’t know what he was doing…”
”Well, I had a dream about You-Know-Who and Wormtail was there — er — d’you know who Wormtail—?”
”Remember? The Hat was debating whether to put me in Gryffindor or Slytherin?”
”All right, get in the boats now”, Hagrid instructs. ”No more than four to a boat!”
! Not to mention extremely dangerous
Harry flits his eyes up to meet the other boy’s. He’s got that grim look of determination on his face again and for a split-second, Harry feels choked up from the sheer volume of emotion that wells up inside of him and can’t get his voice past the sudden lump in his throat, so he simply nods instead.
”Which of you can tell me how to distinguish between a werewolf and a true wolf?” Snape asks.
”But it’s safe—”
It’s as if the course of Dreamless Sleep has created a solid foundation of calmness in him that somehow spills into the nights when he doesn’t take any potion… and last night, the oddest thing happened. He’d been dreaming about the graveyard as usual, but before the Death Eaters even showed up the dream shifted and he found himself indoors suddenly…
”For the last time”, Draco says with a frustrated sigh. ”It’s not like that… It’s
”Did you examine the wand?” Remus insists.
”That’s enough! This boy needs rest! Everybody out! OUT!”
”Thank you”, Draco says hurriedly, accepting the bowl.
Halfway through his second week at Creirwyn’s Hollow, things are finally starting to become less tense. Yesterday, Sirius even asked him if he wanted to play Quidditch and Harry haven’t felt as happy as he did then for a really long time. It was like he had his godfather back.
”Well…” Granger says slowly. ”Harry… please hear me out, before you say anything… but I thought you might want to tell your side of the story, to the public, let them make their own minds up?”
”If you say so, Miss Greengrass”, Remus replies kindly.
The blonde growls softly and bites down on his lower lip, then swiftly soothes the bite again with a teasing lick that rips an involuntary moan from Harry’s throat. The slender fingers digging into the soft flesh of his buttocks begin to knead them and then Harry feels a couple of them slipping into the crack between them and rubbing gently against the sensitive skin there. Harry’s stomach flips over and his heart begins to pound in earnest.
”Ten points from Slytherin”, Umbridge says decisively then. ”Now, all of you, get to dinner—!”
Parselmouth.
” Remus shouts again. ”
”I’m sorry I missed seeing you play, Harry… If I’d have known it’d be your only year on the team, I’d have tried calling in dead instead of sick”, he adds jokingly.
”Bad”, Draco says later in the Common Room. ”Very bad, Harry!”
”You!” Harry gasps. ”No — Snape —”
”Because you’ll make sure of it—?” Draco sneers.
Harry swings his arm around like Snape did, but before he has a chance to bring it down again, a jet of silver light shoots out of Draco’s wand and hits him hard in his side and he doubles over. His wand slips out of his grip and clatters to the floor, but he quickly manages to grab it again before it rolls away. The
Hagrid shoves him aside with such force that he gets knocked off his feet and fall to the ground and he quickly scrambles to his feet again to see the gamekeeper wrestle the enraged Hippogriff away from Draco who lies curled up on the ground, wailing and… Harry’s ears start ringing and his heart beats a tattoo in his chest… Bleeding… So much blood…
By the time they make their way from the Great Hall to the Common Room after dinner the tension has completely left the other boy’s shoulders and brow, and as soon as they settle down in one of the sofas in front of the fireplace, he drapes his arm around Harry’s shoulders and cuddles close, nudging the side of Harry’s face with his nose.
”Oh, okay…” Harry mumbles.
”Mister Malfoy?”
”Yes, she is”, Harry says with an eye-roll. ”You’re just jealous of her — see, not that different from my Draco!”
”Hi…” they chorus pleasantly enough, but their eyes are guarded as they peer at him over the top of the snowman.
Then, just as suddenly, his feet slams into solid ground again and his index finger that had been magically stuck to the brim of the tea cup, flies loose and he topples over, sprawling on the ground. Squinting in the morning light, he notices Draco has fallen on the ground next to him but the grown-ups have managed to stay on their feet.
”I like the way your mind works, Potter…” Moody says, his horrible grin stretching even wider. ”You’d make a decent Auror…”
”Yes, well, now — Mr Potter”, Mr Ollivander says and pulls out a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. ”Which is your wand arm?”
”Shut the door”, he mumbles.
”Okay… Good night, cub.”
We can go as
”It wouldn’t be a
because you weren’t here”, Remus adds, his gaze darting over to Draco.
”Hey, Harry…” Diggory says again as he reaches them.
He cautiously creeps closer to the white thing and when he’s twenty or so feet away from it there’s no mistaking that it
”Obviously not”, Sirius snaps.
”Get a grip!” he tells himself sternly.
Harry is equal parts excited and nervous about today’s match, because it will be his first since that one game in Second Year and only his second game
Remus nods.
Harry looks up at her. A roaring fills his ears. Darkness is filling his vision, like shadows creeping into the edges of his eyes and slowly swirling into the centre of his vision so they can embrace each other.
Harry nods, not really caring. He imagines he can still hear the wind rushing past his ears…
”Hey, my daddy is better”, he tells him.
”, each sign bellows with bold, capital letters. ”
Despite his stomach growling with hunger, Harry doesn’t think he can deal with everyone’s looks and jibes on top of everything else right now so he decides to skip dinner in the Great Hall. But when he’s halfway to the Common Room, he remembers his daddy showing him the secret entrance to the Hogwarts Kitchens and takes a detour.
”I’m saying I’ve talked to Pansy, like you asked me t—”
, he thinks bitterly, and before he’s even aware of thinking it, he’s making plans to become happy too —
”After”, Draco says curtly and knocks on the door.
”Merlin…” Seamus says heavily. ”D’you reckon we’ll ever have a normal year at Hogwarts?”
Harry rolls his eyes.
Draco seems to hesitate for a moment.
Twisting around again, Harry points his wand directly against the creature’s eyes and shouts, ”INCENDIO!”
”I know”, Harry says emphatically, gratefully diving head-first into the discussion of the latest Quidditch scandal. ”Insane! D’you think Gudgeon will be suspended for the rest of the league?”
”And you said… You said Sirius and I — Well, I mean — My counterpart — Sirius and
”Your handwriting was barely decipherable, it was clearly jotted down in a hurry — during breakfast, judging by the pumpkin juice droplet stains in the margins —”
”You’re absolutely sure that’s the one?” Harry asks anxiously.
”Amazing flying”, he says, smiling. ”You too, Draco. That was a really good score.”
He grips his wand tightly, then closes his eyes and concentrates… not just on the feeling of safety and relief, but also the
”What?” Harry says nonplussed, but allows himself to dragged towards the castle.
”It’s not impossible, but it will require a lot of hard work.”
”Could I not serve it this evening instead, Sir—?” Harry asks hesitantly.
”Him… And a… Death Eater…”
An hour later, as he hobbles out of the classroom leaning heavily on Draco, with spiking pain radiating from both knees and a dull throbbing in his lower back, Harry regrets ever having said such a thing. Moody had insisted on putting him under the Curse four times in a row, until he could throw it off completely, and he’s now feeling the effects in his body as well as his head, which has started throbbing as well.
”Yeah”, Harry mumbles, getting to his feet. ”Let’s get out of here.”
Suddenly stars break through the blanket, twinkling down at him… blinking the sleep from his eyes and squinting up at the dim lights fluttering around above his head, Harry realises they’re not stars at all, they’re butterflies… beautiful, golden butterflies…
— Just a damp patch of pearly phoenix tears where the wound used to be!
”You heard me!” Flint says gruffly. ”Big day tomorrow. Get some rest. Go on, get!”
She cranes her neck and twists her body, so that she can keep him in her crossfire, but she doesn’t move away from her eggs. Harry realises that if he’s going to have a chance, he needs to get her to at least stand up, even if it’s just for a second, just long enough for him to grab the golden egg… But she is too protective of her eggs, so the only way he’s going to be able to lure her away is if he manages to trick her…
Their first Quidditch match of the season — meeting Gryffindor — approaches and Draco, despite promising Harry to leave Ron alone, designs buttons reading
No-one seems to want to, but Ron and Hermione, who both seem determined to make Hagrid’s first lesson a good one, cautiously takes a few steps closer to the fence anyway.
When Sirius gently pulls his arm away from him, Harry’s heart begins to pound in earnest…
”Fine”, Harry mutters, silently adding
Taking a deep breath, Harry finally puts his fork down and leans back in his seat.
”Miss Weasley should go up to the Hospital Wing right away”, Professor Dumbledore says. ”She has been through a terrible ordeal… There will be no punishement. Older and wiser wizards have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort in the past… Some bedrest and perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate? I usually finds that cheers me up!”
”She told you…”
Divination or Care of Magical Creatures?” The man repeats.
, Draco rips into the envelope with trembling hands. Harry swallows a sigh and leaves him to it, bringing his own letter inside. Remus is waiting for them in the kitchen, looking almost as nervous as Draco but sightly more excited.
Huffing out a chuckle, Harry rubs his hand across his forehead and then walks over to the counter to prepare something to eat, but as he eyes the door to the pantry, a staggering lack of energy suddenly grips him and instead he retrieves his cup from the sink again and makes some more coffee, then turns a couple of slices of bread into toast with a simple heating charm and butters them. It’s enough to sustain him until his dads get back and Sirius can make them all supper, he reasons.
”What, no! You can’t!”
Harry is back for his second year at Hogwarts, despite the thieving house-elf Dotty's warnings, but already it looks like those warnings might have been founded on fact...
In a freakish show of conviviality, possibly to celebrate the end of their first week back after the Easter holidays, the Weasley twins decide to launch their third instalment of Project Make-Umbitch’s-Life-A-Living-Hell and turn her entire office into a swamp.
”Of course he does”, Draco mutters. ”Don’t be naive.”
Draco simply nods.
”Can I join?” he asks, not really expecting anything other than a sounding
It turns out they’re not to serve detention with Filch after all, but the caretaker is merely escorting them to Hagrid. Harry’s spirits lift considerably when he hears this. From what he remembers, Hagrid is really cool and he would love to spend the evening with him, rather than scrub Snape’s cauldrons, so if Snape thinks he’s just made detention worse for them, he’s quite mistaken…
, Harry thinks, peering up at the sky and as if his thoughts have somehow triggered it, a light drizzle begins to fall just as he and Sirius reach the station.
” Harry snaps.
It’s not until he becomes aware of wetness at the crook of his neck that Harry’s joy sinks like a boulder in his stomach.
The mass breakout from Azkaban had been a major set-back for Fudge and the Ministry, but an even bigger one for Umbridge, at least on a personal level, judging by her increased desperation to gain full control over Hogwarts in the weeks following the news. But that was nothing compared to the days that follow the croaking incident.
”I’m sorry…” he murmurs. ”I’ve had a lot on my mind.”
”Yeah…” Draco mumbles. ”Then Professor Snape came and — well — they started arguing and then your other dad and Snape got into a bit of a fight…”
They celebrate through most of the night and the combination of the firewhiskey Seamus has once again managed to smuggle into the castle and Pansy’s and Draco’s newfound passion for songwriting, it turns into quite the loud affair. Harry expects Professor Snape to storm in and break up the party at any moment, but he never does.
had just come from. But before he’s managed to comprehend much of anything, a sudden force knocks into his shoulder and he stumbles sideways.
”I will, if you do”, counters Draco and gives Harry a knowing look.
”I know”, Harry says hurriedly. ”But you didn’t have to sink to his level…”
”Many witches and wizards, talented though they may be in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, or at memorising entire textbooks, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future… It is a Gift granted to few… You, girl—!” she says, turning suddenly to Daphne who lets out a tiny squeak of surprise. ”How is your grandfather?”
Dobby returns carrying a massive tray full of steaming hot breakfast foods and Harry’s stomach immediately grumbles. Remus smiles his thanks to the house-elf and grabs the massive mug of chocolate from the tray and sips it carefully while he watches Harry butter a slice of toast.
”You shouldn’t make promises you can’t keep, you know”, Draco mumbles, looking down.
It’s a much more subdued group of Slytherins that trudge up to the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning and Professor Snape’s sharp glare from the staff table is the only thing keeping them all from collapsing into their porridge bowls. As it is, the students try their hardest to keep their backs and faces straight, in some semblance of sobriety.
The door slides open and his dad sticks his grinning head through.
”Such courage… Oh, my dear boy, what a shame, what a loss… Five points to Slytherin!”
at the sight…
Harry pretends to take another sip of coffee.
But as soon as he’s spoken, Dumbledore rises to his feet at the Head Table and hush spreads across the whole hall even before he holds his arms out.
The blush in Draco’s face grows stronger at that, but there’s a definite glimmer of relief in his eyes as well, Harry sees and smiles happily. He reaches out to grab the other boy’s hand and gives in a squeeze.
”Yep! And tha’s it!” Hagrid says proudly.
Then he remembers Granger’s transformation at the Yule Ball. He hadn’t paid her that much attention at the time, more than noticing that she looked different — better — and had merely chalked it up to a nice dress and a straighter posture, what with her spine not being weighed down by that enormous book bag of hers and making her look like half a pretzel… but now that he thinks about it, he remembers her hair being nice and silky as well, as opposed to the frizzy tangle it usually is…
But the devilish grin on the girl’s face tells Harry that she wasn’t just expecting Blaise to choose Truth, but she was actively hoping he would. The other boy seems to have come to the same realisation, because he sits up a little straighter, a tiny frown appearing in his normally guarded face.
With a muffled growl, Remus shoves his face into the crock of Harry’s neck and inhales deeply. Harry can feel the wetness of his tears smear over his skin and feels a stab of guilt. Finally, Remus lowers him back to the ground, but keeps an hand clamped on his shoulder, even as Sirius steps forward to steal a quick hug as well.
not —
A gentle knock on his bedroom door startles Harry and he drops the book in his haste to hide it.
The blonde’s body is pulled tight like a string, bursting to break beneath the pressure of a bow, his eyes staring determinedly at the parchment in front of him but glittering with unshed tears. Every time Harry looks over and sees them, and the small frown of pain on his brow, and the way his free hand curls tighter and tighter, he feels a stab under his breast bone.
ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE
She gestures for Pansy, Draco and Harry to come together and her many bangles clink merrily from the movement. Harry scowls back at her, but she doesn’t seem to notice. Instead she sashays over to another table.
”I…” Harry croaks, shaking his head.
Harry thinks to himself and cuddles a little closer but careful not to hug his daddy too tightly.
”For me, it was love at first sight”, Remus clarifies, peering over at his husband with a secretive little smile. ”But I didn’t think he felt the same…”
”Yeah, sort of”, Harry says and swallowing round the small lump in his throat he looks down again. ”Not outright, but he’ll take it as one… I just said maybe it’s for the better if we’re not exclusive anyway, so he should take Pansy to the Ball like he wants and I’ll just ask someone else —”
”Wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties? Tut, tut, tut — naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty!”
”But hang on, how did you get out of there?” Blaise demands. ”How did you get away from the graveyard?”
”Dad…” Harry mutters wryly, rolling his eyes.
”I appreciate that, Harry… but how do you think I felt when I walked into your room and found your bed empty? And how do you think I would feel if something would have happened to you?”
There is a loaded pause when Blaise and Pansy simply stare each other down and everyone else in the room waits for something to happen. Blaise licks his lips, clearly weighing his options and then finally relaxes back into the sofa cusions with a smirk and says, ”Yes.”
”Maybe when we get back… we can sneak you into the Prefect’s Bathroom again…” he murmurs suggestively, then leans in slowly to brush a feathery kiss against Harry’s jaw.
”Just received a letter from Draco!” Harry says and beams, unfolding the small piece of parchment and scanning the short message.
”Let me see your hands”, Sirus mutters.
? I didn’t—!” Lucius snaps, then seeing the sock in Dobby’s hands and realising what’s happened he rounds on Harry with a furious snarl. ”You’ve just lost me my servant!”
”Good afternoon, Mr Ollivander”, Remus says politely.
Startled awake as someone shakes his shoulder roughly, Harry sits up in a panic and the Invisibility Cloak that had been hanging from his arm falls to the floor.
”Oh, it’s you again…” she says. ”What do you want this time?”
”Oh, who cares”, Seamus mutters on the other side of Draco. ”He’s probably just here to see Dumble-bore and caught the Hogwarts Express for the free fare…”
”Cancelled”, Harry says shortly and gingerly gets to his feet again.
”Well”, she says, drawing herself up. ”That just goes to show, doesn’t it… you have all been exposed to some
Harry gentle knocks his shoulder against the other boy’s and gives him a small smile, ”I hate apparating too…”
”Yep!” Moody says.
”Yeah… Can you believe we’re going to the Quidditch World Cup tomorrow? It’s going to be so awesome!”
”Wha’re y—? You’re not having sex are you—?”
