Draco sputtered on his next shot, punching his chest to get it to go down.  Pansy giggled evilly—if you could even have an evil giggle.  Pansy certainly had one.  “Ugh, are you trying to kill me?” he asked, after he finally got the drink to settle into his chest.
She smiled, tipping her glass in Pansy’s direction.  “I’d like that, but unfortunately with my job I don’t know where I’m going half the time.  But next time I’m in town and have a few moments to myself I’ll send you an owl.”  She finished her wine, setting it on the surface of the piano.  “But back to Harry, he’s interested.  I can guarantee that.”
Draco had noticed it now.  It was hard not to, with the way Potter was looking at him.  Merlin, it was too much.  He pushed him gently, stepping out of his arms and putting some space between them.  This was all so confusing, and Draco couldn’t take much more of this.  “Just...what do you want with me?”  He asked in a rush, knowing if he didn’t ask this question right now, he might never get the courage to ask it again.
At this point in the teasing, Harry couldn’t wait any longer.  He dipped his tongue in Malfoy’s crevice and lapped down to the stretched ring.  Malfoy hissed above him, chanting “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” uncontrollably.  Harry darted his tongue this way and that, moving all along the ringed muscle holding the plug in place, all the while he brought up a hand to grip the toy and started to push it in and out, fascinated by the movement of watching it disappear further inside.  At this point Malfoy huffed, his voice going shrill.  “Fuck me, please!  You horrible fucking tease!”
“Pansy’s a good friend,” Harry continued to smile—damn him.  Draco was doomed, oh so very doomed.
Gulping, Draco read through the parchment on his desk.  Of course, it was an essay type question test.  He dipped his quill in the ink and didn’t hesitate a moment longer.  He began to write in a rush, barely thinking as the words filled the page.  He was thankful to have at least known the material.  But that should have come as no surprise to him, he was rather book smart.  Locking himself in his room and studying for hours on end had its benefits.  However, given that he was practically a half hour late, he wouldn’t have the time to go into detail in any of his responses.  He’d have to skip right to the point, just to ensure he could complete the whole exam.
“Er, you go on ahead mate.  I’m going to stay back,” he said awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.  Ron simply shrugged in response and shouted
“Hmm, you might have a point there,” he agreed.  He noticed she was taking him out of the drawing room and down the hall.
if he couldn’t move inside Draco soon, he held back.  He wasn’t going to continue unless he knew it was as good for him as it was for Draco.
He ran a hand through his hair, smoothing it in place.  “Perhaps.  It’s sort of complicated though.  With her on the road and travelling so much, she doesn’t have a place of her own.  When she’s in town she Floo’s here from the Burrow and that’s all right, I guess.  I just wanted to give her the option, really.  I wanted to let her know when she’s in London she can just come home, to me.  I want her to be here.  I want her to feel like she can always be here.  If that makes any sense...”
“Potter,” Draco started.  Those green eyes lifted to meet his once more, and Draco knew now was the time.  “Go to dinner with me.  Please.”
Potter walked over to his cup after he finished stringing the garland.  Picking up the cup he took a large swig and moaned in delight.  “Mmm...this is good Malfoy,” he commented, a smile still lingering over his cup.
In order to prolong this, Harry decided to tease him for a while.  If this was to be the one and only time they’d fuck, Harry was going to make sure Malfoy would never forget it.  Harry would gladly ruin him for anyone else.  Smirking, he moved his cock away from Malfoy’s back and replaced it with his lips.  He nipped harshly along his skin, marveling at how the creamy flesh bloomed under his teeth.  Draco gasped, his muscles tightening everywhere Harry placed rough kisses down his back.  He tasted amazing, smelled like sex and sweat and it was all so very intoxicating.  He was inching closer and closer to where he smelled the sweetest and Harry wanted nothing more than to bury himself there.
He made small dabbing motions along his nose, Draco clenching his eyes shut.  After what felt like eternity, Potter slid the cloth further down and grabbed Draco’s chin softly.  The contact of his bare fingers holding Draco still made his stomach flutter.
He pulled his hand out from under Dean’s roughly, then crossed his arms across his chest.  Draco glared.  “What do you want, Thomas?”
Harry shrugged nonchalantly.  “There’s always someone killing me.  Nothing I haven’t dealt with before...”
“Great,” Blaise smiled charmingly back at her in response.  She stuck out her tongue.
Harry shook his head, chuckling.  “You are insane,” he stated.  Then Harry had waved his wand and his favorite mug came sailing to the table.  He took a seat across from Draco and proceeded to pour the tea.  Afterwards, he plucked a peppermint stick out of a jar at the center of the table.  After Seamus and Dean’s baking session, they’d left the peppermint in the middle of the table along with some matching ornaments as some sort of makeshift table centerpiece.  It was oddly charming and no one seemed to complain.
This was an absolute disaster.  Draco had nothing to wear.  He’d gone through his entire wardrobe and rejected it all.  He needed to look good, obviously, but not good enough to look like he’d been trying.  Draco didn’t think he had such a balance in his clothes.  On the one end there were the sweat pants and other various gym clothes, on the other spectrum it was fancy dress robes and Muggle suits Pansy had gifted him.  “Fuck,” he groaned in frustration.  It seemed the only thing that looked even somewhat casual was his actual training uniform.
Draco paused, as he was already making his way out of the room.  He turned to see Harry holding the heart-shaped ornament.  Immediately he flushed.  “Where‘d you get that?” he asked, already sort of expecting the answer.
But as Draco paused to admire a Christmas display at a small toy store, he wondered.  Perhaps there wasn’t something in the water—but rather in the air.  It was Christmastime after all.  Maybe his fellow dormmates were feeling the holiday spirit.  Maybe they wanted to put the past behind them, simply because it was something too painful to think about right now.  Christmas was about being happy and loved.  It had been such a long time for Draco to have felt either of those feelings.  Maybe the same could be said for the rest of the dorm.
“I’m a mess,” groaned Draco, looking at his stomach that was covered in his release.  He needed his wand to clean himself.  His wand that was in his pocket—his trousers too far away.  It was too much of an effort and Draco didn’t trust himself to stand right at this moment.
If Draco were 8 years younger, he’d have jumped at the opportunity.  But now at 20, things were very different.  Draco was afraid if given the chance to get that close, he certainly wouldn’t be hitting Potter—but something else entirely.  He flushed, stepping back to give him some space from Harry.  “No,” he shook his head.
Ok, so maybe he was in trouble.  At least a little bit.
“Mate, you’re over thinking this.”  Dean binned the containers for his dinner and leaned over Seamus and swiped some stray rice from his lip.  “Just knock on his door tomorrow after Ron’s left.  You have nothing to worry about.  He’s going to say yes.”
He turned back around, despite everything.  He knew this wasn’t a good idea, but what the hell.  The alcohol running through his veins made him care even less.  “What?” he asked, arms crossing over his chest.
“Time’s up!”  He bellowed over the class, clapping his hands and all of the parchments on the desks flew into his waiting hands.  Draco bit his lip.  He hadn’t written a conclusion for that last question.  Great.  “Oh and Mr. Malfoy?”  He asked, just as Draco was about to bolt from the classroom.  He tensed, while the rest of the students filed out of the class.
Under that gaze, Draco couldn’t possibly look away even if he tried.  “Oh...um, yes.  It was quite lovely.”  They were talking about the cd, weren’t they?
“Sweet?!” Draco shrieked.  “I am not sweet!”
“I’m sorry!  I didn’t know!”
Dean could sense he was about to leave and quickly said, “Oh just ignore him.  What we really want to say is that we think you two are...well, sweet together.”
“Oh, what a fucking liar,” another voice cut in.  Draco and Pansy quickly turned to see Ginny grinning at them.  Blaise stood next to her, his spoon of pudding paused halfway up to his face.  “Harry’s such a fucking liar.  Merlin, he’s been hot for you since 6th year...”
“No,” Harry gave him a small smile, almost nervous.  “I do sleep here most nights, but my time is sort of split up at both places.  I’m in the process of remodeling, and well...I’d like to show you the house.  If that is ok...”
Hours later and they were stumbling through the Floo back into the dorm.  Draco had fallen gracelessly over Harry and they were giggling, trying to make their way to the couch.  “Merlin, I can’t believe Blaise actually asked her to move in,” Harry laughed, shaking his head.
What was he doing?  Oh yeah.  He remembered.  He fumbled around in his pockets for his wand.  He waved it around the front of the door, trying not to fall over.  Thankfully the door still read his magical signature and opened up for him.  When he finally made his way to the top floor, he stumbled into the living room.  Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan were necking on the couch again, but Draco just shrugged, walking on past.  The sight of them together was nothing new, now.  If he kept around there much longer it’d just make him feel lonely and pathetic.
Holy fucking Godric Gryffindor.
He chuckled, shaking his head.  All Draco could do was stare on in shock, practically on the edge of his seat.  “No, well, not really.  I’m inviting her to come live with me.”
Draco flushed, suddenly taken aback by the praise.  He was at a lost on what to say next and mumbled, “Forgive me, this is not something I normally do.  I think the last time I went on a date was back in 5th year and it was a disaster.”
he bothered trying to save him.  Draco should have been fined like the Death Eater he was—regardless of whether he killed anyone or not.  He was still Marked.
Pansy laughed, pulling Draco along with her.  “Can you believe it?” she asked him as they traveled the last stretch to her flat.  “Christmastime already?”
like for him to be my boyfriend, if he’ll have me.”
“No.”  Draco bit his lip, his mind whirling.  Now or never.  “As my date,” He answered confidently, while inside he was screaming.  He felt his existing blush rise to the tips of his ears.  But even despite that, he wouldn’t back down without an answer.
“You’re late,” growled Professor Calderon, his arms crossed as he watched Draco make his way to his seat.  Caleb Calderon was a frightening old man on the best of days, and Draco avoided looking at him any longer, afraid to set him off even more.  “You have approximately thirty-three more minutes.  Finish what you can,” he threatened.
Draco flushed, as everyone moved their attention to him.  “Pansy, we’ve been through this.  You don’t have to get me anything.  And yes,” he took a sip of his drink.  “Luna’s gift, though unexpected, was very thoughtful.”
Harry stopped, not only from seeing Draco with his eyes clenched shut at the sudden feeling—but Harry was terrified to move and finish before it even really started.  “You ok?” He asked, breathless.  Despite the preparation, Draco was still so impossibly tight and warm.
Draco really hoped she was right.  But somehow, he still couldn’t ignore the lingering sense of doom.  What if Harry didn’t want to be Draco’s first?  Draco couldn’t blame him if that was how he’d really feel.  There’s a lot of pressure there, being someone’s first.
before.  Without thinking, Harry shucked out of the rest of his uniform, kicking his boots off hurriedly and tucking the case files underneath his clothes.  He dipped his thumbs in the waistband of his too tight pants, pulling them down with more effort till his cock finally sprang free.  He was already leaking and he hadn’t even touched himself yet.
“I was just a child that was taught all the wrong things,” Draco frowned, pulling his lip in with his teeth.
Back at the training dorm, he was jogging his way back up to the building when he felt it.
“Ok, maybe I’m exaggerating slightly.  But he is rather girthy like this log,” Seamus snickered.
It smelled of delicious pine, like the woods and the earth.  It made Draco think of one of those colognes Potter used to wear in 6th year.  Draco would always get a whiff of the scent in Potions class, the heat from the cauldrons causing the smell to permeate in Draco’s nose.  It smelled nice--just like this wreath.  “Mmmm, nice...” he smiled, practically nuzzling the wreath.
“What’s wrong with Draco?” Padma frowned over her morning cup of coffee.
“Ugh, don’t get me started on all that.  He’s a terror to live with, the whole lot of them.  They are loud, they are messy, they are carrying on and playing music all hours of the night.  Finnigan and Thomas are always making out on the couch.  They have their own room for fuck’s sake.”
“Well, yeah,” Harry’s grin faltered and he lifted a hand to rub awkwardly at the back of his neck.  “If you want to that is.  If you want to still be enemies or rivals or whatever, I guess you can just forget the whole thing...”  He continued to ramble, his eyes leaving Draco’s to look at the floor.  “I mean, I am a little upset because you seem to be getting on with Dean and Seamus ok.  Even Padma seems to really like you.  But I guess I could understand if you didn’t want to be my friend or whatever...”
.  But before he could dwell too much on that thought, the rag slowly ran across his bottom lip.  Draco hissed instantly.
He took a few deep breaths, attempting to relax.  His erection had subsided somewhat, and he couldn’t really focus on much of anything at all but the tight pressure of Harry inside of him.  “Give me a moment,” he urged.
knocking the man out cold.  He threw in an added
She eventually put the vial on the table between them, and Draco quickly pocketed it before anyone bothered to glance their way.  He wasn’t even sure if he’d be allowed the potion in all honesty.  Aurors had strict guidelines as to what they could consume, and even stricter health checks to make sure no one was abusing.  He’d take the vial though, just to appease Pansy.
“Oh!  Pansy,” Neville grinned, walking over and taking her hand and kissing it softly.  “I was just giving Ginny a demonstration of Luna’s mating ritual dance.  She’s researching on how to repopulate and protect the existing Blibbering Humdinger population.”
“Merlin, you’re sloshed!” Finnigan piped up next to his boyfriend.
He shrugged nervously.  “I’m not sure.  I was going to have breakfast with you then probably go to the gym.  Have you run today?”
“Just a late-night study session,” shrugged Dean, taking a swig of his own coffee.  The prick was using his plain mug.
“So, have you shagged him yet?”
Pansy lifted her hand, silencing him.  “Don’t.  Even though that place has great food and is certainly posh enough, don’t do it.  Do you guys want to be mobbed by the Prophet on your way to dinner?  You’ll have to take him somewhere Muggle, darling.”
“But this is ghastly,” Draco looked around in horror.
“Oh, so it
She rolled her eyes to the ceiling.  “Merlin, you’re fucking hopeless.  Just fucking tell Potter already.  It’s driving me around the twist.”
Potter frowned, concern still across his features.  “All right, I guess.”  He dropped his arm and watched Draco carefully as he backed out of the room and headed for his dorm.  “Have a good night, Malfoy...”
“Would you like that?” Harry suggested, his gaze turning heated.  Then of course, Draco’s mind supplied the images for him and he realized rather quickly that
Unfortunately, Harry’s timing wasn’t on par tonight, or at least so he thought.  Draco had left their shared office several hours prior and told him to not bother sending him a message over the weekend, no matter how dire the situation.  He had plans, and sod their current case.  Harry had rolled his eyes at his back when he’d left, but now that he was up to his elbows in paperwork he was fuming.  Just what sort of plans took precedence over this case?  There was a serial killer on the loose and it was up to them to figure out who his next victim would be!  If only he could find the common connection, but all of the words on his case file were starting to blur together.  It was getting late, he should go home and go to bed—look at everything with fresh eyes in the morning.
Harry had told him to dress comfortably.  Draco had a feeling no matter what he picked to wear, comfortable would be the last thing he’d be feeling.
At last, Harry let go, licking one last time along his entire length.  Draco shuddered and Harry stood up.  Draco’s gaze immediately zeroed in on Harry’s still very prominent erection pressed along the front of his trousers.  He really, desperately, wanted to pull his clothes off and reciprocate.  Harry groaned, pressing the heel of his hand to his length.  “I really want to come,” he mumbled, swaying slightly on his feet.  “It’s getting so late though...”
“Er, right.  Hermione’s cat,” Harry smiled sheepishly.  “He can be a little wild at first, but I’ve taken a liking to him over the years...”
just as a precaution, before even looking back over to Draco.
Immediately they felt something else entirely from this new position, because now Harry’s groin had lined up with Draco’s.  Both of them flushed brilliantly, because how could they not notice how this struggle was affecting both of them.  The joggers concealed nothing, and Draco clenched his eyes shut as he felt Harry’s answering hardness against his own.  Merlin, all he’d need to do would be to buck his hips like so...
Dean groaned, rubbing at his temples.  “We’ve been at this for over two hours.  I’m fucking tired...”
“Just that?” he asked, flushing at the mere idea.
“Good,” Harry grinned, finishing the rest of his tea.  “Well, if you’ve got the time you could join me at the gym.  We could talk more about this there.”
Her eyebrow raised even higher, practically vanishing up into her fringe of bangs.  Draco shook his head, coloring.  “It’s nothing really.  Just some accidental magic.  I think I was just really happy that he said yes.”
“Now come along partner, we have a case to close.”
His grin slowly returned, paired off with a pleasant pinking to his cheeks.  Potter looked good with that blush and Draco realized he wanted to see it happen more and more.  When he finally spoke next, he asked, “As friends?”
“Aurors always wear their proper uniform while on duty at the Ministry.  I’d have the same expectations for my students as well,” he looked pointedly at Draco’s sweatpants and muddy trainers.
Nothing could have prepared Harry for the image he was assaulted with.  Draco Malfoy was situated in such a position where he was hunched over, his wrists tied to ankles on either side, long sinuous legs spread wide and inviting.  His skin traveled for miles, pale milky flesh glowing in the subdued candlelight.  His back muscles clenching from the restrained position of his arms, sweat trailing down his spine and further down.  Jesus Christ.
“And what exactly is your type, Draco?” Harry asked, his voice an octave lower.  He leaned slightly over the table, a lose tendril of black hair falling over his glasses.  Draco resisted the urge to touch.
Potter’s face broke out into a grin, the lights from the Christmas tree making him practically sparkle in the glow.  It wasn’t fair, really—how he could look like
He shut his eyes, his whole body clenching from the feel of Potter touching his back.  His hand was warm, traveling up and down Draco’s spine and driving him completely mental.  Draco needed to get out of there before things got worse.  He was seriously considering another coughing fit to see what Potter would do next.  Would he notice if Draco was faking it?
Frowning, he slumped onto his bed.  “Yeah, I was afraid of that.  But honestly Pansy, the only Muggle places that I’m familiar with are the ones you’ve taken me to.  I’m not sure he’d want to go to some hole in the wall pub or a coffee shop.”
,” he cut in, cheekily.
He mentioned it over dinner on Monday night with Dean and Seamus.  The three of them were working on another potions related assignment and they’d ordered takeout.  Draco dug around in his box of rice with his chopsticks and asked nonchalantly, “Uh, do you guys have any plans for tomorrow morning?”
“Not a bad way to go, if you ask me,” Harry smiled widely.  Draco’s heart pounded, and he swallowed thickly.
.  He couldn’t help it, he gave one more lingering kiss along his length and followed the trail, taking time to lick teasingly along his testicles—then further back.  Draco’s breath immediately hitched, and he lay mostly motionless, except for his legs which seemed to tremble on either side of Harry’s face.  He didn’t waste another moment, and licked a stripe along his entrance.
He jerked his head, looking down at Potter in shock.  He’d called him
“Hmmm,” she quirked her lips, rifling through the clothes.  She was quick, yet efficient.  She’d pushed practically all the clothes off to the side and was considering some designer dress robes, a Muggle suit (that Draco, of course, was not familiar with the designer on that one but according to Pansy it was really nice), and a cashmere jumper.  Her hand paused on the jumper, stroking the fibers.  “Where are you going on your date?  The location may help me decide better...”
“Ron!”  Potter shouted, bolting up and attempting to reign in his friend.
This was a rare occurrence in that not only were the twins awake, but so were Dean and Seamus.  The boys had some sort of end of term test they were preparing for, and Draco was supposed to be helping them study.  Draco’s involvement consisted of staring blankly at the Christmas tree across the room, while he twirled a spoon in his tea.  He was smiling.  He’d been smiling for days.
“Theodore?  As in Theodore Nott?”  Harry asked, completely surprised.
The couple reached her at last, Mr. Zabini taking Mrs. Parkinson’s offered hand and kissing it gently.  “Radiant as always, Mrs. Parkinson,” he greeted her, purely charismatic as only a Zabini could be.
“Hmm,” Dean thought carefully, rubbing the stubble on his chin.  “We’ll set you up with Harry?”
“Oh, nothing.  He’s just in la la land ever since he came back from his date with Harry,” Seamus shrugged, pointing at something in their textbook.  Dean leaned over to get a closer look and wrote a note down on his parchment.
“Oh, you did?!”  she squealed in delight.
His voice accomplished the desired effect.  Draco needed to leave now.  “Yeah, sure,” he practically squeaked, starting to pick up the pace for the door, even though his legs screamed.
He slunk out of his bedroom, darting his face around the corner to make sure Weasley had truly left.  It seemed to be the case and he breathed deeply, willing his heart rate to calm.  Palms sweating, he rubbed them upon his pants nervously before he made his way to Potter’s door.  He knocked once, twice, was about to do it a third time when Harry yanked the door open.
“That’s different,” he groaned, rubbing at his temples.  “You didn’t see how they all acted when I stepped foot in that dorm.  It was chaos, Pansy, utter chaos.  Weasel was as red as his hair and up in my face.  If Thomas weren’t there to hold him back, I would have been beaten to a pulp.”
Draco Malfoy lived on the top floor of the Auror trainee dormitory.  The building itself was close in size to the manor, and each floor was arranged based on your rank in the program.  The lower levels were for the highest ranked officials, actual Aurors that preferred the dormitory, or any official involved in the training process.  As you moved up the floors, ranks diminished, till you reached the top to the rookies and recruits.
He didn’t start running till his last year at Hogwarts.  With the war pressing in all around him, Draco had felt trapped.  He knew his time was short, that sooner or later he’d be called upon once more.  He dreaded thinking about the manor, what that monster was doing within his home.  Home was supposed to be a welcoming and safe feeling, but then war happened and it was anything but.
He gave her an owl treat before she turned around and flew out into the night sky.  Draco shivered, shutting the window before he turned to his wardrobe.  He pulled out a nice suit with matching trousers, and made his way into the bathroom.  In the mirror, Draco realized he looked terrible.  He still had dry blood caking the edge of his lips and nose, and his hair was mussed from rolling around in the snow earlier.  There was no other option, he got in the shower and wiped it all away.  Even though he felt like a complete disaster and nothing made sense anymore, he at least needed to make himself look put together for Pansy.
“I mean, she’s not wrong Draco...”  Blaise cut in.
“I know,” Harry smiled encouragingly.  “I guess what I’m trying to say in all this, Draco, is that I’m wanting there to be more.  I’d like a repeat of the other night, and preferably many more nights just like it.  If you weren’t that important to me, I wouldn’t even bother with telling Ron—especially given I know he‘s not going to react in the best of ways.  But I think it’ll be worth it.  I want you, Draco.  I think I’ve wanted you for quite a while, and I just had no idea.”
Draco flushed, licking his fingers clean from the cookie crumbs.  “So, I’m going to get one?”
Draco gaped at her; Blaise grinned widely.  “Merlin, I love it when you threaten my friends.”  He wrapped an arm around her and nodded at Draco.  “We’re going to go find one of those famous flaming Christmas puddings.  Do you want us to go get you a serving, Draco?”
Ack, I fell behind!  That's what I get for getting lost reading a really good fic!  I'm going to keep at it though, try and catch up on the weekend!  <3
She shrugged, pursing her lips in concentration.  “He pulled you out of that fire, I’d say that was pretty nice of him...he testified for you and your mother in court.  Another thing, I’d say, that’s pretty nice.”
The enchanted candles surrounding the Christmas tree flickered off as Draco’s door snicked shut.
Harry responded with a matching grin.  “Sounds perfect.”
Ok, my brain just wanted to write FUCK a million times in this chapter.  I think I'm going to change the rating on this story LOL.  Woot, two chapters in a day, now I'm only a day behind again.  Let's do this!
“...And he said he wanted to be friends,” Draco finished lamely.
Whatever the reason, Draco was truly helpless in this situation.  He’d just finished a grueling week of training, avoiding the general public at all costs, and hiding away in his dormitory.  But now here he was, drinking a gin and tonic in a dark corner of some hole in the wall place that’d Draco had never heard of, while Pansy came sauntering over, carrying her own glass of wine.
Looking down at Draco with eyes blown wide, Harry searched his face intently.  “What would you like?” He asked, his voice cracking.
“What?” Draco responded.  This couldn’t be happening.  What the hell was Thomas playing at?
Dean fiddled with the kettle, while Draco continued to guide Seamus on what to do next.  He was busy pointing something out in his textbook, that he completely missed the silent exchange from Dean and Seamus.  They each nodded, Dean pointing at the mugs in the cabinet with raised eyebrows.  Seamus was about to respond, when Draco looked at him critically.  “Are you even listening to me?”
He heard Potter drop his gym bag, making a loud sound that echoed in the empty room.  Draco tried not to look at him, and attempted to walk on past.  But of course, it couldn’t be that simple.
Blaise and Pansy wore matching smirks, then she lifted the rest of her glass.  “Cheers to that,” she laughed, finishing the rest of her martini.  Blaise finished his pudding instead.
“We can’t skip,” Draco said with a hint of sadness.  He started to slowly pull himself up and brushed his clothes off.  “Maybe I can see you later and we can talk more.  Didn’t get to talk much while we were here,” he added cheekily.
“I don’t need a Puddlemere United player either, but it’s something I want.”  She winked, finishing off her drink.  She started to stand, and Draco quickly rushed to finish his drink as well and begin to put his coat on.  “Let’s go dear, I’ll tell you about it on the way home.”
“Oh, um, it was a CD.  Harry’s heard it.”  His eyes met Harry’s across the top edge of his glass.  Harry grinned.  Even though it was such a simple gesture, Draco could never really get over Harry and the
“I wasn’t flirting!” she screeched back.  Draco couldn’t find a better moment than now.  He quickly left for his run while they were too distracted arguing with each other.
“No, he just died and came back.  Just a simple trick like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, really,” her eyes shined as she looked over at Draco.  He rolled his eyes right back at her and was about to respond when Blaise finally reappeared.
“Oh, um, there’s a story to all that.”  He laughed nervously, then reached over and pulled out a stray twig of holly from her bob.
Robard’s would have both their necks if they didn’t crack this case and soon.  He’d expected them to work on it over the weekend.  It seemed as if Malfoy just assumed Harry would be the one to do all the work, goody-too-shoes Gryffindor that he was and all.  He could feel his temper rise as he stared down at the file across the room.  Just who did Malfoy think he was?  What was so fucking important to just bugger off for the weekend without any sort of explanation?  Harry had a life too—a lonely house to get home to, leftover curry and a lazy wank in front of the telly.
He shook his head, his messy hair falling into his face.  Smiling cheekily, he replied, “It wasn’t my intent, but I’m pleased you’ve noticed regardless.”
She rolled her eyes dramatically.  “No, we have to go shopping for the rest.  I know being a wizard, there’s no need to own a single pair of jeans.  But I think now is the time, come along now.”  She pulled him up by the hand, determination in her eyes.
“If he’s as good with his hands as he is with his lips, I think I’ll let him shag me next time,” she winked.
“What’s
“Oh yeah, much hotter than that,” Seamus smiled, cheeks blushing and eyes burning.
“All right, fine,” she crossed her arms in irritation.  “Let me just help you, I have this handy potion that’ll make it easier for you to sleep.  It’ll help with those dark circles too.”  Uncrossing her arms, she started to rifle through her over sized leather bag.  Apparently, it was made by some fancy Muggle designer Draco had never heard of, but then again, he still had a lot to learn concerning Muggles.
“Ahh, sorry,” Potter mumbled.  He was so close Draco could feel his breath hitting his cheeks as he exhaled.  Curiously, Draco finally opened his eyes.  He was lost, staring at Potter merely inches away from him.  He had a deep frown on his face, his eyes focused entirely on Malfoy’s lips.  That fluttering feeling rose up into his chest.  “Merlin, this looks terrible.  Let me see if this will help...if it doesn’t we might have to take you to the onsite healer...”
“Call me Harry,” he said in response, looking up at Draco.  The bloody git winked.
“Are you sure you didn’t sort Slytherin?” Draco asked Ginny, having no choice but to follow behind them.
Before he could get another guess in, Pansy couldn’t handle much more of this.  She interrupted, “Oh it’s Weasley and Longbottom!  Can you believe it?”  She was giggling now, her face lighting up.
She raised her eyebrow, waiting.  Dean, the nosy bint, cut in.  “Yeah, Draco sprouted Christmas ornaments.”
Laughing, Harry came over and helped him up off the couch.  He pulled him close, Harry wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist.  “I was sort of thinking...of just a quiet night at home.  If that’s all right with you...”
Harry smiled against a now purpling mark forming underneath Malfoy’s jawline.  He figured now would be the time, and he gently pulled the blindfold off.  Malfoy blinked dazedly at him, almost as if he was just now waking up from a dream. Harry figured he was coming down from the high of the mind blowing sex and it’d be a minute before he came to.
if it’s something embarrassing.  But Draco, that’s not even that bad as you are making it out to be.  Listen, you’ll be fine.  Just go to him and tell him the truth.  There’s no way he’d even react in a negative way to it.  But if on the off chance he does, Seamus and I will break down his door and beat the ever-loving crap out of him.”
“I hate to break this to you Potter, but so are we.”  He said teasingly.  Harry rolled his eyes, taking his first sip of wine.
“Hey, Draco, you in there?”  He recognized the voice as Dean Thomas.  Draco quirked his brow in confusion, before he pulled the door open.
“Mate,” he sighed.  “Let us help you, please.”  Draco blinked in surprise.  It’d been so long since anyone had called him
“Oh, all right,” he laughed.  In Pansy’s dining room, over wine and prosciutto, they talked about another dinner.  It was a plan that seemed more promising than the last.  Draco was confident he could follow through with this one though.
You would think knowing he’d not be interrupted with Potter tomorrow would make Draco feel considerably better.  It did absolutely nothing to calm his racing heart.
“No, Merlin,” then Harry’s face began to darken, as he took a shaky breath.  Draco’s eyes lifted curiously.  “You look...fuck, you look
Gasping, Harry grabbed Draco roughly by his shirt and led him out of the drawing room.  They made it up the stairs before Harry had to stop and pin him against the wall.  He devoured Draco’s mouth in a kiss that left him breathless and almost unable to stand.  “I’ll show you something, Malfoy,” he smirked, practically holding Draco up.  His other hand fumbled with the nearby door, and he managed to open it while distracting Draco with kisses along his neck.  Then they were stumbling into the room and Harry waved his hand casually to shut the door behind them.
There was a card propped on his desk in the corner.  He went over and picked it up.  On the front cover was a photograph of the front door of a restaurant, snow charmed to magically swirl throughout.  He found the sharp contrast of the stained wood paneling and the pure white snow to be absolutely beautiful.  It looked like a place Draco would love to see one day, a restaurant he might possibly go to in the near future.  Smiling, he opened the card to read:
Draco waited for the bird to settle before he even attempted to retrieve the letter.  When the owl finally released the envelope, he pushed off Draco and flew up and away into the snowy sky.  So, no reply was needed.  He frowned, looking at the letter and noticed there was nothing written on the outside.  He peeled open the envelope and pulled out the parchment.
fashion.  And she’d certainly know what to wear for a date with Potter.
for Merlin’s sake, and he had held off this long when they started on cupcakes, lemon bars, and cheesecake.  But now there were cookies involved and his resolve was slowly fading.
“That sounds like a fantastic idea,” Blaise agreed, pulling her closer to him as they turned to the nearest corner table.
Surely his mind was still not in the right place.
“Oh, Draco,” she smirked.  She stood up and embraced him for a moment before leaning in to kiss his cheek.  “He’s smitten, darling.  Absolutely smitten.”
“I shouldn’t,” Draco said automatically, though his body thought the idea was rather fantastic.  He recalled the one and only time they sparred here and it was during their first week in the program.  They were instructed on wrestling techniques in case they were ever assaulted without their wand.  Of course, their professor paired them off for a demonstration.  Draco secretly thought it was to witness the sick satisfaction of an Ex-Death Eater get the shit beat out of him by Boy Wonder.
He snorted, flipping over the pages once more.  The Prophet hadn’t the faintest idea, had they?  Draco let his eyes wander listlessly over the advertisements on the following page.  So many businesses urging people to purchase their products for Christmas.  He really needed to take the time to do his own shopping.  His mind was trying to come up with various gifts to give Pansy, when the Floo flared and Harry stumbled out of the fireplace.
Dean shrugged, “Not really.  Probably just fooling around in our room.  Why?”
She smirked, her eyes trailing him up and down.  “It’s been too long, dear.  You look tired.”  Draco tried to reign in the desire to roll his eyes at that one.  She took a delicate sip of her drink and continued, “But I must admit the hard work has paid off.  Your arms and shoulders—just what are those Aurors feeding you?”
He needed some time to himself, to think through just what the fuck had just happened.  He pointed his wand at the door, firmly locking the door and putting up a silencing charm in the process.  He wasn’t sure if Potter would try to get in, but he absolutely couldn’t see him now.  He needed to think, he needed to calm down.  He needed to ignore just how fucking tight his sweatpants were around his groin.
Dusting off his sleeves, he straightened his glasses and looked over at Draco.  “Oh, I told you to dress comfortably.”
He pulled on his Auror issued active wear, which consisted of soft sweatpants and a basic t-shirt with the Ministry of Magic logo.  Slipping on his running trainers, he also grabbed a hooded sweatshirt, and headed out of his room.  The Patil sisters were chattering away at the large kitchen table, but stopped suddenly when they caught sight of Draco.  They didn’t say anything mean or condescending, but Draco didn’t linger enough to give them much of an opportunity.
Swallowing a lump in his throat, Draco said, “Pansy, I think that is a fantastic idea.”
“Merlin.”  Draco was so lost.  Harry hooked his thumbs inside playfully, and Draco squirmed.  “Yes, yes,” he whined, and Potter didn’t waste another second.  He stood up from Draco’s lap and pulled Draco’s trousers and pants down in one swift movement, his cock bobbed as the fabric pulled over him and finally was set free.  Draco’s eyes had been shut this whole time, not trusting himself to look at what was happening.  He was afraid if he’d look, it’d be over before it even started.  But Draco couldn’t stand it anymore, and slowly opened his eyes to look at Harry.
He took a larger pull from his drink before responding, “And you look ravishing as always.”
” Shouted Draco, Edward’s wand flying toward him.  He caught it, then leaped from the couch, running from Edward and trying to keep his distance.  Harry wasted no more time and pointed at Edward, a silent
“So just Harry then?  Harry’s sweet?”  Seamus Finnigan was quite enjoying this whole exchange.  If Draco wasn’t so tipsy he’d have flung his wand at him, trying to wipe that stupid smile off his face.
“Hi,” Draco flushed.
,” Draco grunted.  Harry was much wider than his fingers and Draco felt so full.
Dean leaned over, his hand pressing over Draco’s and halting him from shutting the door in his face.  “Jeez, calm down.  It’s not like that at all,” he laughed, some of his black tendrils of hair falling into his face.  “We meant what we said about the no threesome thing.  Even though it might be kind of hot, I can’t imagine you touching my boyfriend like that.  He’s mine, got it?”
“Oh bugger off, Ron,” he groaned.  Then Draco felt Potter’s hand on his back, warming him instantly.  “You all right?” he practically whispered, his breath hot on Draco’s neck.  Draco repressed a shiver, clutching his lip to stop the bleeding.  He couldn’t really answer with his mouth full of blood, and Potter seemed to realize that because he turned to face him.  “Merlin, let’s get you inside,” he’d suggested as soon as he got a good look at the damage.
“As rivals?”  Harry asked, a frown on his face.  He looked rather confused.
Pansy rolled her eyes and was about to respond when Draco interrupted her.  “Before you even start, no.  Harry and I haven’t shagged.  I’ve seen his cock, but no.  We haven’t gone all the way.  You all happy now?”
Lunch would come and go, and Draco would find himself wiping his brow and leaning against the outside wall of the stables.  Their horses long since fled, when darkness resided upon the grounds.  Draco should have run with them, in all honesty.  He panted, attempting to regulate his breathing once more.  His mind still drifting to Potter, wondering if he had given a statement for all of them, if it was just part of his duty as the Savior.  Or maybe he only bothered with Draco, for whatever reason Draco didn’t know.
Draco grinned, reaching for Harry’s hair where some stray tinsel was still buried within.  He pulled the shiny silver strands out.  “I can’t believe she said yes.  She must be as crazy about him as he is for her.”
Harry’s throat was dry, his palms sweating, and he just knew his pajamas were doing nothing to conceal his current state.  It was his sheer willpower that kept him seated.  He wanted very much to leap onto Draco and strip him out of his posh clothes, but he needed to remain somewhat calm.  He had to give Draco a choice, he didn’t need to rush this.  But somehow the frantic and eager thoughts of his brain spilled out of his lips and before he knew it, he was asking, “Tonight?”  When his words rang back, Harry clenched his eyes shut and winced.  Merlin, Draco would probably think he was an overeager pervert.  But perhaps, to some extent, he was.  He couldn’t stop thinking about Draco and his virginity and Harry getting the chance to—
Ginny shrugged, the sparkly shawl around her shoulders slipping.  “Harry’s my friend, I just want him to be happy.”
A knock at his door pulled him from his thoughts, and Draco’s stomach lurched nervously.  He shook his head, trying to convince himself not to worry.  He hadn’t sent the note to Potter, he hadn’t stripped, and he most certainly wasn’t going to go through with
“I need...” Draco moaned, bending his waist to feel even more.  He was squirming and trying to feel everything.  It just wasn‘t enough.  “More...Harry...I’m ready...”
The prat snickered, moving his hand below to fondle with his testicles.  Draco really tried not to whine, but failed miserably.  Harry’s touch was electric and left his skin tingling everywhere his fingers and tongue left a trail.  “I will.  Impatient, are we?”
The next morning, the sunlight filtered through the drapes of the window which created a reddish orange glow throughout the bedroom.  Draco and Harry were tangled up together underneath the covers, and they wouldn’t have it any other way.  When the light hit Draco’s face, he blinked open his eyes and finally took the time to notice the room.
Draco waved absently, “Oh it was nothing really.  Nothing to worry about, Thomas.”
That night he learned that the proper term of the circular gift Luna gave him was a
Their eyes connected, Draco staring transfixed at Potter.  “No,” he croaked.  His mouth was so full of that coppery taste, the next second completely dry.  He gulped, which then caused him to notice Potter still hadn’t removed his hand from his jaw.  In fact, it was almost as if he was starting to grip his face, pulling him even closer.
He was going to make him say it, wasn’t he?  Draco repressed a shudder as Harry took his time at a sensitive spot along his neck.  “Harry,” he huffed, squirming under his kiss.  “I think I’d like...ahh.”  He couldn’t even finish his own thought, it was simply too distracting.
Harry looked at him in shock, his whole body frozen in place.  Draco’s irritation started to rise and he was so close to just turning around and walking out of there.  But his need to know held him back.  He wanted Potter to say it.  Acknowledge that this thing between them wasn’t some made up fantasy.
With the hand not gripping Malfoy’s cock, Harry waved around wandlessly on Malfoy’s bonds.  The silk slipped free and he wasted no time yanking him to a new position.  He pulled him up to meet his back with Harry’s chest, pressed completely close together.  Harry kept up the pace, never faltering.  But this new position had an added bonus and Harry quickly latched to Malfoy’s neck, marking him up roughly.  His fingers slipped along Malfoy’s erection, his balls drawing so tight.  “Going to come...in that tight little arse of yours...”  Harry moaned near Malfoy’s ear.
“Right, then.”  Finishing her tea, she reached over for the kettle and poured herself another cup.  “So, are the rumors true then?  Our hero, big cock?  Ginevra wouldn’t let me know one way or the other, the wretch.”
“Is it true?”
He nodded.  “Yes.”
Just then, the music stopped playing.  Draco looked up at him in confusion, “What did you do?”
Instead he settled for playing coy.  “Yes well, don’t worry about me Potter.  I’m only interested in your dashing looks.  You practically killed me when you walked out wearing those dress robes, and it’s still taking quite a bit to recover from all that.”
“I think you might have conjured it on accident,” he answered with a knowing smile.  He walked the few steps to where Draco stood and made to reach for his hand.
Draco was ready to hex everyone.  “I hate every single one of you,” he groaned, feeling his face warm.
“Even if it’s something incredibly embarrassing like that?”
“Sure, why not?”  He led Draco directly to the center of the entrance way.  They were now standing directly below the tree from the second floor and in front of the larger one in the main hall.  Music could be heard from the party, and Harry didn’t hesitate another moment.  He placed his hand on Draco’s waist, and pulled him close.  Draco’s breath caught.
“Knowing Blaise, of course,” he responds, nodding to a man across the room.  He came over a minute later with a tray and Draco quickly swiped another flute of champagne regardless.
Before Draco could continue on that train of thought, their waiter came to get their orders in.  Draco ordered the roast, Harry the fish and chips.  They got a bottle of wine for the table as well, and Harry smiled charmingly as Draco questioned what bottles were available and finally settling on a Chardonnay.  “It’d go well with your fish,” he explained to Harry.  “I prefer champagne with fried foods, but maybe this will still be a nice balance for both our dishes.”
“It’s ok, Draco,” Dean reached for his hand and gave it a friendly squeeze.  “Just be honest with him.  He’s used to people lying to him all the time, trying to get his attention.  Just be yourself around him, let him know how you’re feeling.  I can guarantee he’d like you even more for that.”
.  Potter never
“Please what?” Harry kept on peppering Draco’s skin with kisses, moving further down his leg to where it met at his hip.  His fingers were sliding in and out with ease now, and it wasn’t long till the third finger joined the other two.  Harry watched greedily as his fingers disappeared inside, his cock throbbing.  “You are doing so well,” he praised, stretching and pushing his fingers even deeper.
“Hmm, Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner,” Draco guessed.
.  Fuck, forget I said all this ok?”  He asked, sliding his head to the table and covering his face.
“I’ll clean you up,” Harry smiled as his chest heaved.  He waited till he caught his breath and then made to move down Draco once more.
“Hmmm,” Draco swirled the wine around in his glass as he thought.  “Honestly, I think I’ve always known.  Obviously, it wasn’t really apparent till I was much older and started to develop feelings for other people.  But when I started to see I certainly had a type, it all just sort of fell into place naturally.”
“Right, well now that is all out of the way, how about we go sit down for some more of that smashing pudding?  We can even go over a plan to get Malfoy into Harry’s pants,” Ginny smirked.
A beautiful owl swooped down to him, landing on Draco’s shoulder and ruffling his hair with his feathers.  He had never seen this owl before, and he was intrigued, simply because he hadn’t the faintest idea who could be writing him.  The only person who wrote Draco these days just had lunch with him, so it couldn’t have been Pansy.
“Pansy, there’s nothing to tell,” he lied, avoiding her gaze.
“F-fine,” he croaked.  “Think I just need to lay down.  If you’ll excuse me.”  He made to stand, and Potter was instantly on his feet with him.
to him?  He was Draco Malfoy after all.
“I thought you were straight.”
Besides, Draco wouldn’t follow through with it anyway.  He doubted he could keep a straight face halfway through the implementation of said plan, regardless.  Because the plan was none other than for Draco to sit and wait for Harry to come knocking on his door.  Then when he’d walk in, he’d find Draco completely naked.  Apparently just seeing Draco in the buff would urge Harry to take him right then and there.
Harry gaped at him, not really believing at all of what just happened.  Malfoy’s eyes fixed on him, smirking.  He stood in all his glory in front of his Floo and it was at this moment Harry realized Edward wasn’t the only one that was going to be in trouble.  Just one look from Malfoy and Harry was a goner.  As if reading his mind, Malfoy’s smirk widened.
“Hurry up,” moaned Malfoy, his tone of voice drifting from impatient, now far away and lost.   Harry’d never heard him sound like
But Draco laughed and indulged his friends during the party.  Now in the light of the next day, he realized just how stupid it all was.  Potter didn’t like spontaneous nudity.  He liked—well, Draco had no idea, but he was pretty sure it wasn’t that.
“Fuck,” he groaned, laying on his bed, and passed out.
He ran the perimeter of the park in no time, pleased to see the snow hadn’t faltered in any area of the park.  No doubt, in an hour or two the Muggle kids would come flocking to build snowmen.  Draco figured now would probably be wise to get back, before he’d be seen vanishing out of thin air.
The kisses along the inside of his legs were driving Draco insane.  He was going to go mad if Harry didn’t touch him and soon.  At last, his lips started to travel up, and Harry buried his face in the fine hairs below Draco’s stomach.  He felt his erection press into Harry’s throat, rubbing against his stubble and Adam’s apple, and he had to suppress the urge to wiggle forward.  He also wanted to just grab a hold of Harry’s hair and guide him—but would that be rude?  Draco really was struggling with this patience thing, it never was one of his strong suits.
Draco choked on his drink.  Pansy smirked behind her glass.  He quickly recovered, gulping the rest of it down.  “And why would that matter if she’s shagging Blaise now?”
“What do you mean?” Pansy asked, eyebrow rising.  “You’re over thinking things.  Just do what comes natural.”
,” Draco groaned.  “Holy Merlin just fucking do it!”
He couldn’t settle his nerves down for anything.  One glance from Potter and Draco was an absolute wreck.  He didn’t think he had stopped blushing from the moment he had knocked on Harry's door.  Now they were walking close to each other—close enough to touch, actually, but Draco hadn’t the nerve to reach for his hand.  He wasn’t entirely sure if the gesture would be welcome.
“Yes, exactly.  You’re going to drive him absolutely mad,” she winked.  Then they were back in the living room and passing through the Floo.  Dean and Seamus waved at them excitedly as they vanished into thin air.
Pansy hummed thoughtfully, and stood up to join him in front of their reflection.  She straightened his silk tie and dusted off invisible lint from his shoulder.  “Hmm, too bad we’re not single.  I’d have suggested we have a little bit more fun before we joined the party.”
“Nah, we’ve been through this Draco—”
“No, darling.  If I wanted to kill you, I’d have done it already.”  She smirked, taking another shot.  Draco had no choice but to follow her lead, downing another drink as well.
“Are you sure we’re talking about the same Longbottom here?” he asked in disbelief.  He finished his own drink and then reached for one of the shot glasses.
“Never,” Harry groaned.  Draco watched, mesmerized as Harry’s chest rose and fall.  He knew he couldn’t release his hold—it would be just like Harry to take advantage of a moment of weakness.  Draco decided to dig his knee further into Harry’s leg, and Harry hissed under him.  He smirked, applying even more pressure with the pads of his fingers to his thigh.
“Yes?” he asked, eyeing him carefully.
, and it’d rendered him speechless.  He stood there, who knew how long—but it was long enough that Weasley had closed in on him and threw the first punch.
They walked a few blocks, Draco’s hand practically burning a spot through Harry’s shirt.  The longer it lingered, the sweatier it felt.  Draco was just about to pull his hand away and rub it on his jeans when Harry turned to him, his eyes blazing.  He grabbed Draco by the front of his jumper and led him backwards into a dark alley.  Draco felt his back pressed against the brick wall and his breath left him in a rush.
Pansy leered.
“What are you doing?” he asked, trying to mask his disappointment.
, his brain added unhelpfully.  “And you’re right.  These jeans were a recent purchase, with the help of Pansy.”
the git.
“Secretly, I think they find it hot,” Seamus said, his gaze still trained on Draco and Harry.  “Can’t say that I’d blame them on that one...”
“He was HEALING me,” Draco shouted, flushing.
Groaning, he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes.  “No, Pansy.  That’s not it.  It’s just...I’ve never...”
“Figures,” Parvati mumbled, finishing the rest of her coffee.  “Of course, the hottest boys in our year would hook up with each other.  Is anyone straight anymore?”
“Oh, it’s on Potter!”
Immediately they stifled a moan, and Draco was so lost.  Harry somehow recovered from the distraction first, because he was able to successfully grab Draco’s wrists and pin them over his head.  Draco wasn’t even going to fight it anymore, he was exactly where he wanted to be.  “You give?”  This time, Harry had asked, letting out a ragged breath.
“Oh, hey,” Potter grinned.  Harry Potter’s whole face lit up from that smile alone and it left Draco breathless.  He had no right to look that good at 10 in the morning wearing some ratty flannel pajama bottoms and a tank, messy hair even more so given it looked like he’d only just woken up.  Fuck, Draco was doomed.
Dean opened his mouth to respond to that, but shut it promptly when Ron and Harry’s door burst open.  Both men stumbled into the kitchen, and their eyes widened in alarm at seeing everyone else joined in around the small table.  Draco’s eyes finally darted away from the fireplace and zeroed in on Harry.  He was dressed in his typical fitness clothes—some loose-fitting joggers, worn trainers and a t-shirt.  Draco flushed, thinking he looked amazing.
“What?!”  Pansy screeched.  “Isn’t that a little
After the war, Draco tried to maintain as normal a lifestyle as he could.  Sure, they had imprisoned his father and mother had fallen ill.  There were hefty fines the Malfoys had to pay, and whatever items that were not raided by the ministry were then sold to pay for Narcissa’s growing cost of treatment.  As such, the manor had become an empty shell, ostentatious on the outside and completely bare within.  No furniture remained, no portraits, no house elves.  All that was left of the place were Draco’s bittersweet memories.
Before he knew it, he was outside and pleased to see fresh snow across the grounds.  It had been snowing on and off for weeks now, but this was the first snow to have actually accumulated to a few inches.  Secretly, Draco always loved the magical way snow transformed the world around him.  It was breathtakingly beautiful, and made him remember snow angels with his mum and throwing snowballs at Blaise and Pansy.
He didn’t know what compelled him to say what he said next, but the words came out of his mouth anyway.  “Why are you being nice to me all of a sudden, Potter?”  I mean, yes, he was curious about it all.  But a part of him didn’t want to ask, in case things started to revert back to unpleasantness.  He kind of enjoyed these quiet moments between them.
Because of course Dean Thomas had to burst open the door to Potter’s room at just that moment.  Draco’s face felt on fire and automatically he stood up from the bed and ran.
“Merlin, shut up for a minute!” Draco growled.  They all fell silent, frozen in place.  “It was just a blow job!  That’s all it’s ever been.  If you would have just asked Blaise he’d have told you the same thing.  I’ve never actually...”  He faltered, chewing on his bottom lip.  “I’ve never been with anyone like that before.  And since the war it’s not like I’ve had many prospects...”
“It’s
“Oh FUCK,” Malfoy shouted, shooting his release all over Harry’s fingers.  His arse kept on clenching, drawing Harry’s release out in long pulses.  “It’s....it’s you....holy fucking shit,” Malfoy moaned through his orgasm, trembling in Harry’s arms.
“Hey Harry, have you seen my...
, Draco told himself, even though he very much wanted it to happen right here and now.
“Oh, yes,” Harry said, slightly out of breath.  Then he sucked in his bottom lip and bit down.  Draco lost his mind.
Draco took a deep calming breath, then went over to collapse on the couch in front of the Christmas tree.  He felt fucking great, ecstatic.  He couldn’t remember a time he’d ever felt this truly happy.  It was overwhelming actually.  Almost as if he could do anything—and then he felt it.  His magic pulsed from within and left him in a rush.
“Hey Draco,” Blaise leaned in and kissed his cheek.  One of Ginny’s eyebrows raised at the gesture, and Draco decided right then to not kiss his other cheek.  Instead he performed some sort of half-hug and hated himself immediately after it happened.  Blaise laughed it off, then looked at the empty spot next to him.  “Pansy still not down here yet?”
“Because you’re shagging Potter now?” she asked, hopeful.  He shook his head furiously, blushing.  She groaned, “Really?  After everything I said the other night?  Why won’t you tell him?”
“Now enough about that, let me tell you about Neville.  Have you seen him lately, Draco?  The man has grown to be super fit!”
.  Fuck, Draco.  I didn’t even know you owned a pair of jeans—and certainly not ones that fit you like
“With his tongue?” Finnigan asked, grinning widely.
“Thank you,” Draco gulped.
“Er,” Harry scratched the back of his head.  “Not exactly.”  Draco’s face fell and Harry reached for his hand.  “Listen, I’m working on it, ok?  I’ve told him quite a bit already...and he’s warming to the idea.”
wasn’t going to be successful, because Draco wasn’t going to go through with it.  But he did secretly hope perhaps she’d talk him up the next time Potter was with her.  “Not really sure, honestly.  Little early to tell.”
The Floo room of a wizard’s residence is probably the last place you want to do anything even remotely obtrusive.  Without blocking the connection, anyone could walk in on something they weren’t meant to see.  Auror Harry Potter would know, honestly.  He can recall countless moments he’d walked in on a crime scene on a would-be victim now turned suspect.  He’s closed several cases, just from going through the bloody fireplace at just the right moment.  The whole department is in awe over it—well, everyone that is to say except his own partner, Draco Malfoy.  Malfoy just coins it as Potter’s typical dumb luck.  Harry, on the other hand, refers to it as his impeccable timing.
“Mmmm...last chance to back out, Malfoy.”  He mumbled, Draco feeling his stubble rubbing across his stomach and driving him crazy.
“Fuck,” Draco shouted, his back arching off the bed.  “Harry, what are you...” He couldn’t even finish his sentence because Harry was licking him earnestly now.  Tongue swirling, and tentatively brushing against his hole.  And oh, how Draco wanted nothing more.  “Merlin,” he groaned, pressing himself further into Harry.  “Keep going,” he urged.  “Don’t stop, Potter.  I’ll tell you when to stop...”
“Harry!”  Draco shrieked, feeling himself shoot all over Harry’s fingers in a hot rush.  Harry watched Draco’s release, his neck pulled back and veins along his neck popping.  His channel gripped Harry’s cock, the pressure taking a hold of him and pulling out his own orgasm.  He fucked him through his release, Draco screaming and scratching lines along his back.  It wasn’t till Draco was completely filled that Harry slowly started to pull out.
“Yeah, well...it’s nothing,” he tried to shrug it off.  He didn’t want to think any more about it, honestly.  If he just kept his head down and avoided any more confrontation, he could make it out of this program alive.  Ronald Weasley’s opinion of him was much like the rest of the general wizarding public.  It was nice that he could change the minds of a few Gryffindors, but he would never hold his breath on seeing eye to eye with Ron.
At this point, Draco was feeling remarkably better.  He could have even reached for the solution himself and applied the rest to his swollen lips.  But why would he bother when Potter was holding his jaw steady, lost in rubbing the solution over his skin.  Down his nose those fingers trailed, to now focus on the line of his cupid’s bow.  Draco’s eyes never left his face.
“She always was quite the character,” Pansy muttered, shaking her head.  Neville, Ginny, and Harry watched her carefully.  She rolled her eyes, “Oh but honestly, she can’t be all that bad.  She gave Draco an early Christmas present after all.  I haven’t even gotten him anything yet!”
Harry stood immediately, their chests pressed together from the movement.  Draco didn’t step away, instead he shifted his hips purposefully and Harry hissed from the contact.  “Let’s go,” he let out a breathless whisper.  “Bedroom.  Now.”
Either way, the only way for Draco to find out how Harry would feel about it would be to tell him.  Draco inhaled deeply, trying to calm his nerves.  He stood up from his spot at the table and made his way back to his room.  He forced himself to avoid looking at his bed, because even thinking about what happened there made his head spin and his stomach lurch.  Shaking his head, he stared at his wardrobe and began to pick out an outfit for tonight’s date with Harry.
Turning to accept his doom, Draco looked him firmly in the eyes.  “Yes, Professor?”
“Oh...what the hell,” Harry chuckled, then he was leaning over Draco.  Harry wrapped a hand around his neck and pulled him close, pressing his lips against Draco’s.  This kiss was soft and sweet, and ended very quickly.  But Draco could vaguely hear Dean and Seamus cheering them on, which did nothing to help Draco’s blush.
Draco smirked over his wine glass.  “Tall, dark, and handsome.  And very
“Yeah, so,” Harry paused, his blush travelling up his neck.  “I’m going to get out of these stupid robes and put on something else.  Where we going again?”
Draco got up early that morning.  His dream of Potter and Christmas lights was just too distracting, making his head spin and it was almost impossible for him to settle back down.  He attempted to banish the thought of that tempting dream, because that sort of thinking was pure madness.  But it was no use.  He knew what he needed to do to clear his head.
Harry Potter laughed, his whole face lighting up.  His green eyes twinkled, playfully.
She smiled, “Please, you may call me Rose by now.  I’ve known you since you were in nappies.”  Her warm brown eyes traveled over to Miss Weasley.  “I’m pleased to see a Weasley attend our annual Christmas party.  I seem to recall the last time we’ve had a member of the Weasley family in attendance was over a century ago.  It’s a pleasure to meet you, I’m Mrs. Rose Parkinson.  You can find my husband, Cassius, attending to the guests in the banquet hall.  My daughter Pansy, I believe you’ve met before.  She should be downstairs any moment now.”
“Don’t listen to anything out of those two.  They are horrible liars and I’m still absolutely atrocious,” Draco huffed, crossing his arms.  Ok, so maybe he still hadn’t gotten over the fact that they took advantage of his drunken state and got him to admit that Potter was sweet.  Ugh, gross.  Draco didn’t think any such thing.
“Well, we’ll be sure to stay in our room till the coast is clear.  Won’t we, love?”  Seamus looked sharply at Dean.
Then they were kissing, and it held a sense of urgency and heat much like their first kiss in the alley.  Draco groaned, his head spinning and he had to lean back on the couch.  Harry took that as some sort of invitation and the next moment he was climbing onto Draco’s lap, straddling him.  Draco’s breath left him in a rush.  “Fuck, Harry,” he moaned, wrapping an arm around his neck and pulling him that much closer.
Draco jumped, practically tripping into the nearby Christmas tree.  “Fuck Potter, don’t do that!”
to tell him!”
Harry stopped his teasing, and proceeded to finish undressing him.  He kissed, nipped, and caressed each inch of creamy skin revealed to him.  He had been kneeling in front of Draco as he helped him out of his pants, licking along his inner thigh.  Then he began to stand, once Draco was free of all his clothes.  Harry stared at him in wonder, and Draco felt like melting under that gaze.  “Lay on the bed, love,” he whispered, kissing him once more.
The only one not speaking was Draco.  He was just staring at Harry in that same transfixed expression.  Harry blushed brilliantly, and waved at them all to quiet down.  Then, with it silent once more, he approached Draco with that same charming smile.  “Hey,” he said.
Harry noticed what he’d been staring at and he chuckled.  “Sorry.  We are really trying to keep Crookshanks from tearing up all the furniture.”
But now, things were different.
Dean grinned, reaching around him and giving that same half hug that Draco attempted to give Blaise the other night.  Dean’s hug wasn’t awkward in the slightest though, it was simply warm and friendly.  Draco tried to keep the shock from showing upon his face.
“All right, I guess,” he agreed reluctantly.  He really didn’t want to have this talk with Harry, but with how quick things have heated up, he knew he might need to tell him sooner or later.
“Well, we could try,” Draco repeated the words back to him.
“Um...what?”  Draco asked in disbelief.  His ears still ringing.  Surely, he misheard her.
“He wants to go to a restaurant with you,” she continued on, her smile widening.
“Potter stop fucking teasing and get on with it,” Draco huffed in irritation.  “Don’t say you are going to do it and then back out.  If you don’t have your mouth on me in the next minute, I’m going to shove your face down there and do it regardless.”
“He just stood there and let it all happen!”
Sighing, he ran his fingers through a few stray strands of hair that fell to the front of his face.  “It’s fine, honestly,” he tried to shrug it off.  “My schedule is different from each of you.  I have eaten out here just as much as my room,” he lied, looking to the right of her.  He could see her frown out of the corner of his eye.
Reluctantly, he pulled off.  His gaze still looking at the skin further down.  Licking his lips, Harry couldn’t get enough.  He loved how Draco smelled, how he tasted.  He very much wanted to see how he tasted
Gulping, Harry considered for a moment.  The silence seemed to stretch between then, Harry’s hands burning a spot at the waistband of his trousers.  It was driving Draco absolutely mad, and he was regretting even asking the question if this was the result.  But before he could think more on it, Harry shocked him by breaking the silence.  “Well...I wanted to put your cock in my mouth.  But er...if you don’t want to, we don’t have to...”
Pansy smirked, sipping her glass of merlot.  “Honestly Draco.  Have you kept each and every Prophet article?  I thought you were over this by now...”
“Yeah, just as much as Potter.  Which means not at all.”  She slid her empty wine glass across the bar.  “Darling, can I get a few shots now?  My mouth is dry from all that wine.”
Draco’s eyes quickly darted away from Potter’s lips on his cup to look down at his own mug in his hands.  He took a sip of his own, just to soothe his nerves.  “Right well,” he mumbled.  “Got to get back to my assignments...”  He avoided looking at the other man, turned around and ran.  He knew he was making it even more awkward, but he didn’t care at this point.  He couldn’t take another second of this—whatever it was.
“You sound like a big cock is the only thing that’d make me happy,” he groaned, resting his head on the kitchen table.
It was evening and Draco found himself lounging on an antique settee in Blaise Zabini’s suite.  The Weird Sisters holiday album was playing downstairs, and they could hear it all the way up here on the second level.  Pansy sat next to him, wearing a skintight pencil skirt and bright vermilion lipstick.  She was pointing her wand at her nails, going through various designs.  Every time she’d always go through the whole spectrum of colors only for her to settle with black in the end.
is something I didn’t need to know...”
Dean smiled nervously, his eyes warm.  “Well ok, this is rather embarrassing.  But Seamus and I could use your help...”
Draco couldn’t help letting the words slip out.  “And does he know I’m the one you are spending time with?”
“Oh, I’m afraid that’s all Pansy’s doing.”  He flipped open his menu and was glancing at the selections.  “Not that I’m against this pub or any of the others we’ve been to recently.  It’s just, without Pansy, I’d have probably just stayed locked up in my dorm for the remainder of term.”
ok?”  Harry covered his face in his hands, clearly mortified.
“Oh, um sorry,” Harry called sheepishly, having noticed Draco almost immediately.  “I can, er, leave if you want me to...”
Snorting, Harry turned his head to look at the spot Draco had been in moments before.  To his surprise, there was a small red and sparkly thing on the mat.  He blinked, bringing into focus.  It was a tiny sequined heart shaped ornament.  “Hey Draco,” he chuckled, picking up the small heart.
Now here he was, accepted into the training program to the complete astonishment of his peers.  Of course, it was dumb luck that he’d entered into the program at exactly the same time as Potter and his gang of Gryffidors.  Their floor of the dormitory was flooded with them and each of them looked at him in disgust—it was Hogwarts all over again.  The only salvation in all of this was there was an odd number of them, and so he was picked to be the only trainee with his own room.  The rest of the room assignments were pretty typical, Potter with Weasley, the Patil sisters, Thomas and Finnigan.
She shrugged, grabbing a biscuit and taking a nibble.  “No, you don’t.  But it just seemed sort of obvious with how you two were making faces at each other at the party.  You were absolutely besotted, dear.”
“We told you he would,” Seamus sung cheekily.  Draco looked over to see him pull out a sheet of cookies.  Sugar, butter, vanilla, ginger smells wafted over to him.  He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply.  Maybe one cookie wouldn’t hurt, surely?
He shrugged nonchalantly.  “I mean, yeah, at first I was a little suspicious.  But these few months I’ve seen you’re just as invested in this program as the rest of us.  It’d be kind of stupid to pick fights with someone on my own team.  Ron and everyone else may still hate you to some extent, but I think I could be convinced otherwise.”  At that, he turned to look at Draco and
He waved them away, still at a loss for words.  Pansy sauntered over a moment later, while he was still trying to recover from what had just happened.  “Feisty, isn’t she?”  She asked, sipping from a martini glass.  Draco could see the appeal of turning to the harder liquor right now, the champagne wasn’t doing anything to settle his nerves.
“What the fuck are you talking about?”
Draco was on his second glass of champagne, leaning against the grand piano of the hall.  He was alone, because Pansy had decided to be a hag this evening.  He told her she’d looked fine when she walked down the stairs an hour ago.  She was not pleased and turned around and vanished up to her room once more.  He didn’t understand why she was upset or why she needed to bother any longer on her appearance.  Draco was her date after all.  It was not like it was really a date—it's just something they’ve done for years to keep up appearances.
“I thought you were going to suck my cock,” groaned Draco.
.  Merlin, he was so fucked.  He wondered if he’d have enough time to style his hair or perhaps even fix his jeans so there weren’t bloody holes in them.  Why Muggles bought jeans that looked dirty and falling apart was beyond Draco.
Draco barely heard the rest of the conversation, he was certainly too confused or embarrassed to stay around there another moment.  He locked himself in his room, panting as he tried to regain some sort of breathing.  It was as if he hadn’t breathed the whole time he was in Potter’s room, and perhaps that really was the case.
“You’ve never gone all the way,” Harry finished for him.  Draco nodded, blushing even darker.  Harry bit down on his lip hard, the thought alone driving him mad with a sudden rush of lust.  Of course, he wanted Draco.  Now with this new information, and just the idea that he could be Draco’s first just about ruined him.  He crossed his legs awkwardly, hoping Draco wouldn’t notice just how excited he seemed to be from this.  Harry took a calming breath this time, before he asked, “Do you...um...want to...”
“Right,” Ron smiled awkwardly, looking at each of them.  “Well, this has been fun.  I have to head out.  Harry you coming along?”  He nodded to Harry, making his way to the fireplace.  He pinched some Floo and threw it in, the flames turning emerald.
As they left, Draco snorted.  “Love birds?  Really?  Just who exactly do you think she’s referring to?”  He turned his gaze from them to their group—which now only consisted of him and Potter.  “What!  Where’d they go?”
“So, you’re saying, none of these potions are illegal substances?”  Seamus asked in disbelief, flipping through several sheets of parchment.  The three of them had various books, quills and scrolls spread out all over the kitchen table.
“Fuck....”  Harry responded and Draco could have sworn his eyes lingered to the hole on his thigh.  He darted his eyes up, green eyes meeting grey.  “I didn’t know...I thought...”
He felt ridiculous.  Here he was, the night of his date, staring at himself in front of his bedroom mirror.  Pansy had nailed down every detail from the way he should style his hair to the socks and shoes he should wear.  Now he hardly recognized himself and he felt horribly under dressed.  He looked as if he was about to go to the store to pick up some groceries for the week, not go on a
He waited, taking even deeper breaths to calm his heart.  But even when he had settled down, he was strangely pleased to see the wild magic had stayed.  The ornaments and lights twinkled on.
“Hmm, I think Ron and Hermione are still straight as far as I know,” Seamus sniggered, his head bent down and buried back in their book.
“He never did write me,” frowned Draco.
century settee.”
serious,” Draco’s eyes widened, staring at them.  He drank the remaining champagne in his flute and handed it off to a passing waiter.
Draco had imagined their first kiss would be slow, hesitant, sweet even.  It was anything but that.  Harry kissed Draco like he was a man starved, lips and tongue bordering on brutal.  He plunged his tongue deep inside, and Draco answered that with a loud moan and parted his lips further.  Harry’s grip on his jumper tightened, and he’d brought his other hand up to tangle in Draco’s hair and around the back of his head.  He was pulling him in even closer, and Draco was so thankful for the wall at his back.  He didn’t think he could stand very well with this attack of Harry’s lips on his.
someone from Hogwarts?”  Pansy grinned, nodding anxiously.  “Hmmm...”  Draco couldn’t think who else it could be honestly.  Blaise had dated practically their whole year of students, both men and women—whereas Pansy was quite picky with who she went out with.  For Pansy to be smiling like she was now, it had to be someone truly outrageous.
“Malfoy.”  Harry had leaned over him, bringing their lips together in a gentle kiss.  Draco responded eagerly, plunging his tongue inside Harry’s mouth.  Of course, Harry noticed Draco’s flagging arousal.  Even though it felt like he was going to literally
exactly?  Just what are you suggesting?”  He asked, his voice rising in irritation.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned.  Of course, he had class as well.  He’d just simply forgotten about it.  Kind of hard to focus on much of anything at all with this gorgeous blonde under him.  He sighed, releasing his hold along Draco’s wrists and rolled off of him.  He laid on his back on the mat, taking a few longer breaths to calm his racing heart.  Unconsciously he trailed a hand down to the front of his joggers and pressed his palm down on his erection, willing for it to calm down too.  Draco glanced at the movement and bit down on his lips, watching Harry.
Harry took a breather, wiping the back of his hand across his forehead.  He leaned over, hands holding his knees as he panted.  “You want to spar with me?”
“No, you’d rather see Potter starkers am I right?”
Seamus smiled shyly, “Um, can you explain that bit again?”
“Oh, um, nothing,” He frowned, looking at the little screen that displayed the track numbers.  “I think it’s finished actually.”
Draco eyed Potter carefully, all the while the music continued to surround them, jingle bells this time.  The other man was dressed in one of those atrocious sweaters once more, garland wrapped around him like a shawl, and a red Santa hat covered most of his ridiculous mess of hair.  “Yeah you’re festive all right,” he attempted to tease, but the tone had no bite and for some reason he was having a hard time keeping a straight face.
He choked on his drink.  Coughing, he cleared his throat.  Her perfectly penciled eyebrow rose, watching him carefully.  “Why?” he asked, “It’s just, you don’t need one Pansy.”
“Show off,” groaned Draco, secretly admiring the wandless magic.  Harry wasted no time and was working the buttons of Draco’s shirt.  When it finally came free, he moved his lips further down to his chest.  Draco flushed brilliantly.
“I was not!”  He glared across the table, crossing his arms defiantly.
He nodded, biting his lip.  Draco somehow knew all of this—had known this the whole time since coming here.  The rest of his class looked at him in disgust, or in Weasley’s case, pure hatred.  He didn’t want to believe Harry Potter would be different.  He wanted to sort him with the rest of that lot—because it just made his life easier to believe that.  What would that mean if Potter didn’t hate him?  Didn’t want to hurt him?
“Just studying,” Dean answered, while he sat up straighter in his seat.  He’d been sitting in between Seamus and Draco, and he started to drape his arm across both their seats.
Draco’s brain leaped onto that thought.
?  Whatever
“Oh,” Draco said simply.  He bit his lip, wondering what they were going to do now.  He really wasn’t ready for bed just yet, and dare he say it?  He was sort of enjoying Potter’s company.  For once.
Harry chuckled in his ear, pressing them close.  Then they began to dance under the twinkling lights and ornaments.
“You asked Ginny Weasley how big Potter’s cock was?”  He couldn’t believe this woman.  “Why does it even matter to you?  It’s not like he’s seeing you!”
“Gee thanks Pans.”
“Right,” Ginny grinned knowingly, looking between both men.  “Well, that makes me feel a little bit better about all of this then.  Just didn’t want to get too involved with this one if he was just going to leave me for his friend.  Been there, done that.  Not bitter about the Dean thing not working out, just don’t want to get too invested if you know what I mean.”
“Um, you too,” he replied, trying to not sound as awkward as he felt.  Once inside his room, he leaned against his door with his hands tangled in his hair.  Fuck, this whole thing was truly awful.  How could he possibly be friends with Potter?  He couldn’t even act like a normal person around the git!
“This is nice, Draco,” Harry grinned, taking his seat across from him.  “I had no idea you knew about places like this.”
“Draco Malfoy, you are driving me absolutely mad.  Do you know that?”  Draco nodded in response, his voice no longer cooperating.  “I’ve been thinking about this for too long.  If I don’t kiss you in the next minute, I’m going to lose my fucking mind, I swear.”  He pulled Draco close, his green eyes lighting Draco’s whole soul on fire.  “Can I....please...”
“I was wondering if you were free tonight?”  He asked, chewing on his plump lips nervously.  Draco would not let his eyes look there.
“Perfect.”  His smile was truly infectious and Draco could feel the corners of his mouth turning upwards as well.  Then Harry was turning an even deeper shade, and before Draco could ponder much about that Harry waved him goodbye and hastily shut his bedroom door.
“Well, I know you two have already met,” He broke the silence.  “But, Draco, this woman right here has been resisting me every step of the way.  It’s driving me around the twist.  I wanted to take her here to show I’m serious about us.  She seems to think she's just like any other girl I bring home—but this is different.”
Draco’s face warmed, a small smile tugging at his lips.  “Oh.  I guess I can work with that.”
Humming thoughtfully, he tilted his head in consideration.  After a few minutes passed and their meals were finally brought over, Harry answered, “I guess I have a thing for Quidditch players?”  He took a bite of his fish and moaned softly.  “No, not really.  I think I’m more attracted to just certain people.  And well,” he paused, frowning.  “I’ve had to be really careful after the war.  It seems like too many people are only interested in me because I saved everybody, and not well, interested in me for
There’d be no way it could possibly work.
Her answering grin spread wide across her face, infectious.  Draco tried to keep his lips in place, but it was moot.  Just as his lips began to quirk, across the street a building had lit up.  Their gazes shifted from each other to look at the store, now covered in bright green Christmas lights.  It was the first of many lights they’d no doubt see this holiday season.  The words
with his tongue.  “Potter, are you trying to kill me?”  He whimpered.
He slid his hand from Malfoy’s waist to finally grip the other man’s cock.  It was hot to the touch, and so very swollen.  At any other time, Harry would have marveled at the size as well, but his mind was decidedly blank and only focused on the feel of Malfoy’s arse clenching around him completely.  He wasn’t going to last much longer.  He needed to feel all of him...and now.
he would like that.  Just the thought alone of Harry walking around in Pansy’s stilettos was causing his head to spin and heart to stall.
Thankfully, after their first drinks the conversation shifted away from Draco and his poor health.  Pansy’s life had remained mostly unchanged after the war.  The Parkinson’s were fortunate to have remained mostly neutral during Voldemort’s rise to power.  As such, she was able to keep up with her lavish lifestyle of living in large beautiful homes, with more wealth than she knew what to do with.  Draco envied her in that respect, not so much the mansion living and expensive clothes—but simply the security wealth gave a person.  He missed the feeling of being able to travel to wherever he wished, simply because he wanted to go.  He missed the feeling of buying things, just for the sake of having it.  Now if he needed something, he had to consider whether it was something he needed right that moment or if it was something he could wait till his next paycheck.  He was slowly adjusting to his new circumstances, but at times it was still difficult.
“Potter....
.  Draco’s head darted to the Christmas tree, and all of the lights lit up brilliantly.  Bright red ornaments appeared out of nowhere, a strand of matching garland draped itself over the mantelpiece, and a wreath settled above the fireplace.
Pansy scoffed.  “So, I’m not allowed to be just generally curious about it?  You’re my best friend, Draco.  I want to make sure you’re happy.”
Biting his lip nervously, he looked at Draco through his black fringe of hair.  “Er well...I just wanted to surprise everyone.  Y’know...since we’ll be staying here for the holidays.  I thought it would be nice to have a tree.  Get in the festive spirit sort of thing...”
“Fuck you guys,” Draco groaned, covering his face as he felt it heat up.
The plan was not going to work.
“Harry?!  Since when are he and Harry a thing?” Parvati screeched.  Draco winced for a second, merely reacting to her shrill tone, but then the smile returned.  His eyes never leaving the flames from the fireplace.
“Er,” Harry finally looked at the rest of his dormmates.  “I guess the secret is out,” he finished lamely.  Dean laughed while Seamus clapped excitedly next to him.  The girls stared intently, their hands covering their lips in shock.
“Oh,” Draco gripped the banister.  He was still standing on the staircase looking down to Harry.  He made to walk the last step, only to stop when he saw Harry close in their distance.
“And he’s...
Smirking, Draco spread his legs even more.  “Like what you see, Potter?”
He didn’t know how long he ran, he just kept at it till his chest ached.  When the feeling became overwhelming, he crouched low and started panting.  His legs tingled, muscles clenching as he wiped the sweat from his brow.  It was while he was leaned over, hands holding his thighs that he heard the door of the gym open.  Draco lifted his head, and of course, who else would be walking in but Potter?
“You’re an idiot,” Malfoy said simply, rolling his eyes and turning away, not before bumping him playfully with his hip as he passed.  He walked to the other end of the room where his own clothes were laying and started to get dressed.  Harry frowned, watching him cover up.  He wasn’t quite ready to see all that skin disappear underneath his robes.
Blaise Zabini was always so sharp looking, and tonight would be no different.  He wore some expensive designer dress robes that accentuated his broad shoulders and thin waist perfectly.  Draco and Pansy gave him both an appreciative glance.  “Well?” he asked, doing a small turn in front of the gilded mirror.
Harry, who was staring at him reverently and in wonder.  Draco felt his already present blush travel down his neck, his cock twitching under Harry’s gaze.  He sucked in a sharp breath, falling to his knees in front of Draco.  He grabbed Draco’s waist, pulling him to the edge of the couch.  Draco automatically spread his legs which allowed Harry to settle in the space between.  Then Harry hadn’t hesitated another moment and leaned over to kiss Draco’s inner thigh.  Draco jerked in surprise, and Harry chuckled.  “Trust you to look absolutely fucking perfect,” Harry inhaled, “and you smell just as good.”
His face turned concerned, immediately.  But he sat next to him on the neighboring couch and pulled Draco’s hand to his lap.  “What is it?” he asked, worry laced in his voice.
“Is Blaise
“Tell him how mad you are about him!  Tell him you want to fuck him into next week!  Tell him you want to kiss that stupid grin off his face!  Tell him about how much he pisses you off—not from what he does, but what he doesn’t do!  Tell him to stop with this stupid game you’ve been playing since Hogwarts and
“Sit down, Dean!  You can console him later.  Last time I let you get around the table you two made out for 5 minutes straight.  We have to focus, guys...”
Draco wasn’t going to have that.  He made his decision before his thoughts even collected completely.  He stood from the couch, gathering his clothes in his arms.  “Let’s go to my room,” he suggested.  “You can lay on my bed, while I blow your mind by blowing your cock.”
It started out as just the two of them, launching snowballs and chasing each other across the grounds.  Then Potter had overshot his throw and just so happened to hit Parvati Patil square in the chest as she was walking out of the dorm.  She wailed, and then her sister was crouching to the ground and rolling up her own ball to throw at them in retaliation.  Then it was two against two, and Potter and Draco had formed some sort of silent alliance and were playing against the girls.
Blaise and Pansy burst out in raucous laughter at that.  Clutching her stomach, and wiping her eyes, Pansy said once she’d recovered, “Oh honey, you’re a riot.  We must do drinks sometime...”
“Harry...are you trying to kill me here?”
“Wandless, sure,” Harry giggled and proceeded to lick him.
“Harry.  Stop, please.”  Draco shushed him with a finger to his lips.  He let his touch linger and his eyes burned as they connected with Harry’s.  “Yes, Harry.
“I don’t even know!  It’s hard to tell what I like when I haven’t even done anything.”
“What?  No!  He couldn’t possibly be!” Pansy cut in, her voice rising.  “Draco’s been with Teddy, Blaise, and even what’s his name?  Cassius?  Wasn’t he the one you blew in the Quidditch locker room showers?”
The Auror training dormitories loomed in the distance.  The only lights illuminated in the night sky were from a few bedroom windows.  Christmas, it seemed, was still a long way away.
Still, he had to make sure.  “
Entering into a public loo, Draco tried to look at anything but the dirty walls, sinks and toilets.  He shuddered, stepping into the nearest stall and went ahead and flushed himself.  This method of travel always disgusted him, but he had no other choice right now.  On the other side, he had little time to do anything else but run through the Atrium on his way to class.
“Merry Christmas, Malfoy!”  Potter practically shouted after him as Draco slammed his door shut. He leaned against the wall, panting.
“What on earth are you doing?”
Draco chuckled, trying to mask some of his nervousness.  But inside his heart felt like it was going to leap out of his chest, it was beating so fast.  He swallowed, noting Harry’s eyes zeroing in on his throat.  Leaning closer, he moved his lips to Harry’s ear.  “Show me your moves, Potter,” he muttered, before he nibbled playfully at the skin there.
“Certainly, I’ll be right back,” he grinned at both of them and quickly brought over another helping of the dessert.  She winked up at the man, which he returned before he checked on his other tables.
he always seemed to have.  It was a smile like no other, as if it was specifically reserved for Draco, and him alone.
Already lost, hearing Harry call him
He wasn’t left waiting for long.  Potter slowly opened his door and Draco barely refrained from gawking when he got a good look at him.  Because what else would Harry be wearing but impeccable deep emerald dress robes, his hair smoothly styled and lying flat for once.  Then add to the fact he was completely clean shaven, looking posh and elegant and so fucking handsome Draco was left speechless.
But then, gradually Harry started to pull away.  His grip loosened, his tongue slipping out to gently caress Draco’s lips.  His hand in Draco’s hair came around to cup Draco’s cheek, the pad of his thumb sliding softly along the skin there.  He let out a shaky breath, and Draco felt it linger upon his lips.  “Sorry...that was...”
“No, well,” Draco took another sip of wine, to get him to focus on something else besides Harry’s lips.  “You could always wear heels,” he teased.
“Any more people?  Malfoy what are you on about?  He just wanted to kill me.  I fucked his boyfriend after all...”
“You fucking BASTARD!”  Shouted Edward, looming over them all threatening.  “The Auror’s poster boy or not, I should fucking kill you!  You fucked my boyfriend!  It’s our fucking anniversary, you arsehole!”  He seethed, his face now turning a scary shade of reddish purple.
Harry’s smile widened, his eyes sparkling under the Christmas lights.  “They went upstairs just before Pansy and Neville left.  When we, er, were looking at each other.”  His face turned a pretty shade of pink.
“Yes well, Slytherin darling.”  She dug around in her purse and dropped a hefty amount of cash on the table.  “As pleasant as this late lunch was, I think it’s about time to go.  I’m meeting Blaise later for some sort of double date.”
he liked Potter as much as he did.  It was just something that sort of just happened.  Yes, he very much liked him for saving everyone (and particularly for Draco concerning the Room of Hidden Things).  But that certainly wasn’t the only reason Draco liked Harry.  There were countless reasons, but Draco figured it might be too early to express this.  He didn’t want to scare the other man away.  It was merely their first date, after all.
“You look dreadful, darling,” she frowned, taking her seat across from him.
“They’ve been a thing for years and if you haven’t noticed you just haven’t been paying attention all too well,” Dean smirked.  He dipped his quill in the inkwell while both girls gaped at him in astonishment.  “But well, their first date was a couple nights ago.  I’d say it went really well.”
Inside the letter was a round multicolored circle.  Draco recognized it as one of those weird discs Thomas was always playing with, to make the music blare in the common room.  He smiled, twirling the disc on his finger.  He had apologized to Luna shortly after his trial, and though the two have sent occasional messages back and forth, this gift was totally unexpected.  But then again, Luna did things in her own way and Draco appreciated the gesture for what it was.
On his couch, on his knees, his back to Harry.
The focal point of this display was the green plug wedged and glistening in between Malfoy’s buttocks, promising and just waiting for something else to fill in its place.  Harry’s throat went dry, his pants tight, and his breath left him.
That night he used the dorm Floo and went over to Pansy’s for drinks.  He held the card close to him as he whirled into her flat, and when he stumbled on the other side, she noticed it immediately.  “Darling, what is that you’re holding?”
Draco froze, eyes flying open to gaze at the man below him.  Harry proceeded to
“Guys,” Blaise cut in.  Both Draco and Pansy turned to him.  “Thank you for being here tonight.  This is a big night for me.  The reason I’ve spent so long picking out an outfit...”
“Malfoy, hold up,” he vaguely heard Thomas call after him.  Oh no, not this.
He let his eyes linger on Harry for longer, as if to answer his question with his stare.  Then before he knew what he was doing he closed the distance between them, lips pressing firmly against Potter.  Draco heard him gasp in surprise before he started to kiss him back.  Their tongues slipped, and before Harry could pull him in even further, Draco lifted his hand and pressed it to the other man’s chest.  He pushed Harry hard, knocking him down onto the matted floor.
Sighing, Draco said, “And what’s in it for me?”
He laughed.  Draco exclaimed, “Pansy!”
It seemed to be the right thing to say because Potter laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  He licked the grease from his fingers and wiped them on a paper napkin.  “Right, don’t get me started on what you are
“Oh!  I got it!” Giggled Seamus, picking up the fucking
“Tell him
“It’s a game, Jesus,” Potter huffed, and Draco could hear the crunch of snow as he made his way over to where Draco was hunched over.
“Hmm?”  Harry hummed, his lips wasting no moment in finding a spot on the side of his neck.  He was licking and nipping along the skin there and Draco shuddered under him.
“And I’ve wasted all my time analyzing on something that wasn’t even illegal, basically?”  He asked, helplessly.  Dean made to get up and walk around the table, but was forced back into his seat by a swift yank from Draco.
that color of pink on Potter's cheeks.  “Do you want me to stop?”
“Fuck,” Draco groaned, outside the dorm.  He had slurred the wrong Floo address and had to make the embarrassing trek from the Ministry back to the training dormitory.  Now here he was, practically midnight, standing outside in the cold.  The brisk air stung his cheeks, and if he hadn’t drunk all those shots he might have felt even slightly more sober.  But it did nothing, the world still spun around him.  He leaned against the door, his face pressing into the wreath hanging there.
He’s never been nice to me before!  Why start now?”
They sat in silence for a few minutes as they dug into their lemon bars.  About halfway through with his, Draco set his fork down.  “Ugh, Pansy.  It’s not so much the smile.  It’s the fact that it's
“I got back over an hour ago,” he said.  “And besides that’s not what I meant and I think you know it.  I’ll ask you again.  What are we doing?  Was that date just a one-time thing?  Are you wanting something else...or someone else?  You hadn’t written me after my last letter and I’ve barely seen you here.”  Draco frowned, looking at his empty coffee cup.
“Potter!” Draco started, not really knowing what to say to all of this.
Chuckling, Harry moved his face to nip teasingly at Draco’s jawline.  “Draco,” he mumbled along his skin.  “I’d like to try a little of everything.  But I’m fine with doing just this too, if you are nervous or unsure...”
“I don’t know anymore!” He wailed, fingers digging into his beautiful black locks.  Seamus watched him from across the table forlornly.  “Let me make us some coffee or tea or something.  I’m going to pass out soon otherwise...”
Word had travelled fast about the confrontation from last night.  It was the next morning when Draco was slipping on his jacket and practically out the door when he was stopped by Padma Patil.  “We heard what happened, Draco,” she started.
Marching over to her, he gave in and grabbed the plate of cookies.  He looked down to see they were festively decorated with the words HO HO HO.  He shrugged, picking one up and put the corner of it in his mouth.  Instantly the flavors melted on his tongue and he wanted more.  He finished that first cookie rather quickly and was reaching for another when Dean told them, “We’re baking for some Christmas tins we’ll be putting together.  Each of you will get a sampler for Christmas.  I know it’s not the same as a fancy new book or quill, but we wanted to make our presents this year.”
“What the fuck is that?” he asked, staring in horror at the thing.
Draco shushed him with a finger to his lips.  Harry blinked in surprise.  When Draco finally felt like he got his voice under control he said, “Don’t apologize, Harry.  I liked it.  Very much,” he coughed, blushing even darker.  “I’d even suggest we go again, but I’m not sure I would be able to stop...”
“Ugh, piss off,” Draco groaned.
your friend?” she asked in response, eyebrow raising once more.
“It’s just...he’s a
“Merlin, you
Draco simply shook his head, standing up tall and stretching his arms over his head.  “No need, I’m about to leave.”  He finished the rest of his post run stretches then gestured to the whole room, “It’s all yours.”
“All right, yes,” Draco blushed.  “But he’s definitely not that long.”
When they pulled apart from their kiss, Draco knew now was probably the time.  He took a deep breath.  “Harry, there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
All Draco could say was, “Wow.”  He’d never believe he’d see the day where Blaise Zabini, known heartbreaker of Hogwarts, would settle down on just one person.  And especially Ginny Weasley of all people.
“I’m still not entirely sure.  I was considering the Dragon’s Tail but...”
