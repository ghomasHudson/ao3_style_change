I'm not the most experienced guy. I'm not saying I'm a blushing virgin, but I've only kissed a handful of girls and had full on sex with one; Ginny. We fell into each other's arms after the war, bruised and battered. It was a bliss. She was fierce and warm, and very much alive. We made love like mad that summer, but somehow we concluded that we should remain just friends and ended our relationship a few weeks before we all returned to Hogwarts to complete our education and take our NEWT exams. After that, my hero-status got in the way of anyone trying and I was afraid to ask anyone out, afraid that they would say yes for the wrong reasons.
Flint finished his whiskey and put down his glass. "Well, I mut be on my way. Thanks for the drink, Malfoy. When do you want us to pick up the little hooligans tomorrow?"
And so, she did, and Harry made pancakes, changed dipers and read bedtime stories. He kissed Ginny goodbye when she left for a tournament, waited up for her when she came home late after a game, and he thought they were both relatively happy and content with the arrangement and their lives.
They all moved towards the kitchen, Ginny with her nose in the air and a huff, but the rest of them gave Harry a pat on the back or a shove over the head on their way. Harry remained in Hermione's arms, silently crying into her bushy hair. When they finally broke away, he wiped his tears and smiled, "Bloody hormones."
Draco looked a little thoughtful and bit his lip. "You know that this soulmate thing isn't the answer to everything. That we will have our problems, like everyone else has."
"Are you out of your mind?" Harry yelled. "I'm sorry if I'm not up to be paraded around with you to improve your foul reputation after I
When Draco's bottle landed on me everyone booed and shouted. I didn't care. I met him enthusiastically in the middle, where our lips clashed. I fisted my hands in his hair and pulled him closer, deeper, and ignored the catcalls and the shouting of, "Get out of here! Get a room, for Merlin's sake!"
"God, you're beautiful!" Harry heard his voice sound raw and low-pitched. Malfoy opened his eyes wide and after a second's breath Harry had pressed his lips against his.
But Harry had also seen the shy smile on his face, the glint in his eyes, heard the giddiness in his voice when Harry lay in his arms.
"I'm only here to get the paperwork on the Anderson-case." Harry had absolutley no interest in chatting with anyone of the Unspeakables, especially someone as sly as this one.
Harry didn't bother to hide the sly grin that pulled at the corner of his mouth. "That's probably because of my other boy, James. He's the Quidditch-player in the family." His chest swelled with pride. "Al's never seemed interested, though," he added in a different tone.
"I certainly hope so," he sighed. He couldn't affford another court-room disaster. He looked up at the taller man. "It was nice of you to take so much time with me."
"What's that?" Harry stopped on his way in. The room he'd been shown into was vast, decorated with high mirrors ornated in gold and a parquet floor so shiny it looked like you could slip on it if you dared to take a step. Malfoy was standing in the far corner, tampering with some old monstrosity at a table. An open cardboard box stood at his feet and a thin trail of smoke rose from the lit cigarette between his long fingers.
"That was my father's arrangement. She had no more say in the matter than I had. But I couldn't go through with it, I couldn't do it."
I was afraid. I was terrified that my memory of him was false, that, what I've been dreaming about for so long, didn't exist. That nothing could bridge the gap between us. Because, when we finally got together and started something, we were torn apart by something so vile as war, and the few times we encountered during that time, we were on opposite sides.
about, besides being a perfect git all the time at Hogwarts, and, oh... oh... now I remember, he used to be a
"You've heard?" Draco managed to let out through his clenched teeth. He kicked off his shoes and crawled up at the footboard, wrapping his arm around his legs. Potter fumbled after his glasses on the nightstand and sat at the other end of the bed. He was wearing plaid pyjama bottoms and a vivid red T-shirt, and the
"These are the names we will never forget. These are the names of heoes, of casualties of war. They gave what is most precious, their lives, so that we could live in freedom and we try to honor them every day by doing that; living. We also say amongst ourselves that the war was a long time ago, ten years, a decade. That it's time to move on and leave it all behind us. But can we?" He paused and looked out over the mass of witches and wizards.
"Well, we're in London." Harry snatched it back and flipped among the pages. "There's bound to be hundreds of gay bars and clubs. Right?"
"I just thought..." Potter started and looked adorably sheepish. "They shouldn't give you a hard time, the other students, I mean," he babbled on. "Not when the war is over and everything." Potter's gaze wandered, settling on one of the sconces behind Draco's back.
Draco found Harry sitting on a bench in the locker room, still in his Quidditch robes, clutching his worn gloves. All the other players had finished showering and was on their way out, laughing and joking towards the Great Hall.
"I went over to her after I left you that night, and she knew instantly that something devastating had happened. She's smart, that wife of mine." He gave a weak smile. "When I told her I'd met my soulmate and broken with him, she was furiuos. You see, her soulmate was killed in the war and she thought something similar had happened to mine. We'd never spoke about it, and she just assumed, since I didn't want to break our engagement, when all the old reasons for the marriage had vanished."
"Well, I live nearby and I don't cook, so..." Harry smiled. He still felt a little embarrassed about the waitress's remark about Malfoy, even more so as he realized she was right. Malfoy was beautiful.
"Ah, yes, of course, the mysterious potion," Malfoy smirked, then his face turned serious. He let his gaze wander and huffed a sigh. "Look," he said in a clipped tone, "if you were curious, if you just wanted to blow off some steam, it's understandable. But you could have said so, instead of blabbering about how you longed for me, how my hair smelled and my skin felt."
She was sitting in one of the other sofas with Draco at her side, his hand in a firm grip in hers, as if she prevented him from bolting right back up to the dorm again.
"Ha-ha," Draco said and proceeded to throw his belongings back into his bag. He didn't want to face Potter and reveal the flush that threatened to cover his cheeks as well as his ears. "Very funny."
Harry leaned in closer and Malfoy opened his eyes. They were lust-blown and almost black with a silver rim around them. Sweat coated his brow and made his hair damp and darker. He had bit his lip swollen and red, and in the faint light, the Dark Mark on his arm, that normally was faded grey, stood out black against his pale skin. Black and white, that's what it had always been with him. No in-betweens, all or nothing. Fire and ashes, life or death.
The Great Hall at Hogwarts Castle sparkled with hundereds of flickering candles soaring above their heads, creating a festive farewell to the two graduating years in the June twilight. This was their last day at school and tomorrow they all would be on the Hogwarts Express back to London and their life as adults would begin. Harry thought they all felt a little skittish about this, and the fact that it was now more than a year since the war ended made them also feel that anything in the future was possible.
"What baby?" Pansy's question rang shrill and sharp in the quiet room. She got up and wrapped her arms around her slender body. "Potter, what baby?" There was a hint of a sob in her voice.
"Well, boys," Pansy said as she slowly decended the stairs, one step at the time. "It seems that the catastrophe, or whatever it was supposed to be, is forestalled. Nothing's happened, time to go back to your own little cosy tower."
"I'm not sure," Harry rubbed his eyes. "I'm not sure of anything anymore. I had such a clear image of how I wanted things to be, and now, everything has changed. It's like my life is spinning, totally out of my control."
Ginny nodded. Harry could see the determination, that she'd made up her mind. "I love you, Harry," she said. "I'll always do." She stood, bent down and kissed him on the forehead, just shy of his lightning-bolt scar. "I'll love you as I love all my brothers," she added.
Harry groaned and banged his forehead to the table. "Because… because…" His words trailed off. He couldn't say out loud the reason that formed in his head. Because this thing with Malfoy
Harry snorted. Those magnificent creatures weren't exactly what he used to think about when in beed. "Hippogriff's fine."
Harry winced. "Stand still, boy, or go sit on that bench. You're treading all over my newly planted pansies." He sat back on his heels and looked up from where he'd been busy weeding. "I'm perfectly capable of choosing my own activities, and I like it here, working in my garden," Harry said. "I don't need to be dragged out to socialize by my patronising son, thank-you-very-much. People come here if they want to see me."
"If that's what you want to call it," he sniggered. "But why were we forced to watch?" Malfoy scanned the group with a smirk and Harry could hear Justin's stupid giggle again.
"Parkinson is in my Herbology-class." Neville's ears turned a distinct red. "We work together on a Knotgrass-project. Maybe I could ask her?"
"I've got a small position at the Ministry, the Department of Magical Artefacts. It's not much, but it's a start."
"I'm sure there's plenty to drink at the Manor," Harry grunted. "The finest Fire-whiskey and snobbish elf-made wine. Why didn't you stay there?"
In seconds, a tray of cups and a steaming pot was delivered by two house-elves and McGonagall opened her tin of shortbreads and put it on her desk before she transfigured it into a round table.
"That's the first time you ever said my name," Harry said very seriously, as they pulled apart to gasp for air. "I rather like it," he smiled.
When Malfoy let one finger probe the crack between the two globes, Harry clenched up and felt his cock soften. This was it, he was finally going to do it.
"Yes, you do, at least when you play someone decent." Draco felt puzzled. "But why? Why did he want to play chess with you?" He swallowed and admitted. "Granger talked to me in the library today."
"I don't understand." Hermione looked at him with furrowed brow and concern in her eyes, shaking her fuzzy hair. "If you love Ginny, why aren't you with her, then? She's asked about it, you know. She's been wondering, why you never touch her, never want her."
With a heavy heart Harry placed his hand on her waist and tried to work out what pace this song consisted of. Pansy Parkinson's hips rolled seductively under his palm as she pressed herself closer to him. Harry immediately pulled back and gave her a nervous grin. But before any of them could say anything, someone shouted over the dancefloor, "
The swirling gut-wrecking Apparition landed them outside the porch of Malfoy Manor. It was nauseating at the best of times, but now the pull took the better of him. Harry bent over the hydrangeas and heaved out the contents of his stomach. On the other side of the steps he could hear Malfoy doing the same.
"I was going through some old schoolbooks the other day and the draught to this fell out. I felt it might be time to come clean with it, and since Valentine's was coming up…" He quirked a shoulder.
"Oh, piss off, Zabini," Draco snarled. "It's a party, isn't it? You're supposed to drink and have fun at a party, aren't you?"
For a long time nothing happened, but then the door to the infirmary flung open and something small and slim whooshed over Draco's head and landed in Potter's outstreched hand.
"You never asked. Of course, I see them. I decided to contact them right after the trials. Cissa's not been well and she's always been my favourite sister, after all. Not that she had that much of a competition," she chuckled dryly.
Potter allowed him to pull him to his feet. His cheeks were red and his glasses askew. “Yea, I’m fine.”
“Going to sleep,” he muttered before stretching. “Hermione’s in my bed and the other rooms are occupied.”
Potter chuckled in disbelief, “We literally spend everyday together. I talk to you more than I talk to Ron and Hermione. Of course we’re friends, you pratt.”
“Oh, no you don’t,” Draco grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back. “Unlike your friends, I don’t care if your feelings are hurt. You won’t feel better until you talk about this, Potter.” He gave another tug and Potter gave up, slumping against him.
Malfoy cupped his face and tilted it up gently, “Now I’d like to claim you.” He leaned forward slowly, brushing his lips against Harry’s, giving him time to pull away. When he didn’t, Malfoy deepened the kiss, taking his breath and making his heart beat faster. He pulled away long enough to cast a cushioning charm on the floor and helped Harry to the ground. “I wish there was somewhere better to do this, but I don’t want to risk anyone else trying to take you.”
His mother had been right, he was getting himself into trouble, but he didn't want to go back to that vast empty Manor, with all its horrid memories. He had stayed there far too long, hiding there, in a way, in the few rooms that had been his own, never in the rest of the house. He couldn't bring himself to live in the parts of the house that were connected to the Dark Lord and his followers.
Without hesitation, and above all, without any closer examination of his actions, Harry scooped up the potion flask and put the rest of the contents in the far back of the top drawer.
Harry waved his hand and lifted the duvet with a little wandless magic. He didn't want to disturb the sleeping man, he just wanted to look at him. Malfoy lay on his side facing Harry, his hand tucked up under his chin and his legs slightly pulled up. He was dressed in a white t-shirt and pyjama bottoms, that Harry had lent him last night. His feet were naked. Harry couldn't keep his eyes from his feet. They were long and elegant, with slender toes and meticulously cut nails. Harry reached out his hand and dragged his fingers over the ridge and up over the ankle. Then the cotton of the pyjamas got in the way. He wanted to see, he
"You can't tell anyone about this, Blaise," Draco said and put his hand on his friend's shoulder. "Not even Pansy."
"Wow, it's a broom! A real grown-up broom!" Teddy screamed and his hair shifted from bright blue to pink and back again of excitement. "Thank you, Harry. Thank you." He threw his arms around his Godfather.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb." Harry took a step back at the sight of her and made a move towards his own bed.
"It means that I'm not into sex at all, but it's perfectly all right for me to have a romantic relationship. Kissing and cuddling and such."
"I know I'm not much to look at," he muttered. "Pointy chin, pointy nose, sharp canine teeth, too bony and no colouring whatsoever."
Others followed. Luna came over with Zabini's girlfriend Brocklehurst from Ravenclaw, and that seemed to be the point where all students, not only the senior years, swapped tables and sat with whomever they chose at the time. Neville could see on McGonagall's face that she didn't really approve, but if anything were inter-House unity, this was.
"Wow, wow, wow, hold on a sec-" But he was silenced as Harry's mouth covered his and the kiss deepened.
Numb. He felt absolutely nothing. He stared at the parchment in his hand and folded it slowly. Then he straightened his shoulders and looked at the woman in front of him. Her face was creased with concern, but still he felt nothing.
Home, as it was, cold and dark, with all the suffocating memories of Sirius. He had sent a note, asking Malfoy over to... see him, to talk. Harry wasn't at all sure what he wanted to say.
Malfoy leaned back in his chair and fixed Harry with his grey eyes. There was a spark of glittering silver in them. "Maybe I can help. I work as a Curse-breaker occationally, as a kind of special cunsultant. Gringotts hire me when they have trouble with some Dark Art effects. I can give it a try. If you want me to, that is?"
"Who're you?" The little boy, who was sitting at the big table, glared angrily at the tall man who took an insecure step after coming through the flames at the hearth of Harry's kitchen.
"Shut up, Potter, and just dance, will you." He took a steady grip and Harry found himself being led in a dance. Malfoy's hipbone alligned with his and lightly pressed in the right direction. Quite astonishingly his hips decided to cooperate and followed Malfoy's sway. This was too wierd. It was actually so wierd it felt good, almost. Except, wierd.
Harry swayed a little and clutched his rounded belly. "Are you sure you don't want Pomfrey to look at you before you leave?" McGonagall's tone was concerned.
But Harry felt happy, happier than he could ever imagine he'd be. He wrapped his fingers around Draco's neck and pulled him down for a kiss. It was meant to be a soft affectionate one, but like so many times before, it became heated almost instantaneous.
Harry raked his fingers through his hair andd groaned. "Fine, alright, he can go." He slumped down on the couch and sighed. "I'll take him there." The blush reached his face.
Malfoy held his gaze. There was a warmth in his grey eyes that Harry had never seen before, not hard as steel or slate, but soft silvery and deep as the Ocean. "If teaching is what you want, then do it. I'm sure you can afford hiring a tutor and finish your exams." He laughed a little. "Circe, if I'm allowed a second chance, then I'm certain you of all people can have as many as you like." He knocked back his own shot. Harry watched his Adam's apple work on the long slender neck.
The Ravenclaws were the first to arrive. They stood silently pressed together in the frame of the open door for a while, gazing around the unfamiliar common room. Then Lovegood skipped over to one of the sofas, where Millicent Bulstrode sat and started chatting, gesturing vividly with her hands. Millie raised a questioning eyebrow at her but seemed rather amused. Luna looked tiny, almost childlike beside Millicent's bulky frame.
"As far as I know, yeah," Al shrugged, as if the matter was of no great importance. "Have a couple of beers with us, Dad, and try to get past whatever's between the two of you. Scorpius is my best friend, and we like spending time together AND with our fathers. Wouldn't it be great if you could get along by now? It's been... what, forty years since that sodding war?"
He had the feeling that Malfoy liked it when he clamped during orgasm, so he tried doing it and was immediatly rewarded by a ragged gasp. He did it again, and Malfoy started to get loud. He loosened one of his hands and wrapped it around Harry's shaft and started pumping. Harry kept pushing back and clamped once more and Malfoy grazed his teeth over Harry's neck, mumbling something incoherent that Harry couldn't make out, biting and sucking. When he bit, rather hard, at Harry's pulse-point, Harry came and Malfoy followed right behind him.
Harry glanced at Malfoy at his side. He was repeatedly chewing on his lip with a deep frown on his forehead, and his knee bounced. Harry turned back at the grey-haired man behind the desk and the numbness he felt since he woke up at St Mungo's returned. "Why?" he croaked out.
They stepped into the common room to wait for everyone else. Harry was surprised to see Greg waiting patiently by one of the fireplaces. His traditional formal robes straining across his broad shoulders. “You look nice, Greg,” Harry said as they walked over.
As Blaise left, Pansy and Hermione entered the room, drawing gasps from the few remaining students. Pansy had on an emerald green evening gown with a sweetheart neckline. Hermione was wearing a simpler mermaid cut dress in a lovely shade of lavender, her usually bushy curls framing her face delicately. Ron and Greg seemed frozen in place. Harry had to shove them to get them moving.
He leaned forward to lap it up before removing his fingers from Harry’s ass. Harry whined at the loss, not realising that Draco had removed the rest of his clothing. He muttered another spell and rubbed his well lubricated prick against Harry’s ass. “Yes?” he asked through gritted teeth.
He had seen what could happen to someone that presented as omega first hand when Pansy had presented in Herbology. She was the first to present omega. They’d had several alphas already, but most students were betas. She had stood up, telling Professor Sprout that she felt faint and feverish. Before she could leave the greenhouse, her scent had washed over everyone. Harry thought she smelled nice, like someone he wanted to take care of, but apparently she smelled of something else to the alphas. Ron had flown into a rage, fighting three other students before pulling her into a storage shed. Hermione had been worried for Pansy, but she had been more than willing to go with him from what Harry had seen.
They talked about their plans as they finished up breakfast, deciding that Greg and Blaise would join them in the library, leaving Ron and Pansy alone for their Hogsmeade trip. Both had been shopping with her before and would rather study than go again willingly.
“Thanks, guys. You just gave me my big break,” Wilkes said. “I’m sorry I was a jerk earlier.” He waved and headed back in the direction of Hogsmeade.
“I’ve honestly never really thought about it,” Draco shrugged. “My life used to be planned out. Where I went to school, what my job would be, who I would marry. No one ever asked me. And then after everything that happened, I was just so thankful to be alive and not in Azkaban that I didn’t worry about any of it. Now, I can’t even support myself. Let alone a family.” Potter nodded as if he understood, silent as he waited for Draco to continue. Draco took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Right now, I just want to be useful. To feel like I’m needed. I haven’t really thought too far beyond that.”
“You really don’t know anything about your family do you,” Narcissa said softly, placing her hand on Harry’s knee. “Before you go back to school, I want to show you some books in the library. The Potter’s are one of the oldest family’s. We have books on all of the 28. I’m sure there’s something in there.” She squeezed his knee lightly, “Would you like to open the gifts from me now?”
“I notice that Mr. Potter is staying in your room,” she spoke carefully. “Is there anything that you would like to tell me?” Her expression was carefully neutral.
The walk to Hogsmeade was cold, but pleasant. Harry hated to admit that he liked being held so close to Draco, but he was so warm that he felt it was justified. As they walked through Hogsmeade, several people glanced their way before staring in open surprise. “We might not have to tip off the papers, after all,” Draco muttered as he steered Harry towards the Three Broomsticks.
Parkinson, flanked by Zabini and Goyle, stood between the two sofas with their backs to Lavender and Parvati. “Were you planning to tell us we were making nice with the golden trio eventually or did you intend to let us figure it out on our own?” Parkinson said, scowling at Malfoy.
Harry woke the next morning, trying to remember why he had to be awake this early on a Saturday. He had been looking forward to having a lazy day and had even shut his bed hangings to block out the morning sun. So why was Ron knocking around and making so much noise?
“Yea, I know, Mione,” Weasley agreed. I just don’t know what to do about him. I’ve tried talking to him and he told me that I wouldn’t understand because I’ve never had my heart broken.” He shook his head slightly, “And Ginny isn’t helping at all because she keeps asking me if he’s alright. I told her to bugger off.”
“You’re the last omega out. All the others came out with alphas already,” she said quickly. “Some alphas are still in, but they didn’t want to interfere until you were out.”
“You deserve to be celebrated,” Harry hugged her tightly for a moment. “You’re the youngest person to ever be appointed as the head of non-magical relations. Don’t be modest about it.”
The shorts were a bit long, but thankfully had a drawstring so Harry was able to keep them pulled up. The jumper on the other hand was quite large. It hung off of one of Harry’s shoulders and the sleeves were too long, but it was so soft that he couldn’t be bothered to care. He slipped out of the bedroom quietly, not wanting to disturb Malfoy’s reading yet again since he had been nice enough to give him some dry clothing. He was mildly surprised to find that he was in the small kitchenette.
As Blaise scowled at Pansy, Harry tried not to laugh and said, “Listen, I’m not going to hurt him.” He looked over to where Draco was laughing with Ron and Greg. “At this point, I’m worried that he might hurt me,” he added honestly. Hermione reached over and squeezed his knee gently, giving him a soft smile.
Malfoy followed her eyes and grinned, shaking his head. “It was tiresome to keep up the facade. We’re both too busy to keep trying to schedule time together.”
“It’s Draco, darling. Or you can call me an acceptable pet name if you’d like,” he seemed to be thinking about it. “Nothing ridiculous like snookums. That’s just awful.”
“Shh,” Draco spoke softly and held his hands up. “I don’t want to hurt you, Harry. Will you let me use some healing spells?”
“You’re so beautiful, Harry,” Draco groaned as he pushed further. When he was fully inside Harry, he held still for what felt like an eternity to Harry, giving him time to adjust to his size. He finally started moving slowly, flexing his hips to fuck Harry gently. “Does this feel good?” he asked as he watched Harry’s prick grow hard again.
Draco thought of the house elf that watched him as a child. She brought him meals and looked after him when his parents were away. She had been Draco’s only friend for a time, but she had gotten old. He went away to school one year and she was gone when he came home. His father would never tell him what happened to her. “You’re a good person, Potter,” Draco said, and he meant it.
“Yea, I think so,” Ron shrugged. “His curtains were closed and I heard him mumbling a bit last night so I’m guessing he didn’t sleep well.”
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, “I suppose we should just get it over with. They’ve probably started making things up anyways.”
“Do you agree to all of my terms and conditions?” Malfoy pushed, leaning a bit further into Harry’s personal space.
“Everyone that is hunting, please listen carefully. You may use physical or magical means to fight and attempt to catch an omega. You may not cause permanent damage to any omega. You may not cause permanent damage or death to any opposing alpha. If you concede in any fight, you will be removed and you will have to wait until the next hunt to prove yourself. Does anyone have any questions?” He looked around at all of them. “The exit paths are clearly marked. If you become lost, send up yellow sparks and someone will come along to retrieve you. The edges of the hunting grounds are also clearly marked and magical barriers have been erected to ensure that no one is hit with friendly fire. You have two minutes to prepare yourselves.”
“Teddy is my godson,” Potter looked at the slides and smiled as he watched the little boy play. “He’s Remus and Tonks’ little boy. His grandmother is your mother’s sister.”
Draco woke to a rapid knocking on his door. “Yes. I’m up,” he called out, trying to remember why he should be awake so early.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, stepping aside. His voice dripped with sarcasm as he added, “Please, by all means, make yourself comfortable. We’re thrilled to have you.” Harry rolled his eyes as Malfoy sat on the sofa and picked up his coffee. “Not like we were busy,” he mumbled to himself. He looked at Hermione over his cup, “It’s a bit early for a social call, don’t you think?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and flopped onto his side next to Harry. “Sex, Potter,” he chuckled. “The fact that you didn’t know what I meant tells me that you’re not ready.”
Draco decided he wanted to talk to Harry more about that comment later, but at the moment he wanted to break the tension in the room. “Why don’t we head into the dining room and get started on dinner?” He motioned to the doorway and smiled in relief when everyone moved in that direction.
“Do I have to pick one?” Harry grinned up at him. “I didn’t know that I would like having my hair played with,” Harry said softly.
She made neat stacks of gifts in front of them, Harry looking surprised at the size of his pile. “I suppose you’ll want to open this one first,” she said, handing Harry a slightly lumpy package that he recognized immediately. He opened it quickly, pulling a soft maroon sweater with a big yellow H out of the wrapping. He pulled it over his head and smiled. “I suppose you’ll want to open the gifts from each other next?” she asked.
When they reached the main entrance, Hermione was pacing with Pansy and Ron trying to calm her down. When she saw Harry, she tried to run to him, but Pansy grabbed her arm. “Ask Draco before you approach him,” Pansy warned.
“Whatever you want,” Draco answered, moving on top of Harry. “All you have to do is say stop and I’ll stop,” he added as he kissed along Harry’s jaw.
“I don’t want to talk about it right now,” Harry muttered. He still wanted to run from Malfoy, but couldn’t bring himself to. “I’m not sorry for running,” he said, staring defiantly up at Malfoy.
As they reached the pub, they spotted Ron and Pansy headed in their direction. Pansy had her arm looped through Ron’s and was practically dragging him up the street. “You have perfect timing,” she said as they drew closer. “I’m absolutely starving. Usually Blaise makes me take a break, but Ron let me look as much as I wanted. We still have two shops to go through.”
Potter stepped to the hearth and took a handful of floo powder. Picking up Teddy, he turned to Draco, “Feel free to look around a bit. I’ll be right back.” He stepped into the floo, saying an address that Draco didn’t quite hear.
“This is by far the most unromantic proposal I have ever received,” Malfoy scoffed, shaking his head. “What do I get if I agree?”
Ron stared at him like he had grown two heads, gaining another elbow from Hermione. “I did. It took less time than expected even though I added in an extra page on additional uses for erumpent horn,” she grinned, both pleased with herself and amused by Malfoy. “How about you?”
Draco let Harry sit in the corner of the sofa and layed down, stretching out with his head in Harry’s lap. “Weasley didn’t tell you?” he chuckled after getting comfortable.
“Do you know what’s going on with Harry and Draco?” she asked. “I only ask because this all seems so sudden. Don’t get me wrong, it’s really nice. But Draco’s always been kind of a heartless bastard and now he’s… Well, you guys see what he’s like with Harry. It’s a bit unnerving.”
“Yea, but stay where I can see you,” he grinned as he spoke to him. “And be nice to the other kids,” he practically shouted as Teddy ran over to the slides. “I hope the park is alright. Andromeda had an appointment so I have Teddy for the afternoon,” he said as he sat next to Draco.
Harry chuckled, “I thought about it.” He considered stepping away from Malfoy, but he just smelled so damned good. Harry took another deep breath, feeling entirely too content pressed against Malfoy. He wanted to shout at himself to move, but the part of him that wanted to stay was like a stubborn cat and refused to be bothered. “What happens now?”
They spent the remainder of the day eating too many sweets and listening to Narcissa play the piano. “This is so different from any Christmas I’ve ever had,” Harry told Draco as they lay on the rug in front of the hearth, “But it’s also one of the best I've ever had.”
“Not a problem,” Draco easily levitated her and moved her to the path out of view of the little clearing. He took a handkerchief out of his pocket and gagged her for good measure. He returned to Harry and found him using a cushioning charm at the base of a tree.
The first class had been a bit awkward with Draco being paired with Potter, but when he made a joke about Granger not being able to punch him so easily now Potter had actually laughed. It lightened up the atmosphere and the two were able to work well together.
“I lost in fourth year when you didn’t go to the Yule Ball together,” Pansy shrugged. “But I did win on Granger going with Krum so thanks for that.”
Potter grinned up at him as he wrapped his lips around his prick, sucking him in slowly. He teased him for several moments, barely taking him into his mouth before sliding to the base of his shaft, choking slightly when Draco hit the back of his throat. Draco tried to pull away when he choked, but he held onto his hips, keeping him close as he swallowed around his head pulling more groans and cursing from Draco.
Draco shrugged, “Ron already thinks we’re together. I’ve caught him checking my room to see if my stuff is still in there. He’s been suspicious since I moved in.”
“Actually, I can and I did,” Draco shrugged. “You see, darling, I told you I was better at these things. We never agreed that we couldn’t add more conditions to our arrangement. I would have thought you’d be pleased to know that I couldn’t lie to you.”
Draco just rolled his eyes and grinned at Harry. He cupped the back of his neck and pulled him in for a brief kiss, effectively silencing the cackling baboons. “Who’s ready for presents?” Draco asked, grinning at the surprised faces. His mother seemed to be the only one not surprised.
“Fine,” Potter huffed. “But if I have to talk, I’m going to be comfortable.” He surprised Draco by moving closer and laying his head on Draco’s chest. “I hope this isn’t weird, but I could kind of use a hug at the moment.”
Harry felt a tingle of magic flow through him, warming him from deep within his chest. It took him longer than it should have to remember that he was kissing Malfoy and he pulled away quickly. “What did you do that for?” Harry stood and tried to shove past him.
“Neville,” Seamus shook his head. “We all thought it’d be sooner, but he held out for the long game.” He gave them a little wave, “We have to be off. See you later.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe she didn’t tell me. She did say to tell you hello. I guess I’ll be joining you both for Sunday tea.” He walked over to the piano and started siphoning the dust off as he muttered, “I can’t believe he had a standing tea invitation and she didn’t even tell me. She didn’t even invite me.”
As they were about to enter the gates to the school, he called out to them, “I apologize for earlier. Is it alright if I ask you some questions?”
Draco stopped him before he went into his room, pulling him close and kissing his neck. “Don’t forget what happens if you keep me waiting,” he whispered against Harry’s skin. He smiled down at him before going to his own room.
“Juice is fine,” Draco said as he got the plates and glasses. He grabbed the juice and set it on the table as well. Potter grabbed the plates and fixed them both with large helpings of everything he had made. “This smells so amazing.”
“I think you’re both worried over nothing,” Hermione chimed in. “Yes it seems fast, but we’ve all known each other for years now. There’s a very thin line between love and hate. If they’re both happy, leave them be. We’ve all had to grow up entirely too quickly. Let them have this.”
“Calm down, darling,” Draco pulled Harry into a side hug, rubbing his arm. “Things are going exactly as planned.” He kissed Harry’s forehead and heard a camera clicking. “It’s going to be fine.”
“It’s me,” Draco said, slipping quietly through the bed hangings. “I couldn’t sleep. Can I maybe… I mean, is it alright if I stay here?”
“This looks exactly like what I expected,” Harry chuckled while looking at the clean lines of the black furniture with silver and green accents. “A room fit for the Slytherin prince.”
“It’s fine Mione,” Harry smiled as he leaned into Malfoy. “I was getting pretty sick until he found me.” He explained the situation quickly, leaving out the more intimate parts. “If Malfoy hadn’t been so close to me, I don’t know what would have happened.”
“Well, you at least came to the right person because I don’t particularly like you at all,” Malfoy muttered.
By the time they reached the weekend, Harry was tired of studying. Draco insisted that they get their homework in the evenings, after dinner. Harry wanted to protest, but the idea of spending an entire weekend free of schoolwork was tempting so he didn’t argue.
“That might work, but I don’t really know of anyone that doesn’t like me,” Harry sighed, slumping back in his chair.
“I’ve seen him down before,” Granger added, “Like when Sirius died and after the battle, but I’ve always been able to reach him. It’s like we can’t get through.” She sighed and put her head in her hands.
“I won the Slytherin pot,” Blaise grinned. “What?” he scoffed at the face Draco made. “They’re not wrong. The two of you have been obsessed with each other since first year.”
“Darling, do calm down,” Draco spoke quickly, interrupting Harry before he could continue to yell at the reporter. “Listen, Mr. Wilkes,” Draco snarled his nose as if the name tasted bad in his mouth. “If you had approached politely and requested an interview, we would have scheduled a time to oblige, but considering that you were quite rude I believe we’ll be going on our way.” He put his hand on Harry’s back and led him up the street towards Honeydukes.
Draco took a bite of the fluffy eggs and hummed in appreciation. “This is delicious,” he said before eating a piece of crispy bacon. “Have you ever considered inviting friends over so you don’t have leftovers?”
“This is brilliant,” Draco muttered, mostly to himself. “Is it alright if I look around in here more later?”
“No, I don’t,” she agreed. “But I know you. So why exactly are we obsessing about Malfoy this time? Because quite frankly, I have better things to do.”
“Your hair was tickling my nose,” Draco said as he stood up from the bed. “You were the one using me as a pillow, if I decide to pet you I should be allowed,” he laughed.
It was weird because it was Potter, but he already seemed so forlorn that Draco didn’t want to point that out, “It’s fine,” he said instead. He rested his arm around Potter’s back wondering how he had gotten here. “So,” he started after he had thought about what Potter said for a few minutes, “Are you upset about being dumped or about losing the family you thought you were going to have?”
“Just remember that I warned you,” Potter chuckled as he started up the stairs. The second floor had four bedrooms, two of which had two twin beds in each. A third bedroom, with a large four poster bed, looked to at least be clean even though there were clothes scattered about. “This is where I sleep,” he pointed out as Draco poked his head in. The fourth bedroom looked much the same, but had tattered cloth hanging from the bed posts and a thick layer of dust on everything.
“From Harry or from these other so-called alphas?” Draco laughed while Ron shook his head. “I’ll fight every single alpha here as many times as I have to.”
He checked his surroundings to make sure he wouldn’t be ambushed before checking the forked path McLaggen had been sniffing. He could smell Harry in both directions. One strong, the other very faint. He decided the stronger scent was too obvious and headed down the other path. He was walking slowly, checking the other scents in the area as he moved. Ron had been through here at some point, but his scent veered off into the trees. It was hard to track Harry’s scent because it seemed to be fading. Hermione must have taught him some camouflaging spells.
“It will look better if we stay back,” Malfoy shrugged. “Just trust me. I’m better at these things than you.”
Harry opened the bed hangings and they both stood and were stretching when the door opened and Ron stepped into the room. He stared at Draco’s bare chest for a moment, shaking his head. “Please tell me that you didn’t do anything while I was in here.”
As he focused on his attacker, he was surprised to see Neville. “I thought you were going for Blaise?” he asked, confused as he tried to make sure no one else was coming.
Harry opened his gifts next, getting a tin of treacle tart and a gold ring with a large P with detailed filigree work surrounding the letter. “It’s the Potter family crest,” Draco said, rubbing a finger over the ring. “I had to do some digging at Gringotts, but according to their records this is the closest to it they can get. One of the goblins remembered your grandfather and said it looks like the ring he wore…” He was cut off as Harry hugged him tightly.
“Oh, I see you have good taste,” the woman said. “That’s enchanted so that it will always fit the wearer and the stone flips open like a locket so that you can hide a little note inside. Would you like it? We offer discreet delivery,” she added, looking over his shoulder at Draco.
“I don’t mind sharing as long as it’s alright with you,” Harry shrugged. “It’s your bed, after all.”
Draco hesitated for a moment, before saying, “I would like it very much if this was real.” He kissed Harry’s forehead. “It’s been real for me since the first time I kissed you.”
“It’s fine,” Harry muttered, shrugging out of his clothing. He had a brief thought cross his mind, wondering what had happened to the version of him that had wanted to run away, but when Malfoy removed his own clothing all of Harry’s thoughts were on him. He reached out tentative fingers and traced the scars he had given him causing him to shiver. Pulling away, he tried to turn so that Malfoy could claim him.
“I’ve come to collect Harry,” Draco said, his drawling voice snide and annoyed. “I can’t believe the two of you were still sleeping.”
Things hadn’t been easy at first, but it rarely is with two people as strong willed and arrogant as Draco and Harry. Not to mention the fact that their children bore entirely too strong of a resemblance to their fathers. The first few weeks had some bickering and squabbles, but these things happen when children are involved and feelings have been hurt. Draco had worried about Harry for a while, but he seemed to come back to himself relatively quickly after the divorce was finalised. The children also seemed to calm once they got the swing of their new routine in Malfoy Manor.
“Oh, do shut up, Blaise,” Pansy spoke before Harry could say anything. “You’re so negative all the time. That’s why you can’t keep a partner even with your handsome face. Be nice or be quiet.”
“That’s all well and good, my darling boy,” she stepped closer and reached up to cup his face. “You’ve gotten so tall,” she said wistfully. “I suppose my actual question is do you like him? Yes, I know he’s your friend now, but is he more than that?”
“So when should we start acting like we’re together?” Harry asked as he turned and leaned against the windowsill.
Draco knelt behind him, kissing his neck and holding him close for a moment. “Thank you, Harry,” he whispered against his skin. He lightly pushed Harry forward onto his hands and used his free hand to grip his ass. When Harry was bent all the way forward, Draco rubbed his puffy hole, smiling as slick coated his finger. He pressed his finger into Harry gently, pumping it in and out for a few strokes before easily adding a second. He scissored his two fingers, stretching Harry as quickly as he dared without hurting him. Adding a third finger had Harry pressing back against him, whining for more. Removing his fingers, he lined himself up and asked softly, “Is this what you want?”
He wasted no more time on Cornfoot. Jumping to his feet he bolted, running as fast as he could into the hunting grounds. He saw Cormac McLaggen standing at a forked path, sniffing both directions. Draco slammed into him, sending him rolling into a tree. He hit his head and tried to stand, but seemed to be a bit unsteady. Draco kicked him square in the chest, knocking the wind out of him.
The functions he had attended after Astoria’s passing had been the hardest. So many piteous glances, so many well meaning sympathizers. They made him sick. Everyone said the same things, “We’re so sorry to hear…” “If you need anything…” It was all just to look good. To give the air of caring. No one actually cared. Well, no one except Harry.
“Why should I?” she huffed. “He’s my best friend and I’ve been worried sick.” She pulled her arm free and ran to Harry. Malfoy just rolled his eyes and let her hug Harry.
He rolled his eyes as he snuggled under the blankets. “I only listened because I wanted to go to bed anyway.”
When he entered the living area, Malfoy was sitting on the sofa with a mug of coffee as he read. A smirk was the only response Harry got when he entered the room. Crossing to the kitchenette, he started looking through the few cabinets to find a mug. He jumped when an arm slid around his waist.
“Nothing!” Ron insisted. “There was nothing.” Draco found this to be extremely hilarious and even Harry had a little chuckle before changing the subject.
“We are sleeping together,” Harry chuckled and hit him with a pillow. “Get up. Let’s go open presents.”
He stood in the middle of the room for several moments before there was a quiet knock at the door. “It’s open.”
Draco looked at the pizza that Pansy had placed on the counter, scrunching his nose in disgust. It wasn’t that he didn’t like pizza, it’s just that they had eaten pizza almost daily for the last four weeks. He supposed he should be thankful that they had anything to eat at all. Money was tight and the pizza place where Pansy worked let her keep anything left over at the end of her shift. He was thankful, but he missed having house elves.
Pansy had attempted to cook a few times so they could eat something else, but she was completely hopeless. Even Greg wouldn’t eat her cooking. She had somehow managed to burn the potatoes and keep them raw and hard. Draco had sworn when he poked it, it growled at him. So they were stuck eating leftovers from her job and takeout when they could afford it.
Harry moaned into his mouth as he pressed up against him, trying to get closer. He wanted to take Draco’s shirt off and was just about to when the bedroom door opened.
Potter just shrugged and rolled his eyes. “Both,” he said, surprising everyone other than Granger and Weasley.
“Yea, I get what you mean,” Ron nodded his head. “I just talked to Harry last night about how fast they seem to be going. I just worry about him. They’ve always been obsessed with each other, but the fighting was normal. This is just kind of weird.”
“I know,” Harry said, staring at the ground. He looked at Ginny laying on the ground. “Can we move her first. It’d be weird with her so close.”
While they were standing there, the floo flared up and Hermione stepped out the green flames with Ron following close behind her. She rolled her eyes at Harry as he stepped away from Draco.
Several days later, Draco found himself filled with nervous energy sitting across from Harry on the Hogwart’s Express. He had expected Granger and Weasley to join them since they weren’t staying at Hogwart’s either, but they were nowhere to be seen.
“Good point.” Harry let Draco pull him in for another hug. Grinning against his chest, he realized that this could actually work.
As he topped the first flight of stairs, he thought he might faint. He was so winded and so much more tired than usual. He wanted to stop and catch his breath, but he could hear them coming. He had to keep moving. He didn’t know what he would do if anyone caught him.
Harry picked up a dainty cup and examined it. “Those are narcissus flowers,” Draco smiled as he showed Harry the matching teapot. “This is exactly what I was looking for. Did you find anything good?”
Draco spent most of that evening playing chess with Ron while Harry and Greg watched Neville give awkward dance lessons to anyone that wanted one. Harry made sure that the girls ate, hanging around with them for a while before heading to bed. At this point, Draco was no longer sneaking into his bed. He came in with Ron when they were finished with their last chess game and climbed into bed with Harry, kissing his forehead when he woke and playing with his hair until he fell back to sleep.
“Yea,” he said, gently running his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Always the fire. Sometimes you get there in time. Sometimes, you don’t.”
The shock must have shown on his face because Draco was once again smirking at him. “I decided to make it a condition of our agreement that we can’t lie to each other. The magic that binds our contract will ensure that we always tell each other the truth.” He stood and attempted to straighten his clothing, then seemed to decide against it.
“And what happens in six months or a year when he gets bored and kicks you out. Where would you go then?” Draco asked. “And besides, Blaise can be a little crazy. If I ever became desperate enough to sell myself, it wouldn’t be to him.”
Draco panicked slightly and grabbed shirt, pulling him harder than he meant to so that Harry ended up laying completely on top of him. “I like you as more than a friend,” he whispered urgently and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry muttered. “I didn’t know you were in here.” Not wanting to interrupt, he turned to leave the room.
“I suppose that’s alright,” Harry said, calming down quickly. “I guess I’ll have the stew. It’s always good.”
“I know,” Draco said softly. His agreement knocked some of the anger out of Neville. “I know he’s too good for me. I’ve done so many… terrible, terrible things. I don’t deserve someone as good and kind as Harry. I know I don’t. But I want to. I want to do great things so that I can be someone that deserves him.”
“I got the job. You’ll never guess who I’ll be working for,” Draco shook his head, not quite believing it himself.
Potter laughed at that, his eyes lighting up in a way that made Draco smile. “I’m going to start dinner. Would you like to come see the kitchen?”
“I never thought I’d say this,” Harry said as they stepped through the gates, “But you’re entirely too nice.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Draco ran a hand through his hair. “He never talks about them and from what I’ve heard, they didn’t treat him well.”
She had a beanie pulled over her curly hair and looked a bit too warm with her scarf around her neck. “Harry,” she started quietly, “I wanted to make sure you’re alright. It’s nice to be getting along with Draco and his friends, but I want to make sure he’s not doing anything you don’t like.”
“Yea, if you want it,” Potter shrugged. “But you’ll probably want to see the place before you agree. It’s going to be a lot of work. Ron thinks I’m crazy.”
It was Harry’s turn to sigh. “Honestly, the line is very blurry for me. I’ve always thought that I hated Draco. Like, always. But now… Now I like being around him. He’s nice to me and he’s funny.”
He had his wand out, repelling spells she sent his way as she circled him. What he couldn’t see that Draco could was that she was slowly pushing him into a corner. “I don’t know why you’re fighting me, Harry,” she taunted as she slowly closed in. “We both know it’s me you’re waiting for.”
Several days later, Malfoy approached Harry in the hall on their way to the dungeons for Potions. “Harry, I’ve been looking for you,” he said as he wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders. He leaned his head close and added in a rushed whisper, “I’ve decided on my favor. I need you to be my boyfriend. Just for a little while. My mother is insisting that I take her friend’s daughter on a date during the next Hogsmeade weekend so I told her that I was escorting you. She has to think it’s serious enough to stop trying to set me up on dates.”
He rolled his eyes, but headed into the bathroom anyway. He turned the shower on and quickly undressed. He groaned as the warm water hit him, practically melting against the wall. He took his time, wanting to be completely warm before he left the shower. When he finally emerged and wrapped himself in a towel, he realized that he had forgotten something very important.
Potter rolled his eyes and turned away, motioning for Draco to follow him. They stepped into the corridor and Potter looked around to make sure they were alone. “I’ve figured something out and I need your help.”
Draco eased his prick into Harry’s ass, hissing at the tightness that engulfed him. He waited for a moment, giving Harry time to adjust to his size before slowly easing out and pushing back in. “Fuck, Harry,” he growled. “You’re so tight.” He groaned as Harry moaned and squirmed beneath him. Harry flicked his hips, trying to encourage Draco to go faster, so he did. He fucked Harry in long, fast strokes, enjoying the noises Harry made as he drew close to an orgasm. Draco reached around him, stroking Harry’s prick and growled in his ear, “Cum for me, baby,” smiling as Harry came, cum pulsing over Draco’s fist.
“Yea, I’d love to have a big family to fill up this big house,” he said. “I’ve spent a lot of time with the Weasley’s and their house is so warm and full of love. That’s what I want. What about you? Any plans for a future generation of little Malfoys?”
“Go to mine, if you don’t mind,” Draco said when Potter stopped at his own bedroom. “I have a radio.” Potter just shook his head before walking to the end of the corridor.
Draco wasn’t surprised at all when they were paired together as sparring partners. They quickly learned to move with each other and were often used by the professor to show the other students proper technique. Professor Williams also agreed to allow them to use their wooden practice swords outside of her classroom, as long as they were outside. Because of this, it wasn’t uncommon to see Draco and Potter practising by the lake after they were finished with their classwork. Other students would often gather to watch, but as it grew closer to Christmas and colder outside, the crowds grew thinner and thinner until it was just the two of them.
Robards smiled a crooked smile. "I wouldn't say that. You'll be missed. By me, anyway. By Merlin, you alone managed to catch more Dark wizards than the rest of the Aurors together during these years. But I guess it won't be the same after you become a father. People tend to be more cautious when they have children. "
Harry looked down at what he was wearing. "These are nice." The jeans were new, but soft and baggy like he was used to, and the t-shirt, well, he'd got that from Ron, but its colour haden't faded in the wash yet and it only had a little hole at the hem.
"You were waching me, I saw you." Potter still held his arm and his emerald eyes dug themselves into Draco's. "You're watching me all the time and... You think I don't notice, but I can see you watching me... in class, in the Hall... everywhere. Well, this will probably be the last chance I have, since it's our last year, and I know I make a complete fool of myself here, but I thought... that you might want to dance, with me."
Harry let out an unsteady breath and Malfoy pushed in even further and held still again, giving Harry time to adjust. Then he moved. He pulled himself out, almost all the way and thrust again, rubbing Harry's prostate on his way in. He fucked Harry in a long slow stride until he was buried inside, all the way to the root. Harry felt filled up, full, sated. Nothing he'd experienced before could compare with this. He moaned loudly and bucked up to meet Malfoy's thrusts.
It was packed with happy students and their dates, from all Houses. They were happy for a lot of reasons; for being young, for being alive and facing the end of the term and a two weeks holiday. Since this was their last Christmas at Hogwarts, they'd all come together and worked with the preparations, finally casting aside all their differences and petty quarrels.
pass the Leaky to get there. It's not my fault you're lurking out here in the backyard." Harry couldn't stop his tone from being snappish. "What's happened?" he added much calmer.
"Relax, Harry," she said. "I've tested it myself, and it was awesome. It was like fireworks inside me, as soon as Ron touched my hand. That's what it does; when your skin meets the bare skin of your true mate, your body will let you know. I almost fainted, couldn't breathe and my heartbeat went mad. And then it passed and everything went back to normal. Except," she smiled a shy smile, "now when we're together, I know that he's the one."
"I want to go out somewhere," Harry stated a week later when Malfoy emerged through the Floo. He was sitting tensed up, gingerly on the couch, nursing a glass of Fire-whiskey. "I want you to take me out and buy me a digusting amount of alcohol."
They continued up another floor. Here was the room Harry had chosen for his own bedroom, the only one with new paint, and the connecting bathroom was also finished with new tiles.
Minutes before, the door to the Pub had opened and a group of Slytherins had entered and joined some Housemates at a nearby table, among them a tall blond boy.
"What about Gringotts, then?" Harry asked, stopping with the brush in mid-air, dripping glue all over the floor.
Ginny glared at him. "So, are you gay?" she asked after a short silence. "Or is it just him you fancy?"
"Then I saw this." He paused and stopped in front of a high stone carving. "It's more than five thousand years old and Muggle-made. The museum is full of them, carvings and pictures of magical creatures and animagi, all made by Muggles." Harry tilted his head back and looked at the anchient block of stone. The carvings were worn and the stone incomplete, but it was a Hippogriff, no doubt about it. They strolled slowly along the walls and Harry gaped. This was as far away from the Muggle world he knew and grew up with as anything could be. There was a man with a fox-head, a woman half-bird, a thestral, dragons and all sorts of evidence of a magical world.
When they had ordered and the wine had been served, the silence stretched like the ocean between them. Harry cleared his throat.
Ron went over to look out of the magically charmed window. There was a beautiful spring day on display there. "I think Ginny would like you to come back."
Ginny had refused to live here when they set up home. She wanted something more modern and closer to the Burrow, so it was left as it was. Now, that he was free to do what he wanted, this felt like the most obvious choise.
Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat opposite him. He felt out of place and under-dressed in his jeans. At least he wore a button-down shirt over his tee. "Do you have any crisps or peanuts?" he asked. His belly growled as he hadn't had anything to eat since the lunch-sandwich he had together with Ron and George at the shop.
Harry shivered. He was fully dressed but ice-cold. "Where've you been? We looked everywhere," Hermione asked. She put an arm around him and pulled him closer. She had her buttercup-yellow nightgown on and she could feel his coarse jeans through the thin fabric.
"Not yet, anyway, maybe later. He's a great fan of yours, you know. He loves the stories of 'The Boy Who Lived'. You can't believe how ridicules it feels for me to read them to him at bedtime."
She stopped in the stairs up to the boy's dorm. The door slammed open and a naked Saviour backed out with his arms full of clothes. Pansy got a glimpse of Draco inside the room and the look on his face wasn't something she wanted to see. That gaunt horrid expression. Admittedly, it was a look she'd seen before, but it wasn't what she expected here, in the relative safeness of Hogwarts. Relative, because they were Slytherins after a war, but there were no Carrows, no Voldemort and Draco's father couldn't reach him.
But I couldn't stay. Of course, I couldn't. The next Thursday was the first in months I didn't go. And not the next, either.
Half an hour later Hermione had Floo-ed over to Ginny and the children, and Harry was seated with Ron, a steady Fire-whiskey in front of him at the table, while his best friend awkwardly patted his back. "It'll be all right, Harry. It's been like this before, but you two always seems to patch it up again."
He put his hands on the lower part of his abdomen. There was to be a baby. His and Malfoy's. With a mop of unruly black hair and a pointy nose, no doubt.
"We could… erm… I have a DVD," he started, avoiding looking at Malfoy at all cost. "We could watch porn, if you like?"
Malfoy put his hands on the table and fixed his eyes on him with a furrowed brow. "You're so dense sometimes, Potter, that I seriously doubt your ability as an Auror. Of course, I'm gay. I thought you knew. At first, I believed that was why you asked me about this, to impregnate you, and it really pissed me off. But you didn't, did you?"
When Malfoy pulled him aside and up to the bar again, and they laughingly had consumed large glasses of water before drowning their next shots, Harry's skin tinged with anticipation. He moved a little closer.
"What about the Dark-curse books? Auror problems?" Malfoy put the tiniest splash of milk in his tea.
"It's a 'Coming Out-shirt'," Seamus crowed and waved another over his head. "We got a whole box, charmed and ready, for everyone who wants them."
He checked the star-chart one more time. It had a lot of inconsistencies; the Moon had aligned with Venus in the eighth House and there was a shift in the fourth that dealt with home and family. About parenthood. Maybe it had something to do with his father being in prison, but that should have shown six month ago. He couldn't understand what it meant. He'd have to ask his mother in his next letter. She'd always loved enigmas in horoscopes, and she was the one who encouraged him to do his twice a year, in time of every solstice, winter and summer.
"No patricular reason at all." She put her empty coffee cup down and started to move around some scrolls on her desk, still not looking me in the eyes. "It's just that I had lunch with Hannah Abbott the other day, and
"They're my friends, why would I want to exchange them for someone new?" Harry leaned back over the flowerbed again and continued his work with the cultivator, mixing the soil with the furtilizer and removing the stubborn weeds.
Slowly he grasped the hand in his. It was warm, dry and a little callused from Quidditch. He didn't know what to say, his mouth had dried up. Potter grinned and gave Draco's hand a good firm shake.
Blaise looked at him silently for a while and shoved his hands into his pockets. "I've been thinking about that," he said. "It doesn't make any sense at all. How could it ever be a joke on you, if it happened the way you say it did?"
Malfoy scowled back at Zabini, but was compelled to take the challange, and Harry found himself out on the dancefloor opposite Malfoy. The pulse of the music was fast and heavy, and Harry watched Malfoy close his eyes and slowly start to move his body. They danced. Malfoy swayed, he swivelled, his eyes still closed, and his hips twirled in the most sensual way Harry didn't even know was possible, and all Harry was aware of was this sudden
Poppy looked at the boy in the middle. It was clear that the others had dragged him there, forced him to come and see her. He squirmed, but Weasley kept his grip on Potter's arm. Potter looked pale and his cheeks had hollowed again. He looked pretty much the way he used to, when he arrived at school in beginning of term in the years before.
Draco was standing next to Potter's four-poster and slowly took off the Invisibility Cloak. It had been the best thing to hide under during the day, present but not there for anyone to speak to. He had walked the corridors, sat in the Slytherin common room sofas, listening. He was grateful that Potter had let him have it, but now he had come to give it back.
on himself before putting on his pants and a t-shirt. Something in the frenzy of his movements made Harry feel more and more uncomfortable. Malfoy turned back to face Harry. His grey eyes blazed with fury. "You don't trust me with that? After this? After what we just did? Then why, in the name of Merlin, did you come here?" He almost yelled the last part.
They ate and they talked. They laughed. Harry found it was easy to make Malfoy laugh and that he liked it. When they had finished and both declined desserts, and Marina had left them with the remains in the bottle, Malfoy leaned back and took a long probing look at Harry. "Why do I get the funny feeling this is turning more and more into a date?"
It was Hogsmeade weekend. Being in 8th year and of age, they could go whenever they wanted, but Ginny couldn't, so they all agreed to make it a double date the coming Saturday.
Draco couldn't help the mirth that erupted in a chuckle at the thought of yesterday's fight. It had been immensely satisfying to let go of all his restrain and feel Potter's lip burst open under his knuckle. He shrugged. "A nose now for the nose I broke in sixth year. I'm not sorry for splitting your lip, though. You deserved it."
"A cow is a cow, neither Muggle nor magical." Draco shrugged. "I bet you only thought it was what you saw, a big house with a large recreational garden around it. It's much more than that. Small farmsteads, the village, a mill and workhouses. Where did you think all the food you ate at Hogwarts came from? The treacle in your treacle-tart?" He smiled. "We grow the sugar-beets to make that. Food cannot be conjured out of thin air, you know that. Many old pureblood country-homes, such as ours, provides foods of various kinds to Hogwarts, the Ministry, St Mungo's and many other places. We pride ourselves in the Wizarding World to be as self-supportive as we can."
Ron patted me, rather hard, on the back. "Seems I've shared a dorm with a bunch of queers all these years," he grinned. "Well, what do you know?"
"Moron," Harry cut him off, smiling and kissed him. He slung his arms around his neck and clung as close as he could. The baby was in the way, but it was their baby. Harry deepened the kiss and Draco's lips were hot and demanding. When they finally broke free, Draco held his hand at Harry's neck and pressed his face closer as he whispered, "I love you too, Harry."
"Please, Malfoy. Please, fuck me harder and faster." That was it, now he had lost that last bit of self-esteem and Malfoy would mock him for it for the rest of his life. But Malfoy put his hand on Harry's sadly neglected cock and started stroking it while fucking him with more determination a nd speed, every stroke nudging and rubbing Harry's gland. Sweat from his torso was dripping down on Harry's back and his hot breath tickled the hair at Harry's neck. Harry could feel his orgasm building, and his arms were shaking and his knees were wobbling, and Malfoy pushed and pushed, and then he murmured in Harry's ear, "Come for me, Potter. You can do it." And Harry did.
"Calm down, it's not that I'm allergic, or something. I just felt it was a good choice to make. Fish is... acceptable, I suppose."
Mrs Malfoy sat in a wicker-chair where the sun made a ray of warm light through the high window. An elf was scurrying around her, tucking a plaid over her knees. Harry saw the elf's gigantic green eyes give him a furtive look and something about them reminded him of Dobby.
Harry put his hands over his face and couldn't help a stifled laugh, feeling relaxed and sated. "You're an idiot."
"The choices we make in life, huh," his best friend muttered as he looked at Harry, nodding towards Draco, who was, at the moment, jumping up and down, waving his hands in the air together with Pansy and Luna.
Ginny was already sitting at the table too. She looked flushed from flying, her freckles barely visible on her rosy cheeks, and her red hair was damp. She grinned and waved at him from where she sat with her own year, at the other end of the table. She looked excited. This was her first year as Team Captain, and the tryouts today had been promising. Harry and Dean had helped her look at some of the new applicants since they, as eighth-years, wasn't allowed on the team this year. Afterwards they'd played a fierce two-on two together with Demelza, who was becoming a better Chaser each year.
"Of course, you can." Harry continued kissing, sucking the pale flawless skin of Malfoy's neck, not really listening.
"You're new here, aren't you? Oh, do join us, loves, we could use a bit of rejuvenating in our team," she said and made space beside her. "We're on a losing streak here since Martha's nephew got himself a girlfriend and stopped coming."
"I thought that was the general idea." Draco just had to add the smirk in his tone. Potter was far too delicious for his own good.
"Sometimes I imagine..." Draco started. He felt a heat flush over his face and was grateful for the lack of light. "Sometimes, all I wish for are the simple things in life, a nice couch and a fireplace. Someone to share it with."
"Yeah, I get that, but we have a lot of friends I'm sure will do it. Neville's from one of the oldest families."
I still wasn't so sure about that. I caught Seamus' eyes across the room. He gave me thumbs up when I saw the same two letters on his chest.
He paused and took a brief look at the stack of papers on his desk. "I can see here that you work as an Auror, Mr Potter."
"Yes, she wasn't allowed, of course, but she was young once too, you know. We used to sneak in here when Father was out and play them and dance to them. Ahh!" he exclaimed when sound suddenly came out of the brass speaker.
"I know you all like Teddy," he continued, "and he likes you, Heavens help him, the little bugger, and he always been a part of our family in a way." He went on to distribute the Chicken Marengo. "Well, I spoke to Andromeda, and she asked if Teddy could stay here with us when he comes home from Hogwarts this summer."
"Why not?" Malfoy rubbed his face with his hands and Harry waved the bartender over. "You might as well leave the bottle," Malfoy said as two new glasses were filled.
"Every player is important in the team," Flint stated pompously. "If you ask me, you put far too much focus on catching the Snitch when we played, Malfoy."
Malfoy was done. He sat back on his heels and watched his work. The ropes formed and intricate pattern. "Merlin, you're beautiful," he gasped. Malfoy's eyes met Harrys' and they were black with lust with a rim of silver and there was an indisputable tenting at his crotch.
"Now, my old friend," he said and turned languidly to Draco after Flint had left, "you can pour me another and tell me exactly why Potter has access to your home. I'm not as thick as that over-grown schoolboy, with his pretence of still being the Quidditch athlete, so don't insult me with more crap about the DMLE. If any such demand were made you would have torn down the Ministry to prevent it." He held out his glass to be refilled.
But Harry felt that his knees didn't support him and fell down on his seat again, and stayed there until the courtroom was empty.
The blond man looked at Harry's outstretched hand and sat down with a shrug. "You look positively down and out, Potter." Malfoy wrinkled his nose. "What do you want? Money?"
"You've done a marvellous job and I can't thank you enough," Harry said with a smile. "Why don't you come over for dinner next weekend, so we can celebrate properly?"
"We understand that this came as a shock," Hermione said. "We were so worried about you. When you ran out of the infirmery, we thought..."
Draco heard Potter whimper and gave another long lick, and this time he let his tongue swivel around the foreskin and the leaking slit at the top. The sensation of the smooth glans on his receptive tastebuds made him dizzy with desire. It tasted salty and a little bit bitter, but was in no way unpleasant. Potter let out one long ragged exhale and his head fell back on the pillow. He moaned, but lifted his head again and locked eyes with Draco. "Merlin's beard, Draco," he panted and then Draco took him all the way into his mouth.
Harry retched again, getting rid of the last remains of his lunch. It's been like this for the last two weeks now, and Healer Smith said it was perfectly normal and could go on for another two months, maybe three.
Harry shook his head. "It's not me you want for a job like that. Ron's the strategist among us and a better judge of character than I am. Give it to him."
"You see, I won't fall in love with some pureblood witch. There wouldn't be any pale Malfoy-babies."
"You have no fucking idea of what I want," Harry yelled. The other patrons around them had turned their heads and was curiously gaping at them. Some shushed and shook their heads.
Harry swallowed loudly. To let the world know he was having a baby with Draco Malfoy wasn't how he'd thought it would be, but he could understand Malfoy's point of view. The Wizarding World hadn't exactly been forgiving towards him after he was cleared in the trials after the war. He only got six months house-arrest together with his mother. His father, on the other hand, still served a lifetime sentence at Azkaban.
But in Potions it was impossible not to see him. Draco had tried to persuade Professor Slughorn to get him another assignment-partner, but since neither Blaise, Theo nor Pansy wanted to switch with him, Slughorn had declined. And he didn't have any more friends to ask.
In a haze, he had willingly agreed to all of Malfoy's demands, even the one about the name. He couldn't really answer why.
Harry sprang up from his seat, wand in hand and eyes flaming. He came close to Malfoy and hissed through his teeth, "Because I say so, you snivelling prat." A flick of fear crossed Malfoy's indifferent face, hardly noticeble before it was gone.
"Malfoy, I've been thinking. We're in a gay-bar, right, and I'm a bloke." Harry's tongue wasn't cooperating properly. It felt oddly large in his mouth. They were probably truly sloshed right now.
He was sitting in a chair by the desk, looking out of the window. The room was dark, only a faint light came in from a moon that wasn't quite full yet, but almost. It reflected in the rippling waters of the Dark Lake below.
I don't know," Harry groaned and mumbled, "I guess I find Malfoy rather fit, but that doesn't matter, you know. That doesn't change who he is or what he did."
The man at the desk raised his head as Harry opened the door. He was dressed in a perfectly fitted dark grey Muggle suit and the platinum blond hair was neatly cropped at the neck, with a few long strands falling over his eyes. Harry gasped. "Draco Malfoy?"
"Oh, you're so eager to please, aren't you? Maybe, you're ready for my cock. Do you want my cock up your arse?" Without waiting for Harry to respond he withdrew his fingers and hastily removed his dressing gown. Harry could feel the wet tip of Malfoy's cock nudge against his crack as Malfoy coated it with lube and began to press himself inside. One of his hands steered him while the other cirkled Harry's waist. Harry gasped and shuddered as the first inched penetrated. "It's all right, Harry, I've got you. Breathe."
Her hair was silky against his cheek and she smelled faintly of violets. A gush of warmth welled up inside him at the incredible sensation of her body against his. He could hardly breathe. She turned in his arms but stayed closed and pressed her back against his chest. Neville secured his arms around her waist and forced his attention back to the astonishing events in the room.
“Yes… You actually do.” He pressed his lips to Harry’s as he released his hands. Harry knew he should shove him away, but he found himself pulling him closer. As Draco deepened the kiss, making it more aggressive by nipping and biting at his bottom lip, Harry moaned. He whined when Draco pulled away, but was quickly appeased as warm, soft lips pressed against his neck. Reaching the base of his neck, Draco bit lightly and sucked, turning Harry into a quivering mess beneath him. “Do you like that, darling,” he asked as he pulled away and looked down at Harry.
Ginny continued to stalk towards him, firing spell after spell. She wasn’t giving him time to counter and his Protego was wearing thin. Draco closed in easily since all of her attention was on Harry. He jumped in front of Harry and cast a Protego just as Harry’s fell. Ginny screamed in frustration, “He’s mine!”
Harry continued to back away slowly, he would have liked to keep running, but he was so tired. It felt like he was moving through water and he felt feverish. “Stay back, Malfoy,” he whispered, not having the energy to yell.
Harry stood slowly and stretched, his cheeks heating as he noticed Malfoy watching him again. “When did you get so bossy?” he muttered as he headed to the bedroom.
As Harry opened his mouth to respond, Draco walked into the kitchen. “There you are, darling,” he beamed at Harry. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you. Ron ate the last of the mini quiches and I didn’t know if you’d had Kreacher make anymore.” He cupped Harry’s face and kissed his forehead before addressing Molly. “Are you enjoying the party, Mrs. Weasley?”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco sighed against his neck. “It’s ok and we are fine.” He pushed Harry up so he could look at him, “Do you want to kiss some more or go to sleep?”
“How observant of you, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. As Harry turned to look at him, he stood in a fluid movement and strode across the small room. “I was here first. I’ll not be sleeping on the sofa.”
“Do you want some bread or rolls?” Draco asked. When Harry nodded, he left the table with Ron and Greg to order their food.
Unfortunately for Harry, Ron had been right and Harry had just presented as omega in the Great Hall, in front of the entire school. Hermione had thrown up several spells to distract everyone while Harry ran. His current concern was that he wouldn’t make it to the seventh floor. He had barely made it to the second and was worried that he might pass out. As his pursuers grew closer, he realized that he had another option. He pushed himself and ran into the girl’s lavatory.
Draco chuckled, “That bad?” He shook his head when Harry nodded and kissed his forehead. “I’m going to shower and change. It won’t take long.” He left the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron.
“Lucky for you, you caught me in a moment of true and utter boredom,” Malfoy said as he stood. Now that he was actually looking down at Harry, he smirked, “Please feel free to lead the way.”
As they entered a corridor near the main entryway, Harry saw that Malfoy had been right. Several alphas were lingering in the hall trying to catch Harry’s scent. Apparently it had changed with the claim because it took a moment for them to notice him. Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle were amongst them, but when they saw Malfoy they dipped their heads and stepped back. Cormac McLaggen was apparently unconcerned with Malfoy and tried to approach Harry, ignoring the low growling from Malfoy. As he grew closer, Malfoy flicked his wrist sending a silent spell that slammed McLaggen against the wall. The others backed away, not wanting to challenge him directly.
“They usually do,” Hermione grinned as she pulled the beanie off her head and smoothed her curls. “If not, maybe we can push two together.”
As the night progressed, the dares became a bit more extreme. People were making out, several girls including Granger were topless, a few of the guys were completely naked, two Ravenclaw boys had been dared to spend twelve minutes making out in a room and had yet to return. No one seemed to be picking truth anymore. They all seemed to be pushing each other to see how far they would go.
“It’s perfect as long as it’s not pizza,” Draco muttered. Potter gave him a confused look and turned back to the things he had taken out. Draco was silent for a while as he watched him, but as the smell of chicken frying reached his nose his curiosity got the better of him. “I didn’t know you could cook.”
“Oh, I would love to go,” Hermione grinned. “Thank you for thinking of me.” They both gave Ron their food orders before returning to their conversation.
“I’m here if you ever do want to talk about it,” Draco said as he closed the gap between them. “No pity from me.” He opened his arms, giving Harry the option to hug him.
When the horn sounded, several Alphas broke away from the others to head straight into the hunting grounds. Draco made a beeline for Steven Cornfoot. He had heard him talking about going for Harry and he wanted to stop as much competition as he could. He slammed into the dark haired young man at full speed, sending them both to the ground. The spectators gasped as they collided. Draco didn’t give him a chance to recover from being knocked down. He punched him in the face several times before landing a solid blow to the side of his jaw that left him laying still.
Malfoy sat down with two Latte Macciatos doused in hazelnut syrup. He raised an amused eyebrow at Harry's expression as he tasted it. "Good? I remember you had an awful sweet-tooth back in school."
When the pain struck him, Harry fell to his hands and knees on the floor. No! He gasped for air. The baby!
Harry looked at the boy in his arms and something cramped in his chest. Malfoy seemed so at ease, so unguarded and relaxed. It made Harry feel like a freud, a fake. Panic rose like bile in his throat.
"Nooo, not Ginny," Harry wailed, repulsion in his voice. The hand that held the wand trembled and his glasses slid down on his nose.
Draco ran along the grovel-paths, rounded the old oaks, ancient as the Manor itself, and passed a nesting peacock-hen half hidden in the shubbery. It was a daily routine, one hour every day before breakfast. At first, in those wild days after the war, when all he could feel was guilt, guilt and shame, it was merely restlessness, but it had quickly developed into a need, an addiction, something he tried not to miss regardless of the weather. He had this vast park all to himself, after all.
"But that's outrageous! You can't treat any living being that way. I'm gonna care for Kreatcher, even if he can't stand me and insults me all the time."
They sat in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express on their way to spend the holidays at the Burrow, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, and since Molly knew, then probably Mr Weasley knew, and because of that Harry felt it necessary to tell Ginny. She'd soon find out anyway. It wasn't as if he could keep it hidden much longer anyway.
They worked side by side in the nursery, Harry insisting on putting on the glue with a brush the Muggle way, Malfoy levitating the ready-glued rolls up on the wall with elegant flicks of his wand.
Malfoy put his hands over Harry's, over Harry's lower abdomen, where there really was, Neville could see that now, a small belly. He saw Malfoy's eyes fill with tears, and they shone as he smiled widely up at Harry. He had rather nice eyes, Neville realized, when he wasn't scowling.
"What's up?" Harry asked. He dumped his bag of Quidditch-gear on the floor and placed his brand-new Firebolt lovingly against the bench before he plunked down opposite Ron and the rest of his classmates. He liked to take his time in the shower, avoid the curious stares. Despite the stupid hero-status, he was still short and skinny.
"Anyway, I'm so relieved it finally happend, so we can have some peace after this, without those utterly disturbing hormones pestering both our Houses."
Brilliant, Harry thought, a fit gay dictor, who apparently had the impression Harry wanted to go through with this pregnancy. He regretted he'd let Ron and Hermione wait outside; he could've used their support right now. Harry thought he'd never been in a more embarrassing situation.
"No, I didn't!" Potter raised his voice. "It's not my fault we're in this mess. Seamus can be a real dickhead sometimes." He lowered his voice again. "But I'm not sorry about the baby. I know this isn't what you wanted..."
WIth a startled pang he stopped. "Merlin, what have I done?" The insight of his actions cleared his mind completely. He couldn't bear to see the contempt and disgust in Harry's eyes, Harry's kind trusting eyes, so he cowardly screwed his own shut and Apparated home immediately.
"Maybe." Malfoy's voice was low. "But I don't put too much hope into it. What about yourself, then? Planning on going back to the DMLE now?"
When he was done, he helped Harry stand and wrapped him in a soft towel. "Can you walk?" Malfoy asked. "Or do you want me to levitate you?" Harry's legs felt like jelly, but he croaked, "I'll be alright."
It's been over a week since the case-trial and the evening that followed, which Harry refused to refer to as a date when he told his friends. With this scheduled meeting, however, there was no doubt though.
He could already tell that she smelled, but now it was absolutely unbearable. How could such a small being make such a vile mess.
"I wont." She swallowed hard. "Harry, I've meant to tell you for some time now, but it's not an easy thing to say." She bit her lip. "I've signed a new contract with the Harpies."
Harry felt Malfoy's sweat-coated body grew limp and heavy on top of him, his heartbeat pulsing against Harry's back. Harry liked the way the weight pressed him down, but when he shifted a little to get them chest to chest, Malfoy directly got up and put on his dressing gown.
at the chair on the floor and levitated the books and magazines back to the coffee table. He sighed. So, that was that.
When they parted, they shook hands and arranged to meet in a couple of days. "Ginny and I haven't quite worked out a schedule yet, and since she has a training match tomorrow, I have to be with the kids until she's home. But the day after should be fine. I'll open the Floo for you."
With a gasp Potter released his mouth and his eyes met Draco's. His goddamned bright green eyes, blown wide and black with lust, his perfect thick eyebrows drawn up in astonishment and a light sheen of sweat covering his forehead, where his famous scar stood out, shaped as a lightning bolt and slightly darker against the colour of his skin. "I want..." Potter said and licked his lips. Then he freed one of his hands from Draco's shoulders, mumbled a spell, and slipped it in between them.
Harry nodded, too perplexed to speak at the sight of his long-term antagonist, his childhood-bully. But there was no trace of malice in that familiar face, only a shy honest smile. Malfoy looked happy. He wasn't exactly good looking, he had too many sharp angles for that, but he was stunning in his posh way.
"Oh." He'd made a fool out of himself again. Why did he have to be this clumsy blabbering idiot? She would laugh at him and they all would mock him for this until the end of term, he knew it.
"But I was there," Ron sat up behind her back and put his hand on her arm. "We searched. I couldn't find you."
"How're you doing, mate?" Ron pushed Harry aside on the bench before he plunked down beside him. It was Sunday after Christmas and they were in the garden outside the Burrow, a bit away from the house to be hidden from veiw, but close enough for the sound of the children's laughter to reach them.
I know, I know, I took a lot of the description of Draco's life at the Manor from one of my favourite TV-series, Downton Abbey, but I truly believe that their is much more to Malfoy Manor than a huge park with peacocks. And where does all that food at Hogwarts come from? Do they buy from Muggles? In such large quantities, un-noticed? I don't think so.
"Look, Draco," Blaise sat up and leaned forward, resting his hands on his knees. "Maybe, just maybe, you should try to talk to Potter."
"No, I mean it. I love to make you feel safe and warm. I could watch you sleep, nothing more. I would really like that."
“Afternoon, Malfoy,” he called out as he approached the bench. “Teddy,” he said as he put the boy on the ground, “Say hello to Draco.”
On the third floor Draco was shocked to see the condition of the master bedroom. Potter explained that Sirius had kept Buckbeak in there as a way to defy his mother since it had been her room. “I thought it was funny at the time, but now as the one that has to clean it up,” he shook his head. “It’s not so funny anymore.”
“Potter?” Draco raised a questioning eyebrow when Potter looked up at him. “Why does my mother call you Harry and how often are the two of you having tea?”
Ron’s mood seemed to improve once food was in front of him and the tension eased out as Hermione started talking to Blaise about their N.E.W.T.S. Everyone seemed to enjoy the meal and by the end of it they were laughing and joking together.
As if reading his thoughts, Harry said, “Ron is a bit miffed at me for not coming to the burrow so Hermione is trying to calm him down.” He shrugged like he wasn’t bothered, “Hermione is cautious, but thinks that it’s good that I’m making other friends. Ron is… Well, Ron is just Ron. I don’t know if he’ll ever come around, but I like hanging out with you so he’ll have to get over it. So, tell me what a Malfoy Christmas is like.”
“I can’t believe I thought this was a good idea,” Harry muttered, shaking his head. He didn’t want to have Malfoy as his boyfriend, but he was tired of being asked out and having to watch the sadness on people’s faces when he said no. “Alright, fine. I agree to this,” he motioned between them, “Between us.”
“It has to be better than watching Granger’s book pile grow higher,” Malfoy said, proving Harry wrong as he stood and headed towards them.
Draco’s heart warmed a bit and it felt like his stomach did a little flip. He grinned down at Harry, “When do we start?”
Harry grinned at that and then his cheeks turned pink as he realised he was laying on top of Draco. “I’m so sorry,” he ran a hand over his face and started to get up slowly. “Were you petting me?”
“Exactly how long do you think we’ll be doing this?” Harry asked, confused as to how one fake date was turning into an entire relationship.
Harry’s cheeks turned a bit pink as he retorted, “I’m not sure there’s room at this table for the three of us.” When Draco gave him a questioning look, he added, “You, me, and your ego.”
Harry moaned and hissed, lapsing into Parseltongue as Draco bobbed his head up and down, sucking him in before sliding off to the tip. He wrapped his tongue around the head like it was a delicious treat before sucking him in again. He pulled away briefly, reaching through the curtains to grab Harry’s wand from the nightstand. He muttered a quick spell and pressed a lubed finger against Harry’s asshole as he started to suck him off again. “Yes?” he asked, his lips against Harry’s prick and his finger circling his tight hole.
“Not at all,” Potter shrugged. “We can put any clothing in one of the other bedrooms for now. I’d like to donate it, but I wouldn’t know where to take it.”
“You’re kidding me, right?” Ron stared at him. “You can’t think of a single person that doesn’t like you?” He gestured dramatically across the room where several Slytherins were ignoring everyone else.
Several days later, Draco found himself sitting on a bench in a Muggle park waiting for a potential employer. He had found an ad in a Muggle paper that had been enchanted in a way that only a witch or wizard would have spotted it. It was just for a cleaning position, but there was a chance for room and board. He would love to be able to stop freeloading on his friends so he sent a note asking for an interview before he could talk himself out of it.
When they’d both agreed, she sat in front of the tree and passed them each two gifts. Harry had gotten Draco a box of the finest chocolates Honeydukes had in stock and a silver pocket watch with the Malfoy crest. When he opened it, his initials were engraved inside. “This is brilliant,” he whispered and quickly kissed Harry on the cheek. “Thank you.”
“I dare you to do a striptease for Potter,” Blaise’s grin grew even wider as he waited for Draco’s response.
“Well, you’re going to have to get used to it,” Draco replied casually. Seeing the irritation building on Harry’s face, he added, “If it makes you feel better, we can take turns. I’ll get lunch today, you get it next time or buy me some chocolate when we go to Honeydukes.”
The conversation died down a bit as they ate. The little bit that continued was mostly Pansy and Hermione with Blaise chiming in occasionally. Harry couldn’t help but to smile as he watched his friends, old and new. It was hard not to like Draco’s friends and he hoped that they’d get along when all this was over.
“Oh hardy har har,” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re so hilarious.” He was about to say something that Harry was certain would have caused an argument, but Slughorn entered and drew everyone’s attention to him before starting class.
He had finally relented and now he found himself sitting with Pansy across from Potter and his little gang of do-gooders with a very full glass of fire whiskey in hand. Everyone raised their glasses in a little toast before quickly drinking the whiskey. Draco barely repressed a shudder as the liquor burned down his throat. He noticed Potter shuddering dramatically and chuckled to himself.
“There’s studying to do,” Hermione remarked from behind the pile of books she had stacked on a nearby table.
They were about to ascend to the third floor when Draco noticed a fifth door at the end of the hallway and pointed it out, “What’s in there?”
“What did Ron say that has you so riled?” Harry asked as he came to stand beside him. He leaned lightly against Draco so that his head was on his shoulder.
“Don’t get mad, Weasley,” Blaise said, immediately standing and backing away slowly. “Just know that she asked me.”
“That’s the beauty of it, Potter. We already are.” When Harry looked at Malfoy in confusion, he continued, “What do you think people are going to say when word spreads that you invited me to your room? And if they find out you locked the door and put up a Silencing spell.” He shrugged and walked over to stand in front of Harry.
“I’m not sure,” Harry whispered. When Malfoy shrugged and rolled onto his back, Harry wondered if that was something that he wanted. “No one’s ever held me like that. At least, not that I remember.”
“Oh that’s wonderful,” Pansy cried out, hugging Hermione. “Promise me, we’ll get ready for the Yule Ball together.”
They agreed that it would be best to work on casting a Protego first. It took a few tries, but within an hour both of them could cast a solid Protego from the hilt of their sword. It took another hour to be able to maintain the Protego while fighting. They took their time and continued to strengthen their shield charms and expand them. They both agreed that the stronger the shield the better.
When they finally calmed down, Draco syphoned the dust off of Potter before directing his efforts to the bedding. “How about you focus on getting these ratty hangings down?”
“This,” he said as he pressed his lips to Harry’s. His kiss was slow and gentle as if he had all the time in the world. Harry responded readily, one hand sliding into Draco’s hair the other gripping his waist to pull him closer. Draco shifted his weight to one arm so that he could slide a hand up Harry’s side, under his shirt. His palm felt cool and smooth against Harry’s heated skin as he caressed him gently.
After it had been sent, he had immediate doubts. No one magical would want a Malfoy in their home. He had been stupid to try. So, imagine his surprise when he actually got a response asking him to meet for an interview.
“He’s absolutely wonderful,” Pansy beamed. “The best shopping partner I’ve ever had.” Harry chuckled as Ron blushed from the attention. “I hope they have a table open big enough for us all,” Pansy added as they filtered inside.
“Yea, he never stays mad for too long,” Harry agreed. “Do you want the shower first?” he asked as he grabbed his pajamas.
Harry had stopped in the middle of the hall and was staring at him. “I think you may have gone round the bend,” he cocked his head sideways and continued to stare at Malfoy. “Are you serious, Malfoy?”
“Yea, alright,” Harry murmured, feeling awkward. He crossed the room and stopped just inside the bedroom. “There’s only one bed.”
Harry heard the door shut and assumed that Ron had shut it in Draco’s face, so he did the logical thing and rolled over to tuck his head under his pillow. He was very surprised when the blankets were pulled off of him and his pillow yanked away.
Harry tried not to feel too disappointed when he woke up in bed alone the next morning. As he crawled out of the large bed, he was thankful to see that his trunk had been brought in. He quickly pulled on socks and changed into his favorite jeans, but he debated about changing his shirt. Malfoy’s jumper was warm and soft and he didn’t think that he was quite ready to relinquish his hold on it just yet. He’d wait and just wear it for now.
Harry had finally had enough and grabbed him by the lapels. “Ronald Bilius Weasley!” he yelled. “Calm the fuck down! You’re stressing me out.”
By the time Molly and Arthur left, everyone had started drinking a bit heavier. Draco had taken Hermione to his room to sleep after she’d had a few too many fire whiskeys and had started singing at the top of her lungs. Several of their friends were sleeping in spare bedrooms and everyone else was heading home.
He didn’t know what to do with himself as Potter started pulling things out of the refrigerator and the cupboards, so he leaned on the counter by the sink, hoping to stay out of the way.
“Why are you always so stubborn, Potter?” Malfoy wiped a hand over his face. “Just admit that you felt better when I was closer. It’s honestly that simple.” He rolled his eyes when he saw Potter slumping down the wall. “Damn it, you stubborn little git.” He walked over and pulled him to his feet. “I’m starting to think that the Prophet was right and you do have a death wish,” he grumbled as he pulled him against his chest.
“No, I don’t believe so,” he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, gaining a scowl. “Just trust me when I tell you that it’s in all of our best interests to be seen together.”
The day after Christmas wasn’t quite as laid back with Draco and Harry resuming their practice. They started after breakfast and only stopped for lunch because Narcissa made them. “I’ve been doing some reading in the library,” she informed them as they ate. “I think that the methods you’re using were once much more common. There are depictions of wizards with swords and other weapons predating Hogwart’s.”
The last day of classes before the Yule Ball was difficult to get through. Everyone was filled with nervous energy and found it difficult to pay attention in class. Several professors took it easy on them and let them go early. When they were finally finished, Pansy practically kidnapped Hermione saying that they had to do facials and get a moisturizing hair mask on Hermione so that they’d be ready for tomorrow. At some point in the evening, Blaise was seen running away from Pansy’s room after trying to get a picture of her and Hermione in their mud masks.
“Maybe you’re right,” Pansy agreed. “I’m pretty sure most of the attitude Draco used to have was to impress his father anyways. So I suppose it’s not surprising that he’d change without that awful man looming over his head. I know I have.” She looked up and waved as Greg joined them in the common room.
As Harry grabbed his clothes and opened the door to the loo, Ron flopped onto his bed and called out, “Let me know when the wedding is so I can get a date.”
“Yea,” Harry squeezed her hand. “We’ll see.” They left his room and headed to the common room to wait for everyone else. “So you and Pansy are going to be friends?”
“If you have a moment, I need to speak with you.” He looked at the surrounding Slytherins and added, “Privately.”
“I don’t think I want to talk to the professor about it,” Harry said, sprawling out next to Draco. “I doubt she knows much more than us.”
As his breathing returned to normal, Draco looked down to see Potter smiling up at him, a drop of cum shining on his chin. He swiped it with his thumb and pressed it to Potter’s lips, grinning as Potter sucked it from his thumb. “That was bloody brilliant,” he said, pulling Potter to his feet.
Draco was surprised to find Pansy home when he entered the flat. “How’d the interview go?” she asked.
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to checking the barrier, more carefully now that he had been attacked.
As people arrived at the party, Harry calmed down a bit. He had too much to do to be nervous. The turnout was bigger than he had expected with most of their friends and Hermione’s colleagues showing up along with the Weasley’s. Harry was happy that he hadn’t caved in to Molly about having the party at the Burrow. There wouldn’t have been room for everyone. There was barely room for everyone here at Grimmauld. People were in the parlour, the dining room, and the garden. He had even found a few people leaving the kitchen after Kreacher had chased them out.
He looked around the large room, a piano in the corner catching his attention. He sat in front of it and tapped a few keys just as the floo flared to life and Potter stepped back through.
The game started out as what Draco would have considered to be typical. Girls being dared to flash their breasts, boys being dared to show their pricks or asses. It was incredibly juvenile, but entertaining enough to keep his attention. The truths were pretty boring to begin with, but his ears perked up when Macmillan called on Potter and he said truth.
Molly seemed flustered for a moment. “I am. I wasn’t aware that the two of you were seeing each other.”
“He doesn’t have a fated mate. It’s pretty rare from what my mother has said.” Malfoy wrapped an arm around his shoulders as they grew closer to the main section of the school. “Be prepared. The other alphas won’t be able to affect you since I’ve claimed you, but that might not stop them from trying.”
“I actually don’t hate that,” he grinned. He looked away for a moment and suddenly pulled Harry close to his chest to whisper in his ear, “Don’t pull away. We have an audience.” His hand cupped Harry's cheek and he tipped his face up, capturing his lips in a gentle kiss. His free arm wrapped around his back, holding him close.
“Take it easy on him,” Draco shrugged. “Ron beat the hell out of him already and he might not realise what he almost missed by going in there.”
“Usually, I only make them for my kids, but Harry and Hermione seem to like them so much that I thought you all might, as well,” Molly beamed, her cheeks pink from all the attention.
“Yea,” Potter chuckled. “I was quite surprised when you messaged about an interview, but honestly it makes it easier since I know you already.”
“Yes,” she nodded. “I need to get a few books for Arithmancy and Transfiguration. I’m hoping to get a head start so I won’t be playing catch up after Christmas break.”
They spent the remainder of the evening laughing and listening to each other tell stories about past Christmases. Draco even laughed when his mother told the story about him setting traps for Santa and catching a house elf instead. It was one of the best Christmas Eve’s he had ever had.
“Sounds good, love,” Draco agreed. They ushered Molly out of the kitchen and returned their focus to the party.
“Can I help you, St. Potty,” Malfoy sneered, managing to look down at him even though he was the one sitting.
He chuckled against Draco’s chest, craning his head up to look him in the eye. “Do you think you could call me Harry?” His cheeks heated again as he asked, causing Draco’s heart to beat just a little faster.
Harry relaxed against him, feeling content as he drifted off to sleep. He could definitely get used to this.
Sunday was much the same, the difference being that Pansy was practically clinging to Ron when she wasn’t talking to Hermione. He had asked her to the Yule Ball and she was ecstatic. She had decided to make it her mission to get Hermione a date.
“Scared, Potter,” Draco stood, towering over him. The little git barely came up to Draco’s shoulder.
“This was a great idea,” Mrs. Weasley said to Narcissa as they entered the drawing room after dinner.
When they’d all gone to bed for the night, Harry could hear Ron muttering to himself. “Are you alright over there?”
Draco smirked, “That’s genius.” He turned back to the tapestry. “We have something similar at the manor for the Malfoy family line. If you like, I can owl my mother to see if she knows how to repair it.”
“They didn’t treat me well,” Harry spoke softly. “I don’t talk about it much because I don’t want people to pity me.”
Harry glared up at him. Shaking his head, he smiled at the absurdity of it all. A lot of things would be different now, but looking at the sneer that seemed to be permanently affixed to Draco’s face he realised that some things would always be the same.
He was quiet while Harry called Kreacher and when the elf brought their food, not even speaking through dinner. Harry expected him to go back to his room after eating, but he just climbed back into Harry’s bed leaving room for Harry.
Draco cast a quick incarcerous at Ginny to ensure that she wasn’t a threat if she woke up. He turned back to Harry and slowly used the few healing spells he knew to heal his eye and lip. He caressed his jaw when he was done. “It’s not perfect, but it shouldn’t hurt as much now. Are you alright?”
Harry moaned softly when he bit his bottom lip, sucking out into his mouth before releasing it. He tried to pull Malfoy closer, one hand tangling into his hair while the other slid up his side, but he pulled away to rest his forehead on Harry’s.
He gripped Harry’s hips and pulled him backwards, fucking him hard as Harry slumped forward, his moans muffled by his pillow. “Harder or slower?” Draco growled, barely hanging onto his control by a thin thread.
Draco completely understood. After all, he had nightmares too. “Would you want to sleep here? The bed is big enough or you could sleep on the sofa if you’d be more comfortable?”
“Potter,” a very familiar, drawling voice echoed behind him. He’d recognize that voice anywhere. Of all the alphas in the school, of course it would be Malfoy to find him. “You know, everyone else is headed to the seventh floor,” he said, stalking slowly towards Harry. “But I knew better. Thankfully I caught the tunnel before it closed. Although, after having the Dark Lord as an unwelcome guest in my home for so long, I can say a few things in Parseltongue.”
“Yea, sorry about that,” Malfoy grinned as he found his trousers and pulled his wand from his pocket. “This should help until we can get you to a shower,” he said before Harry felt the tingle of magic. The cleaning charm felt cool against his heated skin. “Here,” he added, handing Harry his clothing.
Harry pushed him further into the pillows and started kissing down his neck, stopping briefly to suck on his ear lobe. He bit lightly into Draco’s shoulder, kissing it before moving lower to run his tongue around his nipple. He flicked his tongue against the tight little peak and sucked again, drawing a moaning sigh from Draco’s lips. When he moved again, his ass brushed against Draco’s growing erection, causing him to hiss. “Did I hurt you?” Harry asked as he tried to move away.
Harry thought for a brief moment that he should ask him to stop, but it felt so nice. He had never been kissed or touched like this, like he was precious and important. He felt wanted for the first time and he didn’t care if it was fake. He sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth drawing a groan from him. Draco’s hand slid to his hip, gripping tightly as he thrust his own hips forward, his obvious erection pressing against Harry’s.
“I used a charm on it,” Draco shrugged as he tried to find an acceptable station to play. “Sit,” he said over his shoulder, grinning as he found the station he wanted. Soft music soon filled the room helping Draco to relax, but apparently putting Potter more on edge. Draco quickly retrieved his stash of scotch, taking a swig before offering it to Potter.
“If you knew it was me, why bother meeting for an interview?” Draco asked, feeling annoyed at having come out for nothing. “We both know you won’t hire me. You hate me and rightly so.”
He caught a faint hint of Harry’s scent as he headed the other direction, but it seemed to be coming from behind an exterior barrier. That was odd, they shouldn’t be able to go beyond the barriers. Before he could think too much about it, he saw movement near the corner of his eye. He braced himself, quickly grabbing his wand he managed to use a Protego in time to deflect the curse aimed at him.
Draco lost track of time as Potter devoured him. His fingers curled into his messy hair, holding on as his soul was sucked from his body in the best way possible. As he grew close, he tried to pull away again. “Potter,” he growled through clenched teeth. “I’m going to cum.” Potter just held him tighter and gripped his balls lightly, playing with them until he tipped over the edge. His legs shook as he came. Gripping Potter’s hair, he flicked his hips, fucking his face as jets of hot cum hit the back of his throat.
“That grin looks a bit suspicious, Potter,” Draco said, his eyebrow arching as he looked around the room half expecting Harry to be up to something.
Draco pulled away slowly, grinning at the glazed look in Harry’s eyes. “Let’s get you to bed,” he said softly and walked Harry to his room. He gave him another quick peck on the lips and sent a very confused Harry into his room.
“They weren’t shagging yet, but I think if I hadn’t interrupted, they would have been,” he scrubbed his hands over his eyes as if trying to get rid of the memory. “That’s why I talked to Harry last night. Apparent;y, he’s decided not to take my advice.”
Draco pulled Harry close and kissed him. It was firm and quick, but that one kiss spoke volumes. “I love you, too Harry,” he whispered against his lips before kissing him more thoroughly.
“I just want tonight to be perfect,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair. “Hermione deserves it. She’s worked so hard to get that promotion.” He looked up at Draco, his face serious. “I don’t want the focus to be on me and I know Molly is going to question me about who I’m dating.”
“Just a moment, mother,” he responded, his voice hoarse and raspy. He cleared his throat, “We’ll be right there.” He looked up at Harry, his cheeks pink and eyes shining. “I suppose it’s time for breakfast, but I’d really like to revisit this later. If that’s alright.”
“I didn’t know that I was your friend,” Draco said, his voice soft. He was certain that in that moment, he looked vulnerable, but he couldn’t seem to put his uncaring mask back on.
Harry was stiff for a moment before pressing against him and kissing back. They clung to each other, barely breathing as they explored each other’s mouths. Hands started moving, gripping, and caressing as the kiss grew more heated. He slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, savoring the feeling of his warm skin. He had just started to inch his shirt up when a swift knocking drew his attention.
“That’s fine. Give yourself some time to think about what makes you happy,” the headmistress said, giving him a rare smile. “And you, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco was about to agree when Minister Shacklebolt stepped into the clearing at the edge of the hunting grounds. A quick Sonorous charm amplified his voice for the gathered crowd. “I would like to thank each of you for coming today. Everyone that is not participating in the hunt should head up to the observation area so that you’ll be able to see any couples that emerge from the hunting grounds.
“It’s just the way omegas are,” Malfoy shrugged. “Once you have an alpha, you need them and they need you. As the claim solidifies and becomes more stable, you’ll be able to have a little more freedom. That’s why Pansy is stuck up Weasley’s arse all the damned time. She’ll get sick and he’ll get aggressive if they’re too far apart. I’m not sure why it happens, but it does.”
“I don’t get why you don’t want a date,” Ron said after the last disappointed girl walked away. “They obviously have guts to just come right up and ask you. Talk to one of them. You might like them.”
Harry scowled at him because he was right. “Yea, ok. I like that we can’t lie to each other, but you should have told me.” He rolled his neck, feeling stiff around the area where Draco had sucked on his neck. “Oh my gods. Did you give me a hickey?”
As they left the Great Hall, Pansy pulled Hermione to the side. “Is it alright that I’m going to Hogsmeade with Weasley?” she asked. At Hermione’s confused look, she added, “Since we’re trying to get along, I wanted to make sure. I tend to flirt, but if we’re to be friends then I know he’s off limits.”
“I don’t need to see it. I’ll take the job,” Draco said quickly. He didn’t want to risk Potter giving the job to someone else. “When do you want me to start?”
“I can help, but the only way they can’t challenge me is if I claim you first,” Draco shrugged. “If you’re mine, no one can take you.”
When he moved under the blankets, Harry saw that he wasn’t wearing a shirt and the bed suddenly felt much smaller. He definitely needed some distance. “Scoot over,” he huffed, giving Malfoy a little shove.
They sat together talking about classes and NEWTS until the common room emptied. “Are you going to tell us what’s actually going on?” Parkinson asked Malfoy.
“I wish I could relax,” Potter sighed, scrubbing his hands over his face. “I think I’ve forgotten how.”
They had barely made it ten feet out of the Three Broomsticks when a man stepped in their path. “Mr. Potter,” he said gruffly, a quick quotes quill floating behind him with a piece of parchment, “Jonathan Wilkes with the Daily Prophet. I have a few questions. Have you been placed under the Imperious curse by this Death Eater? Why are you spending time with the children of known Death Eaters? Is Mr. Malfoy forcing you to be in his company?”
“We all get good press out of it,” Malfoy shrugged. “They’ll get to look like they’ve rehabilitated us and we get a chance to prove we’re not as awful as our parents.” He looked down at Harry. “And the fact that I get to annoy this one is purely a bonus.”
“No shit!” she exclaimed, her eyes going wide. “So, I guess you’ll be gone before I’m done at work tonight?”
“You’re not the only one,” Weasley agreed, accepting the drink. “Do you and Harry have any plans since Ginny has the kids this weekend? Mione and me can keep Scorpius if you lot need a proper break. Hugo would love having another boy around for the weekend.”
“As per usual, I suppose,” Blaise commented. “I have to be off though. I told Ginny I’d walk her down.”
“Quit being so dramatic,” Draco rolled his eyes as he filled his coffee cup. “It’ll heal quickly enough. And maybe next time you won’t keep me from my coffee.”
It took them some time to get to the Great Hall since they had to be mindful of the stairs because of the girls' dresses and shoes. After Hermione almost tripped, Greg picked her up, ignored her squeals of protest and carried her to the main hall. When they finally entered the Great Hall, they were met with a huge transformation. It looked similar to the first Yule Ball, but better in Harry’s opinion. Tables pushed to the sides creating a huge dance floor, Christmas trees in every corner. The Weird Sisters were already playing and people had started dancing and were laughing and having fun.
“Well, where am I supposed to sleep?” Harry ran a hand through his wet hair. He was cold and tired and didn’t particularly feel like fighting with Malfoy. He just wanted to be warm and dry. “That sofa doesn’t look long enough to lay down on.”
“I had hoped that it would be,” she agreed, sitting next to Molly. “I was so happy when you accepted the invitation.” She was interrupted when Blaise and Ron started laughing.
“You haven’t seen Draco, have you?” he asked when he drew closer. “I thought he might be with you. I went for my run this morning and he wasn’t in his bed. I just came from the showers and he’s still not back.”
“Oh,” Neville muttered, clearly at a loss for words. Harry stepped quietly back up the hall to his room, not wanting them to know he’d overheard.
Harry ignored the whispers as he entered the Great Hall with Draco’s fingers twined in his. He was surprised to see that Draco’s friends were already sitting with Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table. He sat next to Hermione with Draco slipping into the spot next to him.
It was a quick walk back to the park and Draco breathed in a sigh of relief at seeing Potter still sitting on the bench where he left him. He had worried the entire way back that Potter was messing with him and wouldn’t be there, but he was. Laughing as he watched Teddy play. Draco sat beside him, watching as the little boy climbed up the wrong side of the slide. When he got to the top, he stood victorious for a brief moment before turning and sliding back down.
“I have an idea, but I don’t know if you’ll like it,” Draco spoke softly. Harry looked at him expectantly. “Christmas break starts in a few days. You could always come to the manor with me. It’s just me and my mother. And the elves of course. But the manor is huge so we’d have plenty of space and privacy.” Second guessing himself, he added, “Or we could find somewhere here and just stay at Hogwart’s if that makes you more comfortable.”
They looked up as Draco came back, followed by Ron and Greg. The three of them were attempting to balance very full mugs of butterbeer. A tray full of food levitated behind them. As soon as they unloaded it, it disappeared.
“I didn’t want to bother you,” Harry mumbled. Speaking louder, he added, “I feel like I’ve been interrupting your reading since last night.”
Draco was a bit more difficult. He watched as he looked at different things, nothing seeming to hold his interest for too long. The only thing he looked at for longer than a moment was a silver tea set, but he mentioned that his mother might like that. Harry was quickly losing hope as to what to get him and he had to get him something. He had picked out a fancy new quill, a grey cashmere scarf that matched his eyes, arranged to have personalized stationery made, but none of that seemed personal enough. Yes, Draco wasn’t actually his boyfriend, but the gift had to be personal enough to look like it was special. What did you get someone that already had everything they wanted?
As soon as his knot went down, Draco slid gently out of Harry and used some cleaning charms before helping him dress. His only thought was that Harry was tired and needed to rest. Dressing quickly, he picked Harry up easily and carried him out of the clearing. As they passed Ginny, she was awake and fighting to get free. Her muffled screams followed them until they passed Harry’s fake barrier.
“Of Human Bondage,” he answered as he stroked Harry’s hair. He leaned down and kissed his forehead before telling Harry about the book.
Draco laughed as he rolled on top of him, settling himself between Harry’s legs and holding himself barely above him. “You know what would make me feel really good?” his lips barely brushing Harry’s skin as he spoke.
“Can I help you?” a woman asked softly. Harry looked up surprised to see that she wasn’t much older than him.
Harry’s laughter at Ron’s situation died in his throat as Draco stepped into the room. He was also wearing a Muggle style suit that was dark blue with grey accents and a grey vest. His stormy eyes flashed with heat when he saw Harry. A wolfish grin spread across his face as he stalked across the room to his date.
A heavy hand clapped Draco’s back, drawing him from his thoughts and back to the dreadfully boring Ministry function. “You awake in there, Ferret?” Weasley asked and gave him a little shake.
“That was progressing quickly,” Malfoy said, grinning down at him when he had caught his breath. “Having a great snog in bed definitely has it’s merits, but it also brings a lot of temptation. I don’t want you to feel pressured.”
“Fine,” Draco huffed. He grinned as he stood, pulling Harry with him. He kept his pajama pants on and pulled a plain white tee shirt over his head before pulling on the jumper Mrs. Weasley had made him. He turned around to find Harry grinning at him, “What? It’s warm.”
“Don’t worry about it Potter,” Draco shrugged. “I’ve gotten quite good at cleaning spells living with Pansy and Greg. If you don’t mind, I’ll take the four poster on the same floor as you. I wouldn’t mind being close to the library.”
They found Narcissa in the kitchen. She was talking to a house elf in hushed tones and smiled when she saw them. “Good morning, darling. And a good morning to you, as well, Mr. Potter.”
After saying their goodbyes and doing a quick clean up, Draco and Harry said goodnight to Narcissa and headed to bed. “It seems as though Weasley isn’t as cross with you,” Draco said as he pulled his jumper over his head.
Congratulations on finding yourself a job. Any job done with pride is a job worth doing. It’s good that you’ll be spending time with Harry, as well. Being around him will be good for your image and it may help him because I worry he’s lonelier in that big, old house than he admits. Please tell him I said hello.
Harry took a deep breath and put his leg over Draco’s lap so that he was straddling him. He leaned forward and stopped just short of kissing. “Is this alright?”
The drawing room was the best, in his opinion. Swags and candles graced the mantle where his mother had put stockings for the three of them. A large tree, trimmed in red and silver, sat in the corner by the window, the fairy lights twinkling and reflecting off of the glass. His mother had tasked the house elves with gathering the gifts they had gotten for their friends and placing them under the tree. Festive pillows were on the sofas with fuzzy blankets in a basket near the hearth. Draco felt excited for Christmas for the first time in years and when he saw the joy on Harry’s face, he knew this would be a Christmas worth remembering.
Pansy stared at Ron in expectation until he blurted out, “You’re so hot.” This seemed to be enough to satisfy her since she took his arm and started leading him out of the room.
“I personally think that our dates are very lucky to have us,” Harry grinned at his reflection, feeling more confident than usual.
“And I just want some quiet in the common room, but your little friends won’t stop whining with concern about you,” he watched Potter for a moment waiting for him to do something, but he just lay there. All these years of taunting and fighting and he wouldn’t even look back at Draco. This simply wouldn’t do at all. “Listen, Potter, your friends are driving me mad. If you don’t get up, I’m coming in there with you.”
Harry’s cheeks heated slightly and he quickly took a sip of coffee to hide his face. When he finally emerged from behind his cup, he shrugged his shoulders, “I slept pretty well, actually. No nightmares either.”
She smiled lovingly as she watched Harry and Draco open treats, clothing, and books. She had even gotten Harry a new winter cloak. When he tried to say that it was all too much, she held up a delicate hand, “I’ve always loved doting on my son, but I wasn’t fortunate enough to have more children to spoil so you would do me a great kindness in accepting these gifts.”
“Yes, I do,” he grinned. “But we both know what you enjoy.” His grin grew wider as Harry’s cheeks tinged pink.
Draco laughed at that, “The honesty condition does have a disadvantage after all.” He paid for the tea set and arranged for delivery before asking, “Do you want to get dinner here, or go back to the school?”
Draco rolled his eyes as he looked around the circle of students. Some were friends and allies while others were former enemies being awkwardly polite thanks to a tentative truce. It was a strange gathering of students, but it was a good way to pass time instead of sulking alone dwelling on the past.
“No, he just said that you were busy,” Hermione said, looking confused as to what exactly Draco found so amusing.
“Oh, I see now,” Draco nodded his head. “I used to think that I’d end up married to Pansy. She was always there. She was familiar and reliable. It was easy to let myself believe that we were meant to be together. But we’ve both grown. I want children eventually, but I want to make something of myself first. I need to prove to myself that I can make it in the world as Draco. Not just as a Malfoy. Pansy doesn’t understand that. She’s perfectly happy to continue on as a little princess and let someone else take care of her.” He moved his hand up and started running his fingers through Potter’s hair. It was softer than he’d expected. “It took us both some time to accept that we just weren’t meant to be.”
“You’re not interrupting anything, Mother,” Draco sighed, his cheeks flushing. “Harry’s just gotten in the shower.”
“Yes,” Harry moaned. “More, Please,” he begged. Draco slid out of him and gently rolled him onto his stomach. Pulling him up to his knees, he spread his ass cheeks apart and slid back inside.
Draco was quiet for a moment as he looked down at his mother. After he had thought about it, he said, “I don’t know what it means to like him as more than a friend. I’ve never liked being around anyone this much.  I like spending time with him and he makes me laugh.”
“It’s time to get up,” Draco spoke clearly as he hit Harry with a pillow. “No lazing about when we have work to do.”
“This is so much more than I expected,” he mumbled into Draco’s shoulder. When he pulled away, his eyes were slightly damp, but he was beaming from ear to ear. “I didn’t even know that I had a family crest.”
“We didn’t do anything but sleep, Weasley,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Two people can share a bed without fucking like rabbits, you know.” He pulled his jumper over his head, pulling Harry into a quick hug, he asked, “Do you want to get breakfast before we go see Hagrid?”
He opened his eyes as he kicked off his shoes, glancing at Potter. He had a hunger in his eyes as he stared at Draco. His tongue poked out to trail along his bottom lip before he captured it between his teeth.
Once they were in Harry’s bed with the hangings closed, Harry turned to look at Draco. “Tonight was amazing,” he grinned. “I wish it could last longer though.”
He had to stop losing focus so easily. “Just thinking about something the Weasel said,” Draco shrugged. “Are you ready to go?” When Harry nodded, he held his arm out. Harry gripped it firmly and they apparated home. Bixby met them at the door and took their cloaks informing them that the drawing room was ready. Draco went in, picked up his scotch and stood before the mantle, glaring into the fireplace.
Blaise heard a mean snigger at the side and saw his friend's face screwed up into that ugly scowl he used to put on towards Potter through all their years together. "Scared to have a little drink, Potty?" Draco smirked. "Afraid of what it will get you to do? Don't worry. Have some more and thankfully you'll forget all about it."
"Certainly, Master. Very good, sir," Kreacher said and with the speed of an elf half his age, he jumped over to the gigantic stove at the far end of the kitchen and lit a roaring fire with a flick of his hand before he, with a crack, disappeared upstairs.
Professor Slughorn turned his back at the classroom and continued to speak, as he wrote a list of ingrediencies on the blackboard. "Please, if you could pair up to this assignment without too much shuffle, I would be most grateful. You will work with this potion for the rest of the term and the result will strongly affect your final grades in this class, so choose your partner wisely."
"It's not my fault you wasted your opportunity." Malfoy lifted his shot and clinked it against Harry's. "But drink up, Potter, and order us one more round." He banged down his empty glass. "Now, a real question." He wiggled his forefinger at Harry's face. "Why haven't you returned my wand? You said you would at the Wizengamot."
"If that's what you wish for, then that's what you get." She suddenly rose. "I'm sorry, Mr Potter, you'll have to excuse me. I'm very tired, I'm afraid." She took a step, but swayed slightly. With a crack Pipsey was at her side, holdig her arm in a steadying grip. "I'm going to lay down for a while, Draco. Make sure Mr Potter is comfortable for the rest of his stay here. We don't want him to find us inadequate in our hospitality." Then she left the room with her hand resting on the little elf's shoulder.
What had she meant by coming up to him in the library and ask if they could compare notes? Hermione Granger sure as hell had no need to be insecure about her ability to pay attention in class. Draco had been as obliging as he could, of course. He certainly didn't want there to be any rumours about him still being a prejudice prat, a condescending blood-supremist. Not anymore, not now that he had seen it for what it was, realized that what he'd been told was nothing more than a load of shit. It still hurt that he had been so easy to manipulate, so unaware of the world to follow so loyally. The shock when his eyes finally opened.
"All the rooms on the first and second floor are finished, all three bedrooms, and mine, of course, the bathroom and the living room." Harry made a gesture towards the upper landing before he begun decending the stairs back down. "There's still some work to be done in the dining room and the library. We haven't started on those yet, but…"
"It's called a credit-card. You can use it almost anywhere in the Muggle world and it's connected to my vault at Gringott's through some Muggle bank account. Bill, Ron's older brother, has been working on this for a while now to make it easier for people, like me, who only have Wizarding gold, to interact in the Muggle world. It helps building bridges for... erm… purebloods and such. It was Hermione's idea, of course."
She met his eyes again and hers were flooded with tears this time. She wiped them away with her other hand and gave him a shaky smile. "Being friends with you was never my problem, Harry. Friends we can be to the day we die."
The pull on her hair became too much. Hermione pushed him to lay on his back, so she could look him in the eyes. "We'll deal with the matter of Malfoy later. You've got a more pressing business to take care of before anything else. After you ran out, Pomfrey made an appointment for you at a Specialist-Healer at St Mungo's. It's next week. We'll both go with you, of course." She glanced over her shoulder at Ron, who gave a reassuring nod. "You'll have until then to decide what you want to do."
They'd decided to tell three people before the papers got out. Draco had to tell Astoria, anything else was downright cruel. And Harry needed to explain to his two best friends. He wasn't at all sure they would take it well.
A woman screamed, shrill and desperate, and Malfoy broke the eye-contact he had held with Harry all this time and put his arms around Narcissa Malfoy, who had collapsed on the floor.
"Probably," Harry groaned. "My feet hurt and my back hurt, and I think I broke my own reecord on how many times I had to pee today. And instead of a honeymoon, we'll have diapers and sceaming and sleep-deprivation, and all the mess that comes with a new-born."
"Zabini's in my Tranfiguration-class. He's an alright sort, I guess, Slytherins considered. Let's see where they are and ask them to help us, without giving away too much. Who knows what Malfoy will do when Harry walks in and starts a fight?"
Healer Smith shook his head. "I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure it has very little or none effect on your current situation. As I said, these things happen, and my advice to you is to go home and try again as soon as possible. Your magical core is now restored to what it was before the conception, Mr Potter, but I strongly recommend rest and a couple of weeks away from work. You are obviously compatible with Mr Malfoy, so it wouldn't take to long for you to get pregnant again, if you wish. Do you need more fertility potion or another insemination syringe?"
