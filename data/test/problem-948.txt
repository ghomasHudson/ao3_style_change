“You ok, Draco?” Blaise asked, interrupting Pansy’s verbal attack on them as soon as they appeared in the Common Room. The Malfoy was very pale and he was visibly shivering, wrapped up in Crabbe’s cloak as well as his own coat.
“I won’t, I promise… But I’ll do the work, ok? You just relax, I’ll look after you.” He said. Draco looked at him, stormy eyes wide, like he wasn’t able to believe what he was hearing. Harry smiled and kissed him deeply, rolling them over again so Draco was on his back. Harry grabbed a thick pillow and lifted Draco’s hips, placing the pillow beneath them so as not to strain his back. “Nice and gentle, ok?” he asked, genuinely wondering what Draco preferred, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck.
He'd got better at blocking him out, able to resist the Charm two or three times in a session now, but every time he felt his head invaded, the images were a jarring mixture of happiness and utter horror. Snape often had to call a stop himself, his own constitution unable to take seeing these things so very much, but a certain rage-fuelled protectiveness spurred him on. Harry frequently wanted to ask about the Unbreakable Vow, how he and Malfoy were connected by this magic, and how what had happened effected the teacher.
“Please… please…!” Draco begged when Harry finally released him, tears rolling down his cheeks, his breathing sounded almost panicked. His weak hands found Harry’s shoulders, fingers winding into the fabric of the shirt and pulling as hard as he could, only serving to wrinkle it. Harry stared down at him, looking into his eyes that were full of lust and fear, begging him to help. He leaned down and kissed at the wet tracks on his pale cheeks, pushing his hands under Draco’s back to hold him closer.
"You… fucking snivelling coward." Ron hissed. "You murdered innocent people to save your evil bastard self and your evil bastard parents." Draco's eyes, not wet, looked into Ron's.
, he thought with a dull sense of satisfaction that felt almost familiar, watching them both wincing and desperate for it to stop,
"It's ok, it's ok, just breathe." He said gently, sitting down on bed beside him, not too close. "Does this happen a lot?" He asked. Draco took a deep, trembling breath and nodded.
Blaise smiled fondly, sadly, and toed his own shoes off. He moved slowly to sit beside him, using the wall to sink down, and was conscious not to release the hiss that bubbled in his chest at the freezing temperature. Draco was shaking uncontrollably, and not just from the cold, tears lost in the water flowing over him. Blaise was warm beside him, the touch of their arms bringing him out of his head. One hand moved to his bicep, gripping weakly, and his cheek rested there on Blaise's sodden sleeve, his breathing becoming more and more audible as he let go. Blaise reached for Draco's other hand, holding his wrist gently, and brought it under his own arm to kiss his fingers. "Ok if I turn it up a bit?" He asked softly, after a few moments. Draco let out a shaky breath and nodded.
"That's ok, I'm glad everyone's enjoying it." Harry said with an easy smile, looking at the back cover of the novel Draco had delivered. "Did you like it?" He asked, looking back up at Draco, his green eyes and dark skin glowing in the fire light. Draco felt heat in his cheeks and put on his Malfoy mask, nodding.
“Jesus Christ, Draco…” he gasped. Draco looked distraught, like his world was crashing down around him, and Blaise couldn’t take it anymore. He moved forward and pulled Draco into a tight hug, rubbing his back. He was very tense for a moment, and Blaise thought he might try to struggle, but he soon began to relax, and then he was crying.
please shut up." Draco snapped, tired of Pansy and Blaise bickering. He had a headache and was feeling the beginnings of a cold coming. Pansy had been lusting over Heathcliff since she shyly borrowed the book Harry gave him as part of their plot. Draco had read the apparently famous Muggle novel… in one day and most of the night… and now it was quietly making its way around the Slytherin 6th years. Millicent hissed across the table at them to not give anything away and they finally stopped talking, eating breakfast and sending each other glares.
Harry watched as the head of his own erect cock pressed into Malfoy’s arse, slowly disappearing. It was instantly too tight, Malfoy letting out another, louder moan of pain as his unwilling body was forcefully penetrated. Harry let out a shuddering gasp as he was enveloped in the impossibly tight, impossibly hot passage. The Monster felt his pleasure as well, gripping Draco’s hips in a bruising vice, and slammed Harry completely inside his protesting body.
?" He demanded, utterly affronted. Harry looked at him and they had a silent arguement with their faces which eventually concluded in 'I'll tell you later', when Hermione chimed in to say Flitwick was unlocking the classroom.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other and almost smiled, each of them breathing some kind of sigh. Now, they might have a true advantage.
Draco just stared at him, grey eyes flitting between the two warm brown ones in an effort to locate a lie. Blaise just smiled gently, touched his tear-moistened finger under Draco's pointed thin to raise it an inch or so, and slowly pressed their lips together.
The logical part of her brain agreed, of course. They were neither prepared for nor familiar with a hostage situation. They didn't know what to do with Draco, what would be the smartest way to play their newly acquired advantage, if that's what it was. But they also didn't know what the Order would do to him, other than get any and all information out of him by any means necessary.
“What do you want from me?” he asked, an air of his usual arrogance in his voice as he glared at Harry, apparently he’d had enough of this humiliation. Harry grinned, or at least his Monster did.
Crabbe had Draco pinned to the wall, his hands completely swamping his chest, the blond boy clearly panicking. It was all too familiar, all too terrifying, and this time it was his friend.
They arrived at the familiar gargoyle and went up the winding stairway once the password was said, though Harry had no idea what it actually was. His heart was pounding in his ears so loudly he could barely hear their footsteps on the stone.
“L-let go of me…! You…you just...-?” Draco panted, his voice shaky and small. Harry stared at him, his own hands shaking, and blood rushing loudly in his ears. He felt something strange stirring in his chest though, a horrifying pleasure he’d never felt before.
Despite his lust filled mind, Harry was concerned, wrapping his arms around the very slender figure and attempting to remove himself from Draco if it was causing him pain. But Draco held Harry’s shoulder and pushed himself back to look into his eyes, tears rolling down his cheeks. His face was still pink, eyes still showing his body’s need, but he looked so sad. “Don’t stop, please…!” he begged, his voice hoarse with exhaustion and desperation. Harry stared at him, seeing how badly this curse affected him. He might have been enduring these feelings for days, and the physical strain this level of need had on him was obviously enormous. Harry shook his head, kissing the wet saltiness on his hot cheeks.
“Oh my God, how awful… Poor Draco!” she said, looking upset. “So, you think You-Know-Who cursed him to need to do these… things?” Harry nodded. “But why? For revenge?”
The Monster found the buckle on Harry’s belt, and began to undo it. As soon as he heard the clink of metal and rustle of fabric, Draco looked up, and was horrified to see Harry Potter’s erect cock standing proudly from his school trousers in front of his face. The Monster grabbed the blond’s hair again and tugged it hard until he moved forward and up, positioning him perfectly for what it wanted.
Hermione went with him most days, sitting quietly in the corner to observe and help if needed. Snape had sneered at her pressence at first, when she said she was there for moral support, but thankfully it had made him far less outwardly cruel towards Harry. Whenever Harry freaked out over not being able to block the spell, Hermione was apt at calming him down and getting him back on track. Encouraging and hard-nosed at times, she made the sessions easier for everyone and Snape eventually started greeting her more civilly.
Once this pitcher was empty, and the group of Slytherins were a little drunk, the Monster began to put its plan into action.
Draco looked around, holding the bedsheets up to his chest shyly. Harry understood and picked up a shirt from the floor, passing it to him. Draco took it hesitantly, thanking him, and pulled it on. He did up all the buttons before standing up, the shirt reaching his mid thighs so he was fully covered, but pulled his underwear on too. He went round the bed to join Harry, half-heartedly looking through the items on his side.
"I'll look after him, I promise." Harry told the Slytherins, then dug in Draco's pocket, apologising when it made him twitch and shiver, and produced the Protean-charmed sickle coin.
He grabbed his invisibility cloak and left the Common Room, not even bothering to tell his friend’s where he was off to. He found himself running towards Malfoy and his unusual posse, watching his own footsteps approaching theirs on the Map he didn't even think to hide, when suddenly, the group of footsteps vanished from the map. Harry stopped in his tracks, staring down at the enchanted parchment in utter confusion. Then he realised...the Room of Requirement! Of course, the Room was perfect for any Death Eaters’ plans go become a reality.
"Morning." Draco said, stiffly, clearing his throat and shoving the book he'd been clutching at Harry. "I'm afraid my friends have taken ownership of the Brontë." He said, glancing around to see most of the room either openly, or slightly less than openly, staring at them.
I'm not necessarily a Draco Malfoy apologist; he was simply brought up to believe something wrong and, as in canon, realises the error of his ways. The abuse in this fic is more about the evil of the fascist side he was born into, his parents endangering him by supporting it, rather than his own beliefs which will be addressed later. I acknowledge, as do the characters, that he was shitty, but that doesn't mean he deserves what this story portrays.
“Ok, night.” Harry said without really thinking. Draco glared in the vague direction of Harry’s invisible form, and marched off to his dormitory, wearing a huge robe, and barefooted. Harry smirked, and went back up to his own bed in Gryffindor tower.
“Come, Harry, I’m sure you’re eager to leave this room.” He said warmly, and Harry let out a breath and nodded.
“Coriumtersus.” the Monster said, moving Harry’s wand over Draco, his skin instantly becoming dry and clean, releasing the ropes around his thin wrists as well. “Internumtersus.” Draco’s breath hitched, his unfocussed eyes widening slightly, twitching and shivering at the feeling as his insides followed suit. The Monster then cast another spell, some kind of revitalising charm, and Draco seemed to regain his senses, and some of his strength. He pulled away from Harry and stood up slowly, leaning fully against the wall as he pulled up his trousers. He was looking at the floor where he’d been lying previously, where his incorporeal rapist still knelt.
Blaise had visited a lot, becoming slowly more comfortable with spending time in the house after so much darkness dwelled within its walls. It had been oppressive at first, the air itself heavy with old magic and pain. Draco had suffered horribly, he knew that, but he'd been truly shocked to see how much his friend was changed. Thin and sickly, he was
Blaise hadn't really been involved in the War, he had no allegiances either way, but his life had been deeply affected just as everyone's had, even without his relationship with Draco. Harry understood the need for territory, something secure to claim in a world of so much loss that was still rebuilding.
“My duty, Potter. Honestly, you really are stupid.” He said. His insults were barely there, but Harry was too angry to care, incensed just by Malfoy’s arrogant smirk and nonchalant stance.
Everything was as he'd expected. This happened so often, it was almost a strange, sad tradition in their house. Draco's ankle boots were neatly placed to the left of the rug and there was a blurry shape of black, white and gold behind the water-flecked glass. Blaise placed the pile of clean clothes on one of the empty shelves and removed his dragon skin jacket before opening the shower door.
Someone in the comments brought up that Hermione, as a Muggleborn, would never be kind to Draco, who was part of the oppressive force against her 'kind' but I counter this because Hermione is, at her core, a good person and would see Draco as a victim of his circumstance.
Came the shockingly casual response, though the voice wavered badly. It sounded like Draco, but more how your own voice sounds when you speak, the sound reverberating in each of their skulls.
“My list. It's called ‘Reasons to Kill Voldemort’.” He said with a chuckle. Draco's expression seemed to go through every possible emotion in the space of a few seconds, then he let out a small laugh, gripping the bedpost tightly.
Draco sat up as they kissed, one hand on Harry’s chest while the other reached behind himself to grip Harry’s already rehardening cock. Harry’s mouth followed the blond’s, leaning up on his elbows to keep the connection, moving one of his hands from Draco’s hole to grip his insatiably hard cock. It must be painful, he thought, judging from how Draco flinched at the contact even as he bucked into the touch.
“When I was about 14, it was her husband at the time. She...she got really depressed and didn’t want to do anything, like just being alive was hard enough but...she got through it. I helped her as best I could, it...scared me to see her like that. She started going to a doctor, a muggle one where you just talk - it sounds stupid but she got better, eventually. She still hated him, always will, and so will I. But she got past it, it got a lot better… He’s dead.” He said matter-of-factly. He never went into much detail as to what happened to all his stepfathers, but that was enough to explain it for now. “Obviously don't follow that example.” He said, trying to chuckle but mostly failing. Draco stared at him through the barest of light, his mind blank.
Harry woke up very early in the morning, before Draco, feeling surprisingly refreshed and happy. He’d never really woken up beside anyone before, except Ron, and on one occasion when he and Dudley had been forced to share a bed...but never like this.
"Yeah… yeah. After everything ended, I finally received a letter from Snape's last will and testament. He left everything to me, which wasn't a huge amount but… he left me all of his research. His Potions work was
"And is he manipulating you? Or are you manipulating him, Potter?" she asked, bluntly. He always admired her for that.
“Yeah, I think I'm getting better at it.” He said stiffly. He still felt awkward around Dumbledore, still considering the old man's kindness and patience with him, even after everything he must have witnessed through the Penseive. It was verging on napotistic, and decidedly undeserved.
“In...in is harder…” Draco said in barely a whispered, the inhale shakier. Blaise nodded, pointing to his own nose as he, himself, breathed in through it. Draco copied, watching the way his friend's nostrils seemed to close slightly as he inhaled, then flare as he breathed out through his mouth.
"Yeah, I guess you could say that. We got talking about books and… I guess it just kind of happened naturally." He said, shrugging casually. Her feline eyes narrowed, scrutinizing his face a moment before her mouth became a thin line.
“There are some plates there…” Draco said and Harry looked over at him. He was pointing to the table by the wall, where two covered plates were sat, as well as a flagon of hot tea, and a jug of cold orange juice.
“Yeah, I definitely get that…” he said with a sigh, thinking of all the things he’d put his own friends through over the years. “So…it has to be sex? Have you tried…blowjobs? If it’s just cum it might-” but Draco was shaking his head.
“I…I really liked it with you…” he said. Draco looked at him, silver eyes wide. “I mean…it was my first time, so I have no frame of reference to compare it to,” he laughed nervously, realising that was too many words, and took a breath, “but it was…incredible.” Draco seemed to wince at the admission, though he seemed to have known because he didn’t comment, just nodded slightly, before sighing deeply.
“Maybe he’s talking to Snape… Or he’s just given up on eating altogether…” Blaise muttered, an edge to his voice. He was sure Pansy was just being paranoid about Draco, but he did eat his dinner much quicker than he usually would. He finished within moments of Potter appearing, and got up. Pansy stood too, wrapping some hot roast potatoes in a clean napkin for Draco if he was hungry. They left together, heading downstairs to their Common Room.
“Just…just cold. Let’s go.” He said shortly, fixing his coat and hair quickly. Crabbe nodded and they left together, Harry following closely. The wind had picked up in lieu of the heavy snow, almost pushing Draco clean over. Crabbe grabbed his arm when he started to wane, frowning at him.
Ron and Hermione followed Harry over to the far right of the Great Hall, doing their best to seem nonchalant about this bizarre turn of events. He sat down, confidently, beside Draco, while his friends took the bench opposite. The usual whispering started up again, but they became exclamations when Harry smiled and leaned into Draco to kiss his cheek.
quite high, to be honest…” Draco glared at him for a moment, slowly realising that all he was wearing was Gryffindor robes and where he was. His expression cleared slightly as he began to recall the events, but still looked at Harry with suspicion.
He looked over at the Slytherin table as he entered, spotting Blaise and Pansy looking at him, both looking confused. He put his head down and went to join his friends, pretending everything was fine.
“Will you really go back to asking those 7th years? They treat you so badly...” he said softly. Draco glared at him then, looking very Malfoy for a moment.
to spend time with you, mad as that sounds…” he said, adding the last part almost to himself. Draco frowned at him. “Anyway, its bloody Christmas,  you're supposed to spend it with people you'd rather not spend time with.” he sighed, then grinned. “There's a chess set here, if you fancy it?” he asked with a chuckle, pulling a large box out from under the coffee table. Draco sighed dramatically and returned to sit down, crossing his legs and glaring at Potter.
"Next time you have a nightmare...get into bed with me. You'll be warm, and we can talk about it...or not, it's up to you. But just know you're...more than welcome." He said with a smile. Draco looked at him, taken aback by the invitation but mostly surprised by how inviting it sounded. Waking up with only his mind to tell him he was safe was awful, always doubting himself in the aftershocks of horrific nightmares that felt so real it made him want to scream even hours later.
“I’ll be there for you, if that happens...we'll help you.” Blaise promised, his big brown eyes showing nothing but genuine kindness. Draco smiled weakly and nodded, turning his attention back to the chess board, ready for the next game. Blaise patted his friend’s knee before taking his first move.
Blaise ate breakfast with Pansy, who seemed angry at the rumours but angrier at Blaise for making such a big thing about it.
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat, stunned for a moment. Had he actually gone insane? A part of him hoped so, maybe he’d imagined hurting Draco.
He was surprised to the find the room much smaller than usual, about the size of his dormitory. A fire was crackling merrily in the hearth beneath a carved mantelpiece, adorned with roses and thorns, and there was a thick rug on the stone floor basking in the warm orange glow. Two large sofas lined one corner of the rug, the well-stuffed pillows facing the flames like sunflowers.
“We did talk, yeah. You told me some...disturbing stuff… You cried until you fell asleep and…I suppose I didn’t want to, you know, leave…” he told him honestly. “I ended up falling asleep too…and here we are.” Draco seemed to be having a personal battle in his own head, frowning slightly at Harry, then he sighed deeply.
“W-what are you…going to do to about…him…?” Draco asked shakily, glancing at Crabbe. The Monster purred softly, making Harry stand up and gently brush Draco’s cheek, which made him flinch away like he’d been burned, barely containing a scream. Then Harry walked over to Crabbe, waved his wand to put Crabbe’s cock back into his trousers, and then the Monster cast an unfamiliar spell.
Draco shook his head, his steely eyes closing slowly. Harry thought he’d fallen asleep for a moment, then the space between the thin eyebrows creased.
"Did they hurt you? Try to hurt you?" Harry asked, frowning in concern rather than impatience now. Draco cleared his throat, looked around the room and, instantly, a pitcher of water and two glasses appeared. He let out a soft 'ah' before carefully pouring them each a glass, sipping his own and avoiding Harry's eye. He took a breath before replying, holding the glass in both hands.
“Do what?” Blaise asked, taking a very slow step closer and hoping Draco was too self absorbed at this current moment to notice.
The pub was warm and fairly crowded with students, teachers and villagers alike. Harry felt himself skulk between tables and people, his Seeker eyes searching for the white blond hair of the Monster’s target, his Golden Snitch.
Blaise felt the sting of that on Draco's behalf, knowing what those memories did to him every day. He looked at Draco to see his eyes wide and pooling tears, the tendons in his jaw tensed and grinding. Blaise was about to place a hand on his arm when he stood up suddenly, walking quickly towards the door out of the Common Room. Blaise swore and followed him, leaving Pansy and Goyle to reassure Crabbe that it wasn't his fault.
"Will you be able to get all the way upstairs like this?" Harry asked Draco as they remained huddled together. He took a deep, shaking breath and nodded, pointing towards a tapestry.
"Brilliant!" He said, grinning so much Draco laughed a little too, his cheeks feeling hot. "I'll give you
“Draco, I’m going to help you.” He said, making Draco jump and turn, leaning heavily against the wall. He studied Harry for a moment, as if assessing the threat, but sighed and nodded. He was totally exhausted, obviously, and needed to sleep. Harry moved over to him, and pulled Draco’s arm around his own shoulders, wrapping his own arm around his waist. Draco tensed at the contact, his jaw tight at their closeness, but didn’t say a word. They made their slow way to the Slytherin Common Room, both hoping everyone would be at dinner.
“Pansy probably knows what to get your mother more than I do…” Draco was saying, clearly a bit put out at being forced back into the cold, pulling on his gloves.
“Morning… Uh, this…” Harry said, handing Draco the note despite him looking half asleep. Draco yawned and read the note slowly, frowning slightly in concentration. Then he looked at Harry, eyes wide with realisation. “Don’t worry, he won’t tell anyone. None of them will.” Harry said quickly, though he was fairly sure Draco was more vexed by the fact they were here together in the first place. “Your Christmas presents are here, by the way.” He said, looking through his own gifts. There was a big soft parcel from Mrs Weasley, an obvious book from Hermione, a smaller, hard box from Ron, and assorted others from Order members and friends. Draco’s pile was rather smaller than Harry’s, though he suspected the gifts would be more expensive than his own haul.
Monday's handoff of Emily Brontë's only published novel was met with a myriad of confused and shocked looks, plenty of whispering and good dash of personal offence from Ron. They'd arrived before Flitwick, everyone waiting outside the classroom, leaning against walls and talking in small groups as teenagers are wont to do.
His arms were wrapped around Draco’s waist, their bodies close and warm. He would have been aroused if it hadn’t been for his knowledge of Draco’s sexual past, and how much pain it caused the Malfoy boy. Learning about what he’d been through with Voldemort, of
They had been delighted to see Harry, and had soothed him and made gentle jokes as he sobbed, wishing to jump through the frame and hug them both. It was a shame no-one had ever painted a portrait of his parents. They had more modern photos, Lily being muggle-born, but they didn't contain their essence the way portraits did. Harry supposed it was for the best. The men he'd come to think of as beloved uncles,
do, like how the Cruciatus curse can make people go insane, for example. It depends on the spell. Why do you ask?” He shrugged, trying to look casual as he sat back in his chair.
“Draco?” Harry's soft voice asked, and he returned to the world with a small jolt. He was sitting on the mattress, the fire crackling behind Potter and making his hair look even wilder.
“My office, Harry. We wish to speak to you about the situation before sending you back to your dormitory.” He said. Harry frowned.
“I know, it’s ok. You can push me off if you want, I don’t mind.” The black boy said with a chuckle, very pleased when a small smile graced Draco's solemn face. He sat down on the bed beside his friend, taking a deep breath, before lying back beside him. Blaise could feel how tense he was, worsening when Blaise himself rolled onto his side to face Draco and gently laid one hand over the younger boy's chest. His heart was racing, his breathing short as if he would start panicking at any moment.
“Harry…please…” he whispered, his voice hoarse from the spell and intrusion, his pale face tear-stained and pink with emotion.
“POTTER!” Blaise shouted, and all the chattering and milling about stopped, like time had ceased passing. Lots of people turned to see who had shouted and a confused, excited chatter recommenced, until Harry replied.
“No, it’s ok.” Crabbe said, putting a large hand on Draco’s shoulder to usher him out of the pub. Pansy looked annoyed, but sat back down, drinking her beverage. Blaise and Goyle looked confused, but the Monster didn’t care as it made Harry get up and follow their victims.
He didn't look up when the door burst open, though the others did. The smell of earth and blood hit Harry before his brain could put the image into a word.
When light suddenly flooded into the room, Harry jumped and stood up in defence, reaching for the wand he did not currently possess. The sunlight was blinding and he had to shield his eyes, trying to see who the shadow looming forwards belonged to.
Nut whatevers' would be a nightmare in my house." Hermione and Harry looked at each other and laughed, Dean joining in, while the others discussed their preferred before-dinner or midnight snacks in further detail.
“Draco… do you want me to…?” he asked stupidly. The grey eyes that looked like liquid silver, molten and glowing, opened to look at him. The shuddering pants were almost sobs at this point, he looked half imploring, half distraught.
“Come with me.” She said, grabbing his hand and pulling him back along the corridor. She stopped at the Fat Lady, telling Harry to wait there while she said the password and went back in. He stood there, fighting the anger in his belly at being left, she was probably avoiding being with him, sick of his whining and- Red hair appeared through the portrait, not Ginny, thank Merlin, but Ron! He looked worriedly at Harry. He was holding a bottle of Firewhiskey, about a third of it gone, and he was a bit bleary-eyed and swayed slightly on his feet as he stepped through.
“L-Lubrico…” he muttered, jerking his wrist, and a jet of clear, slick-looking liquid spurted from the tip of Draco’s wand, covering his twitching hole. Harry stared in awe, his mouth slightly agape.
“Why didn’t you wait inside…?” Blaise asked Crabbe accusingly, putting his arm around Draco, who looked like he might faint, and sat him down on the sofa right by the fire. It took every ounce of willpower Draco had not to wince as he sank into the soft cushions. Pansy handed over one of the numerous blankets they had in the Common Room, since the dungeons got so cold, and Blaise replaced Crabbe’s cloak with it so he was, at least, dry. “Give me your hands…” he said, and Draco obeyed. Blaise pulled off his gloves and placed his wand just above both his palms. “Calidumus.” He said, and Draco’s frozen hands and down his bruised, hidden arms surged with comforting heat, making him smile weakly in thanks. Even so, he continued to tremble, his strength completely gone from the walk back, which worried his friends.
actually forgotten, using the balustrade to lean on. She cast a quick ink-drying charm on it with a wave of her hand and stowed it all away again, nodding once. They were alone again by then, so she replied softly.
. Hermione bit her lip, looking like she might cry. “When I kill Voldemort… I’ll do it for Draco now too.” He said. She looked at him and smiled, nodding.
"Draco." She said, but he only moved enough to see her. "Do you still believe that non-magical people, or wizards with non-magical blood, are inferior to pure-blooded wizards?" She asked, calmly. He stared at her, then glanced at Ron and Harry who were frozen in a half-wrestling stance. Draco slowly lowered his arms, and took a deep breath.
"They never really went away…" he said after a few minutes of counting breaths and soothing his aching lungs. Blaise looked at him sadly, but it was so nice to know he was listening. His mother didn't, it was too hard for her. "They've, um, got worse." He said, feeling stupid because obviously they had. And they were awful before. Blaise just nodded, and extended a hand towards him. Draco stared it for a moment, at the open palm he remembered being so warm, how nice it felt on his lower back or shoulder, and took it. It was the first pleasant human touch he could remember feeling in a long time, before the war even, and he smiled gratefully at Blaise when he squeezed gently.
"Tell your mother first then. She can handle Lucius and… and the others. Speak to Potter, tell your mother, and
Blaise came up beside him, one hand on his back. Draco jumped away from him, whipping around and looking at him with wide eyes. He relaxed when he saw it was Blaise and immediately broke down, his crying voice echoing in the vast Entrance Hall. Blaise didn't go any closer to him, staying a good foot from him as Draco backed away,  that old look of lost terror on his face.
He wished he could do something to help his situation. If only he was a better wizard... He wondered if even Dumbledore would be able to erase Voldemort's curse. Harry let out a sigh of frustration and headed into dinner.
"I think… anyone is capable of terrible things. No-one is better or worse because of their blood, it's…" his hands curled against his own chest, half protecting and half clawing at himself. "it's their souls that are bad." He said, head down. "It's got nothing to do with magic." He finished in barely more than a whisper.
If he'd known Potter would affect Draco so badly, Blaise would have insisted they leave the moment they saw him. When Draco invited Harry to sit with them, Blaise had been shocked, of course, but also proud. The man he loved was strong,
Hermione was watching their… whatever he was - captive, prisoner, bizarre new ally - intensely, wanting to hear him say what she suspected happened. A small part of her wanted to hear it, in detail, so she could put the niggling hatred away for good. He had
Blaise gave Draco the wet cloth to dab at his overheating face, it had a good illusion of trying to mop at the rainwater covering them all, they all did the same with dry items. The soggy supper-goers quickly dispersed to their Common Rooms, complaining about the ceiling's unpredictable whims, leaving them to drip in the Entrance Hall. The teachers, those not trying to fix the ceiling, swept past too, miserably casting drying spells over the floor and themselves.
He pushed in all the way, his wand releasing the Silence Spell on Draco without Harry’s knowledge. Draco let out a muffled scream as the cock went down his throat, cutting off his air and making him choke, sending exquisite vibrations along the cock in his mouth. His fingernails dug into Harry’s thighs, struggling against the grip on his hair in vain. Harry moaned, staying there for a good few moments before pulling out completely. He released Draco’s hair and he collapsed, gasping for air and coughing desperately.
Draco sat, hunched and waifish on the sofa, still half-draped in a blanket someone had laid upon him while he was sleeping - he suspected Potter - and considered his options.
"Yeah. Sounds good." He said. Then, awkwardly, they finished their breakfasts and parted, Harry and Draco pretending they didn't keep glancing at each other constantly. Draco felt hot for the rest of the day, admitting to himself that he did, indeed, find Harry quite attractive.
"Thank you, Potter. Carry on with what you were doing, I shall see you tomorrow." She said, turning on her heel and walking away down the stairs. He took a deep breath, feeling quite relieved he had someone of power on his side now too. He trusted Snape, more or less, but it felt good to have McGonagall in the know. He'd have to tell Draco, though, that would be fun…
“No, Potter…don’t go…” he said softly, blushing a very delicate pink. Harry faltered for a moment, surprised and delighted.
“Harry...don’t…-” he tried to beg again but the Monster grabbed his neck from behind, Harry’s fingers bruising the slender throat. “Please…!” Draco begged, but the Monster just laughed in Harry’s head. It moved Harry’s cock down to nestle between Draco’s thin thighs, rocking his hips again slowly, building up the sensation for himself. He could feel the heaviness of Draco’s balls as he pressed up against them, the warmth they held feeling wonderful.
He closed the distance between them and, without a word, slashed Draco across the chest with his clawed hand, ripping his clothes to shreds. All three of the on-lookers gasped in phantom pain, feeling as though their own flesh was tearing.
He followed Snape into his office and sat down at the desk when he was told to. He looked at all the lined up stuff on the desk, Snape going around to sit down on his chair. The professor put his elbows on the table, hands together in front of him, his eyes on Crabbe.
“Well, it’s only 5 o’clock…we could sleep a bit more…” Draco looked at him for a moment, possibly tempted, then shook his head.
“Draco…I’m sorry..! I’m so, so sorry! It w-wasn’t me… S-something was in my head, made me do those things…” his voice shaking with grief. “Please…l-let me help you… I’ll take you to the Hospital W-”
Harry had never seen Malfoy so…vulnerable. He didn’t have any witty, snake-tongued comments, no insults to hurl at him… It was like he’d lost all of his fight…and Harry didn’t like that. “Do you need anything? I can run and get Madam Pomfrey if you’re hurt-” Draco glared up at him, eyes flashing like steel.
“Not sure… But Potter’s underage…” he said, thinking hard. “He said something made him do it…something took over his mind and made him hurt Draco…” he said. Goyle let out a humourless laugh, shaking his head as if to say ‘yeah, right’. Blaise didn’t know what to think about any of it, all he cared about was that his friend had been hurt. “Night…” he said, lying back down, and Goyle replied the same.
“Was that your first time?” Harry asked, surprised Malfoy was being so honest, but he assumed maybe it was a side effect of whatever those bastards had given him to make him so compliant. He felt guilty, taking advantage of him after he was clearly drugged, but what other chance would he get?
Harry thought, amazed and very aroused. It almost felt primal, like a dog reacting to a bitch in heat, it was so natural and yet so cruelly unnatural. He removed Draco’s shoes, socks, trousers and pants, discarding them onto the floor.
After another couple of hours, Harry heard Draco stand up and walk past him into Snape’s office. Harry found his feet following him, his Monster stirring in his chest again, his own thoughts becoming fuzzy. He heard the bathroom door close as Draco went in, and his Monster compelled him to methodically move everything off the surface of Snape’s desk, carefully placing each item on the table behind it, memorising the original layout. He waited patiently for the Draco to return, leaning against the wall beside the bathroom door.
“What about us?” Blaise asked, letting himself feel hurt at that statement. He knew Draco wasn't thinking straight, his feelings marred by illness, a sickness of the mind, but it still
“Let me go, Potter!” he shouted, kicking him. His foot found Harry’s kneecap, making him cry out and stumble. Draco wriggled from his distracted grip, and started darting away, but Harry had his wand in his hand before he got four paces away, his blood on fire with sudden coursing rage.
“They’re cold and dark.” He said simply, combing his ruffled hair back with his fingers, trying to retain some dignity, and looking almost his usual self. “Crabbe and Mott both snore like a dragon with a head cold…” he muttered, surprising Harry with his honesty.
The next day, Blaise woke up the most comfortable he'd felt since he didn't even know when. He was warm and surrounded by softness. He stretched himself, his toes finding the cool parts of the sheet, then became aware of the person lying beside him. He cracked his eyes open blearily, finding the pale, delicate features of Draco before him. It took him a moment to recall the events of the previous night, looking over the peaceful expression on Draco's always so sombre face, then smiled. He'd stayed the whole rest of the night, presumably sleeping through. Carefully, so as not to wake his sleeping friend, Blaise reached for his watch, vaguely reminded of the previous night, and found the hour to be almost 8am. It was Sunday, so they could sleep in if they wanted to, and Blaise couldn't think of anything better than going back to sleep, pulling Draco's warm waist closer as he closed his eyes again.
“I...I hope you win, Potter, really I do.” the blond boy said weakly, his eyes stinging so he closed them. Harry stood up quickly, going over to him. He put a hand on his waist in case he fainted, he'd suddenly gone so wobbly.
He put his wand away, and approached the Malfoy boy, who was trying to get up, away. He was panting harshly, his body trembling too badly for his arms and legs to support him. He collapsed again, making a small whimpering sound as Harry got closer. Harry stood over him for a moment, before kneeling beside him. He pushed Draco onto his back, pinning his wrists to the floor. Draco’s face was paler than usual, the blood completely drained away, and he looked terrified. There were tears in his eyes, weakly trying to get his arms out of Harry’s grip. Harry remembered when Bellatrix Lestrange had used the Cruciatus curse on him, how he’d felt like all his strength was gone, how helpless he’d felt, and the agony.
He took a deep breath, and spoke again. "I- I tested it on the people the Snatchers brought in. The Death Eaters thought it was poison but it was modified wolfsbane, of sorts. I wanted to know the effects, if it protected them. It worked well, they even said it made them feel better, but… they never lived very long once Greyback got hold of them. The point was: those he didn't kill, didn't turn." He admitted this new insight in a torrent, like he just wanted it out. "I started taking it myself whenever he-" Draco's voice caught, his breath hitching and gasping out of him. Harry's body reacted before his mind could tell it not to, moving to sit on the Draco, leaving a cushion between them for his comfort.
It was Sunday, so they went to visit Draco, taking his homework along in case he wanted something to do. He was sitting up in bed when they arrived, looking pale but his bruises were pretty much gone and he didn’t seem to be in too much pain. He was eating a piece of toast, which they were very glad to see.
"I think we should take Malfoy to the Order." He said finally, face thin with determination. Harry frowned, confused, and Hermione started nibbling her fingernails.
“Potter! Malfoy!” a voice behind them snapped, making them both jump and turn to look at the door. Snape stood there, looking angrily from the broken glass and spilled truffles, which, even in the wizarding world, were expensive, and the two boys. “Detention, both of you. Come back here on Saturday and take an inventory of all ingredients. And clean that up.” He snarled, sweeping away again. Harry let out the breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding, and looked back at Draco. He heart hurt, but his Monster wriggled happily.
Blaise made his sneaking way upstairs, avoiding any sounds or slight glow that connoted the presence of a spirit, and finally made it up to his destination, passing Boris the Bewildered's statue, the stone man jumping slightly at his voice when he said the password. The door opened and Blaise went in slowly, suddenly concerned about what he may find beyond.
“Fine…” he muttered. They both smiled and Blaise helped Draco stand up, further enraged by how weak and damaged his friend was. It was still dinner so the hallways would be more or less empty, so they headed up to the first floor. Draco struggled with the stairs, but Pansy and Blaise were a strong presences beside him, and he felt stronger knowing it would be over now.
Ron and Hermione had questioned him mercilessly about the day he came back, practically in a fugue state as he wandered dazedly through the Common Room, but he’d lied and said he’d fallen asleep in the library after Snape’s Occlumency lesson, so he’d felt weird when he woke up. Luckily, Hermione did some research over the weekend, looking into the psychological side effects of Occlumency and, found it can cause confusion and unusual sleeping patterns, so his lie was questioned no further.
“No…n-no, I can’t… They’ll s-send an owl to my parents, my father will never-” he felt himself panicking the same time Pansy realised it. She grabbed his face, making him look into her eyes.
They fell silent again, each one mulling over his own thoughts. Then Harry looked up to see Ginny walking into the pub, still dressed in her Quidditch gear, and looking around for him as she strode confidently to the bar.
"Good night, Blaise." He said, slightly muffled. Blaise huffed a laugh, hesitantly wrapping an arm around Draco. It was exquisitely warm beside his friend, sharing the green quilt and soft mattress. Running his other hand through Draco's slightly damp hair, his arm beneath his own head, Blaise kissed the soft mop of white blond and settled himself down. He dropped off within minutes, and neither of them dreamed a thing.
"We'll go tomorrow." He said, before leaving the room. Luna excused herself as well, rather overwhelmed by the proceedings, but not without taking Draco's hand and squeezing it gently. Such a small gesture, but it warmed him.
“There you are, Draco!” Pansy called from down the corridor a little way off. He turned to look at her, and was immediately reassured when he saw she was regarding at his company with anger, already holding her wand. He could always trust her to see when he truly needed help.
me what I can't do.” He hissed, then seemed to forget his anger, the terror and sadness returning. “I-if they were gone...I would be free...” he raised his wand and Blaise instinctively put up his own hands, palms out, to show he wasn't going to hurt him. It was worse when Draco turned the wand on himself. Blaise wanted to leap forward, wrestle the wand from him, but he feared what Draco may do to himself if he was startled.
He and Pansy sat down at Pomfrey’s desk, silently waiting. There were murmurings from behind the curtain, it sounded like they were asking Draco questions, but his replied were too soft to hear.
Again, please be nice to each other in the comments, and thank you to everyone who's been so supportive, you've been brilliant and I appreciate you!
He stood up unsteadily, shuffling his way around the bed and into the small amount of floor space. There was a bookcase against one wall, the contents looked dusty and untouched, and an old over-stuffed settee with obvious signs of moth damage. The room itself didn’t smell unpleasant, as the aging interior would suggest, and Harry found this suspicious. He walked over to the bookcase, reaching out and fully expecting his hand to phases through the facade of books. When his knuckles came in contact with the hard leather spines, he grunted and belligerently grabbed one before going over to the sofa to sit down heavily. He knew they were keeping him here go isolate him while they decided what to do about everything.
The Monster made Harry’s face grin, and grab a fistful of Draco’s hair to pull him away from Crabbe. Draco made an almost whiny noise, trying to hold onto his friend’s cloak, like it would stop it hurting.
They walked out of the room together, Harry quickly noticing the tapestry on the wall opposite. Trolls in tutus, Barnabas the Balmy. He’d been in the Room of Requirement this whole time?
“I wasn’t mistreated. Don’t you understand? I wanted this.” He said, but his eyes betrayed him. Harry looked at him a moment, then sighed.
Time passed normally after that, although Harry certainly took more notice of Draco now. He looked sad sometimes, when he wasn’t engaged in conversation or studying, and his friends certainly seemed to care about him which was good to see. Whenever the Malfoy boy looked a little off, one of his friends would gently touch his shoulder and speak to him softly, to which he would smile and nod, his mask of normality sliding into place.
“You alright?” he asked him. Draco nodded, trying to smile at him gratefully, and they rejoined Pansy, who asked the same question. He just nodded, letting out a sigh. She smiled sadly and linked their arms together as they headed for the library.
"Malfoy?" He asked, holding the sandwiches and feeling like an idiot. Draco's gaze dropped to the plate, then back up to Harry's face.
“Damn, I needed that.” One was saying with a grin, making the others laugh, rowdily agreeing and adding.
Now, the Gryffindor team and their army of groupies were barrelling into the library, cheering and waving flags, obviously on their way up to their Common Room. Blaise cursed them under his breath, muttering 'why do they have to come in here?'. Draco was staring over at them as they laughed and cheered, so much red and gold it was nauseating. He thought he felt his old anti-Gryffindor hatred rather than anything deeper, regarding their stupidity and loudness with a hint of superiority, until he saw Potter.
Harry watched memory-Draco grip the book he was trying, and failing, to read. A thought entered his head, in Draco's voice: 'they must have had a bad night…', and he felt their shared heart sink. The 'they', he somehow knew, meant the Snatchers. And Greyback.
"Yeah… like, um, small talk…?" He offered, wondering if it was somehow a Muggle word. Draco glowered at him.
He was awoken by voices, laughing and jeering, and opened his eyes to see the wall opposite him, where the bricks were usually all there was, had become an ornate doorway, and several 7th year boys were filing through it.
Harry was just walking back from Christmas Eve dinner, intending to grab a book to read before bed, when he noticed someone leaning against the wall a little way along the library corridor, sort of hunched over like they were in pain. Being who he was, Harry went over to them, hoping nothing was seriously wrong. As he got closer, he saw it was a boy, and he was shaking terribly, his pale hand tense on the cold stone. Harry glanced around, seeing they were alone in the hallway, the castle being practically empty at the moment.
“Ok, yeah… I probably should too. Listen, um...I really had fun today, with you. It was good.” Harry said, feeling incredibly awkward but needing to tell him. Draco looked at him with slightly blank expression, then nodded slowly.
Thank you so much for reading and sticking with this story all the way to the end. I hope you've enjoyed it, and thank you for your amazing feedback and support! Please leave a comment, and kudos if you haven't already, stay safe and remember - there is always a dawn. 💕
“Are you alright?” he asked Draco, his voice soft. Draco looked between them, struggling with all the words bubbling in his chest.
“Draco…he hurt you today…? In your detention?” Blaise asked, and they both looked at him. He nodded, looking down, pushing up his right sleeve to show the newly forming bruises around his fragile-looking wrist. The black boy growled, his expression one of seething rage, and he stood up. “We’re taking you to Pomfrey, come on.” He said decisively. Draco looked up at him, eye wide with fear as he tried to shake his head.
“Stop trying to fight me.” The Monster hissed, Harry’s voice high and chilling even to his own ears. Draco stopped at once, his whole body freezing, rigid with fear. Harry’s hand unbuckled Draco’s belt and undid his trousers, pushing them down along with his pants. The blond boy choked back a sob when he felt his shirt pushed up his back and the hot hardness press itself between his cheeks, his shoulders so tense they were shaking.
side, and only now that his family isn't useful he's paying the price for that brutality. Brainwashed by them, then abused by them.
Blaise Zabini comforts Draco Malfoy after a run-in with Harry Potter, sitting fully clothed in the (frankly, very extra) shower at their new flat in London. Angst, crying, cuddling, all those good things.
The wand tip was pressing hard into his own temple, tears rolled down his pale face. “I've looked it up. I
“Draco told me, Potter. He told me everything.” He saw a flash of fear in Harry’s eyes, the looks of confusion on his friends’, and everyone else’s, faces. “You’re not getting away with it!” Blaise snarled, pulling out his wand. Instantly, Potter, Granger and Weasley all had their own wands pointing right at him.
He placed it on Pansy's palm, then found his own 10p and squeezed it. She frowned at the vibrating coin in her hand, and Harry smiled. "If you feel that, come back here and get him. Hopefully you won't need to, but just in case. I'll try to have him back in bed before breakfast tomorrow." He said. Pansy nodded, pocketing the coin, then patted Blaise's shoulder to rouse him. He reluctantly pulled himself away from Draco, who was whimpering, kissing his forehead with care.
Draco hugged Harry and Harry hugged Draco, their shared feeling of utter helplessness and the gravity of their mutual burdens uniting them even as it weighed them down. Draco had been through awful things, seen death and horrible torture at a far younger age and more often than anyone ever should, been raised to hate and hurt and grown up surrounded by criminals and evil. They both knew life wasn't fair, had learned the hard way, but here they were, whole and alive and they both wanted to live. They understood each other better than anyone, they realised, and that made them both feel whole, and wanted.
"I just need your name, Potter, I don't know why you always seem to forget. Perhaps because you don't want to admit to such awful handwriting…" she grumbled, handing him the essay and a fountain pen. He nodded, apologising and glancing, embarrassed, at the passing 3rd years, who were giggling at his reprimand. He quickly scrawled his name at the top of the parchment, he
“What is the meaning of this?” Dumbledore was striding into view from dinner. Blaise met the old man’s eyes as he looked up at him, his jaw tight, but he never moved his wand from Potter.
“I just wanted to get you alone.” Crabbe said. Draco looked up at him, a flash of fear in his eyes but he seemed to suppress it, quirking a slender eyebrow.
The bed itself wasn't in its usual perfectly made self, something Draco did as soon as he got out of it, the sheets rumpled and to one side like he'd gotten out of bed in a hurry.
When they arrived at the Hospital Wing, they found the curtains drawn around Draco’s bed, and Pansy sitting at Pomfrey’s desk, hands wrapped around a steaming tea mug, and looking exhausted. Her eyes were red and puffy, she’d obviously been crying a lot. She stood up when she saw Blaise, rushing over to hug him.
"We were wondering, Potter… and you two, if you'd like to join us for a walk before dinner, if the weather stays nice. It will still be cold but..." Frankly, he would be glad for a chilly walk right about now, his cheeks feeling ridiculously hot and red. At least outside there would be a less embarrassing reason for pinkness than just Harry's smile.
Greyback stalked further into the room, tracking mud as he walked. He left the door open for anyone to walk past and see, or join in. Memory-Draco stood up slowly, putting the book he was holding down on his bedside table, among the many Sleeping Draughts he brewed himself just to get through this hell. All he wanted was to stand tall, not this weak decrepit shell he was now, a near skeleton with a skull of horrifying memories. But he wasn't a skeleton, not yet. He still retained his flesh, starved as it was, and pleasure could still be derived from that flesh. Greyback was an expert on that.
“I just don’t… need to right now. It’s getting, um, getting better.” He lied, it was as bad as always, but when he and Harry had done it over Christmas… it felt wonderful. He’d never felt that safe and cared for in his life, and certainly not with this group of selfish, thrusting animals he’d rather be drugged out of his mind for than actually feel. Anthony and his friends still looked angry. A couple of them towered over Draco, who was tall already, and, individually, they each had a good couple of stone on him, at the very least.
On the 21st, he went to the train station to say goodbye to the others, knowing they were worried he'd spend the entire winter break consumed by his conspiracy theories, only worsened when they saw Draco bidding his friends goodbye as well. Harry felt a pang of sadness and anger at this, realising that going home for Draco must be anything but comforting. He watched out of the corner of his eye as Pansy spoke seriously to Draco, holding his shoulder tightly as he nodded, and they hugged like good friends. Then Blaise said something that made Draco laugh and they hugged too, Harry feeling a strange surge of jealously as Blaise’s hand dropped innocently to Draco’s lower back.
They were in a large, firelit bedroom, the walls stone, the huge windows showing the grey, storm-darkened countryside. There was a neat desk, neat bookshelves and potions equipment, a cauldron heating over the fire that felt somehow cold, a meticulously made bed. A second Draco Malfoy, the memory version of him, was sitting on the emerald-coloured duvet. His face was distorted somehow, amorphous, like there was a smudge on Harry's glasses that wouldn't wipe away.
He spoke with increasing agitation, his eyes becoming shiny and the edges pinkened, voice trembling and nose sniffing. His mask of business-like indifference, the 'stiff upper lip' mentality that caused so many problems, crumbled away as he admitted to being
“Open your mouth.” Harry’s voice said. He didn’t even recognise his own words anymore, they were the Monster’s now. Draco looked at him again, eyes wide and begging silently. Harry’s hand gave another tug on his hair, and Draco looked down again, biting his lip.
The Monster seemed to have an exciting idea because it made Harry grab Draco by the hair and push him over to his friend. They stood before Crabbe, Draco’s half erect cock hanging indecently from his trousers right in front of his friend, his pink and crying face clearly visible to the paralysed boy. Harry stroked Draco’s cock some more, making it flop and dance in front of him, trying to get it hard enough to leak a little, maybe even make a game of getting Crabbe in the face.
“Th-thanks…” Draco said weakly, struggling to walk properly, which pleased Harry’s Monster. Crabbe put an arm around the blond in an attempt to keep him warm, apologising for making him leave the pub for him, and they trudged on towards the castle, Draco head down the whole way.
Virgin. The Monster hissed excitedly, and Harry felt himself nodding as he slid his fingers through the blond hair and tightening them around it, tugging him closer. Draco winced and obeyed, shuffling closer still across the damp bathroom floor.
"Good night, Draco." He said gently, getting into bed. Draco paused, heart racing, before almost running across the room and joining his friend in bed. He folded himself up, burying his face in Blaise's warm neck.
“I do want to... but I can’t...” He said softly, slowly opening the gift. Harry nodded, understanding completely.
“It’s ridiculous, Snape definitely has an excellent inventory system – what a completely pointless task to give you. You have plenty of homework to do, he shouldn’t be allowed to waste your time like this.” She muttered angrily. Harry shrugged, ignoring his Monster’s angry hiss at Hermione, presumably wanting her to shut up.
Still with one hand around Draco’s throat, squeezing just enough to restrict his breathing a little bit, the Monster pushed Draco into the wall directly in front of the larger boy, so Crabbe got a good view of his friend while the invisible Monster violated him. This time, the Monster went straight for Draco’s front rather than his back, undoing his trousers and gripping his flaccid member in Harry’s tight grip through the cloak, stroking it almost sensuously. Draco let out a sob, turning his face away from Crabbe, his cheek pressed against the cold stone wall. He was shivering, either from cold or fear or whatever, he didn’t know, the heat from the phantom’s hand on his cock was almost unbearable, the cloak feeling almost liquid-like against the sensitive flesh.
“Sleeping around?” Draco asked, impatient with Potter’s stuttering. The blond sighed, resting his head back against the headboard, looking up at the bed’s canopy. “Last year.”
He had told Pansy almost immediately that he'd slept with Harry, and the weird Christmas Day they'd spent together, by owl, and then told Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe when they got back to school.
Harry was looking over the Marauder’s Map, trying to find Malfoy. He hadn’t seen him around for a couple of days so, naturally, he was suspicious. Now he'd found him, just coming up to the 7th floor, surrounded by four other boys' names: Slytherins in the year above, Harry was fairly sure. If Draco was enlisting the help of older, more advanced, wizards then Harry needed to know why.
is our plan here? Not just with Malfoy, with everything. We don't know where the next Horocrux is, and now we basically have two prisoners, a goblin and a
Blaise walked into the 6th year boys’ dormitory, and found Draco curled up on his bed, fully clothed, apparently asleep. He knew his friend hadn’t been sleeping much at all recently so this would have been good to see, were it not for the dark bruising across the pale face. Blaise was instantly angry and stormed into the room, shaking Draco’s shoulder. The grey eyes snapped open, panic filling his very pale face as he jumped away from his friend. Blaise backed off quickly, his hands up to show him he wasn’t going to hurt him, deeply concerned by the reaction. Usually, Draco would just moan at him, or tell him to fuck off, but now he looked terrified. He had been quite jumpy recently, more so than usual, but this was much worse.
He was in such a state of hysteria, however, that Snape had forced a sleep tonic down his throat and his vision of the very office his Monster had committed it’s final assault on Draco Malfoy rippled into darkness.
He hadn't been privy to many of the more strategic meetings, not officially. But he had become a shadow who listened at doors, planted the confiscated Weasley's Wizard Wheezes from 6th year - pilfered and hidden from his time in the Inquisitorial Squad, and, on rare occasions, actually bought from their shop; in disguise, of course. The Extendable Ears were a particular stroke of brilliance, he could admit that.
The black suit Draco had been wearing that night, shirt buttoned high on his scrawny neck, had hidden the hundreds of bruises and scars he'd endured since fleeing Hogwarts. He could feel every single one as he stared into Harry's swollen face, and knew it would only destroy his humanity completely to expose the Golden Boy. He was not like them, he was
“I…I don’t know…” he whispered, feeling his own eyes stinging with tears. Draco watched him a moment longer, before closing his eyes. Harry cleaned Draco as best he could, until he got to where it mattered… The pink mess made him feel sick to his stomach, staring at the horrific, brutal act his own body had done. “Draco…do you want me to…?” he trailed off. Draco looked at him, his eyes completely empty, made of cold steel, and he shook his head.
Draco's condition worsened with every step, his breathing half sob, half gasp by the time they finally reached the Room. Blaise took Draco's weight while Harry asked for their usual set up and they both helped him in and onto the bed, where he curled up. Blaise lingered beside his friend, stroking his hair and whispering reassuring things, half covering him protectively. The others had followed them in, Pansy keeping vigil beside her friends while Ron and Hermione looked around the room with deep interest, glancing at each other and blushing.
Hermione also talks about her own experiences with racism and anti-Muggle prejudice, compares her own childhood, both in the Muggle world and in the Wizarding world, and tries to figure out her own feelings while also helping Ron understand her actions.
“I need to talk to you…somewhere quiet. I don’t…want anyone else around.” He said. Another flash of fear, and Draco seemed to be instantly wary of his friend, stopping in his tracks.
The day of their detention came, an owl arriving at breakfast on Saturday to inform Harry to head straight for the dungeons after eating. He looked up from Snape’s spider-like handwriting to search for Draco, whom he quickly found, reading a similar note. His eyes were gliding over the words, his jaw tight, cheekbones and eye sockets shadowed compared to his ivory skin. Goyle appeared to ask what the letter was, making Draco jump before putting his Malfoy mask on again and shrugging, muttering something as he folded the note up and put it in his pocket. When the others’ attentions weren’t on him, however, the mask shifted and Draco looked like he wanted to scream. Harry felt another wave of awful, crippling guilt, which was quickly consumed by his Monster’s delight.
Blaise smiled, returning from his thoughts, and kissed Draco's hair, inhaling the lovely smell of clementine and cloves that smelt like Christmas and warmth.
They sat down and began eating, trying to relax amongst their respectfully pleasant friends even as the entire hall watched them and gossiped. Hermione chanced a look at the Slytherin table, finding Blaise just getting up to leave his friends and Pansy staring daggers directly back at her.
He went back to the bed and lay down again, wanting to go back to sleep but all his mind would let him see was his future Azkaban cell full of dementors.
He gripped his wand in his pocket, knowing he couldn't fight them all without bringing some serious unwanted attention to himself and, therefore, his reason for associating with them outside of usual school life.
“That’s… Do you like it? Ever?” he asked. Draco looked at him, blushing again, and curled into a tighter ball, looking down again.
“Fuck!” he growled, plunging his fingers into his hair and pulling until it hurt. “What is wrong with me…?”
“He could charge money and I'd pay, literally.” It wasn’t until they were letting the door close, his mind fogged by sleep, that Harry realised Draco wasn’t with them anymore. He could hear them making dirty, sexual comments as they walked away down the corridor, nudging each other and laughing. Suddenly Harry felt a pang of worry for Malfoy, realising what they’d been doing wasn’t to further Voldemort's cause...it was to have sex! Four older boys...what if they forced Draco? What if they hurt him or worse?! Harry leapt the doors, but too late, his fingers scrabbled at the increasingly smooth stone until the doors appeared to never have existed. Harry swore, and restarted his pacing, his thoughts racing with one sentence, over and over.
“Imperio…” Harry’s voice whispered, almost inaudible to himself, and Crabbe seemed to freeze, then relax.
"Oh, wow! That's really great." Harry said, bringing their attention away from each other with soft smiles. He decided not the mention the Half-Blood Prince, the worn copy of Advanced Potion Making that had gone up in flames like the Library of Alexandria. He was sure Snape would have written extensive notes somewhere other than his school textbook anyway.
“There’s a rumour going round that he’s been put into isolation. No-one’s seen him, and Granger and Weasley only came down for dinner... Dunno what they’ll do with him…” he said with a sigh. Draco looked down at his hands, chewing his lip.
"What about Potter?" Crabbe asked, rather out of nowhere. They all looked at him in surprise, eyes wide. Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, then at Draco, eyebrows raised in question. Draco frowned.
"How soon before?" He glanced at her, confused by the question, or perhaps by that being the only thing she picked up on, then swallowed.
was his alternative? Die? Watch his family die? He's already been… been hurt so badly… I don't know what I would do in that situation. Yes, he hurt you, Ron. He's hurt all of us, and our friends, and part of me wants to punish him for that, but... his actions were either borne of his family's beliefs, his beliefs, or forced by
“Why…are you here…? Why did you come in? You must have asked the room to open.” he asked, eyes narrowing slightly. Harry cleared his throat nervously and shrugged.
“M…Malfoy?” Harry asked, thinking it better he made himself known as soon as possible. Draco jumped at his voice, and sat up quickly, but his expression was pained and he looked very pale, his white gold hair completely dishevelled. He fumbled for his wand, but it rolled off the bed and clattered loudly on the stone floor. The liquid silver eyes narrowed at him, looking angry and confused and...scared?
“There's a good memory for you, eh?” he asked. Draco was stock still, his body tensed, and, for a moment, and Blaise was suddenly terrified he’d made a mistake, that he’d taken advantage of Draco after everything.
The Monster purred at the distress in Malfoy’s face. It made Harry rock his hips, hand gripping the soft blond hair tighter so he couldn’t escape as the cock slid, in and out, between his lips. It was a wonderful sight, but not enough for Harry, or his Monster. The heat and wetness around him had sparked a need he’d only ever sated himself. Now he needed much, much more, and he knew his Monster did as well.
“I...I'm going back to my dormitory now…” Draco said decisively, finally getting dressed properly. He needed time alone, sleep in his own bed, take a
“He’s so c-cold…” she whispered, tucking his hand under the blanket. Blaise stood at Draco’s feet, staring at him. He thought about what Draco had said, that Harry had hurt him like this before…twice. How had they not noticed Draco was in so much pain? The first time must have been so…unbearable. He wondered when it had happened. In a bathroom, Draco had said… It must have been the day Draco came back to the Common Room quite late, having missed dinner. He’d said he’d been studying late in the library but the knees of his trousers had been wet and he went straight to bed, looking completely exhausted. But that had been, what? Over a month ago…had he really been dealing with this for that long? Blaise wanted to scream and cry and never let Draco out of his sight again. He moved closer to Draco as he lay, motionless and broken, on the bed, leaned down, kissing his forehead gently. He moved away slightly, looking down at the soft, porcelain-like skin and fine features.
He barely felt himself climax, a slight clouding of his vision and sense of physical relief as the Monster pressed him balls deep inside Draco, pumping him full of Harry’s seed, laughing in Harry’s head. Harry watched himself slip wetly out of Draco, letting go of him. The blond fell to the bathroom floor, thick pink-tinted liquid oozing from his ravaged hole, letting out shuddering breaths. The Monster gave one last satisfied look down at what it had accomplished and went back to sleep, leaving Harry staring down at Draco, utter horror gripping his heart.
“Crabbe…was there one of the times…the second time, in Hogsmeade. Potter used the Imperious Curse on him…I think when we were in the Three Broomsticks. After we left, he used Crabbe to…to grab me and take my wand and…and then he made Crabbe sit down and…and watch… He took off Imperio and cast Immobulus so Crabbe...saw everything, even if he doesn’t remember it.” He said, looking at his friend. Blaise looked shocked, and angry.
“Well, being faced with the most powerful dark wizard of all time will do that to a person.” Fred said with a smirk.
“Draco? What-" he stopped, seeing what had caused this petrification. Not a Basilisk, but something worse. Harry Potter was coming in from outside, frigid air filling the Entrance Hall as he closed the huge oak doors. He was carrying his Firebolt, dressed in Quidditch gear but not the Gryffindor training uniform, and looked dirty and sweaty. Blaise knew better than to touch Draco right now, triggered as he was, so walked in front of him to block his view of Potter. Draco was white as a sheet and looked he might throw up the first proper meal he'd eaten in weeks.
“Was it fucking Potter?!” she demanded, her raised voice making Draco flinch. Blaise noticed and pulled Pansy away from him, calmly sitting on the edge of the bed.
“No lubricating charm this time, I’m afraid…” it said calmly, reclaiming Harry’s voice, and pressed Harry’s thumb into the tight, dry heat of Draco’s entrance. He leaned down and Harry felt himself spit on the hole, the clear saliva rolling over the pale pink pucker, his thumb disappearing deeper inside the boy. He felt Draco tense, his breathing panicked as memories crashed over him, conditioned to expect pain. He began begging Harry to stop, pleading with him to let him go, ‘not again, Harry’ he sobbed.
“I really needed that…” he said with a laugh, looking at the bottle before passing it on to Ron, leaning his head back and opening his mouth to drink the rain instead. The Monster was undetectable, hiding in its dark place as it felt joy in Harry for the first time since taking up residence inside him. Hermione grinned and so did Ron.
Just under a month after their time together, Harry saw Draco with same group of 7th year Slytherins heading upstairs. It was during dinner, Harry running late after falling asleep in the library finishing a Potions essay, the corridors empty. Draco, though not short by any means, looked tiny in the midst of the huge Neanderthals he was with, his eyes uncharacteristically down as they passed, one of the older boys' arms around his waist. Harry fought the urge to follow, to stop them going into that room and treating Draco so badly again, but he didn’t, couldn’t.
Tightening his other hand on his hair, Harry slowly parted Draco’s lips with his thumb, then his teeth, and his fingers were feeling his hot, wet tongue, the cushiony flesh of his cheeks and the hardness of his teeth. Draco made a startled, questioning sound, trying to turn his head to get the fingers out but Harry only pushed them deeper – not far enough to make him gag but enough for him to moan in discomfort, helplessly using his tongue in an effort to push them away, or block them from going further, too afraid of pain to bite down.
Draco let out a sob at that, louder than before, true anguish in his voice. The Monster drank it in like water, eager for more, like it was dying of thirst. Harry was just beginning to enjoy fingering Malfoy, feeling like he was watching porn rather than participating, when the Monster decided to pull the fingers out. Draco’s legs were trembling, his fingers splayed out on the wall to keep himself upright. His shirt had fallen off one bony shoulder and his hair was a mess, looking deliciously interfered with.
“Congratulations.” Harry said, smiling and letting it be real. “I'm still at Grimmauld Place.” he said, because he wasn't sure what else to say. "So… I heard you were publishing something, um… Potions related?" He asked Draco, feeling awkward again. Draco brightened immediately and nodded, Blaise grinning proudly at the Malfoy.
Draco’s bruises were gone now, in their absence he looked almost himself…despite his extreme thinness and general air of someone struggling not to scream. Blaise’s presence was a huge comfort to him, however, as was Pansy’s in her own shrill way. He was happy when they visited, he didn’t have to think as much, or talk, he could simply listen and float. Blake’s was a great storyteller and he delighted in telling his friend funny stories from the last couple of days, such as Theodore forgetting the correct pronunciation of a charm that is supposed to make bricks form themselves into a perfect wall and ended up making them dance around him in a circle before forming a solid wall, forcing Professor Flitwick to carry out a controlled explosion to rescue him.
Harry was just falling into a deep sleep when he heard Draco whisper something that dominated his exhausted dreams.
“Potter-” Harry punched him in the stomach, cutting him off before he could insult him yet again. He grabbed Draco’s wand from the folds of his robes, shoving it into his own pocket so he couldn’t attack back.
The Christmas holidays arrived with snow. Hermione was going to Lapland for a skiing holiday, and Ron's entire family were going to visit Charlie in Romania, so Harry had decided to stay at school and have some time alone, which he was rather looking forward to.
- I did that!!” He wailed, fat tears rolling down his face, hair more of a mess than usual, like he'd been pulling at it. “I ruined his life, and mine and I don't know
“Poppy?” she called, and Pomfrey came through the door of her office, carrying a large heavy book which she placed carefully on her desk. She looked worried, not even trying to smile at her friend and colleague. McGonagall rushed over to her, and they spoke in hushed, quick whispers. Blaise tried to hear what they were saying, but could only catch a few words: before, fever, blood. McGonagall covered her own mouth, and Pomfrey led her over to the drawn curtains. Blaise only caught a glimpse of what lay beyond the white curtains as they were drawn back, but that was enough. Draco lay on his side in the bed, deathly pale, bruises stark and angry against his skin. His expression was pained, clearly shivering feverishly. The curtain closed again, and Blaise released the breath he hadn’t realised he was holding.
He grabbed Malfoy, picking him up. He was lighter than he’d expected, but his constant, albeit weak, struggles against Harry made him difficult to manoeuvre. He half carried, half dragged Draco to the boys’ bathroom, which was, thankfully, empty. He closed the door, then took Draco into a cubicle and locked it, sitting down on the toilet seat with Draco practically on his lap, his hand over Draco’s mouth. He listened intently, worried whoever it was would come into the toilets. They stayed there, both panting, Harry waiting. After enough time had passed and he was sure they were gone, he stood up and shoved Draco into the wall again.
They sat and played chess and chatted about normal things until it was late, oblivious to the horrors Dumbledore and Snape were seeing in the depths of Harry’s memories.
“Coriumtersus,” he said softly, and his skin became clean and dry before Harry’s eyes, including whatever was on his thighs. Draco glanced at Harry before lowering his voice even more to murmur “Internumtersus,” his breath catching and back shivering as he waved his wand. He sighed, placing a shaky hand on the bedpost, using it as a support as he slid himself off the bed. His feet barely touched the ground before his knees buckled and he almost fell, but Harry caught him.
“I don’t know, Harry, I’m sorry. I assume going to the Room of Requirement with… people, gets rid of his symptoms?” she asked, clearly still embarrassed they were discussing it. Harry sighed and nodded.
The shapes and blackness faded to reveal Shell Cottage again, each of them sitting as they had been. The brightness and familiar surroundings flooded Harry with relief and he was glad he was sitting down, his legs feeling weak. He looked first at Hermione, who was sitting very still, her face blank as she concentrated on breathing slowly, and then at Draco, who was looking at the floor, plainly exhausted by the spell and the memory.
“Help me to the bathroom…” he said, softly, starting to sit himself up. He let out a low moan of pain as he shifted, biting down on his already split lip, hard. There was drying blood on his chin, and a dark bruise developing along his cheekbone. Harry’s own jaw was burning, he assumed he’d have a bruise there pretty soon too…how the fuck were they going to explain this to Snape…?
The look bore so much loathing and pain that Harry stumbled backwards. Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks, and there was blood on his lips where he’d bitten into his own flesh. “GET OUT!” he shouted, his voice thick with hatred and pain, his breath coming out in shuddering pants, like he’d half forgotten how the breathe. Harry rushed to release all of his spells, unlocking the door and returning sound to the world. The sound of people walking past on their way to their dorms, people laughing and talking to their friends.
Across the room, green eyes watched. His smile had been uncomfortable for a little while now, since the adrenaline waned after the match. The others were still high on their victory, but Harry didn't feel their joy the same. His head hurt, his eyes were sore from his frequent sleeplessness nights,  as were his muscles. Flying was his way of coping, training hard, long hours in any weather to be everything he could be, everything he would be. He had a talent, and he clung to it like a broom hovering miles and miles above the ground, the only thing keeping him from plummeting.
The Slytherins were in their usual formidable nest, blocking everyone else out with their proud backs and unfriendly expressions. Harry summoned every ounce of courage he possessed, which to be fair was a decent sum, and cleared his throat behind Theodore Nott. The gangly boy turned slowly, frowning, perhaps expecting it to be a teacher and followed by some kind of rebuke, but his expression became a sneer when he saw Harry.
“R-ready?” Draco asked this time, breaking the kiss, his lips wet and eyes misty and face beautiful. Harry nodded quickly, his almost erection instantly becoming full mast, sitting up fully to meet Draco’s chest as he sat in his lap, holding him steady. Malfoy used Harry’s shoulder to push himself up on his toes, positioning Harry’s cock before sinking down on it all the way to the hilt. Draco’s head fell back, his mouth open in a low moan, his hand gripping Harry’s shoulder tightly. Harry’s eyes, despite his lack of glasses, focused on the white flesh of Draco’s neck and his mouth literally watered. His hands grabbed Draco’s arse cheeks, fingertips touching where he and Draco were connected, and lavished the pale throat with almost frenzied kisses and bites. Draco half choked on his pleasure, coming yet again, but nothing came out this time. He let out a sob, exhausted, and collapsed against Harry, his poorly body trembling badly.
Their journey back was less straight forward than Blaise's expedition had been, the Headless Hunt had set up some kind of tournament in the corridor they were heading down so they had to detour a longer way, their hands clasped tightly together the whole time. Draco was panting by the time they finally reached their dormitory, his recent history and current recovery making him easily winded, but otherwise he seemed alright. They crept back into the dormitory, finding everyone else still asleep, and prepared for bed themselves. After a few moments of silence, Blaise looked at Draco.
“We’ll see you soon, Draco.” Anthony said, smirking at the Malfoy arrogantly, before he and his friends sidled off, in the opposite direction to the younger Slytherins. Draco's oldest friends were quickly beside him and, seeing he was flustered, Goyle patted his back almost gently.
"What do you suggest?" He asked, wanting to pull his hand away. He could still feel the heavy warmth of Anthony's hand on his shoulder. He wanted a very hot bath and to scrub the feeling away. Blaise seemed to realise this and let go, looking down as he thought hard.
I didn't want it to all be dialogue so used the Legilimens as a device to portray it differently - what do you think about the level of heavy action? I know it can be very triggering to people but I would hope the warnings aren't ignored if it is traumatic to read... let me know in the comments.
“So does Ron.” He said with a chuckle, and looked up to see Draco looking at him, suspiciously. “What?” he asked.
“I understand that but...wouldn't you prefer to...like it? It must be hard for you, being with them. Why else would you let them drug you if you didn’t hate it?” he asked, staring wide-eyed at the blond boy. Malfoy looked angry for a moment, perhaps thinking of something vicious to say, but looked away, seeming to shrink slightly. He shook his head slowly.
by these boys. His last rambled words struck a cord deep inside Harry's chest, the same as he'd felt when he saw how truly damaged Draco was, and he gently took the glass from his tight fingers, moving it safely aside and pulling the boy into a hug.
“Follow me, please, Harry.” Dumbledore said, his long silver hair glittering in the new light behind him.
The Monster wrapped Harry’s hands around the pointy hips and pulled them up to the right height for Harry, the blond’s long legs would have made it easier were they not so weak. Keeping him steady with one hand, the Monster gripped Harry’s cock rather too tightly and nudged it into Draco’s moistened hole.
“Draco?” he asked when he was close enough to see the white gold hair. He had noticed he wasn't in the hall for dinner, had assumed he was eating in his Common Room.
He wasn’t sure how he got into the Common Room. He didn’t remember walking there, he didn’t remember giving the password, or climbing into the warm room he loved so much. Now Hermione and Ron were in front of him, covered in white powder, just like everyone else in the room.
Dumbledore’s office was large, and full of strange objects on spindle-leg tables. Blaise didn’t care about that though, he cared about Draco.
“Harry, we’re heading back to the castle. The snow’s getting worse.” Hermione called from across the shop. He turned and nodded. He bought the beautiful little brass sculpture that turned and played a very pretty lullaby-like song, vaguely planning to give it to Fleur for Christmas, and they left, thanking the shopkeeper as they went. The snow was heavier now, the wind picking up as well, and they bundled themselves up for the walk back. They were just heading out of Hogsmeade, the walled road stretching out whitely before them, when Harry spotted a gold and black shape moving past out of the corner of his eye. He turned his head and saw Draco Malfoy walking further into the village, alone, his white hair shining like a Golden Snitch. The surging need to catch it filling him, his Monster waking up instantly.
Blaise waited outside for Pansy to join him, and they walked back to the Slytherin dungeon, both sniffing covertly. They both went to bed as soon as they arrived, parting with weary words. Blaise got to their room and collapsed onto his own bed. No-one else was there yet, thankfully, and he was able to cry some more before getting ready for bed.
"Calidumus..." He said, the same spell he'd used then, now casting it on the towel Draco was wrapped in. Instantly, Draco let out a soft sigh, pulling the towel further around himself like a blanket.
“It’s ok, you don’t need to say it… God, Draco, I’m so sorry… We could have stopped him! We thought Crabbe was acting weird but I never imagined he was-…fuck…” he sighed, hugging Draco. Draco hugged him back, glad one more heavy truth had been lifted from him. He dreaded speaking to the others, especially Crabbe, but he was happy Blaise was staying with him. “That was the night you came back half frozen, right? Crabbe gave you his cloak?” Draco nodded, remembering how wretched he’d felt and Crabbe, completely ignorant of it, had been worried he was cold and gave him his winter cloak to wear over his coat. He’d been grateful to his friend, who didn’t know he knew better, but in so much pain. When they got back to the Common Room, his friends made Draco sit by the fire to warm up, Goyle even broke out the Firewhiskey he’d been saving to help. Even though the chill was the least of his pains, it felt good to be cared for and about. He’d gone to bed that night drunk and numb, and he thanked the creators of Firewhiskey that he didn’t dream a thing. “Did he wipe Crabbe’s memory?” Blaise asked. Draco frowned, trying to remember.
Draco nodded, and Harry slowly pushed himself forward. The tip of his erection disappeared inside Draco, the tight heat around it making Harry gasp, almost collapsing on top of him. Draco let out a long, loud moan, punctuated by a scream when Harry impulsively thrust himself all the way inside Draco, his back arching almost inhumanly as he came yet again. Harry stayed still, marvelling at this and not wanting to overstimulate Draco, but the Malfoy’s hand found Harry’s supporting arm and held it as tightly as he could.
Draco seemed to decide not to cry, setting his jaw and his eyes becoming steel once again. He grabbed another jar of truffles and walked past Harry, out into the classroom, head held high. Harry sighed, and repaired the jar, cleaned up the truffles, and selected a jar of doxy eggs, returning to the classroom. Draco was back at his table with Pansy, who seemed to be trying to question him, but Draco wasn’t responding, his jaw still clenched.
“Look at the proud Draco Malfoy, Crabbe…don’t you wish you could fuck him until he cries like this?” Harry’s voice asked, laughing in Crabbe’s paralysed face and his floppy cock hanging from his trousers. “Think about all the times he’s ordered you around…look at him now…” Draco was very quiet for this, leading the Monster to believe he was trying to be strong, especially in front of Crabbe. So, still holding Draco by the hair, it pulled his head all the way back to rest on Harry’s invisible shoulder, and forced him to raise one leg, bending it at the knee to reveal Harry’s disembodied cock ramming into his body with staggering force. Blood was trickling down the inside of his planted thigh, his shackled hands trying to cover himself as Harry fucked him mercilessly, pulling his green jumper down over his exposed genitals. The Monster wanted to give Crabbe more of a show, so it pulled all the way out to reveal the full bloodied length of Harry’s certainly-not-small erection, rubbed it against Draco’s thigh for a moment before ramming back in, all the way to the hilt.
“Draco, I really think you should go to the Hospital Wing – you haven’t eaten a thing in days!.” the unmistakably irritating voice of Pansy Parkinson echoed through the hallways.
It was too late before he realised he was drifting towards the ground. It wasn't a hard impact, the ground too soft and wet to hurt much, but he did get covered in mud. He'd cried like a child, sitting on the dirt in the rain, then gone inside when he realised how cold he was.
“We just bought a flat actually. Moving in tomorrow.” Blaise said, hugging Draco close. It was a small gesture, but meant a lot:
Lucius was still in prison, where he would be until he died. For all his flaws, the Malfoy patriarch had taken full responsibility for his family's part in the war, requesting a higher sentence to protect his wife and son. Harry knew Draco was sad about that, from the way he had written about his father, but it was the best scenario.
“You can sleep if you want to…” Harry said, thinking Draco probably needed more sleep. Malfoy glared at him, defiance and mistrust in his colourless eyes. “I can leave if-” but to his surprise, Draco’s eyes widened before he seemed to be able to stop it, and he looked down.
The spell broke and Draco went still, Harry’s cock still inside him. Harry held onto him, the distant part of his consciousness, which he was quickly regaining, terrified he’d died from the pain. He lowered them both to the floor, removing himself from the destroyed hole, cradling Draco gently. The Monster seemed to step back in his mind, but Harry could feel its pleasure at seeing Draco so utterly broken. His eyes were half-lidded and blank, his body shaking badly as his breathing came out in short, shallow pants, tears rolling over his temples into his white hair.
Ginny stood by the window seven floors up, her arms crossed. She'd watched her brother, friend and…whatever Harry was, screaming at the top of their lungs in the rain, and now they were sitting on the floor passing a whiskey bottle around.
“Attacked…?” Goyle asked, still staring at the immaculately arranged bedding Draco spent that morning before breakfast perfecting. Whenever he’d asked Draco why he put so much effort into making his bed every morning, Draco would say he just liked the way it looked, clean and tidy. Draco always liked to be clean and tidy…
“Now, now, Draco…we mustn’t talk to our superiors like that.” Draco looked even angrier, the Malfoy instinct telling him to deny being inferior to anyone, when the Monster grabbed a handful of his blond hair and threw him to the floor with such force that he ended up at Crabbe’s feet. Draco scrambled to right himself, using the bench and Crabbe himself to get up, but Harry swooped down on him, grabbing him by the neck and pulling him to his feet in front of Crabbe, whom he could see was fully conscious and watching through his paralysis. His eyes couldn’t move, couldn’t blink, but it was clear he could see it all, unable to stop himself. The Monster thrashed excitedly, stretching its muscles, preparing, like it were about to go for a jog. It was really going to enjoy this.
Harry settled himself between the blond’s legs, rubbing his own erection, trapped in his trousers, against Draco’s bare one. The roughness of the fabric against the extremely sensitive member made Draco scream and he came again over his own chest, but he remained hard and leaking.
“Ok, so, you know last week when I didn’t come back to the dorm. I said I’d gone to the Shrieking Shack to clear my head?” he asked and she nodded that she did recall. “I lied. I was in the Room of Requirement with… with Malfoy.” He said. She looked surprised, but listened intently as he told her everything Draco had told him about Voldemort and what he has to do to keep himself healthy.
He was panting when he realised how much his hand hurt. He looked down and saw his knuckles were bleeding, the skin stinging badly where the lower levels were exposed to the air. “Shit...” He muttered, pulling his jumper to wipe at the blood, but that only hurt more. He didn’t have his wand or anything to wash or heal it, so he sucked on the knuckles, kicking at the coppery taste with slight disgust, but at least it would be clean.
"What do you want, Potter?" He asked, his inflection on his surname as though it were a physically sickening disease, very much copied from Malfoy's patented drawl. Harry ignored him, however, making eye contact with Draco and allowing a small smirk that was neither too enthusiastic nor too nuanced.
Then Blaise realised...understood why Draco had looked around so desperately when he heard the door, why just Blaise being visible and solid made him relax. If Potter had used his invisibility cloak everyone knew he had, the attacks were literally out of nowhere, a phantom causing him so much pain. Blaise hugged Draco again tightly when he stood up, surprising the boy but not frightening him. "Blaise?" He asked after a few beats of the silent embrace. Blaise rubbing his bony back.
Harry picked Draco up with too much ease, feeling him tense and shiver and whimper, and took him into the bathroom. He sat him on the toilet without being instructed, and left him alone, closing the door. Harry let out a deep, shaking breath as he stood there in Snape’s office, fighting the urge to destroy everything in it. He walked over to the desk, rinsed out the cloth, and cleaned up the mess from the desk, scrubbing the small bits that had found its way into the rug beneath. He then gathered up Draco’s clothes, which were scattered across the floor, and knocked on the bathroom door.
"I will speak to Snape. I hope you're both being safe with this plan." She said, glancing at him. He nodded, blushing more even if that's not what she meant.
Their faces were inches apart, their breaths and moans intermingling in the hot air between them. Harry stared down at Draco, his poor vision having made it hard to see his expression without being this close. Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks, his mouth was open and wet, his tongue undulating invitingly over and against his teeth, which occasionally brushed his bottom lip, which was plump and raw from kissing. It was much pinker than usual, as were his cheeks and around his eyes. His eyes were what struck Harry the most. His eyes looked like hot metal, shimmering and incandescent silver, alive with want and lust.
“Not really…” he said vaguely. “My body needs it, but my mind would rather be elsewhere.” He said. If Draco saw Harry’s confusion, he ignored it, crossing his arms over his skinny chest casually. Harry swallowed thickly, wanting more answers from Draco while he was being so open.
“We don’t know what happened. All we know is that Dumbledore and McGonagall brought Harry up here last night, he took a bag of stuff, and they left. That was the last time we saw him, and he didn’t say a word to us.” He said, barely looking at his sister.
"Ok… Like, I hate Snape as much as anyone but… isn't that helpful? I mean, if we're going to be public about this," he pointing between himself and Draco several (too many) times, "don't we want someone on the inside making sure they hear what we want them to hear…?" He asked. Draco looked grumpy, crossing his arms in a sulk.
“That’s said, we must discuss your involvement.” Dumbledore continued, and Harry nodded even as he knuckles went white. “We believe…that Voldemort has been using you as a sort of conduit.” Harry looked up, incredulous. Deep down he'd known. Draco had said his eyes were red, and that high, cruel voice… He'd never been face-to-face with it like this, however, and it made him want to rip out his own eyes and scrub himself clean until there was no skin left.
"It's alright, Malfoy. Just tell me what you need me to do." He said softly, mouth close to the blond boy's ear. He leaned away when he felt Draco tense, worried he'd startled him, made him feel unsafe like those boys had. But, when he looked at Draco, he saw a distinct blush on his high, pale cheekbones. "Sorry." Harry said with a smile, grey eyes meeting his cheerful green ones, and a smile slowly spread over Draco's lips too. "Do you have a plan?" He asked. Draco let out a breath through his nose and nodded.
“Please… take a seat.” Draco said, surprising all three of them, his voice the tiniest bit breathless as he gestured to the seat on the other side of the table. Harry did so as non-awkwardly as he could manage, mumbling his thanks. “How have you been?” Draco asked, looking into his eyes and trying not to move away, shuffle closer to Blaise. Blaise moved closer to him instead, and he was grateful.
“Draco…God, Draco, what happened…?” Blaise asked him quietly, once his sobs had lessened. Draco sat up slowly, his eyes tired and so sad. “You can talk to us, Draco…” he said, wiping at the tear tracks on the pale cheeks with his thumb. Draco winced when his hand got a little too close to his bruise, and sighed.
, he protected him, fighting through the visceral reaction in order to stop his true abuser from getting what he wanted. He knew, deep down, that Harry had never hurt him, not really. It was the man he was serving who had truly destroyed him, and had continued to do so in his own childhood home, this time using Death Eaters and Fenrir Greyback as his puppets of torture. The Dark Lord had never touched him directly, preferring to watch. Luckily, none of that was in the newspapers.
“And your current mental state? How is that doing?” Dumbledore asked, dunking his own biscuit into his tea with a small smile. Harry sighed and shrugged.
“Stay away from me, Potter.” Draco snarled, backing away from him, eyes wide with terror. The Monster purred at this show of resistance, it made it more interesting. Harry felt his own face grin, and Draco’s face paled. He took another step back, and Harry’s feet moved him forward. “I mean it, Potter, don’t come near m-”
Greyback stood in the doorway, thick muddy water seeping into the once lush green carpet of Draco's childhood bedroom. His face, too, was distorted; like Draco couldn't quite remember what he looked like. Or himself.
"Yes… but I'm not sure you're going to like it much, Potter." He said, a little mischievous glint in his eye. "Weasley
Eventually, Harry realised he was very, very thirsty, and slowly and carefully extracted himself from around Draco, not wanting to wake him up. He sat up and put his glasses on, looking around the room for the pitcher of water that had been here last time. There it was, on the table beside the sofa, the fire crackling merrily as always. He felt wonderful as he got up, leaving Draco asleep as he padded over and drank the cool liquid greedily, some spilling down his bare chest in his haste. He burped and turned back towards the bed, yawning and scratching his messy hair, when he spotted something odd on the end closest to him.
Draco looked up at Harry, finally, and seemed to flounder when they made direct eye contact. Harry was blushing too and Pansy was grinning between them.
They got Draco to the library and Blaise helped him get his homework out and found something he could focus on. Despite Potions being a place of bad memories now, the processes were a great comfort for Draco. Analysing and explaining a complicated potion recipe and the context behind it's creation and use was perfect after such an encounter. They stayed in the library for most of the day, sitting in comfy seats and by a crackling fire. Pansy and Blaise got on with their own work, though they both kept an eye on their friend. He seemed better, even speaking up on occasion to join in on whatever they were chatting about, or to tell them something interesting about the potion he was studying. It wasn't good yet, but it was better.
“Lower your wands, all of you!” McGonagall cried angrily, appearing beside the Headmaster. Blaise hesitated, looking back down at Harry and the others. Hermione had obeyed, and was nudging the others to do the same. Weasley was looking stupidly at Potter, obviously not wanting to unless he did. “Now!” McGonagall shrieked, and Harry and Ron’s wands dropped, Harry staring up at Blaise, his mouth a tight line. Blaise did the same, slowly, not taking his eyes off Potter. McGonagall and Dumbledore both came up the stairs.
Draco looked at him in shock, the blush instantaneous as always on his pale skin, and allowed a small smile of his own, feeling Harry's large, warm hand on his back. He glanced up at the teacher's table to see Snape and McGonagall sitting beside each other, as usual, and speaking hastily, which was unusual. God, this was overwhelming, his face almost unbearably hot.
“I…” he started hoarsely, then cleared his throat, “I can’t remember, sir…something stupid…” he said, his jaw clenched. Snape sighed, pulling their wands from his pocket and handing them back to their owners.
"I don't… I don't know." She said softly. Both boys stared at her. "You're right, Ron, I've been blinded by how bad Draco looks, how different he is now." She said, frowning deeply. "On one hand, he was brought up to believe in the hate Death Eaters and You-Know-Who spout. He's always been on their side, it's
“Hey, mate, you alright?” he asked, seeing Harry's tear streaked face, but Hermione grabbed them both by the hand and they practically ran down the corridor. They went all the way down to the Entrance Hall and out into the misty, rainy afternoon where they'd won the match.
“Yes, well... Don’t get used to it, Potter...” he muttered with little of his usual venom. Harry felt compelled to say what was plaguing his mind.
“Don’t be sorry, it’s ok. It’ll get easier, I promise.” He thought for a moment, before making a decision he never thought he’d need to make. “My, um...my mum was raped.” He said softly. He felt Draco inhale sharply and look at him with wide eyes.
“Draco…be a good boy and undo our guest’s trousers for him…” its words said in Harry’s voice, though higher and crueller than usual. Draco turned his head against Crabbe’s neck, where he was apparently trying to get some form of comfort, his one visible eye huge with terror as he tried to find his assailant but couldn’t. He let out a sob, taking a shaky deep breath, before one hand dropped from his friend’s shoulder, hesitantly gripping Crabbe’s flyer and pulling it down. He undid the button with heavy, clumsy fingers, his eyes closed again as he buried his face in his friend’s neck, crying softly.
“We are keeping Mr Potter separate from the rest of the students while we…investigate these claims from Mr Zabini.”
. The thing that plagued his life, made it a living hell before Potter stumbled upon his sorry state and offered to help. He realised he'd been feeling it since this morning, even before Harry looked at him with his green eyes and sunny smile. Since he woke up, if he thought about it, but he was too consumed by his growing attraction to Harry fucking Potter to see it for what it was.
The day ended agonisingly slowly. They decided to brave the Great Hall for dinner, having only eaten when they had lying around in the Common Room all day. A hush came over the bustling dining room when the two appeared, most notably sans Potter. Then a cacophony of whispering erupted, angering Ron almost to the point of bolting, but Hermione had gripped his wrist and pulled him to their usual place at the Gryffindor table, her nose in the air imperiously.
She pondered a fitting punishment for Draco's crimes, taking into account his motives, his indoctrination, his
Harry sighed, looking down at the list in his hands and was horrified to find it very long and double-sided. He looked at Draco, who was staring at him, eyes wide, waiting for him to attack. Harry ignored the rush of muddled feeling he got when he saw the fear in Draco’s eyes, and went over to the desk, selecting a pen and an inkwell, as well as a portable writing board, and went into the store room to begin this truly inane and tedious task. There must be magic for this sort of rubbish…
“Sometimes…it’s difficult to say, my body reacts to it but it can be…nice… I’ve never liked it with the seventh-years…there’s always too many of them, and they say such cruel things…” he looked into the fire then, his jaw tight. He took a deep breath before continuing. “I liked it with Blaise but…I’ve never liked it anywhere near as much as I liked it with you.” He said, barely even glancing at Harry.
Harry saw Draco nod almost imperceptibly and slid the letter, unopened, into his pocket. Harry pretended the confirming exchanged hadn't taken place, seamlessly returning to the table's conversation on their favourite cereals, which was inevitably becoming Muggle vs. Wizarding.
His friends knew what to do, Blaise pouring a glass of cold water and dunking a handkerchief in it, while Pansy made sure Draco's robes would cover up any obvious sign of his condition. They laughed it off, pretending the two were just in the throes of passion, Ron and Hermione confusedly playing along.
At breakfast on Sunday, Draco sat down beside Harry, joined by Pansy. Blaise and the others were at the Slytherin table, monitoring the situation carefully. Except Crabbe, who was diligently trying to read
"Draco, it's freezing, get out!" He cried, making Draco jump. Blaise went around the gaping tub to where Draco's pyjamas and towel were strewn on the floor. He picked up the towel and held it out to Draco, staring at him incredulously. "Please, Draco..." He said, softer. Draco let out a breath and stood up slowly, eyes fixed on Blaise like he expected him to attack. Blaise held his gaze, resisting the very human urge to look at his nakedness. He wrapped Draco in the towel, then helped him up the steps of the huge bath. Then he hugged him, feeling his shivers and the chill of his skin even through his own clothes, and was again reminded of what he knew now to be the second time Draco was raped.
He was sitting the sofa, actually reading a book about the wizarding world's involvement during the many wars in human history, stopping short of  the First World War, indicating it was written before the 20th century. It was difficult to read and rather boring but he needed something to occupy himself with. He couldn’t stop thinking about what the teachers must have seen in the Pensive, every disgusting gut-wrenching horror he had inflicted on Draco, every high pitched laugh that bubbled from Harry's throat as he did them.
“Yes...I hope so.” he said softly, looking at Harry for a moment before withdrawing his hand slowly. They sat in more silence while they finished their breakfast and presents opened, then Harry asked the question burning in his mind.
Short one to keep the ball rolling, hope you like where I'm taking this - there's some plan hatching afoot.
“What’s embarrassing…?” a croaky voice asked, and Harry looked up to see Draco sitting up slowly, surrounded by the thick, rumpled quilt, rubbing his eyes.
“Oh my God, Draco, your neck!” Pansy cried, her face filled with horror. Draco closed his eyes at that, wanting it all to go away. Blaise moved closer to him, staring at the dark, angry bruising around the slender white throat. There were clear marks made by fingers, hands, someone had tried to strangle Draco.
“What’s going on? Why does he need his stuff?” Ron asked, looking between the three of them. Dumbledore gestured Harry up the stairs, and he obeyed, the Headmaster following him. Ron and Hermione both looked at McGonagall, their expressions incredulous. She looked tired, sighing.
Harry pulled on his own discarded boxers, gathered his own gifts and went to sit in front of the fire, laying the bundles on the coffee table he didn’t recall being there before. “I’m starving…” he said, with a happy sigh.
“Can you go to Azkaban for…for that..?” he asked, as unwilling to say the word as most people were saying a certain name.
Most people screamed and tried to cover their heads and/or food, grabbing what they could and running for the exit. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, despite being drenched, and nodded to the others, all blinking water out of their eyes. They all rose as a unit, his arms around the quickly weakening Draco to help him up and off the bench. He could walk and stand well enough but he was shaking so badly already, so suddenly, it was a wonder he could move at all. Keeping him close, they were flanked by their respective friends, rushing from the scene now descended in chaos, joining the running crowd.
“I…I assume so, I can’t really remember much of what happened… I didn’t hear him say Obliviate but he may have done…” he said softly, looking at Blaise with his big, storm cloud eyes. “Have…have you heard anything about Potter?” he asked, looking down again.
The first night Blaise stayed over, he slept on a second bed in the spare room Draco was using. He didn't say why he no longer slept in the bedroom that had been his since he was born, but Blaise could guess. Sometime that night, Blaise had woken to the very soft, sadly familiar sound of someone crying. It had been a few years, but his body reacted automatically. He got out of bed, the room feeling very cold, and went over to where Draco lay and suddenly it was like no time had passed and they were in the Slytherin dormitory again, gently waking Draco up from a nightmare with a careful shake of the shoulder. But it was worse now. The Malfoy gasped awake, fighting against his friend's hands and screaming.
strong, and brave, and he was determined to help him every step of the way. So, he gathered some soft pyjama trousers, thick socks and a big knitted jumper for Draco, and returned to him. They didn't lock doors, that was an early rule in their post-war relationship, so he knocked before going in.
He walked back up the 7th floor in a daze, walking through the empty Common Room and up to his dormitory. Everyone else was still asleep. If it was Tuesday they would have lessons. He wondered if he’d be expected to go to any, and then if he wanted to. Maybe routine would be good, getting back to school life sounded like a very welcome dose of normality. He had barely listened to a word in any lesson for weeks, his mind consumed with guilt and self-hatred. He pulled off his jeans and got into bed, deciding to have an hour or so of sleep before the others stirred and bombarded him with questions he couldn’t answer.
“Th...Thank you for telling me...” He said finally, moving a hand to hesitantly touch Blaise's arm just above his elbow. Blaise smiled and adjusted his head on the pillow, looking into Draco's eyes.
Blaise held him tightly as he sobbed into his shoulder, feeling his bones through his clothes. He glanced over to see Pansy walk around the bed, and she sat beside them, tears in her eyes as she joined the hug, stroking Draco’s hair gently.
The next morning was a blur of questions, stares, and scathing, biting rumours. The whole school knew about Blaise loudly confronting Harry Potter in the Entrance Hall, and that it had something to do with Draco Malfoy. Rumours included use of the Cruciatus Curse or some other awful torture spell, Harry attacking Draco with a poisoned knife, and the two of them having a duel that ended in Malfoy’s death – though lots of people seemed to know Draco was in the Hospital Wing, and was alive.
“W-well, um..." she cleared her throat, then took a nervous sip from her water bottle. "I have heard of things like that. Not
One day, in the Gryffindor Common Room, McGonagall swept in and asked Harry to step outside with her for 'a wee chat'. He had accepted politely and followed her through the portrait hole, far enough away from the Fat Lady so she wouldn't overhear and inevitably tell Violet for all the other portraits to listen in.
“Please…” he said very softly, and that was all Harry needed to know. He’d been treated so roughly all this time, that was obvious; first Voldemort, then those brutes in 7th year… he just wanted something nice… gentle and caring.
After recovering himself, and sprinted up to the Gryffindor tower, where he took the hottest shower he could possibly stand, scrubbing himself raw to get rid of the filth he was drowning in. He went to bed, ignoring Ron’s questions of where the bloody hell he’d been all this time, and dreamt of making Crabbe watch as he ate Draco’s still-beating heart.
I can't get rid of him, he's always in here and I c-can't stop him…!” He sobbed hysterically, holding her arms tightly as he fought the urge to scream at the top of his lungs. Hermione hugged his head, her fingers in his hair as he sobbed into her chest, tears running down her own cheeks as she listened to his anguished cries. Harry had been elsewhere for a long time, she knew that, Ron knew it, but they'd hoped he'd come back on his own. When Harry had finally told them exactly what happened, what he'd done, in Dumbledore’s office, the Headmaster present and sad at his desk, they had been horrified but she soon realised she hadn't been particularly surprised.
Dumbledore cleared his throat before continuing, bring Harry back from the brink. “When you feel a strong emotion, he takes over at least some of your mind. His influence is what made you do these…things to Draco Malfoy.” Dumbledore said calmly, his expression a little sad. McGonagall wasn’t looking at Harry at all, while Snape was almost sneering at him, hatred in his eyes.
Even so, he managed to meet Blaise's eyes and keep his gaze. “Library, yeah?” Blaise asked gently, eyebrows raised earnestly, and Draco forced himself to nod. “Ok, let's go.” He said with a smile, trying to keep his tone casual. Pansy had stayed out of it, trusting Blaise to handle things, and instead focussed her energy on trying to kill Potter with her mind. He'd waltzed in, cool as you like, and had hardly even glanced at Draco and his friends.
Sunday breakfast was a much more casual affair to other meals, only half the school even attended and it went on for longer. Lots of people with friends outside their own houses (usually Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, but occasionally a Slytherin or two will mix with the others), took the opportunity to spend some time with said friends over the meal.
“Professor Snape tells me you are much improved, Harry.” Dumbledore said as he poured him tea during one of their semi-weekly visits, or ‘check-ups’ as the Headmaster referred to them. Harry nodded, taking a bite of the lemon biscuit on his saucer.
"Nearly 3. I woke up and you were gone, I was worried." He said, not coming any closer. Draco looked around, slightly panicked, then sighed a dragged a wet hand through his hair.
This was the first place they lived in together, about six months after Draco was let out on parole, and they'd been here ever since. Draco had stayed in the Manor at first but hated every second, keeping mostly to one small sitting room he shared with his mother to avoid the rest of the vast mansion.
Also, for the record, while I understand it might seem like I'm minimising the actions of Draco and, by extension, the Death Eaters (the alt-right, I guess?) that isn't my intention. I'm trying to focus on the fictional trauma I've created and how this and Draco's upbringing fundamentally affects his choice in the matter. 💕 I won't explain it again, I know you guys know this by now, and I've also set comments to be moderated and approved, so I can censor stuff if needed. I'm kind of pleased this story is popular enough to have controversy tbh
“It’s just so awful…!” she sobbed. He hugged her, looking at McGonagall, who had a very harassed, almost scared, expression on her lined face.
“What happened, Vince?” Goyle asked, shaking Crabbe’s shoulder. Pansy glanced over to where Draco and Blaise were sitting at one of the study desks, Draco helping Blaise with his Potions essay. They were looking over too, a certain tension in their appearances, anticipating, dreading. Blaise looked like he wanted to get up, go over to Crabbe and
The Monster stirred, the same rage bubbling in his chest as when he’d first used Crucio on Malfoy, and realised how good it felt. He knew what his Monster wanted, was telling him to do, and he couldn’t help but agree. Draco needed to understand what would happen if he told anyone, he needed to be taught a lesson. Harry glanced up at the teacher’s table, at Snape, and the Monster seemed to be happy to see him, as if it was thanking the Potions Master for giving Harry such a fine opportunity to get Malfoy alone.
Stormcloud eyes stared at him, apparently disarmed by this question. “Us! Me...Pansy? Crabbe and Goyle? Aren't we your friends? Do you want to forget us?” he asked, challengingly. He hoped there was enough of the Malfoy arrogance left in Draco's stricken mind to relish the opportunity to argue with him. “We've been sleeping in the same bed for weeks and it's been helping, you said it helps...doesn't that mean something to you?”
“Whoa, Draco…here, wear my cloak, you’re gonna freeze to death.” He said, pulling off his own winter cloak and draping it around Draco’s thin shoulders over his coat. As well as all his natural layering, Crabbe was wearing a thick jumper and barely seemed to feel the cold.
The last couple of weeks of term passed slowly. Harry’s nightmares were particularly bad, and particularly disturbing. Every single one involved Malfoy, usually violently sexual. When Harry started waking up, covered on cold sweat and with sticky pyjama trousers, he decided to get a Sleeping potion from Madam Pomfrey, hoping it would curb the strange, sick wet dreams he was so ashamed of. The last few days before the Christmas holidays started were better, sleeping and eating were easier, until he finally saw Draco.
“It's not true, is it? What they’re saying?” There was a mixture of defiance, disbelief and true fear in her eyes when they glanced at each other, then Ron sighed.
He’d gone out for some flying, out of practice as he was, trying to get back into it and to clear his racing mind. His place as Seeker, not to mention Team Captain, was under speculation, he knew, and Quidditch practice had yet to restart after Christmas. Flying had felt good, right, able to focus his mind on just the wind in his hair, the cold rain stinging his face, and the feeling of weightlessness. He'd been soaring until he suddenly lost concentration, his mind wandering back to all the awful things he'd done under Voldemort's control, how his own arrogance and unwillingness to accept Snape as his teacher to the point of stopping Occlumency classes had made him vulnerable to it. The problems in his mind weren't getting any better, the nightmares and sudden feelings of hate and anger not entirely his own ever present, and yet he refused to swallow his pride and return to Snape. Even if what he did wasn't his fault, why it happened certainly was.
Harry liked the feeling. His trousers felt tight again, and his Monster had an idea. He pulled the fingers out Draco’s mouth, wiping his saliva on Draco’s robes, which he then pulled off him in one fluid motion, before turning him around again forcefully. Draco looked at him, hatred and fear in his eyes, his lips moist and pink.
“Yeah…me too…” Harry said, glancing at Snape, who seemed like he wanted to say something nasty, before looking down. The lump in his throat was back, remembering the fear and pain in Draco’s eyes when the Monster forced Harry to hurt him. There was also a small part of him, the part that terrified him the most, that had enjoyed hurting Draco like that…he desperately tried to ignore that part.
The Malfoy boy choked on a scream, wrapping his arms around Crabbe’s thick neck as he was pushed, bodily, against his friend with the force of Harry’s thrusts. A fresh trickle of blood made its way down his inner thigh when Harry pulled out almost all the way, the Monster loving the shock of dark red against the pale skin. Harry vaguely wondered what Crabbe was thinking behind his frozen eyes. What was he feeling as he watched? Angry Draco was being hurt? Scared he would be hurt too? Aroused? The thought made the Monster chuckle.
He stood up, grabbing his invisibility cloak from where he’d left it over the back of the sofa. Draco followed him to where the door had appeared in the previously blank wall and they both got under Harry’s cloak, heading down to the Slytherin dungeons. They didn’t speak, sneaking through the corridors and down the stairs. They had to stay close together under the cloak to make sure it covered them both fully. Harry could hear Draco’s teeth chattering in the silence of the corridor, and resisted a strange urge to put his arm around him.
“I knew something was wrong… Something in his eyes…” he trailed off, shaking his head. “Are they handling it? The teachers?” he asked. Blaise shrugged.
Slowly, he lowered himself so their lips were close, looking into Draco's eyes. Then they kissed, properly, their lips warm together. Draco's mouth fell open in a moan and Harry licked into him, slowly, their fingers interlacing and squeezing tight. "Th-thank you..." Draco said when they parted, and Harry smiled.
The gift from Narcissa was a beautifully illuminated tome of potions, dating back centuries, which was completely perfect, and a set of crystal and copper measuring apparatus. Obviously his mother knew potions was his passion, and he seemed pleased by the items, but the sadness and slight anger he felt was clear as day.
“S-somewhere to fuck…” Draco ground out, tears rolling down his heated face. Harry swore and forced him to pace back and forth three times in front of the blank wall, thinking the extremely embarrassing request over and over.
"Well, they won't hurt him, will they?" He asked, emphatically. "You're both too… too charmed by him, or something - like those fucking Veela things. He's got you both in the palm of his hand, playing his wounded little bird act-" Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron ploughed through. "I know he's been abused, I understand you feel sorry for him - I do, too - but the fact is that he has done some horrible things, to us and to other people - and I don't mean just at the Manor. I mean… he let Death Eaters into the school. He bloody almost
Blaise swore softly, his worry increasing. Thinking a moment, he looked for Draco's towel but found it missing too. The Prefects' Bathroom, of course... He had been going there a lot since he came back to the dormitory last week, it was quiet there. Blaise pulled on some jeans and a jumper, grabbing his own wand before leaving the dormitory and common room, making his way up to the fifth floor. It was late enough to not worry too much about Filch being around, but the ghosts, and most especially Peeves, would be particularly abundant.
“Before…you weren’t you. Your eyes were…were like his…” he spoke softly, barely more than a whisper, but the words hit Harry’s ears like a foghorn. He knew who he meant, and it terrified him. “Don’t…come near me anymore, Potter…please…” he looked at him now, finally, his eyes so empty and tired that Harry wanted to cry. He just nodded and Draco lay down on his bed, closing his eyes. Harry left the Slytherin dungeon, and went up to the Great Hall for dinner, repairing his glasses and covering his bruises with a glamour spell on the way.
They went up to the seventh floor in a cloud of self-absorbed celebration, passing hundreds of sour-faced students, particularly Ravenclaws, as they went. There was alcohol, smuggled in from Hogsmead most likely, and music and so much noise. Harry drank a lot, more than he usually did, and ended up kissing Ginny. It was a mistake, stupid. They hadn't kissed in weeks, barely spoke, Harry had lived in fear of himself and the Monster inside him, guilt tearing him apart. Ginny had wanted to go upstairs, pulling at his sleeves and giving him her bright smile and wanting eyes. But he pulled away, feeling sick and hateful and
“Dr…Draco…?” Harry gasped, watching the blood and come pooling horrifically on the ground beneath him. Draco’s hands were still against the wall, his head down, his knees having buckled and brought him to an almost prayer-like position.
Harry leaned over Draco, who had a hand over his mouth to muffle his own moans, and kissed him again, gently moving his wrist away. He made a decision and slowly pressed one of his own fingers inside Draco. The Malfoy moaned into the kiss, his whole body jerking, his insides twitching and tightening. It was very hot inside him, and very tight despite the generous amount of lube. Draco withdrew his own finger, the sensation becoming too much for him to handle, and Harry replaced it with another of his own, then a third, sinking them as deep as they would go, twisting and stretching. Draco came again as Harry fingered him, his insides clenching around Harry’s digits incredibly, and made him instantly want to be inside him.
They were just leaving the Great Hall, full of breakfast and making plans to go to the library to do homework, when Draco suddenly froze, Blaise almost walking into him.
He looked at Draco to see him doing the same, his hand absently touching the soft fabric of the quilt.
talking to you." He said, and Draco obeyed, fixing his gaze on Ron's freckled face. Quietly, Harry and Hermione joined Luna on the other sofa.
“No, don't worry. Ron wouldn't understand at all, I wouldn't even want to tell him, honestly.” he said. Draco smirked slightly and nodded.
The morning passed extremely slowly, not helped by the fact that Harry constantly had the urge to attack Draco whenever the other boy made the slightest sound on the other side of the room. He truly didn’t want to hurt Draco again, but fighting the Monster’s wishes was becoming increasingly more difficult.
"At.. at least then it was my doing, I had control over it..." He said quietly, sitting down on one of the stone benches lining the wall to pull his socks on. The bottoms of them were dirty, despite Draco owning at least 3 pairs of expensive slippers. The storm-cloud eyes were perpetually downcast, shoulders tensed and high around his neck, like he feared an attack at any moment.
