He didn’t tell anyone about the pain that time, didn’t make a fuss.
“How did it go again?” Ron asks.
The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them and if that wasn’t bad enough, he realised he wasn’t the only one who noticed the distinct lack of venom attached to them. Amusement maybe. Fondness.
And Harry, to Draco’s immense surprise and consternation, burst out laughing. “Oh my god. I immediately take back calling you clever.

“A week tomorrow.”
“Oh, um…” Hermione starts clicking her fingers, face screwed up trying to remember, “…something, something man with a scar...”

Harry laughed softly, running his hands back down to Draco’s, intertwining their fingers and urging him forward until there was very little space between them at all. Harry brushed his lips, so
And so it was that instead of calling Malfoy a posh twat or laughing in his face or telling him his hair looked stupid, Harry found his hand - acting quite separately from the rest of his body and most certainly his brain - reaching towards Malfoy, who had shifted inexplicably closer. Harry’s fingers stretched and he watched them rise and push themselves through Malfoy’s pleasantly soft white-blond locks, giving them a rather affectionate ruffle.
“Explains why I didn’t get a single bloody thank you for the sandwiches.” Harry takes the piece of paper, trying not to hang on to Malfoy when their fingers brush. “Thanks.” Malfoy hasn’t just written their numbers down, he’s annotated his thoughts around each entry like

In the few seconds it took for Ron to reach them, Harry saw a mixture of frustration and annoyance flash across Malfoy’s face before he pulled it into a calm sneer. Harry thought there might have been a trace of something else there too, something he wouldn’t allow his brain to put a name to, that softened Malfoy’s features for the last second they were alone.

Harry’s face did something complicated then, and if Draco wasn’t having a very minor hysterical breakdown then he might have said that Harry actually looked
“Just trust me.”
Harry immediately sprinted to his side.
Lucius spun and clicked his heels and did an incredibly majestic spin.
All the while, Draco began visibly shaking with excitement. “ARE WE GOING TO UNCLE WILLY’S?!!!!!!!” he exclaimed.
“Well,
Loquacious Lucius’ face scrunched up. “Willy, I’m disgusted - chocolate mush is an ancient family recipe, passed down by generations, and you're having a powdered up, wig-wearing slave make it? This is a disgrace! I’d rather a filthy half-blood peasant like Potter make it than that thing you call your girlfriend.”
After class, Harry stopped by his room to put on a new robe.  When he turned around though, Draco was leaning sexily in the doorway.
Malfoy stood up, dusted himself off, and walked back to his desk. Harry followed. Lupin shoved Rowan Atkinson back into the crusty gym bag and struggled to zip it shut. After an uncomfortably long wrestling match (which Lupin won in the end - but only just),  he wiped his brow and asked, “Who’s next?”
They paused and kissed again, their tongues battling for dominance. However, Willy’s tongue had a gun and shot Dobilina’s tongue, winning dominance once and for all. Then, they gently pillaged each other’s mouths like ethically-responsible Vikings. Willy plundered for treasure in the crevices of Dobilina’s molars. It was beautiful.
“I promise to keep my mouf, Norf and Souf, shut!”
The halls were covered with that famous Hogwarts goo that always coated every surface of the school after the day after a House Elf Banger. Being 11:27am and 32 seconds, it was exactly the scheduled time that Harry and Draco set aside to scowl at each other before Potions class. Both Draco and Harry warmed up their mouths as they walked over, twisting and smushing their voluptuous, fish-like lips together, each preparing for a scowl that would make Clint Eastwood blush.
Harry gulped trying to hide his attraction to Draco’s shapely gnome-stompers.

“Okay class, today we’re going to be going over Blowgarts. Does anyone know what a Blowgart is?” Lupin looked out towards the class. One lone hand waved wildly, slapping every student within a 2 foot radius of her desk. “Yes, Hermione.”
Lacustrine Lucius spooned the brown goop into his mouth. A single tear trailed down his cheek. “It tastes just like Mother’s.”
Lucius was shouting, sending strings of spittle towards Harry, as his head hung towards the floor. “You imbecile! Sixty-nine bathrooms, and you somehow managed to clog
After a long, uncomfortable pause, Draco looked at Harry.  His wand was 11 inches (“nice and supple” he noted) and he had awe-inspiring, glistening pecs. Draco tried to hide his arousal the best he could and said, “Potter! Why aren’t you wearing anything under your robes?!”
Everyone got up and walked out of the living room and through the two-foot-tall door. Lucius followed close behind Dobilina and whispered in her ear as they approached the Masturbation Mobile, a vehicle that would whisk them away on the fifteen-foot journey to the dining room, “You may have everyone else fooled, but I know who you

Harry, who was sitting two seats down, began to sweat in fear. Just thirty minutes after his first nearly sexual suicide, and he was already in another precarious sexual situation!
“Oh those?” she answered flippantly. “When I was meditating earlier, I realized those actually weren’t related to you at all - those deaths would’ve occurred if
“Everything’s gonna be okay, I know Wizard first-aid - I’ll get him up and walking in a few minutes.” Harry flipped open his Sabrina the Teenage Witch plastic watch. “The time is 0900 hours, and the patient seems responsive. Narcissa, get me a penis of newt. Draco, find me a moose knuckle, finely packed. Don’t worry, Lucius - we’ll get through this.”
His nips pebbled in fear and anticipation.
Harry’s shoulders fell in relief. Though he was 18 and definitely totally legal, the Dursleys had definitely never taught him about puberty. “Thank goodness! For a while there, I thought I’d be doomed to absolutely tragic sex for the rest of my relatively-short life.” He took the pamphlet and began paging through before remembering something.  Harry stiffened. “But what about the two deaths?
Luxurious Lucius and Willy crossed their arms and looked off in opposite directions. Like two sides of a flamboyant, Wizarding coin (like a knut or some shit).  Dobilina came back after a few minutes, spooning a bit of the sticky, putrid ooze onto everyone's plate.

Potter loves the food and tells Draco that they need to come back immediately so he can try everything else. They muddle through the rest of the interview questions, Potter making jokes and scribbling down answers and doodling all over the place, pestering Draco to answer questions of his own. It’s wonderful and easy and Draco doesn’t really want him to go back to work or to go home himself, not alone at least.
Well I’m not sure I see what the problem is really
Potter convinces him to stay for a bit while he eats his omelette, and it’s not that late really so Draco kicks off his shoes and sits as upright as he possibly can on top of the covers on Potter’s bed because it’s either that or the floor and he doesn’t want to make it weird even though inside he’s thinking
He’s going to come. He’s going to come in his pants like a horny teenager. And somewhere the tiny, rational part of his brain that’s hanging on for dear life is shouting

It’s not ideal, of course. Thinking about Potter while he’s lying in his own urine, scared out of his fucking mind, but there he is anyway. Unbidden and distinct.
And brilliant. Really brilliant. He didn’t want it to end. He wanted Potter’s leg nudging up against him all the time. He wanted to try more of Luna’s weird drinks with Potter. He wanted to spoon and watch bake off. And kiss him, soft and sweet, hard and vicious. He wanted all of it.
“I’m still sorry I didn’t tell you,” Draco murmured, his voice muffled somewhat by Harry’s feathery black hair.

It was different after that; civility turned into friendly small talk which in turn grew into something not altogether unpleasant. Granger was a brilliant conversationalist and Weasley was a bit of a hilarious gossip once he was on his second glass of champagne. And Potter…confused him.
Potter huffed out a laugh but his cheeks pinked up a bit anyway.
He really should’ve just hexed himself in the face earlier.
Why would someone do that?” Why indeed? Harry doesn’t have a clue why he did it in the first place, why he’s carried on doing it. “They must just be...really popular.”

Malfoy stills, his hand still held out between them, offering up the peach. His cheeks start to flush a lovely Gryffindor red and Harry realises what he’s done. He hasn’t thought those words, he’s said them, out loud. In a strange, predatory come-hither voice that he barely recognises as his own. To Malfoy. Who isn’t moving, or saying anything, or doing anything but staring at Harry.
Potter’s eyes are the same as they’d always been really, disarmingly bright and beautiful. Draco finds he can’t look at them too long lest he give himself away. At least Potter’s hair has always been a chaotic disaster, perhaps a small comfort can be found there.

Harry’s placing one of Malfoy’s many pillows in the middle of the bed and desperately trying not to touch his cock when Malfoy returns from his bathroom. He presses a small vial of lube into Harry’s hand and shifts back onto the bed.
Why are you so sure he’s going to hate you?
The next day, there are more peaches in the canteen. Harry is in the lunch queue holding a tray that consists of a plate of greyish melange with orange bits that he suspects is supposed to be the ‘Shepherd’s Pie’ listed on the lunch board. He spots the wire basket of peaches near the till and scowls. He’s already noticed Malfoy several people behind him in the queue, empty tray in hand, eyeing up the melange on offer with a wrinkled nose. Without thinking about it, Harry gives his hand a quick flourish and wandlessly vanishes the peaches. He pays for his food, noting with smug satisfaction that nobody has noticed they’re gone and takes a seat by himself.
Draco pretends to look offended. “Neither.

Draco’s eyes fluttered open and he frowned. “What are you—“

Draco leaned in too, feeling deeply gratified when Potter didn’t immediately pull away.
Harry doesn’t need to stay here for this. He’s mostly finished the Shepherds Pie which he suspects is the root cause of the uncomfortable gurgling occurring in his belly and he really ought to get stuck into writing up the case report for that...case. But he is entitled to an hour for lunch, and Hermione is always telling him to take proper breaks so he remains seated, watching Malfoy walk to a table of his own.

Harry’s not sure he ever wants to let go and thinks about staying exactly where they are, hands firm and steady on Malfoy’s perfect arse as they rub up against each other, desperate and needy in the hallway until they both come.

When Harry nuzzles into the crease of his arse, he murmurs a charm and Malfoy flinches against him, relaxing again when Harry presses his lips to the base of his spine, his tongue dipping teasingly lower.

Potter waves a hand at him and smiles politely. “Oh, no thank you. Just some water and two glasses would be great if you don’t mind.”

The history of the Hogwarts Independent School has indeed been a competitive one, though I sincerely doubt the founders of the original school intended for there to be such rivalry between the former “houses” or that we’d ever need to expand into the four separate schools we know today as the result of the growing population in the area.

[20:16] It’s as if you’re reading my mind!
It’s awkward, clinging to each other as much as possible as they stumble along, neither one willing to break apart for the sake of a few feet to get inside Malfoy’s flat. It’s only when Harry hears a door kicked shut and something solid pressed against his back that he even realises they’ve made it in. Malfoy’s hands are working at the buttons of his jacket, pushing it off his shoulders and Harry reluctantly lets go of him so he can shrug it off, fling it aside.

Draco ignored the unbearably smug look that Potter sent his way and focused instead on the cafe counter, Luna busying herself behind it, wondering what concoction she would bring them. Something about her demeanour told him to be prepared for anything. How did Potter know her? Did she go to Griffin as well? More likely The Huff, she seemed like the fluffy, artsy type. He’d only ever seen Potter with Weasley, mostly because of football, and Hermione Granger, who was far too clever to be friends with either of them. He never could quite figure that one out, and suddenly felt a desire to ask, to

Harry returns to the training room with his arms full of sandwiches and dressed in fitted jeans with a soft, dark green jumper. It’s cashmere, and probably one of the nicest things he owns. He actually feels quite fancy in it. The green also happens to make his eyes pop. Or something. That’s what Hermione says anyway.
Draco had often let himself daydream of what his animagus form would be. During first year, watching Professor McGonagall turn herself into a cat and back again, he decided quite vehemently that he was going to be a dragon. Like his namesake. He was going to be huge and powerful and everyone would be scared of him. Especially Cassius Warrington. He’d breathe fire at Cassius Warrington. He’d make Cassius Warrington cry, just like he’d made Theo cry. (Though when he’d told Theo this, Theo had glared at him, and said that he hadn’t cried at all. Draco was being stupid. “Besides,” he’d sniffed, “it’s not like you actually get to

But he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about seeing Cedric Diggory’s body. He’d never seen a dead body before. And this was Cedric Diggory. Hogwarts Champion. Impossibly handsome and charming and kind. He’d even smiled at Draco once, though it was quite possible he’d imagined it. And now he was dead, supposedly by the Dark Lord’s hand, if Potter was to be believed.

Harry is pressed right up against Malfoy on a high-backed bench in meeting room five because they were some of the last to arrive and there’s limited seating. Malfoy, to his credit and Harry’s immense frustration, looks completely at ease as he crosses one long elegant leg over the other and chats amiably to the wizard on his other side. Ron is squashed in on the end, grumbling about the complimentary buffet.

Neville appeared beside him, looking like he really didn’t need an answer at all, so Draco just shook his head and quietly ate the rest of his food as they went to find somewhere to stand.
Under the table, Potter nudged at him with his knee. Draco looked up at Luna and nodded vehemently, feeling a strange little swell of contentment when her smile grew impossibly wider. Pleased, she left them alone as a customer headed towards the counter. Draco watched Potter pick up a spoon and pull his drink towards him.
Harry turned his head, just enough so that he could kiss the underside of Draco’s jaw. “
Harry reaches out to stop him, pushing encouragingly on Malfoy’s hip. “On your front.” Malfoy’s eyes widen slightly when he sees Harry toss the vial onto the bed, so Harry kisses him. “Please?”
Hermione turns to Ron. “Remember that one who wore the t-shirt with Harry’s face on it?”
It was lit up on the inside, emitting a warm and cosy glow onto the darkened streets. Draco was also quite relieved to see it looking relatively empty for a late Friday afternoon. Maybe he wouldn’t head back to school straight away; maybe he would stay and sit for a little while, read one of the many old tattered books left behind by other customers. He definitely wouldn’t re-read (for the umpteenth time) any of the –

from the injury, the shock, the blood loss. Because surely that was the only explanation for The Event That Followed, which was this: Draco grabbed for Potter’s hand, and Potter had just...let him. More than that, he felt Potter’s thumb briefly skate over his knuckles, just once back and forth, but somehow it was enough to cause Draco’s body to relax, just a fraction.
Draco came to an abrupt stop, suddenly furious with himself for running away.
“You do, hm?”
“Oh I bloody well know exactly who it is,” Harry huffs. “It’s Akilah and Bertram.”
You can’t honestly think that will work
Harry does. Malfoy watches him, sitting upright on the edge of his bed, long legs dangling. This, more than anything else they’ve done so far, feels the most intimate and Harry can feel his face warm, feeling shy. Still, he’s rather pleased to see Malfoy’s cock start to fill out again when he’s down to just his underwear. He hooks his thumbs over the waistband before Malfoy stops him.

“No,” Draco said, quick and certain and a tiny bit desperate. He absolutely did not want Harry to leave, even if he felt like his heart was beating so hard it was a small wonder it didn’t just burst straight through his ribs and smack Harry right in his lovely face.
For a moment neither of them move. Then Harry stalks forward out of the lift and Malfoy is on him before the doors ding shut.
Harry takes Malfoy’s cock deep into his mouth and pulls off torturously slow. Harry feels a shift on the bed and looks up; Malfoy has propped himself up, eyes unyielding as he licks his lips, watching Harry take his cock deep into the wet heat of his mouth. Harry pulls off, slow and deliberate, his eyes never leaving Malfoy’s.

“Please, Harry,” Malfoy moaned, and Harry hummed against the blonde’s length, which only made him moan again and arch his hips. Harry took the opportunity to push a finger into Malfoy, and then another, curling them up into Malfoy’s body. Malfoy rocked himself on Harry’s fingers and Harry knew he had found the blonde’s prostate when the man let out a loud, low moan and tangled his fingers tightly in Harry’s hair.

“I think you should leave that poor girl alone, Edward. You’ve put her through quite enough,” Pansy sniffed, straightening out and making her way down the beach. Teddy followed along like a puppy, huffing in irritation at the use of his full first name. Pansy smirked.
Two months into the term and things were going surprisingly well. Harry and Malfoy didn’t talk much, and he actually somehow saw very little of the blonde despite all the classes and the room they shared. It was weird, but not unpleasant. Malfoy was quiet, withdrawn. It bothered Harry a little to not see the fire he was used to stoking in the taller man, but he always reminded himself that it could be worse. They could have punched or hexed each other by now.
“No? It felt pretty simple to me.”
“Did you know daddy too?” the boy whispered, and Harry chuckled.
The cloak was the same rose pink as the heels on Malfoy’s feet. The shoes weren’t quite as tall as the last two pairs Harry had seen and the heel was a little thicker, though not the least bit chunky. Very thin straps sat close together and covered almost all of Malfoy’s foot horizontally. The straps were connected by a vertical strap that ran up the middle of his foot and then looped around his ankle before curving over the back of his heel to connect to the sole of the shoe once more. Despite how cold it was outside at this time of year, the tips of Malfoy’s toes were visible, revealing magenta painted toenails. As Malfoy descended the stairs, Harry could just make out long, pointed fingernails that had been painted the same color.
When Draco had taken over the hotel, he had begged and pleaded with Gregory Goyle to come run his kitchen. Nearly two decades later and Greg would always insist he came and stayed for Lily,

The two women had chatted amongst themselves on the trip over, but then they sailed through a shimmering anti-muggle barrier and silence descended as the island began to rise up before them.
“Just remember you have to room with him for another semester,” Hermione whispered, and Harry flushed even deeper. He had been doing that a lot lately.

“Charlie, are you my father?” Lily whispered too.
“What did you do?” Harry directed his question to Teddy, who gaped and immediately pointed his finger at Lily.
“In the morning. We should get to the docks by seven so we can greet him before Dad does.”
“Uh, well, it’s Charlie Weasley and Harry Potter.”
The dragon reared back at her sudden appearance, sparks of electricity disconnecting from its body and sparking against the wall. Rock and ice began to fall, its shatter echoing throughout the cave. Lily stood her ground, raising both hands up to show the dragon she came without anything with which to attack. Her heart was pounding, her stomach fluttering, her hands beginning to sweat – it was always nerve wracking every first approach, no matter how many years she had been doing this. Slowly, carefully, Lily dropped down to one knee and dropped her head.

“No, we do not,” Pansy said sternly.
It had been a while since Harry had properly spent time with Teddy, and he decided then that he would make plans with the young man when they both got back to England, but Greg’s words kept rolling in his mind and so he sat down on the dock beside Lily.

“Do you remember all those half-written letters he never sent when we were in training?”
“Writing. Put it in writing.”
While Daphne and Pansy were settling into their rooms, Draco was helping to get the rooms on the opposite side of the hotel ready for their guests. They were expecting well over two hundred people for the wedding, all told, and Draco was beginning to regret not taking Pansy up on her offer to invest. What he wouldn’t give for a full staff, right now. A chattering from above pulled his attention from his thoughts and Draco looked up at the tall, gray bird perched on the wall across from the room he was about to step into.
Five years ago, Lily’s desire to see her friends happy together may have been a little Hufflepuff, but the way she had gotten Teddy and Vic together – first by talking up the Yule Ball, then by somehow convincing everyone but Teddy to be conveniently unable to ask Vic to be their date, and then by making sure Vic looked like an actual goddess and ensuring Teddy got her specific flowers that conveyed he was ready to worship her – was definitely Slytherin. By virtue of growing up as Lily’s cousin and being involved with Draco after the man and his mother rekindled a relationship with Andromeda, Teddy felt like he had gotten to know Theo pretty well over the years.
You meet me at the lifts. I would have taken the stairs to avoid this, but my legs are too weak. Everything hurts. I’m grieving. I’m fucking grieving for you when you’re right fucking next to me. I wonder if you’re grieving for me too.
“Just go talk to him,” Daphne said, sighing at how childish her friend was being about all this. They were
“Is she really Harry’s?”
“Why did I ever let you go?” Benny squawked with such vehemence, Draco was sure Benny had been conspiring against him from the beginning.
Malfoy keened, trying to pull Harry back down, but Harry managed to evade his grasp. He grasped Malfoy’s legs and pulled them from behind him. Malfoy looked up at him and a brief moment of panic flashed across his face, but then Harry just pulled his shirt over his head and Malfoy’s gaze brightened again as he drank in Harry’s broad, brown chest. He’d filled out more since the long year in Dean’s Forest, no longer the scrawny starved boy of his youth. Malfoy reached out, slowly running his hands across Harry’s taut abdomen and then up over the defined muscles of his chest and across his broad shoulders. Harry let out a gentle sigh and then leaned back down, placing a soft kiss against Malfoy’s lips.
Draco was hiding something. He cursed himself for letting himself get distracted that morning. And then suddenly, the Taverna felt too warm, everyone was much too close, and Charlie was spinning on his heel and darting for the closest exit before Lily could stop him.

What is there to investigate exactly?
Draco sighed, his shoulders sagging in defeat as he turned around. “Nev, I really don’t want to talk ab-“ He stopped, his body still half-turned as his gaze locked onto a pair of unflinching green eyes staring right back at him in the semi-darkness.
[04:23] I hope this doesn’t wake you up
Very carefully, Harry stepped closer. “Do you want me to go?” He asked.
[10:20] Almost Slytherin of you
[00:14] I wouldn’t exactly call you selfish
Another small kiss, reassuring and sweet, like it was something Harry did all the time without even thinking about it.

With a flutter in his chest, Draco remembers that he has only mentioned that place to Potter once.

Luna clapped her hands together and grinned. “Isn’t it festive?!”

[12:41] Hahaha
There’s a lift that takes Harry up to Malfoy’s flat which is on the top floor, because of course it is. He feels like his entire body is thrumming with anticipation as he steps in and it crosses his mind that maybe he should come up with some sort of plan.
“Well I do actually

[23:56] Fuck off

“Don’t think you’re getting out of this, Malfoy.” Ah, back to Malfoy again. That was reassuringly hostile, even if Potter didn’t sound so in his inflection. “If I have to drink whatever the fuck this is then you do too.”
“What?”
[13:15] Most people just use my surname
[21:42] You know what I mean
Draco knew he’d be playing a dangerous game with himself if he read anything into this...well, whatever this was. It was all starting to feel a bit like a date. Which was stupid. He and Potter sat here together trying to consume Luna’s sugary madness, sharing little lingering, smiley looks and nudging each other under the table, egging each other on.
” Harry breathed, lips grazing overly-sensitive skin. He planted the softest, sweetest kiss on the tender spot and let his head rest against Draco’s shoulder.
[20:34] Why?
Potter’s photo isn’t anything spectacular and privately Draco actually thinks the photo of Weasley has turned out objectively better: his hair had photographed incredibly well, contrasting perfectly with icy blue of his eyes as he stared directly into the camera, unsmiling. It’s intense and moody, the swirls of a scar stark against freckled skin, tendrils of damaged tissue winding up his arm and snaking over his shoulder. He looks fierce and wild and dangerous, and Draco feels a lovely twist of pride at how it’s come out. He’s not quite sure what the creative team of

Harry slid out of Draco and Draco almost sagged from the loss of Harry's legs holding him up; he clutched the sink for a moment before he could stand on his own, reaching down with one shaky hand to pull his trousers up. Harry had made swift work of his, and was washing his hands; he caught Draco's eye in the mirror and smirked.
"Hi," said Harry first, feeling a little shy.
Then another beer and another dance, and another and another until he decided that leaving the dance floor at all was stupid and just let himself move to the beat.
Several minutes passed.
& & &
"So wha…got two." For some reason, they both found that hysterical and laughed till they hiccupped helplessly, the bartender shaking his head at them in amusement. "Yeah, buh…still. Need both. So…"
He knew that Dumbledore had provided them with a new tent out of his own pocket, and that it was quite a luxurious one; he'd probably never know, since Draco seemed determined to avoid him and he doubted highly that tea and scones were in
"If he falls for Percy, he's certifiable and you're better off not knowing if he's a bottle or real blond anyway." Charlie rinsed and began shaving as Harry got into the shower and scrubbed assiduously, with soap, even.
Potter was scrawny, still, and pale, except for the brilliant red and gold of the phoenix tattoo that spread across his back, its wings raised in victory. Draco traced the outline of the bird, reading the names etched into its feathers – all the Order who had died in the pursuit of freedom. The War had been only nine years ago, but it felt like another lifetime to him and, he suspected, to Harry too.
Draco and his father did deign to eat with the rest of the family that night, as rumor had spread that Molly was cooking. They ate at the table with Dumbledore, Harry, Molly and Arthur, and various and sundry others, and when Lucius exclaimed over Molly's special chocolate lava cake, she giggled and blushed like a schoolgirl. Harry, of course, could barely keep his eyes off Draco, but was aware all evening of the death glare he was getting from Ginny. Honestly, the girl would just not give it up.
And then, maybe he'd have coffee. Yes, "coffee," in one of those charming little shops.
“Mmm…when do we leave for the honeymoon again?” Draco couldn’t stop looking at him then, either - he had never seen Harry so happy. He himself was ecstatic, but as befit a good little pureblood prince, he was keeping his cool, or trying to.
Harry blushed. "Thanks. I, uhm, like yours too.
"We'll speak when you get home." It was all he could offer, and as he ended the call and closed the phone, he wondered what in hell was going to happen to them.
Draco's hand slammed down into the table in front of him, cracking the mug - coffee ran in rivulets everywhere. "I Have Said I Was Sorry a million fucking times now! What the hell else do you want from me? Check the computer, check my mobile! I know it was wrong, and I stopped, but you keep punishing me!"
He leaned against the bar and scanned the crowd; DU was not as large as some other clubs and that was a great advantage as far as Draco was concerned. He hoped to hell that Harry was here, but he wasn't holding out much hope anymore. For weeks now, every dark head had caught his eye as had every flash of olive skin that showed ink. Even the line of the nose, the curve of the chin…
Harry shrugged. "I can imagine, yeah. It's all right, no worries.”
A round moon face, made even odder-looking by thick-lensed glasses peered out of the tent flap. "Always in motion, is the future, and even the wisest cannot tell. Also, you have frosting hanging out of your nose."
"Why are you - I'm sorry, all right? It was a stupid thing to do, I don't even know WHY I did it, it just seemed…" Draco trailed off, not sure what to say, cause he knew his actions were inexcusable and that Harry had every right to be pissed. He just had never seen this side of him.
She took a few steps down the bleacher stairs. "Harry, you can't mean that. It's always been you and I, it was destined to be!"
Up front, Dumbledore was once again whipping out his wand, and to preserve their eardrums, people quieted. "Now," he continued, "I know that many of you are concerned and feel, perhaps a bit slighted, but that is simply not the case. Their troupe is disbanding due to financial pressures, and their act needs a home. I am happy to be able to provide one and am confident," he added, his beetle-like brows furrowing ever-so-threateningly, "that you all will make them welcome in our home."
All eyes turned to where Ginny Weasley sat. She stared down at Harry, who stared back at her.
"I'm going up to bed. You coming?"
"No, you aren't." Draco stood up and took a last look in the mirror. "Fucking
“You are fucking unbelievable!” Harry had looked like he wanted to say more – much more - but the words had caught in his throat and he had swallowed and turning, grabbed his jacket and left the room. Seconds later, the crack of apparition had echoed in the foyer.
"No," said Draco hastily, and she sighed, looking between them. "Too bad, too bad; Harry has had such a crush on you for so long."
Safe in the cab, he finally shivered a bit, and remembered that Milo – Draco - had his jacket, but didn't care. It seemed a small price to pay for escape.
Draco lay there in the dark room, still sticky, still feeling Harry's heat on him, and felt, for the first time in years, tears prickle the back of his eyes.
"Can't be Harry then," said Blaise, who hadn't let go of Draco. "Harry has all the grace of a Hippogriff in heat on the dance floor."
"Looking for adventure?" Fuck, his voice was squeaking; it hadn't squeaked since he was twelve!
& & &
When he opened his eyes, Harry was staring at him and when he spoke, his voice was quiet again. "You don't need to apologize – hell, it wasn't you, after all. And it's nice of you to try to encourage me. I appreciate it."
“Thanks, Sev - I’ll let you know when I find him.”
Harry's eyes were fixed on him, and Draco was proud of himself for not looking away or down or fidgeting.
& & &
Pansy obviously did not want to 'let it go,' but for once she listened to Blaise who made a mental note to write it on his calendar under the heading of "Armageddon - It's Coming."
"Because I just would, all right? I told you I was in the same predicament and I am and I know how stupid *I* am and I can gather from what you're saying that your Draco and I are just a little too fucking similar for words." He was breathing heavily now, his breath coming in short, staccato bursts. He reached for his ale and drained half of it.
"Whatever." Draco sounded bored and irate, and was. He hated that they had had to join up with a decidedly low-rent (by the looks) enterprise and even more, that he and his father would share billing with those bloody Weasleys who were really no more than a bunch of over-bred monkeys. He trudged along behind Harry, hoping that the wind was wafting upwards 'cause damn that boy smelled ripe.
"Hmm." Harry was pondering, then brightened. "And is it true that certain, erm, substances are also legal there?"
Harry let himself be pulled along. They had a future? Since when? This was all news to him.
Later, lying there dazed and panting, Draco wondered how many passers-by had heard their moans, whimpers, or his own outright yelps as they made their way to the market, or work, or the nearby school to pick up their children. Or how many children had heard the filthy, awful things they had called each other during their sweaty entanglement -  each of the four times they'd gone. And frankly, he thought if the leather of that jacket wasn't 'seasoned' by now, it never would be.
"Please, don't. Don't leave me Harry, please."
After a few more items of business, the meeting broke up, Harry making his escape quickly before Molly could expound on testicular rashes. He suspected that Filch had been fiddling with the gunpowder again and Harry was merely having a bad reaction to it, but one never knew. So he used the ointment and kept quiet.
The next two nights went pretty much the same way; they talked, though not as intensely as they had the first night, and played billiards or darts, or even pinball, and drank. The night after that, they went to dinner. Draco had asked Harry this time, who had agreed, then, somewhat nervously asked if this was a 'date."
The number scrolled by in the call log,  but Harry wasn't even registering it any more. He shut the mobile off and flipped it shut, setting it down where it had been.
lines. After an involuntary grunt, a large lump of mottled cat would land squarely on his bladder, making him groan. He would pet the cat, a stray who had taken a shine to him one day as Harry made his way home from the liquor store, and who, like him, was content to live on scotch and Cheez-Its – this being the best of all possible food-like combinations in Harry's expert opinion.
"Really? Wow. I am a dedicated employee." Harry nodded. "But fine, I'll clear up my files and go in a few days."
Almost.
When he was finished with Hagrid, he retired to his "room" in the Weasley family tent; magic was a lovely thing, he thought, and not for the first time. The outside looked like an army surplus pup tent, while inside housed six bedrooms, two baths and a gourmet kitchen for Molly. Harry had his own room; being an orphan and frankly " a bit of an odd boy, really, Merlin bless him," had gotten him that, although Ron complained bitterly of being stuck with Percy, and Ginny, of course, got her own room. Harry was grateful for the privacy, even more so as they grew older, as it gave him a quiet place to wank, and not incidentally, a place to hide his issues of "Magic Monthly," which often featured a certain blond duo; a duo which Harry was anxious to make acquaintance with.
Harry returned the smile. "I have a long list of pleasures." This was true, and he had the scroll with same tucked into his back pocket.
"Sir, some people just can't get it up." The clerk could have been reciting Keats. "Again, if that is your situation, we do have specialists that can aid you in your quest for release."
Harry looked at the phone in his hand. "I might. Why?"
Second chances.
"Last night, this morning! "Are you almost done?" What the hell?"
“Whether I
"That would be excellent – could we just meet at a pub?" He had given this man his actual name, which was unusual enough. He wasn't ready to have anyone know where he lived.
"Oh well then, throw the bastard out by all means, since he had the temerity to cut his hair! Damn him all to hell." Blaise tried hard not to laugh and Pansy smirked. Draco scowled.
"That's Draco. He gets whatever he wants, however he wants it; and too fucking bad if it's not what I want too. Nothing matters as long as he gets his." Harry was unconsciously clenching his fist and had to pause and relax his fingers, flexing them.
Harry shifted in his seat. "If it's about switching the office coffee to decaf, sir, all I can say is that you've never had to work with Adams when he's on a caffeine blitz? It's like being partnered with a Cornish pixie on acid."
“It’s good to see you again, Nico,” Charlie piped up.
“No, Uncle Theo, it’s–”
“It’s only been two weeks, Vic. Surely you can live without me for that long.”
“No, he–”
“Mrs. Malfoy.” This island seemed to have
” a loud melodious squawk saved Harry from what was sure to be a
“I should not have let you go,” Benny crooned quite loudly then. Draco could feel his entire face flushing in response.
“I’m sorry,” Charlie said gently, frowning. Lily just nodded, not sure what else to say. Charlie seemed to be fighting with himself to say something though; Lily waited. Finally, Charlie sighed and dropped his hand away. “I went to the sanctuary in Romania right after I graduated Hogwarts. There was an old Amphiptere there that I was tasked with taking care of.”
~ ~ ~
Charlie’s mouth dropped open, his mind whirling as his thoughts slid into place. He had been so
I tear my gaze away and address your lawyer instead. If I keep looking at you, I’ll back down. I’ll drag this out and neither of us want that. You should be getting on with your life, should be getting on with him. I won’t be the one to hold you back anymore. I can’t be.
As Draco stepped back into the taverna, he was greeted with the incredibly fast-paced, frantic music of his childhood. He loved ABBA. He had never been more pleased to pass that love for the 70s band to his daughter. But something about this music in this situation just seemed too much like déjà vu. Not for the first time, Draco wondered if Lily might be trying to Mamma Mia her wedding after all. But no, no one could be that ridiculous. Especially not a Malfoy. Rather than dwelling on it, he happily accepted the vibrantly pink drink Pansy pushed into his hands instead.
“Truth or dare, Harry?” Parvati broke through his thoughts. He realized he was staring at Malfoy’s feet and flushed a bright red as he tore his gaze away and realized that everyone was watching him with various stages of amusement. Malfoy was looking directly at him with an expression Harry simply couldn’t interpret.
“You’re an adult now, Lily. You have the right to know your lineage and seek out your family. If you want to know your roots, then I’ll help you find them. I’m on your side now.”
I am so so sorry for how long this has taken! I’m in the middle of a divorce, and an opportunity came up to get me out of my cohabitation situation so I ended up very suddenly moving 2 states away in only 3 weeks. It’s been a long few months. I’m settled now, and I just got a new computer, so I’m hoping to have much more regular updates from here on out! Thank you all for bearing with me. No lemon this chapter like I hoped (the muses had other plans), but please enjoy a very lengthy story to make up for it.
“And maybe I was hoping I might find something about my other dad,” Lily admitted sheepishly. Victoire rolled her eyes and Teddy smiled at her sadly.
Drama became second nature again, albeit this time without the evil and darkness. And naturally, Lily took after her dad. So by the time the week of her wedding rolled around, Greg was
“Three years.”
“I didn’t know you still worked here,” Harry blurted out, halting Draco’s progress out of the room. Draco scoffed.
“You’re best friends. Doesn’t that go against everything your family stands for?”
He barely had time to say hello to the rapidly approaching women before they were both throwing themselves at him, wrapping their arms around him and squeezing him tight. They were acting as though they hadn’t seen him in years, despite having seen him months ago. Though, with everything going on, he supposed he hadn’t had time to floo them as regularly as he usually did. The women stepped back, both holding him at arm’s length so they could look at him as much as he was scrutinizing them.
“And again two years ago when Ginny asked for a divorce?” Hermione just nodded. “You were so worried about him. Not the way we were. But for a different reason. I could tell.”
“No, but when I was looking through some boxes in the basement, I found some information,” she started lightly. “I think I might have figured it out.”
Their fathers were friends since school, so when Draco said he and Theo had been friends since they were wee babes, he meant it. Their mothers shared pregnancy woes. They often shared a crib and as they got older, a governess. Theo knew everything without Draco having to say a word, even when they were in a fight and not speaking, so Draco was sure his friend knew he was lying and had simply decided to accept it out of respect. Draco, understanding his friend had a lot to lose if he chose to associate with the Malfoys, never pushed the topic.
“And a proper Slytherin he is, too,” Vic chimed in, grinning wide at them. Harry smiled at her.
Harry let his gaze travel slowly up Malfoy’s body, over his long legs and sharp hips, over his flat abdomen and lean chest and sharp shoulders. His eyes paused briefly over the faded Dark Mark, but he had grown quite used to seeing it over last semester and he quickly drew his eyes away to dance along Malfoy’s pronounced collar bone and his long pale neck before meeting the blonde’s darkening gaze.
“Actually, about that,” Teddy started, running his hand through his hair. It was a nervous tick he had picked up from Harry. Victoire was looking at Teddy with a narrowed gaze and Lily was looking at the ground, a flush creeping up her face. The expression reminded Harry a lot of Ginny, back when they were in school.
“Yes!”
“Oh no way,” he said, grinning wide. “We use your Guérir moisturizer line on the sanctuary to help with healing burns. It prevents a lot of scarring.” Daphne’s cheeks flushed a little deeper and Charlie’s smile grew.
“Not all of them, just Geronimo,” he told her. Lily felt her heart drop.
- - -
“‘Moine, what’s going on?”
“Why are you here, Nott? Because it doesn’t sound like it’s for Lily.”
“Hi, Geronimo,” Lily greeted the dragon softly and with a gentle whine, the dragon fell forwards until his body was pressed to the ground and his nose was pressed against Lily’s shoes. She laughed and reached out, gently stroking his head around the spikes. She cooed at him softly. “Have you been a good boy?”
The trio swayed with the music, spinning as the tempo suddenly picked up further. Draco stepped forward as Pansy and Daphne stepped back and solo, he began to sing,
“Did you–”
serious this time,” Teddy pleaded. Pansy stopped walking abruptly, the boy stumbling as he attempted not to collide with her. She whirled around to face him and crossed her arms, looking up at his towering form.
And don’t get me wrong, I am heartbroken. I’m fucking devastated. I’m losing all the best parts of me. I’m losing the love of my life. I’m losing everything that’s right with the world. I’m losing you.
“You met her?” Draco practically whispered. He really should have been surprised they hadn’t met any sooner, considering one of her best friends was his godson and her other best friend was his niece, but his heart was once again threatening to choke him as he considered the situation.
“You’re the best, Aunt Luna,” Lily said with a grin and then they were gone.
“I thought it was just…well, that doesn’t matter. Whenever you can get them to me is fine.”
This couldn’t be happening.
“Maybe,” she mumbled quietly, tapping the tip of her shoe lightly against the box that now rested safely on the floor.
“I have no idea,” Lily said slowly, a slight frown marring her face. Vic narrowed her eyes.
“Well, there’s always time to change your mind, right?” Theo’s smile seemed just a little sad again. What was it with the emotions on this island lately?
“Aha!” she cried in delight as she found what she was looking for. She plucked the cardstock from the drawer and then slammed it closed, spinning to look at her husband with a triumphant grin on her face. He looked over at her from his place by the stove, his brow raised. But just as he knew better about her tone of voice, he also knew better than to press her for answers. With a sigh, Hermione sat down at the kitchen table and kept her gaze firmly on the invitation in front of her. “Ron, there’s something I need to tell you.”
“I always have time for you, Aunt Luna,” Lily responded with a wide grin and Luna laughed, her blue eyes twinkling as she gazed back at the green face.
“It wasn’t about the gay thing. It was the Marcus thing.”
“But, uh, no, Percy won’t be there,” Charlie thankfully changed the subject. “Bill and Fleur will be though.”
Is Harry here do you mean ;-)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello,” Harry said, apropos of nothing, because Draco had a mouthful of hot cheese and ham and crêpe and his feet had somehow disconnected from his brain, rendering them useless as he stood frozen. Harry nodded once at Draco’s food. “Looks good.”

There was a long pause of silence and then Greg heard Nott release a deep sigh. From the corner of his eye, he could see the man’s entire body sag. Greg wanted to feel a little smug about it, but instead he found himself feeling a little sad for the man.
“I’ve been looking for something meaningful to have as my ‘something old,’” Lily explained. “I thought it might be nice to look through some of Dad’s family’s things.”
Lily had grown up knowing Theo, but only as a family friend. And though Draco had been certain at one point that Theo had strongly suspected he might be more related to Lily than anyone knew (including Draco because, well, he didn’t know), Theo had never said a word and Draco had never offered the information up. Lily had seen more of Theo over the years than Draco had – it was hard not to when Pansy often whisked her goddaughter away to learn how a proper London witch lived – and still, they were none the wiser.
“Right. Well. It was hard. But Geronimo is just leaving. He still has a lot of healthy years ahead of him and you are welcome to visit him in Romania any time.” Lily looked back up at him, eyes wide and mouth agape.
“I am.”
“Very well then,” Draco said, turning to quickly stuff the towels into the closet. Then he closed the doors and made a bee line for the open door.
“And why is that?”
“Shhhh!” Draco tried hushing the bird, trying to wrangle his beak closed. The bird squawked and fluttered his wings.
“Isn’t this a sweet little reunion,” Oliver said, aiming his smile at his husband. Draco looked over at his oldest friend to find the man’s gaze squarely on him. Draco smiled.
“He does,” Lily tried to save. “I guess I just haven’t heard all that much about what he was like then. Auntie Pans and Daph never mention what school used to be like and he won’t let Greg or Lavender say a word. It’s like he didn’t exist until I was born.”

“He didn’t. Adrianne left it to him,” Lavender shrugged, adjusting the basket so that it was more comfortable to trek up the stairs. Harry felt his heart twist.
The trio began to march in place, falling back in line together as they sang,
Even as others around them called for several rounds, Harry didn’t get nearly as drunk as he had during their game of truth or dare. By the time the night was winding down, he felt only a pleasant buzz steadily thrumming through his body. To be totally honest, he wasn’t sure how much of that was the two and a half beers he had had and how much of it was the blonde pressing even closer against his side as the night wore on.
“You said, ‘we,’ so who’s with you?”
“Since when does he read British papers? And did any of you ever talk to him about it?”
“Don’t call me that,” Harry snapped. Draco rolled his eyes and finally looked at him. The Gryffindor was glaring down at his hands.
His veins were on fire. His blood was burning its way through his body, lighting him up from the inside. Everything seemed to be moving too quickly and yet not fast enough all at once. He had missed this, he had missed
, but the girls all turned at the announcement and their faces filled with glee. Music began to play over the speakers again and before Harry could take another step, a swarm of bachelorettes were encircling the bar and tugging the three men off in different directions. When Harry looked back up at the stage, it was empty.
“I haven’t even heard from Draco since the engagement last year.” Greg shrugged.
“DoyouhaveanyexperienceinDNAtesting?” Lily managed quickly, her face turning a darker shade of green that indicated she was flushing red on her side of the fire. Luna pretended to take a minute to ponder just what Lily might be really asking.
“I always was.” Draco looked away.
“Vic and Teddy are here,” Lily admitted. Luna smiled again.
“They’re good. Busy. Things are settling down now that the back-to-school crowd has finished, but the holidays are coming up. We have a lot of custom orders in the works and a few Quidditch teams have ordered new brooms.”
Lily met Alex in the middle just as he was climbing down from his friend’s shoulders. His friend grunted in irritation and mild pain, but Alex just threw him an apologetic smile and turned back to his fiancé. Alex was tall, slim, and brown. His hair was dark and almost as curly as Lily’s, though he kept his much shorter than hers. His eyes were a warm brown and his gaze was almost always focused entirely on her every time she was in the same room. Lily reached for him and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him close to kiss. He smiled against her lips, his arms wrapping snuggly around her waist.
“This has nothing to do with him. My whole life has been one big unanswered question, and I don’t want any more secrecy.”
