He wondered how he had transported there, and how that was even possible since you couldn’t Apparate on school grounds, when he saw that the edges of his vision were blurred, and the Figure with the hooded cloak was standing before him. It was another vision, except this time, it felt more real than it ever had before.
But there was something about Harry’s reaction, and his warmth and magic and whole persona, that made Draco really, incredibly… whole. He’d figured out that part over the weeks of the sleeping curse, but there had never been a life or death situation before to challenge that thought. But, the thought was officially challenged.
At this point, Draco knew he was dead. But he also knew what the Wizarding World was like now. Drys had somehow convinced everyone that even though Draco had done a terrible deed; killing so many people, it was better for the world.
Harry set down his sandwich. “It was really no problem. I just noticed how stressed you were, and-” He shrugged, picking up his sandwich again.
“Stop rambling, Potter. I’m fine. It- it wasn’t a nightmare.” Draco said. He sat farther up in bed, pulling the blankets up with him. Should he tell Potter about his dream? No, it was definitely some sort of vision-message thing. Not really a dream at all. He was sure of it this time. He could remember the difference now between whatever the vision was, and a genuine real dream. Maybe he couldn’t tell the other morning, after he had the first vision, because he had been drugged on potions thanks to Madame Pomfrey, before he had slept.
“And thank you for agreeing to confess a secret. That must’ve been hard. But we got the cure now, and it will all pay off in the end,” Potter whispered into the darkness.
Harry had been avoiding eye contact for a while, and so had Draco, but now their eyes met. Harry’s gaze was unwavering and truthfully very frightening. Draco could now clearly see the man who had defeated You-Know-Who.
They pulled away as quickly as it had happened, and both respectively cleared their throats, trying not to assess the awkwardness of the situation that had just happened between them.
“Really? I mean, it seemed like you guys were close. He stood up for you to Professor Wynn. He spoke for you at your trial this summer. He got you out of Azkaban. You know who’s in Azkaban right now? My father. You should be there right along with-”
McGonagall continued. “You have shown great strength over the past weeks, Draco. And you handled your situation, as far as I can tell from what I and the Ministry saw, extremely well and maturely--” Draco started to blush-- “and you will be pleased to hear that you do not need an escort to enter into Hogsmeade anymore.” Draco was about to open his mouth when McGonagall cut him off. “Furthermore, you will now be able to cast defensive spells. You can cast any spells in fact. You won’t get in trouble for doing so.”
Draco grimaced and turned his direction towards Pansy. When he reached her, she sent a vicious glare to all the eyes turnt their way. That scared the Slytherins away, thank Merlin.
. Something they had never in their life done before. But Draco knew it wouldn’t come to that. Someone else would be awake and he or she would join their sad little duo.
Harry took Draco’s hand, leading him out to a spot where they wouldn’t have a chance of crashing into anything. Draco had never slow danced with a man before, and he didn’t know how to designate who was supposed to lead and who was to follow. But, Harry, the Gryffindor that he was, took Draco’s hands and placed them on his waist, while Harry placed his own hands on Draco’s shoulders.
“I have to use the loo, excuse me,” Draco said after a while. They nodded to him briefly before returning to their talk about racing brooms. Pansy was too pissed to care about the topic.
Like he did most days, Draco splashed water on his face, turning the faucet to the coldest temperature possible, hoping the cold water would distract him from the pain.
Draco had been in the library for hours, searching through every shelf and pulling out books that looked important. He was determined to be the one to solve whatever curse or spell had made all of Hogwarts take what appeared to be a very long nap. He was going to find the answer before Potter. Books were a very reliable source, he was sure at least one of them held the answer.
“Hey!” Harry exclaimed, glaring slightly at Draco. Although, he didn’t seem to be too upset at the insult. “I’ll tell you how I know the layout pretty well, but you can’t tell anyone. Promise?”
He gave her a polite nod and turned his attention back over to Harry. He took the extra couple steps to get as close as possible to him, shoving his drink back into Hermione’s hand, and gave Harry a huge hug, holding onto him like they hadn’t seen each other in years.
He had been lucky enough that throughout the past two weeks, he had done a significant amount of walking and running, so he was able to run a long distance without feeling the need to be sick.
His roommates would probably yell at him for hogging the bathroom, but he honestly didn’t care at the moment. He
Draco crawled into the Slytherin green bed, wrapping himself up in the blankets, and blistering in the fact that he didn’t have to sleep in the uncomfortable hospital bed for any more nights. His chest ached with relief that he was finally resting and not up and walking. He closed his eyes, and listened to Potter’s light breathing as he drifted to sleep.
Draco thought it was sort of stupid, Potter feeling guilty for all the deaths that happened. It was honestly more Draco’s fault than his. Draco had fought on the wrong side, while Potter was the literal embodiment of the right side. He had saved the Wizarding World in the end.
Harry gave Draco one quick, longing look. “Goodbye, Malfoy.” And with those words, he made his way to the front doors of Hogwarts, vanishing as he went inside.
Draco had yet another question. His mind kept coming up with more and more inquiries as seconds ticked by. “What if the whole Wizarding World is under this spell? The Ministry. The Aurors. Literally every head wizard. We’d truly be on our own.”
“Are you sure you want to eat in the Great Hall today, Draco?” Pansy asked from beside him. “I’m sure we can find somewhere else to get food.”
Draco wasn’t exactly sure why, but he was severely taken aback, and in his small moment of weakness, Drys cast a spell his way, sending Draco backward, resulting in him falling on the ground.
or some shit. Draco respected McGonagall, he really did, but he thought that idea was the worst idea she had ever come up with. That anyone could come up with.
Kaspian was probably the most fake person Draco had the displeasure of meeting. He would smile and make polite conversations with every professor, winning them over with his charming grin. But when there weren’t any adults around he was vicious and nasty, and he got away with it every time. The most infuriating part was that the trio didn’t seem to
The Room of Requirement provided a set of new, clean clothes, which consisted of jeans and a jumper, (his usual attire), and Draco pulled them on hastily, ignoring the horrible burning in his forearm. A burning more terrible than usual. It was slightly easy to ignore the pain, however, since the pain over losing Harry, because of his foolish mistakes, was even greater.
Soo turns out there is still another chapter before the epilogue! So yeah, one more chapter where everything is officially tied up which will be pretty long and thennn the epilogue. Just a heads up, it will probably take me a while to write the last chapter. I might post the last real chapter and the epilogue together, but who knows!
His father’s fucking Dark Mark had started moving again. Which meant all the other Death Eaters were experiencing the same problem.
Draco had to close his eyes as the impact of what Drys was saying hit him. He did remember that day, now that he was reminded of it. It had been late June, right after Dumbledore’s death, when all the raids and killings of Muggle-borns and Muggles started. The media hadn’t gotten a hold on what exactly the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord had been doing then. There had been surprise attacks at homes of known Muggle-borns; the Kaspians being a part of one of those first attacks.
“So, did you get your wand back? You know, after Alec took it?” Draco implored while stacking food on his fork.
They left the room, and once they were outside the entrance, the wooden door carved with designs completely disappeared, going back to the original, plain stone wall.
Oddly enough, no one seemed to bother him as he bent down over the trunk at the foot of his bed and carefully placed all of his objects Harry had handed to him in there while grabbing some school books. After he was finished, he recast plenty of concealing and locking charms on the trunk to keep anyone else out.
awkward for Draco, since he’d slipped Theo the “Restorative Potion” in his sleep while not really knowing if it would kill him or not.
That night Draco sat in the Slytherin common room with his Arithmancy book open on his lap. He was deep into reading the text when he heard someone sit down next to him, loudly chewing away on muggle gum, and sighing over dramatically.
“Harry,” he stated before he could stop himself. After that surprise, he was surprised once more, realizing he was on the seventh floor corridor, right by the Room of Requirement.
The next couple parts came in fragments: the Aurors saying that Draco was free to go, and that they lifted all possible charges, McGonagall saying comforting words because she wished he’d never had to have gone through that, and lastly, Narcissa turning away from Draco, her body heaving up and down, as the Aurors explained that all of the Death Eaters were dead. His father was dead.
“Potter that’s amazing! I knew you could do it!” Draco had actually been the complete opposite of sure, but he had to say something encouraging.
He shook his head, and almost laughed at Harry’s words. “That’s just it. It’s not perfect. Not even close.” Draco couldn’t stop himself from running a hand over Harry’s chest, entranced at how different Harry’s body was from his; there were multiple scars, but none that ran the length of his upper body like his own, crisscrossing and marring skin. No tattoo on his forearm that was the embodiment of pure evil.
There was yet another noise, definitely coming from Slughorn’s classroom, and Draco groaned, because he knew he had to check it out. If it really was Theo, maybe he could even enlist him to help Draco find Harry. Surely, Theo wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to save the world’s Savior.
When Slughorn came around to Draco’s table, he very pointedly did not look in Draco’s direction at all. Draco rolled his eyes. It wasn’t like Slughorn would see, so.
Though, he had considered locating Harry on his map, but when Draco searched all his pockets for it, he found that the map was not in his possession, and walking back outside to search for Harry’s magical map seemed foolish too- he told himself he would become ill if he was outside for too long- and so he just hoped Harry had his map. It seemed important to him.
Harry was still leaning against Draco, and had stopped coughing for the moment. He looked like he was exhausted, and wanted to fall asleep terribly bad, but the idea of losing consciousness while in the presence of a dark wizard was not something Harry intended to do. Even at his lowest, Harry still set the bar high.
He found an empty table and sat down at a chair that was adorned in black ribbons, resting his elbows on the table and his chin in his hand. What a pathetic sight this must be, he thought. It was his birthday, and he was sitting alone at a table. He wished he’d have kept the drink Hermione had given him, so he’d have something to sip on while he people watched.
Somewhere, deep inside himself, he expected Harry to jump up and yell, “Surprise!” and tell Draco that he was wrong, that Draco wouldn’t be the death of Harry Potter.
to you, and you talked to him, and he made you some sick offer, it sounds exactly like something Voldemort would do. And I hate to break it to you, but Voldemort was very much real.”
It was weird to think that a couple days ago, Draco had let Potter lead him to Transfigurations. Not even giving a second thought about trailing behind him. Now, it felt like he had to show Potter he was confident, and knew what he was doing. It might have been because of the little quip Potter had made earlier about Draco being a prejudiced Death Eater, but he wasn’t sure.
At the moment, Harry was the only thing in Draco’s world. The only person who could make time itself stop, just by existing. He wondered, by the way Harry’s eyes sparkled when he looked at Draco, if the feeling was mutual.
Harry pocketed his wand, clearly sheepish. “Alright, go on.” He gestured to a wall closest to them, and Draco took a deep breath, focusing on channeling his magic.
Draco, surprised at the abrupt change of subject, couldn’t suppress the array of emotions now flittering on
“What?” Draco was looking in the direction where Potter’s attention was grabbed, and saw nothing of interest. “Potter, what is it?”
surprised he said something he hadn’t planned on saying. He just wished it hadn’t been what sex he was attracted to.
With the book safely clutched in Potter’s hand, they both made their way outside and took the shortest route to where the ward touched the ground. It was still a long walk, probably taking them about thirty minutes to reach the end of the barrier, but it certainly did not feel that long. He and Potter talked the whole way, laughing and making jokes with each other; it was starting to feel as if they weren’t in the middle of some huge crisis, and they were just two boys having fun and going on a walk to the outskirts of Hogwarts.
leave Hogwarts’ grounds. He would be breaking a part of his probation, and that might make the scenario where he’s beside his father’s cell, quite real. The problem at hand was extenuating, and the Aurors might go easy on him because he was trying to save Hogwarts, and he bloody well wasn’t able to ask for permission, but he didn’t know for sure that they would let him off the hook.
- once more, but he continued to stand a safe distance from him, nodding in approval and matching the grin on Harry’s face with his own small smile.
“True. But, there’s something else.” Harry glanced around the room, obviously scared someone was going to walk through the entrance to the Garden of Mystics any second. The idiot. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin. I asked the hat to put me in any house other than Slytherin.”
“You’re going to be okay. Just hold still.” He felt a rush of coolness travel through him, twisting its way throughout every inch of his body. She had apparently cast some sort of healing spell, though he didn’t hear which one; she must have done it nonverbally. Even though he was already starting to feel better, and his eyesight was now back to normal, he felt like shit. His arm was still numb, and his chest and head throbbed an excruciating amount.
“Madame Pomfrey?” He said urgently. There was no response. He tried again, “Madame Pomfrey are you in there?” He wasn’t surprised to receive no answer.
the Death Eaters. All decked out in black cloaks and circling the space where he, Drys, Alec, and Harry all were currently. Past the wards of Hogwarts.
“Yeah. Okay, I’ll learn some new spells. But after a couple days practicing these, we go back to looking through books. Alright?”
“I-- I didn’t want to die,” Draco admitted. “I was so scared. Scared for my own life, scared for your life, scared for everyone else's…”
He went on, “I know I told you last time that everyone in this castle was asleep, and you know what Harry and I have been doing the past two weeks? Trying to save everyone’s arses, that's what. We needed that book to help us with some cure to wake everyone up, and we made the antidote alright, but when we tested it,
They’d been out shopping all day and now it was about eight o’clock pm. Draco was exhausted and did not want to return home to a party-filled-house. He wanted to blow out the candle on the little cupcake his mother had bought him, eat it, and fall asleep.
It had been two days since Draco had come to his horrible realization, and he’d made sure not to act any differently around Harry.
He thought perhaps Harry wasn’t able to hear him over the loud sounds of rain and thunder, but Harry did turn around that time. Draco was grinning, hoping for another snogging session, but Harry was most certainly not grinning. He had this look on his face, a look Draco couldn’t decipher. He looked, sad, almost, with maybe a tiny hint of anger and… disappointment. Draco wasn’t sure, though, Harry had never been this hard to read, he always wore his heart on his sleeve, which was one of the things Draco loved about him.
He groaned and yanked his sleeve down forcefully. It wasn’t burning like it had been the night before, but there was still a faint pain.
I've re-read and edited this chapter more than five times and I think this is the best its going to get, so I really do hope its an okay chapter
Alec was now looking impatient, leaning against the nearest tree and shooting nasty looks at Draco. Drys moved even closer to him and Harry.
He was just ultimately hoping that they would see he didn’t intentionally plan to kill someone, and un-arrest him.
“So, should we head to the library after this? We should use our second question to ask the book if there’s something that can break a barrier spell,” Potter spoke up, breaking their silence- which was thankfully comfortable silence.
Within that week, all the details of the Malfoy family trials had been out for the public to see, in the
Pomfrey’s office door was shut, and so was the door leading to her bedroom. She was probably sitting in either one at the moment, because where else would she be? Draco could probably call for her to bring him a light breakfast, but he knew that was extremely rude. So, he continued to sit in his bed, and thought about Quidditch and different types of defensive spells he would definitely use once his probation was up.
“Yep,” She popped the ‘p’, and dragged him through the crowd, handing him over to Blaise and Greg who were talking to each other in a corner. “Go and mingle,” She said as she unhooked her arm from his and vanished into the mass of people.
He wasn’t sure what to expect from today, but he would most certainly be prepared. He looked at himself in the mirror, his blond hair almost glowing, noticeably standing out against his mostly dark outfit. He pictured Harry standing by his side. A little bit shorter than Draco, much more muscular, and incredibly handsome. Oh how he missed the git.
On Fridays, Draco had a group therapy session with the other Eighth Years. It was put together by McGonagall. She had said that,
Madame Pomfrey huffed in annoyance. “Fine. You have five minutes! No more!” She then stalked back into her office and shut the door.
So, Draco carefully pulled up his pyjama sleeve, and unwrapped the bandage. He was sure his heart stopped beating in his chest for at least five seconds. It had to. The Dark Mark was
He felt so light, running through the empty halls of Hogwarts, being chased by Harry Potter. He heard Harry’s laugh, and then he started laughing too, just because of the sheer ridiculousness of the situation.
The piece of parchment was still laid out in front of Draco though, while he watched Theo’s dot. He couldn’t occupy himself with anything else, since he was afraid he’d miss a movement from Theo if he was distracted.
After a while, he thought he heard a noise, but his brain blocked it out, and he focused on the task at hand.
“You’re right, I did.” Drys pointed his wand at Draco, and he saw Alec moving to stand closer to Harry. “But first, you need to see this.”
“I know. We finally have a solution to this whole mess. That is, if the potion works.” Draco continued to read the ingredients over and over.
He was halfway to the restrooms when he felt a hand circle around his wrist, luckily the right one. He turned to see that the hand belonged to Harry.
Draco didn’t even bother trying to grab the book from Harry. He was sore in many different places and his vision was coming back to him slowly, he didn’t want another altercation that would result in himself surely getting hurt again. Harry seemed fine. His apparent head injury he’d had just a few minutes ago was long gone, and he was peering down at
“Sorry, Draco, I didn’t mean to startle you. I just thought we could maybe have a little chat,” She spoke over the loud noises of people talking and chairs skidding across the floor.
Roaming the halls and searching for whatever he was searching for, had proved useless and horrible for his mental health. Being left alone with his thoughts never got him anywhere. He realized that when Harry was with him, though, he became distracted and hadn’t felt so alone in the world. Sure, thoughts of anxiety still got to him, he figured even love couldn’t exactly cure trauma, but Harry always said the right thing to him, and made everything a bit clearer.
) really be murdered? He liked to think it was all bluff, but once again he couldn’t assume the offer was full of lies, sent just to mess with him. He wouldn’t be the one responsible for more deaths.
Draco didn’t dare pull up his sleeve and look at the dark ink. There was a Muggle razor on the sink, and he was not strong enough to resist the urge to drag it across his arm at the sight of the Dark Lord’s Mark.
“I’m sorry,” Potter finally said. “I hadn’t meant to leave you-” Draco scoffed- “I thought you would have been sleeping longer, so I got up to go and take a little walk outside and clear my head. I planned on being back before you woke, but that obviously didn’t happen. I’m sorry that I scared you.” Potter looked quite sheepish by the time he finished speaking.
“Please don’t get mad. Or do get mad. You most certainly have the right too. But, okay, while you were sleeping…” Harry paused, not meeting Draco’s eyes. “God, you’re going to hate me so much.” Harry put his head in his hands.
Two outcomes awaited Draco. On one hand, Theo would awaken from the sleeping curse once the Restorative Potion made its way into his system, and the first person Draco would come face to face with after two weeks of only being around Harry, would be the person who hated his guts, and probably had taken a blade to his Dark Mark just for the fun of it. But, he’d know the potion had worked, and Draco could save everyone.
The next day was a Friday, and that meant it was getting even closer than Draco’s liking to the one week check point that marked the day he had woken up to a school full of sleeping bodies. And that meant he and Potter only had one week until something surely terrible happened.
Before they traveled back into unbearable silence once more, Draco pocketed all of his items, placing back on the charm that was used to make the glassy, flower-entraping-crystal-ball a smaller size. He then asked Harry all the details regarding what happened to Alec, and all the dead Death Eaters, along with Drys.
When a book can give you any known information in the world, you need it all. Three compared to billions, is nothing.
Finally separating at last, Draco and Harry both looked at their surrounding onlookers, a red blush tinting their cheeks.
His thoughts were basically the same as when he’d deduced he fancied Harry: Harry’s the savior of the Wizarding World. Harry had been his sworn enemy for years. Harry could never forgive him. How could Draco constantly look into Harry’s eyes, eyes that reflected back to him all the mistakes he’d made? So yeah, all the same, except on a larger scale.
The door to the classroom slammed open. To Draco’s amazement, it wasn’t Potter who was going to save him, but Hermione Granger.
That, and the fact that Harry was standing there right in front of him--the two of them alone--looking so incredibly gorgeous it made Draco’s heart hurt; so gorgeous that it overpowered any thought to flee the situation in the end.
The new photo appeared in Harry’s hand, and the picture turned out as perfect as the last. Both of their smiles shown so bright, they could’ve been mistaken as the stars above their heads.
Every moment, the good and the bad that made up their entire relationship, led to this moment right now. Draco had wished he could go back in time, all the way back to when they had first met, but now, he realized he didn’t want to anymore.
Draco had been certain that whatever he had been feeling for Harry was only a simple crush. But now, he was certain, he had found love.
“No! I-” Potter stuttered, searching for an excuse. “Okay, fine, I guess I did.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “You can call me Harry, if you want. Only if I’m allowed to call you Draco for now on.”
There were no windows in the kitchen, but Draco guessed stars were starting to shine through the sky as it turned dark. He hoped he and Harry would be able to share another moment under the stars together sometime.
Everyday since Draco had been staying in the Hospital Wing, she’d had to do the same thing to his forearm. Apparently, the Dark Mark was constantly bleeding and burning up; not that Draco could feel it. Well, it stung, but it was nothing compared to the pain the Mark had produced under the rule of the Dark Lord and then Drys.
He stopped in front of the Slytherin common room entrance, wondering if he should check in there- Harry knew the password, since he’d heard Draco say it multiple times- when he decided to first check Slughorn’s classroom.
No, he wouldn’t use up the last question they had, that would have been way too evil even for him. He and Potter were saving the last question for anything extremely terrible that came up. They’d decided not to try another question regarding a new counter-spell for the ward, one that was possibly more powerful. They weren’t positive such a spell existed, and they wouldn’t chance giving up their last question to find out. It was agreed upon that they would first wake everyone up in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and then figure out their ward problem.
Yes, he bloody well was still injured, and his chest was throbbing painfully from all the walking around.
After about two minutes of collecting his breath and telling himself that he would be just fine, he knocked.
Drys gave him a pitiful smile, contradicting everything Draco had believed. Alec gave a loud groan. It was
(Spoiler, but not really: Next chapter is the last chapter of normalcy before everyone falls under the sleeping curse)
“You know, I feel I deserve all the hate,” Draco said, wanting to pour out all of his feelings to Harry. Wanting Harry to see his vulnerable side. “But at the same time, I want people to love and admire me again. Isn’t that a strange coincidence?”
Dumbledore nodded slowly. “If you ever wish to talk to me or Severus- to both of us, you are always welcome too. I hope you know that.”
He wasn’t sure why Harry was asking for Draco’s permission to hold him closer, since he’d already been doing it basically all night, but it showed Harry cared, which made the moment sweeter.
Of course no one had been awake. Every single person had been in the same spot as the last time Draco had gone to his common room.
Potter didn’t look like he was waiting for a response though. He glanced down at the instructions that were laid out between them, and then grabbed a handful of dragon scales, setting it down in front of the cauldron. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Let’s try some then,” Harry stated. He opened the book to a random page and Draco stood up, wanting to see what spell Harry was looking at. “
“Yeah, technically. Drys and Olive were born to Muggles, but they were obviously magical themselves.” Harry swept his finger over the signatures.
Draco ran down the millions of steps that made up the Astronomy Tower, almost killing himself three times by tripping, and once he reached floor level, his eager running turned into composed walking. Or, at least, mostly composed.
He cocked one of his eyebrows up, indicating he was listening, but continued to look down at the book in front of him.
He hadn’t exactly meant to tell Potter he was gay, it sort of came out of his mouth without thinking. He never thought straight when he was in the middle of an anxiety attack, so he wasn’t
Draco, belongings in hand, started towards his own dormitory. He really was tired. But, he knew he should probably take a shower before going to bed.
Blaise and Davis ignored him most of the time, while Theo and Robins were always taunting him and calling him names, always trying to get under his skin.
She punched his arm, and Draco let out a sharp gasp. “Hey!” he said, “I was just hospitalized! Go easy on me!”
This was one of the best and most care-free moments he’d ever had the pleasure of experiencing. All thanks to the two of them fighting.
The way they were looking at each other was all wrong. Harry was straight, for Merlin’s sake. He couldn’t possibly love Draco when he fancied girls. The thought darkened Draco’s mood, and-
As much as he hated Theo, he wouldn’t want him to go through the same exact thing Draco had gone through with the Dark Lord.
Draco realized he had had a conversation with Potter. A real conversation that didn’t have anything to do with the sleeping curse or being rude to one another. They had talked about their friends, and had very lightly broached the untouchable topic of the war, without getting into a huge argument.
“I am afraid all magic has its limits. And when I created the book in my youth, I could not figure out the spell to make the questions infinite. So, the limit is only three.”
Drys scowled in the direction of Alec, then looked back at Draco. “If you pick the right option, Harry will live. If you choose
“I do have- uh, one question. For you.” Potter turned slightly in his seat. He was obviously embarrassed about something. And this time it had nothing to do with him crying; his tears were long gone by now. “Did you ever have a… boyfriend? Or whatever. I honestly thought you and Parkinson were a thing.”
“I have a question,” Draco said, “For you.” He added at the last second so they both would know the question was only directed at Snape. And so that Dumbledore might possibly get the hint that Draco didn’t want him to talk. Not because he disliked Dumbledore, but because Draco was still severely ashamed of himself, and wouldn’t be able to have a conversation with him without having an anxiety attack.
This time when Draco tried to sit up all the way, he was successful. Pansy was still rubbing his arm and his mother clearly wanted to embrace Draco in some way, but didn’t want to disrupt Pansy at the same time.
Not that Draco had a crush. But, even if he did he would never talk about it to Pansy. Though she did know he was gay. She knew ever since Sixth Year, when she had kissed him for the first time, and he visibly recoiled and had said how disgusting the experience was.
“Of course, our family had been one of the first ripped apart. I spent so long in your dungeon-” Draco didn’t miss out on how Drys said
“So,” Harry started, sitting down in a chair in front of the fire. Draco sat on his once designated bed.
Draco sighed. “You know that’s not true. And please, Harry, let’s just focus on stirring the potion, alright?”
with his own wand as he got farther away from the lights in Hogsmeade, and he thanked himself for casting the spell because without it he would have tripped about a thousand times already over fallen branches and holes in the ground.
“You’ll be the death of me, Harry Potter,” Draco quipped, but found the statement to be filled with some truth.
Pansy still hung out with Theo, even though she knew Draco and him were no where close to being friends, or even friendly to another. It didn’t really bother Draco, he knew she had been friends with Theo for a long time, longer than she and Draco had known each other. Pansy still chose Draco over Theo’s company though most of the time, and that thought made Draco smirk.
join his side. To accept the pull of the Mark and rule beside him as the Purebloods were no more. Drys, who thought so strongly that the Ministry and Wizarding World would back him up on his evil plan; who would see the good in the death of Purebloods once the ones in Hogwarts were dead.
“Alright, let’s see if it worked,” Potter said as their eyes traveled down to the pages of the book. “Book, please reveal to us some sort of counter-curse that will safely return people who are in a cursed state, back to their normal non-cursed selves.”
The next second was a blur. Harry was crashing into him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him in tight for a hug. His face was buried into Draco’s neck, and it sounded like Harry was mumbling words.
After the large group of Death Eaters had Apparated away, Draco had been about to join them, when Rookwood said they had to burn the house down, leaving no evidence behind. It was to look like a simple house fire, killing the residents with no trace of dark magic.
He also knew Lucius had disobeyed his own rule. Draco had been witness innumerable times to Lucius bowing his head to the Dark Lord, not meeting his master’s eyes; to Lucius very obviously not being in control of the situation that was set in front of him.
“Right, then,” Draco muttered, and tried yanking his arm away, one last time. To his surprise it worked. He turned back around, and started walking away from Potter when he felt a hand wrap around the same wrist, once again.
The two of them entered the Slytherin common room, Draco leading the way towards his dormitory, only stopping briefly to take a quick look at Pansy, to make sure she was alright. Of course, she was, she hadn’t changed positions since the last time Draco saw her.
He didn’t have much energy to talk to her, and everything still hurt very, very much. He just hoped she knew some healing spells.
Potter was still a git. He was still an annoying, self-righteous Gryffindor, with atrocious hair. Draco still did
His eyes scanned around the room, he observed how happy everyone was, smiling and laughing with their friends. It was like no war had taken place there at all. During the summer, Draco knew that a huge team of wizards had come to help return Hogwarts back to its former glory. They had done an excellent job. It looked like it had always looked before. However, the feeling was just wrong. Like something had been sucked out of the atmosphere. He hoped he wasn’t the only one who felt that feeling. He couldn’t tell if he was the only one, since everyone seemed to be content with their lives by the look of light on their faces.
He’d dreamed of a moment exactly like this. Where he would be viewed as a hero, and not the villain. Of a day where people would really give him a second chance at life, because they could truly see he had changed. Of a day where people wouldn’t be scared of him, and would congratulate and thank him for a heroic deed.
for being on the Dark Lord’s side, and Potter was accidentally pulled along for the ride. “Potter. That’s crazy. It’s not your fault. Don’t think that.”
Harry’s wand was held a bit away from their faces, and positioned so that the tip of the wand pointed upwards. Harry spoke the spell, and nothing indicated that it had worked until a photograph appeared in Harry’s hand, the same size as the last. Even though the size was the same, the picture was not. It showed the both of them leaning against each other, not quite smiling since they hadn’t been sure when the picture was going to be taken, but definitely enjoying themselves.
“Fine! Whatever. It’s my injuries. They aren’t fully healed yet and all this walking and running is definitely not helping my situation.” He stopped kneeling, and thought,
Once Draco had stepped into the Room of Requirement, he bolted to the bathroom, locking the door manually and with multiple spells.
Draco was ready to protest that no, he wasn’t crying, but to his horror, for the third time that night, he felt tears falling freely down his cheeks. Harry was already there, brushing away the teardrops and slowly but surely holding him closer.
Still not meeting Harry’s eyes quite yet, and trying to quell the bubbles in his stomach, he set the necklace at the edge of the table, and picked up the last item. An Anemonlea flower was frozen in some type of preservation spell; trapped in a glassy crystal ball. Draco took a wild guess, and theorized that it was the same flower Harry had stuck in his hair the night of their kiss. Draco had left it back at the pavilion after their fight the next morning.
He made a half-hearted attempt at getting up from his comfortable position next to Harry, and wasn’t surprised to find he had moved literally nowhere. His body and brain were exhausted, he didn’t have enough willpower to move back to his bed. He’d wake up before Harry and switch beds, so Harry wouldn’t ever find out Draco had fucking laid next to him and stroked his hair like a total creep. Yeah, he’d wake up earlier than Harry, it would all work out fine.
“Definitely.” Harry was filled with excitement again, and he was about to reach for the door handle when he turned to face Draco. “Together?”
His mother was still under house arrest, of course, too. But, given the recent circumstances, they allowed her out of the Manor to see Draco as long as she always had an Auror around to watch her.
The Death Eater let out a humorless laugh. “Search the house and surrounding area. Bring me their wands.”
Draco had gotten himself stuck in a broom closet. Draco could feel his cheeks burn and he mentally cursed his pale complexion.
Draco found a spare sheet of parchment laying on one of the empty tables, along with a quill nearby, and got to work writing his letter.
He brought his hand up to the right side of his face, on his cheek, and brushed his hand gently over the scar that was there. It traveled from the center of his cheek, all the way down to the middle of his chest. It was from the
“I visit McGonagall on occasion just to chat with her about… things. It was the password the last time I visited her, so,” Potter shrugged and backed away from the opening, now standing behind Draco.
Draco looked down at his outfit. He was wearing his usual dress shirt and Slytherin robes. He had thought he’d looked decent in the mirror that morning, but Potter’s comment was starting to make him self-conscious. It was the first outfit that had come to mind and the Room of Requirement had given it to him.
“Yeah. Snape.” Potter turned to face Draco straight on. “Look at the cover, it says ‘The Hearts’ Deepest Secret Will Uncover More Than What You Seek.’” His finger pointed to the words as he said them aloud.
“Harry,” Draco croaked, “I- I just. Can you please stop?” The last part came out as inaudible, and sure enough, Harry leaned in closer to hear Draco more clearly.
Draco felt like Harry was lying. But, he felt comforted by Harry's acclamation. At least for a couple minutes, until he finally fell asleep.
“Potter, has- has your scar hurt lately?” Draco asked in the most casual tone he could muster. He knew that Potter’s scar was in some way connected to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord himself had talked briefly of their connection during meetings, and though he never revealed much about the strange connection, Draco did know that Potter’s scar was very important.
busting us and getting us in trouble.” Potter’s tone turned a little defensive when he mentioned his little club, and Draco suddenly felt incredibly guilty.
It was written in his father’s handwriting, no doubt, and his father had done exactly what Draco had asked him to write. A simple yes or no response regarding whether or not Lucius’ Mark had started moving again.
Draco sprung up from his seat, along with everyone else in the room, and was about to grab his bag from beside his chair when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He flinched at the touch, and spun around to find Elizabeth standing there.
It still amazed Draco that Snape, a man he had looked up to and who had protected him, had created his own book, using his own types of enchantments and spells to program it so that it would contain every known spell, potion, piece of information, in the Wizarding World.
Another person was walking their way. A person significantly smaller than the Figure, but about the same size as Draco. The harsh rain made it hard to see who the person was from a good distance away, but as the person ran up to the Figure, and his face became clear, Draco knew exactly who the boy was.
Apparently, according to Pansy, she knew she had been under a sleeping curse, but couldn’t do anything about it. It had been like she was a tiny little bug living inside her eyes, able to see and hear certain things, but not able to escape. The analogy creeped Draco out.
“But you saved me,” Harry stated loud and clear. “You fucking jumped in front of the fucking Killing Curse, and risked your own life for
Walking deeper into the common room, Draco held his wand tighter and tried his hardest not to stare directly into anyone’s eyes. He knew, based on what Pansy had told him, that the whole school knew he and Harry had been involved someway with the Sleeping Curse. He had to wonder what exact rumors were spread, though. And how
“Hmph-” A certain someone said as Draco ran into Potter’s back, thanks to his wandering mind. Potter smelled of broom wax and sweets, Draco thought; he could tell due to their awkward close proximity.
Potter stood a little bit in front of Draco, facing the streets of Hogsmeade, which were completely empty. Lights illuminated the streets, making it easy to see in the dark; it was definitely a creepy sight. It felt like a ghost town.
“Yeah,” Draco said. He didn’t have much else to say, and he felt silly with his short response. What he
“I did, in fact. My wand was on Alec, and the Aurors gave it back to me when they captured him. Why do you ask?”
“To switch the Mark’s leader to myself,” Drys cut in, “I needed your blood and I needed the blood of Avery snr. Now, you all obey me. You do whatever I tell you to do, and if I die, you all die too.”
He could defeat anything with Harry by his side, he’d told himself. But when Harry was gone, what was he to do?
He was about to attempt to fall asleep when he heard rustling coming from Potter’s bed, and watched as Potter turned over onto his other side to face Draco. He could tell that Potter’s eyes were open if he squinted, and Draco hoped Potter couldn’t make out his own eyes staring right back at him.
The slide felt like it could continue on forever, and Draco wished it would’ve. However, he soon saw the end, and braced himself for landing, Harry now several feet behind him.
He scooted closer to Harry, and they were laying side by side, Draco’s arm touching Harry’s. Draco was leaning slightly to look at Harry’s face, propped up on one arm. He then moved his hand slightly, letting it linger over Harry’s forehead, and then brushed back a few strands of hair. He could see his famous lightning bolt scar when his hair was pushed back, and he wanted to touch it, oddly enough.
“Well, we- as in Potter and I- found this book of yours.” He held out the book so that Snape could see the front cover, and he nodded his head. “I was wondering if you could tell me what the writing on the cover meant.”
Draco couldn’t believe they were making small talk. He couldn’t believe how skilled he was at making conversations awkward, either.
Then the two of them had gone to their respective common rooms to check if anyone had moved, and were not in the least bit shocked to find no one had. They could obviously tell no one else was around just from walking the halls of Hogwarts, but they agreed they should also check their common rooms every morning together, just in case.
“So, to make sure I wasn’t the one going crazy, I checked all of the other boys’ dormitories, and every single person was sleeping! I would’ve checked on the girls, but I obviously can’t get into their rooms, so.” Potter finished his rant, and sat down on the bottom stair, putting his head in his hands.
He almost forgot about what seemed like the most important part of what had transpired last night. The figure had said, “Two weeks.” Draco still had no clue what that meant. He guessed he could think about it some other time though. It wasn’t
The door flew open, to reveal an uncomfortable looking Potter. He looked like he always did. Messy, ink black hair. Green eyes that stared directly into your soul. Tired, dark circles under those eyes. The same that Draco had under his eyes. Potter did look nice though. He had grown a lot during the time when the Wizarding World was under siege of the Dark Lord. His shoulders were more broad, and he had gotten even taller. Not as tall as Draco though.
Harry stirred slightly. His head twitched in Draco’s lap, and Draco immediately placed all of his attention back on Harry, smoothing down his hair, and keeping him warm.
The snow piled over the grass was thick, but he trudged through it, heading in the direction of the pavilion. Once he made the walk to his destination, he plopped down on one of the steps leading up to the raised seating area. He felt like he didn’t deserve the comfort of a bench right now. He deserved to have the snow slapping his face, freezing his nose and cheeks, and certainly ruining his hair.
that was the case before, especially after he received the letter from his father, but now that he had confirmation from the man who’d cursed everyone himself, Draco wanted to scream. He really
“But killing you wouldn’t be as fun. I want you to be alive to witness all of the deaths you caused. I want you to suffer. Isn’t that clear?”
“Okay, thanks.” He did not want to hear the rest of what she had to say. He knew all about the skin where the Dark Mark was. He knew no matter how much you marred it, it would always magically heal itself.
He was also aware of the awkward position he was in. He was sort of straddling Harry. He instantly corrected himself, moving to sit directly beside Harry again, the world stopped even as he changed his position. He was still incredibly close to Harry.
Harry made a sympathetic look that conveyed ‘I know you know, it was a rhetorical question,’ but he continued on, “The past makes you who you are. The good and the bad. I think that what you choose to do in the future is what matters the most.”
you need to know how to defend yourself. This whole thing could turn ugly. What if the figure who’s in my visions, cast the sleeping curse, and put up a ward around us, comes to Hogwarts? You need to know more spells than
He had his first private therapy session with Elizabeth. Which was a huge step in the right direction for him.
This was not his first confrontation with people who wanted to cause him pain. Nowhere near it. He had been attacked too many times to keep track of since the beginning of the school year. But, he always came out fine in the end. Well, he came out fine enough for him or Pansy to cast simple healing spells on.
Harry came down right behind him, his feet hitting Draco’s back painfully. He guessed it had been his fault, since he hadn’t moved out of the way when he’d gotten a chance, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about his now aching spine, since he’d just witnessed an experience so wonderfully fun, it would have brought the Malfoy name to shame- even more shame- had anyone seen him sliding down a slide, laughing like a child, with Harry Potter.
a book that could tell if you were really telling your deepest secret? He and Potter would most likely find a spell that could just open the damn book and tell them what counter-curse is needed to break the sleeping spell without having to expose a secret at all. And on top of that, they could break the barrier spell too.
Potter perked up even more when he saw Draco, and quickly jumped to his feet. “I’m guessing by the amount of time that went by, Snape was awake?”
“Draco. If you think you did something wrong-- whatever that something is-- you’re just filling yourself with unnecessary guilt.” Harry took a deep breath. “You were so… happy. Outside the Great Hall. What changed from then to now?”
After a minute or so, Draco knew he was going to become unaware of everything once again, and sometime again everything would repeat itself for the tenth time: swarming thoughts, Voldemort, screaming, comforting voice, noises, cold substance, darkness.
Draco cast his gaze down, and made his way to the very back of the room where Pansy was sitting. She seemed to be in mid-conversation with Blaise and Theo.
“Of course I know that, I figured that part out on my own. But for what I needed to do, three questions wouldn’t suffice. I needed to ask it
“Let me see!” Draco all but shouted as he tried to grab the paper from Pansy, but failed to grasp it because she was a
Draco considered their options for a moment. “I guess you can start working on defensive spells again. We really don’t have anything else to do until twelve tonight.”
“Hey,” Harry said. He was loud enough so that Draco could hear him over everything else, but quiet enough so that no one else could easily hear. “Can I talk to you?”
“You’ll be fine. And if he’s not awake just come back down and we’ll figure something else out,” Potter said calmly. Like he hadn’t just had a bout of unprecedented anger.
But those memories washed away, and what replaced them was the good moments. The moments of them two actually getting along and working together. The two of them sharing jokes, and even sharing a bed. Draco apologizing to Harry, and Harry saying sorry to Draco for all of the horrors he had to encounter. Actually becoming friends, something Draco had wanted ever since he had found out about the Boy Who Lived.
They had spent the rest of their day in the library searching through books, much like their previous days, except that time they were looking for a different type of counter-spell. After they had tried countless charms on Snape’s book, and the wretched thing had deflected each of them, they had moved on to spilling secrets again. They took turns saying anything that came to their mind. After a while, Potter’s secrets got a bit more deep, and Draco’s stayed at the same level of a tiny fib.
Draco’s fingers brushed over a book with an extremely bumpy spine, and he was instantly enthralled, pulling out the book to see if it was something worth reading to pass the time and get his mind off the offer.
He had heard muffled noises coming from outside the door, filled with lots of laughter and taunts. Such as:
But before he could make his decision, a new scenario formed, transporting Draco. A vision that Drys definitely had not created.
motivation, I realized. And like I said, the death of the Purebloods currently in Hogwarts will be much easier with them asleep.
Harry looked slightly uncomfortable, but he was mostly filled with relief at the notion that Draco wasn’t harming himself.
He stuck his hand in his robes pocket, feeling around for his wand, wanting to escape from whatever he was trapped in, when he heard a loud banging at the front door. His head snapped to where the sound was coming from, and he heard someone pressing buttons to turn off the contraption with the loud noises and moving pictures.
He was grasping at nothing now, holding on to strands of hope that just weren’t there and were never coming. His mind told him to just give up, but his heart told him to keep trying.
If the place Harry suggested turned out to be Hell itself, Draco knew he would gladly follow him there.
Draco snatched the Map, letting it hit the side of his leg as it hung limply in his hand. He moved towards the sound at the back of the library. “Stay here, I’ll go check it out,” Draco announced.
“What about Harry?” Draco asked, causing Harry to turn his head a bit. “What will happen to Harry in either one of the scenarios I choose?”
“You told me this book would provide me with any spell, potion, or any wizarding knowledge I planned to seek! I trusted it to help Harry and I with solving this
Draco promptly fled from the scene, moving past the dozens of students who had stopped to watch his and Potter’s altercation. As he moved through the halls, he subconsciously kept tugging at the sleeve that covered his left arm, pulling his robe sleeve down way farther than it needed to be. He kept feeling for his cufflinks that were clasped to his dress shirt that he wore under his robes, making sure they were secure. He knew he was being paranoid, but he just couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that a person- Harry Potter for that matter- actually touched his left arm. He felt like he was going to be sick.
He felt horrible about having to lie to Potter about something else, but he told himself he would eventually get around to telling Potter about the offer, right after he found out what exactly the offer was.
The door slammed open, which stopped all of the yelling; Draco was grateful. He was suspecting Harry to come bursting in, saving the day. Harry had specifically told him that he wouldn’t let Draco be arrested. The day that they had tested out the Restorative potion on Theo.
He started walking away from Drys, and then he was standing over Harry. Harry’s face seemed sort of distorted, and his mouth was moving, saying something.
- “It is almost nine o’clock, and Mr. Malfoy needs rest.” If he needed rest so badly, why did she let McGonagall talk to him? “Leave now.”
+Sorry for my extremely long absence once again, I hope my readers are still here! I'll be posting the epilogue this weekend sometime
It seemed like such a long time ago; his mother spontaneously writing to him about the consideration of selling the Manor.
Trying his best to straighten his posture, Draco said, “Look, Headmistress. I’m really fine. Sure, a little shaken up. But fine.” Draco didn’t want to lie to her. But, the alternative of actually relaying his feelings to one of the most respected and powerful witches, who fought on the side of the Order, was petrifying.
To no one's surprise, Draco was reading a random book in the library, while Harry was off practicing new defensive spells.
“It’s really no problem. I didn’t even do any work, really. The Room of Requirement provided me with everything,” Harry said.
Right on cue, Draco fell, tripping over his own feet, and skidded across the floor which was covered in dust. Well, it had been covered in dust until Draco had run and fell on it.
Suddenly he was in the Slytherin common room, and Pansy was running up to him, jumping into his arms and crying, getting her makeup all over Draco’s shirt, not that he cared in the slightest. It was a most incredible feeling.
Potter was probably right in this case though. Hogsmeade would offer answers as to whether anyone else was awake. If people were up and about, they could get help, and neither he nor Potter would have to do anything about the whole sleeping problem. They might expect Potter to do something though, since he was The Savior and all.
Draco figured out that taking walks alongside the Forbidden Forest and Black Lake greatly comforted him and eased his muscles and mind. When he wasn’t in classes on Wednesday, he found himself traversing the school grounds, clutching a book to his side.
He honestly couldn’t recount what Potter had exactly said, he’d been too preoccupied thinking of the fact that his mother was safe, that Potter was there, that Draco probably wouldn’t be going back to Azkaban,
He was probably going to get more Aurors, now that Draco was obviously awake. The world was still a bit fuzzy, and it was hard to concentrate on all that had happened, but he did remember the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and the small battle that had ensued there.
Draco whirled around in his spot by the fire to face Potter, shocked at all the talking and apologizing Potter had done in the last twenty four hours. “Why do you keep saying sorry? Why do you care about me after all the horrible things I’ve done to you?”
“Oh, wow okay I did not expect you to comply so easily. Well, er- I’m sorry about that. I guess I’ll just leave you then.” Draco heard Potter walk away from the door, and he was so relieved Potter had just
. No one had really ever held that power. Though, maybe Harry had always been good at reading Draco.
Potter and him had breakfast, took showers, and got ready for the lonely day ahead of them separately in the Room of Requirement. Draco had dressed in his Slytherin robes once again, for the lack of another idea as to what to wear, and that time Potter hadn’t commented on his outfit choices.
Harry found him instantly and sat down beside him on the bench. They didn’t talk for a minute or so, and Draco didn’t mind that. He liked having Harry beside him, the two of them gazing at the night sky and the London lights.
want to hear about fucking Kaspian. Was he jealous? Maybe a little. But he had every right to be. Kaspian was a downright dick and Harry still became friends with him right off the bat! Draco had been a dick and… he and Harry only just became friends. Sure, he and Kaspian’s situations were different, but the dick part wasn’t.
Moving his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation, Draco breathed out, “I can assure you, Harry,
He was excused from his classes while he was in the Hospital Wing, and he didn’t even have to make up the work. Harry had been told the same thing, given the event he had gone through, even though he hadn’t been in the Hospital Wing for more than two days. Although, Pansy said Harry still attended all his classes. Draco had a suspicion that was because Harry wouldn’t have been able to sit around doing nothing until Draco came out of the Hospital Wing.
. He was often referred to as the “Last Death Eater” which really didn’t help with the thoughts. He felt alone in that way, in a twisted, sickening manner.
She straightened out, finally pulling away from Draco, but leaving her hand on his shoulder. “I know darling, I am truly amazing, no need to remind me. Actually, I love being reminded, keep the praises coming.”
Harry now brought both hands to cup his cheeks, and the warmth that his touch brought was exhilarating. It was perfect, and it was Draco’s. “Thank you for finding me,” Harry said. “For filling the gap inside of me.”
“I was too scared!” Draco cried. “I told you last night that I hadn’t changed, and this is what I was talking about! I blindly followed another dark wizard, Harry! And I didn’t even have the courage to ask for help. Looks like the war hadn’t taught me anything.”
“You see, Potter. We just watched a rock evaporate before our eyes when it crossed the ward. I don’t think an owl could break past it.”
A weird word, most definitely, but an interesting one nonetheless. Even though he really couldn’t recall any details from the session, he remembered that one word, and its meaning.
Somehow his vision from that night lit a fire inside him, and it made him feel different: more alert and collected. He guessed it had been because he and his family were threatened by some psychopath, and now he felt more motivated than ever to get the potion finished, and be ready for a fight if it came down to it.
Potter went straight to the counter that would have been selling Butterbeer and other alcoholic drinks, under normal circumstances.
Harry stayed still, his breathing only just heard over the crackling of the fire, and Draco didn’t mind. He didn’t mind if Harry didn’t speak for hours. Draco would wait, just like Harry did for him.
Draco smirked. “I’m surprised you even had the decency to wake me. I would have thought you’d have just left me to wake up in the morning covered in blood and bruises or something.”
Draco wanted to imagine, at the very least, Harry fancied him. He really hoped Harry fancied him, because if not, looking back at their night spent dancing, Draco felt like he wanted to throw up. Knowing that he had said and done things that were entirely inappropriate to say and do with a straight man, who didn’t see Draco in
It was crazy loud, music blasting from a wireless and the chattering of mostly eighth year students filling the enclosed space. Draco spotted Harry instantly, surrounded by Gryffindors at a table in the center of the room, sipping a drink. His black hair was tousled more than usual and his nose and cheeks were pink. Draco stopped breathing for a moment, until Pansy pushed him farther inside.
that there was somehow some way to get out of what was inevitably going to happen. In the back of his mind he thought,
The mention of Alec woke Drys up once again. “But he isn’t purely Muggle-born!” Drys spoke quickly, hoping to get his point across before they decided to use the killing curse again. “
“Okay look, oh Chosen One, you might not get in serious trouble for breaking and entering, but I most certainly will.” Draco remarked.
“I think I’m feeling well enough to do it now,” Draco responded, which was the truth. What was also the truth, was that he just wanted to get it over with. He didn’t want to have to sleep again and wake up with dread, knowing he’d have to subject his memories to a Pensieve.
It had been extremely difficult to make, especially with only about three months to do it all. At times they’d wanted to use Snape’s magical book for help, holding every known fact in the Wizarding World, but decided against it. Snape’s real book had been returned to him after the whole ordeal, and Draco and Harry decided no one should be using that kind of book, no one should hold that much power in their hands.
“Oh.” Potter looked surprised that Slughorn didn’t just agree with him and let him work with his two best friends.
It was also lucky that Potter didn’t catch on to the fact that the reason why Draco had asked if his scar had hurt at all, was because Draco’s scar
On the other hand, Theo could be poisoned from the Restorative Potion; his breaths ceasing to exist. He would be blamed for Theo’s murder, and would be sent to Azkaban for the rest of his life. He wasn’t positive if even Harry’s pleas for Draco’s release would be accepted this time round’. The only bright side to that outcome was Theo dying, but at lengthy costs. Though, he wasn’t sure he could live with himself any longer with blood on his hands, even if it was Theo’s blood.
Draco was slightly leaning against Harry’s chest, but Harry was still holding back for the strangest reason. “You can hold me,” Draco said, and quickly added, “If you want, that is.”
The tall silver gate that marked the start of the path to Hogsmeade came into view, and so did the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He was less than a minute away from saving Harry. Somehow.
Draco gently touched Harry’s cheek. He gently pushed back his hair that covered his lightning scar and brushed his thumb over it. He saw one of his tears fall on Harry’s forehead, trickling down and down.
“Well then this-” he gestured vaguely at the empty halls around them- “whole thing happens. I feel like it might not be a coincidence. What if the figure in my dream was trying to tell me something? What if it's another Hogwarts student or teacher who’s awake and needs help?”
Draco nodded solemnly, he’d guessed Harry wouldn’t have been able to run given the state he was currently in, but it was worth a try suggesting it. “Okay, just- just be careful. Don’t do anything too rash.”
At first, it was a chaste touch of lips, both of them unsure of what they should be doing. But, with that uncertainty came the two of them wanting to experience more, even if things were quite diffident.
Potter was so fucking insistent with everything. Why out of all people in Hogwarts did Draco have to be stuck with the most annoying, insistent ponce? But Draco knew he had to say something, or at least something a lot more than “Nothing” and “I’m fine.” He settled with telling Potter something a bit personal, even though it was a lie, but he knew Potter would believe it and it would get him off his back. “Okay, the truth is, being in the Room of Requirement is a bit… much. I’m sort of having, I don’t know, flashbacks? To all the times I’ve been in here,” Draco said.
another presence, there was no one. Nothing in sight except for the stone walls and the dusty floors and-
Harry blushed. “That’s not what I was going to ask.” He moved his attention away from Draco’s chest, and briefly glanced at Draco’s left arm, making him feel hot even in the freezing air.
Draco couldn’t put his finger on what the fuck was wrong with Potter. Draco knew for sure he had not been the one who ensued the uncomfortable silence, he had actually felt lighter than ever since his confession.
He did not want to go to the Hospital Wing. He couldn’t face Madame Pomfrey. He couldn’t have yet another person see the Mark. It was all too much, especially for one night. But, he also didn’t want to have to walk the halls of Hogwarts. He didn’t know how late it was, but he was sure some students would still be up. He could ask Granger if she knew any charms to repair clothing, but that would be way too embarrassing.
He didn’t stay around long enough to hear Potter’s response, and he had a feeling he hadn’t even been heard, since Potter was so focused on getting the charm correct. It was a good thing that Potter’s center of attention wasn’t on Draco, though. Draco was going to do something utterly horrible.
Waking up in the morning was a bizarre experience. He’d woken up next to Harry plenty of times during the Curse, and yet, this time it was entirely different.
“We should get something to eat.” Potter stated. A light dusting of snow had started, covering Potter’s hat and shoulders with white flakes. They both noticeably shivered against the cold. “We should also get warm for a bit.”
It was a little past five o’clock when Harry Potter came barging into the library. He was dressed in a really thick coat, and had discarded his Hogwarts robes. There was a Gryffindor scarf draped around his neck, along with a matching hat covering his messy hair, and gloves already on his hands.
He had been alone for at most ten minutes, and he already began to miss Harry more than his mind could even comprehend. They promised never to separate, but here they both were, breaking that key rule, and not for the first time.
Attached to the exam was a note from his Transfigurations teacher, Professor Wynn, writing to Slughorn because Draco had apparently gotten a perfect grade on the written exam, but Wynn was reluctant to give him an O. “
Potter had been trying to master the spell for the last six hours. At first Draco had been more than happy to help Potter learn the spell, but after the first two hours, he had lost interest. He knew he should have been helping, but Potter was
It was now Potter’s turn to huff in annoyance. “Merlin, just let me finish my sentence!” Potter looked like he was waiting for Draco to interrupt again, but Draco was actually curious as to what Potter had to say. He continued on, “Okay, well I tried waking them up, but no one moved. Like I shook them each numerous times, and everyone just continued sleeping. I tried waking them up with a couple jinxes, but they still didn’t bloody move!” Potter was pacing frantically now, and Draco could honestly relate to Potter’s hysteria.
“I was. But, as a child, my… friends, used to make fun of me. But, now that I think back to it, it was so stupid, because like, I know plenty of people who have
Draco stayed in the bathroom a tiny bit longer to get ready for bed, and once he was finally done, he realized he was nervous to face Harry, if he wasn’t asleep yet.
So here he was now, helplessly banging on the door, hoping that someone would come by and let him out. He had tried countless opening spells on the door, but nothing worked. He didn’t know how the people who had locked him in the closet had secured the door so well. But that didn’t matter now, because he had to get to class. His transfigurations professor would not believe him in the slightest if Draco told him that he had gotten locked in a closet, which was why he was late. Even if his story was believed, his professor wouldn’t care, and Draco would be given detention for tardiness, which meant a one way ticket back to Azkaban.
He rubbed at his eyes and yawned, while feeling around for his wand on the couch. Once he found it, he cast a quick
Potter was sitting with his back against a wall when Draco got to the bottom of the steps and passed by the gargoyle. He seemed to be in a slightly better mood than the one he was in before; he was humming some song and tapping his foot to the beat, and Draco almost laughed and smiled at the vulnerability and human side Potter was showing.
When Draco officially woke up and could actually think straight, he realized he was in the Hospital Wing. He was lying on a hospital bed, with covers up to his chest. He noticed he wasn’t in his school robes anymore, and was in a set of pyjamas that clearly weren’t his.
to Potter. Potter was the noble hero whose job was to be kind to everyone, even if that included, well, a person like Draco.
Of course he would be the one to save the day. Draco should have known that Potter would be the one to eventually free him. It only made sense.
Maybe Harry did like him. Maybe Harry loved him. He didn’t want to get his hopes up, but everything Harry had done for Draco ever since he had ran away from the library, showed that Harry truly cared about him.
Within that week, his mother had sat next to him in a small chair, talking about her plans of whether or not to sell the Manor, talking about different memories of her and Lucius during their Hogwarts days, and reminiscing on different moments from Draco’s childhood.
Draco reached the blank stretch of wall in the dungeons and rested against it for a second, relieving his aching chest of more walking.
Draco was about to snap at the moron who hadn’t been paying attention, because certainly it wasn’t his own fault, when he recognized who said moron was.
Draco unlocked the bathroom door, trying to reign in his shaky breaths before attempting to fall back asleep. First thing when they woke up, Draco would tell Harry he had had another vision, circling around the details of his offer.
What the cloaked figure had said was utterly crazy and ridiculous, and could not possibly be true. Right? He wanted to believe it not to be true, but he had a nagging feeling spreading throughout him that the figure was right. Draco couldn’t be sure, since the two week timeline wasn’t up yet, and nothing dangerous had come to pass, but his gut told him he should listen to the figure.
His mother went next, and she had been sentenced to a year and a half of house arrest and five months of community service when she was allowed to step foot outside the manor’s grounds. Potter had shown up then, and had given testimony on his mother’s behalf. He had told the Wizengamot that Narcissa had lied directly to the Dark Lord. Apparently, when she was asked if Potter had been alive after the Dark Lord tried to kill him, his mother had said Potter was in fact dead, when he
“Okay, let’s do this.” Harry took out his wand, and Draco assumed that even though Harry had said ‘let’s,’ plural, he concluded he’d be the one casting the spell.
As they walked to Slughorn’s classroom together, talking about whatever came to their minds, like Quidditch and their favorite kinds of food, Draco became exceedingly aware of how much of a difference Potter was acting today, compared to the night before.
Draco wanted to say more, whatever more was. But Drys pointed his wand again at Draco saying, “Let’s duel.”
Harry glanced down at himself. “I don’t think I can run. I think something happened to my leg. And I’m sure I’ll just break into a coughing fit if I overestimate my running or even walking abilities. Also, Alec is probably going to be watching me like a hawk while you and Drys are occupied.”
Draco wanted to scream back at Harry, but all his energy was focused on not having a massive anxiety attack, and not raking the razor across his forearm. Both things that were incredibly hard not to do when someone was banging on a door and yelling at you, aggravating you even more.
“Afraid it’s me, Potter. Though I wouldn’t expect you to notice I’ve changed.” Draco felt a snowflake fall directly on the tip of his nose.
Drys saw where Draco was looking, and stepped a little farther away from Draco, turning his full attention to Harry, wand raised and a face full of vexation.
Harry apparently lost all motion in his right arm for a week, the arm that Draco had cut, and his leg had been broken. Draco added that on to the long list of things to talk about and apologize for whenever the next time he saw Harry was.
Draco was almost just as in shock as Narcissa was, seeing his mother for the first time since Summer. Since he had left for his eighth year at Hogwarts. They never really wrote to each other- well, on the occasion that Narcissa did write, Draco never wrote back. He always knew that was the reason Narcissa stopped sending letters.
“I will not! I won’t do anything you say until you tell me if you’ve done anything to hurt Harry!” Draco practically screamed.
Draco felt his heart crack. The sight of Potter crying, the sight of the Wizarding World’s savior breaking down in tears, was gut-wrenching. He wanted to do
His head felt better too, and he now had the capability to sit up properly, looking around on the floor next to him for the book he’d dropped.
When he finished eating most of his food, and set his plate aside, he had to admit he was feeling sort of tired. He was getting settled in his bed, ready to try and sleep when he felt it. A faint burning feeling coming from his left forearm. Draco shook his head, he knew he was imagining it. He had felt similar feelings ever since the Dark Lord had perished. The burning was a figment of his imagination; his trauma. However, he thought to himself,
evil. I woke you up because you really would have been covered in blood if I’d just left you here. Theo and a couple other Eighth Years are coming back any second now. I thought you might have wanted to leave.”
Draco shook his head violently. He was usually an excellent liar, but his heart was pounding like crazy and he could feel the blood rushing through his veins, along with a ringing in his ear; he supposed Harry would be able to see right through his lies when he replied to Harry’s question. “Uh, no. Nothing. Just the wind.” Draco gestured outside, where it was in fact insanely windy, blowing around dead leaves and snow.
“I had to put Hogwarts and Hogsmeade under a sleeping curse, to try and motivate you, Draco. Hogsmeade is too close to Hogwarts, though, to not notice something was wrong, so they had to be under the sleeping curse too. I knew that you’d want to be the hero so badly, you would certainly take any offer of mine to save hundreds of lives. Sure, I threatened your family, but you needed
“Well, we’re here,” Potter said as they arrived at the gargoyle signifying the entrance to McGonagall’s office.
Draco would brew the potion correctly. He was sure of it. And then Harry would never need to find out about the horrible offer and what Draco was supposed to do, since everyone would be awake, and there wouldn’t be a sword hanging over Draco’s head anymore. There wasn’t anyone whose potion skills could even compare to Draco’s. Except Severus Snape, perhaps, but that was a different story.
and his words were so soothing. He always said exactly what Draco needed to hear, whether he liked it or not. Forgiving himself first was obviously easier said than done, and he knew Harry knew that, but the advice was still lovely to hear.
Blaise and Pansy’s faces were lit up like a Christmas tree, and their smiles nearly took up their entire face. They knew damn well this is what he’d always wanted in life, had wanted since he had heard of the great hero Harry Potter at the age of three. Draco’s face was failing to conceal boredom; he couldn’t help but smile at all the attention he was receiving. It was all quite overwhelming, when he really thought about it, but the sheer ridiculousness and surprise of the situation canceled all of his anxieties out.
There were students who had parents who worked in the Ministry, of course. And everyone knew that Ministry workers, especially Aurors, couldn’t keep their bloody mouths shut. All it took was for one Auror who had looked into Draco’s Pensieve to tell one other person, and the chain reaction began.
So Potter was back to calling him Draco again. He had to admit, he liked hearing his name come out of Potter’s mouth.
“Drys gave me two options. I’d sort of known about these options ever since he talked to me through the vision, but not really. The first option he gave me was that I was to willingly cut your skin--to procure your blood. The second option was that I refuse to cut you and my family dies, the school stays asleep forever, and I would be directly blamed for these things.”
“While you were off doing… who knows what you did, with Potter, I used what you gave me.” He made a grandiose gesture at the Death Eaters. “And now, you can meet my new friends.”
Potter had it easy. Sure, maybe he was plagued with all the deaths that happened in the war, and maybe he felt everything that had happened over the past couple of years was his fault, but at least he didn’t have to deal with a reminder of all his past mistakes etched onto his skin. Potter’s scar was a trophy of his heroism and bravery. Even if he did receive the damn thing when he was a baby.
He was thrown into multiple visions, playing out different scenarios based on his decisions. The one that obviously seemed the best was the one where Draco accepted the Pull. Accepted to turn to Drys and not have to feel the pain as Harry died, and as the Purebloods in Hogwarts died. At the end of every scenario, though, he would die.
“We’re very different. I think that the only reason you think that is because we both went through the same war and came out mentally scathed.”
Draco rolled his eyes. She always brought up Theo’s name in conversation when she wanted to get a reaction from Draco.
They officially had less than a week until this coming Sunday, and Draco became more anxious as time went on. Harry seemed stressed too, but not to the same extent as Draco, obviously.
“I’ll be by your side, too,” Harry said. There was a moment of silence between them, the only sound audible was the wind and their quick, short breaths. “Now, I know you told me specifically not to ever pluck an Anemonlea, since they’re rare, but…”
Another person had officially seen his mark of loyalty to the most evil of wizards. Fucking fantastic. At this point, he wished he would have just been left to die rather than know that one third of the “Golden Trio” had seen his Dark Mark.
There were times during the Curse when he thought he had a chance with Harry. It was easy to believe anything during that time, though. The Curse had thoroughly fucked with his brain, that was all.
Without Harry, he felt like the way he’d felt before the whole curse had started: terribly empty, alone, and like no one loved him. He felt like there was no reason to fight for another tomorrow, and how was he supposed to look out for Harry, and for Hogwarts, when he couldn’t look out for himself?
She brought him some toast and butter, along with an apple. Draco mentally thanked her for not trying to force him to eat a large meal. He slowly took bites of his food, resisting the urge to gag. This year it had been even harder than previous years for him to eat, and he didn’t exactly know the reason why. The Dark Lord was gone. He should be scarfing down food, something he hadn’t done since Fifth year.
Countless times before, Draco remembered feeling like the world had stopped when he and Harry were in close proximity. But now, the world was aflame, and everything was alive, and the world was dancing around them, letting time and space kneel to their every need.
He and Potter had definitely moved into the area of uncomfortable silence with each other once again, and Draco detested it. He didn’t really think it would be possible to fall back into the thick tension with Potter, after everything they had been through together the last couple of days, but he’d been wrong.
His eyes immediately fell on two large portraits hanging high above the chair that McGonagall would surely have been sitting in if she were awake. He immediately locked eyes with Severus Snape, forcing himself not to look at the portrait next to Snape's that contained Albus Dumbledore, who was surely gazing down at him with contempt.
saw her feed it, and yet Mr. Cat was still alive. He came to the conclusion that the animals were fine.
Which, consequently meant that there were no other distractions aside from Harry, possibly the most distracting entity in the universe. For more reasons than one.
“I was wondering, do you have any idea why that is? I mean, why didn't I die?” He finished off at the edge of his seat, literally and figuratively.
been perfect. The thing between him and Harry made it far from that. Although, granted, some aspects of his new found life were pretty nice.
He settled with a short pat on the back; the touch slightly startling Potter. It was an extremely quick show of affection, but it made Potter smile a small sad smile, which Draco knew was a win. His eyes were red and puffy, his expression still heartbreakingly sad, but that smile made Draco want to reach out to Potter again. He was about to act on his intention when Potter shifted slightly away in his seat, presumably trying to hide his tears, so Draco’s hand fell to his lap.
He cast a quick heating charm, thankful he had at least remembered his wand in his hasty attempt at running away from Harry. It wasn’t the most powerful charm he’d ever casted, but it would be enough of a substitute for his warm winter coat.
Madame Pomfrey looked like she was going to say something else, but the door to the Hospital Wing flew open, and in walked Professor McGonagall, which made Pomfrey turn towards the sound. Pomfrey swiftly left Draco’s bedside to talk to McGonagall.
He then saw his father, who was sitting in a cell in Azkaban. Lucius was so far from the man he once was, but as Draco and Narcissa stood before him, Draco knew that Lucius was satisfied. Draco told his father how much he loved him.
Once again, his mind wandered to silly questions, like how were the flowers and other types of organisms alive? Sure, the plants had sunlight coming from… who knows where, possibly a spell, but what about the soil and water needed? From what he could tell, the plants were growing out of the cobblestone, and there were no traces of water to be found. The only conclusion he could come up with was that whoever had created the Garden had spelled it, allowing the plants to grow without their usual necessities.
He looked at the doors that led to the Great Hall, watching as some people stopped to eye him warily, while others walked right into the Hall, not glancing back at the top of the stairs like some of the paranoid creeps.
“Maybe not,” she said thoughtfully. “But, how I see it, what truly matters, is how you use that past, and shape it into a better tomorrow-” Draco looked up at that. It sounded like something Harry had said to him- “And might I add, you have a very handsome young man looking out for you.”
Harry didn’t seem to get the memo, and was attempting to pull Draco back into his arms when Draco had to push at Harry’s chest, his eyes pleading for Harry to leave him alone.
He sat up farther in his bed, shifting to get more comfortable. He thought about his dream again. Was it a dream? It felt more than that. It felt like someone had actually entered his mind. That was ridiculous, though. No one could have entered his mind, he knew that. He was exceptionally good at Occlumency, and rarely ever kept his shields down.
His fingers raked over the material covering his left forearm. Before he knew it, he was scratching the damned Dark Mark, even though his sleeve was still covering the actual skin. He scratched until he felt the movement was a part of him, like the scratching movement was a second nature to him. And maybe, maybe if he kept on scratching and never stopped, the clothing material would fade away, and then soon after, the Mark would too.
“Just listen. You are a constant in my life, Draco. A pain in arse, but a constant whether either of us like it or not. I think back to first year, and I think, if you weren’t such a-”

Ever since the offer, Draco wanted to enforce the prospect of learning new defense spells now more than ever. The figure made it clear he wanted Draco to comply with him and only him, and since Draco obviously wasn’t going to take the figure up on his offer, the next best thing for them was to be prepared and ready.

They continued to sit in each other’s company, Draco counting the stars while thinking about how Harry had picked up a Latin book and memorized a phrase… to impress him? Maybe? He could have been reading into the whole thing too much, and Harry could have picked up the book just because he was bored, but even though Harry was pretty dense, he had a beautiful, complex mind, and maybe
Potter then looked back at Draco, and he seemed confused as to why Draco hadn’t retorted something snarky and rude.
Potter had literally caused an explosion in the exact right area of the library, which made the secret hatch in the floor apparent to them, and inside the hatch held a useful book that could literally solve all of their problems. Draco didn’t want to say he was an extremely lucky bloke, but yeah, he definitely was an extremely lucky bloke.
He turned away from Harry as he said: “Goodnight.” He hoped since he wasn’t facing Harry, he wouldn’t be able to hear Draco speak, but, nonetheless, Harry told him goodnight back, tugging on the covers a little.
His plan was to write a letter to his father in Azkaban, asking if his Mark had started moving once again like Draco’s. He
The song seemed to fill the room, and while the Garden felt freezing a couple of minutes ago, it now felt scorching hot. Or maybe that was just Draco’s cheeks burning up while he watched Harry move to the music, a look of euphoria on his face.
