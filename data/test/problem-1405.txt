Ginny regarded her warily but took the offered hand and shook it. Before she could reply, Harry broke in.
Loire had been looking at the plans that were sprawled out on the floor. She looked up at Harry and lifted an inquiring eyebrow.
George slowly cocked a red eyebrow, shifting his eyes from Draco to Potter and back again. "How about you tell me what you're looking for-"
Draco's head was bent down, looking at a piece of parchment. His white-blonde hair fell forward, grazing his cheekbones. And really, Harry thought it was just unfair Draco was able to pull off that hair style in his late thirties.
He heard Ginny move closer. He hoped she wouldn't recognize him, all she could see was the back of his hoodie.
Harry looked carefully at her and decided that any secrets she held he was far from equipped to uncover. But, he knew Hermione loved Ron, and he knew that Pansy had created the fashion line, PEP, so the story checked out, at least on the surface. When he looked at Pansy he found her to be pointedly ignoring him, using a hand mirror to refresh her lipstick.
“I have to shower,” Harry said, feeling wrong footed at how pleased Draco seemed. Both Slytherins laughed at him and left the room.
"Draco, would you try on this jumper?" Blaise asked. "It's terrible for my skin tone but Pansy says you'll look perfect in it."
Potter called for an elf named Kreacher. Blaise had seen this elf before, when he had brought Potter food. He let Kreacher blather on about some of the students before requesting dinner. Blaise tugged his school bag onto his bed to pull out his potions text. He would still have to write his essay for tomorrow.
Hermione smiled, and he knew she was closing in on a mental victory lap at being proven right. "Go on, tell me what his name means. I'll even give you something, I knew it meant dragon, I also know it's a constellation."
Pansy sat up in the bed and narrowed her dark eyes at him, "What did you say?" she asked, words cutting through the air like glass.
"All true, and all legal," George said, giving them both a broad grin. "I'm not giving them up either. You two are my biggest sellers."
Draco gave an exaggerated shudder. "It concerns me how easily you are able to imitate him," he said as they walked towards the parlor.
He got to the landing and stepped into Neville's room. "Hey," Harry said, pulling a flask from the pocket of his blazer, "I brought you some firewhiskey."
So he had asked Aunt Pansy last Tuesday when she had come by to meet with Draco. Pansy had not been encouraging. She’d smiled, pinched his cheek, and said, “You’re in very real danger Scorpius Malfoy, and it’s going to take years for you to figure it out.”
Dudley looked as though he was trying not to smile, instead, he forced his face into a grimace. “Do you want to switch seats Mum?” he asked.
“I honestly hadn’t considered that.” Harry’s brows cinched together. He was not going to talk about the war. He and Draco had done that conversation, more than once, years ago. The first time had been after the war trials, and Harry hadn’t been able to think through the conversation. The last time was when Draco showed up for Teddy’s twelfth birthday party. They’d both given apologies for previous transgressions and come to the decision that they should be cordial.
Harry stole Ron's lager and took a swig for himself, eyeing his friend suspiciously, and said, "Care to update me on your life, Ron?"
Draco's sighs and nods. Seeing Potter in his clothes makes his stomach flip pleasantly, but his mind is suspicious of the motive. So much for feeling like he had a handle on this night.
He sat himself in the chair across from Hermione's desk and recounted the tale of the Wallbanger. He left out the details of the last two nights, choosing instead to end with, "and that's why I'm here. Because if you don't help me, I'll likely end up in the Janus Thickey Ward."
"No," Draco said, interrupting him. Then, addressing Potter, he added, "I thought you said he was going to cooperate."
"Why would I do that? Didn't enough boys say your name over the summer?" Draco asked casually, with his head still laid back on the cloak. Harry wondered how he could think so clearly mid blowjob.
He unpacked the food and explained the prep work to Kreacher. They had worked out a way to work together in the kitchen after the first month of incessant fighting. Kreacher let Harry cook breakfast every day, and dinner three times a month as long as he could do the food prep. They got take away twice a month, and Kreacher made the rest of the meals.
Madam Malkin’s wasn't crowded this time of year, usually the worst of it was August. Because of that, Astrid and Scorpius were both able to get walk in appointments for robes. When the attendant tried to move Scorpius to a different room he felt Astrid's hand slip into his and tug him back to her.
"I um-" Blaise's said, over the ragged sound of his own heavy breathing. He wrapped his fingers around Neville's wrist, intending to push him away.
Harry stood and led Draco out to the patio, with Kreacher following behind them, carrying their drinks. Normally there was a sofa on the right side of the covered patio and a table for 6 with chairs on the left, with a plush rug in between them. However, when Harry opened the door to the patio he stopped short and stared dumbly at two large chaise lounge chairs he had never seen before with a small table in the middle.
"Draco," Astoria's voice came through the door again and Draco reached forward to open it. She stepped in, as though she belonged there.
Zabini paused and looked back at him, eyes narrow, “Don’t play chicken with me, Potter. It won’t end well for you.”
Blaise walked into the common room to find Potter and Draco sitting on the loveseat together, homework tucked into their laps.
He jumped when Draco soundlessly grabbed his wrist and guided Harry, to walk behind him. Pansy took up the spot behind Harry and they walked in a line instead of side by side. It's weird to walk single file, but the people in front part quickly when they are faced with Draco Malfoy. Harry's not sure if that's from fear or genuine dislike, but right now he doesn't care, he's happy to have the crowd held off. Behind him Pansy threw a casual jinx at anyone who got too close to her, and eventually, the crowd grants them a wide berth.
Harry wasn't sure but he flashed a smile just in case. Sighing, Draco pulled his wand from nowhere, or at least Harry couldn't see where he'd had it, and cast a memory modification charm at the Muggle. The man lifted himself off the wall seeming to come out of a daze. He smiled lazily at Draco, handed him $100 and went down the stairs.
“Actually I did have a purpose for coming to see you this evening,” Draco said. Then added, in false sweetness, “I assume you have friends to share confessions with, but if you would rather discuss your homoerotic awakening with me, I can make some time.”
“Well Potter,” Pansy said, resheathing her own wand, “You’ve never saved me, so I guess this means you owe me now.”
She looked him over with a critical eye, "Are you alright? You look a little," she trailed off, seeming unsure of how to finish the sentence.
Harry grimaced, "Well, obviously. Hermione is smarter than everyone though. I'd be dead if it wasn't for her."
Harry growled, bit the hem of the other boys boxers and pulled them down so he could wrap his mouth around Draco's cock. This was something Harry had really taken time to perfect over the summer. He licked the head of his cock, tasting the precum, then
“Fuck, I want you,” Potter pants out the words while rutting against Draco’s thigh, his hands grip hard into the blonde's biceps as the pleasure built from his toes and traveled up his body.
Potter chuckles, and bites-sucks Draco's neck. "That would explain why my cock reacts to you as if you're a walking wet dream." Potter groans when Draco's hand pushes past the barrier of Potter's pants to grip his cock. "It wouldn't explain why you're always on my mind though," Potter says.
“Oh,” Harry said, thinking that he should do the same. The last letter he’d sent Ron was about the bond between him and Blaise, so he wanted to update him on the potion being brewed to get him out of it. “Are you,” he started, and then trailed off. He’d been trying to keep his nose out of their relationship since 4th year. Still, he was curious.
As Harry made his way back to the floo, he spotted Lucius Malfoy standing by it. Harry quickly glanced around to make sure they were alone before he crossed the rest of the tiled floor to stand in front of him. Knowing the threat of Draco going to Azkaban had been nullified allowed a flood of bitter emotions to course through him. He let his distaste show openly on his face, only to see it matched in Lucius’ own hostile expression.
Draco didn't kiss him. He did, however, let his tongue run against Harry's bottom lip before he whispered, "I'll think about it, Potter."
Draco managed to turn the doorknob he pressed against and Harry pushed him roughly into the room. Harry started to tug at Draco’s endless buttons, desperate for skin to skin contact, while covering him with bruising kisses. Draco bucked his hips at the perfect angle for his erection to stroke against Harry’s, causing Harry’s knees to buckle, and bat his hand away before Harry ripped the buttons off.
"It wasn't all bad," Charlie replies, his eyes dropping slowly over Harry's tight black t-shirt to the low-slung baggy jeans belted at his hips.
As his brain begins to catchup with the panicked response of his body, Harry chances a glance at the man next to him. The Malfoy next to him, the one Harry had pushed against the wall and kissed with eager, desperate, overdue, passion. The one he'd already told too much. The man he'd
It must have worked because he yelled it several times in rapid succession. When they surfaced, James looked up to find his father giving him a
Draco cocks his head and watches Potter's eyes drop to Draco's long neck. "Potter, two weeks ago you got upset when you thought a customer was hitting on me because he complimented my shirt."
The smirk grew and she slanted those blue eyes on him, her head tilting only a fraction towards him, "Watch your sass, Gryffindor."
Harry peeked over at Neville, who was wearing baggy denims and a tight-fitting charcoal Henley with long sleeves. Zabini was in tailored trousers and a blue button-down. Harry decided on denims. He tore off his robes and started to pull clothes out of the closet.
"Salazar's saggy… this place could be amazing if it were properly…. Why do you live here if you hate it?"
"Well, I've worked out that it has to do with me at least. So," he said with a shrug, "if you want to ask me questions I'm willing."
"Ron is here and he's pissed off Ginny." Harry grabbed Draco's wand, handing it to him, and pocketed his own.
Harry cocked an eyebrow at her and she laughed. The sound of it, light and easy, diffused some of the tension in Harry's shoulders.
The students closest to the door filed in as McGonagall left. It didn’t take long for the uproar to start, the students already in the common room loudly complaining about their room assignments.
With a brief glance to Blaise and Neville, Potter stepped up close to Draco. Blaise watched closely, noting his friends measured breathing and calm exterior. Only the fluttering pulse point of his pale neck gave away how fast his heart was beating. Blaise heard Potter speaking in low tones but he couldn't make out the words. He might have leaned closer, out of pure curiosity, if Neville hadn't distracted him with a touch.
It was the right way to go because Harry smiled, "Honestly?" he asked before continuing without an answer, "Draco was a suspect in a case that I was assigned to."
“Do not ‘yes love’ me. Get out of the shower and put your clothes on! We need to leave or I’m going to be late.”
Harry stayed silent. There was no use trying to fight that statement without knowing what had happened.
"My name is Dudley," he said, throwing his hands up in an attempt at surrender. "I'm Harry Potter's cousin."
Traveling through the ballroom Astrid spotted Draco's parents again. She tugged at Scorpius' sleeve, the material of his shirt much softer than the suit jacket he'd left at the table. When he turned back to her she leaned in and said, "I will meet you out there. I want to do something first."
You can't misinterpret the sound of a good spanking, and someone was receiving one next door. Finally, he heard the man next door groaning and Harry assumed whoever was over there had gotten off. Harry took the opportunity to remove himself fully from the bed, shoving off his blankets and springing to his feet. He moved the bed a few inches from the wall, sending it a fresh glare before getting back under the covers.
"Oh, um-" Harry swallowed, his mind drifting back to first year, to the graveyard, to the sound of his mother screaming. "It was my parents. I was with my parents," he said quietly.
Harry gave a humorless laugh, "What about the Muggle-born Registration Commission? Surely that wasn't legal?"
"Well," Scorpius replied, trying to give off an heir of nonchalance, "it's good for us to be charitable. She is magical, after all. We should help."
"Blaise," Pansy said, grabbing his hand, "Neville isn't going to marry a pureblood girl. He likes you. Stop sabotaging your own happiness."
Harry rolled his eyes, pulled out a chair across from him and sat down. “No, it’s just the post” he said, annoyed with how defensive it sounded.
Potter looked up eyeing Blaise wearily before offering a curt nod. Blaise gave a friendly smile, the same one he used to use on Seamus at the beginning of term. Potter stood and left the room, motioning for Blaise to follow him.
"So, how come you're hanging out with the Slytherins then?" George asked, his voice slightly strangled as he eyed the way Ginny was talking with Pansy.
“I’m here for a couple of reasons Potter,” she replied, looking around the hallway with her nose crinkled. “Do you have somewhere else we can talk?”
Harry seemed to relax at that, saying, "I think there's something wrong with their brains," he looked fondly at Astrid, "can't turn it off long enough to sleep a proper 8 hours."
More importantly, did it matter that this was one more thing the Drarry fandom had gotten right? How many was that now?
Harry shrugged, "She doesn't know about last night, but she's figured out how I-" he cut himself off biting into his cheek.
Harry fought to keep eye contact, feeling his heart pound against his ribcage, as he said, "Maybe we could just see what happens?"
They both looked up to find Professor Loire in the entryway to the nearly built common room. Harry was surprised to see her hair down, tumbling in red curls past her shoulders. "Hello Professor," he said.
Three stone gargoyles stared up at them with ugly faces. Teddy put a hand on the middle statue, the one using his hands to cover his mouth. He looked at James and gave a little nod. "Come on."
Harry didn't say anything to that, just nodded and looked at the floor. Robards had offered to meet with Harry too but he'd declined.
A light layer of bubbles spread out from the wand, quickly covering the surface. This was perfect. The bubbles were multi colored, giving up a scent of lavender and cinnamon. Best of all, you couldn’t see through them.
While his dad went to check, James took the opportunity to lean into Teddy and whisper, "Do you want to hang out in my room for a bit, or are you going to bed?"
"You're very good," Draco said, the words spoken quietly, as though they were a confession. The words shuddered through Harry, and he mentally congratulated himself for wearing baggy jeans as he felt an impending erection start to swell.
"You! You are what happened." Draco grabbed Harry's face, smashing his cheeks, and said, "Listen to the words I'm saying. I can't
"Actually you've got all of that wrong," Harry said, "My first kiss was in 4th year, with a boy," he finished boldly.
"Ronald! Shut up, you're going to draw attention," Hermione said, hitting him on the arm with her book.
Inexplicably, Draco blushed and became very interested in one of the portraits hanging behind the Headmistress’ desk.
Potter told him the address and number 12 squeezed itself into view. Draco stepped forward, taking a steadying breath. If the fanfics were wrong the wards would react and this experiment could leave Draco in a severe amount of pain.
“I’ve spent a fair amount of time with her.” Harry shrugged and smiled back, “She hates it though when I call her Pansy.”
"I was hoping you could take me to Little Whinging and help me beat the shit out of Dudley Dursley," Draco replied.
Harry hummed in response and took another sip of his tea. After a few minutes he said, "Honestly Astrid it's a long story, one I'm not a fan of reliving. I will tell you a couple of things about it though, ok?"
He still had a hand on the mark, which he let slip down to secure Draco's wrist. His right hand moved from the boys shoulder to brush along Draco's collar bone which was rising and falling rapidly, and touch the seductive skin on his neck. Harry bit his lip, pulling at his own self control, so he didn't ruin everything by simply devouring the blonde in front of him.
Conversation was stilted until the third course, but by dessert, it had an easy flow. Even her grandparents were engaged in a conversation with her parents about their plans for the non-profit. Astrid leaned over to her left and spoke quietly to Scorpius, “Pi,” she whispered, pulling his attention from Harry and Draco’s Quidditch discussion.
"We got you a plate," Astoria added, handing him an essay to review. Sighing, Blaise took the essay and skimmed over it, looking for any obvious mistakes. He liked eating in the Great Hall.
With that, she was out the door and had it closed behind her. Harry took solace in the thought of completely ignoring her parting remark as he walked back into the kitchen to find Draco sitting at his  table with a pile of letters in front of him. Harry recognized them as the owls he’d received that morning, and mentally kicked himself for leaving him alone.
"I can handle it. I can. Just one more kiss." Harry pulled him back in, biting at Draco's lower lip until he moaned.
Harry leaned down and scooped him up with his left hand and motioned him a bit towards Malfoy, “Found him,” he said, offering what he hoped was an awkward smile but felt more like a grimace. Another uncomfortable silence followed so Harry tried to fill it, “What are you doing out here?”
Draco heads down the hallway and turns the corner, "I'm sorry but we're-" the words die in his throat.
Harry ducked his head, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. “No,” he replied petulantly, “of course not. I’ve never been gone for Malfoy.”
"Yes well," Draco replied. His hand gestured towards his body, sweeping from his chest to his thighs, as though that were a reasonable response.
- of course I am! Not like I could do much about it with your parents there. Luckily it's only about half mast.
Something must have shown on his face because Draco smiled and said, “Maybe next time, if you can be good for me,” before he sank to his knees and tugged down Harry’s trousers and boxers together.
"Hi. Can I get you anything else?" Anna asked, eyes on Draco. He gave her a small smile and shook his head no.
Draco was still in his uniform, fresh from his meeting with McGonagall. When he regained composure he smiled broadly at Harry. Harry's mind went blank, all carefully planned conversation stripped away, leaving only thoughts of heat and action in their stead. He reached forward tugging Draco close by the collar and bruising his lips in a desperate kiss.
. Draco marvels at Potter’s willingness to bare his vulnerability like that. Discussing a threesome is one thing, confessing the importance of a relationship openly like that is just dangerous. Or so Draco has always been taught. Potter stands to wrap his arms around Draco.
When Harry came he had to bite down on the meat of his hand to keep himself quiet, while Draco sucked and licked until Harry’s cock was too sensitive for any more pleasure.
"No," Narcissa said, never looking away from Harry. "We are not done here. I addressed you. Please, finish the sentence."
He gave her a warm smile, "Don't apologize, just don't bother lying to me until you're more convincing than a Gryffindor." He turned and pulled her towards the table where his grandparents were sitting.
Potter drops his hands and stands up straight, looking for all the world like the innocent Golden Boy the press is always praising. “I’ll be good.”
Scorpius opened the door to find a large man hurriedly ending the conversation and stuffing his cell phone into his back pocket. He was broad shouldered with large everything, thick legs, thick arms and a stomach that wasn’t quite obese, but was nothing close to flat. The man looked a bit confused before he offered a polite smile and said, “Hi, I’m looking for Harry Potter.”
She grabbed a pen off the table and wrote an address on Harry's hand, "My show is on Saturday at the Double Arrow. Owl me if you're coming and I will give your name to the bouncer. Just think about it, ok?"
"That was your suggestion when you gave them to me, but I’ve never been good at following your directions," Pansy says with a smile. She sits next to Draco on a plush loveseat and takes a sip of the wind he's already poured for her.
“I-” Harry started, and then corrected, “we,” he awkwardly pet the cat that was now tucked into his chest, “live in 392. You- you’re my- our, um neighbor.”
“Did she?” Draco asked, as though it was old information. “You do look like you’re in need of a good fuck.”
Draco pulled back slowly and looked over Harry's face before meeting his eyes. They were close enough for Harry to feel Draco's breath on his lips.
"Yes," Draco replied, his face impassive, "we all seem capable of making changes to the company we keep." His words sounded calm, but Harry could see the bar of tension between his shoulder blades.
Draco wrapped his hands around the mug as though he was absorbing heat from it, "Well go on then Potter, let's hear it. Who was your first kiss?"
He can feel Draco smile against his skin. “Listen to you beg, it’s music to my ears.” The sound of Draco’s posh voice, low and eager, sounds like pure sex.
Their were 16 people in attendance, and not a single one escaped some kind of breakdown during the lunch. Harry gave as much as he could, he shared stories, jokes, tears, hugs, and drinks. He was so used to pushing it all away that it physically hurt to take down those barriers for his friends and open up, but it was worth the effort. They needed to know that they weren't alone in their loss, grief, or even the dull happiness that it was all over.
Harry turned to look at her and noticed the way Pansy's eyes were trained on the dress Ginny was wearing. She seemed to be conflicted between admiring the redheads trim waist or lingering on her bare calves.
Blaise stared at the closed door for nearly ten minutes before going to find Pansy. He needed a plan.
"Harry," Hermione said, "where are you going?" her voice thick with accusation. Harry looked at her wondering how much she'd already figured out. Sometimes Hermione figured out his feelings even before he did. Most times.
On Friday, they followed Professor Loire around during her inspection. She noticed the hidden liquor cabinets in the closets but didn't say anything about them, only gave a look and mumbled something about being of age.
Potter watches it a few times, color rising in his cheeks before he looks up at Draco. His eyes are dark, the green edged out by wide pupils. He walks over to crowd Draco against the counter, bracing his arms on either side of the blonde. Potter’s tongue peeks out to lick his lips just as they spread into a smile and he says, "It's a good picture of you."
Harry eyed him wearily, "And your father-" he started, then trails off, not sure how to ask what he wants to know.
“Ron said, and I quote, ‘You're a frigid bitch. I bet you can't even get a date for Harry’s event without paying for it.’ They were his parting words.” Hermione leans forward to put her elbows on the desk, folding her hands in front of her. “I can’t think of anyone I could bring that would upset him more than you.”
After they both buttoned back up, Harry had one arm tucked behind his head with the other wrapped around Draco, who was laying on Harry's chest. "That was brilliant," he said.
When Draco looked back up, Harry thought he might actually take a punch to the face. Draco was furious.
lecture about pronunciation, and had Astrid say the words aloud 3 times, they took the floo to Diagon Alley. At Olivander's they went through seven wands before Astrid found one that agreed with her. It was vine wood with unicorn hair at the core, which didn't mean much to Scorpius, but he did catch a knowing glance between Harry and Draco.
His last two relationships, Ginny Weasley and then Parvati Patil, had ended a bit awkwardly. Harry had been told by each of them that he wasn't attentive enough. To be fair, Harry had felt rather uninspired by both relationships. He'd done his best to be a good boyfriend, given gifts, asked about their days, but he'd never been able to get around the lack of passion. He assumed that was how most people were though, real relationships weren't like the stories, right? Or Harry was too messed up from the war to
Draco goes stiff, anticipating an argument but it doesn't come. Potter flashes her an easy smile, and says, "Then he must have good taste in cologne," before kissing her cheek.
“Oh come on,” Neville said, still chuckling, “her and I have known you were gone for him since 5th year!”
“No, actually, I’m very busy right now brewing a potion to repel snakes. I seem to be getting an infestation and it’s really important that I take care of it,” Harry replied, meeting her eyes.
Potter rolled his eyes. "Listen, I'll admit the git crosses my mind a lot, but none of my thoughts are," Potter lowered his voice to a whisper, "explicit in nature."
"Maybe you should take the morning off," Seamus replied, "You've been doing those extra training sessions every day since we got here."
Draco turns slowly from the door to face him, but he doesn’t look angry. In fact, Harry sees the beginnings of a smile on his lips. “Potter, do you have anything to say for yourself?”
This time, Draco dropped his eyes to look Harry over, pointedly checking him out, taking in Harry's jeans and t-shirt, unruly dark hair, and broad shoulders. Harry tried not to shift or fidget under the gaze, feeling too exposed.
"Potter, there's no way you can afford me. Not only am I expensive, I would charge you at least three times my going rate."
"Surely Neville knows you want to date him. We all saw you kiss. It was pretty obvious,” Daphne said. She was curled up behind Pansy, using her wand to draw a dragon across Pansy’s shoulder blades. Apparently, they had gotten the idea from a muggleborn Ravenclaw who was giving out 'temp tattoos' the day before.
Draco’s eyes are bright and clear, that lovely storm grey. “Harry,” he voice gentle, quiet. Then, Draco starts to
"So," he ran a hand across the back of his neck, "I get the feeling there was more to this than a break from the normal class activity."
Pansy paused, looking Harry over as though he was a subpar piece of furniture she was going to have to donate since no one would pay to take it off her hands. Harry narrowed his eyes the way he'd seen Pansy do to Draco, vying for some dominance.
"What preferences?" Harry asked casually. He could think of more than one preference that she might be talking about, but he was fairly certain which one would upset Umbridge.
Potter stumbled but caught back his grace easily. Damn Auror training. He moved forward until Draco’s back was pressed against the wall.
Harry groaned at the feeling, his own cock stiffening further from the contact. "I've known you for almost a decade," he said, looking at Draco's lips. "You're sending me severely mixed signals here," he said.
Scorpius felt his neck crack with the speed he jerked it to look up at his father, "Can we do that?"
“Look, ‘Mione, I don’t know what Blaise was even talking about,” he laid a hand over hers, “but I know that anyone, boy, girl, or otherwise, would be lucky just for a chance with you.”
Astrid looked expectantly at Scorpius and he gave her a small smile. “Of course, Father,” he said. “Let’s see, most of what you’re looking for will be at Diagon Alley. You can buy your books there, and you are allowed to read as much as you like before school starts. You will be fitted for robes as well. You are welcome to order from Etsy, I know that some of the other students have, but during class you have to wear the uniform. Honestly, we wear mostly muggle fashion when we are off grounds and on the weekends,” he motioned to his own clothes, a pair of well fitted jeans and a dark gray button down shirt. “You can wear custom robes from Etsy at some of the dances we have if you want. Your wand can come from a couple of different shops but I recommend Olivander’s. His shop is here in London and he makes the finest wands in the Wizarding World.” He paused to give her a sad smile, “You won't be able to use it until school starts, there are laws against underage magic.”
By the 2nd weekend in July Scorpius realized the summer was moving too quickly. He was brewing Pepper Up potions for his father’s business during the week, weekly Quidditch games with Teddy and the Weasleys, keeping up with the reading list Hermione had set forth at the beginning of Summer, and spending his weekends with Teddy and Astrid. Though, to be fair, Astrid was more than willing to help keep him focused on the reading list. The moment Scorpius was done with a book he would pass it off to Astrid, which at least gave her a break from the Hogwarts textbooks she was burning through. Astrid liked to sit with him during potion-making on Fridays too, filling him in on her muggle life and asking a steady stream of questions about his brewing.
They reached the entryway and were greeted by an elf who was wearing the smallest tuxedo Astrid had ever seen outside of build-a-bear. His wide eyes swept over them before landing on Draco. “Master Malfoy,” he said, with a deep bow. "I will show your guests to the table, your mother would like a word with you before you're seated."
Loire looked up at her, a line formed between her red eyebrows. She walked over to them, "Yes of course," she replied absently. When she circled the desk to stand by McGonagall her eyes were on Draco. "What's happened?"
Potter gave him an embarrassed smile, "I don't anymore, I just didn't have other options and I needed something to help me get out of my own head."
Draco started to chuckle, quietly at first, then eventually threw his head back and actually laughed. “Potter,” he said with a genuine smile, “Since the war ended I was put in charge of the Malfoy estate, including the family vaults. Even after reparations I still have enough to rebuild the manor several times over.”
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, which made Harry smile. He'd seen her give that same look to Draco and thought it might be reserved for friends.
Draco, moved so both hands were on Harry’s waist as he thrust into him over and over and over, and Harry came undone, beneath him. He saw Harry wrap a hand around his dick, pumping hard and fast until come pulsed out of him, spilling over against the door. His ass clenched and Draco's rhythm stuttered before as his body released, filling Harry up.
"Potter, if I wasn't already hunting other prey, I would definitely entertain the idea of seducing you."
Hermione smiled at him now, a full, unapologetic smile and said, “Harry, I love you. You defeated Voldemort, you’ll be fine. Now, I’m leaving and I will see you in a couple of weeks.”
Draco's amusement has to be wrangled down and locked away before he can casually lift a brow at Potter and ask, "Disrespectful?"
“I was informed there was an incident at Hogwarts today with Delores Umbridge, shortly after you set up this meeting."
"My Dad," her words were barely a whisper, "he told me about these things that take away happiness. I'm-" she paused again not meeting his eye, "I'm not supposed to be alone."
"I wasn't expecting you." Harry walked forward. "I mean, I wasn't expecting anyone else to be here."
Harry looked over the girl behind the counter, Anna. She had an emo cut to her bangs and wore thick purple eyeliner. Harry had met her a month ago when he first came to the ice cream shop. He passed over payment, and said, "Do you think this ice cream will be enough to seduce him?"
He went to the kitchen and rifled through his pantry until he found an unopened box of chocolates he'd purchased at Flourish and Blotts, each chocolate was shaped like a tiny book with words scrolled across the cover and, as you ate them, the words were charmed to appear on parchment, allowing you to read a short story produced by the chocolates. With those in hand, he stepped into his floo, calling out, “Ministry of Magic.”
Around the next corner, where the tunnel wound up another level, were crude stairs that looked to be made of discarded wood paneling. Harry gaped at them, stopping without warning. These were the panels he'd banished after rebuilding the fence in the gardens. Behind him, Draco slowed, pressing in close to Harry without fully touching him.
Harry purposefully cleared his throat. When Pansy looked back at him, Harry cocked a knowing eyebrow. Surely she wouldn't pass up the opportunity with Ginny, which meant she would have to let him through.
Draco paused his buttoning to glance up at Blaise as though he was a prize idiot. “You realize, you’re also dating a gryffindor, right?”
He glanced sideways at her as they walked, his face must have shown something because she offered a small smile.
He shrugged, thinking back, and said, "Well, based on my experience she likes awkward fumbling hands, confusion, and good kissing," he looked up, "kissing is the only thing I'm good at with females. I mean I'm good at kissing guys too. Just, I'm also good-"
Harry dropped the clothes, grabbed his wand, and left the room. He stormed through the common room without speaking. His face must have said plenty though, because Neville quickly caught up with him, wand drawn.
Harry scowled at her, wondering how it was that she could always tell what he was thinking. Maybe she was smarter than him.
Pansy tilted her head like a curious cat, "You aren't going to be a dick are you?" she asked with slow, careful words.
"Ugh," Harry said, after Hermione smacked Ron and the shoulder, a faint blush on her cheeks. "You two have fun. I'm going to lock myself in my room and avoid the student body." With that he headed to his dorm.
“Not a chance. Don’t change the subject. You like Longbottom. And don’t bother saying it’s just his fit as hell ass.”
"I've always been pretty Potter, you're just oblivious." Draco wants the words to come out mocking but his breath catches at the end when Potter's hand makes direct contact with the skin on his abdomen.
Harry can see a copy of Malfoy's numerous tattoos peeking out from the cuffs of the teal button-down shirt he's wearing.
At this moment the sky was clear, just past twilight, a full moon shining above them. However, said path was thick with mud and snow mixed together on the ground. James' sneakers were doing nothing to keep in the heat and the cuffs of his jeans were soaked halfway up his shin.
He smiled then, taking back his drink, "I didn't really know how to tell you. Hermione just brought her home one night."
There was another distinct thump and then a moan. The four of them stared at the wall with rapt attention as moans of pleasure started to filter through. A slow smile spread across Luna’s face, and Neville blushed furiously.
Harry wrapped his arms around him. "Would it help to know that at this moment I will agree to just a shag?"
The last thing she sees before he disapparates is a familiar smirk on his surprisingly kissable lips.
His fingers brushed the fabric of the jumper but he couldn't grab it without tipping onto the balls of his feet. His leg muscles tensing as he lifted higher.
Draco leans over him, using the hold he has under Harry’s knees to fold him back, pushing his cock deeper. Braced himself, he leans in, brushing their lips together in an almost chaste kiss before saying, "Want me to fuck you?"
Harry backs up, reminding himself that he’s got nothing to worry about. He can take Malfoy if it comes to that. He just needs to remember how to breathe and everything will be fine.
"I see," Harry replied slowly, he wasn't concerned with the threat, only worried about the subject, "and we are talking about Parkinson?" he asked hopefully.
Harry jerked his hand back as though it were burned. He stared at Draco, gobsmacked, until the blonde reached up and closed Harry's jaw.
Draco let him squirm for a moment and then said, “Do you mind if I have that tea that Granger offered me?”
Scorpius shrugged and gave an apologetic smile, "She was up at 7 sending me messages about books." He motioned to the 3 piles still on the floor, "I'm guessing you went through something similar in the forest with Hermione?"
Draco stared at Potter's stupid hopeful face, all earnest and expectant. He really was unbearable. And good looking. Unbearably good looking. Realizing that it would take a stronger man than Draco to say no to those piercing green eyes, Draco replied, "Fine."
Draco pins Potter with a glare, "Did you not listen to that conversation? What the fuck could I have done?"
"Pardon," she said, "Harry. I know that you have mixed feelings about my husband," she let the sentence hang.
Harry was thrown by the directness of the question. He felt heat rise up the back of his neck and rubbed it with his free hand to try and stop the spread. “I mean, I haven’t thought about it.”
Neville had brought in Blaise Zabini for interior design in late 1999, when Harry was only in his third project. Working with Harry had bolstered the Slytherins reputation substantially and, after a year, Blaise set up an office in central London for interior design. He always put Harry's projects at the top of his list though, and now that they had 4 joint projects under their belt, Harry trusted Blaise's opinion without question.
During Draco's trial, they asked Harry, Ron, and Hermione to stand together but Harry did all of the retellings of their time at the Manor. Hermione answered questions about her part in distorting Harry's face and declined discussion regarding her torture, stating that Bellatrix was already dead.
Narcissa straightened up, brushing ash off of her pale blue robes. She looked better than Harry had ever seen her, her hair was plated down her back and she wore an emerald tear drop around her neck.
Draco smirked, "So you're not allowed to dress like a homeless man, or pay me for sex," he said as they reached their hallway and stopped in front of Harry's door. "What else?"
"Yes," Draco replied, "or a black curtain." He leaned past George to see if he could spot anything hidden. "A back room of some sort?"
Scorpius looked down, recognizing Harry’s terrible handwriting, and saw that it was his address. At the bottom, Harry had signed his name. “Well look at that,” he said, letting a slight sneer show on his lips, “you already have his autograph.” He looked up, letting his grey eyes harden, “Enjoy your evening,” he said, unpleasantly, and started to close the door.
Pansy smiled with delight, "Yes!" She sat down on the couch across from the boys and looked at Draco. "OK, shut up," she said to the silent pair. "In the library today, Granger did this thing. It was quite brilliant really, especially for a Gryffindor. Which, by the way, I think she may have been sorted wrong. Though, I guess she was doing it for what she considered a noble cause. Maybe Gryffindor is where she belongs."
The panic that had crashed through Harry upon seeing the wolf abated some. Teddy had said no one was hurt and he was worried about getting into trouble. Whatever had happened couldn't have been that bad.
Draco planted one more kiss and then stood, saying, "Come on. Let's get you a cup of tea to enjoy while I go take my shower."
Harry wasn't really sure how to answer that. He thought of Draco and the deal they had struck, "I think so," he said slowly.
Draco sat back down and gave her a short nod, he had more dire arguments to engage with her this morning than her name. Macmillan sat down next to him. Draco didn’t really want him here but there was no tactful way to get rid of him since he was in his last week of training. During the last week of training, all Unspeakables shadowed Hermione.
Harry looks down at the shiny coin in his hand, closing his fist around it. “I said I was thinking of Malfoy, that I wanted him to bruise my throat with his cock.”
The Professor flashed him a bright smile, bright blue eyes glittering, "All the students are paired up so you will be judging with me instead of dueling today."
Draco forced his face to remain neutral, something he’d gotten good at long before his employment at the ministry. “Of course. I am simply hoping for some clarification on
Blaise let his smile drop. He was missing something here, and he didn't know enough about Gryffindors to figure out what it was. "Something I should know?"
Neville gave him a private smile, "Not for that. I just want to see you. We can find a hiding place after though, if you want to mess around."
Neville pressed his lips together, looking suspiciously as though he was trying to hold back a smile, and glanced at Blaise.
He heard laughter through the wall and then the sub said, “No I was NOT referring to edging. Don’t even get that idea in your head. You’d probably leave me unsatisfied for hours if I had the money to pay.”
"I used to visit with her and bring her things I thought would help. Books, paint with canvas, apples. Things like that," Draco said. He took a deep breath, "At some point she asked me to call her by her given name so I did. Honestly, I haven't denied any of her requests since that day. Even though some of them are a bit…." He trailed off which made Harry laugh.
Harry gave her a nod, sitting as well. "It's nice to see you again. I'm sorry it has to be done under these circumstances."
"Good evening gentlemen," McGonagall's voice pulled Harry's attention back to the moment. She sounded exhausted.
Neville was already at the door, staring down the hallway. He turned back to Harry and asked, "What were you thinking about when Blaise said he wanted to blindfold you?"
Harry talked to Hermione and Ron about the offer all through dinner. He found himself getting hesitantly excited about the idea. That night Harry laid in bed with his head on Draco's chest while Draco and Pansy read the letters out loud to each other. When Harry fell asleep it was to the pleasant sound of Draco's voice in his ear.
The boys sat on the end two small beds in the infirmary listening to Madam Pompfrey's clinical explanation. Blaise tried to focus on her words but his mind was crowded with Potter's inner monologue and his own panicked thoughts.
Blaise was already wearing half his costume, dark red boots, tight blue pants, and a utility belt. He didn't fully understand this costume because he’d never read a comic but Pansy had promised him it would be worth it. Blaise had only made one request for the party. "There has to be dancing."
She was cut off by the sound of her name coming from behind Harry. He felt hope when he recognized the voice.
“For my birthday,” Harry continues, letting the words tumble out. “Charlie Weasley set it up and told me how to activate it.”
Harry pushed his body into Draco until he was pressed against the desk, reveling in the way his boyfriend becomes so pliant and giving under his touch. He doesn’t resist when Harry tugged his pants down and pulled out the blond’s cock. Casting a wandless lubrication spell just before his palm made contact, Harry began to stroke, whispering, “You’re supposed to call me Harry.”
Draco turned his face so Harry planted another love bite on his neck instead, his breath catching when Draco pulled out his cock.
Blaise chewed his lip, thinking of the way Draco was around Potter and comparing it to the way he acted around that Durnstrang boy he'd liked. "If Theo bet against it then how can you be sure? You know he has an uncanny ability to predict what Draco will do," he said.
Malfoy's hand twitched so violently that his water cup tipped and spilled over the edge of the table, and into his lap. "Fuck."
"If you wanted to say something in French to seduce someone," Blaise started. Neville's eyebrows raised so high they nearly met his hairline. Blaise gave him a quick wink before continuing, "what's the hottest thing you could say?"
With a flirtatious smile and kind words, Draco had already confirmed with the secretary that Potter's caseload was currently light. Before walking in Draco paused to collect himself, smoothing out the creases of his black Unspeakable robes. He mentally recited the request he would use to ask Potter to join him.
Harry sighed, and berated himself for ever getting drunk around Hermione. She always remembered every drunken monologue he gave. "The Draco constellation is in the North, it never sets, and is made up of not just stars but also planets. The myth behind it is about a dragon named Ladon who guarded golden apples."
Hermione gave her a disapproving look. Harry was familiar with that look, he'd received it plenty of times. "Pansy," Hermione said, "is here to help Ron and me pick an outfit from her collection for the gala in July. You know the one? It's held every year on your birthday."
“Say?” Teddy repeated, glancing down at James’ hand on his chest before his eyes came to rest on the boy’s lips.
“I want to know the effects on your psyche. The first step is to research the material and bring me a report on which tags apply to you. We need to know the kind of story you’re actually living before we can make any comparisons.”
Zabini looked at the floor and then sighed, "Sorry Pans, but Draco's still down there." He glanced back to Harry, "In front of the Charms classroom."
"Yeah, that's obvious to everyone Harry." They reached the end of the staircase and Neville linked an arm around Harry's.
"Budge up," Blaise said, "I need to focus on my Charms test and Potter here can't stop thinking about your thigh being pressed against his."
Dark eyeliner girl walked over to him. “Hi,” she said, pulling Draco from his thoughts.  "You did a great job tonight.”
Draco laughed. It was a clear true sound that rang through Harry with no concern for the safety of his sanity. He looked over to see Draco's left hand rested on his stomach, moving slightly from the force of the laugh. Harry liked it. He thought he would like to hear it again, then quickly smashed that thought as though it were a toxic bug sent to poison him.
"Is that why?" Potter asks, rudely interrupting because, it turns out, he's still a self-righteous prick. "Is she right? You want to use her to get your reputation back?"
" she said, drawing out the name, "are both involved in Teddy's life. Draco the cousin, Harry the godfather. When that happens, Teddy usually tells Harry about the good things Draco has been up to. This gives Draco an upper hand. Then the rest is handled by," she motioned to him, "how attractive he is and the unresolved sexual tension they've both experienced since school."
She blushed, not sure if it was his proximity or having to admit her quest. Lifting her chin, she said, "I will tell you after."
Harry cast a considering look at Draco as they walked, noticing the way his jaw tensed when the Weasley shop came into view. "So, is it just Luna then?" Harry asked.
Everything about it was perfect, except for one minor detail. The table was too close to the staircase, so when everyone sat down Petunia and Vernon were slightly under the stairs, causing them to hunch forward uncomfortably. Astrid watched, curious, as Harry and Dudley both looked at the staircase and then each other. Eventually, Harry gave a small smile and sat down at the chair marked with his name, sitting up straight and taking a drink of his wine.
Harry wanted to feed her some reply about only doing as much as she was planning to, but he was worried his voice would carry and Ginny would hear it. Instead he gave a sly smile and they both headed in opposite directions. Harry finally opened the door to see Draco reaching up to put papers into his bag, alone.
Draco looked down at his arm feeling faint. It must have shown on his face because Emily squeezed his bicep and said, "You look a bit ill, Jason. Why don't you head out. Your two hours is up anyway."
Harry closed his eyes, feeling the last vestige of his restraint shatter as Draco leaned in to whisper, “Je veux te baiser.”
Draco briefly considered the idea that his next move could land him in the infirmary, but with the way Potter was looking at him, eyes lust filled, he decided it would be worth the risk. He leaned forward, letting his breath ghost over his ear and said, "That depends, how much are you going to let me do?" Feeling Potter shiver, Draco let his hand fall to grip at the other boys waist, flexing his fingers against the robes. "How much do you want me to do?"
Harry managed a self-deprecating smile. “Again, I wish it were that easy,” he said, not fully evading or answering the question.
She beamed at him, "Studies show that many great minds only slept 5 hours a night. Currently I still need 6 and half to stay chipper." Her voice always seem to reach a new level of sweetness when she was talking to Harry. Scorpius watched the two of them carefully and thought that, possibly, this girl was the first true hybrid he'd ever met. The hat sorting for her might take a bloody hour.
of stories about me and- about this-” he waved his hand at her desk, unsure which word would capture the situation.
The moment Zach spotted Draco his eyes went narrow. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" he asked.
Loire was standing in the middle of the mat, she pulled her wand out and began to pace. "Just so we are clear, there will be no interference from anyone unless I lose consciousness. Also, I'm not going to monologue for 20 minutes to give you time to prepare." She looked at Harry, "On your feet, Potter."
Harry stood and dusted off his denims. He did not look at Draco. Feeling his hands go clammy, he toyed with the idea of summoning his invisibility cloak and making good on the move to Canada he'd been considering.
"My parents went to school with them. My Dad told me a few stories of playing quidditch against yours," Ernie said, and Harry gave him a soft smile.
On the way up the stairs Astrid let her eyes drift along the banister, which was covered in engraved carvings of lilies. As she moved up the flowers bloomed to match her step. When she reached the last step she looked up to see Scorpius watching her with curious grey eyes. He looked good, even if he was wearing joggers and a t-shirt. She bit her cheek, hoping it would stop her from blushing, then said, "Are all wizard houses this fancy? Or is it just this one?"
Potter stepped forward, to tug the letter from his hand and read it over.  He smiled down at it and said, "Hoi Polloi has the best burgers in London."
A knock on the door pulls them both sharply from the moment. Potter holds a finger to his lips, signaling for Draco to be quiet and they both listen.
"I'm sure my friends would have plenty to say about that." Harry bit his lip, afraid that his response would mess up the tentative peace they'd seemed to reach. "They might have heard your name a few times here and there while we were at Hogwarts."
“Have you ever heard of this spell the girls want to use on me?” Potter asked, his leg bouncing up and down from the effort of waiting patiently.
Draco leaned over the desk and slid his report to the side, revealing the artwork he’d been given the night before. Her eyes flicked up to him, then back down to the picture. To her credit, Hermione didn’t flinch the way Draco had. Which meant that she wasn’t surprised.
Headmistress McGonagall also spoke for Draco. She didn't provide any specific stories, she discussed his age and upbringing, more than anything else. She also offered to hold monthly accountability meetings with him, should he return to her school.
“Yes,” she said, her eyes dancing now. Draco’s stomach swooped at the sight, feeling like he might actually live to regret ever bringing this to her.
"It's none of your business!" Ginny shouted, firing off another spell and drawing Harry's attention back to the fight.
Harry pushed on his glasses and sent him a dirty look, "He's one of my best friends, you can't keep calling him that," he said testily.
The door to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes opened and Potter stepped out, curious eyes absorbing the scene. Draco yanked back his hand, worried it would look like he’d been trying to feel up his coworker.
Harry collapses on the couch, freshly fucked, naked, and fully sated. Draco eyes him cooly. For a brief moment, Harry thinks he's going to leave, to run. Instead, Draco casts a
When neither of them responded Pompfrey sighed, "I'm sorry gentleman. Just know it won't last forever. You can stay in here until class is over."
At the door, Professor Liore stopped him when he entered, and asked, "Mr. Potter, is there a reason you can't seem to get to my class on time?" Even when she was being irritating, her voice seemed to float like a melody.
Dudley seemed to relax for the first time since he’d appeared at the door. He turned to his daughter and said, “Go ahead, Jellybean.”
Natalie hummed through the headset, she could always see through Astrid’s facade. “You have to send me some pictures,” she said.
"Allegedly." The voice came from behind Astrid and she turned to see Scorpius in the archway of the kitchen. He was in silk pajama bottoms with a cotton t-shirt on and his hair was messy from sleep, but not a bird's nest. It looked on purpose messy. Astrid watched him stroll over to the table and snag Harry's tea.
George pulled Harry over and started talking about his brother Charlie leaving for Romania and brunch at the Burrow tomorrow. Harry shoved thoughts of the two girls away, and listened to him, happy for a distraction.
Harry sat between Neville and Hermione. Hermione spent most of dinner discussing their plans for a Hogsmeade trip the following weekend, and Harry promised to join her at the bookstore if she came with him to check out the new Nimbus.
Harry tried desperately to think straight, his magic was pulsing through his body, and his cock thickening in the tight denims. Lust doesn't help anyone think clearly. Instead of speaking right away he let his hands wander over Draco's waist and back, soaking in the feeling of finally touching him.
Anna's smile faltered at the odd statement. The woman before her wasn't looking at the ice cream case. She was dark-skinned with a mass of wild curls gathered into a ponytail. Anna's eyes dropped down to the woman's arm to look for a scar, but it was covered by her Blazer.
Seamus sat up to open a drawer in his bedside table and pull out a book. "Here, you should read that before you do anything," he said, handing it over as Harry sat up.
“The students are mostly ignoring me now. I haven’t had a hex thrown at me at least three days.” Draco gave him a soft smile, “It’s helping having you in my dorm too.”
Out of the corner of her eye, Hermione sees a flash of red hair and that’s enough to push her over the edge. If these two are going to play games than Hermione is going to capitalize it.
Potter stepped into his field of vision, searching Draco's eyes. All thoughts of Macmillan disappeared.
* this is a reference to Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which I HIGHLY recommend because it's one of my favorite stories.
Ron turned desperate eyes on Hermione, "This is our fault. We've been ignoring him. We were gone all summer and that snake-"
“Potter.” Even with Draco’s height, he didn’t have any advantage here. Potter’s hands braced against the wall, caging Draco in.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "I should have made Pansy my best man." He turned on his heel and walked down the hall with Draco following happily after him.
Seamus and Dean updated Harry on their latest progress with Xenophilius Lovegood’s house. Luna’s father had been reluctant to renovation in the beginning but Luna had convinced him to do it because the house needed what she called “a fresh face for their new adventures.” They had begun work last month. Luna had somewhat fallen into the role of marketing for Harry, and, though her musings always threw people off, she tended to get sales easier than anyone else.
At the time, Hermione had taken offense, arguing that she was not ‘a fragile woodland creature,’ and ‘woman can wear more than pink,’ and ‘can’t a female dress for reasons other than looking pretty’.
When Neville’s lips kissed the skin above his hip bone, it was all Blaise could do not to cry out in desperation for how close Neville’s mouth was to his cock. When Neville put his lips to the head of Blaise’s cock and licked the precum, Blaise's knees nearly gave way. Neville must have sensed it because his hands came up to grip Blaise’s thighs, holding him steady.
Harry stared at her as she walked away to view the duel between Hermione and Ernie, until Blaise came up beside him.
Draco gave a quick nod in greeting to Macmillan, hoping that neither of them had realized he’d been asleep. It wasn't his fault really, he'd been up all night reading fanfiction.
"You will not be going anywhere," McGonagall said. "You still have several months of school to finish before I consider letting you leave this castle for good."
Harry puts his hand over hers and squeezes gently. "She's my best friend Parkinson. I'm far more interested in making her happy than making her cry." He briefly glances at me, "Besides, I have a Slytherin working with me. We make a great team."
Harry shrugged, "It belonged to someone important to me." He looked down at his nearly empty glass, shrugged, and said, "He hated it here, but I feel closer to him, ya know?"
She pulled back and looked him over carefully, "Oh my. You have too many wrackspurts. Have you not been putting any honey in your morning fry up?"
Draco apparates to a block away from Hermione’s flat. He greets the reporters waiting to snap a picture of him going into her house, giving them a friendly smile when they ask if he’s happy about his girlfriend. When Hermione opens the door to let him in, her eyes drop slow and hungry over his body, lingering over the tight t-shirt and well fitting denims. Draco smirks and asks, “May I come in?”
Potter looks around and opts to close himself inside the supply closet for safe-keeping just as Draco hears the sound of the door clicking open.
"I'm sorry," Granger says, "I know you had the door locked but the sign said open so I thought it might have been an accident." She's lying. Draco's almost sure of it, but she sells it better than most Gryffindors.
For the next week Harry stays busy with work. At night, alone in his bed, he thinks about Charlie's gift. He decides against using the coin at home. Number 12 is still unplottable and he thinks it might ruin the fantasy to deal with that.
After the very odd experience of having a translucent wolf tell them to touch a gargoyle and repeat a phrase, Harry and Draco were walking together through a hidden tunnel. Harry was in the lead wand lit with a Lumos and pointed in front of him. The tunnel was all dirt, and tall enough that he could stand upright. It cut through into the basement and wound up through the wall.
Licking his lips, Neville slid his thigh up again, and Blaise felt his entire body shudder from the contact. "Neville, please," Blaise said, "either let me leave or help me. I can't handle teasing right now."
There was a strained silence until all of them broke into laughter except for Ernie who offered a small smile. Hannah gave him a side hug saying, "This will be a true test of your house abilities my friend."
“Merlin, I’ve wanted you for so long,” he heard Neville breathe, the words choking on a gasp before Neville’s fingers deftly undid Blaise’s trousers. He leaned forward, letting a kiss swallow the sound of Blaise’s moan when Neville’s right hand slid down and brushed against Blaise’s straining erection, through his boxers.
"You're being condescending," Potter replied, running a hand through his mess of dark hair, "though I'm not surprised you don't know the difference."
Harry was pleased to see pride radiating off of Draco as he said that. He's still surprised Lucius isn't in Azkaban, but at least the man couldn't hurt anyone anymore. And if Draco wanted to have fun rebuilding the Manor with half bloods to make the man uncomfortable, Harry could get behind that. He smiled at Draco.
He told himself that he didn't have an agenda, that he was just passively watching people walk by. He knew it was a lie though. He hadn't stopped thinking about Draco since the club. Or, you know, since sixth year. As soon as he spotted Draco, Harry stood up, pulled his hoodie on, and flipped up the hood.
Draco bit gently on Harry's earlobe. "Since the room is occupied, let's go out to the forest. I'd like to fuck you against a tree."
Before Blaise could do more than roll his eyes, McGonagall walked into the room with Slughorn trailing behind her.
“Oh,” Neville’s voice was a whisper. Harry looked up at him as Neville said, “I’m so sorry Harry. What are you going to do?”
When Harry comes in from the shower he's dressed in fresh joggers and a t-shirt that stretches across his shoulders. "All right 'Mione, tell me about this date."
Blaise lifted himself into a sitting position to properly narrow his eyes at her. “I admit I want to shag him, but dating is out of the question. It would be easier to date you than Neville.”
Potter sat across from him, leaned back with his ankle set on top of his knee. He'd insisted on sitting with his back to the wall so he could survey the shop once Nora re-opened. The girl who'd been screaming had left once Nora went out and told her she wasn't allowed to loiter.
“Yes,” Draco ground out, rubbing his arm, “that sounds fine.” He looked back at Potter who was pulling on his school robes. “What about you?”
Two years ago, half the Auror team and a pack of Weasleys had gone across the pond for Harry’s 21st birthday. Harry had been drinking since 1998 but visiting the states for their 'of age' birthday meant free drinks all night. The next day was spent downing potions, sleeping off the hangover, and generally feeling like shit.
Harry shot his own glance at Hermione, who was now petting a content Orion in her lap while she talked with Bill, then looked back to Ron, "Did she tell you?"
“Granger,” he said with a stiff nod. Then, looking at her sleeve covered left arm, “I’m sorry for what you went through at the Manor.” Then he met her eye, “I also apologize for the many horrible things that I’ve said to you over the years. ”
She finished sealing the parchment and set it in her school bag. “But,” she said, looking up at him, “I don’t know. We’re just all so young and I, well, to be honest, I think I might be attracted to women.”
“That’s a good question actually,” Ernie said, “I mean, what counts as sex? Is a blowjob in an alcove sex in public?”
Harry's eyes dropped to the boy's arm where his sleeve was rolled up to his elbow. The flex of his forearm tense from the way Zabini was gripping his book.
Pansy had taken the bet eagerly stating "They don't have it in them to do something so against the heteronormative. Weaslete dated
Draco huffs a laugh, which turns into a chuckle, which breaks into full laughter that he's shaking with. "This is just perfect."
“Please?” Astrid said with big, hopeful, dual colored eyes, and then pushed her bottom lip into a pout.
Tuesday he spent in interviews with the Wizengamot and testified against over half of the people he was scheduled to, he provided pensieve memory for everyone he was asked to provide for and went home, exhausted. Wednesday morning he met Ron and Hermione at the private floo in Robard’s office and they sat through three meetings before breaking to eat.
Lucius moved closer to her, seeming to recognize her ability to pull at least some civility out of Harry. Eventually her eyes landed on the plans spread out on the table where he had been working. Harry moved back over to the couch and his cup of tea and waited as Narcissa came closer and scanned the plans.
Pansy gave him a measured look and said, "Just like you've been using me, in the same way, all month to keep yourself hidden from the other students."
Harry looked up, hoping what he said would help, and found she was smiling. It was not a nice smile, then a peel of laughter filled the room. Harry had to lay there completely baffled, and wait until she had collected herself.
Harry frowned, looking at the folder. “Ok,” he said cautiously. “So you’ve known that you might need information against Umbridge since before today. Or, more likely,” he returned his gaze to Lucius, “you have this kind of thing on a lot of people who work at the ministry?”
Eyeing the girl, Draco nodded once and let Dudley reach for his phone. He watched as the man's chubby fingers flew across the screen. A crash came from above them, followed by the unmistakable sound of Harry thrashing towards the stairs and then down them.
The two of them leaned on each other catching their breath until Draco pulled back and waved his hand to cast a cleaning charm. Each of them tucked away in silence and then stood looking at each other.
"You should, ya know, um, you should freshen up a bit," Neville's halted words only furthered Harry's confusion. Harry stared at him until Neville said, "Just have a go in the loo before you talk to anyone else."
Draco let the tip of his wand travel slowly down his chest, snagging purposefully on the buttons as it went. “You’re a very powerful wizard,” he said softly, “and we both know that you could get out of these ropes if you wanted.” He rolled his hips against Harry’s erection, eliciting a whine from the man under him.
Harry watched as she walked past them, shocked by her friendliness. He looked back to Draco, "How!?" he demanded, the memories of her tortured cries were flooding his mind.
The wards chime and Draco registers the sound of someone trying to open the front door only a moment later. Potter pulls off with wide green eyes. "I locked it," Potter whispers.
Draco wants to say something, to tell Potter that he's never felt this happy, that he wants to touch and tease every part of Potter's body from now until forever. But the words don't come, it's too much too soon and Draco doesn't like to feel vulnerable. Instead he leans against the hard planes of Potter's chest and tries to distract him by groping his ass.
Ron smiled at Harry, his face flushed from the run, "Well mate, no wonder you didn't want to go to dinner."
Looking down at the plans, Draco said, "I left notes on the changes I want, and if you touch them with your wand you will see a holographic example of the changes."
“Did you even find a shirt?” Astoria asked through the door. She sounded close enough to have her ear pressed to the wood.
Realization dawned in Blaise’s eyes, he stared at Harry for a moment, then turned the look on Draco, “I never thought I’d say this, but I think his jealousy rivals yours.”
Potter tossed back his head and laughed, a wild thing that caught Draco off guard. "There's no way I'm having that conversation with you, Malfoy."
Once she had stormed out, Harry pulled Draco close, checking his trembling body for cuts, "It's ok. The glass didn't cut deep. She can't get you into too much trouble," he tried to sound reassuring, but his voice was unsteady even to his own ears.
Petunia glanced very briefly at Harry, then looked up at the staircase that was causing her to lean over her plate. She cleared her throat, and said, “This is fine Dudley.”
"Sit down Potter. I can't stand you acting like a caged animal," Loire said calmly, eyeing Harry's stumble.
Also.... sorry the pictures are HUGE! I couldn't figure out how to make them smaller. *Update* I figured it out <3
Pansy rolled her eyes, "No, Potter. You're going to be late! You think I don't know about your date? If you're late, I have to hear about it, and I'm not interested." She reached out to tug on his hoodie, pulling him through the doorway. "So move your Chosen ass."
"Guys?" Both boys looked up to see Neville standing over them, "Why is it that every time I see you talking it looks like Harry is about to hyperventilate?"
The smirk she gave when he pulled back to see her face was nothing short of Slytherin, "I know," she whispered and then continued around the corner.
Draco took a long slow breath. He wasn't ready to be this close to Potter in a room full of sex toys. Sex toys that he had possibly purchased! Draco stuffed the list back into his file, careful not to let Potter see the contents, and said, "That's probably enough."
Draco had played wingman for Pansy enough times to recognize that Macmillan was trying to make Potter jealous. He just didn’t understand-
The office door opened. Professor Loire stepped inside, she was looking down at her hands which held a piece of glass. "Minerva, have you seen," she looked up before her sentence finished. "Oh Mr. Potter, I was worried. Why is there glass all over my classroom?"
Harry blinked, realizing that Malfoy's familiar drawl was the voice he’d been getting turned on by for the last week.
Harry looked at the two of them, they were both attractive men. He searched his feelings, imagined kissing them but he felt nothing. He felt for his magic, to see if it was building into a wild frenzy. Still nothing.
Harry shrugged, "I figured you wouldn't mind. I know he's a Slytherin, but he can't be worse than Malfoy."
"Pansy," Pansy says, looking between them. Draco laughs and bumps her shoulder affectionately. She watches them closely, trying to decipher if Draco has told Pansy that this is all a sham or if she needs to keep up appearances. Pansy has not mentioned it to her either way.
Harry tilted his head, holding her gaze , "No," he said cautiously, "it was about getting caught snogging at the robe shop by one of the attendees."
I'm sorry this took me FOREVER to write. I hope all of you are pleased with the ending. I loved this story and it was so fun to put together.
Zabini whisper-shouted. "About how he smells, and his skin, and his pretty eyes, and his perfect hair, how he showers too much, and has a nice smile, and should I keep going? Because I can. You certainly do. You go on about him all day."
The door opens but Potter isn't in his robes. Draco's eyes drop over the t-shirt, spread tight across his muscled shoulders, and dark jeans. He almost looks like he's going out to pull. Draco shakes his head to clear it of thoughts he should
Draco set down the dark green shirt and held the other one up to himself again, nodding in agreement. "Not that you know much about pale skin," he said, eyeing the Harry's collarbone. Any reply Harry was going to make died when the sandy haired sales clerk approached them.
Hermione plasters on the smile she’s been flaunting for the last two weeks, since the break up. “Of course I'm ok."
Potter shrugged. “He asked me to stay out of it. I’m just trying to keep my mind busy so I don’t interrupt.”
Harry huffed a humorless laugh. “Some girl who won’t try to rig my food with love potion? Who won’t peep at me in the shower? Who won’t sniff my clothes or try to touch me…” He gagged on the last words ‘while I sleep’.
She watched him for a moment before turning to Harry, "And you are willing to protect him against Umbridge?"
A knock on his front door interrupted any hope of hearing more and Harry rushed to answer it. When he opened the door it was to a bewildered woman who was distracted by her mobile.
He hoped that Draco, who was so attractive that he was likely dealing with a consistent lineup of inappropriate blushing, didn't notice his reaction.
Boot finished pretending to be busy and looked up at Draco. “I assume you’re here in response to the email I sent?”
Draco nodded, remembering all of the nights he used a bottle of Ogden's for the same purpose. "What can you tell me about them?"
"Fuck, Draco," Harry panted the breathless words into the boys neck. Draco slipped a hand between them. He undid the button of Harry's trousers, then his own, and moved the boxers so that both of their cocks were against each other, skin on skin. Draco's long elegant fingers wrapped around them both and he began to pump his hand. Harry's mouth was captured for another kiss until he felt Draco's cum spill out of him and onto Harry's cock. It took almost nothing for Harry to cum then, his climax bursting forth, sending waves of pleasure through his body.
Harry shrugged again, "Well it's going to be a lot weirder testifying for Malfoy. And you're doing that one with me."
The other man feigned shock, threw his right hand against his chest, widened his eyes and said, "No! Potter, a boy?! What a scandal, wait till the Wizarding world finds out!" Then he smirked, removed his hand, and casually took a sip of his drink.
Currently, Harry sat with Ron and Hermione at the 8th year table and listened to Ron talk about Percy's attempts to regulate the firework displays sold at his brother's shop. He was feeling supremely guilty about the fact that his best friends didn't know something about him that all of the returning Slytherins knew. And possibly Neville. Probably Neville.
Harry cleared his throat, realizing that he’d been staring, “Sorry. I- I’m distracted,” he said, focusing his eyes on the tea in his hands instead.
"Yes actually, I do know," Pansy said with a grimace, "Wait here for a few minutes, I'll get him and Blaise out of the hallway. Seeing you would ruin him for the night. Be early tomorrow Scarhead." Then she left without waiting for him to reply.
"The Patronus is staying the course," Draco whispered, his lips brushing against the shell of Harry's ear, “we should keep moving.”
Consequently, he was late for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Again. He was seven minutes late, which was better than yesterday, when he had been nearly 15 minutes late after hiding out in the loo to avoid a 4th year trying to feed him suspiciously homemade cookies.
Harry smiled back at him, rolling his hips again to ease his painful erection, and keep Draco focused on what they both wanted. "Agree to come to the gala with me?"
As he stood in the living room, next to the untouched cat tree, and watched Orion frolick about in the giant box he'd brought it home in, he realized that two things-
which flew so far away from him that he was momentarily confused. It hit the barrier Hermione held and burst against it. The force crashed into his back and Harry hit the ground. He immediately cast a Protego, deflecting her next curse as she advanced. In the brief moment she hesitated he dropped the shield and cast
That’s suspicious. Pansy is not only excellent at following Draco’s direction, she is also fond of gloating about how she often does what he asks her to do. Maybe she’s upset with him? Maybe she already knows what he wants to talk about? He watches her for a moment, gauging her, then says, “We need to talk.”
“I thought muggles like it when people smile in pictures,” Draco had said, thankful that he could use the term freely during this assignment.
Draco only seemed caught off guard by her abrupt attempt to exit for a brief moment before his features schooled into an impassive expression. He nodded slightly and said, “Thank you for your hospitality Granger. I will see you soon.”
Draco hears Potter burst out of the potion-supply closet as soon as the front door is closed again. Draco casts
Harry unconsciously shifted his right hand, "Actually, I didn't know. I hadn't thought to catch up with her," he deadpanned.
If he didn't get release soon he thought he might actually pass out. "Neville," he said, pushing his words out, "if you don't let me leave I'm going to-"
"Mr. Potter," Professor Loire said, her sweet voice carrying easily through from the back of the classroom. "I'm pleased to see you are not late."
Draco swallowed thickly and pushed the head of his dick into Harry's open mouth, "Savior," he whispered.
“Let me take care of you,” Neville said, so quietly Blaise was grateful that he heard it over the rushing in his ears.
She walked towards him, "Yes, I've heard that about you. Though, lately, I've heard you live to serve a handful of people, rather than the entire wizarding world."
Harry filled his cup of tea and started cooking breakfast. Once he was full and the kitchen was clean he read the letter again and fire called Ron.
He’s been in England for less than 24 hours before stepping into the foyer of Grimmauld place, careful not to disturb the curtains covering Great Aunt Walburga's portrait. He knew Potter signed over this place to Andromeda while Draco was still in lockdown. Potter told her that he wanted her to have a nice place to raise Teddy and had spent the summer remodeling the ancestral home for them.
"I fought a lion," he answered easily, then gave Harry a little wink, as though they were sharing a secret.
A little after 9am Astrid looked down at her wrist and said, "Oh!" She jumped up and opened the bedroom door, peering into the hallway and saying, "I'm here, Uncle Harry."
Narcissa regarded him for possibly several hours, though it was most likely a mere ten seconds, before she spoke. "And which Mr. Malfoy are you referring to when you say the feelings are clear cut, Harry?
Draco actually feels his heart clench at the implication of those words and he kisses Potter just to shut him up.
Blaise didn't know what that meant. He didn't even know a Charlie. He did know Draco, and he knew that he couldn't have Draco mad at him. "Look I didn't-"
That drew a reluctant chuckle, easing some of the tension between them. "I guess I thought it made sense," Potter said with a shrug. "Ernie is a pureblood and part of the sacred 28. And you're," he waived a hand in Draco's direction, "you."
"Relax Hermione," Ron said with his hand on her leg. He looked up at Harry, "What is it mate? Do you think Draco Malfoy is up to something again?"
“I’d be happy to give you a blow by blow account Lucius,” Harry replied easily, watching the other man’s eyes narrow, “but I have a prior engagement.” He moved to step towards the floo.
Potter’s brows drew down and he tilted his head like a confused puppy. His eyes dropped to the list Draco was reading from. “Let me see that.”
“Fuck.” James dove in, releasing Teddy’s hand to link both arms around his neck and pull him into a hungry kiss. When Teddy’s hands gripped his waist, James pressed his body against him. Teddy’s tongue pressed against his bottom lip, rolling with a slick slide into his mouth when James gasped.
They reached the door to the building and started up the stairs. "Why were you involved in that discussion?"
Draco huffed a laugh, "You did that already, Potter, when we were eleven." Then he leaned down and kissed him.
On the way up, Harry gushed about Luna's pretty hair and told Neville that he was one of the fittest blokes from their year. Laughing at him, his friends pushed him through the door and followed him in.
Blaise felt gentle hands on his shoulders, turning him around and pushing him firmly back against the wall. His mind went blissfully blank, feeling Neville warm and solid, rolling their hips together. Neville’s hands slipped down to Blaise’s waist and he untucked Blaise’s shirt, sliding his hands over the warm skin beneath. Normally Blaise would rally against this, take the lead and tease the other boy until he begged for release. But with Potter’s thoughts coursing through him he couldn’t pull himself together for anything that resembled control.
A throat cleared and Harry's attention was pulled to the woman behind Luna. He walked up and put his hand out, "Hello, I'm Harry Potter."
Harry grinned, looked up, the head of a cock barely pressed to his bottom lip, and asked, "What was that?"
"Yes, that would be helpful," he said. He pulled out his file from his pocket. Unshrinking it and tilting it away so Potter couldn't see the list. "Have you ever been bonded to anyone?"
Draco is saved from answering that Confringo by Pansy, who opens the door to the Leaky and insists they both come inside. He has a good feeling about tonight.
He went in late in the day, filed the rest of the reports for the case and cleaned off his desk. During a late lunch he showered and changed into his favorite pair of denims -tight and flattering- and a black t-shirt with a golden snitch painted across the chest.
Blaise smirked, guessing Potter had discussed that phrasing with Hermione. He wondered if Hermione had bought it. Blaise sure as fuck didn't, he had heard too many thoughts to buy that lie.
Blaise bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing. "Can you say it again? I want to get the pronunciation down."
As they left the common room Harry could feel Zabini’s eyes on his back, making the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
Hermione spun and kissed Neville, who blushed like a first year from the friendly peck. Draco spun and the bottle landed on Pansy, which wasn't surprising. Draco was likely terrified of kissing anyone else in the room besides Blaise.
She felt her face flush and couldn't decide if it was because of the tone he was using or because she didn't know exactly why she'd lied about the introduction. "Sorry, Pi," she offered.
All four of them had been looking at Draco, and now, each of them turned to look at what had shut him up.
"Someone hurt Pansy, apparently she and Zabini left Malfoy to deal with It. They are in the Charms classroom."
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, trying to focus. He could feel his magic pouring into the other room, pooling purposefully around Draco, who shuddered and let a pleased smile grow on his face.
"Draco come on, you have to have some kind of idea about what you want to do after school," Blaise said, passing the last of the second bottle to Ernie.
James heard his father's voice through the foam but he couldn't see him. "Over here, Dad!" James called, pushing away multi-colored bubbles from his face.
Draco slips his wand back into its holster. "Indeed." He was at a complete loss. This whole thing was going to blow up in his face. It already had.
"Not that I owe you an explanation," Draco spoke in clipped tones, "but I spent a couple of weeks with her and Rosmerta before the trials. That's as much as I'm telling you." He lifted his chin, "Now get out of my way before I'm forced to hex you."
Pansy hopped down from the table and started to pace. "I want to be reasonable about this, but I just can't seem to find it in me," she said, seeming to talk to herself. She turned back to him, her robes twisting with her. "Why are you doing this to me? Just go be an auror! I know they offered it to you."
Hermione tsk'd and said, "It's important. Besides, the Headmistress gave a beautiful speech on moving past differences and coming together as a student body."
"That doesn't change the fact that you two are causing problems. She told me that she's excited about her date tonight. That she's starting to enjoy Draco a bit too much, thinking about kissing him even without the cameras." Pansy glares at Draco, "You're not supposed to hear that so don’t say anything to her about it or she will stop talking to me about you."
Unsure of how to proceed with a greeting that indicates ‘i can’t be disrespectful to you because you saved my life, but I’m not sure where we stand with each other,’ Harry gave her a careful nod, “Hello.”
“Master Malfoy, descendant from the noble house of Black!” Kreacher exclaimed, bowing low before Draco, “It would be an honor for Kreacher to serve you. How would you like your tea prepared?”
“Shut up Zabini,” Harry replied with an embarrassed laugh. He only called Blaise by his surname when he was being a total prat.
“Because no one ever asks if I won in a fight against a lion,” Draco said, lacing their fingers together, “they are just impressed that I survived.”
At least, he tried to shut the door, but Pansy stuck out her hand and pushed it back open. "Don't even think about it, Chosen One," she said and stormed into the house.
Two weeks before school started Neville and Luna planned a lunch outing for the Surviving members of the DA. Harry spent two hours with them at the Three Broomsticks. Rosmerta had closed the place for their private event and given everyone a round of Butterbeer on the house.
Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, when the sales clerk started talking again. "All right hun, I'm taking this stuff to the dressing room," he motioned to a multi tiered table displaying, what appeared to be, every tie ever made. At least, that's how it felt when the clerk said, "All you need to do is choose a tie."
He followed Blaise into the closet which was helpfully in Potter's direct line of sight. Blaise pointed to the top shelf at a light blue jumper that was folded and sitting on the edge. "Do you mind? I can't reach it,"  Blaise said, despite being the exact same height.
Harry felt his shoulders tense and the room grew suddenly hot. There were always articles about him, something atrocious must have come out for Pansy to be this excited to throw it in his face. True, they had built something of a truce over the last month, bordering on a friendship, but even as a true friend of a Slytherin you were always in danger of blackmail or good old-fashioned humiliation.
Harry watches him closely, thinking about the way Draco had responded. How he had kissed back with biting passion, how he’d dropped to his knees and used his teeth to pull at Harry’s clothes.
. When she’d first looked at the chapter index and spotted Harry’s name near the end she decided to start there. Now that an hour had passed and it was close to midnight, she wasn’t sure if that had been the best plan. She was only through the first half of 6 sections, and so far he’d already had to take out a giant snake, fight off Dementors, and was entered into a tournament which forced him into fighting a dragon. Worst of all, there was next to no information on the dragon.
When he looked back at Narcissa she had an eyebrow delicately raised as though she was posing a question. Harry felt his cheeks heat up and tried to compose his face into something with less emotion. Draco had told him many times that he wore his thoughts on his face. Narcissa turned to her son, showing Harry her profile. A silent conversation seemed to pass between them before she said aloud, "I assume this is why you told me to end the contract negotiations for Miss Greengrass?"
"Wake up you layabout," Draco said, pouting."I'm hungry and I want to get breakfast before the weasel eats it all."
Professor Liore pointed her wand at the tear and cast a quick mending charm. She then, pointedly look him up and down, and said, "I honestly thought that this is just how you look everyday," her eyes wandered again over his disheveled robes, his hair, and then met his eyes, "No disrespect."
The stone was freezing cold, covered in a light dusting from the snow. James was pleased to see no steam rose from how fast the snow was zapping warmth from his sweaty palm.
He checked his reflection in the mirror then, using a sticking charm, stuck a bow onto his right pectoral. He looked down at Orion, he was threading himself between Harry's legs. "Stay here this time little buddy," he said the cat, "I promise to be back soon." With that he headed through his door into the hallway and knocked on the door for the apartment next to his.
Harry fought the desire to lean into him. Or drag him out of the room and finish getting off. "So what are your plans?"
"You realize I will never let you live this down, right?" Draco pushes off the door, stalking towards him.
Potter joined him on the steps, his body so close to Draco's back that Draco could feel the waves of Potter's magic wrapping around him. He drew in a ragged breath, too overwhelmed to worry if Potter would notice.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, though he sounded anything but sorry. He was the picture of incredulous when he asked, “You work to help kids who have been bullied?”
he knew it was a futile hope. He let his mind wander as the rope was moved, and the other end securely tied to Draco's headboard.
Listening to the moans of pleasure next door, he realized the sub must be in handcuffs. Briefly, Harry wondered if the Wallbanger would be better at playing his Dom. He blushed furiously at the thought and reminded himself that he was supposed to be asleep, and therefore, supposed to be upset with his neighbor, not fantasizing.
Monday morning Harry sent a patronus to Dean and Seamus, letting them know he would be on site by 2. Normally he liked to show up early on Monday, to make sure everyone was starting on time and supply hangover potions when needed, but today was different. Today was June 5th. Today was Draco's birthday. And Harry wasn't willing to wait any longer for loose ends to be tied up. He tugged on the tight jeans from Pansy's shop, ran a glob of Sleekeazy’s through his hair, slipped on a black t-shirt.
The moonlight made everything so bright in the gardens. James could see Teddy easily. His hair, magenta today, was soft, falling in an artful tousle over clear blue eyes. His cheeks dusted pink from the cold, air coming out visible in soft puffs. And his lips.
On the evening of July 31st, Harry left Hogwarts in a foul mood. His mind was fuming with dark thoughts about Dolores Umbridge. He briefly entertained the idea of heading straight to the ministry to pick a fight with her in person. Only, Harry didn't want to fight, at least not for awhile.
- since just after the trials. Would have happened before? If they had been alone together would they have-
“Come on Harry, let’s teach Blaise how to play poker to get your mind off of things for a bit. It will help,” Neville left the room to get a deck of cards.
At least the birthday party is held on somewhat neutral ground because Draco knows the Golden Trio will be in attendance, along with a pack of Weasley’s. Even with the apprehension, he’s masking he knows he’s made the right decision about coming back home when Teddy insists on showing Draco every single toy in his room, sharing cake with him, and eventually, crashing from the sugar, in Draco’s arms on the plush sofa in the drawing-room.
He heard a whimper, a muffled petulant sound. Harry's magic started to whip about in his body and he took a deep breath to try and calm it, but the extra oxygen seemed to only fan the flame.
Harry narrowed his eyes and said, very quietly, "What are you, early twenties? We are only a couple years younger than you. Are you projecting?"
Harry let his eyes drop obviously over Malfoy, taking in his lips, broad shoulders, the exposed forearms, and the fingers wrapped around his fresh water glass. He looked back up to meet Malfoy's eye, "I haven't forgotten anything. But the war is over and you've always been able to get my attention. Just seems a bit different than it did in school. I suppose I thought it might be the same for you, yeah?"
Professor Loire instructed Ernie Macmillan and Terry Boot to create barriers for the other two sides. Then she conjured a row of chairs for the remaining students to sit down. "Here is the assignment, you will observe this duel, discuss at the end of class, and write a paper with your critique, which will be due tomorrow morning. Please pay attention, because you won't be able to review this as you do with the duels in your textbook."
"You do realize that you didn't actually tell me what's going on right? You just asked me more questions."
“Don’t be selfish, it’s the least you can do. It’s not like you’re going to have to share them,” Natalie giggled, “except with each other, I guess.”
Harry bit down hard enough to leave a mark on his pulse point. He didn't want any confusion about why Draco wouldn't be taking clients for two months. Or ever, if Harry had his way.
Draco pulled a face, "Your post coital talk needs work, a lot of work. I can't believe you just brought her up."
Children who were magically inclined were now contacted at first sign of accidental magic. Draco felt that was a better move in the Ministry's part. In fact, Draco had not only been a believer in bringing muggleborn children into the wizarding world at a younger age, he had funded a good portion of the programs.
Harry turned a shocked expression on the other boy, who smiled with false innocence. "Can I help you with something?" Harry asked.
Blaise shifted on the bed, trying to remember what happened in Potter’s life that he wouldn’t like this holiday. Not coming up with anything, he offered, “If you need to skip the party I’m sure no one would be upset.”
“What’s to do?” Blaise asked. “Draco is trying to keep his head down. The war changed him, he isn’t a bigot anymore. That’s one of the reasons he lives in a Muggle flat. I’m sure he won’t bother you. Just ignore him, Harry.”
Harry stepped toward her, placing a gentle hand on her arm, "Against anything," he said in a voice both quiet and fierce.
Draco pressed Harry into the wall and kissed him desperately, one hand at Harry's hip, encouraging his movements, the other hand carding through Harry's hair, and tugging gently at it. Harry's entire focus zeroed in on the kiss, and he felt his body melt into the solid man pressing into him. His magic spread out from his core wrapping around both of them, searching to interact with Draco's.
“Do you two need anything?” the clerk asked, as though Harry was capable of polite conversation at the moment.
“No,” McGonagall replied, “she was sentenced to six months, however, she only had to serve three of them. I was told that her assigned Auror found her to be a model citizen,” she finished, and Harry swore he could hear her eyes roll at the statement.
The canvas above him moved and Harry jumped up to catch it before it fell onto his head. He cast a strong wandless sticking charm to remount the picture more securely than the muggle nails. -speaking of mounting-
you helping me with this project. I still can't tell you what it is, but your cooperation is needed."
“Pansy,” Draco calls out, grabbing a bottle of wine off the rack. He hears a bump from upstairs and freezes. His heart rate spikes and he holds his breath, his body tensing up into a tight coil. “Pansy?”
“I think we should play Never Have I Ever,” Daphne said, pushing back long chestnut-brown hair from her shoulder.
Draco opened the door just enough to see who had knocked. "Blaise, what can I do for you?" he asked, letting the door swing open.
Pansy's eyes went so dark that Harry shut his mouth. Maybe he didn't have much self preservation, but he had enough to stop talking in that moment.
The explicit tag will be more included in later chapters. However, I primarily do my best writing in the *fluff with plot* areas, so fair warning on both accounts!
Harry stared at her for a moment, trying to understand. Then he huffed a laugh, "Do you mean nargles?"
He looked down at the paper and stared dumbly at it for at least a full minute, until his spinning head demanded air. Sucking in a breath, he tried to comprehend what he was holding. It appeared to be a drawing of himself wrapped up in the arms of Harry
Ron looked down at the table, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Until Pansy broke in with, "Guess you two will have to wait till Ron's an auror and you can get away with it, then," earning her a broad grin from both Draco and Ron.
Draco pulled off, his swollen lips smirking up at Harry, “Yeah Astoria, why?” he replied, still stroking Harry’s cock with an agonizing gentleness.
"I know not to touch things that aren't mine, darling." That was Zabini, his honey voice impossible to mistake for anyone else.
He pointed to the door on his left, "You're looking for that one, I’m 392. Good luck with your drive," he said.
Hermione opens the door to find the loveliest bouquet of flowers she's ever seen, not to mention the largets. The Cape Jasmine flowers take up half her desk, shifting in color between each petal so that even one flower is several shades of pink, blue, white, and violet. With so many flowers she's surprised the smell isn't overwhelming, but there's only a hint of jasmine in the air. Hermione turns back to Pansy only to find her assistant right behind her, peeking over Hermione's shoulder.
Draco doesn't say anything in response. Instead he cocks an eyebrow at her because really he doesn't know the safest way to play this without more information.
"No! Don't answer that," Draco said, grabbing Potter's forearm before he answered her. "Ok, bye Anna."
Fanfiction is highly influential, bordering on cult like qualities. The effects on the psyche appear to be similar to imperious. I recommend we keep a close eye on the muggles who write them. Most of the authors are likely harmless, self-indulgent, fanboys (or fangirls). However, I fear that, given time, the stories could infiltrate the muggle population, having even more influence than the original Harry Potter series.
"Mr. Potter," Professor Loire said, her voice floating through the office in a way that made Harry suspect she might have some Veela heritage, "surely there must be one female in Hogwarts whom you trust."
set of brand new clothes for the party, while Harry rolled his eyes and smiled down at his breakfast. Teddy was pointedly ignoring them, eating his beans and reading the
Teddy gave her a nervous smile and then looked to Harry for guidance. Harry shrugged looking just as confused as his godson. Teddy looked back at Astrid and said, "OK…. Just don't take anything out."
“Good, thank you,” Draco said, careful not to sound surprised. He knew that werewolves were a special topic for Hermione and he hadn’t been sure she would grant his request to study them.
"That is information I received from several sources, most of them Death Eaters," Lucius said. "It includes a few things that I think you will find noteworthy, including her enthusiastic cooperation with the Dark Lord's regime. Eye witness accounts of the torture, imprisonment and deaths of several people, specifically Muggle-borns."
Harry roughly exhaled and said quietly, “Yeah,” he kicked the door open a bit more, “All right.” Then turned around and walked back into the kitchen, listening to the sound of Draco walking into his house and shutting the door behind him.
Daphne looked up from the dragon she was drawing to give Blaise a death glare. He winked back at her.
Harry stepped closer so he was crowding the man against the wall, not quite touching him. "I've always been that way. I once set a snake free at the zoo."
spells at the love bites. "Bloody fucking vampire." Though his thoughts were centered around how good Draco's teeth and lips had felt. He gave his reflection a guilty smile. Harry was thankful that Neville had seen him, rather than Ron or Hermione.
“Does an alcove count?” Hermione asked, and everyone turned to look at her. “I haven’t- I was just curious about the parameters.”
Harry picks up his glasses from a side table next to the door and looks Hermione over. “Are you doing all right?”
Harry shoved down the desire to pull his wand, and said, “I would be more than willing to dispose of you if it comes to that.” He slowly looked up at Lucius with a smug curl to his lips. “Fortunately, I already have the approval of the parent that matters. Now take your hand off me or I will remind you of exactly who you’re threatening.”
For a moment she considers not answering. This is Malfoy, she doesn't want to share details with him, but she knows that won't work. She needs to get him to agree to this. “He’s oblivious, dense, he doesn’t stimulate me, his main interests are quidditch and signing his name for war hero groupies. He still gets most of his meals from his mother because I won't cook all of them and he’s either sleeping with his Auror partner or he’s headed in that direction.”
article about me last week.” He said, remembering Pansy’s words. Draco blushed faintly before he dropped the letter and pushed the papers aside as though it were a pile of trash.
The next morning Harry used magic to unpack the kitchen and bathroom, as Molly had told him that these rooms were the most essential to unpack first. He built a new bookcase by hand, but set the books to file themselves on the shelves alphabetically. He ate leftover pizza and looked over the blueprints he'd been working on for a new client. The last thing he did for the night was hang a large canvas print above his bed, using nails and a hammer. He wanted to do at least a few things the Muggle way, since he was in this flat. Luna had gotten the canvas for him during Christmas last year, it was a photograph of the first building he’d ever worked on renovating, outside of Hogwarts. In the corner of the photo print Luna had written
Harry set his tea on the coffee table so he could put his face in his hands. He couldn’t look people in the eye
Harry sank into the couch and listened to the wireless, drinking Ogden's and encouraging Orion to play with the fringe of his blanket. By his second glass it was nearly 11 and his alcohol induced brain had formulated a plan. Nearly half an hour later he heard someone coming up the stairs. Harry jumped off the couch, snagging a jelly bean on the way and popping it into his mouth. He held the jellybean on his tongue and listened through the door. It wouldn't do any good to blow this plan on someone who wasn't intending to bed Draco.
Harry spent the rest of the walk putting up a valiant effort to ignore the curve of Draco's ass. He failed.
Draco drops his head into his hands. "Is that really what you got from that statement?" he asks, the words muffled through his hands.
“Not that exact one, but you can trust them. Daphne has been making those tattoo things for a few months now, I’m sure she can manage to turn you blue for a party.”
They stared at each other for a moment, the fire heating Harry's face until Ginny broke into a fit of laughter and said, "I'm going. I'll talk to you soon Harry," and cut the connection.
Three weeks into term Blaise walked through the common room and up to the boy's dorms. Draco has been subdued, keeping to himself as much as possible. He said his room wasn't too bad, he only spends time in there when he needs to sleep, but Blaise knew Draco had been sleeping on the couch in the common room several nights this week.
After a beat, Draco broke eye contact and shrugged, “I still think you’re a know it all,” he said, a touch of drawl in his response, “but only because you’re much smarter than the other students at our school. I’m still going to work hard at beating your marks this year.” He looked back up at her, the trepidation in his eyes betraying his attempt for casualness, “Assuming you’re returning?” he finished.
,” Lucius leaned back slightly as Harry got closer, “I have started dating him, it could lead to true courting really, if I’m being honest with you.” Once he was about a foot away from Lucius he shrugged casually and stuffed his hands in his pockets, “You don’t mind him dating, do you?”
Hermione sighed, “I have, though I’m pretty sure he’s still waiting for me to come around.” She looked around the common room, then back at him. “Do you really not know if you find men attractive?”
"Perhaps," Harry agreed. "I mean, I'd love to argue in favor of my son but I've met Scorpius. Albus is a good kid, he's just a bit-" Harry cut himself off, unsure how to finish. Both of his kids were amazing. James had been a Gryffindor, skating through school on charm and minimal study habits. Albus though, Albus was far too intelligent for anyone's good, excited by mischief, rebellious, and enthralled by the games he played to incite a reaction from others.
They stood there facing each other, hands twitching at their sides, and breathing heavy. Draco broke eye contact with a rough exhale and ran his fingers through his hair.
"Well I could probably use the help from anyone willing," Harry said. Then, think of Neville and Blaise, he added, "Though I'm starting to worry about the trend of finding my Gryffindor friends in suspiciously intimate settings with Slytherins."
Astrid promptly choked on her tea and had a coughing fit while Harry smirked, leaned back in his chair and waited for her to recover.
Pansy chuckled into her pillow, "That's absurd. We would never work. Besides, Neville is hot, you're hot. You should be hot together."
After slipping the postcard into the back pocket of his denims, he located a piece of parchment and scratched out a response.
Draco looked over him, licking his bottom lip before he let it pull into a haughty smirk, and finally said the words. "Suck my cock, Potter."
The sound broke through Harry's confused thoughts. He locked eyes with Draco and he realized the ding was his floo, it was a floocall.
Harry's eyebrows drew together at the thought of Lucius and he tried not to scowl. "I- Er," he felt his lips flatten against each other. He tried to form a delicate, slytherin style response and replied, "I wouldn't say that. I find my feelings to be fairly clear cut regarding Mr. Malfoy."
When Harry came to Diagon Alley near the end of May, with Hermione and Ron, the three of them were bombarded by people the entire time. Even in the shops, they weren't able to get away or purchase their things without several people coming up to touch Harry, or talk over each other. They wanted to say thank you, ask him out, offer him gifts, or ask him to come for dinner. By the end of it, Harry was thrown into a panic attack and Ron had to side-along him back to Grimmauld place.
"No," Pansy said, lifting up onto her elbows. "I mean that Draco might benefit from this. So you could get away with it. If you get caught, just say you were trying to help him out."
Draco closed his eyes, straining to grasp the frayed edges of his sanity. He needed Potter to stop saying
Draco didn’t even bother to look up from the letter he was reading, “Potter,” he said, “is this actually a pile of fan mail you have here?” He set the letter down and pulled forward another one.
Harry felt confused, he'd thought they were just bantering, but her tone indicated something more serious. He watched as she pulled a piece of parchment from her robes and handed it to him.
Harry took a breath and focused on the lights in the hallway, willing them to flicker dramatically. After a beat, he swallowed the jellybean and opened the door. "What's going on out here?" He asked, twitching his fingers slightly to restore the light to normal.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by a two-hit knock and the door to their room opening. Seamus stood in the entryway eyeing the two of them before saying anything. "Hullo Harry, Malfoy. Got a minute?"
Harry bit back a groan, willing himself to keep in mind that he was in a restaurant with other people. The promise of Draco's text combined with the picture had him considering a quick wank in the loo. When he looked back up it was to find Dean and Seamus staring at him expectantly.
"Pi-" she started, then looked at the floor. Scorpius nearly mentioned that they hadn't agreed on that nickname, but realized he could feel her hand tremble and knew something was actually scaring her.
Daphne nodded, "It is. Ms. Malfoy cut them off. It's a good thing too. Astoria is going to come out to Mom over the holiday break."
He chanced a glance at Draco who was already looking at him and Harry had to fight down the desire to move forward. All he wanted to do at this moment was collect on the promise he could see in those silver eyes, feel the comfort of his embrace.
Pansy rolled her eyes at his smile and turned back to the red head. "I know we've met," she said, offering a Ginny a smile that Harry had never seen her give before, "but I feel like a proper introduction is in order for a fresh start." She put out her hand, "Pansy."
Heading into the corridor for the boy's dorms he could hear Neville's voice filtering into the hallway from the open door.
Harry glared at the parchment for proving the other man right, “Yes well it’s my mail and I doubt that’s the reason you showed up at my door,” he looked back at Draco. “Or were you going to offer to do a dramatic reading for me? Parkinson mentioned that you did one for her with the
Walking through Diagon Alley Draco glanced sidelong at Potter. At least in the trim fit of his blood-red auror robes Potter looked normal again, Draco had seen enough aurors in his lifetime to become desensitized to that outfit.
This chapter is a bit longer than normal. My editing is done for now so I should have anther chapter out for this by the weekend!
"Granger is my friend and I want to know exactly what it is you two are doing with her before this all goes to shit and I end up buying her several pints of ice cream."
“No one knows about the company I keep,” Potter says. Green eyes travel with open hunger over Draco’s body. “And if they ever make me choose between my life and my job they are going to be sorely disappointed with the outcome.”
Friday morning Harry woke up late. He made it to breakfast in time to chug down a glass of pumpkin juice and cram in two pieces of toast before the food disappeared. Ron and Hermione had already left for class so he knew he would have to brave the storm of students alone.
Draco opens his eyes to find Potter standing above him, hands stuffed into the pockets of loose-fitting denims, Puddlemore shirt stretched across broad shoulders. Merlin, he’s filled out nicely. Draco attempts to squash that thought and summon his anger but it won’t come. Not that he was expecting it, honestly. He isn’t interested in hating anyone anymore, not after the war, and Azkaban. Instead, he’s left with the underlying pulse of attraction he’s felt for Potter since 5th year and the lack of balance makes his heart beat too fast.
Potter studied him, chewing at his bottom lip. "Alright," he said. Then, nodding at the building behind Draco, he added, "Do you mind if we stop here to grab a cup of coffee?"
Kreacher appeared with a crack, startling Harry enough to make him jump in his seat which screeched on the tile. Harry had repeatedly asked him to stop fucking doing that!
“You’re right,” Hermione said, drawing Draco’s attention back to her, “Harry is unobservant, except when it comes to his work, or,” she paused, a smile tugging her lips, “other obsessions.”
"Hello Potter," Draco said without looking up. "Would you please get the Headmistress?" his voice was a oddly calm.
Harry's hips, which were desperately trying to thrust forward, were pinned to the wall by long elegant fingers. Draco had come into the room with an agenda, shoving Harry against the wall, and sinking to his knees. Harry was no stranger to blowjobs, but nothing had ever come close to the sight of
When Draco returned to his office he sat at his desk for nearly half an hour replaying the conversation in his head. He wasn't able to determine what, exactly, had happened. All he knew for sure was that Hermione Granger really
“Of course.” Hermione opened the file and skimmed through Draco’s report. “This looks like about what I expected,” she said.
Stomach churning at the words, Draco turned around to find a pretty girl looking up at him. Her eyes were lined with thick eyeliner, and she had purple streaks in her hair.
“I think you should go for it mate,” Seamus said, cutting through the reverence. “It would be the perfect end to your story.” He flashed Harry a broad grin, “You’re the hero, Malfoy was the damsel in distress.”
"I don't want to take advantage," Neville said, slipping a finger through the belt loops on Blaise's trousers to pull him flush against Neville's own straining erection.
Harry looked at the mess of stones on the ground. "Sorry Pansy," he said, his shoulders slumped. "I shouldn't have gone to that lunch."
So, Harry had stopped trying to talk about them and instead, chose to lavish affection on Draco's chest with his lips and fingers. Which he tried to do during the shower, but it turned out, Draco was serious about the speed of their shower. So they were both dressed and ready to leave at the same time as Pansy.
Lucius smiled, somehow affecting a gracious cruelty in the expression usually meant for happiness, "Please do. In the meantime, I can be assured that Draco is safe at Hogwarts and this woman will be removed from your employ?"
“Oh!” she said, sounding surprised. After a brief silence she spoke up again, “I’ll go see if the sales guy can help me with-” she paused, then said, “I’ll think of something.”
Harry humms, getting distracted by the way Draco's elegant fingers are massaging his neck. “I hadn’t thought of that. I mean, I assumed they have someone who plays as me, or fucks as me, I suppose. But I hadn’t thought about who the person is in real life.” He grins at the idea and asks, “Do you think it’s someone I know?”
That let loose another round of bitter, painful, thoughts from Potter. Things that didn't seem to connect involving Snape, Mom, Sirius falling through the veil, and, again Voldemort. Blaise tried to think of something innocent to say, something that would distract Potter. "Unicorn," he said.
Hermione took a deep breath and Harry was briefly terrified that she seemed to be bracing herself for whatever she was about to say. "Harry," she started, "have you thought about asking him to dinner?"
“Yeah yeah, I heard that he’s moving to Romania in a few months." They both look out at the dance floor, to watch Charlie's boyfriend, Darius, dancing with Fluer.
He scoffed in response, “If you’re going to pout like that you should slump your shoulders a bit, right now your body language isn’t showing any defeat.” He slumped his shoulders forward and hung his head, then looked up at her through his lashes and said, “Please?” letting his voice break at the end of the word.
She pursed her lips, "That, Potter, is a plaque for our room from Lovegood. She thrust it at me upon arrival, kissed me on the cheek and told me that she is happy for both of us."
Ron cocked an eyebrow at him "I'm one of seven Malfoy. I know how to share." He glanced at Harry, and added, "Not that either of you would know anything about that."
Scorpius didn’t even blink before he gave his usual reply, “He’s not here.” He didn’t care that Harry was in the upstairs study. This reply was the same thing he said to everyone, regardless of Harry’s presence in the house. Draco and Harry had been together since Scorpius was three years old. At six, he had used his birthday to ask for them to be a real family and Harry had bought their house the next day, followed by a wedding in the gardens of Malfoy Manor 8 months later. With the six years that followed, Scorpius was well practiced at rebuffing the Harry Potter fans who came sniffing around.
*En Temerant Voistra is a reference to a book list in one of my favorite stories. Please read Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss! It's amazing!
McGonagall paused to look each student in the eye, which wasn’t that many, there were only 16 students returning for NEWT exams. “Your colors are white for goodness and violet for wisdom and peace. I ask that each of you take these traits into account, along with the ideals behind the capybara, while interacting with each other. Your password is 'simul' and your room listings are on the corkboard in the common room.”
Harry stayed quiet for a moment, pulling Draco closer. "I don't really know, I don't have anything to compare it to, honestly."
"I told you to stop taking bets from Ravenclaws," Harry said to Seamus when he was walking back to the pile of pillows he considered a seat.
The Professor smirked, "See you tomorrow then. I'm going to fortify your work for tonight. You can't be here for that so go home or to wherever you two go when you're not here."
Spending time with Teddy was almost always pleasure without release. And it’s not like James didn’t have a bed to himself tonight. For now, he just needed to think of a way to keep Teddy’s fingertips on him without letting his brazen cock be seen.
“Welcome back Astrid,” Draco spoke behind her and she turned to find him and Scorpius giving her the same small smile.
"Malfoy," Harry's eyes raked over the blonde. He'd never seen him in muggle clothes before. Draco wore designer denims with a dark grey jumper. He looked good. He looked like-
Harry's lips tilt into something that's almost a smile. He looks at her for a long moment and Hermione feels like she's missed something. "I'm going to jump in the shower, you look for your clothes and we can meet in the kitchen in fifteen minutes?"
Draco takes all of his things to Pansy's flat when he gets to England. Being back is one thing, going to the manor is something else entirely. She has agreed to let him stay there if he pays the rent, and Draco has already purchased the flat from her landlord. He is Malfoy, he's not going to do anything so plebeian as pay rent. He has his lawyer draw up the documents to sign the property over to Pansy but he doesn't tell her right away because he knows that she will think he's gone soft and accused him of being a Hufflepuff™.
Draco stepped out of his dressing room and met his eye through the mirror’s reflection. Harry’s eyes dropped down to see Draco had rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt to his elbows, leaving his forearms on display. Somehow, Draco's dark mark only made things harder. Images of pushing Draco against the wall and kissing him breathless flashed through his mind and his recently calmed erection returned full-force.
Draco's eyes seemed to search Harry's face before he said, "All right. 10 am." He sauntered away, heading for his apartment, obviously letting Harry enjoy the view until he slipped through the door.
After that, Pansy spends nearly an hour on the phone with her assistant regarding Harry's clothes. Then she gives him a lecture on the benefits of being a walking billboard for her company, and forbids Harry from getting any come on her clothes. The idea that Pansy thinks his chances are high enough to issue that warning makes his stomach erupt into butterflies. She slips a piece of paper into his hands with the address for her warehouse on one side, and Draco's mobile number on the other.
“You make me believe, you make me forget,” Harry replied, his chest constricting from lack of oxygen. "And you're the best lay I've ever had."
Pansy stilled, taking a deep breath. A tense silence fell between them until she met his eye, "Are you-"
Hermione holds her breath, she can't be the only one feeling the tension between them. Looking into his eyes with her hands clenched she fights the desire to drag him into her office and tear off both their clothes. She closes her eyes and repeats the thought like a mantra-
Draco made a note to look further into that tag when he got home. He'd been avoiding it because ALL of them seemed to be combined with tags that made him blush like a 3rd year.
"Well in general it's just grossly neglected and dirty," Harry began, "On the 3rd floor is a room full of Voldemort newspaper clippings from the first war, there's spiders and cobwebs in everything, there's a couple bogarts on the 2nd floor and a portrait of a bloody sadist who screams in the hallway, an umbrella stand is here somewhere made from the leg of a troll." He paused for a moment trying to remember if he'd missed anything, "Oh! And there's a row of mounted elf heads along the stairs."
Well, that was his last refuge demolished. Once Granger had it in her mind for Draco to do something there wasn’t much argument to be made. As her word was the main reason the Ministry had let him start work here, Draco knew better than to cross her.
"I have. I did everything you asked,” Harry replied, flushing at the thought of choosing that collar.
The two of them stood, dusted off and headed for the hall. Harry turned back before leaving, "Professor?"
Blaise stilled, then sat casually in the chair to cover up the tension. Draco must have talked to her. "Darling, have you been gossiping about me?"
Luna's eyes brightened, "I know just the thing!" She spun about and lead him to the west wing. Once there, she threw open the door to reveal a staff room being expanded built into a dormitory. "This is going to be for you guys, the 8th years," she said.
Thankfully the Headmistress arrived quickly with Filch in tow. She grilled in to them about their actions, assigned punishment, and instructed Filch and Neville to take the students back to their dormitories. Turning back to Draco she said, "Mr. Malfoy, you did the right thing not hurting them. I'm sure that it wasn't easy to stay calm when your friend had been hurt. I will make sure this incident does not cause problems with the Wizengamot."
“The giggler has been getting done like this for the last three nights?” Luna asked delightedly, then slapped her hand over her mouth as more moaning laughter filtered through the wall.
Harry and Kingsley exchanged a look. Harry tried desperately not to project his thoughts on his face, but he had a feeling that Kingsley was thinking the same thing.
To his left, Draco chuckled briefly before covering his face with his hand and pulling himself back together. “I apologize,” the effect of his usual clipped tones was slightly ruined by his obvious attempts to reign in his laughter. “I don’t think this is funny. I just- While I agree with Harry that an inner-house party is commendable, a foam party is not.”
Kreacher served Draco first, setting his food down and giving a long winded introduction of himself. He told Draco they had met when Draco was barely two years old and said that Narcissa Black was the finest bred woman in the whole family.
"No. Yes," Harry gave a humorless laugh. "Honestly, the flat is great but," he looked down at his coffee, feeling a blush start on his cheeks, "I can hear the bloke next door."
Harry bit his lip as his mind offered up at least a hundred reasons why he shouldn’t, and said, “Yeah. Let’s.”
Oh right, James and Teddy. Harry had talked to both of them actually, several times. Dancing around the subject the way parents often try to do, without mentioning specific names. He was pretty sure James had been in love with Teddy since before the boy left Hogwarts. Shifting his weight, Harry slipped his wand into its holster and looked around the patio.
She smiled back, “I won't try to wake you up tomorrow until at least 8am. That’s an hour later than normal.”
"You understand, of course, that this type of deflection only makes me more suspicious." Draco flitted from his food to Harry's and back before he added, "In the interest of honesty, I may have encouraged a few of those theories."
As he watched her bound up the stairs to the room, Scorpius stepped over to Teddy and gently knocked his shoulder against the other boy's. "Isn't she great?" Scorpius asked with a broad grin, "Father got her for me."
“I order from this place fairly regularly,” Harry replied, as he forced his eyes off of Draco’s throat and onto his own food. Draco’s throat, which was connected to his body, which was in Harry’s house. A house that had a bedroom in it.
Draco leaned over, nipping Potter's ear, and said, "Be nice. I'll make it up to you later." He shifted towards the arm of the sofa, leaving room for Blaise to sit between them.
Ron tilted his head, eyes falling briefly to Harry's neck, then looked at Draco. Harry turned to look with him, realizing Draco was the picture of debauched. His sexy hair tousled, cheeks flushed, and he was sporting a love bite on his neck with another on his collarbone. Harry chewed at his bottom lip, trying to think of how to best handle this.
"A shock!" she managed to say, once her laughter had settled. "Salazar's knickers, Potter. I can't believe how dense you are." Pansy took a calming breath and looked back at Harry, "Only an oblivious Gryffindork is capable of being in denial about the obsession, much less sexual tension, between the two of you," she said in a tone reminiscent of Hermione's matter-of-fact speeches. "I am not shocked. I am concerned that you two will kill each other, but more than that I worry about what everyone else will do when they find out."
Hermione smiled sweetly, "You're absolutely right, Harry. Draco was up to something." She looked up at Pansy, "Let's do an experiment, Pansy can you tell me what the name Draco means?" she asked, her voice dripping with false innocence.
Potter leans forward to nibble his ear, “Do you think you can do it? Seduce her? Hermione isn’t easy to coerce and she doesn’t even know that you and I are together.”
“I have a job starting in September actually,” Draco replied, setting down his cone. “So I won’t be, what did you call it, wall bouncing?”
Standing at the table, Harry tried to recall if he'd ever been given advice on ties. He glanced up to see a small mirror bolted to a pillar in front of him. Looking over his reflection he tried to decide what would look best. His natural olive skin looked bronze, still holding its tan from the summer. He ran a hand through his dark hair and sighed. Looking back at the ties, he chose three: light grey, dark green, and neutral blue.
That’s how Draco found himself waiting for Potter outside of a building for the second time that day. He should have been annoyed, possibly walked off in a huff, but it gave him a bit of breathing room. He’d been thinking about fanfiction for two days straight, and he’d been forced into spending time with Potter for several hours now. Something about that idea, being forced to to spend time with Potter, tickled the back of his mind. Before he could focus too much on it, Draco heard a girl call his name.
Draco vanished Harry's jeans and brought a hand down to Harry’s bare ass in one swift motion. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulder and held on for dear life, kissing him, their bodies flush.
"The project," Draco said. He took a deep breath, trying to remember how he was supposed to phrase this request. "Hermione said I should ask you to help me with the project."
Thankful for the change in subject, Harry replied, “As long as I’m with him, I don’t care. The press can fuck off.”
Pansy smirked, "I put galleons on them in 5th year. I have a standing bet with Theo that those two will hook up."
"Oh my God!" Astrid gasped, her hands jerking to cover her mouth and causing a bit of tea to spill over the rim.
Harry stumbled through the floo into the drawing room at Number 12. He stepped away quickly, not wanting to block the entrance. Green flames lit up the hearth and then died down, leaving Draco to step out elegantly onto the carpet.
Scorpius cocked an eyebrow at the performance and looked over at his father, who was wearing the exact same expression. They exchanged a quick glance before looking at Harry, who had pretty much melted.
Draco set down his quill and turned to look at Blaise, studying his face. "Does this person speak French?"
Harry swallowed through his dry throat, summoned his famed courage, and finished the sentence, "I want to build my future with him."
Potter cast longing looks at the display case before telling Draco, “I’m going to stop in here and use the loo. Be right back.”
Harry reached the door in record time with a breathless, "Hey, Dudley," as he gently pulled Draco back by the waist.
Harry cringed at the word mobile and hoped it wasn't his magic causing issues with the reception. Hermione had warned him about his casual use of wandless. She said wands give more direction but Harry's magic came so easily since the war that most of the time he didn't really think about it. Magic was just something he did, like walking, or breathing.
Potter. In the picture, Harry had a grip on Draco's green and silver tie, and Draco's fingers were threaded through the disaster that is Potter's hair.
Harry swallowed, he didn’t know what to say, because that was true but he also had the distinct feeling that Draco was setting him up. Finally he said, “You said you would overcharge me.”
Hermione feels her face pull into a grimace, “My first choice is not a good option. It would be too complicated and he’s terrible at lying.”
"Blaise is doing a good job with his business," Draco says through a chuckle. "That guy looked surprisingly similar to me."
James pulled off immediately, spinning around to leave Sirius’ old room, pulling a smug Teddy Lupin behind him.
Hufflepuff response died in his throat when they both heard the door handle jiggling. Jumping into action they had enough time to zip up before the intruder cast
For the first time since the war, Harry could feel his magic whipping about in his body starting from his solar plexus, as though it was desperate to cast a spell. It was always that way though- wasn't it? - where Malfoy was concerned. He had the ability to drag an intense reaction out of Harry, every single time they had met, since they were 11 years old.
Blaise glanced up before returning to his task. "Hello to you as well, lifelong friend," he replied, pulling out a quill from the side pocket.
"Actually, it's clear cut on both of them. If you're asking how I feel towards your son I can say without any doubt-"
Hey everyone! I'm going to do a writing challenge to write 25k words in the month of August. If you want to join, drop me a comment!
Draco swallowed hard, opting to take another sip of the Ogden’s Kreacher had supplied before responding. “Yes, let’s get started.”
"No, I'm not letting you do this," Pansy said. "You're not going to mind fuck this and ruin your chances." She reached over to collect everything Blaise had just set down.
Her assistant is sitting dutifully at the large desk in front of Hermione's closed-door office and she smiles when Hermione walks up. "Morning boss," Pansy says. "Your notes for the meeting are on your desk along with a bouquet of multicolored Cape Jasmines."
Realization dawned on Draco’s face, "Yes," he said, his voice growing less shaky, "yes, of course. I should have thought of that." When Draco stood up he wasn't trembling, "May I use your floo?"
Millicent kissed Ernie as well, then Romilda kissed Daphne. When Pansy spun the bottle it landed on Potter and everyone froze, even Pansy. She looked at Draco, who shrugged, then at Potter.
Potter lifted onto his shins and hopped up. "Malfoy," he said, with a quick nod. Draco gave a nod back, as his eyes dropped down to see that Potter was wearing charcoal-grey joggers.
She closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. "Fine," she said quietly, "just don't do anything stupid."
"Even Slytherin's don't kiss without consent, Granger," Draco said, not quite meeting her eye. "There's a charm for the bottle so it only stops if both are willing to at least kiss." He peeked up at her, "I can teach it to you, if you like."
The moment dinner was finished Scorpius and Teddy asked if they could go out to the manor's Quidditch pitch to fly brooms. Draco granted the request on grounds they take Astrid with them. Astrid kissed and hugged everyone at the table before leaving, even Andromeda, whom she'd only met for the first time last weekend, before she left with the boys. She wasn't sure how long they planned to stay, but she found it unlikely they would still be here when she returned.
Once all of his paperwork is done and the latest sleeping drought is bottled, Draco apparates straight into his room. He needs to change and find Pansy. He pulls off all of his clothes, dropping them into the laundry basket which they promptly disappear from. Spades, Pansy’s house elf, had given him the basket when he first moved in. For a house elf, Spades was oddly cautious about privacy. Draco tugs on a pair of grey joggers and a light-blue long-sleeved shirt. Then heads downstairs, bare feet padding across the carpet, until he reached the kitchen.
Hermione nods and watches him walk to the bathroom. That was not the reaction she had been expecting. She starts to get that feeling again, the one she had through most of school. Harry Potter is up to something.
Draco guides him onto the desk, pushing off paperwork and a mug full of pens as he lays Harry down. "How long, Potter?"
At least it wasn’t the war. Draco felt his shoulders slump and forced himself to sit up straight. “Does Granger-”
The weighted silence that fell over the room was broken a few minutes later by the scraping of Harry’s chair against the tile as he stood and left the room saying, “I will talk to Dudley tomorrow when he comes to pick you up. Scorpius and Teddy, will you please take Astrid shopping for this event? Get your outfits as well of course,” he said. Then he turned to Draco, “Come upstairs and remind me why I'm going to this party.”
Without a word, Potter stepped closer, barely touching Draco. He slipped his hand against Draco's waist, sending a shiver through his entire body, and grabbed the doorknob.
“Merlin, Harry, you do. The way you move. You take me all the way,” Draco replied, gripping Harry’s hips to encourage the way they were rolling against his erection. “Stay with me?” he whispered.
Pansy slowly looked her up and down, the way Ron Weasley looked at pie covered in whipped cream. It made Harry very uncomfortable.
He opened his browser to see the multiple AO3 tabs still open from the night before. With a long-suffering sigh, he started to categorize the tags, crossing off the ones that didn't apply as he went. For most of them, he wrote down little notes for Granger to read when he turned in the report.
"Ernie! I was worried this would be snakes only," Harry said happily, then winced in pain from Draco's elbow hitting his ribcage.
Both boys pulled up and out of the water, grabbing their clothes and heading to the door. Teddy turned, just before taking a step in, to look between Mr. Malfoy and Harry.
George looked up with quirked lips, put his hand on Harry's shoulder and said, "Yeah mate, obviously."
"Where the hell are you taking me?" James trudged after Teddy through the gardens at Number 12. He hadn't planned on being outside in this weather. Or, rather, in the results of previous weather.
Lucius grabbed his arm, stopping him from leaving, and said, “You insolent brat, your crudeness isn’t doing you any favors. Don’t you know that I can take him away from you? He’s my son, and I will never be willing to let you have him.”
Harry’s breathing sped up, his body arching to try and touch Draco as much as possible while keeping steady against the door.
She set down her stuff and opened the wardrobe, then cast a cautious look back at Scorpius before she stepped inside.
Harry looked over Draco’s robes, they were light grey with black embroidered trim and cut in a modern fashion to accentuate the broadness of his shoulders. The collar was mid-length, leaving Draco’s neck exposed above his adam’s apple, and Harry could see-
She tucked into her food for a moment and took a drink of water. Then, looking back up at him, "Is it really that bad with the others that you have to avoid them and work with a death eater sympathist?"
Pansy didn't say anything, just cocked an eyebrow at Blaise. He stared at her, trying to understand where she was going with this. The only conclusion he could think of was so absurd that-
Harry's brain did a quick recount of the last 30 minutes in the office. The comments, the clothing, the little smiles. When the pieces fell into place his jaw dropped. “Holy shit!” he cried, “You. What? You can’t- Mione! You are not- what? And- and Ron?” He tried to stop talking. Tried to let her say something but the amusement in her eyes when she turned her gaze on him made Harry panic even further.
Next to Hermione, Daphne Greengrass smirked, nudging Hermione with her shoulder. "Are you sure it wasn't that study group you had this afternoon? You did have Pansy do your makeup over lunch."
“It’s no bother,” Draco said. His cheeks were still flushed but he was able to meet Harry’s eye. “Mother says it’s retribution for her years of listening to me talk about you while in school.”
Happy to finally be confessing, Harry told Blaise about the sub from the night before, then complained that he hadn't been able to sleep because of it.
Astrid felt angry on his behalf, she didn't believe anyone should be forced into a marriage. She hated the way marriage was touted as some cure all. Her parents had married too young, and spent years working hard to build a good relationship.
“The night that you were in Malfoy Manor,” the lawyer drawled, “was Lucius Malfoy present in the room?”
Luna smiled brightly, reached forward and squeezed Draco’s hand. After letting go she turned back to Harry and said, "You must go to the emporium on the 14th," she said, buzzing with excitement. "They will have Merlin Falcons for sale!"
That seemed to reassure him. Astrid went to the door, knowing that her Dad wouldn’t pull away until she was safely inside. She rang the bell and waited for barely a breath before the door opened and she was welcomed in by Harry Potter.
Astrid spent the next two days wishing for time to move faster. She begged her parents to let her go to Harry's house on Friday night instead of Saturday morning. Thursday afternoon Dudley text Harry requesting Astrid’s early arrival, she knew that she had a little over 24 hours to kill before she got more answers to her questions. She tried to do some research in preparation but it was starting to feel pointless. There wasn’t any information online about Hogwarts specifically, nor was there any easily located information about what she had heard Draco call the Wizarding World. She was able to link ideas from various fantasy stories together to gather enough information for the ever growing list of questions she was accumulating.
A dry chuckle escapes Draco before he replied, "I wasn't dressed when you knocked, I grabbed the quickest thing and tossed it on."
The look-alike is perfect. He's the right height, just a few centimeters taller than Harry. His white-blonde hair falls elegantly to his shoulders, with half of it pulled off his face. His eyebrow is cocked and there's a tight frown tugging his lips. His arms are folded around a file and
Letting go, Harry glanced at the man's left hand, which was holding a file, and asked, "What is that?"
Draco glanced up at the sweater before turning to give Blaise a playful smile. "You can't reach it?"
Pansy balled her hands into fists and pressed them against her eyes, muttering, "Of all the self sabotaging, idiotic, unbelievably stupid," her rant gave way to a growl of frustration and she threw herself back against the pillows. The room went silent.
"Astoria, this is Harry Potter," Draco said, with another easy smile. Then, motioning to his bride-to-be with a glance at Harry, "and this is Astoria, my fiance."
You will attend a Harry Potter book release party tonight and collect information on the muggles intel regarding the wizarding world. The M.O.M. needs to know how much of a problem this new book is going to cause.
Once it was scheduled, McGonagall, Harry and Draco, all agreed to meet Draco's parents outside of Kingsley's office at 650pm.
Looking back to Pansy with a smile playing on her lips, Hermione said, “Sorry I interrupted. You’re right, of course. However, Harry probably doesn’t even own anything that Malfoy would approve of.” She lifted her eyebrows and blinked slowly.
"My Father, allegedly, set fire to the manor. The charges were dropped," he repeated, giving Astrid a sleepy smile. "I think they could have found the real culprit if it wasn't for the shoddy Auror work," he said, turning fond eyes on Harry, "wouldn't you agree, Dad?"
Scorpius leaned around to watch the girl come up the sidewalk from their car. She was lovely, with long red hair falling past her shoulders onto a teal dress that was cinched at the waist. Scorpius eyed her with obvious appreciation before looking back at the man in front of him with a patented Malfoy smirk. “There’s no way that girl came from your genes,” he said.
Draco glared at her, and Harry laughed. "Well it's going to be hard to do any of that! I hate the thought of being an auror, and I'm kinda in- I want to be with Draco- with, with Malfoy."
Harry is experiencing, addresses Draco with another question. "Do you think I could ask you a few questions afterward? I'd really like to go over a few details."
"Teddy?" James had whispered the name, but it came out loud in the silence of the dark tunnel. He stuffed his hands into his pockets, worried he might overstep and grab Teddy by the waist.
"I know," she said, cutting him off. All of them had given her a separate lecture about the dangers of being in the manor. She wasn't allowed to wander, talk to portraits, or look through any wardrobes. "I'm not going to do anything like that. I promise. I just want to use the loo, and maybe say hello to Hermione Granger," she finished with a sly smile.
Narcissa's blue eyes bore into him and he was sure she was indeed reading his mind. Thoughts of Draco came to the front, flashing through from age eleven until the present. Finally, her cheeks tinged pink, Narcissa blinked and the invasion stopped. "Is it true that Hermione has special control over Rita Skeeter?" she asked.
The room snaps back into focus. His heartbeat is still thundering, but he finds he can breathe again. "Would you like to go to dinner?" he asks, as Draco's fingers grip his hips and push him back against the wall.
"I love it so far," she replied, frowning down at her tea. Affronted, she looked at him and asked, "Is this Chamomile?"
"Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall's voice was like a clear bell in the suffocating silence. She reached into the top drawer of her desk. "Have a biscuit," she said, sliding over a small plate of them. Harry would have laughed if he weren't so terrified. Instead he was busy trying to figure out how to get Draco out of the country.
"I don't know, I guess," he paused, "I guess I never thought about him going on trial. I know he did a lot of shit but, I would have done anything to protect my family from Voldemort. He was basically a hostage at the end."
"No, it's not that, it's- um… It's fine. I'm fine with it," Neville said, then stuffed a spoonful of mashed potatoes into his mouth.
Now, as Draco walked in wearing his bathrobe, Blaise watched Potter's eyes follow him across the room.
Harry's head snapped up so fast his neck twinged in protest. His heart started to pound in his chest.
Kingsley sifted through the papers, setting several pieces of parchment and photographs aside and tapping them with his wand to create copies. When he was finished he looked back to Lucius, "I appreciate you bringing this to me, it will undoubtedly be enough to convict her. I must say something though, for my own integrity, if nothing else. I know you wouldn't be here if she wasn't after your son. You would have done the same Lucius, if not worse, to those Muggle-borns."
Potter was a major benefit. Not Potter himself, necessarily, though it was nice to see The Savior seemed not to hold grudges against any students. Potter had spent Blaise's first night in the room talking to him and Draco -who sat quietly and listened until Potter forced him to talk by persistently pestering him- about Quidditch.
"Wait," Pansy held up a hand to stop Harry from replying. "Am I to understand that we are taking this seriously? That the Savior wants to date Draco?" she asked Hermione.
“Geez Harry,” Dudley said, staring at Scorpius, “mighty smart boy you’ve got here. Most adults can’t keep up with Astrid’s questions when she gets on a roll like that.”
When they entered, Harry was sitting stiffly on the leather loveseat. His fingers were splayed out against his denims as though he was trying not to curl them into fists. He had just asked Dudley about his work. Draco took a seat next to his Husband and Scorpius sat cross legged on the floor. From this point he knew he would have a good view of everyone in the room. Dudley and Astrid were sitting the two chairs across from the loveseat, with the center table between them.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand. When Harry looked at him, the boys eyes were clouded with fear. They both attempted to give weak but supportive smile to each other.
"Fuck," Malfoy repeated, though it was a bit more breathless than the first one. Once the waitress refilled his cup he asked, "Are you sure you've not been obliviated?"
"Sorry," Harry said, shuffling his feet a bit, "I guess I didn't really think of how that sounded. Not every sentence of mine is run through some Slytherin filter."
Hermione just barely touched Pansy’s pinky finger on her right hand. It was so quick that Harry wouldn’t have seen it if he hadn’t been staring at the two of them. At the contact, Pansy stopped talking. Hermione smirked, saying, “Remember that thing I asked Ron to do for you on Saturday night?”
Draco knew talking would only lead to a fight. Without saying anything, he ran a hand through his own hair, letting it fall back into place slowly. He watched Potter’s eyes follow the movement.
Neville spotted him through the glass before Blaise entered. The broad smile on Neville's face gave Blaise pause.
Draco scoffed and lifted up the original letter he'd been reading to show it to Harry, “This one is spelled to change color as you read it Potter. All of the innuendos turn blue and the declaration of love at the bottom turns pink.”
Ron came through the doorway, stopping just short of running into Draco. "Oi! What are you doing in here?"
He glanced back up to find two blond Slytherins staring at him as though he were a fascinating creature they wanted to study.
No one seemed surprised by this, so Astrid assumed it was a regular occurrence as she watched Draco follow the elf over to his parents. She had seen pictures of them at the house, one on the mantle, and two in Pi's room.
“So this is just some long lost family that your Dad decided to contact?” Natalie’s question came casually through the headphones. They were playing Tekken Tag Tournament 2 online, Natalie was far better at the game, and she was currently playing her favorite character, Devil Jin. Astrid tried to focus, tried to get her fingers to move fast enough to block and kick at the same time. She briefly entertained the idea of blaming the character, Asuka Kazama, for her failings, but she’d watched plenty of people kick ass with her on YouTube.
Across from him, Blaise was sitting on the matching couch dressed in what was left of a pearl-grey suit. Harry knew it was pearl-grey because that was the same color of the cabinets he’d chosen for the kitchen in the Burrow. The jacket was slung over an armrest, Blaise wasn’t wearing a tie and had the top two buttons of his shirt loosened, and his sleeves were rolled up to the elbows. Neville sat down beside Blaise, in jeans and a Puddlemore t-shirt, and gathered up the magazines that were scattered across the coffee table that sat between himself and Harry.
"Minister," Lucius replied, his voice sounding far to genuine, "I saw the error in my prejudice long before the death of the Dark Lord."
“Stop terrorizing your Father, Draco,” Narcissa said, still casually reviewing the plans. She looked up at Lucius and Draco, who appeared to be involved in some kind of stare down or holding a conversation through Legilimens, then turned her eyes to Harry.
He sighed, looking towards the heavens for some sort of answer to his life's story. Instead his eyes caught on Luna's sign, 'Pots and Pans', which Ron had gleefully mounted to their outer door frame.
They both stood from the table, Draco backing up with Potter advancing on him. “No,” Draco said, flicking his wrist to cast a wandless trip jinx.
“Are we done with this now? We're square?" Blaise asked. He motioned to Potter who was sitting at the edge of his bed tying up his shoe laces. "What I did to Potter wasn’t even mean. I was only trying to help.”
"Mmm. I think you can manage both," Draco licked his lips and Harry nearly tackled him to the ground right then, fuck the consequences. He tried for a deep breath.
When Draco’s teeth sank into the skin above his hip bone, it was all he could do not to cry out for the sharpness of it, for how close it was to Draco’s mouth on his cock. When Draco put his lips to the head of Harry’s cock and licked the precum, Harry's knees nearly gave way. Draco must have sensed it because his hands came up to grip Harry’s thighs, holding him steady. Without thinking, Harry thrust gently, pleadingly, upward, brushing against Draco’s lips while his hands threaded through that soft blonde hair. When he sank into Draco’s mouth the wet heat was like nothing he’d ever felt, and was only surpassed when Draco’s head started to bob, his cheeks hollowing from the suction.
