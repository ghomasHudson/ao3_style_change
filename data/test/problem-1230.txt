hurt my voice?” he says disbelievingly, his words barely a squeak. He’s almost completely inaudible by now; Draco can’t
Harry groans. “Yeah. Just tired. Ron had me out until after two last night; some fight with Hermione. I didn’t even drink, although he had more than enough for the two of us—I’m just bloody exhausted. What time is it?”
Draco’s whole body is trembling, and he’s gasping for air. “Oh god, oh god,” he whimpers, hand clenching spasmodically over Harry’s hip. “Harry, please, I need—”
Harry responds instantly, moaning into Draco’s mouth and winding his arms around Draco’s waist. They kiss for long minutes, hands roaming over wet skin, until Harry pulls back and rests his head on Draco’s shoulder, heaving in great gasps of air.
“Good,” Draco murmurs, shifting a bit as he watches Harry move about the room and his cock hardens in his trousers. He doesn’t have pants on underneath, and he knows by the end of this there will be a wet spot visible, and he daydreams a little about Harry sucking him off through the fabric.
Ron laughs it off, but by lunch his smile looks fairly fixed, and the lines around his eyes are deepening, so Harry speaks quietly with Robards before hauling the two of them out of the Ministry for an extended lunch.
is a menace. He’s definitely guilty of having a drinking problem, if nothing else. Anything interesting come up on any of the spells?” He pulls his pyjamas off, grimacing at how grotty and sunburned he feels, and selects a new outfit. Thankfully, he and Harry plan to golf poorly enough to be dropped from the last two rounds after today, although they’ll be expected to stay at the hotel and mingle until the end of the tournament in order to avoid suspicion. At least he won’t have to be out in the sun any longer.
The book she’s been slowly making her way through is still on her bedside table, and the stairs are still quiet—no sign of Harry yet—so she picks it up, muffling a yawn with one hand. Maybe she’ll finally get past the part with all the people having a very polite argument in the foyer this time; she has
As Harry straightens automatically upon seeing him, Draco makes a point of checking his large silver wristwatch. “And what time do you call this?” he asks sternly, folding his arms over his chest. On a normal day, he’d have stopped to bring Harry home with him at a slightly more reasonable hour, and they’d have gone out to dinner, and then to bed early, but that’s not what Harry needs today, so even though Draco aches to bundle his husband into his arms and not let him go until he’s sobbed out the cares the world keeps laying on his shoulders, he lets his face fall into the mask he’d perfected as a boy.
Harry reaches the edge first, and he pulls back enough to watch himself come all over Draco’s lower back, gripping Draco’s hips tightly as he fucks forward for a few more thrusts, relishing the too-sensitive feel of wet skin on his spent cock. Draco’s gasping for breath by the time Harry brings his attention back, but it only takes a few more strokes and one particularly harsh pull on one of his piercings until he’s coming all over the shower wall with a howl.
“I’m going to restrain you,” Harry continues in the same soft voice, stepping forward and drawing Draco’s arms back, clicking the cuffs around his wrists. The leather is buttery-soft, and Harry has them just tight enough so that Draco can feel them, but that they won’t leave marks; Draco despises marks the next day that don’t come from Harry’s hands or mouth.
After that, it’s a simple matter of smiling and nodding and rolling his eyes in the right spot, and acting vapid when Travis questions him on his Auror status (Draco’s become excellent at getting people to assume he’s merely skating by on his family’s money and not actually contributing anything to the corps; it drives Harry crazy, but it’s come in handy more than once), and doing his level best to stay somewhat sober despite the multiple refills Travis calls for.
but as soon as Harry says he knows his tone is all wrong, and Draco’s expression smoothes out into blankness, and Harry can’t think of a single thing to say as Draco gets up and walks out of Harry’s office without a single word.
know there’s a Michelin-star chef in charge of the restaurant here, and this is perhaps the most romantic time of year to come to Windermere? You should
Draco blows a slow breath out through his nose and steps back. “Fine. Make it quick. I have places to be tonight.”
Draco’s hands sneak around to the back of Harry’s head, where he grips tight enough to sting Harry’s scalp, holding him in place. He starts speeding up, long fast thrusts all the way down into Harry’s open throat, in and out with no breaks for Harry to gather himself.
Even as he prepares to Apparate, though, he can’t help but wonder what gave him away this morning. Is Harry that familiar with what he sounds like when he’s asleep?
Harry breaks the silent with a wet laugh, drawing back and getting to his feet, turning away to discreetly wipe at his eyes. “You’re far too thin, Draco. You look like you haven’t eaten a proper meal in years. What happened to those elves of yours?”
be picking up her slack in the clean-up department—Harry had put a lot of work into making Grimmauld a sanctuary for himself, and with Kreacher permanently installed at Hogwarts, he had no interest in picking up after his friend.
Harry’s speechless; it’s not often Draco’s able to render him this incoherent, if he’s honest it’s normally the other way around, but right now all Harry seems capable of is hitched breaths and loud, unashamed moans as his hands tug hard on Draco’s hair.
argue, you look terrible—we’re here insanely early, you know that, there’s nothing you need to be doing right now.”
Harry almost swoons in relief when the spells swirl purple over Draco’s head—faint, barely there, but purple nonetheless, not the grey he was dreading. He heals Draco’s wounds and picks him up, both sickened and fascinated by the way Draco’s head lolls back over Harry’s arm, Vanishing the ruined bedsheets and replacing them with a new set before gently settling Draco back against the pillows.
He strokes the words on the parchment, then sends off a request for a muscle-relaxant potion. Normally he doesn’t take them, preferring to allow his body to heal and recuperate naturally, but Harry needs him, and he needs to be at top form.
Harry and Malfoy, she knows what that stupid smile on his face means, and it makes her burn with anger she doesn’t dare express.
Harry rubs at the bridge of his nose. “So does that…” He pauses. This is completely unprofessional, but the way Draco’s watching him now… “When you told me that I was being too needy. That you didn’t want me. That I was stupid to think I was ever more than a trophy you could brag over having. You didn’t mean it?”
“Does it feel alright?” Draco asks softly, tugging down on Harry’s balls and relishing the sharp gasp that earns him.
In addition to letting him work out his grievances on the barbells and cardio machines, the gym offers other distractions.
He’s putting his bag in his locker when the sound of the showers cuts off. Harry glances back, ready to greet whoever’s come out, but— it’s the fit bloke, the one Harry’s never quite managed to work up the courage to talk to.

Malfoy, head bent over a journal, glasses slipping down over his pointy nose, starts. “Harry! I wasn’t expecting you; apologies, did we have a meeting scheduled?”
Draco obligingly slides one finger in, not stopping until it’s all the way in, and crooks it to rub firmly against Harry’s prostate, finding that spot unerringly. “There?”
Harry glances at the bedside clock. “Hm. About thirty minutes. How do you feel? I think I… Well. I took it too far this time, Draco. You almost. I. I thought you were dead. I really…” He notices with an absent sort of surprise that his eyes are stinging with tears. “I thought that was it, this time. That I’d really killed you. We

Draco terrorizes every Department Head on rota; everyone gets a visit twice a month, and it’s obvious who’s due for their bimonthly bollocking by the way the tension on that floor ratchets up and the activity reaches an almost frenetic pace. It never helps, though; there’s always some inconsistency, some little mistake that Draco takes savage glee in pointing out.
The thought is too much, and he shouts and shoves Harry’s face against his groin, pumping his hips hard and deep as he comes down Harry’s throat.

He makes his way up the stairs, picking his way through the shadows, dropping his clothes off in their bedroom before he pads down the hallway to
Harry almost asks, but something in Draco’s voice… There’s a flat resignation there, a surrender to whatever he’s decided fate has in store for him. Harry hates it. Draco should be bright, and mean, and pushy, not...whatever this is.
Draco smiles gently at him. “I know that, too,” he replies, before pulling Harry into a blistering, biting kiss with too many teeth.
Draco pulls back briefly, eyes roaming over Harry’s face. “No,” he says again, smiling. “It’s hardly
When pressure starts to build in his stomach, he forces himself to stop and step back. Harry lets his balls go with a filthy slurp and grins up at him; he knows exactly why Draco needs a break, the brat.
They manage to slip away from the rest once they get back to the manor, and the air between them is nearly crackling with tension as they ascend the stairs.
Harry had started shaking his head halfway through Draco’s words. “No,” he replies, leaning over and spearing one of Draco’s chips with his fork. Draco squawks in protest—Harry hadn’t ordered chips with his dinner,
The Holyhead Harpies’ talent scout and a representative from the affiliate team, the Glyngarth Gorgons, come calling after the New Year, and Harry could not possibly be more thrilled for her. He knows how badly she wants to play professionally, and when she gets an invite to their training camp in the spring, he practically pushes her out the door, beaming with pride. She worries about leaving him alone, but he waves her off with a laugh.
So maybe Draco’s not being entirely fair. He can’t help it; the feel of Potter’s magic sliding over his skin as it retreats is enough to distract him from his often life-or-death critical tasks. Between the constant semi-arousing magic, Potter’s grating cheeriness and insistence on trying to add Draco to his cadre of
“That was so good, Draco,” Harry murmurs, sliding his hand along Draco’s cock. “You always do such a good job with that. You know exactly what to do to take me completely apart. You make me feel
“Oh, shit, Draco, are you alright? Fuck, what happened?” Potter’s voice is concerned, and he’s resting a hand on the nape of Draco’s neck, lightly enough that it doesn’t bother him for once.
sort had been established was obvious; he and Harry compared notes each evening, about who had approached them that day and what they’d said in a coy attempt to instigate a fight.
it’s on purpose, knows it’s to make people associate Draco with Kingsley’s authority—and the worst part of it all is that it
Harry works for another hour, signing off on forms and authorizing requests for consultations and picking at the dinner his secretary left before she took off for the evening. Finally, the silvery paperweight he keeps at the corner of his desk starts buzzing insistently, and he stretches, groaning as his back pops.
Harry’s cock is almost purple, now, and it’s weeping precome again, and Draco takes his time, lapping slowly, worshipfully along the shaft, taking Harry’s balls one at a time into his mouth, tonguing over the head again and again, gathering saliva in his mouth and sinking down until he’s gagging and drooling over Harry’s cock, nose pressed to Harry’s pubic hair.
Draco doesn’t think he has access to the right words, not with the tension that’s been between them for
Harry sighs, pushing back from the table and grabbing the letter, sending his empty plate off to the sink with a glance and a twitch of a finger. Bloody show-off. “I told him that if he finished something in off-hours, he should send it directly to me. It’s important that he gets feedback, you know, positive reinforcement, and that isn’t always—”
Just before she leaves, he mentions something about a probation program, for people who either didn’t commit prosecutable crimes but were still involved, or who were underage when they were pressed into Tom’s service. She’s not so sure how she feels about it, but Harry seems to think that it’s worthwhile, that some of the people they’ll be working with deserve a second chance.
Finally, they reach the largest study, up on the second floor, and Draco has to stop and take a deep breath before entering the room. Potter hadn’t detected anything dangerous inside, but the stone is off-kilter with all its curses being systematically removed, and it’s enough to make Draco nauseated even behind his shields.
Obligingly, Draco kisses just under Harry’s jaw, then sucks over his tendon, scraping his teeth over the sensitive skin. His hands are roaming under Harry’s shirt now, warming with every stroke over his back.
Harry’s breathing hard again as Draco comes back to himself, and Draco can see the trembling in his muscles—he’s holding himself very still, likely in an effort to keep himself from spelling the cock ring off and taking himself in hand.
A muffled whisper against Harry’s shoulder, and Draco’s fingers are slick, gliding down his spine and circling his hole. “Like that?” Draco says, swirling slowly, pressing lightly but not all the way in.
Things are getting heated, and Potter’s thrusting against him, and Draco’s starting to wonder if he’s going to come in his pants like he’s back in Hogwarts again, when an alarm starts blaring, and they spring apart.
She doesn’t ask. She doesn’t bring it up. Harry knows that she knows about it—how could he not, with all the bloody copies of the paper floating around—but he doesn’t say anything, either.
“Fuck—” he sighs, dropping his head into his hands. The clock Hermione perma-spelled to his wall (he kept knocking it down when he bounced balls off the wall)
Sighing the sigh of a man much put-upon, Ron hauls himself to his feet, shoots Harry one last anguished glance, and squares his shoulders before striding over to Hermione and planting a kiss on her mouth. “I’ll see you two on the other side,” he mutters, flushing red and practically running out of the room.
Not for the first time, Draco sneaks a glance at his partner, who’s animatedly chatting with the concierge as he checks them in, and wonders.
I’ll gladly fuck off—you’re aware the Portkey leaves in five minutes, yes?” Draco fretfully pats over his pockets, ensuring his wand and Shrunken travel bags are all present and accounted for. It wouldn’t do for him to have left something behind after riding Harry so hard.
Harry winces, but Ron leans back in his chair, apparently still relaxed. “‘Fraid not. Not just my story to tell, you know? It wouldn’t be right. I didn’t know Liaisons had the horn for Malfoy that badly, though—if it makes them feel better, you can probably tell them he likes women too.”
He starts to slide down Harry’s torso, stopping to bite at his nipples until Harry’s near tears at how good it feels, then finally licking his way down until he’s got his face buried in the trimmed patch of hair just over Harry’s cock.
Malfoy keeps his word, but when Harry sees the sheer length of the list waiting for him when he drags himself to his office at the end of his shift, he almost misses the bloody flying memos.
“Don’t mind him, we’ll talk about that later. So, tell me, was it anything like in the book with the Aurors, you know, the one where…”
Harry’s leaning against the shower door, and his shoulders and arse are pressed against the glass, and Draco
She leans up and kisses him, slow and deep, and he sighs against her and pulls her closer. They stay like that for a minute, until finally Ginny pushes him back. “Don’t take too long,” she says, winking and waggling her eyebrows at him until he laughs.
He focuses when he hears Harry’s footsteps, and barely stops himself from jerking an arm (the way Harry’s silvery magic has him bound, it would
Harry opens the door and sticks his head out. “What’s going on out here??” he bellows, catching Christopher’s eye through the chaos. “Didn’t I send you home?”
Draco drops by Harry’s office before Harry even makes it in for the day and, through the judicious application of expensive pastry and flattery, is able to convince his secretary to reschedule Harry’s second-to-last meeting for the day, a full forty-five minutes on his schedule, and not say anything about it.
to take that one last, irrevocable step and make Draco a part of him, permanently. Harry has to hold himself back every time they do this, has to pull away far sooner than he wants and heal Draco quickly before his instincts take over and he does something he can’t undo.
“Oh,” Draco breathes, eyes flickering over his face. “You’ve finally figured it out, then.” Before Harry can ask him what he means, Draco arches his back, deliberately, and rubs his arse against Harry’s cock.
“Just—” she says, putting her hands up. “Just. I’m tired, alright, it’s been a long—a long day, a long week, whatever you like, just— Can we drop it? I don’t want to deal with this right now. I don’t want to think about it. I don’t like it, and you don’t
Harry’s nostrils are flaring now as he struggles to take in enough air, and his eyelashes are fluttering. His face is a mess; blotchy and covered in spit and precome and—is that…?
“Aw, c’mon, Malfoy—just a peek? Are you doing another one about the Cursebreaker and the Unspeakable? That all looks Latin—it’s gotta be, right? What’s the title of that…
when he first saw Draco’s bathroom) that he insists are the only things that work properly for him. Even when they were trainees, he’d used Cleaning Charms or Apparated home after practical sessions.
“Great!” Potter says, crossing to peer into the refrigerator. “Wow, Malfoy, this looks perfect, actually. It’s the exact right texture and consistency. Did you use milk chocolate?”
“You love it,” Draco says, confident and assured in a way that he never was about the way Harry feels for him at the start of the relationship.
” Harry swears from above him, and Draco gives a pleased little hum when Harry’s hands dig into his hair.
“Draco, there you are! Yeah, he said the initial sweep showed a lot of those fiddly little locking spells and he wanted me on hand just in case—
He starts to say something, eyes snapping with mirth, but Draco checks the clock above the refrigerator and sucks in a breath. “Bloody hell, Potter, if we don’t get a move on we are going to be
Gwenog is talking about moving her up to the top line. Ginny spends a lot more time at practice, working on her shot and her sharp turns. When it gets late, she starts crashing with a teammate instead of coming home.
“Ah, shit,” he breathes as he fits his fingers as far around Harry’s girth as he can. “Next time, I want this inside me. I want to pin you down against the couch and ride you until your eyes roll back into your head. I want to get on my knees and shove this so far down my throat I can’t talk for days after. I want to fuck you into the headboard and then eat your arse clean, then do it all over again. Can I, Harry? Would you let me?”
“Oh,” Ron says casually, plopping into the chair opposite and grabbing a pastry. “Just Malfoy. I’m sorry, I didn’t know you’d be cooking—he made brunch, I’m stuffed.” In direct contradiction to his words, Ron’s already eaten half the pastry.
that I’m complaining,” he adds hastily, when Harry makes a fake-disgruntled noise and pretends like he’s going to leave, moving his hands to the back of the couch to push himself free.
Finally, Harry’s run out of tasks, and he’s sure that by now Draco’s long since cleared out, so he packs up and heads to Third Space.
” Draco gasps, staring down at that dark head bobbing over his dick. Potter’s mouth is hot, and his throat is
Draco closes his eyes and sits back. His face is drawn, haggard with lines that weren’t there just a few years back. “So I did it to myself, yet again,” he says hollowly.
Their mouths crash together, but Potter gentles the kiss almost immediately, and he sets a steady rocking rhythm against Draco, and between the friction on his cock and Harry’s tongue in his mouth and their magic dancing together, Draco feels like he’s going to pass out.
Draco turns and catches Harry’s eye, and he hastily looks away in an effort to look like less of a sex pest. He hastily snatches his preferred shampoo (he can’t get anyone to tell him where they purchase it, but it’s the only thing that leaves his curls feeling soft and actually looking nice when they dry, instead of frizzy and dried-out) and sends the rest back to the shelves, then squeezes some into his palm.
Ginny looks at Malfoy. He’s watching her carefully, expression smooth and blank, but he’s got an arm snaked around Harry’s waist, pressing them together.
Harry wanders over to join him, waggling two key cards and grinning. “All checked in. Malfoy, you splashed out for the
or were you planning on gloating, and making fun of me, and depriving Teddy of a cake for his birthday?”
as each thread vibrates under Potter’s touch, and it sets his teeth on edge and sends goosebumps rushing all over his skin. A tendril of Potter’s magic snakes away from the door, back to where Draco is standing; he slaps it away as it attempts to twine with his own magic.
He abuses Harry’s nipples until Harry’s voice is hoarse from crying out and chanting apologies. There have been nights where this was enough, this was all it took to get the word out and send Harry to a sweet, peaceful sleep, but it’s not going to be tonight, so Draco steps back and rips Harry’s shirt apart from the collar, leaving Harry slumping forward into the wall and shivering at the sudden chill.
Harry floats a fat, deep gold candle closer, setting it hovering off to Draco’s left side a couple feet above him while Harry moves around to Draco’s right and runs his hands down Draco’s body.
“What— What do you want? What do you need? I can—tell me what I can do,” Draco says breathlessly, inching his hands down under Harry’s trousers, fingers cold on skin.
Bill does his best to not laugh at them, but a few chuckles slip out when Potter has to throw his arms around Draco’s neck when he tries to get up from his chair, forcing Draco to pull Potter’s torso up against his to keep them both from tumbling over. Draco shoots him a venomous glare, but Bill only winks at him and shoos them to St Mungo’s.
When he’s feeling particularly guilty, he tells himself that the extra perks written into his contract—the luxury flat, the outsized team stock share, the handsome assistants, all of it—only begin to scratch the surface of making up for having to deal with

else was a waste. Eating, sleeping...all of it could be pushed aside with the right potions. And then, once the fog cleared and I realized what had happened, it was like...I couldn’t see past this horrible thing I’d done for long enough to see the point in taking care of myself any longer. I don’t blame you for being...well. I’m not looking my best, let’s just put it that way.”
Draco brings his legs together, trapping Harry’s cock between his thighs and rubbing gently. He knows just how soft these trousers are—he’d certainly paid enough for it—but on Harry’s hard, sensitive cock the tiniest breaks in the threading will scrape in a maddeningly painful, arousing way. Harry shivers, but stills almost immediately, and Draco kisses one of his cheeks in reward.
Draco sits back and takes himself in hand, but Harry crouches down and bats his hand away, diving in and kissing Draco so thoroughly his head spins. Harry’s hand over his cock is fast and brutal, the water not doing nearly enough to relieve the almost burning friction, but Draco’s so on edge it doesn’t matter, and soon he’s sobbing into Harry’s mouth as he arches his back and comes all over Harry’s fist.
. Draco doesn’t ever deny it, just examines his nails in smug silence, and secretly, Harry’s impressed at how many new ways of playing dirty Draco’s able to come up with.
“So,” he says hesitantly, propping himself up and meeting Draco’s blurry gaze. “Do you. Did you. I mean. What do you…”
Draco tosses the rent shirt to the side—Harry will spell it back together in the morning, probably with plenty of grumbling, Draco knows it’s one of his favorites—then sits back down on the couch, back straight, knees just a few inches apart, hands calmly resting at his sides.
By the time she feels ready to read the papers again, Harry and Malfoy out to dinner together makes the front page.
He rocks impatiently on his heels as he waits for Potter to answer, mind racing as he reviews and discards various introductions to his current dilemma. He’s so engrossed in figuring out what to say that Potter’s called his name three times before he blinks back to the present.
Once he gets the wardstone off the property, it’s the work of just a few minutes to crush it down to nothingness, and as he steps back into the house he’s finally able to drop his shields; as he expected, all the wonky Dark magic is gone, and all that’s left is the residual magic of the McKilips and their charmingly precocious toddler. He’s breathing much easier as he makes it back to the second-floor study, and he finds Potter still obediently sitting on the floor.
Years of familiarity breeds a level of casualness, of assumptions to one another’s time and space, and they’ve both become accustomed to walking into whatever room the other is in without announcing themselves, provided they know they’re alone.
“Yeah, yeah,” Potter mutters, sitting on the floor and hugging his knees. “Go on, then. Fuck, Bill’s going to absolutely
“Oh, Ron, thank you. The study tables are just down this aisle here—can you put them on the biggest table still open? Harry, you too, but then I’ll need one of you to come back and help—I still have some more that I need to track down, and I’ll need someone taller.” Hermione peers hopefully in Ron’s direction.
Harry’s kneeling in the middle of their bedroom, and Draco’s just finished binding him up in silken rope, and the sunset lancing in through their window has set him glowing. “So what are you going to do about it?” Harry replies, a laugh under his words, eyes dancing. “If you’re just going to stare at me all night, I’m afraid I’ll have to spell myself free and take care of
“I know,” Draco says smugly, turning the lights back up and tossing Harry a dressing gown. “Now get that fine arse down to the kitchen. I think you owe
Harry is kneeling at his feet, head bowed, shoulders up to his ears. “I’m sorry,” he whispers, almost too quietly to be heard.
Draco’s face is pale, paler than normal—he’s almost chalk-white, and his lips are going blue, and the four puncture wounds in his neck are pumping blood still, but slowly, sluggishly, the thin streams at odds with the pool of blood spreading through the bedsheets and over Draco’s fine white silk shirt.
know. And still, all I can do when I see his name is assume the worst. I’m supposed to be better than that, now.”
Harry’s eyes feel like they’re about to fall out of their sockets. “You gave it a…? So wait, does that mean…? No, don’t tell me! Don’t tell me anything at all!” He’s suddenly assaulted with a rush of images, of Malfoy and
Harry laughs without humour. “All those brains and you’re a real first-class idiot, aren’t you? What, were you going to do this

live alone, therefore my house is the logical option. Plus—” and here he smirks, and Harry’s heart rate speeds up—no good can come from
He drifts for a bit, lulled by the repetitive motion of Draco’s hands in his hair, and jolts a bit when Draco speaks again. “You don’t suck, you know. You’re not nearly as bad as Games. You just have a little trouble remembering the deadlines.”
“Ron, no!” Harry cries, turning back around and grabbing for his wand, but it’s too late—a flash of silver magic throws him back as Ron’s words mix with the heavy ambient magic in the library and trigger—
“Oh,” Harry says, feeling a rush of sympathy. “So it was all bollocks, then, everything he said about… I mean, the bond required you to reach completion once? It must have been awful, I’m so sorry.”
“Well, that’s why I’ve asked you in,” Harry says carefully, pushing his files about on his desk to give his hands something to do. “It’s true that there are certain…
Harry smiles at the back of Draco’s head as they pile into the empty lift. Draco’s so predictable; it soothes Harry, if he’s being honest. Every day, he knows exactly what to expect when he gets to their shared office (generally a few minutes late, but he does his best)—Draco’s outer robe hanging neatly from the coat rack, a coffee under stasis on Harry’s desk, and all his unfinished memos from the previous day sorted and ready for his attention.
Scrubbing his hand over his face, Draco snatches the cookbook and beats a tactical retreat into the sitting room to read the recipe again. It’s mid morning, and Teddy’s party is in six hours, and he’s
He sits back on his knees and tilts his head to examine what he’s done, pleased with the view. Harry’s cock, by now fully hard, has a deep navy band at the base, and a second ring around his bollocks. “Gorgeous,” he murmurs, and with a wave of his hand cleans off the lube, then takes it to the back of his throat with no preamble.
He rubs his cock over Harry’s face again, breath shortening as Harry’s tongue darts out to lick over the shaft whenever he can.
He flops face-first onto the bed next to Harry, who directs cleaning spells over both of them. They catch their breath in silence for a while, then Draco props himself up and smirks down at Harry. “Well?”
When Harry gets home, he looks surprised to see Draco dressed down in comfortable loungewear, but he dutifully trudges upstairs to change, then sinks into his chair and gratefully takes his drink when he comes back down.
rattle off pertinent details of every one of his companies if pressed), and he’s attending a charity golf event this weekend, and Harry and Draco are the only two Aurors who might plausibly be attending in their free time.
Harry’s response is muffled, but the mockery is crystal clear. “The Lord of the Manor, returned to his ancestral property. Why would you have sold it off?”
Letting loose a breath he wasn’t aware he was holding, Draco moans long and loud as Harry pushes in, feeling the wax on his legs start to crack off and fall to his stomach.
Draco nearly bites through his own lip as he comes with a strangled shout, slumping back against the wall and breathing harshly. His heart is thundering in his chest, and his vision is sparking black around the edges.
Reaching around, Draco gropes over Harry’s trousers before undoing the fly and pushing them to Harry’s ankles, then drops to his knees and kneads at Harry’s arse.
“Are you sure, Harry?” Draco coos, slowly pulling the toy out. “I’m bigger than this. Are you sure you can take me?”
” Draco says scornfully, shaking Harry back to the present. “That was a pretty little speech, but forgive me for not believing a word of it. You should know that things tend to not go very well for people who threaten me, these days.”
from Draco’s plate—but Harry winks at him and tops off his wine, so Draco settles back into his chair, grumbling.
Hermione’s hand covers his own, stilling his fingers from their nervous tapping. “You can’t blame yourself for this,” she says firmly. “After all, you wouldn’t blame
Ears ringing and eyes burning, Harry climbs back to his feet and rushes over to where Ron and Malfoy are supine on their backs. “
to be stinging against the fabric, but he’s so hot and wanton in Draco’s arms that he’s clearly enjoying it.
When he finally steps through the front door that evening (and if he rushed the cleanup and maybe left a few things in stasis he’d normally finish before the weekend, well, there’s nobody to scold him but himself, and he can always open late on Monday), he discovers that Harry’s lined the entryway and the staircase up to their room with dainty tealights, in alternating silver and gold, with their tiny flames spelled to match. He smiles as he puts away his cloak and bag and shoves his shoes between their Quidditch boots in the closet—his man has been planning ahead, and nothing on this earth makes Draco feel more special than knowing how much time Harry’s spent thinking about ways to please him.
Draco retreats back into his meditation when this happens, so he’s not sure exactly how much time passes before he’s blinking back to himself at the tug of Harry’s hand on his trouser leg.
He bites hard on one cheek, silently thanking Jenny for her foresight as Harry yelps loudly, then smacks his hands down on the desk. Without further preamble, he spreads Harry’s cheeks and dives in, licking around Harry’s hole until he’s whimpering and thrashing and begging.
Ginny doesn’t think Harry’s doing it intentionally, but the house is his, and it can tell he’s upset with her—they’d both apologised, but he’s still distant, barely even asking after her day any more let alone sharing details of his own, and he’s spending more and more time out of the house, or crouched at the Floo talking with Hermione under a shroud of privacy charms, and the house is responding.
“I’m sure I can think of a few,” Harry says, transfixed by Draco’s eyes, but just as he’s leaning down to press their mouths together, a burst of sound from out in the bullpen sends him flying back to his feet. “Wait here,” he instructs Draco, who sits up straight and clutches the chair arms, knuckles turning white.
the same as golfing while listening to a suspect’s conversation and maintaining the bored Pureblood scion mask he’d perfected so many years ago.
you to be careful in here, everything is so terribly old and there’s so much magic, it takes hardly anything to set them off…”
Harry chuckles beside him as they make their way up to the entrance. “Truly, your sacrificing nature is an example to us all. Really, though, this place is fantastic; it looks like something out of a novel.”
As he rounds the track the last time, Draco puts on a burst of speed, and Harry applauds sarcastically as he comes to a stop. Draco glares at him while he stretches a bit, but soon they’re taking their places on either side of the dueling field, circling each other with their wands out.
“Come lie down,” Harry says coaxingly; as if he thinks Draco needs to be gentled, to be talked into this, to be soothed.
bloody Oslo, are we? Use the damn British standard notations!’), and on and on until the Mediwix know to scatter whenever Malfoy appears on their floor, and Harry’s given a wide berth whenever their latest shouting match ends in Malfoy stomping back off to his own damn ward.
Potter tilts his head, but shrugs. It’s warm out today despite how late in autumn it is, and Potter’s shirt is plastered to his torso. Draco very carefully does not look below Potter’s eyes. “Can I change first? Only, those chairs in your office are so
He squeezes hard, and Harry groans again. “Do you like that?” Draco asks, nipping down Harry’s neck. “You have no idea how hard seeing you the other morning made me.” He nudges his hips forward until their cocks are lined up and thrusts a few times, until they both are moaning at the friction. “You’re so gorgeous, Harry. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.”
Potter pants against Draco’s neck as they recover, and Draco finds that he doesn’t want to let Potter go, even though his come is cooling sticky in his pyjamas.
would have been nasty—and we’re clear.” He steps into the house, finally pulling his wand out and holding it in his left hand—
“Here I am, was in the ladies’ and stopped to order some wine at the bar—that beer you ordered me was ghastly, Ron. Hi, Harry, glad you could make it, long day?” Hermione nudges Ron further towards the wall so she can sit down next to him.
Draco lifts the duvet and inspects the sheets, ignoring Harry’s audible huff of irritation. It doesn’t matter how many times Harry’s done this successfully; all it took was
Ginny’s schedule is punishing as they near the finals, and Harry’s spending more and more time out of the house. It was technically Ginny’s turn to get the dishes done, but she’d been absolutely shattered when she got home that night, and she’d done them twice in a row the week before as a favour to Harry (not that he’d said anything, or even noticed at all), and she just...didn’t want to.
“Hey!” Harry interjects; only half-heartedly, though, because really, Malfoy’s not wrong. Harry just has terrible luck, though; he never
it, is the thing. It was meant to insult, meant to sting Harry into lashing out so she could keep screaming at him until they got all of this nastiness out of their systems and could work through whatever’s going wrong between them, but instead Harry’s face goes white, and he says nothing at all, and Ginny suddenly feels unmoored, as if she’s going to fall down if she doesn’t grab hold of something.
“Ahh,” Harry groans, sitting up and swinging his legs over the side of the bed. He crosses one ankle over his knee and fiddles distractedly with his sleeve, doing up one of the buttons at his wrist that had come loose during his recent
move, you know protocol—and you’ve already cleared a path, I’ll be fine. Stay here,” he orders, pinning Potter with a glare as soon as he’s turned back around, one eye still on the wardstone.
Harry slips out and retrieves several vials of Blood-Replenishing potion, returning just in time to hear a quiet whine slip from Draco’s lips as he starts to stir.
Harry easily brushes off the praise of the public, accepting the swoons and the sighs and the constant eyes whenever he goes anywhere, but dismissing them as soon as he moves past the giver. He’s gracious, and sincere, and thinks every stranger who compliments his looks is full of shit.
Draco glances at his watch, then wanders to the window to peer out. “Only half four. Take a nap if you’d like; there’s plenty of time before dinner, and all we have left to do here is get the spells out into the gardens and any outdoor seating areas, which we really should do tomorrow when it’s not about to get dark. We can do the golf course tomorrow as well, and then that’s it until the tournament starts and Browne-Heathcote shows up.” He frowns a bit as he stares out over the gardens and fells. “You know...there’s a painting at the Manor that I would swear has this exact view. I wonder if we used to own this?”
The next weekend, Harry’s got Draco bound all up in his magic and dangling from the ceiling, and Draco’s having trouble keeping his eyes open as Harry watches him from across the room. He’s set a vibrator to float in midair, pressing against the skin just behind Draco’s balls, and Draco’s aware he’s making high, whimpery noises as his cock twitches and dribbles precome, but he can’t bring himself to care. It feels so
Hermione sighs while Ron muffles a laugh into his glass. “Well, it’s only, Pansy never said anything to me about him coming back—I thought he was pretty well-established and happy in Oslo?”
“Hey!” Harry shouts, finally getting his feet back in gear. He charges out of the shower area, barely stopping to grab his own towel. “Feelings? You
He sits down on the couch opposite her, and they’re quiet for a long while. Ginny wonders if this is what shock feels like.
Harry is telling the truth about this library being intensely disturbing—he always feels like there are eyes on the back of his neck, but whenever he turns around nothing's there. However, he mostly doesn’t want to instigate another disagreement that will lead to weeks of muttered resentment whenever he and Ron get together.
Harry shakes his head fondly and crosses to his private Floo, which is warded to the teeth and only allows travel one way, from his office to his home. “No, she has not. Which means we’d best get going; she’ll be in to check on us any minute.” He throws powder into the flames. “I’m still at Grimmauld; you’re...you’re still keyed into the wards, so you should arrive in my study. We can go from there to the Manor.”
Malfoy purses his lips and leans back in his chair. Annoyingly, he looks good—better than Harry, frazzled and exhausted, probably does right now—clothes perfectly neat, hair loose and swept over his forehead, forearms strong where he’s got them crossed in front of him, sleeves rolled up.
so, Potter,” Draco snaps, striding to a couch pushed up against a wall and Levitating it out of the way. “Charming as always, I see. It’s under the floorboard over here; don’t come closer, I need to focus. Just be ready with a Stasis once I get it out.”
“Shit, I’m so sorry, are you…” Harry trails off when they make eye contact. “Gin, hi. Are you okay? Sorry, I didn’t see you.” He’s got a bag clutched in front him like a shield.
Harry groans and barely stops himself from banging his head on the table. “I can’t stop thinking that if I’d done something when he sent me that first letter, none of this would be happening,” he admits. “If I had just gone over and
Harry works him through it until Draco pulls his fingers out and shoves Harry’s hand away, hissing and oversensitive.
But then, the nightmares came back after a few months of freedom, and he woke up screaming more often than he didn’t, and the rugged lines of his jaw and cheekbones became angular, then skeletal as he stopped sleeping, stopped eating, stopped

) is Ron’s unwillingness to actually admit there had been a problem in the first place, and that all of this has been some great favour he’s bestowed upon her.
Potter swallows around his cock once, twice more, then pulls back, wipes his mouth, and stands, undoing his jeans and shoving them and his pants down to mid-thigh. “Merlin, you smell so
Andromeda eyes them suspiciously; Draco had done his best to spell them both to neatness, but he’s still flushed and blotchy around his neck, and Harry’s lips are swollen. She doesn’t say anything, though, just raises a devastating eyebrow before taking the cake and spelling it ahead of her into the kitchen.
gets this done. Are you telling me you didn’t? My, how terribly middle-class of you. I thought you had more of a sense of refinement these days, after all that research you did into your father’s family.”
. Harry winces, and Malfoy closes his eyes as if he’s in pain. “Oi, Malfoy, didn’t expect to see you here! Bit of an odd library choice for some peace, innit, it’s right disturbing in here—hey, what
you’re so good, it feels so good, don’t stop, Draco, Draco—” His thighs tremble and he shoves forward just enough to get a little friction on his cock against Draco’s stomach. His dick is drooling precome between them and he’s so hard, so sensitive that it’s only going to take just—a little—
“We’re not out of the woods yet,” Hermione cautions. “What Draco’s managed to do...it’s remarkable, unprecedented. It’s going to take the full force of my team to figure it out and reverse what he’s created. And we’ll need
Harry’s hand covers his, and Draco stills. “Fears aren’t always rational in how they manifest,” he says quietly, and Draco closes his eyes briefly, letting himself be soothed. “You know I get about the woods. Remember how I almost ruined Beltane last year? It isn’t your
“I know that you’re worried about it,” Draco says, stroking down along Harry’s back. “But I trust you, Harry—you’ve always been able to stop yourself before, and you
He considers opening his eyes, taking a glance down his body to see what exactly he looks like, but decides he doesn’t want to see. The feeling is enough for him, and anyway, his body belongs to Harry when they’re doing this—Harry decides who gets to see it.

She sinks into the closest chair, staring at Harry, who’s staring down at his hands. “Are you...” she starts, but she doesn’t know how to finish that sentence—she knows the words, but can’t make herself say them.
Some days she feels fine. Some days she hurts so badly all she wants to do is cry. Some days she wants to Apparate back to Grimmauld and scream until Harry’s skin peels off and he’s begging for forgiveness.
She spends some time arranging herself on the bedspread, but that’s too cold, so—well, if Harry wanted a show, he’d have finished his work up sooner, she thinks crossly as she puts on her pyjamas and slips under the covers.
” Draco pulls him upright, tugging and rearranging him until Harry’s straddling his lap, thighs on either side of Draco’s hips.
Ron stuffs the rest of the pastry in his mouth and swallows. “Oh, no worries on that score, mate. We actually gave it a second go, just to be sure. So you see, I’m just a little knackered from being up late, that’s all. Nothing dubious.”
likes men and everyone thinks he doesn’t pull, and...I know I’ve been guilty of talking like that in the past, but it’s horrible really, and unfair. Malfoy was no fonder of me than I was of him, right? It’s not right to joke that just because he’s gay he’ll shag anything on offer. And really, he couldn’t have been more decent about the whole thing, considering if there
Hermione sits back, looking satisfied. “Yes, that proves my point nicely, I think. No, don’t worry about it, you’ll figure it out eventually.” Her expression loses its brightness, then, and her lower lip trembles. “Oh, do you think Ron will be alright? Malfoy didn’t seem
It had started innocently enough a few years ago, when they began running into each other at Andromeda’s and decided that it would be easier to just
Draco wakes at his usual time the next day and immediately gropes for the second vial. He swallows it with a groan and lies perfectly still until it’s kicked in, then sits up gingerly and Summons a glass, filling it with water two separate times before he feels all the way back to normal.
“So…” Harry starts hesitantly, once their starters are delivered and Ron is halfway through his second pint. “Are you doing alright? You seemed fine yesterday, but…” When Harry had arrived home from his head-clearing alone time at the Ministry (where he had spoken very firmly to himself about letting his imagination run wild about
you,” he murmurs, then rears back up, gripping Harry’s hips tight enough to bruise as he thrusts the rest of the way in.
Finally, he walks to the desk to grab his sunglasses, glancing at the note, but just as he’s about to turn and walk out the room he freezes and looks back down at it.
Draco groans deep in his throat and falls forward, planting his hands on either side of Harry’s head and kissing him. Harry can taste himself on Draco’s tongue, and that’s far more erotic than he thought it would be, and he adds a bit of a twist to his motion, along with a rub over the head of Draco’s cock on every other stroke, and it’s not long before Draco’s coming too, all over Harry’s stomach and chest.
Draco must be silent for a moment too long, because the light in Potter’s eyes dims a bit, and he starts to pull himself up, and
Browne-Heathcote is out on the terrace, drinking already (as are most of the people in the room, to be honest), laughing loudly with two men that Draco vaguely recognises from the board at Mungo’s. He files their faces away to examine via Pensieve later; it’s not worth trying to place their names now, not unless Browne-Heathcote spends more time with them.
“—so you’ll help me figure it out, right? Like you helped Ron? Ron’s the straightest bloke I know, and if you’re able to get

supposed to look at him like that, especially not on a case, but then Harry shakes his head slightly and cuffs Draco roughly in the shoulder and shouts something about him needing to hurry so the caddies can get them all back.
at this location, and I’m not letting the Ministry’s tightfistedness affect the quality of our work. And also—” He pauses as the Portkey activates and they whirl their way through to the Lake District, grabbing Harry by the bicep and steadying him as they land. “—I’m paying for this myself. The Ministry won’t see an invoice for a Knut over our allotted budget, I swear it.”
like men. As far as what to do next…” and Malfoy smirks, the same one Harry saw in his office before the whole incident with Ron, and now he recognises his reaction for what it is, and good lord, does Malfoy acting like a smug little prat turn him on? “...well, there’s a whole world of possibilities. Where did you want to start? It’s my
Nope. He shuts that entire train of thought down firmly, then stands. “Well. All’s well that ends well, then, so thrilled you’re just fine. I just remembered I have to, er, pop over to the Ministry, some paperwork I forgot...I’ll see you both later?” He hastens to the fireplace, and as he tosses the Floo powder in and calls out for the private connection to his office, he hears Hermione pick up the conversation.
The ward rooms—down a few floors and sideways from the DMLE, and only accessible with an Auror badge—are empty when they arrive. The trainees are out on a field exercise, and it’s late enough after lunch and too long until the end of the day for anyone else to be getting a session in.
he’d think we missed something. Come on, do you want to head down to the ward rooms? I’m feeling antsy after all that.”
He’s always been about forgiveness. She hasn’t. But Ginny supposes it doesn’t have anything to do with her, not really.
Harry’s arm is moving faster now, and his head thunks back against the glass, and Draco holds his breath and strains his ears and knows exactly when he comes, hears the punched-out little sigh Harry bites out and sees his shoulders slump and the tight muscles in his back unlock.
thing? You’ve been moaning about having to turf your emergency psych patients to that floor for months now!”
He’s not sure he could describe how it feels if he were asked, and he’s glad that Harry’s not demanding that of him for this; all he knows is that the patterns slowly looping over his body are lulling him better than any attempt at hypnosis, any Divination class in that small, stuffy, overperfumed tower room. He’s slipping down fast, faster than normal, and part of him wonders at that, that the thing he’s been frightened of for so long is bringing him peace so swiftly, but he’s too blissed-out to really consider it for too long.
Potter’s close, that much is clear by his panting breaths and the flush rising on his face, and when Draco puts his mouth next to Potter’s ear and whispers “I can’t wait to feel this inside me,” he comes so hard he staggers on his feet and almost falls.

He’s so exhausted when they get home on those days that Ginny’s started suggesting they have friends over, instead, and that helps—fills the house with light and warmth and laughter for a few hours, chases away the dark corners that still gather despite their best efforts.
“You lied to me,” Harry says, brain working furiously to wrap his mind around everything Malfoy said. “For months, you were lying to me every time you didn’t tell me you’d charmed your appearance. If I hadn’t figured it out, would you
“I know, I can feel it. You know, I never can sense what you’re talking about, with the magic...except when mine touches yours. I don’t know why, but whenever I get within a few feet of you and I get distracted enough that it does its own thing, I can tell whenever it’s reaching out for yours. You
Harry glances down; the black-and-red snake he got a few weeks after Ginny went in for her piercings is curled around his upper thigh, like usual, and he strokes it briefly to set it squirming and crawling along his leg. “Yeah. Got it as an eighteenth birthday present to myself. I forgot you wouldn’t have known about it.”

.” His voice is scathing; he can’t help it. “Whatever we’ve got, I likely won’t find out until he dies and I inherit the ledgers. So, really, any day now if I’m lucky.”
“That would be lovely,” Draco says, reaching up to touch his numb, swollen lips. “Far right cabinet.”
The alarm goes off with a twiddle of Potter’s fingers, and they look at each other for another minute before they both start laughing.

There’s a roaring in Harry’s ears as he slowly steps back, absently rinsing himself in the stream of Draco’s showerhead. He feels incredible, but—oh, Merlin, what did he just
Draco’s a deep sleeper, normally; it’s why he didn’t mind taking the bed under the window, as light and sound don’t normally disturb him. He wakes at the exact same time every day, no alarm necessary, and once he falls asleep he’s out until his internal clock brings him back.

. Draco’s grateful he already checked that he had no morning responsibilities tomorrow outside of finishing up his reports from today’s hit. “Are you going to pick that up?”
Well. Maybe snobby, too. And still pointy, sometimes, if Harry’s being honest, but not nearly as much as he was as a child.
Potter looks up, and his smile is blinding. Draco’s back teeth grind together. He thinks he must look manic by now, but Potter doesn’t seem to notice.
Sighing, Harry flags down a waiter and orders another two pints. He can already tell this lunch break is going to stretch longer than the hour he normally takes. “Yeah. Draco’s coming in this afternoon.”
He rushes to undress and select his spot first; the Ministry showers are utilitarian, and while they do provide a variety of products, there are no individual stalls, just two rows of showerheads along opposite walls. Naturally, they have features Muggle showers never would, but the utter lack of anything remotely resembling privacy had been...jarring, at first. Harry’s used to it now, but not with

Harry signs one of the rooms out, watching as the registration memo flutters up through the ceiling, then he slips into the room after Draco, who’s already stripping out of his Auror garb and Transfiguring his stuffy shirt and trousers into something more appropriate to exercise in. Harry does the same, smiling to himself when Draco huffs at the way he’d thrown his robe off to the side and folds it neatly.

gets Draco’s eyes flashing quicksilver-fast up to meet his, just for a moment. “I want to make it clear that this is not a mandatory interview; you are not currently under active suspicion for the case I’m working on. In that light, I do appreciate your time today, as well as any help you can provide the Aurors.”
One of Draco’s hands flutters around to Harry’s throat, where he presses down lightly, just enough to feel his cock when he thrusts in. It’s not the right angle for it, but if he had Harry flat on his back and was fucking his mouth from on top of him, he’d be able to see the bulge he’s making.

Draco’s quiet for a minute, tracing over a bright red spiral on his upper thigh. It stings, and his skin prickles.
Now it’s Hermione’s turn to raise one shoulder. “Blind luck?” she offers wryly, and Harry laughs in spite of himself.
“Ahh— Ahh—” Harry moans, and Draco glances down, watching Harry’s cock twitch and jerk and spill precome onto the carpet. He’s seconds away from coming too, Draco thinks; just the hint of friction and he’d be done for. And all that from sucking
Harry always showers early; Draco’s known this, vaguely, abstractly, through the damp walls of the showers in their shared rooms on missions, the partly-used toiletries, the towel already hanging to dry by the time Draco wakes. Normally, though, the bathroom is in a separate room, Harry and his wet, naked body safely tucked away, out of sight.

Drool slides down the sides of Harry’s mouth, and his throat flutters and clenches around Draco’s cock. His face is flushed, and his lips already look swollen, and he’s moaning so much that Draco can
Yes, there’s a lot to talk about still. But Draco’s hand in his own heals something he’s tried so hard to pretend for years wasn’t broken, and finally, Harry thinks he can begin to move on.
“Woah!” he cries as his feet come out from under him, and Draco instinctively reaches out to grab him before he can fall flat on his arse. “Thanks, Draco. Christ, what was

But the minute you leave for a minute or two it’s like...I’m afraid I’ll just put my foot in it and she’ll add another month onto this thing or something.”
Harry’s tucked himself in by the time Draco gets back, so he clambers up on the bed too, handing Harry the glass and carefully wiping his face off.
He pulls the stack of letters out from the concealed drawer at the base of his desk, spreading them in front of him in chronological order. They’re all opened by now, but they hadn’t been prior to yesterday, and with mingled dread and guilt Harry opens and scans through them again, one by one.
He busies himself with unpacking Harry’s clothes for him, frowning at the wrinkles before he spells them out and hangs everything up. The sight of their clothes side-by-side in the same armoire makes him close his eyes briefly before he turns back to face Harry, who’s now turned onto his stomach and has his face buried into a pillow. “Alright, Potter?”
They win two of the games, and drop one, and all in all it’s a triumphant return for a much-needed long weekend of rest.
he’d explained as he handed over his Muggle credit card and Ginny peered around the shop, trying to disguise how overwhelmed she was by the sheer size and amount of choices. She was used to the Wizarding World, to Diagon Alley and its one or two options for anything one might need. Wheezes had been the first new shop in decades.
need a drink right now. Do you want to come to the pub with me? We can drink our worries away, and if you’d like you can stay at mine, and we’ll have breakfast ready for Ron when he gets back tomorrow—how does that sound?”
It starts soft, gentle, exploratory, but then Potter’s hands slide down from Draco’s shoulders to his waist, and then his arse, and Draco moans into his mouth, and soon Potter has to pull off his glasses and send them winging back into the kitchen, and in the momentary distraction his magic sliding through the air causes, manages to shove Draco down against the couch and crawl on top of him.
Lunch continues in the less-fraught vein of slagging off their coworkers and the Ministry bureaucrats as a whole, and as they walk back into the bullpen and towards their adjoining offices, Ron’s got a spring in his step again, so Harry calls lunch a success—until, that is, he spots Seamus leaning on the wall between their doors.
“I know you don’t like me; I don’t know what I’ve done recently to make you so unhappy to spend time in my presence, but really, don’t you have
“Oh god,” Harry whimpers, but he obediently drifts closer, yelping a bit when he’s in reach and Draco yanks him forward, spinning them and pressing Harry chest-down against his own desk.
Soon, his trousers and pants are around his ankles, and Draco’s leaning back against the counter, white-knuckling the edge in an effort to not thrust, as Potter grips his thighs and takes his cock down into his throat.
He cranks the water down a few more degrees; he may have stepped into the shower a little too early, because sweat is still rolling off his body and he’s still catching his breath, but he’d lost track of time on the treadmill in his effort to work out the day’s frustrations, and when he’d thought to check his watch he barely had twenty minutes to meet Ron and Hermione at the pub.
she cast on him at the end of each fight, when she couldn’t take it any longer. And as much as he empathises with Ron’s desire for a peaceful, carefree life, he knows that there had still been work to be done, and anyway, war or not, relationships require effort, don’t they? That’s why he and Ginny fizzled, after all—neither of them cared enough to put in the work to maintain a romantic relationship, and between that and their sexual incompatibility, they fell back into being just friends almost immediately that summer.
He winds his arms around Harry’s waist and tucks Harry’s head into his neck, rocking them slowly and whispering “it’s alright, you did so well, I love you” in a repeating mantra as Harry cries and cries, his whole body shaking with the grief he can’t let out during the day.
Just before Harry lowers his head to the rigid outline of Draco’s cock, he looks up. “Did I… Was I good?” he asks, a thread of uncertainty in his voice.
Draco’s distracted all day, watching the clock so he knows when Harry will be out of the office and he can sneak down before the meeting-that-isn’t; luckily, Magical Games and Sports is suffering a post-World Cup planning hangover, and the offices are quiet, his employees walking around in a daze that can only come from being suddenly relieved of the object of their intense focus for the past six months, so he doesn’t have to worry about missing anything important.
But his pride, so wounded after Draco stopped taking his calls after the second time they slept together almost four years ago, had him putting the letters to the side, sure that Draco was either messing with him, or trying to throw him off.
“Well, no; I’m not sure when I would have seen your, er. Thighs. Before today.” Draco’s voice is pinched, and Harry grimaces.

It helps that Harry’s in the same state. Draco catches his eyes every time he looks over, and Harry’s body is angled towards him all night, his hand at his side in a fist as if he’s stopping himself from reaching for Draco when they’re close.
Oh, he’d noticed that when Draco went down on him he was always much more enthusiastic if Harry had a tight grip on his ponytail, but it wasn’t until a round of angry sex after a vicious argument over who was responsible for picking up which groceries (ah, the travails of newly living with someone), and Harry had been fucking Draco against the wall, slow and deep, and he’d snuck his hand up and tangled it in Draco’s hair and pulled back sharply to expose his neck, and Draco had come all over the wall with a shout, that Harry realized just
“My apologies, Head Healer Potter,” Malfoy drawls, getting to his feet. “It’s just, I looked and looked and wasn’t able to locate your schedule, and I’ve a number of concerns on how Emergency is handling specialty consults. I know you’ve been handling things a
“Oh my god,” she whimpers, covering her mouth with her hands. Her eyes are huge. “Ron, oh my god, Ron, are you okay, what happened? Did…” her eyes tick to Malfoy, who’s rubbing his head and staring around the room in a daze, and she shakes her head just a bit. “Was there an explosion? Was it one of the books? Oh, I
Draco doesn’t leave him waiting for long, but Harry’s managed to work himself into a proper lather by the time Draco bursts through the building door and hustles them over to an alleyway to talk.
“You’re such a knob,” Potter says fondly, but he follows Draco out of the kitchen, stopping to grab two glasses of water on his way.
was going to be the one to do it. I couldn’t afford any distractions. I had to focus on the work. It was as if I were possessed. That’s when I should have known something had gone wrong.”
Draco looks fragile like this, in a way he never does normally, not even when he’s asleep. There are always lines between his eyebrows and a slight downturn to his mouth when he sleeps, as if he’s wrestling with important philosophical questions in his dreams. Harry’s teased him about it in the past, but now he finds himself struck by the smooth absence of any expression at all on Draco’s face, by how truly lifeless he looks even though Harry knows he still breathes, can hear his heartbeat, even as faint as it is.
his wand is in its holster, but that’s Draco, he supposes. “Sure, why not. It’s not like we’re going to get called for anything else today. Merlin, what a waste of
“Bloody hell,” Potter groans, standing and pressing down on the impressive bulge in his trousers. “The bloody cake needs frosting now. Come on, Malfoy; let’s go see if this icing is as good as you claim it is.”
He points his tongue and presses it inside Harry, just a little at a time, just enough so Harry’s thighs start to shake and his stomach clenches, but Draco knows that no matter how long he does this, Harry won’t come,
Draco had walked into practice that first day geared up for—harsh words, a snubbing, maybe even a physical altercation? Instead, Potter had shaken his hand enthusiastically, smiled broadly, and earnestly said how pleased he and the team were to have Draco there, and how much they were all looking forward to learning from him, and how
“God fucking damn it, Draco,” Harry moans, and he’s naked between one blink and the next, tackling Draco back onto the bed and kissing him desperately. “Thank
Malfoy sighs in a very put-upon fashion, deliberately pushes his plate away, stands, stalks around the coffee table, sits in Harry’s lap, and proceeds to thoroughly snog his face off.
“Harry,” he moans, whining through his teeth when Harry’s hand fondles his balls briefly and then disappears again. “Please.”
By the time Harry works his way down to Draco’s thighs, he’s flying. He’s on a whole other level, even more than the one time they tried heavier impact play (which they’d decided was not for them). The threat of the hot wax so close to his cock and balls only ratchets his pleasure higher, and he’s aware that he’s gasping for air, and that Harry is cursing quietly under his breath, no doubt responding to the twitching of Draco’s cock and the golden swirls painting his body.
if all Harry feels for him is a friendly professional regard and the respect he’s owed for his exemplary work, he
“Shit,” Potter mutters, crushing them even harder together, and with a few more shuddering thrusts Draco feels Potter come, that big cock twitching and a warm wetness spreading through the fabric.
They manage to get through dinner with a minimum of chaos, once Draco directs Potter firmly to the sofa and tells him to
blame to be assigned, it would go to me—I should have known better than to speak Latin around the books.” He looks glum for a minute, but perks up. “In fact, he gave me some really good advice about Hermione! We had dinner right when I went over, and Merlin, can he ever cook—who would have thought—and he asked me why Hermione didn’t seem more upset about the whole thing, you know, and I explained about the breakup and everything, and he was all snotty about it at first, but after he got that out of his system he really made a lot of sense—he was talking about how Hermione has her own career and expecting her to do more chores than me isn’t fair, and that it
Draco’s breath hitches, and his fingers inch closer to Harry’s crack. “You—” He swallows. “When you’re— You think of me?”
nothing at all—and rolls his eyes. “No doubt whoever it is will be perfectly happy to wait on you,” he says, trying for a sneer and falling far short.

“Sorry,” Potter says, and he sounds miserable. “I know this is… Well. I know you barely tolerate me, and this has got to be your worst nightmare, and...I’m sorry, as much as I joke around I do get that this isn’t exactly ideal for you, but…” He trails off, and Draco’s shoulders slump.
though? These books are bloody heavy, and Hermione will get all disappointed if I use a charm or anything. Bloody specialty libraries and their bloody
Their partnership isn’t widely-known outside the DMLE, so when Harry bumps into Draco at some point during the night, they’re able to manufacture a convincingly polite scene that anyone who knows they’re distant coworkers would expect. Draco finds his eyes tracking to Harry all night, though, and his ears seem fine-tuned to pick up on Harry’s laugh.
When the IAQ decided to institute the new fouls-and-penalties rules into international play, England had been left at a distinct disadvantage. North American teams had been playing this way for years, with rules adapted from Muggle ice hockey, and the Russians weren’t far behind, but the UK found itself without a single coach prepared to rush training and implementation of the new regulations.
“Yeah,” Harry says miserably, taking another deep drink. Fuck, the glass is almost empty already. “Yeah, it
After a minute, Potter laughs ruefully to himself and pulls back, staggering a bit until he gets a hand on the back of Draco’s chair. Draco watches as he takes a few deep breaths, then rolls his neck and walks back around to the other side of the desk.
in knowing what you like in bed, anyway? It certainly helped that he knows what feels good, especially when we decided that he needed to— Er.” Stopping abruptly, Ron colours.
Ginny sighs and tips her head back against his shoulder, closing her eyes. Her stomach is still roiling, but it’s not from Harry’s tickles any longer. “I just hope I don’t freeze, you know—like, get up in the air and forget what colours my team is in, or something horrible like that. It’s going to be so different.”
Harry had been finishing his undergraduate degree and was knee-deep in his thesis and applications for post-graduate study, and he’d been hunting for a specific book on the impact of long-term Dark magic exposure on inanimate family heirlooms that had their own inherent bloodline magic, and

bit faster and didn’t have such a damn backlog of submissions… Well. They might have reviewed his work in time. Is it their fault? Harry, this is all just...a confluence of bad luck and missteps. You can’t take it all on your shoulders.”
Harry curses to himself, then sits back in his chair with a groan. Hermione takes the visitor chair opposite, and he does
off, and all in all it’s quite some time until Ginny starts packing for her first set of road games as a member of the Holyhead Harpies’ squad.
The fundraiser is Wizarding, of course, and the golf course itself has been rented out and staffed by their own for the day, but the hotel is still open to Muggle guests, so Draco keeps a tight hold of his magic, wraps it back down into his core until he’s hidden by the trees and can let it out.
Draco considers his options. He’s out of sugar and vanilla extract now, so he’d have to run to the shops for more, but at this point, he’s not sure he’ll
cook but enjoys keeping a clean kitchen, so even the division of chores hasn’t been a problem. They keep similar schedules, are fond of quiet evenings, and conduct their
Draco heaves a deep, deep sigh. He should be putting in for hazard pay for this. “I suppose you’re suggesting I spend the night in here,” he says without turning back to face the bed. He can tell his face is bright red, and Potter doesn’t need to see that.
“Just send it, Draco, it’s as good as it’s gonna be; you know as well as I do the interview was a waste of time, and prettying it up isn’t going to hide that.”
Harry has to close his eyes at that, and when he opens them, the look on Draco’s face...well, he can’t
By the time Harry walks back into his office, Draco’s leaned artfully against the desk, one hand down his trousers—he’s flushed already, he knows, and when Harry freezes and rakes his eyes greedily up and down his body, Draco knows
—” Harry’s babbling, fists clenching in the sheets, and Draco takes pity on him, rubs lube over his prick and positions himself at Harry’s hole.
Draco glances at his wristwatch. “About ten more minutes. I took it a little after three, like the note said.” He won’t meet Harry’s eyes. Harry’s not sure what he’d see in them, anyway; not in this unfamiliar shade of brown, not after so long.
Ginny’s ducking her way through the crowds in Diagon, headed to Quality Quidditch Supplies to check in on her broom’s customisation work, when she’s practically bowled over by Harry, who’s laughing over his shoulder as he exits Twilfitt & Tatting’s.
they’re going to the places they go, but having something to do is bringing the light back to his eyes.
is noticing that Malfoy’s got one hell of an arse, actually, and that his cheekbones are high, and that his mouth is mobile and full and really quite lovely when he laughs. Which he’s doing. A lot. At Ron’s jokes. Which
“Self-involved wanker,” Harry mutters, shifting a bit and settling down into Draco’s lap, dozing a bit. It’s not exactly comfortable, with their skin smeared with Harry’s spend and Draco’s cock softening inside him, but sex with Draco always leaves him filled with lassitude and a desire to just lie there and let Draco pet and soothe him until he regains his energy. “I shouldn’t encourage this.”
if it’s not how Harry fills out the consult request forms (‘This is barely legible, are you looking for Psych or Surgery?’), it’s the abbreviations Malfoy uses when he’s charting (‘We’re not
Harry’s due back at three from his meeting with the Minister, so Draco spends the time tidying the office a bit for him, sorting files away and Vanishing the trash and folding up clothes that need to be taken home to be washed, then carefully moves everything off the desk and out of the way.
Harry makes a harsh sound around his cock, and the tears flow free, rolling unchecked down his cheeks. Draco moves his hands so he’s holding the sides of his face, so he can rub the tears into Harry’s skin.
Ginny wakes up the next day in a puddle of sunshine. The other side of the bed is still undisturbed.
“Maybe he missed the glorious English sunshine,” Ron suggests, peering at the Charmed window near the front of the room, which shows the rain pattering down on the streets above. “Merlin knows he could use it.”
Harry scrambles to his feet and strips off his trousers and pants, taking a moment to fold them carefully and set them aside. His socks are folded over each other and placed on top, and his glasses, arms carefully bent back into place, on top of those.
. It was too important. And then, six months ago, all the time I’d spent, all the life I’d lost...I thought it would all be worth it, because I’d done it, and I’d have as much time, and as much life, as I wanted.”
“Oh, unclench, Malfoy; you love explaining this shit,” Potter says cheerfully, flicking his fingers at the shimmering barrier. It slowly dissolves into the air, and Draco manfully restrains a shiver as Harry’s magic flows back over them, task completed.
Hermione sighs, but forces a smile at Harry, who grimaces back as he dutifully passes the books over. “Right, Harry. I’ll just be...down here, then.” She scurries partway down another aisle, then pulls out a list and looks between it and a shelf just past her arm-reach.
He drops their clothes on a chair and strides back over to the bed, pushing his pyjama bottoms off and bracketing Harry’s thighs with his legs. Harry leans back onto his elbows and watches with a dark gaze as Draco spells some lube onto his hands, then starts to stroke himself off.
Their breakfast is silent and horrible, and finally Harry puts his fork down. “Look. I’ve never been with a man before. Prior to last week, I wasn’t even aware it was something I wanted. I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing, but I
Draco’s panting and writhing forward against Potter’s leg, hands roaming up and down Potter’s back, getting handfuls of that arse to grind them closer together. “
Harry’s hands fly to Draco’s hips as he grinds forward, and the snake on his leg crawls up and down his thigh, and from the way Draco starts shivering he can feel it. Harry drags his hands up over Draco’s torso until he reaches his chest, and he pinches and tugs at his nipples and the piercings until Draco’s squirming and howling in pleasure while Harry ruts his cock between Draco’s cheeks.
The water is running down over his back, some of it dripping from his hair into his eyes, but Draco barely notices, so consumed is he with making Harry shiver and shake and moan into the arm he’s using to cushion his head against the wall. He licks around the edges, kneading his hands into Harry’s arse the whole time, and points his tongue into Harry’s arse as deep as he can go.
“No,” Harry says, voice a bit strangled. “Nothing outside the normal shite you hear at these sorts of things—affairs, some light money laundering, a few statements about voting that Kingsley might be interested in. Here, toss me your shirt from last night and I’ll strip the spell and store it, we can save that and anything we get from that booth for when we’re back at the office and can properly listen.”
“You look stunning like this,” Draco says approvingly, circling around Harry and admiring the way the light blue silks bring out the undertones in his hair. “I do so love when you make yourself pretty for me.”
None of them ask questions. They never have. They don’t care about her personal life, as long as it’s not negatively impacting her game.
They make their way through the house carefully, Potter blasting away errant curses while Draco marks down their categories and guides them closer to where the wardstone is. As off as all the spells are, he’s fairly certain that removing and disabling the stone will set the house to rights, which means they should be able to wrap this job up with a minimum of paperwork and possibly even an afternoon off if Draco plays his cards right.
when Harry comes, and Harry hadn’t been sure at first, but now the sight of Draco pulling back, gasping and choking as he swallows Harry’s come, is almost enough to get him hard again.
Harry whines and tries to push back onto Draco’s finger, but Draco’s other hand on his hip holds him firm. “Come on,” he begs, “I want it, Draco, please, give them to me.”
Inch by inch, Draco feeds his cock down Harry’s throat, pausing when Harry gags a bit to give him time to adjust, but never pulling out, never stopping. He only stops when Harry’s nose is pressed to his pubic hair. He can feel Harry’s exhales against his skin and shivers.
Finally, with a sense of dread, he goes back into the guest room. Potter’s dimmed the lights almost all the way, and Draco can barely make out the lump that is his body under the duvet, curled up and facing away from the door.
He holds Harry there for a little bit, feeling Harry swallow around him, milking out the last of his orgasm, and when Harry’s shaking, probably desperate for air, Draco finally lets him go at the same time as he pushes his leg up against Harry’s cock.
not a single damn thing. She can’t find it in herself to be grateful for that; it’s the least he could do.
expensive champagne I know they have at the bar downstairs...well, we’ll see about later tonight, won’t we?”
You don’t run into your old schoolboy nemesis-turned-famous-author while acting as an uncomfortable third wheel for your best friends every day, after all. That’s why he’s feeling hot at the neck and sweaty under his arms.
Harry tugs off his jacket and lets it fall to the ground. Draco narrows his eyes. It doesn’t always go like this; sometimes, Harry falls right into character, and Draco has them both cleaned up and asleep within an hour.
Sinking back into Draco’s arms, Harry shrugs. “Dunno. You know how I feel about how your hair looks after you use that special...whatever it is potion. All shiny and curly. I can’t resist.”
“You’re right,” Ron interrupts his musing as they round a corner. “I do appreciate you coming. And I’m sure that soon we’ll both be a little less...awkward...and you can have your weekends back, instead of going everywhere with us like some sort of weird seventeenth-century chaperone. Merlin,
they were he’d picked Puddlemere, as his familiarity with the new system would no doubt give them an advantage both in league play and when it came time for national team selection.
once, as opposed to the traditional three times that used to be mandated by the spell; we’re lucky the magic in the room only picked up on the skeleton of the spell and didn’t focus enough to bring the entire thing to life, or we’d be having to look into a divorce solicitor in a few weeks’ time!” Her laugh trails off sickly, and Malfoy fixes her with a withering glare. She winces. “Right. So. You’ll have to stay within ten feet until the spell has been, er, satisfied as it were, but once that’s done you’ll be released from the constraints of the bond instantly, with no ill side-effects.”
“Here, let me—hang on,” Harry pants, pulling back to stand and quickly remove his clothes. He wiggles back into Draco’s lap once Draco’s got his trousers pushed down, too impatient to wait more.
This isn’t just about them and whatever conclusion these little games have been moving them towards, though. This is about Teddy. And Draco refuses to disappoint his family, not any more.
showers at the Ministry. He hates the locker rooms, hates sharing bathing space with others even if barely anyone else is in there, and has a veritable fleet of haircare and skincare potions at home (with colour-coordinated bottles; Harry had been
and Draco’s body heats. He’s spent enough time in competitive sport to find aggression kind of hot—so sue him. “
“Potter, we’ve got a bit of a situation here,” Draco says, ending on a wheeze as Potter’s leg creeps over his own and nudges against his cock.
Draco idly runs his hand over his own torso, stopping to pinch his nipples and scratch along his side, and soon it’s Harry who’s panting, shifting and trying to rub his thighs together, anything for some friction on his cock. Draco can see his biceps bulge as he tries to pull his arms out from where they’re bound behind his back, but the ties are magicked shut; he’s not getting free without Draco’s help unless he uses his word.
Draco strokes over his hair in approval, and Harry shivers. “Good. Now. You were home late, and you wouldn’t pick up after yourself, and then you were rude to me. How many do you think that deserves?”
Harry; this building isn’t even two hundred years old. And I had a few great-whatevers who were fond of passing out choice pieces of property as favours. It’s entirely possible this was a gift meant to cultivate a valuable acquaintance, or perhaps even for a lover. We still have a few homes scattered around up here, but I haven’t been. Father isn’t fond of
like the look in her eyes. “So, Harry…” she starts, leaning forward. “I couldn’t help but notice how unbelievably
Tilting his head, Draco considers forcing a third orgasm, even presses down a bit harder on Harry’s prostate, but Harry’s eyes are glazed over, so he pulls out carefully and heads into the bathroom for a flannel. He takes care of his own erection quickly—normally, he’d draw it out, but Harry needs his attention now, so he can linger over the memories later on, then steps back into the bedroom and carefully cleans Harry off.
Draco sighs and rolls his head a bit as Harry moves down to cuff his ankles, too. The table shifts under him, adjusting to the contours of his body until he’s perfectly supported.
Draco waves his hand impatiently, then pulls the crumpled-newspaper Portkey out of his pocket and steps closer to Harry. “Special circumstances, Potter; our target is actually
?” Potter grits out when Draco voices this thought, glaring up at him from the landing. Draco hadn’t been fast enough to grab him before he fell that time. “Look, just—let’s get out of here. Maybe once we’re out it’ll stop?”
It had been enough then, even though she’d tried to pretend otherwise with Michael and Dean. It’s enough now. Maybe she’s never going to realise what it is she wants in time to appreciate it as it’s happening.
; he crosses the room, kicking off the joggers as he goes, and crawls over next to Harry on the mattress.
Smiling, he glances to his left, where Draco’s sprawled out, one hand resting over his head. Harry lets his eyes drago up Draco’s torso, eyes blurring and refocusing as the new life rushing through his body settles. It always takes a few minutes, after he finishes drinking, for him to settle back into his own skin; he feels almost like he’s vibrating at first.
It isn’t always success stories, of course, but after the first few years, Harry had discovered Third Space.
Draco, sensibly, keeps his wand up and ready as he cautiously steps into the house. The magic presses down on him, and to his annoyance, he finds himself drawing closer to Potter, who gives him a quick glance, mouth drawn down in sympathy. The strain must be showing on his face, then. Splendid. “Let’s get going,” he mutters, cocking his head and closing his eyes. “I think...to the left, first.”
The vibrations increase suddenly, and Harry’s mind brushes over his own, a command that couldn’t be clearer if it were spoken aloud, and Draco screams and comes all over the floor.
Harry had asked her opinion through every stage of the redecorating process, though; next came the bedsheets and duvet, then the colour of the walls throughout the entire house, the length and shade of curtains, should he get the sofa reupholstered? And Ginny had done her best, and Hermione and Ron had chipped in too, and slowly but surely Grimmauld Place turned into a home, somewhere Ginny was spending more time at than the Burrow these days.
library, with a pile of old books in front of him and a long parchment covered in his cramped handwriting pooling down to his feet, thin silver glasses perched at the edge of his nose as he frowns disapprovingly at Ron and splays his hands over the paper in front of him—well, Harry’s a bit flustered, is all.
Ron stares at them for a minute, then sinks to the floor, laughing so hard he’s holding his stomach and actually
over at the book in question, leaving it floating innocently in midair so Hermione can examine it without touching anything.
He pushes Draco’s shirt up, sliding his palms along Draco’s stomach and chest, cupping his pecs. “You look so good,” he says, pinching Draco’s nipples just a little too hard to get him squirming between Harry’s thighs. “I love your chest. I love how red you get.” He ducks his head to worry at Draco’s collarbone with his teeth, shoving the shirt the rest of the way over Draco’s head and throwing it behind the sofa. Harry loves seeing his marks on Draco later, loves watching Draco fuss and scold in the mirror as he arranges his shirts to cover them.
“Anything,” Draco muses, but almost immediately he steps back, ignoring Harry’s whine in order to turn him so he’s pressed face-first against the wall. When he drops to his knees and parts Harry’s cheeks, he smirks a bit at Harry’s cursing.
Waving a hand, Harry sets him to rights before Draco can even cry out, and he relaxes back into the comforting embrace of Harry’s magic. He still watches the candle, but his eyes are half-closed now, and he feels—safe. It’s not close enough to hurt him, and anyway, Harry’s right there. Harry’s always right there.
” he says dryly, then spreads his thighs and leans back into the couch. Palming himself through his joggers, he winks at Harry. “Well, then; sounds like we’re on the same page for next time. For now, though...how about you come over here and suck my cock for a while, and then maybe later on I’ll fuck you?”
He eventually finds it, carelessly dropped behind an armchair in the corner of the room where he’d no doubt flung it in their frantic, hasty lust as they came in from their dinner-date, and as he strides back over to the bed he fumbles it, nearly drops it, still on a high from Draco’s blood.
Potter’s fast on a broom. He’s faster than Draco’s ever seen him when he circles the desk, hauls Draco out of his chair, and shoves him against the wall.
There’s a breakfast spread in the sitting room—apparently Harry’s not the only nervous chef—and Malfoy’s lurking awkwardly near the front door, shifting from foot to foot until he sees Harry and straightens so abruptly Harry almost hears his spine snap.
Hermione snaps out of her frozen posture and rushes over to help Ron to the exit, leaving Harry with Malfoy, who glares up at him petulantly. “Well, Potter? Are you going to help me up?”
“Okay,” Harry says peaceably, reaching out and grabbing a blanket from further down the couch and wrapping it around them. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
minutes? I thought Robards said we had until half three?” Harry’s finally extracted himself from his wardrobe and is shoving everything he’s selected for the trip into a bag. Draco wrinkles his nose at the rough treatment, but at least Harry’s chosen appropriate attire for their destination.
Potter’s hard against Draco’s hip, and the fabrics between them are so thin Draco can feel its hot pulse. His mouth waters; he desperately wants that in his mouth, wants to be
Finally, Draco sits up, spells the cock ring off, wraps his hand around Harry and tugs once, pressing his other hand’s index finger hard against Harry’s perineum. “Come,” he says softly, and Harry
Ron always rolled his eyes at how much Harry spent on his membership there, but Harry’s found that nothing quiets the memories of a child lying still and cold after a spell gone wrong, or the anger from relatives and loved ones who don’t understand that sometimes there’s nothing to be done than a good, hard sweat session. And if he can’t get it in the bedroom, Third Space’s top-of-the-line equipment and over-the-top amenities more than suffice.
Draco’s grateful Potter’s in the fire and can’t see how red he’s turning. “Whatever, Potter,” he snaps. “Fine, you win. Are you going to
He thinks Ron must have won the pool, because after three months had passed and they were still cohabitating, he came to pub night one week looking terribly smug, and he’d bought Harry and Draco’s first three rounds with no explanation whatsoever. Hermione had also been oddly grumpy that evening.
Snapping his fingers, Harry summons over a pot filled with a deep purple ointment. “It’s a healing salve,” he explains, unscrewing the cap and tilting it for Draco to see. “It’s for the marks...if you lie back down I’ll take care of it for you.”

He crosses the room and snatches the spoon from Potter’s hand, then dips his finger into the icing and holds it in front of Harry’s mouth. “Did you want to try some?” he asks innocently.
Harry leans back and gasps for air, then glances down and smirks at the wet spot on Draco’s fine grey trousers. “Oh,” he says casually, as if he’s not naked in Draco’s lap, “did you need help with that?” He wiggles forward purposefully, and Draco groans; Harry’s arse and thighs have
“You look amazing,” Harry whispers, and his hands are suddenly slick, dancing over Draco’s nipples and his ribcage and down to his inner thighs. “I love seeing you like this—still, and calm, and all spread out for
all over the room. Getting ready for bed is slightly more fraught as Draco has to help Potter with changing into (Draco’s!) pyjamas, but finally he gets Potter safely into bed.
Harry and Draco look at each other for a moment, and finally Draco cracks a hesitant smile. “She hasn’t changed a bit, has she?” he asks wryly, getting to his feet.
and both departments have benefited; Emergency’s paperwork has never looked better since Malfoy started sending forms back with red ink corrections, and Psych’s intake process time has halved since Harry taunted Malfoy for being slower than a Flobberworm at check-ins.
Harry stays late that day. He hides in his office, reviewing paperwork and starting on his budget requests that aren’t due for months. He doesn’t want to run any risk of running into Draco again.
They’re in their bedroom, Harry with his legs as wide as Draco could push them, and the morning light had just started to filter in through the curtains when Draco snuck out of bed to retrieve this little
Harry lets the silence drag on, just long enough for Draco to shift uncomfortably in the chair, before he starts talking.
Potter falls against his torso with a surprised yelp, which turns quickly into a groan when Draco thrusts up, rubbing them together through the thin, silky cotton of the pyjama bottoms. “Fuck,” Potter hisses out, and their magic snaps sweet-smelling sparkles over them, and that’s about all Draco can be expected to withstand.
implies that they have a routine, or that Harry was waiting for him; obviously neither of those things are true, but the fact remains that it’s halfway through Harry’s shift and he hasn’t gotten so much as a memo from Psych yet.
“Twenty-four,” Harry gasps out, and just as Draco’s about to deliver the final hit, mind already working ahead to how to introduce adding
. Draco hates being the butt of someone’s joke, even when it’s not meant maliciously, and he hates how flustered false attention like that makes him feel.
Draco reaches for the conditioner, noting that the levels are lower than they should be, and then determinedly
Almost delicately, Draco closes his mouth around the head of Harry’s cock and sucks. Harry whines high in his throat and slaps his hands down on the bed. Draco grabs one of them and puts it on the back of his head, winking up at Harry before he slides his mouth down and takes the entirety of Harry’s cock into his throat.
He pulls his head back and bites down on Potter’s neck, feeling Potter tremble in his arms. Draco gets a firm grip on Potter’s arse, and it feels just as incredible as it looks in those bloody trousers, and it’s not long before they’re both shuddering and coming.
He scowls playfully at her, but allows it. “And how, exactly, do you know what’s on the Head Auror’s daily calendar,
argument), while Ron felt that now that they were together, that was that—villain slain, heroes get their girls, remaining bad guys get their punishments, good guys live in luxury and bliss for the rest of their days.
Ginny melts against him, warm with his praise. “Hey, so, I’m going to take a shower, but do you maybe want…” She leans back and arches an eyebrow at him, watching as his face gets a little flushed as he catches on.
The man jumps, and whirls, and some sort of Glamour charm skitters and warps over his features. The auburn hair fades to silver, then back to red, and the square jaw lengthens to a point before snapping back.
He’d surprised a lot of people, when he didn’t show up for the first day of Auror training, deciding instead to enroll in the Derwent Healers Training Programme. He’d surprised

. That was an excellent try, though.” In truth, if this were up to him, Draco probably would have offered fifteen; the fact that Harry’s looking up at him hopefully means he’s lowballing, though, so Draco will add on. “We’ll start with twenty-five, and see how you’re doing after that.”
“In certain circles, I can assure you that they do,” Draco says, stepping back under the water and rinsing his face. He turns to examine his own shampoo choices, and Harry’s eyes drop of their own accord to his arse. “They came into fashion in the 1890s, you know—those Victorians may have been backwards about a lot of things, but they certainly were right on the money about what feels nice. Anyway, it’s turned into something of a tradition among that crowd; when you turn sixteen, one of your older friends will ‘sneak you out of the house’ and take you to get them done. It’s all terribly hush-hush, they make a big production out of it, sort of a mini coming-of-age ceremony before the major one when you turn seventeen. Everyone knows about it, of course, it’s been done for generations, but it’s all for fun, anyway. Adrian Pucey took me; Merlin, I had
yes. I always think about— Well, I think about this. What if you woke up and saw me. What if you woke up and came in and joined me just as I was—” Draco swivels his hips and plasters them together, and Harry cuts himself off to moan loudly.

over the booth, probably with several replacements as well as a heavy cloaking charm, so he focuses instead on getting up the stairs and down the hall to their suite without falling over. With any luck, Harry will be asleep already.
Harry stands abruptly. “Er—tea,” he mumbles, when Ron and Seamus turn to stare at him. He hustles out into the hall, ears burning.
Harry doesn’t say anything at breakfast, and neither does Draco; they sit near each other, but since they’re not supposed to be here
“Why is he writing to you at home?” she says, crossing her arms to disguise the tremble in her hands.
Draco examines the vial in surprise. “...Thank you,” he says cautiously, uncorking it and sniffing before swallowing it down. Harry tamps down his irritation; he well remembers how paranoid Draco had been when they were...whatever they were, and he can’t imagine the intervening years spent locked up in his Manor’s lab has done much to change that.
Even after almost a year, Draco sometimes wakes up and thinks he’s still in the southwest of America, that he’ll spell his curtains open and be able to curl up and bake lizard-like in the morning sun streaming in through his window. As much as being back home makes him happier overall—and it certainly made his mother happier, too—there are things about Arizona he misses.
was even stranger—the worst-kept secret in the Wizarding world is that Malfoy’s pen name is Rod Stone, the author behind an unbelievably popular romance series, beloved by not only the stereotypical housewife audience but anyone who’s read even one of the novels. They feature a loosely-connected group of friends and their various romantic and professional entanglements, and are all well-researched and
When he finally pulls back, Harry’s dazed and his lips are numb, and he’s pretty sure his erection is going to leave a bruise on Malfoy’s thigh where it’s pushing against him.
There’s a garden out back that they plan out over the winters, and tackle together in the springs. It’s terribly domestic, when Draco stops to think about it—which he tries not to do too much. He doesn’t like to consider the

Harry’s used a lot of words to describe Draco Malfoy over the years (pointy, rude, nasty; suspicious, toady;

Draco fiddles with his hair, pushing a lank strand behind his ear. “Oh, they’ve quite given up on me, I’m afraid to say. They’ve taken to cooking more and more elaborate meals and staring at me after they deliver it, trying to guilt me into eating. It’s just...for so long, I was so consumed by the work it felt that doing

Harry’s never been anything less than professional with him since they were paired up, and while their relationship has certainly warmed to cordiality, if not outright friendship, in the intervening years, Draco’s well aware that his inconvenient attraction is incredibly one-sided, and impossible besides; they’re Aurors, and to Harry, the mission will always come first. It always has.
Draco smirks and stoops for a swift kiss. “See you later,” he says, then whirls to dress himself and get out the door before Harry can tackle him onto the bed.
“And with…” Harry isn’t sure he wants to know the answer to his question; isn’t sure he even has the right to ask.
But now, he pushes his way into the locker room and heads straight for the showers like he’s there every day, and Harry can only follow along, mind working furiously.
The revelry ends earlier than last night’s, when someone knocks over a lamp and scatters glass all over the floor and everyone is politely but firmly escorted out by the clubhouse staff so they can clean. Draco manages to slip the night manager a rather large tip as an apology, and he thinks he’s gotten away with it, but then he turns around and Harry’s right there, looking down at him with shiny green eyes, and for a second Draco thinks they’re about to totally blow their cover, because Harry is
” Harry scoffs, kicking Draco’s shin lightly. “If I praised you any more, you’d swell up like a balloon and float away.” Harry gets an odd little smile when he says that, but Draco’s learned to ignore his various quirks.
Harry shifts and winces when he knocks his knee against the bottom side of his desk. He looks up in time to catch the side of Draco’s borrowed mouth flickering up in what might be a smile. And even though it might be at his expense, Harry’s rather shocked at just how glad he is to see Draco smiling again. Their last interaction had been much less pleasant, and Harry has to forcibly shove the memory of Draco’s snide, mocking voice to the back of his mind and focus as Draco’s hair starts to slowly bleed back to blonde.
“Uhh,” Harry mutters, rolling onto his side when he’s clean and snagging Draco by the waist, pulling him down onto the bed with an undignified yelp he hopes Harry is too blissed-out to register. “Okay, you were right, that was a
when he’s angry; his eyes shine, and his face gets pink, and his hair halos around his head where he’s run his hands (his big, capable hands) through it in frustration. He’s intolerably rude, a snob and a purist and a pedant, and Harry can’t help but think about
about it—he spends half his life barging into Harry’s office uninvited and with no notice, brandishing reams of parchment and yapping in that supercilious nasal tone, sneering down at Harry’s messy desk and running through all the accounting issues Harry’s department is responsible for at such a fast clip that Harry can’t keep up, can only blink slowly and clench his fists under his desk, counting to ten in an effort to not resort to violence as Draco crosses his arms and smirks.
Harry steps back and nods once, casting his eyes down. “You’re right,” he says softly, turning and rummaging in his bag for more Hangover potions. “Here, here are yours,” he says, sending two vials spinning through the air to Draco’s bed. “Let’s go to bed.” Harry’s voice is tight, but Draco doesn’t think it’s anger, or displeasure—it sounds like the desperate edge of a man hanging onto the shreds of his self-control.
the next day showed him very clearly ripping the family signet ring off his finger and throwing it in Lucius’ shocked-looking face in the middle of Diagon Alley before storming off. From what Harry can tell, he hasn’t spoken to his parents since.
Draco, and I’m worried. You need sunlight, and rest, and three squares. You need someone to fuss over you a bit.”
As soon as Malfoy has his footing again, he shoves Harry onto the bed, and Harry goes easily, too turned on to protest at the rough treatment.
you can’t; look at me.” He swishes his hair over them, tickling the back of Harry’s neck with the strands.
isn’t fair for me to force her to remind me to do stuff around the house, because that’s not actually less work for her.”
headline and accompanying photo had been enough, thank you very much, and he’d fended off enough questions on why he was blushing so much over the idea of two men being together to last him a lifetime. He does have to admit that Malfoy gets a lot of the details of Auror investigations right, and Bill Weasley has commented on similar accuracy regarding Cursebreaking.
“Get your shirt off,” Malfoy instructs, stripping off his own vest and tossing it over his shoulder. Harry scrambles to comply, eyes fixed on the broad expanse of skin now in front of him, and oh, he can suddenly see all those all those
Well. Sometimes Draco knows Harry’s eyes are on him (something he learned in sixth year, and he’s never quite been able to shake how it feels), and it’s not because they’re on a stakeout, and it’s not because they’re passing theories back and forth at work, and he’ll keep his head bowed as he writes up his report, or he’ll continue his laps around the training facility, or whatever it is he’s doing, and wonder
Draco himself has been hard since Harry agreed to try this, and his cock is straining against his boxer-briefs. He palms himself briefly, then steps closer to Harry, tilting his chin up.
It’s a cliche, he knows. Harry’s eyes are fêted throughout the wizarding world, for their size and their unusual colour and the fire-bright intensity behind them. Many an interviewee has sworn they could actually
“Very well,” Malfoy says, sitting back down and taking up his quill again. “I’ll have something on your desk by the end of today.”
and his eyes go liquid with guilt but his jaw firms up in a frown and he won’t back down, won’t change his mind, and she storms out and sleeps at Hermione’s that night. They drink wine and paint their nails (Ginny can’t believe she’s gone this long without knowing about nail polish, it’s
“Look, Potter. I can’t say I didn’t...see this coming, although perhaps not quite that loudly, or in public. And after talking with Ron, part of me was hoping that… Anyway. You’ve had a lot to drink. Ron’s going back with Granger tonight, I think, and you can’t get back on your own, so—”
Draco had brought up the idea of Harry wearing a cock ring all day a few weeks ago, and he still gets hard thinking about how Harry’d held him down that night and fucked him so slowly he was crying and begging for release at the end.
“Merlin,” Harry mutters, reaching down and heaving Malfoy to his feet. “Alright then, Malfoy—let’s get you to the Ministry. If we’re lucky, there’s been a counter to this invented, and you’ll be on your way in no time.”
Harry moves up the arch of Draco’s neck, biting once over his Adam’s apple. The air between their bodies is humid and warm, and the small of Harry’s back is slick with sweat as he grinds against Draco. “I want you to put your fingers in me,” he says into Draco’s ear, drawing out a full-body shudder. “You’re so good with your hands. Do you think you can make me come, just like that? I bet you can.”
Draco’s clothes are always perfectly pressed and starched to within an inch of his life. He wears the same style of shirt in a variety of colours every day, rotating between them on a strict schedule only he understands (Harry wasted over a week one time trying to track the pattern and he only got as far as determining it’s not alphabetical), and he has six different suits that he seems to select based on mood. He somehow always seems to coordinate his ties with the Minister’s, so when they’re striding down the halls, heads bent together as they discuss whatever budgetary crisis the Ministry is dealing with that day, they look like a matched pair. Harry doesn’t know how Draco’s doing it, but he
is he so good at this? Harry winds his arms around Malfoy’s torso and drags his hands down until he reaches Malfoy’s arse, which feels just as good as it had looked perched on his desk at the office earlier that week.
Harry moans in response and presses his lips to Draco’s forehead, lifting and sinking back down with his thighs, squeezing his eyes closed in a desperate effort to stop from coming too soon. His cock is rubbing between their torsos, over skin slicked with precome, and he can feel heat building in his thighs, and from the way Draco’s trembling under him, they’re both nearly there.
He yelps when Harry pinches his arse. “I suppose since you’re paying for the room, I could buy you a few drinks,” Harry muses, joining him at the wardrobe as they pick out clothes for the day together. “After all, we’re here for a few more days, and all that’s left now is collecting the surveillance spells before we leave. It’s almost like we’re on holiday together.” He shoots Draco a shy smile.
feet instead. But even that could have been overlooked, if he hadn’t also turned Draco’s mother against him.
Harry hadn’t known what to say to that, but he thought Draco understood the silence that followed his statement, and Harry made his admiration clear in other ways.
his brain whispers), but it’s enough, and when Potter’s nose is pressed up against his closely-trimmed pubic hair, Draco comes with a whimper, sagging back against the counter.
His hand shakes and he forces himself to take a deep breath, then casts some diagnostics. Harry’s coming back to himself now, more and more every moment, and with each breath that he doesn’t need any longer the impulse to hesitate, to wait

Draco presses against his chest, where his heart feels about to burst it’s racing so quickly. “Fuck,” he mutters, staring at Potter, who’s equally flustered and wide-eyed.
Draco slips into the bathroom to change, and by the time he’s out, Harry’s in his bed, facing the far wall.
Draco rolls his shoulders a bit, working out the twinges from the latest assignment. The potioneer that had been assigned to the Hitwizard department once it was clear his strength and magical prowess far outweighed the Aurors’ capabilities (and hadn’t
“Briefly,” Potter says, moving so they’re standing next to each other, looking up at the unassuming facade. Their shoulders brush. Draco subtly shifts to the side. Potter shifts with him. Their shoulders are still brushing. “Accidental magic from the kid set off some sort of nasty Dark shit, yeah? I didn’t realize there was one of the Old Homes in Bermondsey.”
He’s ashamed of himself. He shouldn’t have said what he did, he knew it as soon as it came out of his mouth. And Draco’s
He kept it military-short the summer after the War; he was tired, and heartsick, and being pulled in a hundred different directions by friends and family and funerals and trials and the Ministry, and in a fit of irritated pique one morning, when he was running late to a memorial service at Hogwarts because he couldn’t get his damn curls to cooperate, he used the same spell he used to shave his face on his scalp, and showed up with a buzz-cut that set the entire crowd of mourners and reporters and looky-lous muttering amongst themselves.
He slumps down against the floor, panting for breath, and Draco waves his hand hurriedly to Vanish the bindings, crouching down and Summoning the glass of warm water from his nightstand. He helps Harry straighten, holds the glass until he’s had at least half of it, then pulls him to his feet and guides him to their bed.
Ron is still not-so-discreetly trying to get a look at Malfoy’s work, edging closer to the table as he talks, Hermione’s books forgotten. Harry rolls his eyes and, after nodding brusquely at Malfoy, turns on his heel and goes back to find Hermione, doing his best to ignore his embarrassing friend, though his best efforts can’t block out Malfoy’s loud grousing.
—” He trails off and meets Draco’s eyes firmly. “More than anything, I wish I hadn’t let my...my personal feelings, my own grievances, get in the way of ensuring these cases were investigated utilizing
Draco pulls back and gasps in a breath. “Touch yourself,” he orders, and Harry’s hand flies down to his own cock. “I want to feel you come on my tongue.”
He doesn’t need to finish his sentence, though, because just then the Floo flares, and Ron’s voice is heard calling, “Cheers, mate!” before he whirls into view and steps out of the grate, brushing ash off his shoulders and Vanishing it before it hits the carpet. He’s slightly pink, and he’s got dark circles under his eyes, but he’s—smiling? “Harry! Hermione! Merlin, did you invite over the entire Trainee class? Who’s all this food for?”
“Of course he did,” Draco says smugly. “I’m a bloody fantastic shag. It’s a point of pride. But trust me…” one hand wanders down to squeeze Harry’s arse, while the other fondles Harry’s now nearly-erect cock, “...you’ve absolutely nothing to worry about. I have very firm ideas of what I want in a partner, and Weasley would
Draco attempts a smirk. “Are you volunteering for the job? I’ll warn you now, it comes with almost no benefits whatsoever.”
that, it’s clear Harry hadn’t even heard him come in (and how could he, god, those sounds are going straight to Draco’s cock), but he feels frozen to the ground, and then Harry’s head twists out from the pillow and he chokes out “
working relationship.” He slips his glasses off, folding the arms and setting them neatly on the table.
They continue on like that, Harry perfectly in place except for involuntary twitches when one of Draco’s strikes is particularly hard, or in a sensitive spot, and even when he’s trembling and covered in goosebumps he never misses a count.
Draco sneers. “One of the Travers’ get, no doubt. They never did have any taste—or money. This would have been some distant cousin trying to impress the main branch of the family by overdoing the ward spells, no doubt; I’m not surprised it’s fallen off the record books, who’d want to claim this pile?” He sounds like a complete snob, he knows, but really, the house is hideous.
He finds himself looking at his watch repeatedly as he wolfs down lunch, and as he’s reviewing the care plan for a patient they’re about to send up to Janus Thickey, and as he’s scrawling in notes on a new admit’s chart. He’s not distracted, of course he’s not, he’s wholly focused on his work and would never endanger his patients, but there’s a little bit of his brain ticking away at the back, wondering
Suppressing a shudder at the memory, Draco pastes a no-doubt unconvincing smile as he approaches. “Alright, Potter; Bill put you on this one too?”
“Fine,” Harry grumbles, pawing at Malfoy’s arm until Malfoy hisses in annoyance, transfers his grip from Harry’s elbow to his hand, and Apparates them to Grimmauld Place. Harry doesn’t remember anything after that.

Harry’s hand sneaks around to Draco’s cock and begins to stroke, long, languorous pulls that are about half the speed of his thrusts into Draco’s arse.
