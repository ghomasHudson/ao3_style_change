He made a move towards his suite, but his mother had a firm grasp on his arm, and commandeered him against his will into the sitting room. He almost sputtered when he saw who was there. Immediately, his Malfoy Mask slid into place, and he at once transformed into the well-bred heir who needed to impress everyone who mattered.
"I'm sorry," she said, still with a sigh. "I guess I'm just... well I'm a bit embarrassed about it but I guess I was taken aback by all of you being here, just having fun..."
"Ah..." Malfoy said meaningfully. "But that seems so volatile of a reason to bond together, don't you think? The wizard's way is much more stable and sensible."
Harry read it out loud. "Dirigible Plum...Dirigible Plum!" He turned towards Ron, suddenly excited. "No fucking way!"
"Sorry," Harry mumbled. "I didn't mean for you all to be bothered by all of it..."
"Is it because of the smaller proportion of wizards to Muggles?"
"Were they bad?"
Draco remembered the
bindings? It's too much for just this... situation."
"It won't be much next to Ginevra Weasley-Potter, star Chaser of the Harpies."
He looked over at his godson, who was sprawled out in front of the fire, playing with the enchanted Lego bricks that Hermione had given him last Christmas. Harry liked spoiling Teddy, because it was important to him to provide everything that he lacked when he was at that age. With a pang, he realized that he had been that very age when the Dursleys had placed most, if not all the chores under his responsibility. He had never thought about it, but perhaps this was what it was like for Malfoy when he pictured Harry's own childhood? His eyes suddenly flared at the thought of little Teddy Lupin slaving in front of the stove, scrubbing surfaces around the house and sleeping in a cupboard-
Harry immediately sought out Ginny. Sure enough he found her in one corner of the kitchen, behind her mother. Her big smile otherwise hid her rising impatience, which was already obvious to him but apparently missed by all the other guests in their home.
"Because, you have a family name to uphold, and not appearing with your wife in events that she organizes is unbecoming of a Malfoy."
Harry's train of thought turned serious in a heartbeat when he sensed the undertone in Draco's statement. "It really bothers you, doesn't it? That I do this for you?"
he thought
Well, except for Malfoy.
"Do you want to marry me, right now, at this very moment, do you love me enough to just say yes happily with all your heart?"
At the far end of the corridor, he saw the elder Weasley throw him a thankful look, and Draco nodded before turning back and heading to the nearest cafe, a confused-looking Potter in tow.
"Give it up, Hermione," Potter waved her off, still laughing.
Harry tried to follow her train of thought. "You're taking this awfully well," he said with a frown. "I was afraid of confronting you about this, you know."
"Draco and Astoria Malfoy!" came a voice from the doorway, evidently the
Potter broke the silence.
"Nonsense," Draco argued. "She and I were brought up with the same customs and expectations. We have already delayed begetting heirs. I'm quite sure that she has her reasons for acting out."
"Sure," Harry confirmed, sounding more confident. "It's a safe place, my wards on you will be extra strong while you're here, and it's not like the place is crowded. You can take one of the rooms in the third floor."
Despite the threat hovering just beyond the horizon, Draco had to admit that Harry's suggestion for him to continue with his daily routine made the next few weeks much more bearable. Not only could he fluidly move as he had from habit, (still having to travel around and meet with associates concerning his various business dealings) but he also constantly felt the tug of the
Harry knew he had a shit-eating grin on his face, but he didn't care. For the first time in a while, he didn't feel so alone in Grimmauld Place. "Great," he said, somewhat anticlimactically.
at playing house?"
Hermione took another deep breath, which Draco guessed meant she was having a hard time explaining this in simple terms.
Of course, it didn't escape his attention that she hadn't even tried to persuade him. She never did anymore, perhaps understanding his strong preference now to stay home rather than play the social butterfly game like they used to. He didn't think it was a matter of necessity anymore, and he honestly believed that his wife could effectively continue her role as international diplomat without him at her side all the time. He still managed his private consultancies and Potions Mastery, so it was back to the time when they both supported each other's ambitions. The only difference was that he had more flexible hours and she had to be at every event she organized.
"Hm," Potter said noncommittally. "Interesting. I'm pretty sure the Weasleys don't follow that particular tradition. Molly has mentioned once or twice how she named her children from someone special to her."
Funny how, just two years ago, Draco had had no other pursuits in life but to provide for his wife, and to build the Malfoy reputation. Now that he was faced with a serious threat, it was ironic how he was slowly realizing just how much he had to lose.
It was a bad habit of Harry's to mentally prepare himself if he was having a good run of anything, whether in his personal life or when working a case. Perhaps he had been conditioned (badly) by his experiences, but he had long since believed that whenever he had a run of successes for any extended amount of time, his luck usually turned against him at the last second. Something always went wrong. Which meant he was almost always on edge, ensuring that he would be ready when it came.
He knew this was probably the first of a growing list of bad news they were going to get in the next few days. Knowing his luck, it probably wasn't the worst, either.
mind map will look like, Harry."
The man snorted. "You sure about that? Coz my name sure ain't anything close to William Howe. Man served his purpose, though."
Harry noted the mingling of a serious tone under a joking one. "Yeah, well, all three of us are already bona fide parents," he told Malfoy, shrugging. "It's like a huge part of our instinct is to smother new parents and welcome them into the fold as embarrassingly as possible."
Draco was just putting down a sleeping Scorpius into his floating bassinet when Libby the elf popped in to announce a fire call. When he was informed of who was calling, he immediately rushed to the nearest fire (only one of the many to be found scattered about in the Manor for convenience, of course).
"They definitely like you better, though," Ginny pouted. "That much is obvious."
, Malfoy thought to himself.
Draco had no words to that. He had no idea that all of his reports were sent to the Minister himself. They had been simple interviews, which admittedly had grown into a tentative civility with his Aurors, who provided him with interesting conversations in the midst of asking him the routine questions. He thought it was just protocol that he needed to complete throughout his probation, not something that people would actually go through and read! Suddenly he had way too many questions to ask, and no idea how to begin.
It was also a blessing that Potter didn't seem the kind of person to push for information. While Draco sat silently and sipped on his hot tea, the Auror merely leaned back into his chair and waited patiently. Perhaps all the time interrogating criminals gave him enough experience to know when someone didn't want to talk. He could probably wring it out of him, as Draco had already observed once before in the Ministry. He was grateful, therefore, for Potter's quiescence.
Everyone thought it was impossible, but when they saw Harry give an even brighter smile, they groaned. Harry ignored them.
"You're meant to be asleep by now, love," he said quietly, admonishing her as gently as he could. "You're too close to the day, and the Healer did say you'd have to get as much rest as you can."
"By the time I went to Hogwarts, he would always boast about me being the perfect Slytherin, and the perfect heir. Those, of course, were two things my younger self had aimed for. It wasn't until… after fourth year, when the Dark Lord returned."
Draco mused to himself.
Draco couldn't help but laugh. "I asked the same thing before."
"Speak for yourself. I've been way ahead."
him. I will
"Anyway," she continued, "are you quite sure you'll be alright just staying here? There's always still the option of having the elves keep Scorpius for the night while we stay in-"
"We do have the advantage of working close with the Office of Malicious Magical Intent," he called towards the hearth where his mother's face flared with determination.
Hermione gave him a small smile - a bit tense but reassuring all the same. "It's just a matter of logistics at this point. I'd rather they know where to find me rather than worry about me missing from my home when I'm expected to be there."
"Yes, of course," Potter said. "To be honest, though, I just wanted to thank you for that chunk of research you sent in to us with your letter. It's the only reason we're able to keep the investigation up without your direct interference."
"When do you plan to tell them?" Hermione asked.
Draco was carrying an enthusiastic Scorpius around the grounds of their French manor, safe within its wards, when the popping sound of a house elf's appearance startled both of them.
Or, well, the
Harry didn't expect Malfoy to come in until after lunch, so he spent the morning briefing the team he assembled from his MMI personnel. Ron, of course, had to be the Auror-in-Charge, since Harry was barred from active duty and could only act as supervising Auror. Ernie Macmillan had volunteered, having become one of Malfoy's better friends within the Auror Corps. With them were two other Aurors, Ella Perkins and Apollo Rogers, who were much younger but highly commended for their specializations in Tracking and Surveillance.
Harry perked up a bit. Perhaps he was overthinking things again, but he couldn't deny the feeling of foreboding he had in his gut. "Hm?" he asked noncommittally, hoping she would get to the point.
At his words, something in Harry's brain suddenly clicked into place.
Harry gave her a pointed look. "Again, too late for any epiphanies. But really, we have to figure out the rest of the way. So far, I've been able to juggle going to the Ministry and working from home. And you've been able to talk Odair into a more lenient schedule. Where do we go from here?"
"You did what you could, Draco," Harry whispered sincerely. "No matter what your Father may have wanted for you, to follow in his footsteps or become the perfect pureblood heir…You've done well in the last few years. Clearly, your mother is proud of everything you've accomplished for the family name. You're in no one's shadow."
blocking the Black genes from Scorpius' DNA…"
"How many more has Malfoy deciphered so far?" Ron asked, looking through another set of papers, this time with classifications of plants. About a third had been marked in red, to show which ingredients the potions master had already narrowed down in the last two weeks.
"Of course not, Weasley!" the blonde exclaimed defensively. "I am merely guaranteeing that all of Astoria's needs and wants are met. After all, I would be highly disappointed in myself if I were unable to fulfill the most basic stipulations of our contract."
She nodded. "It's something I felt you needed to know. I've already gone through all the ancestral documents we retain in the library and consulted every record of the Malfoy wards. The only logical explanation there is for the first letter to have come through is if it was invited by someone within."
"Alright," his wife replied, yawning. "Where will you be?"
"It's very you," Ginny laughed. "I like it."
The young witch beside him, Ella-something, Draco recalled, nodded her head. "That's right, Mr. Malfoy, Auror Potter can provide you with the necessary protection since it would be best for you to carry on your usual activities. It would throw off the suspect and make him wonder why his initial threat did not cause you to panic."
He also noticed little things that Malfoy never really had to say out loud or point out. Like how the man turned his nose up at anything sugary but loved chocolate. And how he had this weird tic of scratching at the second button of his shirt when he was nervous. Oh, and Harry was pretty sure he could zero in on the brand of cologne Malfoy used, since he had most certainly been wearing the same thing forever. Little things like that, stuff that didn't matter.
"Are you so sure?" Draco asked softly, his words seeking reassurance.
Upon hearing this, both Draco and Daphne blanched, avoiding each other's gaze. Draco turned instead to his mother, who had an odd look on her face.
"No, no," Narcissa insisted. "I realized my mistake. You see, I knew Scorpius was one of your sources of pride and happiness, and he was with you when you went away. It is clearer to me now that I have had some time to reconsider...I did not want Astoria to hear any of this, because she might demand much more from you than she already has. You have already done everything to prove yourself to her, and there is no reason why you should feel the slightest bit of insecurity in that regard. No, I see now that it is your friendships that give you that aura of pure joy, which I so enjoy seeing."
"Yes, of course we all knew. Obviously, you didn't stick to our expectations, seeing as you arrived about eight hours in advance."
In light of his efforts to prove himself despite his darker past, rumours have spread that even the Minister himself has forged a working relationship with the Malfoy Heir. As reported before, Mr. Malfoy is an accomplished Potions Master, with an exceptional academic and professional record in France. This highly determined Prophet correspondent can confirm that the Ministry has in fact secured Mr. Malfoy's professional services, though the specific area or department is still being kept confidential. In any case, this is groundbreaking for the Malfoy family, and it is obvious that despite the previous collective scorn for their names, the new husband and wife have proven to be new favorite stars of Wizarding Society. The Daily Prophet offers our congratulations to the happy couple, and are looking forward to covering the upcoming Society Ball to be held at Malfoy Manor next month.
“Have a lovely time,” Narcissa said.
Draco tried not to seethe at the fact that apparently the whole world was aware of Harry Potter’s private life, but no one had thought to fill him in. Not that it was any of his business, he supposed. Still, he couldn’t help but feel as though he should have been informed. Sighing and trying not to look too hard at that particular feeling, he went back to his stack of invitations.
Draco tried to believe him.
Although he chimed in to the conversation here or there, Draco spent most of the meal observing fondly as Teddy gesticulated wildly while explaining things like the massive size and power of the sun to an apparently-rapt Harry. Harry glanced over at him from time to time with a conspiratorial smile, winking at Draco when he caught him hiding a grin at Teddy’s increasingly-fanciful interpretations of the facts. Draco did his very best to pretend that those smiles weren’t pushing him toward a complete meltdown. He didn’t realize that his inner turmoil was obvious until he caught his mother and aunt giving him twin amused glances, causing him to blush and turn his full attention to his pasta.
“Er, good morning?” Harry tried. Now that Draco was awake, he was petrified at the idea of standing and drawing attention to the... situation... happening below his waist. He tried to think of the least sexy things he could imagine, but found it rather difficult to concentrate with a sleep-rumpled Draco Malfoy
“Harry. Looking good, as always,” Blaise said, giving Harry a very blatant once over. “And how is Ginevra?”
Pansy shrugged. “He makes me laugh. And he’s got a cock the size of a—”
“Ah, good.” Lucius had glanced only briefly at Draco before returning his attention to the paper. “I was about to send an elf for you. Thaddeus and I reached an agreement on the betrothal last night; it will be announced at the game today.”
His mouth on your cock and your heart in the stars
There’s still a second bedroom set up for him, but he doesn’t use it. Honestly, we’ve stopped pretending that he ever intended to; it’s just where he stores his stuff. Which is super useful, because he’s stupid levels of particular about his clothes (despite stealing my favorite hoodie at least twice a week), and he’d probably strangle me if I organized them incorrectly. He’s got a system. It’s ridiculously complicated. It’s also kind of cute.
As they poured over ridiculously priced produce, Harry had a moment of regret that he hadn’t let Hermione have her way. He hadn’t wanted to have his vacation be too strictly structured, but planning five and a half days worth of meals on the fly had turned out to be a bit more complicated than he’d expected. Still, by the end of their trip, they had filled the boot of the car with bags upon bags of dry goods, vegetables, fruits, and meats. A second stop filled the half of the back seat that wasn’t taken up by Ron with what seemed, to Harry, to be a rather ridiculous amount of alcohol, but Ron and Greg were adamant that it was in no way excessive for nine people on a week-long vacation.
“I’m predictably impulsive,” Harry answered, feeling slightly sheepish. “Honestly, I realized how weird this was right before I saw you and almost turned around. I can still leave, if you want.”
Luckily, Pansy and Blaise were easy to spot in the crowd, Blaise being a good few inches taller than most of the people around them.
Once the idea of them watching “Love, Actually” came to me, I couldn’t resist. I have such a love/hate relationship with that movie. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this little scene of domestic fluffiness!
“Draco, Harry! Jesus.”
“So, when that wasn’t working, he started saying that all my friends are just riding my coattails. He said some really nasty shit about Ginny. And then he started in on Ron.”
“Hello there!” Hilde said, not very successfully feigning enthusiasm.
“You didn’t need to.” Draco gave him a self satisfied smirk. Harry hit him with a pillow.
He stopped as he reached land, covering his face in his hands. A moment later, a pair of arms wrapped around him, pulling him in against a warm, comfortingly familiar-smelling chest. “I’m so sorry,” Draco murmured against his hair. Unable to hold it in, Harry began to sob.
Over the following weeks, it became clear that “keeping it quiet” was going to be more complicated than either Draco or Harry had anticipated. They had exchanged a few owls at first, but when Harry told Draco that Ron and Hermione were getting a bit nosy about who he was talking to, he’d had to agree that they should do so only when necessary. He knew that Granger was far too astute to miss the fact that all of Harry’s letters were being delivered by the same owl.
“No!” Now, the man was beginning to sound flustered. Excellent.
And then he thought of himself, waking up in New York two days from now in his perfectly nice apartment, in his perfectly nice neighborhood, alone. No Harry in his bed. No Teddy to jump on his chest and demand he play dragons and dinosaurs. No mother and aunt downstairs to tease him and talk to him and include him in their lives like he belonged there.
“Fair enough. So what was it like living there? I mean, you were in England until you were ten or eleven, so it still must have been a bit of culture shock, I’d think.”
Somewhat apprehensively, Harry agreed.
To his surprise, he found Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn chatting near the fireplace in the library, each with a glass of scotch in hand. “Draco, my boy!” Slughorn greeted him rather tipsily, and Draco gave an internal roll of his eyes as he put on a pleasant smile and went to join them. Apparently his status as
“Oh!” Draco relaxed, looking very pleased with himself. He sat back on his haunches and licked his lips, looking down at Harry consideringly. “What’s your refractory period usually like?”
“According to who?” Draco asked, looking genuinely surprised. “I’m around them all day long, and I’ve never heard them talk about anything interesting.”
“Don’t ask,” Harry sighed, getting to his feet and rotating his stiff ankles. “Where’s Blaise?”
Taking a final pull from the cigarette, he stubbed it out and eased himself from the bed, retreating to the en suite, where a hot, soothingly-scented bath was already waiting for him. Clossy was old hat at Draco’s post-sex routines, as well as the variations thereon when ‘post-sex’ was also ‘post-breakup’: the water was perfect, there was a glass of red wine waiting, and he knew that the sheets would have been changed and the room straightened before he emerged. It would be as though Max had never been there.
“Okay. Great. I’ll see you then.” He held Draco’s gaze for a few moments longer, and Draco felt everything in his chest clenching as his smile faltered slightly. Harry blinked and looked away. “Right. Happy Christmas, all of you. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Blaise looked genuinely sympathetic. “I’m sorry, Harry.”
Hilde cheered up a bit over dinner, which was a rather nice picnic spread, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to fully reengage with her after her behavior that afternoon. There was nothing wrong with not liking kids, he supposed, although he wished she would have said something before now. He thought he’d been pretty open about wanting some of his own, but it was possible he hadn’t been as explicit as he could have been. But the way she’d treated them had made him sincerely rethink his opinion of her. He could handle the fact that a day with a bunch of children wasn’t her cup of tea, but the fact that she hadn’t bothered to hide how much she didn’t want to be there, and that she didn’t seem to care that her attitude could make the kids feel bad, troubled him.
“You just need to remember to keep the tips of your skis pointed inward,” Sullivan told him, encouragingly.
“I think I preferred the boat while it was still floating,” Draco answered weakly.
Draco was sneaking into his room in the middle of the night because… Greg snored?
When he walked into the room that served as the camp’s main space, Harry was immediately mobbed by small children. “Mister Harry, Mister Harry! You’re back!”
“I didn’t mean anything by it,” Draco said, feeling unfairly chastened. “I spent time with some of them the other night at the Three Broomsticks, and it was perfectly fine.” He thought back on George draping himself over Pansy and cringed. “Mostly.”
“You mean the one I said no to?” Potter responded, looking somewhere between irritated and amused.
“Yeah?”
“I’m sorry, mate, but Verona won’t make any exceptions, not even for you. You’re suspended for the rest of the season. You and Smith, both.”
“You’re on.”
“No. Well, I mean, yeah, it did, but not— everything’s fine. I just.” Now that he was standing here, he realized that he had absolutely no idea what to say.
Harry meandered back inside, feeling much more sober than he had a few minutes ago. Trying to shake off the lingering guilt over Gabrielle, he scanned the crowd. The only person he hadn’t had a chance to dance with yet, he realized, was Sullivan. And thinking back on how the man had looked earlier in the night, he admitted to himself that he really,
awkward, and I really like you but I just—”
said a little voice in the back of Draco’s mind,
Harry snickered and squeezed the tender skin, forcing an embarrassingly needy whimper from Draco, before moving his thumbs inward to brush the edges of his exposed hole. “What do you want?” he asked, holding Draco’s gaze.
“I have no idea what to say to any of that.”
Most Eligible Bachelor for the tenth year running. In the early days, it had mostly just been funny. Harry’d had no interest in settling down, then, content just to be allowed to live his life after so many years of having to fulfill the expectations of others. He’d found it baffling that, despite being neither employed nor what he would consider anything like conventionally attractive—with his thick glasses, many scars, untameable hair, and still-gangly build—so many witches apparently found him desirable. His friends had found how confused he was about the whole thing hilarious and had teased him endlessly.
Harry tried, dragging in a breath that was more a gasp, letting it out with a shudder.
“I mean, I’m over here pretty often to see Teddy, so.”
“Stop being so dramatic.”
Harry frowned. “Of course I am.”
“So what was the plan, then?”
“Hah!”
“Awesome.”
Draco allowed himself to be pulled into the shop and down an aisle; Teddy had obviously been here many times and knew exactly where Harry’s crafts were shelved. They rounded a corner, and Draco came face to face with a tall, thin tree covered in delicately carved animals, slithering and climbing and flitting about within its branches. A snake with carefully articulated scales curled itself around the trunk, flickering its tiny wooden tongue from time to time. Draco noted several dragons similar to the ones that Teddy kept in his room. He carefully stroked the neck of a little owl, which fluffed its miniscule carved feathers under his touch and turned its head to look at him.
It wasn’t too much later than Harry returned, a bundled-up Teddy in tow. “Right, we’re off, then! We’ll be back by dinner.” Teddy was all but bouncing in excitement, obviously eager to be off.
The words didn’t make any sense to Harry. He stayed frozen where he was, eyes blurring until—
Her eyes trailed up his legs before they met his eyes, and she grinned. “I can’t feel my arms. But the view’s not bad.” She winked cheekily at him, and Harry snorted, reaching a hand down to help her up. “Come on, the worst is over. It’s all cocktails and hot tubs from here on out.”
And with that cryptic statement, she left.
She opened the various ingredients and demonstrated, skewering a marshmallow on one of the long sticks (after giving it a good
“Fair enough.” They fell into a companionable silence, their arms close enough to feel each other’s warmth. After a while, Harry spoke again. “Joking aside, I’m not particularly interested in a sports rivalry dictating who I spend my time with. You?”
of time trying not to dwell on the attractiveness of—was in his bed. Draco Malfoy was in his bed,
“Well, we haven’t decided anything officially,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s hand, “but I’m pretty confident in saying that it’s time to pass that crown on for good.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at her. Over the years, he’d come to realize that she took more than a little after Fred and George, and he found the glint in her eye rather suspect. Ron, however—rather naively, in Harry’s opinion—seemed to take her word for it. Taking a running start, he cannonballed off the end of the pier, sending up a wave of murky water that (luckily for him) didn’t quite reach where Blaise was distributing margaritas.
Harry squinted at Draco, trying to parse his tone of voice before shrugging internally. He pushed the button for elf service and flopped into one of his armchairs, yawning widely. “Everything okay?”
Blaise looked theatrically intrigued. “How has he done that?”
“Hi, I’m Dermot,” he said with a dazzling smile, reaching out to shake Harry’s hand firmly. “I’m so pleased to be here.”
“Well, now I’m too curious not to.”
, how had Harry not noticed the resemblance before?
“I think I’ll go back into the woods for a bit; if I can’t find a Wampus cat, I may at least be able to see some of the other local wildlife.”
Harry groaned in defeat as Draco withdrew, giving him a victorious smirk. “I hate you.”
“French toast sounds amazing.” He poured himself a cup of coffee and sat at the table, watching Harry work.
“Hey. Harry. Hey.” A warm hand rubbed circles on his back; Draco stood next to him, his Disillusionment charm seeping away, revealing him piece by piece as though he was being painted onto the air itself. “Shh, it’s okay. Breathe.”
“Sort of. Hmm. Purge the parts that were hostile towards you, I suppose?”
turn this around.
“Not helpful, Gin.” Harry helped Draco to his feet, where he wavered unsteadily for a moment. “You ready?”
“Is it?” Draco asked, feigning confusion. “No, that can’t be right.”
He placed a mandrake leaf underneath his tongue and waited for lightning to strike.
Eventually, Teddy and his friend tired themselves out, and Harry convinced Teddy that it was time to go home. He whinged a bit at first, claiming that he was fine, but by the time Draco had returned their rental skates and come back to the bench where he’d left them, he was slumped against Harry’s side, fast asleep.
“And then your career would never get back on track,” Draco said sagely, his eyes falling closed. “I don’t believe they allow the dead in the professional league.” His hands reached the bottom of Harry’s shirt and slid beneath the hem, seeking skin.
liked him. He was passionate and funny and affectionate and self deprecating in a way that made it obvious that he wasn’t just being modest; he truly didn’t think that he was anything special. To him, his role in the war was mostly incidental, and he hadn’t done much of note since. He clearly had no idea of the magnetic appeal he radiated.
“I don’t understand why not! You’re handsome, wealthy, successful. It’s not as though you should have trouble attracting a partner.”
“We weren’t always so insular,” he admitted as they paused on a newly-constructed bridge across the lake, “despite what many of the old families would have us believe. There have always been those drawn to power, no matter who wielded it.” He leant against the wall, looking out across the water.
“I’m not marrying Astoria Greengrass,” Draco said flatly, not moving.
“Fine,” Harry sighed. “Goodnight.”
Perry stared at him. “What, exactly, did Sadiyah tell you?”
Blaise gave him an unapologetic grin. “Well, I know that, but our audience might not. Are you and he close outside of the show?”
Harry laughed, and Draco realized with embarrassment that he must have said that out loud. He shrugged internally. “Well, it’s only fair,” he insisted.
“I’m not creeping, I’m assessing,” Draco objected.
as Jack (she uses she/her, but has heavy andro-butch energy. Jack is… well, who knows). If you head cast any of the other characters, I’d love to hear who!
“I have no idea what you mean.”
They had just parted ways with a disturbingly realistic mummy that had turned out to be Dean Thomas wrapped in artfully-done papier-mâché when Ron’s eyes went wide. “Oh, come
“Is it?”
Finally, Harry and Draco were deposited in a bar near the entrance that was obviously designed to hold dozens of people but in which they were entirely alone but for a single bartender. Harry looked to Draco to see what happened now.
much for taking her on such short notice,” she apologized before noticing Draco sitting next to him. “Oh! Hello, Draco. Oh no, did you two have plans?” She looked distressed. “Harry, you should have said!”
I am playing fast and loose with privacy laws here re: Teddy but whatever. It's fiction.
Perry, who had been calming down, burst into laughter again and wrapped his arms around Harry. “Fuck, I’m sorry, it’s not funny, it’s just—”
“I remember something about that, yes.”
“I mean, we’re not really taking care of them, just hanging out and playing with them for a bit, and then we’ll have dinner after.”
would never hurt anyone on purpose. You’re just… a bit clueless. Which I am apparently into, because I like you a lot, unfortunately for me.” He sighed. “But I’ll get over it. Besides,” he added, “Sadiyah told me that in the Muggle version of this show, the runner-up usually gets to be the next Bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever. So who knows. Maybe someone will be sabotaging my shitty dates this time next year.”
“Well, Cormac’s always been a bit of a tit, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he got on people’s nerves pretty quickly. Other than that? I can’t figure out a damned thing about Jack, so who knows, maybe they’ll get up to something sketchy when they think no one’s looking.”
“I don’t—”
Draco laughed. “This is awful. Should we turn around?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s first two solo dates don’t go as planned—largely because one of them doesn’t show up. Featuring a distillery trip, a baking class, and an extremely petty Draco Malfoy.
“How long until they start snogging, do you think?”
“Mister Harry, come see my painting!”
“Absolutely not.”
Harry huffed out a laugh and did as he was told, sliding off the bed briefly to pull their shoes and socks off before slipping Draco’s trousers and pants down and off, leaving him completely naked. Climbing back onto the mattress, he knelt for a moment, running his hands up and down Draco’s thighs, making him shiver. His gaze was hungry as he took in Draco’s prone form. “God,” he breathed, before unceremoniously moving to lie on his stomach and taking Draco into his mouth.
“But you

“Thank you; I made it myself.”
“Ah.” By unspoken agreement, they started walking again. “Thanks for telling me.”
Harry groaned and dropped his forehead to the tabletop. “I moved there to get
His hair, now dry, was still a mess of wild curls, but they were smoother, softer, shinier. The chaos looked intentional rather than like he’d been attacked by a bird of prey and not bothered to do anything about it afterward. Harry ran his fingers through it, looking awestruck. “What that actual fuck?”
He was still riding high when he sauntered into Harry and Weasley’s office on Wednesday. He leaned ostentatiously over Harry’s desk, stretching almost directly over his perpetually-tousled head to grab a piece of chalk and carefully add six perfectly straight tally marks to his own side of the board, giving him the lead by three.
It’s over before I can fully register that it’s happening; he flops back onto his back and says “sorry,” but it’s a sorry like when you bump into someone in the kitchen, not a sorry like ‘I’m mortified that I just did that.’ I tell him it’s fine, casually, like my brain isn’t trying to process seven thousand thoughts at once, and we go back to listening to ‘Tonight, Tonight.’ I can’t tell if the ache in my chest is from the strings or from the kiss.
Draco watched as Harry allowed himself to be dragged around haphazardly, laughing and chatting with Teddy about everything that drew the child’s attention. They looked so happy together. Teddy’s hair was currently the messy black mop it had been when Draco first saw him, giving the two a distinctly familial resemblance, and he clung tightly to Harry with one hand, waving animatedly with the other as he spoke. Harry listened to him intently and grinned regularly, obviously delighted to be here, sharing this with his godson. Draco tried to stay a few paces behind them, letting them enjoy their time together, but every time he dropped back for more than a couple minutes, one or the other would draw him into the conversation, clearly trying to ensure that he was included.
“Yes.”
“Do you even like me?” he asks one day.
“Well. I know you don’t want to give frontrunners right now, and that’s fine, but it would also be helpful to know if there’s anyone who you think might cause drama. I know you didn’t want to speak badly of anyone on the record, but we need footage of the bad bits just as much as the good. So, have you got anything for me?”
Green, like new beginnings.
Draco bumps his shoulder against Harry’s. “Fuck off.” And then, “I love you, too.”
Fourteen sets of eyes gazed expectantly up at him, and Harry had to close his own eyes for a moment to brace himself. Opening them again, he made eye contact with a tall, perfectly coiffed and immaculately dressed blond. “William.”
Harry thinks, dazedly, that Grimmauld Place has a much smaller footprint than he would have imagined. Maybe there had been Wizarding space involved.
to want things, I don’t think.”
The door swung open onto a cozy room with horizontally paneled wooden walls in a warm, caramel tone; thick carpets; a large, squashy looking sofa; and a small, square dinner table already set for two. In front of the sofa, there was a fire crackling merrily in a brick fireplace. The only other feature was a door that presumably led to the bedroom. Harry supposed the bathroom must be connected.
“What’s your name?” Harry asked as the elf placed the tray on the table for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Draco said from behind him, sounding petulant.
“You’re so fucking tight, holy shit, you feel so good.”
Perry looked sheepish. “Well, growing up, we always had house… erm, help,” he caught himself. They’d been warned to try to stick to Muggle-safe language, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder why on earth Draco and Pansy had thought that one of the only pureblood contestants was a good choice for this particular venue. “And these days I mostly live on toast, takeaway, and terrible food from the hospital canteen.”
“Fine.” Draco scuffed his toe against the bridge and sighed again. “I need to get back. I have things to get in place for tomorrow.” Turning, he walked away, not looking back once as he returned to the house. Harry watched him go, something odd happening in his chest, until he was out of sight.

he’s already looking back—green eyes daring, making sure you see before he turns to leave—and you
that was inexplicably told by a combination of puppets and humans. Draco expected it to be awful but found himself immediately engrossed, and by the time the spirit of Christmas past departed, he was blinking back tears. He tried to wipe his eyes surreptitiously, but Harry noticed and looked up at him.
It was soft—just a press of lips, nothing profound—but Harry immediately felt something inside of him unfurling, like a piece of himself had been wrapped up tightly in twine and had finally been cut free.
Once the door closed behind Pansy, leaving the two of them alone, Draco turned his full attention back to Harry. “It really will only be a few minutes, I promise. I just want to make sure I’m seeing all of the angles while I’m setting things up tomorrow.”
“I’m sorry,

together. Once the buzz of new relationship energy had run its course, there just wasn’t anything left to work with. And he had honestly tried. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want a relationship; he very much did. But he was only 26—he wasn’t ready to resign himself to one that was just
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, feeling himself blush a little. It was rare that Draco was this genuine; usually any thanks he gave were couched in insults to hide any hint of vulnerability. “Ready to get up?”
“Why do you say that like it’s the fucking moon?”
“I suppose.” Draco looks skeptical.
“Would you like to stop getting in the way and open whatever you brought tonight, Harry?” Andromeda asked from where she was still chopping vegetables at the other end of the island.
Christ. He was beginning to sober up a bit, and the numbness that came with being several whiskys deep was fading, giving way to a sharper pain than he’d expected. He gingerly traced a scrape across his cheek with a fingertip, vaguely remembering the glint of a ring on a huge, meaty fist as it flew at his face, and winced. He might have gotten a bit overambitious in his choice of opponent tonight. Still, he’d had worse.
I really enjoyed writing this chapter and thinking through what all of Draco’s thought processes would be at this point in time. Because we’re living on story time (and fluffy story time, at that), I think it sometimes feels like things like falling in love or deciding to uproot your life are quick and simple and uncomplicated. In reality, a choice like Draco is facing is huge, and he and Harry—as the people they are now—have only known each other for three weeks. From an outside perspective, the choice seems straightforward, but for Draco I think it really wouldn’t be.
“Congratulations! Muggle?”
“Fuck off,” Harry repeated grumpily.
“Which is why I don’t,” William said with a sniff. “If I want to be outdoors, I can take one of the horses out or take my tea on the veranda. This is plebeian nonsense.”
It started slow, Harry’s palm gentle against his jaw and his lips warm and soft against Draco’s, but somehow it still felt a bit like the ground was crumbling under his feet. At the first swipe of Harry’s tongue, Draco thought his vision might have whited out. Soon, unable to take Harry’s leisurely exploration any longer, he pulled Harry closer, taking the kiss deeper. Harry laughed a little but still reciprocated enthusiastically, his hands moving to Draco’s waist to bring their bodies flush.
They talked on and off, their conversation meandering as they watched the stars emerge. They talked about Sullivan’s huge, dopey dog, Scout, whom he obviously adored. Harry shared a few stories about helping Hagrid out with his menagerie of bizarre magical creatures. They’d been discussing Sullivan’s love of adventure and trying new extreme sports when they stumbled directly into the war.
“Because I called Vamp Willow before you thought of it, and that’s disgusting,” Ginny chimed in, smirking up at him. “Suck it up, buttercup.” Her tight corset pushed her otherwise-modest breasts upward rather impressively, and Harry spared a moment to think that she really had been wasted on him and his then-undiscovered homosexuality. From an objective, aesthetic standpoint, she looked hot as hell.
Malfoy shot a mischievous smile his way. “Why bother? I know what I like, and I go for it. Save the games for the pitch.”
,” Draco went on, glaring at her, “I was running short on things that I know you like that aren’t boring—”
“You don’t,” he said, smiling as the hand splayed over his chest.
When Draco answered, Harry curled further in on himself, hating how distressed he sounded. “I don’t… Harry,
was on Blaise.”
Harry grimaced. “I know. Fuck. Sorry. Can we start this over?”
“Yeah, just, she’s teething,” Harry responded, and both she and Narcissa winced. “She’s fine most of the time,” he added, “but she was having a particularly rough day and he was kind of overwhelmed.”
, he sighed inwardly. Then, with a jolt, he noticed that Harry’s name was not listed alone, but rather with a clearly written ‘and guest.’ An uncomfortable sinking feeling settled itself in his stomach. Skimming the list again, he saw that all of the solo names—including Pansy and Blaise—had the same addendum. Somehow, that didn’t make him feel any better.
“Yeah, I’m not promising that.”
“A dangerous artifact that we stole from a bank,” Ron countered, but he dutifully added more food to his plate before plopping back down next to Hermione.
Harry laughed. “Just don’t tell me how brave I am or anything and we’re good.”
Harry must have picked up on his tone, but apparently mistook the reason, because he hastened to add, “I totally get that you aren’t interested in starting anything, like, romantic, but I’d still like to spend some time with you while you’re here, if you’re up for it. Just, grab drinks or something.”
“You definitely did. It’s okay if you worship me, though. I get it.” Harry smirked.
“Seriously. But yeah, mostly that sort of thing. Last night he asked me probably a dozen questions about Draco, which was, like, extremely weird.”
“I— don’t want you to pick me.”
“Hilde.”
Afterward, they sat side by side on the floor, naked and breathing heavily. “I really, really do not want to walk downstairs past Narcissa and Andromeda,” Harry admitted.
had passed along with his father.
“Jealousy?”
“So, how come you were never at Hogwarts?” Harry asked as they queued for some new rollercoaster that did an alarming number of upside down loops and didn’t seem to have any respect for the laws of physics.
Once Hermione and Ron had turned in for the night, Harry had snuck out to the back garden with his broom and set course for Wiltshire. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, he just knew that he wanted to talk to Malfoy as soon as possible. The flight took over an hour, which gave him plenty of time to ask himself what the fuck he was thinking. What was he going to do, walk up to the front door? Fly around peeking in windows until he caught sight of Malfoy?
“Morning,” Draco said sleepily, turning to face him.
Draco’s silverware hit the table hard enough to startle Lucius out of his soliloquy.  “Stop. Just… stop talking. I’ve barely been back for a week; I do not have the energy to humor you and your...
the smirk that accompanied the statement, and he found himself, much to his own surprise, grinning. “Malfoy.” He looked the man over. He wore a slim-fitting grey suit just a shade darker than his eyes, making them pop. His hair was pulled back in a low bun, showing off a handful of small silver hoops and studs along his earlobes and cartilage.
“Parkinson!” Ron yelled. “You were just going to let everyone blame me?!”
Draco observed Potter for a moment, his strong back and muscular arms highlighted by his fitted button up, which strained slightly as he leant forward over his desk, going back to whatever he’d been working on. He wasn’t bad to look at these days, Draco had to admit. In fact, he’d gotten quite fit over the years, if he was being honest with himself. Rather hot, actually, if you were into powerful men with perpetually just-shagged looking hair. And they certainly had chemistry, albeit the kind that was rooted in years of bitter rivalry that had evolved into a sort of recreational antagonism when they’d become coworkers. Verbally sparring with Potter always got Draco’s adrenaline up. He wondered—
Narcissa gave him a pointed look. “Would you prefer to help me write up the timing for tomorrow’s food preparation?”
Draco gestured for him to continue.
It did not.
“Yeah, well, you wouldn’t, would you? Considering they were mostly talking about how clearly you were mooning over me.” Harry grinned and wiggled his eyebrows.
Draco had decanted one of the bottles of red while Hermione worked, and was now waving Ginny away as she attempted to pour herself a glass. “It needs at least ten more minutes, you heathen,” he berated her. “Hasn’t Pansy taught you
Draco leaned up enough to glare down at him. “You’re kidding, right?”
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “Well, isn’t that interesting? Do you think she suspected from the outset that things might develop a bit less...
Harry clapped, and was surprised to hear the rest of the room doing so, as well. It seemed that Dermot’s performance had drawn everyone else’s attention as much as it had Harry’s.
Harry grinned triumphantly. “All you had to do was ask,” he said, and Draco chucked a pillow at him. Laughing, he stood, removing his jeans and pants before moving up Draco’s body until they were face to face. “Hey there,” he said.
Draco didn’t answer, and Harry was afraid to breathe. After a moment, though, Harry felt a warm hand brush tentatively against his, pausing as though waiting to be stopped before carefully linking their fingers together. Harry closed his eyes, suddenly aware of every square millimeter of his skin as his captured hand was lifted toward Draco and warm lips pressed softly against his knuckles. His heart gave a little stutter. “You’re a fucking idiot,” Draco said, but his voice wobbled slightly. Harry opened his eyes and turned his head to find Draco watching him.
Draco exhaled. Damn her perceptiveness. “I’m enjoying getting to know him,” he conceded, fiddling with his fork, “but it’s nothing more than that.”

“Nothing wrong with a preview.” Perry winked, and Harry snorted.

was gossip, most of the time.
We just won! We’re on to the finals!” Hugh now looked positively apoplectic.
Harry followed not long after, burying his face in Draco’s neck to muffle a loud groan. Sliding out, he fell to the side, collapsing next to Draco. “Fucking hell.”
“How did he know?” Harry supposed he should be more disturbed by the casual way that Malfoy referenced being tortured, but he couldn’t muster the energy.
If he were to trace everything back to the beginning, Harry would have to admit that his current predicament was largely his own fault. He had, after all, been the one to introduce the Weasley clan to the concept of television.
“Better, I’d like to think.” She looked around her. “Well, this is a change from the Manor, isn’t it?”
were talking about how a relationship might work for us.”
“That’s the one with the angel and demon who are in love and trying to save the world, right?”
“Well, that’s disturbing to hear,” Draco grimaced. “But yes, investment banking.”
“Careful, there,” Harry said, catching Draco by the waistband without thinking, his fingers falling half on sodden fabric and half on bare skin, hot and slippery against his hands. Draco’s shorts were clinging even more noticeably to his form, now, and his torso was
And when I really stop to think about it, I think… I think he never really meant to leave me this house. I don’t know why I never realized that. Like, yeah, he made me his heir, but it wasn’t about the house. It was about…” The smile falters. “It was about family.”
. I thought I knew you!”
“Wonderful!” she said, again. “Now we’ll move on to the long pose. For this, you have free choice of what materials you’d like to use. We have charcoal, of course, but there’s also paint or pastels or even a quill and parchment if you prefer. We also have some beads and wire if you’d like to do a more abstract interpretation. Harry has a very colorful aura.”
Hilde laughed. “Well, better late than never, right? I’m glad to get a chance to know you now, anyway.”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Draco said dryly. “Another would be ‘absolutely livid with my supposed friend and co-producer, who apparently had me tailed by invisible cameras for the entirety of filming.’”
Perry gave Harry a mischievous smirk. “Not surprised you don’t remember me; I seem to recall you being pretty singularly focused on Draco Malfoy, when it came to my team.”
*****
“Stop saying it like that! You make it sound so dire; it’s only for a week!”
Harry sighed. A confirmation of some sort would have been too much to ask for, he supposed. “Look. Pansy. I get that you mean well, but Draco’s friendship is important to me. I’m not going to risk that by making some sort of confession. Okay?”
By the time they arrived back in London it was past sunset and, despite the time change, Harry was exhausted. They all gathered their luggage to head their separate ways, Harry and Draco enduring another round of teasing when Draco opted to stick with Harry rather than heading back to his own flat. Finally, however, they stood in the foyer of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, Harry breathing in the familiar smell of it with a mix of relief and melancholy. After a week away, it felt strange to be returning to the real world.
“Jesus.”
“I…” Harry could hear his own uncertainty reflected back at him, but still, when Draco went on, he sounded resolute. “Yes.”
“I believe so. Andromeda sent him upstairs to get dressed an hour ago. Although, he’s been worryingly quiet since then, now that I think on it. Draco, dear, would you mind going up to check on your cousin?”
Malfoy laughed. “You’re right, you haven’t gotten even a little bit smoother.”
“Oh, yeah, it was fine. A little awkward at first, but we got past it.”
“Yeah, I noticed. But, babe.” Harry steps forward again, taking Draco’s hand when he doesn’t back away. “You said it yourself. You were only getting rid of the hostile parts. This house… Draco, this house fucking hated me. And I hated it right back.”
“Well I think it sounds like fun,” said Ginny, chiming in from the kitchen table where she was sipping a beer and watching them in amusement. “How many people did you say this place could sleep?”
“I don’t think I’m up for apparating,” Draco said, and he sounded truly awful.
After resting for a while, they eventually collected their kayaks and Apparated back to the boathouse before heading back to the main house to clean up and recover. Harry took a long, hot shower before spreading a salve on his stinging hands and flopping onto his bed for a nap. He was going to miss naps, he thought, as he felt himself drift off. He should plan more naps in his daily life once they got back.
Draco grinned. “Some of my better work, if I do say so myself.” He stood. “I should go. Goodnight, Harry.”
There was a miniature wooden world in the window. A model train traveled around tiny tracks. There were buildings up and down a little street, with doors and windows swinging open and closed, people peeking out. Tiny, intricately detailed people were hanging baubles on an equally-small Christmas tree in a town square. It reminded Draco of the clockwork models he’d seen in Muggle displays, but everything moved more smoothly, the magic flowing through it giving it life. As Draco took in the details, he realized, with a start, that the street was a model of Diagon Alley itself.
Once they’d received their drinks—they’d both decided to try the house take on an old fashioned, which featured a peaty scotch rather than the traditional bourbon—Harry led them to one of the tall tables. Draco fiddled with his glass as he realized that, much like on their impromptu coffee date, he had no idea what to talk about—especially since he would maybe prefer for this to be an
“Maybe.” He half smiled as a thought popped into his head. “Although technically he’s a Beater.”
“Schoolmate?” Draco asked.
“I just felt awful afterwards,” she told Blaise. “I don’t know what I was thinking. I guess I got a bit wrapped up in the idea of things and didn’t consider the reality of it. I’m trying my hand at sports reporting now. Much less stressful.”
ed. “Maybe someday. For now I’m just really enjoying having this time with Teddy, you know? He’s at a really fun age, and hanging out with him gives me an excuse to do all sorts of stuff I didn’t get to do when I was a kid.”
“I wonder what happened to the dragon once you freed him?” Luna chimed in. She was perched next to Blaise in a flowy sundress; her long hair had been tied back in a braid after it had flown across his face one too many times.
“Telephone? Flying car? Getting blocked in behind the Floo at Harry’s aunt and uncle’s house? Any of this sound familiar?”

given you any sort of compliment?”
for Merlin’s sake!”
“Huh? Oh, the Quidditch game. Yeah, I didn’t end up going, actually.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, not making eye contact. “Wasn’t really in the mood.”
“Wow. I’ve been cooking since I was a kid; that’s hard to fit in my head.” He kicked himself mentally; bringing up his childhood and then being judgemental of his date all in one breath was not at all a good start.
We’re working our way through a lot of different bands and genres, trying to figure out what we like. That’s one thing we have in common, I guess—neither of us really had much opportunity to form our own tastes and opinions when we were younger. Not just on music, obviously, but music is easier to talk about than the rest.
“Really?” Draco squinted. “I don’t see it. Although it’s hard to picture Trelawney without those glasses.”
,” Teddy told him, voice so exasperated that Draco had to bite back a laugh.
bought you?!”
“Make us a drink while you’re up there, will you, darling?” Pansy directed from under a wide-brimmed sun hat and a pair of dark sunglasses.
Harry smiled, looking up from where he was seated next to Draco at the peninsula, engaged in an ongoing battle over the fork and knife Draco kept trying to use to eat his pizza. “You read my mind, Gin,” he said, even as he—once again—removed the fork from Draco’s hands and held it well away from him. “No! This is not fork food. Use your hands like a normal person.”
“Not really.” She raised an eyebrow, and he sighed again. Was expressive eyebrows a Black family trait? He wondered. He and his mother had been known to have conversations entirely in eyebrow gesture; it had driven his father mad. “
“It tastes like Floo powder
Harry poked at his split lip in the mirror and hissed. He could already see a nasty bruise forming across one cheekbone, and his eye was beginning to swell. And that wasn’t even getting into the various smaller cuts and bruises.
And if Harry noticed that Malfoy had grown into himself in an extremely physically appealing way, that was really just an objective observation. And sure, okay, they spent quite a bit of time together these days, often just the two of them. And
She rolled her entire head back in apparent disbelief. “Oh my god, how are you this stupid?” she muttered.
“Ugh,” Draco commented as they disappeared, and Ron gave a grimace of agreement.
“Not my most subtle move,” Draco agreed. “I do think I’d prefer that Teddy not know, though, if that’s alright. I don’t want him to think—” He trailed off, unsure how to finish that sentence.
“You are not keeping that toad and not me, are you?” She asked, half smiling.
It would be worth it, they knew. It was just a matter of figuring out how to go about making it happen without burning everything else they’d built for themselves to the ground.
Harry's head snapped up to meet Ginny's eyes. "It wouldn't be the same," was all he said. Being an Auror meant so much to him. It represented all his hard work, his training, his effort to be good enough to earn the title. "Sure, the hours are demanding, but it's worth it."
Ginny had been gone for three days before he realized he couldn't stand being in the flat alone. He couldn't even make heads or tails of his own feelings, because to be honest, he had managed quite well without noticing them for the first half of his life. Back then, anything remotely 'bad' that he felt could be solved by sitting in his cupboard and counting to a hundred. He had seen someone do that on the telly when he was about 8, and he had wondered if it would really 'make things better'. To his delight, it did in fact make a difference, primarily because it gave him something to focus on in order to remove whatever bad mood he had after a punishment from his aunt and uncle, or a nasty beating from Dudley. It was one of the things he had continued out of habit without even thinking about it, and neither Ron nor Hermione were aware of it. Both his best friends knew that Harry could sometimes blow up if angered to breaking point, but mostly he had always been quiet and introspective when he was troubled. They never knew that in his head, Harry was simply always counting to a hundred.
"Harryyyyyyyy!" the boy cried, hugging his godfather's legs.
to someone else was seemingly simple enough of a ritual, because its depth of complexity depended wholly on magical power, concentration and emotion. It was mostly Potter clasping Draco's right hand and intoning the long and ancient Latin chant that invoked the bindings he intended to form between them. Such old rituals relied purely on Magic, with a capital 'M'', and demanded very clear focus and a strong combination of intent and emotion towards the person being covered by
Narcissa motioned towards the direction of Draco and Astoria's wing and walked briskly at once, leaving her son to hurry in her wake.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Ginny until she finally nodded. "I've had to be away several times. It caused a bit of a problem with our home life and my training schedule has also been more rigorous due to the approaching season."
Somehow, being there with Ginny gave the place an entirely different feel for Harry. He figured it was because he, Ron and Malfoy had gone here to unwind over a couple of beers (and the occasional Firewhiskey). They had exchanged some very personal stories here as well, which made it seem to Harry like they had built a fort of sorts. His eyes glanced towards their regular booth, hidden just beyond the last alcove. He didn't even think to bring Ginny there, deciding instead to seat nearer the front windows, where they could observe the people outside as they came and went. People watching was always entertaining.
Potter just clapped him on the back amusedly. "Whatever would I do without you?"
Announcement Charm. The couple, as they had already expected, were immediately accosted by the other guests, who were clamoring for their attention. The Malfoys were still very much celebrities amongst the more exclusive wizarding society, and people fawned over the perfect picture of pureblood partnership that they embodied. And so began another night of polite conversation, formal dancing and the occasional caress between the spouses when they could manage them. With the flash of lightbulbs almost blinding Draco, it was no surprise that he completely ignored the pair of dark grey eyes, ominously watching him from across the hall.
? No, not a clue."
Ron sidled up to Harry and his eyes flashed towards one of the alcoves down the hall. Harry, having been Ron's partner for so long, immediately picked up the message and excused himself smoothly from Molly and leaving her to resume her pacing.
"Like I said, Potter, you are unfortunately the only living being to truly understand me. I had a moment of... weakness... and I... I needed someone who wouldn't judge me for being overwhelmed. I thought... of all people... you wouldn't judge me for anything."
"Of course," his mother said, true to Draco's fear. She turned to him. "Darling, we've already set a few dates in order for your two to better acquaint yourselves before we think of pursuing anything more serious."
He dropped the card as if it had burned him. It fluttered delicately to the carpet, mocking him with its clean simplicity. He staggered back, feeling uneasy, and clutched Scorpius even closer to himself. Neither of them were hurt. The house elf had spoken the truth - there were no malicious charms on the card. Instead, there was one short message. The simple words, eerily plain but full of dark promises, kept echoing in his head ominously.
"So... you've no idea?" Harry asked desperately. He had gotten so used to her solving everything by reciting a book verbatim. She shook her head sadly.
Draco remained passive. He waited for the house elf to bring his breakfast to him, while he mulled over his mother's words. So much had gone on in just the last week that his usually sharp intellect was trying to catch up.
Then, though he rarely did so, he had opened up to Ginny about how much he loved her, and how much everything already felt like it was going alright, and that he had wanted to ask her sooner anyway, and would she please marry him?
"Hey, mate," Ron said hoarsely. "Er..."
"Odair just Firecalled," she said slowly, her voice like heavy syrup. Her eyes kept darting back and forth between Harry and the fire as if she couldn't stand to look long enough at either.
"It could be anyone, though," Draco argued. "Narrowing this down to a British magical who hates the Malfoys and has traveling access to the continent isn't much help when you think about it."
"By chance, Ginny was called to a last minute full team assembly, Molly and Arthur went back to France because Louis has dragonpox, I think. Hermione was sent on some confidential meeting in Prague - don't ask me, no idea - and Ron took the weekend off to be her Auror escort. Andy, as you might already know, is trying to fix up the rest of the legal problems in America."
Sure enough, the Floo roared to life, bathing the sitting room in emerald light. Out from the hearth jumped little Teddy, not so little anymore at 7. In fact, Harry felt a slight jolt when he realized that he had grown by an inch since he last stayed over.
It was very early,
"I don't care if she's a muggle," Draco said softly, turning to face his friend. "But if this helps to save my son, then I will take back everything I've ever said against muggles."
Idishi <3
"Welcome back," Harry murmured in her ear softly. They both knew, of course, that they would need to have that much-avoided Talk, with a capital T, but in the meantime, neither could deny the relief they felt after such a long separation.
"Oh," Harry exclaimed, "sorry, I'm not sure if we'd talked about this before, you see, since we're mostly piss-drunk. I meant... er... When I died, the afterlife looked pretty much like King's Cross Station, and Dumbledore told me that moving on might have involved taking a train from there. So I was kind of making a casual joke about, you know, you and me having a laugh while waiting for the train."
There was a protracted silence, during which all Harry could hear was the rain shattering upon the windows.
"We're glad to help," Ron answered for him. "Remember, it’s our job to help people."
"Yeah, but I guess we were more ready to
Ron's eyebrows furrowed a bit, but he didn't say anything yet. Hermione looked confused. "Did you guys argue about her having to go away, then?"
He rose from the table and gathered his cloak. "Oh, and tonight is on the house," he added brusquely. At the looks of confusion on the Aurors' faces, he smirked. "I
"And how do you think it will provide a better solution if even the magical means are failing?" Astoria asked concernedly. "What difference does it make?"
He absent-mindedly played with the tufts of hair on James' head. It was a rich chocolate brown, not as jet black as Harry's, and not as reddish as his mother's. With a pang, his thoughts went straight to his current source of numbness.
'Yes," the witch nodded enthusiastically. "There should be parallels between the Malfoy and the Tonks lines, and it is there that maybe we can see what might be wrong, or missing."
Despite being home for most of the pregnancy and after, Ginny seemed to have pushed herself to become a more present mother to James and Albus. It still wasn't a perfect family, but it was a good compromise that allowed both Harry and Ginny a balance between what they wanted and what they needed.
"I love you, too, Ginny," Harry said quietly. "I've always loved you, in so many more ways that anyone could possibly imagine. I just can't help thinking that we're doing something wrong, for us to have to go through this much..."
"I should probably go back down then and save her," he said, heaving a sigh before turning back to walk towards Ron.
Draco was confused by the expression, but Potter just laughed. "As healthy as a horse, Ron," he corrected, but it still made no sense to Draco.
The Boy Who Lived was willingly binding himself to a Former Death Eater slash Nemesis.
Malfoy nodded. "Dilly was one of my nurse elves," he pointed out. "My childhood was what you'd expect of a typical pureblood, you know. I lacked nothing and wanted for naught. I was given and provided with everything. Though, between you and me, my mother the rebel sought to spoil me in her own ways. It.." Draco frowned a bit. "It always made my father a bit angry at her, I guess."
Harry thought ruefully as he leaned back behind his desk, watching Ron's somber expression from across the office.
The fact that Potter and the Weaselette were an item was news for several months. It never seemed to get old, and people were thirsty for any kind of news about their reclusive hero. Draco unfolded today's edition of the Prophet, and he already expected at least one feature about the Chosen Couple. It was inevitable after the limited ward release.
"Yes, Potter needs to help him. Immediately, it seems."
"Merlin, so- so when Ginny joked once that Purebloods were shopping around for partners and basing it all on their assets-"
"Yeah, and Hermione's had to stay out of work for a year and had to stay on a consultancy while I've had to give up some fieldwork so I could stay home as much as I can."
"Hey, er," Ron's eyes drifted away. "See you tomorrow then, and bring some of those cakes that Kreacher makes, yeah?" he added in an obvious attempt to lighten the mood.
As Ginny tried to relax, Rosewood asked as gently as she could about their predicament.
Draco seemed to mull over Harry's words. Harry hadn't really thought about it, but for some reason, he liked being able to listen to whatever Draco had to say.
"Kill me."
"What do you mean?" asked Ginevra.
Potter laughed some more. "Let's just say you'll be asking us out for those pints yourself, soon enough. Anyway, goodbye!" Before he could say anything in response, the Floo connection disappeared, leaving Draco with a confused look on his face while he absorbed the fact that Potter had invited him out for drinks.
"Don't be stupid," Harry scolded, "it's not weakness. And anyway, I've always agreed with Dumbledore that it's a kind of strength you have inside you."
"Those are the basics," Draco drawled impatiently. "But therein lies your slight oversight. You see, the infinite nature of
Harry looked up to his almost-father-in-law-but-also-practically-his-father-anyway. They hadn't even been there for more than half an hour, but it already felt like he had been pacing for an eternity. He tried to smile, but his heart wasn't in it and it came out as a wonky sort of smirk.
Truth be told, Harry hadn't exactly liked how this career path began in the first place. While he and Ron wanted to be Aurors, and had taken the proper courses as Fifth and Sixth Years, they weren't expecting the Head Auror to personally approach them with an offer.
"I apologize, Minister, I was just taken by surprise," Draco muttered. He had asked for the information, and he would get it. He schooled his expression again and waited for the man to continue.
Draco attempted to keep his face straight as he recalled all the 'Call of the Pint' talks. He felt his lip fighting to curl up and it took all of his self-control not to let it show. "I wouldn't know," he sad off-handedly.
"I think..." Harry took a deep breath. "I think it's because we still had some growing up to do... and having James forced us to do it too fast and... skip ahead. I think we outgrew ourselves, Ginny."
In fact, Harry felt like he loved her even more, just not the kind that ended in a marriage.
So! This chapter ends 2005. Thank you sooo much for all the comments, guys! My favorite part is reading all  about how much everyone just absolutely HATES Ginny hahaha. Like I said, the plot is all written out already, and this is all part of the grand scheme of things.
She thought about what Draco had said. She agreed that Daphne had been a bit cool, but she thought Draco could charm the chill from her heart and turn her into the loving wife she could be. Then she shook her head. She was thinking just like her parents had, cold and calculating in brokering a marriage. No, this time she wanted Draco to actually be happy with his betrothed, and Daphne obviously wasn't one to reconsider.
Ginny laughed. "I know you do, but at this point, it's a bit unnecessary seeing you have a house elf you don't use, and limitless places to go for food."
"That's what friends are for, aren't they?" Draco replied teasingly. "Though in our case, I think bringing up the old rivalry seems to do wonders, doesn't it?"
"I was joking," Draco assured him. "I must say, I find it marvelous that we can jump from one depressing topic onto a completely absurd one."
His friendship with the blonde potioneer had fast become a staple in his life, and there was very little animosity in their behavior at this point. There were no lingering traces of bitterness, but their need to be at each other's throats was still a defining feature of their interesting camaraderie.
Their eyes met, and Draco could see that Potter truly was feeling guilty. Which was ridiculous, of course.
"You still want to go after your dreams, I know," Harry said quietly. "I understand that, Gin, I really do. Even at the worst times, when I miss you terribly, I try my best to understand. But I'm really starting to think that we're working too hard on this, and I don't believe we're working towards the same future anymore."
Draco looked down at the book in his hand. They hadn't even exchanged names. How rude of him not to have asked in the first place! As he shrank his new purchases and slipped them into his pocket, he met the eyes of the girl at the till, who for some reason saw an unspoken question in his gaze.
Harry's got quite a mouth on him when he's on a roll, huh? :)
achieved his privacy by distorting the way people perceived reality. Every single time that he took James out for a walk to the park, anyone he wished to remain oblivious would not sense James in any way. Or sometimes, when Harry wanted to enjoy the experience of being father and son on a nice day out, he would adjust the bindings on both of them so that people would see them and be able to talk to them, but remain ignorant of who they really were. That way, it wasn't so depressing for him, since he got to talk to other parents (mostly Muggles) and allow them to fawn over his own son while he admired theirs. He didn't get to do this often, but he felt much lighter whenever he did, simply because he liked the idea of being normal. More often than not, he had to resort to the full sensory block on James just to be sure.
"Speaking of which," Harry continued, straightening up. "I should probably go."
"Call it payback for that last time you made my ear bleed."
"Possibly."
"Fine... Harry." Malfoy made a face as if he were sucking on a lemon, but Harry knew him well enough to know that he was just being the prat he was.
"Of course you got one, too," Ginevra said, "I forgot you've had to consult with that food poisoning potion a few months back."
She turned around gracefully and greeted him with a brilliant smile that had become a mainstay on her since she became Lady Black. "Quite late for such a greeting, isn't it?" she said, amused. "How was breakfast with Mr. Potter?"
"Not a bad idea, that. Hmm, look at Hodges' map. Interesting. Was expecting a completely different layout…"
"Why haven't you told anyone?"
For several seconds, the man was silent, but then gave out a shaky breath.
Harry sat back, frowning. "A threat?"
"Harry?" Hermione began, voice filled with concern. He must have looked like shit, then.
Harry knew it would never exaclty be easy again with Ginny, what with two boys (or three, counting Teddy) between them. Still, he was used to going with whatever Fate threw his way.
He let out the breath that he didn't know he had been holding. He moved closer to Ginny, saw her happy tears, and he wasn't even ashamed when he realized that he, too, was crying. He kissed her, gently, but deeply. "I love you," he told her, over and over, "I love you."
"Not in trouble, then?" Pot - HARRY - asked.
The blonde looked at him with fiery eyes. "I didn't mean to upset you, but I was trying to make my point when you so rudely interrupted me." He glared at Harry, and the latter had the decency to look embarrassed.
"I also have plans for you, Draco," she said gently. "I promise not to be as overbearing as your Father in this regard, but for your own future and well-being..."
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts. Draco was leaving already? He had gotten so used to having him around for much longer.
Harry loved Hermione, but sometimes he just wanted to chuck Hogwarts, A History at her in retaliation - a passing comment that would have earned him a prolonged death glare from a certain redhead, but had in fact drawn out the longest laugh from Malfoy that he had ever heard. He found that he quite liked hearing the sound, and, as they turned into the hallway where Arthur and Molly were waiting for them, decided silently that it wouldn't hurt to try and make Malfoy laugh like that again.
Malfoy feigned a look of disbelief, which he knew Potter would take as a joke. "How preposterous. Naming is such a great moment in a Pureblood's life, old families even had it professionally done before."
Ron passed him one of the sheets. "Confirmation for Macmillan and Malfoy about the statements they gave for the additional mind maps. In triplicate," he scowled.
, the Auror defended.
Potter's voice had begun to come out from the lifeless drawl it had been the whole night, and Draco noticed that there was more passion to his words now. "We think that he wasn't given much importance within their group, but it seems that his capture has caused the mastermind to fear what he could tell us. The custom-made Memory wipe certainly showed how desperate they were to ensure that he would not share any of his incriminating activities. Luckily for us, they missed one small part, which may be the key for us after all. That's usually the biggest mistake anyone ever, ever does, you know. Taking someone for granted."
"I feel much better now, you know" he said to James, laughing at himself for talking to his son as if he could understand a word he said. "Daddy's going to have a good night out with your Uncle Ron and you'll be with Auntie Andy. You'll get to play with Teddy all day! And what's more, Mummy's coming back tomorrow, and we'll all get to be together again!" Harry held his son closer, snuggling into his chocolate hair. The little boy's grubby hands held fast onto his father's robes, giggling when Harry threw him up into the air again.
Upon hearing this, Narcissa seemed to suddenly understand something, and her eyes glinted with something that Draco couldn't place.
Harry couldn't help it. He snorted. "That guy will always have an agenda, Gin, but nowhere near as bad as you make it sound. He's just not good at being evil."
"Ah, fuck you all!" Potter cried with pretend incredulity, in between laughs of his own. "Ah, now I can't wait to get it over and done with. They won't know what hit 'em."
bindings, this really is perfect."
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "She hasn't been herself lately, both of you must have seen that. I don't think she hated it here, or hated having to run around the house and take care of me and James, but you can't deny that she wasn't feeling... right."
or anything. It was just that the git drove him mad, what with his whole… everything. That was all. And Harry didn’t appreciate him stealing their costume idea.
Stale beer and hot bodies
“I thought the manual said you could heat the oven instantly with the magical modifications,” Harry said, confused.
“No, really! Well, sort of, anyway. The Malfoys do own the vineyard, but I’m not involved in the actual production.”
Harry sighed heavily but did as he was told. From behind the barrier, he could hear the door open and the chatter of his eight remaining contestants as they entered. From nearby, he heard Dermot’s voice, sounding incredulous.
“Yeah, that was pretty clear from the screaming public row and breakup,” Ron snorted, and Harry’s head snapped back up to give his friend a betrayed look. Ron at least had the decency to look slightly abashed. “‘Mione’s parents get the Australian papers and send the articles that mention you to us,” he admitted.
Sadiyah looked considering for a moment. “Well, it sounded like there are two main things that we need to do: find clues and puzzles and then solve them, right? So why don’t we all start out by looking for anything that seems out of place and bringing it back here.” She indicated a wooden table to the side of the room that’s surface was fairly empty. “Once we have enough that patterns are starting to emerge, half of us can keep looking for the rest of the clues, and the other half can begin trying to sort out the puzzles. Does that work for everyone?”

“Hiya, Harry!” Colin Creevey’s always-chipper voice caught the edge of Draco’s attention, and he gladly turned his focus to the much-more interesting task of eavesdropping on his coworkers, swiveling his chair just slightly to allow him to watch them from his peripheral vision. “I’m trying to get final numbers for the Anniversary Gala next week. Should I put you down for a plus one?”
“Maybe I’ll take you some time.” Leela winked at him.
“I know,” they answered, sounding amused as they gave him a firm handshake. “You can call me Jack.” Their voice was smooth and low and immediately sent Harry’s mind to very dirty places. He could not for the life of him place whether they were a man, woman, or something else entirely, and he found that he couldn’t be less bothered if he tried. There was something about them that was almost devastatingly compelling.
Ron pointed at him, looking incensed. “I could have been Oz!”
On Wednesday, in order to dodge another lecture from his mother on his love life and locale (“I’m only saying, Draco, Kashburn and Costleigh have a London office as well. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t—”), Draco made the possibly-slightly-dramatic decision to flee the house.
Harry smiled wryly up at Draco. “Side-along’s probably going to startle the hell out of him, but I don’t particularly fancy walking half a mile carrying four stone of dead weight.”
“Well, congratulations! William, while we’re talking, I have a question for you: many fans of the show expressed confusion as to why you chose to participate in the first place, as you didn’t seem particularly invested. What made you decide to put your name forward?”
Draco held back an eye roll and perused the list, which appeared to be the latter part of the alphabet. Several names stood out to him—Parkinson, Zabini, a somewhat surprising number of Weasleys, and, of course, Potter.
He didn’t have it now.
“I can’t believe you basically use your own name as a swear word.”
Draco recoiled. “I’m wearing something that your
“You should come with me,” he said before he could second guess himself.
The next day, Harry and Sadiyah were treated to a day at the beach, one of Harry’s favorite ways to spend his free time. It was another gorgeous, sunny day, and they had a wonderful time splashing around in the chilly waves. Sadiyah’s grace on land, Harry discovered, apparently extended into the water as well, making her excellent at knocking Harry’s legs out from under him when he least expected it. By the time they headed for shore, his hair hung in lank strands around his face and he was completely exhausted.
This assumption was proven true as soon as the game got underway. About half of the players seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Owen had been assigned as a Beater, if the bat in his hand was any indication, but he kept trying to catch the Quaffle. Gabrielle was making a valiant effort at Chasing, but kept forgetting which hoops she was supposed to be aiming for. Hilde ducked the Quaffle as though it was a Bludger whenever it came near her; Jack’s role was entirely unclear, since they were simply standing to one side looking vaguely amused; and William, who was apparently the red team’s Keeper, was stubbornly refusing to block any shot that wasn’t within easy arm’s reach.
“Hello, Draco! It’s lovely to see you. Your aura has gone a bit pink around the edges.”
“Ganty, Sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Quite a few hours later, Draco lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling, frustration mounting as his mind ran in circles and refused to allow him to sleep.
“And how are you feeling, Harry? Excited? Nervous?”
Green, like grass pushing stubbornly up from barren ground. Green, like the scent of spring washing away the frost. Green like a chrysalis, promising change.
the outlines of what he wanted—someone who balanced but didn’t match him, who was caring but not sweet, full of sharp humor and soft touches—but every time he tried to plug the form of one of them into that space, to imagine building a home and a life with them, he couldn’t quite manage it.
Harry laughed, and Draco moved his hands to the lapels of Harry’s blazer, stroking the fabric gently. “Do I get a goodnight kiss, then?” he asked coyly.
“It’s also Pansy’s job.”
“Harry.” The second hand came up, the thumb now wiping away tears instead of blood. Draco’s eyes flitted between Harry’s, still searching, and then he leaned in. Harry was frozen.
“Practice, I suppose. You did a very good job for your first time, though. I’d be happy to have you model for my usual class any time you’d like.”
“Alright then!” Pansy interrupted. “We’ve tried our best—” Draco raised a pointed eyebrow at Pansy, and she rolled her eyes. “
gotten to see him at all. It wasn’t remotely true, of course, but he folded quickly nevertheless. He was still fairly floating from the night before, so he didn’t bother to put up much of a fight. He hadn’t been to Diagon Alley in years, and anyway, he thought, it would be nice to spend some time with her out of the house.
“I could be persuaded to go for a soak,” Blaise commented from one of the sofas, where he was stretched out, empty plate on the floor next to him. “It’s been ages.”
? If you need an outlet, why
“Good, I have some errands to run. I’ll see you both tomorrow.” He unfolded himself from his chair and left without another word. Pansy rolled her eyes and moved to follow.
“Fuck me,” Draco answered immediately, the words slipping from him unbidden. Now that they were out, though, he decided that he very much stood by them.
There was a strange clicking noise, and suddenly, all of the overhead sprinklers came on at once, soaking the entire room and everyone in it.
“Not in the slightest. But I’ve got too much dirt on her for you to need to worry about it. And besides, I’m hoping she’ll give us a copy. For posterity, you know.”
“Oh.” Relief, quickly followed by disappointment and puzzlement flickered across Harry’s face. “Why? You don’t have to tell me,” he added hurriedly, “just, I’m a bit confused.”
“I think so? It’s a bit overwhelming, if I’m being honest.”
In which Harry talks Draco into skiving off work, an escape room date turns out not to be the best idea, and there are fireworks.
“It’s just that you’ve had such a rough time, and I don’t want— I don’t want to be one more person who hurts you, even if you don’t really want to be with me, either.”
, that’s cold!” he gasped, swiftly pulling it back out.
“I dunno, I died before, and they still let me play,” Harry mused. His hands moved upward, toying with Draco’s hair tie briefly before pulling it free and letting his hair tumble down to his shoulders, a waterfall of gold-touched white. He ran his fingers through it, grazing over Draco’s scalp and making him shiver.
“I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”

“We don’t need to talk for me to
Harry gave him a mischievous smile. “I figured it was worth a shot. And if you’re horrible, I’ll just get extremely drunk on your knut.” He winked, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“Gabrielle!” Harry greeted her with a hug and a bemused smile. “It’s been ages. What are you doing here?”
Jack, unsurprisingly, was wearing the same thing they always did, and, also unsurprisingly, it still left Harry tongue tied.
“Hey! Potter!” came Draco’s teasing voice, snapping Harry out of his reverie. “No zoning out on me while I’m winning. Unless you’d like to forfeit?”
“Thank you, Mother,” he said, ignoring the knowing look she gave him as he moved past here and knelt before the fire. When he saw Harry’s face in the fire, his eyes widened. “Merlin, Harry, you look awful. Is everything okay?”
“A shame you didn’t go into potions, of course, you were always an excellent student—” Draco tried his very hardest not to snort and just managed it “—but I’ve heard wonderful things about them, wonderful things. A new age in wizarding finance, they say. Marvelous. Marvelous.”

Apparently reassured, Harry shot him a devious grin. “That’s what silencing charms are for.”
“Oh.” Teddy paused, contemplating this. “Well it’s good that he is now. Harry’s awesome.”
“S’mores,” Hermione told them, her voice taking on the tone it tended to when she was excited to share her knowledge about something, “are a Muggle campfire treat. They’re actually fairly American, so I suppose it’s not surprising you aren’t familiar with them. I learned about them from an American film when I was small and insisted that my parents make them with me the next time we went camping.”
That seemed to be enough for Blaise, because he nodded sagely and then moved on to his next question. “Are you looking forward to tomorrow’s group date?”
“I really need to read reviews before I choose movies,” Harry sighed as they exited the theater later.
date rather than a friendly round of drinks. “So, how did you find this place?” he settled on, not wanting to start out on an awkward note.
She pursed her lips, thinking. “Is that the all-magic town near the school?”
He wandered up and down the street, peering in windows and hoping that something would catch his eye, but nothing did. His normal go-tos for gifts—books, clothing, nice wine or liquor—all felt impersonal, inadequate. He considered a plant of some sort, something that held a particular meaning, but he hadn’t seen any houseplants in Harry’s flat and didn’t know if he would want the responsibility. He thought about something experiential, maybe something Harry could take Teddy to do or see, but he felt like it would just highlight the fact that he was leaving, that he wouldn’t be there to enjoy whatever it was with them.
, of all people.
“Yes. Well. Thank you.” Draco was frustrated to find that he couldn’t muster a more eloquent response. Maybe it was the alcohol? It certainly couldn’t be the physical contact or the surprisingly conscientious concern, he tried to tell himself.
of the water they displaced. It also moved remarkably smoothly, the wind and changing scenery the only indicators of how quickly they were going.
Harry almost told him ‘no’ by default, but then he thought back to his reactions to a couple of the contestants. “Yeah, actually. It’s been a lot of years, and we’ve all changed a lot since then, so I don’t want to think the worst, but back at Hogwarts, Romilda… erm… sort of tried to slip me a love potion hidden in a box of chocolates? Our sixth year?”
Harry laughs. “I dunno. My stuff is all back at my flat anyway, so it’s not like I lost anything important. Maybe this is better. We probably would’ve been miserable here, anyway.”
of Harry’s friends,” Hilde added.
On Thursday, Narcissa manipulated Draco into going to Diagon Alley with her, sighing about how his visit was more than halfway over and she’d
Shortly before noon, the glass doors slid open, and one of the crew whose name Harry hadn’t caught stuck his head out. “You’re needed,” he said, looking slightly fearful, and Harry winced. That look could only mean that Pansy was displeased, which likely meant that Harry was running behind.
Harry thought through the series of disasters that had been enacted upon the most problematic contestants and couldn’t help but grin. Even though the incident with Perry had pissed him off, Harry had to admit to himself that he’d thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it.
“Went wrong how?” Harry asked, curious.
Draco sat at a borrowed computer, scrolling through reams of market data and cursing the concept of year-end charitable giving. He was all for philanthropy—he gave to several causes himself—but the last-minute rush of the wealthy to shuffle their finances and make strategic donations to avoid paying taxes under the guise of good will made him want to strangle people.
Harry attempted to stand, a little shakily at first, but he felt steady enough once he was fully upright. “Yeah, I think so. How did you know to look for me out here, anyway?”
“Barely worth mentioning,” Harry agreed. “Anyway, they eventually decided they cared more about the counterfeiter than my, erm… youthful escapades. So I was generously allowed to set up a horrifically uncomfortable hidden camp to do some surveillance, managed to get a few pictures of the culprit in the act, and tadah! Headline story and a load of DMLE employees who hate me for making them look incompetent. All in a day’s work.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “I’m not repeating myself.”
“Wonderful! So for the rest of you, figure drawing is where you use live models to study and draw the human form.”
” He was pouting now. “You should just stay here.” Draco’s amusement melted away.
“I don’t know,” he told her honestly. “Maybe in different circumstances, I might have. But right now… no. I don’t think that I can. And it’s not fair for me to keep you here on the chance that the next two weeks might change things.”
the sexy bits, t’is the season to skip a chapter and ask me for a SFW version 😉
to do something he doesn’t want to? Where have you been for the past eighteen or so years?”
Inadvertently, his gaze flitted down to Harry’s lips, pink and chapped from the wind. He snapped his eyes back up, horrified at himself. “Fine,” he choked, before clearing his throat. “Fine,” he tried again.
Feeling somewhat disoriented, Harry took a few moments to head back to the bar and down a large plastic cup of cold water, trying to get his bearings. After a moment, he decided another drink was in order as well. He was about to order when Hilde appeared at his elbow. “Do a shot with me?” she asked. Harry nodded and stood aside as she ordered two shots of tequila, which were handed over with a couple of lime slices and a separate shot glass containing a few spoonfuls of salt. With a look that Harry could tell spelled trouble, she took his hand and slowly licked the soft stretch of skin between his thumb and forefinger, sprinkling it with salt before doing the same to her own. He shivered as she placed his shot into his other hand. “Lick, swallow, bite,” she instructed him.
Harry couldn’t help it. He burst into laughter. “Oh Merlin,” he managed eventually. “I’m going to have to set aside a whole wall for them.” He thought for a second and then snorted. “Perry’s might have to go behind a curtain or something. And I think Sullivan actually went for the wire and beads thing, so who even knows how I’m supposed to display that.”
As they’d talked, Harry had led Draco down a side street, and they now stood in front of a small shop with a simple wood-burned sign reading “The Bean and Leaf” that resembled many of the small, independent Muggle coffee shops scattered around Manhattan. When Draco said as much, Harry grinned. “There’s a lot of cultural integration happening these days,” he said. “Muggle-style things are all the rage.”
bad,” Teddy said, “but Cousin Draco is still better. I’m gonna make
Harry was intrigued but raised a skeptical eyebrow. “You didn’t think to do that before making me stand in front of a room full of people completely starkers?”
Harry’s jaw dropped, and his face went blazingly hot. She laughed, and Ron snorted as he grabbed his cloak to head out the door.
“Yeah. For about a year. But, well, I’m Halfblood, so when things… you know.” Owen grimaced. “My parents took me out of school. So Rose and I lost touch. But seeing each other again, we just sort of…”
Narcissa raised a questioning eyebrow and he grinned, realizing that his gossip would more than make up for his perceived misstep in his mother’s eyes. “George—the one who owns the joke shop? Has apparently become rather…
Harry gave his bum a light smack. “Rude.”
Hermione laughed. “I'm 99% sure they were named by a Muggleborn who thought they were funny. Anyway, they’re supposed to be lovely, but I’ve never been on one. I don’t suppose anyone knows how to sail it?”
that was why Potter was here. The Arrows were the only team without a Seeker at the moment, owing to the horrible incident at last year’s qualifiers. Draco himself had been brought on to distract from the scandal, pushing the Wasps’ former seeker—who had been on a losing streak anyway—into the reserves. He should have realized immediately.
“Are you going to be okay?” he asked, sounding genuinely worried.
, he thought, and catching his mother’s eye, he knew that she was thinking the same. There was a bittersweet ache in his heart that he was only finding this now, when his life was firmly settled thousands of miles away.
Aaaaaand here we go! Pretty much just exposition today, but we’ve gotta start somewhere.
It was the warm feeling in his chest when he watched Harry with Teddy. It was the smile that he couldn’t seem to hold back every time he saw Harry’s face. It was the sweetness of falling asleep together and the comfort of a lazy morning after. It was the not wanting to part ways no matter how many hours they’d spent together. It was the sharp pain in his gut when he thought about saying goodbye. It was...
Draco bit his lip, but nodded in resignation. It wasn’t as though he would be able to help it, now that it had been said. “Fine. I promise I’ll think about it.” He drained his wine and looked down at the empty glass morosely. Then a thought occurred to him, and he perked up. “We still need to go choose wine and liquor, don’t we?”
Today I looked at a December 2006 calendar, added days of the week to my outline, realized a lot of things wouldn’t work as I’d originally planned if I accounted for Teddy being in school during the days, and subsequently spent like an hour cutting and pasting plot points into a different order (which is to say, this day did not start out here. It has time traveled.). I also spent more time than is probably reasonable researching daily start and stop times of Scottish primary schools, as well as when holiday breaks usually are. Why am I like this.
