"Any news yet?" Harry asked as he dropped the lunch Draco had carefully prepared for him on his desk.
"Draco, Robards called me into his office and asked about you. Asked me if I trust you."
"And the soup. Of course. Thanks for making soup for me. And covering me in a fluffy blanket. And probably getting me out of those robes and into something more comfortable."
"I think we should go for that witch at Penrith," Harry replied thoughtfully. "It says in her file that she's sold illegal potions before and she's already on the DMLE watch list so there's no harm in going there and checking the situation."
Harry had no memories of how they got there, nor just how he'd got out of his robes and into his joggers and a holey old shirt, but at some point Harry woke up on their sofa, his feet in Draco's lap and covered by the fluffiest blanket that their home had to offer.
And then they waited, cuddled on their sofa and took a short walk up the street. They were supposed to be at St. Mungo's at nine.
"Yeah, maybe. Maybe I was just worried about him or something," Harry sighed. That had to be it, surely? His brain had been running in every direction this last week.
"Succinctly put, Potter. I think we should leave. We have what we need. Robards is most definitely involved, but perhaps not willingly. Granger will have our arses if we stay any later than this," Draco whispered, before he stood and dragged Harry up with him.
But having Draco here for Christmas somehow still felt like too much to handle considering everything.
"Maybe it's just because you're not used to having him around for stakeouts, mate. I wouldn't worry too much about it, honestly," Ron added, giving Harry's back a chummy slap.
Sighing, Harry turned to leave the room but he stopped dead in his tracks when he spotted Draco leaning against the door, watching him.
"I wonder if she ever goes home or if she just lives inside her archive," Harry sighed, taking the files Ron handed him.
"Yes, Mr Potter. I'm here too. It was my turn to watch the Robards estate. I'm back reporting that absolutely
Malfoy,
"And you know that it'll be all over the
Harry tried to hit him with every non-lethal spell he could think of, not willing to kill him. That could wait until the Wizengamot got their hands on him once again. They needed his memories, needed to prove Robards was guilty too, and prove his whole sordid plan. Harry needed to expose everything Crouch had done including the horde of Inferi he had created. Like Voldemort before him, Crouch was nothing more than a murderer.
Harry followed Draco, who walked out of the house without missing another beat. Right in front of the door, Draco came to a halt and mumbled a spell that Harry had never heard before, one that made his skin prickle and shudder as it washed over him.
The rational part of his brain had told him that this had already happened by the time Ron and him had left Mr Peck's shop, but that hardly helped him. He couldn't shake off the feeling of somehow being responsible for this.
Looking at Ron, Harry furrowed his brows and, barely noticeably, nodded towards Robards before mouthing the word 'Minister'.
"You should have. And you shouldn't have called me your fiance, we're not engaged. It'll be all over the newspapers tomorrow." Taking the lead, Draco moved them over the dancefloor.
Now she'd said that, Harry really needed that drink.
Harry shuddered as he remembered all the hours he'd spent sorting through files with her. He remembered the dust and the clutter of the place. Whenever Harry had done something that wasn't up to the high departmental standards they had set upon him, they had sent him down there to help her.
Harry realised that this was the point Crouch Jr. caught on to what they were doing, and so did everyone else.
"Oh."
"We have everything we need, we should go now," Harry said, stepping behind Ron who yelped in surprise and almost jumped out of his skin.
"I think it's rather cute," Pans grinned as she started folding the letter to put it back in its envelope.
Ron and Harry both followed Hermione's order and sent their Patronuses off, hoping they'd get heard by the people they trusted most in the world.
The second Mrs Weasley was out of sight, Draco whispered a "Thank you" to the twins.
It wasn't until they both felt like they'd explode from all the delicious food that Harry and Draco felt they could move on to the next point on the list of things they had to do. Saying goodbye to Arthur and Molly, they left to check the state of Grimmauld Place.
Suddenly the dogs stopped, and Harry looked up from his desperate tries to ditch the worst thorny traps on the path. A tent. There was a tent, in the middle of nowhere. And somebody in this tent had a bad cough from what he was starting to hear.
"Yes, but you better think of an exit."
It'd been months since Harry had gotten to leave early, and he already felt full of dread that he wouldn't be able to enjoy the extra time off since he had to arrange tonight's meeting.
Why would you send me a picture of a random stranger's penis?
"I bet that's because we'd ask too many questions," Harry spat out, confusion reigning in his brain. "Those guys out there look like they were hired. They remind me of Snatchers. Eight down you say?"
Draco huffed at that, the 'today' was not in the slightest reassuring.
"Not alone," Harry echoed as he looked down at their linked fingers. He felt a lump build in his throat and tried to swallow it away.
Apparating to Mrs Millen's house, Harry knocked on the door and waited for her to open, greeting her with a big grin.
"It was a small cut," Harry said rolling his eyes at his friend's theatrics.
Harry looked at Ron, and then back at the dancefloor. He knew he wasn't drunk. Not overly at least. Which also meant that he didn't imagine the view. It'd been years since he saw him last time. Years. And now, there he was, Draco Malfoy, dancing in a Muggle club looking like a goddamn snack.
"She's the cutest thing that I've ever seen," Hermione sighed. "She must be young. I think you've raised her confidence a great deal by making her the responsible one, Harry."
"Harry! Come in! No worries, nothing dangerous. I was just trying to find out how those cleaning machines work but I'm not convinced I put it back together correctly because now it's making sounds it didn't make before! These things are fantastic! Truly amazing! But Merlin, they're not easy to put together. We could have used one of these when the kids were small. All the laundry. So easily done."
Draco had been pacing their kitchen for the past thirty-something minutes and Harry tried to ignore the nervous energy the wizard radiated while eating some eggs on toast.
"You know Robards will have your arse for crossing a name from that bloody list, right?" Ron asked while unpacking his sandwich.
"I think he's waking up." Dudley heard a deep voice say.
Thankfully the two Patronuses were enough to get rid of them. Once the Alley was clear again, Harry crouched down to get a hold of his shaking limbs.
Blaise, the jerk, cackled upon hearing of Harry's misery, while Ron nearly choked on his tea and promised Harry to do his best to help him, and Draco, but mostly him. Just so Draco hadn't had to do all of the caring. He had done this before, after all, and knew how to handle Hermione. In comparison, exactly how bad could Harry be?
"I don't think we need to take such extreme measures," Harry said. "This chap has been through a lot." Thinking for a second, Harry walked to the back room and found a fireplace there. "We could ask for backup to take him? There's a fireplace, I'm sure it's connected to the Floo Network."
"Yes, for once I do, Harry. This is, as we politicians say, a matter of national security. I can't give you any more details about it." Kingsley's deep voice was steady as he spoke, but as Harry looked closer he could see worried lines appear around his eyes. "Your role isn't to reason, Auror Potter. It's to get out into the field."
Standing up Harry removed the spells around Draco's bed. Leaving the Hospital Wing, he glared at everyone waiting out there, before announcing loudly that he'd personally kill each and everyone who ever tried to harm his child again.
Draco still cackled when they got home. Sometimes life wasn't fair, and other times life tried its very hardest to make things equal.
"Language, Ronald!" Mrs Weasley's voice came from somewhere upstairs.
Giving Hermione a short nod, Blaise vanished from the room. The wizard returned a few minutes later, carrying a pompous Pensieve made out of silver with tiny gold threads and spiked with odd-looking jewels. It was obviously an item of very powerful old magic that looked like it was carrying memories in its very metal.
"No idea. I wasn't involved in the interrogations and have no idea what they want. Tried to snoop around but I found nothing."
A scream from somewhere behind him made Harry snap around, and he saw someone disappear into the darkness just seconds before a massive explosion made the entire floor shake and shudder.
"What?" The idiot actually sounded confused at that. "Cas, being British doesn't explain what this thing just did!"
And he couldn't believe that Draco had the nerve to laugh about it.
"Harry!" Draco called out as soon as he saw him enter the room. His voice was filled with more concern than Harry had ever known. "What happened? What's going on?"
Smiling at Arthur, Harry nodded. "We will. I just hope we'll do so quickly."
The pair of them worked solidly through till lunch, splitting up the files and going through them with a fine-tooth comb, trying to figure out precisely who the people were they had to take in.
"Susannah Robards, nee Hartley," Mrs Robards answered without missing a beat.
After Harry had finished the story, which, to be fair, sounded more like an official Auror report at this point than anything else, heavy silence blanketed their assembly for many minutes as each of the Professors were trapped in their own thoughts.
"I'll tell Hermione that you're thinking of replacing her if you don't stop flailing," Harry laughed, and instantly got rewarded for his cheek with a Stinging Hex to his foot. He watched as Ron turned back and tapped his wand against the heavy door, mumbled something that Harry couldn't make out.
"What were the potions you were selling when the Ministry arrested you?" Ron asked with a grin.
One after the other left back through the Floo. The last ones to go were Ron, Hermione and Harry who decided to wait another ten minutes to see if someone else came to meet them. When they realised that nobody else was coming they gave each other a grim look. It was the three of them facing the world once more.
"Do you still want the wall, or would my piece of art prefer the bed so I can have a nice view?" Harry asked at the same time he finally reached for Draco's cock and gave it a slow stroke.
A blindfold wrapped itself around Mrs Robards eyes, and Hermione gave Blaise a sharp nod, allowing him to levitate her out of the house. Plucking a few hairs from Mr Robards' head, Hermione got up and they started to move back through the house.
Taken aback, Draco stared at him. "That sounds horrible. I'm not surprised that my magic knocked the floor from under your feet. I'm sorry. Your cousin sounds like a real prick."
He had been here for five years but something like this had never happened before. The events of this morning had been highly unusual.
"I appreciate that. I'm already so ready for the weekend and the day only started."
Harry
"Middle ages, Mr Potter? Well, if this is the case. I hope you don't mind me asking if you plan to make a honourable man out of my son soon? I have to break a deal for your thoughtless liaison after all."
"Not as far as I know," Arthur called back. "It wears off or ends once the caster dies."
Not your boyfriend
Taking a quick look around, Harry could see just exactly how terrified his friends were. He noticed Greg's grey-tinged features and George's extremely white face. Pansy's entire body was shaking as she leaned against the wall. Draco looked the least perturbed, as if this chaotic scene hadn't taken much of a toll on him.
It was a perfect success. After Harry's spell, Hermione and Blaise each took out one of the two people still rapidly firing curses at them, even going as far as trying to hit them with a
Seconds later a pair of boots came into Harry's view, and he recognised them instantly.
Greg had stayed too, flapping through a prospectus he'd found on the kitchen table. He looked much too calm for this disaster. Draco was catastrophizing and already saw himself finally locked up in Azkaban, key thrown in the sea and never able to leave his cell again.
"Don't mind at all, maybe you'll see something I missed," George agreed, clutching the edge of the table in his upset. "If you get me that damn thing I'll drop that memory right now. The sooner anyone can confirm that I'm not crazy then the better I'll feel."
Snorting, Draco shook his head. "I'll join you. Maybe take Hagrid's position? We'd make such a great team there. Potter and Malfoy living the good life! Low stress jobs and good payment, I'd even live in that bloody hut just to get away from all this."
He watched as Draco squeezed himself through the stuffed room to get to the tree where he bent down to place his presents with the others.
The Ministry was more or less led by retired Aurors now, and Harry was sure they couldn't do a worse job than any of the others who had come before them.
Only yesterday Harry had been ranting to him about the entire Draco situation, knowing that he could trust Sirius with his life and now this betrayal!
Sighing with relief, Draco took it, allowing Harry to lead their way.
Something about Robards' smile made Harry feel uneasy, but he couldn't do anything about it immediately. All he could do was leave and join Ron in their tiny crammed office that reminded Harry strongly of how Mr Weasley's looked when the two of them were growing up. At least they had a window even though it always seemed to rain when Harry decided to look outside.
Opening the door just far enough so he could stick his head inside, Harry tried to spot Arthur between all the random Muggle clutter that he stored in there.
Huffing, Harry looked over at Draco who tried his best to hide the grin. "And you're not fat. You're pregnant. If you'd stop worrying about that it'd decrease my breakdowns by a lot. Now let me drink my coffee you monster."
They had given him potions for it, but he could only take the first dosage before going to bed that night. At least there was hope that tomorrow things would already be a tad better.
" Harry said, pointing his wand at his throat. "Jasbert, Ministry of Magic. Aurors Potter and Weasley. Stop the curses or we'll have to make you!
Mrs Zabini opened her eyes, and looked down at all of them. "This is for luck," she said, her voice sounding rich and smoky. "It'll keep you safe, curses will miss you, and people will not feel the need to attack you if they hadn't planned to do so before."
and an elf appeared at the other side of the gate.
"Because this one here started to go fetid," Draco explained. "Boiled caterpillar bodies and Mandrake root? It'll leak deathly gases if it's not cleaned soon."
"Is Mr Malfoy happy with this room?" Harry asked in a mocking tone. "Or would he rather have the elves get rid of another wall in here to make it even bigger? Honestly, the only way this room could get even more like your younger self is if we'd have gotten a family of peacocks to strut around in here."
"Do you know them?" Draco whispered.
Next to him, Ron shook his head; only a small gesture, but big enough for Harry to know that talking wouldn't take them very far in this case. He was right. Jasbert was obviously paranoid and detached from reality. If living in a forest far away from everything wasn't a big enough hint, then his frenzied, angry words definitely were.
Draco laughed. "Are you proposing to make this more than a one time event, Potter? Here I am, thinking this fun will end soon."
"We have a safe house," Harry began, looking grimly at the surrounding witches, wizards and elves. "I want you all to go to 12 Grimmauld Place, meet us there. There are already a few people there, we took the Slytherins back first," Harry said, looking at the scared faces all around him. Even McGonagall looked more than a little bit worried.
, Potter."
"Exactly. Anyone else here got any suggestions?" Hermione asked into the circle. But the others stayed silent, so Hermione closed the discussion by finally taking a slice of pizza herself.
Biting his lip, Harry looked at Ron who only shrugged his shoulders. He didn't want to place Draco in a risky situation, not if it was as present as it was right now. But Harry knew, also, that he wasn't playing fair. Draco was a fully grown wizard so he couldn't really tell him no and let the others go and get their things themselves, could he? It was simply easier for Harry to collect Draco's things without placing him in danger than it was for the others to collect their belongings.
Paying his overly sweet Muggle drink, Draco decided to get up and go looking for him, and if he couldn't find Harry he'd go back to their hotel and pout for the rest of their honeymoon.
Getting closer, they noticed that the birds around them had quieted, and their numbers had lessened. The air grew colder and stiller until everything around them was silent, and a shiver ran across Harry's spine. "I don't like this. Keep your shield up,
"I can't deal with another attack today, so you better not try anything," Harry growled.
so nobody can get to it. If they do, then they deserve to get the potions. I pay the Ministry now, young Auror Potter, so I thought they'd leave me alone. Why do they want to see me anyway?"
"You would. And I'd love to see that. But I fear that you can't take those without coming and ruining some of the fun for me," Harry said, laughing at Draco's desperate expression.
Asking Draco to share a flat during their training wasn't something Harry thought he'd ever regret. Not even now that they'd finished it and still lived together. But occasionally Draco made it very hard for Harry to not doubt the life decisions he had made in the past that brought them both to this point.
"Pebble will prepare the bedrooms then," the elf answered smartly. "Mistress McGonagall looked very distressed, will she be one of your guests?"
"Great. Finally I have an admirer and he's dumb as bricks and has an awful handwriting." Draco sighed, "and he obviously has no shame at all. This last letter is unbelievable."
Christmas had never been less appealing to him than this year. They had always celebrated it, even last year in the middle of a war that nearly killed them all.
"I have a few questions. Give me a second…" Harry felt his thoughts racing through his mind. Draco wasn't safe, not here, not with all those nosey people lingering outside believing the rumors. Taking a deep breath, Harry looked at Draco on the bed, allowing his eyes to drift down to Draco's belly for the first time.
"On the settee next to the fireplace," Pansy answered, her face glittering with amusement. You won't fit under it together though."
"Yes! We're on our honeymoon. Harry left to buy something and didn't come back."
"Spit it out already!" Ron bluffed. "I'll be as old as dad once you finish the story if you carry on like that!"
"Do you want to take a shower before we go, or just get it done?" Draco asked, forcing Harry away from his thoughts about baby books.
This was too much.
"I'll keep the shield up this time," Harry said, already casting a
An hour later, all of them were standing in front of Robards' gate, hidden from spying eyes thanks to Draco's clever magic. Blaise was the first one to get active, dismantling all the charms with obscure enchantments and spells that secured the property whilst simultaneously searching for curses and hexes that could have been put in place against intruders.
It's only dinner. We can be civil guests without showing obvious affection to each other since that wouldn't be good manners anyway, and once they've cancelled the arrangement I can tell them we broke it off. Sounds like a solid plan to me.
Taking Draco's hand, Harry led him out of the club and into the dark alley behind it from where he Apparated them into his house.
The First Floor was empty as they reached it, but Blaise stopped them all, waving his wand at the empty space in front of them. The brilliant wizard cast a multitude of revealing spells and together with his mother, Bill and the Headmistress, started dismantling all the hidden traps and curses that had been left to trap them.
Rolling his eyes, Ron hid the passage again, making enough noise to distract Draco's attention away from Harry's guilty expression caused by the potions sniffing comment.
Pulling Draco into a hug, Harry hoped he'd understand how much this small gesture meant to him. Draco obviously cared, and so did Harry.
"Wonderful!" And with that Malfoy grabbed his arm and apparated them away.
Draco laughed.
Harry had swallowed a good load of soot and ash on his way there, and he shook his head, scarcely sure whether he could even speak right then. Hurrying to the kitchen Harry gulped down an entire glass of tap water in a hurry before he looked at them both and felt his knees gave way again. "Kingsley. I think he's dead. We have to get everyone. I sent Pebble to get the Slytherins to Grimmauld Place. Do you think anyone else is in immediate danger?"
I wouldn't have played along if I had known I was into any of this. I'm not one for making a fool out of myself in public.
"I'm on it," Harry hissed. "It's just the surprise, is all."
At that Draco snorted and Harry frowned at him.
"No. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you sooner."
"Oh my god you're the worst! It's not like that!" Harry screeched, knowing his face was every bit as flushed as Hermione's was. "I'm just—"
"How can it be him?"
Tying the small piece of parchment to the owl's leg, Harry glowered as he watched the bird fly off. Dinner at the Manor. What a good way to spend a boring Friday night.
Dark hair.
At some point in his life things had started to go wrong. Draco could possibly even point his finger at the exact moment, but he wasn't up for that kind of mental exercise. It'd only keep him spinning in circles for ages, and that was of no help whatsoever in his current situation.
He saw the way Draco looked at him whenever he thought Harry was too distracted to notice. So Harry had started watching him, trying to catch him looking his way.
This time would be different. It had to be different. They weren't children anymore, pulled into another's war. They had grown up, and still fought against the same evil. They had become better, become stronger: they were an unstoppable force, and Harry felt nearly drunk from that knowledge.
"Fuck. What now?" Draco asked, looking anxiously up at Harry, his grey eyes clouded.
"I'll go with Potter, you can come to my place when you get your mother out," Pansy said to Blaise and he nodded, looking thankfully at her.
"Listen, Potter, it's hard to learn all this Muggle stuff on your own. And it isn't as if anybody got hurt! Though I can't promise that'll stay that way if this room keeps feeling so damn uncomfortable."
Finding Draco's mouth again, Harry reached between them to finish what Draco had started.
Three hours later, he stood in front of the Burrow with a bag in his hands, looking like the ordeal of the last hours hadn't happened.
"Could you release Dean? I don't think he'll attack you after this, and he's not carrying a gun today."
They had promised to come over and say goodbye before they left, and Draco couldn't be stopped from giving her a small gift as thank you for helping them along.
Living with Dudley wasn't all that bad. Draco had learnt more about Muggle culture and technology within the last five months than he had in twenty-four years that came before.
Looking up at Draco, Harry already wanted to decline. He wasn't a good dancer, and the music was way too romantic for doing this without full body contact. But something told Harry that he should do it. "Don't cry if I step on your toes. You know I'm a horrible dancer."
Draco sat on his sofa, enjoying a glass of wine with Pansy, when all of a sudden a scratch at his window made them both perk up.
"I think both. Us and them. Do you think this was supposed to be a warning? To stay out of whatever this is?"
"Thank Godric, you're back. You have to see something," Hermione said, her whole body alive with nervous energy. She quickly dragged them towards the kitchen where a large paper was spread out over the table.
"I think the important things have been said. Please go home and rest, take this day to mourn over the best Minister we've had in centuries, and let's come back together tomorrow, to keep this place running."
"You did WHAT?" Hermione snapped, her perfect eyebrows raising nearly to her hairline.
"Of course they do." Somehow the stranger now looked at him as if
Humming, Draco pulled Harry even closer. "I wouldn't say no either. Would you mind if I kissed you?"
Malfoy's belly had swollen since they had come back. He had tried to hide it under baggy clothes and wide cloaks, but it had come to a point where he couldn't hide it anymore.
"I don't want your help, Potter," Malfoy spat.
Harry pushed the gate open, and slowly they walked up to the house. Making the decision to not go in straight away, Harry and Ron led the others around the house while spying into every window they passed, counting the people they could see inside.
"Thought you'd never ask."
Harry hadn't even dared to think of this, not even during his own wanks in the dark of night. And now he got to see Draco like this in reality.
as one.
His night's sleep had been shit, to say the very least. He had been haunted by vivid, vicious nightmares, the scenes of Kingsley's home playing over and over again, spiked with the high-pitched laugh of Voldemort and sickening memories of the Battle of Hogwarts.
"You know what?" Harry replied, standing up, "I'll go and take care of this. But I'll stop at the Department of Mysteries first, I need to tell Draco what happened. Something about this smells fishy and I want to give him some fair warning. And then I'll slip Mathilde our list and hope she'll have my back."
He instantly closed the curtains before turning back to face Harry.
Once he had called the technician, Dudley sat down on their ragged old sofa with Draco. "He said he'll be here in about three hours. We could think about what we'll have for dinner. I think if we take some of your things, and some of mine, we could make an acceptable pot of pasta with sauce. You have some veggies left that need to be eaten, otherwise you can throw them out."
Malfoy,
"You'll die young if you eat that stuff in such vast amounts," Harry snorted. Ron's love for mayonnaise really was a bit revolting. He'd begun to eat it spread on everything once he had discovered it in their fridge. "I think Draco invited the Slytherins over. You can come too if you want to."
"Harry? Did something happen?" Greg asked, looking confused.
"All of them except Blaise. What's happening?"
"Oh no. I'm with him because he's a good man." Harry smiled at Draco and, he had no idea what overcame him, pulled up Draco's hand to kiss his knuckles. "Also he's pretty, don't you think?"
"Hey!" Ron whispered from next to him. "Who would expect a war zone in the middle of Diagon Alley at this time of night?"
Slipping out from behind the plant, Harry crept into the office and quietly closed the door behind him, going straight to work.
They both scurried over to the main deck. “Now, you two know the plan right?”
“Holy shit.” She whispered breathily as she stared at the moving tattoo.
As they talked about god knows what for another 10 minutes, none other than Harry Potter made his way towards their table. “What do you think he’s doing?” Blaise whispered.
“Come on Dray. I could recite that in my sleep.” Pansy teased. Blaise laughed at her words.
“Harry. Look!” Hermione said excitedly. On her wrist the small star she had spelled out the words ‘Are you there?’
”I love you too Blaise.” Draco smiled.
And he sure as hell was. “What the fuck could he want?” Blaise asked.
“Dude... I love you.” Blaise said from the front seat.
“Okay. Fine. God I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this.” Draco murmured while pinching the bridge of his nose. “Why didn’t you just have one of your fan girls do this, anyway?”
“Now, who’s ready for the best weekend of our lives?” Pansy asked.
He walked back to his dorm and fell asleep as soon as he laid down.
“Come on out. I won’t hurt you.” He assured. “How many of there are you?” He asked as he walked through the water, his voice echoing through out the entire cave. “Five, ten, fifteen? A hundred?” He finally got to where they sat. Pansy’s mouth and nose covered by her hand still.
“What does that mean?”
“I’ll be down in a moment!” He yelled back as he looked down to see Draco. Blaise was a someone who liked to have time to himself. Normally he spent his time talking to strangers or ranting about his newest book but he also liked to be alone.
Sending her a foul look, Harry took another sip of whatever Mrs Weasley had given to him. It definitely had loads of alcohol in it, which he appreciated now more than ever.
"Are you already done with the others?" Harry asked, feeling astonished as he handed her the parchment.
"That won't be necessary." Robards smiled as he stood up. The interview was over. "That's all, Auror Potter. You can leave and get to work now."
"So," Hermione began once Harry had handed everyone a pizza box, "Ron filled me in with everything that's happened. I've written it down, made a series of notes and must say that you've already done excellent work. Setting up Grimmauld was the exact right thing to do." She looked around the surrounding friends, her expression warm with pleasure. "We'll have more people join us next time, I sent notes with our
Draco's amused expression made Harry almost too mad to be fascinated about the entire thing. He was sure Hermione would explode from jealousy once they told them the good news.
Draco didn't like how much she enjoyed his misery. He had gotten the strangest letters all week long, which wasn't what anyone needed at Christmas. Especially not him.
Stupid Malfoy, and his stupid owl.
"You're not the first one to tell me. How about you go to bed, I'll stay on your sofa, and tomorrow we'll work out how we're somehow going to make this work."
At that Ron's ears started to burn pink, or perhaps it was just the colour blanching from his face, but thankfully he managed to get out of the Ministry before anyone bar Harry could notice.
Shuddering at the very thought, Harry pulled Ron towards a place on the other side of the room where they'd be able to see the small platform but would hopefully still be invisible in the flood of faces.
"We can't hide them all," Hermione suddenly realised, her intelligent eyes taking in the size of their army. "Is that the change of plans? Just go there and march up to them?"
Draco reverted to sitting on the sofa, fiddling with his sleeves anxiously while waiting for Dudley to feel good enough to wake up and return to their company.
Only then they noticed that something was very off, even more than usual down in this sketchier part of London.
"Could you try?" Harry asked, looking at him with puppy eyes. "This shit really hurts."
"We have to go," Draco suddenly said.
"Indeed, Mr Potter. It's a spell, not from this land, not from this time, it has no name and not many people know it. But it has similar effects," Mrs Zabini said with a wide, confident smile. "It's not as potent, but it will last longer. This is what I can give you in addition to me being by your side."
Watching satisfied as the Dementors shot away, chased by all kinds of glowing animals, Harry pointed his wand at the ground. He fixed the damaged floor in front of them and took a small step forward, heart racing as he anticipated what might happen next.
The mood soon lightened a bit, once Harry had decided to order pizza for everyone including Draco, Ron and Hermione. For good measure Harry sneakily added four bottles of red wine to their order, knowing full well he'd get a headache from the cheap stuff they sold, but accepting his fate. Anything was better than living through this ordeal entirely sober. Especially when Draco came home and found his home already flooded with visitors.
"We'll use a Disillusionment Charm too and move slowly; it'll work out if we're quiet," Harry replied, gratified that the bunch of them cared so much.
Lucius Malfoy on the other hand looked disappointed, then still disappointed when he saw Harry, then even more disappointed as he laid his eyes on Draco. "You should have told us that there would be another guest, Draco."
"Thirty minutes. Watching father with this is every bit as funny as when I told him I was sorted into Gryffindor. But he's old, so you should call for Snuffles and end this before father dies." Draco snorted.
This was literally the worst thing he ever had to suffer through, and now even Draco started having enough of it.
At that everyone else slowly shuffled out of the room. There was nothing else to say. Harry had the feeling that Grimmauld would soon be not big enough anymore. It was their oasis in a wizarding world that seemed increasingly intimidating and frightening.
"So? What can they do? Put me on the wanted list a second time?" Harry snorted, flashing a quick look back at Draco. "It worked, they're out cold."
"What do you think?" Harry asked.
Thirty minutes later the atmosphere started to slowly change from deeply worried to tipsy chatter, when a bright idea suddenly shot through Harry's mind. It was simple, and brilliant, and he couldn't for the life of him think why it hadn't come to him before.
"His wife," Ron and Harry said in unison.
The last thing that Harry wanted was to Floo into work the next day.
Harry looked around their empty apartment for one last time.
The floor underneath their feet was nearly hot enough to melt their shoes, but Harry pressed on, making as much ground as possible. This was their moment, their one shot. Harry couldn't afford to lose even an inch.
Draco looked flustered at that but regained his composure within seconds. "We all know he's with me because of my looks. He has even more money than I have anyway."
Draco,
The dogs slowed down in front of yet another group of bushes, sniffing the ground to discover whatever it was they were looking for. After a minute, they had found a nearly hidden path leading them deeper into the bushes and semi forest around them.
Harry sat on the sofa reading the
The wizarding world had fucked up many years before, letting innocent children fight in their war. Ron, Hermione, Draco and he? Each of them were now trained professionals, each with a set of skills that made them powerful, dangerous and a force to be reckoned with. They had the best witches and wizards the UK had to offer by their side too; each and every one of them were ready to kick some Ministry arse.
Gasping, Harry tried to take in that betrayal, but at the same time lost it at how, for want of a better word,
"Do you think we knocked Robards out?" Hermione asked nervously. Harry had to bite back a smile; she had never been all that comfortable not following the rules.
"Hungry?" Harry asked the mop of dirty blond hair that was visible in the pile.
"Really?" Draco had the nerve to look surprised at his flatmate's comment. Not for the first time Dudley asked himself whether this guy would be able to survive on his own.
"I asked you a question, Mr Potter.
"I knew what I signed up for." Ron shrugged. "I wonder how many people believe what the papers say. I reckon it's rather old news at this point. This trick is so old it has cobwebs on it. I don't think it'll work again."
"Don't even try this bullshit on me!"
Moaning into Draco's mouth, Harry dug his fingers into Draco's flesh, forcing himself to keep his hands from Draco's neglected cock.
and stuck his entire arm into a hole in the wall that hadn't been there moments before, "but I think that's on purpose. We should leave it the way it is, she'll know once she comes back."
Entirely satisfied, Harry leaned back and waited for Draco to finally decide on what they would watch.
"Don't hurt me! I'm coming! There's no need to use curses!" came a shaky, quivering voice from the back room. Harry and Ron exchanged glances.
"Yes, Mrs Granger! We went there right after Mr Potter asked us for help. Pebble has made the helpers split into teams, we've been working there all around the clock!" Harry had to chuckle. The elf's ears were flapping in her enthusiasm. "One team works, one takes a break, just as the Misses has told everyone. I thinks we'll be done by tomorrow night, Mrs Granger." At her last words, Pebble nearly started to vibrate from excitement.
"So you think you can just march over here and disturb us?" McLaggen snorted. "You're not even worthy of breathing the same air as we do. Who do you think you are?"
And things slowly got annoying.
Choosing not to wait for Draco, Harry ran into the house and towards the Floo, greeting Blaise on his way in.
"Yes. We had a few Order meetings at his house after the war."
At that Harry heard her turn around and leave, and seconds later Draco scoffed. "She's just as annoying as you are. What did I do to deserve the pair of you?"
Sighing, Harry stepped forward and removed the blindfold from her eyes, hoping that that would calm her down.
Staring down into huge blue eyes, Harry played with her curly blond locks which seemed to distract the tiny girl from her crying for the moment.
"Kingsley, are you okay? Is someone threatening you?" Harry asked carefully. His old, well-respected mentor was a broken man.
Stepping forwards, Harry crouched down in front of her to look at her face, waiting impatiently for her to look back at him.
"I told you it's him!" Pansy crowed, her whole body creasing in laughter. "I told you! But no, you wouldn't believe me."
Harry knew his way around the Manor. He had been visiting it for years. Draco was his best friend, they had shared a dorm for seven years and they worked the same position nowadays too.
Looking for the remote, Harry let his eyes glide over the sofa. What he found instead made his brain stop working for a minute. This couldn't be what he thought it was. But it was either that, or he was hiding the remote for some reason.
"Well Auror Potter, there has to be a good reason but that's one that not even I'm aware of yet. Those names are all people who were in some way involved with Death Eaters, or suspected to be involved with them. Yesterday's questioning obviously didn't bring the expected results so now it's up to us to bring in the rest of them."
And the arm stayed there for most of the day. Malfoy made sure to touch him at any given time, there was no chance anyone would look at them and confuse them as friends. Not with the way Draco cooed over him at any given moment.
It wasn't like he hadn't tried to find something else. But nobody in the wizarding world was willing even to speak to him, and he didn't qualify for anything in the Muggle world due to lack of references.
," the witch shuddered. "Listen boys, I know you're just doing your job. But I'd appreciate getting back home. So if you'd check in in a week, just to double check that they've let me go, I'd be very grateful. I don't trust them, never did." She Accio'ed her coat and her tall, pointy hat. "But I think I can trust you, I can sense it. You have caught up, you might not know what they are doing, but you know that it's wrong. You'll help us."
Turning around, Harry had to see whether it was true. He didn't like this at all. Feeling as trapped as a chained dragon, Harry hid his wand in his sleeve, just to be sure he could reach it if necessary.
"Fire, like you asked for! It'll stop in a minute, no worries!" Seamus called back.
Harry
"It looks like it's the only idea we have so far," Draco said grimly, his fingers unconsciously picking at a loose thread on his sleeve.
"I had a lot of fun today, thanks for coming with me," Harry said, quiet enough so only Draco could hear.
The smile hadn't left Draco's face, so Harry shrugged and got up, allowing Draco to lead their way.
Making their way through the house, Harry marvelled at the changes the house-elves had made. Grimmauld looked almost unrecognisable. The whole building was warm, cosy and hospitable. Harry briefly wondered if they had managed to get rid of the nasty tapestry with all the Black family members sewn into it, but that thought vanished when Draco bumped against him by accident.
Life went on. The newspapers were a constant hassle, with their angry, blaming headlines and their controversial opinions. It was about time for Harry and Draco to get away from everything and start their new careers at Hogwarts, learning under the current Professors how to educate the future of wizarding society. Harry could only pray that they would make less of a mess of it.
"Any history of openly violent behaviour?" Harry queried. "Or will this be an easy one for once?"
"Very well, Mr Potter. Please be careful."
"Possible," Draco agreed, sounding very impressed with the older witch. She had displayed a very Slytherin level of cunning. "I'll water her plants and see which ingredients I can find here."
"Okay. Yes. If something's off I'll leave." Draco bit his lip and looked around. "Thanks for warning me. We need to invite the others tonight, let them know what's happening."
He knew none of those people. Not a single name sounded even slightly familiar. Wishing not for the first time that the wizarding world had something like Google, or any kind of easy data research, Harry handed the parchment back to Ron. "We have to go to the archive and ask Mathilde for old case files and whatever else she can give us about them. Any details could help us, mate. I don't know any of those names."
Once he was standing at the big gates, Harry smiled and he reached out to touch them, announcing himself to the castle, the Headmistress and probably half of the elves. Seconds later there was a
"Oh right, forgot about that," Draco laughed, pulling his wand from his pocket. "I really like that one, It makes us see each other but nobody else can unless I put the spell on those too. Found it in a book at the department."
Harry listened closely so he wouldn't miss anything. Luna had become a great Healer, and Harry trusted her with his life.
Walking towards the office, Harry cast a strong shield around himself and left the others to deal with the final few straggling Aurors.
"You heard what she said," Ron said worriedly. "It doesn't sound like they ever Kissed him. We don't know if Fudge actually watched the Dementors after ordering them to Kiss him," he carried on. "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't, and we all know Voldemort had them under his control later. He could've easily influenced some of them back then. We don't know when and how he acted."
Draco felt the need to punch McLaggen when he saw him secretly adjusting his dick. This went too far. McLaggen was standing way too close to Harry, whispering in his ear while letting his hand glide down Harry's arm.
"Improvise sounds good," Harry said grinning at her. Now that they had a plan of action and it was time to get moving, he was feeling better. "Can't be worse than planning, right?"
"I think I'm in love with her. Do you think she'll adopt me? Draco Millen? I could keep the towels with my initials. This house is amazing. You should bring Longbottom here, he'd faint and wet his pants."
"Wow. You didn't lie about not dressing up for this, Potter."
"What do we do now?" Hermione asked quietly.
Letting his head rest back on the floor, Harry felt as all the stress and tension were draining his body, as tears streamed down his bleeding, broken face.
Thirty minutes later Harry found himself knocking on Kingsley's door, still not sure how he was supposed to start the conversation. A simple 'Kingsley your fucking Dementors are on the loose' didn't sound appropiate to him, but he wasn't sure what else to say.
Harry immediately felt his mood improve. "We'll come over tonight, yes? Or do you think coming to our place would be better?"
"Bad day at work?" Harry asked, putting down the
He couldn't look at Draco. If he said no Remus had to get a new dog. He didn't want to see their friendship end like—
That done, and at least partially satisfied, Harry and Ron led the others upstairs.
So obviously, and Harry would have appreciated if they'd have told him sooner, male pregnancies had to have a little extra spice to them.
"I don't know all their names," Mrs Robards answered as tears started to stream down her face. "There are many people involved… and my husband never told me what was happening until it was too late! They invaded our home, they made Gawain plot against his friends which ended up in Kingsley's death." She sobbed, her voice breaking as she spoke. "And they will kill us too, once they don't need us anymore."
An earth shattering scream from somewhere at the lifts made Harry jump even though he had known it was coming. Robards had obviously heard it too, and he ran out of his office to investigate what was happening.
"You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you Potter?" the cold voice said. "I have the entire Ministry at my hands. I have a few surprises left for you."
"Not the remote. As I said, Potter."
"Doesn't look like it, no. Take a look at the list and tell me what you think."
"Impressive," Crouch's voice echoed through the smoky air. "There are many amongst your ranks that could have been of great use to me. But sadly, fire won't help you with my final surprise, Potter. They can fight for themselves, let's see how hard you'll go after your colleagues, shall we?"
"Uhm," Harry stuttered, "maybe snacks? Depending on how much you've planned to drink tonight."
Harry wasn't satisfied with that answer. "But if not even you know what's going on, who's doing the questioning then?"
Entering the room, Harry started to look through the perfectly labelled potions searching for Veritaserum and Polyjuice. Finding a bottle of Amortentia, Harry huffed out a laugh and removed his Bubble-Head Charm, then opened the lid to smell it. It was still heavy on the broom polish, but now other scents had mixed into his former ones.
"They're coming for you," Harry said, his voice flat with appalled shock. Whatever we left in our flat is gone for now." Turning to Ron and Hermione, Harry only needed to send them one look and his two best friends understood. Jumping up, they both ran for the Floo to get what they needed from their house before the Aurors, or whoever Robards sent for them, inevitably arrived.
"Desperate times..."
Right at that moment Harry felt as awkward as a teenager. "Hey! I'm good at my job! Hermione just has a very unique view on everything and we trust her to see those things that everyone else misses."
"You're welcome," Draco grinned. "Now eat. I didn't waste ages making you the best soup you ever ate just for you to let it go cold."
He hadn't seen a full Ministry meeting yet. As a result, Harry had never realised how many people actually worked here until he had to find an empty spot big enough to fit him and Ron in the moving mass of witches and wizards.
Grabbing Mrs Robards' arm, Harry Apparated them both to Grimmauld Place, knowing that every second would count, and that they were disappearing as quickly as grains of sand though a time now.
"The Ministry started arresting people this week who were in any kind of way related to Death Eaters and their doings," Harry began, rolling his glass around in his hand. He hated being the bearer of bad news. "Robards even asked me if I trust Draco. It all began earlier this week. There were a few arrests, and a few people brought in for questioning." He paused, looking at the faces of all of his friends. "Today though? Nearly all qualified Aurors were called in and handed a list of suspects to arrest without an explanation. Ron's and my list included ten people, no idea how many the others had."
Did you know the sorting hat thought about placing me in Slytherin?
"No you obviously can't!" Draco screamed, the near-hysteria of his voice testimony to how frightened he had been. "And I can't do this anymore either! I can't sit around and hope you'll survive the next day, and the day after, over and over again, just because you have to play the hero! That's just—"
"Fantastic!" Mr Weasley clapped his hands together as his smile grew even bigger. "I'd better be going and help Molly prepare everything for later. See you soon, Draco!"
"I've done nothing wrong! I haven't left this forest in three years! There's no reason for you to come and get me! Sliding up to my house like spies! Don't you go believing I'm stupid! People are going missing, people nobody are looking for and I won't be the next one on that bloody list!"
Rolling his eyes, Draco padded his bare feet out of the room which didn't help at all to calm Harry's rapidly approaching laughing fit. It was the easiest and happiest that Harry had felt all day. Harry finally lost it, dissolving into small chuckles when Draco came running back into the room and told him that Molly was awake and saw him in Harry's jumper. Apparently the witch had immediately promised to make him his own.
"I brought some of your clothes along in case you have to leave too," he said, pulling the coat hangers apart to demonstrate what he meant. "Just so I could be sure you had something to wear. I assumed you would notice as soon as you got home anyway," Draco admitted, not quite looking him in the eyes.
"You're welcome, Potter. Wake yourself up properly, then we can go downstairs and meet the others. Hermione sent Neville and Blaise on another stakeout to take pictures and they're also back now."
Not waiting for an answer, Hermione turned and left the room, already pulling another piece of parchment out of another pocket. Harry marvelled at her organisation and, not for the first time, wondered why she hadn't been sorted Ravenclaw.
Dudley would gladly handle another kitchen fire, or two, if this was the outcome.
Skin and bones was everything that was left of him. But Harry knew that even though he didn't look like his old self anymore, Malfoy hadn't lost any of his snark.
They went to the cinema and visited friends. Had a nice night out with a romantic dinner, and a stroll through the park near their house. And then Harry went and got some stickers and pictures for the nursery, deciding the walls were too empty.
Feeling anger boil in his chest Harry started to run.
Looking at him, Draco formed the word 'idiots' with his mouth before he decided to step in.
"What… exactly are you two talking about?" Hermione asked, her confident voice suddenly unsure.
Sending a dick pic is not helping. Why the hell would that change my mind?
" Draco stated, "and I'll take
"Show me my bedroom, Potter! I need some sleep to get over this trauma."
"You know what's better this time?" Draco asked, and Harry could hear the smile in his voice.
Rolling his eyes, Harry hurried out of the room to use the fireplace downstairs. He had to move quickly and make fully sure that things were safe at their apartment before Draco decided to ask Pebble to get him there. He knew how impulsive Draco could be on occasion.
This year not even that would happen.
"Blaise has a Pensieve, would you mind sharing this memory with us?" Hermione asked, already sitting at the edge of her chair. Her body language was keen and excited, and Harry could see she was in her element. She'd be a great leader one of these days.
"Let's just go and get it over with."
"Thank you, Draco."
"There was an emergency investigation yesterday. The gas explosion was confirmed and the case is closed. I understand why you of all people ask this question, Mr Potter." Robards paused then, unconsciously straightening the parchment pile with the end of his finger. "Please be assured that I myself was on the scene and I did everything I could. Go home for today, take a day off, Auror Potter. We're not doing anything today."
The rest of the family jumped on board mere minutes later. A few quick spells and the living room was mostly empty of furniture and now featured a small dancefloor.
and he's obviously leading this party because they've been waiting for new orders from him."
Great. That meant there really was something up, and he was anything but happy about that situation. Hopefully Ron had more luck reaching Hermione last night and she was on her way home. Until then there were a few things they could already do.
"Was this the reason you hogged the bathroom?" Harry asked, as he let his hands glide up Draco's legs carefully, barely touching him.
Harry grinned. "Honestly, seeing that it's you, just be the poncy arsehole you were in school, brag about your wealth whenever they are near to hear you and I think we should be fine. I can't wait to show them my arsehole boyfriend. This will be brilliant."
This was the opportunity Harry had been hoping for.
"You're probably right. I don't think the
"Dear Salazar, spit it out already, " the witch laughed, amused. "I don't have as much lifetime left as you."
happened all morning. Not even a bakery run this time. Only a few youngsters who like to pet cats."
"You're welcome, Mrs Granger." McGonagall turned to leave but decided otherwise in the last second to glare in the direction of Draco. "Horace is retiring, just so you know."
He was absolutely not happy about it. He'd far rather have stayed at home in a haze of self-pity and raw grief for the mentor he had lost, than have to go into the DMLE's offices with a fake smile plastered on his face, pretending that nothing had happened the night before.
"Make sure to come back, Potter," Blaise said while looking sternly in Harry's direction. "I don't fancy Granger having my bollocks for letting you go, and I'd prefer to not lose my oldest friend because he grew too fond of a bloody Gryffindor."
Harry watched as Ron sprinted into the kitchen and came back with a huge casserole hovering in front of him, and it smelled absolutely delicious. Together they left the small house to go back to Grimmauld Place. Luckily they arrived right in time to stop Greg from prepping a quick lunch for everyone.
"Uhm. A few years," Harry admitted quietly, looking at Draco's flushed face.
"Good. I expect you lot to get onto this right now. You have one week to find them all and bring them here. Potter, a word in my office as soon as we're done."
"Nice try! Why don't you show your face instead of letting us walk into traps!" Draco shouted, his voice loud and ragged, full of an anger that had lain unrevealed for years. "The Dark Lord would be ashamed of your pathetic efforts to stop us! He at least had the balls to show his true face once he was confronted!"
"I need new glasses," Harry grumbled annoyed as he took them down to clean them on his sleeve. "Do you think Robards is already back from the Ministry?"
"If I can't leave, the others also shouldn't go, Potter," Draco said, his cheeks flaming. "I'm not some wet-behind-the-ears first year baby! Just check if it's safe to come through first, I'll even wear your damn cloak for packing," Draco carried on, his voice annoyed.
The later it got, the more relaxed Harry felt. Everything went just brilliant. Draco was an excellent fake boyfriend.
Water. There was water everywhere. And everything hurt.
"What the f—?" Ron started, but then a cold wall hit them and they both backed up against the shop, their feet slithering over the cobbles. "Shit. What the everloving fuck are they doing here?"
"Malfoy?"
First he looked at the piles of files on the desk but couldn't find anything suspicious, just regular parchment files, not a single one of which seemed to be relevant to the mass arrests. Next Harry went through the drawers and snorted at the fact that Robards used standard locking spells for all them. Honestly, he had expected more from the Head of the Auror office. After five minutes the wizard still hadn't found a thing and time was running out.
I showed them a dick pic, told them it's yours and that I have no issue with it.
Harry heard Draco snort at that before he yelped out; Ron obviously still held his candle and was able to repay the Slytherin for his haughty snort. Shaking his head, Harry tried to make out the figures outside, but the amount of whisky he had racing through his veins didn't help at all. "So what's happening out there?"
"No Hermione, you don't get it. We were out watching Robards' house and I—"
He couldn't help but tear up at the thought of them being parents soon. He wondered what their baby would look like.
Draco,
Leading the dogs back out onto the path, Harry ran. He ran until he saw the lights of their home in front of him. The dogs didn't mind some extra exercise. Out of breath, his lungs burning like fire, Harry rang his neighbour’s doorbell and waited for one of them to open the door to push the lashes into their hand. "Urgent personal business, see you tomorrow!"
Mr Weasley's genuine smile and warm eyes made Draco choke up a little, and he had to cough before he was able to speak again.
Ron came in at the very moment Harry was signing the memo to the Head of the Department of Mysteries, telling her that Draco had come down with a bad case of the Mufflemumps but that he'll be probably back in the Department the following week.
"Yes. How long have you been on the streets?"
"—make sure they're not after your friend too. I understand. I'll see what I can do for you."
But soon he'd start gaining weight, and his belly would grow, and he could direct that knowing smirk currently reserved for Harry onto everyone else.
"When?" Lucius Malfoy pressed through gritted teeth.
"Yeah, you're probably right. But still."
in the last few years have you?" Harry huffed as he pulled Malfoy closer.
"So, she probably also knows what's up," Pansy said, staring at the two of them. "Do you think we could somehow get her? She'll talk with Veritaserum, no matter how much she loves him. And if she resists then we can show them what we learned last time evil forces tried to seize hold of our world. I haven't forgotten them. I know that none of you have either!"
"I got you the first five files I could find and will send the rest to your office by the start of next week. That way, they can't make you work on the weekend." Mathilde winked and Harry sent her a grin.
"Mum?" Ron's face displayed pure horror, but then it switched to confusion as soon as Hermione ran up to them.
I'm gay, Potter, and I can't marry my betrothed. I need to tell my parents, but I'm scared.
Groaning, Draco stomped through the crowd, trying to look over the heads of people and see if he could find an unruly mob of dark hair.
The two of them Apparated straight to Hogsmeade and then took the well known path to Hogwarts.
"No. Not Aurors," Harry whispered back. "Nobody I know. They don't look like people I'd like to talk with." The wizarding world was small, and Harry recognised many people from sight alone.
Until it happened.
"Mum, you’re scaring him. I'm sure our little snake would never lie to you," one of the twins chimed in with a snort.
Racing upstairs, Harry got held up at nearly every door for a chat and his friends telling him how great it was that they could stay at Grimmauld for a while, and Harry couldn't help but feel as if he'd burst with the joy of having all them here. Part of him felt like he was back at Hogwarts, surrounded by all the people he loved and cared about.
Draco had taken the potions for only a month when St. Mungo's gave him the happy news.
This move was the most impressive thing Harry had ever seen happen on those grounds, so he got up and clapped for whoever it was. It was entirely surprising then, when Harry found himself in a full body bind and dropping to the ground the next second.
"No. If they wake up they'll be able to see us," Draco said, working his lip and looking at the crumpled bodies of the Stunned wizards and witches. "I want to keep us hidden as long as possible."
"Sir, Ron and I need to go to Knockturn Alley," Harry called over to Robards who was still trying to get rid of the mess. "We'll take the staircase."
"You're not, my boy. Sadly. It doesn't sound good. How can we help?"
"Don't you think people will find it a bit strange that we vanished right after the Minister of Magic died? They'll suspect us," Blaise grumbled.
Hermione called it nesting, Harry called it making sure everything was clean, and in order.
It feels strange writing you a letter, and I'm not exactly excited to do so. But you are my last and also only chance.
"We have the Slytherins on our side."
The only thing Harry knew was that he needed to get to Ron and Hermione before he lost his mind entirely. It was, of course, the second time in less than a week that Harry found himself colliding with their small table opposite the Floo.
There was a tense silence in the kitchen when Draco and Harry walked in. It felt way too stuffed with people, even though the room was large. Anxious magic coiled and curled, and the tension was thick. He wasn't sure if all of those assembled would go with them, or whether some had only come by to wish everyone luck, but somehow thinking of all of them as a small army didn't feel all that wrong to him anymore.
I'll personally bind you to this chair and call Hermione over. The fucking Ministry knows that you know that they're telling lies and yet that shit is too dangerous for
Humming in agreement, Draco got up and let out a yawn of his own. Getting ready for bed, they stood in silence in front of the bathroom sink to brush their teeth before they both went to their separate bedrooms, leaving their doors open for the first time in what felt like ages.
"Is this a joke, Potter? Because if it is, I will curse you. I was excited for this."
"You'll have Rose to keep you company, and don't listen to your father. You won't die, and you'll have a good pillow. What else could you wish for?" Draco answered with a big grin on his face as Scorp came walking into the room.
"Me either. I prefer my partners to be able to keep up with me. I like them with a bit more mass, if you get my meaning. Potter might have filled out a good bit by now, but I still see a Bowtruckle whenever I look at him. No thanks! But Draco here has always been obsessed with him."
"Nothing better than a duel on a Friday afternoon, Auror Potter. That way you'll do everything you can to not end up at St Mungo's. Looks like your weekend depends on your success. Backup will take five to ten minutes to arrive, so be careful! Good luck, stay alert," Robards said and sent him off with a nod. "Merlin be with you."
"I'll quit my job. Ask McGonagall to hire me. I'd be Hagrid's assistant, anything but going back to that place. I quit. I'm done."
Harry stared at the picture of Sirius or, should he say, Snuffles, chasing peacocks. He was followed by Lucius Malfoy who was in far more distress than Draco's words had said.
"Probably," Arthur laughed. "But I wouldn't learn how they worked if I never took them apart. And if I don't know how they work, I can't figure out how to make them work around magic either."
"Potter, Weasley, I just wanted to check if there's anything I could bring tonight? Beer? Wine? Draco didn't know."
Looking over, Harry made sure that Draco was still with him, and therefore missed the moment when the first tile at his feet began to crumble.
Looking up, Harry stared at Draco and dropped the note onto the table.
"Well, Mr Potter. At least one thing never changes. You still rely on Mrs Granger to tell you what to do next. That's somewhat refreshing, but seeing that you're heading towards the Head Auror position also rather frightening," McGonagall huffed, cutting straight to the point.
As predicted, Malfoy hadn't moved since Harry had left him. "Is there anything you need from here? I'll hide your tent, nobody will get into it while you're gone."
Feeling some of the fight leave his body, Harry furrowed his brows as he thought about what he really, truly knew. And if he had to be brutally honest, it wasn't a lot. "So you're saying to find out what's going on, then we'll find out how to stop it."
"You fell, probably too much to drink. We're waiting for a team to take you with them, they have a few questions to ask you but will also make sure you didn't hit your head too hard," Ron answered without batting an eye. Harry had to smile. To think that it was he that was almost sorted Slytherin!
Draco had put the glasses down and pointed his wand at Harry's face before Harry could do as much as open his mouth in protest.
As expected both Pansy and Hermione were in raptures at the news, both gushing over Draco and throwing Harry pitiful looks when they heard that he had to suffer through the symptoms instead of Draco.
But seeing Draco's silhouette in front of the open window where the sun shone bright, and the trees were whispering their stories was enough to make Harry cry again.
"Fine by me as long as I can have a room in whatever you're going to build." Dudley grunted before slapping the TV. "That'd spare me the job of trying to fix this blasted thing."
Then they tried to stay in different rooms, making things even more awkward when they met by accident.
Locking the house again, the three Apparated back to Grimmauld Place. As soon as they opened the door they were smacked into the face by a cacophony of sound and busy, scurrying people bustling around the house.
The grins that spread over both their faces were probably a terrifying thing for the others to see for there was suddenly an eerie silence, and several sets of confused faces looking in their direction.
Draco didn't move his hand away, and neither did Harry, as they stayed in bed together waiting for the hour to pass.
"I want you to cut the veggies and not touch anything that could break, shatter or burst into flames. That's what I want," Dudley grumbled as he got up. No chance he'd deal with another catastrophe if he could do anything to prevent it.
Disappointed, Harry locked the drawers again and then he left Robards' office hoping that his boss wouldn't notice someone had been in there.
"Thank you Pebble," they both said before the elf left them alone once again.
"So impatient," Harry sighed amused as he climbed into the bed himself.
"There's never enough spoiling me. You of all people should know that, Potter."
. Thankfully the horrible curse missed them due to them still being invisible.
any potions, you brat."
"Just—one second, please. Okay," Harry felt a headache coming. Draco would surely kill him, so it didn't really matter how he said it as long as he did. "I know you
By the time they left the bride's room, there were already guests arriving and Harry was just about to nudge Malfoy so he'd know to start behaving coupply when suddenly there was an arm around his middle.
Furrowing his brows, Ron gave him a concerned nod before he followed Harry towards the front where Robards still stood. The older wizard was still sorting through some parchment notes he had held. As soon as they were close enough Harry forced his sadness over Kingsley's loss to take over his livid anger, before he stepped out in front of Robards.
At that Ron actually snorted, and Harry shot him a confused look, just as Draco rolled his eyes at him and left.
I'm positive my evening will be very nice now that they're about to leave. Yours on the other hand will not.
Draco Malfoy was pregnant. And Harry's mind was blown.
"Good. I have a dinner date tonight, and I really don't want to miss that," Harry snorted, before he sent the first spell towards Crouch who answered him promptly.
"Draco, can you hide them with the same spell you hid us with? I don't care if someone trips over them as long as they don't see them first," Harry whispered, standing close to the blond-haired man.
Harry's blood froze at this question. If they were going to bring in all those people and if Robards was asking specifically for Draco, that couldn't mean anything good for the wizard. "Yes, sir. We still live together. He's working for the Ministry as I'm sure you know."
"Then we'll miss it," Draco hissed back into Harry's ear. "I think I recognised one of the people who entered, and if that's true this shit goes deeper than I ever thought. We have to go—now!—and see if Blaise has a memory of the person I think it might be in his Pensieve."
Harry put down his old diary as Draco walked into the kitchen and yawned as he reached for the kettle. He had woken up early and there was no chance of going back to sleep. So instead he had decided to look up some old memories until Draco and Scorp got up. Today was important, and there was no better day to relive those memories.
"I'll reinstall Grimmauld Place as a safe house, and will bring back the Order of the Phoenix if that's okay with you?" Harry said, unsure about what she'd think of that suggestion. He could only imagine the memories that those words would bring back.
Pansy was hit by another fit of giggles as Draco still stared at the untidy scrawl that definitely said
"Let's get Mrs Gardner first and then take care of this, they should be gone now so there's no immediate danger anymore."
"Ronald!" Hermione cried out, pulling on Ron's upper arm with all the urgency she could muster. "This is a very serious matter and not the right time to have
That all changed within a split second. Draco was walking further ahead of him, and if Harry had looked down, he wouldn't have seen the hands appearing from behind a tapestry to pull Draco into the secret passageway rather forcefully.
Malfoy was dead to the world within seconds. He didn't cough much in his sleep, which Harry took for a good sign. Things would get better for him, Malfoy would be healthy again in no time. And then they could take care of their next steps together. Because one thing was for sure, Harry wouldn't let him go back to being homeless.
How could he leave Draco in a place like this? Draco had no idea what he even was supposed to do all by himself and with a husband who was lost.
Harry laughed and shushed Scorp off before Draco could get too much into the topic of name-giving. They hadn't had time for that now. They had to be at the Burrow soon so Molly could hand out the snacks she had prepared her grandchildren for the train ride. A tradition he surely wouldn't miss for Scorps first year at Hogwarts. And especially not with what they had planned for today. Or rather what Scorpius had planned for the day of his departure.
"You know what, call your friend. But once I'm married to your son you won't ever treat him like this again. I want a written contract that you won't disown him, and that you'll only contact him on his terms. And that you'll also keep his name out of your dirty business. You're a disgrace, Lucius Malfoy, and I can't have you taint my name."
Agreeing, Ron waited for Harry to place the charm on himself before he did so too. Then they were ready to make their way down the staircase and go and investigate.
"Well, some people have to be superior. Not my fault that you're a crybaby who can't handle some pregnancy symptoms."
Letting his arm sink back to his side, Draco took a step back and took a deep breath. This was the last thing he needed. Another lesson in Muggle culture. Damned be the Ministry and their decision to make this part of his probation.
"Partially," she spat out, her eyes darting around the room. She looked like a Horntail caught in a poacher's cage.
"About three weeks ago? Maybe four?" Pansy twisted her ring around her finger as she spoke. "I didn't pay attention at first! I don't know if it's been many people or just the same person whose story got shared over and over again."
"Same, mate. I'll stay with George, he'd need my help even if it was only a regular day."
They won't be happy about this.
"How many bedrooms does this place have?" Draco asked.
"You better be," Draco said, giving the assembled Slytherins a wink. "See you later guys. Let's go, Potter."
"Yes Mother, if he had been at Diagon Alley, we would have seen him because we too just finished our Christmas shopping," the other twin piped up from behind the other one.
"A mix of a XXL Slime Bomb and Portable Swamp. George is still working on it," Ron replied, hiding a chuckle. "It's supposed to be for our Halloween line. But the red colour still dyes everything for more than 72 hours and so it's a pain in the arse to get rid of."
"Not everyone is as blind as a bat, Potter."
As Ron's back stiffened, Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at Mrs Millen. But the next second she had already leaned back and winked at Harry with a grin on her face. "I think we're ready to go, gentlemen."
Taking this rare opportunity, Harry decided to take a look around the house and check all the rooms, now that it finally didn't resemble the Shrieking Shack's more haunted cousin anymore.
He hadn't even the energy left to pace the hallway until Draco appeared, so he sat down on the cold floor and put his head on his knees while he waited. He was so anxious that he thought his heart was going to burst out of his chest.
Laughing, Harry scribbled a quick 'We're back. Holding Cell 15. Potter, Weasley' onto a memo and, with a quick swish sent the memo flying off to find Robards before he and Ron filled out the report.
"You better not be lying to me, young man," Mrs Weasley said sharply. "If I find out you just bought them we'll have a problem with each other."
Maybe he wasn't.
Remembering the portrait of Mrs Black and Dustledore waiting right in their places in the Entrance Hall, Harry bit his lip. "I hope they didn't give you a headache."
"That's one of the reasons you like me." Draco shrugged. "Can't be that bad then."
Just as Ron shrugged, the Floo in the backroom flared up and two wizards from the DMLE showed up to take Mr Peck with them. They were stony faced and serious, not even asking any questions about the old wizard's state.
"What if you wouldn't have to do this alone?" Harry burst out. "I follow you, yes. I knew this wouldn't end well, people are—what if we tell them they're mine? That I got you pregnant. We met for a drink after the hearing, and one thing led to the other—I follow you anyway. This could put an end to this."
They were alone now, with the disgruntled Ministry official and Malfoy's parents finally gone. Harry was still fuming and he didn't feel the tiniest bit sorry for what he had done.
He heard Draco sigh behind him. "That's all rather complicated. Let's just say, due to my father's past business dealings, I couldn't find anything better. And yes, if the world were only kind to me, I think I'd have enough money to buy this shitty apartment complex simply to raze it to the ground and build something better."
Thanking her, Harry looked over at Draco who still looked cross with him. "I'm sorry."
"Bad. I'd say you got him just in time. I don't know if he'd have made another night out there. But there's nothing that we can't fix with some time and care. I gave him some potions, and instructions on how to take them. I'll give you the instructions to remind him to take them and how to care for him. The Ministry broke his wand, he's not welcome in our world anymore, I can't take him to St. Mungo`s. But I'll come over every evening for the next few days to check on him."
Harry's plan worked out more than well. The shades on Petunia's face rushed through all the colours of the rainbow and left her white with a few ugly red blotches on her cheeks, while Vernon sat there like a big deep red balloon ready to burst at any moment. It was brilliant.
Mrs Millen, Aurors Harry Potter and Ron Weasley here from the Ministry of Magic, please open your door or we'll have to use force on it. We have an order to take you in for a questioning."
They were alive.
Secondly, every time Draco moved Harry lost his focus on the house and inevitably looked over at him. Then he'd find himself nose to nose with Draco and getting surprised every time.
When he pushed open the door, Harry ducked down straightway so the curse Crouch fired at him would fly over his head. Sighing, annoyed, Harry stared at him.
"A few days now, why?" Harry asked.
"Yes, I was at his place and he was off, he wasn't himself, it was like a part of his mind was broken, and then there were people coming, and—"
And that was when all hell broke loose.
Shaking his head, Draco forced his thoughts to go somewhere else. He wouldn't think of that. The idiot probably just got distracted by saving random peasants and then got shot. No!
It took Ron only the blink of an eye to pull up a new, tougher shield. Nodding at Harry he focused once again.
Pain shot through his body as Draco didn't stop there but shot curse after curse at Crouch until the Dark Wizard was nothing but a quivering mess on the floor. It was only then that Draco stunned him before he turned and looked at Harry with a look of pure fury on his face.
. His general appearance was appalling; his eyes were swollen and red and he looked at Harry with a nearly manic expression, before his chapped, bleeding lips broke into a hugely dangerous animalistic grin. "I've been waiting for you. Come in, rush, they can't see you."
When they stepped out of their office, Harry and Ron joined the steady stream of Aurors walking towards the staircase, all of them wise to the fact that lifts were probably already full.
was that?" Draco asked into the deafening silence of the shop.
"Uhm. No idea, honestly," Harry answered, taking in the comfortable surroundings that the elves had created. "But I know someone who can answer this. Pebble?"
"I hate when they resist," Ron murmured next to him and Harry wholeheartedly agreed.
Ignoring the possibility of spilled wine, Draco threw himself across the sofa to take the envelope back once again, staring at the little flap open mouthed. This couldn't be true. Not— "Potter?"
"You can go and ask them." The witch smiled. "Whomever volunteers can go and help you. That house was already in a bad state when we used it as Headquarters. Just make sure they come back two days before our children return," McGonangall said, looking at him over the thin metal frames of her glasses. "And Mr Potter, make sure to keep this trouble away from Hogwarts this time. I won't have a repetition of last time. Stay in contact, I want to know what's happening."
Suddenly there were people screaming as they came running from the direction Draco and Castiel were currently walking towards.
He found some people roaming the kitchen already and, thank Merlin, someone had boiled some water already so his tea was prepared in no time. Harry sat down grimly and stared at the steaming mug.
, the local wizarding pub in Penrith. From there it'd be only a short walk to her household.
"He won't listen to me until I do something rather stupid," Harry sighed.
Draco was snuggled up to him, radiating heat like he was made of Fiendfyre, and snoring ever so slightly. And the worst thing was that he couldn't even blame Draco for invading his space, since they'd obviously met each other in the middle of the bed whilst sound asleep.
"Because I knew it'd be good, better, if I waited for you to go to bed."
Stepping into the big room, Harry gawked and Draco laughed. It had been decorated in a very obvious Slytherin green and one could definitely call it a Master Bedroom. It was pompous, and nearly offensive in its size and ostentatious display of wealth oozing from every inch of the room. Alone, the bed was the size of a small flat if someone were to ask Harry.
"You have a rather spectacular business going here," Harry noted, not even trying to hide how impressed he was with the elderly witch.
To his surprise Malfoy's house didn't look like a mini version of the Manor, or even worse, Grimmauld Place. It was open and tidy, light colours and plants in every room, and it smelled like the sea and for some reason freshly baked bread. There was also electricity, Harry realised once Malfoy switched on the lights in his living room so Harry could pretend he had sat there to read for a while.
Stepping into the Floo Draco called Potter’s address.
Walking into the middle of the room, Harry and Draco watched as person after person walked out of the Floo and joined them until they were a mass of people blocking the entire entrance room.
Rolling his eyes, Harry followed the two effervescent dorks into the backroom where Ron got to work looking for the hidden store of potions.
"Thank you, Mr Potter," Robards replied, feigning grief. "My wife and I are truly devastated. I know you were friends too. I'm sorry for your loss and that you had to hear it that way."
"Too many," Harry answered. "There were the wizards who went to and from the bakery, plus the others that dragged Robards back in and at least one other."
Draco repeated Hermione's actions and shortly afterwards confirmed that one of them was indeed the chap they'd seen at Robards' house earlier.
Tonight was another night where Dudley wanted to curse out Draco's snobby parents.
"The mushrooms or the waterfall I see behind the house?" Ron snorted, casting his eyes all around the garden.
"WE COULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED BY NOW YOU PRAT!"
Draco casually walked up to them and pointed his wand at Mrs Robards. A bright white light emerged from the end. Then Draco turned to Harry. "I've put her to sleep, she'll be out for about six hours. Is that enough time for us to storm the Ministry?"
. With their suspect secured, Harry lifted him up with a spell, all the time checking he wouldn't have another burst of energy that made their spells ineffective. But Jasbert was still entirely knocked out. Pleased with the outcome, Harry grabbed Jasbert's shoulders and nodded at Ron. His partner was picking up Jasbert's wand before the three of them turned and Apparated back to the Ministry, Jasbert a dead weight wrapped in Harry's magic.
"You look like shit, mate," Ron observed, hanging his work satchel on the peg beside their desks.
, I'm not sure what you expect from me but I can't just snap my fingers and make everything be right again.
Dudley dragged his aching muscles upstairs. He couldn't wait to fall into his bed and sleep for a week straight.
"That's a bit drastic, don't you think?" Hermione asked, looking with concern at the other witch. "We should try less invasive things first and keep illegal drugs, potions, and the use of force as the very last option!"
Dear Potter,
"Thanks, I don't know why you can't just leave them where I can find them easily," Draco replied, Accio'ing the glassware he had wanted.
Ten minutes later, Harry finally found the Veritaserum. Taking four vials, he walked over to Ron who was staring mesmerised at a few bottles containing glowing red and blue potions.
"—worried, yeah sure. Let's go and get ready mate. But honestly, you have it so bad for him, and you should let him know once this is over. The pair of you. Honestly. You're unbearable."
"So Harry, tell me," she asked after taking a sip of wine. "Are you with him because of his money then?"
Not waiting for another invite, Harry stood up just to kneel back down in front of Draco.
They ate in silence, Malfoy even shyly asking for a second bowl, and then even a third, to which Harry’s only comment was an affectionate laugh. He was more than willing to give Malfoy as much food as he wanted.
The owl hopped right onto the table and dropped a small piece of parchment onto Harry's now vacant spot.
"Old Black house, Sirius left it to me. It's huge, dark and not very welcoming. But it's safe."
"Two years, give or take," Malfoy frowned. "Mother managed to hide some money for me before she fled so I could stay in cheap motels last winter. Needless to say that there wasn't anything left this year."
"I'm not even sure if they're still breathing," Blaise said, his voice loud in the darkness, and Harry allowed him to step forward and check the fallen wizard. "Yeah, he's breathing, but heavily drugged as far as I can tell. There's no chance we'll get him awake to answer questions."
"What are you talking about, Potter?"
Humming, Draco downed half of his drink before he leaned onto Harry's shoulder. "Tonight was…not nice to watch. It reminded me of the war. I have no idea how you can work as an Auror. All this fighting—the offensive spells, the intrigue—aren't you sick of it?"
Sitting down in the same spot as the previous night, Harry waited for Hermione to open the meeting. But, before she could do so, George burst through the door, panting and heavily out of breath. The wizard sank down into a chair. "News. I have..." he said gasping for air, "news. Heard something just as I wanted to close the shop."
"No. But they didn't ever help me down here. You spent half of your training here and even stayed to have lunch with me, so I'll gladly help you get your files first before I take care of the others."
Leaving her to take care of Malfoy, Harry went to the kitchen to get to work.
They waited until the elf was gone before they stepped out of the room and ran up the flight of stairs to the big dining room where, just as Pebble had insisted, everyone sat on comfy looking chairs with various drinks in their hands, waiting for them to arrive.
He couldn't believe he was doing this. Years! It's been years! And now he had to admit his crush in order to save Lucius Malfoy from a heart attack.
"Maybe things would work if you stopped stripping them down to the last part?" Harry chuckled.
"Okay. I'll let Hermione know. See you later, mate."
Another dinner with Pansy.
"My favourite view," Harry sighed. "I missed it. Your face looks like a work of art when you're horny."
Rolling his eyes, Harry used his Floo to get to Wiltshire.
At one point Draco prompted Vernon to have to excuse himself for a couple of minutes, and Petunia went after him, gushing about him having to think of his blood pressure.
"In Auror mode already, I see: plain information, no emotion," Ron giggled and Harry sent him a stern look.
Throwing him a dirty glare, Hermione gathered her notes. She left the room, telling Draco to let Blaise know that they'd leave in an hour.
"So how is he?" Harry asked while stirring his pot.
Suddenly all around them doors opened and Aurors and Hit Wizards flooded out into the charred hallway, surrounding them with pointed wands and empty, flat faces.
"I can heal him," Castiel suddenly piped in. "He'll be good as new. And then we could sit down somewhere and you tell us whatever Dean needs to hear so he can sleep tonight."
"Even more reason to hurry up then," Hermione said decisively. "
Taking a deep breath, Draco lifted his hand to knock on the door. But it opened before his knuckles could hit the worn out wood.
Usually Harry and Ron would lead them back out the same way they had come in, but time was rapidly running out for them. They all sprinted out of the front door and towards the street where Dean, Neville and Ginny were waiting for them as their backup.
Waiting for Hermione to cast the spell, Harry pointed his wand at the door in front of him. He waited, his heart in his mouth, as the seconds ticked by.
"I'm old, Mr Potter, not dead. I never gave up flying, even after my injury. Glad I can still impress my students after all these years." She sniffed in mock offence, though Harry could see that none was really taken.
"We can do that later," Harry replied with a decisive shake of his head. "I'll get my cloak and come back, then we can go to your places one after the other. I'll pack Draco's stuff while I'm at home."
Sitting down on the bed, Harry hoped this wouldn't go wrong. "There's a lot of people out there. And also a lot of rumors about you and your baby. I don't think you're safe, so I have to—is the father still in the picture?"
Around the fifth month Harry hadn't had to focus anymore to see Draco's growing tummy. He loved lazing around in bed, and letting his fingers wander over Draco's new curves, enjoying the feeling of soft skin underneath his fingertips and the love he felt for his husband and the tiny human growing inside of him.
Joining Ron in front of their office, Harry only shook his head and pointed towards the lift so they could Floo into the
Harry nodded before climbing on Draco's lap, heart beating in his throat as Draco started stroking him.
"Yes. Just made the decision to go in after the first contact on the list we were given. Recluse living in the forest, goes by the name of Jasbert, nobody knows what his real name is according to his case files," Harry said, glancing at Robards before looking back at Kingsley. "Sir, do you mind if I ask—"
Harry leaned closer to Ron before he whispered: "I think he saw what happened on Friday night."
"I don't think I'll get a third chance so I'll try my very best to stay alive," Harry chuckled lightly, wanting the look of anxiety to leave Draco's face. "Don't worry, we'll be fine."
Draco jumped at Pansy’s sudden scream, and as he looked over he found her staring at the letter in her hand, open mouthed.
"Promise you we'll eat together tonight," Harry said quietly, knowing Draco could hear his fear too, and knew that it was okay to feel vulnerable. It would do Draco a disrespect to let him believe otherwise.
Humming in agreement, Harry looked back at where the voice came from. "We've been sent to take you in for a questioning," Harry announced, his voice more confident than he really felt. "If you haven't done anything you'll be free to go before it gets dark. If you come with us now without any further attacks we'll let the first ones slide!"
The stranger came to a halt uncomfortably close to his face. "Did Dean send you to get me? Where is he? Take me to him."
"You're unbelievable."
Telling them that I'm very possessive and won't allow your nudes anywhere else other than in my bedroom was very weak.
"Me neither, but it's the Ministry, they don't change," Harry sighed, his shoulders shrugging with barely concealed annoyance. "If it worked before then they'll stick with it. You can't teach an old Crup new tricks. And it's a good way to bring attention to me again. Slander me, and make people disbelieve my story. No matter whether they believe it, people will tell their friends they saw me, others will take pictures, it's the perfect way for the Ministry to keep an eye on me without having to do a single thing. And an even better way to make sure I don't get in their way, considering I can't show my face any ruddy place."
He washed the clothes again, and repainted the room trice because he wasn't happy with the colour they had picked the first few times. He also decided that the baby’s bed was in the wrong corner and moved every piece of furniture until everything fit, back pain be damned.
"I have an owl, I can bring her next time I come and visit. Or Draco can bring you along next time he visits me."
"Lunch is ready. Ron made enough to feed the Slytherins too. We should pack everything up and go back to Grimmauld," Hermione noted as she looked up at the clock over the door.
Surprised by Malfoy actually speaking, not in an annoyed tone, but actually calm and soft, Harry looked at him, waiting to see if there’d be more.
"Are you still with us, Harry?" Greg asked as he elbowed him in the ribs.
"Ten," Pansy's shaking voice came from somewhere in the darkness. "They just offed someone I know in passing. He took one of those brutes with him though."
We are in immediate danger! The Minister is dead. Meet us at our home."
"How long has this been going on?" Harry asked as he reached Draco.
The result wasn't that bad. A bit shorter than he had his hair in school, but not too short. Harry was actually proud of himself for not making Malfoy look ridiculous on purpose.
"You didn't scare me off. I was just a bit overwhelmed, that's all," Harry said quietly. He cast his eyes over Sirius' name a final time. "Sorry for running away earlier."
"Guys, you're creepy when you're in Auror mode. Could you possibly just shut up?" Pansy asked. "There are people who might be dying outside the door and you're chatting about the
"I'm honestly surprised it took this long," Draco sighed as he finally accepted Harry's offered hand to get up.
The Manor had never felt that empty and cold before. Not even when the Dark Lord had been there. Cold, yes, but surely not empty. He always had his mother to go to.
Suddenly he realised what Sirius was doing here. This useless son of a two-legged kneazle!
"She did what?" Harry asked, perplexed.
"I think I'll never see enough of the world. Every new place is breathtaking and worth visiting, but—"
Politely letting an older witch step in front of him to leave, Harry glanced over his shoulder for one final time. He shuddered.
Grinning at Greg, Harry took a piece of paper and wrote the address down so everyone could read it before he burnt the piece of paper with a swipe of his wand. "Go there. If anything happens go there straight away. I'll know if someone crosses the ward and will come to you as soon as possible."
Harry had actually snorted when he read that.
Molly Weasley had joined with Mrs Malfoy and Mrs Zabini, and together they were something Harry could only describe as a deadly force, firing flashing, fizzing spells that lit up the room while they fought their way to the lifts.
Ginny stood from her seat next to Harry and, much to Harry's horror, called Draco to sit in her spot.
coins. Would you believe that most of our old members still have them? We'll all meet at Grimmauld this weekend, Harry, I'll give you a list of people to visit and tell them the address."
Malfoy had found the sofa by now, and made a big show of theatrically falling down on it. He exclaimed: "Greg is balls at silencing charms, and there are things I simply don't want to hear."
"Sounds like a plan."
Waking up, Harry found himself confused and way too warm.
I can help to iron out this mess a little. Therefore I have"—Hermione made a heavy pause while she reached into her jeans pocket and pulled out a small velvet bag—"this."
Ron nodded his agreement. "We'll have to go there today. We don't have a choice. Hermione won't like that."
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come over." The words were quiet, but Draco was sure Harry would hear him.
"They are. I'll try to make sure to get invited to more family events to take you with me."
deal with this on your own. I know you're not a damsel in distress. But what if—"
Looking back at the Headmistress, Harry grinned at her. "Was that you with that impressive move up there?"
"I'm sorry, sir. It's just rather—"
"Good," Draco said, obviously cheery now that he had gotten his way. "Let's see what room the elves have prepared for me. If it's anything less than the Master Bedroom I'll throw a fit, Potter! It's a Black house and I'm a Black after all."
"No I like Gator, it sounds funny. And he listens to it, so we won't change it. And I don't think Dad is bad in naming things. My name is fine. And the toilet spider doesn't need a good name. It's a spider that lives in the restroom."
Thank Merlin, Hermione had finally let go of the bottle. He poured himself another drink before he told his other best friend the entire story including what they had seen happening at Robards' house.
"You can't be serious?!?" Lucius Malfoy roared the second Draco had closed his mouth. "Do you have any idea how hard it was to find you a suitable wife? How much time I've spent with Mr Greengrass to make this betrothal happen?"
"We didn't tell my parents because my father can't be trusted."
"I can go alone," McGonagall said, casting her eyes around the assembled circle. "Nobody saw me leaving Hogwarts. They don't expect a stray cat to be anything more than a stray cat. I'd be in and out in five minutes and we'd know if Kingsley really is—" Her voice broke at the last part.
"Do you want to cut off my hair?" Malfoy asked after long minutes of silence in the bathroom. "That's a once in a lifetime offer, Potter."
"First sleep. Tomorrow I'll visit the Burrow to talk to Arthur and Molly. You could come with me, they'd love to see you again. It's been a while since we darkened their doors. Also I thought about checking Grimmauld Place. I have no idea what state it's in at this point, and it looks like we'll need it."
"There you both are," Draco said as soon as they left the passage. "I thought you two idiots had died down there, sniffing a few too many potions or something."
"Good." Some of the annoyance left Robards' expression. "That's not the reason I asked you to come here though. Do you still live with Draco Malfoy?"
At that piece of news Harry's head snapped up. He stared at the back of Draco's head, upset that events had happened beyond his control. He was already opening his mouth to protest when he got interrupted by Draco.
Due to the lack of space, Draco had to climb half on Potter's lap to sit somewhere. And Potter, who had no sense of decency, decided to use Draco's shoulder as a headrest while they both watched silently as everyone around them got drunk.
“That’s kind of a loaded question.” She said quietly. “Um. She’s smart, she’s beautiful, she’s kind, and she’s loyal. Also have you ever seen her talk about something she’s likes? It’s amazing. She gets all glowy and her eyes light up. It’s like a million stars and a million moons were taken from the sky placed into her eye one by one.” Pansy gushed.
