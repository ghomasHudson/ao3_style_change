Draco stepped into the room, closing the door behind him, and forcing Harry to back up.  Reaching out, Draco grabbed at the scarf around Harry’s neck and pulled.
“‘ello all” he grinned.  “I wasn’t sure ‘ow many of you was comin’ back.  Most of ya, by the look of it.”
Murmurs were heard throughout the hall.  It wasn’t a great secret, but there was never any official notification.  Harry suspected many of the students didn’t know about it.
Draco turned away as he zipped up his trousers. “I . . . you took it from me,” he said quietly. “I feel . . .”
Harry closed the journal and put down the quill.  Draco walked out onto the balcony and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry looked up at him and smiled.
Smiling, Harry caressed Draco’s cheek. “You are brilliant.  I’m sorry.  I promise not to keep things from you anymore.”
Subconsciously, Draco rubbed at his forearm. He poured himself another drink.  “It was excruciating.  Aunt Bellatrix and that fucking Greyback held me down.  I thought I was prepared for the pain . . .”
Harry and Draco looked at one another.  Neither one wanted to be the one to break the news.  However, Harry felt it was his duty.
Only having bottomed a handful of times, Draco tentatively climbed onto Harry and positioned himself over the weeping hard on waiting for him.
Reducing his pace to a less frenzied rhythm, Harry again leaned down to suckle her breast, this time, the right. Her responsive moan encouraged him to use his tongue to tease her nipple.  Pansy leaned back slightly on her hands to allow him better access.
“Keep,” the Slytherin Head called out.  He was sitting on the other side of the room, mirroring Harry’s actions of throwing items into either the trash, keep or donate pile.
Harry slipped off the shirt that Draco was barely wearing and let it fall to the floor.  He knelt down and finished unbuttoning the fly on Draco’s jeans.  He looked up at Draco, his green eyes more intense than ever while he pulled Draco’s cock free of its confinement.
Harry snickered, reluctantly getting out of bed.   He slipped on a bath robe to answer the door.  It was a surprise to see McGonagall on the other side.
Now that it was over, Harry was a bit ashamed of his behavior.  It didn’t matter that she initiated it.  He didn’t even have any real feelings for her.
Harry was beginning to think Slughorn only invited Miranda in order to flirt with her.  Perhaps he and Draco were wrong about his sexual orientation after all.
They continued to walk toward the Great Hall for the Valentine dance.  As they approached, Knox walked into the large foyer.  He stopped and appeared to vacillate between running away and crying.
“I found out that Boot and Cornfoot were stirring up trouble with my father.  I was afraid he’d take drastic action against you. And I was right.  McGonagall still wouldn’t let me come here, the cunt.”  He glanced at Hermione. “Oh, sorry.”
Draco opened the door to their quarters and held it open for Harry.  He leaned against the door after he’d closed it.
Harry held up Draco’s hand and kissed the back of it.  “It’s just research.  It’s you I have a date with later.”
“I explained to your father that he was being hasty when he expressed his desire to cut you off.  When you’ve outgrown this phase–”
The petite blonde girl smiled.  “That one was owned by a muggle born witch called Nell about a hundred years ago.”  She opened up the case and handed it to Ron. “Her lover, a wizard named Wyatt, gave her the bracelet with one charm, the tiny wand.  Every year, he added another charm.”
“No, you shouldn’t.” Harry stepped closer and drew Draco into a hug.  “You have no reason to be.  I love you.”
disappeared.  Harry was becoming frustrated.  It was difficult enough for Harry to write down his feelings.  To have everything he wrote scrutinized was aggravating.  He looked at the words on the page.
When Harry and Knox parted ways, Harry suggested that Knox could write up the proposal for the new curriculum on his own.  Disappointed, Knox agreed.  But he’d find a reason to get together with Harry alone somehow.
Hermione stepped back and looked at her friend.  She took the helmet off him and carried to the clerk.  Harry fussed with the scarf while she paid for Ron’s gift.  And soon the two were out on the street once more.  The snow had stopped, though it was still very overcast.
“He’s still in surgery.  They found another bleeder.”  He shuddered.  “This brings up bad memories.”
“I thought for certain the two of you would have gotten back together by now,” Draco commented as he sat waiting for the end of the year feast to begin. Blaise, sitting across from him, scowled.
“Well, the best way to decide if you want to work in the hospital is to come and observe, do some volunteer work.  Then, if you think you’d like to, you can join the apprentice program.”
“But Draco, I meant what I said before.  I don’t care what anyone else thinks,” Harry said.  “At least come inside and eat with me.”
Harry laughed. “I haven’t thought of it exactly like that.  But, yeah, sort of.  I’m pretty sure Kreacher hates me and the portrait of Walburga Black must constantly be covered or she yells at me.”
“Oh, that’s right. You don’t remember, but you tried to take advantage of my drunken state at that second wand party.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “I suppose it could be worse.  There really could be a girl in Potions you like.” For a second, he looked uncertain. “There isn’t, is there?”
“Nothing really,” she shrugged.  “He’s just . . . we dated for a while.  He’s a bit whingy is all.  Darn it.  I wish I’d grabbed something to drink before we came in here.”
“And those things you told me about aren’t necessarily common knowledge.  Stay away from the obvious or well known, like the Tri-Wizard Tournament, if it makes you feel better.”
Nodding, Draco said, “We have. I can’t imagine being in his place.  If something like that happened to you . . .”
Even though Millicent wasn’t the prettiest girl and she certainly wasn’t small, Justin was disappointed with the way the evening had progressed.  He had been looking forward to it and hoped it would help him in breaking the ice with the ladies.  He knew he was regarded as somewhat geeky, but he just needed someone to give him a chance.
Harry looked at Leo snuggled in Dean’s arms.  “I suppose I wouldn’t be upset if it happened sooner rather than later.  It’s not as if I’m going to go looking for it though.”
Harry reached his hand down and eased Draco out of him.  He turned in place and gripped the erection purposefully. Draco rolled onto his back and closed his eyes.  He came within a few minutes with a gasp and a curl of his toes.
“We’re going to move him to a recovery room after he gets cleaned up.  I’ll have a mediwitch let you know when you can go in two at a time.”
Harper shrugged.  “I was going to work at my family’s vineyard in Wales for a while.  But what I really want to do is open a salon.  A classy, upscale salon, not like the places in Diagon Alley.  I was even thinking about going to a muggle school for cosmetology.”
“I tried everything, Draco.  I changed her nappies, changed her outfits, gave her bottles, put her in the swing . . . nothing worked.  She just cried.”
Of course, there was the bit about Knox’s criticism of the way Draco dealt with Casper in Potions.  Again, Harry couldn’t actually find fault in that.  He sighed.  Well, there were worse people McGonagall could have chosen.
That thought gave Harry pause.  He’d never been one to do the chasing.  The choosing, yes.  But not chasing.
“Okay,” Harry nodded, feeling as though he ruined Christmas before it barely began. “But I never had sex with Hermione.”
Harry approached Draco’s door and turned the knob.  He had gotten used to letting himself in over the past month or so, as long as no one was watching.  But Draco’s door was locked.
Pansy shot Harry a look after he asked his question.  He guessed she hadn’t mentioned the game’s true influence to Tracey.
are.  You aren’t the slut of Slytherin.  You’ve hooked up with the ultimate good guy. By the way, I told you you’d end up with a man.”
With renewed fervor, Draco stripped the clothing from Harry’s body faster and nudged him backward through the door to Harry’s bed.  Harry fell back, clad in only his violet colored pants. As Draco rid himself of the rest of his own clothes, he admired Harry’s fit form, including the impressive outline of his erection.
“Well, I won’t ask you to glamorize me, Harry,” Hermione said.  “You can keep in all of my imperfections.”
They sat in silence contemplating the days following the Battle of Hogwarts.  The server brought their soup and asked if they needed refills on butter beer.  They declined and switched to lemonade.
Draco put his hands on his hips.  He didn’t want to get drawn into one of Pansy’s philosophical debates.  She had a way of turning the tables and getting away from the original point. But he got sucked into defending himself anyway.
Harry glanced at Draco. “I don’t know.  Maybe never. At this point I don’t know if I’m cut out for it.”
She smiled.  He was partly right.  Though she knew she wasn’t as winsome as he was making her out to be. “And is it the same with you?  You don’t normally go around wanking in public?”  He blushed again. “I’m teasing.  Actually, you’re not that different than you were at the dance.  Maybe not as confident.”
“I like it a little messy. Makes me feel not so bad about the mop on top of my head.” He winked. “Shall I bring you dinner?”
She grinned back.  “Why Harry, I didn’t know you were the sort.  You Gryfs come off as so morally superior.”
“Oh, we’ll have ours in the summer,” Harry smiled. He lowered his hand to Draco’s arse as the two couples stood facing each other.  “So we’ll have to make tonight count.”
Draco sighed.  “It doesn’t matter what we all think.  Harry’s gone and I don’t know where.”  He paused.  “He told me to pack my things.  I think he’s having me sacked.”
The commotion subsided, and the thumping ceased.  Parvati and Michael both blushed furiously, but neither saw, as they were both too embarrassed to look at the other.  Michael was fervently praying Parvati wouldn’t notice the rather obvious bulge in his trousers.  He needn’t have worried, she was too busy trying to cross her arms over her overly excited nipples.  After several minutes of quiet, Parvati finally spoke.
“You weren’t ready for it, Terry.  I bet you could beat the shit out of Malfoy in a fair fight.” Someone said.
Joseph Albright was successfully retrieved from the painting after a several hours, and received quite a scolding for it from the original inhabitants.  Draco found out that several student had been playing a game of hide and seek in the castle.  Joseph panicked when he was about to be caught and in a desperate attempt to cast a disillusionment spell on himself, he accidently banished himself into the painting.
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it, but he called out to Draco to stop him. He really didn’t want to work closely on a project with Ginny, thinking it would be awkward for both of them.
Harry pulled himself together enough to get up and walk to Draco. By the time Draco had stopped coughing, Harry was standing in front of him, his face tear-stained. He looked the injured man in the eye.
Draco opened his eyes. Eyes that, at one time, Harry thought were cold and steely. Now they appeared frightened and full of regret.
Feeling dejected, Draco went back to his own quarters.  Breakfast was still being served, but he wasn’t hungry.  And he didn’t want to face any of the other professors in case they’d heard about Knox and Harry’s encounter in the library.  He especially didn’t want to see Madame Pince.  He vaguely recalled telling her to fuck off.
“It was.  It is.  Except, now I feel foolish giving it to you after this elegant evening you planned.”
Pulling Harry closer, Draco said dreamily, “It will be perfect.  Just you and me traveling the world, going to all the places I thought would have been terribly romantic if only I’d had someone special at the time. And new places too. I’ve never been to America.  Have you?”
Hesitating, but unable to control the Auror in him, Harry had to ask, “Draco, has there been an investigation into the accident?”
“Let’s stay in,” he said quietly. “But I don’t think I’ll be needing pajamas. It’s only Friday and we’ve got days on end.”
“Okay, is it so terrible that I might want some attention too?  You try growing up with six other siblings.”
“Why, Harry, how lovely to see you.  Come in.”  Professor McGonagall stepped aside to allow Harry entrance.  “Is there something I can do for you?”
“I suppose technically it was the Harpies versus Bats Quidditch match.  And then we went to the Leaky.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed enthusiastically, forgetting himself as he watched the players flying around the pitch.
The Potions professor leaned down to speak in Penelope’s ear.  “Let him down gently, yeah?  You have no idea how long it’s taken him to gather the nerve.”
“Sort of like those muggle necklaces that are heart shaped, and each person wears half of the heart?” Harry guessed.
“You only won over the entire Weasley clan with your charm. Not to mention keeping your father in check.”
The only bright spot was that his parents were saying their farewells.  He wouldn’t have minded his mother staying, but it was best that his father left before he was able to embarrass Draco.  Lucius was more cordial than Draco thought he could be, and Narcissa graciously accepted the package of homemade crumpets Molly handed her.  The younger Malfoy wondered if it would make it into their kitchen before it was tossed.
Harry smiled. “I know.  And it’s okay.  I want it to be right for both of us.  Let’s just eat breakfast and get through the day. I’ll talk to McGonagall later to tell her what happened, in case someone from the Prophet tries to get a story out of her.”
He decided he would wrap Colin’s wand in a cloth and put it in his trunk, rather than return it to McGonagall.  For some reason, Harry felt he would be abandoning the wand, and indirectly, Colin, if he did.
“Oh, um . . .” Draco hesitated.  “My mother and I had a nice talk.  She explained some things about my father. I feel I have a better picture of who he was when I was a child.”
“It’s not a big deal.  Just something I thought you could use.  Open it.” Draco made himself comfortable as he watched Harry.  Leaning on one elbow, he lay on his side and stretched out his legs.
“Oh, Dra, you’ll get yourself into so much trouble if you do. Especially after McGonagall already told you no,” Pansy worried.
“Yeah, thanks a lot, mate,” Ron pushed Harry’s shoulder playfully.  “By the way, I’m kicking you out of the room tonight again for that.”
He dimmed the lighting, stepped into the tub and held his hand out for Harry.  They settled into a corner as the water rose around them.
“It’s about supper time now. Let’s go for a pint or two.  I haven’t been to the Leaky Cauldron in ages.”
“Can you imagine how powerful he’d be in bed?” Pansy sighed.  “I’ve never experienced it myself, but I’ve heard that the most powerful wizards give off magic during sex and it makes orgasms last minutes, instead of seconds.”
“Oh, Harry, I love you so much.”  Draco hugged Harry tightly.  “Make love to me again,” he whispered.
Arthur took a few a pancakes from a large platter and began to pass it around. There was homemade lemon curd and raspberry jam to spread, along with rich and creamy Devonshire cream. Soon, dishes of bangers, bacon, potato hash and eggs were passed from one end of the table to the other.
Pansy waved to Neville as he walked by her. He blushed and gave a quick wave back, then walked away as fast as possible.
Anthony watched, with Ernie and Justin, just on the fringes of the dance party.  The three of them planned their costumes together and stood looking rather silly as three Merlins.  They had decided to be famous wizards, but all of them wanted to be the most famous wizard. And since none would give in to the others, they all showed up as the same thing.
Later that evening, Harry and Draco sat on the sofa in the Gryffindor common room, an open book between them.  Harry’s left hand rubbed lazy circles on Draco’s thigh as they studied their Herbology lesson.  Over the course of the evening, Harry let his head lean slowly down on Draco’s shoulder.
“Yes.  Mostly in western Europe. I was a child when I went to many of those countries, and I scarcely remember them.  I’m looking forward to this trip.”
Hermione and Harry walked to three more shops before deciding it was time to stop for a bite to eat.  They settled into a corner booth in the Leaky Cauldron and began to get unbundled as the fireplace kept the tavern warm and toasty.
Harry sat watching Draco for a little while, thinking he would say something else. When he didn’t, Harry closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep at the other end of the couch.  The Slytherin couches weren’t as comfortable as the Gryffindor ones. And Harry couldn’t stop thinking about what Draco said.  Did he really want to be friends with Harry?  Harry certainly didn’t think they were enemies anymore.  It was a bit like deja vu, like the first time they met.  Harry had turned down Draco’s offer of friendship back then, with good reason.  But now, things had changed so much.  Malfoy had changed.  Harry thought it probably took a lot for Draco to even bring it up.  And it looked like Harry went and shot him down again.  Harry decided to bring it up tomorrow, if Malfoy was still speaking to him, that is.
He broke the kiss and leaned back to look at her.  “Is this okay?  I mean, do you mind me kissing you?  You chose my wand. You get to say what we do.”
They left the Tower together.  Harry with his blanket, basket and newly acquired journal set, and Draco with his unopened bottle of wine.  He was secretly glad that their evening was alcohol free, for a change.
“What?” Draco looked hurt and confused.  “But I was sure . . .”  He gave Blaise a sideways glance.  He did not want to say too much in front of him.  Draco pushed his plate away and stood.  “You’re such a slag!” he yelled at her and stormed out of the hall.
They stood gazing at one another for a moment, uncertain how to end the night.  Casper looked around self-consciously.
Determined, Harry went to his room to change out of his robes into jeans and a warm jumper.  He toyed with the thought of using a warming charm, then decided it would be better to get chilled so they could warm each other up.  It felt like forever since Harry had seen any real action.  In reality, it had been less than two weeks.  He was anxious to get up to Draco’s room to fetch him.
He led them to the counter and looked Draco over, tapping a leathery finger on his bottom lip. “Hmm.”
She reached out and stroked the side of Draco’s face.  “It’s so easy to believe that when you’re young.  And you’re
“You gave away the respect, Father.  And in regards to wealth, there is plenty left.  I haven’t touched any of it.  You, of all people, can find a way to acquire more.”
“Not as husbands.  Not here in my room, where I’ve . . . always hoped you’d find your way into.  I want this to last forever.”
In my heart, I know that what Harry and I have is real.  But I can’t take a chance that it’s not. Maybe it’s the Slytherin in me,” Draco took her hands in his.  “I’m happy for the first time I can remember.  Please don’t take it away from me.”
“No, sir.” Harry cringed at being called boy. Though quite a bit younger than the wand maker, he was, after all twenty-three and had his own office in the Aurors Department.
“Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m gay,” snickered Harry.  “Come on, we’d better get back.  Draco is probably ready to throttle me for being gone so long.”
“So it’s not just me?” Draco laughed.  “All the kids want to learn about is potions to help them with their costumes.  Whose idea was it anyway to have a costume party?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him into the private bathroom.  Without letting Harry go, he turned on the water.
Draco was relieved when Knox’s family moved to America, and his great grandmother passed away.  He attended the funeral with a fair amount of guilt, thinking he wished her dead.  Childhood fears are often unreasonable and difficult to outgrow.
“Oh, fuck, what time is it?” Draco suddenly got up.  He rooted through his trouser pockets for his watch.  “I was supposed to help Blaise with something for his essay.  He’s going to fucking kill me.”
Healer Cummins sat at his desk, leafing through his notes, scowling.  He picked up a file of parchment and looked at it once more.  Harry felt the Healer had already looked through all the notes and test results so many times, he should have had them memorized.
Harry shrugged as if he didn’t recall. “Nothing too personal,” he lied.  “Besides we didn’t stay up very late anyway.  He got mad at me for something and went to sleep before two.”
Neither of them suspected what would happen when they walked through the threshold of the Great Hall.
“What?  Oh, I was just realizing that this is the first time we’ve come here without evil looming over our lives.”
“Mione, remember the dream I told you about?  The one with Blaise and Draco talking like they were setting me up?”
Draco put his arms around Harry’s neck. “I’m not upset. I enjoy hearing your stories.  That’s why I’ve encouraged you to write it.”
“I can’t believe it’s almost over,” Hermione cried as she looked about the Gryffindor common room.  “This has been our second home for so long, I don’t know if I can bear to leave it.”
Giving no other warning, Harry let out a cry just before a small puddle of cum appeared on his belly.  A puddle that was added to several times.
Draco’s eyes widened.  He liked the naughty side of the former Gryffindor goody-goody.  Glancing at his mantle clock, Draco yawned.  It was past one in the morning.
At ten minutes after eight in the morning, Hermione emerged from the Eighth Year Slytherin girl’s dormitory.  She looked more like she was ready to go for a night on the town than just waking up.  True to her word, Daphne had made up Hermione in her own image.  Hermione’s hair was swept up with smooth, cascading curls down her back.  She also wore make-up, which normally she did not.  Daphne had put perhaps a bit too much on, but Hermione felt feminine and pretty.  And she still looked lovely even after sleeping in it a few hours.  She and Daphne talked a good part of the night away.  Neither really knew much about the other, but they ended up gossiping mostly about the boys.  Hermione hadn’t much opportunity to do that, her two best friends being boys themselves.  And Ginny was so obsessed with Harry from a young age that she didn’t ever want to talk about any other boys.
“Come out with the news about your new young lady.  I do hope you’ll come to me rather than that vulgar Rita Skeeter.”
Harry slapped his bare bum.  “Don’t make fun.  I really do like the color pink,” he laughed.  “And you forgot to mention the part that I adore getting hummers from the sexiest mouth in Slytherin.  That would be you, in case you weren’t sure.”
For two days, Draco had been waiting to talk to Harry.  They were the longest two days of his life. The Gryffindor seemed to be nowhere.  He was never in his room, never in the Great Hall for meals.  At least, not that Draco could see when he peeked inside. If he was in the castle at all, he was doing an excellent job of evading Draco at every turn.  At Sunday’s supper, he finally got up the nerve to sit down with the rest of the professors, especially McGonagall, whom he had been avoiding.
. Draco knew it was wrong to keep the spells on the cauldron.  That wasn’t even the question. The question was whether or not he could live with that decision for the rest of his life.  And what if, eventually, the magic faded.  He, Pansy and Blaise didn’t really study the magic enough to know if it was permanent.  But more than that, Draco didn’t think he’d be able to live with a huge lie hanging over their happiness like a dark cloud threatening to burst at any moment.
“It’s been far too long, Harry,” Hermione said as she sat down at a table across from him and Ron. “We didn’t even go out for your birthday.”
“I’m sorry.  That had to have been the fastest honeymoon fuck in history.” He slipped out of Harry and turned him around. Harry’s cock was still hard and throbbing.  “I’ll take care of that for you.”
“Merlin’s beard, you fucked him, didn’t you?” Blaise laughed.  “Going to make your way through Gryffindor this year, Pans?”
“Oh.  So this isn’t quite the accident it seems,” Cummins brought his hand to his chin and rubbed it thoughtfully.  “I just assumed . . . well, I didn’t realize you were
Lucius whispered to his son, “I never thought I’d be happy that you took Potter’s name. Do you think he’d be willing to testify?”
Feeling his cock stir at Harry’s confession, Draco leaned forward and captured Harry’s mouth with his own.  “Anything you want,” he breathed, and resumed unbuttoning Harry’s shirt.
Harry sat on a blanket watching Draco play a game of fanged frisbee with a group of Slytherins.  The Potions professor had a smile on his face as he tucked his long fringe behind his ears.  Harry briefly wondered if Draco was planning to grow out his hair like his father’s once more.  He couldn’t complain either way.  The man was handsome no matter how he wore his hair.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed.  “See you tomorrow night.”  He was still a bit featherbrained from the snog session as he walked away.
“Can I give you a bit of advice, mate?” Ron asked, but didn’t wait for Harry’s reply.  “I think you need to decide if you’re really committed to Malfoy, or if you want to play the field still.”
“All the hand touching, silly smiling, watching me when you think I don’t notice . . . you’re not even going to
Draco glanced at the door.  No sign of Blaise.  “Yeah, all right.  You’re not bad at potions, right?”
“I’m only teasing,” Harry smiled.  “Here.”  He handed Draco a small package wrapped in plain brown paper.  “It’s from Molly.”
“As much as I could, anyway,” Draco laughed.  “Merlin, you could knock up three girls at once with that amount of cum.”
Draco raised an eyebrow.  “Really?  You never told me about that.  Hmm.  At least that was a good one that came true.”
Draco reached over to the side table and picked up the small bottle.  Instead of handing it to Harry, he opened it and poured some on his hand.  He took Harry’s cock in his hand and coated it generously.  He swiped the excess on his own arse, poking a finger inside.
Before Harry could answer, Draco appeared in the passageway, coming to a dead stop when he spotted Harry.
As soon as Ron and Hermione were out of earshot, Harry said, “Merlin, I thought that lunch would never end.”
“Blaise, would you mind terribly switching partners in Potions?” Draco gathered up the courage to ask.
As they fell asleep in each others’ arms, another person lay in his bed alone.  The entire castle may not have heard Draco’s cries of passion, but Knox did, from his room next door.
“Then I had to go to Gringott’s.  For this.”  Harry held up a gold ring with a small ruby set in the middle of a simple carved design.  “It has been in my father’s family for a few generations. I know it’s Gryffindor colors, but I could spell the stone green if you prefer.”
She looked into his pleading eyes and sighed heavily.  “All right, I’ll only tell Tracey.  And I’ll make her promise not to say anything.  Are you always such a goody-goody?”
“You know how muggles can be,” Molly smiled.  “Oh, look,” she said, peering over Dean’s shoulder.  “There they are.”
“Will you marry me?” he exclaimed.  “Blimey, Ron, you didn’t tell me you were going to ask Mione to marry you!”
“That’s why I don’t like all the prophesying and palm reading and all that crap.  It’s rubbish.  So she saw some kids that I’ve been dreaming about.  I still say they’re Ron and Hermione’s.  If I ever do have a family, I can’t imagine now how that will happen.  So I choose not to think about it.  It will be, or not.”
“Technically, if his conviction is overturned, the search and seizure the Aurors performed on the manor would be illegal.  He could claim back anything taken at the time,” Harry said.  Being a former Auror, he knew what was at stake if Lucius Malfoy were to get his way.  “Including dark items.”
“She just seems . . . down.  Like there’s something on her mind.  And whatever it is, Gin’s not telling me about it.”
Although she was trying to be supportive, Hermione wasn’t sure how she felt about the image that just popped into her mind.  Logically, she realized that if they liked each other, they would kiss.  And if it turned to more, they would . . .
Allowing a sad smile, Draco said, “You shouldn’t have to choose. I shouldn’t have been so pig-headed.  And now I feel foolish for wanting a family so badly I can feel it . . .” He put a hand to his chest.
When they apparated back home, Harry wondered if Draco didn’t want him to go back in the house because he didn’t want anyone to tell him about Draco reading to the children.  The more he thought about it, the more certain he became that was the case. He chose not to let on that he saw but would treasure the memory for himself.
“No, I’m just trying to be realistic.”  Hermione could tell he was becoming disheartened by the conversation.
Harry put his spoon down.  “Hermione, you know you can say anything to me, right?  Or ask me what you want to know?”
Draco could see it coming, standing there in the library watching them.  He was powerless to stop it.  He was frozen in place, as well as if someone had placed a body bind curse on him.
“I heard the flu is going ‘round Ravenclaw,” Ron chimed in. “The sick ones aren’t allowed out of their dormitories.”
“I know.  That’s why there are only rumors about you.  Ginny didn’t kiss and tell.  Are you not going to brag about what we did?”  Daphne was confused.  Whenever a boy would get anywhere beyond a kiss with her, the news spread like wildfire.  Most of them would tell whoever would listen.
“Draco has offered to teach us how to dance for our wedding.  He’s quite good,” Hermione said, looking at Ron from her upside down position.
“We have to call him Draco?” Ron sneered.  “He’s never called me anything but Weasley or Weasel.  Well, and a few other choice words.”
“Uh, there may have been something about the Weasley wedding mentioned in the note,” Cornfoot told him.  “And we made it sound like the letter was from someone in the Ministry.  One of those pureblood advocates.”
“It’s all right,” Draco said.  “I don’t mean to be so unenthusiastic.  There are just so many things I plan to do before I settle down.”
“Try holding her more upright,” Draco suggested, recalling a time Harry was able to calm Rose that way.
Draco laughed.  “The three students who have been staying after for extra practice and studying.  I’ve taken to calling them my Tri-Miones.”
“I do that occasionally.  When she doesn’t figure things out first,” Harry smiled.  His smile soon faded.  “Ron, there are a couple of other things I need to tell you.  Things I don’t intend to tell Hermione at all.”
“Lucius.” Arthur smiled politely.  “Would you like to have a seat at the head of the table?” he asked graciously.
When five minutes had passed, Draco realized that Harry wasn’t coming back.  He flopped down onto the settee and began mentally berating himself.
“Oh, I see you’re reading The Life and Times of Alfred Woolvington,” Hermione grinned.  “How do you like it so far?”
“Ah, Harry Potter,” Ollivander said as he made his way to the pair. “You didn’t lose another wand did you, my boy?”
“There are so many of them.  I didn’t realize how bad the book was.  Why weren’t you honest with me in the first place?”
Seamus took her innocent act as just that, an act.  “Why?  There are plenty of places we can go to be alone inside the castle.”
“You deserve someone truly trustworthy.  Someone who won’t turn on you for every perceived indiscretion.”
“With your hair combed over like that, it’s not that noticeable,” Lavender offered.  “At least everyone knows you’re not a lesbian,” she said sympathetically.
“Well, you’re going to say that those so-called witnesses have all since admitted to lying,” Harry ordered.
They sat on a large windowsill facing one another. The pair removed their facial disguises and regarded one another.
“Perhaps I’d better leave it to the new professor to decide how to organize this mess,” he said to himself out loud. He knew it was a cop out, but he justified it nonetheless.
“Maybe he just needed to cool off,” Ron suggested.  “You had a row, right?  Give him some time to get over it.  I’m sure he’ll be back.  I can’t see him leaving Hogwarts.  He loves it there.”
“Oh, um,” Draco tried to back pedal.  “I didn’t mean . . . it was just a . . . silly thought.  I’m just so happy here with you,” he stammered.
Ron frowned, “Didn’t you invite him here?”  He thought after suggesting to Ginny that she invite him, that she would.
Feeling slightly insulted, Harry proceeded to re-button his own shirt.  “Forgive me for finding you irresistible,” he said mockingly.  “I’ll try to control myself.”
“No it isn’t,” he assured her.  “But what is ridiculous, is to think you have to find that right now, here, at Hogwarts. You’re young, you’re pretty and smart when you want to be.  Stop giving yourself away, especially to this lot.  Including me.”
“Wait,” Harry said.  “I have a better idea.”  He took out his wand and conjured up the green sofa from the common room.
“Is that how you feel when you’re with him?” Hermione asked, knowing that not only Harry, but Ron as well, was becoming extremely ill-at-ease with the conversation.
The events of the past twelve hours ran over and over in Harry’s mind like a film.  He wished he could turn it off.  It was a welcome relief when the witch behind the desk called his name an hour later.
“Hardly,” Harry said.  “Draco’s father has served seven years of his sentence already.  And the Malfoy family helped me in the end.”
“I wonder what he’s going to say tomorrow,” Hermione mused.  “Any idea what name Malfoy is going to give, Ron?”
Harry reached out his hand to take Draco’s but restrained himself.  “I am so sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you. I asked you over and over to trust me and I betrayed that trust.”
“No.  I mean, sort of.  It wouldn’t have been a real life.  And I don’t think she would have grown.  It may have been even worse than her death.”
Harry leaned over and licked her left breast, the nipple hard against his tongue.  He sucked, eliciting a deep moan from Pansy. He reached up under her skirt and tugged her knickers down, then hiked the skirt up, getting a full view of her.
Raising his eyebrows in surprise, Harry questioned, “You haven’t? I didn’t know there was any question.” Harry saw the opportunity to bring up Hermione’s suggestion about their living situation.  “You know, we could find a place of our own.  It would be somewhere we could start fresh, with no painful memories.  As much as I loved Sirius, his house feels . . .”
Using a wandless spell, he loosened the rings surrounding his and Draco’s cock and bollocks. Draco immediately cried out, shooting his load hard into the air. Harry joined him, buried deep inside his husband.
“I’ll be right back.” Draco kissed Harry and raced out of the room, as if he thought Harry would change his mind if he took too long.
Hermione’s eyebrows shot up and her mouth dropped.  “What did you do?  I mean, what do you say to something like that?”
Draco sighed, feeling somewhat sappy for his sentimentality.  But he was smitten, completely and utterly under Harry’s spell.  He didn’t even care if he looked a fool, because Harry was with him, letting him hold him, kiss him and fuck him senseless.  Harry was in love with him too.
An uncontrollable and uncharacteristic grin crossed Draco’s slightly swollen lips.  He sighed with relief.  “Good.  Because I really like you too.  But why didn’t you ever tell me you’re queer?”
If Harry was being honest with himself, Draco had been becoming more than a friend.  If he was being honest with himself, he really had fallen a little bit in love with Draco.  Perhaps, more than a little bit.
“I didn’t tell her anything,” the Malfoy heir said.  “It’s none of her business.  Harry, this isn’t just a phase.”
Draco returned to his increasingly favorite chair with a cup of tea and a small plate of biscuits.  He had just taken a bite of a chocolate one when a young blonde girl appeared in front of him.  She stared at him with her hands behind her back.
Harry was glad that Knox had gone with friends to Hogsmeade for most of the day.  At least he and Draco spent it together, playing chess, flying and reading.
“What?  You want to invite other Houses?  Are you mental?” Blaise suggested.  “We can’t have outsiders in our House.  It simply isn’t done.  Besides, you think any of those do-gooders from Gryffindork would possibly be interested?” he laughed.
Harry took a moment to think.  Skeeter was hoping to fluster him, no doubt, and to make him look like a hypocrite.  Perhaps she was hoping he would try to backpedal his way out of it and appear foolish.  Instead, he gave Rita what she never would have expected, being incapable herself.  He humbled himself and told the truth.
Harry sighed, relieved that there was no longer any question of the paternity of Ginny’s baby.  He would have to wait to find out about his own children, the same as anyone else.
Eighth Years.  There were never Eighth Years at Hogwarts before.  The war had changed many things indeed.  Hogwarts--the entire wizarding community-- would never be the same.  September had rolled around, and as usual, students boarded the Hogwarts express from the station.  The first years sat in compartments with students wearing equally nervous expressions.  The older students, though seasoned, were still a bit apprehensive about returning.  Some of them had been there to see the destruction of their beloved school first-hand.  Some had merely read about it or heard about it as they listened in on conversations behind closed doors.
“You never met Dudley.  He was a big bully when we were children,” Harry told him.  He turned to Ron.  “He’s a bit more humbled these days.  He laughed and told me he always thought I was queer.  But it was more teasing than mean spirited.  I don’t know if we’ll ever be real friends, but I feel like we can be family.”
“Why don’t you come out!” Harry shouted.  “Or are you too much of a coward to let me see who threw that trip jinx?”
“I don’t think so,” Hermione insisted. “I saw them together recently. They were having lunch in one of the local muggle pubs.”
Glancing around the common room, Draco agreed.  There were three other students in the Gryffindor dormitory, plus the floor wasn’t the most comfortable place for sex.
“Okay.” Harry leaned up to kiss him.  “I just want to tell everyone.  But I want to tell them first.”
“What?  If you can’t tell me, who can ya tell?  I’m picking wildflowers for Merlin’s sake. How can I judge?”
“Ron . . .”  Harry didn’t know how to tell Ron that his feelings for Ginny were gone, beyond the friendship.
“Whatever you might think of me personally, I can help you.  The longer you reject the offer the Ministry has made, the more danger Narcissa is in.  Right now, she is practically a prisoner in her own home.  And despite your distaste for Draco’s lifestyle, I know you love him.  You have the power to keep them safe.  Give the Ministry the names of the Death Eaters, and you can be free in a matter of days.”
When she stirred, he knew precisely how to pat her to get her back to sleep. Hermione returned to take her back, but Draco insisted she let the baby sleep.  He sat for an uncomfortably long time, having to use the loo himself before handing Rose over to Molly.
Harry looked down at Draco, who had already fallen asleep.  His knee was feeling a bit better, so he made his way to the loo to get ready for bed.  Although he wanted Draco to stay, he wished the blond hadn’t had too much to drink.  Harry noticed that Pansy kept filling his glass with firewhiskey and he lost track of how much he had drunk.
“I knew there had to be some other explanation,” Harry told Draco.  “There was no point in telling you.”
Too many beers sent Draco to the loo in the middle of supper, leaving Harry contemplating the evening on his own.  He could scarcely believe how well they were getting on.  He wished that some of his proper dates had gone so well.
“I’m beginning to think Draco is right.  Not every couple has to have children.  No one has ever raised them in Hogwarts.  There would be no other children to play with. And Draco plans to open an apothecary someday.  We’ll be too busy.”
“Better than all right,” Harry answered.  “That was . . .” He searched for a word to describe the feeling.
“Draco’s a bit jealous.  He’d never admit it, but he is.  And it turns out Knox is distantly related to him.”
Draco dropped the cane in order to run both hands through Harry’s thick, dark hair. Harry reciprocated, appropriately fondling the silky locks this time. Without the dust from the crumbling Manor, it was even softer.
Harry grinned, watching his lover’s head fall back as he came with a rather loud moan. Draco jerked his head up and gasped, forgetting for a moment that no one could hear them.  He blushed, on top of the flush that accompanied his climax.
Monday morning, Harry and Draco sat at breakfast with McGonagall and most of the rest of the professors.
“Well, I was correct.  Potions is where your talent lies.  One of them, anyway.” She winked at him.  “I see a career making Potions for you.  Perhaps an apothecary shop of your own.
“I don’t deserve your trust anymore.  Probably not your forgiveness either.  But I’m going to do everything I can to earn it.  I need to prove to you that I’m committed, to only you.”
“No,” he laughed.  “I just realized that we’ll be able shag anytime we want without having to kick my roommates out when we’re married.”
“I’ve decided to fuck you in the shower.  Come on,” Draco ordered, taking Harry by the hand.  “We’ve still got thirteen minutes of Valentine’s Day to celebrate.”
Harry shook his head.  “I considered it.  But I’ve applied for an apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s instead.”
“I wanted to get her some sort of jewelry, but now that I’m here, I’m not sure what to get.”  Ron was looking at some books at that point.
“Really mate?” Ron raised his eyebrows at Harry’s ridiculous suggestion.  “You’re the fucking Chosen One.  What bird in her right mind wouldn’t want to go out with you?” He shook his head in disbelief. “You’re too modest for your own good. You could get anyone you wanted.”
Draco quickly proceeded to do the same to Harry as he stepped on the heels of his shoes to remove them. Harry helped with the unbuttoning while Draco concentrated on the blue jeans.
He scratched the back of his neck. “I wanted to ask if it was all right with you two if I write about you.”
.  It stayed.  Harry had to admit that they were dates.  At least now, he knew how the journal worked.  He continued.
Draco’s fingernails dug into Harry’s shoulders as they slowly began to move. Holding his breath through most of it, Draco whimpered with every thrust. He had to consciously remind himself to breathe.
“Ahem,” Hermione cleared her throat, reminding the lovers that they were not alone. Ron rubbed his neck uneasily and looked everywhere but at his friend and his new love.
“It’s me.  I just . . . I don’t know,” he stammered.  He truly didn’t know why his interest in Ginny had waned.  He had seen Ron and Hermione’s relationship falter without the adventure and excitement that had brought them together in the first place.  He thought perhaps the same thing was happening with him and Ginny.
Harry hesitated.  He knew Neville had voted against hiring Draco.  “I don’t know.  I haven’t really been in touch with many of my mates from school.  No, just the Weasleys.  Shite, I haven’t told Ron and Hermione the date yet, it’s happened so fast.”
“I will,” Harry promised.  “Tomorrow, we’re going to Diagon Alley together.  I’ll tell him everything then.  Regardless of what happens tonight.”
“He’s not happy yet,” Hermione pointed out.  “We don’t know if this person likes him.” She found herself referring to the object of Harry’s affections the same way.
“Well, I do trust you.  With my life, and my heart. I hope . . . you feel that you can trust me again.”
“Oh, yeah,” he sighed, just before a large gob of cum leapt onto his shirt, followed by two smaller ones.  “Mm.”
“Yeah, that was pretty clever, huh?”  Harry said.  “By the time he realized it, he was late for class and I already took his seat.  Sorry about the ten points.”
“All right.  Sounds great,” Blaise said.  “In the meantime, don’t be such a pussy.  Potter’s never going to find a better shag than you,” he winked.
Firmly pushing Draco’s shoulders back, Harry tried to relieve the pressure from Draco’s crushing lips.  He fisted Draco’s hair and gave a light tug, pulling Draco away enough to give himself room to maneuver.  Harry turned them so that Draco’s back was now to the wall, and covering Draco’s mouth fully with his own, he glided his tongue over the blond’s.   Harry slowed down the pace and allowed Draco to thoroughly investigate as he pleased.
“You have one of those? Aren’t your shows live?” Slughorn was always very interested in new magical devises.
They strolled down to the Great Hall and leisurely ate crumpets, scrambled eggs and sausages, with a bit of eggnog.  Harry couldn’t help grinning after every bite.
“I’ve got to go,” said Draco.  “I’d like to get to class before the students.  See you later.”  He gave a genuine smile before he left.
“Relax, Ron.  They’ve probably been politely waiting for us.  I wonder if they came up with something to talk about.”
“Draco and I decided, well, actually, we decided before we left . . . but we talked about it a lot while we were away.”
“I didn’t mean to bind myself to Draco,” Harry told him.  “But now that I have . . . I am ready for the commitment.”
Ron sat down on the arm of the couch and crossed his arms over his chest.  Hermione sat down on a cushion and gazed up expectantly at Harry.
trouble,” Harry said. “It’s not going to be a big party or anything.  And I’ll come right back afterwards.”
“At this point, we’re already going to be late,” Harry said, gently shoving the nude man into the shower.  He turned the water on, accidentally dousing Draco with a shot of cool water.
Harry gave the password and entered his room.  Just one more night, then Draco would be back.  Though they spoke through the floo network most days, it wasn’t the same. And maybe, once he’d seen Harry and Draco together, Knox would stop making subtle comments and gestures designed to engender Harry’s affection.
“You’re an inspiration to us all,” Mel said.  “And this . . . well, to find out that our hero is gay . . . that a hero can be gay, it’s just so vindicating."
Harry leaned close and whispered to Draco, “How are you feeling?  You don’t seem to be walking wonky.”
“I don’t know,” he answered.  “I’m not certain how Mother will react.  She’s always been supportive, and I think she suspects that I’m attracted to men.  But it may still be difficult for her.  I’d better give her the news alone.”
As Draco reached out for it, the wand maker pulled it back. “On second thought, this one.” He nudged the second box.
Draco moaned in pleasure nearly as much as Harry through the climax.  Afterward, Harry lay in post-orgasmic languor, his body tingling right down to his toes.  Gradually, his breathing slowed, and his mind came back into focus.  He opened his eyes to witness Draco stroking himself wildly.  Trousers mid-thigh, bum exposed, Draco was bridged across Harry’s body grunting and panting.
The more Draco thought about it, the more worried he became.  He had to get Harry back to the safety of Hogwarts.
“Well, if it’s okay with Grandmama, we’re going to name her Narcissa.  But we’ll call her Cissy for short.”  Draco looked to his mother.
“Harry, you’re going to give yourself away if you don’t stop staring at Malfoy’s empty seat and moping,” Hermione said softly.
“I guess it was funny,” Ron conceded.  “But only because nothing was going on,” he added, implying that Ron would not find it humorous if he ever did catch them in the act.
Harry gave a sheepish grin but said nothing.  He simply turned around and began walking toward the classroom.
“I can’t wait to have you,” Harry breathed.  He leaned over again and kissed the side of Draco’s neck.  Then he began to nibble on his ear.
“I didn’t want you to make a big deal about it.  It was very casual,” Harry told him, which was true.
“And it would give you somewhat of a distraction while you talk and get to know one another,” Hermione added.
Michael nodded. “It sounded like it was coming from up there.” He pointed toward the stairs leading to the boy’s dormitory.
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” Draco breathed.  “Although, I always thought our positions would be reversed.”
“Then, what are your plans?  Now that you’re no longer planning to shag your way through life,” Blaise asked bitterly.
The feast had begun and Draco listened to Blaise and Pansy talk about their travels over the summer while he ate his chicken and potatoes.  He had little to offer during their conversation.  He had no exciting travels to speak about, just trials and inquiries and trips to healers attempting to remove his Dark Mark.
“I understand that you believe a comfortable life is an easy one.  In some ways mine was.  I can’t say I didn’t enjoy the many toys and fine clothing I received. But if I could have traded my family’s fortune for the love an acceptance that you have in abundance, I would.  Treasures come in all forms, and sometimes we don’t fully realize what we have.  I took money for granted because I had it.  You probably took your family for granted as well.”
Stephen Cornfoot put an arm around Terry Boot’s chest and helped him to his feet.  “I’ve got it,” he hissed.  The other Ravenclaws crossed their arms over their chests.
Draco was prepared to intervene with an excuse.  If he was correct in guessing Theo’s purpose for the visit, Pansy would need one.
Blushing lightly, Harry stood.  “I’ll meet you all out front, I’m going to fix myself.  And no one has me in a tizzy. It’s just a simple mistake.”  Harry strode out of the hall while the others watched and snickered.
“Unfortunately, it seems you were correct in your theory about Harry being attacked,” the professor continued.  “Arthur Weasley owled me yesterday with the details surrounding the incident.”
Just as they were ready to leave, a knock came on the door. Harry answered it, curious as to who would be calling on him.
“Everything,” Harry said.  “I want to know all the little things, like your favorite book, what toys you played with as a child, or your favorite color.”
“I don’t think Seamus and Pansy are going to get much sleep,” Hermione giggled.  “I just hope they remember to put up a silencing charm.”
“We really shouldn’t,” Harry repeated, unzipping his fly and dropping his trousers.  He bent over the arm of the settee.
Harry shuddered at the thought of Draco bending over for him and the image that thought conjured in his head.  He let out a small involuntary moan.
“Have a seat.”  He was practically squirming in his pants.  “You may want to take your shirt off for this.”  He handed her a towel.  “Wrap this around your shoulders.”
“Molly has always been an exceptional cook.” Arthur put his arm around his wife and gave her a squeeze.  “Thank you so much for hosting.  It meant so much for Ron to have his and Hermione’s ceremony with Harry’s. And, um, Draco’s, of course,” he added.
“So, you never did tell me how your date went last weekend.”  After what Harry just said, he wanted to test if it was simply a case of misunderstanding, or if Harry really did think Finbar Quigley was hot.  The latter would prove an interesting twist if true.  There were little things here and there that Harry did or said that made Draco sometimes imagine he could be bent.  But never anything so blatant as calling another man hot.
“I prefer the word sophisticated,” said Harry.  “I like that about you.  I guess opposites really do attract.”
A small gasp escaped Narcissa’s lips.  It was still disconcerting for her to hear the Dark Lord’s name spoken aloud.
“Everlasting candles.”  She pulled Ron’s sleeve and directed him toward the shop.  Harry followed behind, sniggering, glad he didn’t have someone tugging at him and ordering him around.
Within an hour of arriving back to his chambers, Harry received Hermione’s owl informing him that he did indeed have a date planned with Miss Althea Bridgewater for the following Saturday at eight o’clock.  Hermione chose a muggle restaurant called Blue Fish and provided walking directions from the Ministry, since the restaurant was nearby.
“I’m frustrated,” The Slytherin mumbled.  “I thought . . . at the party you were so . . . I thought you wanted me as much as I want you.”  Draco had always kept the upper hand.  He never conveyed desperation to anyone.  But he was desperate to have Harry. He closed his eyes, unable to bear facing his confessor.
As they neared the place where they would part ways to return to their own rooms, Michael took a quick glance around, then pulled Parvati with him.
Pansy did her best to hide her melancholy and asked Hermione a question.  “Granger,” the Slytherin looked pointedly at her, then at Ron.  “Don’t take this the wrong way Weasley, but I’ve always wondered, Granger, why you didn’t go after Harry rather than him.  He’s hardly your equal.” She gestured to Ron, who scowled.
Harry smiled and took the book from Draco’s hand and walked to the sofa.  “Do you want to be on top or bottom?”
“Yes, it can be helpful in illness as well.  And that can be dangerous, because the other will become weaker.  But it can be wonderful as well.  You have a real sense of your partner, as if they are with you even if you’re apart.”  Molly put her hand on Arthur’s.  He looked at her adoringly.  Draco was astounded by the apparent strong affection even after so many years of marriage.  His own parents barely showed more than tolerance for one another.
He noticed the time and forced himself to leave the safety of his quarters for the Great Hall.  Chaperones for the Halloween Dance were supposed to be there before students arrived, but Harry dawdled and ended up walking in after the music began.  Many of the student were already there.
“Draco told me.  His father sent a cryptic message telling Draco that his sentence may be shortened. I  . . .  asked Billings about it.”
After supper, she and Harry went to the library to get books for History of Magic research paper due the following week. As they walked by the alcove next to the entrance, Harry blushed, remembering his tryst with Daphne.
However, his mind kept wandering as he began to relay the events in Malfoy Manor. He became increasingly distracted by ‘what ifs’.  If just one circumstance had been different.  If only all three wands hadn’t been lost.  If only Lucius hadn’t booby trapped the wards.  If only Greyback hadn’t delayed Harry behind a wall of bricks.  If only wandless healing spells had been part of the Auror training.
“There’s a very small window in terms of artificial insemination. We’d like you to come in tomorrow morning.”
“Oh, no!  Left overs would never do for Masters Harry and Draco.  Minke will whip up something new.”
Spreading a thick blanket on the floor near the wall, Harry sat down and began taking items out of the basket.  The house elves prepared a variety of breads and cheeses and pudding and fruits, including the strawberries Harry asked for last minute.  The house elves would have done anything for Harry.  And though, normally he wouldn’t take advantage, he was desperate for this evening to go well.
“That was fun,” Harry sighed.  “I never knew you were so good at Spades.”  He cocked his head. “It’s funny to think that there are still things we don’t know about each other.”
“Oi, Zabini!  Care for some competition?” Draco shouted as he approached his fellow Slytherin, broom in hand.
“There’s nothing to apologize for.  We’ve officially consummated our marriage.” Harry grinned.  “I’m certain round two will last much longer.”
“Do you think I didn’t try that the first time she cried?” Ron threw up his arms. “Hermione was furious with me.”
Harry shook his head emphatically.  “Not at all.  Everybody wanted something from me.  It was like I was everybody’s saviour---okay, poor choice of words.  Maybe I was because of Voldemort, but people wanted more.  I like the life I have at Hogwarts much better. What about you?”
Harry and Draco went separate ways down different corridors. Back in his quarters, Harry got down to grading papers.  He had quite a bit of time to kill before Ron and Hermione were scheduled to arrive.
Shaking his head, Ron said, “Nothing. I suppose if you have something to tell me, you will. Did you get lunch yet?”
“Of course,” she smiled.  “The ballroom looks incredible.  It’s always been impressive, but the decor is perfect.  I especially love the floating balloons.”
“I just didn’t feel like fighting the crowds tonight.  The students are driving me crazy,” he admitted.
While the professors were busy greeting and checking in the students returning on the Hogwarts Express, the Seventh and Eighth Years were relaxing in their common rooms.
Draco had been sitting listening to the conversation, along with Harper.  Harper was an enigma to Draco.  He seemed flamboyantly open and gregarious with many students.  However, he barely ever spoke at mealtimes.  Draco had the feeling he made the boy uncomfortable.
“You’re on your own,” she muttered to Daphne, knowing she couldn’t possibly be heard.  “Wait!” she shouted to Anthony and caught the sleeve of his robe. As he turned to face her, Anthony saw Justin walk by grinning, giving him a thumbs up. Anthony returned the gesture, then went back to frowning.
“I think what Draco means is that he is sorry, but simply saying it won’t make up for it.  And we’ve gotten past all the shit we did to each other over the years.  I hope you can too.”
I hope this letter finds you well.  I have appreciated your correspondence over the years and regret that I have not returned a letter in quite some time.  I have been spending the past four months at Beauxbatons, student teaching Potions classes with Professor Olivier.  This brings me to the reason for my letter.  I have heard that Professor Slughorn has announced his retirement and I would like to be considered for the position.  I realize that, as a former Death Eater, I am not going to be anyone’s first choice.  However, I have worked very hard to turn my life around, as you know.  All I am asking is for a chance to pay forward the debt I incurred during and after the war.  I will not let you down if I am given this opportunity.
“I think I have been for some time now. I thought surely you must have noticed. Every time the Ministry called me in for information in some case or another, I would request to speak with you.” Draco chuckled a bit, causing a coughing fit. He tried not to cough in Harry’s face. Manners to the end, Harry thought. Draco was dying and yet he still was trying to maintain some level of etiquette.
Harry thought about their conversation in his office. He wondered why Draco was being so standoffish. Perhaps he was embarrassed by his confession. Draco was obviously reluctant to believe Harry’s. With good reason, Harry supposed. It was suspect.
Shaking his head, Harry stormed off.  It wasn’t fair.  People would judge them based on what Rita Skeeter wrote, without any substantiating facts.  Even if they didn’t buy into everything she wrote, they would believe that there must be some truth in it.  Even Ron believed that her previous articles about Draco must have had some basis in fact.
“Don’t get me wrong, Harry.  I was being sincere.  I enjoy seeing you happy.  Even if the object of your affections is M-Draco.  Just please tell Ron soon.  I don’t like keeping things from him.  Especially now that we’re becoming closer than ever.”
Professor Slughorn looked over the boys’ potion and gave it a small taste.  “Well done boys,” he pronounced.  “The rest of you keep going.  This potion is still graded,” the professor reminded them all. In the back of the room, Ernie and Mandy’s potion exploded.
“It’s only until I figure out how to come out.  I can’t just make an announcement at supper,” Harry snickered.
“Disappointed that I’m not going to have a baby with someone I don’t love and don’t want to spend my life with? No.”
The following morning, Draco woke up on his sofa with a pounding headache and sour stomach.  An empty bottle of champagne lay a few feet away on the floor.
“Us, of course.  Or at least me.  I may have to ease into us,” Harry admitted.  “I suppose it will depend on their reaction.”
“When a couple’s magic is bound, it’s permanent.  They are joined together forever.  Even if they end up separating.”
Ignoring Harry and still addressing Draco, Hermione continued.  “So, when you said at the pub that night that you’d been in love with him for a long time, you weren’t exaggerating just for drama.  You literally meant that you’ve been in love with him all these years.  Since when?”
“Actually, we don’t.  B is only going to work with dragons because one of his brothers is.  I don’t think that’s what he really wants to do,” Harper began to explain.  “He came home with me a few times and took an interest in the vineyard.” Harper laughed mirthlessly.  “My father was pleased to have a ‘man’ to mentor.  Even though I had been working summers for several years.  Anyway, Dad taught him about different kinds of wine.  B was such a quick study, Dad offered him a job.”
“Well, the spell is gone.  But, Parvati, right now you could say just about anything and get that same result.” Michael was getting turned on by the innuendo.  And the pressure of her weight on top of him.
“You’re already reconsidering your feelings, aren’t you?” Draco grumbled. “You’re trying to analyze them, question them.  This is why I didn’t tell you until after the game was over.  I didn’t want that knowledge to influence you.”
Between the second and third course of dinner, the newly married couples mingled with guests.  Harry was thrilled to see Hagrid there.  He dearly missed him during the past school year.  They spent a great deal of time catching up while Draco made the rounds with the other pureblood families.
“I must sound fickle.”  Draco pulled back from Harry. “When you told me that you came around to my way of thinking, I was having doubts about my own convictions. But I figured if you were having second thoughts about a family, perhaps it was fate.  I pushed my doubts aside, because I thought it was what you wanted.”
The three carried on conversation for a few more minutes before Harry realized that he was free the following night.  Though he was hoping for a Saturday night out with his coworker, he would gladly settle for time with his best friends.
“I don’t understand?  It’s not exactly easy for me either.  My father would disown me if he knew.  He expects me to marry one of the Greengrass girls when I leave here.  Or some other pureblood bitch.”  Draco sighed and removed his hand from Harry’s pants.  The moment seemed to be gone.  “If you’re still unsure, maybe we ought to cool things for a while.”
Harry took hold of Draco’s hand.  Before either of them could say more, students began to pouring out of the Great Hall.
“All right. I’ll go to Thorpe Park with you. If you say you’ll let me take you to Venice.  It’s not as though we won’t have time this summer.”
“And the Church of England,” the minister interrupted.  “We now pronounce you husband and wife.  And, husband and husband.”
But since it did come apart when Draco picked it up, he had to ask the question.  He had to know if it was true. Harry had just opened his heart and sat, more vulnerable than ever, waiting for Draco’s response.
“I was thinking about our first meeting when I came to teach here. I remembered being surprised that you were so personable with me.  We actually carried on a normal conversation for the first time.”
Harry laughed.  “Since when did that ever stop you?  But I don’t suppose you want to hear any sordid details about my love life, now that it involves Draco.”  He took a sip of butter beer.
“I didn’t realize how hungry I was until smelled the food,” Harry laughed as he sat down with his tray.  “Oh, I just realized that Draco probably didn’t get a chance to eat either.  I should get him something and bring it to him.”
“Not what I expected,” Anthony answered.  “At first she sort of ordered me around.  But when I was nice to her, she was nice back.  And the next thing I knew, she was asking me to shag her.”
Over the summer, the Potions room had been cleaned as was every other room in the castle.  However, house elves were notorious for doing only what was minimally required.  Anything left on the desks or the floor remained.  And the cupboard that housed the ingredients was disorderly.  Looking inside, Harry scratched his head wondering where to begin.
“Then that’s it.  We’ll be acquaintances and colleagues, but nothing more.  No more knocking on my door late at night, no more Quidditch practice, no more pub lunches.”
“I’m sorry, Mother.  But it’s Valentine’s Day and I want to spend what’s left of the evening with Harry.  The two of you have some celebrating of your own to do,” Draco smirked.
Frowning, Harry confessed to Hermione.  “I wasn’t very nice to him the other day.  You know, the day I skipped class. I guess he’s still upset.”
“I’m so sorry I put you in a position to have to be responsible for me like that.  It was very unprofessional of me to get so pissed,” said Harry.
Draco groaned.  Wherever Ron and Hermione’s ten-year-old went, trouble usually followed.  And when he was accompanied by thirteen-year-old Teddy Lupin, it was sure to follow.
“Some of it, yes.  I liked the noodle dish, and the shrimp.  Not the dumplings.  Or that strange omelet thing in gravy.”
“It was a prank,” Stephen explained.  “Retaliation for beating up Terry.  It was only a suggestion to send some bloke to get Harry to leave you. You know, to lure him away.”
As they sat, butterflies began churning in Harry’s stomach while he gathered the nerve to tell Ron what he had set out to that day.
Harry tugged at the kilt he was wearing as part of his traditional Highland dress, complete with brogues and hose.
Laughing, Harry told him, “I’m more of an ‘act now, ask questions later’ type of bloke.  I would have been lost without Hermione.” He began putting the pieces of the game away.  “So, why
“What on earth are you and Nott going to talk about for the entire trip back?” Draco questioned as Pansy sank back down in her seat.
“Are you really excited about the trip?” Harry asked while they walked up the stairway to their quarters.
“Oh, well, I haven’t gotten that far yet.  I’ve been very busy getting my classroom together and helping Draco with Snape’s old office.  And then once the students arrived--”
For the past several weeks, Ron and Harry had been lab partners and Hermione usually paired up with Ginny. Harry walked into class just a step behind Hermione.
As predicted, there was no shortage of witches willing to be the mother of Harry Potter’s child.  For a price, including the chance to meet the elusive wizard.
The room fell silent as the others watched Harry and Olivia sit with their hands on the ball, eyes closed for several minutes.  Suddenly, Olivia’s eyes sprang open and she gazed into the crystal.
“Frankly, it’s rather easy for me, being raised muggle.  I’d really like something more challenging, but the department head values my expertise,” she said without sounding at all boastful.
“Molly hasn’t brought out tea and pudding yet,” Harry answered.  “Besides, the conversation in here won’t be all about babies and such.”
Draco knew his father was hardly reverent.  He simply wanted to appear that way as a means to repair his reputation.  And, as usual, he was looking to his son to accomplish that for him.
“Let me kiss it then, and make it all better.”  Harry sank to his knees to unzip Draco’s trousers. He kissed the hard cock through the pants.
Draco flipped open the lid of the bottle with his thumb and poured some of the oil onto his fingers.  He teased Harry’s opening, drawing a finger over the spot lightly.
“No.  I guess you didn’t either,” Harry answered.  “Why not?  Afraid you might get my wand again?” He laughed.
“Listen to me.  Knox did . . . kiss me but I didn’t want him to.  I came here to tell you everything.  I came to tell you that you were right about him.”
“Not a chance,” Ron said. “If I can be a decent dad, surely you can. But it sounds like you may have told a little white lie to your husband.  If you really believed you’d make a poor father, you wouldn’t be upset that Draco doesn’t want kids.”
“Her?”  Harry’s first attempt to talk came out as a whisper.  So he cleared his throat and tried again. “Who?”
Miranda frowned.  She was hoping to get some good dish out of the evening and the Malfoy boy just spoiled it.
Draco sighed.  He leaned over Harry and whispered, “It was a lovely date.” Then he gently pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“I don’t know, mate.  Isn’t it enough that I’m not throwing up in my mouth a little right now?” Ron laughed.
Boot begged, “Make it stop!”  Clutching his belly, he continued to twitter hysterically as tears streamed down his face.
“You know the stories I wrote?  The ones about the boy called Liam? Well, I was thinking about cleaning them up a bit and trying to get them published.  What do you think? Would you want to help me?”
“Um,” Draco hesitated.  “There is one more thing.  As long as I’m humiliating myself to you, I may as well get this over with.”
He sat down on the settee and leafed through the book.  Harry didn’t mention it, but he must have wanted Draco to read it.  Settling back on a pillow, Draco started at the beginning and read.
While Lucius was still deciding whether or not to sample it, she had eaten hers.  She didn’t hesitate to pick one up and pop it in her husband’s mouth.
Draco looked away, ashamed of clearly disappointing the Headmistress.  He excused himself and went back to his quarters.  He had half-heartedly begun packing his things, hoping that Harry would change his mind before he got too far into it.  After hearing McGonagall talk, he decided just to get it over with.
“Excellent idea,” Pansy agreed.  “Which bed is yours, Seamus?”  His eyes went wide and he pointed.  Pansy jumped on and slipped under the covers.
“You don’t understand Mione,” Harry said.  “If he gets his case overturned, he can bring a case against the Ministry for wrongful incarceration.  He could ask for compensation.”
She smiled up at him.  “All right.  Yes, I’ll marry you. But we can’t say anything about the baby yet.”
“If you will take your places on the dance floor.”  The band leader raised a baton and the band began to play the selection chosen for the first dance. The photographer had followed them from the atrium and clicked away as they danced.
“You expect me to give up Ginny and compromise my grades just so you can cozy up to Draco in class?”
“And what ever would we do there?” Luna smirked.  She batted her eyelashes and gave her best impression of an innocent doe.
“It was different than the others.  A little anyway.  It still started with you telling Blaise I was falling for you. And then he told you it sounded like I wasn’t the only one in danger of falling.”
Draco gave Harry a furtive glance as they walked. The faint smile on his husband’s face made him wonder what he was thinking about. Draco himself recalled his first day back at Hogwarts.  The first day of his fresh start. He remembered walking up the long pathway to the gate and seeing Harry standing there waiting. The man was just as handsome as he’d been in school and seemed just as unaware of the fact.
The newly married Mr. Potter-Malfoy smiled, remembering the day-- and especially the night-- before.  He recalled the urgency with which he had taken Harry as they tumbled into their wedding chamber.  He reveled in the memory of sex by candlelight in the over-sized bath tub.  His heart leapt, thinking about how he had been moved to tears when Harry tenderly made love to him.  They fell asleep wrapped in one another’s arms just before dawn.
Draco stepped back and glanced around.  “Harry,” he whispered.  “There are other students around.  They’re watching.”
Hoping there was enough pre-cum from his leaking cock to make things smooth, Draco pushed Harry’s arse cheeks apart.  He guided his cock in slowly, apologizing every time he felt resistance.
“Oh.”  Harry was beginning to wonder if he would ever come up with an intelligent response. Something aside from ‘oh’.  “Another time, then,” he said, trying to keep the disappointment out of his voice.
“You don’t understand,” Draco grumbled.  “Don’t worry Harry.  It was worth it.” He grinned when he saw the worried look on Harry’s face.
“No, sir.  We recommend that Mr. Lucius Malfoy has satisfied the requirements of his release and should be free to go.”
“You hate it,” Harry pouted. “You know, it wasn’t easy coming up with something. There are a lot of awkward letters in my name now, thank you very much.”
“I don’t blame you, mate.  I wouldn’t tell me either,” Ron laughed.  “So, are you going to that party?”
“That would be you,” Draco retorted. He took a sip of champagne. “I think we need to continue celebrating in the bedroom.  We’ll have to get in all the fucking we can before the baby is born.”
It wasn’t lost on Harry that the sorts of vacations Draco was planning wouldn’t be possible if they had small children. Perhaps Draco was right, at least for the time being. Children didn’t yet fit into their lifestyle.  And they needed time to be alone for a while.
“I have fire whiskey, Sherry, and a bottle of wine.”  He picked up the bottle and looked at it.  “Actually, it’s champagne.”
Not seeing any sign of Madame Pomfrey, Harry tiptoed to Draco’s bed.  The blond boy looked so much smaller than usual.  Paler, too.  Harry sat down in a chair beside him.
As Harry readied himself for his and Draco’s Sunday reading-- sometimes shagging-- ritual, he glanced at the bound book of parchment.  He’d been writing only sporadically since he and Draco began dating, but the newest story was nearly complete.  He was ready for Draco to read and critique it.  The story had been particularly fun to write, especially the sexy parts.  Though Harry himself was twenty by the time he had sex for the first time, Liam, his character was fairly active at sixteen.
Draco straightened himself up and Harry waited for the insult or whatever method of saving his pride Draco was going to use.
With final exams behind them, the students of Hogwarts could finally relax.  As a special treat, McGonagall had the house elves prepare a picnic supper by the lake for students and staff.  As the end of the term approached, spirits were high.
“No problem, mate.  I’m glad to get out of the office for lunch for a change.  Is everything all right?”
Draco glanced up to Harry, who was speaking animatedly about something with Ron. He smiled to himself, thinking about he’d have to give more thought to the connection between the dragon in the book and Harry’s eyes.  Perhaps there had been more than one reason Draco had been captivated by them.
“There are a couple of wonderful restaurants close by, if you insist on leaving our private little retreat.”
Maybe it wasn’t exactly the way they had planned to reveal themselves, but it was done.  Sure, they could still concoct some sort of explanation.  But really, people always believed what they saw.  And what they saw couldn’t be seen as anything other than what it was.
“Disgusting, innit?” Ron said in Hermione’s ear as he jerked his head in Harry and Draco’s direction.
They walked down the corridor to the reception area to retrieve their wands.  Quiet until they left the building, Draco finally spoke, looking out at the ocean view.
“It was fine,” Harry said as he sat down on the settee.  “I got some new parchment, and a book for tomorrow.  We can still read together tomorrow, can’t we?”
Hermione’s question went unanswered as Blaise walked into the room and narrowed his eyes at her, thinking she reneged on the partner switch.  It was just as well, she knew why there was no sexual tension between her and Harry.
Knox shrugged.  “It was actually nice.  The weather there is so different than here.  It got very cold and there was a lot of snow.  But in the summer, it was hot enough to go to beach every day.  And the colors of the trees in the fall were amazing.”
Harry smiled to himself.  He and Draco had a lot to get past in order for their relationship to work.  But as he began to drift off to sleep, he thought it was possible.  And perhaps he could find a way to have Draco
“What do you think? Black shirt, white tie or moss green shirt, black paisley tie?”  Draco queried.  “I’m wearing black trousers.”
“You’ll find out at the end of the party,” she said coldly.  “I’m going to go mingle.” She turned on her heel and marched to the tub of cooling butter beers, grabbed one and joined a group of boys on the other side of the room.
Music began to play, cueing them to walk down the aisle.  Harry held out his elbow for her to take hold. “Shall we?” he asked.
“It’s still okay to be angry.  I was angry, for a long time, at Dumbledore, for the things he kept from me.  I understood it was all for the greater good. But it didn’t make me feel any better.”
Draco rubbed his eyes and stretched.  He’d been in his room working on a lesson plan for what seemed like forever after supper.  All he had left to do was go to the library and reserve the necessary books for his students.  He yawned.  Though he didn’t feel like going to the library at the moment, he wanted to get it over with and have the rest of the weekend free.  It was Friday, and neither he nor Harry had duty that weekend.
He feared the situation was worse than he originally thought, as he came to the conclusion that he found Draco Malfoy attractive.
Draco sat on his bed sulking since he stormed out of supper, when Pansy knocked on the door and let herself in.  The other boys were congregating in the common room, getting ready for what was becoming the weekly party.
Draco’s face paled a bit.  “What did you do?” he asked Cornfoot slowly and deliberately. He took his wand out.
“Dumbledore was going to die anyway.  Did you know that?  He was cursed by one of the Horcruxes.  He asked Snape to do it so you wouldn’t have to.  Dumbledore really did care about you.  So did Snape.”
“Oh, that explains it.  His Confusing and Befuddlement Draught was a bit of a mess.  I gave him a grade for it, but not a good one,” Knox said.  “He said something about trying again.  But I told him no. He looked like he was about to cry,” he laughed.
He made his way back to his chambers with a spring in his step.  Now that he had told his secret to McGonagall, Harry was almost ready to tackle his best friends.  He decided to invite them to visit soon, so he could tell them.  At the very least, it would stop Hermione from trying to set him up on dates with her friends.
However, to get things moving, Draco agreed that she would most likely be more pleasant throughout the pregnancy.  And they wanted to be kept informed as it progressed.
Harry saw Ginny follow Blaise into the boy’s dormitory as the last few couples left the common room.
Draco laughed. “Then we’ll have to stay in our room the whole time.”  He pulled Harry close and kissed him.  “Let’s finish packing so we can get down to supper.  I’m famished.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked.  “I’m sorry I’m so late.  But I brought food.”  He held up his packages.
Nodding, she answered honestly.  “Yes.  I’m a bit sore, but I’m okay.  You were . . . wonderful.  Thank you.” She shyly lowered her gaze.
“You look . . . positively ravishing,” Harry grinned beneath his bandana, but of course, Hermione couldn’t see.  “I’m surprised Ron let you out looking like that?”
“I will Da!”  James ran back to the other boys and the three of them happily skipped down the trail leading to the pond.
By that time, they had reached the head table and proceeded to take their respective seats.  All throughout the meal, Harry wondered what sort of man Draco would be dating.  He found himself feeling more than a twinge of jealousy.  The two had been getting on so well, and he was sure there was some sort of attraction.  Well, there was on his part anyway.  But he reminded himself that Draco didn’t even know Harry was gay.  And unless the man was a glutton for punishment, he wouldn’t be carrying a torch for a straight man.  Harry sighed heavily.
“Yeah.  Are you?” He held his hand up to his chin.  “Sorry, I don’t know what happened.  I just tripped.”  Harry stopped when he heard giggling from around the corner. He realized what happened.  Furious, he got up and drew his wand.
He carelessly threw in his remaining ingredients, causing his potion to bubble unexpectedly, then fizzle out before it had a chance to change color.  Slughorn leaned over Harry’s cauldron. “I’m afraid you’ve jumped the gun, boy. That powdered graphorn has to be added slowly.”
The sight of his lover so vulnerable and trusting made Harry want to devour him.  He was afraid he would cum before they had a chance to get too far into it. They’d been at it for nearly an hour, though. Thanks to the cock rings Harry conjured, their orgasms kept at bay. However, from Draco’s begging, Harry knew too much longer would be uncomfortable, to say the least.
Harry watched his tiny arse switch as he walked.  One of these days, he was going to have that arse.  In the meantime, he sensed that Draco needed to be in control.  Not that he minded a few more shag sessions like the one they just had.
“You looked really pretty,” Ron complimented, trying to get on her good side.  She stared at him blankly.  “But you always look really pretty.  Uh, you didn’t need a make-over either,” he stammered.
Harry clenched his fists.  He was ready to let the little witch have it, when Draco stood and calmly said, “Thank you for your time.  Good day.” He nodded and began to walk toward the door.
For a moment, Harry lay still waiting for Draco’s hand to wander down his chest, or his knee to press up against his bollocks.  But the only move the Potions professor made was to stroke the fringe from Harry’s forehead and kiss it.
Nodding, Harry went on. “I confess that I did as well, until Draco began picking out books about Quidditch or something else of interest to both of us.  Occasionally, he still reads poetry or romantic novels-- or at least he tries.  His voice is so calming, I still fall asleep sometimes.”  He played with the hem of his shirt and lowered his voice. “Or it sounds so erotic, it makes me randy.  Either way, we don’t get much read.”
“Enjoy your new wand,” Ollivander called out as they left.  It would be the last one he sold personally.
“Now I’m thinking that was bad advice,” Hermione admitted.  “Forget what your head is telling you.  What is your heart saying?”
Pulling away, Hermione was in disbelief.  “Again with the bloody cake.  This is what I think of your stupid special cake.” She picked up her foot and stomped squarely on the slice of chocolate dessert.
Draco took one more step and stood a mere foot away, one eyebrow cocked.  Harry could feel the blond’s soft breath on his face.  He swallowed hard and loudly, never taking his eyes off Draco’s smoldering stare.  He was beginning to feel warm and lightheaded.
The first chance Harry got, or rather, took, didn’t come until Thursday of that same week.  After Potions class, he finally gathered up the courage to talk to her.
“For the person drinking it, my boy. I’m not going to put anyone in real danger here. Any other questions?”
Ron laughed heartily at that.  “I reckon that must be strange for you.”  His smile faded.  “But, seriously, I have to admit, this thing between you and Harry seems to be working.  And you did try to save my life.  I guess you’re not so bad after all.”
It was ironic that when they first arrived, Harry was nervous and unsure, and Draco at ease.  Now their roles were reversed.
The corner of Draco’s mouth raised, just a bit.  “All right,” he called after Harry.  “I suppose we should work on that paper.  Sorry Pans.”
Harry gazed into Draco’s eyes.  Removing Harry’s glasses, Draco placed them on the bedside table.  He snuggled Harry closer and closed his eyes.
Hermione and Ron were rendered speechless while they stared, unsure what to do.  Should they announce their presence or simply back up and leave?
“Hermione came to get me around nine.  Pansy’s note didn’t say anything about you being sick, though.”
Draco nodded again.  He understood that true friends saw the whole picture, not just a few famous, or infamous, actions.
They both held their breath as Harry ever so slowly lowered her down into the cot.  When it appeared that she would remain asleep, they tiptoed out of the room and closed the door behind them.
Harry and Ginny dumped the bags full of snacks on a couple of chairs and began to walk through the double doors to the maternity ward.  Draco fell in line with them.
“Ooh,” she squealed.  “I passed them all!  Three Acceptables, three Exceeds Expectations, and one Outstanding.”
Harry shrugged.  He knew Draco didn’t understand his motives.  And Harry didn’t exactly want to explain them.  He was hoping that the pair of them, alone, caring for a child, would spark some sort of yearning in Draco.  It frustrated Harry that Draco seemed to have some innate ability with children that he was blind to.  Dominique, Rose and Percy’s daughter, Molly all responded to him positively. Not to mention the students at Hogwarts.  He was very popular, and not just for his dashing good looks.  He had a patience with them that he hadn’t ever displayed as a youth himself.
“Congratulations, mate.” Ron hugged him.  “Should I tell Mione, or wait for you? Who the fuck am I kidding?  You know I’ll tell her before you get a chance to,” Ron chuckled.
Harry put down a tray carrying a pot of tea, along with two cups, a sugar bowl and a small carafe of milk, on the sitting room table. He took a seat on the opposite side of the table.
“I highly doubt that.  If anything, Ron is going to try even harder to surprise you.  He really is old fashioned at heart. Just look at his parents.”
Draco stopped putting his books in the box. “I’ll be here a few more years at least. I’m not ready to open up a shop yet.” He paused. “You don’t look reassured.”
“So, I’ll go first,” Draco reiterated. He glanced around the room, deciding who to question first. “Ginny.”
Harry and Draco broke apart to see Terry Boot making kissey faces at them. “No fucking for eleven days?  How will you queers ever survive?”  He laughed.  “By the way, how’s the knee, Potter?” Boot walked toward the front door and walked out giggling.
Harry used a cursory cleaning spell on them and went to fill the tub.  While he was at it, he lit several candles and spelled some music to play softly.
The last place she wanted to go was into her room, where Ron had spent the night with Lavender.  But she needed to get her things so she could shower.  Walking past Ron, she didn’t even glance at him.
“I think I’ve already given you far too much leeway.”  Draco placed his hand on the boy’s shoulder. His demeanor softened. “Believe me, Casper, I understand your feelings more than you know.  But unfortunately, sometimes our feelings are not returned.”
“Okay.  She wrote about what happened when the game was over.  Dra, everything went back to the way it was before.”
Draco lay down first with Harry settling between his legs. He leafed through toward the end of the parchment book, and found what he was looking for. He cleared his throat.
Ginny leaned over and inspected his collar.  “You’ve got in on backwards, silly.  Boy, this girl must really have you in a tizzy.  You can’t even dress yourself properly,” she giggled.
Draco lifted his head, intending to stop Harry.  But he was glad that maybe Harry was finally seeing Knox for who he was.
“No.  You made it sound as though I was right about not doing the interview at all.  They’ll find a way to twist whatever you said.”
As he raised and lowered himself, Harry watched Draco’s face relax, his eyes closed and his mouth slack.  He was still staring when Draco opened his eyes.
“You’ve overslept boys,” Pansy chuckled.  “I guess you were just so comfy, you didn’t want to get up.”
Harry felt as if he were punched in the gut.  Is that what they thought?  Because he’s gay, he can’t be part of a family.  He didn’t have a chance to defend himself before Ginny interrupted his thoughts.
“That would seem the logical way to go about it.  Except that your preference admitted to lying.  How are we going to evaluate her application?”
Harry stood awkwardly wondering if he should just unpack the basket he was holding or if he should walk over to the railing to join Draco.  He opted to unpack the snack.
“The usual then?” Draco grinned.  He held Harry from getting up.  “This is how it all started you know.”
Harry backed up before Draco could do anything to stop him.  He turned and quickly descended the stair case.  Mortified on more than one level, Harry mentally berated himself for his foolhardy behavior.  Of course Draco would be entertaining a lover on a Saturday night.  The fact that it was Blaise Zabini was a bit surprising.  Harry was fairly certain he was straight and had been dating one of the Greengrass girls off and on.  Then again, anyone asked about Harry would have said he was straight as well.
The three friends spent the rest of the evening munching on pub grub, beer and lemonade.  Harry made sure not to overindulge in order to apparate back to Hogwarts in one piece.
Victoire Weasley ran to her Grammy, arms wide. The little blonde was the spitting image of her mother. Her younger sister, Dominique, who appeared more Weasley than Delacour, held tight to her matching ginger father.
“Nonsense.” Harry held out his hand.  Normally, he wasn’t one to covet gifts, but his curiosity was piqued.
“Looks like supper’s on me.”  Even though he lost the bet, Harry was in good spirits.  The game had energized him, and it had been announced that Ginny was not seriously injured and would play in the next match.
“Malfoy.”  Harry nodded.  “I would have sent a carriage if I had known you weren’t going to apparate directly to the gate.”
“Oi, Harry, you’re letting him dress you now?”  He shook his head.  “You gonna let him cut your meat too?” he snickered.
Draco’s face flushed a little as he stammered.  “The night . . . um, in the library . . . I sort of told Madam Pince . . .” he mumbled unintelligibly at the end.
Pushing through his embarrassment, Harry answered, “I felt like I’ve never felt before.  We were, you know, in the middle of it.  And I felt so much emotion and I remember thinking that I wanted to feel that way for the rest of my life.  I just let go and I could feel magic all around us.  It was amazing, until the pain.”
“You’re only continuing to prove my point, you know.  You’re exasperating,” Draco told him.  He tried to suppress a smile as he realized Harry was doing it on purpose. The mood had lightened slightly.
“Malfoy, jeez, you’re being a little melodramatic.”  Cornfoot was beginning to have second thoughts about his and Boot’s prank.
Justin Finch-Fletchley sat on the window seat in the Hufflepuff common room with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.
“I don’t care about that.  We’ll be disguised enough that no one will know who we are.  Everyone will be disguised. I’ve heard some people say they’re wearing full costumes.  It’ll be impossible to narrow it down to us.”
“We can always get the House Elves to bring us something later,” Harry suggested.  He continued to disrobe Draco, who didn’t protest.
“We’ve kept dogs at the manor.  But they were closer to watchdogs than pets,” he replied.  He, too, bent down to pet the dog.  “They’re not so bad.”
Ron nodded.  She was right.  With Harry already inside, he was in charge of this mission.  The department couldn’t risk two of their top Aurors.
“Not a chance, mate,” Ron snickered. “I can almost see the cake now.  Three tiers— one for each of you.” He gently touched the blue cap on Harry and Draco’s son. “Twins in the family again.”
“Betting for money is frowned upon, so I thought perhaps a couple of rounds of fire whiskey or supper would do.”
The boys joined Hermione as they began to make their way to the Great Hall.  Harry asked Hermione if she would like to go with him to do some shopping.  She enthusiastically agreed and the pair made plans to leave right after breakfast. As the trio approached the Entrance Hall, they spotted Draco leaning against the wall just outside the stairway to the dungeons.
“I’m sorry, Hermione, but it is,” Draco said.  “Mother has already sent out the information to family and her friends.  It would be humiliating for her to have to rescind it.  I know it sounds silly to you, but in pure blood society, it simply isn’t done.  As it is, having to announce that your son is marrying another man . . .” he trailed off.
“I have the next number,” Luna spoke up.  She reached into the cauldron, capturing Seamus’ wand, which he seemed quite pleased about.  She stood next to him.  “We’re going to have fun tonight,” she told him.
Blaise laughed.  “Yeah, no one has ever been spoiled more than you, Malfoy.  You won’t last five minutes without Daddy’s money.”
“So, you’ve never been in Gryffindor?” Ginny awkwardly asked the Slytherins.  The entire group, sitting scattered around the room, sipped butter beer or firewhiskey or pumpkin juice quietly.  Every so often, someone would make some mundane observation or ask an impersonal question.  But for the most part, they simply glanced around at one another.
Instead of giving away that information, Harry said, “You must be delirious, referring to yourself as a stalker. I’m quite sure Malfoys don’t stalk.” He used his best Lucius Malfoy impression on the last part.
