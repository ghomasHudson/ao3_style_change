The bloody stairs are drafty and steep, and Harry has half a mind to abandon his ascent halfway through and go back home. He’s in good shape—his job requires him to be—but there’s something about this building that scrapes at his nerves and drains him of his energy.
“I can’t believe you have to help Malfoy with Quidditch practice… After all he’s done?” Ron said disapprovingly while stuffing his face with chicken legs.
“What?” he snarled. Malfoy let go of his arm and was now looking him directly in the eyes. Harry had never noticed how soft his skin looked in the sunset.
Harry, who had the Quaffle in one hand, told him “We will pass the ball from one to the other in the beginning, to warm up, and after that, you will try to score into the hoops that I will be defending.”
“Hello, Malfoy! It is a fine day indeed,” Harry approved, noticing how oddly perfect the weather was for Quidditch. “What’s got you so excited about Quidditch practice?” Harry asked him.
“Oh, well, nothing special, I just think we’re going to have a lot of fun.” Draco grinned wider than before and quickened his pace. Harry remembered being this confident only when he had drunk Felix Felicis in his 6
“Took you long enough…” Ron added. Harry smiled, all was right in the world; no more enemies, no more grudges, no more Dark Lords… things couldn’t have been better.
live. I need to survive. Don’t you know it’s tough out there? Life’s a bitch and then you die. Well,” Malfoy adds after a pause, “most of us do, anyway.”
Draco didn’t need a reminder. He didn’t need a reminder of his own inaptitude as a demon, and he didn’t need a reminder of the ticking of passing time, of his numbered days in this life until he had to start everything all over again, and again, forever.
“I would probably have wanked all night to thoughts of you,” he says, meaning to sound dismissive, managing only to sound painfully honest.
“I said I had news,” Draco says quietly. He waves at the parchment in silent suggestion. Harry casts a wordless Lumos
“Don’t doubt yourself, darling,” Draco reassures as he walks towards her. “The only purpose of the ‘Bend and Snap’ is to enhance your natural beauty and sexiness.”
A few years ago, Angelica, the Mind-Healer he was seeing at the time, had asked him why he insisted on working for the Ministry for Magic when the place always left him restless and anxious. He had told her the same thing that still holds true today: the Atrium, the lifts, the stairs, the bloody corridors and sodding offices and meeting rooms… they were all part of his history. He could either deny it all or accept it all, but he wasn’t going to pick and choose.
“No?” Narcissa’s tone is soft but deadly. A snake among high grass. “Are you going to stand here and insist that you are not actually involved with my son, Mr Potter?”
“Your friends Granger and Weasley will be joining us tonight,” Draco had said, resting his back against the door jamb, casual as you please.
— and feels something painful twist in his gut. Draco is still holding on to that piece of information, hiding it even from people he considers his friends.
I told him. The gold one will look good on Harry's hand. (The left one. The other one has a cool scar. I keep finding new ones.) (He has lots of them. Like Daddy.) Daddy paid for the ring. Got a small, dark blue velvet box to put it in.
“Yes,” Hermione says. “Potions without heart is Poison.” She gives him a crooked smile. “You didn’t know that, did you?”
And he’s been truthful, this time. When Harry walks out of the bathroom stall, Draco is combing his hair in front of the mirror. There’s a square piece of parchment on the counter, with a Floo address scribbled on it.
Draco's breath hitched when the door creaked open. From behind it, Luna Lovegood’s heart-shaped face appeared. She smiled at him.
He found the owls waiting for him when he brought Scorpius back from school that afternoon. The messages rattled him to the point where even Scorpius noticed.
“You have no idea,” Draco muttered, buttering a piece of toast. It wasn’t even half past eight in the morning, classes were about start soon, and he felt as though he had already lived through a full day.
this song!” she says. She puts the record on and tipsily hums along, gliding out in the garden where they all greet her with hoots and cheers. She opens her arms, face lifted towards the black, starry sky, and roars,
“Not too sure where she'll be, she's quite small.” Harry padded around the room, lifting up cushions and peering under an armchair.
Draco glances at him. His mouth twists at the corner, almost imperceptible. “The happy accidents of Ministry bureaucracy.”
“Harry,” Kingsley’s deep voice pulls him out of his listlessness. “Thank you for coming at short notice. If you’ll follow me?”
Luna, meanwhile, had taken a seat in the large, green velvet armchair after setting a potted Asphodel on the floor. From under the shadow of the palm tree, she smiled benignly at Draco.
and it’d been a long time since Harry had done this—and finally, finally, when Harry thought he never would, Malfoy bottomed out inside him.
Draco leant over to get a closer look. He scrunched his nose up at the smell of brimstone. “Hagrid. I should have known.”
A heavy silence falls after Draco’s words. They’re going to have to. If they want to keep up appearances — if they want to buy time, give Harry enough to convince the Ministry of Draco’s innocence…
Harry doesn’t know why he does it. Intuition, probably. One of the instincts he’s learned to follow in his line of work — since he was a child, more accurately. He taps the roll with a Reducto and stuffs it in his pocket.
Harry’d received the memo from Dewey almost as soon as he’d walked out of the Ministry ten days before. Now, after what feels like an instant, his meeting with Kingsley is in three days.
Harry’s not sure how to answer that. “I don’t think so… not that I could tell. It took him a while to settle.”
as Harry palms his ribs and his bony hips. Listening to Draco’s strained breath as Harry takes him in his mouth and sucks him slow and deep. Letting Draco’s release drip down his chin when he comes. Burrowing his head in the crook of Draco’s hip, inhaling the heady scent of him as he ruts against the mattress, sprawled between Draco’s open legs, Draco’s hands in his hair. Draco who’s petting him, encouraging him, whispering, mindless and sweet,
“I remember,” Harry says. The softness in his voice makes Draco ache. Makes him want to spill everything he’s been holding inside to Harry.
“You feel so good,” Harry mumbles when their lips part, hungry, incoherent. He’s still holding back. He lifts his head to bite at Draco’s shoulder, follows the bite with an open-mouthed kiss. His whole body is trembling, his shoulder blades damp and shivering under Draco’s palms.
The view was indeed stunning. However, Malfoy was unfortunately right: it wasn't why they were here. Five years of serving in the Aurors and it was the first case he was assigned with Malfoy. Once in five years; all in all, Harry could consider himself lucky.
He glanced at Harry again, as one would glance at his life buoy when lost at sea. Harry caught his gaze and squeezed his knee reassuringly.
Harry stays in the foyer with a quiet Scorpius. Balzac sprawls on the floor next to Scorpius and blinks at Harry, as if assessing what Harry's going to do next. In the midday sunlight, the room suddenly feels hushed, and Harry battles with a nonsensical urge to fill the silence. He searches his head for something to say, something to tell Scorpius. Other than Teddy, who is a few years older than Scorpius, and Ron and Hermione’s daughter who’s only a couple of years younger but strikes him as radically different, he can’t say he’s around children a lot. What do kids like these days? What does a kid like Scorpius like? He thinks back to Scorpius’s room, the treble-shaped lamp and the big book by his bedside table. Making him talk about the things he’s interested in seems like a reasonable way to start a conversation with a socially awkward seven-year-old.
Harry Potter had his head lowered over a scroll of parchment, a lone black curl falling on his forehead, failing to obscure his infamous scar. The light of the nearby fire caught on his spectacles. The lights and shadows turned Harry’s glasses white, making him look like one of Mephistopheles’s ravens. The pink tip of his tongue was caught between his front teeth. For once, he was deeply focused on his homework.
When he comes to, Harry’s humming softly against his cheek, his clean hand stroking Draco’s damp hair away from his face. They’ve had sex, quick and rough, loveless in everything but the soft touches of Harry’s hands in the aftermath. Things he can never allow himself to take for granted. Things he must never let Harry take for granted. Even though it might be too late, even as Harry rocks them together, as slow and tender as he was hard and possessive a minute before.
It was easier this time: all Draco had to do was follow his instincts. He listened to the music of Harry’s breath, of his moans getting more needy and whiny as Draco increased his speed, of his own heart beating like the wings of a phoenix in his throat. He sucked Harry harder, licking across his slit on his way up, pushing his cock further and further down his mouth on his way down. He knew he must be drooling but he couldn’t bring himself to care; not when Harry was shaking against him, trying desperately to stay still, his hands clawing at the door, his balls tightening against his body.
“Thanks to you, Potter,” Draco said, unable to stop the bitterness from seeping into his tone. “Because you’re the most fantastic captain that team’s ever got. See what I meant by people coming to these reunions to brag? I just told you about my failed marriage, and you go on and on about how amazing your life is.”
“What the fuck, Draco? Don’t talk about them like that,” Harry burst out, and Draco wondered if he’d gone too far, but he couldn’t stop now. “Don’t talk about them like that, when we’re all still mourning—”
Jeff huffed and looked away. He had his little paws crossed over his chest, deep in thought. His tail swished back and forth on the duvet. Eventually, he eyed Draco again.
But apparently, an ex-Slytherin, ex-Death Eater lover was not advantageous enough for the Saviour’s public image.”
But right now Harry’s feeling too shitty about what he’s asking to actually say that word. He tries to explain anyway. “It’s just that… everything I do, or don’t do, everyone I’m ever with… it all ends up in the papers somehow, no matter how much people swear they haven’t told anyone… but then the person they tell it to also swears they’ll ever tell anyone, and so on, and so forth.”
The thought is terrifying, but not as much as waiting for the ballet to end, for the lights to come back on, for Harry to walk back home, bleary-eyed and hopelessly alone.
He rubbed his face, mortified. “Harry, I’m so sorry. Merlin. That was the most unprofessional thing I’ve ever done.”
She pours water into a massive green teapot on the table. “Spain, Mistor Potter.” The ‘r’ of his name rolls off her tongue like a song.
painfully alternating between hopeful and hopeless. They only have the beginning of a solution, he and Draco — and Hermione, actually, as she jumped headfirst into their plans as soon as they gave her the opportunity. She often visited Caduceus’ laboratories these days; her and her small team of Unspeakables were there to evaluate the possibility that Caduceus premises could host the new branch of research Hermione and Draco had agreed on. A week before, as they were taking off their lab robes and goggles after a round of the labs, she’d snapped at Draco for being all jittery.
In the silence that follows, Harry holds Malfoy’s cool gaze, the grey of his irises reflecting the gold and red glow of the fire. The grandfather clock ticks the passing seconds. Harry’s heart slows down. In the distance, a car drives past the house, the sound of the engine muffled by the hedges and windows.
Okay now, people are shooting confetti and Kingsley has been gaping for a good two minutes and the lunch witch is holding her face and crying tears of joy. IT IS CHAOS (happy, blissful chaos).
“Hmm. They do look similar.” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “You see the thing with dragons...”
right? He must have known the effect his little stunt would have on Draco. The proximity, the physicality of exhaling his breath into Draco’s mouth, of Draco inhaling Harry’s breath into his lungs. The slow slide of Harry’s fingers along his jaw, his cheek, into his hair. The look he’d given him just before blowing smoke into his mouth—a little mischievous, a little cocky, but also... soft, fond, trustworthy.
Malfoy places a hand on Harry’s chest, pushes him off. The gesture’s not unkind, but it is firm. Something crumples inside Harry.
Malfoy shakes himself at last. “First Granger and Weasley, and now you? I should have known you wouldn’t be far behind. You three are joined at the hip, aren’t you?” At Harry's perplexed frown, Malfoy only smiles, a tense little thing. “We’ve got to stop meeting like this.”
“He does, babe,” Ginny confirmed. She kissed Luna’s temple and stroked the Niffler’s little head. “Jeff it is!”
and not count on Polyjuice or a glamour to hide my identity like I usually do on cases. I can’t see things going well for me if I contact Malfoy after twelve years and ask to be his friend.”
Harry feels his temper rising for the first time in days. “Thanks? For the awkward situation? How was I supposed to know—”
Malfoy has Harry’s flies open faster than Harry can react. Malfoy. On his knees. Malfoy on his knees in front of Harry, his intent unmistakable, his fingertips skimming the waistband of Harry’s pants. Harry grabs at coats, grabs at Malfoy’s shoulder, grabs at anything that might prevent him from toppling over as his knees go weak. Malfoy on his knees, about to— to blow him.
Harry joined them, putting his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “He’s not wild, though. Look, he’s wearing a collar.”
Malfoy, a small voice at the back of his mind reminds him. He ignores it, the same way he ignores all the inconvenient questions and feelings bubbling in his head, in his chest. There are always two ways of solving things. One is thinking, and the other is doing. Harry’s always been more fluent in the second. So he turns on his heels and climbs the stairs instead. He goes up towards the second, third, fourth floor. Here, the ceiling is even lower. The dark-painted doors lining the wall are those leading to the cheap, low-visibility seats far above the stage. Harry pads along the carpeted floors. It’s impressively quiet up here, but Harry’s heart speeds up nonetheless. He feels a waft of cool air that seems out of place in the stuffy stillness of the corridor. He hurries forth and turns a corner.
Malfoy doesn’t speak, and neither does Harry. All Harry does is nod — a frightened, hesitant jerk of the chin — and Malfoy lowers Harry’s briefs with a slow grin.
“I should have known your bad manners extended to bed, Potter,” he’s saying. Across from Harry, Narcissa’s smile widens like the Cheshire Cat’s while Harry fights the urge to hide his face in his hands. “There’s nothing I fancy more than a morning sha—ah.
Then again, Malfoy wasn’t most people. He just said what he wanted to say and consequences be damned. Whether the one he was talking to was a barely-tamed Hippogriff or the Great Harry Potter, to Draco Malfoy, it was all the same.
The truth stumbles from Harry’s mouth before he can stop it. He can feel Malfoy’s grin against his ear.
Harry is so taken by the spectacle on stage and the whirlpool of his own thoughts that he doesn’t notice the man who slides in the seat next to him. Until the stranger leans in and whispers in Harry’s ear: “I never would have pegged you as a ballet enthusiast.”
“Harry,” Draco said. His given name still felt foreign on his tongue. Foreign, but sweet, like his mother’s chocolate truffles. “You came.”
He’d started talking to him, mesmerized by Malfoy’s glinting eyes behind those glasses, his thin lips curled in disdain or amusement as he and Harry had fallen in conversational stride. There was no casual chitchat with Malfoy. It was all or nothing, tension springing out of the most harmless comment, challenges hidden in every word.
He needs to get a grip. He’s been on the case for almost two months now. He keeps telling himself he’s taking his time, weaving his web, letting Draco feel comfortable around him until he lets something — anything — slip.
in his lap. Teddy stirred in his sleep, his hair slowly turning from turquoise to cobalt blue. He found his thumb and started sucking it.
“Hello, darling,” Pansy purred, leaning over her books to look at the boy closer. The poor thing flinched. Pansy’s toothy smile, which she meant to be reassuring, looked positively feral instead. “Are you looking for something? Someone?”
he’d called Scorpius. Smith had deserved the Stunner he’d got in the chest. Merlin, he would have deserved a thousand more. Draco would have killed Smith if his son hadn’t been there, watching him. Draco can’t decide what the worst punishment for that absolute bastard could be.
“Just taking a walk around the place,” Harry says, casting a discreet Tempus. Only quarter past nine. God, he’s twenty-five and already getting old.
In the beginning, all I could see was the negative. Public opinion about me might be more favourable than in the past, yet I doubt I was Wizarding Britain’s favourite candidate for Harry Potter’s partner. I’ll admit, I was scared at first. Scared that you’d change your mind about us.
She lifted an eyebrow. Her thoughts on such childish behaviour were plainly written on the disapproving frown on her face.
Harry’s hands slide down Draco’s sides, and he’s pushing him against the door. It rattles in its hinges, and Draco faintly pictures all his coworkers pressing their ears to the other side and stifling giggles. It would be mortifying, if it wasn’t for Harry’s fingers hesitating just below the waistline of his jeans.
“Harry you don’t have to deny it. It’s alright…” Hermione assured him. “Malfoy’s changed; we all know that. It’s fine if you like him, Harry, really.”
Harry was taken aback by his sudden confession. He didn’t know what to say... He felt bad for Malfoy for a moment, starting to realize what he’d been through. “Draco – I –” Harry started saying, but he couldn’t finish the sentence. He mounted his Firebolt and zoomed away to Gryffindor Tower, leaving Malfoy in the middle of the Quidditch pitch crying and alone.
Headmistress McGonagall, taking the advice of the Sorting Hat, decided that house unity was very important. As a result, she disbanded all house Quidditch teams and established four mixed teams, each of them required to have at least one member of each house. Many students protested, but she didn’t change her mind. “You either accept the new Quidditch system or there will be no Quidditch at all!” Somehow, people thought the latter would be worse, so they complied and formed their teams.
“Yes… but it wasn’t what you’d think” Harry said, avoiding eye contact with her. His insides felt like they were put in a blender. He wished he could just vanish up to the boys’ dormitory and think this over in peace.
Harry almost choked on the chicken leg that was in his mouth. “Umm…no,” he said reluctantly, “why would I talk to him?”
“Hey…” Harry said softly to Ron and Hermione. He wasn’t prepared for this, but it was the right thing to do.
“Alright, mate, if that’s what you want,” Ron said. Hermione took Harry and Ron into a hug and Harry whispered to them “I love you.” He truly had the best of friends anyone could ask for.
Malfoy was taken aback, but willing to talk. He nodded and said “Where?” Harry grabbed his arm and lead him into an empty classroom.
Harry was the captain of “Dumbledore’s Army” as a Seeker alongside Ron as a Keeper, Anabelle Sunfire (a 3
Malfoy saw right through Harry, though; he knew that he hadn’t really accepted his apology. He thought that by getting close to him, he could prove to Harry that he had changed. That’s why he asked Professor McGonagall if he could join Harry’s team.
“I– I’m fine” Harry answered, calmly. He felt very bad. His friends shouldn’t have to be afraid of saying what they think near him, acting like he was a bomb waiting to go off. “I have to go.” Harry got up and walked away. Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but he was already by the door.
Harry’s lips curled into a smile. “If he’s as good of a chaser as he was a seeker, we’re screwed…”, he thought.
Hermione caught Harry by his arm and looked him in the eyes. When he turned around, he half-hoped that he would look in the Slytherin’s icy grey eyes again and say to him what he had been dying to say ever since he left.
Other than the occasional sight of Malfoy, Harry tried to keep him out of his mind. He was not ready to deal with everything he felt so he ignored it. His attitude towards the Slytherin hadn’t changed though, he still hated him with a burning passion. He hated him for playing with his heart. He hated him because “How could I ever like such a horrible,
“I just wanted to say– ” Harry was nervous, why did he do this? He took a deep breath and spoke. “I forgive you,” he said truthfully. There was a pause “A–and I hope you can forgive me as well. You know, for leaving you alone on the Quidditch pitch…” He felt a wave of relief washing over him. His back straightened and everything seemed brighter. Letting go of something he had been holding onto so tightly for most of his life was hard. It was like he was carrying a boulder on his back, weighing him down with every step he took, but now he was free. He never thought forgiveness would feel so good. He could feel a smile forming on his lips, but he tried to stay serious, waiting for Draco’s response.
“Hello, Potter,” Malfoy snorted. Harry didn’t know why everyone said he had changed. He seemed to be the same arse he had always been. However, he promised to give him a chance so he had to endure any snide comments from him for the next hour.
“I saw him entering the Great Hall with a wide smile on his face, but he wouldn’t say what got him in such a great mood. I just assumed it was you,” she explained.
“I can’t believe McGonagall!” Harry said in frustration. “She actually wants me to give Draco Malfoy, the man who helped
Hermione continued like she didn’t even hear him, “Malfoy might have been an evil prat most of his life, but you
They looked at each other in the eyes for a second then shot up in the air, circling 10 feet above the ground. Draco came next to Harry and asked “What’s the plan?”
Malfoy made a small celebratory gesture, but he quickly stopped because he didn’t want Harry to know how much he wanted this. They both landed on the green grass and went towards the castle. Harry was looking at Malfoy. The sweat on his face shimmered in the sun and his smile gave his face a beauty he had never noticed before. They were walking near each other, not saying anything, catching their breaths, and admiring how the Hogwarts grounds shone under the morning sun. Harry was also admiring the tall, pale boy beside him, wondering how he had never noticed before how gorgeous Draco Malfoy is.
“Oh,” Harry replied, “that would be fun,” he said, trying to resist smiling too hard. They continued the rest of the walk in silence.   “Well, see you around, Potter,” Malfoy said as he parted with Harry at the entrance.
“I know, Professor, but you know how Potter feels about me… Isn’t the whole point of mixed teams to show that we can move past old grudges and work together? Wouldn’t me and Potter in the same team be the perfect example for that?” Draco pleaded.
“Then move on… You know he feels bad for what he did.” Harry opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione cut him off “People change, Harry… They make mistakes…”
Hermione hugged him and he started crying on her shoulder. Everything he had ever suppressed about Malfoy just spilled out. He was crying like he never had before…
“Well, that worked out fine,” Harry thought. He left the classroom and was walking through the halls. He jumped a little with every step he took towards the common room, cheery from his last encounter with Draco Malfoy.
As the wind was blowing on his face, he was trying to process what had just happened. Draco Malfoy – apologized? — sincerely?! That was a side of him he had never seen before. He was kind of regretting that he left him alone on the field. He shouldn’t have left… He had so much to say to him…
“Well, you remember that summer when I first came to Grimmauld Place? I was so mad that you hadn’t told me anything about what was happening and I started yelling, blaming you for that, when Dumbledore made you promise not to tell me anything. Since then I’ve noticed that you try not to say things that you think might make me start yelling again. I don’t want you to have to control yourself around me. I realize now how I’ve been acting, and I promise I will try to control my anger, justified or otherwise.”
They continued in silence until they reached the Quidditch pitch and mounted their brooms. Harry shot a look at Malfoy and he looked back.
a Death Eater…” Harry said, less sure of himself. He did not want to believe Malfoy had changed. “Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater” he thought.
year to retake their classes. Most of them hadn’t passed their N.E.W.T. exams, but the Ministry of Magic decided that due to stress and incompetent teachers, they were allowed to retake it the following year. Nonetheless, not many students returned.
Or perhaps he’s projecting the things he cannot allow himself to feel onto a squid. As though to punctuate his madness, the tentacle gives him an even sharper squeeze which prompts a sigh from the empty bellows of his chest. How washed-up must one be to find camaraderie in a fucking squid?
Hermione clearly shoves him away, and her chastising voice fades into silence as they disappear, leaving Harry in a much better mood than when he’d awoken. Shaking his head, he rises, scrubbing a hand down the dark scruff on his face, leaving his dream behind as he sets about brushing his teeth.
Harry’s mouth has fallen open. For the first time since Malfoy arrived on Hogwarts grounds, he looks at him fully, and he knows he’s gaping but is unable to stop himself. The left half of Draco’s face is scarred by shifting red-purple-grey slashes which seem to swell and recede with his heartbeat. Tension is snapping, thick in the air, subsiding only when the newest addition to the school’s staff sits back down and the students erupt into new, excited conversation.
“Malfoy.” This time, Draco holds his teacup out, waiting for Harry to pour the water. He obliges. A strange and electric tension snaps in this mundane act of making tea.
“I had to leave.” Quieter, now, Malfoy seems to be talking more to the empty air than to Harry. “After I left St. Mungo’s, I couldn’t go back to the Ministry. They weren’t going to push me out or ask me to leave. I could still do my job. But I couldn’t go back. So I came here. Practically begged McGonagall for a job, embarrassingly enough, and luckily Flitwick had just sent notice of his illness. And here I am.”
With a blur of motion, Harry whips the Sneakoscope at her, sharp eyes watching her face as she first realises what’s happening and then reacts. Her pupils dilate, nostrils flare, and with an audible pop, the Sneakoscope disappears, reappearing a moment later with a quiet rattle atop Harry’s desk. He laughs loudly, leaning back in the chair with an impressed grin wide across his mouth.
“Episkey,” Draco murmurs, and the numb tingling turns to… nothing. Blissful nothing. Harry gasps audibly, tears of relief springing to his eyes. The nothingness doesn’t last long, but the ache which returns on its heels is dull, not the sharp twisting he’s become accustomed to.
This gets him a laugh — quiet, but a laugh all the same, and he finds his own smile spreading widely across his face. Harry takes this as his cue to leave.
“Waxing nostalgic?” The voice is low, amused, and it makes Harry’s teacup fall from his hand. Only an instinctual throb of magic saves it from shattering into a thousand pieces, meeting a steaming death against the cold stone floor. Draco’s eyes narrow as he realises that Harry’s wand is not in his hand, but he says nothing of it. “Didn’t mean to frighten you, Potter.”
“I… wasn’t much of a gentleman in the last few minutes,” Harry says, feeling a fierce blush on his cheeks at the very fresh memory.
I came back last night. Did you see me waiting with the back door crowd? I swear it’s you. It’s you, isn’t it? So this is where you disappeared to. Everybody’s been looking for you, did you know that? And here you were, hiding in plain sight.
“I thought they’d never leave,” Harry tells him. They both know who he’s referring to. “I don’t mind guarding your pretty arse, Malfoy, but keeping those snivelling quillpushers away from you for weeks was exhausting.”
“No? It's pure coincidence that you and Potter went missing for the same length of time yesterday, and that I found you in the Library muttering Muggle love songs today?”
Harry was surprised by Draco addressing him, but he answered promptly. “The team practice is on Sunday, but I don’t know how good of a Chaser you are –” Draco cut him off.
Malfoy ran up to him and grabbed him by the arm, “Wait!” he said desperately. Harry turned around and saw Malfoy looking at him, with fear in his eyes. Harry was confused. What was Draco Malfoy scared about?
“That’s very nice of you, but I don’t want you to do that anymore. I want you to be able to say anything you want to say in front of me.” He said decidedly.
“Why did you ask for me to help you with Quidditch practice when it is obvious you’d rather be anywhere but here?” Harry snapped. He had barely exchanged a few word with Malfoy and he was already fuming. “This was a bad idea… Why don’t you find some other Quidditch team to practice with? Hermione was wrong, you will never change…” Harry turned around and stormed away, furious.
“Can you block this one, Potter?” Malfoy smirked. He threw the Quaffle towards the right hoop. It was so fast that Harry barely saw it. Malfoy scored. “Any more doubts?” he asked, looking proud of himself. He was beaming at Harry who was beaming back.
They moved on to Malfoy trying to score in the hoops and he was surprisingly good at that too. Where had all this talent been hiding? He scored a lot of points, but Harry blocked most of the shots, he was a surprisingly alright Keeper. He was trying hard because he could not lose to Malfoy.
“Oh, alright…” McGonagall conceded. “I will talk to Potter, but you better not be up to something, Mr. Malfoy, I am warning you.”
“On Merlin’s beard, Potter, do you have to be so dramatic?” Draco scoffed, smiling a little. “After two weeks of completely ignoring me, you bump into me in the halls then you drag me into an empty classroom to tell me you forgive me?” He now smiled broadly as he saw Potter blush.
Harry was waiting in the common room for Ron and Hermione. He didn’t have a plan for what he would say exactly when they came, but he thought he’d figure it out in the moment. His head was spinning while he was remembering all the times that he had yelled at his two best friends, the two people who helped him defeat Voldemort for good.
“Oh– well, we’ll talk about that later,” Harry told them, blushing a little. He took a deep breath and continued, “I– I wanted to say I’m sorry…” He looked Hermione right in the eyes and then turned to Ron, “I’m sorry for being such a bad friend sometimes… I don’t want you to be careful what you say near me, afraid that you might offend me and I will start shouting. I–” Harry wanted to go on, but Hermione cut him off.
“Hagrid,’ Harry whispered back and he crouched down next to the small slumbering dragon, the awe he held for this tiny creature written clearly on his face.
“Scorp—” Harry calls. Malfoy hasn’t come back from the kitchen. He’s supposed to stay with Scorpius.
Draco had successfully managed to avoid the former in his first hundred lives, although he'd come a bit too close to it for comfort last year.
They had missed their morning classes. By the time they’d gone down to the Great Hall for lunch, the whole school had seemed to know exactly what they’d been up to.
Luna blinked behind her goggles. “I’ve seen it before. My dad’s aura was all kinds of bonkers after my mum died. But it will come back,” she said confidently. “And then you two will look so pretty side by side with your auras matching.” She smiled at him. “I can’t wait.”
“Even better,” Draco growls, pumping his fist in time with Harry’s fingers sliding in and out of his arse, Harry’s come leaking out of him as his orgasm mounts. He writhes against the desk, overstimulated, chasing relief.  “I’m about to come, Harry, I’m—” he warns, not knowing why he does, and Harry wraps his other arm around Draco’s chest, lifts him off the desk. Held upright by Harry’s arm, Harry’s fingers still pumping inside him, Draco’s body goes taut. His orgasm hits him like that, and he comes with a strangled cry, his come splashing over his belly, Harry’s arm, his desk. He drops his head back against Harry’s shoulder and lets out a strangled sob as his fist works his spent cock, shivering with the last waves of his orgasm.
Now he was understanding it for what it was: taunting, playful, and just a tiny bit desperate for Harry’s attention.
Harry looks at Malfoy then. Malfoy’s expression is unreadable. He surveys Harry in a manner that would be extremely unsettling, were Harry not playing a role.
“Good evening, gentlemen,” she gestured at the two seats across from her. Two tea cups popped on the desk in front of them, wafting the smoky scent of Lapsang Souchong towards them. “I daresay you know why I have called you in tonight?”
The trapdoor lifted with an eerie creek. When they leaned over to look inside, all they could see was darkness so thick it was almost dizzying. Harry pulled his wand and aimed at it.
When he goes downstairs to the kitchen, he finds the Golden Snitch returned, gleaming faintly on the table.
Draco stays quiet for a long time, his gaze down and away, his teeth worrying his bottom lip. Harry holds his breath and waits, while outside the office the night sky turns fully dark, yellow-grey clouds crossing it, the lights of the city reflecting on their rain-soaked edges.
“Now,” Draco says, eyes staring into the middle distance. His voice sounds thick. “Now I’m going to pick myself off the floor, make myself a cup of tea, and clean up this mess…”
“Charming as ever,” Ron rolled his eyes but plopped himself on the chair next to Draco. “You’re a bloody ray of sunshine. To think Harry chose
“Maybe,” Harry sighed. “I know what the public sees in me. But at the end of the day, Draco...I’ve dealt with the past the same way all my friends have. The same way
“I need you to not be there when I get home.” Draco’s words have an unarguable finality to them. Harry’s stomach sinks.
Malfoy surveys him a moment longer, very still if for the fingers of his right hand, clenching against the fabric of his trousers.
“It’s weird,” she told him. “Your aura is both pink and blue. Happy and sad.” Behind her goggles, her eyes were wide and thoughtful. “Are you okay, Draco?”
“Malfoy—wait,” he said, pushing up. Malfoy’s fingers slipped out of his arse and they both heaved a disappointed sigh. Harry shook himself into action. “There’s something here… Look.”
They were people he’d get to live with and love for the rest of the one life he had left. They were people he wouldn’t abandon to go live another demonic cycle when things got tough.
Harry’s trousers are thankfully clean, but his shirt has been torn half open somewhere in the midst of their...
“Sod off, Potter,” Draco elbowed him in the side but grinned. Aside from him making a fool of himself, things were going well. Harry seemed genuinely happy to be in his company. “You didn’t tell me what you thought of my suggestion.”
“Enough with the righteous Saviour act, Potter. You know as well as I do that this mistake will mark me forever.”
They stayed facing each other, hand in hand, cheeks pink, stupid grins on their faces, until Smith cleared her throat.
That’s the power of it though, isn’t it? Making you think you’re a willing participant. Upbringing and family ties can be harder to shrug off than an
Pad out of my bedroom. Balzac follows me. I wave my hand, let my magic out, tell the motion-sensing charms not to chime.
You could easily have revealed the source of Caduceus’ starting funds. Who could possibly find fault with that?”
“Still the sharp tongue, I see,” Narcissa comments to Draco with a lifted eyebrow when the house elf is gone and Draco leads them to the dining room. Harry can’t tell if her tone is disapproving or admiring.
It’s either Potter hovering by the beakers, poking his fat fingers in the petri dishes, messing with DMLE evidence, and giggling like a schoolgirl with Draco,
Malfoy mutters against Harry’s jaw. Harry snorts, and to his surprise and delight, he feels Malfoy shake with silent laughter against him. Like they’re schoolboys, hiding from the Prefects doing their rounds.
It’s clearly meant as a joke, but Harry’s face turns pink. With one last flustered look at Draco, he grabs the remaining clothes from Draco’s hands, turns on his heels and scurries away. Feeling contrite and annoyed with himself, Draco sighs. It was so unlike him to act on impulse… but the way Harry had looked, waiting in the foyer like there was still hope for them… it grated on his nerves. It made Draco want to punish him for it. Rub the marks of his teenage mistake in his face. And he’s gone and made things bloody worse between them. If that is even possible.
“I’m always busy,” Malfoy says, his tone sharp, then seems to catch himself. “Merlin, that sounded awfully self-important.” He looks oddly flustered, exhales, annoyed with himself. “Anyway, it’s your first day, I can take the time to help you get started.”
“These are my rooms,” he tells Harry, the neutral, tour-guide tone back on, as if he hadn’t shut him down a second ago. “Study, bedroom, bathroom,” he enumerates. “You can go have a look. I’ll wait for you here.” He turns to look at Harry expectantly. Adds, “I have nothing to hide.” The words send a zing of disquiet through Harry, but he decides to ignore it, instead stepping inside the study.
He looks at Harry. It’s a grief-stricken stare that goes through Harry’s heart, raw and sharp like a knife.
Draco’s eyes never left Hermione as she spoke. When she stopped, he noticed he was holding his breath. The napkin in his lap was half torn to shreds. Their little group lapsed into a loaded, mournful silence.
As Malfoy moved up the queue, and Harry stared some more, Ron gently grabbed him by the shoulder. “Come on, Harry. If you’re not going to finish…” He nodded towards Harry’s plate. “Time to go back to the office. Let’s go.”
“You should come visit us in Chicago, my dear,” says Mrs Peterson. “The Lincoln Park Zoo has a magical creatures extension and we’re lucky to have a very rare specimen of Acromantula Pustulis there. Though me and my husband might be partial to Bitsy,” she leans in to whisper in mock confidence, “as we sponsored her transfer from that horrid zoo that went bankrupt, when was it, three years ago?”
Harry moved with a soft whine, Draco’s come dripping down his leg as he did. Chest heaving, he muttered a quick
And underneath all this, the image of Harry remains, lying in a hospital bed with an arm he’d sprained while protecting Draco’s son. Draco’s heart leaps and twists in his chest, his emotions shifting too fast between hurt, anger, sadness, fatalism. Scorpius doesn’t notice the change in atmosphere. Draco is thankful for his son’s obliviousness, even if remembering the circumstances that prevent Scorpius from noticing Harry is gone is like taking a blunt hit in the gut.
Draco furrowed his brow. Of all the parts of his demonic life he had become accustomed to, Jeff the Niffler sure wasn’t the one he’d thought would follow him into his human adventure.
“I think so,” Harry sighs. “Last night, we…” He feels his face heat. Ron and Hermione exchange a glance. “We’re definitely together. His mother knows… maybe even his friends.”
Draco felt an odd pang of nostalgia at the memory. At the time, the rook-shaped house had slightly unsettled him, accustomed as he was to the strong, straight, classical lines of the Manor. He had covered his unease and had followed his little cousin up to her room while the adults had tea downstairs. It was the only time he’d been there. There was something about Luna’s mother that Lucius disapproved of, and it kept them from returning. They still saw each other on big family events throughout their childhood, but it was neither substantial nor consistent enough to build a bond based on familial ties alone.
It’s like the sum of all of Harry’s worries, questions, and trepidation since Malfoy left are materialising in those few curt words. Harry can tell Malfoy is doing his best to act detached, nonchalant, even. But the cool glare of his eyes speaks of something much more personal. Malfoy’s upset. He’s hurt.
He realises too late that the remark might have been insensitive, because Ernestina throws him a bristling look.
They’re standing so close, Malfoy propped against the kitchen table, Harry chest to chest with him. Harry can see the tiny flecks of gold in Malfoy’s grey irises. When Malfoy speaks, his warm breath bathes Harry’s face.
“‘She’s a survivor,’ they’ll say. They’ll make excuses for me. But it’s also so...confining. It’s like being in this gilded cage. If I reach out, if I open up, if I share too much, people get scared. ‘I’m not equipped for this,’ they’ll say. ‘Why don’t you seek professional help?’ But at the end of the day, I’m just
He just wished working on it wouldn’t constantly paint him into a corner. He had atoned for a lot of his past. He had made his peace with it.
It’s precisely about survivors of the Second Wizarding War. The interview is mainly about you being a war hero.”
there was no doubt about it. He looked a bit drunk already, though he didn’t have a drink in hand; eyes slightly glazed, mouth hanging open. Draco wished he could say that was a dumb look on him, but who was he kidding? Potter looked unfairly fit even in his most unflattering moments. Draco had spent enough time typing the words ‘Harry Potter shirtless’ in the search bar of the Witch ’n’ Wizarding Web to be acutely aware of that.
He jumped. Harry was around the corner of the Entrance Hall. His face was pale, his glasses slightly fogged in the cold air. Behind them, his eyes were round and wide as though he didn’t expect Draco to show up. The wind coming from the open doorway to the outside ruffled Harry's hair and he ground his teeth, folding his arms around himself.
“Er, thanks, Luna,” Harry muttered. He slid Draco a look. When Draco met his gaze, he swiftly looked away.
such as Scorpius,’” she explains. “Ernestina cried and cried, but she did not show it to Mistor Draco, no. But Mistor Draco knew anyway. He told Ernestina, he did not want another nanny for
Bristling, Jeff took a step back. “This ring, youngling, is no ordinary ring. It’s made of goblin silver, and the centre stone is said to have belonged to no other than the great Merlin. It’s a treasure, a real treasure, wasting away as a vulgar family heirloom and even more so on the finger of a underling demon like you. It would be the crowning glory to my collection of rare and precious jewelry, and,” he started stamping his foot, “
Harry walks towards the bed. On the bedside table, there’s a plastic lamp shaped like a treble clef, a heavy book about classical music, and a framed wizarding photograph. Harry lifts the frame from the table to examine it. The photograph shows Malfoy, a few years younger, standing next to a woman the same age. She’s got shiny, dark blond hair, a round, pretty face, and doe-like brown eyes; she’s also clearly very pregnant — seven, eight months in.
Harry grinned when he saw Draco fly up to him, his black hair whipping in the cold wind. In his Quidditch gear, all leather shin guards and Gryffindor shirt and winter cloak billowing behind him, he was so unfairly attractive it made Draco ache. Merlin, how could he have let it happen? How could he have allowed himself to want Harry so much? Could he have picked a better specimen for his unrequited star-crossed crush?
“Honestly, anyone with the slightest common sense would take time off after Hogwarts,” Hermione said, taking a sip of her tea.
Harry turns around. The Minister is standing in his office doorway, tall and wide-shouldered and formidable-looking. He hasn’t changed much in all the years Harry’s known him. Except for the deep creases across his forehead and between his brows, Kingsley looks just as youthful, authoritative, and charismatic as he’s always done. The one time Harry had brought it up with him, the Minister had just laughed. “Thank you, Harry,” he’d said, “but you should know that’s how people describe you, not me.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Harry laughed, too, and the pain in Draco’s chest started receding. “Keep it to yourself, or she’ll turn us both into toads if she finds out.”
They’re both quiet for a while. Harry’s silence is the busy kind, unpacking the tin foil, setting forks and glasses on the table, rummaging in cupboards for a bottle of wine that will pass the approval of Malfoy’s no doubt poshly sensitive palate. Malfoy’s silence is tense as he waves his wand at his shoulder in a clumsy left-handed gesture, pointedly not looking at Harry.
“What’s in it for you, Harry?” Draco asks. Harry is reminded of their first meeting, months ago. It felt like a different life, yet it all suddenly makes sense. The wariness. The suspicion. The questions.
Draco only leaves the Ministry when the Aurors give him his wand back and when he’s made sure Ernestina was released. “She went home an hour ago,” the DMLE assistant on duty assures him. That’s all the information Draco manages to get. The Aurors won’t tell him if she’d received proper medical care upon her arrival at the DMLE. He tries to think rationally about it, about the fact that Ernestina was brutalised in her own home, under a roof Draco’d sworn she would always be safe. About the fact that it’s common practice for the Aurors and they probably won’t be blamed for it.
crush? He’d thought he'd kept it so perfectly under wraps. Yes, he might have been a little obvious about it when he was fourteen, but since then, he’d done a brilliant job at hiding it. There was the time when Parvati had found the stack of Harry Potter-themed newspaper clippings and Witch Weekly covers hidden in Draco’s desk drawer but he’d thought he’d been most convincing at explaining it away
He just stands here, shoulder to shoulder with Draco, disoriented. Another round of flashes, and Harry shakes himself, panicked. He impulsively pushes Draco away from him, charges the journalists, hoping to make a quick, easy exit, while the journos bleat at him:
“Draco,” she growls. “You’re the only one having brilliant fun on the weekends these days.” She’s deeply involved in her task of taking various objects out of a box sitting on her desk; an old combat boot, a toy Firebolt (vintage, 1986 edition, Draco remembers it from his birthday that year), a tube of lipstick missing its cap, an autographed picture of a young Gilderoy Lockhart putting a stake through a vampire’s chest with a bright grin on his face. When she taps the items with her wand, they turn into pieces of parchment; certified Ministry forms that fly to meet their predecessors on Lavender Brown’s desk.
Malfoy — and god knows what the blond git has been up to since the war and the trials. Since narrowly escaping a sentence in Azkaban.
The same enchanted reindeer ornaments he’d seen in the Library were grazing on her desk, giving off a warm glow. The reindeer must have been McGonagall’s idea, then. Draco relaxed infinitesimally.
In three steps, he’s by Harry’s bed, one knee on the mattress, reaching for Harry's t-shirt. He grabs a fistful of it and pulls Harry in. They meet halfway, lips crashing, heat surging between them. For a brief moment, they’re half kissing, half wrestling, Malfoy’s hands running down Harry’s back, Harry’s hands threading in Malfoy’s hair, and no space to break for air. With a tug on Malfoy’s collar, Harry pulls him down with him, collapsing on the bed. They let go for a beat, panting. Harry can’t stop his hips from pushing up against Malfoy. With a desperate groan, he reaches up and kisses him again. When they break for air, Malfoy looks down at him with a frown. “Merlin, the things I want to do to you…” he growls. “How can you pretend you have no clue what you’re doing?” And then he dives into another searing kiss.
There’s a stunned pause, during which Harry can practically hear the gears switching in his friends’ brains. Hermione sits very still, anxiety rolling off her. Ron leans back, a shade paler, his freckles stark against his white skin.
Upstairs, in the foyer, Ernestina stands next to a small, blond child. The boy is holding a plastic toy against his chest, some sort of dragon — a Norwegian Ridgeback, Harry thinks — and his eyes are fixed on it. Balzac is curled at his feet, tail swishing on the marble floor. Malfoy’s house-elf gazes at the boy, then at Malfoy, with a proud look on her face.
“You watch out, Malfoy,” Ron said, watching his girlfriend with a fond expression. “Next thing you know, she’ll be your next Minister for Magic.”
Draco took a sip of his pumpkin juice to avoid everyone’s eyes. Hermione Granger had the name of a Greek goddess and the will of a Roman general. He was as admirative of her as he was scared of her. Sometimes, he could swear he still felt the sting of the slap she’d given him in third year. He never wanted to be on the wrong side of her anger again.
want to think about him, it’d be impossible not to. And it’s not as if Draco’s ever been any good at refusing himself thoughts of Potter.
“Well, here’s the thing, Malfoy.” Harry met his eye. His were simmering with anger, and something pained and weary that Draco couldn’t place. “You’re right when you say this isn’t about you. This is, however, about
From the corner of his eye, Harry caught the way Malfoy’s ears pinked at Smith’s unwitting implication.
Harry sucks him, standing on all fours above Draco’s spread legs, arse in the air. Draco desperately wants to touch him, yet all he seems to be able to do is pull Harry’s hair tighter, listen to Harry’s soft moans reverberate through his body. Harry sucks him so good, and Draco forgets about his misgivings, fights not to push deeper into Harry’s mouth, so hot and soft. He slides his hands down Harry's neck, rests his palms each side of Harry's face, feeling his own cock bump inside Harry's cheek. His orgasm catches him unawares, steals his breath, too fast. He feels it happen a split second before he can warn Harry, and then he comes. And comes... It’s a long moment, suspended in time, where all he can think of is white-out bliss. Then his arched back falls against the sofa cushions, his pulsing cock still in Harry’s mouth, his hips pushing up in a few last exquisite thrusts.
“I’d love to believe you, but I’m not sure it’s true. You like being with people, Harry. Companionship would… do you good.” Before Harry can object, she lifts her hand. “Besides, this place is full of unexpected meetings! I’m not the only one who’s run into interesting people.”
to be noticed, to be stared at, for his looks to be commented upon. What with his outfits, each tighter and more revealing than the next. What with his hair, its colour so unique, all soft-looking strands falling in his eyes. What with his rings, and his impeccably polished nails, and that rainbow badge always pinned to his shirt or jacket. What with his trademark drawl, more languid than it had sounded at Hogwarts. Silky. His posture, back straight, chin held high, narrow hips swaying lightly when he walks, as if to say
Malfoy looks confident, healthy, and rested. Not at all how Harry pictured him. He expected Malfoy to look more like… the founder of a business empire. A widower. The single father of a seven-year-old child.
“I like it,” Harry told him in the same playful tone. “I hoped to see you, too.” His voice dropped. “I missed you,” he added, cheeks pinking attractively.
“I didn’t say a word,” Malfoy said, lifting his hands. His smirk was saying otherwise. Still, he stopped staring and started looking around for his clothes, passing Harry bits of his uniform whenever he found them on the floor. Cheeks flaming, Harry took the opportunity to clean himself up while Malfoy had his back turned.
felt pretty good, let me tell you. Along with the knowledge I was desecrating the birthplace of half of my nightmares.
“Didn’t have the chance...last time,” Draco confessed, his breath hot against Harry’s bare skin. He felt Harry tremble under his palms. “Can I—kiss you?”
Scorpius eventually looks up from his intense duck-watching and frowns when he sees his dad laughing with Harry. As the boy walks over to them, followed by his dog, Draco’s heart leaps when he catches Harry’s expression, a warm, almost fond smile playing on the corner of his mouth.
“I bet you ten Galleons they’re talking about us,” Harry said. From where he was sitting on the rug, the nearby fire cast dark shadows over his bright green eyes and wicked smile. He looked like a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped.
“Thank you, Luna,” Hermione said. She gave Ginny a stern look. “Eighth Year classes end before lunch on Friday, Ginny. It’s not
“You’re not.” Draco's voice was humiliatingly raspy. He wished he could look cooler, more in control, but there had always been something about Harry Potter that made him lose his composure. Him being
He saw Ginny glance at him questioningly a few feet away. He was shushing a talking Niffler, it was only natural—
Harry leaned back. “You're awfully concerned about this. You know we can take time to figure things out, even change our minds as we go along, right? Nothing is going to actually happen to us if we don’t pick one professional path now and stick to it forever.”
His groin was flush with Malfoy’s arse now, his cock plunged to the hilt. He pulled back slowly, drawing a string of moans and profanities from Malfoy’s gorgeous mouth, then slammed himself in again. He took Malfoy’s hips in both hands and started fucking him in earnest, eyes on the outline of Malfoy’s long hands splayed against the tiles.
— a bunch of names that only make Harry fuck him harder. Harry tightens his hand around Malfoy’s cock and listens as Malfoy’s whimpers of pleasure grow louder, louder… until Malfoy’s body freezes in his arms, his hand, and he comes, cock pulsing in Harry’s fist, slicking it with heat.
Scorpius’ hands stop abruptly on the keys. His eyebrows still drawn, his eyes still fixed on the keyboard. He taps his fingers to the keys, a soundless
Half past eleven, three days after St Mungo’s, was the time slot Jemima has suggested per Draco’s request, based on his work schedule and Scorpius’ recovering sleep cycles. It was supposed to give Draco enough time to go on his morning run, give him one last opportunity to work out his feelings before meeting with Harry again.
— Ron’s words, not Harry’s — but that’s ridiculous. Harry’s learned his lesson, and Malfoy is nothing to
“I… I never had the space or opportunity to truly think about it. My aunt and uncle’s favourite pastime was to remind me how useless I was and how poorly adjusted I’d come out. Then I joined Hogwarts, and I was too busy thwarting a madman who wanted to kill me. My career,” he continues with a sigh, “was the last thing on my mind.”
“Hope my arse was worth the ten-year wait,“ Malfoy laughed haltingly. In the dark, with only their voices echoing against the showers’ tiles and the overwhelming feel of their bodies thrusting against each other, the space felt disorienting, cavernous. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hip in one hand, slipped the other between Malfoy’s thighs, cupping his heavy balls and his hard cock. Malfoy let out a needy whine and pushed back against Harry. “I take that as a yes.”
“Hello Mummy,” I tell her. (She can't hear me.) (Of course, it's a photograph.) (Daddy says it doesn't matter. That I should say hello to her anyway. Only if I want to.) (That she’s proud of me.)
The thing is, I never go to the theatre. You see, I didn’t exactly grow up in a household of art lovers. My aunt and uncle probably filed performing arts under the ‘bloody useless waste of time and common sense’ category (perhaps with the exception of tired soap operas, in my aunt’s case), same as they felt for abstract paintings, installation art, and flash mobs.
“Help me get out of the assignment,” Draco interrupted, his slow, measured words carefully masking the thunderous beat of his blood inside him. “Show me how to get out of the assignment, and I’ll give you this invaluable ring.”
he thought glumly as the last conga line dancers shimmied past him. Across the Hall, the drinks side of the buffet beckoned him.
is important.” Andromeda lifted Teddy off Draco’s lap, cradling him in her arms. “You can go. I’m going to put my grandson to bed now. Goodnight, boys.”
The rain is falling harder and Draco is already yards ahead when Harry breaks into a run. Draco is a faster runner, but Harry’s determined to catch up with him, spurred by the need to see his face. To touch him. To say…
Inside, the house is quiet; all lights are out. Harry checks the dining room first. The table hasn’t been cleared. It’s still covered in chocolate-smeared dessert plates, half-empty cups of tea, unfolded napkins. The whole room has a forlorn air, something that resonates painfully inside Harry’s chest. He goes down to the kitchen, sticks his head in the wine cellar. He goes back to the dark, empty foyer. He climbs the stairs as quietly as he can. Ernestina’s door is closed. He feels the motion-sensing wards around Scorpius’ bedroom as he passes it on the landing — no light in there, either. It’s only when he’s about to reach the second floor that he sees the sliver of light escaping from inside Draco’s bedroom.
“Most house-elves in England are owned, sir,” she explains with a sigh. “But not where Ernestina comes from, no. Ernestina is an employee of Mistor Draco, sir, just like Mistor Potter.”
“Yes,” Draco says, running the flat of his palm down Harry’s back. His skin is still damp, shivering in the wake of Draco’s touch.
Blaise and Ginny had booked a large cottage for their engagement party weekend. All their friends had slept over, including him and Harry. Although, perhaps, they had slept slightly less than the others.
“No, Harry. You’re not laughable. You’re not ridiculous. I can’t say I understand, but then again… you look very much infatuated. And believe it or not, I trust you not to fall in love with a complete arse.”
It was all the indication Harry needed, because a second later, he was grabbing Draco by the collar of his shirt and pushing him up against the countertop lining the side of Luna’s kitchen.
“So you steal from them… why? Because they won’t notice a few missing bank notes in their wallets? Or out of petty revenge?”
“I’m only allowed to when Scorpius is out of hearing distance, which he is,” Draco tells him, and there must be something in his voice that makes Harry turn to him with a soft look in his eyes. Draco shifts his eyes away, clearing his throat. “My point is, I may have been a clever child, but I was also easily influenced, terribly close-minded, and a bully to boot. Sometimes… sometimes I think about the child I was. What I would have done to a child like Scorpius, if there’d been one like him at Hogwarts.  And now I’m never allowed to forget about it.”
Hands on his hips, Draco hung his head. “Okay. So it’s not that you don’t think I’m worthy of interviewing you?”
my house. That’s how we met. Anyway, she’s a huge theatre nerd. She studied theatre at uni, and she’s a bit obsessed. So her birthday was coming up, and I asked her if I could take her to a play of her choice for the occasion, and she said yes, that she’d very much like to go and see
Harry’s smile broadens with the blush creeping up Malfoy’s cheeks. “Did you just pay me a compliment, Malfoy?”
Next to him, Harry was a shade paler. Yet when he swiftly met Draco’s eyes before turning back to the Headmistress, he simply nodded.
Draco does. Then he and Harry set to work, taking boxes from the shelves, opening them with mild Diffindos, peering inside to check at the contents. It’s diligent, methodical work, and the cupboard is quiet save for the occasional words they exchange, voices low, the rummaging of hands in boxes of parchment clips and inkwells, and their muffled giggles when one thinks he’s found the box and brandishes it under the other’s nose only to realise it wasn’t the right one to begin with. At first, Harry doesn’t notice how slowly he works. He remembers helping George Weasley to store boxes in the back of his jokes shop, a few months after the war — the way they moved through the storage room, crossing each other’s paths and laughing, the bracing, fast and steady physical work lifting their spirits — and this feels nothing like it. Harry’s never been as aware of his own movements as he is now — slow and deliberate, calibrating each motion so that it looks natural, casual, like he couldn’t be less bothered by Draco standing feet away from him in the soft light of a Lumos. He’s aware of every inch of space Draco’s body takes up. He’s aware of the shape of it, lean and solid and real. He’s aware that he should probably put more space between them. He can hear a weird sort of thrumming in the back of his skull. The air of the cupboard is saturated with tense silence, and Harry can’t tell if he’s imagining it, or if Draco can feel it, too.
Draco is watching him, guarded but expectant, waiting for Harry to speak again. So Harry smiles at him, a wry, encouraging little thing.
“You have a point, Potter,” he says. His eyes crinkle for a second, before his expression turns completely serious once more. “Most people hate me.” He lifts a hand when Harry opens his mouth to interrupt — to protest. “They
“That’s where you’re wrong. I don’t want to risk drawing attention to me — and I don’t just mean the Aurors’ attention. Cavendish isn’t any Muggle. Just like the witches and wizards I prefer to steal from aren’t
“You like me, I like you. Why do we need to make such a big deal out of it? Have you not been with a man before—
It made it easier to understand how Voldemort had come to power when so many people, like Draco, only knew about their own little world and their immediate interests.
“Yes…” Harry says. He lowers his eyes. The Mediwitch tied his arm so close to his chest… “... and no.”
The moment seems to stretch and stretch, but in reality must not last for longer than a few seconds. Malfoy is studying Harry just as intently, an almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips.
“Hey, I read the memos you send to Kingsley every week," Ron says. "It looks like Malfoy is either clean or much better at hiding criminal activity than anyone has any right to be. You could close the case tomorrow if you wanted.”
Now that I’m an adult, I have no excuse not to do as I please, and perhaps going to the theatre would be one of those things I’d be into if only I had gotten into the habit at a younger age. As it is, it’s not something I ever think about. I never think about going to see a play as an option for a fun night out. I never even know what’s playing at the West End.
Harry has seen him shirtless. He knows what’s under Draco’s clothes: the scars, the Mark. It shouldn’t matter. And yet Draco wants to hide. He doesn’t feel defiant like he did that first time he let Harry see his chest; he feels freakish, unattractive. He wishes he could keep his clothes on just for that, and he feels his breathing come faster and laboured, his eyes screwed shut, his senses shutting down. Just the sensation of
At the age of twenty-four, he had married a certain Astoria Greengrass, a witch a couple of years his junior whom he had met while they both lived in Paris. The young couple had moved to London two years later, when Malfoy was starting his company and Astoria was six months pregnant with their first child. They’d moved to a mainly Muggle neighbourhood, in the Sloane Square townhouse that Harry had seen in the pictures that the Minister had showed him.
“But you do so much more!” Hermione sits straighter, an earnestness on her face that reminded Harry of her most determined library moments at Hogwarts. “Before
“A Niffler,” came Luna’s dreamy voice from behind them. “They’re such fantastic creatures, Draco. Do you know they have Nanticoot-repelling powers?”
his roommates would joke.) Anthony Goldstein was curled under his usual three blankets and five Warming Charms because he was always cold
“What a wuss,” Harry nosed at his ear. “Fine. What is your plan, then? It’s morning outside. The storm has passed.”
“Do you want to talk through it, then? I thought writing down everything that appeals to us for a career might be a good start. It should give us a good basis for personality tests and discussion.”
Draco had leaned in and kissed Harry some more. “So who’d have known you were such a massive sap, Harry Potter?”
With a miniature, cross-breed, chicken-blood-and-brandy-drinking, jewellery-stealing, baby dragon named Tamara.
They all file back inside the study, and after shaking Harry’s hand and patting his back and assuring him Draco will get his knickers untwisted eventually, Blaise and Pansy leave through the front door.
Harry leaned closer, his chin almost resting on Draco's shoulder. He smelled of soap, firewood and warm wool; achingly ordinary. This boy, the first person who's ever made Draco
Draco Malfoy was exactly as Harry remembered him. The same tall, slim frame. The same attention to detail in the perfect cut of his shirt and trousers. The same artless elegance in his movements.
“I like it.” Harry turned his head to look at the fire. “I never thought I’d live long enough to have a boyfriend, let alone introduce him to the people that matter to me.”
Soon he was under the cover of dark trees. Above him, the naked branches framed the starry night sky, stark and ominous like bad omens. He breathed again. No one in their right mind would follow him into the Forbidden Forest—except perhaps Hagrid if he spotted Draco out on the grounds past curfew. But the light in his cabin was on: Hagrid hadn’t gone out for an unplanned evening patrol.
“Thank you, darling,” Pansy murmured, her black eyes briefly meeting Draco's. “You were right. It is cold.”
Ron and Hermione are next, and Ernestina gets the door before Harry can get there. Harry’s friends greet the house-elf politely while she takes Ron’s jacket and Hermione’s cardigan. They both have their noses up in the air, taking in the beautiful foyer and the majestic grand staircase. Ron whistles softly.
“You nearly killed me in sixth year,” Malfoy averts his eyes and murmurs, as if hoping Harry won’t hear him.
“I did some thinking of my own,” Draco said. He picked a piece of napkin between thumb and forefinger and pulled. The paper tore with a satisfying ripping sound. “You know, when I was working on the personality and career tests with Harry. The same results kept coming up, test after test: the same answers, so obvious I barely had time to finish my spells that it already jumped out of the page. This constant appeal of words, of details, of creative thinking. I’m not sure what I’m going to write about. Still, I
Most people tittered and Ron Weasley put his arm around his girlfriend’s shoulder, kissing her cheek. “No one would ever dare accuse you of bunking off, ‘Mione.”
Harry threw Draco a look over his shoulder. “Of course it bloody well would be. The crowning jewel of your career, really.” He turned towards Draco and set his teacup on the wooden countertop. He leaned on his elbows and peered into Draco’s eyes for a long moment.
from their pots, colonizing the carpet, taking root in upturned bags of dark soil. Creepers climbed on walls, over the bow windows and around beams; grass grew under armchairs. There even was a bloody palm tree whose large yellow leaves hid a nest of hard-shelled fruit, dark and downy like coconuts.
Harry swallowed and nodded. His breaths were already quicker, his face pinched with the effort of keeping still when Draco was so close.
Scorpius. That he was trusting Ernestina to be a good nanny for Scorpius. And Ernestina is, Mistor Potter,” she adds, nodding vehemently, “Ernestina is!”
Firstly, that was ludicrous. Sure, Potter had left the place all flustered last week, but that doesn't mean anything. A room full of giggling women could unsettle even the most stoical man. Secondly… how had they found out about his crush on Potter? His very,
“Maybe Honeydukes...” Harry mused. He scratched his head with a gloved hand. “I really don’t know what to get Molly. Or Arthur. Or George.” He fell quiet. “Merlin. This is going to be the worst Christmas.”
Malfoy,” he breathed, feeling Malfoy’s finger circle his rim, then breach his hole with one knuckle. “Oh, fuck, you impossible prat, you just
Without answering Harry, Scorpius turns on his heels and heads towards the corridor on the right. Balzac leaps to his feet and runs after him with a soft whine.
His gaze followed Harry on the rink, his winter cloak billowing behind him as he effortlessly sprinted Dean Thomas across the ice. Weasley, Granger and Finnigan were cheering and skating along. They all looked like normal teenagers enjoying an afternoon off school, their faces flushed and unworried as though none of them had lived through loss and destruction. Envy burned in Draco’s throat. It would never be like this for him, would it? He would never have this easy camaraderie, this uncomplicated bond with Harry. Easy and uncomplicated simply wasn’t Draco’s style.
away with a contrite shudder, Harry finishes his inspection with the bathroom. Nothing out of the ordinary there either, except the counters and floors are white marble instead of tiles.
“Hullo, Draco,” Luna smiled slowly. “I knew this day would come. We never got to properly say goodbye when I left the Manor, did we? You were good to me, during that time. To Mr Ollivander, too.”
“You’re fifteen years too late.” Draco gives his head a dismissive shake, water dripping from his hair. “Apologising. Being my friend.”
There’s silence for a long while, then he hears Ron shift where he sits. He asks in a careful voice: “You like him, like… you would a good friend? …or…”
Malfoy pushes up on his hands, turning his head to look at Harry over his shoulder. His face is pink and sweaty and ecstatic. He’s moving in time with Harry now, thrust for thrust, skin slapping on skin, little whines of pleasure escaping from his slack mouth. Someone’s grunting and moaning, too — a wanton, abandoned sound that Harry realises is coming from him.
Until Malfoy barged in Harry’s life again, and upset everything Harry thought he knew about himself.
“Where you are merely average, Potter, I excel,” Draco told him, his amused half-smile cancelling the haughty lift of his chin.
Draco cut him off with an open-mouthed kiss, lips closing around the darkening cotton, licking the saltiness into his mouth. Harry’s hand fell in his hair and Draco pulled back.
I want to thank everyone who's read and commented so far (as well as screamed at me for breaking your hearts, lolol). I appreciate every one of you and reading your thoughts and reactions is the best part of my day!
“They told me about the series of articles. I read the ones you’ve published so far. I really liked them. When they said
“More like the knob-heads kind,” Ginny muttered. Everyone around the table nodded except Draco. He tore another piece of his napkin. This clearly was another Harry Potter mystery he’d been left out of by years of bad blood. Context clues suggested Christmas might not be the best time to ask about it.
“Yes,” Harry moaned when he felt the tip of a third finger press into him, almost mindless with need. “Almost ready, Merlin I want you, I don’t think I can wait much longer—”
sorry.” She looks more apologetic than Harry’s ever seen her — and that includes her apologising for trying to give him over Voldemort. “I feel like I ruined it.”
Draco spotted something. “Darling. Much as I hate to interrupt your search for this animal, there appears to be smoke coming from my slippers!”
Neither Draco nor Scorpius seem to be awake when Harry walks down the stairs, barefoot and dressed in clean jeans and a soft grey t-shirt. The house is quiet, the soft hush of early morning only disturbed by the chirping of blue tits in the garden and the distant clanks of pots and pans in the kitchen — Ernestina getting breakfast ready, no doubt. On the landing of the first floor, Balzac limps out of Scorpius’ room to meet him, tail wagging.
“What the Heavens are you doing here?!” Draco hissed, horrified to be found in this position by Mephisto’s pet. He patted the covers for his wand and hastily cast a few Silencing charms around his bed.
—above-the-fold stories about Malfoy and a potions company called Caduceus. Malfoy looks slightly severe and threatening in the photographs, which Harry assumes were all chosen to enhance the content of the articles, full of mixed feelings and covert innuendos about Malfoy's success. That haughty scowl is a good look on him, though, Harry can’t help but think. Malfoy even made the cover of last year’s
In the quiet early morning stillness of the Muggle street, the knock on Luna Lovegood’s door resounded like a hammer putting the final nails in a coffin. Draco’s shaky exhalation formed white clouds in the cold air. He squeezed his hands under his arms, the leather satchel containing his notebook and Self-Inking Quick-Quotes Quill safely tucked against his chest. Come to think of it, the wizarding cloak draped across his shoulders was probably a bit conspicuous. He should have Transfigured it into something more suitable for the area—a wool peacoat, perhaps, or one of those puffy down jackets that seemed in fashion among Muggles these days. He shifted his weight from one leg to the other, wondering how out of place he must seem to potential onlookers.
The shower Harry takes does nothing to remove the nagging presence of Draco in his mind — images of him, exquisitely dishevelled, eyes rolling back as he rode Harry’s cock in a slow, teasing rhythm; his long fingers smearing his own come across his lean, scarred belly. Harry considers having a wank right then and there, but in the end cuts that train of thought short with a spray of freezing water and a quick shaving charm to his face.
“Mistor Potter should have breakfast upstairs with us, sir,” Ernestina says, turning unblinking brown eyes towards him.
“I was wondering if you could introduce me. In a professional manner. For a… work collaboration.” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, she explains. “The work he’s doing with Caduceus is truly groundbreaking. He’s really changing the way the wizarding world is approaching science and medicine. I’d like to offer him to work with me on a project.”
Malfoy tugs at his wrist, still enclosed in Harry’s hand. “I had to. If I’d stayed, I would have… compromised.”
A wonderfully debauched-looking Draco appears on the threshold, his jaw dropping and his face turning two shades pinker. If Harry had any hope of hiding what they’d been up to the night before, the sight of Draco with messy hair, rumpled t-shirt and jeans and his chin almost scratched raw from stubble burn sends it flying through the window.
He taps on Draco’s arm when he finally reaches him. Draco whirls around instantly, as if he’d been expecting Harry to do exactly that. He gives his shoulder a sharp jerk, away from Harry’s touch. They’ve stopped running. They’re facing each other, panting. Rain plasters Draco’s hair to his head, his fringe to his forehead, droplets of water running down his long nose. His eyes are no longer cold — they’re blazing, furious, and the thought crosses Harry’s mind that maybe he should have let this one slide. He distantly registers that he’s getting cold and wet, too. Yet he’s burning up, lungs and legs and heart on fire. And Draco is just staring daggers at him, and he won’t be the first to speak. For all the stunned anguish Harry’s feeling, he’s glad that Draco’s reacting with anger and not his usual distant coolness.
Regretfully. I mean, we were friendly acquaintances for years, but...I didn't quite know how to approach you. See, I had the biggest, most embarrassing crush on you.
“I was hoping it would be the other way around,” Harry said. “Either way, you’ll have to get rid of these boxers,” he added, eyes fixed on the impressive tenting of Malfoy’s pants.
Malfoy had accepted, much to his astonishment. Thank god Harry was wearing his shirt untucked. If he pulled it down a bit, nobody would notice the erection that threatened to pop the buttons of his jeans open.
Malfoy’s voice wavers slightly and he swallows, brow creasing. “Have you never been with a man… before me?”
Harry takes his lips off the collar he’s been unbuttoning, and looks up at Draco with a half-smile. Draco is already pink, lips red and gleaming from Harry’s kisses, his breath shallow and fast. He looks utterly debauched just from kissing, and Harry wants to push him harder, bring Draco’s pale complexion and haughty expression to new heights of ‘I've been so thoroughly fucked I can barely move.’
Draco had never encountered a Nanticoot in any of his lives, nor had he ever heard of the term. However, when in doubt, it was always best not to ask too many questions with Luna.
“If you’re worried about me mocking your Muggle tastes, you’re sadly mistaken, Potter,” he said haughtily. “I’m a changed person, if you haven’t noticed.”
Harry—do you even realise how long I—?” He threw his hands up in defeat. “You know what? This isn't the time or place to sort this out. I've work to do; now, if you'll excuse me.”
read exclusive interviews of Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood, Blaise Zabini, Fleur Delacour or George Weasley?
“Will you show me the rest of the house? If I’m going to be living here… and I’m protecting you… it makes sense to know the place.”
Draco. You had me so worried you had some sort of skeleton in the wardrobe. I can't believe you have to hide this. You’ve kept this a secret for years. ”
That routine, or at least Harry’s role in it, might end soon. He feels a wave of nausea at the very thought.
Just when he’s about to start fidgeting again, a door he hadn’t noticed opens behind him, and he hears someone pronounce his name.
“Studying. Or charging blindly into the future,” Draco sighed. “I guess I’ll take the former, and you’ll take the latter, as usual.”
Harry doesn’t say anything for a while. Draco watches Scorpius, crouched along the bank as ducks come and go on the water. He’s pointing at one of the ducks, the more daring one that paddled close to the bank, and he’s pulling Balzac’s collar to show him. Blond curls escape his bobble hat, Draco’s Hogwarts green and silver Slytherin scarf wrapped so many times around his neck he can barely move his head. Draco never wears this scarf anymore, but it’s become Scorpius’s favourite ever since he saw it hanging from the coat-peg in Draco’s room and Draco explained to him what the scarf meant. He doubts Scorpius will sort Slytherin if he ever goes to Hogwarts, and it’s okay. Draco’s House pride only applies to himself.
“I have no feelings, good or bad, about working for you,” Harry says, and he knows he sounds convincing by the way Malfoy’s eyes stay fixed on his, guarded but sincere. “As I said, this is what I do. Personal security.”
“Harry…” Draco murmurs, not knowing what else to say, as Harry lifts up on his knees, kisses his neck, licks into the dip above his collarbones as he unbuttons Draco's shirt. Harry’s fingers trace light lines along the patches of naked skin that he reveals with each button he undoes, sliding against the light hair scattered on Draco’s chest, catching on his nipples, on the ropey ridges of his scars. Draco whimpers, sinks his teeth into his bottom lip. Harry’s touch is lighting him on fire. It’s good — so good. And it shouldn’t be. Merlin, it shouldn’t be. Nobody has ever touched him there — touched him this way. His scars were still healing when he laid naked in Pansy’s and Blaise’s bed, all those years ago, and just brushing against them hurt. Astoria had loved him so much, but somehow she’d never managed to fall in love with that particular disfigurement of his.
“Mistor, Ernestina tries to break away! Auror threatens to get to Scorpius! Ernestina can’t! Won’t! Let it happen!”
“This better improve my team’s morale,” she mutters as he passes by her, “or you owe me one hour of overtime for this spiel.”
“Of course,” Harry said, looking up as Draco slid in the seat next to him. The atmosphere in Slughorn’s classroom was already stuffy and overheated. The air smelled of candied fruit and hot chocolate. It wasn’t a bad smell in itself—it’s just that it fit Madam Puddifoot’s tea parlor better than it did a Potions classroom. Draco located the source of the smell after one quick scan of the room: small cups of steaming hot chocolate, two on each table, were waiting for them. Inside, marshmallows charmed to look like snowmen floated on the dark liquid. All that was missing to turn the room into a Hufflepuff winter wonderland was merry carols chiming in the background. The empty portrait on the wall behind Slughorn’s desk was proof enough: Severus Snape disapproved so much he refused to visit his own portrait, likely preferring to dwell in the one hanging in McGonagall’s office.
This time, he’s nervous for entirely different reasons. The first time he was here, he’d half expected Draco to turn him down — to bring him in for an interview as a joke, then send him away laughing — and secretly he’d hoped it would be the case.
