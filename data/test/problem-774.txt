“What’s he even doing here? You said he’s from work and all but—” Ron cut off with a furrowed brow. His parents looked at each other in silent conversation.
“Magic.” Roody sat down next to him. “You see, the British government and magical parliament are joint. Child services extend as well. Usually it’s not muggles but abandoned muggle-borns who get brought into the magical world, but you have someone who wants you, don’t you?” He smiled.
Walburga scoffed, “My grandson. unless you are Bellatrix’s child you are not my grandson. Be gone putrid child.” She batted the air beside her.
“Stay here!”
“What makes you think I don’t want both!”
“-useless and went and died. Leaving their bastard with us. We take him into our home out of generosity and he has the gall- “Harry tuned out the familiar complaints.
“But what if this doesn’t save people? What if it just steals the lives of those others that would have simply survived like anyone else?” He asked sadly. “It did not used to be so difficult Gellert. Things have become complex and we fight like the knights of the founding. What will heads on pikes do? Make them fear us again? Burn us at the stake? Before or after they bomb the other nations? The ministry calls for secrecy more than ever, perhaps we should consider the benefits of separating ourselves more.”
“We didn’t need you to do that.” Lucius hissed.
“You are the strangest creature I’ve ever met.” He stated bluntly. When the boys open expression flashed with more despair Draco felt frigid. “You shouldn’t broadcast weakness or others will pray on you.” He added and regained the sight of those tired gems looking back at him in wonder.
The one closest, he gained eye contact with, hissed a bit before giving up and ignoring him. “Don’t be like that.” He smiled.
“On my mark!” Moody yelled and Harry pulled the snap bracelet out from his sleeved wrist to straighten it out. The crushed velvet zebra pattern was getting popular lately. “Turn!”
“Honestly the only reason for a nubbin like them is they can squeeze in tight spaces, but yours is all grown now mostly, shame really. Having a little one for recon could have been good.”
“Come in. I’ll make you some tea. Would Nagini want anything, mice?”
Draco didn’t talk about what he saw. Not yet. Harry didn’t push when his lover dragged him to the bed instead and started stripping the both of them. He let himself be thrown under the blankets and a warm body crawled in after to lay flush against him as much as possible.
An old man with chapped and painful looking lips walked in a moment later. He smiled as best he could and Sirius started talking with him. The man was quick to take Harry’s chin in hand to gaze like a Seer into his eyes. His tired gaze would have alarmed Draco from where he watched had the man not seemed like be speaking softly about a prescription, he knew what he was doing, knew it so well he hadn’t needed a single medical spell to check.
“No! I will never send you away!” Sirius was losing it just as much as he was now, gripping Harry a bit too tight and Remus quickly pulled him off before he could add his own panic attack to the list.
“What do you think you’re—” Sirius was just about to make the elf leave, but Harry stopped him as he turned his full attention to the being.
Harry high fived Fred and George after he was declared the winner against Ron who looked utterly betrayed. He had overshot the dueling table by a few feet and got caught by an upperclassman. The popper Harry had used against Bellatrix had been fixed a lot after several test dummies made of watermelons had sacrificed their lives. It was still a bit strong for practice, but would do the trick of safely getting someone away from him in a fight without causing harm. Moody was laughing in delight with every bit of breath and sound he had.
Harry gave a small smile despite his nerves. “Will they like me? Your relatives. Are they nice like you?”
Get your Yugioh cards ready because its time to Duel!
“Yes.” Draco hummed as he reached out his own hands that had been forgotten to start reciprocation the curious fumbling.
Draco had given Dobby a soft sweater and a pair of shorts the young house elf had cried into as he explained it was to nullify his contract to the Malfoy house. Despite not being the lord of the manor, he was still by all counts one of the affiliated owners of the house elf. With that Dobby was a free elf, Brownie, Harry wasn’t too sure which name was more appropriate honestly. That didn’t seem to deter Dobby however when he was asked to stay if he wanted, then the crying started all over again. Harry had asked if Kreacher wanted any clothes as well and had been chewed out for his effort. He settled for making them all cookies.
A high pitch that sounded like the monster in pain accompanied the rest of his body fully hitting the ground. He had lots of practice at this next part, he dragged himself up and took off running. Blindly leaping over anything in his way, surrounded by sound that could have been countless other creatures like the one he escaped following him now, he had no idea what direction he was going. His only hope was to find a wall to orientate himself and work his way around to the door again. The next problem on the list was that he wasn’t hitting one.
“I’m saying he’s heavily abused and needs new guardians.” Draco argued loudly.
“She took my soul.” He smiled sadly. “She said that if she couldn’t have me, she’d make sure I’d watch Albus die and never reunite with him in death myself. Without my soul I cannot complete the process of my mind and soul moving on and so both persist.”
“do you want to go somewhere the Hogsmeade before break? Just us?” Draco uttered quietly from Harry’s side.
We are reaching the final fight.
“You think it’s like with Lucius?” He asked softly and cringed when it still elicited a flinch from Draco. “Sorry.”
“Alright, but just tell us, when do we get to… you know?” The first one bumped Draco’s shoulder in implication.
“Shut up you two, your brain cells would be better used going over the summer homework you’re still finishing on the train. Ms. McGonagall will have your heads if the penmanship is any worse than usual.” Draco scoffed.
It was as her polished nails worked through the stack that she found a name she remembered. Remus Lupin, the disgusting creature she had so long ago failed to throw out of Hogwarts, but as she went to tear up the paper its words caught her eye. An adoption form.
You may notice a different scene break in this chapter before I go back and edit the others, I don't like how it looks on my phone and I need to experiment. I don't like my narration much yet but I'm hoping once we get past setting the world up and settle into events the more I'll adopt a more detailed voice. Right now we're just struggling past all the same information in every other fanfic and I need to get to a point where I'm blazing more of a trail, not sure where its going on that trail but its at least semi-logical so it can't be that bad.
Remus was perplexed. As he looked at his son in a mix of fondness and worry. It shouldn’t have been a surprise after his first stunt that he would go galivanting with the second troublemaker in Remus’ life. All in all, it was good to know how close they’d become. In the end, he would already be paying for his rule breaking with one of the sternest teachers in the school, essentially doing that part of his parenting for him. To be honest, he was almost afraid to be upset at anything out of a sense of hypocrisy based on his own childhood. He had done so many things he would always regret, this was as good as a time as any for Harry to learn that lesson. He could just be supportive for now.
“Don’t know, only Lacy takes the boxes.” Dobby’s eyes were instantly brimming with tears.
“And tell Your father Remus about this later for me, would you? The mother hen will be on me like a pixie otherwise.” He said to Harry who became a bit more subdued by the realization he wasn’t totally safe yet.
The Greensand Way, a long-distance path of one hundred and eight miles in southeast England, from Haslemere in Surrey to Hamstreet in Kent. The preserved nature in the rural area and woods, orchards and hop farms along the way with the scant amount of way markers would be his guide.
___________________________________________
“Where is Riddle? Where is the task force that is supposed to apprehend our fugitive? Will someone get this criminal away from that child or will I have to?” She was throwing blame and promises of taking action in a way that had Sirius snarl like he was in his Animagus form, ready to cast a volley of hexes and jinx.
“No, only that she was a friend and a loyal follower. You have come for what she brought haven’t you.” It was not a question. “He sends a child as if I would show mercy and accept any other but him in trade? If Albus wishes for life everlasting he should come back and get it himself. I will either live with him for all time or outlive him, but I cannot exist in a world where he still breaths and is not mine. I can wait. Can he?” Gellert’s angelic voice turned to steel as he spoke.
“You think that would be enough?” Sirius asked looking over to his lover with hope.
“I’m going to do something a bit less extreme.” He breathed out heavily as his heart picked up a harsh pace.
It was with a quirk of his head to the side as he started wandering blindly through the overgrowth that he silently led the way in their party’s search. It had been in the way the plants bent imperceptibly, the sound of water that refused to slosh or trickle as it crept to its destination somewhere. Harry only came back to himself when he felt the ground under him give gently with his weight. Following that give and turning back when he accidently got farther from it the sound of water from far off echoed off walls. The way forward.
“Dobby, this is Tom. Tom, Dobby.” Draco waved between them in introduction. “He helped me find where all of Bellatrix’s… personal effects are in the manor. It was worse than anything I’ve ever seen.” Draco hung his head between his legs and took deep breaths. When he thought he could speak without throwing up he kept talking, grateful for Tom’s training in the Ministry that made him so ideal to talk to about something so awful. “It was in a box, something with a blue aura. It was locked inside with strong dark magic I couldn’t touch safely. My Mother she—” He couldn’t.
Draco had stayed the night in the guest room, having worried how he would be received at home. He had owled his mother, Narcissa, to let her know and hadn’t gotten a letter back yet. That wasn’t promising, it meant she was either extremely mad or more likely that she was busy trying to talk sense into his father who was definitely extremely angry.
“Yes.” The blonde’s mind turned back to the mirror, to the moment he finally acknowledged his desire for the boy that now held him. A sudden twist below his bellybutton rushed down to heat his member at the memory.
“That’d be me alright!” She proclaimed loudly as she fell into the seat across him. “Do you need help in love and such?”
“That’s not what I would say about them at all.” The muggle nudged Draco with his shoulder. “I’ll listen for now so you don’t worry—”
Now he was sitting and interviewing one of the last witnesses that had seen one of his marks the day before, Severus Snape, friend of the family. If you could call him that. It had always seemed complicated to Tom honestly.
“Ravenclaw!” She bellowed and he was ushered over to the table, finding a place between the older kids and the first years being sorted in with him. He gazed over at Draco who seemed to have a thoughtful look on his face as he looked back at him. A sudden drop in Harry’s stomach made him frown to himself, the emotional spiral devouring him immediately.
“It didn’t end well for him, it’s not common knowledge just what she did to him, but he changed a lot since then. Rehab and therapy, even got recruited by the ministry. I just thought he wouldn’t be assigned to this because of his connection to Mother.
“It’s called the Shrieking Shack.” Draco grinned, it widened into something feral as Harry started to look up skeptically at him.
“Ya, our fearless leader over there always talks like that so people that don’t spend time with him might not notice, but we just worried and let him decide when to talk. Admittedly the longer he took the more obnoxious Pansy was getting. I don’t remember ever having a real talk about feelings together and this will hopefully be the closest we ever get Salazar willing.”
“They’re talking about the first Hogsmeade visit, I don’t know what it’s like. Do we all want to go as a group? I’ll ask Ron and Hermione too.”
“I didn’t think about the fumes.” The lanternlight caught a heavy tear fall onto the forest floor.
Hermione herself was still uneasy about this huge change. No one could change that much and that fast, but she owed it to herself to believe at least this one time. She had fought all her life for the composure she now wore, and if anything, she saw something similar she’d never noticed before on Malfoy’s face; a look he was allowing himself to slip off just a bit in their private company. She understood how hard that was, sometimes she couldn’t do it, even with Ron until she blew up from the stress.
“Alright, fine. But you better publish all of it, I don’t care if it’s longer than usual, it’s a big story so it needs more pages.” She huffed with an authority only Rita could have.
“Ah, well Christmas and the witch burnings were both Christian—or is it Catholic? You know I don’t quite know the difference, never seemed like there was any. But in any case, the link is there, and in the end that’s just how it is with so many things don’t you think? A good thing can be criminalized when associated with the bad. Though the opposite can be true as well. The context is what’s most important.”
“Why do you sound like you’re trying to ready me for war?”
“How would you want to be treated?”
The pure unfiltered hate in her had been something perfected, and stowed away after the defeat of Grindelwald. The time to end muggle dominance was over, set free from the old ideal she had fostered another not so dissimilar kind. The werewolf’s, the vampires, the fairytale creatures that have no place in civilized society; they would be culled and erased from her world.
He’d thought he would lose his Father if he couldn’t cut him out of his own crimes. What he had been afraid of was suddenly juxtaposed onto his Mother instead. None of the aforementioned boxes had been left in the room, they had been unpacked.
“Don’t suppose you could tell me what the thing is that Tom lost?” Nagini just looked up at Harry, flicking her tongue at the air. “Thought not.”
For a chilling moment Sirius stared down Harry’s form as it came closer, and he wondered, what scars had been left on his sweet child now. He had already come with so many…
“That doesn’t mean anything! Think of the child!” Dolores yelled over him and the Minister slammed his fist down on the desk.
“we put a curtain over it but she doesn’t exactly need to see to scream at me.” Sirius cringed.
“They like the damp soil and it relaxes them. Don’t struggle or the Devil’s snare instincts will make it latch on harder. Luckily Hufflepuff, like some very enthusiastic green thumbs, liked to talk to her plants. Check this out.” Harry smiled down at the plant. “Hey cutey, will you let Draco go for me? You’re so good, our pretty green girl. Let me help you out.” He spoke gently, more gently than Draco had ever even heard before. The padding of dirt along his palms kept Harry safe as he gently guided the arm like appendages to unwrap from him. He laid it back fully against the tree and started to half bury it in loose soil.
“We are going to have to get you a few things before you can go.” Sirius gasped in and tilted his head back against the sofa seat to look up at Harry’s resting again on the cushion.
“Half yours.” She laughed and whacked him with her hand towel.
“You are about to witness sensitive information. You are not to tell anyone or try and sell proof of what you see, or you will be held accountable. This is a special circumstance and if you wish to leave at any time you may under oath or memory alteration.” Milton stated in a scripted tone. “Now hold my hand and take a deep breath.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll remember in two months. The most he’d ever do is a—” Draco cut himself off before he said it.
The train!
“I didn’t do anything.” Draco found himself protesting. “How can someone so stupidly innocent exist?” He threw back.
“I’ll get the others through.” Albus said to the small group that had made it out of the second room. He swept back into the fog and began pulling them out one by one.
“Kreacher.” Remus said into the air and the older elf popped into the room with a bubble of light.
Torches were crafted up from discarded branches and set aflame. The doorway they expected was nowhere along the overgrown walls far in and the small handful of Aurors and one teacher, Remus, looked tired and disheveled. It had probably been at least an hour of searching before they’d even found the entrance to the chambers and now there were no windows to look out of and check how far the moon had stretched out into the sky, or sun for that matter. Still, if they couldn’t find the way forward there was some small hope that Narcissa hadn’t either and it was just a matter of finding her restrained to one of these trees.
“I laughed so hard my side hurt the whole day that got published!” Another chimed in.
Harry had his hands deep in a bucket of murky water laughing to himself about the absurdity of life when the doors opened. A few wizards had come in to try and pry him out now only to be sent away by the Goblins. A picture flash this time had him fluttering his eyes open and closed to get his bearings.
The cacophony of immediate yelling and chatter filled all of Harry’s senses as bodies moved to surround him and Arthur.
“As you wish. Now, to get out of here before we get in trouble for playing around in a hearth unsupervised.”
Standing on the threshold of the bank he quickly pulled down his hood and yelled down to the crowd bustling through the intersection of cobble roads, “I’m Harry Potter! Tell however did it that no one’s taking me away from my Dads! If they don’t like it, they can tell me to my face!” He finished with slamming the door just as loudly and wobbled over to a corner. The Goblins inside either sneering or ignoring his entrance completely.
“Draco, what are you spacing out for?” Harry had ambled over to poke the blonde’s shoulder. The harsh snap of the illusion had Draco flinch and turn back to his muggle with a deep flush and gasping in air like he’d woke up from a dream.
“Why don’t they just say that?” Harry grumped.
“What did he ask you for then?” He asked as he sat in the drearily ornate home on Spinner’s End.
“It feels less awkward somehow. Just more intimidating.” Harry squirmed and Draco gave him a light stroke to help him from aching. He watched Harry’s jaw drop at the feeling and choked himself when the hand around him squeezed.
From there the next day went by like expected, the night another hike out to a nearby part of the grounds to collect something. Harry had told Remus they were bringing Draco with them and he seemed a bit surprised, but owled Sirius as soon as he was told. The light hearted feelings that began to seep into them as the days passed had the two back to that silly mood that had them kissing in that storeroom before all this. So, it was no surprise when a similar rendezvous was made.
Draco and Sirius returned home, and he shifted back into a human. Sirius pulled Draco into another crushing hug Draco took as best he could. “He looks like he could be ours...” Sirius choked out. He loved him; Draco knew he would. Come to think of it the messy black hair did resemble Sirius’.
“Yes, why?” Tom’s heart was squeezing in his chest.
“Scoot over?” Draco’s voice was a whisper close to Harry’s ear and he smiled as he shuffled to the side. The infirmary beds weren’t very wide at all, but Draco did his best not to touch Harry’s treated back as he settled on his side as close to the other as possible.
Thank you one more time for reading. I hope my next work can entertain you and others. Giving back to this community in my attempts to write is the most important thing I've done for myself in a long time. I'm not social and I keep to myself so this has been the most open I've been more so than friends I used to have in school. It's scary to share any part of yourself with people, but that's just how much I wanted to do something for everyone.
“So, we’re really doing this.” Harry said before starting to move his hand to start working Draco’s cock. The blonde tried to match his pace, but each time one of them did something different or unexpected the other would cry out as they were forced closer to the edge. Harry reached further down to grab Draco’s balls and force his other hand in to keep working him, it set him at a strange angle that pushed him more against the blonde as they rocked into each other.
“I would like to stay at the Black house whenever he stays over at yours, if I’m to assume that Spinner’s End is my current residence.”
That hand finally found its way from Snape’s lap and ran a thumb along his eyes one by one to wipe them clear. Gentle care warmed his face and Lucius flushed at the contact. He suddenly felt like he’d been alone for years, the false feelings that kept him company flaking away and leaving him sick and mournful for the loss.
To Sirius’ surprise the house elf seemed to melt just a bit. That had never happened in all the years he’d known the hateful creature. There was a reason he had that name after all. The elf was being nipped playfully by Harry’s owl as Harry introduced the two and Sirius wondered when all this had happened without him noticing. It was strange how Harry’s willingness to understand others had opened them up, the most closed off and brittle people he could think of too.
“Out on the streets getting into fights!”
“Your Auntie Bella! Bellatrix Lestrange. And I’m going to kill you.” She smiled with her teeth, like she planned to bite him. In comparison to how the Goblins bared their sharp fangs he would believe she would do it before them any day.
It was official, Harry had just called some stranger out to the school yard after class and now he just had to wait for them to show. Hopefully they would show. Hopefully they thought they could get away with this too.
The scenes the healer had played back in his head from now to his youth had lodged itself in the forefront of his mind, the images only ever going backwards and skipping like a broken record where something important should have been. It made him thrash against his binds. He knew something was wrong, but as hard as he thought through the growing pain the less, he found and the more frustration built itself in his chest.
“Do I know that?” Tom spoke softly and Severus looked up with that signature glare, he answered back with an apologetic face.
“What does that mean?” Harry pushed his parents out of the way a bit despite their protests he guided her in and sat her down in his chair, Kreacher was there with a drink for her the next instant.
“Ghosts and such, it’s an old way of banishing them from your dreams. If it happens again, we can use something more specific.”
“We aren’t!” He defended venomously as Pansy started to bicker with him about how the henchmen had a point. Then it devolved into an argument about how Crabbe and Goyle weren’t henchmen.
The door to his room was left open and Harry noticed several minutes later after Draco had turned to his own room that he hadn’t crossed back again to get to the front of the house. He’d left another way, how long ago in the few minutes Harry felt were like hours he didn’t know.
It started small, he had a group go out to clear a few tactical locations, a town house or two strategically placed, a loft or a store on the corner of an important street. The visions led him to his muggle leader, in a protesting group filling the streets of Germany, the one he found was somehow like him in a way he couldn’t describe. He called to unite his people. Gellert thought he could hone him, that the man was who he was meant to find. It had not been so; it had been the warning. He should have killed the muggle, but he had believed he understood what it all meant. That he could control it all and make a champion.
Ron stopped dead as the boy retreated from him. He was breaking out in a sweat from the immediate panic he was sucking up from the situation. Trying to find the right way to do this, but he just didn’t know. It was with a total lack of finesse and the sound of Harry only getting worse that Ron finally doubled down and walked over with more confidence than he felt.
“Of course, tell them I’ve approved it and we’ll work out the details with Tom. I think the distance will help the two of you.” Draco had leaned into Severus’ space over the course of the conversation, his face eventually hitting the black clad chest of his guardian. A few seconds later he felt arms come up to his back to hold him lightly, delicate like Snape didn’t know what to do. He had never been the touching kind, much like Draco, but that had been changing in the company of Sirius and Harry who showered him with so much affection it was now hard not to seek it out. “Thank you.”
It was incredibly frustrating to get taken home only to be told they didn’t get to go with Tom who was bringing the bottle to Albus. He wasn’t given the chance to pout about it with his own fatigue, the endless interrogation of where he’d been and what happened and Draco clinging bodily to him as he chastised everything said by anyone and everyone present. Draco for his part, after having time to calm down from his own problems and what looked like the aftermath of a breakdown on his face, the most obvious being the blood red of his eyes from crying, was totally unrepentant now. Acting like it was only harry in trouble, his usual defenses in place saying more than words at this point about just how hurt he was since he couldn’t let himself out of his shell even though he was alone with them.
“But what about the magic trackers on our wands?”
“Afraid I haven’t the slightest, only you can understand your dreams Dear. Do let me know how it goes, won’t you?”
It was in the Alpine Alps that Albus caught up to his estranged partner. The home of the stone. A nexus of its own existing on the inside slowed time but not progress, the stone etchings were fresh as the day the nexus was made though it was as old as them. He entered the mountain home, the old fortress functions built in it reminding him of how far they’d come from what they had been once, cells and training rooms twined in a maze meant to disorient attackers.
“Is it… Fear?”
“I’m his girlfriend these days, but we started as friends. I mean obviously.” She coughed a bit to clear her throat. “I’ve heard all about you from him, I hope we can be good friends too.”
Harry watched him, letting himself be stimulated and watching for any signs on Draco’s face that this was a bad idea. In the end he let himself buck them over to pin Draco to the sheets and lock lips in a fierce attempt at reassurance as he tried to grind down on the other. He felt the response immediately, Draco folding and letting himself become dead weight as Harry took over. The security of their exchange lighting a fire for the both of them.
“So, what I— “Hermione tried again.
The tall and thin townhouse had slid into existence between two cream colored ones. It was a juxtaposed black to go with the family name and certainly not the neighborhood. The whole thing shook and groaned at their entry; the strangely welcoming old home reminded him of the cupboard in a good way. He didn’t feel out of place, and it was all that way, history and culture leaking out of the cracks of each wall.
The group shuffled back in and took their places, the looks passed between each other masked with indifference. Black not applicable for the vote aside; Lucius Malfoy, Griselda Marchbanks, Tiberius Ogden, Albus Dumbledore, and countless other established Wizangamot seat holders straightened and waited for their signal.
“She’ll get too fat to fly soon.” Sirius chuckled as he watched them from the doorframe.
I’d been plucked from an orphanage in the middle of nowhere a few years before the world war would end. Albus had been the one to pick me up and he looked even younger then, of course. Not a wrinkle or blemish, he exuded light like an angle to the little boy that I was. He let me stay during summer instead of letting the head master send me back to the orphanage, he’d done everything he could for me and I loved him for it. In a world where no one cared about a single abandoned child he did and it saved me.
“Albus are you sure you can’t remember where it was.” Tom asked again for the dozenth time.
“All humans are just sentient jelly beans if you stop to think about it.” Draco offered.
“I’m certain that it is the remnant segregationists we’ve been fighting and threatened by for the last decade. They always manage to receive information from the inside that no one should know and we already know they have used similar tactics for vampires in the past. This is not a step out of bounds or beyond their ability.” Tom said with every bit of conviction he had.
Harry had left a note, so he wouldn’t be in too much trouble… He just imagined if it was Draco, Draco would forgive him, right? That was not helping. Harry was making his way with an old jumper’s hood obscuring his features, old sneakers kicking a few bottles out of his way as he stood before the Leaky Cauldron. He was shown how to get to Diagon Alley by Arthur that first day and made his way past the brick entrance without being stopped by anyone. He was keyed to the wards since then, no illusions or confusing feelings that would send him away like other regular muggles.
Finally, Harry looked up into Tom’s eyes. “Tom, the Head Master’s office goes up to a bedroom doesn’t it? The railing up to it has little ivy vines carved in it right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The heresy of it, the pure unadulterated insult. The damn mutt had already married a werewolf and Bellatrix was almost impressed under all that anger that Sirius had actually managed to disgrace their family more. True it would have angered her if he had chosen any child of any blood not pure and having any Black history in them to keep the family going, but that was not currently the point!
“You call that not blind.” His father grumbled.
“Are we going to stay the same?” Harry choked out as he leaned into the blonde.
Draco froze in place, his fingers flexing around Dobby’s and his airflow restricted by a new dread. He hadn’t thought about how she might have been notified, he’d told Dobby to bring him in quietly, but that didn’t necessarily mean there weren’t spells tripped by his entering her private rooms. It simply couldn’t and wouldn’t cross his mind, it wasn’t supposed to be this way.
Now we must ask ourselves, where were the parents? Remus Lupin and Sirius Black had failed to save their own son after years of attempted adoptions, raising the doubt yet again if they are capable. Lucius Malfoy has declined to comment on his own whereabouts at the time, implying that he may have chosen not to appear despite his own son’s life or death struggle. Two star-crossed lovers caught between domestic abuse and neglect. One with a dangerous predator for a guardian and the other a man that may prove more deadly to our muggle than the werewolf living in his own home.
“What? Are you kidding? He almost killed himself of course we’re grounding him.” Remus poked Sirius in the ribs. “We just aren’t punishing him. Christmas is not getting canceled by the ‘mean dad’ and you can’t make me.”
“It will be done Master Remus.” He nodded.
“I see you’ve met the Day Dreamer.” The old man smirked with a glint in his eye as he turned to them with the two lenses he had produced. “And the Old Scar. Can’t say they’re safe but they are often the most fun to make.” He spoke conversationally before mumbling to his work station. “Now for the frame you picked.”
“Suppose we won’t want this on record then.” Tom said before the parchment went up in flames. “Go back home now, and this time, do let me handle things.” He gave a pointed look to Sirius.
“You are not my kind… He sends a rat here. An insult. Did he want to see if I would give you mercy? I will show you mercy.” He hissed as he pulled his wand from his side.
“Hmmm. I heard it’s Sirius and Lupin.” He stopped to get a nod from Milton before continuing. A bolt of lightning rushed down Harry’s back at the first name, the dog’s name. “They were pretty famous back in school, I was a few years off from them myself but there were a few pranks I saw them pull, if you’d like to hear over some tea while we get you sorted.”
“We can go in the morning once we’re sure you’re all healed up. I don’t want to rush you or we’d go today, fuck anyone who didn’t get the memo and gives us shit.”
The frost and thin layer of ice over the hinges crackled in response. The entry scraped open, it seemed to suck in the air in, like it had been fully sealed and devoid of all else for an unknown amount of time. The sudden pull forced the door open instantly, Harry having fully leaned his body into it fell forward onto his side. The pitch dark of the stony building’s interior had him fumbling for his flashlight as he stuck himself with the sharp end of the pin he’d put away. A sound of protest escaped him as he shuffled off the floor.
He sees the article of Draco with Harry Black Potter and the image makes his skin itch. That sensation hasn’t happened in so long. He gets so angry at his son for that feeling.
“No—”
“So, this is Draco, Draco this is Ron and Hermione.” Harry introduced as he patted the cushion beside him in invitation.
“Thanks.” He mumbled as Harry started to guide them to their compartment.
Thank you for all the patience you've had reading all this and I hope you're all safe and healthy, but if not just know I wish you the best in everything and still hope to have you reading my fanfics well into the future. I love every single one of you as a fellow reader and writer and just as a person.
“Why doesn’t he come to us?” Sirius finally asked into the silent room, warm light from the sun coloring his bruise colored eyes, how Remus wished he could have him sleep more regularly.
“That thing probably can’t even fit us separately right now.” Draco looked on skeptically. He watched Harry widen his eyes to be as big as possible, an unfortunate accidental impression of a house elf.
“Extremely, we can’t be sure he’s fit to live without medical watch for the foreseeable future. Counseling too. I’d say we would start out with supervised visitation, but only after there’s no danger with his mother and any control she may retain over Mr. Malfoy.”
“You don’t have to.” Harry offers gently.
“Yes sir, there is a bit of both.” He waited till the Minister straightened and waved a hand for him to continue. “I’ve gone over the scene at the house and I have found reasonable doubt against the current lead of a werewolf related attack.”
“That is not your choice to make!”
Harry finished preparing their breakfast like he did every day and watched them dote over Dudley like he was a gold idle.
I hope I did a good job with Grindelwald, I knew I wanted him in the story I just wasn't sure how important he should be next to Bellatrix who's kind of been the main bad guy. I like the idea of him having all this potential, but wasting it in favor of his self made prison/limbo.
Draco just watched the picture move over and over. His eyes did that thing they’d done when he’d first seen his Father after everything, that look that said he knew this person, but didn’t recognize them. Harry handed back the paper and thanked Zabini before pulling Draco close to snap him back into the present.
It was them against the world at first. Soon others rallied to his call, prepared to do what it took to save their people. The ministry didn’t understand, they sent wanted posters out for them, saying they were a terrorist group. That the old men making themselves leaders of the youth were ruled by ancient supremacy. It had been the first time Albus had come to him to ask if they were wrong before.
“Alright.” They lapsed into silence until Harry found himself smoothing his hand along Draco’s side. His fingers drifting and tracing absently. “I don’t want to keep doing this to us. Can’t we just let them take care of it? I don’t want to do that again.” Harry said into blonde hair he buried his face in.
Her faithful husband had given her this chance at vengeance for her sister and she would not waste it. If the man was going to die, it had to be now.

“Wake up!” Dudley, he yelled in glee as he ran up and down to stomp on the stairs hard and loud. The action sent waves of new dust pouring down on his head. Harry heard the click of the door opening and wrestled out of the sheets that had tangled with Dudley’s oversized hand me down clothes.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was all confusion, nothing made sense and the helplessness only grew as the sounds seemed to coalesce. Then they turned to static and he wanted to be relieved. He really wanted to be.
The Korean Dokkaebi. A discarded item that gains animation. It’s shapeshifting powers like most are used in their pranks. Their power of persuasion can cause you to lose sight of your goals and Ligilimency is recommended in dealing with them. The stronger of them may be born with a club attached to their bodies that can summon like items from other locations.
“Contrary to how I act as you’ve pointed out before I don’t know everything Ronald. Honestly some of them look sicker than you do about this.” She snarked. “It’s starting to grate on me the longer I watch. Are they so disgusted by me that they’d rather associate with a muggle without magic before one with it? No offense.” She hurriedly added.
Gellert had always been a man of many talents, the dreams that sometimes plagued him a small gift of prophesy. He had the feeling and the growing belief as mankind advanced that their destruction would only grow and with it the danger to wizarding kind increased.
He was rewarded by the sensation of Harry’s girth pulling out, a less pleasant feeling perhaps and he frowned to himself, his brow knit together, as he tried to understand his bodies input. All thoughts were quickly lost as Harry pushed back in, reigniting the same rush of tingling need that had pursued them previously. The slow speed set, Harry worked himself in and out. The pace grew as Draco rocked back against him, soon he was stroking himself and Harry took it as a sign, matching the strokes and slapping harder against his partner.
“Draco,” Narcissa’s voice had just a bit of edge to it now, “Now, young man. You’ve been absent all holiday and you know how much that hurts. You know how much I love you my little dragon.” She was stepping closer, her nightgown and robe tied over that were long, pooling around her like she was a living statue with a floating base. He’d always thought it was ethereal before now.
“Mr. Riddle, if you’ll please step out with me for one moment.” She panted as she swept her hair behind her ears.
Merry Hanukkah Christmas Solicitous extreme bonanza everyone! Kwanzaa and Boxing Day and then New Years are coming too.
“Kind heart, you may understand then. Come, Come learn the secrets of this world I have to offer. In the walls of Nurmengard there is time to do so in full.”
Ms. Dolores Umbridge had subsequently found herself in her usual seat, enchanted pen and typewriter that would require signatures after the hearing were scratching away at each letter recorded. One would go to the judges and minister; the extra was for her private records. The personal information of the Dursley’s was the first thing she’d be sending off at break. The muggles themselves were of little import, just a means, a means her people would take pleasure in using.
“You know I can only stop Ron and Hermione from being nosy for so long before they figure you out, right? I get that you don’t want to deal with rejection, I don’t either.” Harry flushed. “But this can’t go on forever and the longer this drags out the more upset you’ll be.”
“My love.” Albus started in that tone, Tom took a deep breath. “Never doubt that I have always chosen you. I know it scares you that I may one day leave you, but we must all walk our own path. You will find me again when it is time.”
“That’s what I saw at the manor.” Draco mumbled loud enough to hear, but didn’t care to share more it seemed as he pulled a cookie off one of the plates on the modest dining table.
“Fire?” He speaks to the knob, but nothing happens. Albus conjures a flame to touch the latch and something clicks. The door doesn’t open, but around the rooms edges Harry pulls Draco’s attention to the starts of fire by grabbing his arm.
“Okay it’s official, I like you guys.” Pansy took the cards being delt to her and straightened them into whatever order she liked to use. Draco just knew someone was going to try and hide cards in their sleeves already.
Harry was still thinking about it, the way Draco had put on his act like when they first met. The tone of voice and tilt of his head, but the mock sneer was different, adorable somehow in a way only Draco could pull off. He’d been surrounded by horrible pretentious people all his life and watching Draco was like watching a one-man comedy group making fun of every last memory he had of them. He had this way of making the kind of person he was trying to be endearing despite past wounds. It was both because and despite that way of being that he was starting to love the blonde. Although the fear of another rejection was brewing bellow that, this time there was the smallest hope that at least Draco wouldn’t blame him for his feelings.
“At home with his Parents, safe and healing fully. I expect to announce Bellatrix’s guilt in the case of the Dursley home break-in as it has been confirmed. There are no grounds for legal action against Remus, there never really was.”
“Then yes, I’m sure.” He swallowed his emotions down heavily.
“I’m still worked open from last night, before—” Draco cut off, thankful for the interruption of Harry finding his prostate.
“They say you’re leaving after this year.” She pouted. “Is it true?”
“Not my place to say. He’d probably tell you if you ask him later. All I know is I couldn’t leave him.”
Draco ran into his guest room to resize the trunk at the foot of his bed before running back to Harry to do the same in his room. Harry was fully collapsed on his bedsheets, a fresh green tea color with silky flower patterns that fit the old house and had probably been in it for generations despite its well-kept condition. Kreacher had definitely done it for him, it smelled like fresh lemon grass just like the old elf did. He’d been happy to learn that the day he’d asked Kreacher for help with the laundry and the elf had taught him his tricks and what he liked to use. It had been the inch of a step in the right direction he’d needed to get to know the man.
“No, never. I never went on holiday with… you know. I was left home. This is my first time.” He finished with a reassuring smile before turning back to the huge waves of the Irish sea.
Harry could feel the muscles in his cheeks fight him from keeping composure. It hadn’t really occurred to him to look forward to doing all these things with people that cared. Sure, a holiday, but not this try hard fix all the memories you’ve ever had of being left out of thing. The most amazing part was how it looked like everyone wanted this, it wasn’t just for him, wasn’t pity or a reminder, it was meant for them. This was a time meant for them to be happy and spend time together.
Draco slumped forward as he shuddered his release in time, the bite’s weight adding to his desperation and pushing him over as Harry milked him with a desperate fervor like he was working himself through orgasm. Shockwaves coursed through them as they tensed and relaxed over again at each strong pulse and throb that forced another bit of slick cum to run over their hands, adding another wonderful feeling that drew out the experience.
It took awhile, but I think we're finally getting there. This arc is the falling in love arc of the story, where we get to all the fun stuff before the ramp up to the end. I'm hoping to meet at least 50,000 words for this story so it can be a proper short novel and we are at 30,000 right now!
In the end it was being underestimated that had allowed him to get to the bottle in time. If Gellert had taken him as a serious threat he would have gone to protect it from the start, but the man wanted a chase more. Still, either way he was a trained and experienced fighter and duelist, there was no way Harry would simply outrun him to the door.
“But you are!” A shrill scream came from where Bellatrix had fallen, she was coughing and steadying herself on the wall with a hand. Her wand, unfortunately, still held tight.
Children and their family’s voices filled the space between loud machinery and drew his attention to all the people hugging and waving to each other. He took it all in for as long as he could, Sirius waiting patiently for him to be ready. Ron and his siblings were loading up a few paces away and when he spotted him the red head waved and pointed at the booth he was going to be in before boarding. Harry watched him disappear up the small ramp with his own trunk before taking a big gulp of exhaust filled air.
“I can’t just fix what I did. The others won’t be pleased that I’ve done this much already.” Draco said, mostly speaking his thoughts out loud.
“It would have been an advantage!” He spat back in indignity; Sirius’ whole backside was wagging with his tail now. If he was human, he would have been hyperventilating with laughter like Harry.
“Lucius.” Severus stopped for a moment, cautious as always. There was a raw look in his eyes for once though, Lucius wasn’t sure just now if he’d ever seen that.
His feet heavy and stumbling against the roots bumping out along the soft soil ground. He let himself look around for the first time as best as he could. In the middle of what looked like a tropic night jungle with no stars he could barely make out the shapes of the things five feet in front of him. Taking account of his tool set stuffed in one of his pockets Draco had insisted on charming larger for him, Harry managed to find his flashlight among the small trinkets he’d collected for these purposes.
“Practically brothers!” The older man added tauntingly.
The room he shut tight behind him was black like everywhere else in the dark. Unlike the hallway Harry was brave enough to flip the switch on the torch and get to searching for where the wisp pulled. It was for the most part safe on the basis that Gellert had no way of knowing Harry had found his way into one of the rooms, and if he avoided places that reminded him of Dumbledore that might make this place the safest for now.
“All of them are different but paintings are known to be a bit chatty or annoying in some way. When I went to school, the paintings in Hogwarts would watch students and Gryffindor’s dorm entrance was even guarded by one that would keep us out sometimes just because she wanted to sing to an audience.”
__________
“Then there was that one place with Grindelwald.” Harry squinted up with a look of apology on his face only for it to be waved away. “The only way I knew where to go was the wisp, the prisons had small eye hatches, but no other rooms had any indications, handles or labels. Except of course for the tapestries. They told someone who already knew where and what room was there. So…”
“Find who?” Hermione looked between them in question. Ron hadn’t put much stock in the Daily Prophets article before, assuming it was rubbish, but Hermione had been in the muggle world without the news. He hadn’t thought to tell her and he suddenly dreaded what she was going to think. She had been one of the most tormented muggle-borns in the school because of the Slytherin children, and Draco had always led the way.
“That’s it, I’ll take good care of you now.” Tom’s voice came from an odd place, only making sense when a gust of wind hit Albus between his legs and he squeaked in response.
Cheers suddenly broke out across the hall and deafened them. Food was announced as it popped onto the table, the sound and blue tint of the food’s arrival reminiscent of Kreacher. The giant mounds of chicken, roast, vegetables and fruits all glistening in their own sauces obscured other students even as close as the other side of the table before they all began to whittle the stacks down to a reasonable height.
“As is my purpose it seems.” Draco pulled a pouch of floo powder from his pocket to share between them. “Tour over, time to get out of my house!”
“Mr. Dumbledore?” Harry asked lamely as he looked up at the taller man.
“Well, Diagon Alley has a brick wall entrance… the only indication it’s there is the Leaky Cauldron itself and the company logo on the brick.”
IMPORTANT NEWS
“I have some good news.” He began with a grin, “You’re going to be leaving the Dursley’s soon.”
Still her outward appearance held the same loving and soft look it had his whole life. Instincts to run were in conflict with the same instincts telling him to run to her. He supposed he must have the time to cry now because it was pouring down his cheeks now as he stared her down.
Bellatrix looked tired, like she had been trying, like she had been dueling. The sight of her throwing spells indiscriminately and wheezing had him hiding behind the door for a moment before jumping inside to get closer to the questionable scene. She had torn stockings and what looked like a bleeding forehead, was it the forehead? She was limping too, but not enough to stop her from charging forward with a snarl on her lips.
That was an overstatement, what Bellatrix was planning to do was torture. The clacking of heels echoed in the open space like a theatre stage. She had a lace trimmed cloak in pitch black covering every feature except a few hanging curls of frazzled black hair. Her pale fingers the only relief against the dark shape she cut in the middle of the candlelit marble floor.
He’s shaking when he notices the white ceiling overhead. The healers are looking at him with tired wide eyes. They pull away and chatter softly to themselves. None of what they say seems good, but he’s still too floaty to focus on them.
“I said I would.” He called back.
There have been some decisions... decisions about the fate of some characters...
“So, you are both just being stupid. Regardless, I won’t be the one explaining this to your sour lemon father so we will say a week’s detention, ending on break and we will label it to others as extra credit or something. You can learn to properly harvest some ingredients for me since you’re so eager.” The man looked like he had a headache.
“So, you were saying something about a glass blower.” Harry heard the chuckle from next to his shoulder.
“Hey, I’m still new!” Harry whispered furiously, as the next first year was sorted. They only had a few more to go. “Plenty of time for me to come up with a plan for world domination. Maybe a little revenge against all those who have wronged me once I take my place on the throne. You haven’t wronged me… Have you dearest cousin?” He tries to drop his voice threateningly, but neither of them can stop the uncontrollable smiles on their faces.
“I’ll see if I can’t request temporary leave to assist you and Sirius.” Remus consoled.
“And don’t you think you should have a television?” Harry countered.
“What do we make with this fancy ghost spit?” Harry nudged Draco’s shoulder and frowned when the blonde tensed up.
“It has to be down there.” He nodded to it and saw the agreement on the others faces before attempting to guide the vines out of the way for them. “Roody, can you go get the others for us.” Harry turned his head around to look at the man who took his task to heart immediately.
“What would you do if someone was trying to destroy your family? How would you protect them?” He asked softly up at her. She never faltered, a strength that defined her more than her hate.
“You’re right that I don’t want to leave you alone right now. Go talk to Remus once I’m gone, find out what’s wrong with you if you can. I doubt its anything serious, but just in case. Meanwhile I’ll call for my own house elf to take me home in secret and help me look for anything he thinks looks suspicious. With any luck my Father didn’t put enough stock in the thought his own servants might betray him and displayed what we’re looking for openly at least to the staff. If not, there’s several hiding places to sort through.”
“You think—” Harry grit out, “I am less because I’m not like you. That’s not true—”
“And you’re sure you heard and explosion and screaming after?” Sirius and Remus were looking back and forth between each other with worry plastered to their faces.
Harry choked on a laugh. Insect. Dudley was an insect to this complete stranger. He was so similar but pleasantly cold instead of hot headed. Like a soothing balm.
“If it’s hard to get here we’ll go somewhere else.” He chimed back with a grin.
A rack of bones, an old school picture of Tom on the wall, A series of others with Bellatrix and Narcissa with others faces jabbed out in the frames. That was just what he could make out in the dark. Then Dobby snapped his finger again and the room lit, candles exploded into flame around Tom’s picture. It was unsettling on its own.
The first month went by like a blizzard, fast, but blinding and overwhelming in all the ways you’d expect. All day was classes, both the kind from muggle school and then those for magic making the curriculum either completely normal at first glance or a complete unknown factor. That meant twice the work and class time from usual. The long breaks in between had been a godsend once he’d learned about them. Draco as promised spent every waking moment with him and away from his friends who had been eyeing him with a mix of emotions for a while. They were waiting.
__________
“It was a long time ago, but ya, I was under the impression he wouldn’t want to be here or that others wouldn’t want him here at least. Everyone knows already so I can just say it I think… Rodolphus Lestrange. Belatrix Lestrange.” He stated plainly with emphasis on their last names.
“This is our time Albus! I am trying to fix it, but they refuse to yield. I have explained to them—”
“Well—” Pansy flushed and ran hands down her robe like they had started sweating.
“No, you’re not, but that’s something you have a right to. You don’t have to tell me what you were going to. I know it can’t be easy to tell me about him, I’m just glad you don’t think you have to hide the fact that he has ties to the Death Eaters. That can’t be easy to talk about, like with your friends before.” Harry watched Draco tense.
Harry tried again and again to push Draco along with a comment, a joke, a whisper and received nothing. He was sunken under the too many thoughts again it seemed and Harry eventually had enough after they had been at it for an hour.
I buckled down and wrote almost all of this today. A part of me is fighting a conclusion to this hard. I attribute so much auto writing to this because I didn't plan most of the ways things have tied in together throughout all this, little details and lore.
Harry leapt through the door and slammed it shut at the threat. The sound of a spell cut off before it could be known as the man gave chase. Harry ran, a second later he was scooping the wisp close so it wouldn’t be dragged along painfully. Could wisps feel pain? The sudden thought, made in concern, was interrupted by the stone door slamming back open and a figure running after him. The other man was taller, he’d make longer strides and Harry twisted around a corner as another spell flew.
“Smart kids can tell when there’s trouble.” Tom teased and the pair jumped in surprise to turn to him.
Draco was feeling a bit self-destructive perhaps, not angry, but he needed to stop everything else. He straddled Harry in a huff and started groping the boy’s flesh in a forced and desperate effort. He was taking hold of Harry’s member as he yelped and tried to sit up. Draco pushed his chest back down.
“I had worked on campus for a few years when I was starting out—”
“Why did you bring him here?” Blaze whined.
Draco and Harry sat in a booth across from Severus and Lucius, Remus and Sirius. Draco had agreed to let his Father join them at a neutral place for dinner with Severus’ supervision and the others couldn’t help but tag along. Things were awkward throughout, but unlike the tension Draco was used to or the rejection he expected he was greeted by the most uncertain and wilted version of his Father he’d ever met. The buffer of the others was thankfully filling up the space between them and leaving them to watch the other, sharing small words, carefully feeling the other out.
“They’ll get over it or face my wingless wrath. You’re stuck with me and if they don’t like that I’ll just do em’ like I did Bellatrix.”
“Take yer time, price ain’t going up if you do. Promise on my soul.” She winked as she led him out. “And a little extra advice, I’d listen to those dreams if I were you. The godlings have been at it recently, somethings coming.”
“She feels nice.” Harry mumbled as Nagini sang praise back to him he couldn’t understand. “It’s nice to meet you too Nagini. I hope we can be friends.” He talked back in a hushed voice so no one else would hear. When Nagini lifted her head to nod an unmistakable yes Harry almost gasped. “You’re magic, aren’t you?” another nod.
“Ever since…I’ve been thinking…I was stupid to think there was only one way to win a fight. It’s not always the strongest or the smartest who win in a fight, it’s the one who makes it to the end regardless of those factors. If a muggle can win a fight against a powerful witch, I bet there’s not much difference between purebloods and muggle-borns; but a part of winning may one day count on you being underestimated by someone like me. I can’t change other people as much as you can’t, I hope the knowledge that you can use that as a tool can be some consolation.”
Draco plans to save Harry and a good dog gets pets.
“Yes sir.” Dobby hopped in place and bolted for the door to the hall. He didn’t know the human way, but he’d seen Lacy whenever she used the service paths. Knew which turns to make from all the other times she’d had a parcel. He ran and opened the nearest wall panel and turned into the bare wood innerworkings of the manor, the young master in tow.
“Oh, well since she started teaching you. She’s been too busy to visit, but she promised she’d sleep over soon.” Narcissa smiled brightly. “It’ll be just wonderful having all my favorite people together under one roof.”
“The finals that are an accumulative potion you’ve been working on for half the semester?” Snape asked flatly.
“Oh, hi…dad. I was just getting everything packed up. How do you think Remus is? “He asked awkwardly.
The nurse stomped off to look over the others with that stern look on her face that meant she fully intended to berate everyone still conscious in a similar manner.
“Not a one.” The muggle smiled at the memory of it alone. “Strength, destruction, war, truth, air…No. It wouldn’t be. Right?”
“Relax young man, I know its overwhelming. Just relax.” She coaxes before putting the hat down on his head.
“Get away from that Muggle!” The woman’s voice screeched after him. “You have no right to it! You have no right to any of this! It’s your fault Big Sister isn’t here herself, you hear me!” Harry felt something strike his right leg and fell with a scream of pain.
“Breath Harry, or you’ll pass out.” He instructed and Harry pulled away to turn his head and began to suck air in and out. “Take your time. Like you said, we have nowhere else to be.” He soothed and Harry eventually leaned back.
“I suppose because I’d spent so long seeing it out my own window. I just wanted us to experience this fantasy I’ve had together. I’d put it away so long ago it wasn’t something I let myself think about, but with the family spirit we’ve gotten recently,” He nudged Harry’s shoulder for emphasis,” That old nostalgic longing to make this real came back this year.”
Now it was out of fear that it would end. Once the door opened, once he had to look at what was in front of him, how long would it last? How much had he misunderstood? How long would they tolerate him before realizing he was worthless? That thought made him feel like he was hiding something. Wasn’t he though? That’s why he was always confined to the cupboard, because he wasn’t right in the head and didn’t know how to act in front of “Decent folk”.
Draco looked down on the mop of black locks that imitated freshly pulled roots, the emerald green of Harry’s eyes illuminated where he watched the vials flicker out from its newly green colors. He was waiting patiently, obviously having thought about this for some time.
“You shouldn’t have to say anything, it’s none of your business.” Draco grouched before giving a frustrated huff. “Fine, I’ll talk to them. But only if you stay away when I do.”
“Time to go, huh.” He turned to Kreacher and Sirius where they flanked him. Ducking down he pulled the smaller man into his arms and whispered something in his oversized cat shaped ear. The elf huffed back before Harry pulled away to embrace Sirius one last time till they would see each other on holiday. “Be good while I’m gone, and try to get along with him. You’re a different person now and I think you can put things aside with him, Don’t you?”
“I said I wanted to.” Harry took the offered plate of food made up for him as they walked over to the small dining table outside the cramped space.
Rita couldn’t believe how lucky she was right now, not only everything she had seen, but accidently bypassing the dangers of a room that could have very well put her in the same place as they people she followed. The muggle proving strangely if not unnervingly capable of his task as he sweet talked each mandrake to let go of their prisoners and he tucked away wand after wand they held in their grip to hide in his pocket so as not to attract any more new friends as they went. Soon he was in front of Draco, one of the main attractions to her written piece and her mind was racing with how she would spin this moment.
His grandfather he’d been told was the same, that Lucius was giving Draco the same education and training. He’d had to go through what Draco did to become Lord Malfoy and he did it under the thumb of a Death Eater himself, a known fanatic of Grindelwald’s movements.
“Might as well then.” She muttered with obvious nervous energy.
“I don’t appreciate you’re tone Pansy.” Draco straightened up and squared his shoulders visibly.
“We can go salt collecting next time then. Try with a more controlled sample.”
“He is the Black Family House Elf. Why wouldn’t I? Besides the least you can do is be grateful to your own son for going out and getting him for me.” She sniffed; nose upturned. Sirius balked at her before looking over to Harry with raised eyebrows.
“I wouldn’t care if you did. It’s not like I’m standing up for you or anything.” His hold tightened. “Magicless humans aren’t worth thinking about, like birds without wings.” He choked.
__________
“Family!” He chimed back and Draco choked on his words, the obvious blush and demoralized look had Sirius howling in laughter.
They plopped down on a bench that smelled like broom wax and polish. The light taste of sweat in the air making the room feel more humid than outside. Dead silence was only interrupted by the ruffling of clothes and shoes resting into place on the stone floor. The unusual distance held between them as they settled was a tell of how they both were expecting something to happen, waiting to see who would start.
“Bellatrix had followers not friends. The only other people I can think that would be associated with her is family and I doubt she would have trusted her in-laws. You’re hound spell couldn’t track anyone off her?”
“Harry, you can—you can keep going.” Draco whimpered as Harry tried biting into the crook of his neck.
“Of course!” He accidently yelled back a bit making Lupin choke on a laugh as he followed them exploring the different rooms.
“Understood, and what do you think we should dop about it?” Tom nodded. Harry’s eyes widened in shock; it was easy to guess as to the reason.
“Come on trouble maker.” Remus joked back at his husband as he took Harry in hand. “Care to come over for some biscuits? I can’t promise I have better tea than the Goblin’s though.” He smiled gently down at Draco.
“I’d like it if you did.” Harry squeezed the blonde tighter. “I know it selfish. I get that you love them. I just don’t want you to go.”
“Hello, I’m here to discuss how I can start business with the bank please?” He asked nervously as he watched the man stare down at him with suspicion.
“What are you all doing? Arrest that thing!” A shrill voice pierced the air.
“I must warn you of just one unfortunate thing. We’ve taken down the paintings except for—"
“Such a gentleman, keep being good and maybe I’ll give you a kiss goodnight.”
“And who are you?” Pansy stuck out her chin from where she sat next to Blaze.
“You sound like you want to tell me a very important story.” Harry bet as he took a place on the small stool by the scrappy writing desk next to the exit, never turning his attention to anything but the cat like glint on the man’s face. If this was what his dreams, what the wisp had led him to he owed it to himself to try and find out why. Why was he needed here? What was he meant to find?
“Harry?” He asked weakly through the panting that had begun to grow heavy between them as Harry had continued to work hickeys into his neck. He removed his mouth with a smacking sound, a shiver raking through Draco at the exposed wet skin.
“I’m the Head Master, it may give way for me.” Albus patted Moddy on the shoulder as he pointed his wand down at his feet. The spell he used was long and unintelligible, some Latin roots Harry caught, the best he could translate it sounded like emergency bypass or lift restriction maybe.
Smoke was clearing from the main square of Diagon Alley. Patches of cobble stone path had been upturned or pulverized. Varied degrees of destruction mixed with pools of water, fire, a black hole being barely contained. A slowly spreading paralysis curse was seeping through the many porcupine quills stabbed into many unlucky bystanders. It was an unadulterated disaster, that only ebbed once the doors of the bank creaked open in a strangely deafening way.
(See the end of the chapter for
The next instant was met with Bellatrix visibly ripping what looked like a metallic glittering net, out of a vertebra at the back of Albus’ neck, each thread thick with a watery substance as it clung to the point of her wand. Tom was quick to pull his wand in response, aiming to stop her and succeeded to some degree, cutting the spell short of its full intended damage. The net and liquid seemed to condense into a small vial she had on a cord, and as Bellatrix corked her work, she adjusted now free of her first target to face down Tom.
“Is this going to ruin the integration program?” He asked worriedly as he scanned through the words.
The older man was slipping out of bed, fully dressed in a nightgown that draped down him like every dip of the fabric and ripple as he moved was controlled. Gray faded, almost cloud white hair draped over his back untied, his chest length beard ungroomed and looking more like a cotton puff.
Dobby looked on in horror as well, but looked to the shelves, some part of him still trying to help the Young Master find what he came for. Then they could leave.
“Are you sure that this is safe?” He asked the blonde he let drag him through the broken front door. The energy like Grimmauld place permeated the crisp air inside. The wind whipping through one hole to the next where plaster or wood had worn away only slightly letting out a gentle hum.
He’d never had reason to act on his etiquette like now, no reason to put his foot down or turn over a new leaf with people he’d foolishly scorned over the years. There was an intimidating wall of obstacles already poised before him, but they were his own making and simply conditional on his willingness to see this through. It was time Draco grew up a little, the future was coming for him either way and he wanted to be ready for it.
“I wanted to bring him out on a… date. Sort of. So, I took us to the beach.”
For their part Sirius and Remus already knew that face, a nostalgic image from when they were students before Bellatrix went over the deep end. They seemed perfectly content to simply hug and pat him on the back just a bit more roughly than they would have just a few days ago. The proof he was strong and thoughtful again as he absorbed the affection solidified the couple’s relief.
I've debated adding this to the last chapter like I did the other week, but for now at least I'm posting it as its own chapter and I hope that's acceptable. I've been drawing a blank on a lot of this so I've been writing a good chunk off the top of my head and editing as I go, however like usual that aspect of writing is as much of a joy as it is a challenge since you as a writer get to witness the story just as much as the reader.
“Just going to move on from the mood then?” Draco’s voice called to him from where he’d bolted full of amusement.
“Good, that’s good then. I’ll schedule a transport for him to the hospital immediately.”
“Only if you promise not to die too easily.” He proclaimed loudly before strutting up the steps.
“I’ll ask him when we meet, but do be gentle, even muggle-borns can be scared of snakes, and this one is wholly alien to our world.” He mused. “Perhaps he will find comfort in your protection at the hearing.”
“What? You expect me to stand up for you?” Harry grinned. The three were watching with surprise before Draco reached over to punch his shoulder.

“Cruci—” BANG! Bellatrix hit the far wall so hard everyone heard a sickening crack. Harry was wobbling up from where he’d been thrown back by the force. Little whistling rockets were flying around before bursting in triumphant.
Rita was not pleased to say the least. She had regretted tagging along since the first room despite the overabundance of protection the group of wizards and witches had provided. She was the kind to follow, not to be in the thick of it and as disoriented as she was now.
“Well, I may be forced to assume my true identity soon.” Draco huffed as they got ready to leave.
He let it guide him inside, down the echo filled halls of what quickly became a maze. He started to ascend at some point, his lungs stinging from the high altitude he was already at. It felt like ages, with nothing distinct to remember his way by. Then the wisp stopped hallway down another identical hall, turning to the wall and its lack of a single stone slab. It pressed against the wall and the more Harry looked at it the more he recognized it for what it was. A jail cell. They were in a prison. The lack of a knob or latch was disconcerting, then troubling. Who was he supposed to get in? With a morbid curiosity he shined the torch into the doors peephole and startled at the glow of two eyes staring back at him.
The fog of black refused to lessen as they continued on, feet behind them stumbling thorough the same problem where almost echoed as if it came from far off in the distance and no light from behind Harry was visible to help. He had clung to Draco’s arm from the beginning, but in one instant as he let his fingers slip free by an inch and reached back to grab a new hold, he almost tripped as he grabbed at empty space.
“The what?”
“What do you mean?” Tom looks over his shoulder and finally sees the flames rising up. “Bloody hell, walked right into it.”
“I’m sorry uncle.” He said as evenly as a ten-year-old could.
“Just cuz Draco’s dating your friend doesn’t make us friends!” Goyle blurts out. The debate about how they aren’t dating starts up again instantly.
“No, I won’t ever go back to that. I suppose that answers one of my questions, but does make a few more. How did you get the bottle with him still there? For that matter how did you find it at all?”
The first riddle is from a list of mediaeval riddles but the second I came up with as best I could. The idea of it is that Ravenclaw would have wanted you to be good enough to make up the riddle yourself and solve it using the room as the elements of the riddle and didn't intend for anyone to read her book; it would be so convoluted and hard that only a Ravenclaw would have even a chance of getting it because it relies heavily on that specific way of thinking.
“No, I just don’t like animals.” Draco stuck his nose up and went to leave.
This is the new arc and we will get some much needed development for Tom/Albus as well as the Fae world.
“Maybe.” He cringed a bit.
Slick liquid dripped onto Draco’s inner thigh and he jumped. A finger swiftly finding his hole again, coated with lube to roll over and fondle the delicate entrance as he circled the rim. The breach of sliding into Draco was maddeningly slow now that Harry was fully hard and the struggle to stay paced was ruined by Draco’s own rush to fuck the problems from his own head. Harry finally relented once he’d found himself knuckle deep, flexing his finger around inside to soak the walls and meet Draco’s fervor.
“He was raised not to go to adults.” Sirius sighed and hung his head in defeat, how was he ever supposed to fix that?
__________
Draco tensed when he realized his mistake. Harry had a suddenly glint in his eye that spoke of a challenge before Draco could even think to backtrack. I mean, sure he wanted Harry with him; but he didn’t want him next to him in the dirt if things went south, which he was expecting from before Harry had even enrolled for Hogwarts.
“If this is a Ravenclaw test I think I might fare a bit better. So, let’s put this room in context all right. Soldiers made of stone, a lying door, what else?”
“I need help finding something.” Harry flushed sheepishly. The woman seemed to be growing more calculating the more he left unsaid.
It was then they began to worry, looking to the history of the school and any clues Narcissa was no doubt following to try and crawl her way further in the foundations of Hogwarts to the still undisclosed location of the cornerstone. The more they searched the reachable places of the school the more the war of fear in everyone’s hearts crept closer. It was just a school maybe, just a home perhaps, a fond memory to most absolutely, but just a school nonetheless. It showed in the growing desperation and severe frowns on some of their faces how that fact just didn’t matter, Hogwarts was and would most likely always be their home, much more than just a place. Harry knew that feeling now too and it scared him just a bit.
Happy Hanukkah to everyone, Winter solstice is in one week and then Christmas isn't far behind.
“Have you seen Draco?” Harry turned to Ron who instantly started to choke in response.
Tom hit the lounger hard as he slumped into the cushion. A glint was cast off his eyes where they looked watery and didn’t that just instill a grim feeling in Remus’ gut. The smell like brimstone told Remus all he had to know about how long Tom had been like this, he hadn’t showered in some time to have the scent of floo powder rubbed into his clothes. He had blood dried in his hair and his eyes looked somewhere past his own.
“Hmm, she came some time ago, though when in this place that does not age, I can’t recall. Black as pitch in all, including heart, but she spoke of love lost and offered a gift. She gave me a part of him… yes, a piece that he will come back for.” The dread and unease Harry had slowly allowed to fall into the backdrop resurfaced instantly.
Draco spilled onto his sheets, panting and overheated from his activity. He slumped into the mattress as he let himself roll through his climax, the white that filled his vision fizzing out as his head cleared.
She was bound to attempt something, no matter how unprofessional it may be, in the name of her cause. This would no doubt be a big target, something to make an example out of. The thought set Tom on edge.
“What!” She shouted back and started to resight every curse word she could think of in her fit. “If I had a wand, I would teach you more than just manners!”
Remus come up to Sirius with a piece of parchment in his hand. He didn’t even look over from where he watched the green flames of the fireplace fade. Sirius began to roll up his sleeves as they stepped forwards to the hearth.
“Why did he send it?” Albus asked, some part of him back there before Tom, before loss. Tom let him believe what he wanted; he couldn’t do much else.
“Had to go early to Hogwarts to get material set up for the next years classes. They only have a few weeks to get ready after all. You came just in time for it, huh. It might be a bit much at first, just remember you can leave whenever you want if it’s not what you wanted it to be. I can’t even pretend to image just how this is going to be for you, I have magic, and my family as you might have guessed did not like to associate with those that lived through other means. I just know that I loved it there and I don’t want you to not have that choice.”
“Yes, you are mine, if that is what you want. You are my muggle after all. Are you asking to be alone because of how we act different or because you’ve been dreaming of getting me alone?” Teasing tone earning a thoughtful look from the other.
“What will be like what?” Albus called back distractedly as he scribbled in his notes. His hair was falling into his face again and Gellert stopped to admire the sight. Albus noticed him leaning against the wall with the ammonia and glared lightly at the smitten bastard.
“Let him rest, we’ll have to do another round when he’s stable and start a routine for treatment. Someone get the potions on—”
“How do we make it sleep, it doesn’t even have an almost face to sing to sleep like the others.” Draco crossed his arms.
“Yes, and I’m sure now the voices I heard were Bellatrix and Tom. I think it’s what happened, but the rest hasn’t? It’s supposed to be a prophecy, right? So, there should be things that are going to happen unless I haven’t dreamed them yet.” Harry was wringing his hands together.
“I just meant, you know, that he shouldn’t have to deal with a mess like Aunt Bella. No one should, but especially not a simple muggle.” Draco flushed as his words didn’t grow any more kind.
Draco was on his own like the others now, he’d woken to the tight reins of roots and vines chaining him to the trunk of a tree. A startled yelp escaped when he saw the majority of the roots was the very thing that had dragged him away. He was being kept down by a hulking body. It didn’t so much as move an inch, just tightened its hold further like he was going to slowly squeeze the life out of him if he dared to struggle.
Frustration curling in his gut at the sadness he couldn’t turn off. It was just bursting out of him now that he didn’t have to keep himself together for anyone else. He didn’t even know where it was coming from anymore, he had everything he’d ever wanted and he was still crying. Why was he crying? He crawled into bed and buried himself in the thick sheets as he used them to wipe his eyes.
“who was the other house elf I saw earlier by the way?”
“I’ve been taught never to apologize.” Draco started hesitantly.
Bellatrix felt her mouth twist into a vicious sneer of predatory glee. Her time was coming soon.
Much the same as Tom, Arthur spoke in an official tone when he stood. “Arthur Weasley speaking, for the record. I am to speak on behalf of Harry Potter based on his time living with me and my family. He is an exceptional young man who has exhibited signs conducive with severe and prolonged abuse. Despite this I would like to state he is of sound mind and body and his account should be taken with the same weight as my own. I approve of the request for adoption by Sirius Black and Remus Black Lupin.”
“Didn’t Miss McGonagall leave with the Head Master.” Harry asked out loud to no one in particular, his voice taking trip up into his throat. Apparently, he wasn’t the only one to feel alarm, several people had jumped away from the person that had been standing calmly in their circle for an undecided amount of time. The problem was, it definitely wasn’t any of them and it was apparently not Narcissa either.
He wanted to laugh, he wanted to cry, and maybe he ended up doing both without realizing it at first as the reality of having his soul, his humanity, held in his arms sunk in. There had been a time he thought he would never get this back, that he would lose everything he cared about. There had been a time Albus had sat him down with that foreign yet familiar wrinkled face and told him, “When I go, don’t think of it as me leaving you, think of it as me waiting while you finish your own journey. If you keep living it’s because there is something more meant for you. You where my something more, you know.”
“You may be able to keep the right people paid off and keep our reputation, but fact is free. There are witnesses and people that will be on our side if you ever need them now. You can’t deny that this gives us options for the future depending on where power shifts.”
Ron and Hermione scooted over to them and Pansy came to sit next to her and complain about the Slytherin boys. Harry didn’t realize just how tired he was from the added work in is day till they sat down and began to fill up a plate. He hadn’t had time to even think about being nervous or panicked since he arrived at school and now, he wasn’t sure if he even had brain cells to think right now. Draco was equally quiet, having been rather mellow since their punishment began. It had been a red flag that something was up, but the what was so obvious that Harry simply thought he knew. After an uneventful meal they felt better and said their goodnights to everyone before heading out to where Snape was waiting. If he’d bothered to come in and eat himself neither boy had noticed.
Draco felt his jaw drop. What the bloody hell? Were all muggles this crazy? He shut his mouth, but his eyes remained wide as saucers as he looked down at the curled-up boy. He was braced for torture and Draco had never beaten someone
“What would you want with that sod?” Ron exclaimed.
Draco sniffed through hollow feeling sinuses that hadn’t decided whether or not to run yet as he glanced to his side from where they sat shoulder to shoulder. “You know you can ask me for anything right?” He could allow himself to say, that right? It wasn’t breaking the promise he made to himself. He wasn’t letting himself need Harry like he told himself not to. Bar the mirror incident he’d managed to stay in control at least a little. “It’s no trouble for me.”
“Stay here if you’re so afraid, it was life not love you have grown so dependent on. I will live the life I was meant to; it was a mistake to cheat the natural way of things. It made us stagnant. You are no longer mine; I do not know when that happened.” Albus shook his head to himself, he kept the other at bay with the point of his wand as he fled. Gellert mourned everything he lost that day, alone, forever alone now.
“Quiet down everyone.” A stern woman in a severe hair bun called out from just a few steps above them. “My name if Professor McGonagall, I’ll be your transfiguration teacher here. I know we’re all very excited for our first-year learning magic, but the first lesson you will learn here is to act appropriately. I expect all of you to file up into a line that will stand at the entrance to the dining hall and from there you will be called alphabetically to be sorted. You will remain silent in respect to each other and your future house mates. Once the ceremony is over you will be free to be as loud as you find necessary.”
He didn’t know how much time Albus had had the day he’d lost his youth all those years ago. It had been a blessed miracle he’d lasted over a decade since then. The image of lovable winkled eyes and worn laugh lines flashed through his mind. He had always been beautiful, neither wasting a moment to love the other since that day, he was still perfect. Now for the first time in so many years he had the prospect of really living with Albus again.
Harry was at the entrance of the court room when a tall man in a straight black suit stood before him. The long and rather huge snake at his feet bobbed its head at him in interest as it coiled in place.

“Really Sirius.” He drawled and gave Nagini a quick hiss that she seemed to reply to. “She’ll watch Harry and make sure his health doesn’t change, till then I have a lot of trials and an official declaration to run past with the minister so I’ll just walk you to the ward of the Alley so I know you’ll be safe.”
“I’ve never had a real family before.” Harry let his mouth close abruptly as they waited for him to keep going. When it was clear he wasn’t going to Draco had to prompt him once more.
“Is this his answer then?” Albus steeled himself grimly.
Draco fell back partially on top of their new roommate who tried to coil onto him despite being tangled in the sheets bellow him. A little lick on his cheek drew his attention. If he could speak parseltongue he would have asked the snake what she thought of all this, but no one could these days, not since the last decedents of Slytherin had faded away decades ago.
“It’ll get easier, and you never have to go through this alone; if you need me, I’ll be there, just let me know.” Harry spoke to Draco in a hushed voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then there was a sickening splash somewhere near him, spray hit his face and he pushed himself away from it in panic. When nothing seemed to appear, but the water kept moving in place he knew instantly what it was and with a sudden desperation to get away he saw the small shallows on the other end of the secret lake. It became a chase, as soon as he began to swim away, he heard the loud splash of Narcissa trying to pursue him. He could only hope the cloak she was wearing was heavy and would slow her down.
The Quidditch locker room was modified from an entryway that led out to the pitch from the castle’s main body. It was big enough to be a proper room and had the walls fully stacked with all the regulated equipment allowed for students participating in any kind of flying. They had used it for the first year flying classes as well, Harry had been the tallest one in it while Draco did a class he couldn’t because it was purely casting practice. Harry knew out of all the private hiding places they could pick that no one would come by, Filch only patrolled the restricted areas where kids could get hurt or turned around without help till morning otherwise.
“Nonsense. Is Sirius and Roody—?” He cut himself off and bore his eyes into two shimmering gray orbs.
The minister nodded in approval at Tom as he sat back down, “Order in the court. Now that we have been given all necessary information to make an informed decision there is individual statements to attend to. Harry Potter, if you would stand before the court to be addressed?”
Harry was sure he was asleep; he was sure because his body moved on its own as he wandered down the steps in his pajamas towards the entrance of the house. As his hand reached out to open the door Draco was grabbing his waist and pulling him back in. Now he was awake, but the world didn’t change and he paled as he saw Draco panting after he had chased after him.
Draco had never gone into the servant’s passages even as a child exploring his own home. The wood boards that made it were unpolished but clean and smoothed from feet and hands passing over the surface since the building’s inception. The worn grooves of feet fall on the stairs steps was like an old church, bend in the center with a swooping motion from the weight of its occupants. The few cobwebs left to cling in the odd corner of the ceilings was completely unexpected and foreign for him to see there.
I realized last night after my family watched troll hunter that my nomes are just troll hunter nomes. Well, guess it just be like that sometimes. I hope you liked the little I was able to develope Tom, It makes me wonder how his and Dumbledore's relationship are going to go if and when I get to that in this story.
He could hear footsteps race after him and they started to comb the path for shells or smaller things to fit in vials. The two walked a good half mile down the beach and stopped to rest at a set of rocks that held tiny biomes of life to watch. Harry tossed back a starfish that was still alive and traded it for a chunk of trash he tried to identify.
“First cousins, yes. Hope that’s not going to challenge your attraction to my perfect good looks.” He yelled back before throwing a jinx over to Bellatrix as she tried to set fire to something.
“Soul rejuvenation drought that can heal you from damage done by creatures like dementors who eat the soul after it is forcefully shaken from its seat in your body. Some selkies may also eat human souls they harvest from sailors after they have been fed enough seaweed and water meant to degrade their bodies. The process in any case no matter the perpetrator is almost always death. Though the drought can help to ease undead that lose their souls and need something for the pain of missing that part of themselves.” Severus answered from in front of them.
“You thought many things before now. Come in and sit, I’m sure I can enlighten you my young wizard.”
“Getting in?” Harry shoved himself up to look across from the wizard now.
“No, he must have taken her with him.” Remus exhaled and shook out his hands.
Bellatrix Lestrange had been the perfect Black or so she says, would have been if only she had been a son or so her father told her. Now she was throwing dark curses left and right, shattering important vials of potions and hitting those too slow to block. The Death eater’s militia, those too known from the war to live in public had just been sent the news. A Black heir was being adopted. A muggle one.
Silence was filling the room back up and Harry went back to trying not to make too much noise as he swept around the highchairs that allowed the Goblins to sit above eye level of the people walking in. He had never liked cleaning really, until he’d helped Ron with chores and this felt something like that. He was tolerated, anyone else could just get out if they didn’t want to use the bank and he was kept safe here. It was all for the express purpose of watching a muggle and a wizard beat each other up for entertainment, and they got their floors cleaned, win-win. Despite that, the curtesy they were showing was heartwarming.
“Sorry, I just can’t stop. You didn’t have to.” Harry had tried taking deeper breaths. It was clear Draco’s quick actions had been a good call.
“Filch told me before I came in to deal with you in my office. He said the door was closed and that when he opened it a thick air of fume met him. You were in a nonventilated room with none of the safety charms on furniture or the walls and had locked yourselves up with an open container of fluids giving off continual gas. If he hadn’t been looking for something in there you may not have left in time. You could have gone unconscious and both of you could have suffocated and died in there. There is a reason the labs are so ‘uncomfortable’. The cold from the breathable material making those walls and from the charming that repels all heat that keep it from catching fire to mention a few. I will not allow a second mistake like this for your sake.”
“He’s in this room, I’ve already talked to the doctor about giving you permission as Draco’s godfather to come visit as the closest next of kin.” Tom pointed out the bleach white door with a blue wooden frame identical to the hundreds here in the building.
“There’s something inside you need to take.”
“A keen observation, who’s going to stop me?” Harry shrugged back. “Tell me, what do you do for fun around here?”
Draco walked over to inspect the package and looked back to Harry with a similar face. “It does say it’s a Christmas tree inside.”
“That he cared.” Harry cut in with a stony expression and almost authoritative voice. Draco had to look over at him to make sure he was hearing the same person, even when he was scolded it hadn’t had the level of finality this had.
“The equipment?”
“is he going to be okay, the poor dear looked half starved.” She tittered to herself.
“You seem to think rather highly of yourself Malfoy, but I have no reason to believe you make a better pion than entertaining fodder for my armies.”
“Me and Sirius will look around elsewhere then since you’ve got the perimeter, just yell for us if you find it.” Harry past the line of them spread out inspecting the walls and ended up picking up his personal favorite of his two Aurors, Roody, and Draco of course who had refused to stay still and was half covered in dirt at this point. Raw nerves were bright in his eyes and Harry reached out to take his hand as they went. Sirius had a look on his face like he wanted to say something when he looked back at them all, but he’d decided for a while now that keeping undetected by the Mandrakes with his wand still held fast was the best defense for them and wouldn’t be changing that now.
“Sorry about that.” He spoke softly till that one settled down as well, accepting a few handfuls of wet dirt patted atop its lap. After being satisfied with tucking the plant in the muggle was off again, to do what, Rita was about to find out.
Harry’s vision swirled with lights, red and blue, a pain at his forehead where a shard of something lodged there. Snapping awake in a cold sweat in his bed Harry shot up. The old memory of when he was just a baby, of when his parents died was blurry and faded but still lingered in bad days. The car crash had left its mark, a ridged line up the right side of his forehead, from metal or glass he didn’t know. It was the only proof he ever had someone had once cared.
“That was the nicest thing I threw at her.” Harry snickered back.
The thought that man could harness such destructive powers was not new to him as a human per say. Rather it was the use of that power over each other and its likeness to dark magic, to indiscriminate destruction of everything around these new aged men that struck something in his heart. Advancement was meant to cure such insanity, but like so many Goblins in the wizard’s own wars they refused to see reason and accept what was.
It had never been enough for the woman that wizards had colonized the magical world centuries before. It had never been enough that she came from one of those prestigious families or that magical beings like the bank trolls had long since lost their war for the territory that should have been theirs.
“Ron Weasley.” Harry answered.
“I want to go home.” He squeezed Dobby’s hand. He saw his mother open her mouth to say something, her brows pinched in confusion. Then she was gone.
“Don’t say it yet.” Harry teased as he opened the door. He stifled a laugh at the small curse that sounded behind him.
“I’m fifteen.”
“It’s like standing on a sponge.” He hopped around. Stopping once he noticed the perplexed look on his friend’s face. “What?”
“Ah yes, I suppose I did, didn’t I. See it occurred to me that I still had something of my own to repay to another fae, more on the godly level of things see. She’d been wanting to help you for a bit now and I took a few liberties, but her business isn’t quite taken care of. Matter of fact, you rather helped me with mine first.”
“Little nephew Dray-dray? Come for an intermediate lesson? I didn’t think you had the spine, your father certainly doesn’t.” She teased.
By this point Albus had realized just whose room this was albeit completely by accident. You had to be brave no matter what and keep walking to make it out. It was Gryffindor’s challenge. A complete eclipse of control and one’s self, no one’s particular fear, but one that would overcome all and forced you to show your nature. He had to blindly scrounge and grab at air, hoping he was dragging someone out each time because of this and that took time, so much time, till they had everyone.
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to be now.” Draco muttered down to the table.
“But it was. I don’t think I would have been different if…” His grey eyes unfocused. “I would have resented him. Some part of me still did. I think I was hurt, seeing him with that muggle boy. It was so unfair, but I couldn’t understand why.”
With each step he waited for something. Then he was at the door and something didn’t feel right. The door was open… No not open, destroyed. The stone of two twin snakes that had interlocked on the entrance were chunks of rubble on the ground where no one had seen fit to clean them up.
“So many possibilities.” A deep voice echoed in his head and he yelped at the sudden intrusion. The voice laughed in the back of his mind, leaving a buzzing not unlike the vibrations of your vocal cords there to linger. “Calm now boy while I get a good feel of you. So very different than the usual, more complex. Not unexpected for your age, but there is something to this…Yes… you’ve had to survive, to struggle, be brave in the face of terror, but you still let open trust into your heart? So very complicated.”
Good things happen to those who try. Here come the competent adults y'all!
This was something they chose together, the way Draco let his legs spread open even clothed was exhilarating and Harry laid himself over the other in order to move against him. The layer of fabric between their bodies heated as Harry dragged himself along every inch of his partner in an unpracticed attempt at rutting. The implication was what he’d been after, the tease, as he felt them grow hard together under the constraint of their trousers. Draco tried to pry them apart to worm a hand down and undress but he was denied as Harry took those hands, he held them down into the sheets bunching up beneath them.
“Our supremacy? Really Gellert? This was never a problem before!” Albus shook where he stared down his true love.
The rushed wet fingers he’d had in him now stroked over a much larger offering, the wet and warmth from him being used to ready it. Draco found himself mesmerized by the winking slit that stared back at him like it was threating to swallow him whole as it leaked atop a perfectly pink and soft looking head.
The Cornerstone
Harry balked at the attempt at tongue they tried, suddenly very aware at how he hadn’t brushed his teeth after breakfast and feeling outright gross and sweaty just thinking about it.
“Drink it, I promise it will make sense after.” Tom pleaded as he tried to keep calm. He watched Albus consider it for a moment. Then lowered the bottle to his side.
Draco pinching the bridge of his nose. “Harry, my love, that lives in Korea. No floo powder will keep us alight long enough to go that far. We’d be caught at the border anyways.”
Tom stopped his writing and put the quill safely away from the parchment as he looked up to give Bellatrix his full attention. She seemed to straighten under his gaze, satisfied with the added attention.
*fairy seats are something my sister came up with and shared with me so all credit for those go to her. trees make weird shapes sometimes, the idea is that a fairy seat is when the trunk or limbs curve into a seat shape and imagining that it was made to do that. I think it fits well with mushroom circles and other natural phenomena we like to relate to magic already.
“I’m offended.”
It was a normal morning despite the yelling going on through a few walls, but eventually the two black haired residents made their way to the dining table, where he sat in a corner in the reading chair Lupin had added at some point. They talked gently and laughed, it was clear Harry couldn’t see anything when he knocked something over unexpectedly and he snorted. The boy jumping and spinning around to make out Draco’s shape. It was like watching a squirrel find the cat stalking it as he froze in place and he laughed at the image.
“It’s not that I don’t want to be with Draco or Ron in their houses. What would help me be as capable as a wizard? Is there a skill like that?”
“If I must.” Draco smiled down onto his lap as he accepted.
The beating left him bruised and bleeding at the edge of school. He slept against the corner wall where they left him out of sight till twilight; he told himself it was because he was tired, but it was actually because he couldn’t move. Getting up he hobbled to the park down the road. A familiar swing set rocked back and forth with the autumn breeze.
“Oh, really? I see how it is.” They ribbed each other till Draco was finally ready to turn away and wipe his face.
Harry felt his feet weigh themselves down in place as his throat closed in panic. Did Draco know already? Was this how he found out Draco didn’t like him back? It wasn’t fair, he never got to even say anything. It was like Piers all over again.
The aftermath and the start of new things to come.
“Tom, you’ve been a busy one this summer, I wondered when I’d see you here. Have you thought about the counseling position opening up? I would always adore you being a bit closer.” He strolled down to sit in the chair opposite his guest. Tom slid closer and played with the loose stands of hair yet to be tied back that was tangling in Albus’ beard, a fond look overtaking his features.
“Met him in the muggle world. Got my uncles to adopt him after I found out about his relatives. They had him kept like a house elf, only house elves are treated better.” He whispered.
Draco began to shiver as he let the grip on his wrists tingle along his nerves, the mirror’s vision, the feeling of being contorted into place sent a bolt of lightning up his spine suddenly. He wanted more, but he couldn’t ask for it while Harry smothered a kiss onto his lips that felt a bit forced. Harry was clearly nervous and just as anxious to get going as he was. So, Draco did the only thing he could think of in that instance, he thrust up and whimpered as hard as he could, a rush of shame and embarrassment coloring his cheeks.
“Most wizards can’t speak to animals it’s a rare trait.” Draco waved at the air as if to wipe the option away. “What worries me most is the possibility that my Father could have something to do with this. He could ruin himself far before I get the chance. I thought getting her caught would have helped things. If Dumbledore dies because of him…”
“So where should we start?” He asked as he held the wisp up to the map hung up in bus stop box, taking a seat on the green public bench to wait. The blue ember floated about the page. When it was sure it suctioned onto the location It wanted them to go.
“W-what else be need’in me, Young Master?” Big cat like ears were flopping down submissively on Dobby’s skull.
Tom wasn’t sure when he’d tackled Albus into the bed he’d stood from, but here they were. Fresh laughter entered the room as two sets of hands, lacking the usual frail touch dug into his buttons and already revealed flesh as his shirt was pulled out of his waist’s secure tuck.
“No. I’m going to help you leave and they are never going to touch you again.” Draco answered calm but stern, it was final. “I don’t really have an excuse for doing this, but I’m a Malfoy, I’ll do what I like when it suits me.” He upturned his chin in superiority, the familiar gesture solidifying his words.
Draco seemed to contemplate this for a time. He had been surprised that Severus hadn’t broken them up to start picking again ages ago. His Godfather was still guarding them stoically and he was thankful for the attempt at privacy and patience on his part. He let himself imagine what would happen if he disappeared with Harry like he was asking. If he simply chose not to deal with the one-sided fight, he knew would come his way. How much worse would it be for him later?
“Fuck.” He whispered.
He would be there for Harry, but he could not let himself need him in return. That just would not do. He had to be in control of himself and the effects he was going to cause to everyone he loved. It was never something he was ever supposed to question and he had tried his best to this point to keep it that way. The sick feeling on the edge of his mind was just growing pains, they would go away. He had already bargained with himself enough, he had Harry, perhaps not all of him and never would, but that was the cost for it in the first place. He would stand resolute on that.
“It’s because I don’t know that I now find myself hiding here with you despite my original intentions.”
The vines that had gripped and tangled around Tom Riddle had almost crushed her beetle form and it had been the final straw for her. She was scuttling about in the dark and up into the trees for safety. The panic would likely stick with her even as she got back to write her story. Unfortunately, the plain fact that she had no way of finding her way out again was still present and mixed with the growing mania of being surrounded by what she saw were humanoid plants hunting every last intruder down.
Harry fought to breath steady as he lined himself up, appreciating and fearing the reaction of his partner that was staring down his cock like it was a snake ready to lunge. The sense of trust that displayed made him love this boy all over again as he rubbed his tip along the wrinkled folds of Draco’s entrance, circling it like he’d done with his finger before. He could see the way the cogs turned in Draco’s head at the motion, the instant he compared the two things and his eyes lit up. That was the signal for him, he pushed a bit and pulled away, doing this several times till he finally edged his way inside. Draco was practically vibrating now. Despite stretching him open Draco was so unbelievably tight, the head of his cock was inside and being crushed under the weight of a force unlike anything Harry had ever felt. Despite it only being this one small part of himself it felt like it was all consuming, the kneading muscles around him and his own desire pushing him forward for more.
“Ssshhh, hush baby. We’re sorry. He didn’t mean to scare you. We aren’t mad.” Sirius draped himself over his son’s chest as he slid himself to the floor beside the sofa. The added weight didn’t help his breathing but it did help the panic. “You aren’t in trouble… I love you Harry. You’re the child we always wanted, you have to know that, you have to.”
Lucius looked wild, disoriented and missing spells wildly with poor aim. To anyone else it seemed he was panicking. For now, it was all Tom could assume. He threw up a shield and kept it despite the lack of offense by his opponent, he had upended several others stances along the way to help his team take out the larger force.
Lucius couldn’t understand what he was doing, it was the feeling you get when you dreamed, unable to acknowledge the fact even when you noticed the difference and wanted control. His words rolled forth from his mouth before he knew what he was going to say.
“You’ll what? Disagree? You need me as much as I need you! You love me, we are bound and we will watch this world live and die together! We will! You promised me!”
“Won’t have to sneak off for a drink now?” Harry asked Draco fondly as he passed him his huge horn carved mug. “Is this stout?” He asked incredulously.
“What for?” Ron went to comply happily.
Tom watched as the rescue team pulled Harry and Narcissa out of the pit. His heart was somewhere in his throat. Mr. Milton, Roody’s partner, was busy working on the Auror’s mind or he would have taken it upon himself to help the young man. Moody regardless of his limp had rushed for Narcissa at the sight of her, his one goggled unblinking eye reading everything and he quickly snatched up the bottle she had concealed on her person as she shrieked new protests at him.
He ignored the portrait on the wall still watching him and allowed himself to cry once again for the loss of something that had never been his. It had always been a painful memory, the day everything seemed to change…
“This is why I don’t have children Padfoot, nothing but trouble. Not a drop of respect to share between them.” Moody groused to Sirius’ wagging tail end. The dog yipped in joy back at him between smelling the ground.
“Why no Christmas in the magical world?” Harry asked as he added a paper snow flake to a branch. Sirius had said something about that, earlier hadn’t he?
___________________________________________
“That sounds wonderful Harry.” Hermione smiled up at him as he unfolded the collapsed table by the windows ledge to place it on and wordlessly asking Ron at the same time to get his things out.
Harry was a mess, covered in rubble and some kind of confetti that seemed to be floating about the whole room once he noticed it. He was throwing what looked like black liquorish, Draco remembered the horrible stuff, it always bounced out of the bowl on Dumbledore’s desk when it wasn’t full of lemon drops. He could see where some had latched onto Bellatrix to bite and made her shake wildly to try and break them off. It would have been comical if not for the fact that Harry only had so much. A child throwing rocks at an oncoming car going fifty.
“Zanna’ll do just fine young’in. You’ll still be paying me for my work you know.” She looked at him pointedly. “We kinds, even Sylphs, have to have a bond shared. We detest trickery of the spoken word as we do not partake ourselves.” She spoke as she got up to rummage through her shelves.
“You better be sure of that.” Fudge spat, angry at Dolores and what this report would mean for them. “We can’t be wrong about this matter twice.”
“They don’t know I have access to the Black home since it’s hidden. Father is a traditionalist and Mother has done all she could to support him. Neither are bad on their own, but consider they are given the open opportunity to confront two individuals of abnormality in their strict no tolerance world, now imagine how that would go. Father would have you sent back to the muggle world for one thing if given the choice. He backed the segregationist movement from the beginning to keep a consistent position of power to maintain the family name and finance. I can’t trust either as a result when it comes to you or my Uncles well-being.” Draco kept writing as he talked, using it to distract him from what he was confessing to.
“One day left on your punishment you two. I’ll see you in class.” Snape left them to pat themselves down at the entryway.
“Believe this is yours.” His gruff voice shone with a rare satisfaction as he shoved the glass container to Tom’s chest.
“Can you remember where?” Tom was vibrating with renewed energy, Nagini hissing up a storm between everyone’s feet.
___________________________________________
“And you’ve hastened it end!”
“Harry Potter. No, there’s five of them and I live with one. You’re really not Dudley’s friend?” Harry seemed almost hopeful.
Harry was nothing if not persistent. A survivor. Under any circumstance he kept going and he was forcing himself more than ever now to stay still. The fidgeting had him shifting his eyes between Nagini and the book left open on the bed cover. Its large pages weighed down on one side while the other that held the Brownies illustration now free of hands had begun to lift up and flop over, a cascading effect resulted. Harry caught his breath when he looked at the new and imposing image on the revealed page.
Quiet between them was gently filled by the rustling of plant leaves since they had reached them, but with no wind all the way down here everyone was on edge and trying to see what was moving and how. Pomona might have known, should have known. If something that hadn’t been the challenge hadn’t tackled her the next second and into the dark maybe things would have worked out. As it was something like the hunched form of a person hidden in the black swept past everyone, pulling a scream from the herbology teacher.
“We shall see, you have chosen me for an enemy and I will make you pay. You will not live long enough to regret your err prince of nothing.”
Their bodies lowered to the stem base and their weight crushed the petals where they attached, but showed no signs of aggression at the loss.
I think this finishes up a first arc for the story. Harry is adopted and had a showdown and we've introduced a good amount of characters to build from. The next arc should be the start of Hogwarts and god willing our Draco/Harry relationship development.
“—He might start to like us.”
“Wizards!” Harry exclaimed in defeat through his laughing fit. Flopping on the sofa cushions he watched the two unwrap the box and Remus make the popcorn with a spell as he readied a string and thread to make a garland as his project.
“What’s wrong with you boy! Stop skulking!” Vernon spat through his mustache and scowled like he did every time he looked at him.
“Language.” It said again, the horrible lighting made it look like their face was slithering like worms as it spoke.
“Now there’s nothing stopping you from wanting me.” She declared as she kept her guard up. She watched Tom like a hawk for any signs of his answer.
“No, Harry, you are not a weakness. What I do for you is not a weakness. This is an alignment. Starting today I cannot go back without repercussions and I will have to accept the price of that. Whatever anyone tells you about me, I am on your side and your side alone from now on.” Draco set his jaw.
“About the dreams. I made sure, I told him to come down to talk to you as soon as I left to get what Tom lost.” Draco looked at them both hopelessly.
“No, I’m not asking. I get that I’m not in his league or whatever you wanna say. That’s not your choice and never was. You can either like it or get over it I don’t care which, but keep in mind he does.” Harry leaned back onto the wall when he was done, the awkward energy from the confrontation was only growing. Should he have just said that outright?
“Then we shall. Mercy will be our message. But I must suppress the threat, the others agree that a takeover will spare more lives. The muggles need guidance, like we promised to give. A man of my divining will be our leader amongst their kind. We will train him and show him what must be done to save them. Then, once the muggle world is united, they will have no one left to fight, making their weapons useless and gathering dust for all time. Should this change again we will be there.”
“You’re the one who had me worried!” Tom protested in mock rage as he grappled to earn a free hand and pull up Albus’ nightgown. He was blessedly unclothed beneath and tom’s smile turned to that of a wicked grin.
She looked forward to the news article Dolores would send soon for her about their work. There was only one person that could be to blame for what happened here tonight.
___________________________________________
He was actually looking forward to visiting them again next break to see how his refiling their cabinets went for them. He had felt and trampled over line after unsuspecting line of species-based exclusion and expectations it seemed and even when it was as simple as talking to a wizard, he couldn’t seem to do it how people thought he should. It wasn’t as bothersome as it was confusing in a sad way, that no one thought Draco was capable of caring, that Goblins or Gnomes were openly spoken about by the humans he’s ask as mean or greedy. It just clashed so much with the whimsical way everyone simultaneously painted visions about the magical word being…well, magical. So why was accepting others the hard part here? It had been his Dad’s concern for him. It had been Draco’s concern for himself. Harry just wasn’t too sure where he stood now, who he was against and with, in a game that’s been on the same match for centuries.
__________
“You’ve got to be kidding me.” Tom huffed as he went over the small gold engraving on the handle latch.
“We’re safe here…” Was all he said to the both of them as he tried to close his eyes, hands tightly wrapped around Harry to keep him there.
Draco had never heard something so utterly horrible; muggles really were the worst he snarled to himself. The doe eyed boy had wiped his tears away to keep looking at him, sense of wonder still there as he tried to take in Draco’s every detail. Something had to be done, he would see to that.
“Your girlfriend is awesome.” Harry whispered back to him before pulling him along.
“That’s what I said. I visit your dads then too. My parents think I’m visiting other friends though so don’t say anything please.”
He sat out in the grass, taking in the fresh air he could after a day of teasing at school from Dudley and his friends. He thought of them more often than not these days.
“Sirius.” Draco supplied.
Lucius felt a familiar yet foreign warmth in his chest. His smile overtook his face as he started filling a plate. He’d finally realized and told Severus the other day, he’d been forced to go to bed with a sick stomach after Snape had brushed him off. This was a step in the right direction and a chance for something he never knew he truly wanted.
“We weren’t even informed of this-visit!” Petunia shrilled.
The journey to the cornerstone. They find the starting point and work their way down.
“You sure?” Harry scrunch his brow.
Draco set the newspaper in the fireplace to burn as he fumed over his cup of tea. They weren’t together and she was already saying they were destined for a tragic love story. Bullshit. That viper never had anything good to say about anything. Besides, she wasn’t wrong about one thing, he was expected to be matched soon, and he knew It was expected of him. He couldn’t keep disappointing them more than he was already going to.
“And you speak to your future king and lord of lords. Clearly one of us is superior to the other.”
___________________________________________
“Yes, go on.” Albus urged, he was getting that mad glint in his eye again suddenly and it cut through the tension of the dark space.
“And you’re sure there wasn’t anything else?” Draco pressed; eyes ablaze.
“Do you understand how foolish this was?” He asked rhetorically as he began to lay into his student with a fiercely protective look coming to the surface. “Forget the obviously stupid stunts you’ve pulled. I told you to look after him like he was a first year, like every little kid that walks through those doors from the muggle world who now think they’re invincible. Those who act like it may be set straight by their immediate arrival to the nurse’s, but unlike those children who are given an adjustment period and a watchful eye from their heads of house; Mr. Potter is older and people will forget that he is still at that point of learning simply how to exist here. You are supposed to keep him from getting hurt, it is the second and, in my opinion, far more important reason he needs a partner going through Hogwarts.” Snape gasped for breath.
“Ms. Granger.” Draco attempted without looking at the girl in question who looked up from her book just enough to raise her eyebrow at him. The blonde glanced over at Harry with a look in his eyes that asked for help.
The late nights leading up to winter break...
Eventually the wisp turned to suction itself against another unremarkable wall adjacent another tapestry. The thought hit him as he pushed to open the hidden door, that every door here must be like that; marked somewhere else for the residence while thieves or invaders would never know there was a bunk or an office with sensitive information they could upturn. It looked like endless hallways, but they had passed several such tapestries, all themed and inconspicuous enough you’d never realize they were signs.
“Do you think she never got through the first door till we got through?” Tom raised a brow following the train of thought. “There were certainly shoe prints down the first flight of stairs, but after that I haven’t seen any. Both or either that and her being cloaked would certainly explain the lack of a trail for Sirius. Is that about, right?”
“A foundation.” Sirius answered unsure as soon as he said it. Remus huffed a loving chuckle. Harry shook his head.
“Up to you, I don’t need anything.” Draco shrugged.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, there’s another similarity. They’re huggers too.” He backed away awkwardly. “So, now you know. Just wait a bit and tell them everything even if it’s scary got it. The more they know the better.” Harry nodded with a shaky determination. As Draco turned to walk away, he added over his shoulder, “and I’m not nice... or kind.”
“Yes, he can sleep now, no concussion at all despite his best efforts.”
“Noted.”
“No, I don’t ‘know’. Whatever you’re implying better not be what I think or I’ll have you strung up to the chandeliers in the great hall. That muggle belongs to me, and I have no intension of opening hunting season on him. Do we understand.” He growled, his superiority barely covering his intentions for all but Harry. It was instantly reassuring, a calming balm on the fears.
The fact that the Lord Malfoy would never be his old self again had always been apparent, but the new realization that it had been caused and not something he chose was a new painful wound to Severus. Still, he felt perhaps worse at the bit of vindication, of hopeful proof that he had not been played with and thrown away. The thought that Lucius had suffered at least as much as he had. Maybe, Severus thought to himself, he was not a very good man after all.
“That was fast.” Harry relaxed completely into a light doze, easily disturbed by the hands grabbing him, shaking or holding and the feeling of the magic bind being lifted a second later.
“So how does some stranger come into it. She? Me?” He tried to bring it all back to that odd comment.
Harry was clothed in his imagination, having somehow taken his and now rubbed his denim fabric against the exposed hole he revealed as he had stretched his cheeks open. The back of his balls singing at the accidently contact made with the action.
___________________________________________
“You can see all that?” Harry whispers, his eyes trying to look up and only seeing the unmoving rim of the hat over his forehead.
He’d never been good at asking the young boy that had become the nearest thing to a son he and Albus had about… feelings. Severus had never been of the mind to share anyhow; he knew more than most how to enjoy companionable silence.
Harry wondered just how soon Tom and Remus would find him missing once they started looking for the snake or if they would just assume, she was planning to stay with them for the night. She had done it before and it was nice to have the attention she gave him. The thought had him flip open the now dog-eared section on reptiles, reading through the many kinds there were. A section on deals that had given people the speech of animals over the centuries kept him busy for the rest of the ride as his nerves churned.
“Are we really related?” Harry yelled over her and drew back her ire.
“—Harry Potter Black.” McGonagall called out sternly and he flushed, rushing forward to comply.
“Ghost fruit?” Draco signaled to be released.
__________
“Feel awkward yet?” Draco teased as they tried not to watch each other.
Draco shook the memory free of his head. It had been a halfhearted attempt, what he had tried to do. He supposed that was because he never wanted to do what he was told for once. He had no motivation to distance himself and every personal reason to get closer. His father had left things at that, but his intentions would shine through no matter what in the end, it was just a matter of how long Lucius would pretend not to see.
“That’s not important, Mother, what is all this?” Draco was forcing himself to slowly move his free hand to his wands holster without making it obvious. The movement going against every feeling he’d ever had for the person in front of him, but it was just so scary. She was herself, acting like always, so composed and perfect and gentle, but there was death hung like tapestry around them.
“I don’t expect it to either, but it’s an attempt.” He resignedly agreed. “They are willing to try. They listened too; I wouldn’t have pushed anything if I thought for a second that Draco could only stay friends with them as long as I stayed away. Otherwise I would have backed off for him.”
“You know why it was important though. Doesn’t mean it was wrong or right of us. I don’t want to either, I don’t think I can. It’s a good thing we only had to do it once to help them, right?”
“There’s only one of her. If he’s fighting her there then we’re safer over here while you go on ahead. I don’t think we all have to go the whole way, and I don’t want to be in the way.” Harry’s eyes were wide and genuine and it only took a second for Tom to steel himself barking the order to cut in half.
“Don’t you set a poor example for our son, slinging the ‘G’ word around like that.” Remus turned his mock disappointed look to the blonde who scoffed at the accusation.
“Gross, not in front of the kids Mr. Lupin.” Draco snatched a cup up and hid his scrunched nose behind it.
“So, you’re coming home with me?” He had to be sure. Harry felt an ache in his throat appear, the raw feeling of protective instinct still wrestling to keep him attached to the other.
“Of course, I have to keep an eye on you.” He answered just as stiffly.
“I don’t know what else you saw Draco, but the thing you found isn’t the one that will save Albus, Harry is more important in this case. I can put off retrieving my… well, let’s just leave things at that for now. I’ll message the ministry when I get the chance.” He left Draco like that, with Dobby looking up at him from the floor and Kreacher watching the two of them intently.
“Thank you.” He looked down at his lap. “Can Harry—”
“Zanna!” Harry exclaimed happily. He would have been tempted to hug her if not for everyone else standing in his way. He could tell she was amused by the glint in her eye.
“School invasion.” He said blandly, when Harry looked down, he saw that he was reciting the title of the front-page article. The picture was of Narcissa being dragged through the ministry with a stern frown on her face.
In a moment worse than the wind throwing him he was twisted up and rearranged with a crackle of sound back into the alley he came from, stiffening at the pain on his back till it subsided to a throb. Nagini was there, now on top of him and licking his face with a flick of that thin forked tongue and locking eyes with him. It was hard to tell without facial expressions, but he was sure she must have been worried.
