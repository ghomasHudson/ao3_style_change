The image that finally downloaded was of Harry’s side and the end of a dragon’s tail just above his hip bone. Or maybe a snake? A sea serpent? What else had a tail like that?
“I think I do. Well enough.” His head turned and Draco wished they had more light so he could appreciate the green of Potter’s eyes. “I could if you’d let me.”
Pansy offered to take Orion upstairs for an afternoon nap. “Did I hear Potter say the others were invited back to Hogwarts?”
My fingers slide into copper curls to yank his head back. I hiss in his ear, "Do you trust me, Snow?"
Thankfully he had friends willing to help with mischief. He wrote a short note to Draco and gave it to Ron to give to Hermione. She could slip it to Draco in Arithmancy, where Theo wouldn’t see.
Draco stiffened, wondering why he needed to be singled out, and bounced Annie in his arms. “I think Annie and I are going to sit this one out.”
They gathered stares during their entire walk through the hospital. Potter waved cheerily at two witches deep in a gossipy stance. He whispered to Draco, “Bet you ten galleons tomorrow’s
But what really caught Draco’s gaze was the eyeglasses. Gone were the simple wire frames Harry had taken to wearing in recent years. Instead, he had the chunky black frames he used when they first started dating.
The older Auror stepped closer. “I’m Auror Blakely, and this is Auror Reed.” He held a scroll through the bars. “We’ve a warrant to check Malfoy Manor and the surrounding grounds for evidence of suspicious werewolf behaviour.”
And he did, flushed with arousal and eyes shining so brightly. Harry ran his hands up and down the tender skin of Draco’s thighs as Draco fucked into his own fist. His head dropped back, exposing the long column of his neck, dotted all over with tiny lovebites from their holiday fun.
He stepped back and felt his muscles coiling in tighter and tighter knots as he waited for their reaction.
Even if Harry thought this was the hottest thing he’d ever seen. He imagined the pink flush spilling across Draco’s cheeks and throat as he spluttered through a nervous explanation. And then his mind helpfully shifted that into a soft post-orgasmic glow instead. Harry groaned softly as his cock throbbed over that image.
“I would let you,” Harry said, offering him the mittens. “It’s still cool enough that you can wear them sometimes.”
“Yes.” Blaise’s smug grin was back in place. “And by the way, I’m keeping my bribe, seeing as I did my part.”
Potter flashed his lopsided grin. “No, you’re right, he’s an arse.” He absently ran his thumb along the rim of his mug. “Makes it easier to leave the Aurors behind.”
Draco shook his head with an eyeroll and hurried away before Potter thought to ask about the muggle clothing Draco wore. At home, the flying gear was welcomed with great enthusiasm and they immediately set up flying lessons and an impromptu Quidditch match for the little kids.
Harry’s whole body vibrated with the need to come. He didn’t know how much longer he could stand the tight, hot press of Draco all around his cock, and the soft moans Draco let out as he rested his head against the window.
Ron had a moment of panic that his daughter wouldn’t recognise him. “She’s probably too young to notice, right?” Or so he hoped. Anyway, it was only the one night. “We were talking about crashing at Harry’s to avoid any weirdness at home.”
“I didn’t sleep last night. I—I’m a little…” He turned to Weasley. “Do you happen to have—I need something to wake me up. Do you have any Wide-eye or just—something like it?” He reached into his pocket and pulled out wizarding coins and a few muggle notes. “I can pay.”
Harry hardly worried about their NEWT exams the last week of May. The eighth years were tested early so they could be dismissed from school, leaving the examiners free to concentrate on the fifth and seventh years on the usual schedule. That meant he only had one more week in early June to think of something to keep Draco by his side instead of losing him to Malfoy Manor.
He loved this ride into the village. Learning to ride the bike had been a challenge, but well worth it for trips into town. Moments alone and away from the cheerful chaos of his home were rare enough. And he suffered less anxiety in the muggle village than he did the wizarding areas.
“Do you want me to touch you? To savour every inch of your body?” He nuzzled along Harry’s neck. “Do you want the heat of my mouth any place in particular?” Harry made a garbled sound that had Draco smiling against his skin. “I would, if you asked me. Lick you, taste you, make you come so hard… Is that what you want?”
“We could transfigure it a little, if you like. Soften the ridges and make it a little thinner at the base?” Draco offered. But he could see Harry’s reluctance didn’t ebb with the suggestion. “Or… if you like…” He ran a hand slowly down Harry’s bare torso and teased the open waistband of his jeans. “We could pretend your brilliant husband chased off that horrible squid to enjoy your bath in peace. Of course, I’d have to check
“That’s a very good goal, Harry,” Hermione said softly, slipping her hand around his waist again. Some of the tension unspooled from Harry’s shoulders.
Almost shyly he would tweak Draco’s fingers in passing or bump their knees together at the dinner table. At the next film night (
They didn’t count the days. Not officially and not out loud. But a long-standing habit had Harry checking the calendar occasionally. And he couldn’t help but note when their marriage reached thirty-one days.
He tried not to crow at Theo’s sour look. “It’s fine,” Theo bit out. “I can skip it for a few weeks.”
“There’s always going to be loads of responsibilities heaped on you. Don’t you have some sort of eight year plan? I can wait eight years. We can be friends in the meantime.” He gave Draco’s fingers a squeeze. “Or, we can work around our obstacles, just like other couples do.”
“Well if it means sex with my very favourite person, I suppose it can’t be all bad.” He winked at Harry. “I can’t wait until tomorrow.”
A flash of movement caught Draco’s eye, drawing his gaze towards their bedroom ceiling. “Harry!” he yelled back. “What the fuck is a mirror doing on our ceiling?”
“Erm, no. This one actually requires a portkey.” Harry left for the sitting room and came back with—
“Fuck! Okay, it’s fine.” He scanned the parchment, but the words blurred. “We can get him back. Do you know where they took him?”
Harry hadn’t even opened his eyes on Saturday morning when he registered the rain splattering against the windows of his room.
Draco laughed and helped Harry out of his jeans, if lightly stroking Harry’s hardening cock over his pants could be counted as helping. “I think I remember how they all go,” he said without rolling his eyes at his silly husband.
They briefly considered putting a bed in the spare room, but quickly decided they didn’t want any of their friends crashing for more than a night. They could handle the occasional kip on the sofa but a bed implied someone could become a third flatmate and neither of them were ready for that.
“Exactly. Nowhere else to go. So perhaps they’re looking for a way to let us keep them, seeing as no one else wants them.”
“Is that… something you do often?” Potter stretched out his legs, crossing them at the ankle, in a pose of nonchalance. But there was careful intent in his tone.
“No,” Draco said, swallowing heavily. His thumping heart made his cheeks redden. “No, of course not. It’s just… so different.” One more button and the shirt hung open to Harry’s waist. Was he imagining that slight tremble in his fingers as they pushed the shirt from Harry’s shoulders?
Draco ignored whatever Potter might be implying and shook off his unease. If Potter hadn’t set the Aurors on them yet, perhaps he meant what he said. Maybe his influence could get the paperwork filed properly. But just in case, Draco wasn’t going to worry anyone at home about it.
Bracing himself carefully on either side of Draco’s hips, Harry leaned forward and let his lips hover where his fingers had been moments before. They tingled and buzzed as his tongue darted out to almost tease the head of Draco’s cock.
My first glimpse was a tiny flash as he pulled off his school jumper, just there and gone before I even knew it. It took four days of scheming around his showering schedule to be in the right place at the right time to verify what I
“I want your body under mine. I want to feel your movements along every inch of my skin. I want you moaning in my ears and your nails digging into my back.”
“I’m deadly serious. This is the problem with getting married between our birthdays. We don’t get to do fun stuff like this the rest of the year.”
Harry pumped furiously at his cock, a slow flush creeping down his chest. Draco smiled, knowing the end was near. He licked along his lips and flicked his tongue at Harry playfully.
Slowly Potter rose from his chair and pointed at Draco’s seat. “Do you mind if I…? Can I sit with you?”
The accompanying picture, of Harry in the produce aisle at his local grocery, looked so unremarkably mundane, he didn’t even know why they printed it.
“Actually today’s theme is meant to be Parseltongue but I thought that was stupid so I ran with the idea of a foreign language.”
Following Harry out of the common room, Draco said, “I was exhausted and went to bed early. I didn’t even make it to midnight.”
His heart stuttered when Ginny came in alone. Good, Harry thought with a mental sigh, because he already had enough on his plate with meeting Draco for the first time in a million years. He didn’t need to add ‘playing nice with his ex’s new boyfriend’ as well.
“I don’t remember but one of my wines had cherries in it.” He collapsed on the bed when Draco pulled back the duvet.
“And anyway,” Ginny went on, “why would a dog and a cat get married? Aren’t dogs and cats supposed to hate each other?”
“Challenge accepted.” Harry stood, pulling Draco along with him. “Let’s get naked and we’ll use a light incarcerous to tie our hands together. My right to your left. I guarantee by the end, you’ll be screaming my name.”
Draco let magic build in his hand and then zapped Harry’s cheek with it. “You know I have my ways.” But that only made Harry giggle all the harder. “What are you doing here and why did you have to scare the life out of me?”
When congratulations died down and everyone returned to decorating, Draco asked him quietly, “I suppose Auror Blakely didn’t take too kindly to that disarming stunt?”
I hate displays of my vampire abilities and all the ways they point to me not being fully human. Although I might have to rethink that if it gets Simon this hot.
Harry dug in the basket and found two straws. He handed one to Draco saying, “Using the straw, you have to suck up a marshmallow and move it from one plate to the other.”
“Mandrakes. I’ll let the lab know, so they can verify before we treat him.” The healer indicated the bed. "Try not to jostle him too much, but you can hold his hand if you like. It won’t damage the stasis spells.” He nodded to Potter and Draco, then pulled the curtain closed behind him.
At Draco’s nod, Harry apparated them across town. Harry had been far more nervous about Draco visiting his flat that first time. At the time, Draco thought it was fear of moving too fast as well. But in hindsight, Draco wondered if it was because of how crowded and full Draco’s flat was, compared to Harry’s sparsely decorated flat.
Harry giggled as he closed the door to one of the compartments. “Want to call me Potter and I’ll call you Malfoy?”
Harry pulled out the contract and waved it at Theo. “It says that at both formal and casual ‘repast,’ we may sit next to one another, so long as we ‘leave a handbreadth of space for the honour of our ancestors’ between us.” Harry rolled his eyes at the wording. “That means I can sit next to Draco.”
The prompt was "based on a meme" and I chose the one about daring to kiss, except it's butter because it's Simon and that's funny. Especially when Cleo showed me a picture of how butter is sold in the UK.
“Please,” Harry scoffed, “Ron and I just call that shit even and move on. We’ve saved each other too much to bother keeping track.”
Draco’s small, nervous smile grew into something softer as they shook hands. “Steadfast. At long last.”
Pansy whirled on him, panic in her eyes, “Are you serious right now? How are we going to take care of an infant? What are we going to feed him?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Potter, you imbecile… If we get caught, I’m claiming you threatened my life. What were you hoping for here?”
“Tonight we play with…” Harry brandished a colourful tentacle dildo that Draco hadn’t seen in a million years. “The Giant Squid!”
Potter pointed to the train. “Seeing Hermione off. She and Neville wanted to get here early to help monitor the children.”
printed in their Wednesday Potter Watch column. Nearly a decade after the war ended and people still wanted to know what he was up to. Sure, tell everyone Harry enjoyed muggle Hobnobs and saw a film with Ron and Hermione on Saturday. Let the whole world know that Harry had been issued new boots for his Auror uniform. None of that mattered to Harry now that he had this shiny secret to keep all to himself.
Draco threw a stasis charm over the shopping bags. “They’ll keep. Let’s get naked and I’ll show you how much I need every last inch of you.”
Draco choked down another bite with a large gulp of tea. “I never thought I’d be sick of cheese toasties. I love cheese.”
Harry stroked Draco’s hair, and rubbed circles down his back. “Admittedly, you came back to a dreary situation. It’s not like that anymore. Now it’s a place you would have been happy to return to. It’s going to be fine. You’ll see. Come on, let’s go wait by the gates. The sun will perk you up.”
Harry’s eyes shone with the bright light of a challenge. “Yeah. Yes, I can,” he said, his voice smooth and seductive. “Of course I can.”
“What if…” Harry leaned back and swallowed heavily. “What if this is the last first kiss we’ll ever have?”
They had a nice time walking the bustling streets together. They got a few double takes and Harry saw several fingers pointing, but Harry went ahead acting as though they were any couple enjoying the spring weather. Harry liked hanging out with Draco outside of their lessons and common room. Seeing him smile made his heart beat faster and Harry just wanted to giggle like a mad fool about it.
“Unbelievable,” Draco whispered. The boys crowded around, helping Draco to line them up on the attic floor.
The common room sofa wasn’t as comfortable as Harry’s bed but had the added thrill of feeling illicit, even though they knew the eighth year suite was empty for the next five days.
“It’s fine. It’s a reality we’re all living with. We can’t avoid it forever.” Draco tucked his hands into the pockets of his jeans. “The children enjoyed having you here.”
All these weeks, trying to use his friends’ wands… trying to feel the magic that used to rise to the surface so easily… He thought Azkaban had burned it all away.
Relieved and exhausted, Draco managed to nap for two hours before Annie snuck away from her minders and poked him in the eye to wake him up for a morning walk.
“What are you reading?” Draco asked innocently, abandoning his textbooks for the sofa next to Harry. Theo, sighing, had no choice but to follow.
“Unless one of us is hiding a uterus up our arses, no.” Draco leaned back against the door with a warm smile. “Now… it’s just you and me here.” He sauntered forward and almost reached for Harry. “You brilliant boy. Have you figured a way around the chastity spells too?”
“Mr Potter, it is my pleasure to accept your courtship of my son.” Her eyes met Draco’s but before either of them could say anything, the door to the office opened.
“I don’t want to though.” Harry traced the back of Draco’s hand and up his wrist, teasing the sensitive skin there. “I like touching you and being touched by you. I don’t want either of us restrained like that and then it’s all… Disconnected.” Harry laced their fingers together and curled into Draco’s side.
Draco stepped out of the shower, eager to see what clothes Harry had left for him for their ‘Throwback Thursday’ date.
The lift doors dinged. Draco braced them open with his foot. “If we find an adult to support our cause, you’ll let us have Orion back?”
He tried to recall the night he’d asked Draco on a date. He’d been so confused and flustered then. Vaguely he remembered Draco’s odd comment about a betrothal contract but it slipped away in the excitement of their first date. Was Draco just playing with Harry until something real and better came along?
Tears filled her eyes as she shook her head. “Back to the Ministry, I suppose? Another foster home? I don’t know.”
“I can see that. Come sit down.” Draco helped him to the sofa and then immediately had to fend off Harry’s octopus arms trying to attach to every piece of him. “Harry,” he laughed, “this is why you’re not allowed to drink. You get clingier than a grindylow.”
And then he had Potter showing off his phoenix colouring sheet and asking if he could hang it on the bulletin board with the other colouring sheets and watercolour paintings the children had done.
bumping of hips and elbows, and the occasional groan of frustration that might be considered obscene if someone else heard him.
“Not really. I didn’t think any witch would make it this far and so never bothered to read any of the terms. I think it’s another three months. And I think it allows for hand holding. Certain promises are made so that even if the marriage doesn’t happen, no damage is done to either party.”
Granger pursed her lips and nodded at Potter, who stuck his shrunken robes in his pocket. She turned to the note-taker. “Mr Talpin, if you could please take note of Malfoy’s request, Harry’s compliance, and Auror Blakely’s protests. We’ll record the children’s reactions for the final report to the Minister.”
She shrugged and leaned in to whisper to Draco, “He basically invited himself and I didn’t know how to say no.”
Draco bucked up hard, surprising Harry enough that he could roll them across the floor and pin Harry to the ground. Draco rubbed their noses together and stole a laughing kiss.
Harry mentally sighed. How long could they play this game? He didn’t want to start another argument about the confusing double standard of celibacy before marriage and the allowance of rampant infidelity after. Wasn’t monogamy better? He rubbed at the ache building behind his eyes. Maybe it was just the weariness of the back and forth between life debts and the in-between.
Harry told the story of a sweet muggle recognising him—as James, not Harry—at Tesco, and regaling him with the tale of a mock wedding her granddaughter put on to marry Molly Meow to Peter Pup.
With a defeated sigh, he scraped the mess into the rubbish bin. It was fine. He still had the chocolate sauce and ice cream. That would have to do. At least Draco was a little late and wouldn’t see him breaking down over failed brownies.
Seeing Draco in his formal robes made Harry’s heart flutter. Damn, his boyfriend was gorgeous! He loved seeing Draco so posh and put together, knowing what his sleepy morning face looked like with his hair sticking up everywhere. Hopefully in a few weeks, he could have that all the time. Courtship sucked, even if he couldn’t say so out loud. He didn’t need any more ‘I told you so’s.’
Draco had ‘I told you so’ written all over his face. “We get two supervised half hour visits per week in a private setting. Otherwise, we are to remain ‘in the public eye.’”
“You did really well, Malfoy. I’m impressed.” Potter put his Trainee robes on but didn’t button them.
But Harry barely heard it over the thundering rush of blood through his body. He sat up on his knees, unfastening his jeans and stroking himself madly. Draco’s last moans echoed through Harry’s body, and what a delightful picture he made, all flushed and sated. It didn’t take long for Harry’s come to add to the mess on Draco’s belly.
“You are so clever.” Harry kissed him again, more soundly this time. And his hand landed on Draco’s thigh with a soft squeeze.
“Harry...“ Draco climbed off the bed, reaching for a green pair of knickers in the pile of spilled laundry. “What is this?”
“Yeah, I mean we’ve been eating on it for weeks without problems, right?” Harry set the bag on the worktop and began pulling out containers.
His cock hardened as the hot shower drove the chill away. He gave himself a few quick strokes, wondering what to do next.
“Harry, I did everything they wanted. We did everything right. Courting and asking about a betrothal. It’s only their own stubbornness and prejudice that won’t let us get married. If you were a woman we’d never have had this much trouble.”
As soon as his body felt under his control again, he stormed into the room next door, determined to get some answers. He found Harry making faces in the mirror. Of course he was.
Annie gripped Draco all the harder, almost whimpering into his neck. Unfazed, Ms Coddle turned to Daria, holding tightly to Daphne’s hand. “How about you?” She knelt down with a gentle smile. “Do you like staying here?”
The extra potion knocked him back into focus, and he rolled through the floo to the Ministry. He stopped first in Charity Commissions.
Draco let out a smothered, incredulous giggle with more than a hint of hysteria. “Don’t you dare! Don’t you
“Yup, that’s doing the trick,” Harry said. Two minutes later, he sheepishly emerged from the bathroom. “Okay so… I think I like Draco.”
“Right, how silly of me. Twenty-six days until there are forty-two more days,” Draco said with a small, secret smile for Harry. “The food better be amazing.”
He leaned into a deep stretch and ruffled his hair. “Damn, I forget how heavy she is.” He fluffed the t-shirt that clung to his damp skin. “Hot, too. As soon as she wakes up, bring her to my study. I don’t want her panicking, all right?” Marrin nodded and sat with her book next to Annie’s pallet.
“Oh, is it early? I’m sorry. Just a little excited, I suppose.” His smile fell as he smoothed his hands down his crisp waistcoat. “Is it all right? I can go if you like.”
Draco stepped back with a wicked smile. “Good. Have fun in Defence!” He gave Harry a cheeky wave and a wink, then hurried off to Potions class, leaving Harry hard and wanting.
After so long together, Harry knew Draco didn’t mean it to disparage muggles. He meant that muggle ceremonies had no place in the wizarding world. But that wasn’t entirely true.
They’d both taken the afternoon off for this, even though neither of them could imagine it would feel like anything more than either a silly school exercise or something reminiscent of battles they’d long put to rest. Why was this on a list of kinky activities? Although Draco did have hopes to turn it into one.
“I know it was a weird thing to do,” Harry said evenly. Draco didn’t ask but Harry felt the need to explain anyway. “The thing is… Everything, and I mean
“That flush in your cheeks and the sweat in your hair. Who’s to say if it’s duelling or fucking, right? But it’s not quite the same in
Mrs Stokke ended the enchantment on her quill and gathered all her things. “Appeals to the Wizengamot’s decision may be made within sixty days.” And without further word she swept out of the room.
“Not really. We’ll just see what happens.” When Draco opened his mouth to suggest something—probably snogging again, the sly tempter—Harry put a finger over his lips. “Breakfast first. I’m hungry.”
“Yeah, you try casting that spell eighty times a day and then we’ll talk.” Draco opened the file drawer of his desk and pulled out a stack of slender files. “These are for the children. What we know of their past, their family connections, any physical or mental health concerns.” He handed Granger a larger file. “This one is financial. What we’ve spent so far on food, clothes, and so on. Pansy put together some projections on the coming years. An eight year plan.”
Harry grinned as they turned into the Great Hall. “I can’t stop thinking about what I’d name the dogs. Like funny little pairings. I love animals named for food so I thought of something like Salt and Pepper.”
“Probably because your brain is caught on your wood. Go take care of it and then come back to bed with me.”
“Money isn’t a problem,” Draco said, thinking of the vast Malfoy vaults the Ministry miraculously let him keep. Perhaps it helped that he gave them nearly all of the Lestrange vault. “It’s our reception in Diagon, and what the kids might face at school that worries me.”
“Oh, wow. But sorry, I keep interrupting. Go on.” Potter, the bastard, had a twinkle in his eye and Draco could see that he was dying to laugh. Mustering as much dignity as he could, wrapped in a towel and talking about his ridiculous tattoo, Draco continued.
When they pulled back from each other, Harry gave Draco a wry smile. "You look like you might fall asleep standing there."
Once the house-elf had left them, Potter poured the tea as though it were perfectly normal for him to serve tea from a bone-china teapot. Given the raggedy collection of mugs at Potter’s workshop, Draco doubted it.
Potter smiled. "Great. And thanks. I was going to share mine with you, but that would be easier. If you don’t mind waiting for me to make it." He paused, as though weighing up what he wanted to say next. "Lighting fires with wood from a tree is tricky."
“In a simulation? Untested?” Hestia raised an eyebrow. Harry flushed, because put like that it did seem a little risky.
“Him?” Harry moved closer and draped an arm across Draco’s shoulders. “We’re pissed. Or pissing. Just had a few drinks. He’s alright. So just leave him alone, ‘kay?” Seamus looked between the two of them, and shook his head. He muttered something under his breath as he turned away, but Harry really didn’t care: it seemed that his bladder, too, was now fairly insistent about the pissing thing.
"No, I can see that. I bet you will though. You never could resist a bit of Malfoy mystery." Hermione waggled her fingers like a Muggle magician, dripping water on to her sleeve, and Harry laughed.
Before he knew it, half his desk was covered in small cogs and the quiet of the room was punctuated by muttered swear words. Some of Draco’s phrases were quite creative, and Harry smiled to himself as Draco’s hand slipped again and
“I’m a lot better now,” Harry said. “I’ve practised with Luna and Hermione, and I’ve not trodden on their feet once.”
What if… he liked men, the way he had thought he liked women? What if he liked one, but not the other? What if he liked both?
“Stubborn? Is that the best you can do?” Harry said, scornful of such a pathetic insult. Malfoy stared at him, eyes pale and light-filled.
Luna brought Harry lunch, and stayed to eat with him as they chatted through her investigations. Harry chewed carefully on the surprise sandwich she had made for him: the surprise, apparently, was that she’d put anything she fancied into it. The first bite of cooked apple had been somewhat interesting, especially combined with a large chunk of raw onion.
"I… Oh!" She looked between the two of them, then sat in the nearest chair. "You’re here. I…" Words seemed to fail her.
“Good morning, sleepyhead.” Henry appeared at the end of the bed with a small tray bearing fresh tea and some of the pastries Draco had brought home the day before. “I thought I’d let you sleep a little longer.”
And then, in the most galling development of all, it appeared that the more Harry tried, the more mistakes he seemed to make, while Malfoy out-performed everyone. He barely spoke to anyone, and would just turn up each and every day, and do brilliantly. Harry had overheard Su and Megan talking about him, insinuating that Malfoy was cheating or buying his way through the course, but you only had to look at him, wand in hand, tracing a line of fire through the air or turning out a perfect antidote to some poison or another, to know that he was simply good at everything.
In his dream, Draco is flooded with warmth. He wakes though, to a flood of tears. Her absence aches, deep inside him, and he screws his face up as he cries for his mother. He opens his eyes when he feels a touch, feather-light, on his arm. Potter is crouching by his bed, his face all blue and shadows under the faint lantern light. Potter touches his arm again, more firmly this time. He holds on, until Draco raises his eyes and meets his gaze.
“I usually stay in my room. I only came downstairs tonight because I’d heard you do it on other nights.”
“The stone came from a quarry just south of London: it has since been built up as the town of Little Whinging. Sadly ever since the town has had a propensity for sink holes.”
, whatever that was. The nearest he’d ever felt to home had been at school, but even then he’d known it wouldn’t be forever. Seeing the older students leave each year had made that clear.
“Not yet, sir,” said Draco, earning him another mutter from Potter. “There’s still every possibility that we could end up at that point.”
“Also, I just… I have this feeling. A gut feeling.” Draco felt Potter squirm beside him. “I don’t think you’re quite the person you were at school. And I don’t think you were as awful as you made out, even then.”
“I’m sure they don’t care whether I’m wearing velvet or jeans,” said Harry. “And if anyone asks, I can just say that I’ve dressed up as a Muggle.”
Once Harry had gone back into the field, Draco had become more and more convinced that his job was incredibly dangerous. Most of it was paperwork, but Draco wouldn’t believe him.
He’d been able to find his way to Paris, but after this Draco would need more of a plan. Having a plan was what Draco would normally do, not leaping onto a broomstick like some reckless Gryffindor, so Draco bought a map of France, before stopping in a small sandwich shop nearby. A counter ran against one wall, with three stools wedged beneath. This would be enough for his needs, and he got himself something to eat, along with another coffee, then spread the map out on the narrow counter.
"I think he was a bit worried about his reception at St Mungo's," said Harry, "and I guess he knew that he could get hold of Parkinson." Hermione frowned but nodded. Despite whatever oath Healers swore, it wasn't outside of the realm of possibility that one of their Slytherin contemporaries would be treated with suspicion, especially if accompanying a wounded war hero.
"Your mum told me you were safe," said Greg. "Don’t worry, I haven’t been sitting up nights worrying about you."
“You can have my one, if you want,” Harry said. “Not gnat’s piss. Although,” he added thoughtfully, “Malfoy’s tea is actually really nice.”
Harry didn’t particularly want to share that often Mrs Weasley, or once, Ginny, took a pair of scissors to it. He’d never cared too much about how it looked, having long resigned himself to it being a bit of a crow’s nest.
When he got outside, he heard a snatch of laughter through the trees, and wondered again what Harry was doing. Had they… could they have wanted to go off to talk about the terrible Draco Malfoy? What were they saying?
Draco saw his father, clean shaven and… well, not smiling. Grimacing, more like, but he looked as though he was aware of what was happening around him. Present. He stood at Narcissa’s side, and put his arm around her. Then Harry appeared at Draco’s side, the comforting presence of a hand pressed to the small of Draco’s back bringing a smile to his face.  As the vision faded, Draco was left in the dusty expanses of the dining room at the Manor, the usual feelings of regret and pain swirling as he tried to remain calm. This room held too many memories: he didn’t need any extra ones.
Her note was brief. He was to meet her in Hogsmeade, near the Shrieking Shack. Draco rolled his eyes when he read it, because it was such a childish meeting place, but he scrawled back an answer that he would be there. He wanted to know what she had found out.
“Well, fine, but I think you need to do a bit of growing up.” Harry didn’t say anything, and his tea was nearly finished. Before he could get up though, Hermione touched his arm again. “Look, just… we’ve all been through a lot, Malfoy included. People can change, remember that.”
On Halloween itself, Ron had somehow managed to wangle an invite to the Weasley’s party for everyone, including Greg. Ron, Hermione, Luna – even Greg – had all dressed up, but Harry didn’t really see the point. “They’re like family.”
When they’d almost reached the point at which they could Apparate away, Potter stopped to get his breath back and rest his leg. He sat on a fallen tree and rubbed at his knee. He looked pale even with the slight touch of colour the walking had given him.
“And she’s been selling them on the Muggle market quietly, for years.” Draco looked at Potter. “Do you still have those Auror links?”
And they were unlikely to let him in now, were they? Having slept with Harry wouldn’t make any difference. Fighting a battle with Claire and Stephen hadn’t.
“You need to talk to him properly. Whatever happens next isn’t foreordained or written in the stars. It’s up to you, now. I think the curse is gone. Whatever’s left is down to you, and Harry.”
It was a pity really, that Draco didn’t have more strength or he could have found something to throw at Potter. He counted to ten to see if that helped, and he did feel slightly calmer.
None of these things explained why Malfoy had crept out of bed at night, or what he was doing in the burned-out husk of the Room of Requirement.
Ron groaned. “Not at the table,” he said, as a large tome floated down the stairs and landed on the table next to Hermione.
Harry rolled away, uncomfortable at the line his thoughts were taking. The familiar itch across his skin, the tightness between his shoulders was returning; the sensations he associated with waking from his nightmares.
The group had divided along loose House lines, Harry noticed. Ron and Neville, along with Ernie, were the ones roaming around and exploring the room, while Hermione and the Ravenclaws - Anthony, Lisa, and Padma - were looking at the books on the bookshelves by the door. Parvati, Hannah and Susan were sitting on one of the sofas, talking fast and turning to look around them all at once.
It was all such glorious bollocks, and fun to be the famous Harry Potter while being nobody at all at the same time. Harry smiled as climbed the stairs to join Draco and his group. He squeezed Draco on the arm, wondering how anyone in the group could possibly mistake them for anything other than lovers when Draco’s face lit up in a dazzling smile in response.
“I’m not the only one,” Harry said. Yellow flames were licking at the log now. Hopefully it would catch properly soon.
Malfoy was still on the sofa, staring at the TV almost as though he didn’t really see it. He turned to face Harry, then swore. “What the fuck are you doing?”
Harry smiled back, albeit a little uneasily, because Kingsley might be the Minister for Magic but he was also a friend. “So what can I do for you?” he asked, cringing internally that he hadn’t yet learned not to ask that question. He comforted himself with the thought that he still had time to refuse any request, though.
Hot breath touched his face, then warm lips were pressed to his. They were hungry and fierce, seemingly ready to devour him. Overcome, Harry froze, but then he pushed Malfoy away with his hands, because… because this wasn’t what was supposed to happen. Malfoy though, didn't push back. Instead he deepened the kiss, his hands moving into Harry's hair and pulling Harry closer. It was excruciating: the way his scalp tingled and his body sang to be finally pressed up against Malfoy like this, the way a shiver of lust wrapped around him. But it was the ball of hate he always carried with him which twisted within Harry, and somehow he managed to push Malfoy away.
“It’s OK,” Harry said. The time to talk it all through seemed to have faded away. “We don’t need to go through all that again.”
“It took me a while to be able to admit any of this to myself.” Harry took in a shaky breath. He felt all wobbly all of a sudden, and had to steady himself on his rock. “Um, if you don’t mind, that’s enough questions for now.”
“Oh, for… Merlin’s bum cheeks! Are you sure that curse the other week didn’t do something funny to your brain?”
On the first Thursday of term, Harry made his way to the Room, wanting to see how it was, but also hoping that Malfoy would have had the same idea.
Harry watched Draco pop the sweet in his mouth and begin to suck. Harry’s breath seemed to get stuck in his throat at the sight. Beside him he could hear Anthony crunching his sweet, unaware of the cruel beauty of seeing a Malfoy suck on a boiled sweet. Draco was, Harry suspected, making more of a meal of it than needed. It was working, too: Harry’s breath seemed to get stuck in his throat at the sight.
Washing up brought a simple joy to him, and Harry wondered whether this was all he’d needed to break free of his unhappiness. All that time feeling miserable: if only he’d taken the time to wash up a bowl and a mug or two, he’d have been fine. He smiled sadly at the thought, because he knew it wouldn’t have been enough.
Draco had liked him. Harry had forgotten an important conversation. And now? Harry didn’t know. Whatever might have been, the moment had passed. Maybe he could salvage a friendship out of this mess. He thought back on everything that Draco had said to him, not just the night before, but also over the past few weeks.
The image came to Harry of Draco with his bum sticking out of the cupboard. It was a very nice bum, all pert and lovely. Why it had to be attached to such a frustratingly opaque man, he had no idea. He stood by the shelves, hand stilled mid-wipe, thinking about Draco.
“Me too. Only none of my friends know. Or at least, I don’t think that they do,” Potter said, all in a rush. He fetched a tin from his desk.
“You don’t think it’s pointless as I’ll not be here that long?” Dudley had been vague about his return date. The odd postcard had arrived from various corners of Europe, and Harry didn’t know how much further his cousin planned to travel.
“I was thinking.” Malfoy looked younger somehow, and it took Harry a moment to work out that it was because Malfoy was shy.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a tall, solidly built man walk through the door, see them, then turn and run. Beside him, Draco heard Potter rise.
“That makes sense,” Ron said. “But I guess we won’t know if he doesn’t talk.” He shrugged. “Can’t say I’m too bothered one way or the other. I think I’ve done my bit.”
Potter sighed. “I don’t see Seamus much anymore. Mostly I see Ron and Hermione. And Luna, of course.”
Granger looked pained. “I think that’s a dangerous path to tread, Draco. Pansy’s right. This curse, whatever it is, it’s intended to drive you mad or torture you. It’s very possible that any, er, growing feelings may be part of that.”
“Floundering,” Malfoy answered honestly.  “I apprenticed with an apothecary to become a Potions Master.  But the prospect of owning my own shop was a bit overwhelming.  In the meantime, I needed a job and a place to live.  Hogwarts fit the bill.”
“I have a better idea,” Harry grinned, looking about the hallway to see if anyone was nearby.  “How about you screw me instead,” he said in a hushed voice.
Breaking the awkward tension, Pansy spoke up, “Well, I wouldn’t mind getting a hold of one or two those Gryffindor do-gooders.”
“Let’s just eat,” Hermione suggested.  Ron had already begun to dig in, but Ginny continued to stare at Harry.
A smile slowly grew on Harry’s face.  He was supposed to be copying down the procedure for their potion. But he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the boy across the table from him.  The way the fringe fell over his eyes, the straight line of his nose, the curve of his lips.  Harry felt the stirrings of desire the longer he stared.
Lifting his eyes to meet Draco’s, Harry moved forward and grasped the back of Draco’s hair with his free hand.  He pulled Draco closer and kissed him. Eager to reciprocate, Draco released Harry’s hand and clutched his shoulders instead.  Forgetting where they were, the pair snogged while doing their best to get their bodies up against one another in the unforgiving library chairs.
“Well, I wouldn’t have come if I’d known about the Hogwarts trip,” Professor Slughorn laughed.  “But it’s always good to see you Harry.  And how is my successor faring?” he asked Draco.
“So, maybe next time I suggest doing something that you think you won’t like, you won’t give me such a hard time?”
Then he thought about what Harry told him about his childhood.  The city zoo was probably the most exciting place his aunt and uncle had ever taken him.  Draco sighed.
“Yes, I know.  And, again, I am truly sorry I let my temper get the best of me.  I didn’t mean to say that to you.  I was angry with someone else.”
“Not tonight.  We decided to host them only once a month.  McGonagall was getting suspicious of students showing up to class with tails and ears. Besides, attendance was waning.  Too many couples hooking up and dropping out,” Pansy complained and eyeballed Tracey.
“You don’t have to make excuses, Harry,” Draco said.  “The Ministry accepted the terms.  It’s really none of anyone’s concern.”
He stood, adjusting himself slightly from the affects of his daydreaming and answered the door. An older version of the boy in his story stood before him.
And just like that, their beautiful moment was ruined.  As far as Harry was concerned anyway.  Pointing out Harry’s embarrassment had been a faux pas.
“No, don’t do that.  Then I’ll imagine they’re crying constantly, and I’ll get up to keep checking.”
“That would be pretty funny actually.”  Draco cleared his throat and attempted to imitate Harry’s voice.  “Excuse me everyone, I know you all think I’m a manly hero that saved all of your sorry arses, but really I’m just a queen that likes to wear pink and pick wildflowers.  Sorry to have disappointed.”
With that, Draco tossed his paper on the table and left, humiliated as he was before. While the Prophet article was embarrassing for Harry, it was totally emasculating to Draco.  He couldn’t stand the scrutiny of the entire staff and student body a second longer.
“Yes.  Granger as well. I feel a bit more confident on that front,” Draco told him.  “I think maybe I scared Weasley–Ron, off at that impromptu get together a couple of weeks ago.  I vaguely remember putting my arm around him,” Draco laughed.
As the students gathered in the Great Hall, Headmistress McGonagall called for the first years to stand at the front and wait to be sorted.  Hermione sat down next to Ron, while Ginny and Harry sat across the table from them.  Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table.  It was odd to see Malfoy without Crabbe and Goyle at his side.  Gregory had opted not to return to Hogwarts after Vincent died.  Harry never realized how little like a bully Malfoy looked without his goons.  He sat quietly waiting, like everyone else, for McGonagall to finish sorting the new students.  Pansy sat to his right and Blaise across from him. There was something different about him.  Harry supposed there was something different about all of them.  Even Pansy, who had been eager throw Harry to the wolves, appeared to have lightened up a bit.  She leaned close to Draco and whispered something in his ear, causing a bright smile to grace his face.  Harry found himself smiling too.  He looked away before Draco and Pansy saw that he was watching.  Glancing around the hall, Harry noticed a lot of smiles, and his grew bigger.
After another deep breath, and feeling his chest rise and fall beneath their hands, Draco closed his eyes. He could feel the beating of his heart beneath his hand, he could feel the way he quivered. He breathed more. There it was, the ground beneath him, the rising energy that wanted to meet Harry, wanted to become entangled with his energy. He opened his eyes.
“Oh don’t start with that,” Harry said. “I don’t pity you.” He cleared his throat. He couldn’t quite name what it was he felt, but… he found Malfoy distracting, sometimes. And noticed when he didn’t eat properly, which was always.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, and Ginny paused at the threshold, and stared around the blackened room. The floor was covered in piles of ash, twisted and burned debris that must have been all that remained of the many things that had been stacked in the room at the time of the fire, as well as fallen stones and timber. The Room had always seemed so spacious, even when filled with centuries of hidden things - thanks, perhaps, to its tendency to change in size depending on need - but now it seemed large in an empty way, yet small in its total lack of life. Harry didn’t know when the fires had stopped burning. Maybe it was recent, because otherwise the room had been lying neglected since May, and the thought made Harry feel sad. The room deserved to at least be cleared.
"Oh!" said Harry. Suddenly he imagined a home with no corners which refused to light up, no drawers snapping shut on his fingers, no strangely locked doors. "Actually, that sounds kind of... brilliant," he said, looking up and smiling at Malfoy.
Malfoy gave him a flat look. "I'm only trying to help," he said, in his blandest voice. But then his face shifted into something more...
Draco sighed, but took Harry’s cup, and his own, and headed to the door. “Of course, O Mighty Chosen One.”
"No," Malfoy said. "I just ended the spell. But that was good: this level of ward does respond to you. If it hadn't, the light would have kept moving away until it faded."
The feeling inside had become a jittery sensation now, and Draco wondered if Potter felt this, too. Going for a walk seemed a good idea, because perhaps walking would help shake off this feeling.
"First of all, I think you have to trust both me and Harry to look after ourselves. And second of all, it would be pointless for me to go there—"
By the time they’d got to the second numbers round, Harry was trying hard to keep up with Malfoy. Malfoy, though, was far more practised than Harry. Either that, or he was just better at maths, but Harry decided that with a bit of application, he himself could near the dizzy heights of Carol Vorderman herself. Well, that or at least beat Malfoy once in a while.
Draco threw back his head and laughed. “I didn’t exactly mean that by saying I felt safe. I don’t expect you to be throwing hexes at anyone who looks at me funny.” He hauled himself out of bed. “I better get up. I’m more worried about Christmas day than I am about the ball.”
“There’s nothing wrong with a bit of fresh air,” Harry said. He tapped the space beside him. “Come on. Your toes are beginning to look a bit blue.”
The quiet room seemed to fill with the beating of Harry’s heart, but Malfoy didn’t look up at him. Maybe Malfoy couldn’t sleep. That would make sense, everyone had trouble sleeping. Harry had seen bottles of Dreamless Sleep Potion on more than one bedside table.
The nearby Muggle shops were enough to provide for his simple needs, and Harry took pleasure in picking out chocolate hobnobs and other treats he’d not been allowed in childhood. On the way back, the bags of shopping dug painfully into his hands until Harry remembered that he could cast a lightening charm.
The room, too, felt empty. Upstairs Draco slept on, and Harry didn’t want to wake him. Draco always needed a long sleep after a run of nights. He would be up later, and they could talk then.
“I’ve been doing this for years now.” Henry worked the sides in at the top, until the bowl had become a neat pot, curved wide in the middle but coming back in at the top. “It was such a relief to find a job I loved. I thought I’d be floating from one to another for the rest of my life.”
Draco sat back again, and closed his eyes. "Thank you." The others shut out, he sat with the rhythm of his breathing, and let his thoughts calm, too. When he opened his eyes, Greg and Millicent were both staring at him.
"In that case, let's get going," said Malfoy. He raised his wand, and a minute later, every object in the room had a small white light attached to it, like a glowing button. Some digits hovered in the air by his wand for a second. "So we don't miss anything out," he said, "when we go through the... eighty-nine bits of rejected Black history stored here." He began to unroll what looked like an immensely long scroll, and brushed a small patch clear of dust, then sat cross-legged on the floor. He placed an ink pot before him, and prepared a quill for writing. "Bring me the first item, Potter," he ordered, without even looking up.
“What in Merlin’s hairy beard are you doing in here?” Blaise stopped in the doorway, blinking as he peered into the kitchen.
With a subtle push of his hand and a step forward, Draco began to dance. He swept Harry into a rolling rhythm, spinning him around the room. Harry’s feet moved where Draco led them, but even as they moved Harry could still feel Draco’s thigh and body up against his own. Hot, close. Intimate. And then there was the way Draco was looking at him, as though Harry was the centre of his universe. After a minute or two, Harry began to feel dizzy, but whether from the movement or that intense gaze, he had no idea.
“No.” Malfoy was quiet for a moment. “I was thinking that maybe we need to… care for the room a bit.”
“What, like Mrs Snettisham? I’ve had tea at houses like that before.” Potter shuddered, then pointed to Draco’s mug. “This
Two feet? Harry heart sank: he didn’t see how he was going to be able to function with a curse like this on him. He loved magic, but sometimes it could be a real pain. The memory of a room filled with clouds of leaking magic prompted his next question: “Do you think it could have been something in Room 8?”
The only paintings in the study were one of Draco’s grandfather, Abraxas, and one of a fine horse in a field. Abraxas was reading a book when they walked in. He looked up and smiled, a dangerous slow curve of the lips that reminded Draco of this father.
Ron looked at the space it had occupied. “It did look….” He paused. “Well, a bit like Nev’s gran, to be honest.”
“I’ll help you.” Draco waved the stack of reports. “I want to meet the people you’ve already got working on this.”
The sound of a swearword shouted out from the other side of the shop made Harry close his eyes. Ron had heard then. “And cake.”
"And then sometimes," Potter said, "Sometimes something happens and it feels," he licked his lips, "wonderful."
Harry didn’t turn to follow her gaze; he knew what it looked like already. That wall was cold and slimy to the touch, and Harry wasn’t entirely sure if it was due to damp, the rain, or a curse.
“It’s very cathartic, this,” Malfoy said. “An excuse to have a good cry without having to feel sad.”
A broad smile lit Potter’s face. “Is that the best bargaining tool you’ve got? I’d love to see the Snidgets!”
When Draco woke up, they watched the last memory together. It was only one of their lazy Sundays in the memory: Harry and Draco in the kitchen, cooking and bickering and reading the papers. But it was perfect.
After all these years Harry hadn’t thought he’d see anything he didn’t recognise at Hogwarts, and it was strange to come back and find an unfamiliar and new space rather than the home that the Gryffindor tower had represented for so long. And yet there was plenty about the room that he recognised, too, odd pieces of furniture, and one of the rugs. And in the background ran his memory of sitting, staring into the Mirror of Erised all those years ago. The room was new to him, and yet also part of his memories, all at the same time.
Harry hadn't wanted to tell Malfoy like this. He’d not really thought he’d still be living here when he went back to work, for one. On his way back earlier he’d imagined sitting down with Malfoy, just the two of them, all cosy with Richard Whiteley’s terrible jokes on in the background. In his mind, he’d seen the way Draco’s face expressed so much, and the way Harry could gently calm him when he began to seem anxious. Like this, though, with all these extra people and the news about the Floo, Malfoy seemed beyond his abilities to soothe.
Harry ached most pleasantly when he woke up the next morning. From his stiff knee, to the rawness of his knees and the tenderness of his arse, it was all worth it and Harry rather hoped that Draco had a similar set of reminders of their afternoon and night together.
“Harry.” Draco felt Harry’s body shiver as he said his name. Draco pushed him against the hallway wall, and said it again. Harry cut him off with a kiss, and Draco threaded his hand through the messy black hair he’d been longing to touch all week.
Harry left the box of index cards in the middle of the table. He was going to have to face Draco about this: there was no point putting it off. With one final glance around the room he turned the light off, and headed up to bed.
“That’s a good idea, Mione. I’ll think about it.”  Harry yawned widely.  “Better be getting to bed.”
“We can’t stand together like this.  We look ridiculous.  No girls are going to want to dance with us,” Ernie said.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stood and grabbed a couple of things from his night table.  “I guess I’ll be going then.  By the way, did you know that you have to be holding your wand to make your request binding?”
“I’m sorry, sis.”  Padma smiled.  “If he’s too stupid to know what he’s missing, forget about him.  But on the other hand, you look fabulous.  Let’s go flaunt you in Hogsmeade.”
“Yes,” Harry tried to hide his own smile.  “I feel like I’ve barely seen you this week, except for meals.  You’re never in your quarters.”
Draco reluctantly stood and helped Harry fold the blanket up.  When they moved closer to hold their ends together, Draco took the opportunity to kiss Harry one more time.
Draco nearly lost his footing, his orgasm hit him so hard. “Oh, Harry.” He lurched forward, pushing Harry against the wall. “Damn,” he cursed himself.
He could hear the quiet sounds of Draco’s snore.  Normally, it was he that woke Harry from his post-reading nap.  Harry felt warm and comfortable in his lover’s arms and was loathe to wake him.  But Harry had been dreaming and had woken up quite a bit randy.
“Fuck.  I’m cumming,” Draco announced.  Harry squeezed his muscles and Draco cried out again in pleasure.
“Fine,” Ron said, trying to look like he meant it.  But secretly, he was worried it would soon become the girls against the boys. He was sure Ginny would start complaining about Harry behind his back.  He had no doubt Hermione was already complaining about him.
“No, I mean spending the night . . . in Draco’s bed,” he blushed.  “The first time, I dreamt that he held a wand to my throat when I woke up and he cursed me.  I woke up before I died in the dream.”
“Harry!” Draco shouted.  “Are you sure you want to do that?  Shouldn’t you at least talk to your, uh, partner before announcing that.  What if their parents don’t know yet, or something.”
“Sure.  I think it may be a bit big, though.” He got out the jacket and handed it to Harry. “You know, Harper’s more your size.  He’s got a fabulous black leather sports coat.”
Ron pursed his lips.  It was a losing battle if Hermione was on their side.  He was odd man out in this particular situation.
“Not yet,” Draco smirked. His gaze traveled down and he saw that Harry had enjoyed his ministrations very much indeed. He slid up high on Harry’s torso and rubbed his arse against Harry’s rock hard cock.
Trying to keep the mood light, Harry replied, “You are a bit of a drama queen.”  He reached up and stroked Draco’s chin.
In a surprising move, the werewolf cast a trip jinx at Draco, who had been standing at the top of the stairs. Draco felt as if he were falling in slow motion, and powerless to do anything about it.
Upon entering, Harry’s mouth was on Draco’s.  They kissed deeply while attempting to disrobe one another.
For a moment, Harry worried that what he was about to tell Ron would further prejudice him against Draco.  But he’d already started, so Harry told Ron everything.
“Come on, Ron.”  Hermione tugged at his sleeve.  “Let’s go see if Harry’s all right.  I have a feeling he needs to talk.”
“Thank you for the interview.  When you decide to come out, owl me, Harry.”  Glenda held out her hand to shake.
“Now who could that be?” Arthur asked.  He quickly rose to his feet and made his way to the door.  He came back into the kitchen with Dean in tow.
Draco could see that Harry was looking forward to it.  Even though it won’t technically be coming out, it might be a good way to test the waters, as it were.
Draco gazed at him, clearly more affected as he’d had more firewhiskey.  He lingered, while Harry waited uncomfortably for him to say something.
Taking the opportunity, Draco made his next inquiry.  “Why did you save me from the Room of Requirement?”
“She is a beauty,” Harry agreed.  “But she’s already got you.  The rest of us are out of luck.”  He had considered telling his friends about his sexual predilections.  But that had been before Ron made his comments.  Harry decide to leave well enough alone for the time being.
“I’d prefer to stay right here in bed, but if you really want to go out, there are natural pools with falls and lush greenery.  Very romantic.”
“Harry please don’t,” Knox begged.  “You’re the only real friend I have here. I won’t try to win you over anymore.  I’ll be satisfied just being your friend.”
“I’m afraid I’ve . . . fallen in love with someone.  Quite unexpectedly.  And it’s awakened feelings I didn’t think I had.”
“I’m sorry.  I spoke out of turn. Draco is right, I need to have a discussion before I make a statement.”
“Oh, right.  Well, right after Christmas, I’m going to make her retract all that.  I can’t believe she insinuated that we didn’t tell the truth about Dumbledore’s death.”
“But I don’t expect any of you to hand in late papers.  Now, for the essay, each couple will choose a potion from this list.” He held up a parchment.  “First, you must describe what the potion is used for and how it works, and the difficulty level.  Some of you will be choosing potions which, when brewed incorrectly, are deadly.  Include that information in your paper.  You will need to list the ingredients and the procedure for brewing.  You will also identify each ingredient by class, properties and function.  We will meet in the library all next week to do research.  Many of you may need to share books, so I suggest finding other groups who need the same information and working that out.”
“But . . .” Harry sighed heavily. “You looked like you . . . longed for it.  If I hadn’t known better, I would have thought you were envious of Bill and Fleur.”
Lifting Harry’s leg a bit higher, Draco propped himself on his elbow to gain some thrusting leverage.
Draco stopped and turned around. Rather than the look of satisfaction Harry was expecting, his mouth was agape in dismay.
Harry thought it was funny how Draco would allow Rose and himself to invade his personal space and spill bodily fluids on him, albeit, very different kinds, yet no one else could get close.
“We have to be honest, Harry.  They would definitely turn us down if they find out we’ve lied on the application.”
“I’m so sorry.  I had no idea that spell left permanent marks,” he apologized. “You must have really hated me after that.”
“That, paired with the atrocities that took place in my family’s home, makes a fairly convincing argument for finding a flat of our own,” Draco commented.
As the group started chattering again, Hermione noticed that Pansy had looked away while the boys kissed, appearing somewhat pensive.  Since the girl didn’t seem particularly sentimental, Hermione thought Pansy’s first explanation for her behavior was spot on, though it was intended to be sarcastic.  And Draco was that lost love of which she spoke.
“No, no. I didn’t mean to alarm you.” Harry slumped his shoulders and walked back to the bed. There was no getting around confessing his reason for visiting. He leaned against the window sill. “I just wanted to talk.”
“I’ll be happy to escort them,” Draco offered.  “Besides, I wouldn’t mind getting out of here myself.”
Instantly, Harry’s brain shorted out.  Though he’d been pretending the evening was a date in his head, the last thing he expected was for his former rival to make a move on him.
“He’s never made a move on me.  I swear,” Harry promised.  “I figured if I ignored it, eventually he would lose interest.”
“I just need a little time to adjust,” Harry told him.  He watched Draco’s profile silhouetted against the moonlight sky.
Harry stood looking at the book and wondering.  He had an idea.  He took out his wand and pointed it.
“Oh?” Draco looked up and raised an elegant eyebrow at Harry.  “Is that so?” he said with his usual haughty attitude.
Redirecting his attention, Harry continued writing the steps to the potion. He didn’t get very far before his gaze traveled back to the blond.
“Darling, they’re beginning to serve the main course.  Come, sit with me.”  He looked Harry up and down, still seeming to disapprove.  “Draco is waiting for you at your table,” he said curtly.
Attempting to break from Harry’s hold, Draco dismissed the compliment. “Reading to a child and letting her sleep in my lap doesn’t make me a good father.  Or a father of any sort.  Perhaps I’d be an adequate babysitter . . .” He broke free.
“Oh, yes. You really sentenced me to hard labor,” Draco said sarcastically.  “I just hate having to fuck and cum twice in one night.”
“What do you want to do tonight?” Draco asked. “It’s our last free weekend for two weeks.  I have duty next weekend and you have it the weekend after.”
“Yes, I do.  Most of them belonged to Death Eaters who perished on the property.  But some of the others are still here.”
“Thank you, professor.” Again, he directed his attention to Harry.  “I’ll floo call you later to let you know what’s going on.”
“Would you like to take any of this back to your House?”  Harry motioned to what was left of the goodies.
Harry smiled, too, at the thought of some of the pranks they had all pulled on one another in school.
“We’d end up on the floor when the bed disappeared,” Draco snickered.  “Besides, I think Slughorn comes in early on Saturdays to make potions for Madame Pomfrey.  Could you imagine his face when he walked in on us?”
“Lumos,” Harry said, holding out his wand. The room was dimly lit, but bright enough for Draco to find some candles to light.
“I thought as long as I was getting rid of hair,” Draco shrugged.  “I’ve never gone completely bare before.”
“Sure, no problem,” Harry answered.  He waited for Malfoy to continue up the staircase.  In an attempt to fill the awkward silence, Harry made small talk.
“No, last night was sort of fun.  But the point of the parties is to hook up, yeah?  I haven’t hooked up once yet.”
Harry did the same, bringing his hands to cup Draco’s face. Their tongues flicked and caressed one another inside the recesses of their mouths. Draco tossed the empty wand box onto the sofa and proceeded to unbutton Harry’s shirt. Following Draco’s lead, Harry unbuckled Draco’s belt, intent on freeing him of his trousers. The weight of the belt pulled them down to pool around his ankles. Draco pulled away just long enough to rid himself of his jumper, leaving only snug-fitting grey pants and trainers to be removed.
Looking at the offered hand, Ron hesitated.  Never had he imagined shaking hands with a family enemy.  Harry once again found himself holding his breath.
“Off with you, now.  You’ve made me miss lunch, and supper isn’t for another hour and a half.  Try to stay out of trouble until then.”
“No problem.  I didn’t like the idea of Snape’s things being abandoned without care.  I didn’t really understand him until after he died.  But, he was a good man.”
Fortunately, the sight of his current nemesis did the trick and as soon as the man was out of sight, Draco strolled into breakfast.
Draco still had his hands on Harry’s head and had pulled their foreheads together.  And he was grinning.
“Because the book I brought today is a novel about a man who seduces a younger, virtuous man and turns his life upside down.”
The conversation twisted and turned in many directions over the course of supper, never waning for a moment with so many to keep it going.  When the chat revolved around Bill and Fleur’s wedding, Hermione was reminded of her earlier discussion with Harry.
“Harry did it.  Well, the Healer is pretty sure he did.  He just couldn’t figure out how.  It happened when we, uh, during the binding.”  He hadn’t given his mother the details about their binding ‘ceremony’, but the memory of it made him blush nonetheless.
“Well, since you’ve offered, I do have some questions,” Hermione continued, directing her attention toward Draco. “What are your intentions?”
Dominique, it seemed, had forgotten all about her personal narrator from Easter, and hid behind Bill when she saw the tall blond. Harry was disappointed, as he was hoping she would bring out Draco’s fatherly tendencies again.
“Oh, yeah, you weren’t there.  Turns out there was a reason for Dean’s sudden proposal.  She’s going to have a baby.  Spent too much time in the loo,” Ron snorted.  “And Mum got suspicious when she wasn’t eating well.  Weasleys always eat well.”
Not able to hold his breath any longer, Harry let out a short sigh and heaved in a long breath.  He thought it best not to say any more until Ron had a chance to absorb and process what Harry told him.
“Sorry Fletchley.  She doesn’t want to come out.”  She felt a bit of pity for him as he nodded, looking disappointed.
Feeling he’d better quit while he could, Harry pondered his next question.  What did he want to know about Draco? He kept his question in the same vein as Draco’s.
Pansy laughed as well.  The chance to shag Harry Potter and to find out if that old witch’s tale was true was much too tempting.  Pansy never did have any willpower.  She took his hand and quickly led him back toward room she was in previously.  They slipped inside Trelawney’s room and locked the door behind them.  Harry glanced about the room.  He hadn’t taken Divination since Umbridge took over the school and the room creeped him out a bit.  He always felt as if there were things watching him.
“That’s another ten points for the Harpies!” the announcer shouted.  Harry’s team was winning by thirty points.
Though he would never admit it, Lucius was moved by Harry’s words.  Like Draco, pride prevented him from acting.  He wanted nothing more than to have his family back by his side.
“Plus,” the professor continued. “A private three course meal in my quarters with a surprise guest or two,” he said with a glint in his eye.
The Auror held up his wand and whispered an incantation. The front gate shimmered. And when Draco felt the change around his hand, he pulled Harry through.
Hermione raised her hand. “Excuse me Professor, but if we’re changing partners, I’d like to pair up with Ron.”
“Ah, yes, I saw that they had come in,” Cummins nodded.  He extended his hand to Draco.  “Glad to see the two of you are still together.  Any problems or concerns about your binding?”
Without another word, Harry left Gryffindor and walked purposefully to Ginny’s room.  When he arrived, Dean was there as well.  But Harry would have expected that.
Molly was in her glory, cooking for her clan and doting on her first two grandchildren, Victoire and Dominique. Though George and Percy had both been married for several years, neither had yet begun a family. Ginny still lived at the Burrow, but was getting quite serious with her boyfriend.
Nodding, Ron said, “All right then.  Professor Knox, all I want is a statement and to ask you a few questions.  Don’t make this more difficult.”
As Stephen walked past Boot, the larger boy had something to say.  “Maybe you’re an arse licker too.  Who needs ya?  Better not come around me no more.  I’ll bloody you up good.”
Harry nodded.  “Belinda is feeling very poorly.  But Ms. Singleton said that was perfectly normal.  It’s actually better than if she showed no symptoms.  A strong reaction means a strong child.”  Harry laughed.  “She probably made that up to make me feel less guilty.”
“Well,” Narcissa began.  “Why are you two still here?  Go. Go meet your new baby,” she smiled.  “I’ll watch the children.  They’ll be fine.”
As Charlie hugged his brother, Harry pointed him out.  “That’s Charlie.  He’s next oldest. He works with dragons in Romania. Next is Percy. You might remember him from school.”
“Oh,” Draco looked down at the device in his hand.  “It was an interview with Gwenog Jones and Finbar Quigley.  The Harpies are going against the Bats in a couple of weeks, October 23rd.  Should be an exciting game.”
“The letters were unsigned.  But we have a few leads and suspects we’d like to go after.  Did your father give you any idea who he was planning to name as a Death Eater?”
Narrowing his eyes, Harry directed his attention toward Knox, who was beaming up at McGonagall as she pressed on.
“I just think there are too many possible explanations for what soothsayers claim to see.  Professor Trelawney may have gotten a few predictions right.  But she made hundreds of predictions that never came true.”
“Fuck.  Sorry,” Draco grinned.  He didn’t look very sorry. “Your fault.  But I’ll give you a chance to get back at me.”
Draco’s eyes followed one of the cars on the track as it whipped around and went upside-down, spiraling ten times before the ride was over.
Lucius turned angrily to face Harry. “Well, I’ll bet this is exactly what you wanted.  You’ve finally succeeded in bringing down my entire family.  The end of the Malfoys.”
They sat in the same corner booth from their first pub night.  Harry went on and on about the match, while Draco listened and watched.
“Wonderful news,” Ms. Singleton announced through the floo. “Your surrogate witch is right on schedule and ready to receive your specimen.”
“I’ve heard about you,” Ollivander explained. “Turning yourself around, moving from your family’s manor, working for a living. And now I hear you’re entering the Auror training program. I haven’t heard of any other Death Eaters accomplishing so much.”
“You were nothing more than a puddle in my arse,” Draco blushed.  “That alone is enough to make this a momentous day.  But I have to admit, the other news is nearly as satisfying.”
“No, I understand,” Hermione said.  “You had no idea we’d changed ours.  But I don’t think we can change ours.  The Weasleys aren’t high society, but it may be embarrassing for them as well.  Besides, we were very lucky to secure a Minister at all.  It’s Easter that weekend.”
“I’m sorry, Gin.  I didn’t sleep well last night.”  Harry propped his head on hand and closed his eyes.
Still unsure if they were teasing him, Draco got to work peeling. Before long, twenty pounds of cut up potatoes were on the stove, boiling in a large pot.  Draco was fascinated by some of the other food preparation going on and stayed in the kitchen to watch.
“For crying out loud, Harry.  I could tell he was bent when we were children.  You can’t really be that naive as to miss all of his innuendos and suggestive comments.  I’ll give him credit for not being overbearing, but Knox has definitely been trying to seduce you.”
“I don’t care what you believe,” the man spat.  “Now get your foot out of the way or I’ll cast a Severing charm.”
“You must be hungry.  Let me take you to breakfast,” Hermione offered.  “I guess at this point it’s lunch.”
“Just come when you can, then,” Arthur smiled. “You know how your mother gets when the house is empty for too long. She misses the big Sunday suppers.”
to make me hurt you?  Because I’ll be happy to,” Blaise said as he grabbed a fistful of Draco’s shirt.
Hermione glanced around at the romantic scene. She didn’t know why Draco decided not to show up, but she thought he was a fool if this was the way Harry always treated him.
Glancing at Ron, then Hermione, Draco questioned Harry.  “Do you seriously expect me to let you feed me in front of . . .” he trailed off.
“Come on, it will only be a little longer.” Harry batted his eyelashes. “And Ron and Hermione are still here.  I’m sure they’d rather be off on their honeymoon.”
“Oi, mate,” Blaise walked to Draco, with Harper close behind.  He whispered something in his ear, and Draco nodded.  Harper smiled self-consciously at Harry, then averted his gaze.  After talking to Draco, Blaise grabbed Harper’s hand and took him into the boy’s dormitory.
“Apparently, I’m not all that good at hiding my interest in men.  The two of you must not be as observant as I thought.”
“Yes.  The room itself wasn’t in bad shape, but the ingredients cupboard was a mess.  Slughorn wasn’t very organized.  I almost fear what his quarters look like.”
“Absolutely not,” Harry said firmly.  “I do suppose Knox could be taking it all the wrong way, though.”
He leaned forward and kissed Draco.  What started out as a peck quickly escalated into all out snogging.  Slowly and steadily, Harry pushed Draco onto his back on the sofa, and gently lay himself on top.  Forgetting themselves, both boys began to grind against one another as Harry sank between Draco’s legs.
Harry laughed.  “I think he means they’re a little too enthusiastic about their schoolwork.  Am I right?”
“Fine,” he said.  “Yes. I would.  Draco and I work together as professors at Hogwarts.  We became friendly over the course of the past few months.  Recently, we have begun dating.  But we weren’t caught in a compromising position, as you put it.  I gave him a small kiss, that was it.  Any credible witnesses will corroborate that.  I would also like to clarify that he is not a Death Eater.”
Harry chuckled, then moaned as Draco’s hand found his crotch.  Without giving it a second thought, Harry ground against it, soon becoming hard.
She was beginning to fuss and working her mouth. He suspected that Harry simply didn’t want to deal with a potential crying fit. Her lip curled and she began to whimper.
Hesitantly, Draco sat back down, and the six friends began to eat.  Harry told the rest of them what happened with the Ravenclaws outside the hall.
“I suppose I could do worse,” Draco smirked. Of course, there was the matter of Harry’s little confession and waking up with the Gryffindor lying atop him. Not that Draco was truly complaining, but now there seemed to be an odd uncertainty between them. He wasn’t positive, but he thought either Harry didn’t recall what happened, or he was an exceptionally cool customer.  Draco decided it was the former, as Harry seemed to wear his heart on his sleeve normally. Draco himself would have to be the cool one.  Unfortunately, he remembered every detail of the evening.  “I certainly don’t want to get stuck with Millicent or Mandy.”
Harry reached out his hand to Draco’s subconsciously.  “Is that why you didn’t want your mother to change it?  Because it reminds you of how things were before Voldemort took over?”
Rita leaned forward slightly and gave a half smile. “Draco Malfoy carries the Dark Mark, does he not?”
Ginny wasn’t sure what to expect or even what they’d do once they got there.  She and Dean walked silently until they reached the room she shared with Michael. When they walked in, Parvati was straddling Michael’s lap and they were snogging, heavily.
“I’ll eat you instead,” Harry breathed, unbuckling the belt holding up Draco’s trousers.  As he unzipped them, he kissed up and down the slender pale neck before him.
“No, Harry, your relationship with Draco is not a problem.  I rather prefer it to the way you boys used to behave towards one another.”
Though Harry usually preferred to bottom, he had to admit the thought of reversing their positions caused him to harden under the sheets.
“And do you think your students believe that? Mine certainly don’t.  The younger ones don’t seem to understand or care.  But the Sixth and Seventh Years . . . well, let’s just say, they know things I didn’t when I was their age.”
Narcissa put on her best ‘Lucius face’ and imitated him, “Boy, you can’t have a pink room.  People would think you’re queer or something.”
Margherita laughed heartily. “Sí , he is right.  I think is better you have a girl.  You are very pretty.”
“Am I that obvious?” she snickered.  She put her spoon down as well.  “Well, since you’ve given me permission . . .  you told me, that night in the Potions room, that if you let yourself, you could fall in love with Draco.”
“Oh, I won’t. I’ve asked that the hearing begin after my classes that day so I can accompany my father to court.”
Forcing himself to relax, he was about to get up and make himself a drink when a small ginger haired child toddled over to him.  He smiled in spite of himself.
big,” she purred, running her hand up and down his length.  “I think you could give Draco a run for his money.”
“I don’t possess much modesty, Potter.  Blaise and I were dorm mates for years.  I have no qualms about changing in front of him.  It does nothing for either one of us.  Blaise is most definitely as straight as they come.”
Body satisfied, but mind greatly disturbed, Knox cleaned himself up and curled on his side.  He still wanted Harry so badly, he could practically taste it.  He’d backed off the way Harry asked.  But playing it cool had gotten him nowhere.  The Head of Gryffindor treated him as dispassionately as he did any other professor.  It was time to take a different approach . . .
McGonagall nodded.  “Must be my maternal instincts.  I suppose it isn’t really necessary to check on Draco then, ” she chuckled.  “He wasn’t at supper either.”
“No problems.  She must have been very hungry, though.  She downed it in no time.  So, I gave her a bit of the next one.  I hope that was okay.”
Looking pointedly at the floor, Draco hesitantly replied, “I’ve tried to contact Blaise.  And Pansy.  I haven’t heard from either of them.  I suspect Pansy’s new husband doesn’t want the trouble that seems to follow me.”
“Harry, that was all very entertaining,” Ginny said.  “I never knew you had such a wonderful way of telling a story.”
Climbing on top, Draco positioned his mouth over Harry’s mast-like cock, while his own dangled above Harry’s face.  Immediately, Harry took the hint and licked the prize in front of him.
Harry arrived at the front door of the Prophet at seven in the evening.  Most of the lights were out, indicating little activity.  He knocked loudly on the door until, after several minutes, someone came to answer.  The door opened just a crack, and the face of an older gentleman appeared.
“She’s embarrassed by the press obviously.  She went to have Christmas in the country with a distant cousin and sent me back here.”
Draco couldn’t help laughing.  He composed himself, however.  He didn’t want Harry to think he was making fun of him.
“Oh, I’m just being overly cautious,” Hermione tried to wave off her fears.  “I’m sure you’re right.  Trust your instincts Harry.”
“And of course, yours as well, Draco,” she added when she saw that he noticed the lack of attention directed at him.
Poppy led Harry down one of the hallways–not the one he would have picked–and down the staircase.  They turned right and walked through the dining room, which Harry remembered from the day before, down another short hallway and finally to the solarium.  Narcissa was already sitting at a round, wrought iron table, eating scones and sausages.
The kitchen was lit by candlelight, and a meal was laid out on the table. Draco handed Harry a glass of wine as soon as Harry walked in.
Harry knew now, just how much Draco actually knew about London history. No wonder he could slip little nuggets of truth into this tour. His room had a whole wall of books, and most of them were of Muggle history. Running along the length of the room was also a desk, on which Draco kept neatly ordered sets of notes.
As Harry ate, he kept returning to the idea that Malfoy thought that he didn't want to be seen out with the two of them together. "Look, I know I called you a pr— that is, I just wanted to say that I– I don't care about being seen with you," he said. Malfoy gave him an unreadable glance. "I mean– when we walked in I thought you might– I just don't like being mobbed when I eat my lunch," he said, feeling a little pathetic. "But I don't mind that I'm with you."
"Bloody Harry Potter," Draco muttered. But he heaved the wooden barrel over another root and continued on his journey back to the cabin.
Harry glanced back at the water flowing down the stairs, then nodded towards the kitchen. “Cup of tea?”
. Harry kissed Draco, hard. He didn’t want gentleness. This wasn’t a memory. He wanted to feel Draco; he wanted this to be real.
“Look, you git, I’m trying to do something important.” Harry took a deep breath, then reached into his pocket, slowing right down when he clocked the way that Malfoy had frozen. “I’m not going to Hex you.”
“That may well be true, Mr Potter, but you did sign a contract when you agreed to look at it for me.” Mrs Snettisham picked up one of the scrolls lying by her side. Even as she unrolled it, a sense of unease grew in Draco’s chest. He’d signed a contract too, after only a cursory read-through of its dry phrases. But then he had valued so many objects over the years, and some of the older families were very particular about preventing thefts. “Oh yes, here we are:
"Yes, Potter. I am going to have to inventory every single object in this house, and you are going to help me."
“There is no way that you are anything other than a Gryffindor.” Draco shook his head as if he were trying to work out which other house Harry could possibly have been placed in.
“No! Don’t. Ron’s just a bit overly-dramatic, that’s all. I promise, he’s more likely to find this amusing than annoying.”
He wanted to devour Potter. Consume him. Touch him like a tree, and feel his energy from the inside.
"Your hands are cold," she said. "And I should think that your head is full of Wrackspurts. It seems to me that you are trying to make some decision, but it’s all too hard right now."
"I feel more… I don’t know. I’m not as scared anymore." Harry went silent, and Draco was about to turn and leave when he spoke again, his voice quiet but full of weight. "I’m sorry I haven’t been more welcoming," Harry said. "Having Draco here’s helped me realise I can have friends in my life."
A hot, squeezing sensation settled over Harry’s chest, and he put down his mug, but not before taking one more sip. “Hello, Susan. Why would you say that?” He had a horrible feeling he knew exactly why she had said it, and it was making him feel shaky.
Draco smiled ruefully at Potter, but Potter wasn’t smiling. His eyes were sad. "You were so arrogant."
"Do you want to come with me to get some more coffee?" asked Harry, after the moment of silence had stretched out to become almost uncomfortable. "I mean, I could just go get some, but maybe you'd like a break? It's probably lunchtime now anyway." Now Malfoy was looking at him strangely, and Harry didn't know what to do. He felt his cheeks begin to heat with embarrassment. "Or, er, I'll just—"
George put his fork down and sat back in his chair. “Do you know what you’re becoming, Harry?” he asked.
Harry opened and closed his mouth. He thought back to the welcome feast. “McGonagall said the seventh floor west wing was out of bounds.”
"Harry," Ron said, sitting down next to him. "Can you put your tongue away for a second and answer a question for me?"
There was a moment of silence before Harry cleared his throat. "So, er, where do you want to start?" he asked.
Harry – how could he be ‘Potter’ now? – was in his arms, as warm and solid and Draco had ever imagined him. Draco could smell a hint of rosemary and sandalwood that must be Harry’s shampoo or soap; Harry’s mess of hair was brushing his chin.
"Fuck, Potter," Malfoy said his voice low and husky, and he pulled Harry down onto the bed. It was good to finally hear the need, no longer denied, in Malfoy's voice, and Harry drew closer.
“Given how many siblings you have, I should think they danced around quite a few times,” Draco said pointedly.
"Each individual tree. This one," Potter patted the tree, "is old. I think it prefers autumn to summer."
“Yes, yes.” Draco sighed. “I know, you’re usually off saving the day. Or eating lunch with Weasley, or meeting the Minister for vaguely important meetings.”
After the cheese-toastie incident, Harry tried to keep his head down. June slid into July, eased by a string of rainy days, fat raindrops plopping noisily through the full-leaved trees behind the house. Harry knew he didn’t have to live in Dudley’s house, but some part of him stubbornly clung to the promises he’d made. And even with Malfoy being all highly-strung and obsessed with tidiness - he wasn’t even going to think about Zabini’s casual nudity - it was still a less lonely and hollow experience than living at number twelve with only Kreacher for company.
“What many people don’t know is the unique history of St Paul’s. Used all over the world as a symbol for London, it was actually built after a firm of architects saw the 1964 movie
“You’re going to have to go to the ball. Wait until I tell Ron!” George shook his head. “The minister is so good at this. You didn’t stand a chance.”
An image of the house, the neat way each cushion on the sofa was arranged, the tidiness of the kitchen, formed in Harry’s mind. “It’s… well, I don’t really know how to describe it. It’s very clean. There are a lot of rules about that.”
"OK, or I wouldn’t bother making it," Harry said. "But there are so many courgettes I’ve got to use them somehow."
“You can’t fucking do whatever the hell you want, Malfoy!”, Harry said. He couldn't bear to look at Malfoy. The smarmy, beautiful bastard that he was. All this time Harry had been so very sure that he hated Malfoy, that the other thing was merely something accidental. But now… it was all too much to take in, and Harry fell back, retreating to the small table lit by the window overlooking a world pale and colourless, buildings bright with moonlight but the streets hidden in deep shade. Harry felt safer somehow, in the squares of light coming from outside, with a table between the two of them. He still watched Malfoy, who touched a hand to his lips, then took a step forward. Feeling trapped, Harry felt his senses sharpen and he raised his hands without thinking about it. Malfoy stopped, and Harry calmed a fraction, relieved, and lowered his hands.
“You kept this?” Draco hesitated, then reached out, and touched the feather. As he did so, his fingertip brushed against Harry’s palm, the barest whisper of a touch. Immediately, tingling warmth engulfed Harry’s hand and travelled along his arm, across his body. The zing of it was electrifying and comforting all at once. When he felt like this, Harry realised, he felt more alive than he had done in years. A moment later, and Draco's finger was gone, and the sensation faded.
Luna cooked dinner that night. Everyone smiled politely at the honeyed courgettes and curried peas. Everyone, that was, except for Malfoy. To his credit, he did appear to try, but his face refused to make anything other than a slightly horrified expression throughout the meal. Luna didn’t seem to mind, and Malfoy cleared his plate, so Harry decided not to worry about it too much.
No one else in their class had been able to perfect the transformation, but here, in the Room, it felt possible.
“Thank you for agreeing to take me in, Potter,” he said. Under the harsh streetlight, his face seemed even paler than it had in Kingsley’s office.
Draco had stripped naked, and got into bed hoping that Harry would be back soon. He’d waited long enough though, that he had begun to drift off.
Pointing his wand at Malfoy, and turning his hair a triumphant Gryffindor - or perhaps Weasley - red delighted the Harry that had endured years of sneering and snobbery from Malfoy. Along with Malfoy’s own pleased smile as he retaliated with a brilliant Slytherin green for Harry, it seemed to Harry that the past and the present were overlapping, but with the sting of hurt removed.
“I was thinking,” Harry said, “That the one thing we didn’t do in this room was complete our Animagus transformations. I think… I think we both could. And if we do it while we’re still at school, I think McGonagall will arrange for us to be registered. Both of us.”
Granger shrugged.  “I’m not sure yet.” She shuffled her feet. “You’re just going to have to be patient while I try to figure this out. And I’m sorry, but I’ve got to go now – I’m supposed to meet Harry at the teashop.”
“My landlady kicked me out when she found out who I was.” Greg looked miserable. “But I don’t expect you’ll want me here, either.” He looked up and met Harry’s eyes. “I’m not welcome anywhere.”
In the silence which followed, it occurred to Harry that he might not have sought Malfoy out, but that he was pleased that their paths had crossed again.
Being outside helped, and Harry continued to take deep breaths of crisp air. Its wonderful, distinctly autumnal-not-summery fresh coolness filled his body, and with each exhalation a little of the ache and the sadness seeped away. He listened to the birds. Nature hadn’t exactly featured highly in his childhood, but some mornings he’d lain in bed, hearing the birds through the open window.
Once everyone had found their beds - and in the case of Ernie and Ron leaped onto several of the beds in the room - Harry and Ron went back into the common room. The others followed them; Ernie and Anthony struck up a conversation with Lisa and Padma who were sitting by the fire.
Malfoy regarded him through pale lashes. Every part of him was neatly back in place, with no sign of a crumple or crease anywhere. And yet… there was something of the closeness of the night before, in the way they were sitting, in the look they shared.
This time he didn’t need to look at Malfoy to know that it had worked; he felt a lifting sensation at the end of his wand, as though the linking of the objects had tipped his wand up.
“There are plenty of Malfoys,” Draco said. “We’re not all the same. People see the hair and they think that we are.”
The contact ends when Malfoy moves his hand away to pick up his quill. A sinking, quivering feeling settles in Harry's gut. He picks up his own quill, and tries to replicate the diagram as best he can. He would ask Malfoy what he makes of the tiny writing, but Harry doesn't quite trust himself to talk. And besides, by not talking they are managing to share this book. If he opens his mouth, they might end up in another argument, and Harry knows that they are both trying to avoid that.
, and even the memory of the words made him shiver. Malfoy couldn’t have that hold over him. He couldn’t know Harry’s darkest secrets.
“It’s good to hear you admit it,” she said gently. “That you… like Harry now. It’s good to hear you say his name. But that’s not why I think it’s been broken. I– I’ve seen that same soft look on Harry’s face, you know.”
Hermione glanced back over at the group of trainees. “You’re talking about Malfoy,” she said, a tone of disbelief   in her voice, as if it were inconceivable that Harry should feel any antagonism towards Malfoy, or even spare him a thought. “Ron says that he’s OK now.”
“I can’t imagine.” George opened the door to his kitchen range, and threw in another log, then filled a kettle with water and set it on top.
Whatever Harry had thought of Malfoy in the past, the man he was now was nervy but kind. Harry was glad to be in this house, with this man. The drumming of the rain made it sound terrible outside, cold and stormy. But inside, in the dining room sitting opposite Malfoy and eating together, Harry felt warm and cosy. He smiled at Malfoy, and Malfoy smiled back.
Potter gave a hollow laugh. "Oh, don’t worry, I’m here to stay. Not much point about choosing to come back otherwise. And not really on when so many didn’t make it."
"That’s nice." Draco wasn’t thinking about his mother. In fact, he’d barely spared a thought for his parents since he arrived. A sinking hole had opened inside him, at the thought that he only had two more days left here. Two more days with Potter.
"Look," said Harry, "it's all academic if I can't actually live there, isn't it?" Malfoy gave him one of his affronted glares, but sat back and took a sip from his coffee.
Potter came to a stop in front of a painting of a rather rotund couple and their matching dog. Draco hadn’t given much thought to the portraits in the closed section of the house before, or about what they had witnessed over the years. But then perhaps they had hidden away – if he had been able to do so, he would have, too.
Draco bowed his head in agreement. The less said about the ash the better; no matter how he tried to hold onto it, it slipped and moved and he’d ruined so many possible wands that Ollivander had made him go home early the day before.
“OK. Bye then.” Draco was all pale again, like he’d been that time in the Leaky. He shoved the timer deep into some pocket, and turned to leave.
Draco couldn’t answer, as the inevitable memories of dinner dates – none real – overwhelmed him. Instead, he blinked, and silently cursed himself for being so feeble.
Although he now spent his day making Snitches, Draco hadn’t played for years and was a little rusty with the terminology. One in particular had stood out: Snitchip.
Harry nodded. “I thought I’d try Twilfitts and Tattings. They’re not a bit… much, are they?” He smoothed out the dark blue velvet, conscious of the tiny stars embroidered at the hems. Ron’s were a brown brocade, and a million miles from his too-short and over frilly robes from the Fourth Year.
The kitten - George, jumped down from the armchair and trotted across the floor, then leapt up onto Ron’s lap. Ron immediately began to pet the cat, stroking its fur and cooing at it.
“I… it’s complicated.” Frustration rose up in Harry, tying knots in his chest as it went. “Everyone thinks I'm this hero. First years stop talking when I come near. And here I am, unable to do a charm everyone else has cracked!”
"I see what you mean: I think I'd rather be you than him," he said. "Although if that meant smooching with Harry here, maybe not. It's a tough choice, really."
Draco pressed out the different parts needed for a Snitch: small panels with curved edges, tiny cogs, and strips of gold. He heated gold until it poured and filled a series of moulds. Finally he laid out the silver sheet destined to form the Snitches’ wings.
, obviously, but he’s not so much of a raving bigot now. He actually apologised for calling me a Mudblood before.”
Harry was now laughing with Weasley; the two of them were holding their hands up to show the size of the fish Weasley claimed to have caught last year.
“Has your brother really moved there?” Padma asked Ron. “Is he going to be opening up a Wheezes shop in Hogsmeade?”
Draco rubbed his hands through his hair. It was a mess, and Harry wondered how it would feel, to touch it. “I wrote that letter a long time ago, Harry.” He let out a long breath, and looked down at his hands, now worrying away on his lap.
“Mmm.” Harry sat up. In the light of the morning it seemed a lot less strange to be naked in bed with Draco. In fact, it felt… right.
"Yes, I am. It seems that the house – the wards, that is – don't recognise me fully as a member of the Black family," Harry said, looking over to Malfoy to check that he'd got it right. Malfoy nodded, and Severus frowned. "There have been some accidents – mostly things falling on top of me. Like chandeliers," said Harry.
“Let’s practice the Patronus again,” Harry said. “And when we’ve had enough we can have a go at some self-Transfiguration.”
Potter winced. “Do you think you could call me Harry? I keep expecting Flitwick to take five points when I hear you call me Potter.”
Draco wasn’t really surprised by this news, either. He was however, more disappointed than he wanted to show that there was no chance of sinking into a hot bath, or even of washing off the sweat and dirt of the past few days in a cooling shower.
“This shop is bonkers,” Harry said, raising his voice slightly to be heard above the din of so many people in a small space.
“Thanks, I guess.” At least it sounded as though George was OK. It was hard to tell with him; sometimes he seemed fine, other times the sadness was so distinct it was painful to be in his company.
Reassured and comfortable, they sat together for a while more, talking quietly about old memories. Harry was happy to stay in the safety of the past, but after she left he stared out into the flat turquoise sea. Following the glints of light in the small lazy waves, Harry replayed the entirety of the year over in his mind. The growing awareness of his wish to be close to Draco. The bath. The kisses.
“He’s still there. I think he’s trying to make it a bit nicer, it got a bit neglected in the past.” Harry didn’t know, actually, what Kreacher was doing, but admitting that felt like a failure.
They stood staring at each other. Which was a little strange, in the vast and empty space of the Atrium.
He couldn’t believe Draco’d faced his friends like this. Poor Draco. Harry’s introduction to Draco’s friends had been far gentler: a quiet morning coffee with a chain-smoking Pansy, and a gentle, if stilted, lunch at Malfoy Manor.
“I– I really like him.” Harry blushed. “I don’t remember thinking about him like this before, but now I can’t stop. He’s smart, and funny, and I’d like…” He looked up. “For the first time in a long time, I think… I think that this could work. Barmy as that sounds. I can imagine us,” Harry’s blush deepened, “you know. Growing old together.”
"You keep saying how you want to be alone, it’s hard to hear because… being alone means me not being here."
anyone. Harry can remember though, what it is to stand with fingers entwined and lips just touching; the soft warmth of skin as his hand slid up under a jumper.
"You– you're not used to spending all this time at home, especially not with someone else here, are you?" asked Malfoy.
“I’d like to explore Teddy’s Harry Potter collection some more. Did you know he had a scar-shaped cushion, a picture book about your life, playing cards with you and your friends on them, a pair of glasses like yours but with blank glass in them, and at least five different dolls—”
“That’s the other way you can contribute. I thought I could show you how to weave a small bowl and then you could sell what you make at the market in the local town.”
“I think so. It… it makes sense. But there haven’t been any thefts that I know of. Believe me, my door is the first one to get knocked on when the Aurors are investigating the theft of any kind of heirloom.”
Several rounds in, the mood had lightened to the point of messy merriment. Hannah and Susan had appeared, red-nosed with cold but each with a gift for Padma and another in a bag ready to give Parvati, and Lisa and Anthony had been spotted snogging by the back door. Hermione and Daphne had arrived while the group were in the middle of a rousing chorus of Weasley is our King, with Ron standing on a table with a quickly Transfigured crown on his head.
Gently, ever so gently, Draco reached out and touched Harry’s face. And then he leant forward again, until his lips were touching Harry’s and he kissed him. The kiss was so soft and tender it was almost not there at all.
Draco was too tired to respond. He let his head fall back, then lay there in his cooling sweat and spunk, listening to the breeze in the trees, the birds talking to the trees, and the insects talking to themselves.
That was a bit close to the mark. Harry shuffled his now-warm bum. “There’s something else. Er, I mean, that’s not it.”
They wake in the morning, arms around each other in Draco's narrow bed. It is still early, and Draco can hear the noisy song of the birds in the trees, greeting the sun. Neither moves. One of Draco's arms, hot and wet with sweat, is crushed between their bodies, even as the other is sprawled across Potter's chest. He can feel the weight of Potter's legs along his shins, and when he flexes his foot he feels Potter adjust his position slightly. He should want to break free, but instead he wants to stay here, just like this, for as long as he can.
He didn’t realise that the broom was sinking through the air until the first brush of a branch against his calf. Draco opened his eyes in alarm: he was sinking fast into the trees. He grabbed hold of the broom righted himself, then swung back up to see where he was. A glint of light caught his attention: deep in a rocky gorge, a rock pool, bigger than a cabin and fed by three waterfalls.
“Not until I have to.” Harry went quiet as he thought about how each of Dudley’s rare postcards was from further and further afield. He wondered how much further he wanted Dudley to go. Was the moon a possibility?
Harry nodded, having heard these sentiments from almost every person on the training programme already. Robards had turned up and given them his Head Auror speech, full of hints of Dark magic, mysteries and glory, which had done little to help Harry’s mood. The words had sounded hollow. Robards had patted Harry on the back afterwards, and all the trainees stared as he told Harry that he would be treated like anyone else, and how pleased they were that he’d decided to take up the training. Harry cringed just thinking about it.
“Yes, so it was a curse, but I can’t narrow down which one.” She looked down, to check a parchment Draco couldn’t quite see. “It’s in the field of Mind Curses.” She peered at him, as though she would be able to see the curse through the flames. “Have you had any symptoms? Voices, visions, paranoia, terror, nightmares?”
Potter touched a small twig growing out of a small branch, and whispered something so quietly Draco couldn’t make out the individual words. Draco leant forward, and held his breath. Potter stood, very still, his hand barely touching the tree. After a moment he spoke again, and this time Draco heard the words: "Please, if you may, do you have anything you can offer me?" And then Draco saw, with his very own eyes, the tree and the twig give a little shiver before the twig shook itself off the tree. In Potter’s hand, it sat, detached, as though Potter had plucked it from the tree.
“No. It wasn’t.” Potter sighed. “Do you still play? I bet you have some amazing Snitches to practise with.”
"Only if it’s wrong that when you call me Potter, I want to drop to my knees and take you into my mouth."
“Yeah, of course. Um, me too. The water, that is.” Harry moved to the sink to get himself a drink. Malfoy leant back against the window frame, watching him. Harry felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise at the scrutiny. He tried not to think about his dream, about the feel of a body on top of his. He was painfully aware that they were both standing there in only their pyjamas. Just a thin piece of cotton, between him and—
She frowned, and Draco’s stomach dropped. Why had he told her anything? He hated being dependent on anyone else, and to be indebted to someone like Pansy was a terrible idea. He’d never hear the end of it. “You know, I really don’t know much about these visions of yours. I know you see Potter. What are doing? Flinging hexes at each other? Drinking merlot in your garden? I think you’re going to have to tell me a bit more—”
Smiling, Harry raised his face to Draco, who cupped it with his hand. Draco leant down and pulled Harry to him. Harry could feel every hair follicle on his body, every skin cell, every drop of blood as it rushed through him. Gently, slowly, their lips met. Harry closed his eyes and breathed in Draco, the scent of mint and tea, tears and a trembling, uncertain hope.
Potter had the tightness around his eyes that Draco associated with him having knee-difficulties, so he insisted that they sat down before finding out anything more. Weasley directed them to an empty office. Potter reached for Draco’s arm before he could offer it, and together they made their way to the second floor.
Malfoy ignored Harry and sailed on through his list. “Six: pay your share of the bills on time. Seven: same goes for the rent.”
When Harry returned to the living room bearing two cups of tea, Malfoy stared down at his for a while before putting it on coffee table at their feet. Harry squinting slightly in an effort to see the screen better. “Mind if I pull down the blinds?”
Draco had never held any illusion about what Potter’s friends had thought of him. It was why it had been such a surprise when Potter had spoken in his favour at the trials. He ran his hand over the back of Harry’s hand, and got a soft squeeze in return.
Grumbling, Draco removed his shoes and socks, then rolled up his trouser legs. The water was cold, but he gritted his teeth and stepped in. He tried not to notice the squelching mud or the dark shadows of half-rotted leaves that clung between the reeds and the river bank. His lungs filled with the loamy scent of earth and water. It felt like it was swallowing him up: the air and the water and all the plants growing around him. Draco attempted to ignore the sensation, and focused instead on holding the small blade the way Henry told him to.
A loud, rumbling laugh echoed around the room. “Nice pants, Malfoy,” Ron said. Harry let go of Draco’s hand to get a better look. By leaning up on his elbow and twisting around he was able to see dozens of broomsticks circling Draco’s crotch only a moment before Draco whipped his robes back down again.
Susan was watching them closely. Anger and hurt were still visible on her face, but something new was showing, too.
His way down became steeper after this, but it didn’t matter. He was closer than he had been the day before, or even an hour before.
"That's not what I meant and you know it," said Harry, but he still reached out to brush the outline of Draco's cock, which gave a lazy twitch and began to take on a more... defined shape. Draco batted his hand away and kissed him on the cheek, all at once.
, Harry thought to himself. But then had it only been fear of wrongdoings that had prompted Harry to follow him around for a year? This was a question Harry had never really been able to answer. “But he’s always been a bit… preoccupied with order. I think it’s partly why all the Death Eater stuff was so attractive to him. He knew where he stood.”
“Harry.” Ginny’s voice interrupted Harry’s quiet tracking of the plane, and he looked back at her, hair pushed behind her ears, biting her lip and looking serious.
“Come on!” Harry called, and Draco realised that he had fallen behind again. There was, thankfully, a place to get changed, and Harry threw a small bag at Draco. It contained a range of swimwear, and Draco chose something at random. He cast a charm he had learned at school, but not from any professor. With any luck, the charm should hide any unforeseen… activity within the confines of the swimming trunks.
“I wasn’t trying not to laugh,” Harry said. “I mean, maybe a little.” He shook his head. “That is, it’s not every day that you discover that Draco Malfoy, arch-Slytherin, has an inner Gryffindor side.”
“The bathroom’s through that door,” Dudley said, pointing to the end of the room. “There isn’t one upstairs, sorry.”
“Oh.” Harry needed a moment to process this, and they started walking again. Zabini stayed silent, but every now and then he glanced over at Harry.
Andromeda had the good grace to look embarrassed. “They came as part of a set,” she said. “People do keep buying him Harry Potter things.”
Harry and Draco chased each other through the water, until they were cool despite the sun. They got out, Harry’s brown skin deliciously dotted with goosebumps and water droplets before he towelled himself dry. As Draco watched the towel passing over Harry’s skin, he decided that it was a good thing that they couldn’t use drying charms. There was something to be said for Muggle methods.
Reality returned. Draco rallied his sense of outrage at Potter's remark. How dare Potter insinuate that Draco would be so clumsy as to damage such an instrument? “Lasting damage! Don’t make me out to be a Neanderthal, Potter. You know as well as I that I am always careful in my work.”
He was only halfway through both his list of contraindicated herbal combinations, and his tea, when Susan had come to sit next to him.
The adrenaline surged every higher and between one kiss and the next, Draco was spilling over Harry’s frantic fist. “Oh sweet Merlin, love, I’m coming at work.”
Two white gold rings nestled against red velvet. Both had a Celtic knotwork dragon encircling the band. He’d wanted something elegant and intricate, but also smooth enough that Draco could still wear it to the hospital without it getting in the way of his work. The jeweller had provided the perfect rings.
“No,” Draco said firmly. He peeked through the door at Annie, curled into a tight all on her pallet next to Draco’s spot. “That isn’t going to happen.”
His tongue traced over the edges of his teeth, and longing welled up in Draco. He knew the moment Harry registered it because his grin turned wicked and he almost attacked Draco’s mouth with a biting kiss. Draco eagerly licked the tips of his sharp teeth and considered begging to have them testing the limits of his skin.
For only a second, I imagine his blood coursing through me, filling my cock so I could fuck him senseless.
Even if the morning was a little chillier than Harry liked for flying, he had a good time playing quidditch. He missed being on the Gryffindor team, and the regular practices that kept him in shape. The boys always said they’d play more often but rarely managed it as often as he wanted. Now that spring turned the weather steadily warmer, perhaps they’d find more time for it.
“I mean, it’s still rather new. The idea of it. But the more I think about it, the more I’m…” Harry’s words came quickly, tripping over each other in their haste. “I just — I read those words and I could see it, you know? Another man petting my dog and asking for extra jam on his pancakes and now I’m…” He nervously licked his lips. “Yeah, I think it suits me better than — than the alternative.”
Draco closed his eyes for two seconds and they popped open wide and bright. “I didn’t realise that was an option.”
“Is that so?” Andromeda said, eyeing Draco more carefully. “And what would your parents say about that?”
Their measured pace became speed walking once they reached the Entrance Hall, and then outright running as they neared their common room. They were both laughing so hard by the time they arrived, they could hardly get the password out.
“Do you think I want to leave that bin full of sex toys around for someone to find? What if one of our friends comes over and sees it? No, no, we’re disposing of it now.”
“Mr Malfoy, the Ministry isn’t asking for much here. We’re just interested in why the children of so many Death Eaters are gathering in one place.
“There’s no vicar,” Draco said, his brows drawing down. A light flush crossed his cheeks that made Harry grin.
After all their time together, Draco knew exactly how Harry liked to be touched and teased, but he hesitated this time. “You don’t want me to—to…”
“So is French the theme for today? Hardly seems kinky at all. I wonder what Blaise and Pansy will do. Her French is terrible and Blaise only knows Italian. I suppose they could go Italian instead.”
Draco took a fortifying breath before lowering the wards on the door. For a second he considered closing the storeroom door behind him to make it all the harder for Harry to get out of the shop undetected. Merlin knew the sexy wanker deserved it.
Draco’s head shot up, jolting every painful joint of his body. Hazy vision focused on the figure in front of him. “Potter,” he croaked, his voice still raw from his brief stint in prison.
“I’ll go shopping. I’ve seen a powder there the muggles give their babies. Must be like a baby kind of nutrient potion, right? Nappies. What else?”
The next day, they paced in the courtyard, waiting for Narcissa Malfoy to make an appearance at the Hogwarts gates. Theo kept sighing and checking his pocket watch for the time. Harry and Draco circled one another and Harry kept offering words of encouragement.
Potter flashed his irritating smile in triumph and licked at his ice cream cone. “I think it’s admirable you lot are giving up your NEWT year to help them.”
“Your Aunt Andromeda is signing on with us?” Pansy’s eyes darted from Draco to Potter and back. “You have a lot of explaining to do.”
Mr Talpin got rid of the Wilsons—with no admonishments for their treatment of Orion—and now Draco and Potter were waiting for the allergy potion to finish taking effect.
“Thank you.” Draco nodded at Potter and the sour-faced Weasley beside him. “Lovely as ever, Potter.”
He wore the black shirt from their vampire night, with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He must have used magic to shrink his jeans to be so sinfully skin tight. And he had on the dragonhide boots that once belonged to Sirius Black, and inspired this date to begin with. Mid-calf and full of shiny silver buckles, they’d always been an eye-catcher for other men interested in such things and led to more than one possessive kiss from Draco so they knew who Harry belonged to.
He should have considered himself lucky then, when he got stuck to a wizard called Bob who’d come to get some requisition forms counter-signed. Bob was one of those people who was rather glad to be seen with Harry Potter and insisted on Harry joining him for lunch; in general Harry avoided people who inserted the words ‘the great’ before his name.
Draco came in as Harry was leaving. Draco’s face was wan, his eyes drooping as though ready for sleep. He rubbed his hands through his short hair and nodded at Harry before stumbling past, in search of his bed, presumably.
“You’re not happy, are you?” He sighed. “I know the feeling; my head’s all full of things and I don’t know what to do with any of it.”
“I’ve enjoyed finding out about Muggle plants. And Muggle life. None of us really knew anything about it. But there’s something to be said for a world where if you want something to happen, you can’t just wave a magic wand.”
Potter put the instrument down, but his hand lingered, resting gently on the wood. He shook his head. “There’s not much I can do. A little bit of cleaning, perhaps, but I don’t want to change the sound. I wouldn’t want to lose that character.”
“It’s a bit sad, isn’t it?” he said, his fingers tracing all the blasted names. “I wonder if my name would have been burned off by now too.”
“Draco Malfoy?” Ron said through a mouthful of pie. “I didn’t see that one coming.” He chewed thoughtfully. “I suppose you two always did have a very intense way of relating to each other. And objectively speaking, he has quite an air about him, doesn’t he? Mystery and all that.”
He wasn’t going to think about Harry, not now. He didn’t have to: he could still feel Harry, over every inch of his skin, inside his head, inside his body.
In his dreams he visited Diagon Alley for the first time again, eleven years old and new to the wonder of it all. Something inside of him knew who he was though, because when he saw Hedwig he almost cried.
Harry and Malfoy stepped away from the silent portrait, leaving her scowling at the empty hallway, and made their way back up to the drawing room. Harry went to trace the newly-restored names on the tapestry.
Draco’s arms wavered for a moment, but they continued to drag Harry up and pull him towards the bathroom.
“I’m only interested in the work.” Draco’s last few words were almost swallowed as Potter crossed the room and stood so close, Draco could practically feel the heat coming off his body. Draco still hadn’t got used to seeing Potter in his space like this. He took a step back.
Draco understands, and he shrugs too, and nods back. They sit, side by side, watching the ripple of the breeze as it moves across the lake.
Harry circled Draco’s navel with his tongue, and Draco bucked up off the bed. Harry chuckled. “Oh, I’ve not started yet.” He moved lower still, but bypassed Draco’s cock. Instead, he elected to bite down gently on the inside of Draco’s thigh. Then he kissed upward, ending by licking Draco’s balls. He closed his mouth on Draco’s cock, and Draco couldn’t help but squeeze his eyes shut, too overwhelmed to keep them open. He could hear the blood pumping in his ears, and feel his toes curling with pleasure. Draco twisted with the intensity of it, and his dick pulled out of Harry’s mouth.
A green feather floated down, and Harry caught it. He stared at it until he grew cold, standing in the garden. Quietly he put it in his pocket, and went back inside.
His arms were beginning to burn from holding them above his head, but Harry ignored the pain. And then Malfoy began to run his tongue up and down, over and around, and Harry didn’t think about his arms, or pain. He only felt the press of fabric on his face, his breath hot as it became trapped in the space, and then the knee-buckling sensation of Malfoy sucking him into his mouth. A hand grasped onto his side and pushed him back against the cool glass of the window. The hand kept Harry there, grounding him, connected him to the room and the cool night air outside, and to Malfoy in front of him.
Reluctantly, Draco took the apron and tied it on. The manager nodded and gave him one last supercilious look – which would have been comic on someone so much shorter than him if not for the fact that Draco was beneath him in all other ways – then walked out.
Lamplight filled the corners of the library; the afternoon had already fallen through dusk to the darkness of a winter evening. Harry didn’t notice, too busy trying to find some answers about the Room, something to bring back to Malfoy. It had upset him, leaving Malfoy like that on Halloween. But then again he’d seen Malfoy using his wand, successfully, in lessons, so at least he knew the wand worked.
He held onto her as though she were a tree. She was like a birch tree, flexing in the wind, flighty to some but full of truth to others. In her arms, Draco felt it all. He felt the loss of his possible friendship with Harry, all those years ago. He felt the way he’d loosened and discarded the things that had been both his aims, and the reasons he continued to chastise himself. What did it matter if he made wands like Ollivander? Or made his mother proud? People would probably be suspicious of him all his life, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t live it. With a shuddering sigh Draco let himself be soothed by the gentle pressure of Luna’s hand on his back, and the safety of her hug.
“I didn’t get to decorate a tree when I was five. You know that. In fact, you’ve been there almost every year that I have had a tree of my own. Just because you grew up in that huge mansion with a six-foot tree every year—”
“Sorry.” Harry felt his cheeks heat as he hid behind the magazine, but when he dared another look, Malfoy had stopped frowning and was smiling to himself.
“We want to speak to Mildred or Penny about a missing violin. Do you have any idea where we could find them?”
Harry wondered how long Ron could talk around the question he was obviously working towards. Luckily, Hermione wasn’t as patient.
Instead of diving in, Harry made the effort to quickly communicate exactly where they’d look. They both had their wands out, making sure they covered themselves and each other. They knew from experience just how fond all their instructors were of Stunners.
Harry noticed a movement from the other side of the room. Malfoy, like Harry, had raised his head, and every thought and feeling seemed nakedly painted on his face. A twinge of pain ached through Harry at the rawness of the want, the way Malfoy’s eyes were wide and pink-edged, and then the way a wave of sadness and fear closed down his face again. It happened so quickly he didn’t know whether anyone else had noticed, but he had. He averted his eyes before Malfoy noticed; it seemed too private a moment to have witnessed.
“Thanks.” Harry shook himself and stood up. “I’ll make some more tea.” He left his friends whispering on the sofa, but he didn’t care, because he knew that after this he was going to see Draco, and that made everything all right.
The cold held Draco’s head like a vice, and yet he could feel Potter’s warmth – or maybe just his solid presence – beside him. "I like it out here," he said. "Bloody cold though."
Malfoy made a noise that sounded like a snort that had been hastily stifled, but Harry decided to ignore it. All the goodwill and relaxation from before had ebbed away, leaving just the aches and exhaustion. It was still light outside, but Harry stood unsteadily. He wasn’t going to fight Malfoy; he felt drained, and just wanted to go sleep. “It’s been a long day,” he said. “I’m going to bed.”
Hermione still had her hand over her mouth, and looked faintly mortified at the hoot of laughter that had come out when George transformed.
Draco’s throat was painfully tight. He swallowed against the lump there. "Are you… is my apprenticeship over?"
Draco had learned his lesson that morning; he remembered clearly the gnawing ache of hunger in his gut. It wasn’t a feeling he’d experienced much before in his life. Even in the darkest days of the war, there had been house-elves to tend to his physical needs at least, and food aplenty.
Without much awareness of what he was doing, Draco staggered to the nearest place he could think of where he could sit down, and think.
Harry had never seen inside Malfoy’s room, he realised. He’d not ventured into the other bedrooms when he’d moved in - not for want of trying, they’d been locked - and Harry wondered if it was full of green hangings and pictures of snakes. Not that his room was all red with loads of lions. Perhaps the old house stereotypes were a bit too simplistic after all. It didn’t matter anyway, as Malfoy had expressly forbidden him from entering it. Which of course, now Harry remembered, made him all the more curious about what might be in it.
The old familiar resentment and dislike curled through him; the memory of years of taunts travelling through his body. He stared at Malfoy. Nothing about this made sense. “You live with Dudley Dursley?” Harry’s voice rose higher. “And he has a nickname for you?”
Rather than answer, Draco moved along the rock he was sitting on so there was space for Potter. He turned back to the dark lake waters, the sky reflected in their glassy stillness.
“I don’t want to be your friend, Draco. When we touch I feel as though my skin were on fire. When I’m with you, I’m happy. And… I think you feel the same.”
“Draco told me to talk to you.” Still nothing. Harry took a sip of his butterbeer, glanced over at Draco, who was watching them, and tried again. “Nice weather we’ve been having.”
"I am?" Draco sat back, his breath a whoosh as his chest relaced. "I am," he repeated quietly. Ollivander’s watery eyes remained fixed on him. "And I know I do," said Draco. He began to feel out the shape of the idea; he had been too scared of being rejected to do this before. "There’s so much I want to find out. I want to try everything again, because now I can hear the wood, everything is different."
They started just inside the front door. Malfoy traced a line around the door with his wand, and gradually, out of the corner of his eye, Harry became aware of a glow which followed the doorframe, up and around the door. It was a strange sensation: if he tried to look at it full on, it would shimmer and disappear for the blink of an eye. He forced himself to relax, and then it seemed to grow more solid, and he became aware of the way it spread, in what seemed to be a thin layer, over the walls themselves.
"Some of them are ok," said Harry, thinking of Teddy and Andromeda. So, apparently, did Malfoy, as his hand reached out for the charred spot where Andromeda's name had once been.
“The Slytherins with Death Eaters connections shunned me, as my father was being shunned. But that wasn’t what made my life so terrible. Politics in Slytherin meant someone was usually being punished. There was a pecking order.” He shrugged. “It was just the way it was. I was used to being at the top.”
“I know. Which is why I’ve come to tell you that I think that I’ve worked out the Counter-Curse!” Luna beamed at Harry. A rush of happiness lifted him, and he forgot all about the tower of cards, accidentally knocking it with his arm. He barely noticed the cards falling back onto the desk. He needed a moment to process this: it was finally over.
Draco laughed at the irony of Henry’s words. “It’s the epitome of tradition in my family.” He paused. “Except for the penniless stranger part, anyway.”
“You did, too, didn’t you?” asked Harry, genuinely curious. His voice felt croaky, and he realised it was the first time he’d spoken out loud all day. He cleared his throat, and continued, “Have house-elves to pick up after you, I mean. And I wouldn’t call you messy.”
“It’s just…” he looked around the room at all the smiling, waving portraits of Teddy’s dead family. “I find it hard.”
Harry smiled back at him, realising he was probably wearing as foolishly happy an expression as Draco.
"I think I've done what I can here, Potter," said Malfoy. He looked down to the parchment he was holding, and tapped it with his free hand. "I've got to go over all the figures, but I'll owl you the bill. It– it's time for me to go home now."
?" Hermione asked, giving Harry an exasperated look. "You've got a broken femur and two – no, three – broken ribs. And a significant amount of bruising." A small diagnostic light, the same green as her Healer robes, hovered for a moment more, then sped back to her wand.
them to practise magic. He couldn’t quite say why he felt it, but it was there, like an itch just beneath his skin.
had seen Crabbe fall and left the heat and flames behind them, Harry had never wanted to even see the word Fiendfyre again.
“Bollocks.” He was pretty sure they set a new password each year. “The password will have changed since then.”
Harry stood back as Malfoy cast a series of Mending Charms on the tapestry, until the scorch marks had faded, leaving blank spots where they had once been.
Hermione’s stream of questions was directed equally at Harry and Draco, for which Harry was grateful: some made Harry’s head hurt in their complexity. He was proud, too, of how gracefully and intelligently Draco kept up with the questions. At one point, Draco and Hermione began to work through the finer details of magical theory, and Harry sat back.
She took out her wand, and traced it through the air. The four tables around the hall, along with the benches full of students, slid aside to form more of a diamond shape in the hall. Harry grabbed at the table, unbalanced for a moment. The little girl opposite giggled. McGonagall moved her wand again, and brown smoke snaked out, then twisted across the hall and solidified to form a new wooden table running down its centre. Benches sprang up alongside it. The worn polish, chips and marks matched the other four tables; although smaller than the others, it looked as though it too had been there for centuries.
She settled down to show them how. Harry had to hand it to her: her Snape pumpkin was indeed rather frightening.
The old-new thrill of hearing his name said like that by Harry travelled through Draco. He reached over to the side table, finding his wand, then got down onto the bed between Harry’s legs, and parted them a little. "This might feel a little… fresh," he said, bringing his wand to Harry’s arse. He cast the best cleaning charm he knew, aiming deep.
Draco stubbed his cigarette out on the windowsill and Vanished it. His room was cold now, so he cast a warming charm before getting into bed. He fell asleep more quickly than he had in years, and dreamed of lips on the edge of a wineglass, rough fingers on the slender neck of a violin, and music to lift his soul.
The last of the dishes done, they went to sit back outside to enjoy the sunset over the lake. The sky was a deepening blue, laced through with stripes of pink cloud, everything doubled up below across the water, even as it rippled slightly in the breeze. The delicate curves of migratory birds, in their last swooping flight before nightfall, were moving silhouettes against the sky; Harry and Hermione chatted quietly, a world away from the closed and claustrophobic spaces of number twelve.
When he got back, Potter’s face was an alarming shade of beetroot red. “What did you do to him?” Draco asked in alarm.
“You are right, it is still hurt. And some of the work we do is Transfiguration and Charms-based. Other times though, we don’t know what to do, and it takes much trial and error to repair or remove spell damage. Especially from a castle this old, this complex.”
,” Draco said. “And stop looking so… speculative. I’ve no intention of any kind of quick gratification with someone who I hated for so many years.” Granger flinched, ever so slightly, and Draco sighed. “Look, I don’t hate him now. I don’t
“I never said you were.” Lavender’s calm words shocked Harry. That wasn’t how people normally responded to him. “You were really just another seventeen-year old thrust into events bigger than any of us should have dealt with. I wear my scars here,” she said, pointing at her face. “And I’ve had no choice but to deal with them, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed in the morning, I wouldn’t be able to get on with my life. I think that many of us carry scars elsewhere, out of sight.”
“Meet your standards?” said Harry, having heard the bloody phrase ad nauseam over the past week or two.
"There’s a different job for you today," Potter said. He cut the last of their bread into slices, and added some cheese from the cellar below the cabin. "Seeing as you’re here and can help lighten the load."
After all the running around and talking to portraits, it was strange to see their investigations reduced down to a few pages of Weasley’s messy scrawl.
“I don’t think I’m really up to it.” Harry couldn’t bear the idea of everyone crowding around, having fun as if there weren’t any missing faces in the room. He also didn’t want to have to face anyone’s questions about him and Ginny. He picked up the Quidditch magazine that he’d been reading before Ron had burst in, and traced his finger over the lettering on the cover. Ron stayed in the chair, but looked the other way. Harry wasn’t sure if he was going to spring up and leave, and he realised that he didn’t want Ron to go.
Harry closed his eyes, and focused on what it felt like to be him. He knew his outside was messy, but on the inside he felt a warm glow of happiness, and a low down feeling of solidity. He leaned into this feeling, noticing how it seemed to ground him in the earth. Taking a deep breath and then releasing it, he tried to see if that feeling was like an animal. He felt, rather than saw, scruffy black fur, large paws on the ground. Putting all of that sensation into one spot, Harry pointed his wand at himself and said the words to transform himself.
A familiar laugh caught Harry’s attention, and he looked over at the group at the back of the room. He saw, with confusion, that not only did it include Ron and Neville, but Malfoy was also there. Harry’s mouth hung open when Ron laughed and smacked Malfoy hard enough on the back to make him wince. Malfoy pulled back, but Ron kept talking, his arms waving as he told a story, seemingly oblivious to Malfoy’s discomfort.
“Welcome, Potter. The dining room is right this way…” Draco intoned coolly, inwardly wincing. The children would worry if he couldn’t relax.

It had been different then. Easier. With the summer sun setting, and not so many years on them yet. But Draco didn’t want to be a crack in the cauldron after Harry worked so hard to set up this special evening for them. And it felt like a nice
After another minute of looking around, they all pulled back from the stench and the twisted room, back to the clear air and calm stone lines of the corridor. Hermione pulled the door shut.
