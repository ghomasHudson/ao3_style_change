“Absolutely, Mother.” Draco replied, pushing Harry through the dining hall door.
“Ah-hhh … I-it’s getting w-worse.” Harry arched off the bed. “I f-feel like I’m o-on fire.”
“Did anyone see you arrive back on Level Two?”
"Me?" Hermione sat quietly for a moment. "Oh, just a healthy baby."
“No, you were not.” Draco waved his hand. “Though I may never know what you’re like when you’re, how would you say, in control of your faculties?”
“I thought it’d be better to let you sleep in.” He rinsed the shampoo from his hair. “Ron fire-called this morning. He said he’d be round at eleven to take your statement. Cristler sent an owl as well, it’s on the island in the kitchen.”
Draco stretched. “I couldn’t risk damaging your delicate Gryffindor sensibilities by letting you wake up alone.”
He leaned over Harry's frame and pulled a small tube from the night stand. Unscrewing a cap with his teeth, he squeezed a dab into the palm of his hand. Harry watched, enraptured by Draco stroking his own cock. Preparing himself. Satisfied that his cock was slick enough, he positioned himself at Harry's tight opening. Harry lifted his hips to meet Draco. He pushed into Harry and the immediate hot tightness almost threw him over the edge. Harry groaned at the invasion and tried to stay calm as Draco slid all the way home.
“Well—”
She plopped down onto the sofa. “I came to pop in on my favorite lovebirds. See how married life is treating you both.”
“So is the triangle.” Draco traced it. “You only see that in families descended from the Peverells.”
They all sat silently as Harry walked out of earshot.
“Maybe you should catch up,
Pansy stepped forward, pulling Draco back against the seat of the sofa. “By Salazar…” She tipped a bottle into his mouth. “Swallow it so you can talk to your husband. I doubt he wants to hear this from me.”
Harry sighed. “If you’re sure.”
“Harry, if you don’t wanna stay for this part, we’ll understand.” Ron interrupted.
“What’s the matter?” He asked, munching on a piece of toast.
“It’s after seven and I hadn’t gotten an owl from you.” Harry said quietly. “So, I… er… I brought you dinner.” He deposited a plastic bag on his desk.
Draco smirked. “So, you think I’m pretty?” Harry groaned and promptly Disapparated. “He thinks my head is pretty.” He followed suit.
“But I don’t own a set of navy dress robes.”
“Yes, about a year before I was born.” Harry replied. “Thank you, again.”
Harry arched up to meet him. They fucked wildly, desperately needing one another’s touch. Harry raked his hands down Draco’s back, as if to mark him. To create a reminder that the body underneath him was alive, that it was his. It wasn’t long before they both unraveled. Draco came, burying himself to the hilt while Harry tangled his fingers into Draco’s hair once again. They collapsed on one another, a panting sticky mess of sweat and sex. Draco laid his head onto Harry chest, listening to the sound of his beating heart, letting the sound of it lull him to sleep.
“The three witches and the knight set off down the hill together, arm in arm, and all four led long and happy lives, and none of them ever knew or suspected that the Fountain’s waters carried no enchantment at all.” Harry closed the book. “The end. Thank you for being such great listeners.”
“The lemon pepper one?” The dark-haired wizard leaned against doorframe, Draco nodded. “I suppose I could do that.”
“They only care about what your wearing, who your seen with—”
—” Harry interlaced their fingers. “You’re so different. You’re, I don’t know, so
“You didn’t see them?”
“Thank you for being on time.” She placed a plain laurel wreath atop Draco’s head. “The natives are already restless.”
Draco laughed.
“Billy Joel is an American.” Harry corrected.
“No, I would not.” Harry smiled, dotting kisses along Draco’s chin. “Take me to bed, darling.”
“Did you recognize the body?”
“Really, I’m fine.”
“It’ll be over soon. Shall we go speak with your friends?”
“I… well… er…” Harry shifted in his seat. “The flat is very nice but I never realized how large it was until I was alone. A lot.”
“Would you be happy to see a mutilated body in your office?”
“I’m not here to chastise you for it, but I saw Harry this morning and I noticed that he had some bruises.”
He waved him off. “I would have to agree, thank you for allowing us in your home.”
The warm sensation that had been sitting in the pit of his stomach started to burn. Those two little words. Two little words that Draco had been dying to hear from Harry forever. The post script had been put there to quash down any lascivious thoughts that had immediately entered his brain. He was thankful for the fact that he'd decided to walk home instead of Apparating. The cold night air kept his mind clear. As he came closer to the home that he and Harry shared, he found a little piece of paper floating near the door. Harry's script standing out boldly against the cream colored paper.
Draco turned onto his back, pulling Harry more firmly onto his chest. “I do want you here. It’s nice not to be alone in this enormous flat. The fact that you actually know how to cook has been a wonderful bonus. Though,” He dropped his chin on top of Harry’s head. “I may have to parade you around like a fancy piece of arm candy at an upcoming Ministry function.”
Harry blushed. “I was?”
“Merlin…” Draco sighed.
“If you’re sure…” Draco looked skeptical. “I think I should take Lupin’s advice and make you some toast.”
“Fine, fine! We’ll go out and get drunk and dance.” Draco threw up his hands in defeat.
“I know… I just… wish that I could remember them the way everyone else does.” Harry replied, hands curling around Draco’s.
can be a fickle mistress.”
Pansy sighed. “You never call just chat anymore.”
"Forget obscene, I did not need that image of my best mate like that swimming around my mind." Ron said flatly.
Draco and Harry walked briskly up the garden drive to the Malfoy Manor. They were dangerously on the edge of being late to meet with the caterers and Harry could feel the waves of uneasy rolling off Draco as the blonde tugged him towards the main house. They practically sprinted to the dining hall, where Narcissa sat waiting.
Draco pulled Harry so he was laying on his back, hovering over him. “Your brain could boil.”
“Imogen, do you think that the children would enjoy to hear a story from me today?”
“You can’t hurt me.” Harry nipped at Draco. “I’m too good for you.”
Pansy rolled her eyes, hanging over the back of the sofa. “Well it’s Thursday and you’re home from work at a decent hour.”
“A couple of weeks, a month maybe.”
“It’s
“Draco—”
“Can you be a dear and leave the bottle?”
. He hated using his notoriety this way, but desperate times called for desperate measures.
“I swear, Hermione. Please just drop it.”
“You definitely are.” Furey and Kearns chorused.
"What I want every Christmas." Harry answered absently, playing with baby Rose. "I want a unattractively thick jumper from Ron's mum."
Furey and Kearns left, leaving Ron alone with Draco. “Don’t worry too much about Harry. He’s rather sensitive when it comes to information about his parents.”
“Can you imagine it?” Harry set the bottle on the table. “Can you imagine me as a Slytherin?”
Harry nodded and tried to lift himself of the floor. He slipped and collapsed forward into Draco’s arms. “Why a-am I so w-weak?”
“Oh, thank you.” Draco reached into the bag. “You didn’t have to do that.”
Harry gripped the sheets and lifted his hips to give Draco better access. “Just do it…”
"Love. You. So.
Harry crept over the threshold of their bed, the dim light of the bathroom warming the room. His bloodied clothes lay in a pile just outside the bathroom door. Harry twisted a hand, conjuring a plastic bag. He leaned against the doorjamb, just like Pansy had done earlier and watched Draco in the bath. The once milky white of the water was now tinged pink, the blonde wizard’s head lolling slightly against the back of the tub. He knelt on the thick rug that stuck out from underneath the tub, , dipping a hand into the water.
“I think so, yes. If I think about it too much more my brain might melt.”
The brunette rolled his eyes. “Of course, you did…”
"Oh, you
“Don’t ask questions you will never get the answer to.” Pansy said evenly.
Draco started slow, pulling out almost completely and driving himself deeply back in. He watched as the writhing brunette beneath him came undone. Harry rolled his hips in time with Draco’s thrusts, hooking his leg to give the blonde better access. Draco took it, curling his hands around Harry’s hips.
Draco was quiet. "What I want... I want you in a red and gold corset and tutu, with matching thigh-high stockings with bows on them. A crown a top your head, ribbon around your neck, and an expression on your face akin to that of a wanton slut." He brushed his lips across Harry's cheek. "That is what I want for Christmas."
A small army of house elves brought forth an array of different plates. Franco, their caterer, began to explain each as house elves dished small servings of everything onto their plates.
.” Harry closed the book matter-of-factly. “Except I remember that my drink was shimmery. The bartender told me that there was Goldschläger in it and that’s what made it shimmery.”
Narcissa paced the drawing room worriedly. Ever since the Potter’s name had appeared next to Draco’s on the family tapestry, the whole Manor had been up in arms. Of course, Draco’s grandfather, Abraxas, had been furious. They had lost the potential to join with the Greengrass family with this careless marriage. Hopefully, this was something to be undone and they could go back to the lives they had planned for Draco and Astoria. There was a faint pop that announced a house elf had entered the room.
Draco licked and nipped his way from Harry’s neck down to the sharp curve of his hipbone. He sucked hard in the space where Harry’s leg met his hip, causing the brunette to flick his hips forward. His cock bounced against his stomach, hard as steel. Draco hovered over it, staring up at Harry. His grey-blue eyes clouded with lust as he waited for permission. Harry lifted his hips to meet Draco’s lip, the blonde licking a stripe from the hilt to tip. Harry shivered violently as Draco swallowed him whole.
“So you all can ogle him properly, out of his Wizengamot robes.” Harry raised an eyebrow.
Draco leaned back in his chair. “Really…”
Harry looked stricken for a moment. “I dressed myself.”
“Fine…” Harry sighed, standing. “Look into it then. I’m going to go shower.’”
Harry moaned. “It’s n-not necessary…”
“You sang to me.” Harry breathed. “You sang this song to me. Why would you sing to me?”
“’Mione, I assume that you are trying to make a point that Draco’s friends are a bad influence,” Harry snapped, walking back into the kitchen. “but I am an adult. Or have you forgotten?”
Draco snapped his hips. “Like that.”
little Christmas."
“We are officially married.” Harry replied flatly, holding up a folded piece of parchment. “Don’t worry I took the certificate.”
?” Harry leaned back into the pillows. “Are you sure?”
.ten.
She rolled her eyes. “You think I don’t know that.”
“We shouldn’t do this here.” Draco pulled the two of them into a sitting position, pressing kisses along Harry’s collarbone.
’ were carved into… into…” He faltered. “They were crudely carved in his chest.”
The all sat silently contemplating Harry’s new marital status. They all wanted to believe the best. That Harry and Draco were happy, but something niggled in the back of all their minds. Hopefully, they wouldn’t find out exactly what it was.
Draco groaned. "What do I have to do, Harry? What? I've been a completely open book for your to write whatever you please. I've learned to appreciate Hermione,
…” Harry panted.
Harry nodded, dropping his glass on a floating tray as he made his way over to where Draco was standing. The blonde smiled softly at him as he wrapped an arm around his waist. As they stood speaking with Remus and Sirius, Harry wavered slightly. Draco tightened his grip around the dark-haired wizard’s waist and looked down with concern.
.sixteen.
“I, er…” Harry fidgeted with his ring. “No, you’re allowed to do whatever you desire. I just never thought you’d actually fall for me. Especially given the circumstances…”
cruel." Hermione said quietly.
“Draco…” Harry mocked and then the door slammed shut in his face.
“Fine…” Hermione conceded. “Just keep the grinding in public to a minimum. You are the face of the Lilly Foundation.” Harry opened his mouth to interject, Hermione held up a hand. “I know, I know… But it would be pertinent for you to just play the good, married wizard who does not gallivant across London drunkenly.”
“Mmhmm.” The blonde murmured against his stomach. “Your skin looks like caramel. It looks very tasty.”
Draco watched Harry work the bar of soap over his chest. “You… You are the Master of Death.” He breathed.
Draco hummed. “It’s a good suit.” He extended his hand to Harry. “Remember, we’ve been together for years. You’ve got to show complete and utter adoration for me and this relationship.”
my husband, Harry Potter, or what I believe to he him.”
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose. “What?”
.four.
As if summoned, another crack of Apparition and a disheveled Draco appeared in the living room.
Draco knitted his brow. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Harry smiled, stopping every so often to hug a small groups of children. He headed back down the office corridor to the small office reserved for him. A stack of reports sat at the center of the desk. He gnawed on the bottom of his lip, Draco had been right to be cross about his absence. He sat down, going through the files. Most was the basic monthly reports on families and areas served, interactions with the Wizengamot and the Council of Magical Law, and general operating expense reports. He continued to work through, noticing bit and pieces of his normal report packet were missing. There was a soft knock at the door and causing Harry to jump slightly.
.” He turned back to the pan on the stove. “I wasn’t in control myself.”
“If it’s going to be later than nine, yes. I try to.” Draco replied, sitting back.
“No, no, I want to.” Harry quipped. “This bed is significantly more comfortable than the one in the guest bedroom and you make an
Ron saluted as he follow Quentin out of the door. Draco pressed it close, hoping to feel finality of his portion of the situation. Harry stared at him from the sofa, his green eyes tinged with worry. Draco slumped away from the front door, back to the living room. He flopped down, laying his head in Harry’s lap.
The three Slytherins stared in awe as Potter downed all four shots of tequila. He shivered slightly, the alcohol starting to seep into his system. Harry then snapped at the barman. The Gryffindor smiled broadly at the man. He flushed deeply in return at the attention.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “Really, Granger—”
“Yes…” He replied through clenched teeth. “Move. Please move.”
“Bruises?”
Harry smiled darkly. “Do you want to know a fun fact about me?”
Poppy’s eyes widened as she looked up. “Mister Potter, what can I help you with?”
Narcissa raised an eyebrow. “Why did you decide to get married? I assume there was a method to your decision making.”
“No, we’ve thought of some very plausible ideas.” Harry replied. “Except that you felt the need to act as your grandfather and shoot giant Swiss cheese-like holes in all of them.”
“Aye, but you’re quite a bit more like your mum, aren’t you?” Kearns smirked.
.” The square glowed brightly and then she returned it to her purse. “Thank you for your cooperation. He should be home shortly.”
“Hmm…” Harry moaned, snaking his arms around Draco’s neck. “Because Pansy could come in at any moment?”
“I wouldn’t eat that, he’ll be very upset.” Harry replied.
Lydia stood. “Reid has been handling them. He said between the goblins and himself that there wasn’t really a need to have all eyes on the weeklies. He thought it would be most efficient to discuss any irregularities during the monthly board meetings.”
“You have a very well stocked pantry and fridge.”
“Too perfect?” Harry nodded. “Well, there is a bit of Veela in my family’s bloodline.”
“It’ll take some time.” Draco sighed. “We should discuss living arrangements.”
“Got it.” And Harry sped up his pace to keep with Draco’s long strides. “I would like to stay attached to my testicles.”
Draco looked up from his file. “Ms. Granger, what brings you to my neck of the woods?”
“But instead I got saddled with you as a husband.” Harry snorted.
Draco reached across the table, grabbing Harry’s hand. “Yes,
“Molly, dear.” She corrected. “None of this ‘Mrs Weasley’ business now that you’re married to our Harry.”
I am not going to apologize for the length of this chapter, but to warn you that it is most likely going to be one of the heftiest ones. I was going to break it up but I thought that you all wouldn't care. You might even a appreciate a longer than normal chapter. So enjoy!
and be so disgustingly in love with each other no one will be able to stand it.” Narcissa stood. “Then you two will have however long to decide how to dissolve this. Am I clear?”
"I'm sorry."
“You hated me.” Harry replied. “Very blatantly.”
“You’re still not going to tell me how you won over Wonder Boy?”
“Fine…” Draco huffed, flipping open the dossier.
.fifteen.
“Thank you?” Harry replied, unsure if what Draco had said was a compliment.
“We’ve been keeping it quiet.” Draco added.
side? Why don't you push—"
“What are you doing here?” She crossed her arms authoritatively.
“No, they were not the happiest, though I think that my uncle rather likes you.” Draco replied, looking up from his files. “Don’t you have work to do?”
Harry slid out of bed, padding quickly out of the bedroom. Draco sighed, sliding out of the bed, picking up his pajamas along the way. He found Harry sitting in front of the liquor cabinet, book open in his lap.
“Hate is a very strong word…” Harry murmured, reaching up into the cupboard.
“His clothes are in there if you must know.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “It’s not like I have the most accommodating wardrobe.”
“You really are, you know.” He turned in the tub, grey eyes starting into green. “Do you want to know when I fell for you? Honestly fell for you?”
“Standard methods? The same used by the Ministry and the Wizengamot Administration?” Quentin asked.
Harry snorted. “Because you’re vain?”
Draco traced his finger across Harry’s cheek. “Like your beautiful face?”
"Love you." He whispered.
Narcissa scowled. “I assumed this was a well-known Muggle custom.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “We’ve been together for three months and we’ve maybe spent three weeks alone with each other. I’d be highly impressed if you truly knew me that well.”
“I know.” Draco sighed.
Draco leaned onto the table. “Well, I work in London. You… exist in London. I also have a very nice flat in London…”
Harry placed his hand over Draco’s “
“That’s not what I remember.” Draco murmured, adjusting a honeysuckle in Harry’s wreath.
“You have made some very fine points, Lord Potter.” Lord Malfoy acquiesced. “But there are a few things that Astoria has over you.”
Harry froze, breath coming in pants. “She told you about Reid?”
beautiful face when I take you."
"Wait a minute, you don't know what it is?" Draco asked.
Harry frowned as Draco stepped towards his wardrobe. “You are truly the worst type of charmer.”
The fireplace roared to life and Pansy stepped out, shaking the soot from her cloak. “Good evening, boys.”
“Was it normal for you to be alone in the office at the end of the day?”
Draco stood straighter. “Grandfather.”
He stared down at his pocket watch. “I have a little time between cases. What do you need?”
They watched as he staggered down the hallway to his room. “I haven’t seen Draco that distraught in years.”
Draco sat back on the floor and sighed. “Well you have two options. You can wait it out.”
“What?” Draco snapped.
“What is it like?” Draco dipped the dark-haired wizard. “Being the expert in your field?”
“Yes, that’s about right.” Draco replied. “Send me your travel details, Pans. You’ve earned your trip.”
“Need help washing your back?”
“Oh, yes. More tasting foods I can’t pronounce.” He stood, pulling the blonde wizard with him. “You’ll all be getting an invitation in the post for our announcement party. It would mean a lot to me if you all attended.”
“Hello Poppy.” Harry leaned onto the desk, smiling brightly at the receptionist. “I have a minor request that I’m hoping you can help me out with.”
Draco sighed. “Not Dark Magic,
Draco turned off the spray. “You are like an onion, I just peel away the layers of you and find the most extraordinary things. You do realize that this makes you one of the most powerful wizards in like
“I think we cross that bridge when we come to it.”
“I won’t tell Molly.” Hermione replied. “Or Sirius and Remus. I know this is a difficult time of year for you, just promise me that you’ll keep yourself out of trouble.”
“For some.” Draco replied, going through files. “Unless you’re from an old house, then boy-fucking is usually frowned upon.”
Harry shrugged. "I thought you'd be all suave and pull the laces loose with one tug."
Stepping away, he answered the door to find Ron accompanied by another sallow-faced Auror. He was an older man with mousey-brown hair and watery blue eyes. He was as tall as Ron, but thin and lanky where the redhead was broad-shouldered and sturdy. It surprised Draco that this man was even an Auror. Even given his height, he looked like a second-year Hogwarts student could best him in a duel. The man eyed Draco carefully, before he offered his hand.
“Yes?” Draco tipped his head to the side, watching Harry work.
“First dance?” Harry looked confused.
"Please, I
"At first, but it only lasts a few moments." Draco began kissing along Harry's collarbone. "I promise you."
“Harry?”
“I find my sexuality to be fluid.” The blonde slid behind his desk. “Most Purebloods are. We don’t find it necessary to fit ourselves into little descriptive boxes like the Muggles do.”
Draco chased him down till he stood outside the door to his bedroom. “Harry…”
off the shelf and sat down in the chair Imogen provided for him. The children wiggled excitedly, whispering behind small hands to one another and staring adoringly at him. He choose to read
“Harry is not nor will he ever be a publicity puppet.” Hermione said firmly.
Draco kissed Harry deeply, reveling in the feel of the dark-haired wizard wrapped around his own body. He rolled his hips slowly, taking everything that Harry had to give. Relishing in the desperate way Harry clung to him, as if the contact was the only thing keeping him on this plane of existence. He rolled onto his back, pushing Harry upright. He sat up with Harry in his lap, holding his face in his hands.
“My docket usually ends around five, maybe seven at the latest. I’m normally in the office until eight in the evening finishing paperwork or preparing for the next day.”
Draco slumped on the sofa, tears still streaming down his face. Pansy sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Draco was targeted tonight. The Aurors will be here in the morning, most likely your red-headed friend, but there was a body left in his office. Sitting in the chair behind his desk. Dead eyes staring directly at the door.”
He stalked back down the hallway, across the siting room, slamming the door of his office behind him. Clenching his fists, he sat back down at his desk and angrily began shuffling through his files. Potter seemed insufferable, a constant game of hot-and-cold. He had to admit that he enjoyed the demure version of the Savior as much as the feisty one.
“I was wondering if you had a moment to talk.”
“He has to answer the question for the record, Weasley.”
“So, your family… They’re rather upset you married me then.” Harry said quietly, flopping into an overstuffed leather chair.
.twelve.
Harry turned his face away from him. “Hot… So hot…”
“Your bride?” Harry scowled.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You expect to just walk into the Hall of Records and ask for what you want?”
“Oh, you have no idea.” Harry sighed, opening the door. “Shall we?”
“Impressive.”
“It’s a honeymoon suite, apparently, it’s what Muggles assume is romantic.”
“Yes, well…” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “It’s not good for you to constantly eat out and I hear the food in the Ministry cafeteria leaves much to be desired.”
“You would be correct.” Harry pushed his eggs around his plate.
Potter.”
Draco sighed. “Important things. Large things. Things that have been in motion since I was an infant.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “You should go home, shower and find the classiest outfit that you have in what I can imagine to be the most minuscule wardrobe for a wealthy wizard then meet me at this address. Two hours should be an acceptable timeframe, yes?” He handed Harry a card.
Hermione sighed. “I know I’ve picked the worst possible time to tell you—”
“J-just fucking do it!”
“She used to flounce into the department to meet your father for lunch, sometimes with you on her hip. Beautiful little thing, wicked smart. You have her smile.” Kearns said blithely.
“Would you like to go home?” Draco asked.
He scrunched his nose. “It’s actually Potter-Malfoy.”
Draco smirked. “See you later.”
“Goodnight to you too, Potter.” Draco muttered.
“I’m serious, Potter.” Draco replied. “I know we are together do to some…
"Stop staring, it's creepy." He mumbled.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “My mother?”
Draco shook his head. “Even if someone did intercept it, they wouldn’t be able to read it. I spell it so it can only be read by Harry.”
“No, we’re meeting him at eight o’clock, Mother was very specific in the Howler she sent me.” Draco explained, walking briskly. “We are going to my flat to discuss what to tell him when he asks why I decided to toss my betrothal to the Greengrasses into the fire and marry the Savior of the Wizarding World.”
“I’m not frowning.” Harry turned down the hallway.
Draco lifted the bottle out of Harry’s reach. “Some of us have to work in the morning.”
“I… um…”
“Fine…” Harry smiled wistfully. “Thank you for coming.”
“You are followed by the press?”
Draco curled an arm around his shoulders. “We don’t want to get the man in trouble, darling.”
“Mister Malfoy?”
He knew that Harry had lied. That what Hermione had disclosed to him made perfect sense. Why they had ended their relationship so suddenly. Why Harry never spoke of his previous relationships. Draco knew the situation all too well. Partners of powerful people too afraid to leave their situation for fear of the loss of the comfortable life that had become accustom to. A pretty outside with an absolutely toxic center they only showed behind closed doors. Draco slumped in his seat. He should have known better than to confront Harry directly about the situation. It had never worked with nervous plaintiffs he dealt with on what seemed like a weekly basis.
Draco placed a hand over Harry’s mouth. “I am your husband now and the world knows. It would be…
“I’m sure you saw the
“Honeymoon suite?” The dark-haired wizard groaned. “Why on Earth are we in the honeymoon suite?”
Harry pulled away. “Draco, what’s the matter?”
“Draco…” Harry sighed, cupping Draco’s cheek. “You’ve been targeted. Some would say attacked.
Franco rolled his eyes. “I suppose I could come up with a simplified menu for your husband’s delicate palate.”
of the Wizarding World was going to kill him. Murder him. Slice him down the center and pull out his entrails for the world to see. Draco ran his left hand down his face only to have something metal slid coolly along his face. He stared down at his hand and found an simple platinum ring around his ring finger. Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. He’d only seen this type of ring a handful of times and he feared the worst. Sliding out of bed, careful not to wake the dark-haired wizard. Grabbing his clothes that were strewn all over the floor, he padded quietly toward the loo. He dressed quickly, his heart hammering against his chest. He stared at his hand again, frowning that the ring was still on his finger. Taking in a deep breath, he walked back out into the room. Potter was moving, whining and groaning that his head hurt.
Draco looked up to find Harry in his doorway. “Hey… What are you doing here?”
“Why?” Draco asked. “Because your mother was raised by Muggles?”
Harry tipped his head slightly. “So, you’re just going to work the entire time? You’re not going to follow his advice and relax with your new husband?”
“Your friend convinced his compatriots that Draco would be a much better witness if he spent the night with his hands on you before they questioned him. That he’d be much more levelheaded. He would give more accurate details.” She slipped her wand from it’s holster. “I daresay it’s one of the smartest things that has ever come out of a Weasley’s mouth.”
Draco stared up at Harry’s spectacle-free face. He looked so infinitely young without them, you could see the smattering of freckles that ran over his nose. How thick and dark his lashes were. How intensely green his eyes were. Harry was handsome, ridiculously sweet, deceptively intelligent and witty. He was everything that Draco wanted while being everything his grandfather despised.
“Draco.” Harry admonished. “Be serious.”
Harry’s words spurred him on, sucking the brunette slowly, he pressed a finger gently against his entrance. Harry tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair as he felt himself being breached. He moaned deeply, feeling as Draco wordlessly performed a preparation spell.
"There's nothing to talk about." Harry said sharply.
“His loss is my gain, Pans.”
He squeezed his hand. “Then I’ll stay. Please, continue Mister Linley.”
Draco shrugged. “I had a healthy appreciation for the human form at a young age. I used to sketch a fair amount.”
you in that way."
“Of course, I could have come down to make my statement.”
Harry responded by kissing Draco deeply, pulling at his green button-down shirt. Draco pushed Harry down onto the bed and began exploring his body with his mouth. Harry was gloriously sensitive. Every little kiss, nip, and lick seemed to set the smaller man a flame with desire. By the time Draco had pulled off the ridiculously frilly undergarments, Harry was panting. Draco pressed his lips to the head of Harry's straining erection, which caused the Gryffindor to gasped loudly.
“Harry James Potter, you are a terrible liar. I am well aware that yesterday was Valentine’s Day. You didn’t owl, fire-call, or stop at the house.” Hermione narrowed her eyes. “How drunk did you get?”
who needs to be coddled!” He began down the hallway. “I am a grown man. And a wizard at that!”
Harry started, spluttering underneath the spray. “Oh, good morning.”
"Perfectly fine." Harry said breathlessly.
“Lovely to see you again, Mother.”
Harry nodded. “Let’s get you out of these awful clothes, yeah?”
Draco leaned in towards Harry. “Spanakopita is just a fancy title for spinach and cheese wrapped in phyllo. You’ll like it.”
Sighing, he trudged down the hallway to their bedroom. Pushing opening the door, he found Harry lying face up on the bed.
“Thank you.”
circumstances, but I would never wish you any ill will. I would never abuse you.”
“Haha…” Harry sat back, hands falling into his lap. “Wait… Are you legitimately in love with me?”
Harry waited until he heard the click of the bedroom door. He dunked his head again to wash out the soap and then exited the tub. He dried himself quickly and pulled on one of Draco’s t-shirts and and a clean pair of boxers he had laid out earlier. Grabbing the towel and drying his hair, he made his way to the living room. Pansy was pacing, twisting one of the many rings on her finger.
Hermione shook her head. "We... Well, we decided to do things the old-fashioned way. We won't know if it's a boy or a girl till its born."
.seven.
Draco glowered at Harry. “I am not fond of the implication that I’m a philanderer...”
“Only fifteen minutes early?” Draco said silkily.
“After the whole—” Harry paused, nervously fidgeting with the edge of his shirt. “After Ginny and I ended things, being in public wasn’t my favorite but I promised Hermione that I’d meet her for lunch. I was waiting in the Ministry Atrium for her when I saw you walking through. I hadn’t seen you since the trial, but there you were. White button-down, grey vest and trousers, a purple tie, Wizengamot robes hanging over your arm.” He smiled wistfully. “It was the first time that I’d ever seen you with your hair not slicked back. You had it parted to the side and you pushed it back as you walked through the Atrium. You looked so… regal. I talked about you for twenty solid minutes at lunch. Hermione was flabbergasted I could talk about you in such an appreciative manner. I told her it wasn’t hard to when the subject looked like Prince Charming had stepped out of a storybook and into the Ministry Atrium.”
“I’m sorry, sir?” Draco’s eyebrows threatened to disappear into this hairline.
“Really? What did he say?”
Draco stiffened. “Yes.”
"Rose is a perfectly healthy child, Ronald." Hermione said darkly.
“Just HSW Cristler and DHS Mogin.” Draco was thoughtful for a moment. “And two clerks. Rhys Payter and… er.. a new kid. Travill. Alfie, I think his first name is.”
“Draco, darling! It’s a bit early for you to be calling. Did you not enjoy your night with your husband?”
Harry flushed scarlet. “Oh… er…”
“Your un-uncle did…” Harry moaned. “I t-thought it was rosé. W-why is it im-important?”
Hermione and Ron looked at one another. "You probably know more about him now then we do. I'm so sorry, Draco."
"Draco, we've already talked about this." Harry lifted Rose's sleeping form. "'Mione, I'm going to put Rose to bed."
Draco stood, pulling the brunette up with him. Harry faltered, his inebriated state making him unsteady on his feet as he made his way down the hallway. He stumbled backward into the wall, tugging Draco with him. He snickered, curling his arms around the blonde’s neck, carding his fingers into his hair. Harry molded his body to Draco’s, grinding his hips. Draco growled, lifting Harry so that his legs came around his waist.
“Y-you don’t h-have to do th-this.” Harry panted. “M-maybe we can—”
“I’m hot… Hot…” Harry panted, arching slightly. “My whole body is hot.”
“You’ve landed yourself quite the man, Draco.” Lysander eyed Harry. “Not that your father would have approved of the union.”
“No, no… If you own all the Hallows, you are the Master of Death.”
Narcissa placed the other wreath on Harry’s head. “You look rather dashing, Harry. Dress robes suit you.”
"Aw but he's just so cute!" Ginny squealed, then she picked her nephew up from the ground.
"Mother?" said Draco, still lying on various pairs of hands.
He considered himself lucky to be able to talk to her after the match, he would have totally asked for advice.
"Oh, wow!"said Harry, happy as ever. It was about time George could have something so beautiful and positive happen in his life since his twin brother's death.
One warm afternoon, in May, as the three happy couples were chilling under their tree, basking in its shadow, an owl delivered a very special letter, it was white with golden borders and there was a rose in each angle.
"I never would have left you alone." Harry was saying when Ginny spoke.
It was a girl who was sitting next to a guy she apparently found attractive, as she would smile at him and play with her hair from time to time.
However, his smile was cut short when he heard voices coming from outside.
"What? You're crazy! You know your sister is unstable lately!" Harry screamed.
"Me too, my love." Draco let slip. The moment he said those words he realized what he had just said. He called Harry my love. What was happening to him? He had never been like this with a person, let alone Harry Potter. Yet, he had said those words. He was really changing and he didn't mind it too much, he found. But he was still quite shocked at his own words.
Ginny frowned at that.
They were stronger than ever.
The little toddler had fiery red hair, just like his father, and Hermione's brown eyes.
This was their best kiss so far, Harry thought. It was sweet, soft, but also full of love. It was their first kiss as a married couple, so it was, by far, their most special one.
The Gryffindor crowd boomed in cheering and applause, Luna and Hermione hugged happily.
Harry blushed and felt all warm and fuzzy inside. He didn't know if it was the effect of all the butterbeer he had consumed, but he sure felt good.
Rosemary looked quite disappointed upon seeing that her boyfriend was not Harry, nor Draco.
"Oh, here you are!" Molly exclaimed as she ran to them. She gave each one of them a quick hug. Normally, she would have been extremely affectionate to them, but in that moment she was too anxious to even think straight. "Come on, it's about to start! Ginny, Hermione, Best Man, come with me, quick!" she said, then she grabbed her daughter and son by the arm and pushed them inside of the tent, hurriedly. Hermione followed them in.
Hermione's mouth dropped when she heard those words. How had Ron found out about that?
Draco gulped, feeling guilty. Harry's look contained a strong disappointment and he knew he had caused it.
Harry had been open mouthed for the whole time that Draco had spoken.
Her daughter gave her a puzzled look. "On what? Harry? I had no idea he would..."
"Oh, Ron is coming in a bit, I don't know if the others are still asleep." Hermione replied, slightly massaging her tired face. "I'll go check."
Those words echoed through his brain, freezing it still. He blinked once, then twice.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Oh, here we go. I mean," She said. "We've already established that we are fine with you and Malfoy, but... are you sure you can really trust him? After all, this is Malfoy we're talking about." She continued, in a worried tone.
Her hair was messier than usual and she had circles around her eyes. She was still in her pajamas.
Harry and Draco rushed to the board, seemingly bumping into each other, but it was staged.
"Oh, Heavens, are all magical weddings like this?" Mrs Granger asked Hagrid.
The Room of Requirement didn't fail to deliver expectations. There was a table, dressed in a very elegant table cloth, an emerald green one that sported a Slytherin patch.
"Ginevra Molly Weasley, will you be my wife?" she asked.
She had taken it personal. "Draco, you could have had me, but you chose to fool around with Potter, of all people!"
Luna had only flown from time to time, like for the lessons with Madam Hooch or during Christmas time in the Weasley household, but she wouldn't do it that often.
Ginny's wand flew in the air, but Pansy still had her wand with her.
After all, he was always around, would sleep in his dorm... he was becoming fond of him.
"I do love you," said Lucius. "Hence my pain in seeing you so... mingled with this... trash."
He cursed himself. Couldn't he have waited until that night to kiss his boyfriend? He would have been in an impenetrable room. But no, he had to confess his undying love for Draco in that stupid office, one that anyone could have entered.
Harry was too shocked to say anything. Or to do anything.
"What do you want?" Harry spat. "Can't you see that this is not a good time?"
Draco didn't mind her, he got up and walked to his father. Then, he was only able to say a few words.
Ron seemed to relax, he had been so anxious about meeting them and now he looked pretty content.
After the baby was clean, the midwife wrapped him in blankets and gave him to his mother, who held him close to her chest, her eyes watering as she met her son for the first time.
"They should all be infuriated!" Pansy protested. The look on her face was similar to Ginny's.
The feelings Draco experienced in that kiss were hard for him to describe. It was their first kiss after the whole disaster of not long before, so it made him feel safe, calm and at home.
The redhead was supposed to be there as a supervisor, making sure that everything would have gone by smoothly.
"Oh, Ronald, you're so headstrong, sometimes you irritate my nerves!" Hermione dug into her promises. "But I love you, you're the love of my life and I will love until until I take my last breath."
At this, both his best friends gasped.
But they undeniably fell in love, almost at first touch.
When they arrived in their first class seats, Ginny could barely hold her excitement. She felt happiness take over her, as she jumped around squealing.
Blaise looked at him with a raised eyebrow. "Are you drunk?"
"Oh, a mistletoe." Luna observed. "Nargles like to infest these. Thank God I have my necklace to keep them away." She said, moving her head excitedly and fidgeting with her butterbeer caps necklace.
Additionally, he had not informed Harry about the 'cuddling' incident.
However, in the wizarding world, such exception was granted in France - he had hear Fleur talk about it, once.
Christmas break was now around the corner.
Hermione learned a valuable lesson that day, she should have never doubted Ron's love for her.
"It's something many of us would have done to protect the people we love." Harry expressed.
Harry had just opened his mouth to reassure his friend when he heard a "psst" coming from Draco.
He would always find ways to make Harry miserable, as some sort of a 'vendetta' for refusing him. Harry was everything that he wanted to be.
"Oh, that's just Luna." Harry said, not that Draco was much relieved.
Draco's grey eyes widened in utter terror as he wasn't completely clueless as to what that might be. Who that might be, to be exact.
***********************************************************************************************
The next days went by pretty fast, in a blissful motion of things. They were filled with backyard Quidditch, snow ball fighting, hot chocolates and muffins.
"Enough!" Professor McGonagall yelled, but no one seemed to pay attention to her.
It was beautiful, the light in her room made her pale body shine, thus looking like she was made of marble.
Luna deepened the kiss, making it more passionate.
It was a honeymoon suite, but Ginny didn't reveal which couple would have slept there on their first night as spouses.
"Is that Pansy again?" Harry spat, worried that the girl had done it again.
The last time had been for Draco and Harry's birthday in Hogsmeade, that they celebrated on the same day.
Hermione's Grandmother looked a lot like her, she had the same kind of bushy hair, just that hers was white. She was a frail woman, possibly in her eighties, her voice was slightly dreamy, kind of like Luna's.
His Gryffindor friends plus Luna all gave him loving looks as they clapped their hands for him, while Harry, who had been giving him a proud look for the whole duration of his speech, whooped for him, on his feet, completely shameless. Some people were giving him looks, but he didn't seem to be bugged by them.
He had been heartless. Maybe even his father had taken a part in this vicious plan, pretending to hate his son while he was planning his exquisite revenge.
Draco and Harry were soon swarmed in a crowd of best wishes and affection.
In the end, Molly was a triumphant winner-- she won 5 times in a row against Ginny, Draco, Harry and, in the end, Ron.
"Harry, what... Draco can't be here!" Hermione said in a worried tone. Harry completely ignored her. "Guys we have a problem!" He said.
Then, they both froze when they realised that Xenophilius was standing right behind them.
As the woman spoke, Harry couldn't hear a word of what she was saying. He was too much in trance, looking into those grey eyes that would always hypnotize him.
"I am being bullied by my own house." Ginny said to her friend. She had her head down in order to avoid her gaze, as she had a lump in her throat.
"You do that!" Harry yelled back, but he smiled at him when no one was looking.
Both father and son had broken the bonds that kept them together. Draco felt as if a hot knife had just slashed his chest. It hurt to say those words, but then again, his father didn't seem to break down when he'd said the same thing to him, only minutes before.
The only thing he wished for was to never see her lying face again.
"Dad!" Luna said, then she ran to him.
The other people in the room wouldn't dare say or do anything. No wands were raised.
"What, he touched you there and said that it was just cuddling? Half-naked?" Pansy asked Draco, the morning after, visibly entertained.
For one, they would always be sitting close, they would hold hands and call each other "love" or "babe".
Draco was puzzled when he heard the word "map". That's why Harry always knew where he was, he had a map that let him do so. "You have a map that tracks people down?" He asked, addressing his boyfriend.
The French plus Draco all rumbled in joy for their triumph on the other team.
His father knew that he was in a Muggle place at the moment. The howler would have been ruthless. Draco felt panic overrun him.
Oh, he had done it. He had finally told it like it was.
The Dursleys weren't there, Harry noticed, not that he minded too much.
At this, the teacher stopped working on the parchment and looked at him.
He was very lucky to have them.
Draco's words got through his father like a knife through butter. His eyes were widened, as he was incredulous. He looked at his hand without the wand, then he glared at his son.
So much had changed in their lives since then, who would have known that ten months later they would be standing in front of each other, ready to tie the knot.
Rosemary's reaction to the magical disappearance didn't match expectations.
Harry watched as the two friends rekindled, without saying a word. He didn't buy it one bit, even if Pansy was sobbing her heart out. It seemed to him like she was just acting, so that she'd be back in Draco's grace again, just for convenience. However, he didn't externalize these feelings to his boyfriend.
"I'll send you back to Blaise." He teased.
"Oh, Potter, I'm surprised you haven't noticed yet... You have got some nerve, really! Having Draco all to yourself! When we both know that he should have ended up with me!" Jean Jacques said, fury in his face.
Once again, that couple had proven themselves as the cutest.
There were so many excited people that it was almost impossible not to get lost in the screaming crowd. Not to mention, it contributed to the August heat's worsening.
"Are you ok?" he asked him in a worried tone.
Ginny threw herself in the middle of the dance and grabbed Luna's hands.
Professor McGonagall, Hagrid, Miss Sivan, Mr and Mrs Weasley tried to stop Lucius and his henchmen by firing silent Stupefys, but to no avail. He dodged every shot.
He was going to propose at the wedding, as part of his speech. It would have been so romantic, in his opinion.
"Well, this is unexpected." Harry said, feeling surprised. He thought that the silence in the Great Hall meant trouble was to come. But, he was happy to be wrong. He turned his head to see Draco's reaction, he was just as surprised as he was.
"Thank you, Miss Granger!" said the Headmistress.
All the people in the room applauded and whooped, many of them crying in happiness.
For example, he had found love and it was with the person that he had been hating for ages.
Draco hesitantly accepted her offer and followed her out of the room.
"Told you, you had to see that." Ginny said with her arms crossed, giving Pansy a triumphant look.
"You were accomplices, weren't you!" the redhead said once the shock died down.
"Time to see the show!" Arthur shouted.
"Tell her, Harry." Ron said in that same stern voice from the night before. Harry gulped. "Well, Mione... I've just broken up with her... But she didn't take it that well..." Harry said as he looked at his now ex. Hell, she had taken it quite horribly.
"But, he's Lucius' son, honey!" Arthur argued.
"Let's go to sleep, shall we? It's, like, 2 am." the black haired boy said, not daring to look at the blond one.
"Ah, Gin Gin, you looked so hot there with your red dress." Luna said, tittering.
When the food arrived, Hermione and Harry smirked each other, eager to see the reaction their boyfriends would have had upon tasting pizza for the first time.
Lucius had no chill, really. He had left his son for dead, what was the point of sending him such a humiliating letter after months?
Meanwhile Draco, at the Slytherin table, was not willing to touch food. He was looking down at his plate, sadly, unable to get the fight from the previous night out of his head.
"Ron, did you tell your dad?" the Slytherin asked.
"I'm not apparating with her." Harry said, referring to Ginny.
"Just follow me." The redhead ordered. She started walking, her head turned to see if Pansy was coming or not.
"You will have a dorm of your own..."Luna resumed.
Someone had reanimated Harry, because he was standing up, giving her the scariest of death stares.
"They can't see us coming in together... they'll get suspicious."
The rooms looked pretty tidy and there was no dust in them, they were also very bright and the home decor was impeccable.
"Sure, why not?"
He knew that something greater than stress cause by exams had to be behind his lover's strange behaviour.
"Harry and Draco are my favourite couple." Luna said, shrugging. "...after me and my lady." she corrected herself, as Ginny had given her a death stare.
Then, he told them all about him, omitting the details about the weird questions, as he didn't want Harry to worry.
"Father, I am not you." Draco spat. "Now I know, I don't want to be like you. You're a cruel man, You cut me out of your life because you didn't agree with my life choices, when I always did anything I could to make you happy, even if it meant being a death eater. I am still mourning over losing you. I spent months waiting for you to contact me, but if you are not willing to accept me for who I am, then I don't care about seeing you."
That night, Luna couldn't sleep.
Luckily, he had Harry's hand to hold throughout the whole journey.
"Let me guess, you two engaged in one of your morning duels?" Harry and Draco just looked at each other. "Take a seat, now. You're lucky I'm in a good mood today, or I would have removed a bunch of points."
Everyone looked at Luna, even the players. She didn't look like it, but she was very strong.
"How can I not cry now?" The big man said, sniffling. "C'mere!" He pulled everyone in a bone crushing hug, including Draco, who could hardly believe what was happening. He had sued that man five years before and had criticised his work as a teacher on many occasions. He must have been very kind-hearted.
"I'm the one that's throwing you, Potter!" He slowly put his hands on the other boy's chest, amused at his reaction to it.
She found him attractive, if anything.
"Now you're defending him? He wants to get in your pants, that bastard! I noticed since day one."
"Oh, fantastique! Every male studont in France was in love with 'er, but I wasn't. Yeah, I'm gay." Jean Jacques replied.
Next morning, Harry met up with Ginny in the common room before breakfast. It had been their routine every day so far.
The room was definitely luxurious, it had a king-sized bed with white sheets embroidered with "just married", next to it was a heart shaped jacuzzi with red candles placed on its borders.
"Yeah you just wait until next time." said The Slytherin.
"Who is this whore you're screwing, huh? Is it Luna? Is it Cho? That little..." Ginny kept raising her voice, her face was red and she was a bit sweaty, she was down right infuriated.
"Let me go!" She screamed, trying to wiggle away, but Ron's grasp was too vigorous.
That night, at dinner, Harry still had some scarlet and gold confetti in his hair from the celebration in the Common Room. Luna had been invited, too. Draco had not attended, as he was the Captain of the losing team. He was supposed to speak to the Headmistress, anyway.
"I don't understand..." The Gryffindor said as the Slytherin sat on his bed next to him, after he put the picture back in its place.
"Ah, you're Arry Potter's boyfriend, aren't you? We read about the scandal, in France."
The pizza place they were in belonged to a family friend of the Grangers, so he sat them in his best table and promised to reduce the final price.
"Ah, give him to me now! I want to hold him and smell his head. Babies always smell good." Luna tittered.
"Ginny, please! Think about what you're about to do! What do you think our mother would do if she saw you like this? This is not who you are!" Ron said, hoping to bring his sister back to her senses. Ginny seemed to consider it for a bit.
Ginny couldn't help laughing out loud at that. "I was just going to say that there's something in the air that made our boys go crazy. All jokes aside, I'm so happy for you, bro and sis!" she said, addressing her brother and his now fiancée. She then hugged them both tightly.
The man spoke in English, since half the spectators didn't know French well.
"It's what we've always been, after all, friends." Harry observed. True, their relationship wasn't much more special than a friendship, except for the kissing bit.
"Who might that be?" asked Harry, alarmed.
"No..." he gulped.
Well, she was never wrong, after all, but she wondered, had she been right, if that would be the right thing to do.
Harry's soulmate's words didn't help him in his fight against crying hysterically.
"Woo!" Ginny whooped. "You did it! Now, watch me as I do a series of loops."
Ginny's body was so beautiful that Luna couldn't keep her mouth from gaping.
Luna sighed contentedly when they parted. "Is this the whole of the reward?" she asked, acting disappointed.
Everyone followed suit.
"Dear Hogwarts,"He began, "Yes, as you can see, Draco and I are a couple. True, we weren't ready to come out, but we were forced into it by the very people we trusted the most. So, what can we do? They were surely hoping to bring us down but we chose to be brave." And as he finished his speech he held his lover's hand in his.
Ron had begun a while before, so this would be his second bottle.
After paying for their drinks, the four of them rushed to the Grangers' house, fearing that the howler would burst.
"Sure!" Harry said. He mentally thanked Ron for interrupting the kiss with Ginny.
"Oh... that's... " he mumbled.
He'd seen that Harry had raised some eyebrows at his and Pansy's reconciliation.
That girl wasn't so bad, not one bit, once you got to know her.
"Such melodrama!" Said Luna, rolling her eyes at the ugly crying fest.
Ginny gave a soft laugh. Luna found that her laugh was her favourite sound in the world, it was so cute and always made her squeal.
He was growing more and more convinced that the woman right before him was either a fairy lover or a hybrid herself.
Luna had recently got a new family member, Miss Sivan had become her father's girlfriend, so she had moved in with the Lovegoods.
"I don't have time for your childish matters. I know you two don't like each other, but you need to finish this work, or you won't be able to pass this year, I'm afraid."
"Captain and beater Gwenog Jones!"
"Draco, the offer still stands." he simply said, then he took his wand from the floor and disapparated, emitting a loud 'pop'.
Draco didn't remember having been angrier than he was in that moment. This girl he had considered one of his best friends had done something unspeakable to him, yet she was there with her freaking pleading eyes. He had been a fool to trust her again after she had already stabbed his back once, he wasn't going to fall for her manipulative ways, not anymore.
A lot of people came, like Susan Bones and other fellow D.A. members.
"Friends, Loved ones..." Miss Sivan began in her tinkling voice. As she spoke, glitter fell on her shoulders. "We are gathered here to witness the marriage of George and Angelina..."
Mr Weasley gave Harry a soft squeeze in his shoulder. He didn't know that the boy took it a sign of encouragement. He must have simply done it out of affection.
Ginny decided to leave her hair straight, with a braid that encircled her head like a headband.
"He was vile!" Said Hermione, feeling utterly disgusted. "Just like his look-alike."
He was always taken over by overwhelming joy whenever he was with him.
Ron wasn't surprised when he saw that his package contained a red jumper with a brown letter "R" knitted on. Well, at least it wasn't maroon.
"She knows? How? Oh God, she's not gonna tell on us, is she?" The pale boy was now panicking. "Oh she saw us once... she's not gonna tell anyone, don't worry. It's just... She's getting under my skin!" Harry let out a frustrated sigh.
"Thank you, my loves! This will be my way of thinking of you every time I'll miss you." Ginny expressed.
Ginny laughed heartily, clapping her hands. She had not laughed like that in a very long time.
His lips formed a wicked smile as he felt the other boy shiver at the contact.
Lucius couldn't help trying to hurt him, by the looks of it.
Her breath caught in her throat as she admired Luna's almost naked body.
Harry took off Draco's shirt and began kissing his way down on his body until he reached the hem of his pants. Shortly after, he removed them, with trembling hands, leaving him in nothing but his boxers.
George didn't look so good, but his recent attachment to his ex class mate, Angelina Johnson, had brought him back to work, at least. He had an unkempt beard and his hair was all over the place, but at least he was out of bed.
He came out looking extremely posh. His hair was drenched with gel, but it still looked a mess.
The first match was played by Arthur and Molly, who knew the set very well.
"So," Harry said, ignoring the innuendo. "The portkey is the invitation letter. Everyone ready?"
The news of George and Angelina's wedding inspired Harry.
"You still made a fool out of me."
Ginny's dress was the same that she had worn for George and Angelina's wedding.
His new room mate had yet to come to Hogwarts, as he had traveled from far away.
Harry and his best friend, Ron, were both waiting at the altar. They were one at its left, the other at its right side.
"I picked him!" Hermione intervened, smiling. She was holding a book, which Ron must have given her as a gift.
"Nargles like to come and lay their eggs in our backyard," Luna explained, as she had seen her girlfriend's puzzled expression. "So we hunt them for Easter! It's so fun, you'll see! The winner is proclaimed Easter queen or king and they are fed by someone else throughout the Easter lunch."
Ron nodded his head, then he rose to his feet, bent slightly to give his girlfriend a peck on the cheek and, ultimately, he left.
The green eyed boy had started feeling nauseous. His boyfriend was crying and he stuttered his words... He was fearing that he would slap him with a sound 'No.'
If Ginny and Luna were having a blissful date, Draco and Harry's situation was quite the opposite.
Draco was assaulted by Luna's bone crushing hug. "Now you have to keep the Nargles away from him, till death do you part!" The girl squeaked as Draco giggled.
It had been rough, completely emotionless and full of only lust.
"Oh, I know, my love, I don't expect you to grant me forgiveness right away... But know that, even though I can't understand your liking for a male... I will support you through it. Even if it means the Malfoy name will not see its successors through you."
"So, do you remember what I told you?" she asked them all.
He didn't know about them yet.
They defied expectations when their relationship grew stronger and more mature.
Ginny finally decided that it was time to ask her girl what in the world those nargles were. She wouldn't go a day without talking about them. They were her top enemies. Hell, she even thought that they ran through her backyard to lay their chicken eggs.
Adrian Martin had dark hair, a pointy nose and a large jaw. His protective specs covered his face but they didn't completely hide it. Draco and Harry recognized him right away.
It had been George's idea, as he felt that the surprise effect would have been better for the future bride and grooms.
"Aw!" Their four friends said at the same time.
It was probably someone from Beauxbatons or Durmstrang.
"Hey, who said we won't have some fun later? It will be a cool way to slither into the New Year." Harry said, getting up.
"Potter, I'm no boyfriend type. Right now all I want to do is shag you. Tell me if you don't want the same thing, and I'll leave you alone." He said this knowing that, now that he had him under his spell, the other boy wouldn't have done that.
He had dark, brown hair, set in place by a generous amount of gel.
"May the Captains shake hands." Madam Hooch instructed.
But that wasn't Harry Potter.
Draco's yell was louder than Ginny's. He was fangirling, to say the least.
Dirty Weasley girl, he should have known that she would try to sabotage them in a way. Why couldn't she just keep her nose out of other people's business? He began to think that the only purpose of her existence was to infuriate him.
He felt so stupid for thinking that their relationship had just been a plot to hurt him.
Ginny couldn't help smiling at her girlfriend's cuteness.
Then, the Slytherin girl spat the truth out like it were bad medicine.
That afternoon, Hermione, Ron and Harry went to Hogsmeade, as Luna had suggested.
But the girls didn't give him the littlest bit of attention, as their post game excitement brought their lips to press onto each other.
Half of the guests were unable to move, others would fight.
Both girls were looking at their feet in shame. Ginny was the first one to speak.
"Hey, baby!" Harry greeted him happily.
After what felt like forever, she took a breath. "Well, it's true..." the girl said, holding Luna's hand. "We are together."
Not that many people were out, though.
"Draco, what's up with you? Being late for potions? And also, where were you all morning?" Pansy asked the blonde boy. "Nowhere you should care about." He responded. She gave him a look that expressed that maybe she knew more than he thought. He froze in his tracks as she said: "I know what you did. And soon everyone else will know."
"Pa-pansy?" Draco managed to say. He was shaking a little.
Ginny took her friend's hands into hers. "Mione, steady your breaths, ok? If you're this distressed, you might harm the baby." She tried to calm her down.
-Your Father, Lucius Malfoy."
Differently from the others,Rosemary wasn't frightened by the presence of that man.
On New Year's Eve, though, Hermione had to leave, as she had promised her parents she would spend that day with them. Ron didn't go with her, as he wasn't ready to meet her parents just yet.
They were going to snatch him away to do Merlin knew what to him, so he didn't feel remorse.
Harry let out. All he wanted in that moment was to be left alone. He didn't need another one of those mom-like scoldings Hermione was so fond of.
"Don't touch him." Draco said fiercely, clenching his fists.
No one spoke for a while. Draco seemed to be unable to produce a sound.
He ran his hands through the messy hair, pulling softly as Harry bobbed his head.
Both his friends were undoubtedly appalled. Hermione took a deep breath. "Look, Harry... You're inevitably going to fall in love with him, I know you. But don't come running to me when he breaks your heart in two." She said calmly. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but then changed his mind. He simply got up and then went to sit at the Ravenclaw table next to Luna.
"Oh Draco, I love you so much!" Harry whispered.
When the now fiancés parted, Harry put the ring on Draco's finger and then embraced him in a loving hug, breathing him in. Their happiness skyrocketed through the roof, infecting every guest present.
+++++
He would have told Draco that he had to be out to visit the Ministry for some aurors counseling.
Luna was not so lucky because something was eating away at her guts.
"Dear Ginevra Weasley," she said, pulling out a piece of parchment from her pockets and starting to read it. "my love and best friend, ever since the day I met you, which was September 1st, 1992, I became mesmerized by you. You hit me like a tidal wave, honestly.
"I can't believe I fell for this!" He yelled. "How could I ever think, for even one second, that you could ever love me? You must hate me so much, since you played me so well! All our relationship was nothing but a lie!" As he said this, Harry went back to running.
"Uh-oh." said Ginny, visibly entertained.
Ginny ran happily to Luna, then she twirled her around.
"Alright, see you later, Mr and Mrs Malfoy." Said the talking head before disappearing completely.
"How dare you speak in such an obscene manner? These people are not your people, Draco. They must have put a spell on you or something, because I can't recognise you!" Said Lucius, walking closer to his son. He looked downright sickened.
He only needed a ring. He knew he could find one in Diagon Alley, but he couldn't really leave the school premises without permission. After the war, even students of age were put on a watch.
"It was nothing, really." Draco interrupted her. "It was just that I had copied from Granger during Potions." He shrugged.
"But if you don't feel the same, I-" he tried to say but his boyfriend wouldn't let him finish, he simply pulled him into the most passionate kiss ever. "I love you too." Draco said, out of breath, after they had parted. Feeling like the happiest boy in the world, Harry pulled him into another, more passionate kiss.
"You too!" said Ginny, trying to adjust herself in the embrace.
Suddenly, a mistletoe appeared. Both girls looked at it, Ginny was nervous.
"Who is that man? What is he doing here, Hermione? Does he know that this is home invasion?" Hermione's dad said, angry, as he got and from his chair and walked to the intruder.
All while Neville and Blaise kept the others busy, he grabbed his immobilised son by an arm and dragged him to his mother.
Harry asked himself how he had never noticed, given they shared a room.
"That is just so pure and... I just can't!" Ron said, his tears flowing on his cheeks. "They grow up so fast!"
"Oh, shut up, Malfoy. I think you are." Ginny smirked.
"You told me I was a piece of shit, well, let me be one! And besides, why do you care if I'm here on my first date with Draco?" Harry snapped. Really, why did they have to be so nosy in his things? They had called him an asshole just a day before and now there they were, interfering with his blissful date.
It’s all so nice, soft, and warm. Perfect.
With every thrust into you, your hate reaches new heights. It’s a firestorm. The flames flaring higher until he stops for a second. You’d swear if you could. If you wouldn't crave it when he's not there.
Draco can’t resist. He spreads his fingers slightly, looking between them to make sure that—yup, it’s still on display. “For fucks sake, Potter. Adjust your robe.” He looks down at the floor, feeling his cheeks light up,
“No. I’ve waited long enough and behaved. Until you came in here looking like a cover model of GQ.”
A moment later, the warm body that had just been straddling his vanishes. He opens his eyes, blinking at the sudden loss of heat. In one swift motion, Potter’s turning him to face the fire, both of Potter’s strong hands on his hips and pulling him closer to the edge of the bay window. Potter’s on his knees in front of him, a wicked smile on his face as he undoes Draco’s belt.
Draco breaks off the kiss only once he’s balls deep inside Harry. He presses his forehead against Harry’s, panting, before he pushes himself up for a better angle. He sets an easy pace, pumping slowly, holding Harry’s legs open as he watches his own cock slide in and out of Harry.
“Absolument!” he blurts, maybe a tad too loud, and —
— in the wrong language. Draco blushes, and it’s impossible for Harry to not have noticed. “Of course,” Draco says again, in English this time.
Draco sighs heavily.
Five minutes later, Draco is fumbling with Harry’s clothes again because the man he’s in love with is incapable of dressing himself in anything but jumpers, joggers, or jeans. Harry’s nervous energy is making it impossible for Draco’s spells to work, and Draco feels green eyes watching him intensely as he buttons the sleeves of Harry’s outer robes manually.
To his surprise, Potter gets up and cups Draco’s face tenderly, before he captures Draco’s mouth in a heated, though excruciatingly slow kiss. He mouths a trail of kisses all the way to Draco’s ear, sucking on the lobe. “Do it,” he whispers.
When Draco had first been brought here, it had been all but simple to fall asleep on this mockery of a bed. He had been used to soft feathers, silken-like sheets, and big beds, not straw on wood that was barely wide enough to fit his body. The clothes, too, were different. He’d been forced to trade expensive cotton tunics in various colours for scratchy wool garments and black linen outer robes.
Draco turned on his side and stared past the light the single candle provided into the darkness. There were no other breaths to be heard; the dorter was uncharacteristically empty for three novices had been stricken down by a cold and found themselves in the infirmary. The final one Draco had become accustomed to had taken his vows over a month ago, sleeping now among the brothers.
There’s barely a metre to the roof edge, so the only direction is forward. The easiest way to tip the scales would be to draw your gun, but before you could even do so much as point it in his direction, he’ll have thrown his knife at you. Malfoy won’t make the first move. Being in a defensive position, especially with a knife in hand, is always an advantage.
Over time, music had brought them closer together. With every visit, their bond grew and feelings for each other had grown. One day, Harry couldn’t hold back anymore and kissed Draco after he’d finished a song.
he arrives — Draco might have alcohol poisoning. Stealing food from the buffet hasn’t worked. The food is sealed under charms until the hosts officially greet all the guests.
Since Draco is in dire need of a shower, he goes into the bathroom. He quickly undresses and steps into the tub, pulling the curtain shut.
Reaching for Draco’s hands, Potter pulls him to his feet as Draco kicks off his shoes and steps out of his pants, leaving them behind on the floor, crumpled. He guides them both over to the white, soft rug in front of the fire that’s burning even brighter than before. As he walks, Potter discards his bathrobe and slippers, leaving him fully naked, and Draco still half-dressed.
Around them, the entire crowd is standing in a ring of shocked faces. Or shock
It’s not at all like this, but Draco has to admit that he’s gone through a lot of wands ever since Potter started working here. Maybe it’s fate?
“Why did you refuse to be in Slytherin? You’d have fit right in.”
He’s opening his mouth to speak when you feel a bullet right past your cheek before it enters his skull, splashing blood on your face. Your hands let go of him and you duck for cover.
With the owls on their way, and their own orders safely stored, Draco goes to the counter, where Luna is already waiting.
Draco’s manager was against it; Blaise supported his best friend, but even he had doubts about the whole thing. It was too soon. Ron and Hermione were currently in the hospital, waiting for Ginny to wake up. Harry had no idea how to fill her in on what happened, how she would react when she heard the news. Her state remained critical, still in a medically induced coma.
Harry is about to exit the greenhouse when he adds, “Bring something to drink.”
“I hold you to that. That will be eleven Galleons.”
If your head wasn’t already pushed to the wall, you’d probably bang your head against it out of sheer frustration.
“I’m not." Potter looks a little angry, and a little sad. Then he does something completely unexpected. He squeezes himself into the small space between Draco and the windows, and laces his fingers with Draco’s again. He turns towards Draco, leaning forward until there’s barely an inch separating them. In a soft, tender voice, Potter speaks the words. The words that Draco had spent countless hours in his bed at night obsessing over, trying not to think about, because the idea that Potter might feel the same had seemed preposterous.
Till today, it was unclear how the man had managed to enter the private fundraiser. Draco had just returned to the stage two months prior, and he’d been planning on not only announcing but also on selling exclusive copies of his new album to raise money. The event, however, would now be remembered forever for a different reason.
“Said the wrong thing?” Draco suggests.
Pansy raises an eyebrow at him. “Dick spotting?”
So far, Ollivander has been the only wandmaker to sell Draco a wand, but his luck might be running out very soon.
,” Draco says, whispering his name on purpose.
“How about dessert?”
“Sunday,” Draco replies coolly.
“I didn’t see that,” Daphne says at almost the same time.
“Indeed, I’m the dick spotter.”
“Thanks for your help. I wouldn’t have managed without you,” Potter says.
Pansy presses one last kiss to Ginny’s lips before sitting upright again. “You practically asked for it.”
Maybe he should make an attempt and get it out of his system. It might end Draco’s current obsession… or… or it could spread like a virus in his body and ruin their newly found friendship. Anyhow, that’s not even an option. Despite what his reputation proclaims, Draco isn’t one for casual sex or one-night stands. Except for the night in the club.
“Oh, come on, Draco. I’m sorry, but they only had Hippogriffs and Nifflers left. And yours has wings.”
When Draco enters Harry’s bedroom, a room he’s only slept in so far, nothing else, the sight greeting him is not a bad one. Harry is standing there in his underwear and his dress shirt still mostly open.
“I’m so sorry, I—”
He cuddles into Harry’s chest. It’s soothing to hear his heart beat and feel his calloused hand running up and down his side.
He knocks on the door once, twice, and waits. No answer. Draco knocks harder. Still no answer. He lifts his leg, aims for the door, and—
It’s Harry.
“...making him look hot?” Pansy finishes. “Which brings us back to Draco’s story.”
For a moment, Draco sincerely believes that Harry has covered himself up. He lowers his hand, only to be confronted with Potter’s terry-cloth bathrobe hanging completely open, exposing Potter's front; his cock is already half-hard. The red-orange flames of the fire illuminate Potter's tanned skin; highlight the sharp angles of Potter's body—the lines of his chiseled jaw that softens into a teasing smile; the jaunty thrust of his hip. Potter looks exactly like sex on legs. He looks like everything that Draco had dreamed about, like everything that Draco had once wanted.
And if that won’t take the nighttime fantasies Draco has had since their crafty day to a whole new level…
Draco moans, a long, shuddering groan as he feels himself emptying into Harry, his hips still jerking. Harry wraps an arm around him, holds him through his orgasm. Draco presses their foreheads together, trying to catch his breath.
Draco pointedly ignores her and focuses on repairing the tissue layer by layer, slowly closing the gash. Suddenly, Ginny kicks him with her other leg on his upper arm.
Apparently kidnapping Draco has become Ginny's favourite pastime. Or how else can it be explained that he finds himself in their living room again? However, this time, he’s sitting in the armchair with a whiskey in hand, facing Ginny and Pansy on the couch.
The entire situation is bizarre. Draco tries to wrap his brain around what’s happened over the last forty-eight hours. He went from being a Healer in France to standing in Harry Potter’s flat, getting dressed for their dinner tonight. From an outsider’s point of view, this would probably sound very much like he’s going on a date with Harry.
A virtually impossible more as he’ll be leaving tomorrow.
The weight of him, the minutes he lies on top of you, it all collates into the most intimate act of the night. How the two of you take your breaths in complementing synchronicity.
As if he has all the time in the world, Harry pushes Draco’s shirt up, mapping the newly revealed skin with delicate touches. Every past encounter pales against what Draco is experiencing now. Each touch — of tongue, of lips, of hands — unravels him, exposing him to Harry. The notion of time and space are completely lost on Draco, who switches between swearing and moaning.
Surprisingly, the rest of the day passes without incident. They manage to keep their wands in their pockets, and none of Draco’s neighbours need to be Obliviated. While Draco cleans up the last remnants of the party preparations, Potter picks up the two bags filled with the things they’ve prepared. He’s wearing the sash that reads “Weasley is our Queen” on the front and “A Beauty that needs to be seen” on the back, and the crown sits proudly on his head. The two inflatable dolls are tucked under his arms.
He finishes running through the list of new Unspeakable spells, all of which light up the door in a variety of different colours as they sink into the wood. He tries the handle again, jiggling it impatiently, but the door stays firmly shut and, very annoyingly, remains impervious to both the spells and Draco’s glare. He taps a finger against his chin as he thinks.
or an
Something inside of Draco is doing flips. His entire body feels like it’s burning. He tries his best to not freak out, but remain calm and neutral.
“If that’s the case, then yes.” Draco has to admit that Ginny, as well as Ron, are excellent cooks. Probably all Weasley siblings have exceptional culinary skills. He’s once heard Wood rave about Percy’s food while high on pain potions. Wood might also have mentioned a frilly apron with red roses, but Draco kept that part to himself. Healer-patient confidentiality and all.
There’s the sound of Potter’s bare feet against the wooden floor, then a hand gently touches his. Potter turns Draco’s wrist upwards, and then places the book in it. Draco relaxes once he feels the familiar leather in his hand.
“That woman is insane. She asked me yesterday if we can dip the carnations in Amortentia and decorate the church with them. Also, who wants yellow carnations at their wedding?”
“What the… Potter—!” Draco yelps, and Potter looks up from the book open in front of him and raises an eyebrow at Draco.
Potter’s smile widens into a grin, and Draco scowls at him, although he can’t help but luxuriate in the feeling of Potter’s hand in his. For a moment, he allows himself to pretend that they’re more than—than whatever they are. Here, in the narrow corridor of the secret passageway, Draco allows himself this brief reprieve from reality.
Behind them, the mimosas burst with colour, but nobody notices.
Potter’s eyes are suddenly wide, his gaze fixed on Draco’s face. Draco simply shoves Potter behind him once he’s done. He glances back over his shoulder, his eyes dark as he stands in the same position that Potter had stood just mere seconds ago. “Just exactly how barbaric do you think my ancestors were, Potter? A
jogger bottoms which hang unbelievably low on his hips.
“I just…” With his free hand, Harry ruffles his hair again. “I just wanted to tell you that, while I don’t usually do things like that, I’m not sorry it happened. And I know you’re leaving, and that we barely know each other, but we only live one Portkey apart and I was wondering if, perhaps, you’d like to have dinner with me on the fifteenth? I’ll be too busy on Valentine’s day.”
Draco throws a deadly glare at Ginny and Pansy, respectively, as he pockets the Muggle thirst trap device. If Potter continues with sending him pictures in similar fashion, Draco will probably bend him over the counter, customers and Mr Ollivander be damned.
Deadly, but fucking hot. Being at his mercy never fails to do its job. You’re hyper-aware of his breath tickling the hair on the side of your head and the weight of Malfoy’s body driving you harder into the stone wall. You feel his magic wash over you when he gets rid of the blood on your face.
It’s also possible that Draco just likes the way Harry solely focuses on him when he speaks. Maybe he likes it a tad more than he should.
“Adventures, you say? Now I’m intrigued.”
Potter begins to move, shifting his weight as he pushes himself to sit upright, his legs folded gracefully underneath him. His bathrobe conveniently falls open as he does, displaying his  body up to the navel, though most of it is, thankfully, still hidden in the shadows from the folds of the robe.
They watch Pansy drink it all in one go, both knowing better than to ask the obvious, ‘
“Potter, I’ve literally had my cock up your arse in a loo before. Anyway, clean up the mess you made. I’m not going back out like this,” Draco huffs with a goofy smile on his face.
The box Potter produces is enormous. Draco has never seen such a long wand — at least seventeen inches.
did an amazing job once again. Being my beta, my shoulder to cry, and my personal confidence booster. Thank you so much. <3
“Harry just came by and told me to give you this,” she says by way of greeting, handing him a steaming mug of heaven-sent coffee. “He also warned me, because Amanda Keane owled him again.”
“Draco, I’m close. Ahh… I ne-need you.”
Draco puts the photo in question on the coffee table.
“Yes,” Draco laughs. “Oh.”
“It must be my superpower,” Draco cackles.
“If you’d hold still, I wouldn’t end up poking around,” Draco admonishes.
Neville groans. “Not you too.”
produces no results. Nor does a
“Non, c’est trop tôt.” Draco looks up, seeing the confusion on Neville’s face, and then it clicks. He’s been speaking French. “Sorry. When does your Portkey leave?”
Draco nudges Pansy. “I think your wife’s had enough.”
Harry presses open-mouthed kisses over every inch of skin he can reach. Draco bites back his own moans and puts more effort into getting Harry off.
London had been deafeningly loud and too smelly. Every single person had been surrounded by a cloud of scents — some pleasant, some not — and with other city odours, they built a wall of smells that had hit you with full speed.
Reaching the destination, you force him to put his hands on either side of his head and spread his legs. One after the other, knives of different sizes and shapes are revealed, and then you vanish them.
With careful movements, you unfold the spit wet piece of parchment. There are numbers, coordinates. You have a feeling about what you’ll find there. And at the bottom of the note, there’s a message, written in his unmistakable, neat curl.
“Draco,” Harry whispers softly into the dark of the bedroom.
, Potter?”
“You haven’t complained so far. But seriously now, Draco, I’m really happy for you. And it has taken you two long enough to get your act together.”
Draco can feel himself blushing as he tells all of this, but Ginny and Pansy are amazing. His story is interrupted by Ginny sharing funny anecdotes and Pansy making jokes at his expense. Mostly, though, he’s gushing about how awesome Potter is.
This seems to kick-start his brain because vivid snippets of last night flash before his eyes. Him knocking on Harry’s door. Harry opening it, wearing nothing but joggers. Harry seeing him completely naked, and…
The moment Finnigan gets up and clears his throat, Draco really wishes Harry had brought the Invisibility Cloak.
“What did you come here to say? And please don’t make me beg.”
And then there are things that you
Sex, in the past, has always been quick, an efficient way to reach orgasm and then part ways. That's been enough for Draco, whose schedule has always been filled to the brim. None of the blokes ever knew anything about Draco’s life, sometimes not even his name.
"Wai— Oh fuck. Wait, Draco," Harry pants. Of course, Draco stops. Harry pulls Draco’s hand out of his joggers before gently beckoning Draco to turn to lie on his back. “Let me,” he whispers, his lips hovering close to Draco’s but not kissing.
You fucking hate him.
"I think we should go to bed," Harry announces with a slight lull.
Standing in the middle of Harry’s flat is definitely weird. And Draco is literally in the middle. Right in front of him is Harry’s kitchen with a dining table, to his right are two comfy armchairs flanking a small coffee table, and behind them, the foot end of his bed is visible.
Potter ignores Draco’s remark. “What happened this time? Pixie attack? Or did another potion burn the wood to ashes?” Potter looks like a dog who’s excited about going outside.
Deep down, you’re aware that you’d never stand a chance against Malfoy, but every remaining fragment of self-preservation was gently blown off you when he whispered these words into your ear. All past promises to yourself that this was the last time have left with it.
Out of habit, Draco kept quiet, hiding the fact that his breath was quickening.
“Vas-t-en,” Draco grumbles. “Je dors.”
“The house?” Surprise is written all over Potter’s face as he stares wonderingly between Draco and the enchanted door.
Conversi and clerics lived separately, and novices, in particular, were not supposed to mix with them. So, Draco had never spoken to him. Harry, as he’d heard one lay brother shout once, seemed to be about Draco’s own age. That was the extent of his knowledge about Harry. His name, it was all Draco had. To preserve his own sanity, he’d never vocalised it. His imagination, though, had provided enough scenarios in which Draco had said it. Most of them involved—
Draco pushes Harry’s knees up to his chest, opening him up wide, and fucks him hard. His balls slap against Harry’s arse with every thrust, and he’s hitting Harry’s prostate with every wet slide of his cock in. Harry arches his back; the entire library fills with his moans. He looks better than Draco could have ever imagined in his wildest dreams. Harry’s eyes are closed, his forehead damp with sweat. Stray strands of hair are clinging to his forehead, to his neck; his mouth open wide in a groan. He chokes out Draco’s name and Draco, shuddering when he hears it, picks up the pace.
Potter looks down, taking in Draco’s flushed face. He brings both his hands to Draco’s face again, cupping it tenderly, and leans in. Draco thinks he’s leaning in for another kiss, but Potter just kisses the corner of Draco’s mouth instead, making him smile. Potter begins dropping little kisses all over Draco’s face—along his cheekbones and up to the corner of his eye. Draco lets out a little sigh of contentment, closes his eyes, and allows himself to enjoy it. This is a side of Potter that he rarely got to see during the last year; they never took the time to really explore each other.
The moment he kneels on the floor and puts his hands behind his head, you take a step forward and know this will be a quick job. Your eyes stay trained on his arms because they’re in the perfect position to reach for a weapon strapped to his back. You, yourself, have used this trick before, and the scar on your left cheek serves as a reminder of the other time when you barely made it out alive.
“This occasion isn’t a joyful one. No, we’ve all come together to mourn. The loss of an incredible human being that many of you knew as a talented singer-songwriter, a skilled guitarist, or a big fashion icon. But to me, Pansy was more than that. I’ve known her all my life. She had been there for me when I almost killed myself with drugs and alcohol. She supported me through my parents’ divorce and stood by me when I needed to step away from music. All my life, she’s been my shoulder to cry on, my rock.” Draco took a deep breath before continuing. On the other side of the stage, Harry’s heart was breaking for his boyfriend. “I love you, Pansy, and I’ll miss you so much.”
He looked and looked, but there was not a single thing he could wear. The suits and dress robes were too valuable to wear around their house. They wanted to be seen, not gotten dirty while cooking spaghetti.
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” he says as he enters the house, his voice echoing into the depths of the house, “now this is just ridiculous. No house wards, no locks, and he didn’t set up the traps like I told him to? At the rate he’s going, he almost deserves to get clobbered to death by some crazy fan, that stupid arse.”
The path ahead would be difficult, but together they’d get through this.
“Draco!” someone shouts, entering the greenhouse.
Draco doesn’t hate children, but he prefers to have them as fully formed students at school, or like Teddy before he started Hogwarts: for an afternoon, before returning them to their parents or guardians.
Five minutes later, he is still waiting for someone to answer the door. His feet take turns tapping on the stone step, mostly to check that his toes haven’t frozen off yet. Not even his best heating charms are helping him at the moment.
“Tell me, Malfoy, where did you learn those spells?” Potter says slowly, looking straight at Draco. His green eyes glow like a cat’s in the dark, pinning him into place.
“Oops,” she burps loudly.
Potter points over Draco’s shoulder at the small table next to the armchair, right in front of the rug that he had been lying on. There’s a bowl of chocolate-covered strawberries that Draco’s pretty sure wasn’t there when he had first entered the library.
Draco bit his lower lip. For as long as he’d been here, it’d never felt so real. It was as if someone was actually touching him. This was only a dream though. Dreams are not real.
“Leave the sappy eyes for later,” Draco hears Longbottom joke.
They nod in unison.
In one swift movement, Harry cups Draco’s face in his hands and kisses him. A kiss full of hope and promise. They continue kissing for Merlin knows how long, and when they break apart, Harry looks past Draco’s head.
Suddenly, his bed shifted. Before fear could grip his body, soft lips were covering his own. Draco opened his mouth willingly, allowing a tongue inside his mouth. He tasted sweet wine and something slightly salty.
Once all traces have gone down the drain, Draco opens the curtain and reaches for a towel. To his surprise, it’s fluffier than it looks. And it smells good, too. He brings a bit of the soft fabric to his nose, inhaling deeply. The scent is interestingly sweet and crisp; oddly calming. Once he realises what he’s doing, though, he quickly starts drying himself off.
“I can’t believe that the machinery is still good, even after all these years,” Draco says, giving the bookcase a fond stroke. The house seems to appreciate the compliment—the unlit torches set in the scones burst into flame the moment they take a step forward into the passageway, one after the other in rapid succession. The air doesn’t smell as musty as it should be, despite the passageway being shut up for years, although a chill settles over them as they walk down a slope that heads towards the back of the house.
“You know magic exists, right?”
It’s time to select the photos for the annual charity calendar.
“Spit it out. Some people
“It’s not like it was my mistake that started it.”
The mere sound of his voice causes the hairs on your body to stand up. So familiar. Before you’re doing something idiotic, you’ll decide to move this somewhere else, to one of your houses, your turf. You twist one hand behind his body, holster your gun and reach for your wand.
With half-a-bottle’s worth of alcohol rushing through his bloodstream, Draco’s tongue loosened and he told Harry everything. Literally everything. From his gay epiphany at twelve to his father’s insistence on him finding a wife and making cute, blond babies.
“Can you let me finish for once? Godric, do you have to be an insufferable arse all the time? You know as well as I do that you’re not innocent here. Remember what
Potter makes a small, pleased sound, and Draco opens his eyes to see Potter smirking up at him. His gaze is intense, and Potter runs his tongue slowly across his lips until they glisten with saliva. Draco bites his lower lip almost unwillingly at the sight. Apparently, that’s exactly what Potter wanted to see—him, almost completely gone—because Potter, finally, moves in.
“I really have to focus here if you’re determined on playing in three days.”
“Oh yes, Potter. Telling two gossiping Sixth Years that the Saviour actually likes it when I fuck him hard into the mattress is exactly what I did.” Draco’s voice is dripping with sarcasm.
"Thanks," Draco says, his eyes fixed on the plants, "for both the boiler and the tea." Harry remains where he is, as if he's waiting for Draco to say more. Draco can't, so he casts another Patronus, hoping Harry gets the hint. It's weaker than the ones before.
“What?”
Draco can feel himself blushing, two guilty spots of colour rising on his cheeks. It’s almost unbearably hot with the fire heating up the room and him still wearing his heavy cloak. Taking it off, however, would send the wrong signal; would give Potter entirely the wrong idea about why he’s here.
Nevertheless, he drags himself out of bed into the bathroom and then into Neville’s kitchen, only to put his arms on the table, resting his head on top of them.
The second their eyes meet, Draco realises that holy fucking Merlin’s saggy balls, he’s in
“If you value your life, nobody will ever hear about this.”
“Tell me,” you say more forcefully this time.
Draco’s heart does a somersault at hearing these words and his face splits into a wide grin. “Yes, Harry.”
He walks over to Potter and places a hand on Potter’s arm to tug him along. Despite the chill, Potter’s skin is warm. Potter gives him a tentative smile, which Draco does not return. He  turns away instead, and lets his hand fall away from Potter’s arm. They begin the trek back in silence, Draco leading the way again.
He can’t get out of a sodding room, much less the house. They’ve tried almost everything, and their every attempt has been pointless. He eyes the door balefully, then tells Potter, “step back and take cover.”
“You’re amazing,” he says in between pants, then pushes himself up. He slides out of Harry with a soft wet sound, and watches as his seed trickles out of Harry.
And Harry wouldn’t let anyone tear him away from Draco. No matter what people might offer him, Harry would always choose Draco over all the money, wealth, or fame. Nobody in his entire life had ever understood him the way Draco did.
At least he can enjoy the confusion of his father as to why the food remains unsealed. Draco has seen his father watching him like a hawk, so Lucius knows that Draco has at least acknowledged all the guests — that is, the guests that Lucius invited.
He’d just sat down on the sofa with a piece of brownie on a plate when Harry came home from his weekend shift.
When they make their way back, the entire table stares at them. Pansy has the smuggest of expressions on her face, while Thomas and Ginny clink two more shot glasses together, and Ginny’s brother looks like he wants to apparate away.
Harry moans again at the loss, and flops back onto the rug, throwing one arm across his face in frustration.
“Your mouth… so amazing… Need more,” Draco says breathlessly, his voice slightly raspy.
At high notes, Draco’s voice began to quiver. Instantly, Harry knew that this was it for tonight. A lump was forming in his boyfriend’s throat, clogging it up.
?” Draco mouths. “Did Neville really name his shop
Pansy’s heels echo across the room, dragging Draco out of his haze.
Draco rolls his eyes, but he wants to get out of the room as much as Potter does. He walks over to the bookcase. The rim of each shelf is lined in rich gold, and in the flickering firelight it looks like the shelves are luminous. Which, Draco supposes, is the entire point of it.
“And why did you come back here, Draco?” Draco’s eyes snap back to Harry’s. He hadn’t even realised he was looking elsewhere. “Neville told me you grew up in England?"
“Can we talk?”
“No… Harry’s just… thanking me for Sunday.”
The last button undone, Draco shrugs his shirt off and lets it dangle off one fingertip before it joins his grey waistcoat on the ground. Harry watches him the entire time, head craned over his shoulder, his body quivering in anticipation. Once he’s fully naked, Draco kneels down beside Harry, and runs one hand down his back in long, tender strokes. The other hand turns Harry’s face to his, and he leans forward. His lips fasten around the lobe of Harry’s ear, and he sucks lightly, earning him a gasp from Harry. Draco pulls back, and in one swift motion, he flips Harry over and topples him onto his back on the rug.
Harry arches off the rug in a long moan and pants hard when Draco finally brushes his fingers over that sweet spot. His voice is hoarse, his legs trembling as they dangle over Draco’s shoulders.
“He’s such a himbo, I can’t take it,” Pansy groans in total frustration.
“—Not hear about that,” Pansy abruptly chimes in.
Thank you,
Draco takes a flute from the table, downs it, and reaches for another. By the time Potter arrives —
of all places. Draco might admire artworks and jewellery in different body areas, but he’s never been fond of anything spiky. Some would say he’s squeamish about needles.
“Yeah… Anyway, I have really no idea why the house locked us in.”
You sigh, disappointed at the very predictable plea to not hurt. It’s natural, and you’d gladly cause less harm, but from years of experience, you can safely say that pain is the only real motivator for truth. There’s still the slightest bit of hope that he’ll put up a fight. He might be one of those people who reach their breaking point fairly late.
“She doesn’t hate you.” Draco replied. “If she hated you, she would have started dinner by whipping her dinner knife at your forehead.”
“Yes, Harry?”
Pansy clucked her tongue. “Ouch…”
“And that’s why I can barely remember anything.” Harry laughed hysterically. “I got roofied!”
“You’re not going into the office, darling?” Harry said snidely.
Draco let out a shuddering breath and buried his face into Harry’s neck. “I really thought it was you.”
Harry slumped down on the carpet. “Who would do such a thing? And so boldly.”
He rolled his eyes. “Harry, are you alright?”
“She saw your bruise this morning… Granger may have jumped to conclusions, but she’s not stupid. I’ve seen a photo of Praetor, we’re not dissimilar looking men with the similar ugly backgrounds. She saw the bruise, she made her assumptions based on past situations. Harry, if he—”
Harry looked confused. “What’s Thursday?”
“I do?”
“Good. That’s very good. I mean, it’ll keep the rags away while we figure this out.” Draco sighed. “Though, I was thinking about family tapestries while you were in there.” Harry looked up at him. “When you’re born, your name is magically stitched in next to your parents. It works the same way when you get married, barring if you hadn’t been blasted from the tapestry.”
.” Draco cooed in Harry’s ear. “My little husband misses me.”
Ron stopped pacing and Linley quirked a brow. “You use Dark Magic to send notes to your husband?”
“I suppose you’re wondering why they aren’t still together.” Pansy interjected.
Harry quivered. “Oh r-really?”
“Your dear husband asked me to come and check on you.” She pulled a black square from her handbag. “Look at the fancy black square, please.”
“No, I’ll be fine.” Harry replied hoarsely. “An extremely long hot shower usually does the trick.”
“Yes, she did. You thought I—you were bordering on hysteria. She thought it was best to calm you down.”
“She’s not wrong, Draco.” Harry sighed. “I wasn’t raised in this type of environment. I never learned the importance of canapés.”
Draco rolled his eyes and Harry frowned. “I think what Draco does is very noble.”
His eyes were red and his face was streaked with tears. He strode purposefully across the room and pulled Harry into a tight hug. He buried his face into Harry’s still wet hair, his breath ragged.
Linley glanced sideways at Ron. “Was it normal for the Wizengamot Administration Offices to be that empty during that time of day?”
“No, but it was your’s the carried the most weight, Order of Merlin-First Class.” He tucked a dad lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “I’m forever grateful, you know. I get to be the man I am today because of you. I got to be absolutely wrecked in a pub and stumble into marriage with you. A surprisingly wonderful marriage to a very handsome wizard.”
The blonde laughed. “Oh, come now,
“Yes, I’m sorry.” Harry took Draco’s face in his hands. “What is the matter?”
“You’ve got to get up.” Draco whispered, pulling away.
“Promise?”
Harry rolled his eyes and stalked out of the room. “I’ll leave you to your work,
“How did she—”
.nine.
“Merlin knows I’ve done it before.”
"I don't think it would be a good idea."
“Y-you used my shampoo.” He croaked.
The dark-hair wizard buried his face into Draco’s chest. “That Gala is literally my nightmare.”
amount of Veritaserum, because who doesn’t want to tell the truth when you’re calm and happy. You could ask me anything right now. I’d tell you the truth.”
“You really outdid yourself, Potter.” Draco said, scooping lo mien onto his plate. “All of my favorites are here. How did you even know?”
idea.” Harry smiled, congratulating himself.
She smiled brightly. “Oh Mister Potter, they would absolutely enjoy it.”
it triggered something in my memory. The night we got married,” Harry murmured. “the bartender brought me a Cinnamon Cal. I’d’ve never heard of it but it tasted delicious. I asked who it was from and he said an admirer who wanted to remain anonymous. Then five minutes later, you sit down next to me.”
The brunette frowned. “I’m not upset.”
“Look, you’re making the face right now.” Draco chuckled.
Narcissa laid down her silverware. “Now, what I believe happened is that you, Mister Potter, were inebriated in a pub. You happened to run into my darling son, who was also inebriated in said pub. He has a thing for brunettes, you see.” Draco slumped in his chair. “Then you two, after getting intoxicated further, run off into the night together. Unlike two drunk young people who run off and have a one-night stand; you get married, consummate the union, thus making it permanent.”
"You wanted to know what I wanted for you Christmas and I told you." Draco huffed. "You're such a prude, Harry."
A small blush crept across Draco's pale cheeks. "While I appreciate your opinion, Marc, I can finish my own work. On time. Good day, Marc."
Harry blushed all the way to his ears and Draco snorted into his drink. “Blaise, I believe there are
“Close your eyes and think.” Draco whispered. “
Draco could feel his orgasm impending, tight hot coil in the pit of his stomach threatening to release. Harry soon came undone beneath, arching off the bed, hands clawing up Draco’s back. The feeling of Harry’s hands on his back did him in. Draco came, burying himself as deep as he could inside the brunette. Spent and exhausted, they fell into a deep sleep.
“A womb, for one.” Lord Malfoy grabbed the file folder and began going through it again. “But you two seem determined. I assume that two weeks is enough time to plan your announcement party.”
“You could go mad.” Draco replied.
Draco growled, stalking towards the front door. He wrenched it open. “Yes?” He answered curtly.
“You might be to good for me.” Draco called from down the hallway.
“I’m off, I’ll owl if I’ll be late.”
“You made me lunch?”
Harry snorted. “It worked a little too well.”
Harry nodded. “I think I’ve had too much champagne.”
“For breakfast?” Harry slumped slightly in the chair. “That was just a thank you for helping me yesterday...”
.” Harry stood, rounding on Draco. “We’ve been in a secret relationship for the last few years. Off and on, to explain your philandering—”
Marc slinked into the room. "To be frank," He picked up the framed photo on Draco's desk. "if I had this waiting at home for me, I don't think I'd still be here. To be even more frank, I'd've left most of my work for when I got back from holiday."
“Explain.” Narcissa said sharply, neatly spearing a piece of chicken with her fork.
Harry stood in front of the large mirror in Draco’s bedroom. “I feel ridiculous.”
“I am not living here.” Harry snapped, crossing his arms over his chest.
“This puts a rather large hiccup in things.” He muttered.
“What time did you head back to your office on Level Two?”
“I know, you’re worse than Molly sometimes.”
He smiled in return, handing his messenger bag to Imogen, then making his way over to the book shelf as another one of the nursery employees gathered the children in the center of the room.
“Alright, take your picture.”
Draco kissed him deeply before pulling away to dig in his bedside table. Pulling out a honey-colored jar, he popped the lid off and dipped his fingers into it. Harry watched with anticipation, rolling his hips forward. Draco smiled, hovering over Harry as he eased a finger into the tight heat. Harry moaned, arching slightly off the bed, clawing his hands into the sheets. The blonde leaned down, peppering kisses along Harry’s collarbone, his neck. He added a second and a third, twisting and stretching, leaving Harry gasping, begging for the blonde to be inside him. Draco obliged and buried himself to the hilt, causing Harry to cry out.
Draco nodded and thrust forward, enveloping himself in Harry’s tight heat. Harry moaned loudly, arching even farther if possible. He pulled out and slowly slid home again.
“Good morning to you too.” Harry replied, shutting the door.
Harry hopped up from the sofa, tugging down his t-shirt. “It’s a pleasure to meet you both.”
Draco snorted as he rinsed his dish. “Why do you think I have a flat in Muggle London?”
“It’s nothing special, just Chinese takeaway.” He plopped down in the seat opposite Draco’s desk. “And, well… I just haven’t seen you in a while.”
“That sounds like a fabulous idea.” Draco walked into the ensuite. “When you were last in?”
“I got sidetracked at the Ministry.” Harry replied.
“I know you’re here, it just isn’t who I am.” He fidgeted with the loose tie of Harry’s sweatpants. “Not how I was brought up.”
“Really?” Harry whined.
Draco thought sourly. He retracted the sour thought immediately. As his significant other was any indication, he was definitely a sucker for all the same things. The warm feeling settled in his stomach again and he touched a hand to the breast pocket of his suit. It was really a silly thing for him to keep such a note. It was the shortest correspondence he'd had between Harry and himself. He pulled the note from its keeping place and read it again.
Draco rolled on top of Harry. "Are you ready?"
Harry dragged his hands across his chest. “Hot… And tight…”
Draco leaned against the island, cup of tea in hand, as he watched Harry flit about the kitchen cooking breakfast. The letter from Devon Cristler open, the strong slant of his hand had gently suggested that he enjoy the next four weeks of paid holiday time while they relocated his office. He sighed, re-reading the letter. He knew Cristler was right to keep him away from the department while the Department
Draco hovered over his husband. “To be honest, your angry face is one of your more adorable faces.”
Draco fingered the wreath on Harry’s head. “Because you are my bride.”
“That’s not why I called you, Pans.”
“Franco,” Draco folded his hands in his lap. “Is it possible for us to keep this simple and light? For my husband’s sake, please?”
“Well, I’m glad you did.” Lysander smiled, running a hand down Harry’s arm. “I think you’ll be a good influence on my nephew.”
“You were dosed with a Lust Potion.”
Furey tipped his head. “We knew your father when he was in the Auror Corps. He was a good man.”
“Lead the way, darling.”
Ron's eyebrows shot up into his hairline. "Leave him?"
“So?”
“Good day, Pansy.” He hung up the phone.
“Pansy, love, what are you doing here?”
"You should go home." Draco looked up to find his co-worker, Marc Pemberlly, leaning against the door-frame to his office. "Seriously, go. I can finish for you."
, they will see the strong Destroyer of the Dark Lord as a sweet-faced bride of a former Death Eater’s son.” He exposed a tan strip of Harry’s stomach. “It’s honestly a little bit of a turn on.”
Harry moaned, wrapping his arms around Draco's neck. Draco murmured something and Harry felt a cool liquid filling him. He looked wide-eyed at Draco, who whispered that it was just a preparation spell. The blonde nuzzled Harry's neck and he pressed a finger into the warm tightness. Harry hissed at the intrusion, clenching tightly around Draco's finger. Draco whispered words of comfort, kissing Harry's face and neck. Thr brunette relaxed and he began to fuck him with his finger. Then applied a second, stretching him. It wasn't long before Harry was rocking in time with Draco's thrusts. Moaning erotically, begging for more.
“He has the general Malfoy features, yes.” Lysander sipped his drink, eyes straying over to where Draco stood with Sirius and Remus. “You ever notice how much he and Sirius look alike?”
“Really?” Harry sat up, looking genuinely impressed.
She chuckled. “I suppose you’re right, but Harry walked out on Mister Money Banks.” Pansy affirmed. “Apparently, all signs pointed toward engagement until one day, the pretty little Savior packs his belongings and moves into a cozy little cottage in Milton Keynes.”
“You’re welcome.” Draco replied. “Go get your suit coat, we have to go.”
“Ready?”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Then sincerely disliked…” She watched as Harry reached up, noticing the large bruise on his hip. “Harry… That bruise…”
“We’ve been together for some time now.” Harry replied, spearing a broccoli floret. “Did you ever think perhaps I know you that well?”
Draco smirked. “You are aware that you are not really my wife.”
Lydia nodded solemnly. “So you’ve spent the last two years working only in the afternoon and on weekends because you wanted to.”
love you.”
Draco sat back in his chair. “Then we have scallops and figs.”
Harry frowned. “I am trying, you know.”
.thirteen.
Harry cleared his throat. “I’m fine… I’m just… I think I’m hungover.”
Draco sighed. “Unfortunately. One of the pitfalls to being promoted to the Deputy Head Solicitor is that I must be present during the Ministry Equinox Gala.”
“What kind of large hiccup in things?’
“If you keep this up, we’ll never make it to the bed.” Draco said, voice thick with lust.
Ron backpedaled immediately. "Well, of course she is. Mum just says when their born, they tend to be healthier. Rose was a bit on the small side when she was born."
“If you want to call constantly followed by the press ‘normalcy’.”
Draco knocked lightly on his door. “Potter?”
“The financial reports are missing.” Harry replied flipping through the files once again. “Expenditures, spending approvals, grant submissions; they’re all missing. They’ve been missing for a while now.”
Draco sniggered as Harry rolled his eyes. “Why does everyone think I’m the ‘bottom’ of this relationship?”
“You think so?”
“Apparently…” Draco walked Ron and Quentin back to the front door. “You’ll let me know if you uncover anything.”
“Then with the money we’re saving simplifying the menu, you can put towards the decorations. Alcohol even.” Draco smiled, rising from his seat. “Mother, I trust you can put together the perfect simple menu?”
“I’m doing a bit of research about my parents and I wanted to know if it was possible if I could take a look at their marriage certificate.” Harry leaned over the desk. “I don’t know much about them and it would really mean a lot to me if I knew when and where they got married.”
That was Harry's undoing. He screamed, arching up off the bed, spilling his seed all over his belly. Draco followed suit, burying himself to the hilt. Harry clenched around him, milking every single drop that Draco had to give. He collasped on top of the smaller wizard. Placing butterfly kisses all over Harry's face, he pulled him into a strong embrace.
goes off.
’ to have this horrible scar running down his face. Where the Dark Lord had marked him. Then I met you, this small little mop head with a neat little lightning bolt in the center of his forehead. You weren’t ugly, you were the exact opposite. You looked like a little doll, with your round glasses and too bright green eyes. You were… You were almost too pretty to be a boy.”
Harry shrugged. “Why not? Could be fun.” He rose from the table and disappeared into the smaller bedroom. “What do I wear?”
“Have you ever heard of a Cinnamon Cal?”
“And have you?”
disliked then.”
Angry pink lines decorated the smooth alabaster of Draco’s skin. “Severus patched me up but I also had to go before Lord Voldemort after I returned home from school. He was furious I had failed my task. He tied me to a table and re-opened them. Not enough to kill me, just enough to be painful. To scar. I laid there, tied to that table, for a week.”
“Hermione was raised by Muggles, look how well she’s assimilated.”
Harry frowned. “Hermione, please, I’m in no mood to argue with you this morn—”
“Yes, I’m fine.” Harry said sharply. “Just too much champagne and not enough food.”
Draco shook his head. “No, today’s rather light. I should be home at a decent hour.”
“Let’s give it a year.” Draco suggested. “Have a spectacular break up that gets splashed all over the tabloids.”
“I know, I try to be the charming gentleman most of the time.” He smiled, hands tugging Harry’s waist close. “But I’m ridiculously horny and I’m going to do some very adult things to you that I’ve been dying to do all day.”
“You really know how to frame a photo.” Draco whispered.
Ron smiled sadly, but nodded, pulling the door to the flat shut behind himself. Draco pressed his hand to the door, sealing the wards.
“Then where?”
“You want impossible information.” Pansy snorted.
“Glad to know I’m more than just a pretty face to you.”
“More than enough, considering my minuscule wardrobe for a wealthy wizard.” Harry slipped the card into his cloak pocket.
Harry lead the group into the living room, plopping down on the sofa, tugging Draco down next to him. Quentin sat in the chair opposite the sofa while Ron paced in front of the large fireplace. Quentin pulled a small speaker box and notepad from his pocket. He set the box on the end table and flipped open the notepad, pulling a ballpoint pen he had tucked in the spiral.
“Draco…”
Draco pulled the smaller wizard close. "Can't help it. How do you feel?"
“Thank you.” Harry ran the towel over Draco’s chest. “Our Sixth Year…”
“Yes, in the most delicious way.” Draco grabbed two flutes of champagne off a floating tray. “Uncle Lysander, so glad you could make it. I’m sure that you know my husband.”
“Four to forty-eight hours, depending on the strength of the dose.”
Quentin jotted another note. “Do you always owl your husband when you’re going to be late?”
“Shhhh…” Harry wordlessly summoned a washcloth. “We’re not going to talk about right now. We’re going to talk about happier things.”
“Of course.”
“The Great and Powerful Harry Potter.” Lysander replied, shaking Harry’s hand. “Your photos really do you no justice. I can see why my nephew fell for you.”
, pushing her way into the flat. “Just what were you thinking?”
“But you have agree that it’s a bit odd that they’re together.” Ron said. “I mean the last time that they were in a room together was graduation.”
“No.” Draco breathed. “One my father taught me as a child.”
“It’s fin—”
"I love you. I love you, Harry James Potter." Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's small frame. "I love you more than I love my own goddamn magic."
“I’ll expect your owl than…”
“Pans, I really don’t think it’s a good idea.”
Draco and Harry spent the next two hours, pacing bout Draco’s enormous, perfectly decorated flat, trying to concoct a plausible story to tell Draco’s grandfather but were failing miserably. Harry had taken off his suit coat and toed off his shoes, lying back on the ridiculously expensive sofa. Draco was currently wearing a hole into the expensive carpet of his sitting room floor.
“I just… it’s a very big place.” Harry’s blush deepened. “I don’t like being alone in big spaces.”
“Whatever Praetor did or didn’t do, you know… You know you can tell me.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “I am not a nelly bottom.”
Draco grabbed his tie from the floor. “That is incredibly presumptuous, don’t you think?”
“Impressive and incredibly unexpected.” Narcissa snapped at the two of them. “Come on you two, he will not be kept waiting.”
Harry frowned, sitting up. “Hermione doesn’t.”
Draco nodded. “I would very much like to make love to you.”
“Thank you, I do too.” Harry stood, gathering the files into his messenger bag. “I’ll be in on Friday.”
Draco dropped his head onto Harry’s shoulder. “I know…”
Draco stared dumbly at his husband. “You had those in your closet?”
“Wonderful.” Draco pressed a kiss to his mother’s cheek. “We’ll see you on Friday, Mother.”
"He's terrified that if we do sleep together, that I'll leave him." Draco stared out the window. "Leave him and tell the world about it."
" Harry said loudly. "What about you, Draco, what do you want?"
Harry kissed Draco and they melted into one another. Draco ran his thumbs along Harry's jawline, causing the dark-haired man to moan. Grinning at the reaction, he spun them around, dragging Harry towards the staircase. They kissed, licked, and dragged hands over each others bodies. Draco's fingers worked frantically to undo the bow at the small of Harry's back. The banged against the wall before falling through their bedroom door.
“She’s not wrong…” Harry whispered. “Are you sure she’s not using Legimency?
Harry sighed, quickly finishing scrubbing last night’s bar-grime off his body and exited the shower.
“It’s just so terrible that you’re such a good person.”
“I’m alright.” He swayed more noticeably this time. “No, really… I’m fine.”
“I would like you to stay.” He curled his hand around Harry’s. “But I will understand if you don’t want to hear any of this.”
“He’s only here in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you would like to continue to avoid him.”
“Malfoy!” Cristler barked.
“Yes, most the Administration staff isn’t needed after five.”
“Firstly, you should address me by my proper title. I used yours, I should hope you’d give me the same courtesy and use mine.” Harry smiled. “I will agree that Greengrasses are a good, well-connected family but so are the Potters. Would you rather align your family with one who had sympathized with the Dark Lord’s ravings or one that had fought valiantly against them? You know full well that I am not in it for the money. I have my own being the heir to the Potter legacy as well as the named heir of the Black estate. A small piece of which you would have received when your son married Narcissa. Wouldn’t it be nice to have the whole pie?”
“He’s new.” He rubbed his hand across his forehead. “I would categorize it as a little sloppy but he’s a quick study. Polite, quiet and efficient when he knows what he’s doing. Your typical clerk.”
“I can’t help that you exude the presence of a nelly bottom.”
“Oh, you went for the double-barreled option. How very posh of you.”
Draco stared at the canopy over the bed. “Hate is a very strong word for what I felt.”
“I don’t have a type.” Harry scoffed.
Quentin nodded. “Lead the way.”
Harry walked backward towards the bed, pulling the t-shirt over his head. Draco followed, lifting the dark-haired wizard and tossing him onto it. Harry barely shimmied out of his boxers by the time Draco was on him. He kissed and licked every inch of skin he could see. This was his Harry. This Harry with freckles on his nose, wild dark hair, and emerald-bright eyes. This Harry that snorted when he laughed, that hummed Elton John when he cooked, that snored lightly on the sofa waiting for him to return. This Harry that washed blood from his hands and kissed his scars. This Harry bore a pretty flush across his cheeks and moaned deeply as Draco tasted him. Not the cold, lifeless body that had sat propped in his office chair. Not the empty green eyes that stared in unending silence. No, his Harry’s eyes burned the color of the Killing Curse. His lips bruised pink from kissing. He started to turn over when Draco stopped him.
“One of the many perks of being an in the Order of Merlin-First Class.” Harry tossed him his coat. “People tend to just do things because I smile at them.”
Harry nodded. “He’s an excellent chess player.”
“Ze did zay they were keeping it quiet, az to not affect ‘Arry’s relationship with us.” Fleur quipped. “Zo he marreed a former bad boy. I’m inclined to agree with Molly, he iz
“Harry, you should not be so flippant about this situation.” Draco said sternly. “Someone drugged you. Someone could have tried to hurt you that night. You’re lucky it was me who sat down next to you.”
"Bloody fucking brilliant."
“You thought this as an eleven-year-old?”
“So, what’s it like being married to one of the youngest Deputy Head Solicitor in Wizengamot history?”
Pansy in turn rolled her eyes. “Oh, of course you would, Potter.” She popped her head over the sofa. “C’mon Draco… Bring the little lion with you. Merlin knows he could use a little mindless debauchery.”
“Harry, I swear to Merlin—”
“Oh Potter, you make a beautiful bride.” Pansy purred.
He sighed, flopping back on the bed. “Perhaps I’ll pop round to the Foundation offices today instead of lazing about the flat.”
“Good.” Narcissa smiled sweetly, then left the dining hall.
Harry bucked wildly. "Draco, I-I'm g-g-going... Fuck, Merlin,
“It… er… It is?” Harry breathed.
The blonde wizard rolled his eyes. “Petulant child…”
“Take your takeaway and husband home.” The elder solicitor instructed. “I’m sure that Mogin and myself can handle a simple recanting.”
“Yes Mistress.” Mipsy bowed and popped out of sight.
“Oh, darling…” Draco buried himself to the hilt within Harry. “You’re going to need it.”
“I’m sorry if I startled you earlier.”
“And when you returned to your office, you found a body sitting in your chair?”
“It’s a good habit to have, mate.” Ron quipped.
“I’m sorry… I just worry about you.”
“I wanted—” Draco began.
“This is my fault. We had to elope, I couldn’t have my family interfering. I didn’t want to lose him.” Draco pulled Harry’s hand away from his lips again, this time pressing a kiss to it. “I realize that I’ve taken that joy from you all… I’m sorry for being selfish.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m glad you think so highly of me, Granger.”
“No, I don’t believe so.” Harry replied.
Draco and Harry split apart quickly. “Mister Cristler.”
“Harder… Fuck… Harder…” Harry panted.
"That is obscene, Malfoy." Hermione snapped.
"So," Harry wrung his hands nervously. "I guess I'll go change."
"Alright..." Hermione sighed. "But when you get back we're talking about this."
Draco nodded. “Oh yes. It makes me just want to…” He licked a stripe up Harry’s stomach. “Eat you up.”
years’ worth of experience.”
because I am desperately in love with you, I threw away my betrothal to the Greengrass and married you.” Draco strode into the kitchen. “It’s good idea.”
Pansy sighed impatiently. “Fine, but do hurry. This is a time-sensitive matter.”
Draco narrowed his gaze. “How did you know that I graduated Dux et Primo from Brierley?”
“A-alive…” He whimpered. “Y-you’re wearing m-my clothes?”
“Perfect.” Lysander smiled. “Goodnight, Mr Potter.”
“That’s incredibly taxing to do every day.” Draco replied. “Perhaps we can reside at my apartment during the week and your lovely cottage on the weekends and holidays.”
"We should go home, Draco." Harry said shortly, not looking at the group sitting in the front room. "I think we've taken up enough of Ron and Hermione's time."
Harry walked briskly towards the desk. He ran his hands through his hair and adjusted his recently transfigured suit coat when he reached the desk. The woman sitting behind the desk currently had her face buried into a copy of the latest
“Isn’t it?”
“You thought it was information I needed to know.” Draco said quickly. Cristler was motioning for him. “Thank you. I have to go.”
"Oh yes..." Marc smirked. "Apparently they all had very pressing family matters to attend to."
“Is there any particular reason my wreath has flowers and yours does not?” Harry questioned.
“Am I not allowed to fall in love with you?”
“And if I don’t?”
“Well…”
“Yes, Grandfather, you’re probably right.” Draco took Harry’s hand and headed for the door.
“Draco.” He said plainly.
“That’s honestly the only thing they really care about.” Harry murmured.
“I would very, very, very much like you to do all those adult things to me.”
“I don’t feel the need to read your mail.” He rolled his shoulders. “I thought you were helping me wash my back.”
“Because they’re a reminder of how idiotic I was believing in the Dark Lord.” He touched the center of his chest. “
Harry fell into step with Draco. “Where did you learn to sing?”
“I—” Draco swallowed again, unable to finish.
The blonde set about to readying himself for bed as quickly and quietly as possible. Harry moaned, brows furrowing. Draco frowned, taking in the fact that the dark-haired wizard was having yet another nightmare. He slid under the duvet next him and Harry twinged again, this time a breathy ‘
Harry shuddered slightly. “You remember that night?”
Harry propped himself up on his elbows. "Drake..."
The blonde pressed lightly against the bruise, causing Harry to flinch. “Yes, I have.”
Draco pressed a hand to Harry’s forehead. “You don’t have a fever.”
Draco looked down. “I am sorry, Grandfather.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Who would do something like this?”
“Do tell.” She replied excitedly.
Draco smirked, continuing to thrust sharply into Harry. His hand curled tightly around Harry’s left hip. Vulgar epithets fell like rain from Harry’s mouth, demanding Draco drive harder, to go deeper. The blonde dutifully obliged, letting go of Harry’s hip to curl it underneath his shoulder. He snapped his hips, driving himself deeper in Harry. Draco set a punishing pace, forcing the brunette to brace himself against the headboard.
Remus raised an eyebrow. “So, you think they genuinely like each other enough to elope?”
“Bossy, bossy.” Draco replied, punctuating the words with a thrust.
“Draco…” Harry shuddered.
Draco blushed. “I just had to prove myself, is all.”
“I will not hesitate to slap you upside that pretty blonde head of yours.” Harry walked briskly through the open door.
“You look fine.” Draco replied, straightening his tie. “Actually, you look better than fine. You should wear wizard-clothing more often. It suits you.”
“You have a lovely voice.”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Remus asked.
“Oh Merlin, no.” Draco raised an eyebrow. “I don’t
“Thank you, Narcissa.” He replied, adjusting the wreath on his head.
Draco groaned. “Not if you would like to stay attached to testicles. Walk faster.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I very much doubt my husband uses Dark Magic to send me a note that he’s going to be late.”
“It was.”
Ron cleared his throat. “We think it would be best for you to stay out of the Ministry for the time being.”
“You swear?”
Harry shivered. "Will it hurt?"
“Was there anything else you noticed?” Quentin prodded. “Anything else in your office that seemed out of place?”
“I usually don’t.” Draco replied. “It’s tedious to go back and forth. If I need something from a file, one of our clerks will do the running for me.”
He stood in front of the mirror, brushing his teeth. After rinsing, he stared at his face. He stared at the smattering of freckles that dusted over his nose and cheeks. The way his green eyes stood out in a ridiculous manner but still somehow fit his face. He wasn’t unattractive by any means but he wasn’t anywhere near Draco Malfoy’s league. He sighed and dipped his hand into a pot of Sleakeazy’s hair potion Hermione had gifted him and quickly ran his hands through his hair. Exiting the bathroom, he dressed quickly and Apparated to the location that Draco had given him. He hadn’t landed for more than thirty seconds to find Draco waiting patiently on a park bench, reading the
Harry turned up the wattage on his smile. “But you can for me, can’t you?”
“I don’t… I don’t know…” Harry arched his back. “I’m so hot…”
Harry groaned, clawing the sheets. “Yes, d-don’t stop… P-please don’t s-stop…”
Harry sat back in his chair. “Surprisingly normal. He works long hours. I cook dinner and wait for him to come home. He reads in bed and we snuggle. It’s all very normal.”
“Yes, I am well aware of how charming I am.” Draco replied, backing Harry up to the bed. “As much as I would like to continue this, I do have to go into the office.”
“Draco insisted on this one. Said it would make you happy.”
“That’s fair.” He pressed a kiss to Draco’s chest. “Draco?”
He looked up. “Hello Lydia.”
His question was answered with a moaned. “G-go away…”
He stared down at Praetor’s dossier, running a finger down the list of his accomplishments.
"Alright?" Draco panted.
"So why hasn't he... Er.. You know."
Harry and Draco landed soundly in the middle of Draco’s living room. Harry stumble slightly as he made his way down the hallway to his bedroom. He placed his hand on the wall to steady himself.
“Yes, very good.” Quentin focused on his notepad. “But potentially dangerous if it’s intercepted, especially so if someone is stalking you.”
Draco nodded. “You started wearing your hair longer, like it is now. I liked the way it curled over the collar of your uniform. I wanted nothing more than to bury my hands in it.” He tucked of the said hair behind Harry’s ear. “Plus, your ass looked phenomenal in a pair of Quidditch breeches. It might have been more that than the hair.”
“Welcome to Hall of Records.” She deadpanned, flipping another page. “My name is Poppy Canham; how may I help you?”
“Surprise.” Draco deadpanned causing Harry to roll his eyes.
“Mother—”
looking like a deer caught in headlights.”
“But…”
Draco kissed both of her cheeks. “It’ll be fine, Mother.”
“It was so real… So real…” Draco murmured. “There w-was so much—”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You’re not helping.”
Harry held up his left hand. “This marriage. Your mother seemed quite clear on us dissolving it at some point.”
Draco leaned back in his chair. All, or most as Marc had said, of the clerks had gone home for the day. He stared down at the small pile of paperwork he'd completed. Surely the clerks that were still here had no desire
“You are my husband, I am allowed to buy you things. Nice things that you’ll look very handsome in.” Draco said haughtily. “Just like you’re allowed to sleep in my bed.”
even live here. I certainly won’t make you either.”
“I just don’t understand why the food needs to be so complicated.” Harry replied, pushing the crab puff around his plate. “It’s just food.”
Draco pulled the away from the wall and walked quickly down the hallway. Harry giggled drunkenly as he tossed him onto the bed. Draco shucked his shirt and shed his trousers. Harry played languidly with himself, hand sliding up and down his cock as he watched Draco undress.
Draco glanced sideways at Harry. He looked pale, shaky even.
“Yes, yes…” Pansy capitulated. “Anyway, your beautiful bride has been linked to exactly four people. Ginevra Weasley, which the entirety of the Wizarding World knows how that ended.”
“Because I’m making an effort to remember.”
“Yes, I’m wearing your clothes.” He touched his face.
“Well, no…”
“It wasn’t intentional, we were both drunk.” Harry replied, pulled his shirt more firmly over the bruise. “We just got a little out of hand. I mean I practically asked for it…”
"It's completely unnecessary." Draco replied, eyes returning to work. "I'll have this finished in no time."
“I knew it! You’re too pretty to be completely human.”
Harry yanked down his shirt. “It’s fine…”
“Merlin, no.” Draco huffed. “I… er… wanted to make sure that you’re alright. The
Harry looked stricken. “We’re meeting your grandfather now?”
“No, I cannot say that I have.”
“Oh, shut it!” Harry tossed a pillow from the bed towards the bathroom. “You’ve enjoyed the perks of having a house-husband. Besides, my role isn’t deeply involved in the day-to-day operations. It’s better that way. People can actually get things done. I show up and the volunteers lose their minds.”
“It’s slang for being dosed with Rohypnol.” Harry sighed at Draco’s continued confused state. “It’s a Muggle date-rape drug.”
“It must be so hard for you.” Draco deadpanned. “Navigating the day-to-day of your life.”
“It is, I just didn’t think that Wizardkind adhered to the same traditions.”
"Say what again?"
Draco pulled the spoon that had brought them to the Manor gardens earlier in the evening. Harry wrapped his hand loosely around the spoon, leaning into Draco. The blonde whispered the password and the pair was whisked away from the garden party.
Draco awoke the next to find himself alone, the sounds of a shower running in the distance. He sat up slowly, his head pounding in time with his heartbeat. Slipping out of bed, he made his way to his en suite bathroom and ripped open his medicine cabinet. After downing a Hangover Elixir, he splashed his face with cool water. Draco stared at his reflection, the color returning to his cheeks as the potion worked its magic. Sighing, he stepped into the shower, washing quickly. He exited his bathroom and dressed quickly in solicitor’s robes.
“Don’t b-be gentle… J-just fuck m-me.” Harry snapped.
“Good morning, you’re up earlier than usual.” Draco leaned against the wall.
Harry snorted, opening the shower door. “Still
he’d been sharing his bed with.
“Upgrade, actually.” Draco replied. “Monetarily speaking.”
“Good to know.” Lydia leaned forward onto the desk. “He’s treating you well?”
“Am not.”
Harry flopped back down on the bed, hearing the crack of Disapparation. “No, you’re to good for me.” He replied quietly.
Quentin closed his notepad. “I think we have everything that we need, Mister Malfoy. Thank you so much for your time.” He tapped the speaker box and then pocketed it. “The Department has assigned you a protective duty, both of you. From what I understand, Mister Malfoy, HSW Cristler has given you leave.” Draco nodded. “You’re welcome to enjoy it, all I ask is that you don’t leave the United Kingdom.”
“Are you making breakfast?”
“Who I’m sticking my cock into.” Draco finished.
“You asked me to dig up the dirt on your hubby’s former dalliances.” Pansy retorted. “For a short list, the information was difficult to find.”
“I’m sure it’s very lovely. Utterly adorable.” Draco deadpanned. “It’s just not in an ideal location.”
Draco rose and stepped around his desk. “You miss me?”
“When?” Harry tilted his head slightly, listening intently.
Draco cleared his throat. “Valentine’s Day.”
“You want to stay for a cup a tea?”
Draco started down the corridor. “Separate exits, don’t you think?”
Lydia nodded. “Of course, I’ll let Reid know.”
...” Harry slipped the certificate into the inner pocket of this cloak. “Fucking fuck.”
She smiled. “Always.”
“An ouroboros dragon, that’s a rare symbol.” Harry touched the sigil on Draco’s chest.
“Yes, apparently your impossible information wasn’t so impossible. Though,” Pansy replied. “It’s an extremely short list. Like makes you look like a degenerate-hussy-short.”
“Yes, Grandfather.” Draco stood, motioning Harry to come with him.
“I’m not sure, but I’m blaming you for this recklessness.” Draco growled. “Perhaps you should slow down,
." He puncuated each word with a fierce thrust.
