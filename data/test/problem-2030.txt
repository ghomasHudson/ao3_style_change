“Oh, I definitely am interested in what he would think of it, but more so because I think it would be absolutely hysterical to see his reaction.” Ginny grinned in reply, unfazed at the idea of her brother jinxing her.
Potion class was one of the few classes where Draco felt like he had a bit of control over what was going on. He had always liked potion and it was something he had been naturally good at since the start.
“Yeah, he’s definitely putting up with a lot of taste testing without complaining as well, so I would say pretty nice” Amelia said back. “And he’s really pretty as well…” Amelia added as an
“Aren’t you a desperate one.” Draco mocked, although he was in full agreement with Potter’s statement. It just wasn’t easy not to try and provoke Potter at any given time. It was ingrained in him after all.
“Indeed I do. Also-“ Draco said, pulling out a neat little package from his bag. “I brought you something.”
At first nothing felt different. They were still seated next to each other, so it was difficult to tell.
Something about Potter’s firm grip on him and his intense gaze made Draco unable to hold back a shiver. Why? Why did he become all weak and stopped putting up a fight when Potter showed any sort of dominance?
With a slow pace, Harry pushed a finger in, and Draco felt his body react as he spread his legs wider allowing more access. He moaned as he felt the heat enter him. Harry’s other hand was stroking his thigh in a soothing motion.
“Well, there’s no way I could ever hope to make drinks as good as yours, though. You’re literally the best barista I have ever come across” Draco said back.
“Like I’d throw myself at you. You have quite the confidence for even thinking that, Potter.” Draco scoffed.
But as he had reached his home and quietly closed the door behind him, being engulfed in silence, he hadn’t been able to keep it together anymore.
“Fine.” The taunt obviously worked as Potter was now staring at him, squinting his eyes slightly, a look that was familiar to Draco. It resembled the young schoolboy who had snapped back at everything Draco had said, be it taunts or outright accusations. “If we’re going to get on the talent wagon, I can’t help but bring up the favourite topic of the day. Quidditch.”
“Just… you know, a happy memory is all.” Draco didn’t feel like sharing exactly what he had been thinking of, and neither did he feel like that was something Pansy needed to know.
Draco gave her and Blaise a small smile as he muttered “Thank you.” The rest of the trip was fairly quiet between them, although the tension seemed less dense. Everyone seemed to be in need of some peace and quiet before facing Hogwarts once more.
“Well, I never really found it to be interesting. Cooking on the other hand, I find much more enjoyable.”
Draco felt himself eat more than he had in a long while. It was of no use though since his own body couldn’t benefit from it. Luckily, it seemed like Potter did eat decently as well, Draco thought as he glanced across the great hall at the Slytherin table.
The payment was quickly managed, before Draco handed the container to Potter, receiving a soft “Thank you.” coupled with a small smile before Potter was out of the doors, the sound of the bell unusually loud as Draco was once more left to himself.
“I wasn’t…” Draco felt his words leave his mouth in a whisper instead of the sternness he had in mind.
It was fun to get to see the town properly and having Harry talk about the various places and their history. The guy did know a surprising lot about quite a few places in the town.
“Yeah, neither did I.” Potter hummed in response. “I imagine it’s doing well now that it’s a potion shop though.”
“That’s amazing! I’m so glad we managed to figure it out!” Overjoyed she hugged Potter before turning to Draco.
“Ron is pretty bummed out by it. He was looking forward to having Harry be part of the family.” She added with a faint smile.
Time had gone by quickly and before Draco knew it, Hermione was ushering Rosie to say goodnight before carrying her up the stairs as she wailed, not wanting to let go of her new best friend.
“Your definition of regular clothes is quite different from most, Draco. Honestly, expensive brand clothes aren’t regular clothes.” Pansy did a dramatic sigh before continuing, a glint in her eye appearing which made Draco slightly nervous. “I’ve never seen anyone wear such tight fitted pants and looks as good in them as you do.” She waved her hand at him, then looked at Potter as she spoke, putting on a casually annoyed tone pretending like her next words weren’t focused on once again getting Potter’s attention to the things Draco had to offer. “He’s got a great ass. Even I’m jealous to be honest.”
“I just practiced it a lot, is all…” Draco felt the words tumble out of his mouth and he felt himself sounding pathetic with how embarrassed it all made him. Potter seemed less aware of what his words had done to Draco and just continued.
Draco sighed as he once again stood outside the big wooden doors of Granger’s office. By now, he was definitely spending far too much time trying to convince one of his former rival’s best friend that he was, in fact, not together with said rival.
“Is that a yes?” Potter inclined his head to the side slightly, too similar to how he had done it in the picture.
No… Crying wouldn’t help, it never did. He should just bury it deep down and figure out a way to make things less awkward than what he anticipated the next time he met Harry.
“Wow! Look, Harry! The paste isn’t making my skin all red and itchy!” Weasley seemed to have momentarily forgot who exactly it was that brewed the potion as he studied his arm with interest and what could only be described as delight from someone who had spent a bit too much of his time whining over the pain and itch caused by the usual paste.
“Let me see you” Harry said as he carefully guided Draco’s hands away from their position between his legs.
“Shut up.” The words were ice cold and a vast contrast to the burning glare that was now mere inches from Draco’s own face.
“Maybe someone cast a spell on us?” Potter was pacing back and forth in their room. They had both decided to miss breakfast after Draco said he would rather die than have to try and act nice towards that Weasel of all people.
“Ginny and I are a couple, so no need to worry.” The airy voice could only belong to one person, and Draco felt himself shrink slightly at the sight of Lovegood. It was the first time they had met since the war. “Ginny is just being protective of the people she loves, I’m sure she will change her mind once she gets to know you more.”
“Again, no need for hurtful comments, Malfoy.” Potter’s lips twitched as he flew off to the other side of the field.
She mumbled a few spells that seemed to do nothing, paced a bit more back and forth before trying a few more spells.
Draco blinked as he felt something sturdy beneath his hand. He opened his eyes fully to see Harry’s sleeping face beside him. The memories of the night before flooding back to him.
“Yeah, sure, but…” Weasley hesitated as he took a bite of his chicken. “He’s way too different. He was being all chummy and acting like he and I were friends.” Granger looked at Draco with an alarmed expression. All Draco could do was return the bewildered look.
“I figured it would wake you right up, hearing something like that.” Potter had a cheeky grin on his face that was irritatingly charming to Draco.
“I suppose I would have to do something grand, like fly around London or something.” Potter chuckled. “Although I suppose I wouldn’t mind if you tagged along on a ride like that. It was always fun to fly with you despite our differences and me being such a great flyer.”
“Sure, why not.” Draco was feeling in a good mood from what had just happened and decided to take pity on Pansy and go have a couple glasses of wine and tell her all about his day.
“Fuck, Harry…” Draco felt his cock tremble as he was filling up more and more. But before he could reach it, Harry slid his fingers out.
“Just make yourself at home, you can watch TV, oh and also there’s iced tea in the fridge” Harry said as he disappeared into the bathroom.
“Am not! And you just need to figure out something that will make you happy. Then it won’t really matter what everyone else thinks anyway.” Potter said with a yawn, seemingly unaware of the impact his words had on Draco.
Just the pleasure from rubbing their cocks together had been more than enough to satisfy Draco for quite some time. He enjoyed the closeness and seeing Harry feel good because of him.
“I’m fairly certain that you don’t have a fever. But you should probably take it a bit easy just in case.”
“Don’t worry, you can borrow my shower if you want to. I’ll get you some dry clothes in the meantime” Draco was stunned for a moment, as he realised the weirdness of the whole situation.
“Oh, he absolutely do! We used to play against each other during school. He was a seeker just like me.”
With Granger’s help, Draco managed to stagger over to the couch and slump down. He was just about to clutch at his chest once more, when he realised that the pain was ebbing off quickly.
“Fine! We have some stocked, how about you take a sip!” Pansy almost shouted back, heading towards the shelf.
“You might want to focus a bit on the potion homework as well before you intend to die. It’s due sooner.” Blaise said in a low voice without looking up from his potion book.
“Stop trying to blame yourself. I’ve seen your nightmares, and I had no idea about the way you were treated at the manor. If I had been in the same position, with none of my friends there to help me then I would’ve done the same.” Potter said as he went over to Draco’s bed and sat down beside him. “Can I hug you?” Draco thought that he should refuse it, but the softness of Potter’s voice made him unable to stop himself from giving a short nod.
“What?” Draco couldn’t for the life of him keep his sanity in check as he tried to calm down and stop staring at Potter’s way too perfect lips so close to his. Something in the back of his head tried to push through and tell him that Potter seemed to be more than aware of how much he was affecting him, but it didn’t matter. Draco was close to going mental the way things were progressing.
Everyone was sleeping over at Harry’s place, as no one was especially keen on going outside in the cold weather.
‘I’ll be dead before I reach 30 at this point…’ Draco thought to himself as he started walking back to his villa.
Harry then went to make some hot chocolate to both of them before they settled down on the couch again and continued talking for a while longer.
“I’ll be sure to remember it. Thanks.” Draco could feel the hot air on his lips as Potter spoke, however the long-awaited kiss he had expected were nowhere to be found. Draco opened his eyes in confusion just as he saw Potter’s eyes lingering on his lips before he regained his posture.
Closed eyes and calm breathing indicated Potter was indeed still asleep. Draco looked at him for a moment longer. He had never actually seen Potter’s sleeping face before, and it was annoying to see just how perfect he looked, laying there with the sun shimmering over his skin.
“At least now you can go about the house as you’d like instead of walking hand in hand all the time.” Granger grinned at the frown she got from Draco. “There’s so many rooms in this house that it’s only good if more of them are being used.” She looked down for a second, a look of melancholy on her face when her gaze fixated on Potter and absentmindedly said “It’s certainly been livelier in here these past days. This house is too big for only one person to live here.”
"Visiting her parents. I was going to go with her, but one of our plants are sick so I have to tend to it. It's fine though! She'll be back home tomorrow." Luna sounded cheery as she waltzed through the house.
“It’s fine.” Draco said curtly, still trying to process the dreadful thought of sharing a room with none other than Potter.
The honest and sudden compliment put Draco off his game as he suddenly felt overly aware of himself and how he moved his hands. It abruptly felt like he was unable to do anything without being clumsy at the moment, knowing Potter was looking at him with such fascination rather than just mild interest or for the lack of anything better to do.
“I get it. We’ll be very grateful if you could try and look into this tomorrow or so. It doesn’t seem to be as straight forward as I hoped.” As Potter spoke Draco hadn’t noticed that he had inched closer to Potter. However, it helped ease the lingering pain in his chest even more, so he ignored the desire to scoot back again.
“I have imagined this before, but it’s nothing compared to the real deal.” Draco might’ve pondered a bit more about what Harry just said, had it not been for the sudden onslaught of kisses attacking his neck.
That had only made Draco more insistent on closing the shop. He had argued, “But Pansy! I can’t do the order! I have no clue what it even is. And I’m certain they’ll run away if they’re met by me.”
He stared at the small tracking device that had once again found its way to his lab after another one of Potter’s spectacular stunts out in the field.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open as he felt his predicament wash over him. Of course, he didn’t want Potter to kiss him! But at the same time…
For a moment they both just stayed like that, feeling the aftermath of it. Draco whimpered as Harry pulled out slowly. He could feel semen leaking out from his hole, and knowing it was Harry’s made him shudder in delight.
“The damn nauseousness is gone! I’ve had it for two weeks in a row now, and I was losing it. I can’t believe the help I needed was right here.”
This realisation seemed to dawn on Harry a moment later as he shifted enough to get Draco off him and push him down on the couch, managing to get hold of both of Draco’s hands in the process. Harry huffed and grinned as he pinned Draco to the couch.
“Huh?” Draco couldn’t help but meet Harry’s eyes at that point. He needed to know if the guy was being honest or had suddenly become a lunatic.
Now Draco could only hope she wouldn’t go blabbering to Potter about their little conversation. Merlin knows Potter would find a way to get some fun out of it if he knew exactly how Draco was feeling.
Potter was standing behind him. His hand holding onto Draco’s wrist as he was motioning for the movement needed for the spell. It was then Draco realised that he was still slightly taller than Potter, but not by a lot. Potter had grown taller during the last years or so, and his breath felt like fire as it hit the back of Draco’s neck.
He had spent many sleepless nights now trying to figure out a potion that could help him get rid of the nightmares. An old book from the library had been his best shot as it described a potion that could potentially help with just that.
The pounding got faster and faster, making it difficult to breath. It didn’t take long before Draco felt himself tighten even more as he came with a loud moan. His come shot out onto both his and Harry’s chests. It seemed to tip Harry over the edge as well as he became ridged and stilled his thrusting. He came hard and plentiful, groaning as he closed his eyes, feeling every single sensation. Draco also closed his eyes as he felt his hole fill up with warm cum.
For a second Draco just looked at it, a bit dumbfounded. Did they share the same Patronus? But no, this one was different from his. This one had big antlers on its head, and it shone so brightly, so full of magic.
“It does indeed.” Draco muttered, needing a moment to gather some strength. By Salazar he would need it, considering he was now dealing with his school nemesis that he hadn’t seen for the last 7 years. However, he was fairly certain Potter wasn’t in the possession of a wand at the exact moment, considering Draco had interrupted his bath time or so it seemed, so the chances of having any curses or hexes thrown his way was rather small. Draco had just managed to get a glimpse of his own wand laying on the bathroom floor. He must’ve accidentally losts it during the confusion when he fell into the bathtub.
However, as he sat by the living room table, helping Rosie, he noticed that he was being watched. More than once he caught Harry looking at him with something he clearly recognised as fondness in those green eyes. It made Draco’s hands shake slightly, as he was still getting used to having his no-longer-unrequited love look at him with such adoration.
Draco felt himself almost fall backwards off the couch as one of the spells Granger procured felt like an invisible force yanking him away from Potter. At least the guy had good reflexes, as Draco knew was natural talent from their times at the quidditch matches. It resulted in a strong grip on Draco’s arms and no fall damage to Draco or his pride.
The minute of awkward silence between them gave Draco a chance to take in everything that was currently going on. He quickly realised that he was basically straddling his completely naked nemesis, while their chests were pressed together firmly. He also found that the only way to relax his head and neck was by leaning it onto Potter’s shoulder. If he hadn’t been so worn-out from the fight, he would’ve tried to keep his head as far away from Potter’s shoulder as he possibly could, but his pride would have to wait.
“Oh! Yeah, my sister is much more proficient at potions than me, so she’ll be helping me.” The witch said, mirroring the smile back, seemingly relaxing her tensed shoulders a bit before accepting the bag that Draco had put everything into.
“Also, you never once mentioned anything about yourself being straight in any of the scenarios. So I’m just taking my assumptions and walking away, okay. And then hopefully I’ll see you for dinner some time, under…slightly… different circumstances.” She winked, and Draco could only look at her retreating form in utter astonishment.
“Hey! At least I gave it my best! Do you know how terrifying it was to have a best friend who’s such a great chef, and then there’s me, who can’t boil an egg” Ron huffed, but didn’t seem to take the jokes to heart.
Harry thought back on what had happened. He had been taken completely off guard when Draco had leaned in and kissed him.
“Must’ve been awful to do well in potions and have all the glory given to me.” Potter suddenly said, half-jokingly, but Draco could see a hint of regret in his eyes for the event that had occurred previously.
“Well, I suppose we can’t be sure before we get some distance between us.” Draco said, standing up and starting to move away.
“Why not use your wand and save energy. Are you that desperate to impress everyone you come across, oh saviour?” Sure, Draco knew the spells Potter had done weren’t the most challenging ones, but still. The effort it took to do non-verbal, wandless spells wasn’t something to take lightly. Draco had managed a few light spells non-verbally, but never without his wand as well, and it once again showed an inequality between their magical powers that made Draco’s old dislike towards the guy start burning all over again and he couldn’t help himself. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten, but I’m probably the last guy who would find anything you do impressive, Potter.”
“You know… it’s quite nice to be coming out of the shower and seeing you in my flat.” Harry grinned as Draco slipped into the bed beside him.
“I do indeed. Used to play quite a bit when I was young.” Draco said, relaxing slightly as he was presently having the upper hand.
‘I’ll know when I wake up.’ Draco thought to himself as he hid the potion again and leaned his head back down on his pillow. He slowly dozed off, hoping that the potion would soon start to take its effect on him.
“What are you saying, love? Why not make it your business? I can tend the shop if you want to leave now? Or I can come with you and wait outside if you want? Either way, you’ve been given permission by none other than one of his best friends to visit him, so why not take it? I’m sure he’ll appreciate it immensely. Especially if you bring the potion as well!”
Hermione just looked at him incredulously. “You… Why are you… You never call me by my first name.” She looked between the two beds and made clear to notice the obvious difference in who owned which bed. “That’s Harry’s bed, isn’t it?” She looked dumbfounded and in desperate need of an explanation.
“Thank you.” It was difficult to say who of the three looked the most surprised by Draco’s sudden words of kindness. But before Draco could say anything else, Granger lit up and gave him a smile “No problem!”
A couple of hours passed by as they sat and talked. It was surprisingly easy to get along with the two girls, and Ginny seemed to be the friendliest of the Weasley’s once she had overcome the shock of finding Malfoy in Potter’s house and had let go of her greedy desire to watch drama unfold between him and Potter.
“We’ll see, I guess.” Ginny said thoughtfully, before frowning slightly. “Why haven’t you gone to St. Mungo’s yet?”
The feast began as food started piling up on the extensive tables set in front of them. Having a meal at Hogwarts was something Draco never believed he would experience again, but here he was.
“You are insane! There’s no way I’ll be letting Potter teach me!” Draco felt the panic rush over him.
Before Draco could make another step, he felt a hand on his arm “Wait! I really need to talk to you” Harry said.
Draco felt his words lose any meaning as his mind was filled with the sensation of Harry pounding into him, hitting his sweet spot over and over. He could feel Harry throbbing as he continued thrusting into him.
“Well, perhaps I just taunted you in order to avert your attention. I’d say it can be quite helpful in succeeding an attack.” Potter was not keeping his grin to himself as he walked over to Draco.
“Fuck! I almost forgot about that.” Potter groaned out. Having been so close to one another, the pain had been completely non-existent until now, which only made the reappearance of it feel even worse despite not putting too much distance between them.
“What was the original purpose of it?” She had stopped twirling it around and was now focused on Draco.
year.” It was easy to notice how quite a few new and old students turned their heads towards the Gryffindor table in order to see if the saviour of the wizarding world was among the returning students.
He slipped his tongue out and licked Draco’s lower lip. He could feel Draco tense up at the action and was about to tear himself from the kiss, when he felt Draco opening his mouth ever so slightly.
“Well, I’m always happy to see you guys in the bakery, so I’m a bit glad for the lack of skills actually” Harry said with a big grin.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t aware of what I was doing. I know it’s a shitty thing to do when I’m still trying to figure everything out.”
‘Things can actually change, huh?’ Draco thought to himself as he sipped on his fire whisky. He had never imagined in a million years that he would actually be able to consider both Hermione and Ron as friends. However, the most farfetched of them all was him ending up with Harry Potter of all people.
“You ready?” Draco asked as he held up the vial containing the potion. “As ready as I’ll ever be.” Potter muttered, before accepting the vial and taking a long sip of it.
Granger placed the book at Potter’s desk and sat down, studying the potion. “Can I see the ingredients you used?” Draco felt a hint of annoyance at the fact that she was making sure whether he had used the right ingredients. Still he gathered the ingredients and placed them in front of her.
“Too big of a risk, not gonna do that.” Draco didn’t lift his gaze when he heard Pansy sigh dramatically beside him.
“I wasn’t! She always exaggerates her wording!” Draco tried to defend, feeling awkward that Harry seemed to know quite a bit about his childhood, while he knew little of his.
Before he could finish, the wheels inside Draco’s brain started turning, and he brightened slightly when he realised Granger ‘might’ not actually be looking sick from having to say his name or look in his direction.
Ginny snorted, and they began flying around the pitch aimlessly. “What Ronnikins doesn’t know can’t hurt him,” she said haughtily. “Besides, this isn’t about my broom-nicking. You must have some idea what you want to do, huh? We’re all dying to know.”
Harry, reluctantly amused, scrambled around his desk for a something to write with. He found a Muggle Biro and some paper and penned an affirmative.
“I don’t think he’s up to anything,” Harry said truthfully. “I just… I don’t know.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably.
It dropped its burden and flapped once before settling itself onto the counter, watching Harry expectantly.
‘Yes, well, things got a little out of control and my magic sort of lashed out at her,’ Harry said, tracing a ring on the table. Ron seemed to take this in for a few moments.
“I wish you’d come along, mate. You and me against the world, you know? We would’ve made great partners. Not that Brocklehurst is bad but… she’s not you, Harry.”
Harry waved him over, and the red-head weaved through tables and chairs before sitting himself down across from Harry with a sigh.
Harry nodded and hummed in agreement. Luna was a fantastic painter – the roof of her room was a testament to that – but Dean was bloody gifted. Scarily so.
‘Draco’s been teaching him colours. It happens when he’s excited, now,’ Andromeda said, smiling down at her grandson. An owl swooped in the window, and Andromeda excused herself to answer it.
Please PM me or comment if you find any errors – I don’t always catch them all, and I've got no beta. Any volunteers? xP
I didn’t want it to – I couldn’t control it. I was so sorry. But she didn’t want me back. ‘Mione, what have I
Harry’s smile turned wry. He knew Ron desperately wanted Harry to come along too, but Harry just couldn’t stomach it.
‘For what it’s worth, I don’t – nobody would mind if you are… you know. It’s not a big deal. I’ll see you around.’ She stepped back from him and spun, Disapparating with a resounding
“What the hell are you doing?!” Draco shouted, clutching Potter’s shoulders, his legs awkwardly wrapping around his naked waist on instinct as not to fall, despite the hex keeping them together.
“Do you mind if I take the right side?” Potter asked as they had been hushed along by McGonagall telling them, once more, not to be late for the opening ceremony.
“I’ll assign you all a partner for today, once you’re teamed up, go practice the hexes I’ve taught you.” Professor Evergreen quickly started teaming people up.
They both followed her into the back of the house and through a quaint turquoise door that led to a beautiful garden filled with numerous flowers in different colours.
There was a moment of silence as they both sat there, a hint of awkwardness filling the air around them until Draco furrowed his brows.
“Yeah, well…” Draco almost decided to just say it was Pansy’s shop and be done with it, but he had become quite proud of the place, and he wanted to keep some of his pride intact, especially in front of Potter, so he decided to tell the truth. “Actually, I own the place. Pansy tends to the customer’s and such.”
“Welcome back all of you.” McGonagall started as she quickly looked around at the few students that had decided to return for the additional year. Draco couldn’t help but look to the ground as he felt her gaze on him. “As you all know, this year is optional, but it will allow you to get your N.E.W.T.s. Now, there will be some changes to the way things work when it comes to all of you. There will be no house separation and you will be placed in a shared common room in one of the towers.” Gasps were heard here and there from a few of the students.
“You don’t have to feel so bad about it, Draco. It wasn’t your fault.” The small smile on Luna’s face made it clear that she knew what Draco was trying to say.
“Yeah, sorry to ruin your little deductions, but Draco and I certainly aren’t a couple. Although God knows I tried nagging him into being my boyfriend when I was young and dumb.” Pansy made a grand gesture of ignoring Draco’s glare as she walked over to one of the tables and put the lunch down, her tone way friendlier than Draco’s. “Also, for your information, we weren’t scheming, we were gossiping. I must say, the golden trio were quite a popular topic back then. Or well… one of you were.”
“Remember to stir it twice clock-wise and four times counter clock-wise.” Professor Shrew said loudly as he strolled around the classroom examining the potions.
“Well…I’m not particularly touchy, I think…” Potter’s expression turned into one of thoughtfulness as he slowly stirred the sauce. “I do hug people that I’m close with such as Hermione, Ron and the other Weasley’s, but that’s about it.”
“You’re quite a remarkable potion master, what with being able to properly convey all these instructions in such a… well-spoken manner.” The cheeky grin on Potter’s face would’ve made a younger Draco want to punch him out of confusion, but his older self knew better. His older self would want to wipe it off with something much gentler than a punch.
“Sorry about that, I’m so used to the customers being from around here, so normally we don’t talk much about it and everyone just knows that when the weather gets bad everything kinda just closes down for a while”. The guy said, weirdly apologetic to something Draco felt was his own fault.
“What a bang-up job you did.” Had Potter’s wards been so weak that Draco couldn’t even feel them? And he managed to get through such a ward with almost no energy left? That would either mean something had happened to the wards, or Potter was just completely shite at putting them up.
Harry gripped his hand tightly and leaned in to kiss him, while they both came hard. Draco felt his back arch up as he came, while feeling the hot mess inside of him.
He collected his wallet and keys, and just as he was about to walk out the door, he spotted the spider hanging about on the windowsill. He considered killing it, but ultimately decided against it. Ginny wasn’t here, and he could do with the companionship.
Harry put his empty teacup on the coffee table and settled himself down next to Teddy, who squealed and started handing him blocks.
He threw the paper down on the counter and it burst into flames, startling the owl into squawking and flapping about. Harry couldn’t care less. How
‘I don’t know. I –’ he stopped, realising how it might sound if he told her that when she touched him it made him feel sick to the stomach. ‘I just guess I’m not in the mood, or something,’ he said lamely.
Luna was dressed in a yellow sundress, which was quite pretty, but she had an apron over the top that said
Harry, outraged, snatched it up again, his magic rising around him and crisping the paper at the edges.
‘Are you here to buy an owl? That barn owl there is very friendly, but it doesn’t like being left alone too often,’ she said, pointing. ‘And that one’s quite pretty and can fly very fast,’ the dark-brown owl she pointed to preened, hooting softly in agreement. ‘But he’s also very proud. He’s not been sold because he bites people he doesn’t like, the owner said, and they bring him back.’
‘Is this what you do for fun now, then? Tell random Muggles they’re wasting their money and convince them not to?’
Hermione made a face at Ron and told him about her classes, sliding in a quick lecture or two about how what they were learning would’ve been useful to Ron as an Auror. After a while, Hermione placed her hand against the side of her mouth dramatically, as if telling a secret, and leaned in to whisper loudly at Ron.
“Yes, you’ve had quite your share of that.” McGonagall smiled sadly and sipped her tea. “You have quite a knack for Defence Against the Dark Arts, however.”
‘Harry?’ She said, her hair mussed prettily and her cheeks flushed as she lay underneath him on the lounge.
‘Bloody awful,’ Harry commiserated. He was glad Ron had gone into the Aurors; he’d flourished, gaining confidence and skyrocketing to the top of his class - something Hermione never stopped gushing about.
“I hear you’re having trouble deciding what to do with your future,” she said. “The options can seem overwhelming, particularly for someone like yourself. Any ideas?”
This chapter was an absolute horror to write. It just wasn't coming out how I wanted and I still don't like it, so I may change it later. Any suggestions for improvement would be welcome, I am desperate. :')
. Every time I tried to talk to you or even mentioned sex, you rejected me.  Is that why you pushed me away just now?’
‘Bocks, ‘Ry, bocks!’ Teddy looked at him expectantly, so Harry stacked them up in piles and Teddy nodded his approval. They soon had a rhythm going; Teddy handed him blocks, Harry stacked them and Teddy knocked them over with his dragon.
‘I’m going to float you over to the lounge.’ Harry gave her a half-hearted thumbs up before he was floated into the air, landing on the lounge with a gentle thump. A blanket spread over him and he curled up, passing out in moments.
‘There was no time!’ Harry protested. ‘I’ve been going to funerals and trials every day! When would I have had time for this?’ He gestured between them sharply.
Harry, forgetting breakfast as his stomach clenched in nerves – what would Ron think? Would he be as accepting as Hermione? – decided to go grocery shopping to pass the time. Merlin knew his cupboards needed it.
“I just thought you ought to know,” she said, shouldering her – Ron’s – broom. “Out of respect, you know?”
‘Good. I suppose that settles it, then. Just a big mistake, and all. She told me you’d already apologised. Plus I know mum’s already sent you a Howler. Sorta makes whatever I could say seem a bit lame in comparison, doesn’t it?’
Trembling, he noticed the letter he’d forgotten in his anger and picked it up, tearing it open. It was a note written on a scrap of lined paper.
It was true that he could have whatever job he wanted just by being him. But he didn’t want that. He was sick of that. Despite it all, he was still just Harry, and he was back at Hogwarts to decide what he wanted to do instead of what Harry Potter was
Ginny twirled on her broom, her hair swirling behind her gracefully. “Well,” she began slowly. “We’re all meant to have a career talk with McGonagall later today. Why don’t you tag along to that? I’m sure she wouldn’t mind.”
he thought with resignation as an owl bearing a letter the distinctive red of a Howler approached the window.
Harry blinked, refocusing his vision on Hermione who now stood in front of him. She’d softened after the war, no longer frail and ashen, and had become a little less serious. Only a little, though.
The owl nipped at his fingers, snatched the letter from his other hand and took off out the window. He stuffed the treats back into his desk, but quickly changed his mind and banished them. He’d buy some more in Diagon today.
“Mum sent me a care package yesterday. I’m going to eat that while I do some light study in bed,” Hermione said. She grabbed her bag and heaved it over her shoulder.
year’ if you will,” Shacklebolt continued, clapping his hand to Harry’s shoulder. “Perhaps you’d prefer to complete your N.E.W.T. exams before making your decision.”
“Oh, no – that’s not for another hour,” she said, and Harry frowned. Ginny hadn’t given him the time for the career talk. “But come in, Mr. Potter. Have some tea and a biscuit and we’ll have a chat, you and me.”
‘What should I have done, then? If I hadn’t gone to the trials, Draco and Narcissa would have been thrown in Azkaban without a fair trial!’
Shuffling into the bathroom with a yawn, he went about his morning routine. He sniffed himself and shrugged, figuring a shower could wait, and decided to get dressed. Slipping on a t-shirt that didn’t smell and a stepping into some jeans that weren’t too bad – He really needed to do some washing - Harry glanced at himself in the mirror and flattened his hair a bit, eventually giving it up as a lost cause.
“I’m not sure what to say,” Harry said, and Ginny’s face fell slightly. Harry quickly continued. “But I, uh, support you? I mean I’m not mad or anything I’m just surprised is all.”
Harry couldn’t understand it. One moment he’d been enjoying a snog with Ginny, the first real kiss they’d shared after the Battle, and the next he was pushing her away, an uncomfortable squirming in his stomach.
It was an owl, a large, regal eagle owl. Harry let it in and it swooped about the room importantly before landing on his dresser.
Harry glared at the ceiling. A spider was walking across the ceiling and building a web. How dare it.
“Well, you’ve got a fair amount of time to consider it,” McGonagall said. “But you best be off Mr. Potter. You have plenty of studying to do if you wish to take my offer seriously.”
‘You know, you’d be much better off buying that bigger bag with the little packets inside. It’s a bit more expensive, but much more convenient,’ Draco Malfoy drawled from behind, amusement colouring his tone.
year tower. Hermione would have finished studying in the library for now and moved on to studying in the common room. He wasn't sure if he wanted to tell her about McGonagall's offer yet, but he was definitely going to ask how long Ginny and Luna had been a thing. Had it been long?
They trekked back inside in good time, as the storm that was building broke out behind them. Ginny cast a quick Tempus.
‘And… Craig.’ The other spider didn’t stop building its web, but Harry thought that was just as well; if they started responding to him, they might be Animagi, and then he would have to kick them out. That would be a shame.
‘So, Craig and Thomas, what do you think about this?’ He held up the letter Malfoy had sent him. They didn’t respond.
years’ tower. It had been decades since the tower was last used, but the house elves had cleaned and cozied it up so thoroughly you couldn’t tell. The common room featured an eclectic mix of furniture styled after each house and a fireplace so large Harry was sure they could all huddle around it and have room for more, were they on friendly enough terms to do so.
A long, hot shower and a quick shave later and Harry was beginning to feel sort of normal again. Not completely normal - Ginny’s off-key singing didn’t float through the air and her perfume, which usually permeated the whole flat, had yet to be sprayed – but he was getting there.
The Floo flared to life in another room, and Andromeda called out. ‘The sitting room, Draco, I’ll be there in a minute!’
‘Well I can’t go around kicking puppies and torturing innocents like the big bad Death Eater I am, now, can I?’
‘What am I going to do with you, Harry Potter?’ Hermione sighed softly, shaking her head. She summoned a glass from the kitchen and filled it with water, placing it on the coffee table and summoning a packet of headache tablets as well. With one last glance at Harry sleeping on the lounge, she called out her destination and stepped back through the Floo, leaving the teen in peace.
Six o’clock came up too quickly for Harry’s liking. One moment it was midday, and the next it was quarter to six. Harry changed into a t-shirt and jeans, slipped his jacket on and Apparated to the back of The Leaky Cauldron. He pushed inside, and, thankfully, there were only a few people scattered about the pub. He ordered two Butterbeers and found a booth, slipping inside where he could see all the entrances.
Can you guess who my favourite character is? Also, this story is moving a little slowly, but that’s because I don’t want to force anything. This is probably my first really serious multi-chapter fic, and I don’t want to mess it up. Drop me a comment or PM me if you have any questions or just want to show me some love! :D
It was stupidly hot, the warmth before the storm had been building for hours, and Harry figured there was no better way to beat the heat than to fly around the Quidditch pitch during his free period. Hermione had half-heartedly tried to convince him to study with her in the library instead but gave up when Harry shook the sweat from his hair onto her.
‘You can’t escape your problems by drinking them away,’ she said, plonking down on the floor next to him and placing his head in her lap. ‘And you’ll thank me in the morning for it. Now,’ she said gently, running her fingers through his hair. ‘What happened?’
‘Harry Potter,’ called a dreamy voice from behind him as he was choosing owl treats. What was it with people finding him shopping? He turned and found himself startled into a small laugh.
‘Can I come through?’ She glanced around, but she probably wouldn’t be able to see him sprawled on the floor.
“It’s ‘Goku’, firstly. Secondly—” Michael suddenly noticed Harry. “Harry, you’d know. Who’d win in a fight – Goku or Superman?” The two students stared at Harry expectantly. He honestly had no idea what a ‘Goku’ was.
“You want me to be the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor here? At Hogwarts?” Harry said incredulously.
“Thank you, Professor.” Harry stood, vanishing the crumbs from his robe. McGonagall smiled, her eyes sparkling with something Harry couldn’t place.
Ever since they’d returned, Harry couldn’t help but watch Malfoy. He couldn’t explain why. If Malfoy was in the room Harry would inexplicably find his eyes drawn to him eventually. There was something of a buzz behind his navel, curiosity no doubt, that intensified when he looked at Malfoy.
“Class ended five minutes ago, Harry,” Hermione said, clucking her tongue at him. “Come on, we said we’d call Ron right after class.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful Ron!” Hermione beamed and turned her face up to Harry expectantly. “Don’t you think, Harry?”
‘I best be off, then. Gotta be up early tomorrow and all. I’ll see you around, mate.’ Ron stood and clapped him on the back. Harry followed, bidding him good luck.
and a tool belt around her waist with paintbrushes and pencils sticking out. She was also barefoot and stained with paint all manner of colours from top to bottom. There was a bright red splotch on her nose.
‘Oh well, if you do, he’ll probably still be here. I’ll see you later, Harry.’ She waved before wandering off, singing to herself in a language Harry couldn’t understand. Shaking his head, Harry paid for the treats and left, Apparating back home with a crack.
“What, becoming an Auror is the easy way? Try telling Ron he has it easy.” Harry grinned back and glanced down at her broom. Or Ron’s broom, rather. “He’ll probably make you do some of his drills for taking that again, you won’t think it’s so easy after that.”
Malfoy was back too, along with that Parkinson girl. Malfoy was here because Harry had testified at his trial, ultimately obtaining a pardon for the blond. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d done it. Maybe it was to pay back his debt to Narcissa Malfoy, who’d saved Harry in the forest. That’s what he told his friends, at least. Ron had called him a daft bastard and Hermione had frowned softly, but they didn’t try to stop him.
Ron had accepted without a second thought, and Harry was thrilled for him. However, Harry was more reluctant. He was exhausted, his bones weary at the thought of it.
Harry dipped and dived, twirling and tumbling through the air lazily. He’d had some offers to become a professional Quidditch player too, but he’d passed on those. Harry was a great Quidditch player, but professional? Not quite. Ginny, however, had accepted a spot with the Holyhead Harpies.
. It was the right thing to do!’ Which was apparently the wrong thing to say, if Ginny’s flaring nostrils were anything to go by.
‘Yes, well, family fortune stripped for reparations and a stupid tattoo on my arm banning me from most places will do that. It’s horrible, Potter. These Muggles don’t seem to realise the mistakes they’re making half the time. Look at that woman,’ he said, pointing to a middle-aged brunette down the aisle. ‘She’s buying that flour in the blue bag. The one in the pink bag is not only cheapest, but I know for a fact that there is no difference between cooking with either.’
He bumped into Ernie Macmillan and Michael Corner on the stairs, deep in another argument about Muggle heroes, and he hoped that Hermione would come with him to dinner today.
‘Could be worse. He used to call me “no”,’ the blond laughed as Teddy began to gnaw on his hand. Malfoy replaced his hand with a teething ring and grabbed his wand, muttering
“Mr. Potter,” McGonagall called. Harry stepped properly into the room. There was nobody else there, so he must be early. “To what do I owe the pleasure today?”
Ron launched into a fantastic story about the intense training he’d done that week: a weeklong stake-out and capture simulation as part of his Auror training. Harry and Ron had both been approached by Kingsley Shacklebolt himself to join the Auror program after the war.
‘No, Harry. It’s… It’s over. I’m sorry. Don’t – don’t come to The Burrow for a while – mum’s rather beside herself. Watch out for Howlers. I tried to tell her not to, but you know mum.’ She smiled wryly before waving her wand. All her stuff, from her green toothbrush to her favourite yellow shirt whizzed into the room, sorting themselves into the bag she was holding. She visibly steeled herself and stepped over to him, dropping a quick kiss on his cheek.
“Blimey, look at me getting all sentimental and mopey,” Ron said, sliding back into an easy grin. “Tell me about what you guys have been doing. Is it as boring as ever?”
‘’Ry! ‘Ry!’ Teddy grabbed for him, hair turning black and his eyes flashing green, and Harry plucked him from Andromeda’s arms and spun him around, much to Teddy’s delight.
A few minutes later, Ron stumbled out of the Floo, still in his Auror garb. A few patrons who had been huddled in the back stood up and left, and Ron watched them suspiciously while Tom glared at him from behind the bar.
they? How dare they think they had a right to his life? His private life was not a paper-selling front page article. They had no right to it.
Well, Harry knew why he was here. The thought of being an Auror had made him feel empty inside. He was tired beyond belief, but he hadn’t the slightest clue what he wanted to do otherwise. So, like a handful of others, he returned to Hogwarts to do his 7
‘Must you, Draco?’ Andromeda said from her perch on the arm of the lounge. ‘We were having so much fun.’
“You’d have to apprentice under me for two years, of course. And your N.E.W.T.s would have to be favourable,” McGonagall said. She paused, searching Harry’s face. “I think you should consider it carefully, Mr. Potter. I don’t make this offer lightly, though I understand it might not be a path you ever thought of taking.”
’ His eyes watered and his throat grew tight and he curled into himself. ‘I never wanted to hurt anyone and now I’ve hurt Ginny and the Weasleys will all hate me and you’re gonna hate me too and nobody will want to talk to me anymore and –’
Thoughts? The spider was just thrown in on a whim chapter two, but I like him. We have a spider in our house that we don’t kill because he doesn’t bother anyone and keeps the bugs down. His name is Phillip. Next chapter is called A Chance Encounter. What do you think that means? ;)
‘I saw that article in the paper the other day. Are you okay, Harry?’ She asked, her eyebrows drawn in concern. Harry grimaced, running his hand through his hair.
‘Shi – vers,’ he said, correcting himself at the last minute. ‘I’ve got to go.’ He leaned over to Teddy and dropped a kiss on his head before rising gracefully.
“I kind of had to,” Harry smiled wryly and fiddled with his biscuit. He wasn’t sure this talk was really going anywhere.
They sipped their drinks in silence for a while before Ron stretched and settled himself more deeply into his chair.
I don’t have much to say, other than enjoy, and thank you to TazzieLuv13 on Fanfiction for the name Thomas!
“What kind of things?” Harry said, sounding somewhat more defensive than he intended. Hermione muffled a giggle.
‘What, can’t handle the truth? Poor little Pot—’ her head snapped to the side with a cry as a wild tendril of his magic slapped her across the face.
Harry sat numbly on the floor, his stomach lurching with the enormity of what he’d just done, what he’d just lost. The Weasleys, his family, the people who took care of him when nobody else would, probably hated him now. Oh
“Look, I just don’t understand how this Superman character could win in a fight against this Kogu character. You said he’s weak to some rock and the other guy just keeps getting stronger and stronger,” said Ernie.
‘No, I think it is,’ she said, invading his personal space. ‘Because if I do this—’ She made a grab for his crotch and he jumped back, pushing her hand away as his stomach clenched.
Harry sighed softly, and Hermione jabbed her elbow into his side. Harry turned to glare at her, but she wasn’t even looking at him.
Parkinson didn’t have a trial, but if she did Harry would’ve testified for her too. She’d sent letters after the war, apologising for how she’d acted during her school years. Harry wasn’t sure he really believed it was anything other than an attempt to save face in the wake of Voldemort’s defeat, but it didn’t really matter to him anyway. She was back at Hogwarts and spent most of her time glued to Malfoy’s side.
Andromeda accepted the subject change with nothing more than a raised eyebrow. ‘I’ve been quite well. Teddy’s a handful, but that’s nothing new. Young Draco has been visiting more often though, which helps a lot. He looks so much like his mother,’ Andromeda mused, her eyes going distant.
‘Yes, I thought you’d agree. I wonder what his game is.’ His wand buzzed next to him, meaning it was about fifteen minutes to one, and he stood up, dropping the letter on the table.
‘Yes, I was mad. So mad. Prob’ly the maddest I’ve ever been,’ he declared, flopping his arms and legs back out like a starfish.
They sat in silence for a while more, Ron considering him and Harry getting more and more resigned to Ron’s hatred as time wore on.
The image of Harry in billowing Snape-like robes filled his mind and he almost laughed before the sadness panged in his chest.
He wandered into the kitchen, set on finding something to eat that wouldn’t upset his stomach. The icebox held only milk, butter and a couple bananas, and the cupboard only a few tins of soup and half a loaf of stale bread. He closed the cupboard door with a sigh, figuring toast would do. And tea. Definitely tea.
“There’s my Harry! Oh, I almost forgot,” Ginny said, brows furrowing. “I actually came out here to tell you that I’ve been… seeing a bit more of Luna lately.”
It wasn’t a bad idea, really. Some outside perspective might really help Harry at least narrow down his options.
“Blimey mate, again? What’s he up to this time? Studying too hard?” Ron laughed. “Do you actually think he’s up to something?”
Thoroughly chewed out and downright ashamed of himself, Harry only had time to mope around the flat for about half an hour after Molly’s Howler before his fireplace flared green, Hermione’s head popping into the flames.
making sure everyone else was okay!’ She shouted, her voice wet. ‘And you would have noticed that if you’d
written on it in elegant cursive. He flicked it open and took out the letter, reading the familiar script with a bit of confusion.
They sat in silence a while, Hermione petting his hair and Harry watching the spider trek across the roof and over to the window before coming back inside with a spider friend. His flat was apparently being invaded.
He went into the bathroom and had a quick shower, changing into a hooded jumper and some less-questionable jeans from the drawer. He stepped back into the lounge room and pointed at Craig and Thomas.
So? Thoughts so far? Next chapter might be some Luna, might be some Draco, might be both. I don’t even know yet. Stay tuned! :D
‘Thomas,’ Harry said, testing it out. The larger one seemed to pause, and Harry decided that that meant it had accepted the name.
“Yes, that’s what I thought. You need to take this seriously if you want to get a job that isn’t blasting dark wizards,” Hermione said. “Just because you
‘Will do, mate.’ He stepped back through the Floo and disappeared in a column of flames. Harry went back outside and Apparated back to his flat. The spider - who probably could use a name, now that Harry was keeping him – had migrated to the pot plant by the door, its web sparkling in the light. Oh wait, no it hadn’t; that was the spider friend it had brought in last night.
Andromeda chose that moment to come in, steering Draco into the sitting room fully and handing him some tea.
He grabbed his wand off the coffee table and trudged into the bathroom. A lifetime of war taught you not to be unprepared, regardless of how safe you thought you were.
A scratching on the window interrupted him, and he glanced over to see an owl with the Daily Prophet and a small envelope held in its beak. He threw the window open and the bird swooped in, arcing around the room once before landing on the counter.
Harry raised a brow quizzically. “Yeah, you guys are friends, of course you have.” Ginny shook her head and her cheeks pinkened slightly.
‘Dray bocks,’ Teddy said happily, handing Malfoy about half the blocks and pushing the rest to Harry. ‘’Ry bocks. RAWR!’ He held up his dragon, bringing it down in front of him with a thump.
He felt a sudden longing; Ginny would usually laugh and scruff up his hair at this point, laughing and telling him to give it up as he scowled at her in the mirror. ‘
Harry returned his focus to his parchment. He’d barely written a sentence before he’d trailed off into scribbles. There was a stickman portrait of Binns tucked away in the corner, and a poorly drawn snitch trailed lazily around the page.
And so, Harry returned to Hogwarts. While he had certainly crossed off History of Magic professor from his list, he hadn’t made much headway otherwise in deciding what he wanted to do.
‘Now I’m warning you guys, you spread much more and I’ll have to start knocking webs down. And don’t bring anymore friends in while I’m out,’ he said, feeling only a bit ridiculous as they simply continued their work. At least they didn’t get offended and bite him.
“I’ve been told Hogwarts is offering those whose last year of education suffered during the war another chance at their N.E.W.T level classes. An ‘8
‘Down, ‘Ry, down!’ Harry laughed and set Teddy down, who zoomed over to a stack of blocks in the middle of the room.
“Thank you, Professor,” he repeated softly. McGonagall nodded, and Harry decided that was his cue to leave. He ran into Ginny on the way out, who grinned cheekily at him.
“Yeah, I think I will,” Harry said, leading Ginny to the ground. She landed beside him and thwacked him on the back.
“There are plenty of dark wizards who have so far evaded capture, and there will no doubt be many more who attempt to succeed where Voldemort failed,” Shacklebolt had told them. “It would be an honour to accept you both into the Auror program immediately.”
‘Oh, lots of things! The roof of the house needed some new paint. The Wrackspurts were taking over. They love the colour brown, you know. And our roof was just the perfect shade. Did you know they have art classes at Hogwarts now?’
She waved at him from below, mounting her own broom to join him up in the air. They’d broken up not long after the war. It was completely mutual, but Harry sometimes wondered why it didn’t bother him more. She was the love of his life, he’d thought, but it all just kind of fizzled out.
‘Dray!’ Teddy squealed, his hair running through the rainbow before settling on Malfoy white. Little traitor.
This fic doesn’t contain any intentional character bashing - Harry and Gin are just going through a rough patch. I love Ginny too much as a character to bash her. She’s just so badass! :3
Harry watched with growing amusement as Malfoy trotted off towards the woman. The woman appeared to disagree with him at first, but Malfoy eventually managed to convince her to put the blue bag back and grab the pink one. She nodded at him in thanks and moved off down the aisle, and Harry made his way over to the blond.
“Ginny, come on!” a mousy blonde cried, grabbing Ginny’s arm. “I don’t want to sit next to Darcy, he still stinks from that Dungbomb.”
‘You didn’t even deny it!’ A distinctly nasty gleam entered Ginny’s eyes as she stalked closer to him. ‘You know what? Maybe he
Harry was woken from a strange dream about defeating a dragon by playing the guitar and putting it to sleep (1) by a loud tapping on his window. He blinked at it myopically, squinting at the blurry blob before stumbling out of bed and sliding his glasses onto his face.
In moments, the fireplace roared to life and Ron’s face blazed into existence. Even fire couldn’t capture the vibrant orange of Ron’s hair quite right.
“You might have noticed that I have yet to find a suitable candidate to fill our Defence Against the Dark Arts position here at Hogwarts, and have resorted to teaching it myself,” McGonagall continued. “People still think it’s cursed, you see. So, I’ve been looking for someone who isn’t afraid that the Dark Lord’s curse might still be lingering.”
Gnawing on his quill, Harry wondered why he was back at Hogwarts. He’d defeated the Dark Lord, for god’s sake – why was he here listening to Professor Binns drone on and on and
“McGonagall offered me the Defence Against the Dark Arts position,” Harry said, and Ginny’s face lit up.
Whether it was the war or his Auror training, Ron had become uncharacteristically diplomatic about Malfoy. Gone were the days where even the mention of the blond’s name would send fury swirling into Ron’s eyes.
on the back and handed it to the owl, who gave a soft hoot, glared at the mauled banana and took off out the window.
“You were, now hush. I’m not letting you copy my notes, so you better finish yours,” Hermione said, her quill scratching away as she spoke.
‘See you around, Potter,’ Malfoy said, not really meeting his eyes. Harry didn’t blame him – he wasn’t sure if Malfoy would have seen the pity in his eyes, but Harry was sure he wouldn’t have liked it if he had.
‘Nothing. See you around, Malfoy.’ Harry stalked off, knowing he may have been a little irrational but not particularly caring. He paid for his things and left, not once looking behind him where he could feel Malfoy’s eyes burning into him, and Apparated back to his flat.
Draco reached down and got hold of Harry’s black hair, feeling the softness of it as he tried not to push down.
“You’re way too optimistic.” Draco felt himself tug at his sleeve a bit, feeling an uncomfortable worry of never being able to cast a Patronus creep over him. He had been a death eater after all, so there was no telling if he could actually make it happen.
Draco could see the slight frown of contemplation on Potter’s face when he quickly glanced at the guy before looking down again.
His hands ran through it over and over, feeling the softness. Oh, how marvellous it would’ve been to be able to tug at it lovingly, knowing it was your right to do so.
“Alright then. I will say your names and appoint you a number. This will be your room for the entirety of the year, and you will not have the opportunity to change rooms. Is that clear?” McGonagall looked around the room as a few people nodded here and there while others were grumbling. “Patil, number 5. Granger 7.” McGonagall started, and Draco felt a lump start to form in his throat at the thought of who he might end up sharing a room with.
“So green…” Draco said leaning forward coming nose to nose with Potter and continuing to stare at him.
“I simply had a bad day. Can I assume I’ll see you here again in a week or so, as that seems to be the limit for you to stay uninjured?”
He was, however, caught off guard by a pregnant Granger clutching Weasley’s arm. She looked the same as she had the last time Draco had seen her, which was only for a brief moment right after the war. Her hair was drawn back into a messy bun, and she looked completely and utterly exhausted.
“A potion!” Potter said, pointing towards Draco. “I did sniff that potion of yours, if that counts.” Draco looked at him with wide eyes, trying to process the new information.
“It’s not a joke, Draco. I’m seriously asking you. I wouldn’t joke about something like this.” The sudden seriousness in Potter’s eyes were flustering Draco profoundly.
Draco finally looked Harry in the eyes. He wasn’t entirely sure where this sudden confident came from, but he felt like he had to act before it disappeared again.
It was suddenly quiet all around them as the others had apparated back to the ministry and only Draco and Harry were left in the dark forest. They started walking.
“It’s fine though!” Hermione sounded anything but calm as she spoke. “It’ll only last up till 9 hours at most, so it’ll wear off before morning.”
“Okay.” Hermione clasped her hands together as she was now pacing back and forth while Potter and Draco was sitting on each bed, waiting for her grand plan.
“Harry doesn’t like you! I’m sure he has a bloody good reason to come here instead of another potion store.” Weasley said, then turned to Potter who still hadn’t made any comments on the current direction the conversation was headed in. “You don’t like him, right? Tell him!”
There was a deafening sound as the cauldron hit the floor just as Draco had picked it up the moment Potter decided to mess with him (or whatever that was). Draco jumped at the sound and could only thank Merlin that he had already used a cleaning spell on it.
“Oh…Wait…You’re not? I was certain! I mean, you’ve never even treated your girlfriends the way you treat him! I thought you had finally found the one” Hermione looked shocked as she had now turned her full attention to Harry instead.
He had spent quite some time there lately, trying out new recipes and Amelia forcing him to find the drink that worked the best with the given pastry. They had apparently had some really good feedback on the combinations decided by Draco, so now Amelia had also started to take an interest in having Draco test out the new pastries and drinks. Amelia was an exceptional barista and she took much pride in her work. But she said that she wasn’t too good at finding the best combinations of drinks and foods that went well together.
Harry sent her a smooth side eye, watching for her reaction. “Speaking of Ron… are you two still not talking?”
“Or maybe his jawline?” Draco carried on. “It’s very sharp, and he needs to shave a little more often. I wouldn’t want to get a rash from his scruff, you know?”
"Oh, I thought I booked the pitch for Gryffindor this afternoon...?" he trails off. Urquhart gave him a weird look, raising his eyebrow. His confusion was understandable. As the new Captain of the team, he had to have been feeling some pressure to step up and mark his territory to assert his dominance and keep his new position in check.
“What’s gotten into you, Draco? You’re awfully quiet tonight…” she said, her voice nasally and demanding. It was a miracle that Draco could stand to sit beside her at all, let alone converse with her.
Harry looked over to where Hermione was sitting and though she couldn’t see him, she still managed to send him a direct glare that said, ‘get on with it’. Harry sighed and pulled the vial from his pocket and uncorked it.
Ron grumbled to himself, looking back at the new happy couple. "I dunno, I guess I didn't really think it through all that much..."
The chatter of the Great Hall was loud and jovial as it often was so early in the morning. However, it seemed to die down when two specific people walked between two tables, hand in hand.
She hadn't meant to sound mean or pushy or imposing but after having the time to think about it, she thought maybe she could have accidentally come across that way. And she didn't want her friendship with Harry to suffer because of it.
He let out a nervous laugh and ran a hand through his hair to try and hide his blush as he looked away from her.
“I don’t know, Harry. Maybe a month?” Hermione said, her breathing shallow as they hurried their pace to make it to class on time. Her eyes darted around the corridors as they walked, making sure nobody was eavesdropping.
Harry rolled his eyes. He was anxious. He was practically on the edge of his seat as they waited. He just wanted this to go well and he couldn’t figure out why.
"Oh, uhh, my bad then. Sorry to interrupt, guys," Harry said cheerfully, waving him off. He turned to leave when one of the players interrupted.
. This wasn't the first time he'd been so blind or not thought things through and put things together. He was practically a lost cause. "Well then I guess I'll leave you to mull it over. You know, maybe if you took your tongue out of other people's mouths for more than a fleeting moment, you might realize that there are other people around you who have lives, too."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Ron said defensively, crossing his arms over his chest like a toddler throwing a tantrum.
Hermione scowled, huffing as she fussed with the potion. “How can we when his tongue is shoved down Lavender’s throat every two seconds.”
in these robes. Harry chuckled into Draco as he realized that his idea to brew Veritaserum had prompted the actions of the last few days in the first place.
Her words were brazen and Harry chuckled through his heated blush as he pushed his glasses up his nose.
“I think it looks ready, Harry,” Hermione said, lifting the liquid from the cauldron with a ladle before letting it fall back in. It was clear and didn’t have any kind of smell.
The Slytherins waved him off and before he could fully turn around, Harry locked eyes with Draco. Then, with a smirk, he turned dramatically and made sure to subtly shake his ass seductively in Draco's direction just to
Hermione rolled her eyes, realising that he was just pulling her leg. “You’re ridiculous,” she laughed.
She got up with a sigh, suddenly angry with Ron, and she moved to walk out of the Great Hall, abandoning her breakfast. She gave Harry and Draco one last glance with a fleeting happy smile as she walked out to get ready for her first class.
He couldn't believe what he'd just done. And he had no idea what it meant for him and Draco now, but he was more than excited to find out...
Hermione shrugged and looked down at her textbook. It was open on the page for Veritaserum, and she had Harry’s ratty textbook next to it, open on the same page. She had decided to consult both versions of the potion, in case the notes in Harry’s copy had any of the other helpful suggestions that had firmly placed Harry at the top of Slughorn’s class.
Draco shrugged. “I dunno,” he said. “They’re awfully tight, don’t you think? Like he wears a size too small on purpose because he knows that’s where I’ll have to look during quidditch matches when we’re both chasing the snitch. It’s a tactical move sure, but it’s very distracting. Not that I’m complaining. I just thought he wouldn’t play that dirty.”
Hermione lent into her friend's side, wrapping one arm around him in a half hug. "Worth a shot if he's something you want, right?" Her voice was low and kind of muffled by his shoulder as she nuzzled her face into his arm for comfort.
“Seriously Cresswell? That’s the third bloody time this week!” she screeched. “If you can’t learn to control your incantations then I’m going to stick your stupid wand somewhere it doesn’t belong!”
Harry grinned, bumping her shoulder. “I mean, if we’re going to the room of requirement, couldn’t it just supply everything we’d need then?”
Harry grabbed his Firebolt from the Gryffindor broom cupboard and made his way to the Quidditch pitch. He adjusted his game robes as he walked. Draco may have been right about his pants being a size too small because they were at that moment giving him an almighty wedgie.
Hermione frowned at her friend. “I don’t think that’s how it works, Harry. I think it just supplies you a place, not all your utensils, too.”
Hermione shrugs. “I’m not sure, actually. All of my researching in the library couldn’t give me that answer. In any case, I made a backup antidote potion if things go wrong.”
Harry and Hermione walked side by side down the corridor. Their voices were hushed and their heads bent together as they made their way from Slughorn’s 6th year Potions class. They had just attended a theoretical lecture about Veritaserum and learnt about it’s history and uses. Unfortunately, Slughorn had been instructed by the Ministry of Magic that the students were under no circumstances to be taught how to brew the potion.

“I can’t deny it’s kinda a hot look on him, though,” Draco went on. “And don’t even get me started on those glasses. I mean, they really give him that hot nerd vibe, you know, and then you add in that bod and he’s like a hot nerd jock dude and some days I just wanna…

“I was wondering how that happened to him,” Harry laughed. “He said he tripped and fell down the stairs.”
Harry chuckled and shrugged off his teasing. "Easy enough mistake to make, lads," he said. "Guess I've just had a lot on my mind these last few days." Harry looked pointedly at Draco, sending him a look and delighting when Draco's eyes widened in shock. He seemed to be catching on that Harry knew something.
Hermione rolled her eyes at her friend, dismissing his terrible idea tacked onto the end of his statement with one stern look. “I don’t know what to tell you, Harry. It’s a difficult potion, even for me. I mean, there’s a reason it’s almost illegal to brew and why the Ministry has such tight restrictions on it. It’s a very dangerous potion in the wrong hands, Harry.”
They walked through the entrance of the hall and Harry moved to follow them. As expected, Draco took the seat beside Pansy – who looked completely smitten and delighted to see him. Harry had a small urge to mess with her, but he didn’t.
Hermione chuckled at her friend. "Thank God you've finally realized," she grinned, sending him a wide smile as her eyes sparked. "I thought you'd never figure it out. I mean... like, dude, why do you think you guys get on each other's nerves so much? Your tension is like some weird kind of foreplay."
Harry grinned to himself and sent Draco a sultry wink before he finally turned and walked out of sight. Once he was alone, his hand covered his mouth and he laughed out in shock at his own recent brazenness.
Harry's eyes widened as he looked around the group. Draco was blushing and looking down, but Harry could still see that the tips of his ears were tinted pink. He smirked to himself as he continued to play dumb.
“Of course,” she said, exasperation clear in her tone. There was a smidge of annoyance there, too. “I was in here earlier. It’s got an invisibility charm on it. It’s on the table right in front of his seat.”
"What the hell was that, Potter?" he demanded, his eyes hard and his voice like a whip. "You heard me. I don't know how you did, but you did... didn't you...?" he said angrily.
Hermione made a hum of agreement and put the lid back on the cauldron before collecting her things. “Me too, I’ll be late to Arithmancy if I’m not careful.”
"I wanted to make sure that I apologized in person for how I acted in the Great Hall. I didn't mean to embarrass you...," she admitted. Harry gave his friend and odd look.
Hermione shrugged, taking a mouthful of her spaghetti as they waited for Draco to appear in the dining hall. She frowned once she’d swallowed her food. “Pansy usually saves a seat for him,” she said. “I think she might be in love with him.” Her eyes were light with quiet laughter.
As Harry was about to turn away again, another Slytherin – Harper, one of the substitute Seekers in case Draco was injured – piped up. "Do you guys always practice in your game day robes?" he asked. Harry looked around at what all of the Slytherins were wearing, noticing that they were mostly in casual clothes that they wouldn't care if they were ruined during practice.
He had to have been, because it was literally a truth-telling potion, but Harry wouldn't be fully convinced until Draco could say it to his face without the influence of the potion.
Hermione nodded. “Yup. I think we can slip a few drops in his drink at supper and then just see what happens. As far as I know, there aren’t any side effects if you distribute the potion before it’s ready so if nothing happens then we can just wait for the potion to mature a little longer.”
Harry had thought that Ron might start to ask questions about where he and Hermione were always disappearing to, but Harry barely even saw his friend now that he was dating.
Harry grinned smugly up at her. “Oh, so now you’re trusting my textbook over yours?” he teased. “I thought that ‘rule-following Granger’ wouldn’t want to run the risk of screwing this up with someone else’s notes?” His voice was light and jovial.
is going on?!" Ron demanded, looking over to Hermione. She seemed to have a shit-eating grin plastered on her face despite her shock that Ron had detached his lips from Lavender's long enough to notice who Harry had been pining over for the past six years.
Draco's fingers were still gripping against Harry's robes, only now instead of pushing him into the wall, they were pulling him into Draco's body. Harry's own hands, before abandoned at his sides, were now lifting and winding into Draco's soft hair to keep him close.
Harry rolled his eyes. His friend was going to get another tardy for playing hooky with Lavender if he wasn’t careful.
can’t ignore that. Plus, I really think we’re past that nickname, I mean, brewing this whole potion in secret is breaking about fifty school rules so you can knock that off.”
Because you see, Draco had been spending a suspicious amount of time alone. Suspicious enough for Harry to take notice and begin to get curious.
?” he asked, finally looking at Pansy who was sporting a look of red hot hatred. The girl was fuming. Steam was practically coming out of her ears.
"You're unbelievable, Ronald," she sighed. "Of course, he's gay! What did you think I meant when I said that they're dating now?"
As Harry made his way onto the Quidditch pitch, the Slytherin team looked up from their huddle to give him odd and confused looks. Harry spotted Draco on the edge of the group, blushing as he took in Harry's uniform.
"Hey," she said carefully. Harry looked up and gave her a nod, biting his lip slightly as he looked away. Hermione sighed and took a seat next to him. "Are you mad at me?" she asked, her voice quiet and unsure.
Harry nodded and balled the cloak up in his hands. He didn’t know how Hermione had smuggled it down to the Great Hall but he was thankful. He hadn’t even thought of it.
want, Potter?" Urquhart Rackharrow – the newly appointed Captain of the Slytherin team – demanded, glaring at Harry. Harry decided to feign innocence.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Pansy pouted at Draco for his lack of response. She lifted a hand and put it on his forearm to get his attention. Harry felt hot all over when watching the action – angered for a reason not clear to him.
“I bet he’s conspiring for the Death Eaters,” Harry had previously expressed to Hermione. She had turned him down for that, though. Despite his parent’s positions within
As Harry was walking back through the corridor, his Quidditch robes catching at his feet, he heard something from behind him – the fast thundering footsteps of someone on a mission.
“I’ve got that bag with the extension charm on it,” she said, lowering her voice a little. “I’m going to use it to carry everything we’ll need up to the Room of Requirement and then we’ll brew it up there.”
Harry blushed too. "Oh... Uhmm, don't worry about it. I was kind of in shock anyway," he said. Hermione rose an eyebrow at him in question and he sighed, shrugging.
Draco looked shocked and surprised, and the pink tinge on the apples of his cheeks was back. Draco couldn't believe what he had just done. He couldn't believe he could have made that move.
"Guess there's a fine line between love and hate," she said. "Honestly Ron, sometimes I think you're more blind than Harry without his glasses." She shook her head at her friend, noticing that Lavender had slid down the table slightly to make conversation with someone else while Ron was otherwise engaged.
In fact, his recent move to live with his aunt, Andromeda – Tonk’s mother – was enough evidence for Hermione to believe that Draco and his parents were firmly on opposite sides of the war.
"Uhhh, no, dude. You guys are booked for tomorrow. We've got the pitch today," Urquhart said. However, his voice wavered slightly and he seemed a little unsure of himself. As much was to be expected, I mean – people didn't just show up in competition robes for no reason.
Harry chuckled at her defensiveness and sat back on his haunches. “Alright, cool. So, you think it’s ready, then?”
Hermione shrugged and looked back over at Harry with a soft smile. "I mean, for starters you never realized your best friend is gay when it's blindingly obvious."
"I'm thinking... I wanna do it again," Harry smirked up at the other boy, who's eyes widened in shock before Harry leaned up on his tiptoes and pressed his lips against Draco's gently. Harry cupped at the other boy's jaw as he kissed him sweetly.
“Look, I’ve studied this book cover to cover,” she sighed. “I think that whoever it belonged to must have been some kind of genius and I’ve decided to trust them. I mean, look at how far even
She sighed as she ran a hand through her hair and made her way down to the lake's edge. Sometimes Harry liked to go down there and skip rocks against the flat water. He'd told her once that it helped him to think and he was able to think of each rock as a separate thought that he could push from his mind.
“Well, my textbook says that it’s ready when it looks like water and you can dissolve a feather in it, but yours says to wait a day longer than that stage to make it more potent. It says when I can dissolve a pebble instead of a feather, then that’s when it’s really ready.”
“I guess with no one there to guide the conversation and ask specific questions about Death Eaters, he’ll just say whatever’s on his mind,” Hermione giggled, eyeing Harry carefully. She had always suspected something about him but the blush on his cheeks just confirmed her suspicions.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “Clever,” he grinned. He always underestimated her genius. “How’d you think of it?”
Hermione looked around again, noticing that Colin Creevey perked up when Harry came into view. Despite having grown up a lot, the kid still kind of had a god-complex when it came to Harry and Hermione wasn’t about to risk blabber-mouth-Creevey learning about their plan.
Hermione just grinned and watched as he stalked, half embarrassed and half proud from the great hall. She looked back over at Draco who had seemed to finally understand exactly what he’d been going on about and she admired the pink tinge to the tips of his ears. He had his head down and was thankful that Pansy was the only one who had heard.
on the quidditch pitch seemed to now make so much more sense. Everything was falling into place for Draco as he put the pieces together.
Pansy just stared in shock as Draco began to get a faraway look in his eyes. Harry felt numb all over, and he felt like he was flying at the same time. It was an odd sensation, and one he couldn’t decipher. Draco’s words were doing something to him that he didn’t understand.
That look gave Harry a little more confidence than before. He grinned and made his way up to the group.
“So, Potter. I’m sure you didn’t come all the way here only to admire my…elegance. How can we help you today?”
When Harry took the vial and lifted it, Draco followed. Both only sharing a quick glance before downing the potion.
He let go of Draco’s shirt and sighed as he walked over to Granger. “What did you find?” Potter asked, seemingly unaware of Granger’s mild panic. “Oh! Well, it can wait if you guys were in the middle of something.” Granger started backing out of the room as she spoke.
“Well, what happened during the quidditch match was shocking at best.” Blaise continued on, not bothered by Pansy’s warning look.
So instead of taking his normal route straight back home, he crossed the sidewalk to peruse the few stores that were bathing in the afternoon sun.
“Hey! I’m plenty good already! Didn’t you see the last house match?!” Draco felt satisfaction at how easy it was to taunt Weasley. He still had the same attitude from before the war, and although it was infuriating to even talk to him, at least it felt somewhat normal.
Draco felt some of the cum from both of them mixing at his chest, while the rest fell to the sheets below him.
“Hey, Harry! Look, I was showing Hermione the new collection of quidditch gear” Weasley was excitedly trying to shove a magazine into his face, and Draco was one second too late in keeping his mouth shut.
He felt a tinge of warm breath hit his lips as Potter chuckled lightly. “I’m not going to kiss you unless you specifically tell me to, Malfoy.”
Normally, Draco was good at keeping his emotions in check, never letting himself turn into some stuttering fool, but the sudden turn of the conversation was something he was far too unprepared for. “I… I don’t! What!? Have you lost it?!”
“It can’t have been easy for you.” Draco said, feeling a sense of sympathy with what Granger had to put up with.
“He just needs time. Sure, he’s stubborn, but he’s also a really great guy and he is good at supporting his friends.” Potter tried to reason, but Draco felt like it would be a futile attempt to try and befriend Weasley of all people.
The class was fairly boring as they were going through previous potions they had learned during their earlier years at Hogwarts. Professor Shrew seemed exceptionally resilient today as he seemed to have mastered the technique of not needing to breath between his sentences at all.
“I can’t take wearing wet clothes, it’s the worst.” Harry said, grumbling as he tried squeezing some of the water out of the sweater.
Damn it. Draco thought, knowing he had to return it soon. It had been laying there for quite some time now, as Draco had continuously tried to put off delivering it.
“That’s good.” Draco tried looking anywhere but Potter as the ever-changing hair was making it difficult to concentrate. How on earth could someone look
Granger just smiled warmly, looking amused at Draco’s sudden incapacity to form sentences as his face started to look awfully similar to that of a tomato.
“Yeah, you’re right. His looks are kind off angelic I guess” Harry was still not seemingly aware of the fondness he was putting into those words.
Draco felt dread sweep over him at the thought of having to go back out into the storm at this late hour.
As he realised what Draco meant, he chuckled lightly. “I just had a small talk with him the other day. He wanted to know more about the situation and I honestly don’t blame him for that. I told him to be nice to you, or me I guess, or both of us that is.” Potter said.
“That’s the thing though…” Draco looked up as Granger was looking of into the distance with thoughtful eyes. “We know the formula that made it happen, so if we reverse the ingredients and make some tweaks here and there, then maybe…” Draco’s eyes widen.
Turning around again he almost fell as he jumped back from the towering Death Eater who had sneaked up on him. Just as he took in the look of sneering hatred on the man’s face, he noticed more hooded people emerging from the shadows.
Harry tilted his head slightly as he leaned in towards Draco. Their faces were once again inches apart and the tension hung heavily in the air around them.
“Hey…” Draco gripped the end of his shirt in a hopeless attempt at some comfort for the nervousness that was consuming him.
“Is that not your name?” Harry said with amusement as he walked over and hoisted Draco up, somehow having become used to him clinging to his chest, and therefore carrying him like that instead of on his back.
It was a peaceful atmosphere, and Draco wondered why he hadn’t taken her up on the offer to have tea earlier. Perhaps he just felt much more confident to face everyone now that he had someone by his side. Someone he trusted fully.
“Don’t worry, just lie back and enjoy it” Harry whispered in his ear. Draco couldn’t help the small moan that escaped his lips.
He decided not to linger too long in those thoughts as he continued reading his book and enjoying the delicious cake.
“Well, I don’t know about you guys, but I think it’s about time for me to hit the sack” Ron said, stretching.
“I did talk to Hermione yesterday.” Potter said while looking around at the various devices that were either hanging from the walls or on the various stands.
Another finger was pushed inside of him and it started making him moan as he relaxed into the touch. Harry kept going for a while, kissing Draco at the same time.
“How is Zabini, by the way?” It was difficult to know whether or not Potter felt obliged to be asking about their friends as well, but somehow, he seemed genuinely interested in the group of people who used to bully him many years ago.
They would talk about people that had died during the war, without knowing them, but still thinking they had the right to bring it up to the person who had nightmares about their deaths. Draco felt himself become irritated. He might not be the nicest person out there, but these people were being far too inconsiderate to the person who bloody saved their lives and future.
“It needs to be ingested right before going to bed, and hopefully, if it works, it’ll turn us back before morning.” Draco added, looking at Potter.
“Must’ve been hard on you…” Hermione mumbled. “What?” Harry looked at her with curious eyes. Was she aware of everything that had happened? Harry thought to himself.
“Oh, and I did discuss various topics with your mum as well. We became quite close in such a short amount of time.” Harry said nonchalantly as he rose from the bed and got his trousers on. “You want some breakfast?”
Ron wasn’t as interested in the highly intellectual discussions, but he was easy to get along with and he had a good sense of humour.
Harry looked to the side of the bed, searching for his wand before casting a nonverbal spell at his hand. It procured a thick lube that he smeared across his fingers. Draco would’ve been impressed with his spell work, had it not been for the situation at hand taking all of his attention.
They both looked at each other with a hint of cautious shock as Draco slowly got up and could finally put some distance between himself and Potter.
Another second that felt like an eternity passed by much to Draco’s demise, as he had to stand there uncomfortably shifting from foot to foot, while Potter looked dumbfounded.
“Well, you’re together, right?” Hermione all but whispered between them, as she looked over at Ron, Sebastian and Amelia being in a heated discussion about something related to pop artist, Harry managed to put together by the uproar between his friends.
“I’ll be going then.” Draco felt pain surge through him at the awkwardness he was currently enduring. But before he could turn to leave Potter reached out his hand grabbing his arm softly.
His shield could hold for a while, but not long enough. Draco yelped as he felt a hex hit him straight on. It sent him flying backwards and his wand tumbled onto the grassy ground a few meters away from him.
“I had no idea you were that good at chess!” Potter looked amazed as he had been watching their game intently. “You even beat Ron.”
Harry grabbed the lube stashed inside the nightstand and poured some into his hand. “It might feel a bit cold at first.” Draco gasped as he felt the semi-cold lube touch his skin.
“I’m gonna kiss you, so tell me to stop if you don’t want to.” Harry’s words were difficult to interpret for Draco.
Why was that witch so bloody clever at piecing things together and knowing how to catch him off guard enough to get her answers?
“I’m… sorry?” Potter looked flabbergasted at the idea of him leading anyone on with his behaviour. “I’m not used to having someone constantly be so close to me, so I suppose I didn’t notice.”
Draco broke eye contact first and cursed internally at himself. He had literally spent two days in Potter’s presence and old, hidden feelings were resurfacing. The jokes that Ginny had spouted had hit closer to home than he wanted to admit. Not because he had openly liked Potter or anything, he just… He just knew that he had never truly hated Potter, not once. Sure, he had been jealous of him many times, but he had also been impressed by him even more times. However, he never had time to properly look into why he’d been dreaming of Potter in his moments of weakness, or why he was so unbelievably interested in every little thing Potter did during school. Not until the fire that was. The moment Potter had saved him from the fiendfyre he had known. It had terrified him, and he had promised himself to bury those feelings deep inside of him forever.
“It’s you I’m worried about. I don’t want anything happening to you. I don’t like putting you out there as bait.”
‘I’ll be heading home for Christmas now, and I’ll be bringing someone with me. I hope you do not mind. The skies have finally cleared, and I can honestly tell you that I am fine, mother. I hope you are doing well, and I’ll be swift in my arrival. Until then. Signed your son Draco Malfoy.’
“True.” Ginny nodded back. “Yet, you seem to be more than willing to undermine Harry’s talents, now why is that?” The sudden twinkle in her eyes and slight smirk twitching at the corner of her lips made her look like she was staring down her next prey. She was good, he’ll give her that.
“I suppose I can’t argue with you on that. The Auror department is usually too noisy, so it’s quite peaceful here in comparison.” Potter shrugged as he once more was eyeing the various devices on Draco’s desk. “I do, however, enjoy watching you work as you’re quite brilliant at your job.” Draco felt his hand still, furrowing his brows at the sudden compliment coming from Potter.
“This would definitely be a great thing to add to the desert table at Christmas” Draco said as he continued eating.
“It will be an issue! What exactly is going on here? Why’s the ferret here? And why are you two acting so bloody civil to one another?”
“No… Well, my parents are currently traveling, so it’s not really possible” Draco first now realised the fact that he would probably end up alone at Christmas eve. He wasn’t too bothered by it, as it had happened a few times before as well. However, it just seemed a bit lonelier this year as he wouldn’t be going to his city friends’ parties. He didn’t feel like traveling back to the big city just for that. He really didn’t feel tempted to join various parties at this point. Perhaps he was just a bit tired, he thought to himself.
“That bastard…I swear…” He huffed, his heart finally calming down enough for him to stop hearing it pounding in his ears.
Draco got himself ready and when he climbed into bed, Potter had still not turned in for the night. With a flick of his wand the curtains of his bed closed, and he lay down trying to make himself comfortable. As he almost dozed off, he remembered something important he had almost forgotten about. He grabbed his wand and put a silencing charm on his bed. It was bad enough that he had to share a room with Potter, but he wasn’t about to let him hear as he woke up from a nightmare screaming.
“Yeah!” Draco stated, happy that someone understood. “It makes other people self-conscious. I know I’m fairly attractive, but then you come along, and I start wondering if I’m even attractive at all! We’re so different, so if you’re that bloody hot, then doesn’t that mean I’m not? It’s outrageous!” Draco huffed out in annoyance.
“Potter. He’s an Auror, you say?” Draco knew he shouldn’t be starting this conversation again, as he had been the one trying to avoid it, but his interest for the topic got the better of him.
“The bakery is going to be pretty busy until New Year, so I won’t have that much free time” Harry said in an apologetic tone to Draco as they were all busy layering themselves in dozen of clothing’s that would make it a tiny bit more bearable going out in the cold weather.
Draco stood there stunned for a second. He first thought Pansy was playing a cruel joke at him, saying he and Potter had been roomed together. But the concern that was plastered on her face made it highly unlikely for it to be a prank.
“It’s not funny, Ginny.” Potter said, sighing. “If we don’t figure something out, we might be stuck like this forever.” At that Ginny seemed to find it appropriate to laugh.
“She’s doing quite alright actually. Really looking forward to taking over the position in the prophecy.” Potter said as he smiled slightly. “and she’s been visiting Neville at Hogwarts on several occasions to help out with the creatures there.” Draco had come across a newspaper about Longbottom becoming the new Herbology teacher at Hogwarts. It was strange to think that they guy who seemed so helpless and clumsy now held such a high position. Yet, he knew that the guy had changed during the war. They all had.
After a moment Pansy and Potter both walked into the brewing room and Draco got busy working on the potion Potter ordered. It was the same one as last time, so Draco let Pansy handle the conversational part, while he focused on chopping up everything he needed.
“You said it yourself, she’s brilliant. I’m certain she will come up with something. If not, we’ll just have to try our luck with St. Mungo’s as well.”
“I wasn’t obsessed with him…” Potter mumbled but should’ve known better as he was once more ignored fully by both Ginny and Draco. Only Luna gave him a reassuring smile that somehow wasn’t reassuring at all.
Draco looked around the table at The Three Broomsticks. He would’ve never imagined seeing the current group of people gathered together like old friends. Just a year or so prior they had been on different sides in a war.
“S-sure…” Draco said, still not entirely sure if this was a good idea. He had never liked sleeping in the same bed as someone else. It always kept him awake the whole night no matter how quietly the other person was breathing. Draco just couldn’t handle it.
Draco jumped as he retracted his hand with lightning speed. He turned only to find that the airy voice belonged to Luna Lovegood.
As of late, he hadn’t had much time to contemplate things, as Valentine’s day had been getting closer and closer.
He walked past some Auror’s practically running to and from places. Noting that the whole department seemed rather busy and frantic this morning. To him that was a blessing in itself, as most seemed to ignore his presence altogether.
Once again Draco found himself in the unlikeliest of situations. Being seated with both Weasley and Granger and having a conversation regarding children, his potion shop, Weasley’s attempts at converting both of the other two to support the Chudley Cannons, and magical laws, in which both Draco and Granger was fiercely invested in.
“I mean, if he can, why shouldn’t he? He’s saved the whole wizarding world, I’m sure some name dropping should be okay.” Weasley laughed, before walking out of the shop.
He made his way over to their table, stopping in front of them. He almost had to remind himself not to sneer at them, as it had become a habit over the years.
“Maybe try to carefully move away from each other?” Hermione suggested, looking a bit worried herself.
“Prat.” Potter scoffed, but Draco noticed a faint smile on his lips. “But you know that’s not what I meant.” The sudden switch from banter to seriousness in Potter’s voice made Draco tense a bit. He realised Potter now had to experience his everyday life. It wasn’t a very pleasant one, Draco would know.
The surprise Draco had felt when he had realised that Amelia knew about his feelings for her brother was stunning. He didn’t think anyone would’ve noticed when he himself had spent such a long time even figuring it out on his own.
“Although, to be fair, underneath it all I’m currently in the process of a master plan. Once Potter is reeled in, I’ll go have a cup of tea with Granger and before you know it, you’ll be looking at a new golden trio. A far superior one that is.”
“Ah… well, thank you. And you’re the minister of magic I’ve heard. That’s quite remarkable.” Draco said awkwardly, trying to hold the conversation going.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t have done it either if I didn’t have to” Draco said back, suddenly wondering if he might’ve sounded rude by saying it like that, so he quickly made a follow-up “but since I have work, it’s nice to have something to look forward to before heading home”. Oh great… Now it just seemed like he was a sad, lonely guy taking refuge in the warmth of the tiny bakery.
“Yes, please. Ron here managed to get a pretty bad burn out on patrol today. Do you have time to make a quick Burn-Healing Paste for him?”
“You’re scared? For what? You’re a brilliant dueller, they won’t stand a chance against you and your team.” Draco said, feeling a bit more worried after knowing the great Harry Potter was feeling scared as well.
“Yeah, it was quite a spectacle. I even had to step in and help here and there” Sebastian said, not looking overly bothered by the fact that he could spend more time with the person he loved.
“Just take your time, I’ll be working on the pie in the meantime” The guy said as he laid down the clothes on the drawer next to the shower.
“As long as you do your best, no one will blame the outcome.” Draco just shrugged as he did not care to get into the whole ordeal of explaining how even people from his own house disliked him and would make it all his fault if he wasn’t able to beat Potter. Hell, the worst was the idea of having to see Weasley gloat about it for days on end.
“You know… I’ve been in relationships before, but I’ve never felt like this. Not even going all the way, and I still feel more content by this than anything else. I had no idea you could be this sexy” Harry said, keeping the serious tone throughout it all.
“I haven’t done this before, so you’ll have to excuse my lack of skills” Harry said as he leaned down and gave the tip a kiss before putting it into his mouth.
The Potter that he had seen so far was more composed and didn’t seem to take much notice whenever Draco gave him a disdainful look as they passed each other. Draco knew he should be careful with how he behaved now that the war was over, he had chosen a side although with not much of an option, and he would have to live by that decision for the rest of his life. Trying to piss of Potter wasn’t gonna help his stay at Hogwarts or his future. However, the lack of animosity between them, mainly from Potter’s side, made everything seem too unnatural for Draco. He needed something that had been normal before everything changed or he would surely loose it sooner or later.
“I’m not arguing about whether or not you are capable of walking in general, Draco. I’m just not overly convinced you’re capable of it at this particular moment.”
Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt and disposed of it on the floor before leaning down and planting a few light kisses on Draco’s neck. Subconsciously Draco felt himself baring his neck more, allowing Harry more space to plant kisses. He did so all the way up to his ear, before he took the earlobe into his mouth and bit down lightly on it.
“Tone it down, Malfoy.” Draco stilled as he heard Potter’s voice. “It’s all just fun and games, no need to argue about it.”
Draco didn’t know who looked the most shocked as Harry’s eyes widen in surprise, while he himself was unable to process what he had just said, out loud, to Harry.
through that.” Draco could hear the emphasis Potter was putting on ‘anyone’, implying he wasn’t satisfied with the way Draco had worded it. ‘Always the benevolent hero.’ Draco thought as he rolled his eyes out of sight from Potter.
“But…” Hermione said as she dried a few stray tears from her eyes. “That’s what makes them such great people.” Her tone was warm, and Draco could feel how much the two idiots meant to her.
“We still need to get hold of the ingredients though.” Draco murmured as he peered over the formula together with Granger.
Draco stopped as he, for once, looked around the small town. He usually put on music and kept his eyes on the sea that he could see all the way from his home to Malfoy company.
“What I have is… well, it’s not much, but it’s something.” Granger started. “I do believe the hex we’re dealing with is the stickfast hex, but it seems to have been distorted as it hit you during your apparition. Somehow it must’ve not known what to do as there were nowhere to stick you during your apparition, so instead it settled on the first surface it could find, namely…Harry.”
He opened his eyes slowly, realising that the sound of curses being thrown around him was gone and an eerie silence had taken its place.
As Potter was positioned between Draco’s legs, he hoisted them both up on his shoulders as he leaned down and started kissing the inner thigh on Draco’s right leg. It was definitely an unknown sensitive spot for Draco as he bucked up and moaned at the touch. Again, Draco had to keep it together as to not cum right there and then when Harry bit down and let his teeth scrape lightly over the tender skin, dragging them upwards.
“You gotta be joking! I can’t believe you still haven’t realised how shite that team is!” Ginny sighed dramatically.
“Honestly, the day where I finally managed to get him to cook together with me was a disaster” Hermione said, giving Ron a look of both fondness and laughter.
“Y-yeah… Sorry, I was just…” Draco looked even more flustered than Harry had seen him before, and all just because Harry had touched him a bit more intimately?
“Okay, so what were the ingredients?” Draco looked up, not able to hide his surprise for a second as he looked at both Potter and Granger who didn’t seem affected by what he had said. Most people probably had nightmares about the war, thinking Granger or Potter was any different would be naïve, Draco thought.
Harry sighed as he carefully turned Draco over and put him down on the bed, trying to avoid the mix of cum.
“I guess I’ll have to buy her something nice when this is all over.” Potter’s lips twitched slightly as he spoke.
He started packing his stuff as he heard a deep voice “Thank you for coming, hope we’ll see you again”. Draco looked up a bit surprised as he was expecting the black-haired girl, but instead
“Hermione?” Potter’s voice was filled with worry as he looked towards Hermione for any sort of answer to the current predicament.
As Draco’s face was only inches away from Potter’s, green eyes were suddenly on him, slightly glazed over from sleepiness.
“Stop that.” Draco gave him a glaring look as he reassured himself that his suddenly quick pulse was because of the adrenaline still pumping through him and not because of the look in Potter’s eyes.
It wasn’t ideal, Draco thought as he sat on his bed inspecting the small vial filled with a purple liquid. However, it was necessary.
He had imagined it would be uncomfortable sleeping in the same bed, but somehow, he had instead felt peaceful and easily drifted off to sleep.
“Hey, wake up Potter!” Draco was astounded at how easily Potter managed to sleep through the ruckus he was making.
“How nice of you to point out. Especially when you look no better than me.” Draco scoffed, adding “The endless homework isn’t exactly helping.” He figured the reason would be good enough to make Potter back off, and it was.
“Look at me!” Draco hissed back, and as Potter turned, he just stared at him for a minute in complete silence.
“That’s not true at all!” Granger said, and it took Draco by surprise at how strangely angry she seemed on his behalf. “You might not think so, but you did change sides during the war, knowing that there would be repercussions for it whether your side wins or loses. Sure, you were one hell of a twat throughout most of school, but you finally took a decision on your own in the end. We were all kids at the time, it doesn’t mean you deserve to die. The ministry didn’t think so, so then why should those damn Death Eaters have a say in it?”.
“Oh, don’t worry. You don’t have to leave if you don’t want to. I’m sure Harry would be happy to see you once he wakes up.”
“Hi there! You wanna head out for a drink?” Pansy looked worn out, and Draco could only guess that the work at Bewitched Dresses had taken its toll on her.
“It’s nice though. Seeing you talk without having to restrain your words too much. Same goes for me to be honest. It’s not often I can talk with people and not worry as to whether or not I will see it all plastered across the Daily Prophet the next day.” Potter said, breaking the silence once more.
“Not at all! I’m just happy that Harry feels so comfortable with you that he wanted to invite you. He seems pretty happy about it”. Amelia sat down on the empty chair beside him, brushing off Draco’s worries about the bakery with a “I’m on a break”.
“We should start with this.” Draco handed Hermione one of the ingredients as he made sure to double check the amount needed. One after another the ingredients were measured up and added to the cauldron.
“Couldn’t you wait for one damn second to let me-“ Draco was stopped short by the fact that Potter was not looking at him, but rather behind him. He furrowed his brows as he turned his head slightly.
“It’s a potion Hannah and I have made. It might actually do the trick, but we’re not a hundred percent sure yet. It’s quite experimental, so…”
‘Was this it?’ Draco thought to himself. Was he just going to continue with this life every day until he died? Nothing else? Draco had started to feel the emptiness more and more during the last year as he had moved to his small town and taken over the role as CEO. Most of the meetings was online with people from all around the world, and it had made it possible for him to stay in such a secluded town rather than having to fly around the globe on a daily basis. However, it also meant less time to interact with people, and it had definitely made it difficult to even consider dating.
“By all means.” Harry laughed, and before he could say anything else, Rosie lounged at him. Draco had to catch himself in order to not fall when Harry bumped into him.
“Bed…” Harry mumbled in between kisses, but Draco quickly got the hang of it and let Harry lead him towards the small bedroom.
Harry started slowly pulling out and then pushing back in again. The rhythm was uneven and slow at first, but as he continued the rhythm started steadying more and it got faster.
He let out a surprised gasp as he felt a hand slip underneath his shirt rubbing at the dip of his back. He felt himself clutch onto Harry’s biceps, trying to steady himself. His legs were definitely not to be trusted at this point.
“He’s awake?” Draco knew he was probably asking too many questions, but he couldn’t help it. Something inside of him seemed to tighten uncomfortably at the thought of Potter being hospitalized.
“People like you tend to only show worry when the person you love can’t see it.” Luna continued, obviously on a warpath to destroy Draco’s whole reputation right in front of the one person he knew would use it against him.
“Yes, she’s already made quite some good changes to better the relationships between various creatures as well as getting rid of some truly bad corruption within the ministry. She’s hardworking for sure.” Potter laughed, and Draco wondered if he too truly believed in Pansy’s changed views.
He was at this point clinging to his umbrella with all his might, as he first now realised just how stupid he had been for believing he could walk through this terrible weather.
“Not at all! I know you’re a strong wizard, so I’m confident you’ll make it happen. Getting it on the first try is almost impossible, you know.”
Draco eyed him carefully for a moment. It was hard to believe that the boy who lived would be wanting him of all people. But somehow the look in Potter’s eyes did make a heated feeling wash over Draco as he felt wanted.
“You’ve really lost it, Granger! The smartest witch of our time and you end up being crazy, isn’t that great!” Draco hadn’t realised that he was now standing, Granger only leaned back in her chair and arched an eyebrow at his outburst. “There is no way I’ll ever ask Potter out, even if he was the last person left on the planet!” Draco sneered as he briskly left the office.
“It looks good” Draco said almost unconsciously. The pastries were definitely nice looking and it was almost a shame to eat something that looked this pretty, he thought.
“No! I too, I mean…” Harry scrambled for the words for a second before smiling down at him warmly. “I love you too.”
“Are you serious? I… Oh… “ Draco didn’t know what to say. He had completely forgotten about presents, and frankly, he hadn’t expected that he would get any.
Pansy looked both excited and worried as she stood up and looked at him. Not sharing his uncertainty.
Draco stopped his writing for a moment and looked at it. Well… it doesn’t mean I’m in love or anything, Draco thought. Yes, Harry’s personality was the kind you would easily be drawn in by because he was thoughtful and kind to everyone around him. He always listed well to anything you told him and he was great at cheering Draco up.
Draco came to the conclusion that Pansy was being a freaking work hazard. If this was how she was gonna behave, then he might actually consider banning her from the brewing room.
“Not only that, but in order to create a better unity between you all, each dorm room will be shared between two people from different houses.” As McGonagall said this, hushed groans could be heard. “You will not be given a curfew as I expect you are all grown up enough to be held accountable for your own actions. There will be a head of house though, which will help if any issues arise.” Everyone went silent again as McGonagall’s strict voice quieted the disagreement uttered by some of the students.
“Yes, and it wasn’t a bad experience. They’ll be able to give you the right help and guidance to deal with what you’ve been through.” The way Harry spoke so tenderly, made Draco feel a sting in his heart. Harry truly only wanted to help him. Not out of pity or to get something out of it, no… Just out of understanding as to what he had gone through.
It took Draco a moment to take in everything Blaise had said so far, and it was difficult to process it all. Draco felt himself shrink back as he had no clever reply to any of it. Instead he settled on a defensive stance.
Both Draco and Harry sat down on the couch and looked expectantly at Hermione as she pulled out two vials from a small box and placed it in front of them.
He gazed at Potter who were noticeably not looking at the shelf. Instead he was scanning Draco’s face for God knows what, and Draco felt his stomach turn at the thought of being caught red handed. The vial he had snatched wasn’t part of any of the ingredients, and frankly Draco couldn’t know for sure whether or not Potter had paid enough attention to notice that.
Somehow, the nightmares had already greatly subsided just from having Harry by his side. Waking up in the middle of the night and seeing Harry Potter sleeping next to him had made it easier to calm down. The feeling of warmth and protection was something he hadn’t realised he sorely needed.
As Draco tried to refocus on finding the hint of gold in the air, he suddenly saw Potter speed up. For a second he wanted to follow, thinking Potter had seen the snitch. But he soon realised that Potter was steering straight towards him at an incredible speed that only his broom could muster.
Draco lifted an eyebrow, unable to hide the smirk that crept onto his lips. His legs were already on each side of Harry’s hips, and he crossed them trapping Harry in-between.
Harry looked absolutely stunning as his strong arms gripped Draco’s waist, readying himself in front of his hole. His hair was dishevelled and the green in his eyes had turned darker with lust. Draco felt the tip of Harry’s cock probe his hole carefully a few times before it pushed through.
Almost everyone was asleep and only Granger and Longbottom was still present in the common room. Draco had made a note of position himself at the furthest distance from Potter and his group whenever he spent time in the common room.
“No, no! I’m being completely serious here, Draco. The guy looks fine as hell these days. I caught a peek of him a few weeks back and that Auror uniform is really giving you a good view.”
After first spreading it all over, Draco started properly working it into the hair. The potion didn’t make the hair wet or anything, but rather just attached to it without one being able to properly feel it there.
Harry smiled warmly and kissed Draco once more “I love you” he said as he pushed forward making Draco fall back onto the couch with Harry hovering over him.
“He got sent to St. Mungo’s right after we got back. He’s alright for the most of it, but they wanted to keep him there for observation for a while. I’m headed over once I’m done here.”
“I can’t believe you live here” Harry started inspecting the chandelier that was towering over the large dining table.
“It’s… Er… I didn’t know.” The fact that Potter had still not made a run for it was a sign of his good grace, or perhaps it was just the curse of them being stuck together that did it.
“You and Potter. Quite an intimate moment, I must say.” If Draco’s eyes must’ve been comically big as he tried to comprehend what Blaise was saying.
“Hermione and Ron have agreed to host the New Year Eve party at their flat, so you’ll have something to look forward to through this stressful week”. Draco almost didn’t catch the quick twitch in Amelia’s lip, showing a small smirk before it was promptly replaced by a big smile.
Draco couldn’t help but smile at that. He had always known the Weasley’s were notorious for going all in when they either liked or disliked someone. Having been on the receiving end of dislike for so many years, it felt refreshing to be able to converse without the presence of hostility between them.
The walk home was peaceful for Draco. It was already dark, but the path was lit up by the white snow and the beautiful old streetlights shining a warm yellow light down at him.
That was until Pansy had flooed him late the other day to tell him she was sick and probably wouldn’t make it the next day. Draco had tried persuading her with various ‘feel better’ potions, but she had told him she had already chugged a potion that would make sure she was healthy again the day after tomorrow. Draco tried reasoning that he should come over to help her, and that the shop could be closed for one day.
Harry continued kissing him down to the collarbone, before moving to his nipples. A small gasp left Draco’s mouth as he felt a wet tongue swipe over his left nipple and a hand reach out to pinch his right one. Harry continued sucking and kissing his nipples changing between them and pinching them, making Draco squirm beneath him. If there was anything else Draco could take from this, then at least he now knew his nipples were far more sensitive than he’d thought.
“This.” She held up the last vial that Draco had used to mix into the rest of the ingredients. “It’s not the midnight blue.” Draco frowned as he went over to inspect it. “How do you know? It looks exactly like it.”
Draco could feel the air crackle around him. It was Harry’s magic. Everyone seemed to hesitate for a moment as they too felt the power and realised they were emitting from the boy who lived. Before the Death Eaters could escape, a blast of magic exploded from Potter sending half of them flying backwards and their wands ripped from their hands.
Draco sat down in the chair besides the bed and against his better judgement carefully slipped his hand into Potter’s.
He turned on the water and couldn’t help but feel relaxed as he felt the hot water on his body. He hadn’t even realised just how cold he had been. It would’ve probably made him sick if he hadn’t taken a shower at this point, he thought.
A few days later and Draco was making his way over to the bakery. He opened the door and was greeted by a room bustling with customers. It seemed like a lot of the customers were taking a trip to the bakery in the few days before Christmas.
He paced back and forth for a moment trying to figure out just what exactly had happened. Was it a spell? Had someone broken into their room during the night and hexed them? He figured it could be possible considering how many hated him, but why would anyone want to do something like that towards Potter? He was still viewed as a hero by most people, especially the students at Hogwarts.
But the plan was made, and it was their one chance to get all the remaining Death Eaters and put them in Azkaban once and for all.
“Of course you’re not my responsibility. That’s why I simply changed the wards but didn’t go out looking for you. Now I’m quite regretting that decision, as we probably could’ve stumbled upon those remaining Death Eaters that way.”
Draco was just about to close up shop when he heard the jingle sound of the door opening and the sounds of the thundering storm outside could be heard loudly through the empty room.
“It’s such a waste though. He’s turned into such a fine man with a stable job, a good income, and a big house. Yet, he can’t share his life with anybody. Of course, Ron and I do our best to not make him feel left out, but it’s not always easy when we have a kid and one on the way and everything. I hate it when we have too little time to spare for him. I just wished he could have a family of his own. Even if it’s just one other person, I think it would be enough. He’s so loving and caring towards us, I just… I wish he was able to give that love and trust to someone who’s able to give back just as much.”
Draco just stood there, astonished at the fact that Potter, the boy who lived and his school rival was telling him he liked him.
Draco felt himself grow more annoyed by the minute as Potter was still showing concern, even when he had purposely hit a nerve to avoid the subject at hand.
Weasley’s mouth was hanging open his eyes wide at Potter’s casual reply, obviously not believing his own ears. Sure enough, Potter was most likely just having fun and adding to the whole drama, but Draco couldn’t help but mimic Weasley’s shock for a split second before quickly covering it up.
Yes, in the beginning it had been fun, going to parties all around the country and hanging out with people non-stop. But when the time had come for him to seriously step into the company and work towards becoming the new CEO, he had realised how difficult it could actually be.
“I see nothing have changed.” Draco huffed, and Granger had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle her laughter.
“You’re rather quiet, it’s making me worried about what you might’ve gotten yourself into.” Granger suddenly said, as she picked up her pace in order to walk beside him.
“I never noticed you being bad at charms or DADA…” Potter said thoughtfully. Again, Draco did not dare to look at the guy, as he knew his cheeks were starting to get red.
Once again, he allowed his eyes to close as he felt Potter’s lips on his neck once more, tracing down his collarbone. A shiver ran up his spine as he felt Potter’s hand trace his abdomen with such a light touch it was barely there.
“I know… And I’m thankful that you want to help, but I’m fine, I promise. Everyone’s been through a ton of shit these last few years, and everyone is dealing with it.” Draco said, taking a long sip of his hot chocolate, signalling the end of the converesation.
I got it! Draco thought to himself as he got out a sheet of paper and decided to write a list of things that made him like Harry just in general. And then he would be able to see whether or not those things would be more romantic or more friendly.
The weather was only getting worse, but the reminder of the calm and warm atmosphere at the bakery made Draco take a bold decision.
“Hey guys!” Hermione was red in the cheeks and only a fraction of her hair was still left in her ponytail.
He felt dizzy as he heard the ruckus around him fade in and out. He was going to die here. Just for the ridiculous promise of a small addition to his scrawny wealth. He had nothing after the war, his mother was scraping by trying her best to keep the manor, but her attempts were futile. Draco had made the decision himself, not telling his mother anything as he had darted through Knockturn alley to find a contact that wanted to buy illegal potions. He knew the risks, of course he did, he wasn’t stupid. But he had nothing, he could offer his mother nothing, and when he had no longer been able to take it, when his mother had received an owl telling her she would have to pay the lease before the end of the month or it would be taken from her, Draco hadn’t seen a choice. Even if it was the last thing he did, he wanted to make sure she was cared for. She had been the reason as to why he had managed to get back on his feet, she had soothed him as he woke screaming his lungs out from another nightmare for the umpteenth time. She was all he had left.
“No, a bit more-“ Once again, Draco could barely breathe out the words as Harry hit the spot. “Yes!” He gasped.
“But when I barged into Potter’s office, I definitely interrupted the two of you.” Granger said, making Draco horrified at what exactly she thought she had been interrupting at that time.
“Do you have a minute?” He asked, trying to sound casual. “Yeah, sure! What is it?” Granger asked, and Draco noticed how Weasley had also started paying attention to the conversation now.
“So? How are you feeling?” Draco couldn’t help but be a bit impatient as to whether the potion would work in this certain case.
“That’s…” Granger scrutinized him like she had already done a couple of times by now. “You certainly sound like Malfoy.”
Draco could only gape at Pansy as he couldn’t believe what she was saying. He was too worried on whether or not Potter had analysed the words thoroughly and realised the double-meaning or brushed it off as the old, dated version of calling someone cheery. Pansy, however, did not seem to share his concerns as she turned her focus to Potter and continued speaking, her tone nonchalant.
“Well, you didn’t get the Patronus showing, that’s true. But I felt your magic as you tried it, and it’s definitely something there. Just needs a bit more practice, I think.”
“Er…Hermione?” Draco felt weird as he spoke her name for the first time in his life. It had always been Granger, or mudblood. Although after the war, the word mudblood was no longer something that could be uttered, nor did he desire to do so. It was part of his father’s control over him, teaching him from such an early age to discriminate against those who were not favoured by you-know-who. Granger had been one of the reasons as to why Voldemort had lost, and the world saved. For that, he was grateful.
“But it’s closing in on Christmas now, will you be able to take some days of for it?” Harry placed two cups of coffee on the table in front of them. The dinner had been amazing as always, and just hanging out and relaxing like this was making life much easier for Draco.
He had been cutting the chocolate, and as Harry moved over to his side, he gently put a hand on his lower back as he was about to instruct him. This had made Draco jump and drop the knife.
Draco waited for a bit longer this time before going over to the ingredient room. He felt his nerves getting a hold of him as he looked around at the various ingredients stacked neatly in each shelf. He started picking out what he needed, while keeping an eye out for someone watching him.
The smile on Pansy’s face turned into a frown as she pondered her own words, disregarding Draco’s statement. “Although then he would probably just be there whenever I’m not, and we can’t have that.”
Perhaps it was the faint crackling of a fireplace slowly quieting down, or the feeling of not being all alone in a giant villa, but Draco slept better than he had in what felt like forever.
‘Great!’ Draco thought to himself. Leave it to the boy wonder to instantly figure out a situation despite being thrown off his game by whatever the hell was happening. Well, chalk it up to his Head Auror position, Draco sighed. Yes, he might have stumbled upon the prophecy once or twice and it had been hard not to notice the glaring headlines ‘New Head Auror – Our very own saviour!’ and the picture of a grinning Harry Potter shaking hands with the Minister of Magic who was none other than Hermione Granger herself. That hadn’t particularly surprised Draco. Begrudgingly he had to admit that there probably did not currently exist any other witch or wizard capable of competing with the brightness of Granger’s mind.
“This… I…” Draco stuttered “I… I don’t know… what to do” he was feeling embarrassed as he felt so vulnerable, but at the same time the dominant side of Harry was making him feel aroused.
“I totally forgot you two were coming over today, or else I would’ve…” Potter started, but was interrupted by the Weasley girl. “Or you would’ve what?” She looked at him in disbelief. “Tell us not to come, because you’re having a breakfast date? With MALFOY??” Her voice was filled with accusation and perhaps quite a bit of denial.
He tried to look inconspicuous as he drifted towards the right. Perhaps he could manage to get by if he made a run for it. But he wasn’t able to get far before one of the Death Eaters picked up on his behaviour.
The weeknights were mostly spent with both of them cuddling and falling asleep in each other’s arms.
“You’ve liked me… for years?” Potter looked to be in disbelief, and Draco could hardly blame him for it. How odd wouldn’t it be to suddenly get to know that your lifelong rival had been secretly yearning for you behind the mask of arrogance and insults.
“Sorry for not being here at that time. I was sadly ill at home.” Pansy actually looked truly disheartened, which probably stemmed from the lack of seeing Draco’s flustered side and the image of him hiding behind the counter like an idiot.
Potter and Draco sat awkwardly opposite of the two girls as they processed the information given to them.
“Yeah, so hurry up and tell me if it’s a ferret or not!” Pansy laughed, and Draco felt both annoyed at his two friends for making bets about it, but also slightly relieved that his Patronus hadn’t actually turned out to be a bloody ferret. Potter would’ve had the time of his life had that been the case.
Harry started paying more attention to Draco’s expressions and just by doing small gestures like holding his hand or feeding him, Draco’s cheeks would turn a dark red, and he would be looking everywhere other than at Harry himself.
His trousers and underwear were slowly dragged down, freeing his already hard erection from its confined space. Draco felt himself moan as the air touched his bared cock.
“You tell anyone, I’ll hex you into oblivion, Potter.” Draco huffed out, hiding his face under his arm.
“I know that this time it looked rather bad, but I can assure you-“ Draco was cut off before he could properly explain himself. “You don’t have to make excuses, Malfoy. I don’t judge, and if you and Harry want to keep it a secret that’s fine. I won’t tell anybody, and I’ve already told Ron it was a misunderstanding.”
“Even if we don’t, I still have eyes. Only a fool would underestimate her talents.” Draco said, belatedly realising how much of a praise that sounded like.
“You… I… I want you to…” If he had been less of a mess, Draco would’ve cursed himself for being as inarticulate as he currently was.
There it was. It had taken two and a half weeks for Potter to even mention the issue at hand. Draco grabbed the end of the counter and pushed himself off. “I’ll get the table ready.”
Everything felt so fulfilled in his life. It was like he had finally managed to find the happiness he was always searching for.
“Oh my god!” Hermione looked frantic as she could only stand and watch the events unfold in front of her eyes.
“Then there’s gotta be a reasonable explanation for all this.” Potter said with a thoughtful expression. “We should try asking Hermione for help.”
“Hey! What exactly did I do this time?” If it wasn’t for the fact that Draco was pissed off, he would’ve almost found it amusing that Potter was so accustomed to getting into trouble that he added ‘this time’ to the end of it. However, the fact that it was indeed Potter’s fault, made him furious.
“No need for sarcasm. Potter and I are getting along quite well, and I would hate to miss the opportunity to be around him whenever he visits the shop.” Pansy said before taking a long sip of her wine. “How did the lesson go today?”
“I wasn’t paying enough attention to what you were saying. My mind was still focused on work and I might’ve misinterpreted what you were hinting at. In all fairness, I had no idea you even thought that me dating Potter could be a possibility.”
“If you want to learn it, I can teach you.” Potter’s words sounded almost foreign to Draco as they were spoken. Why in the world would Harry Potter want to help him of all people?
“Oh, well…” Draco didn’t know what to say. Sure, it was nice to hear that Potter liked his shop so much, but he hated feeling indebted to people.
“I brought you some headache potion. I tried making it taste like treacle tart but ended up with strawberry instead.” Draco felt himself chuckle lightly at that. “Sorry ’bout that.”
They bid their goodbyes after Granger had stocked up on the left-over vials of the potion. But just as Weasley headed out the door, Granger grabbed Draco’s arm and said in a hushed voice.
Was he, after all this, just going to say his goodbyes and go into hiding again? He felt sweat start to form on his palms as he clasped them together tightly.
“If you’re helping her, then please let me in on it too.” Blaise said as he scurried closer to the other two.
Soon thought… Draco thought, he hoped to be able to go the final step. He had started becoming more and more interested with the slow change from feeling weird having something shoved into him to it actually starting to feel good.
“Fancy a look?” The cheeky grin on Potter’s face was infuriating just as it had been during the match. But once again, Draco didn’t react the way he wanted to, and instead he felt heat rise to his cheeks as he fumbled for his words.
“Then do you want to sleep in my room?” Harry was a bit hesitant with his question, obviously checking the reaction of Draco.
“Right.” Hermione said solemnly. “It might look like his life is easier than it actually is. I always feared what might happen to him in the long run, having people constantly invading his personal space.” She looked troubled as she spoke.
The whole way to class, Granger had barely breathed as she continuously kept on rambling about the various homework loads that they should be working on and so on. Draco knew she was trying to win as much time as possible before she was forced to let Draco interact with Weasley.
Draco halted his movements slightly, before waving his wand at the concoction, leaving it to brew for a while. He finally looked up to meet Potter’s gaze, which was still firmly on him like it had been from the start, however the mocking expression Draco had expected to see was nowhere to be found. Instead he just looked, quite honestly, fascinated.
The rest of the week went by slowly, being overloaded with homework and having to cram for their N.E.W.T.s. everyone seemed miserable.
Although it was just on the other side of the road, he took on the way home, Draco had never really stopped to look at it before. Same as the other stores a bit further ahead, this small bakery was warm and welcoming as it was standing there glittering in the sun.
“I was just caught off guard when I turned around and your hair was back to its normal state of horrendous untidiness. Something like that would scare anyone.” Draco huffed, trying to save his grace just a little bit at least.
“I see… Right after the war it was the worst. The nightmares kept me awake relentlessly, and I could go for days with barely any sleep.” Harry shifted a bit there he sat on his bed. “It wasn’t until Hermione started to beg me to get help that I finally managed to reach out to someone with expertise on this.”
“That’s rubbish! The only places worthy to look for quidditch gear is Quality Quidditch Supplies or the Purple Snitch.” Draco blurted out in a mocking tone.
“How about being a bit more careful next time? There’s a limit to how foolhardy one can be, even for you, Potter.” Draco stood up and rounded the desk to grab some of his tools.
“So, this does not affect you at all?” Potter quirked an eyebrow, which did affect Draco more than he liked.
“It was nothing really. I’ve had another similar case before, luckily, so I knew what I needed to do. I’m just glad it worked so well.” Draco said, trying not to show how much it meant that both Granger and Weasley seemed to not hold an unyielding grudge towards him.
‘Perfect’ Draco thought, as he swiftly got hold of a particular vial and stored it in his pocket. He continued browsing the last ingredients making sure to keep a composed look on his face before going back.
“You coming to bed?” Draco was torn away from his reading as he heard Harry’s voice. He was leaning against the doorframe with hair still wet from the shower.
Draco felt a laugh slip out of him before he could stop it. Hermione giggled a bit before starting to laugh herself. “They have absolutely no sense of danger!” She added as she laughed harder.
“Is it alright to sleep in my room? I don’t snore, so I won’t keep you awake” Harry joked as he headed towards the bedroom.
“What do you think will happen if the headmistress finds out about this?” Granger looked at them sternly.
With that Draco felt his legs being hoisted up and a pillow positioned underneath his ass. His heart started beating rapidly as he was watching his fantasies come to life right in front of him.
“God damn it.” Draco felt himself almost tearing up from the embarrassment of not having any control over his own body anymore.
“Hey! Sorry, it’s been really busy today. Do you want to wait for me to close up and then have some coffee at my place?” Harry asked as he came over to Draco’s table.
“What are you doing?” Draco looked baffled at Harry when he finally tore himself from the passionate kiss.
Draco wanted to say something, he wanted to scowl at Potter’s grinning face. But he was left speechless. His mouth slightly open from the shock and his eyes unable to look away from Potter’s own green ones.
“Please what?” Draco wanted to roll his eyes at Potter’s audacity, but at this point it was difficult to do much more than stutter out more demands. “Harry…Please… Ah- fuck me!”
“Hi, Parkinson. Yeah, it’s been a few years now. I had no idea it was you I was contacting when I asked for an appointment last time.”
“That’s quite remarkable indeed.” Draco said, a bit lost in thought as he couldn’t help but wonder how the others were doing.
Only a week had passed before Potter for the second time trotted through the door of the little potion shop.
“Oh… Uh… Yeah, I hope I’m not intruding” Draco felt a bit awkward as he hadn’t fully thought about the possibility that Amelia wouldn’t like the idea of having him join in on their Christmas party.
Draco scooped up a big handful of the potion, careful not to drop it. Getting it on your clothes would change their colours into the most horrendous orange one could dream of. That was a personal knowledge Draco had.
“Alright… I’ll let it go for now. But please tell me if you need to talk to anyone.” Pansy said with a small smile that tried to relate some kind of understanding to his situation. Draco returned the smile, knowing full well that his problems would stay with him alone.
“Heh…” Draco chuckled at the offer “I’m not really into guys though… or at least I don’t think so. I just like Harry, that’s all” He finished.
Harry managed a small laugh before his mouth was once again covered by Draco’s. He put his hand back on Draco’s waist and with the other one grabbed a fistful of blond hair and tried to pull back, but Draco wasn’t having it. He had been waiting so damn long to kiss those glorious lips, and he wasn’t about to let go of his prey that easily.
“Hey, how about a deal?” Suddenly Harry’s eyes were on Draco and he looked much more interested than he had a minute ago. “I’m listening.”
It was nice to feel the steady rise and fall of another person’s breathing, and the warmth from Harry’s body on his. Draco noted how when he was this close to Harry, he had this protective atmosphere about him. It made it easy to fall into a dreamless sleep.
This time around they were joined by Pansy, and Draco was glad that Potter decided to chat rather than work on the Patronus while she was there. He could barely handle being alone with Potter during the lessons. There was no way he would be able to handle having Pansy intently watching them, leering at him and concocting some evil master plan. She would probably come up with some unbelievable scheme where she insisted that a kiss from Potter would be the best way to get the spell working, and how she had read all about it in some extremely credited book with a strange, obnoxiously long Latin name. Draco actually wouldn’t put it beneath her to try something insane like that.
“You’re wild, Malfoy.” Draco was, if not even more so, intently focusing on Harry’s lips as they were now slightly swollen and cherry red from the intense kissing session.
Was he really going to have to walk all the way back home in this weather? He had decided to hurry over to the bakery and stay there until the stormy weather subsided a bit, but now he suddenly had no other choice than to try and walk through it.
“Oh! Then I’m sure she’ll like these” Harry pointed to one of the very delicious pastries in front of him “It’s a puff pastry blueberry version”.
“Oh boy…” Pansy muttered as she nervously tucked a loose strand behind her ear. “Are you going to be alright?” She whispered to him. “Huh?” Draco furrowed his brows at her, not having paid much attention until his name was called. He had been too lost in thoughts.
“Say what?” Draco furrowed his brows trying to decipher whatever it was that his two friends were up to.
know what’s going on!” Draco barked out as he started looking around the room trying to find something that could give some sort of explanation.
“And I see you’re just as stuck up as ever, despite it all.” Potter’s voice was levelled as he regarded Draco with a frown. Draco had momentarily forgotten just how much ammunition Potter held over him regardless of how many years were to pass by.
Draco couldn’t help but enjoy the pleasure. He had no idea that he would be this sensitive. Considering the fact that he had never been in a relationship before, he was on unknown territory.
Potter frowned at him and had a serious tone as he continued talking. “Well, we don’t have the best of relations, so I didn’t want to risk being at the receiving end of whatever you were concocting.”
“That’s true…” Draco murmured as he also managed to calm his laughing. It had been an exhilarating feeling to finally have a proper laugh with someone.
“It was disturbing, I think Malfoy is trying to befriend me, but he’s Malfoy so surely that’s impossible.” Sure enough, there wasn’t any reason as to why Draco would even contemplate befriending Weasley that easily.
After putting the paste on Weasley’s shoulder, he was coerced into another round of wizarding chess as Weasley so eloquently stated “It helps me calm down, so I won’t just be sitting here worrying.”
He felt his hole clench and unclench, and it didn’t take long before Harry was driven over the edge as well, shooting into him with such force that Draco moaned at the feeling.
“Are you not in possession of a house elf, Potter?” Draco said, curiously following Potter’s cooking. He had always had house elf’s do the cooking at the manor. It had become a bit of an issue once he came back from France and no longer had a house elf to rely on for food. Luckily, his mother had taught him a few simple spells to get him started, but mostly he just got store-bought instead of making it himself. And here the Great Harry Potter was making food without the use of magic, as if it wasn’t scandalous at all.
