(See the end of the chapter for
He only realized too late what he had done as his head was already buried in the crook of the blonde's soft neck, Draco's arms still raised from his previous grip on the Gryffindor's wrists.
She was especially paranoid about Draco after the Hippogriff incident at 3rd year, and now that they were in a 'relationship' which really just meant Pansy liked him and Draco put up with it for the sake of his title.
"Hermione! You can't
Harry didn't really know, but he was going to do what he could to find out...
"Y-Y-Yeah, You're, You're not yourself let's get you to the Hospital Wing wai-- Oh Fuck" Potter cursed softly as he remembered the door was not charmed to open until 10:15 pm. He looked at the clock on the wall.
Malfoy!!" Yelled Ron
"Pansy! Did you hear me!? Where's Draco?" Blaise Zambini asked his companion again.
Dobby smiled warmly as he said it before snapping his fingers and disappearing.
She blinked away the stinging of her eyes as she got up and ordered them to follow her. She could only hope the two of them had enough time in their hands
The blonde boy jolted up again and almost fell of his bed, last minute pulling himself up and avoiding further harm to his well-being. He didn't know if he wanted to thank the gods or curse them when his gaze fell on his right, his face going three tones closer to red.
He got closer and closer, till he was standing next to the lying boy, the covers shifting alongside his breathing.
"DON'T FUCKING TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!!!! IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SUCH AN ASSHOLE ALL THOSE YEARS TO ME AND MY FRIENDS, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE AT ALL!!!!!!" Potter screamed as he walked closed, now the desk the blonde was leaning on falling on the floor and breaking and the blackboard hanging on a nearby wall trembling as the screws holding it there went flying off.
"Harry I Know You're Under A Lot Of Pressure, But That Doesn't Mean You Get To Take It Out On Me When I'm Just Trying To Help You. Is Fighting With One Best Friend And That Blond Idiot Not Enough For You!? You Want To Push Me Away Too Harry!?" Hermione snapped at him, not bothering to keep her voice down at all before she stood up and left the Great Hall, not even caring to take her bag with her.
"Th-Thankyou, can, can I askyou something H-Harry?..."
Harry said mindlessly as he felt like his skin was on fire under his best friend's gaze.
Harry returned the favour by using his torso to push the blonde to the right, the brunette now between his legs trying to choke the other, by now both their robes only straddling their arms.
The blonde started,e though he could feel his throat starting to burn again and his breath getting heavier he continued
As Harry reached Griffindor tower, he couldn't fall asleep. All he could think about was Draco and after what felt like hours he managed to fall asleep
"O-Oh hey P-Potter''
Well, at least he's safe with Madam Pomfrey, but he must be really bored sitting there all day
I'll try to upload once a week. For today, here's the 2nd chapte! Hope you enjoy! :)
Harry was ready to attack Zabini, because he couldn't just let Malfoy just take that and Draco seemed to have picked that up because he held the Griffindor's arm
How could he even *try* to look at Pansy the same way as Father wanted him to? Or anyone else really when there was Potter, with his stupid bravery and his stupid hair and his stupid eyes and his stupid abilities at Quidditch and his stupid Quidditch robes that suit him like a glove and his stupid laugh and his stupid everything, and, just Ngghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Dobby, I need you to tell me the truth. Were you spying on me for someone Dobby?" Harry said sternly. Dobby probably didn't want to do him harm, but he was often naive to people's intentions.
What in Merlin's beard had gotten into him!? If there were spectators he could kinda justify his behaviour, but to just start a fight from nothing?
Hermione blinked a few times at him before she nodded in approval. There was no way that excuse was legitimate but she'd let it pass for the moment.
at Harry.
The brunette carefully walked closer to the Slytherin, his staring at him occasionally stopping to glance at the Medi-Witch.
Harry could smile if he didn't want to look suspicious. Still, the corners of his mouth twitched up rebellious to his intentions. It was rather fun that McGonagall was exposing Malfoy now, and Harry could see from how his teeth were grinding ever so slightly that he was not happy about that.
If Harry had decided to leave and run away. Then something had to have happened something had to be wrong. Draco k ew Harry somehow much me going through some kind of bad hurt or was scared of something.
He felt himself get close as he watched her facial expressions.
But then Draco gives the answer..
"You filthy mudblood dare to come into my house with your filthy blood and interfere in my family business." He roars.
Harry sighed and left Ana to her tantrum as he tries to out smart his quick footed son. Harry finally manages to snag him and wrestle at least a diaper onto his bum before the boy kicks him and starts running wild again.
Hermione perked up..
The Giant's hut possibly crying over Harry's disappearance. Or maybe in the library?
Draco then looks at Harry...
"But of course, i mean if I can get Draco to like me, then you can do the same with pansy im sure."
He sits in a chair beside the bed touching Draco's arm whispering in his ears, begging him to wake up every now and then. Kissing his forehead as he sat there.
"But they're good for you, and healthy meats, if I cooked them you'd probably like them." Harry tried.
He hears his father scream as blood erupted everywhere, and turns on Draco, and sends a blasting curse towards Draco sending him crashing into the wall again.
Hermione was once again pregnant as she was walking with her daughter to Ollivanders, Borgin and Burks, Madam Malkins  and all.
Hermione speaks first.. "my parents are muggles, and supportive..of my decisions, if you are willing to accept company Id love to go with you."
Draco then drops his robes, and as soon as Harry drops his Draco pressed lips against his, thrusting two well lubed fingers inside Harry.
Severus left the room,  with the others and the nurse gave Harry a pain potion before walking out to do her rounds.
Hermione and Neville opened the door already dressed and holding wands.
But Draco was getting nowhere with Lucius, his father was simply much more experienced than him at magic.
Neville sank into the chair.
He then licks and kisses over Harry's belly. His tongue soon finds Harry's dick..and his tongue teases at the bow before using his hands to spread Harry's ass cheeks.
Harry throws his head back clearly enjoying the sensations Draco was delivering.
“He’s treating me just fine Harry, he’s so sweet honestly. He really loves to please me. I was really worried when I got paired with him, he’d be to sensitive and scared to want anything to do with my kinks, but honestly he loves them.”
Neville Longbottom
Lucius stepped towards the four, pointing his wand at them.
"Lucius, your father has him...I know cause I helped him carry him to his dungeon." Atticus responded.
Today is Thanksgiving..Im submitting to you..i want you to make me yours..and make Me your Thanksgiving Turkey."
Shacklebolt sat down as a silence washed over the Graduates and their families in shock. The only sound being the scratching of quills against parchment.
Tears of relief started to stream down Harry's face as he touched his face.
“There you are Celine, your such a strong little girl.” Neville breathed looking over Hermione’s shoulder.
Had his new husband suddenly decided he didn't want to be married to him? Maybe had been plotting it all along.
Both of their eyes widen in surpise and then acceptance.
Harry goes to the bed that sat there and stripped himself naked.
"Ok good, now I want you to strip naked, and kneel on the floor, eyes cast down."
Harry then lays there completely restrained and waits nervously as the clock ticks.
He slowly starts pumping his finger into her, first with one finger then with two. Almost going crazy with need as he feels her body grow warm and wet for him. She was so tight around his fingers. He felt his dick swell with need.
By the time he got to the room, Harry has stopped throwing up and was now holding his wand in his hand, and it was glowing blue.
"Who? Who has him?" Draco demands
In another corner there was a small counter where a rosey cheeked pudgy old lady was selling baked  treats and Delicious smelling beverages where even from the door way Draco could smell incense of Nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger.
Draco looks at Harry in shock and guilt filled his heart as he listens to Harry.
Harry shivers under him enjoying the sight of  Draco liking blood droplets from his nipples.
It was the night of the dance, Harry had been bored and not having fun so he'd told Ron he was headed up to bed.
He heard loud voices, as people came running to his side..
"You saved me." Harry whispers to Draco.
Finally Draco tossed the flogger to the floor breathing hard.
Where was Harry? Surely he'd found the water by now? Draco started to debate wither he should go look for him.
You both were in very critical condition. But so far only have shown signs of waking up.
Did something happen to him?
"Absolutely not " Draco flatly retorted.
The bed had cuffs on all four bedposts. A gag on the dresser. There was a coat rack full of different ugly looking sexual tools.
The two ended up in bed, making love for the first time since the quad had been born. Their lives had been so busy with the four of them, they had hardly had any time to spend with each other. Now that they were alone again, they decided they would take the time to go on dates again, and work on spending the extra time on each other to keep their relationship alive.
“Your pregnant again?” Draco whispers.
The boat was magnificent, truly a sight to behold. It was Silver and gold with the head of a gold swordfish. And it was huge..gigantic.
When food was cleared Draco strips Harry of his clothes again and they tumble back into the bed.
The pups were golden yellow retrievers. Harry named one Growler, while Draco named his pup Dinky cause of the way it waddled cause it was fatter than the other pup.
He had no idea where it came from.
Draco looks up before Harry had a chance to duck down his head.
Harry was on edge full of nerves then hears footsteps walking into the room. And then the person coming in gives a gasp of shock.
What was in the Cauldron and what was it for? He wondered.
Harry nervously wondered where they were being taken, as the goblet continued to send out matches one by one.
Harry grins "im so lucky to have yall as my best friends."
"How did you know?" Draco asked.
Hermione was not a virgin. A fact Neville knew after walking in on her and Krum in the broom closet.
Harry grinned “Actually I have another idea in mind. I was planning on asking you to be my kids’ Godfather, and I’m going to ask Hermione to be their Godmother, I want my children to have both.”
"What is this Neville?" She asked softly, her voice a bit faint from the shock.
Harry rides slowly at first then curiously tries increasing the speed a bit and gives a louder cry as he feels the pleasure increase.
He Knew Harry had been having a hard time enjoying the holidays ever since his friends had turned their backs on him and decided to shut him out for dating him.
Neville felt sad as he watched Hermione grow from the strong, confident woman he had always known into a woman full of stress and anxiety over their child. It became Neville’s job to be the strong and confident one, and support her as much as he could.
“Wow, quads, I cant believe it.” Harry breathed.
She sits on the couch, shock still fully visible to her, while her new husband was in the kitchen fiddling with the sink after he had taken her hand and led her to the couch.
Then grinning over at his Aunt he shyly he gives her a sly grin “How do you like the feeling of being a Great Aunt to four?” Harry teases.
Draco stood and starts following Harry around trying to get Harry to tell him what was going on, but Harry continues to give him the silent treatment, as Harry collects all the babies laundry and places them in the hamper, cleans the toys off the living room floor and finally does the dishes.
He had no idea what Draco had in mind but Harry sure was feeling a bit hornier then usual.
Returning his attention to the minister he swallowed seeing the paper in the man's hand as he read.
Draco sighed "I understand I will Do what ever it takes to find him."
"Of course I did, nobody takes or touches what is Mine not even my own father."
"Fuck your so tight, so warm in there." He gasped as they moved as one.
Still tossing and turning his thoughts turning into  nightmares all night of being found and sacrificed. Being led like animal to slaughter. He woke feeling gritty and tired as someone taps on his door.
Hermione felt the shock slowly start to fade, she glanced up at Neville, taking the cup in her hands.
Harry paused eying him a moment. He thought about the possibility of a nurse walking in.
Draco looks Harry in the face, and sighed.
Harry blushed at the last sentence. But kissed his cheeks.
Neville pounds her harder until they both erupt together cuming hard.
The blonde looks at Harry in the eye puffing his chest up with pride.
Porter seemed to notice Harry's silence and unvoiced troubled thoughts.
"I want you to help me finish putting these handcuffs on." Harry responded.
The three walk to the parking lot when Ron blurts out.
"Harry Potter" Albus calls softly with a warm undertone.
Harry turns to Draco, takes his hand and whispers.
“Neville, we did it! We don’t need that document! We’re finally pregnant.” Hermione exclaimed.
"I say just be yourself, and be honest and go for it. You're a good, guy and I'm sure she'll see that."
The hall erupted into a loud cheering and clapping.
He pounded him hard and fast both of them crying out softly until Draco and Harry released their essense.
Harry mentally smirks and bobs his mouth in down swirling his tongue as he does.
Lucius returns to the table smirking at Harry then disappears from view.
Bringing it over he slowly drips the hot gravy over Harry's chest.
Harry mentally and physically exhausted slips into an uncomfortable sleep. Trying to prepare himself for whatever Lucius decided to do to him next.
"Come on Harry, drop the Clothes." His voice dominant.
"I'm a Domme, I like my men Submissive." Hermione reveals.
Luna lay on the bed fully naked on the bed as Ron lays beside her. Both were nervous about consummating, but yet neither one of them were feeling any reason to hold off.
The words were the final push Draco need to push them over the edge and together they cum hard again.
This chapter will talk about some of the details of how the law is effecting Hermione and Neville.
“Going to Saint Mongo’s of course, I want to get it confirmed by them.” Harry explained.
Girls:
Harry puts a carton in the cart putting them in the child part of the cart.
Draco was made to wait outside while they worked.
He blushed looking around.
Lucius used a key to pull Harry  free of the chains, and pulls Harry from the room by the hair to another room.
"That's awesome Harry, we will happily help you with the baby when it arrives." The both say together.
"Search the house!" Draco told the other four.
All their things sat in his room packed and ready. So finally with Ana in his lap he sinks into a chair exhausted.
Harry glanced over at Petunia with a grin.
“Dudley? What are you doing here?” Harry asked.
The names finally picked out on a parchment Harry set it aside and falls asleep curled into Draco’s chest.
Mean while Draco was up on the roof of the Hogwarts castle...hes spread a blanket where nobody else would be able to look up and spot them,
"Do not cum until I tell you to." She commanded him.
He then nips and grazes teeth over the nipples drawing blood.
She slides a cock ring over Neville's shaft, forcing it to stand at attention while restricting blood flow to prevent him from having an orgasm until she wants him to.
Then finally Draco starts pounding Harry and soon both were screaming their pleasure together.
"Harry what is it?" Draco demands softly.
To Harry’s surprise he sees Dudley entering the platform, behind him trailed a young woman and three little boys.
Leaving Hogwarts would not be enough.
A bottle of lub sat on a near by rock Draco had placed there.
Draco watched quietly for a while as Harry, fixed the green beans, pulled out the rolls and meatloaf, and set food filled plates on the table.
Harry goes and rents a room for the night. But sleep did not come easily as he tossed and turning replaying Dumbledore's words in his mind like a radio.
Would Draco come to him like Harry asked? Would Draco be turned off by Harry's crazy dark kink? Was Draco even serious about what had been said?
“Well yes he does, he really likes it honestly. He wears the collar I bought him with pride and displays it even in public, he said he loved that I cared enough about him to wanna claim him as mine.” Hermione shrugged.
"Draco wait, not so fast!" Hermione yells as Draco runs ahead of the group.
He heard her moan in pleasure and took that as his cue to start rocking his hips against her, moving slowly.
"That worthless excuse of a mother of yours, choose to help the other side instead of standing with me to help our master..she had to die for that betrayal." Lucius responded.
“What do we do now?” Harry asked Draco.
And when Draco had called Harry his, Harry had gotten horny and hard for him and when Draco spoke of the beast Harry couldn't stop himself from jumping Draco.
And he loved the way she dominated him.
"What?" Draco asked him.
“I’m sorry Draco, for closing you out and not talking to you about the problem. But know no matter how mad I may get at you or how bad we may fight..I will always want you. I will always still love you no matter what.”
Hermione had tried everything from lectures, to grounding to anything she could. She even tried stopping Celina from spending time around Tanner after finding that Tanner was a wild child and had often given her the ideas by daring her to do them.
"Come on Harry let's go watch this Quidditch game." He grinned.
Harry held back a scream. No. He thought to himself he would not yell, he would not cry. He would not give the man that satisfaction.
Harry flushed the toilet and hurries up to their room where he starts grabbing his shoes and robes.
Harry nods "I didnt realize i was into you into last year when Barty crouch jr turned you into a ferret. "
"This meatloaf is amazing!" He exclaimed. "even the food at our school feasts can't compare to this." He added.
Harry puts a bell under Harrys chin.
But after thinking over what happened. He'd come to the conclusion he had no reason to be scared of Draco. If Draco would risk his life for him then he'd never hurt him. The months he'd bathed and cared for him Harry had found the love he'd felt for his husband since childhood fill him up.
Draco was exhausted even as he completes the nursery room, Harry was constantly making him run to the store for some obscure craving that they just happened to not have. Tired as he was Draco never once complained.
The room turned into the graveyard and Vernon transformed into Voldemort, but th4us time there were rows and rows of headstones, each bearing the names of the lives lost during the battle.
When Draco wakes Harry, he groans not really wanting to get out of bed yet.
Harry finally speaks as he's curious to know "why? Why are you using such muggle ways? Why not just use dark magic on me?"
Draco sighed and grins and tries to lighten up the mood "how about we see about some dinner?"
The two of them sit on the couch and grabbing a cup of pumpkin juice. They sip for awhile until Draco finally asks.
"Father, stop! Get away from him."
Once on the roof, he grinned at the view of the grounds.
He pulls him from his mouth and licks him from balls to tip, then back to his balls on the other end, glorying as he felt Draco shiver.
Not caring if he gets in trouble, he snuck out of bed with the last strength he had and climbed into Draco's bed and snuggled up next to him on top the covers.
Harry buys different pastas, and beans and vegetables with a few veggies getting vetoed by Harry when Draco suggests them.
Harry nods.
Draco grabbed his wand he knew who he needed to go interrogate. He needed to go visit a couple of his dad's old death eater buddies.
Harry slides to sleep next to him breathing in his cologne softly as he sleeps.
“I think it’s time.” Harry gasped.
Neville loved how Hermione seemed to be so confident with her body and her actions to do this stuff with him.
He grabbed parchment and pen and scrawled a quick note.
They both shiver with their own pure need for each other.
Harry meanwhile nibbles on a small bit of toast to settle his stomach as the smells of the great hall was churning his stomach.
But the truth was..he couldn't enjoy the dance cause his date was completely all wrong for him.
Draco then kisses and licks over the trail starting at Harry's arms, then his legs.
"Follow me and you'll see." Draco responds leading the way to the stair way that led upwards to the roof top.
The two chatted about quidditch again as they checked the paper for new updates on the teams.
Ron wakes before she does, leaves her a note on the pillow and appearated to Diagon Alley to start searching for him a new job.
She makes Neville kneel on the floor and eat whatever she chose to feed him from her hand.
“I’ll call Sirius, and I’m sure he’ll be free tomorrow for a bit of revenge for that horrible article.”
“What the fuck, man! You can’t just bring out a knife!”
“Yeah, probably. I know you weren’t really listening to most of the room assignments, but her and Pansy are in 2B downstairs.”
“What do you mean, people like you?”
Harry pushed his magic out to open the door for him and padded out back towards Andrews’ office. Once he got there, he smiled at the auror politely and threw some floo powder into the fire, calling out “Tonks Residence!” and stepping into the green flames.
, the pang in his chest that maybe it shouldn’t have felt quite so good.
“Y-yeah, it’s fine, this just happens sometimes.”
mean, and so’s Pansy, but bigotry is just plain wrong. People like Nott, or
“They were running tests Neville, and they discovered I was actually pregnant. It seems that once we stopped trying it decided to happen on it’s own.” Hermione grinned.
Draco threw a punch into the man's face.
"Harry...taken...someone took My Harry!" Draco cries hysterically, full on crying now.
"This carriage will now take you home. Just tell it where to go.* the minister tells them.
He stole the death eaters owl, wrote a quick note and then grabbed the hands of his companions, they popped out of the cabin and to the outskirts of Malfoy Manor.
One by one all students put their names in the cup. Harry's fingers trembled as he put his in, nerves, clenching his stomach as he agonized over which wizards in his graduating class mates could possibly be gay like him.
When she still couldn't move, the cup was taken from her and Neville helps Hermione slowly drink whatever was in the glass.
Hermione perused the daily prophet, going through the employment ads looking for something that would take her qualifications.
Hermione seemed to hesitate. Could see the battle in her eyes. He was a slytherin. His father a death eater. He was a guy not easy to trust. Besides he'd bullied theffm for years. She probably thought he had some crazy mean reason to wanna find Potter. Who would after all these years belive that he Malfoy harbored feelings of the heart for Potter?
Harry looks the blonde in the face. He considered telling him it was nothing but decided that he didn't want to start the marriage by lying.
Blinded with pain Harry flinched as he heard a loud crash of something ramming through the door.
Back at home, Harry found himself for the first time unable to decide on what to do with himself. With no kids to run after, there was also no messes to clean up. Their entire routine was now up turned.
Draco walks out without even apologizing to him. His only concern and priority was finding Harry.
The whip had a metallic like rope and on the end there was a metal claw designed to rip through the flesh of its victim.
On the ground was one of Harry's shoes, and the bucket he'd been carrying. And on the ground there was a small puddle of red.
Draco finally concentrates on the task. And finally after days of trying and three more hours.
Harry cries out in pleasured shock. Harry's senses were inflamed with pure need. Draco gently finger fucks Harry listening to the dark haired boy moan in pleasure for him.
They heard footsteps down the hall.
Ron’s mouth fell open “What really? Four? Your carrying four at once?”
The sounds he made spurred her on. She had decided to keep it light for now until he gets used to being dominated.
"Advra..kad.."
It hurt.. Harry thought.
She watched as Neville hesitated at first.
"No tell me what you want..tell me what you need i want to hear you say it."
Draco finds the water, and felt his face drain of all color.
Harry looks at Draco…
Harry's eyes finally adjust to the bright room and noticed everyone in the room had tears on their faces except Snape who looked worried but was not one to normally show displays of emotion.
Harry nods as they stand and dress carefully into robes.
"Now tell me where he is.." Draco demanded
Then sits in a chair by the door for Harry to answer his invitation.
Harry just huffed not even entertaining him at that moment.
Did he plan to kill him? What was he going to do to him?
Draco sighed relieved to have help.
Draco had gotten the fire started and waited for Harry to come back with the water. Draco started to grow worried when the hours started ticking by.
Draco said carefully, the smile staying on his lips as he could only stare at Harry's parted lips, shame boiling inside his gut from being so close to another man but he could also feel something more threatening ready to slip at any moment, something he had been hiding from way too long.
"Dobby, who's worried about me?"
Draco grunted as he was reminded he's not alone by more shuffling next to him.
People treating him like dirt because he's a wizard, people wanting to be his friends only because his parents were killed to save him, people calling him a murderer and the one behind the basilisk attacks, people calling him crazy for believing Sirius is innocent and finally, people blaming him for taking part in a dangerous tournament without him wanting to.
He wondered if Draco was doing good in the Hospital Wing.
Before Harry knew it, it was time for his Potions lesson. Unfortunately, as if having a lesson with Snape wasn't enough, the greasy black-haired professor decided a change in seats, ending with Harry and Draco sitting together in front of Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. As Harry was focused on not yelling at Pansy Parkinson to stop her pig screeches she called laugher, he hadn't looked over to look at Malfoy from his embarrassment about what the Griffindor did at the morning. Malfoy was looking rather strange for the Malfoy Harry was used to. His platinum hair was gently teasing his gray eyes, which looked tired today and most of his right index finger was covered in a cloth like material.
The Slytherin quietly whispered to himself with wide eyes as he griped the  covers tightly, feeling like this day couldn't get any worse.
He noticed exactly 5 things:
"I-I, I have to go to the Great Hall for lunch, S-See you later D-Draco,, gotta go, Bye--" Harry said as he escaped the blonde's arms as fast as he could while trying not to hurt him in the process.
"Po-Potter, mynname is-s Dracon, not, not M-Mafoil ..." Malfoy said slumbering at his words from the fatigue and the damage from the fall.
He didn't understand why, they seemed happy together, so why would he feel like that way?
And it's not like he could confide in anyone that, because even if Malfoy was a big git and a bully, Harry wasn't a monster to make fun of him for something like that. No one deserves that, it could ruin him, and Harry wasn't going to fall on his level.
"You, you have a really nice name Draco"
Draco said the password which was "Extrafine Ash", and they entered the luxurious bathroom full of marble.
The Gryffindor tried to just turn on his heel and leave, to forget Malfoy had ever been hard and that they had even encountered and just go on with his life.
"Protter, I mayhave hit my head onthe way down, but I think I'm in, in the right mind to ask this" Malfoy said as he sat up cross legged, inches away from the other boy, the Slytherin's body still aching as Potter moving away a bit to give him space
He wouldn't live it again, he couldn't live it again.
He always knew how to get under Harry's skin
They didn't know what to say to eachother.
The teachers were having their weekly update meeting. If he remembered correctly, the meeting should be ending soon, but who knows if Harry will manage to avoid cursing Malfoy until then
"Malfoy, you passed out for 15 minutes and the first thing you ask when you wake up is how I am?"
The blonde felt his eyes widen and his face burn crimson at the sight of the other boy's bulge. He had felt something rubbing against his collarbone, but he certainly didn't expect it to be
"Fine Harry, what do you want!?" Hermione said irritatedly. She hadn't gotten much sleep too, as much of an ass Harry was to her at dinner yesterday he was still the only one left there for her.
When he was ready to knock on the door after a whole two minutes of calming himself, he yelped and almost jumped back from seeing Malfoy standing next to him on fleek like usual.
The caretaker said with a sly but crooked smile, the older man's mouth a mere foot away from his hair and of Malfoy's eyes. Harry hadn't grown much during the summer, unlike Malfoy that now was taller than him by a few inches.
"W-What? I didn't hear what you s-said…" Harry said apologetically, his senses on edge as the tiniest bit of movement on Draco's part just aroused him more.
"Malfoy, what the hell are you doing?" Harry said with a barely audible gasp as he felt the blonde's hands through his hair and his body right behind him, trespassing in his personal space.
Malfoy hated himself, hated what the world thought of him. Not only because Potter was right, but also because he knew he would never be able to get what he truly wanted. Not because of a lack money or fame, but because he wasn't good enough for it. He wasn't good enough for it even when he was eleven.
He felt calmer now, just hugging Harry
sure was the fact that they had to be
Harry looked at him go, almost completely careless about his detention, and more curious of what the future held for him
a bit at Harry and then continued with his food. Harry just sat there, confused. Malfoy had
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you think?" Draco asked Harry anxiously as with a flick of his wand made the water start running. He wasn't sure if he would be able to calm himself down if he saw Harry shirtless. Draco remembered the second task at the Triwizard Tournament, of which he doesn't remember much expect seeing Harry shirtless and his bottom half getting unexpectedly excited.
He wanted to see Harry. He wanted to tell him that he didn't care about his injury or that they were supposed to hate each other or that he was supposed to marry a pure-blood rich woman and have a hier or that there was a war ready to break out.
Malfoy finally looked at him with pale, terrified eyes as he felt a full sharp pain on his spine that only got stronger and stronger.
Hope, no matter how hard things are or how awful they seem, is what keeps us going, what helps us to keep trying to reach our goals.
“Electrostatic.”
“Hey, no, it’s all good. Do you want to talk about it?”
“What’s wrong, love?” She pressed one hand to his cheek, stroking along his cheekbone.
“I’m glad. Welcome home.”
“Nah, I quite like these clothes. I could probably do with a jacket, if you’re offering, but these are fine.”
As the door swung shut behind him, he heard his godfather sob “He’s coming home with us, Moony!”
“Potter, can I talk to you?” Draco’s hands were shoved in the pockets of his robe to hide the shaking.
“Because its shit! Being mean is fine,
Draco’s face heated up and his eyes opened wide with panic. “I- I didn’t mean- shit.” He tried to stand and run off, but only got halfway off the ground before Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back down, causing him to awkwardly overbalance and end up perched straddling Harry’s hips, his cheeks flushed almost red.
“Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter. Please don’t tell me one of you have managed to injure yourselves again?” Madame Pomfrey smiled at us, standing up from her chair and smoothing down her skirt.
“Go on then, Harry, who do you think it is?” Seamus laughed.
so "make some friends
“Boy! What on earth do you think you’re doing, shopping here in a
Harry felt his face flush red. He shrugged.
"You okay, mate?" Ron asked quietly as they got closer.
“Henrietta! Get up, girl!” Aunt Petunia’s shrieking voice broke through the quiet of Harry’s cupboard.
"Right. So, I'm guessing we're gonna be looking after him, then?" Ron didn't really mind- he'd do just about anything for Harry, just like he knew Harry would for him.
"Alright, bud, so what do you want from this floor then?"
Harry felt like his entire body was coursing with electricity, like his blood had been replaced with fiendfyre, like nothing he’d ever experienced before. Breathlessly, he pulled back. “In case that wasn’t clear enough, I’ve been in love with you for years, will you be my boyfriend?” He bit his lip.
He turned quickly, and was somewhat surprised when she pulled him into a tight hug. “I’m so proud of you, darling. I’ll message you your Aunt Andromeda’s phone number, and you should call her. She’ll take you in, okay, love?” Draco nodded, his eyes suspiciously damp. “Her child has a girlfriend, so she’ll support you, okay? And if you need any money, just let me know and I’ll try to get it past your father. I love you so much.” She pressed a quick kiss to his sharp cheekbone and stepped back, nodding at him as he grabbed his amp and moved towards the door.
“Alright. What the fuck do we do in here, then?”
He opened his bedroom door and stopped dead in his tracks- Harry was laid on his bed in nothing but his boxers, his arms folded behind his head and his long hair splayed across his pillow as he watched wax drip slowly from the candle at the end of his bed. Draco could see every scar and muscle up and down the front of Harry’s body, his warm-looking skin catching the candlelight.
Draco tried to put Harry down but he clung on tight. "No!"
“Thanks, Pans.” He smiled at her. “Did you tell the others what happened?” He’d told her the whole story before bed on Friday, and he’d implied that it would be fine for her to share it with their friends.
“Yes, we do, Harry. You’ve only got your school uniform, and besides, we want to. So, toast?”
“Where are we going?”
“You’re what?” Draco blinked owlishly.
Harry let out a bitter laugh and turned, pulling up the back of his school shirt until layers and layers of scars and fresh wounds were on show. They gasped. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I had no idea. Come on, get in.” They ushered him over to their car.
“Oh. I don’t hate you either.”
He’d only just sat down on the sofa when Draco came walking out of his bedroom, gently closing the door with a soft snick.
“That’s- thank you, Harry.” Draco nodded at him and Harry grinned.
“Would you have told me?”
Shock flashed across Draco's face for the barest of seconds before he smiled softly. "You're welcome… Harry."
Draco threw his quill down, a manic gleam in his eye- he needed to talk to Granger as soon as possible. In his two years working in the Department of Time within the Department of Mysteries, head Unspeakable Granger had been his best ally. She’d spoken up for him at his interview and assured the Unknowables that she would keep an eye on him, and had since been his research partner on his every project.
But the list I made of changes to make,
As soon as Harry got home he grabbed his laptop and headed to his bedroom. He got changed into his pyjamas, curled up and powered it on, anxiously rubbing his thumb over his chewed bottom lip.
The blond stopped laughing, but remained visibly amused. “I know that. Draco Malfoy.”
out after having what sounded like a really horrible nightmare. “It was just a dream, love, it’s okay, I’ve got you.” Harry pulled Draco even tighter to his chest, carrying on rubbing his hand up and down his back and carding the other through his messy blond hair. He kept whispering soft reassurances until he felt Draco stop sobbing and go lax on his chest- he’d fallen asleep. Harry smiled softly and pressed a kiss to his forehead before laying his head back down and falling back to sleep himself.
The pyjama section was wonderful, particularly because since his current pyjamas had been being worn since second year. He picked out fluffy bottoms, big, soft t-shirts, fleecey jumpers, a dressing gown and even a couple of onesies- one was a pastel pink dragon, and the other was a blue dinosaur, so he wasn't sure how he could possibly be expected to pass them up. He took everything back down to the counter and left them with the employee again, before heading up to the third floor.
"The main issues with time turners are that they run the risk of destabilising the timeline of the universe and causing your body to be killed by your past self." Granger's hair was even wilder than usual- they'd been debating for hours now, bouncing magical theory back and forth, and Draco was sure they must both look a fright. He could see that his hands were stained with ink, but he almost didn’t even want to know what sort of a state the rest of him was in.

"Well, sometimes people, particularly if they've been through trauma, might find themselves mentally reverting to a younger age sometimes. It's rather interesting, really, the way the mind-"
"Absolutely, buddy. Whatever you want." He grinned crookedly.
“Uh, no?” Harry’s face crinkled in confusion.
“Its fine, I’ve got the Weasleys and that now, so it’s not like I ever have to see them again.”
The two weeks between moving in with Sirius and Remus and starting school seemed to fly by, especially with most days being filled with motorbike lessons on Sirius’ bike, and practically before he knew it, he was packing his stuff into Remus’ car ready to move into his dorm. He was definitely glad he’d have his own room at Hogwarts too, because after finally having his own space for the first time in his life, he wasn’t ready to give it up and share a room with a bunch of strangers. A fun perk to having a teacher as a guardian, he supposed. He was startled as the pulled up at the school to see that it wasn’t a square new-build like every school he’d seen before, but a
“Oh, that is nice.”
“Mm.”
“Right, well, in that case, why in the bloody hell are you dating Malfoy, of all people?”
It was nice, having people support him, and when the taunts got too much he could just go to Remus’ suite and spend time with him. Plus, McGonagall continued to turn a blind eye to his friends’ actions against the people making transphobic comments, and barely followed up when Smith was hospitalised after being beaten bloody and having both arms broken (Seamus had confided in Harry that it was “So the wanker can’t wank”, which made him laugh loudly in the middle of Spanish class.)
“Pans, pass me the bloody pipe already!” Draco’s best friend had been hogging HIS pipe and HIS good weed for the past…. Hell knows how long. Long enough he could’ve gotten a good few hits in, anyway.
"Harry? Are you feeling okay?" She asked as gently as she could.
A knock sounded on Granger's office door seconds before it swung open and Potter, of all people, poked his head in. Draco knew Potter and Weasley both occasionally came to visit Granger, but in the two years he’d worked in the department he’d never once ran into either of them- he had sort of thought that perhaps Granger had some sort of charms set up to ensure they were never there at the same time.
“Why did you bring your own bedding?” Harry smiled bewilderedly, his green eyes crinkling at the corners in a way that made Draco’s heart clench. “Do you really
Draco was on his way to lunch with Pansy when he heard Flint spouting more transphobic bullshit at Harry. He sighed and exchanged a look with his best friend.
“Yes please. No sugar or milk.” Malfoy sat on one of the kitchen chairs as Harry waved a hand to make the tea.
“Alright, three, two, one, and, action!” Harry pressed record and stepped back as Draco started to play.
birthday, when his Hogwarts letter had arrived and he’d ran across the manor to show his father, flapping his hands excitedly, and shouted “Letter!”. He’d then spent the next few months until he’d started at Hogwarts in intensive speech therapy), and sometimes on his Bad days he found his voice abandoning him again.
He found an empty compartment near the end, one of the ones most students avoided because they were freezing cold, and placed his shrunken trunk on the luggage rack before flopping onto one of the benches. He laid down on his back with his eyes closed until someone slid open the door.
“Boy! Where’s my breakfast? And don’t even think about stealing any, you worthless little freak!” Vernon boomed, his moustache quivering.
“Nothing to be sorry about, Harry. Do you want a cuppa?”
Shacklebolt sat down across from Harry. “Harry, I went to school with Sirius and Remus. They’re good men, and given what you’ve been through it’s a damn shame you weren’t put with them to begin with when your parents were murdered.”
Already he would call Ron and Hermione his friends. He’d never had friends before, so it was rather exciting, although he knew he still came off as rude and snippy most of the time. The majority of the school were terrified of him, since Smith had spread around that he was the guy from St Brutus’ that everyone was afraid of, and minus one or two guys who tried it on with him, and were quickly rebuked with a fist to the face or a knife to the throat, everyone left him alone. This worked perfectly well for him, as he was very much used to people being afraid of him and ergo leaving him be; it seemed most of the professors were even afraid of him- the only three who showed no fear at all were Remus, Professor Snape, and a strict woman named McGonagall. Harry rather liked her, he had to admit. He had a thick Scottish accent and a stern face, but she treated everyone fairly and took no shit from even the rowdier or more affluent students, unlike most of the other professors. Harry respected her quite a lot.
“We should have known you were a faggot, Malfoy! Is that why you stood up for the fucking girl?” Nott called, his face twisted into a sneer that made his usually honestly fairly attractive features into a grotesque visage.
When a week later Draco walked in to his office to see Harry already there, he was stunned. He had some rather robust wards set up around his office when he wasn’t there, so he was utterly befuddled at how Potter had gotten in.
Once he had seated himself back in his armchair, he looked over to Draco again. “So, are you in a relationship?”
Draco woke up more comfortable than he’d ever felt before, laid out on top of possibly the best pillow he’d ever felt in his life. And then the pillow moved, and his eyes shot open. He had his face pressed into Harry’s sternum, and quickly lifted his head.
“Malfoy, obviously.” He shrugged. He thought it was obvious that the blond was the most attractive person in Hogwarts, even ignoring his feelings for him.
"No, sweetheart, no, it's not bad. You're not bad at all, it's okay. Alright, come here." She pulled him up off of the bed, wrapping her arms around him and motioning with her head for Ron to move over against the wall. She was only an inch taller than Harry, so he didn't seem quite as small as he had against Ron's lanky frame. She waved her wand and pulled up the blankets until they were hovering a few feet above the mattress and gently guided Harry back into bed. "Okay, Harry, come on, lay back down."
“Absolutely, Mr Potter, just this way.”
“Lupin as in
I make a list of all the ways to change my ways.
"Yeah, right, I saw that. Sure, you can- you can sit in here. Ron and Hermione are still prefects, so…"
"be yourself,

It turned out the boy’s name was Malcom. He was alright to fool around with, but after a few weeks of getting each other off, he kept trying to
yes! Skinny jeans, t-shirts…. I might even get that eyebrow piercing I’m always going on about.”
“Do you want to go home?” Draco asked.
Asleep, Harry's face looked much younger than usual, and if he didn't know better, Draco would probably guess he was no older than fifteen. The usual tenseness of his face was gone, leaving behind nothing but smooth, soft skin marred only by his scar, which extended from the left upper edge of his forehead down through his eye and over his nose like a lightning strike. As he thought about how much younger Harry looked, he realized that the tenseness that aged him hadn't been present at any point the day before, either, although Harry had seemed more like a child than the adult he was. Harry by no means looked like a child; in spite of his short, skinny stature and large eyes, he had generally looked around 18 since sixth year, but somehow last night all of that had been erased and replaced with some childlike innocence he'd never seen before.
Smith’s eyes were wide as he saw Harry’s body, and he forewent his shower completely in favour of running back up to the castle to tell his friends what he had seen.
But I stay the same,
“Yeah, okay.” Harry was already starting to realize that clearly Remus was the more put-together, organised one of the pair of them.
He got into the common room at 5 minutes to 8, seeing it thankfully empty. He leaned back against the wall and noted that the two sofas had been moved until they were facing exactly where he was stood.
“You can’t hit a girl!” One of the boys to his left shouted.
As he heard the car pull into the driveway, Harry moved quickly to hide by the front door, so that when it opened Uncle Vernon wouldn’t see him immediately, and then he could strike. It worked perfectly. The door swung open, and his uncle walked straight past him yelling “Boy, why can’t I smell dinner cooking?” and Harry pounced, jabbing his knife into the back of his knee- Harry had been stealing books from his cousin and the library and teaching himself to read since he was three, and he knew from the anatomy book he’d stolen that there was an artery that would make him bleed out rapidly there. His uncle turned as he went down, screaming and reaching out to grab at Harry, who took advantage of his small stature to dodge at scramble up the stairs, sitting himself at the top and watching as Vernon clawed his way towards the closed living room door, but when he reached it and pulled it open only to be met by the sight of his dead wife and son, he passed out. The blood pooled around Vernon in a macabre puddle, and Harry made his way back down the stairs and slashed his knife across both of his uncle’s eyes, splitting them open, before he dropped the knife and turned to go back upstairs.
The sun had gone down an hour ago at least, but Harry kept walking. He had made it at least to the next town over, and he was exhausted, but he really had nowhere else to go. He was resigned to continuing well into the night, when an old-fashioned black car pulled up beside him. As the back door opened, revealing a tall, pale man with a moustache, he whipped the knife out of his boot.
“Get out of my house. You are a disgrace to the name of Malfoy, and I will be submitting the paperwork for your disownment immediately. Come Monday morning, you will no longer be a member of this family.”
“Harry.” He tilted his head in an awkward nod, not sure how to respond.
“Thanks, Ron, yeah, that- that sounds good.” Harry flopped down on his bed and Ron did the same.
. You and Sirius aren’t related by blood, and besides, even if you were, you’d still only be second cousins, and so were Sirius’ parents.” Remus teased.
Before his sluggish brain could even catch up, his mouth came out with “Bold of you to assume I’m a top.” Mortified, Draco felt his cheeks heat up.
"Yeah. For about two weeks now." Harry felt his cheeks staining red.
"Deep breaths, Harry. Try not to pull on your hair, okay? I think that, at least for now, you need to focus on getting more comfortable in yourself and your age regression without thinking about bringing a caregiver in to the equation. I also think that whilst you're at school, you might want to try and get closer to Draco, and see if he reacts negatively or positively to you. Is there somewhere in your school you will be able to safely regress?"
“Good idea.” Harry pressed a second kiss, this time to Draco’s sharp, pointed jaw.
“Right, of course, yeah. I’m Teddy’s godfather, so will I be able to adopt him?” Harry had no idea how this was supposed to work, but he knew he wanted to be the one to raise Teddy- he’d promised Remus, after all, and besides, he already loved the little boy more than life itself.

“He… stabbed…. me.” Aaron’s voice was barely more than a pained groan as he clutched at his stomach.
“Uhm, mate, I think you missed, like, all of the information?” Ron piped up.
“Yeah, yeah, that’s… that’s fine.”
Draco laughed, startled. “He’ll have Crabbe and Goyle protecting him, so it’s probably best you don’t try.”
“Yeah, he’s not cried once yet. I’m- I don’t know how to look after a kid though, mum! I wasn’t even looked after as a kid!” Harry could feel himself start to panic, his vision blurring. As his breathing sped up, Bill and Fleur came through the door to see his brothers looking panicked and Harry clearly on the verge of a panic attack.
That evening, he spent hours sat with his guitar and his notebook in front of the living room fire, writing an angry song about his father. Once the lyrics were done and he had a basic melody, he worked on finetuning it as much as possible until he was finally happy with it.
“’Mione!” Both Harry and Ron spoke at the same time, and her dark skin flushed.
While Draco showered, Harry cleaned Teddy up and got him dressed in an adorable little outfit of soft little blue dungarees, a dinosaur print t-shirt and a pair of little pink booties. Teddy burbled happily as Harry dressed him and cuddled him and then strapped him into the pram by the door. As he was strapping Teddy in, Draco walked out if his bedroom and Harry’s jaw nearly dropped as his hands fumbled with the straps.
Harry stalked back towards the dungeons, magic crackling dangerously around him, and the part of himself that wasn’t entirely lost to the sick pleasure thanked Merlin that most of the students were away.
“Okay, so, objectively speaking, who do you think is the most attractive person in the school?” Seamus leaned on his boyfriend’s shoulder and addressed the group.
“Let the feasting begin.” McGonagall says in a haggard voice and we all give a cheer as the food appears before our eyes. I throw a glance at Draco and see that his eyebrows are still wrinkled in confusion.
“And you are?”
Hermione, Ron and I give a great shout as a little eleven-year-old blond gets sorted into our house. The whole table is roaring and banging on the table as the rest of the students from the other houses give a polite clap. I can’t help but give a whoop of joy for being back at Hogwarts with the people I love. In a way I feel lighter, not having to be consumed with the thoughts of Voldemort and the threat he always had over my head. My heart is bursting at the moment and I give a sigh of content.
“Why in the bloody hell are you here then?” Potter says with a small snarl in his voice, I can see the defense in his eyes and it makes me feel small for just a second, before I brush it off.
“Professor?” I turn to look at my dark haired mate, his curiosity outweighing his former anger.
“You have until the Halloween banquet.” I shake my head about to argue with his words but his look silences me. “But first answer me a question.”
“You should close your robes.” He huffs at me, but I just roll my eyes at him and shake my head, always one to ruin our moments.
“They were what I am, but they had another mate. Unfortunately she died in an accident before I was born.” I look down, remembering the one time my parents told me about their lost mate. I know they both missed her and loved her with all their hearts.
“Is it true you were a Death Eater?” A tall red head rudely asks.
I watch as he turns back to his fellow Slytherin and picks up the conversation with ease.
“Really?” I give a little hop.
“Apparently she is our new DADA teacher…” Ron mumbles through another mouthful of what looks like potato this time.
“With my life.” I state simply. Snape and I had gotten over our differences after what happened during the final battle. We had a chance to talk about all that happened and I had been relieved when he hadn’t been dead, even though I still don’t know how he survived.
“Still mad about last night then?” He doesn’t say anything and I heave a great sigh before scooping big helpings of food onto my plate.
“Yes that is true. But it happens that there is a single witch with this inheritance that no longer lives within a pack.” I step between the aisles. “You see if Voldemort could harness the power of just one of those with this creature inheritance, he had a greater chance of winning the war. Not only are these individuals powerful creatures through their transformations, they are powerful witches and wizards.”
By the time I reach the classroom I am in a foul mood due to the fact that I once again got lost and ended up in the dungeons. My mood gets even worse when I hear the loud voices of students on the other side of the door and find that I am the late one to class. With a huff I storm through the door and let it slam shut, silencing the entire classroom. I glide up to the front of the classroom and turn sharply to face my students.
“I have a habit of doing that lately.” I can’t help but give a slight smile as I see Harry throw back his head laughing at something Draco whispered in his ear.
“May I introduce Helena Win?” Severus steps up beside me and introduces me to them. “She is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” I see some of them glance worriedly at each other.
“Yes.” The man can read right through me.
“Oh Harry don’t worry, you guys will find them.” Hermione reaches across the table and gives my hand a slight squeeze.
“How kind of you for not leaving me to wonder another hour.” I snidely remark, still a bit peeved at the beta for not disclosing whom his Godson’s mate is. He rolls his eyes at my snarkiness as we make our way through the bright halls.
“Well wouldn’t it be like the rest of us? They still has the identifier as Alpha, beta, or omega, so it wouldn’t be that different when it comes to how we all find our mates.” I am in a state of shock that he has thought this through so well and the way he said it so matter of fact.
“Bloody get on with it then.” My eyes snap to the blonde and I raise my eyebrow at his outburst.
“I must be leaving Miss.” I yelp in surprise as the small house elf startles me.
The hall is filled with students eagerly walking down to lunch. I grimace as my belly growls in anger at the lack of food that it has been given. Other then the fact that I am borderline hangry I am satisfied with the days lessons thus far. After teaching the first years I then had fourth years and third years. Each class went exceedingly well. At first there was a lot of mistrust and even fear in a lot of their faces, but as the lessons progressed I noticed the changes. When I told them about myself and my creature inheritance I saw the interest. It was when I started changing forms for them that the true excitement took hold. Gliding through the big doors  of the Great Hall I take a look around at the mostly cheerful faces and the excited buzz of students on their first days of school. A few first years grin shyly at me as I pass and I nod in their direction and I hop up the steps and onto the landing that holds the teachers table.
“I expect to see you and Miss Granger in class tomorrow.” Severus drawls out in his bored sounding voice, talking at his Godson. Both a pretty brown haired girl and Malfoy nod their head. “Very good.” He says. After another moment of doubt I straighten my spine and I finally reach Snape’s side, doing my best to ignore the scents twirling around my nose.
Helena’s POV
“I am hoping sooner then later Hermione.” I state before turning back to the front of the great hall as Headmistress McGonagall steps back up to the winged podium.
“What is it?” Severus is alert and looking around the room as if the Dark Lord himself were going to storm through the large oak doors and bring the castle tumbling down. I give a sharp shake of my head not able to speak or take my eyes off the two forms for more than a second. My mind is going a million miles a minute as I try to wrap my head around the stunning news, not knowing how I was going to be able to handle this kind of situation.
“And so it begins.” Sev mumbles in my ear as I rush to catch up with him halfway through the room as he glides down a row and up to the teacher’s table.
“You will learn your way about.” He states simply before addressing my attire. “You are looking nice my dear. I must say you look like a Slytherin.” I look down and realize that I am wearing the green and silver of his snakes.
“Really?” She asks in surprise.
“Why not?”
“Helena?” I hear the hint of worry in Severus’s voice as he leans toward me while also clapping politely along as another first year is sorted into his house.
“Yes Mr….”
“Yes. She was dropped of all charges, the papers never did say why.”
“Don’t worry Gingerbread. I haven’t killed or cursed anyone in at least a year.” I smirk, as he turns even whiter at my statement.
“My thing is, if she was a Death Eater why didn’t Draco ever mention her?” I curse at the logical thinking of my best friends. I send a look to my mate and see that he is engrossed in a conversation with Blaise.
“Well. Which one?” I lean forward wanting to hear the gossip.
“Severus. I don’t know if this is a good idea. Why would she want me anyway, with my past?” I stride down a hallway of the newly refurbished Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Following the tall imposing beta with his billowing black robes and fast stride.
“Sorry.” I smile at her sheepishly then turn back to the big man.
I look over at McGonagall and see the deathly glare she is bestowing the young woman who still hasn’t noticed that all eyes are on her. Finally the woman’s eyes snap away from my mate’s as Professor Snape nudges her softly and mumbles something in her ear. My own eyebrows wrinkle in confusion at the friendly touch that Snape of all people give her. Suddenly her harsh golden eyes change to that of a warm honey chocolate as a deep blush fills her face as she pushes back her chair with a loud scrape that has all of us wincing and a few students holding their hands to their ears. I expect her to shuffle to the podium and quickly state who she is and then run off in embarrassment. But instead watch in fascination as the 5’8”, madly blushing woman takes a breath, straightens her spine and walks proudly… if not haughtily around the table and to the podium.
“Why do I feel like she means something to us? I have been racking my brain all night but I just can’t put my finger on it.” I hear the frustration in Potters voice as he retracts his hand from Draco and turns to the side in dejection.
“How do you know they will hate you for being a Death Eater?” His question, though logical, is stupid.
“I just can’t.” I stand up and start pacing back and forth.
“A Death Eater? Are you sure Hermione?” I look back toward the table to see that our new professor is now having a chat with Hagrid and picking at her food.
“It us natural for me. As Granger said I inherited my creature blood and instincts at five years of age. It was painful at first, but now I relish in the pull of my magic and the intense change.”
“Helena I was just coming to get you.” I jump as Severus joins my side when I make it to the bottom of the stairs leading to my rooms.
“I uh got hot…” I wince at how lame my excuse sounds even to me.
“Harry I never seen her before. I only know what Mum and Dad have told me.” I suddenly know that they are talking about me and this truth finally allows me to ignore their smells and focus on their words. Stealthily moving forward I glance around the corner and see Potter had stopped his blond mate with a hand on his shoulder. They stand in the middle of the corridor, forgetting the fact that just about anyone could stumble upon their private discussion.
“This can’t be happening.” I want to bang my head against the table as I continue to sniff the sweet air of the two men. I can only feel a moment of relief that my own scent and bond is bound by the magic I placed on myself. For I knew if they were to smell my scent this would be a very different evening, one that would leave the student talking for a very long time.
It doesn’t take long before I start spiraling into boredom as the new professors slowly make their way one after the other. Feeling that I am not the only one I look up and find the grey eyes of my beloved mate. He to is just as bored and rolls his eyes at the ceiling before giving me the well know Malfoy smirk that I have come to love. It is so incredibly odd how comfortable I am with Draco as a mate now. When I first found out he was mine I very nearly went in a rage. We didn’t talk for the first month after my 17th birthday, and even after that when we had small chances to see each other face-to-face we were hardly civil.
“In a since I have Headmistress.” I state and start to getting a sinking feeling in my stomach.
“I had an inkling… I bit more then an inkling actually, given that your eyes were golden for half the time.” He leans back in his chair. “Now what are you going to do?”
“Yes Miss Granger?”
“Is something amiss?” Severus leans in, his own sour scent of harsh potions blocking the honeyed fragrance and shaking me out of the heavy haze.
“You’ll have to find out for yourself.” I growl and he continues to smirk at me.
“Yes Sir. Lived there most of my life, when the war begun I traveled back and forth.” Some of the professors froze at my mention of the war.
“It’s a good un to.” I jump as Hagrid’s booming voice invades my ears. I turn to the giant.
“Okay! I would say she is bloody brilliant after what just happened!” Ron says with a smirk and we all chuckle again at the stunt our new Professor pulled.
I step out of my rooms refreshed from a nice long nap and a steaming hot shower. I glance down at my tight black dress showing through the part in my dark green robes. Shifting uncomfortably under their hot weight, never liking to wear the stuffy formal robes. I feel too confined in their suppressing folds. Most of the time I opt out of wearing them, but decided that since this is the first night with the students I thought it would be best to at least wear them this once. I slipped into a soft pair of silver flats before brushing my long auburn hair into large ringlets. To finish out the outfit I had quickly brushed on my dark mascara and painted my lips with a lovely shade of red.
“Oh right!” The lovely woman claps her hands and faces us all with a smile. “I am ‘Professor’ Helena… wait Son of a B…”
“Stop being a twit Helena and just say thank you for getting you a job.” I roll my eyes as he knocks on the door and I hear a stern voice say ‘enter’. Severus throws the doors open wide before leading me into the Headmistresses office. Looking around at the bookshelves and the moving portraits on the high walls and a big desk is placed in the room and behind the desk in a large leather chair sits a very stern looking alpha with graying hair and square glasses. She looks up at us as we step into the middle of the room and graces me with an apprising look. I watch as her nostrils flair taking in my nonexistent scent, as I like wise take in her dampened scent.
“As if I would roll over so easily Sev. My ‘Alphas’” I hiss out the word. “Are sure as hell going to have a hard time taming me. You know it’s not in my nature to play the innocent one.” My voice holds a reminder of all the times that I have killed and tortured for the Dark Lord. The times that Severus and I had ended up dueling each other because of something we had said. He knows very well how hard it was to get me to behave and act like the young lady I am. By the time Voldemort handed me over to be trained by Sev I was on the verge of true darkness, It was Severus who brought me back from the ledge and made me see the dim light in the utter darkness that Voldemort had used to warp my mind.
“And why is that Miss Win?” I rub my hands on my jeans underneath my dark green robes, trying to calm my heart and clear my head.
I hear the challenge in those words.
“Sounds like ye got it all plan’d ou.”
“Is that so?” I hear the smile in his voice and I snarl at him.
“What Malfoy here has guessed and I am sure a few others have as well, I am not someone that you would have wanted to meet a year ago.” I move to my desk and hop up on it with ease.
“I did.” I hop of my desk and slowly start pacing the room, feeling the pressure of everyones undivided attention.
“Helena.” Severus growls and I flash him a smile and I hear a quite chuckle come from his Godson.
“I will take that as an affirmative. You should tell them before then.”
So yeah... It's been awhile. All I can say is COVID and online teaching keep me under at all times. Luckily we have a break soon and I hope to crank out a few chapters. This Story does not have a beta so I am sorry for any mistakes. Please enjoy.
“Back to the earlier conversation, yes Draco and his mate will be returning this year.” I raise my eyebrow in question because if I try to speak He would be sprayed with mashed potatoes. “Draco didn’t want to come back but his mate is dragging him along. His mate wasn’t here for their seventh year due to the war so he wanted to come back and finish it out.” I nod my head and we both drift into our own thoughts, listening to the talk and the chatter of the other teachers.
I look down at the students and see that the majority of them have gone pale and still, fear clearly in their young and innocent eyes as they watch their Potions Professor descend the stone steps. “I must say that you truly seem to enjoy frightening your students.” He smirks down at me and I smile up at him before giving him a small shove and making him stumble to the side with a slight gasp at the unexpected move. Some of the student’s snigger making me grin widely as my mentor glares at me for ruining his moment to strike fear in their hearts. “ Oh come off it Severus!” I say loudly as we walk through the double doors. The students in the hall are clearly amused at my antics, many of them laughing at Snape’s back. As I follow my now brooding mentor I find myself pausing, and gape at the brightly lit hall. Festivity is in the air and I watch as hundreds of students rushing to their perspective tables.
“Well ello I’m Hagrid.” I very big brute of a man stands up almost knocking over the whole table and grasps my hand in his giant one giving it a rough squeeze. I take in his scent and am quiet surprised to find that he is non-presented.
“And what of it?” I turned to the offending beta with my hands on my hips.
“I have to be wrong! I must be wrong!” I growl out in a mumble, ignoring the fact that Severus is on the edge of his chair and probably going to grab and shake me if I don’t say something soon. Even as I say these words I know that I am not wrong, it is very clear that I have just found my mates, and that I can no longer avoid my fate. The thought now streaming through my head is why? Why do my mates have to be non other then an Ex Death Eater like myself and the Fucking Boy Who Lived…
“I don’t quite understand why it matters what my orientation is.” I know my eyes are now golden in anger as I practically spit out the next words. “You boys have made it quite clear in you distaste for me.” I push at Malfoy’s chest and the growl he gives sends a shiver down my spin. I let out a deep growl of my own, not backing down in this pissing contest. “Besides it matters not, I have no scent… Did you ever think that means I might be a non-presenter?”
“Why would McGonagall allow her to step foot on the school grounds.” My heart gives a painful squeeze at the spite in Harry’s voice. It hurts me to know that he is swayed to judgment by just a fraction of my past. Closing my eyes I give myself a shake knowing that it is better this way. If they think of me as the killer I was, then I can feel better about deceiving them. I step out of hiding with a harsh look, and from the shock and guilt on their faces, they know I have heard what they said.
“Really? Why don’t you tell me then, since He’s being a prick?” I gesture my thumb to Severus.
“Would you join me in my office?” I jump at Severus’s cold voice and I know I am about to get an earful.
“I will not let my Godson and his mate suffer!” There is a sound of finality in his voice and I feel as if I am doomed.
“I will give you a time limit.” I stop pacing and turn to him with hope in my eyes.
“That was a riot!” Ron chuckles through a mouthful of food and Hermione looks at him in disgust.
“So what do you know about her?” Harry mumbles
“Yes ma’am, I can sense them and I know they are searching for me.”
“Its not my fault that my favorite color is the one your house represents.” I smile with a shrug and he chuckles as well.
“Yes Ma’am! I promise it won’t happen again.” I taste the lie laying thick in the back of my throat, hoping she won’t hear it as well.
“Language!” McGonagall shrills and I throw a guilty look in her direction.
“Very good Miss Granger. Five points to Gryffindor.” I watch her smirk in satisfaction. But am surprised when another hand shoots in the air.
“As I have said I am very powerful. I have a spell around me at all times. It is masking my omega scent and the mental link from them. I can tell that they have already found each other, and I know that they feel my missing presence.” I suddenly feel shame but crush it down.
“Enough Helena.” His voice is stern and I know he is pissed.
“How do you know?” His voice is like a knife. “You said yourself this morning that you know your mates have been searching for you through the bond. And I know for a fact that that Draco and Harry spent the last year searching for you.” I shove down the guilt that is threatening to leak out and keep my face void.
“Severus I really am tired.” I slump in a high winged chair and rub my face.
“Well.” She finally speaks up after a few moments. “I am sorry you feel that way. But I must say I am happy to have you here on staff.” She stands up and both Severus and I do the same. “If you have any questions please feel free to speak with me. Now if you will excuse me I must continue to prepare for the students coming in tonight.” We bid our goodbyes to the older alpha and then walk out of her office and down the staircase.
“I don’t want to hear it Severus.” I growl as I see the look on his face and start stalking down the portrait filled hallway.
Sorry guys, I am living the Covid teaching life and get busy. Here is the next update, be patient with me!
“Yes Professor.”
Something is amiss. I say to him through our bond and he gives a nod of his head.
“I am positive!”
“Hello.” I jump in shock at the small squeaky voice and lift my head looking for the speaker. “Down here miss.” I look down to find a house elf at my feet; she is looking up at me with a happy smile.
“No.” the giant says. “Yous will ave ta see fur yourself.” I glare at him and he just grins stupidly.
“I was wrong. Looks like we won’t get on to well.” He laughs as I mumble this and pats me roughly on the back. I slide back my chair and stand. “If you will excuse me I think I will go find my rooms and get settled in before tonight.” The others nod a farewell and I walk out of the great hall.
“Maybe not as powerful as our Mr. Potter. And if they are a omega then they are just a little less powerful then their alphas, but only by a fraction. That is why the omega’s alphas have to be very powerful wizards.” Once again the direction of the topic is getting me nervous and from the look in both Potter and Draco’s eyes their curiosity will take them closer to the truth. I fear that the only thing that is holding them back is my lack of scent and the blocked bond.
“Oh don’t worry about it Ronnie, I have been asked worse.” The boy’s ear tips turn bright red and the others laugh at my antics. “Now if I am not mistaken you all have a curfew to make and Professor Severus has mentally prepared a very tedious lecture to berate me with in his office.”
“Out with it already.” Ron mumbles through a mouthful of roast, drawing the attention of more Gryffindor’s.
“Headmistress said that you can decorate in here and your rooms anyway you like. She said to just send out for whatever you need.” Winnie pipes up and I give her a smile. She then leads me to the wall behind my desk and starts to tap the bricks in a small pattern. “You can change the combination at anytime or add a portrait to guard a password.” The bricks she touches start to glow and then the wall breaks apart and leads into a cozy living room. I can’t help but grin as I look at the roaring fire on the opposite wall. A deep red leather couch and two matching armchairs are placed around a big wooly carpet. I walk around the room and see bookshelves for all my books, along with other small comforts to make a place feel like home. I step into a door on the left and see a small kitchen with all the necessities and a quaint kitchen table in the corner. I let the door swing shut and walk into another room that has a nice looking bed and a small bathroom in it; I guess that it’s a guest room. I step out of this room and across the warm living room to the last door in the apartment. There I step into a large bedroom, the walls are a light grey and another plush carpet takes up most of the hardwood floor. In the middle of the room is a huge bed and I laugh in joy before running and jumping in the middle of it. The sheets are white and I think its so I can redecorate, but it is by far the nicest and biggest bed I have ever been on. There are two nightstands on either side, and a wooden bench at the end of the bed.
“He is right Harry.” Granger pipes in. “In fact I believe I read somewhere that witches and wizards with this specific creature inheritance always have two to three mates.”
“Hello.” I say smiling at them all in greeting, surprised that my voice sounds so at ease.
“Severus has told me of your past Miss Win and how you became a Death Eater.”
“When have you ever known me to make a wise decision Severus?” I cannot stay angry as my mentor gives me a small smile and I see the love he has for my deep in his onyx eyes. Having enough I return the smile before turning and exiting the warm room and into the freezing dungeons. Slowly and silently I tread through the dark castle and up to my rooms. Halfway there I am slammed with the sweet scent of my mates and not second later I hear their hushed voices.
“Is she a Slytherin?”
“A unicorn!” He shouts excitedly and I once again feel the tingly pull of my magic and I switch forms again. A few of the girls squeal in delight at my white coat and pointy horn. A few of the students start spouting of random animals like; dog, owl, fox, giant spider. Each time a new animal is called out I willingly change for the amusement of my students. Finally I am back in human form and looking around the buzzing classroom.
“You are going to take that ridiculous spell off and let them find you.” He states matter-of-factly leaning forward once again.
“I aim to please.” I give a little bow that has them tittering and Severus scoffing.
“Death Eater.” I heard a dark woman mumble to her companion.
“You are not going to out me Snape!” I am in a rage, wanting to punch his beak like nose, making it bloody.
“Hello.” I say cheerily and some of the staff smiles in greeting.
“What do you mean Harry?” Ginny asks me
Hey I got one out on time!
“Longbottom what about you?” I ask.
“ I believe there are two families left in all the world, one in America and the other in India.” Granger says.
“I know a lot of you fought and lost loved one due to the war and I am sorry for that… But know this, I was not a willing participant. I did not choose Voldemort, he chose me because he saw me as a weapon to help defeat his enemy’s and did everything he could to make sure I was on his side.” My voice softens as I try to convey my sorrow to the eighth years, they had been through much at such an impressionable age. Glancing quickly at my mates I see that they to have softened expressions at my words, not expecting a form of apology from me. A hand raises and I turn to the waiting brown haired Alpha.
“Well, I became a Death Eater at the ripe age of seventeen. For those of you who would like to do the math, that was months after Potter saw the Dark Lord rise again, making me now 21 years of age.” I watch the mixed reactions of the students ranging from shock, anger, and curiosity. I slowly roll up the sleeves of my sweater allowing them to see the dark mark on my forearm.
“Shove it Snape! I knew you could tell. Knowing you, you probably had it figured out from the very beginning!” My thoughts turn back to this morning when he asked me how I would feel about the possibility finding my mates at Hogwarts.
“As do I, But today I am making an exception. You see todays subject is very close to home for me. And I prefer if you all just listened, trust me I won’t test you on what you are learning today.” I see the understanding in her eyes and then watch as all my student’s lean forward eager to hear more about me.
“I don’t believe you.” Draco sneers.
“Thats a deep question for a shallow mind.” I sneer, the sharpness of my vice make a few of the students balk. Potters hackles rise and the Alpha starts growling, rolling my eyes at the boy, I say “Settle down, maybe in time you will come to know about why I am here. But I am not going to just dive into my physic just because some Alpha thinks I am the Big Bad Death Eater… Respect goes both ways Potter.” I let my words settle around the room and watch the unease slightly dissipate. Harry’s shoulders drop a little, but his icy green eyes are still boring into me.
With a sigh I step out of my office and into the room of waiting first years.
“I should… but I won’t.” He sighs at my words but decides not to comment anymore as we walk down the big set of stairs before the great hall. I notice the noise level of hundreds of voices as students collect in the great hall and mill about the large doors, their scents hitting my nose like a brick. There are only a few dozen whom have presented, but their smells are still strong. I look to Severus and now see a cold mask in place and a mean smirk on his sharp pale face. I huff, knowing this look way to well, this is the look that he used when dealing with the Dark Lord or any of the other Death Eaters. The look of utter boredom mixed with annoyance. I have only seen him remove this ‘mask’ when it is just the two of us.
“Yes Miss Granger?” I say in amusement, at her waving hand.
“What do you mean a weapon?”
“Hello there.” I say smiling back at her.
“And your mates?” Harry asks, eyeing the distance between Malfoy and myself.
“I expect the utmost out of my Professors.” Her eyes are sharp as she takes in my huddled form before continuing. “I expect that the display that happened tonight will not happen again.” The tone in her voice is one of finality and gives me very little room to argue, so I give her a nod.
“Professor Win. Wherever are your robes?” I look up at the Headmistress with a guilty smile.
“Ten points from each of your houses. And next time you fancy a private chat, take it somewhere no one else will be able to hear.” They start to argue back in outrage but I silence them. My omega side is begging me to stop, they are our mates and I should be punished for disrespecting them. I growl at the thoughts, hating the idea of being submissive. After years of Voldemort morphing my mind into that of a follower, but a strong-minded follower, it disgusts me to be reminded that I am just a little omega in need of her alphas. Voldemort didn’t want weak simpering Death Eaters, most assuredly in his inner circle, much to the world’s surprise.
“Did she purposely just?...” Hermione is too flustered to continue the question, but we all know what she was about to ask. Was this woman poking fun at the self-righteous Professors?
“Very good Ms. Granger.” I praise once again and try not to let the discomfort of how close she is to the truth.
“So it would be wise to tell them beforehand.”
“How delightful.” I laugh as I step into the classroom. It is a big room filled with two to a desk tables. A great iron chandelier hangs from the ceiling as well as a decent sized dragon’s skeleton. I smirk thinking that the dragon I change into is probably twice the size. I see that on one end of the classroom stands a projector, I then look the large arched windows on both sides of the room one side overlooking the castle courtyard and the other half overlooking the black lake. A big oak desk sits at the front and behind the desk is a half spiral staircase, which I assume, leads to my office and compartments. I walk down the middle of the aisle and up the stairs with Winnie following behind. I open the door and find a nice size office, empty except for a plush leather chair, a desk and a huge fireplace. I can just imagine myself doing work for hours on end in this room.
“Must have been Snape.” I say
“It doesn’t matter.” I know that I am being cold and heartless.
“But Professor.” I turn sharply.
“Dad said that she was part of the Dark Lords inner circle.” I hear Potter’s sharp intake of breathe. “It gets worse…” Draco pauses and I see the black haired Alpha nudge his mate to continue. “Dad said that if You Know Who ever wanted one of his victims to have a slow death she was the one to do it… Not only that Mum said that she is some rare form of creature. That she can turn into any animal imaginable, magic and non-magic. So naturally Voldemort used her as a spy and for his impossible missions.” I see my blonde mate shiver in a moment of weakness and know he is thinking about the impossible missions Voldemort loved to send us on.
“No.” I squeak. “No… Damn it! You did this on purpose!” I turn on him. “Two months to tell them, and two months till my first heat… Either way they will find out and I will be screwed.” The smirk on his face tells me that I am right and I flex my fingers as the inner voice in my head begs me to curl them around his neck and squeeze.
“Well if he did that then that must be because he trusts her.” Hermione follows my stare and gives Helen an assessing look. “And you trust him now don’t you Harry?”
“What is she doing here?” Neville speaks up.
“I still think your decision will come back with a vengeance.” He states and I sigh hoping the conversation was over. “What will you do if one or both of them end up going here? I know a few students who have presented in the last few years, one of them being my Godson.” There is pride in his voice when he mentions his godson and I can’t help feel a tinge of jealousy at the small family Severus has left.
“Yeah. I asked you a question.” Potter’s growl vertebrates throughout the stone room and makes the hair all over my body stand on end.
“Very good.” She try’s to crack a smile as she magic’s the sorting hat away and looks down at all of us. “Now as you all know we spent this last year rebuilding the castle and hiring on new staff. This being said I am going to do something out of the ordinary.” McGonagall takes a long pause and has us all leaning in our seats to see what happens. My thoughts of my missing mate pushed aside for now. “I would like the new staff members come up and introduce themselves to you. I expect all of you to be on your best behavior.” She gives us a slightly harsh look before turning and walking back to her chair. We eagerly watch as a short walrus of a man comes up and introduces himself as Professor Lark.
Harry froze on the spot, his eyes widening as he was taken aback by that fact. His brain was so overwhelmed he didn't realise Malfoy had his wand on his neck, his face still flush as he spoke.
Draco threw his head back against the wall, looking at the ceiling.
he wiped his tears and said.
He admitted tiredly. He'd been trying to fall asleep for Merlin knows how long, but he just couldn't because of that stupid Scarhead that plagued his every thought with his behavior.
That wasn't like the git Harry first met at Madam Malkin's four year ago getting his robes fitted. Even if they hadn't known each other back then, Harry still considered it their first interaction.
(See the end of the chapter for
No one heard his muffled panting outside of the Hospital Wing as Madam Pomfrey treated a pale first year that had an slight accident with a cuting charm, but ended up with a back injury from the fainting.
Suddenly, as the Gryffindor was boosting off animatedly how many people he had won today at Wizarding Chess with one-hand movements, the Hufflepuff took ahold of his other hand that was resting on the table.
Several seconds or even minutes passed by, they seemed to drag on for centuries inside the blonde's brain. Something was very off about Potter's behavior and he would get to the bottom of this so he could continue annoying him, he thought as he watched the door in front of the Gryffindor.
1. It wasn't Christmas
The blonde looked dazzled from the boy in front of him, his pupils dialated as he felt his eyelids flushing.
The Slytherin quietly muttered apathetically.
The Gryffindor on the other hand, was laughing a tad bit too much at the dad jokes the Hufflepuff Prefect was saying.
Of course he was jealous of the blonde's hair, it was so tamed and perfect all the time and he couldn't even brush his own successfully. There was no way he could find someone who would find such crazy hair attractive.
Draco finally makes his move, but what will Harry find out at the mysterious room?
He got up and walked closer to the lake, before throwing a rock as big as his palm in the lake as far as he could. He watched it get eaten by the dark waters and admired the faint waves it created in the water, before it calmed down again. When the stone hit the water he could swear he heard a crack, but it was probably leaves crunching under his feet.
He felt the panic inside him rise with every moment that passed. He had to get away as fast as he could, he had to run to the other side of the castle, far enough where Draco wouldn't see him in that state.
"Yes Harry?" She answered quite more cheerfully than she felt.
The blonde averted his gaze before finally talking softly, his ears pink from embarrasment even if he wasn't the one caught red-handed here, but his eyes holding a kind of sadness in them.
No, forget that thought, not Crabbe or Goyle.
"Draco, what are we doing here?" Harry asked the blonde boy. He couldn't wait any longer. He had to know what Draco thought of him. Draco smirked at Harry
He chuckled lightly to himself as Madam Pomfrey had already left to her office after finishing up the treatment of that first year that came earlier.
As long as the hug felt, it was probably mere seconds before Harry stubbled back anxiously.
Malfoy cared about him?
He didn't understand the reason behind this feeling, maybe it was that no one had ever touched him like that, or maybe it was the Slytherin's odd behavior. He didn't know, and he didn't care that much. He just didn't want it to stop.
Malfoy thought about it for several moments before responding, pretending he was calm as ever. He decided to be half honest with him, at least for the time being. He couldn't blatantly lie about it since there were only a few explanations about his bodily reaction.
Meanwhile in the Great Hall, a muggleborn witch was waiting for her best friend. Hermione Granger rolled her eyes when she spotted him walking in the Great Hall. Harry really just physically couldn't stay out of trouble, could he? She thought.
"Don't finish that sentence Potter. I don't think Professor McGonagall will appreciate it" Malfoy said coldly, his left eye twitching slightly from irritation.
But Harry couldn't speak anymore. His face has become Weasley red.
Now there was no one except Sirius, and he as much as he appreciated him, it just wasn't the same talking to him like it was with his best friends.
Father was right, the Dark Lord will return and get rid of both of Potter's little friends, get rid of everyone in the way, every single last mudblood and traitor that stole the future he wanted all his life.
He continued even more annoyed.
Yes,he
The blonde didn't have half a mind to respond.
The brunette let his hands fall to his lap to look at the blonde's face, his blue grey eyes dark, his usually pale pointed cheeks now flushed and his breathing quick as he said with furrowed brows, now less than foot separating their faces.
"It has come to my attention that the fights between you two are only getting worse as time passes by if your friends' late visit to the Hospital Wing by your very spells means someone" to that her eyes sharpened even more, making her look more like her animagus form.
"Mr. Filch," she addressed the excited caretaker as the two standing boys looked at her anxiously.
The small writting still said as the Gryffindor quickly made his way to the Hospital Wing.
He couldn't help but replay what happened before in his head, feeling himself stirring up again before he cursed himself and the Gryffindor.
He either had to reveal himself or Madam Pomfrey would come back, probably do a Human detecting spell of some sort and find him here instead of the Great Hall, freak out and he'd get even more detention, and probably his Cloak confiscated.
"Thank Merlin Voldemort hasn't killed me yet, so I could live to see Draco Malfoy, who has the perfect grades, worry about a stupid degree" Harry jokingly said finally looking at Draco, still wanting nothing but helping him feel better.
"Harry, have you been practicing your Silencing Spell lately? It may come useful in the first task" she pointed out tiredly.
"I wanted to see if your stupid mop of hair could be tamed, don't be so sore Potter" Malfoy said to Potter's back now as he pretended like it wasn't just an excuse to touch Potter's hair to see what would happen.
Harry woke up drenched in sweat. He saw the usual dream he had been seeing for months. A windowless corridor leading to the black door but, as he had been used to waking up before he could open the door, he looked on his right and saw Malfoy.
Harry wasn't exactly comfortable with how close the other was m, but he also didn't want him to get away necessarily. He didn't remember ever calling Malfoy by his first name or being called Harry by him.
"P-Porter, Will you makemethe happiest man alive and, and marry me?"
"Oh, um, Hermione?" Harry asked carefully as he imagined how boring it must be for the git to sit on his bed all day long.
The boys stepped inside the musky office and obliged to Filch telling them to take a seat facing the smirking caretaker who couldn't wait to punish some 14 year olds for some reason.
He asked tiredly. His whole body was hurting, his head was killing him and his legs felt heavier than ever. He thought of just going back to sleep, but he remembered how that Christmas day escalated and blinked rapidly to not fall asleep again.
"I don't think Malfoy would be genuinely doing that for being nice, that git must have some kind of bloody plan I know it Harry" the redhead said
Draco thought as he stared at the other's back, watching as it expanded a bit and then shrinked alongside his breathing.
11 year old Draco would be giggling like mad because he'd have the chance to make the raven haired goblin "change sides" or whatever he would call it since McGonagall wanted them to be friends. Malfoy had to admit he could try to make him change sides before he was forced to brush that thought away by how desperately Potter tried to break the door, the Muggle way, not even using his wand.
He closed the door quietly before he finally let his eyes to linger on the blonde boy.
He had to find a way to rid himself of these dreams if he wanted to sleep properly again.
Malfoy would respond to the raven haired boy with something along the lines of 'Have you seen me in something else except this school robe Potter to know if my skin is really that pale all over?' but that would come of more flirtatious than mean, so he ignored it.
Allas, he still wanted to at least make sure the git was okay, so he folded the map again and made his way to the Gryffindor Tower uneventfully.
"Don't you have to go charm even more badges for our-lord-and-saviour-Cedric-Diggory since you everyone hates me so much!?"
"But who is it Do-" He was cut off by the loud crack of the elf's dissapperating, feeling more confused than he had already. He wasn't sure if he would be able to sleep that night. And he still had detention with Malfoy.
His eyes red, cheeks full of tears and Harry couldn't stand there and look Draco being like this
And, of course, that characteristically messy hair of his was easily recognisable after so many years of observing and teasing him.
She could only hope they'd be able to see it soon enough. The future holds so much pain for both of them, it will do them good to have each other.
The blonde didn't even dare to look up at him, now he was just looking at his boots lost in deep thought, his wand still out and now lazily pointing at his chest.
Harry finally understood what the blonde was trying to tell him.
"What in the absolute fu--"
"We're wizards you idiot, we can just dry our clothes after!" Draco said in an irritated tone but Harry saw him smiling. Draco now freed his chest and arms from his shirt and Harry was sure that his bottom half was already getting excited.
9:03 it read.
"After calling you all those mean names and saying all these bad things and fighting with you all these years and doing all those things to your friends,
"I-I,, Thank y-you H-H-Harry" The blonde said the last part more lowly, finally looking at him in the eye, reminding the Gryffindor of a scared kitten ready to flee at any moment from danger.
are you treating me this way!? After all the things I've done and said to you and Hermione and Ron!?"
Draco knew it was stupid to just stare at the doors, hoping Harry Potter, the only survivor of the Killing curse, the Fourth champion of the Triwizard Tournament, the youngest Seeker of the Century, the boy who slipped from the hands of the Dark Lord again and again to look at
Draco spat out, his anger and anguish more targeted to himself than Harry, still not daring to look the Gryffindor in the eye.
"Don't Potter, or we'll both end up in trouble by Snape" the Slithering Prince whispered to Harry's ear and he listened. Harry could have sworn he had heard venom in his voice, but he didn't care. He could feel his face flush redder than it should not from anger, but because Malfoy was still held his arm for a bit ,even when Harry had calmed down. Malfoy seemed to notice it and let go of Harry's arm and turning around to not face the Griffindor.
He glanced at the pile of broken chair pieces and the blackboard hanging from a single screw from behind his hands. He couldn't face the person he almost killed.
He wasn't used to Malfoy having feelings.
I'm really sorry for not uploading earlier, my mental health is greatly affecting my writting progress and my motivation, so I didn't really know how to continue the story because I have the basic structural points of it but it needs a lot of fleshing out, please mind the tags again I have updated them
The brunette pulled out his map and started looking for him as the faint echoes of Myrtle's wailing could be heard from the pipes.
"Professor McGonagall will be here soon, finally, Dumbledore might let me hang you two upside down from the ceiling like the good ol' times. Dueling in the corridors isn't a light crime afterall…"
Malfoy said with a venom dripping smirk.
This is almost double the length of my usual chapters, PLEASE MIND THE TAGS!!! I will be updating them, have a good day!
"Professor Mcgonagall, wait--" Filch tried to beg her to let him punish them way worse but the animagus had already left.
"Why don't you swim a bit Harry? The water is really nice you know" Draco asked his companion that was just standing still near him.
Harry didn't care about the insults thrown at him, he had lost his voice as his eyes were now seemingly glued to the blonde's face instead of his groin, the mere confusion and terror of the whole situation overtaking him.
Could he have had a change of tune?
Harry gave him a small smile before taking out his wand to start trying to conjure his Patronus.
"I did not expect the Boy Wonder to be so incredibly insecure" he said maliciously "You'd think all those people fanboying over you for killing your parents would have gotten more into your head"
His eyes burning and his hand tightening and creasing the soft fabric over his heart, as if that would make his insides hurt less.
The blonde said while getting on his feet. Harry was frozen. He wanted to tell Draco he didn't want him to leave. He wanted to wrap his arms around him and comfront him. How could he had thought Malfoy was planning something evil up here?
He was sitting cross legged on the ground facing the door, his back half turned to him slumbly. He could see Potter's face, his lips slightly parted and his hair messy as ever as, his glasses sitting slightly lower on the bridge of his nose than they were intended to and his right arm supporting some of his weight. He looked strangely eery in the dimly lit classroom as he muttered the terrifying words to him.
images.
She had been pining after Draco for so long, almost as long as Blaise had been pining after her, and he wasn't going to see her get heart broken because Malfoy couldn't pretend at least he liked her back. And if he did break her heart, Blaise would make sure he regretted it. He didn't care about Malfoy's status, he would make that asshole pay.
Here, in the Hospital Wing, with him, instead of being in the Great Hall eating lunch.
Even at a moment of such humiliation and embarrasment, Harry couldn't help but admire him. Still, he had to do something, he had to leave from there before the little self vanity he had disappeared from sight.
Harry looked at the map for a few moments before running to the girl's bathroom on the first floor. He needed a quiet place to think, which now that he thought about it, didn't fit the description of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom at all, but he could work with it.
Hermione scolded him but Harry didn't pay much attention to her. Malfoy's actions were far more confusing, so he tried to make sense of them.
Shit's about to go down y'all, I'm sorry
Draco Malfoy but...Harry couldn't understand why he did that. He looked over to the Slithering table and his eyes fell on a certain blonde. Draco's and his eyes met for a few seconds before the Slithering
"Is-is it truethat youcan canjure apatronus Harry?" He asked quietly as he remembered those third years that were whispering a few days ago in the halls something about Harry saving someone from dementors.
Harry told him in an ironic tone, attempting to bring the old Malfoy back up since he couldn't accept that Malfoy hadn't insulted him yet.
she added dramatically looking at Harry, as if he wasn't expecting this new approach having a twist for the worse.
Next thing he knew, he was getting up and gathering his things. He had to leave or he was worried he would curse every single person in that room and especially the maker of these stupid badges, fucking Dr-, Malfoy himself.
"Potter, I swear on every last galleon that's inside the Malfoy vault I will leave you infertile with my boot the next time you try to kick down this door the Muggle way" The blonde boy snapped at The Boy Who Lived.
" he said with a smile, looking at now Harry's slowly turning redder face. Harry sat down next to him, unable to look at Draco's face, knowing it was too tempting to hug the Slitherin.
"Draco, you genius!! Of course!! I can send a message with my Patronus to McGonagall for help!!!" Harry almost shouted as he mindlessly hugged the other boy from his excitement.
The old man ushered them out furiously from the lack of traumatic torture towards students yet again.
think that! He's Draco
In the bed next to him was none other than Harry Potter himself, seemingly fast asleep.
He didn't know what to do or how to feel about it
"I bet you'd love to see what's behind the door, huh Potter?" He said, his voice dripping poison.
"After all these things I've done, it's the only way I can make up for it al-
Harry wanted to talk to him. He wanted to ask him why he was crying. He wanted to know if someone hurt him.B he had no words.
"But wait, why were you hiding behind the tree Dobby? And how did you know where I was actually?" Harry asked as he thought about it better. Why would he be hiding? Could he be spying at Harry?
What the raven haired boy also didn't know was that he was currently being watched.
"He'll be alright missing for a few hours Pans, he's got his hatred for every living being to keep him warm" Zambini said in a sing-songy way. He really couldn't care less for who Malfoy was probably snogging right now, as long as he didn't hurt Pansy's feelings he could ass-fuck that Hippogriff for his arm all he wanted.
There was something warm in the blonde's eyes, something about how his hair was falling softly on his face, something about how lean and delicate his fingers were wrapped around his wrists, something sweet about how his first name sounded falling from his lips, and Harry wished in some twisted fashion that Malfoy was always like this.
He was doing his best to imagine non sexual images, but it was all in vain. He was so concentrated on trying to control his hormones he didn't hear what Draco muttered hesitantly against his shirt.
Harry looked up from his plate now filled with food by Hermione and spotted the pale blond boy, his facade up but his eyes betraying him as they flickered around the room, like he was worried he would get attacked at any moment. Thank Merlin for his Malfoy genes, he internally thought, it made him almost too easy to spot.
"A-Are you sure Malfoy? Our, relationship you could say is more than complicated…" Harry asked him quietly. He wasn't used to this Malfoy, he was too calm and too not an asshole to last for long. And when Malfoy was back to normal, because he would be with the help of Madam Pomfrey, he would kill him for all this mess, Harry was sure.
Hey, I'm sorry for taking so many days to upload, I was planning on posting two chapters where we see some of Draco's past, but decided against it since I'd like to do more research on the topics to portray them correctly. Anyways, here's some  ~ g a y ~ for you because I love these two
"Oh Brilliant! Yet Another spell to put on my list on 'How Not To Die In The First Ten Minutes Of The First Task Like Malfoy Hoped', Thank you Hermione" Harry loudly whispered more bitterly than he had ever intended. All that thinking about that blonde git was making his head ache in a not pleasant way. Still, he shouldn't have talked to Hermione like that as the bushy haired witch stood up, looked at him with fire in her eyes and chewed out the following words
4. Potter was kneeled next to his torso too close
Without breaking his gaze towards the seemingly empty room, he used his hands to look for his wand.
"Look, I was acting really shitty yesterday to you, and you didn't deserve that at all, I was overwhelmed by some things that happened between me and Malfoy earlier that morning and I was too careless about who heard my complaints. I'm sorry Hermione" he gasped for air after he said it all.
"Please
But still, there was no way Dr- Malfoy, was aroused by them fighting, right?
Harry was pacing away from the library after hearing Ron complain once more about Krum. The first task was in 6 days and Ron still didn't believe him when he said he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire
He was out of the door before the blonde could stop him.
she looked sternly yet again at Malfoy that was using his self control she talked earlier to not start spewing insults at her for daring to compare him to the Gryffindork.
Harry Potter, the boy he had tormented all these years, had come to the Hospital Wing to see if he was okay.
As much of a hero complex he had, and as much of an idiot he was, Harry gave good hugs, that's something he could admit….To himself at least.
He still hoped, even if it seemed hopeless.
"It's just that… I don't know what's happening in my life anymore…" Draco broke the silence.
"Potter, you have to calm down" Malfoy said quietly, all his confidence evaporating. He wasn't looking at Potter, and unfortunately it just made the Gryffindor even more furious at him.
An annoyed look on his face that hid something between confusion and embarrassment, Harry Potter entered the Great Hall.
"Friends" he said.
r, I'
Malfoy flinched, at the sound of his name coming from Harry's mouth, but calling Malfoy "Draco" didn't feel weird to the Griffindor.
Hey, I'm the writer of this fic. If you're enjoying it, please leave a comment telling me your thoughts and what I can improve. I'll try to update weekly, but my mental state isn't nowhere near as good so I can't be 100% sure about it
But Draco didn't hex Harry...
The Gryffindor felt his cheeks burning as he tried to think of a lie to tell her, but all he could think was how nice it was to wrap his arms around Draco's lean torso and how good his cologne smelled and--
The lake looked thick like soap that 18th of November, but Harry was more concentrated on breaking twigs under the shadow of a tree to care. He would use his wand, but it wouldn't work as good to relieve his nerves.
Harry felt his eyelids burning like fire, he was sure that if he could see his face, it would be painted crimson by all the overwhelming sensations.
Maybe it was how tired he was, or maybe it was something else that made Malfoy that moment want more than anything to make the Gryffindor chuckle like this every day, to see his eyes shine and his adam's apple bob and his messy hair to gently touch his face and Merlin--
The blonde this time couldn't catch himself soon enough and like a startled cat he fell from his bed and onto the cold tiles with a fairly loud thud.
are you still nice towards me!??"
Nevertheless, he got up and started dressing while Ron was just starting to wake up. He would give anything to stay in bed to avoid seeing Malfoy but he knew it wouldn't end well. His homework was already piling up again.
Draco still hadn't told Harry where he was taking him, and all Harry could do was speculate. Well, that was until he saw a familiar door with the sign of
Malfoy really didn't want to see what was going to happen if this continued on.
"Aw come on Ron! You heard Harry, I think it's somewhat genuine. I mean, Harry, only
he wouldn't want you to get in troubl-"
She missed Ron, but there was no way she was going to admit it. So she just gritted her teeth every time she saw him to stop herself from shouting at him at how stupid he was being, and many other things Hermione hadn't come to terms with herself yet and certainly wasn't ready to say out loud, especially in front of the crowd that will have probably formed by now around them.
The brunette sighed softly as he organized all his thoughts for the apology.
"Now no one talks to me and-d the Slytherins don't exactly
Harry almost giggled from the emotional exhaustion, the previous emotions crashing over him again. Hermione was still furious at him and Ron would rather puke slugs again than care for him.
He didn't seem exactly good, but he could be worse, although Harry had to admit that the ruffled hair look suited him a lot.
Chapter 1: What happened to Malfoy?
Harry had hugged him in an attempt to stop his self-hating speech, and the silence from the blonde's side seemed to prove he did the right thing, since now he was trying not to go on full panic mode because
How did this even happened?
They soon ended up on the floor with a look thud, Malfoy getting the upper hand from his sitting position on Harry's stomach and punching him, throwing his glasses off his face, both panting and flushed.
How was Harry supposed to be friends with someone like this? Someone so close minded and bad natured!?
"Eh... thanks I-I guess" He finally said.
Harry couldn't take it anymore. He buried his face in his hands as Draco
it that I'm like this s-so…"
-   and in the night they'd talk to each other about all kinds of stuff, from the silliest to the most important, and when Harry would fall asleep, Draco would secretly stay up a few minutes later staring in awe at him, before wrapping his arms around the other boy's waist and holding him close, and it would be so nice and--
"Dobby would never spy on Harry Potter! Dobby was looking out for Harry Potter because someone was worried about him!" Dobby said strangely confident in that someone.
"S-So"
Hopefully it's just the change of environment that made him remember more of that day everytime he fell asleep, after all, he wasn't used to spending the night at the Hospital Wing, but something told him that this wasn't the case. He sighed, taking in his surroundings on more out of boredom, just wanting to forget what happened then.
"And also no picking on each other" she said now looking at Malfoy sternly since she knew he was usually the reason they fought in the first place.
Harry finally managed to say,while grabbing Malfoy's wrist. Draco had almost walked out of the room when he looked back at Harry's emerald eyes.
When he heard the name Cho Chang, he remembered different moments of her, Cho eating a croissant, Cho on the Quidditch field holding her broomstick, Cho catching the snitch, Cho looking at him, Cho smiling at him, Cho talking to him.
would get in trouble if Snape heard, Malfoy would get away with it. He said it because he didn't want
The brunette snapped out of his trance and lied quickly "W-Well, he was more civil than usual so that confused me because he's an arse but if he wasn't an arse anymore he wouldn't be too bad to hang around with and d-d-do stuff with, you know?"
"Malfoy…" Potter said quietly as if it was just another name, as if it didn't carry the dozens of fights and insults they had thrown to each other, and the blonde snapped back to reality to look at him.
Potter let out a long sigh as he felt his eyes burning and tears starting to form.
She stared at the brunette as he sat next to Collin facing the Slytherin table. Ronald was too caught up being mad at Harry for no reason to sit close to them.
Harry grunted as he picked up his things from the ground. He just realized he would have to finish his homework by himself
Because there is a reason why when Pandora's box was opened and all the evil of the world escaped at the very bottom there was Hope.
"What, Potter? Your pea sized brain still can't comprehend that you were outmatched again?" The blonde said as his voice cracked a bit, probably as he had by now understood his situation and was hoping the other boy hadn't noticed, his face pale again.
She glimpsed at the box full of the well-kept chains then back at the two students.
“Yes, both. Yeah.” Harry felt flushed and was sure his brown skin would be stained red.
“Oh, just say, ‘Hey, Draco, I know we just met, but I’ve been staring at you all week and I think you’re the most gorgeous bloke I’ve ever seen, so do you wanna date me?’ He’ll think I’m insane!” Harry knew his cheeks would be flushed crimson by this point.
“Draco? Draco Malfoy?” Hermione frowned a little.
“I need to go-” Hermione started, before both me and Ron cut in simultaneously.
Once only his pyjamas were left in his trunk, Draco removed his shoes, socks and trousers and climbed up onto his bed, taking out his mobile phone. He’d finally managed to get the runic sequence right to keep it charged, connected to the internet and functioning around the high levels of magic after a month of testing and almost 20 broken phones.
I hate my father. Separate point.”
"Harry, look at me." Draco's voice left no room for argument, so Harry looked up. "You have absolutely nothing to be sorry about. I love you, and I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to let me look after you, okay?"
Harry felt his eyes prick with tears and he turned, hugging Sirius hard. “Thank you.” He whispered against his shoulder.
As the curse travelled up the boy’s arm, Draco smirked at him and said “You should probably stop that soon, wouldn’t want to have to deal with the Aurors just yet.”
“And who the fuck are you?” Harry knew he must be coming across as a bastard, but he couldn’t bring himself to care- this was too much. He dug his thumbs into his temples and closed his eyes.
“Don’t know.”
“Fine, then what’s the name you was given when you was born?” Flint huffed, irritated.
As he made his way through the doors, he saw a group of students crowding around who Harry was certain was the most attractive person he’d ever seen. The boy was tall, slender and blond, with sharp, aristocratic features and plush-looking lips. He had headphones on, but one of the boys crowding him, another blond but this one far less attractive, pulled them off and threw them to the ground.
Once in his room, Harry finally let Draco put him down and ran to change into pyjamas. Before he went into his bathroom he turned and looked up at Draco, his big eyes pleading. "C"n you stay? Pwease?"
“So, Harry, your father said you were interested in starting testosterone?” Sirius beamed from beside him when he was referred to as such, placing his hand on Harry’s back proudly.
Draco shot him a watery smile and nodded. “Thanks.”
“Malfoy. Truce?” He held out one square, brown hand in front of himself.
Harry froze. He was knelt on the hearth at Grimmauld Place, his head in the floo. “Is Teddy...?” He couldn’t even verbalize his terror at the idea of his godson being gone too, and only a day after both of his parents’ deaths.
"Well, yes, as long as it's okay with him. He might one day want to find a proper caregiver, but until then I suppose, provided he doesn't mind, we will watch out for him."
“Why are we in Malfoy’s room?”
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled to himself. “Why don’t you sit with me in class from now on and if you need me to do anything just let me know?”
“Harry. Its good that you’re here.” Kingsley’s deep voice cut through the fog in his head, as calming as the first time they had met.
Draco was horrified. “Your relatives didn’t feed you?”
"'fink so." Harry's voice was childlike and confused. "'s that bad?" He turned back to look up at Hermione, his eyes scared. "'m I bad?"
"Yes, according to their listing, they keep the outside fairly bland so that littles aren't outed if people see them going in."
Harry then goes up to the room of requirements to prepare his plan.
Draco takes a bite of the meat loaf and closes his eyes as his mouth is filled with the beautiful savory bliss of explosion in his mouth.
"He has him…" Atticus sputtered
"So why aren't you at the dance with your friends? Surely you didn't just leave your girlfriend to dance alone?"
“I’d love that Harry, and you can be like another uncle to my kids, even though they already have real uncles and an Aunt.”
Draco grins and starts rocking his hips up into him but for the most part allows Harry to keep control of the tempo and speed.
Harry exited as well to continue his search for Draco.
"Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom." Neville blushes as he glances over at Hermione.
Harry reached and took the cup without a word. And after some hesitation he drinks it.
She bought a black leather leash, and two dog bowls with his name on them.
The blonde goes to the pantry and pulls out a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, and pours them both glasses before setting the bottle in the center of the table.
Walking over Draco asked "what's your safe word?"
"Won't be the first time you killed your own family." Draco responded.
analy.
Looking to Train a young man to one day take over Ollivanders.
Draco did not have long to wait before in walks potter wearing a robe, once hes in he drops the robe revealing hes wearing the sexy elf costume Draco had sent him to wear for their evening together.
“No, you idiot, Of course I want you. That’s the problem! I want you but your never really here..your always going to that Apprenticeship and then when you come home, you go right to bed. I never see you, and I’ve been having to juggle four kids all by myself. When I was pregnant I always imagined my husband would be at my side, helping me raise our family.”
Draco looks at Harry who was exhausted.
Pulling his hand free he graps Harry's hips and in one movement slams deep into Harry right as the first firework went off overhead.
It was Lucius Malfoy
Draco knew there was more to the situation then what was being revealed.
In that moment Draco felt as if the world around him had crashed.
The idea made Harry sad. As he stayed he had taken over the nurses job of bathing and taking care of Draco. Kissing him softly whenever he could sneak one in hoping, praying to Merlin that a kiss would help bring him back to him.
"Professor if you really love Petunia then go for it..i know she's been lonely and hurt since she dumped Vernon..I think you'd be great for her If Dudley approves."
"Harry, Harry wake up." He's whispering.
"Ladies, And Gentleman As Minister I have an announcement a new Law that has been set that will affect each of our new graduates tonight.
Draco cocked an eyebrow.
Upon popping themselves to the field, they paid the muggles for the use of the campsite before setting up their tent in a chosen spot.
"I have no idea what you mean!" The man cries completely surprised by the visit.
Draco shook his head.
Harry grins, and uses his wand to send the groceries to the house.
Scared that Draco might never wake. What if his heart just stopped? And never wakes up? Harry thought.
Now he'd never get to see Ron or Hermione ever again. And now he'll never get the chance to get up the courage to tell Draco how he really secretly felt. Would never get the chance to ask him out.
"Prepare for death by a thousand cuts." Lucius grins
He couldn’t figure out why Harry was acting this way towards him, and often the blonde would find himself crying in frustration while at work cause he worried that his marriage was slowly starting to fall apart into shambles.
Draco closes the gap between the two of them on the couch.
Finally everyone was seated and waiting with baited breath. As the minister stood and approached the Goblet, where the first slip of paper was waiting to name the first arranged marriage.
They eat their breakfast and suddenly eager to see her pregnant as soon as possible, he carries her to bed where he makes quick work of pounding her into the mattress extra hard before they both drift off once more.
As the months went by and the bump continues to grow, the happier they continued to be but then one night Hermione woke up to her bed soaked and a pain in her lower abdomen.
And with one hand he guides himself into the hole of Harry's boxers and thrusts deep into Harry.
Feeling his eyes open, he could hardly contain himself from screaming, at the pain from his back.
He was smiling and laying shirtless in the sun by the lake in just a pair of shorts.
At eight months pregnant Harry woke up with a cry of pain, effectively waking Draco.
Fuck the other kids here, fuck my father nothing else matters but what we want from each other."
He would hold her when ever she was worried or nervous and tell her everything was going to be okay, and that their daughter was strong and would flourish now, that there was nothing to worry about now, that it was okay for her to rest while he watched.
But yet Harry had just watched him try to protect him.
Harry hurried up to his room and pocketed his wand, his cloak. Only taking the items he could carry or couldn't part with. Harry left a note telling Ron he could have the rest. That he'd write to him but only once settled.
Draco would have smiled. These guys sure loved Harry..and he felt it was awesome how they'd drop everything to go on a manhunt to find him. But he was too scared for any smile to appear.
“It’s going good. Neville’s at work at the moment, I don’t have to go anyone till later tonight.”
Harry spun his wand, and felt anxiety hit as it came to a stop.
Would Albus hunt him? And force him?
He proceeded to start cutting Harry, starting with his arms, his legs then his back.
Draco persed his lips as he tried to think if he had remembered Harry being off at all. Examining his memory of yesterday for any signs he'd missed that this was coming.
“oh, little miss Gotta play by the rules, and must know everything has her kinks huh.”
Everyone stopped talking and turned to Harry.
“How are you feeling Harry?” Draco asked, looking him over.
"ok in my jean pocket there's a piece of paper please put it on the dresser. With read me facing the door." Harry instructed.
Harry nodded thinking about the baby and the likly hood of Voldemort getting to it. The Dursleys would never accept the baby, and Lucius would train the child to be a death eater and Voldemort follower. Harry knew Draco was right.
Harry hears the heavy thud of footsteps approaching the cell, Harry feels fear slice through his chest as a tall man comes into view.
Neville cracked a grin.
Harry whines a bit.
Walking onto the Docks he starts asking around for a Ship heading back out to find options on where to go. One that would be far enough.
He slowly fell into an uncomfortable sleep tossing and turning trying to not think about the woman beside him.
Draco groaned "can it wait?" He grumbled.
Upon perusing the fridge and cabinets they found it basically almost bare bones. Some of which were in need of the trash.
The woman nods “Thank you Harry, I’m about six months along.”
All kinds of scenarios flirted through Draco's mind. Had Harry decided he didn't wanna be with him and run away?
Harry nodded beaming brightly, “that we are, and I wanted to ask you if you’d be interested in being their Godmother, I already asked Ron to be Godfather but I want our children to have both. After the incident with Lucius, in case anything ever happens to me and Draco, I need someone that can make sure that my kids are safe and secure.”
Harry loved the reaction his mouth pulled from Draco.
Neville had tears flowing down his face in pure joy as the words left Hermione’s mouth.
"Nothing, I just love how happy this job seems to have made you, the way you talk about it is just amazing." Harry responds as he's feeding Sevy.
Draco greatly enjoyed himself as Ollivander guided Draco’s hands a few times in the process so that Draco could learn how to do it by doing it with his own hands.
"Fuck them..fuck what they think. Don't let other people keep you from being happy. If you want a real relationship with me then lets make it happen. I want the same thing. When I chose to take what you offered I was very obviously making you Mine. I refuse to let go of what i want now that its on my grasp.
As he stood there a plan formed in his mind, he woukd run away from Hogwarts, Run away from the wizarding world forever.
By the time we reached the chamber, Lucius And Draco were locked in a wizard's dual, trading spells, Draco didn't care how much Lucius hurt him, all he cared about was protecting You.
Harry kept his mouth shut even though he wanted so badly to scream. He felt blood running down his back as the cuts continued.
The name Celina was a latin name meaning strong warrior and they felt that their little girl really was a warrior cause of her fighting spirit.
Harry had no idea why but as Draco uttered those words he couldn't help but believe him.
"There was no other boys. I never did anything with anyone."
She hesitates and looks at Harry who nods..the nurse smiled.
Harry was horny and getting hotter with need by the minute.
Harry and Draco had quickly made an emergency to go bag with enough items to dress their babies to bring home in.
They chatted in the lobby for a few hours before Snape mumbled something about going to meet Petunia for a dr appointment.
There was Hot Apple Cider being freely given to passersby to keep them warm in the cold. The beverage had a heating potion added to give drinkers that extra heat.
"Well Potter not half bad for a Gryffindor." Draco smirked.
"I have a solution for your problem, How would you like to work here? I would train you in how to run this place, and when you are ready I will give you ownership of The Leaky Cauldron and it'll be yours, so I can finally retire."
If he gave up now, there would be nothing to stop Lucius from killing Harry.
Hermione climbed onto his lap taking his cock in her hands she rubs his head against her clit, before finally sliding down burying him deep down inside her slick heat.
"Trying to imagine what my wife will look like pregnant." He admits.
"Draco! You're awake!" Harry gasped.
“Harry? Harry? Are you okay?” Draco calls out as he opened the door.
Harry beams happily as he hugs her back.
He looks around the room hoping to catch his Boyfriend's eyes. But moticed he was missing from the slytherin table.
When the goblet was brought out he'd been so sick with fear the goblet would separate them and assign them both someone else.
If living as a student with Malfoy was indicative what would life as his Husband be like?
Trying not to think about how nice that hand on his butt felt he very carefully moved the hand before getting out of bed to go find some breakfast. Finding the kitchen still bare he wakes Draco.
Draco stares at Harry in awe.
Ron and Hermione glance at each other surprised.
Then tells them about the baby he's carrying.
First he appearates to Ron and Luna's house,he knew he couldn't go to the death eaters houses alone. He would need back up and when it came to Harry who better to help then Harry's best friends.
He needed to be a good husband and find something suitable to provide well for his wife and future kids. He didn't want his kids growing up the way he had grown up.
He grabs the note and opens it to read..
Here Lucius strapped Harry on his stomach, so that his back was displayed to the ceiling, to a metal table that had straps that held his hands and feet completely locked down.
Harry gives more groans as Draco grows more at ease with the set up enjoying the different tones of  sounds Harry made.
Sirius
"I swear I don't know who you are looking or where he is, I've reformed I swear."
Even then she’d wake constantly to come check on her as if afraid something bad could happen in the time it took for her to rest.
"Im Porter,
“I got you a present.”
"What are you suggesting Draco?" Harry asked.
When the nurse comes in shes at first shocked, pissed and then laughing at the sight.
We got lost in the house trying to figure what room, you guys were in.
Lucius lights an iron stick with fire, and uses it to touch Harry's chest, pressing the red hot iron to the boy's skin.
She removed the ring before taking the shaft down her throat, and starts bobbing her head making his cock fuck her mouth.
"What is it Harry?" Draco asked.
Luna wrinkled her nose "I doubt it'll be a sexy look."
Harry was starting to get overly sensitive lately. Draco caught Harry crying one day, because Ron had sent Harry a picture of their little boy, Tanner.
She reckoned the goblet could have married her with someone worse of course like one of the guys from Slytherin. At least Neville would never be cruel to her.
As he feels himself starting to blink awake..
They walk to the leaky cauldron, pass through the brick wall with him walking on all fours.
"I've missed you both. But understand I love Draco..and that's not going to change."
The little creature appears "Mr. Harry Potter how can I be of service?"
Shacklebolt conjures up marriage certificates for them to sign then opens a box in front of them revealing two simple gold bands. Once both wore the rings. Another minister leads the newly wedded couple outside.
She set a dog bed in every room, one by the dining room chair, one by the desk where Hermione worked, and another in the living room in front of the sofa and another in the bedroom.
Draco nods as the two of them start to head home.
Harry though.. he tried, kept blinking awake, the pain in his body too much for him to really sleep.
And he appariated too Malfoy Manor but then took off, he had run so far ahead we couldn't catch up to yall.
Harry paused concerned. They were Prefects had they ratted him out? Where they going to take points from Harry on Christmas?
A familiar voice spoke
The wand was point at Malfoy.
Harry smiles down at his cousin’s kids.
"I did it, I finally did it." He cries as he transitions back.
I'm going to stay in here with you, so go ahead and go back to sleep. I got your back Harry." He assured him.
For days Harry’s attitude towards Draco continues to get worst, and worst to the point Harry was snapping at him over the tiniest thing like leaving a sock or his shoes on the floor, but would go back to silent treatment right after, making Draco concerned.
“They.” Draco looked up, initially confused but then his brow smoothed.
Ron, noticing, put down the pile of shoe boxes he'd been carrying and walked over to Harry, wrapping one arm around his skinny shoulders. "You can get whatever you want, mate. It's alright." He reassured him.
“Y-yes, that might be a good idea.” He muttered, shaking out his left hand.
“Father, I have some things to tell you.” Draco shifted in his seat. “Firstly, I’ll never be moving back into the manor. It holds too many memories of the war for me to be able to stay here again. Also, my therapist recommended I get tested for autism, and mother helped with my testing and I have a diagnosis for it now. I chose not to tell you until it was all sorted out, as I know you are unhappy with my choice to see a muggleborn therapist, and I knew you would try to prevent me from getting a diagnosis that is almost unheard of in wizarding circles. And finally, I’m gay, and so the marriage contract I know you’ve been working on with Mr Greengrass for me and Astoria will never be signed, as if I do choose to marry it will be with another man.” He knew he was speaking too quickly, but he just had to get it all out before he could back out. As soon as he finished speaking, he slumped back into the chair and looked over at his mother. She smiled at him supportively.
