Now I could hear the beating of the rain and the rattle of wildlife, yet it was distant. Had I possibly been twisting the sounds of rain on glass for Harry's screams? The squeaks of animals for Bella's voice? Whipping of trees for the cracks of twigs. "It seems I experienced a stress dream." My tone was plain but I was forced to change my answer a few seconds later "Fine, a nightmare, I was having a nightmare." Lucius smiled at my newfound honestly and waves his hand as a bath began to run for me. "But I can't tell what it was about, to be honest."
Sitting down on one of the beds I waited as Draco slowly walked around the room before sitting on the bed opposite me, "Harry, you remember how in the holidays I went to tell you something but said that I'd tell you at school?" I nodded, of course, I remembered, it was after I'd met his 'cousins'.
I rocked Draco in my lap as his sobs subsided and he slowly moved his hand and ran into the bathroom, then came straight out with a black eye patch with a lily petal on it. I continued carefully as Draco was still sniffling, "Hey Draco, I was thinking about what you said yearstday." He turned and looked at me "Okay, he says carefully." I smile before continuing "You sounded like you'd seen what you were talking about, I was just wondering. What did you see or hear, if anything?" Draco looked perfectly fine with the question and answered calmly "Oh, well a small thing that not many people know about me is that I'm older than the average second year. I should be in my sixth year but my parents with my person did a ritual that made me look younger than I am, so I saw every single Death Eater meeting, I've seen and watched the murder of hundreds of muggles and 'blood traitor's' that I could." I blinked and sat on the bed, Draco sat down next to me
A genuine smile spread across her face, "Lucius allowed me to wear it, it was a gift from his sister in law to me, I never wore it, however." She had another one, but she wouldn't wear that without Tom's permission. "So where is the Emperor?"
When dinner was over I found myself staring up at the night sky, worrying for once not about myself or the events in a short few hours; I was worried about Harry, but not in a sense of his health and state of mind were making me panic, rather I was worried about how he would cope with Remus' change. It was never something we spoke about since it was rude to speak about one the Elite when they weren't there, and I had seen some of the punishments they gave for such a thing. Even Harry and I being Imperial concubines did almost nothing in terms of protection.
I saw Draco's wide eyes blink at me, "I-Could I tell you something later?" I nodded and patted down his hair, as he leaned into me, smiling wildly, I could tell that Ron and Hermione were nervous as hell, but what they didn't know was that Draco  was more afraid of them, I ran my hand through his pale hair, attempting to calm him down, at least enough to talk. It worked, for about fifteen minutes. Soon we were making the same path we had been since the start of the year, as we were doing our respective bedtime routines, and got into the bed, the second one not really begin used very often. We slid back into our usual sleeping arrangement, with Draco, curled into me as I wrap my arms around him.
My only wish was that Enalie had known just how soon, it had been twenty minutes since our teacher had left us. We felt seven sharp pluses ripple through the school, seeming to hit a northern wall. Our Class Head, a girl I didn't know the name of, had placed our potions on stasis.
I haven't told Draco about the voice in my head, mainly because it doesn't do much and when it does it makes me feel happy. Like humming to me currently or telling me that everything will be okay when I was five. Why would I worry anyone with that?
Harry cautiously took a few steps forward I looked up at him, I was slightly annoyed that his shoes made him a bit taller, but now was not the time for that. "Draco why?" I couldn't answer as Professor McGonagall called us and the few other people into class.
Draco didn't know what he meant by that but it soon didn't matter. As with an hour ago Draco began to shut his eyes. He felt a sharp nail grab the tip of his tounge and pull it slightly. Slice. Curiously he opened his eyes "Keep them open, I know you want to watch." Oh how he wanted to call lier. But it was true.
She screamed as she felt a knife cut and mark her skin, she bubbled and begged for mercy, she bled out over the floor and the pain returned again on her other arm. She had two words cut into her skin. What they were she had no idea, bur death would be sweet and this pain was eternal.  The only reason Daffodil was so good at this was purely that this was the sort of play her and Lucius sometimes did together, although it was never really like this, his whips were made of leather or cotton, not twigs found outside, she was never chained, but rather held still with soft silk. And Lucius would never physically harm her, and she wouldn't do the same to him.
After a while, I told them that I wouldn't mind either way They smiled and Draco had fallen asleep reading and had laid his head on my chest.
After dinner, I nodded goodbye to Ron and Hermione and caught up with Draco and Pansy, "Are you guys okay?" I held Pansy's hand she smiled as we shut the door into the common room.
"Could I continue going to the same school I currently go to, doctor?" he nodded and smiled before helping me stand, he ended up completely picking me up "That can be arranged, so do you agree?" I held his robe and he carried me and nodded "Yes doctor."
I wanted to move, but I know I can't. My legs haven't moved in decades trapped in the same position since I can remember from my adult life. I can remember my childhood easily, joyful and happy, sweet like the children I can hear outside.
My eyes drop for the faintest of seconds before surface tension breaks and I'm back in the real world, not some fantastical dreamscape. I'm curled inside a thick towel, no doubt our own as temples are about the gift of nature and simplicities. My head rests on my uncle's warm beating chest, once again a lure, however this time into a state of sleep. Held tightly against Lucius I'm carried towards our sleeping chambers, where the next thing I feel is a warm bed and strong arms wrapped around me.
"Yes, Mistress?" Alice was a woman, she had a son who was snatched away from her. Her eyes were wide and almost mad, just like the Empress. Her body was small and beaten, she was used for the Empress' entertainment and pleasure.
When at last the rain stops and the wind is calm, do their birds continue singing and insects keep cricketing, I push against my uncle's chest I feel lighter maybe spontaneously crying did me some good. Noticing that he was still sleeping, I pressed a light kiss to his brow, with the ease of a cat I slipped out of the blankets and put on a cotton bathrobe. I must see for myself where we are.
Draco had said that he'd be fine with sitting with me and my friends after he magically changed into something, but I told him no straight out. So now I'm sat with Blaize and Pansy who knew something was up with him, to tell them that they were right was shattering. However as the train pulled up, I could see the ritual slowly wear off, although all I wanted to do was sleep when we got to Malfoy Manor "It's fine, my parents will tell us to go to sleep anyway, they know how tiring the train ride is." I smiled, mostly at knowing that I'll be treated like a human going to Draco's it calms me and I end up leaning on Draco and the window.
I nodded, not minding having to eat in the carriage or outside, I was merely just hungry, therefore I didn't care where we ate.  My uncle and Daffodil didn't either so they decided that we would eat outside, so for the second time that day we left our carriages for some fresh and clean air. From then on, the journey was as smooth as it could be. We all stayed in the same carriage for most of the day yes even Susan and Regulus who didn't do anything unless we called them over or they walked up to us by themselves. Which they sometimes did and that's how Regulus is now sleeping before dinner next to Daffodil.
"Well, my aunt and uncle say that I'm strange and not normal because I don't like girls." Draco looked back at me, as he doing up a tie, "What do you mean Harry? You're twelve, how?"
The driver had moved towards a back gate and pressed a button "That's a buzzer, it links up to the phone up above." I explained quietly to Draco, as we drove through the open agate and got let out. I helped Draco down from the step, and out of the car.
Imperial rank.  Draco returns after a month away, his parents have died, when he returned he didn’t feel like eating and was forced outside to breakfast.  Where he meets Harry and they look up to each other. 75 days of mourning start. A new character by the name of Daffodil is introduced.
"Please, I have no other person to turn to." It was pleading, in such a pleasing way. I wanted to help her just from her calm, oceanic voice, so woven and complex. Plus there was something so voluptuous about hearing someone of her standing speak in such a desperate, longing manner. I readily agreed to assist my dear sister. I offered her a chair and tea, to which she said that she wanted nothing more than an orange. Internally I questioned if it would be enough for her, she's rather lithe and small regardless but an orange simply couldn't feed her. I, of course, had heard of stories where concubines would fast for the morning period, to pay their respects to the dead. I can't imagine her doing such a thing though, Lucius would never let her besides the practice is thousands of years outdated.
I was right! Sitting in Chemistry, I was whispering with Andrew, he explained how his sisters Envy and Lust had dropped Potions in their first year, apparently, the teacher was afraid of them and wasn't very good, he had only just dropped the class, for their sake I hoped Severus understood.
I had a feeling that something bad had happened or was going to happen, to Draco I didn't realise that he was holding my hand until I felt something warm on my neck. "My father told me to stay with you! Oh and your neck's bleeding." Draco said timidly and whispered the last part, it was then that I saw the shattered pattern in his eyes and the cracks in his wrist
Dinner was quick and easy for us, we were given a bowl of noddle soup with goblin made wine. Which they forbid me from having a few sips of, (they being both the staff and the adults around me) although even Regulus was denied more than a glass of the wine.
Okay! We have plot! I repeat we have plot! The rest of the story should go smoothly and back up to the coherent update schedule of the fourth of every month.
"Well, I'm glad that I could help you with that, if you need anything else, please come see me." She nodded and stood, plastering on a happy face and smile. It almost tricked me "One more thing, what's that around your neck? The Emperor did say no jewellery." She looked down at where the pendant rested, on her breast bone.
I turned around when I heard fast-paced footsteps behind me, smiling when I was Harry, walking towards him so he could slow down "When did you get a haircut? Is that even allowed?" He asked, standing beside me, not looking impressed when I shook my head, looping my arm in his as I started walking again. Walking both of us towards the lake.
"Draco, are your eyes okay?" I looked around the room towards my parents, and Sev, my mother stepped forward and began to hand me a mirror "Draco, honey Severus needed to replace your eyes if he hadn't you wouldn't have been able to see at all. I gave him two rings that used to belong to my mother, and my sister Andromeda, Severus did the spell so that you could see." I was handed the mirror and saw bright glowing lice blue topaz eyes, gems that were worth hundreds on their own. Add the fact that they were part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight made there worth almost quadruple there original worth, I began to cry I hoped that my tears would damage anything, "Dragon, there's no need to cry, we weren't going to place marble in your eye."
We do have a floo, once I accidentally fell into it and got spat out halfway through a privet meeting with the Dark Lord in my pyjamas and coffee. Draco and his parents plus one Dark Lord all turned around and looked at me. I was very embarrassed and told them all good morning before leaving. Draco couldn't stop laughing at me when he got back, we now have a fireplace guard so it doesn't happen again.
I've never felt cold water before, well I have just in small amounts like when washing my hands, but never like this. I held my breath not that I could for very long as something, someone brushed against my back. I stopped myself from screaming for my parents they weren't going to hear me, although if they were back then they might, I have no way of knowing that. "P-please leave me alone" I whispered to what seemed like no-one. I was losing my mind surely, no-one had replied. I felt it again.
"Please-" Alice begged her wrists chained and pulled tightly, the second after she spoke the twigs slashed at her palms again, making her cry out and sob. Snot fell from her nose, tears from her eyes, her hand was raw, red and bleeding. Yet the woman in front of her was restless. "I beg-" Speaking was useless, she was kicked to the floor by Daffodil's heel, her legs spread out wide. Alice whimpered and looked up at her torturer. Her clothes were damp and soiled. Daffodil had made her wash her hands with raw soap and water for the past one and a half hours, draining her arms of energy. She had answered all she could, even ratted out her own mistress when Daffodil had beat her with the twigged whip. Yet this wasn't enough.
When I opened the door and stepped on the grass I saw Narcissa sitting on a chair, I stopped mid-step as she turned around, I wasn't going to lie, she scared me. "Oh hello Stephine, I was actually wondering if I could ask you few questions, just to get to know you?" I swallowed and nodded, holding my arm behind my back before walking towards the table and sitting down in front of her.
"Terribly, of course, you were there during Hermione Granger's trial for attempted suicide and manslaughter," I remembered that it was when we had gone back I time to save Lupin, she had howled not thinking that he would follow so quickly. It almost killed both of us, when someone had mentioned that she punched Draco - unprovoked--in the face, the sentence was her wand being snapped but being allowed to go Hogwarts all Draco's idea. "But we never thought that it would have such lasting effects, the Light fraction are saying that we wrongly accused her, and a bit more people in the Grey/Neutral faction are on their side."
"I don't know how I feel," I told them, looking up at the two older and taller adults "I don't know how I should feel." I felt Lucius knelt down slightly and turn my head towards his, whispering something into my ear, before wrapping his arms around me, as Daffodil lightly kissed my temple. "Can we keep walking?" They both nod and hold my hands as we set off, letting our luggage be magically transported to our individual rooms.
." I smile and nod gently closing the door and taking a slice of cake when by Draco's side. He rolls his eyes and chuckles at me.
I woke up a little bit to pull the curtains shut with Magic, before falling asleep again. By this point though my uncle was beside me, sleeping soundly as well. I just felt the rising sun and didn't want to acknowledge it's existence. We still had another day to travel. My uncle had his arms wrapped around me and I had my legs around his own, this was how we normally slept expect this time my grip was tighter and his hand was on my back, supposedly soothing. My hips jerked forwards; a moan escaping my parted chapped lips. The vibrations of deep chuckle went straight up my hardened member. I gripped at the blanket with my hands and kept myself quiet to no avail. Small, thin and very wet; his tongue licked and lapped at my head eagerly swallowing down the pearls of precum that I could feel. His wicked and cruel tongue ran down the entire length of me, his slight choke made my hips thrush into his mouth further. Causing my ever collected uncle Lucius to swear and moan around my cock, the head already down his throat.
"I know, we don't have to follow it. I do however feel bad for Enlie and Theodora, they want their mother." I shook my head, yes I knew they did, so did Leviathan, but they had to deal with it. I also know that Leviathan can look up to Remus in a way.
I zoned out as Draco spoke to his friends, they sat around him, like a circle protecting him from the other Slytherins, mainly older years who don't get the hint and want a play-toy. I heard my name ghostly, as I felt a book hit my arm I heard Professor McGonagall yell my name "Yes?" I said after she yelled my name, we heard a small crack in the air "I didn't know her voice was that loud." Ron whispered to Hermione. "You need to go to Professor Snape's office after your second lesson." I nodded and went back to eating, out of the corner of my eye I saw Draco leave the hall. I went after him.
"I wanted to," I whispered in Lucius' ear, causing him to jump slightly and turn around to face me, grinning like a cat. He had obviously forgotten that he asked me a question about my hair. Lucius scowled a little at me but shook his head, I couldn't tell what he was annoyed by exactly. So to avoid making him have an outburst I left him to keep eating his lunch. Leaning towards Daffodil when she kept lightly messing with my hair to make it look neater as she mumbled, smiling happily the whole time until she finally stopped. Opposite us I heard Harry giggle to himself, watching me get fussed with, I sent him a playful glare that he stuck his the tip of his tongue out in reply.
It felt strange. Yes Draco was givien a while to adjust to the new feeling. What he once had total control over he had suddenly lost. It was unbelievable how easily he had got his head around it. "Don't worry, you be able to speak one language Draco." The way that was said... That's why Draco had been learning Parsletonge! He nodded and opened his mouth, licking his dry lips "I'll save you annoyences."
I ran and beat my small weak hands on the heavy door screaming to let me out, wishing for anyone to listen and unlock the door. Screaming for what seemed like hours, my throat felt horse and dry, my arms were tired and ached. I knew that it wasn't smart but I was scared. I heard the sound of footsteps faintly.
He was due to wake up in a few hours, the sun had risen "Morning sleepy-head" I said softly, he smiled painfully, he didn't want this, I knew that I knew that he didn't want to be alone with them. But I couldn't live without my parents, I knew it seems selfish and rude, but Harry understood that much. I hated not giving him a choice like I had done any other time.
He was silent as I came in. I was gently pulled next to him, he swept my night robe, or as the Emperor calls them costumes, off. I don't think I cuddled closer to anyone before. I don't know when but it was during the cricket's calls that I began to cry quietly. He rubbed my back comfortingly and didn't try to shush me. I knew that by morning the Emperor would call for the seventy-five days of mourning, which included everyone wearing white and not shaving facial hair. It was seventy-five days, not a hundred because we aren't part of the Imperial Family unless one of us bores the Emperor's first heir. My uncle was also silent, I have no doubt he was also upset, just maybe not as much as I was. This night was mostly sleepless and my pillow was wet with tears when we awoke to mourn bells being played loudly, over the City. Everyone would now know what fate had sentenced my parents to.
It was hot, crowded and stuffy. From the looks on their faces, they didn't like this as much as I did. It would be better when we got on the plane. "Where will we stay?" I glanced over at Mr Malfoy, who looked ready to kill the next muggle he saw.
He nodded, although clearly surprised "I'm happy to let you go back, as there's very little chance I could get you into Hogwarts, but I have two questions. Firstly, how would we get you to Ilvenmorny, and secondly why do they let you take magical classes?"
"Does it have anything to with Draco, sir?" Snape seemed surprised at my question or they fact that I called him 'sir' without needing to be reminded. I looked up at him from my hands, and looked around his office. His face suggested that I was right, and I was in major trouble. I could only hope that his parents wouldn't come out of the floo to yell at me. He and his friends started it in class, not us.
I nodded, I knew that he would, Harry would have asked. Either way, I smiled, Theo had a good point,  but he was wrong and I didn't want to think that Harry could be that good of a lier, he wasn't Uncle.  "Before you yell at me, I'm going to get Theo and Pansy to apologise to Granger." He raised his eyebrow at me, "What she said at breakfast hurt more, than anything I could say to her." I omitted what I looked like after our duel, Harry hadn't asked if I was okay, besides I'm fine now.
"My lovely younger sisters," Bella pruned with a sickly smile "How delightful it is to finally see you again." She sat down and I noticed her bush her hair off her gold-embroidered dress, practically showing her higher status off, which wasn't uncommon, so that wasn't what I was bothered with. I glanced towards where Harry was, seeing Remus wrap an arm around him as we all chorused a greeting towards her, I don't even know what I said, just repeating words I heard around me. When we were finally allowed to look up I didn't miss how Sirius had his head around Harry's neck, gently holding it up and Harry leaned towards Remus again; although at least now he could eat by himself. Sirius also caught Daffodils eyes and they both nodded to each other a little, they both hated Bella, that was the only way they got along.
In the most simple way, I've grouped chapters together based on what day they occurred on or if they were important enough to stand alone, therefore cutting this story just under half (I do apologise for the monster long chapter 3, I'll shorten it if you guys want it split up a little). To explain the changes I've made in detail I'll summarise the new chapters. Feel free to comment any questions you might have!
"Mr Potter, could I have a word, without your friends." I turned around to see Professor Snape standing in front of the 'Golden Trio' rolling my eyes at the absurd name I focused on what they were talking about.
A chapter that is important to the story, just not very well written I got writer's block halfway through.
I awake dripping in sweat, panting and Lucius prying the blanket from my death hold "Draco you'll lose all feeling to your hands if you continue like this." He snaps but it's the tone that doesn't suit the delivery. Reluctantly I let go and lean against him, pressing my forehead onto his cotton shirt "Now what's this all about?" Lucius was never a very emotional person towards me, I never expected this to change, but slowly I could tell it was. I shrugged and leaned on him more. "There's a storm outside, we've had to stop, we're in a temple and our things are fine."
A sweet lethal female voice emerged from a painting, she sounded a lot like Mother when she didn't like someone, only the Lady's voice seemed to promise death and suffering. I had never seen her before, but she sounded like she was from England. The way she was painted suggested that she must have been a Pureblood as the paint hadn't faded much despite other painting of her, her husband and son were old and worn. "Get out of my school, and never return."
We were sitting waiting for the gate to open. So we could board our flight. 15/16 hours in a plane. They had gotten first class of course. "My sister's an Auror, she's one of the best and youngest." I smiled, I knew that Draco wanted to be a healer. But he was immensely proud of her, just from the tone of his voice.
Draco blinked and smiled "Harry it's because they've seen what he can do and they know if he comes back he can do it again, just with more power. The wizarding world was torn by him, split into good people and Death Eaters and their families. The Dark Lord reigned with fear, it was impossible to escape him, those who tried were often found and killed or tortured. He wanted to be feared by everyone but his army and followers. And no-one stood a chance against him then, not even your parents, they would have been found or forced out of hiding sooner or later had they surivied. I'm sorry but it's the truth, you haven't seen it or dealt with it actually, with what he'd capable of. That's why no-one else calls him that." I was shocked at Draco's words, I wasn't expecting him to say all that, he looked at me then down "I'm sorry I brought up your parents Harry I really am but it's true." I smiled sadly "It's okay Draco, I've come to terms with my parents a long time ago, I still hate Halloween." I went to talk to him but he was fell asleep. Looking at the time my eyes widened 10:30 pm, "I should be getting to bed myself." I went to get up but Draco's arm stopped me "Please don't move." He said in his sleep-ridden state, rolling my eyes I just lay down and we fell asleep with our arms wrapped around each other.
They didn't look pleased and they both looked angry, I looked between them as Lucius continued the drive the car to a shopping centre in London. "Harry, we're not angry at you, I promise." I nodded as we got out of the car, Draco and Lucius blinking and trying to breath
We stayed like that, for a while Harry moving slightly as his arm eventually got numb, by the time we heard the bell signifying that we had an hour left of our curfew I was already asleep curled into Harry. I felt the removal of my robe and slowly be lifted into a bed, Harry was lucky that I was becoming more and more lightweight.
She laughed, turning her eyes towards her impermeable stone-faced parents. Honestly, do Lucius and Narcissa ever show complete emotion? "I hate to talk about it but how is the Ministry? Given the political war going in between England and MACUSA, obviously." Lucius sighed and looked years older within seconds, while her mother just sighed.
I bet that he'll have chosen Lady Parkinson. How she got through all the tests was unknown to me, as I was sure that her parents tried to marry her off to some older man before the Imperial Chariage got to Parkinson Manor. This plan failed as she is now the second concubine to the Emperor, and is properly reciting lines to parrot to him, his worst annoyance. People just memorising things and being so bland and dull. It's why he doesn't send for concubines because it's all they do. For those who say that our Emperor plays favourites, they are correct. Tom has favourites with all of us.
It was dark brown, with stacks of paper towards one end, a lamp was turned off turned at the keyboard. There were a few boxes on either side, I couldn't read them the labels were facing the chair. Talking of the chair, a thick black cloak rest on it, I could hear Lucius gasped quietly upon I assume seeing it; although I don't know why it would have any significance for him.
I, on the other hand, was silent and shook my head as Harry asked me about my life at home before it all fell apart. I wasn't being silent about it because of anything bad, heavens no. Rather that I never liked to share my experiences; even the Emperor didn't know much about my childhood and time at Hogwarts. I had been the first person to deny the Son of Magic knowledge, he took it less badly than my uncle had been expecting and all of us to be exact.  It took about three minutes before Harry stopped asking, realising that I wasn't going to say anything about them. I gave my sister an apology and of course a quick explanation, not unlike the one I just gave. It wasn't that nothing worthy of being mentioned happened, but rather I never spoke about my parents, they were precious to me and how I grew up. Everyone around me grew to learn this, even my uncle didn't know things me, things that I would of course share in due time. Still, I enjoyed the ride and going with Harry was especially lovely, we didn't need to talk, the silence that was the was comfortable and easy.
That I have no answer for, he could be anywhere, and nowhere at the same time. "I do not know, you might want to check his Palace or his office." She nods and walks around the table, kissing my cheek lightly. My arm almost pulls her closer onto my lap but I resist. She is not mine to take.
"What's that?" Jumping out of my skin In turn around to see Draco leaning on a wall, pointing to the box. "And why did Scabior deliver it with the words 'Happy birthday from the Dark Lord'?" I pick the box up and walk back into the living room, unwrapping it.
Walking out he took me downstairs to the small wooden hut, in the back garden, with a swing and some other thing that I couldn't see from where we were. "Ooo Mat has one of these, although his is made of glass!" I said instantly, "Who's Mat?" I was asked by all three, my face red and looked at my plate
Soon it will be too late for me to try to go to sleep, I'll probably be too tired to function properly today. Dear Lord I'm not having a wonderful day. Harry slowly shuffled on my shoulder mumbling slightly, I looked at him smiling slightly; about ten minutes later he properly wakes up smiling at me as he rubes his eyes "Morning Draco." I nod, morning indeed
My eyes well with hot tears, threatening to spill as I silently shake my head "No-I can't think about them-not without being away." A chocked sob wrecks me as a leaned against the wooden tub. I briefly hear my name being called, a lure back to reality, gently a hand on my chest pushes my head down, I remember to hold my breath just in time.
She would show her dammed sister who really had the power and influence. Even if it meant killing her and her half-dead servent.
"He's been, shaking, shivering, almost spasming in his sleep, the bloody healers will do nothing but sprout silly talk about stars and planets. He needs a real doctor." She said in her usual rushed annoyed tone. I understood her perfectly and fully agreed, not understanding why Tom even allowed such useless people to work here.
The ding took me out of my thoughts, I slowly followed Draco into a wide open windowed room, with four desks and doors. A person in white robes with dark hair as talking quietly to a male in light grey robes, he was nodding frantically. Looking around I smiled, holding onto Draco's arm, they didn't seem to notice that we had arrived.
What had happened was that the Aurors had found new evidence in the Slytherin dorms pointing to a group of now adults. Thus they had to have more hearings and trials. Oh and I had to be with Cygnus and Aliette. "Is that why," he sniffled "Your trunk is packed already?" I nodded, I knew that Harry had noticed and I'm a little surprised tha he was asking now about it.
Draco decided to sit with me and my friends, I smiled as he waved to his friends, "Hey, guys do you mind?" I asked motioning to Draco, as he hid behind me, They nodded and we all sat down, I felt a tug at my sleeve, glancing down.
I smiled and Snape came in "I'm glad to see you two are close, I hope it won't change much in the near future. Also, your parents will be coming in five minutes, they will want an explanation for what happened." Before leaving us alone. "Harry, can you let go for a bit?" I nodded and he mover over to a bookshelf and took out a random black book, as soon as he sat down , I saw that it's wasn't a ramdom black book it was 'Fascini scuro e malediziari' or the more adult title (version) (which was what he had) 'Enciolopedia di Tenebrae Magicae (Della ment magicae al peggair sangue magicae)' I gulped softly. That's when his parents come in through the floo "Mother! Father, I missed you!"
I woke to a screaming Harry, distantly yelling my name; my hands tied behind my back and my hair pushed flush on my scalps, I could hear Lucius' faint sobs and tears, his hushed pleading of anything. Slowly Bella's face comes into my view "What do we have here?" She cooed disgustingly, my heart pounds in my chest, I feel like throwing up, everything is swimming and sound is hard to hear. I can't hear what she's saying but her eyes are mad and unstable. I scream as something sharp and thin hits my back and beads of blood run down my pale skin. Lucius rushes towards and in a flash of light everything is gone, he's holding me close to his chest as Tom lazily waves his wand in our general direction, before I know it, sleep and darkness consume m
"I'll turn my self into a boy if that's what it takes for you to love me, Harry!" I said doing an impression of her, causing multiple Slytherin students, about a year below and above us to laugh.
Smiling as he was happily splashing water around, stopping as soon as he he saw me "Sorry." His blush looked adorable on his little cute face. Slipping back into our casual routine of me washing his hair while he asks questions about things.
I sat up, biting my lip I looked down.  "I'm fine Mrs Malfoy, I was just wondering if tomorrow I could go out to buy Christmas presents? I haven't got any yet..." I went silent, I knew at least they called Christmas something else. I felt my chin get lifted up.
"Miss Granger, Mr Weasley could you care to explain your tardiness?" Harry blinked in shock as I contained my laugher along with Pansy and Nott "Ten points each off Gryffindor, both of you will serve detention with me, tonight at eight, for now, go sit down."
" The little black snake slithered towards the vanilla cake and stuck out its tongue. Taking a bite, he made a somewhat happy noise.
"You think I'm done?" She spat at Alice, forcing the girl to the floor, using her magic to chain her blood-soaked arms to the ground. "Oh please, I'm only just beginning."  Alice choked and coughed, her hair was stuck to her face from tears and sweat. She felt her clothes, once white and pristine was now being torn from her body, there was no chance of her ever returning to the Empress without shame.
"Sorry if I seem rude, I'm not used to other children here, my family aren't well liked my many." I looked at him and nodded "I didn't think you were rude at all, anyway." He smiled and got up "You got a few rather big things sent to you, I'll leave so you can get dressed." He said before walking out of the room and standing by the wall as I got into a simple while the top and black skirt with white tights and red shoes.
Chapter eight: October 3rd to 4th > The end of mourning means that Draco and Lucius have to return to the Manor so Draco can get his lordship. Regulus turns up at last with Susan. Draco stops by Tom's palace where he's having a fight with the minister, Draco calms him down from it and they have another talk before Draco leaves after dinner. Late that night Draco, Lucius, Daffodil, Regulus and Susan in separate carriages while going to Wiltshire. The next morning Draco wakes up thanks to Luicus and they all have breakfast and the day goes on.
Our carriages were like small rooms, thick walls that we could lean against and rest upon.  My uncle and I had gotten in ours soon after dinner, our bags were up on the wall. Fourtanlly for our eunuchs these carriages were on wheels and they didn't have to do anything like carry us for several hours. Why do I mention this? We had left the city a few hours ago, the sky was becoming darker and darker by the minute. My uncle was up against the wall, holding me, I was lying down, my head on his lap, almost asleep. I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to be a Lord or even own the Manor. But I had to, my uncle couldn't take it easy, at least he couldn't take the Lordship. I could give the Manor to him, I would rather it be with him than me. But it was coming back the feeling of returning so soon made me feel ill, made my stomach do flips and my lungs twist and flatten. So naturally, I decided that sleeping would be the best way to be rid of those feelings.
I turned around, in my sleep, "Harry, for crying out loud wake up!" I could hardly hear them over the screams in my head,
"I agree, and this behaviour is rather normal for Lucius, he did the same when Abraxas died in his teens. I would recommend going to Tom and asking if Lucius can see his Healer, but is something else wrong?" I asked, since she had been so upright and utterly confusing today. Had something occurred, before Lucius went to sleep? When Draco was kept out of their room?
"It depends on the secret." Draco looked down and sniffed, "Do your parents know, whatever you're going to tell me?" He nodded, I sighed and smiled "Hit me." I said, needless to say, Draco looked utterly mortified "NO!" I blinked and covered a laugh, "Not literally, it's an idiom, it means tell me, I probably should have realised that you wouldn't know what it meant." I said sheepishly. Draco blushed and told me everything, about how he kept going to Dumbledore, how he needed to see multiple healers, how his parents had reacted, how his friends had been dealing with similar problems, just not nearly a much as he had 'Becuase he had purer blood, he was more appealing begin what he was'.
I hadn't seen Harry all day apart from lessons, which didn't count, in my opinion, Pansy and Theo had decided to stay with me, not understanding Harry's strange behaviour. He was asked to make sure I was okay, I'm mean I'm sure he didn't want to but he still said that he would. At the least, he could have some sort of motion of him
It was then the knife was picked up again and sliced. Draco hardly suppressed a whimper, but a single tear did fall. It was only seconds as he felt it again. Lord Voldemort had indeed done as previously promised and stopped the bleeding quickly. "There there, no need to cry." He wasn't crying, he was sniffling.
"Draco...Could I see it?" I asked the first question that was on my mind, it was probably utterly stupid, but I wanted to know. "Okay, sure just don't touch it, please." I nodded as he lifted up his sleeve on his left arm, I blinked and stared, I was pretty sure that by now I had memorised the Dark Mark, I looked back up at him before he realised what I was looking at before he came in, "Harry, I'm assuming you've already worked it out." I nodded and sat closer to him, "They stay with my aunt and uncle while I'm at school, Harry, you can see them if you want, I'm going downstairs anyway." I got up and followed him down to the lobby, where two small children were climbing on teddy bears, massive teddy bears.
I could hear his shallow breathing next to me. I held back tears I couldn't cry now, not when he hadn't slept in weeks, worried about me. I have made the decision myself, not telling him or them. He wasn't angry with me he was just very scared, of the future, for me and him. Tomorrow would be the day that he'd never heard my voice again, after midnight. It had only been ten years, he was only a child, really.
I wrapped my arms around him and ran my hand through his hair trying to calm him down, from crying. It didn't take a genius to figure out what Draco was afraid of, he pushed himself up off my chest and sniffed, I passed him a strawberry scented tissue, he muttered thank you, and laid his head on my shoulder. Softly crying as I continued to run my hand through his hair, "Why aren't you..." I sighed quietly and thought about my answer "I know what being used like a tug of war rope, and generally being abused feels like, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, even someone I hate." Draco looked at me, "Even the Dark Lord?" I nodded after a while. Brushing off the odd detached feeling that came with Lord Voldemort I smiled "That's what you call him?" Draco nodded and fiddled with his hands, "I can stop if you don't like it!" he rushed cutely, I smiled and lifted up his head, slightly "Draco, I honestly don't mind what you call him as long as it doesn't kill you, personally I don't see why people don't just call him Lord Voldemort, I seem to be the only one who does."
"You don't have to, and we'll hardly run into my parents unless it's dinner, lunch, breakfast or you need them at any point or if you give them a reason to, or anyone else does." I breathed slowly I had a feeling it wouldn't be all that peacefull "I just want a friend over for once and I want someone with me this hoilday, I promise I don't have any other reason!" I smiled and lifted up his head "You don't have to justify why you want me to come over, and I wouldn't mind, sure." Drcao had the biggest smile I'd ever seen on his face with that we went to the other sides of the hall again I feel déjá vu to yesterday evening. "Hey Harry, how was sharing with Malfoy?" I rolled my eyes at Ron, after mine and Draco's mature-ish conversations Ron seems like a little kid, though he'd always be my best friend "It was fine Ron, we mostly left each other alone although I poked him this morning, by accident." Hermione sat down and looked at me "How do you poke someone, without meaning to?" plating her food I sighed today is going to be a long day.
"Why in the name of Merlin is Potter, trying to console the mudblood girl and Weasel, they were late of their own accord, it's their fault no point in making them feel better" Although I would never voice my opinions to Harry, directly it felt nice hearing Pansy laugh.
The Emperor made no move to stop them, simply watching over us while we all ate, after all, there was no reason for him to actually talk to us. But surely this amounted to some kind of bullying? Maybe if it continued he would intervene. But his eyes were on Draco and me alone, he flicked between us every of often. It was to creep me out. I glanced at him as he smiled at me, trying to be courageous I shook my head at him and Draco sent me a comforting glance. Emperor Riddle nodded and looked away from me. Whatever happened, I was thankful for, I didn't like him looking at me like that. I could continue breakfast in relative pleasure.
Chapter nine: October 6th > A storm makes them stop by a temple where they stay for the night, Draco has a nightmare and Luicus is there to calm him down, getting Draco to have a bath. When they go back to bed Draco sneaks off to see how close they are to the Manor.
My uncle nods and I let her sit on the bed, almost on my lap. Slowly I run a hand through their hair; Susan's sobs died down and eventually they were calm enough to start talking properly, they explained that they overheard a conversation between the Emperor and The Minister, it seemed to be a heated argument and Tom broke something in his room, an ornament that the Empress had gifted him.
Walking toward the Gryffindor table I passed Ginny the book, she smiled brightly and batted her eyelashes at me "Oh thank you, Harry, ever so much! You have no idea how long I was searching for it this morning." I stepped back before she could run at me, I quickly jogged away from her as Ron spoke to her.
"You will answer any question I ask you, and you will say nothing more." Just because she was so much lower than her dear sister meant nothing. They still had the same parents and they were raised in the same house, they share the same blood. Just because Bells was the Emperor's untouched wife meant nothing to her. She was a Black regardless, this little brat would suffer for her crimes. Even if the Emperor tried to claim that she had been too harsh.
Daffodil was simply reading, sitting her room, she had spent the night with him and walked back to the palace with Draco after breakfast this morning. She hadn't noticed that someone else was in the room with her. If she had, maybe this would have turned out so differently and Alice might not ever see her Mistress again. Daffodil's eunuch was her own cousin, she fought to have him here and to not have him become infertile, there were only two male Blacks left. Besides, she loved Reggie.
I saw Draco wave and smile at me, the evening sun catching his eyes once again, I also just saw Pansy slip into dinner and sit by Draco's side, holding his arm, and he wrapped his arm by her waist, she rested her head on his shoulder, Draco ran a hand through her hair and mouthed something at me, although I don't know what, I simply shrugged my shoulders at him, and got an eye roll in reply. I watch them from the table, not interested in Ron and Hermione at all. They looked close, I Don't know what that feeling that rose within me was, I wanted to be the one to cling to Draco like that, but to be honest, Draco was her friend and he was only doing what good friends should.
Walking into my room, I saw eight dresses laid out on the bed, with a note on top, saying that I could wear the dresses if I wanted, but when I actually start working, I should wear the blue and white maid dress thing or anything similar. Most probably Draco chose the colours, well it makes sense. At that moment I heard a someone tap my bedroom door, I slowly walked up to it and opened it, to see Draco. Speak of the devil and thou shall appear "Yes?" he looked down before asking if he could talk to me, For someone I'm working for, he does seem to be more afraid of me. "Hey, Draco what's wrong? I know somethings up with you." He carefully sat on the bench and looked right at me "Can I trust you, to keep a secret, don't tell you friends, or any other family you might have, don't tell a soul, can I trust you to do that?" I sat in front of him, and held his hand, "Draco, you can trust me with any secret, honestly." He took a deep breath before beginning his explanation.
"I wonder how Sirius is coping without his brother." Lucius glanced at her and shook his head, staring his own opinion which was roughly that Sirius had more than enough people to keep him occupied and stable. Besides that tonight was the full moon, which meant both that he would be bust with Remus all night and that someone would be keeping the Emperor company.
It was that sweet deep sound of his completion, hearing my on name groaned like a curse as he came into his underwear and robes, that sent to me cum down his windpipe. verbally could give no warning but he pushed away to swallow everything I was mercilessly forcing him to swallow. His gagging almost made me hard once again. I certainly wasn't the longest of males, but I knew for a fact that I had the thickest cock out of them if I was included with the Emperor and his Elite.
Then the whole school decides to call Harry as Slytherin's heir because he spoke a snake! Dear Merlin, it wasn't my fault that he spoke to it, he probably didn't even know what he was doing. But our Duel made it very clear that Harry was still very angry with me, I did as we were told, it's what I'm used to doing, yet Harry decides to fire a spell, what else was I to do. I couldn't break in font of everyone, and I certainly don't want to do it in font of Harry, Granger or Weasel. All three of them enjoy doing it again and again just to see it wound me.
Weasel's threats that McGonagall shut down and took off more points, "Do you think that Professor McGonagall will contact Granger's parents?" I whispered to my friends as we were doing practical work.
Of course, Draco and no one else knew about that so today would surprise him, hopefully, he would be happy about it. "Can we watch those movies I said I needed you to see?" He nodded reluctantly but smiled. I clapped joyfully, something about watching movies about us just seemed so exciting! I mean until the last four anyway then it's just sad and upsetting.
Chapter two: June 21st >The point of view changes to Tom's as the possible new Concubines arrive Tom looks over them all, with the help of his advisors Luicus, Severus, Remus and Sirius. Tom only has to choose four, spotting Harry Tom grows curious and with the pleading of Remus and Sirius chooses Harry as one of them, placing him in the 4
Oh, Merlin, it's been 12 chapters, this story is officially one year old! I can' believe I began this on OneNote last year if you have been following this since the start or just binge read it all, thank you. It means so much to see the hit number go up and the kudos as well!
"Hello, my parents want to tell the Daily Prophet about Cygnus and Aliette. To do so they need your consent and they need you to be there, the house arrest doesn't affect this, I also think it might be a good idea, they won't be shamed as bastards, and I doubt we'll let the world pity them." Minutes of went by of simply listing, I was tense talking him without anyone with me was scary, to say the least.
Draco is supposed to be back next month, he hasn't sent anything to me and Lucius says that he had been asked to not mention anything to me. Which I can expect, I'm not direct family to them. Although do wish the best of them, it would be difficult for Draco if they died, I would offer as much support to him and Lucius as possible.
"No, it's not that, not at all, I promise, Ginny, doesn't bother me not yet anyway." I sighed resting my head on his shoulder.
I heard him laugh a bit, he wrapped his arm around mine forcing me to look up at Harry. "Yeah I was, how could you tell?" I paused, before answering, I knew that he had to come here for a reason, small talk was not it. "Your hand's cold, why did you come back?" I asked, looking at him, I gave him every reason to be angry at me. Every reason to ignore me just like he had been doing all day.
Father and mother had been asked to stay at the orphanage along with uncle Severus and Professor Lupin. Meaning that Harry and I had to stay with Neptune, we had a personal driver collect us. I pulled up the barrier between us and the driver.
I stayed with my father for the rest the day, basically following him until class where I tried to sit as close to him or mother as possible. I had muggle lessons throughout the afternoon. English and Mathematics, I found that I was profoundly brilliant at English the teacher had asked whether I read a lot of books, I did, old family dairies they were honestly more interesting than most thriller books I have seen available.
Waiting patiently because I was a nice person, and I knew how long Draco would take, I picked up a book I saw lying around and opened the cover. There was nothing on the pages, for a black leather book, I thought it's interesting, at the least a sketchbook. "Where did you find that?" I looked up, he didn't sound angry, but he didn't sound pleased either. I opened my mouth and looked down, Draco sat beside me and lifted up my chin "Harry, please?" I swallowed.
Mathematics was a vastly different scenario, I could do it I could, I can understand it but I was slow at it when most would be finished in seconds I'd be finished in minutes. I hated it even more since the teacher had said that Neptune had excelled in this and he couldn't understand why I didn't. Overall the class made me feel weak, stupid and inadequate. My parents had to console me for the entire trip back down to normal ground.
My eyes finally opened as he released me with a pop his silver, lust-filled eyes looking into mine as I pulled him up to kiss him before he even thought about licking anything away from his lips. Lucius easily pinned me down under him as we kissed and he reached to test if his thumb would slip into me with ease. I felt his smirk against my lips "One day." Lucius whispered. I could do nothing but nod, yes one day I will let him push more than just his thumb into my tight, virgin arse.
"What's wrong with him? Other than the obvious of course." Lucius had lost his elder brother, a role model, the only person who was there for him when their father died of dragon pox. Of course, he was going to be upset and shaken. She lifted up her head and licked her small, plump lips.
I nodded and smiled, Ron answering before I could open my mouth. "Hermione, Draco, wasn't the one to get hurt, it was his friend Blaise, Hogwarts might face a shut down if one more pureblood gets assaulted, we'd all get moved to Ilvermorny, we can't just brush it off." Hermione looked surprised and slightly offended more at Ron.
"Have either of you decided who will go where? As I have a few ideas, and if you can't decide I will choose who." They shook their heads, I sighed, I loved my job and who I worked with, they were nice and we had fun, even if I was only here for a few years, going into my second.
The Dark Lord smilied, the sight made Draco cringe, "You've already told your final words to your parents, what more do you require?" His fingers brushed against Draco's wrist, placing the knife on his chest.
In the next hour, I had regained myself to following Draco, he didn't seem to mind, so I clutched his sleeve as we walked back to his room and I assume he meant to place them in their cot, but he stayed holding them, while they slept, "You know, what are their names?" I whispered, careful to wake the two sleeping children they held each other tightly. Draco looked up and smiled.
Picking up the book he shuffled around until his head was in the crook of my neck and his parents looked fondly at us. "Harry, has Draco asked you about staying with us for the holidays?" His parents asked at the same time, I smiled tightly and nodded "Yes he has, I said that I wouldn't mind going."
"They're so live and humourous" Harry's voice continues of several minutes "Remus has such dark humour, I think you two would get along, and Siri is really funny in general, he's always telling me about his time at Hogwarts with my parents and Remus." I had defiantly heard about that they had gotten up to; second hand from my uncle who went to school with them and Severus for a year before he graduated. "They take me to get ice-cream and we go to museums and they take me to watch films. I love them." Of course, Harry does, but to what extent?
"Yes, I was wondering if you could explain why I found him in the common room late last night asleep on a chair; not the most comfortable place for a child don't you think?" I blinked, I hadn't known that Draco had left our dorm. Although I did wake up multiple times so maybe I just didn't realise.
"It was on the desk, I got curious." He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my cheek. "It belongs to Ginny, so maybe give it back to her, when you can." I nodded and smiled.
Imperial life here is full of betrayal and power. I am weary of even my closest friends; for they could turn their backs on me just as quickly as I could to them. It's worse the higher you are, I see fights of the tongue play out over meals and times between the Emperor and his Kings, I am the only one unscathed. But daily my food and drink are tested, I go out with guards. Anyone below me could be a threat.
I would say sorry for what I said, after I had been made sure that what Theo said was wrong. "Do you care? About me? Please tell me truth!" I blurted out, desperate. Harry looked surprised and shocked, he reached out to hold my hand, his bright green eyes shining with an emotion I can't comprehend. Gently tugging at my hand he pulled me closer.
Our breakfast was severed warm and with great penance. We were given tea with biscuits as well as a wonderful nutritious elven soup. It was rather bland in favour but it was stable enough with aromas and feelings that it filled us up. The tea itself was lemon with a hint of ginger. Prayers were done in silence and were completed in short of twenty minutes, after thanking the temple workers and keepers for allowing our stay and for feeding us, we're back in our carriages to continue on our journey, this time Daffodil did join us and sat next to me. Now is the time to point out that I am either in the middle, on one of their laps or simply observing them. We are never too far away from each other.
"With your sister, Dragon." Right, I didn't know who that was, Draco was holding my hand, tightly. Because of me, Draco and his family were forced to take muggle transport. "Don't worry, Dragon all of our important things will be with us. You will be fine." we had gotten through security easily. No doubt magic was involved.
"He's one of the friends, along with Nathan, Jason, Chris..."I faded out at the looks I was getting, especially from the woman, who I'd ducted was Draco mother and therefore Lucius wife "You don't have any friends that are girls?" She asked as if every girl was meant to have female friends "No, I don't see why I should, I find the girls in my class highly annoying and insensitive as well as rude and ignorant." She looked taken back but at least I didn't get questioned on my friends anymore
"Hermione if anyone gets hurt, no matter what year, blood status or house, Hogwarts won't be a school it'll just a castle with no standing to its name..." Ron held his head in his hands "You know, we need the founders they'd save Hogwarts, they'd know what to do."
Apparently, we were here to learn about America's Magical Law system, starting right at the top, and working our way down. Our first stop was the MACUSA Wizengamot, a large dome with seats climbing up along the walls. I felt Draco grab my hand, gently I held it smiling up at him.
I looked at Draco's pure white face from Gryffindor table, on the other side of the hall, sighing I held my head up with my fist "Why and how would anyone hurt him?" I muttered under my breath, getting a few odd looks from my friends. I continued to (hopefully) subtly look at Draco, He looked up, his glazed light sapphire wide eyes, and blinked at me I smiled and waved at him, he blinked again waited and smiled. The sun catching his porcelain skin and eyes
"Harry, I'm okay as I could be, Draco I don't know about." I nodded and sat down on a small sofa, by Draco's hand he laughed and patted my head, I nuzzled his hand and gently bit his finger.
I ended up sitting in Draco's lap, too afraid to actually sit down, as we took the long drive to London, we were about halfway there when something buzzed and made a weird soft noise I looked at Draco as he pulled out a phone, better than Dudley or even Vernon phone, one I knew they'd dream to have. "Just a friend wanting to know something, nothing important," Draco explained before they both noticed my face.
Alice was made to look like a slut and whore, chained to the floor, legs folded and spread out. After reach answer that displeased Daffodil the whip of twigs beat her thighs and legs, inching close to her inactive reproductive organ, regardless it would be nice to beat. This continued until she admitted to being ordered to snoop around by Bellatrix.
Once Harry prorests at the cup I move it. Immediately the smaller teen nuzzles against me, holding onto me tightly and safely. I allow him and rub his back. Our thin white night shirts leave no protection aganist the harsh cold, hence why most of us sleep next to someone else if we can. They also provide no shelter from other's stares. Which truefully, no one really has to deal with. Unless one is sleeping with the Emperor or any of his Eilte, although they would have to find you interesting enough. "Thank you." I nod but wave my hand, he doesn't need to thank me. I feel cold so pull the duvet to cover both of us now that we're no longer lying down on Harry's soft, heavenly mattresses. It takes a while but I realise that Harry's Palace is next to Remus', realistically I should have guessed. They are very close.
I turned around and saw a blur of light blue and white "What is the time?" I asked my tone sounding like I'd rather be asleep "4:52 am" he said before placing something down on the table and curling up beside me "Harry, go back to sleep I'll wake you up in time for breakfast, although your dinner is still here, under a warming charm." I brushed off his last comment and shuffled towards him, before falling asleep.
Another round of nods, I felt Draco pull me closer, his parents wrapping their arms around us I had no idea why but didn't question it. Draco brushed down my hair rhythmically, I don't know who he was trying to calm down, but it was helping me relax. I looked at the desk closest to me.
A few minutes later the large double door opened Neptune came in. She was currently ignoring anyone she could, going directly for the little drink table "Good morning-." The male person in the same uniform as the two Aurors we just met look like he had been paralysed
"It means dirty blood, it's a slur that purist witches and wizards call muggle-borns by. Lucius, his mother and I have tried to get the word out of Draco's vocabulary to no avail; I'm by no means excusing him but you ought to listen to him, knowing him he's probably thinking the worst." I nodded and laced my hands together.
How do you force a wizard or witch to learn non verbal and wandless Magic? You take away their hands and tongue.
"You must be Draco, no one else can look so much like Citrus." I nodded warely any time someone mentioned my appearance it never ended well, magic can be so invasive you don't even have to be alive to harm someone. She looked softly at me, I clutched my father's robe. "I can assure you no one, witch wizard muggle or otherwise can hurt you, the very walls stop such disgraceful behaviour." I blinked, straightening my legs before curling them again. "This castle was once home to family, every essence of a magical home is to protect anyone inside of it, the caste still is home, to my grandnephew and your half-uncle."
"Harry, is something wrong?" I shook my head and sat down on the bed. Still holding the book I waited. I would be lying if I said that I didn't know what to do around Draco, he was the same person, but he wasn't at the same time.
After Harry and I had spent a bit of time outside we returned to his palace and room, by Harry's request. We ended up falling asleep, although I woke up to the sound of coughing, and a body shaking aganist my own. I summon a glass of water, sitting Harry up, letting him rest against my chest for a short while before I press the cool glass to his lips. They're small, much like own, but lighter in shade. The time is a mystery to me but it can't be very early, I don't care though, my only concern is Harry. His eunuch runs in a few seconds later, only to sigh relieved at the sight of Harry drinking some water. She returns to her room soon enough, able to make us tea and heat up some noddle soup before doing so.
A hand brushed my own and I almost yelped, only to snap my head and see Regulus' eyes meet my own "You look like you're thinking, are you okay?" Thinking? Yes thinking, normally I would be expected to do a lot of thinking about a lot of things however as a member of the Imperial Family, and a wife, thinking should be the last thing I do. I nod and look at him, turning my body to face his. Regulus' smiles, his eyes shining under the moonlight "Everything is going to be fine. You'll be able to tell, magic will make it so."
"You don't have to get us gifts, Harry, you know that right?" I nodded and held his hand. "I know, but I want to."
"Did I miss anything?" I nodded and went to explain that he'd missed some sort of Yule celebration, he sighed and pulled away at the duvet, until he'd set it under him. I slowly laid my head on his lap, hearing a small chuckle from above me.
He won't want to talk to me after what I said, I should have realised that Harry wouldn't be happy with me. I was expecting him to yell and scream, not to ignore me and push me away when I tired to at least say sorry, even if it was pointless. He wasn't who he wanted to apologise to. Which was why I was currently sitting in the common room by the fire, I knew it wasn't safe. But I couldn't sleep in the second bed in our dormitory. Curled in a tight ball against the back of the chair, I looked and felt pathetic, any other person would be able to sleep in a second bed, a mear meter and a half away from another person, anyone but me. I could practically hear my grandfather's snarl in my ear. Telling me how useless, pathetic, and weak I was being. Before I knew I was shut away in a cold dark room, as he walked away. I hadn't realised that I had fallen asleep until I felt someone shake me. Snapping my eyes open I saw Snape looming above me. Carefully and slowly I uncurled myself and stood up.
I stood with Pansy and Theo watching her run off towards her own common room, before walking to Potions as I felt a sharp tug at my robe.
"Can you show us, Grandfather, please?" another female voice asked, the curtains were pulled back, gearing light poured into my container. Although it wasn't me, it was a shell of me. I was really buried with my parents, I demanded it.
But that didn't change the fact that there were eight people on stage after the Head Boy and Head girl had finished their speeches to the school. No one seemed baffled so I can assume that it was normal. Some of them looked way too old to be in school, although it did offer two extra years and masters in many possible subjects after those years.
Chapter one: June 19th - 20th > Draco muses about his normal day in the Forbidden City as a concubine to Emperor Tom Riddle, mentioning that Draco's is something like his favouture and gets to do things that others don't. Draco briefly mentions his uncle Luicus, the fact that he's older than sixteen and that new concubines are arriving soon.  Draco leaves to go home before his parents die to try and see them one last time, and while he’s travelling outside in a carriage he notices that the people he can see outside are so much poorer than he thought. Although he questions it a lot while going towards his family home it never impacts him as he immediately starts talking about nature and getting there.
"Hey, Draco, do you know how your uncle feels about me?" I asked, Draco smiled and sat up, cupping my cheek.
"Either way, Jack I want you inside, my father might not like you, but you don't have to make yourself known. Allison, you can decide where you'll stay here or stay within the wards. I'll be at Ilvernmory following their tails." It seemed we were at an agreement. With that at least.
You would never assume anything bad happened to Draco. But if you look closer. His hands are skeletal, ivory in colour. A gift the Dark Lord had awarded him, that's what his mother always said.
Draco ended up choosing McDondals after he realised that I had never been at least that's what he told his father. He seemed to believe the lie, but sat down reluctantly anyway, although when Draco got the food, Lucius relaxed after seeing my joyful face. It took a while for all of us to leave, mainly because I was eating so slowly but we did eventually get back in the car, I sat one Draco's lap again as he leaned his head on the window, for some reason he was nervous, about something, I fell asleep before I could find out why "Draco, it's normal to be nervous, or even afraid, but I, your mother, Bella and Severus will be there, you're not going to alone, I know you trust him, try to see Marvolo as the uncle you know him as, you should be fine." Draco smiled and thanked his father.
I remember my night with him: easy, soft and calm. It was a genuine offer, simply letting me have somewhere warm and peaceful to sleep. Nothing of course happened, we slept and woke up as if it had been normal for us, when it wasn't, not at all. I found myself longing to be with him again, just for a night. But that would lead to another night, and another; then before I know it I have a wand at my neck for treason by the Emperess.
"Draco?" His voice was sleepy and slow, it made me smile and press a kiss to his forehead "What were you doing?" I shake my head as he opens his eyes and rubs at them, sitting up in bed, looking at me. I leaned against him with a small smile. Telling him that it was nothing to concern himself with and that everything was okay. He doesn't seem to believe me but holds me close anyway as if I'm seconds away from crying again.  Which to clear the record I am not.
"He was calming me down, nothing else," I explained for Regulus, who had just ended up with his head on the floor, not wanting to meet my uncle's eyes. I saw my uncle nod and go back to his work, gently I lifted Regulus' head only for him to scramble out and go back into Daffodil's carriage, I felt my heart sink watching him run towards his cousin, no doubt in a horrible mood now. My uncle looks up at my glare, "You don't have to sound like you're going to kill him." I don't give my poor uncle a chance to talk over me. He sighs and beckons me towards him putting his book down on the 'floor'.My rant and yelling continue for quite some time, a few hours. Yet he does absolutely nothing, he doesn't yell back or look away, he's watching me the entire time. Until I run out of breath, fall to my knees and collapse.
"I guess I forgot to tell you, the girl is called Aliette Malfoy-Slytherin, and her brother is called Cygnus Malfoy-Slytherin with a few middles names added, Tom didn't actually do anything to me." I nodded and laid my head on a pillow.
I'm not traveling far, our home was always close to the City. But I can't get what I saw out of my head, it's going to plague me. I don't think I'll be able to step into The Hall of Everlasting Happiness for a while. Is this why we don't leave often? So we forget the hardships of common life. I don't know how to feel about that, I trust the Emperor with my life. I had heard of poverty and inequality, it took up a whole year of my later education. But that's normal isn't it, there is always going to be the rich and the poor, but it's a basic right to have a home, to have happiness, that shouldn't be taken away from people.
Every morning I get woken, not by eunuchs but by my uncle's bath being run. I get lime tea to drink before my day officially starts. There have been times where I have been late to breakfast; such an offense would call for my disgrace but the Emperor always lets it slide, simply asking it not to happen often. I sit next to my uncle and his friend, I had never met him before coming here. At first, he scared me; he still does. I kindly begged that he be kept away from me. Everything about him makes my skin cold.
Now days later, we're a still unsure what I came down with, but the healers placed it down to something recurring from childhood. This meant little to nothing for Remus and Sirius who kept me with them until the week's end. Hermione was questioned and when I next saw her, her hair was cut and her hands bandaged. I was assured that whatever happened was light. I didn't dare press further.
We left soon after and went to dinner, in which I ended up almost watching a Yule celebration, they offered to let me join in but I politely declined. Internally I was panicking about how I never bought them anything for Christmas, I didn't want to get anything tacky or anything that shows I tried too hard. I got out my Argos catalogue and a pack of post-it notes, I flicked through the jewellery and other things. I ran a hand through my hair and sighed. Noticing a cotton candy machine I smiled, remembering that Draco said that he loved cotton candy and that his father would too. But I wasn't going to just get them a sweet machine, I'm not that bad. I racked my brain for anything I could think of for ideas. I flicked past Pandora.  I heard them come out and quickly hid the book, taking note of the price before Draco's parents came out of the room.
Neptune, is at work. So that's why I'm not actually going to see her, because I'm not walking into he office just to say I can't sleep; although that would be some kind of dedication. My parents are sleeping, but given that I'm eighteen; I can't go into their room because I can't sleep. I'm an adult!
The Order, however, despite knowing that Iive with Draco nor once raised an eyebrow. I did get a semi welcoming, semi threating message from Remus though, so there's that and I don't send them stuff as often.
Harry leaned over to dip his hand in the water, giggling childishly over the ripples he made. His laugh, much like talking about his cares made him sound free and healthy. "Draco! Draco look!" I turned my head at his hushed whisper to see a fish bobble up to surface and swim near us for a few meters "I love fish, they're so calm and pretty." I didn't have the heart to tell Harry that he was eating fish or breakfast almost every day or that his soup broth was made from fish bones, I would do anything to keep that smile and giggle on his face an alive.
The walls that surround this city are tall and thick, made of stone; they trap us in our palaces and paradise of Imperial Luxury and Wealth. My knowledge of the outside world is based on my enriched and vigorant education in History, Politics, and Languages. I know every aspect of our history; the failures, the victories, names, dates, books, I know 7 languages that could be of verbal use, the others are only found in books in the Emperor's library.
Walking out of the common room with interresting to say the least , the person (or people) who attkacked Draco high-fived each other and their friends while making rather loud dirty comments about Draco, I tried not to increse my grip on him "Oh they think their untouchable, I'll show them, watch them burn." Draco muttered darkly, I looked at him and smiled "Oh, Draco, can I say one thing?" He nodded looking at me, "I'll be fine with you begin a Death Eater if you don't tell me too much detail , okay?" He noded, smiling we made it to the train easily from then on.
Daffodil goes to Severus to help Lucius with his sleep movements and he gets more than he wanted in terms of seeing her for what she was. In a different part of the City Draco and Harry wake up after a nap and Draco gets Harry to drink water.
The rest of meal went on as normal, with Bella watching us all as we ate and She simply sipped her tea while Tom ignored her and glanced at Harry worryingly noticing how he was having to lean against Remus and Sirius, he caught me looking at him and offered a small smirk, I shook my head and kept eating, leaning back when I was done.
There were only two people that I recognised, my own twin sister Citrus and my cousin Leviathan. The rest I have no idea, I might have heard of them but that's a low chance. I had planned to pay attention instead of just pay attention to them, the way they looked and dress. I could tell who their parents were by looking at them. Of course, I already knew Leviathan, he wasn't Andromeda's son, father had also spoken about him a few times.
"Harry I care a lot about you, and I never want to see you hurt, terrified, or anything else like it, I want to be the person you go to when you feel like that, I want to be the one you care about in the same way. I want to be the person you can always come to for help, and eventually, I want to be the person you trust, with everything and the person you spend the rest of your life with."
"Draco, what's wrong?" I caught his shoulder as he went into the bathroom, He turns his head, tears falling from his face like a waterfall, I kneeled down and wiped his cascading tears as he sobbed and sobbed into my shoulder "It hurts so much, I can't take it anymore." I rocked him back and forth as I saw a perfect crack in the side of his face, I ran my finger down it, as Draco shut his eyes and bit down into my robe "Does everything about you have to be perfect?" I asked myself, but he heard me anyway "Y-you think I'm perfect?" He sobbbed, frightned,"Draco, to me you'll always be perfect, there's nothing you could ever do that would upset me, to the point of me leaving you, there s nothing you could do that will do that." I told him and kissed his forehead "Harry, you don't know the weight of your words." He warned, still crying, I cupped his cheek "Yes I do, Draco I mean them, I promise you I do." I wiped away his tears as we just stayed there, holding each other We lost track of time when Snape came in, to find us "Come with me the both of you, there won't be any point in either of you going to class." We Looked at each other and followed him.
! Making them glitter in the light, he pouted and pulled out a white fan to block the sun's rays. I couldn't keep the smile off my face, or my displeasure at diner begin over.
"What will you do with my wand? And will it be quick?" Draco asked, he wasn't scared, no now it was too late to be scared. He wasn't getting off the table untill his hands had been butched from his arms, and his tongue cut. "What about my ring?"
greeting "Happy birthday, from The Dark Lord." I smile and wave him off as he apparates and I shut the door.
Theo had claimed the might not care at all, considering that I had put myself in danger, without so much as a question as to if I was okay or not, anyone can here dormitory door open and close at night, he should have. Theo had thought that I wasn't listening, but I know that my friends care enough about me.
"Good morning Harry." I mumble playing with his hair, we had a busy day that's all I could think of. "My sister is still at work, my parents will be up soon." I wanted to wish that everything could be resolved, we could all go back home, nothing could go wrong everything would be okay. That's not possible, day after day, night after night; trials and hearings are taking over Magical England trying to find everyone responsible for every single case of assault at Hogwarts. I'm lucky we got to leave.
Chapter four: August 8th > Keeping with Harry's pov he and Draco share a look at breakfast while Tom looks between the two of them; Harry gets him to stop and coops up in his room for most of the day trying to read. In the evening Draco comes over and he and Harry have dinner together. Harry has thought about his place here and Sirius. Draco and Harry fall asleep together.
…I blinked gently as he darted my eyes up at me swiftly, before burying his head once more into my shoulder. With a lift of his chin, he opened his eyes to meet mine. My mind was clouded with dangerous thoughts, within seconds he was pinned under me, my tongue slipping through his parted lips, My hands making quick work of undoing the buttons on his shirt that he was wearing. He gasped for air as I caught his bottom lip in my teeth, slowly pulling the soft material from his shoulders, I licked at his earlobe and whispered in his hair. He squirmed under me and got a small chuckle in reply.
Sighing and wishing away all thoughts of him I turn back to my book. I had made the mistake of assuming that as such I would be forgotten about. Simply being sick doesn't make me invisible, but rather the complete opposite, everyone was looking at me, whispering or muttering. I hate it, it seemed the only people who spare me such a fate are the Elite and of course Draco.  It wasn't that I wasn't grateful for Draco's help and care but rather the act of it surprised me. Even more, was who gave Draco the green light. I didn't want to think that someone had told Draco to take care of me, that he didn't want to, that would be awful and I would try to get as far away from anyone as possible. But would Draco help me, when he has other problems to deal with? I mean, he's in the second rank, and Imperial, even our Empress isn't that high up, and she's our Empress. Then possibly maybe Draco feels entitled, she can't hurt him, lest she is faced with death. So it's clear that she may even feel threatened by Draco, who is much younger. But then Sirius is the Empress's cousin, so where does he fit into all this? And he's my godfather, but Draco and I share the Imperial title onto our titles, he's Imperial Heir Malfoy, soon to be Lord if everything goes his way. I've always been Heir, I've always been so unsure with taking the Lordship, I'll have to talk to Siri or Remi about it soon.
I am cruel. I am rude. I am broken. I am unsatisfactory. I am meek. I am submissive. I am docile. Shaking off the string of adjectives I could use describe me, I wound my way through the castle walls trying to find Harry before class starts, not that Transfiguration would be that difficult to get to on my own, I'd just rather not go alone. Bad things happen when I'm alone.
"Blaise are you okay?" Draco said running toward his friend and sat on his bed, and probably did the first thing that came to his head, as he rested his hand on his forehead. He stayed in that position for a few hours, but I didn't think he actually knew what he was doing, or neither did he. Draco leant in and gently pressed his lips to Blaise's forehead before he jumped back in shock as he hid his face with his robe "Blaise, I didn't mean to do that! I swear!" Said boy smiled and laughed, hitting Draco lightly with a pillow.
"It was life or death, even you can't deny that." I nodded sadly, I knew it was true, didn't mean I liked it.
Alice had already had her reproductive organs removed once she arrived at the city at least thirteen years ago, as was the custom for female, although this was done harshly depending on the status of the girl in question. Alice had assumed that it would be her biggest shameful moment, apparently, she had underestimated the torture that Daffodil was capable of. She felt hurt, damaged ridiculed and shamed. Yet when she looked up at Daffodil, she looked down disgustfully at her, in a small pool of blood, sweat and tears
Chapter seven: August 10th> The point of view shifts to Severus as Narcissa sees him and asks some questions about Lucius, he asks about the necklace she's wearing. After that interaction Draco wakes up from a nap with Harry coughing, giving him some water. Harry asks if Draco and Lucius sleep together a lot, Draco eventually answers yes.
"My dear darling nephew, they are watching, and they are proud of you. You have nothing to fear." I leaned into her words and took a breath. "You will be safe." I nod feeling more assured now than I was a few minutes ago.
The room was dark and cold, the air tasted damp and old, the furniture was rusty and braking. I was curled into an old mattress with tears and rips, the sharply jagged metal coils poking out. I tried not to cry, I had heard stories from the other children that someone had died in this room, they don't who but it's why they stay away from the Hall. But I know that ghosts are real, the manor is filled with them, that doesn't fill me with comfort though. I, however, have no choice it's where my mother grew up if I want to know my grandparents (which I don't) I have to stay with them.
"You said that I could lead a sector of the Court, didn't you? Let me do that, I can implement Court members who are trusted and loyal into the Ministry as his advisors, Fudge is weak and stupid he will listen to anyone with money and the correct surname." I explain in the best way I can, going further into who and where and why. As I spoke, Tom listened, not once butting in to criticise me. At last, I finished, my breath lost and my mind at ease, a smile danced upon his lips.
"I'm going to have to return to England for a bit." I declared, interputing him mid sentence "For several reasons but I don't want you staying coming with me." Harry turned around and the pout of his face signalled that he was about to cry. "I don't want to drag you into the mess that you don't need to be a part of." His cheek felt wet against my hand, and it's definitely not from the water in the tub. I summoned a towel to wrap him in and held Harry close, I didn't want to make him cry.
"Just a pureblood? What about anyone else? Or the fact that it's just Slytherins?" I bit into my lunch and sighed, letting Ron do the talking,
"So basically I gave the Dark Lord a gift for his birthday last year and he said to expect the same thing," I explain shrugging my shoulders as I notice a bunch of wood, glue, nails and a hammer, along with the same type of chocolate as I sent him.
Opening the door I smiled at the unchanged furniture. My first place that most definitely didn't run through; my parents' bedroom, they looked so ill it made me cry as I sat beside their bed watching them slowly wake and breath. My mother, who wasn't as ill held my hand, calling me sweet and Prince, trying to stop my tears.
The Empress feels threatened and embarrassed in her bath and goes straight to death and toture for revenge.
Th last words he would ever say would be 'What about my ring?'. It made him internally huff, he would never get to tell Harry how much he actually cared. How much he loved Harry. When thought about, his family meant a little more; that ring and eventually the Lordship ring, would protect him.
I smile and nodded "The best wake up call I have ever received uncle, thank you." My smile projected innocence, a childish disposition. But I wasn't lying, it was the best I had been given, the call of the peacocks was nothing like what my uncle's mouth
"And your aunt and uncle don't like the fact that you don't like girls? Harry if it makes you feel any better, even a small bit, my parents weren't the happiest people when I told them I mostly preferred boys they thought it was because of things that had happened at school." I giggled and smiled at the thought.
Grasping the handle to his office, I gut the door open "This childish bicker ends now!" My voice echos and bomms over theirs, as they both turn to look at me "You," I round myself towards the Minister "are nothing more than a coward who bends to the will of people! You are nothing more than a stupid figurehead!" My rage continues as Tom lets me insult and berate the Minister where he stands. After my breath has worn and his dignity crushed he leaves with a red-faced scowl.
"Her name's Stephaine Cordato, she's the same age as Draco, I'll explain the rest later." He said placing me down on the sofa, I wasn't by any means small for my age, but just very ill. He soon returned to take me to my room, I told him I felt fine to walk, surprisingly I manged to walk up to the third floor. I remember begin told to sleep and that I could have something to eat once I woke up before I fell into a subconscious state of sleep.
Our teacher was pushed into the wall, spluttering helplessly, I've seen people act better when under Crucio. He smiled and brushed a lock of curled hair away from his left eye, the potions teacher gasped and his eyes widened in fear or shock.
Harry Potter, finally arrives at the Forbidden City, however he is ill with something and Draco is still at home.
"All I know, before you ask, is to expect a parcel." I nod confused but take the cake as breakfast. "Someone has a present for you, as a thank you." I nod again, smirking to myself.
Keeping his eyes open he watched as Lord Voldemort pressed the clean knife to where his tongue met his jaw. He felt his heat beat pick up, it was no longer steady, rapid and efficient. His core had tied itself into a knot at his center. Oh Lords no! He saw Lord Voldemort smirk growing. This wasn't what he would imagine this planning out.
Harry's smile faulted as I asked, "Snape wanted to ask me if I knew anything about why you were in the common room at night, I decided that I should talk to you." Harry paused, his words sound sincere, I knew he was, Severus had told me that he'd ask Harry about his possible involvement in my 'stunt' as he called it. "I will admit that I didn't know you had left, in retrospect I should have done. I promised to take care of you, I should have realised that you had left."
I shrugged a little "I'm not the best, to be honest." I didn't say much else on it but did take my cup of tea, offering Hermione a thankful smile, Draco did the same when he was offered some. I sat quietly and sipped at my drink "I just feel sleepy." He smiled and took a sip of his tea, I think peppermint, from the colour and the smell.
"Nothing much, honestly I mean I'd rather you hadn't left." She pulled him closer and patted his head. "I told you pretty much everything in my last letter." Neptune smiled genuinely and ran a finger down Draco's face, tapping his cheek lightly with her nail. "Yeah, don't ask."He said sheepishly.
With regards to Lucius; he knew what Draco wanted more than paternal recognition, Draco wanted to out do his father, out rank him. Draco wanted it because he knew it would make his father more proud.
I can't remember what I did to be placed in the attic, but I know that it'll be last time I'm left with my grandparents alone again, father and mother will make sure of it, that I know. Other than that all I know is that I have somehow 'disdained my family house' through a bout of accidental magic, not that I knew what I was doing. Mother and father never punish me for anything I do with magic, except when I harshly shoved my father away from me a few weeks ago on my fourth birthday.
I put the phone back on Professor Snape's desk and walk away, I never wanted to make that phone call, I almost never told Harry how I felt. No one else needs to know about anything I've been through and done, just Harry no one else, no other person, no other outsider. They won't understand, they never will. I need to stop acting, I'm not the person I'm being. I'm not nice. I'm not kind. I'm not fixed. I'm not okay. I'm not brash. I'm not dominant.
to August 8th > Draco meets Harry properly as they find each other in the Hall of Preserving Harmony, they go on a walk while talking. Severus turns up and Draco admits he makes him uncomfortable while Harry is awkwardly sat down. By August 7th Draco’s relationship with Tom is established as being odd and special, Tom invites Draco over for tea and they have a heartfelt discussion, Harry comes up at some point in it, Tom gives Draco an important position. Late into the same night Draco wakes up in Tom's bed but falls asleep again after they have a small talk. In the morning (August 8th) Tom pleads with Draco to stay while sounding scared and they have tea together. The POV changes to Harry's as his concubine Hermione wakes him up, he has some worries about how people view him.
Draco's phone buzzed and he quickly picked it up, and all colour drained from his already pale face. He said bye and hung up "It's Yule in three days," I blinked.
I shook my head, assuring him that I was fine "I figured that much, you did mumble in your sleep though." I sat up and almost ran after him. He laughed and kissed my forehead "Relax it's impossible to hear anything you say, unless you talk, or scream which you did neither of." I sighed and got dressed as Draco went into the bathroom to brush his hair.
His voice snaps me from my thoughts "Yes, I do, almost every night, expect when he has Daffodil around." Harry would obviously mean sleep as in lying together, curling up, sleeping. Wouldn't he? I was vague in my answer just in case he did.
I looked up, Draco was blinking. He has zoned out resting on his father's shoulder. I continued to hold his hand, as we were being fed information.
"Tom will be angered Draco, you know that." I had not the need to turn around and see my uncle's face. I already knew his sour expression off by heart. But I am no girl. He doesn't dictate my decisions, Lucius never has. Neither does my husband, and I damm well wouldn't let him
I was greeted with a medium-sized wrapped box with a red bow, "Potter." I look up at the person and smile politely I take the box from him as he nods
"Nothing sweetheart, I'm just proud of you." I cock my head to the side in confusion, why would she be proud of me? I haven't done anything too grand or good. Glancing down I didn't notice that she had moved until she wrapped an arm around me "You've been so resilient over the past few months Draco, and you've always kept a part of yourself, not many people would or have done that when in your position." I looked up at her gradually as she spoke, leaning into her hand as it braided my hair and smiled "How about we give this a cut hmm? You've wanted that for a while."  I nod happily and smile widely for the first time today.
If your following along with this story, in which case thank you it means a lot, I've changed Nathan and Nathalie names to Cygnus and Aliette; I realised that the names sounded too muggle for Draco so changed them.
he ran a hand through my hair and smiled. We both sat in the car and got an approving smile from his father.
I didn't have to think, "393." she smiled and actually wrote it down a piece of paper! "What’s the most immature thing that you do?" I though for awhile "I still have a money box." she took a deep breath and asked me, something I'd never thought I'd get asked, "What keeps you up at night?" I paused and looked down, before answering the question "Memories." By that point, it was lunch time, so we both stayed sitting down, as that thing came back, I jumped and hid behind her "They scare me." I said trying to get as far away from them as possible.
"Will your uncle like it? Or agree with it?" Harry asked, leaning against me even more, cuddling into me when I wrapped an arm around him. If I was being honest I didn't know, he didn't seem very pleased at lunch, but lunch wasn't normal today, not with Bella around on show. "Can he even tell you what to do?" Harry asked curiously; it appears I may have awakened the childlike tendency to continue asking questions no matter what which wasn't on bad on paper.
I waited for Draco to come back from wherever he was in this manner, I didn't have to wait very long, as he came in mumbling about his arm begin in pain "Draco, are you alright?" I asked as he sat on the sofa and held his arm, he looked at me and with a laugh.
I knew that Daffodil was with us, although she was in the carriage behind us. They would like to believe that it's because she didn't want to impose on us; however, I know that it's Lucius made her stay in her carriage, ordered her to. Just the way she likes. I had known since meeting Daffodil that she liked being told what to do and she liked making people happy, this, of course, had its boundaries. But mainly she liked being told what and how to do things. If it wasn't obvious enough in public it was made more obvious, and probably harsher when the moon rose above our palace. I had a second bedroom of course, but rather I was mere, separated from the two if the need arisen, which meant that no matter what silence charms they placed, I could still see them. See how her body arched into his with breathless moans and pleads, how her nails dug into his back or silken ropes. How with one whispered command she'd bend and go limp. I had also learned that she did indeed look pulchritudinous being taken from behind in her sleep, she certainly enjoyed having Lucius' cock slip in and out of her as she slept bringing her to quiet orgasm. Everything about her seemed to become younger when she slept. Why they would bother keeping that from me was a complete mystery, one that I fully intended to learn about by the end of this year. Which was fast approaching as we had passed Harry's birthday a few weeks ago? I fact I learned from seeing Remus handle a plant so lovingly by the Hall of Complete Harmony.
He dismissed me and I walked back to the tower in relative peace. I had decided that I would spend today with Ron and Hermione, then talk to Draco tonight.
Just minutes later I was sat in the bathroom with her, my uncle having to go do something for Tom, which gave us the perfect chance to surprise him. Daffodil smiled as she explained what she would do once I told her I just wanted my hair short, slightly to the side and with a little bit of a curl. Although she did braid my hair into many small plats and cut that off first, apparently to keep and maybe I want to use them once, to decorate my hair with. I don't really get it but didn't question her. We ended up being in the bathroom for a very a long time, laughing and sharing stories about Lucius Regulus, which made her washing my cut hair and making the back of it roughly even, but I didn't mind too much to be fair, it would grow back anyway. She used magic to get rid of any small hairs that would irritate my back before focusing on making it stay the way I wanted it to and have it naturally fall that way, towards the left with the part slightly towards the right but it more or less looked even. When we were done, near to lunch she smiled happily and finally showed me a mirror, grinning when I smiled happily giving her a hug "It's amazing!! I love it!" Daffodil kissed my head and let me run off to get changed so we could go to lunch.
"Sir, I didn't know that he'd left our dorm, although in Transfiguration yesterday he, Pansy and Theo were being cruel to Hermione, because she and Ron were late in class. And Draco called her a m-mudblood." Snape looked at me, questionably I blinked "Sir? What does that word mean?" I asked Ron had been the one to console her when he found her.
city I thought, as we walked the short distance to a Primark store , I smiled as I practically ran toward the top floor, just to see the 'homeware' mostly the cushions, before Draco, managed to catch me and take back down to the second floor "Harry, come on, we're here for a reason." I nodded and walked alongside Draco and Lucius, although Draco quickly realised that I held little interest in boyish clothing, and kept looking at the ground floor. "Harry, do you want to go downstairs?" Draco kneeled down and whispered, for no pure reason, I turned around and smiled "Please can we?" I asked a little loudly as Lucius turned around from where he was standing and a few others turned to look at us "Please can you what, Harry?" I answered the question before Draco could even open his mouth "Go downstairs?" Draco laughed and just took me to the ground floor before his father could answer.
I felt someone soft breathing, by my neck carefully moving to face whoever was beside me, I saw a small ball of navy blue. I carefully tried to sit up, but Cygnus was glued to my side, I gave up trying and just laid back down, only to feel the bed move and a sniffle "Where's Papa?" I looked up to see Cygnus' lip quiver, I immediately held him "Hey, hey, Draco will be here soon, no need to cry." I carefully rocked him in my arms, I was sure it was only a matter of time before his sister woke up, but Draco would be back soon, I hoped.
A smile was what he got back in return "Quick as it possibly could be, and should you want it I'll return your wand." Lord Voldemort paused, as of thinking of a response, "Don't fret over your ring Draco, you'll still have a neck after this."
She sat down and placed her head in her hands, sighing, collecting her thoughts as she rubbed her temples. I let her do this, watching over the rim of my cup, I notice that she's either absolutely shameless or was in a hurry to leave the palace. "You know him best, don't you? After me?" I didn't have to question who she was talking about, although I did think that she rushed in for Draco, not his uncle. Either way, I nod, she is indeed correct, and I have known Lucius for a very long time, but not as long as her.
"I'll be talking to Miniver after this." Draco stopped him "Sev! It wasn't her fault, I turned around and cut my cheek on a knife." He explained, holding onto Snape's robe, as he led him into the bathroom, while I was left outside in his office. They came out five minutes later with Draco looking calm and happy, despite the bandage around his face "He says your in trouble for poking me." I groaned and knocked my head back "I never meant to hurt you though." I asked as he snuggled himself on my lap. "I know you didn't." I nodded and I slolwy though about how to ask my question "Draco, you don't have to answer but what are you?" Draco opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again and repeated the sequence twice before finally answering "I'm a GlassDoll, Harry, my father blames himself, but it's what I am, and it can't be helped." I looked at him with soft eyes "People are just too careless with me." This explains everything! He gasped as I wrapped my arms around him "Harry? What are you doing?" I kept him as close to me as I possibly could and said: "Never letting you go." I felt him smile and loosened my grip just a bit. "I'm fine with it."
I walked down to where my uncle sleeps, and knock on the door, I waited in my nightie by his bedroom door, "It's really cold, why did he have to choose this room of all things, right by the wine cellar. I waited for a further ten minutes before he opened the door "Oh Draco? What are you doing here?" I swayed on my heel, and sucked my bottom lip, and looked at him "I-I need you, I've made my decision." He looked at me and nodded, motioning me to come in and go to the bathroom, "You could wait another year..." I smiled and leaned by the door "I know, but I trust you more than goblins," He smiled and went to his potions store, while I undressed in his bathroom, slipping into the warm comforting gold tinted water with rose scented bubbles, I sank my body down below the water level and blew bubbles, laughing at my own childishness. I felt my hair spread out and flow creating a path in the water, I heard a knock on the door and slowly wished to fade  into depth of the ceramic tub, I knew two things; this would hurt me more than any crucio I've ever felt, and two I wouldn't feel most of it, unless I got out soon, "Draco, are you okay?"
My suggestion was taken into immediate effect and we soon met with Daffodil and our two eunuchs. Breakfast was served and in no time at all were we back on our carriages to the last fifteen minutes of the journey.
Draco lost me within seconds, to say the least, he went round every single section trying to find me, he did when i tugged at his sleeve "Draco, how much money am I allowed to make you spend?" He looked thankful he found me, or rather I found him, but he looked deeply confused
Getting off the train we walk towards Draco's parents, we smiled and Draco hugged them both, "I hope you two are well, Draco, who?" He fublmed with his robe and faced his worried pearnts "Niel Tracer fifth year, Alarick Brakeson seventh year." His parents looked at each other and held him close "Draco, when we get home, you are following what Healer Marianne gave you." He nodded and we apprrated to the lobby and was left with Lucius. "Harry, we don't blame you for what happened, and if you want to go to sleep for a while just go up to the thrid floor and down two doors to the left." I nodded and tols him that it was fine and went the way he said.
"Just to double check, we have Lucius Malfoy, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, Minver McGonagall." I nodded and set the papers down on my desk. For now, there was nothing to do, we didn't have any attack to be aware of, no one to really be the lookout for. Everything was normal, so naturally, Jack went back to his department, as me Allison moved to our respective desks "Your following Severus, I'll take Malfoy, and Auror Tonks will watch Lupin."
"He was angry, about a chair, then he dropped Scabbers in a metal pot.." my explanation was rough and jagged, I could hardly think, Draco ran a hand through my hair and placed a cooling charm on me, calming me down.
Harry bit his lip, almost chewing it as he fiddled with his robe sleeve, "Well it's just I always get the impression that we don't really get a choice in what happens, that we can't say no." he whispered, lightly rubbing his eyes as he looked up at me. I blinked once, then twice my mouth going slightly dry because in a way Harry was right but I didn't want to tell him that, it wouldn't be fair to tell Harry after Remus and Sirius had probably been trying to make Harry feel comfortable and safe here, and I didn't want to mess that up. "I mean, no one here really says no to anything, so I assumed we couldn't."
I'm leaving at dawn so that I get the best chance to get home, I also see the Imperial carriage go trough Surrey; I don't know how good of a thing that is. Apparently one of them lives in Surrey, but the Emperor doesn't know in what conditions. I simply hope I get home in time to say goodbye if I have to.
"Two weeks ago, we were at a party for a friend's birthday, someone, took me." Was all he gave me as an explanation, I stayed with him the whole day.
"Hey, Harry can I ask you something?" I nodded and sat down on a plush bench. I assume Draco was under the impression that we were both boys so it didn't really matter if we saw each other change, I never really cared. "In the car, what did you mean by 'I think freakishly'?" I bit my lip and looked away for a few seconds after.
"Is this a Malfoy Estate?" I asked dumbly, of course, it was, why would Draco's sister live elsewhere? Draco gently brushed my arm, also looking up at the Manor from the window of the taxi. We were about a mile away but the space around us was bare and green, it was easily visible.
Slowly I heaved open the heavy barrier band stepped inside, the portrait's face softened and looked pitiful. "Father, I finally found you." I speed-walked towards him an got picked up in one motion, my eyes sparkled with glee as I rested my head over my father's heart.
had anything to do with it in the first place. Now I'm really starting to sound like a kid. I mean, clearly they don't know a thing about Slytherin, I would have thought that Weasel might, I mean his family might have made them look for prominent traits in the family, and blonde hair and grey eyes were
I bid my uncle farewell with a kiss before wrapping a cloak around my shoulders, I could tell that he was concerned for my wellbeing, I would be too if I hadn't of been trusted with my own life. Setting off on foot, as exercise did everyone well. Plus we would be carried in the morning anyway. Little Moon let me into the Palace but warned me that he might not be in the best mood to speak, I nod and thank her for the warning. Even before I reach the doors I could hear his yelling, emotionless but angry, he was in pain I could tell. My hand brushes the handle as I gently pull it open. Walking around towards his office, the screams got louder and even more wrenching. I plastered on a brave face. Tom was our Emperor, he won't be made a fool of by some appointed man!
His face changed before speaking again "Stephaine, can I propose something to you?" I looked at him and nodded "My family and I need a maid for our son, he's the same age as you, in return for you accepting, we'll give you somewhere to live, food and clothing as well as send you to any school you wish to attend." I thought about it, I bit my lip and answered.
Naturally, you would think that as soon as I was given the task of leading a segment of the Court I would rush to tell my uncle and aunt? That is exactly what I didn't do, so Lucius had no idea. "Thank you, for telling us, I'll deal with this." my uncle turned to me surprised with a raised eyebrow, I only smile and kiss his cheek. Our eunuch rests against me and sighs relieved that they are safe. "Go back to your room and sleep, we won't call on you for the remainder of the day," I said softly sending them off with a light push.
I awoke with a jolt and something like a shriek "Harry, what's wrong?" I held onto Draco's shirt and took deep breaths
I looked up at a girl with waist length hair that was held up by a black headband, it was the same colour as Lucius and Draco's. She was wearing white coloured robes, with the Ministry coat of arms embroidered on her jacket. Her ice blue eyes looked soft as she descended the short stairs towards her family. I backed away, the last thing I wanted was to be the third wheel.
"I used to go to Ilvenmorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, they had a muggle counterpart, as America had no Statute of Secretary as MACUSA realised how useful muggles knowing the magical community was, although not everyone liked the idea, it wa s erased after Britain's Wizarding War, the muggles that go, mostly learn theory and how magic is actually used along with our normal muggle education. It's mainly hidden by a cloud, although some of the students can't see it, I can as well as every other Magical school there is, I'm sure, the only girl I liked was Georgina Parkinson, she was the only one that was down-to-earth, and Matthew Patrick and Nathan Smith, Jason and Chris are two muggle boys, when we all met, we all made friends quickly, I was about to start my 'first year' as my birthday was two weeks ago, doctor."
Blood fillied his mouth immediately as his tounge met the bin where his hands were. He spluttered and spit into a bowl. He took the cup of water, cold he noticed, to help him explell the irony, metallic taste coating his mouth. It took five cups of water before it finally stopped.
A few hours later, when I had given up on reading my book, and thus asked Hermione to place it back on the bookshelf, for I was too tired to move, Hermione ran to my side from where she was outside "Lady Malfoy is" she took a deep breath to try and talk properly "outside, should I let her in?" I blinked putting her sentence together. Of course, I didn't mind, but I felt so tired and drained. In the end, I nodded, I simply wouldn't move from my padded and comfortable chair and hoped Draco didn't mind.
He happily bounced out of bed and ran toward the bathroom, a few seconds later I could hear him turn on the bath tap. Sighing I stood up, Merlin I felt so tried and dead. But I was willing to wash Harry's hair for him as I had been for a few weeks at this point.
"What takes up too much of your time?" I thought about it, before smiling, Maybe this could be fun "I'd say homework, I spend normally about two hours on one pice of homework.", she smiled and most likely made a mental note of my answer, "Okay, what’s your favourite drink?" I spent a long time thinking, before answering with mint tea. About twenty minuets later, she began to ask more personal questions "What are three of the most significant numbers in your life?"
"You can always get off Draco, I haven't chained you to the chair," He whispered against my ear, his hands resting at my hips. I knew he wasn't lying and that I could just move away from him, but somehow I didn't move. When he noticed I was most likely going to stay he leaned back; I let out a breath I didn't notice I was holding. Only then did he continue speaking "I can't dispose of her, I just can't, however correct you are. But that is not why I assume you came in?" I must admit that he can read me like an open book, maybe that's why he likes to test and push boundaries with me. "It's about the Minister isn't it?" Tom's tone suddenly shifts, his body slums and his eyes grow heavy, his hair is turning grey. I can't let this continue.
We have no Empress; I have lived here since my sixteenth. I am a concubine of the second Imperial rank. I requested to stay with my uncle; to make myself seem less of a threat, it's working. The Emperor views me as a favourite among the others. That could be because of my uncle, for reasons I do not wish to document.
I went to nod, and realised that he couldn't see me, pushing my head from the water, spitting out the mouthful I had, looking very much like a mermaid as I did so, "I'm fine, Sev honestly, I'll just be awhile..." I heard a soft chuckle and a sofa sink down, I smile at my small win, and sunk back down, only simply prolonging the inevitable. I pulled myself out around thirty minutes later, wrapped in a towel, head to toe.
It was 5:33 am on the 31st of July for me and I couldn't sleep. So naturally, I decided to write a little Birthday One-Shot for Harry. Just off the bat, they are halfway through sixth year. They own a small apartment that mostly Draco paid for.
Chapter ten: October 5th - 10th > The pov changes to Harry as he's sick and being taken care of by Remus and Sirius, Tom comes to visit him and it makes Harry feel a better but he eventually has to leave and Draco sends Harry a letter explaining their situation.
"Head Auror Malfoy, Auror Little and Hit Wizard Wilson requesting your presence in Auror Unit DE.C.M." I nodded to the intern already heading towards our Unit. Today was stressful, my family puls Harry would be here, and staying with me, because of his two Ministry Personelle would be around my estate, one inside the building and the other watching. My only problem was that Hit Wizard [] had encountered my father and almost caused his death in the previous war.
While they were talking and playing with my hair, I hadn't noticed the hours fly by and before any of us knew we were pulling into another Temple for lunch, until we heard Susan's voice call us up. That and Regulus' face in the window with a smile, they were so free. It was why I liked them, they were able to be themselves, whatever that was since Regulus was a natural wildcard. "Do you three want lunch?" Regulus asked as I magically pulled down the window "The temple is shut for entering at the moment but they'll happily give us the food to take over here." This was, of course, met with the price of a few Galleons.
Ilvermorny was a strange school, I had already known about MACUSA stand on muggles 'no-majs' as they called them muggles knew about our world, knew about magic. Neptune said that it would be inevitable as they 'Harry Potter' books and films became major. What I found strange was in the inclusion of muggle classes, lessons like chemistry, History etc.
I heard small footsteps and the door closing. I was curled up beside the spare bed, the one I was supposed to sleep on. A minute later I felt a hand on my arm, it felt cold and dry. "Were you outside?" I whispered, hiding my face at the sound of my own horse voice, quiet from disuse.
It was a few hours later when I saw Draco again after lunch, apparently, after I left to the Library Draco went back to bed to rest. I came in to get a book, and I saw him, softly sleeping the light lavender cover wrapped to his neck and his arm over it, resting his head on the pillow. I sat down and watched him, silently I pulled down the curtain and went to leave the room. I opened the door and waited, I heard a soft ruffle of bed sheets and a soft quite hum. Turning back around I saw Draco sitting down and looking at me. I had seen him before only just a few hours ago, but it still took me by surprise, he still took my surprise. "Harry, where are you going?"
Hogwarts had been shut down temporarily, all students were to move to different schools; me, Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Hermione and Ron had moved to Ilvernmory. It was a terrible event, we were to start our fourth year in another country. The ICW had heard about the actions of older years in Hogwarts and had released an inquiry into the school. It meant that Draco and others had to provide statements and show in the Wizarding Government.
My mother placed a charm on me that would enable me to voice my thoughts "You actually did that?" I turned to my uncle and smiled, he patted me and kissed the crown of my head, "Draco, I did try to not replace anything, honestly but I just had to-" I smiled and shook my head "Sev, it's fine I don't mind, really." I nuzzled his hand as he carefully picked me up and carried me to the get to outside to which Stephine was laying out lunch for all of us.
"What's your name?" Draco asked me, sitting on the plush bench in my room "Stephane Cordato, your father found me last night, I think- How long was I asleep for?" I said looking at him, he sighed and told me that I'd been sleeping for a week,
I was shocked and surprised, I blinked and smiled. I knew what he was saying, I knew what he was asking and I found that I didn't mind, and I rather liked it when he wasn't being a twelve-year-old boy, in situations like these especially. I nodded and smiled at him, getting up and hugging him tightly "So you wouldn't mind if I called you my boyfriend?" I asked looking at him, he laughed and nodded "I don't mind the social label, if it's you." I gigged and let go of him, to sit back on the bed, before I knew I had been laid down and was asleep, only just hearing Draco's soft little murmur in my ear. Turning around I nuzzled into him.
I was motionless upon entering the City. My eunuchs had to carry me to my and my uncle's Palace because I simply lacked the motivation to move for myself. The extravagance of the City no longer appealed to me in my current state; neither did the pretty animals and plants. I felt so alone and so empty; as the gods have punished me for some unknown crime I had committed. I was carried like a coffin. A large wooden structure held my and my luggage weight on the shoulders of eunuchs. At one point I laid down on the thin mattress; sighing quietly and empty. I had not wished to be bothered by what I had I missed, but the eunuchs told me anyway. I didn't have the energy to tell them to be quiet. I did not care what the Amber King did in his time or with his chosen concubines. When we reached the gate they began to put me down, I made no movement to get off the 'carriage' and they were forced to carry the weight for another kilometre.
"I need to talk to him, about Cygnus and Aliette, I simplify scared." She gently pulled back his hair, and wiped away tears "You have Harry, and your parents, you have no need to be afraid, he can't hurt you anymore. You don't need to apologise to me, he got what he deserved." She went back to her seat as Draco turned around.
He laughed and kissed my hair "No not, really I want to buried with my parents regardless of whether I'm married or not, but I do like the idea, because it would mean that depending on what I chose to do around the time of my birthday next year means that I wouldn't be completely trapped in a 40cm by 15cm dome with a doll stand inside, Also it gives Cygnus and Aliette something to remember me by, as well as anyone else I care about." I smiled and laid back down on his lap, my History Of Magic book lay forgotten on the bed.
Quickly eloping Draco in a tight hug, she muttered something into his ear before turning her gaze onto her parents "Mama, papa!" She jumped up, resting her head on their shoulders. As they carefully looked her over and exchanged words and light kisses, Draco not far behind. "Merlin I missed you so much, especially you baby brother." Draco blushed as she bumped his nose. "You must be Harry, my brother's told me all about you in his letters, I'm Neptune. " I glanced at Draco who was busy looking at flowers.
It's been a few weeks, Harry hasn't been raised well. I noticed that immediately, so does Severus. I've held off talking to him about it, letting him settle in first, but I will talk to him about it at least, that and his ill and sickly appearance.
He handed me a small phial, with light pink liquid inside I took it and popped it open and downed the contents, and immediately felt numb, frozen. I could still see and feel, although the latter was extremely small. I saw him hover over me, my quality of sight, however, was scratchy, as if looking through frosted or broken glass which was actually what my eyes were coated in. I felt a small chisel and a blunt knife cracked the glass covering my eyes and lifted it off, careful to not let a small piece go into my eye. "Damm it." I realised that I couldn't move my eyes, I heard him walk off and get my mother. The next thing I knew I couldn't see a thing, my vision as was black as charcoal, but felt mild pain, and I could imagine I'd get a very big headache soon, maybe.
My uncle has been teaching me mind arts, I haven't gotten all that far, not really. I want to be as good as my aunt by next month; she can stop everyone but Tom's invasion of her thoughts and can read the thoughts of all eunuchs ae well as the first three concubines. I hadn't realised how long we had been like this until my uncle looked up from his book "Can I ask what you're doing?" Regulus immediately went explain and he was in such a panic and mess that, when I sat up I held his hand. He had been stumbling over words and shaking.
Together the three of us walk to breakfast; I a lot slower than them. I shoo away anyone from tries to comfort me, taking my place beside my uncle. Daffodil's attendance surprises many of the concubines here. The Emperor starts the meal but I have no appetite for the selection of rice, toast, or anything else on the table. I feel someone watch me as I play around with the toast on my plate. I look up and notice a small boy; teen really, glances back down at his plate; he's leaning on Remus as if for physical support. Somehow he looks as upset as I am. I can't help but feel like he wants to talk to me after breakfast. I know my uncle won't let me spend all day in our Palace, and neither will Daffodil. Instead, I take a walk through the City.
A few hours later, I was led to a small area of the Manor, holding about 4 expensive-looking cars, I held my breath and looked around "We go into Muggle London for normal clothes, although I'm expecting you're not one for silk and satin are you?" I shook my head and smiled "No, besides I actually want to look like a normal kid, although I like velvet." we laughed until I heard the door open, I turned around and bit my tongue to stop myself making unnecessary noise. "Harry, come on." Draco said opening the passenger door to the car "Umm-I..." I stuttered and looked down, Draco sat on his knees and lifted my head "Harry, it's okay I promise.", I smiled and he lent in " If you feel that bad you could sit on my lap." I blushed and smiled
While Daffodil was reading, quiet happily, Alice was rummaging through her things. Opening and closing drawers, checking under her bed and inside her bathroom. She had been tasked with spying on the concubine, on the request of the Empress, on the request that she try to find anything of which her mistress could use against the traitorous another concubine. Currently, she had found absolutely nothing, no exquisite gifts, no special given robes, hairpins, headdresses. Nothing! There were no letters or cards. Almost as if the concubine was just a slut that spread her legs for Lucius and Lucius only. There was no chance of her going through his palace alive. She would be found and killed publicly in the City, most likely at breakfast, the Emperor would do nothing to stop the spill of her blood. He had already disposed of his own eunuchs for several reasons. She wasn't being another body buried in the ground, in the river or given to the wolves for food.
"I know he will, that's what happens you shoot someone twice in the stomach." I didn't mean it rudely, although I was still angry over it, I had almost lost my father and Godfather that day. He looked down, with a small smirk. Those gunshots won us the war. Everybody remembers what he said before it 'One to miss, two to shoot; I'd say hit one once, the other twice. Leave them as food for the wolves.
Harry smilied at me, nodding, somehow I think Harry understands me a lot better than others. Other than Blaise and Pansy but even then they are literal fourteen year olds. Harry, something about him, is so advanced and knowledgeable it's comforting. Kind of like my uncle.
My hands shake, my skin is warm, I take a deep breath. Arms wrap around me, soft pale lips whispering against my neck. It's all too much. I lean against the solid rock of my uncle's chest, gathering up my sole courage. "Keep him away." I felt him nod and he lightly kissed my cheek. No question as to who I meant, no question as to why. It was simply made. While we were talking a well-dressed man came up towards me, about 1.69cm in height. My uncle immediately reacted away from me and I almost fell, if not for the stage I was practically displayed on. "We meet again I see." I smile at the older man, nodding my head. Daffodil's eunuch was always my favourite. He quickly took my measurements and nodded sharply. "Do you want what we agreed on last week or something more, fitting?" He said, making a strange waving hand movement, clearly, he had the same opinion as me on what was brought out last week.
Harry's sleeping soundlessly beside me, smiling. So I can take a very good guess and say he's having a wonderful sleep, as he should be at 4:37 in morning. He curled around a small blanket he brought with him , chewing on it for seemingly no reason.
"Do you have any idea about why I've called you here?" I shook my head, how I was I? He just decided to call me away from my friends on a Friday. Really what had I done? Although this could be about my sudden movement away from Draco, he seemed fine enough. But he was already gone when I woke up. Even I can't deny that I didn't sleep well last night; away from him.
One-hundred and fifty-six days until the end of the year. Dammit! It's my birthday and I can't stop thinking about him? Draco would laugh at me. Talking of my everloving and an endearing boyfriend who is making so much noise downstairs, he's either fighting a lion, baking or decorating. I hope it's baking.
"Harry, you're over thinking this, way too much." I smiled and nodded, going to eat breakfast I sighed and could overhear Ginny's silly fantasies. I have lost my appetite. Draco laughed and looked over at the Gryffindor table "Have you not told her or anything?" I looked at him.
Last year I sent someone a wrapped box with a green bow. Inside was a selection of chocolate and snake things I had found. I received back an oddly toned letter to expect similar for my birthday, it was unsigned but I could tell his handwriting anywhere.
About two hours later, a soft hand was brushing back my hair "Is the sun up?" I asked faintly, rolling over to face Draco "Yes it is, good morning sleepy head." Draco said blowing air in my face I laughed and sat up, my glasses were carefully placed on my face and I blinked. Draco was wearing a light blue nightie thing with his hair falling out of the plat it was apparently in all night, his small lips were red and looked like they were glowing in the yellow light. "Harry, if you're done with looking at me, I'd recommend that you start to get dressed." I blushed and looked down before getting out of the bed and going through my trunk. "Umm Draco?" I mumbled, "I don't have any actual clothes, the ones I have used to belong to Dudly." He walked up to me and sat down "Harry, it's okay just wear your uniform, we're going shopping first anyway." I nodded and hugged him, he smiled and hugged me back "Come on, let's go."
Moving on, with everything Harry looks at me pleasingly; something about that look makes me want to do something for him.
Breakfast couldn't have come sooner. I had seen Harry walk out and followed after, taking a few minutes longer to get the Great Hall. He was sat with his friends. Avoiding anything would have been much preferable to what I got, of course, I had expected nothing less of Gryffindor's but it still hurt. Only I didn't show it, not until they broke me.
"Stephaine, are you alright?" Lucius asked as I slowly sat down normally and returned to where I was sitting."Lucius, I think we should keep the house elves away from her, she has some sort of fear around them." He nodded as Draco sat next to me, and held my hand. I smiled at him and lunch went on with out drama."Hey Steph, what odd smell do you really enjoy?" I looked at Draco and blinked Why does he want to know? "Umm, the smell of Sharpies, there these inky pens that have this toxic smell, but I love it, I have a packet of them, there mostly colours, although I have gold, sliver and the metallic ones as well."
He leaned into my hand, moving directly next to me, resting his head on my shoulder. "Harry darling, it's his job to drive, besides I hate drivers of any kind and they all know." A look of hesitation flickered over Harry's face, gently I stroked his cheek "Don't hurt yourself trying to make sense of things I do, you might never understand." Before he had the chance I pressed a kiss to his forehead. A single sweet moment in the chaos that the at week had been.
I can't remember anything, other than pure heat, I remember major cramp pain, and the feeling on flat metal and glass, drying glass. When I woke up, I noticed that everything was brighter, I looked around the room, and only managed to hear sounds of voices, I figured that I was still in a state of unresponsiveness. I assume it stayed that way for a few minutes. "Draco?" I tried to sit up, and felt someone push me up and lean me on them, I coughed and inhaled, "Harry, Draco's fine, he just can't talk and will have trouble moving, and hearing things." Severus spoke quietly, and softly I could tell, but it was almost in vain, his voice still made my ears ring.
I couldn't help but think that Ron meant You-Know-Who. Tom Marvolo Riddle, looking over at the Slytherin Table. "Well, his son lives in America, if that's any consolation."
"Hello, good morning!" I jumped slightly, hearing Draco's small chuckle from above me. "I am Auror Little, welcome Auror Unit 4 DE.C.M." We all nodded, it didn't take a genius to figure out what that stood for Death Eater Control and Management. "Just behind me is Auror Poppy, she's head of our Unit. We also have Auror Ryan and our Head Auror, Auror Neptune, she's currently at lunch break."
husband, all those other concubines were just whores and children thieves. It wasn't anything political that she was concerning her pretty head about. But rather than a blonde boy, she was worried about what was happening to him. Not because of his parents, of course, she hated this how this many days of Mourning that was required across the city. It was pointless to her, so what they died. A teenager is now an orphan. Bo ho, go cry me a river, Draco needs to learn to grow up, Lucius too, they're both weak and cowardly. What the Empress was worried about was quite simply that he was being too liked too quickly. He's a spoilt brat and so is that Potter boy.
"Harry, you do have a phone right?" Draco asked me cupping my face, I bit my lip and shook my head "Only Dudley was given a phone because Dudley was good, I wasn't allowed a phone because I'm freak, freaks don't deserve good things." Lucius stopped the car suddenly and I clung to Draco as it jolted, "Harry, why do your aunt and uncle call you a freak?" Lucius asked me, I looked up at him "Becuase I do freakish things, and I think freakishly, that's why I'm not allowed a bedroom and why I do all the chores, so I can be good like Dudly." I felt Draco wrap his arms around me and hold me close to him "What do you mean you don't have the bedroom?" I looked down and fidgeted with my tie "I sleep in the cupboard under the stairs, although now I have a room but the put bars on the window, to stop Hedwig from flying and they lock my room with many locks from the outside."
"Harry I'm a dark wizard by nature, once you grow up with something, you begin to see it as normal, even if you know it'd wrong. Maybe if  I hadn't grown up around Marvolo, I wouldn't be as much as a dark wizard as I am now, but I didn't so hearing the killing curse and unforgivables  it just became normal." He said resting his head on my shoulder, I took a deep breathe, it felt odd hearing such words and in a serious tone from a cute looking small child. "So you're going to become a death eater next year?" I asked looking at him, he nodded "Just to get revenge on those who hurt me." I nodded and stood up slowly "Harry, are you okay?" I smiled and told him I was fine, he didn't lookm that convinced but we went to breakfast together anyway.
His voice was still a bit harsh and raw, but you could hear the difference, it was softer, and seemed younger. I blinked and let go of the door handle "I-I just came to get a book from my trunk..." I didn't know whether I was in trouble or not, I had just came into his room, while he was resting. Draco beckoned for me to come closer if I was afraid I didn't know and didn't care.
"I'll give it a week." I decided, looking at them both, smiling when they both nodded and left me alone for a while as they got changed into something more comfortable for being at home. Daffodil coming out first, sitting on the chair beside the bed, watching me look up at the ceiling before glancing at her "What is it?" I ask, noticing her smile a little.
"Your father will recognise, me within seconds, he won't trust me." I smiled tightly, the duel had lasting effects on my father, the stress from it had caused my baby brother to be born prematurely by one month. That and uncles privet wing had been shot with muggle artillery.
As such I decided to not go into Ilvernmorny today at all, Harry begged to stay with me at 'home' my parents reluctantly agreed. So we're both staying in and I'm reading a long list of what to expect from the difference trials. Harry's on my lap reading a textbook.
I woke up with blue light streaming in through the window, and an arm wrapped around me, opening my eyes I squinted to see, and failed "Morning Harry."
"Not from here, I need shoes but the one they sell here always break after a few weeks or months." I hid behind Lucius as the lady was scanning all the clothes, I'd ended up picking out a good amount of things, I may have gone a bit crazy. When she was done I heard the price £181 for thirteen things
When we got to the dining room, his parents looked at me and gave me a pitiful smile "On the bright side, we are going shopping soon after breakfast, Draco that will be after we get back, maybe an hour after." He nodded and I eyed the food on the table, "Harry, you can have as much as you want, honestly." I took half an apple, it was all I was allowed with the Dursleys. Narrissca was watching me carefully as if trying to see just what my habits were. "Harry, come on, you have to eat some more than that." I looked at her as Draco placed a slice of toast on my plate, "Just eat as much as you can, I know how you feel." I felt Draco whisper in my ear as I took a bite out of his toast.
Sadness had hung over me, by sunlight. I had no wish to be around everyone at breakfast. I had the will to eat, but not drink the orange skin tea prepared for us. I gladly accepted bathing with my uncle, he was the only family he had left, I hadn't realised how easily everything could be snatched away from me. I swore not to make the same mistake twice. It was before breakfast when our chamber door opened, my uncle smiled at her, although it was sad and broken smile. One that shouldn't rest upon his face. She walked towards his with such elegance she could have thought the floor was eggshells. Her dress was dusted pink, so light and open you could mistake it for thin fabric draped over her body. Her long blonde hair was down, cascading down her back.
"Harry, as much as it seems like it, my uncle doesn't want to kill you." I nodded and watched as Cygnus and Aliette, slept and gently whacking each other in their sleep, Draco, patted down their hair and brushed back their hair over their ears. Soon I find myself going to sleep, seduced by a soft lullaby.
Draco lifts some of the wood and smilies slightly "It's a thing we have to build." He pauses to look at my face, screaming 'obviously.' He laughs "I think it's for the balcony." I nod and we get to work on it, while a movie plays in the background.
