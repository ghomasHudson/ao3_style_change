Harry was thinking, with some difficulty, as Draco went on with his insistent rocking. He tried to pretend it wasn’t driving him mad with want, and took a short steadying sip of warming amber.
Stroking himself with the same slickness he’d used to stretch, Harry readily pointed up and in, shuddering and slowly engulfed in too much perfection.
“Fuck, that feels good,” he breathed in a pleasure-shock, his cock swelling with an undeniable throb of interest as Draco taunted at sensitive places, nudging up on his taint and teasing over his balls with a dangerously good pressure.
When he woke some time later, it was to find that Draco had not been so lucky—his narrow fingers clutched tensely tight to Harry’s shirt. When he shifted a bit uncertainly, Draco let out a quiet, familiarly-frightened whimper.
As days progressed to weeks, a month and longer, Harry found himself growing more and more frustrated with the entire debacle. It wasn’t the only Field Training he was doing with Savage of course, but he had to guess well over half their field excursions anymore were Dementor-clearing missions.
It was a short walk, and as they approached the squat and otherwise unremarkable brick building, it became clear the shelter was experiencing a bit of a rush. The only other time Harry had seen the queue this long was when he’d visited with Savage on very early mornings.
Draco was already undoing the belt on the suit he insisted on wearing. Harry couldn’t wait any longer either.
Draco’s hand covered over Harry’s on his wand, helping to guide the swirls and whirls of its tip, and Harry huffed out a tight breath, suddenly very distracted.
Harry was trying to counterbalance him past the strong burst of heat it was sending all through him, suddenly so much closer to climax.
Harry was a little ashamed how much of a relief it was when Draco owled to say they should convene. He wanted to go over his newest spell additions, which he’d been working on since the end of May, and to start walking Harry through how to properly string them all together into the base Extension Charm.
It was one more conundrum to add to the pile of them he seemed to be accumulating lately. If he stopped for a moment to take stock of them all at once, he might just transfigure himself into a rock, and spend the rest of his long rock life sitting quietly in a corner somewhere.
Harry didn’t quite manage to get all the mess, but he spent a few seconds curiously licking his fingers clean. When he glanced up again, Draco was staring in slight astonishment.
Harry’d been thanking him rather a lot today, and Malfoy continued to shrug it off as if he weren’t being unusually helpful. He wasn’t sure why he had to be such a stubborn prat about it, but then it was Malfoy, so perhaps he did know.
As Harry hurried to strip himself, Draco’s reflection only needed to smirk at him for his cock to give another eager twitch.
Harry yawned abruptly. “Sorry, I’m properly worn out from this morning…I don’t suppose we have time for a quick afternoon nap before you go off for your research?”
There was a hardness in her voice that made him a bit sad, but she was right. He shrugged as they joined a short but scattered queue of guests for an open Floo home.
Better late than never! Thank you all very much for reading and for the feedback. Hopefully it's worth the wait. Enjoy!
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “If we start anything else now, I’m not sure we’ll get back to the spells.”
The tickling scent of cinnamon drifted Harry’s way, and he found himself watching Malfoy take in a long swallow of the potion. It left a faintly blue stain on his lips, and Harry unconsciously followed the path of Malfoy’s tongue to clear them.
“Oh yes. Stephen.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, he might’ve been a Hufflepuff he was so perpetually cheerful, but he was very fit. I’m shocked you remember him when I barely do.”
Harry inhaled a little unsteadily, feeling his cheeks heat, and felt incredibly foolish for it—but Draco was very close. He must have noticed, but he didn’t acknowledge Harry’s flustering, save the hint of a small knowing smirk.
No one asked what Malfoy had needed to speak with him about, which Harry was grateful for, but he noticed a few curious looks anyway.
Harry could hear annoyance in the dry witticism of course, but there was something else glinting in gray eyes, some wicked sort of question Harry was not entirely sure he had an answer for.
They were laughing and poking fun, but he was always on the lookout for an opening, and he threw for it every time—even if Ron caught two out of every three throws. He really was an excellent Keeper. Harry supposed he might’ve gone professional too, if George hadn’t needed him so badly at the shop, without Fred.
Draco’s sputter somewhat resembled a laugh. “It’s hardly my fault you only packed denims and t-shirts, is it?”
It had only been a light drizzle earlier in the morning, but given they would be exploring in Muggle London, Harry had thought to bring an umbrella.
“As far as I know it’s been years since they last met, well before the war started up again…obviously she wasn’t meant to be doing it in the first place. Father would’ve disapproved.”
The rest of Harry’s summer developed quite a bit differently than his spring had. Ginny was home all the time now, and would be until August when her pre-season training started again.
When he rolled his hips, shifting the thrust of his cock much more directly and speeding up, Draco came on the stairs—and Harry hadn’t even needed to touch his cock to make him do it. Draco’s body tensing against his own was too hot then, and too tight, giving Harry a final needed push into a surging thrum of bliss.
“I’ve got some questions I’d like to ask about the conditions around here, also about the people you help, what you think they might need. It’s been causing a bit of a…magical pest problem in the area and it’s becoming a little much to handle for a number of departments—including my own… If you’ve got the time to spare, of course.”
He waved him off to do up the belt himself, and Harry settled for joining him a step or two up for a kiss. Draco pressed into it for the space of a second, but he pulled back straightaway, taking a few quick steps up to the tapestry-lined corridor at the top of the stairwell.
Draco made an attempt to redirect him. “What do you think of this one then? It’s…well it’s not dry now obviously, but it’s not completely flooded either. It looks flat enough. What does your little paper have to say about it?”
There was that infuriating smirk again, like Malfoy knew a big secret he was deliberately keeping from Harry. “Come here then. You won’t have to do that.”
For once it appeared Draco hadn’t noticed him staring, and he started slightly at the sound of Harry’s voice. His lips pursed with his impatience.
Staring blearily unfocused, it took Harry a moment to absorb that many words into any sort of meaning.
“How’s Hermione?” He spotted her now and then at work, but hadn’t really had the chance to talk to her recently.
Listening for the soft crunch of footsteps farther in, he followed the sound, with no sense of self-preservation at all.
But Draco finally did pull back, to pose what Harry already considered to be the definitive question of the evening. “How would you like to fuck me, then?”
They appeared not too far from the shelter, popping one after the other into an alley hopefully tucked away enough to escape notice of any curious Muggles, or anyone else. Harry did a quick survey of the area, determining that was really the case before he started leading them toward a slightly busier street. He immediately missed his trainers, the pebbly pavement crunching too loud under the dress shoes Draco’d insisted he wear.
They sat in the armchair longer than they maybe should’ve kissing and mostly naked, but eventually Draco let him up. They cast a couple charms, cancelled another, and dressed in surprisingly comfortable silence, seeming to have mostly recovered their dignity from all the passion and emotion of the day.
On the way, he spotted the woman who’d first directed him to Cassie’s office months ago, a plastic badge on her shirt brightly proclaiming her name to be Sally.
Scrawling out a quick note on a small scroll of parchment, he sent it off late morning with Ginny’s owl—though he’d had to ply her with treats to do it. He was pretty sure she was annoyed at him for sending her back and forth to Wiltshire so often lately, but the treats were effective.
Someone had been kind enough to transfigure a blanket for him. He could feel the telltale tingle of another person’s residual magic around him as he sat upright, a new skill he had been picking up from one of his Auror classes. When he cancelled the spell, a small leaf floated down into his lap in its place.
Draco surged forward, pushing up to crash their lips together again, bucking to meet his last few jolting thrusts as Harry spurted hot inside him.
Harry got a bit lost reexploring the taste of his tongue. Finding he couldn’t pull out very far without losing the tension keeping them so close, he worked his cock in a quickening shallow rhythm, all his force in his impact. Draco pushed back into everything Harry gave, his moans reverberating into Harry’s mouth at each rough shock of their meeting hips.
“I’m still looking into the specifics, but the real key is to sort out what’s actually needed. No point putting in unnecessary effort on bits and bobs that aren’t essential. Obviously, you need more information. You’re flying blind—you don’t understand the problem enough to solve it.”
The glow of antlers made it momentarily difficult to see before his stag coalesced enough to charge at the threatening swarm, bursting a bright glow through the alley, outshining the otherwise dull afternoon light.
He’d seen Draco unconscious before, by Harry’s own doing even, but never sleeping like this—his face entirely relaxed and unguarded, his lips ever so slightly parted, and a furrow occasionally passing over his brow as he slept. The sight of him completely at rest was mesmerising, and it took Harry a moment to shake himself into reality and acknowledge that he should perhaps not be standing there transfixed should Draco happen to wake up—it was a bit creepy.
Draco chuckled as he set about playing at the head of Harry’s cock with his tongue. Harry got noisy again, but that only seemed to encourage Draco to tease more, until Harry was a flustered mess beneath him.
It was awkward to navigate. Harry regretfully found himself spending more time at the office than he strictly needed to most nights, to avoid sitting at the kitchen table, talking of empty things and avoiding any real conversations.
They were heading back out of the kitchen now, and Draco veered close enough to bump their shoulders.
“Perfect, then.” Harry was kind of surprised it could be that easy. And a bit suspicious. “And that won’t be a bother to the people who actually should be there?”
Harry sorted the bill, and finished his tea. He was already late meeting Savage at the park—but he needed a moment to prepare himself for another long afternoon chasing his worst nightmares down the streets of London.
But he would do it anyway, because people he cared about had asked him to—and because Kingsley could be very persuasive.
When the sound of her steps on the floor above had quieted, Harry finally wandered his way out to the kitchen to start his (decaffeinated) tea.
Friday was the soonest he could find a spare moment for anything, and it was his lunch break—right in the middle of his day Field Training in Muggle London.
When they arrived to the Burrow, Ron wanted to use the Floo to head home, but Molly caught them at the door and obliged them to stay and eat. She also insisted Ron take home food for Hermione as well (‘
Once they looked like normal non-magical lamps, it became a matter of finding a good method of enchanting them all to light as if they were real Muggle lamps. This turned out to be not so easy a task as they might’ve hoped.
But he couldn’t think of it now. They had so much work to do before then—Draco was making real progress. They were so close. He couldn’t fall apart now.
I’m afraid I’ve heard quite a lot about you over the years. Erm, I’m not a witch myself, but—well you know.”
Harry heard an anxious catch in Draco’s breathing as he worked to steady his own through all the screaming, fighting to find his happiest thoughts.
He managed a few hours of sleep on Friday after work, but woke at midnight from a particularly awful dream.
He remained rather cross with himself for having such terrible self-control, but Ginny had not been around much in the last several weeks, and when she was gone Harry felt less the sense of crushing guilt over what he had done—and what he was clearly still thinking of doing far too often.
Draco’s voice held a low edge of promise that drove Harry to pushing off the shed, walking him backward right through the back door and against the kitchen table.
Harry apologised at length for being late, and explained about the Dementors as well, but Cassie waved off his apologies, so they got right to business.
They hit the bedroom door and Harry pressed him up against it, groping for the doorknob but unwilling to stop sucking at the stretch of Draco’s neck his mouth landed on long enough to look what he was doing.
“Fuck it. Why not. Only I’ll be choosing the venue this time—and you’ll need to wear something more sophisticated than denim to get in.”
Harry made it through another busy week, but when the first Saturday of August arrived, his concern over whether or not he’d been a bit of a prick to Draco got the better of him before he had even finished his morning tea.
.” He whispered the Parseltongue name into his ear, and let slip a quieter groan when Draco tensed around his softening cock.
The little house Ginny and Harry now shared was honestly not much of a house at all. Magic had been used to patch-over the worst of its problems, but there were clearly some things even magic couldn’t fix.
Dismissive as he sounded, there was an underlying tension in his tone, obvious enough for Harry to notice it. Maybe Draco didn’t want to discuss this, only he had one more question to ask.
Clever fingers moved sultrily over Harry’s—and on to the supple holly of his wand. Draco stroked lingering and firm where their fingers met on its handle, almost as if he were touching Harry’s cock instead.
“If I’d known you were going to be such a bore, I would’ve come alone. Didn’t they give you an office or somesuch? You can show that off, if it will make you feel better.”
“We’re very nearly through them all. At the rate we’ve been going it should only take a few hours more.” Draco sounded a little distracted by his spell juggling, though Harry marvelled that he was able to have a conversation at all.
They fell into a relatively comfortable silence, only broken when Harry fidgeted unnecessarily and Draco told him to stop, or murmured a quiet spell to widen a pantleg or shorten a sleeve. When he had made all the necessary adjustments, and seemed mostly satisfied with the fit, he turned Harry about in front of the mirrors to get a better look.
Harry wondered how, in such a large room, full of so many people, he still managed to find himself shoulder to shoulder with Malfoy at the drinks table.
Harry came rather forcefully. He was very lucky Draco caught at his hair then and pulled him in for a biting kiss, or he might have fallen right over.
Harry was a bit offended. “I’ve heard plenty of gossip over the years. A lot of it was about me…Although I do recall hearing something in fifth year about you snogging some Ravenclaw bloke in the Astronomy Tower—what was his name again?”
“Ginny says that you’ve been working on something with Draco Malfoy. She said he’s been owling rather a lot… I’m sure you can understand why this might be a bit concerning for anyone who knows—”
” Draco broke to a low moan, arching back, their rhythm growing more erratic as he was caught between Harry’s hand and his cock.
“You designed the potion, Malfoy,” Harry intoned, but he was shifting closer anyway, stopping poised just over the slimmer, slightly taller man—not quite yet touching, though it was taking an incredible amount of his restraint. “You know exactly what it’s telling me to do.”
It wasn’t his invisibility cloak, though he doubted most Muggles would think to look twice at an apparently empty backstreet in broad daylight. Rather than bother answering him, Draco made his intentions quite clear going to his knees on rough pavement to mouth Harry’s cock through his trousers, smoothly sliding open his belt.
An underlying lust lurked in the dark amusement of Draco’s answering laugh, and it had a rising effect on Harry’s cock.
By the time he reached the gates, Harry was mostly decided on an excuse—he just hoped he could deliver it without letting on how close he felt to falling apart with guilt.
As he wandered through the long stone corridors, past the many snoozing portraits of Draco’s platinum-haired ancestors, it took Harry an embarrassingly long time to find the large atrium with the upper levels, where Draco’s bedroom was located.
Cursing breathlessly, Harry summoned the energy to pull him down even more firmly, pushing up harder as skillful hips writhed and thrust under his hold.
They Transfigured the rest of the morning, right up to eleven-thirty, and they’d made a decent dent in shrinking stacks of sheets, adding to their growing pile of drapes, with less than half still to do—but the rest would need to wait.
Thinking back on it, Harry found himself frequently irked at Malfoy’s behaviour that solstice night—with all his smooth talk of deals and satisfaction—despite knowing he was ultimately just as responsible himself. He’d had a choice, and he’d made that choice.
Harry pulled the sheets back to take Draco in hand, whispered a quiet lubrication charm—then switched to hissing again, quickly realising he could get away with saying all sorts of things this way.
As time ticked on as well, Harry could sense the growing undercurrent of her impatience with him. He found himself avoiding that particular conversation at all costs. He didn’t want to make things worse, yet often anything he did say was always the
It felt an odd thing to do, especially as he was still dreaming about him on a semi-regular basis. Far too often, he found himself revisiting what Malfoy had said about the way Harry looked at him—and when he did, his mind’s eye produced a pair of silver eyes, sparked with challenge.
It was too hot, but Harry refused to lose the press of smooth skin on his, palming at the small of his back to pull him insatiably closer—and though he’d argued he couldn’t, was soon thrusting up harder to meet the uninhibited force of Draco’s hips.
He wasn’t sure how long they sat there on the floor of the Hall of Prophecy. Malfoy was still leant back against him, and he found he didn’t particularly mind the feeling at all. He also felt no real urgency to move, despite their less than conventional surroundings. In fact his anxiety of earlier had all but vanished.
Harry smirked at him, but he stepped readily back. Draco was already neatly charming his dropped book back up onto the shelf, not quite meeting his eye.
The conversation had taken such a deep turn so quickly that he was happy for a change of subject, even at his own expense.
The buzz of the city’s bustle was familiar now, a strong breeze dancing between the buildings and persistently pushing at their backs. Not much sunlight was breaking through the low cloud-cover, but after a few days in a cavernous room full of nothing but mirrors and tents, it was nice just to be out and about again.
Just as he remembered, the floor was so reflective it looked as though you could fall right through to the other side. Harry was able to
“There are spells to monitor intent. They’re popular with pubs and clubs and the like, you know. But it’s a hard thing to pin down, intent is malleable—it changes. If you don’t key the spell to respond to the fluctuations, it could cause problems… or simply not work at all.”
“What I know from those willing to talk is they’re coming from all over the county and the outer boroughs. Then you’ve got your immigrants, refugees, kids whose parents have kicked them out—"
He must’ve been getting closer, but when Draco curved one knee up over the high arm of the chair, Harry got a bit sidetracked.
By the time he did let up Draco’s arsecheeks were a much brighter red, and his other cheeks were nearly as flushed, panting softly when Harry pushed pale strands of hair back from his face. Urging him gently to his knees on the bed, Harry got a proper angle to bite at each cheek delicately, nosing between them to swirl at Draco’s arse with his tongue.
Harry chewed his lip anxiously. “Right, sorry, I know it’s a lot to ask. And if you can’t of course I would completely understand—only I can’t afford all this blowing up before I’ve, er—sorted the case, you know. It’s a sensitive legal issue.”
At the time he still hadn’t come up with a method of keeping in touch with her while they worked out the finer points of their plan. It was a couple of weeks later before he finally sorted it.
All he’d been told was he’d be training in Muggle London that day, and that he was to come dressed appropriately for the task, so that he might better blend in. It was one of the few fashion decisions Harry had ever made confidently, turning up in a pair of jeans, beat up trainers and a simple shirt just tight enough not to catch on things and slow him up in an emergency.
“I can let them out, or hem them, as the case may be. I’m fully capable of an adequate tailoring spell.”
Groaning deeply, Harry tugged his fingers out and smacked firm at his arse again. Draco cried out loud, working back on his hands and knees toward the edge of the bed with a pointed lock of silver on green.
With a badly stifled moan he pressed back on the bricks to keep himself upright, and then Draco started teasing with the edge of his teeth, and it was too fucking good.
Harry spent most of Thursday throwing himself into planting a number of herbs and potions ingredients in his pitifully small garden, and trying not to dwell overly on his problems.
Harry couldn’t tell for certain if he was being sarcastic or not, but either way the weather didn’t seem likely to dissipate anytime soon. The clouds moving in their direction only looked darker yet.
“’Afraid so. Starting to become a problem, too. They’ve been… accumulating. ‘Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures are completely overwhelmed, they just can’t keep up, no matter how many times we’ve come in and cleared them away.”
Backing up cautiously, Harry prepared to run again as his Patronus circled back around to catch the last three from behind. The nearer they all got the louder his mother grew, as usual, and it was rarely only her anymore. Lately there were a lot more voices screaming in the mix, and it could get a little overwhelming—but then a grip tightened hard on the wrist of his wand-arm, a flood of warm magic and an abrupt throb of light out of his stag’s glow ran the last of the wraiths off into a grim ashen sky.
With a bit of direction, Draco spread his legs for Harry to wind his arms securely under them instead, and it was immediately a far better approach.
“Ah yes. He might’ve mentioned something about that… but Father’s wand aim has always been awful. Do you remember the way?”
Not that Draco allowed them to roam for long, catching hold at his wrists to press them into the mattress on either side of his head, muffling panted groans with domineeringly deeper kisses. Harry shifted restlessly under him, pushing up into the writhe of the pale hips sheathing him repeatedly in breathtaking tightness.
For one thing there was a mouldy-wood smell permeating the house which neither of them could manage to expel, no matter how many cleaning charms they used. There was also the bath tap that never entirely stopped dripping, and the rough stone walls of the cellar, which was always flooded after any extended bouts of rain.
They kissed minty and lingering, both moaning their impatience when Harry rubbed forward a little more firmly.
He wasn’t ready to return to the festivities, and he reasoned the chaise looked more comfortable than standing, even despite the added presence of a bothersome prat like Malfoy.
“School might be over, Harry, but we’re still in this together. If you need us, never think we’re too busy to help, alright?”
“Careful getting home, Potter,” he warned, already fading into the darkness. “It’s dangerous out here at night.”
“Potter…” Harry prepared himself to be rejected, but instead Draco caught him by the front of his shirt and pulled him roughly forward. “So long as you stop talking now, you can feel me anywhere you like.”
Harry nodded, and took in the scenery whilst he waited for him to finish with the warding. It was quite a pretty locale, though admittedly he was just pleased it looked exactly as described, and wasn’t a creepy graveyard. He appreciated the nature all around them, but there was only so much he could appreciate a mostly empty meadow—and thus he found himself watching Malfoy pace a relatively wide area, murmuring spells and protections, most of them very familiar, though it felt strange to see him doing them.
Harry was undoing his jeans again, and hurrying to catch up as he dragged his shirt up over his head.
Harry lined himself up. As he pressed in past the tip, he braced his palms on the desk, giving him the leverage needed to try driving in deeper.
It was reminiscent of the statues in the Chamber of Secrets and Harry eyed it a bit warily—but the overall ambiance of the place was rather impressive, he had to admit.
Draco moaned with him as Harry’s cock pulsed with potent ecstasy, and Harry came right where Draco asked him to, and rather a lot.
They lost the evenness of their rhythm to mounting lust. Harry knew by the strained stuttered pitch of his moan how close he was, thrusting faster through a volatile ache in his own prick to push him there.
On Wednesday he spent his entire day at his cubicle, revising essays for his classes. Which was when he discovered that the notes on Poisons and Antidotes Draco had written were pretty invaluable. They were clear and concise, illuminating a few sections of his essay where whatever Harry had written was completely wrong.
They’d reached the kitchen, and Draco stoked the fire at the end of the room with a quick spell, then much more leisurely summoned an assortment of ingredients and cooking paraphernalia from the kitchen shelves, charming them out onto one of several longer wooden prep tables.
He said it so dismissively—nevertheless Harry felt a stir of interest in his trousers that he couldn’t control. He wasn’t sure he believed Draco was being completely honest, but Harry wasn’t about to argue with a compliment like that either. In fact—
As his mind turned over that thought, something Sirius had once said reoccurred to him, and he experienced a moment of concern. “We aren’t actually related, are we?”
That broke all of Harry’s careful control, panting harder as he worked a quickening blur of thrusts and stroking. His lips only just brushed Draco’s ear when he whispered into it a single word.
Harry brushed his lips over the soft curve of Malfoy’s neck where his shirt collar pulled back enough to expose it. Malfoy answered him in quietly resonant moans, a sharp catch of his breath, and the insistent thrust of narrow hips.
Not having the words to express what he wanted, Harry rolled them over in the silky sheets covering Draco’s bed. There was a lot of room to roll, they could’ve done at least twice more without reaching the edge.
He quickly pulled his fingers free, leaving Draco gasping more as Harry whispered a spell to slick himself thoroughly. Then he was easing in past the head with several shaky breaths of his own. His cock was intensely tender, a touch angry at the overstimulation, but ached with the lust burning powerfully in him when he pushed through dangerously indecent tightness.
They were both moaning—tense with an all-consuming desire, and Draco kissed him back, nudging open Harry’s lips with his tongue and teasing into his mouth—a perfect distraction as Harry started fucking him very carefully—so as to stop himself from coming before they had even really started.
But a hand slipping into his pants left Harry unable to do much but rock himself into the touch, while Draco’s lips parted and their tongues tangled in some sort of battle for domination.
Harry’s world faded dark with rising ecstasy when Draco used his hold on the rail to bounce himself a bit on Harry’s cock.
“My family's reputation is completely disgraced. My father is in denial. Most everyone I thought to be a friend is long gone or dead, and I promise you, I feel very far from
Draco looked slightly shaken, but his hair was still pretty flawless which would seem to indicate he was probably just fine. On the outside, anyway.
This chapter is much longer, but it might be a bit till I can get another chapter out. Hopefully it's as entertaining for you to read as it was for me to write.
It was quite dark, but even without lighting his wand, Harry could never have mistaken that wry drawl for anyone else.
“No caffeine,” he promised, and hoped in the low light of the sitting room hearth she could not see him flushing.
Harry fought off a strong urge to kiss him then—but a quick glance at the tall clock behind the desk indicated he had already been there for significantly longer than he had intended to stay.
Once they made it to the ballroom they popped into the tent nearest the doors, incidentally one of Harry’s again, and Harry immediately collapsed on a pumpkin-coloured, over-cushioned settee, ideal for a nice lie-down.
All Aurors in training were required to have a more experienced field partner, and Harry had recently been assigned Rutley Savage, a gangly older fellow with dusty brown hair and a perpetually cheerful disposition.
The ballroom’s walls were somewhat curved and naturally it made sense to start off arranging them in a circle. But there wasn’t enough room in a single circle, so what they created was a sort of spiral toward the center of the room. Draco appeared to be using some of the starry mosaic on the floor to help guide his spacing. In the end it was quite close, but they all fit.
There was no denying Harry was interested given the faint twitch of his cock—although he had some concerns as to the wisdom of this endeavor, Draco did not appear to have any concerns. Summoning one of the armchairs closer to the center of the carpet, he brought it to a stop right in front of Harry.
section. Honestly, it’s almost a perfect fit, like it was meant to be there. We’ve got very specific clauses on what can and cannot be talked about, it should keep any secrecy complications to a minimum.”
He surveyed it more closely, now that his mind was focused on the task at hand, and not on Draco’s…everything.
Harry blinked at this revelation, along with the realisation that they could, theoretically, camp out in Draco’s ballroom all week, if they wanted.
“Did you do anything interesting for your birthday?” Draco questioned idly from where he lay sprawled just behind him.
“You can work with whomever you need to Harry, but breaking the Statutes could mean a lot of trouble if you’re caught. Please
Harry did not answer at first, underlining the bit about permanency before he glanced up from his notebook. The thought did cross his mind that Cassie and Hermione would likely get on quite well.
However there was one issue that needed immediate addressing before he could go any farther with his questions.
On Wednesday afternoon Harry was working through an essay for his Poisons and Antidotes class at his cubicle, when he felt a little delirious, and had to stop for a nap in one of the interview rooms—but even there he dreamed of dark things and dead faces and too much pain.
“Might as well,” Harry answered before he had finished, peering over Draco’s shoulder to examine the next location. His chest pressed to Draco’s shoulder—and Harry did his best to ignore the warmth of it. “Walking shouldn’t take more than ten minutes maybe, you want to?”
He spent Friday afternoon in Muggle London clearing Dementors, and that night suffered through a wickedly bad dream reliving the Battle of Hogwarts. The shock of it woke him far too early Saturday morning, and only made him more certain than ever that the wraiths were responsible for the ferocity of his nightmares.
“I’ll be down in just a bit to start on tea, yeah? You erm, probably have time for a bath, if you want.”
Harry moved to kneel behind him on the deep cushioned seat, and as Draco rocked back on the darkened shaft of Harry’s prick, Harry pushed in closer yet, rubbing harder against Draco’s arse, all rather slick from Harry’s tongue.
They were taking a break from casting, recovering some after the slight drain of expelling all that magic in such a short period of time. Draco drifted closer and leant tiredly against his back, the point of his chin resting on Harry’s shoulder rather familiarly.
Fighting his uncertainty, Harry shifted closer—only to have Malfoy immediately take his hand, and pull it to where he could feel a long length of hardness pressing against the front of Malfoy’s trousers. There was a fascinated hitch to Harry’s breathing as he gave into the urge to press down with his palm, and rub.
Speechless beyond the steady stream of swearing speeding through his head, he was fighting not to voice any of it aloud.
Harry had been waiting for a reason all day, and caught him by the cheek, hastily crushing their lips together.
It was eleven-thirty before he and Ginny managed to escape the revelry. A few of his friends even stayed behind to celebrate Harry’s birthday without him.
“Dementors tend to roam the city more at night, but it’s much easier to locate them in daylight, and they seem a little less inclined to put up a fight as well—but we’ll need to be as subtle as possible no matter what. If we
“If you’d like.” Draco’s smirk was small but wicked—just before Harry wiped it away with a penetrating kiss.
The considerable amount of power the protective enchantments required left them both a touch drained in the aftermath. Draco had looked more faint than usual just after his attempt, though he’d recovered some of his colour whilst walking Harry through the steps in turn.
Rising up on his knees, Harry licked his lips, and touched the very tip of his wand to the exposed pink pucker of Draco’s arse.
He knew they couldn’t stay there, of course they couldn’t, but Harry also didn’t know how he was meant to pretend everything was normal, when everything suddenly felt so very far from it.
“Found it in the back of the attic. I think it’s just an ordinary Muggle one—will it work for a tester?”
Harry hurried more than strictly necessary to step out of his trousers. He sat down naked on the end of the bed, and when Draco pushed him back flat he groaned for another reason entirely, wriggling up higher toward the center of the mattress.
Darting around to face the battered makeshift goals as Ron lined up to block them, Harry tried a few different feints, ones Ginny usually pulled successfully on him—but Ron managed to foil them all.
Harry’s noises turned relieved when Draco let up enough to let him get at the other man’s trousers in turn. A whispered charm undid the buttons, so that all Harry really needed to do was push them down past Draco’s hips.
Harry had given up taking notes, as Draco had been droning on for a bit too long at that point about the intricacies of magically measuring intent. As he paced in front of the desk, Harry slouched back on one of the longer settees—and though he didn’t intend to, broke into a large yawn.
Harry was trying not to gag or choke, but interested to see how far he could push it, if he could make Draco feel as good with his mouth as Draco’s mouth felt on him. But Harry also really wanted to fuck him, and his fingers traced up between Draco’s thighs to slide between his arsecheeks and rub at the soft pucker of his entrance.
Draco left his trousers and his pants on the sitting room floor and trapped Harry’s hips between his knees on the chair as Harry whispered charms to smooth the press his cock in as quickly as possible.
“Then stop staring at it,” Malfoy drawled at him. “Look up instead. You can see most of the constellations out here, perhaps you’ll learn something useful for once.”
Harry’s back garden butted up against several of his neighbours’ gardens, separated by a few overgrown lanes, barely wide enough for a single person to walk through. The garden itself was quite small, surrounded by a patchwork of odd fencing and lattice choices—with some areas over-fenced, and others with no fences at all. Harry hadn’t really understood what the previous owners were trying to accomplish, but it was one of many messes he hadn’t got around to sorting out yet.
Draco’s tone held an edge of tightly veiled anger—but then it wasn’t really Blaise he was angry with.
Harry nodded. “We’d be starting quite early, but you could stop by later, or whenever you’d like honestly, we’ll probably be at it most of the day.”
It was also the case that when Ginny left for this next series, it would be her last for the summer. The week Harry had taken off would be the last week he had the house, and time, to himself for several months.
“Can I make you come like this?” Persuasively, Harry teased his lips at Draco’s ear and crushed his hips forward to hit harder, forcing Draco’s cock more firmly to the mirror.
Some of the tents had finished setting up and he looked to Draco uncertainly, met with a steely resolution in the grey of his eyes.
When the last of their energy was spent, Harry was probably the second-stickiest he had ever been, and so exhausted he was completely fine with it. His limbs tangled with Draco’s, who was sprawling out on top of him to pass out, his face pushed close to Harry’s throat—and Harry was completely fine with that too.
“We’ve done nothing but drink and talk about depressing nonsense for an hour or more. What sort of party has long, mandatory stretches of boredom? Come on. Show me around all the places Father never let me explore.”
“It’s so late,” was all he could think to say, glancing up to the star-speckled breaks in the treetops above them.
"But I’m talking about practical solutions, it’s not as if their problems aren’t affecting us too. There’s Dementors all over London now, how long until they’re on the Ministry’s doorstep?"
For one thing, Harry had wanted to do most of the painting by hand—only now Draco had his hands all tied and bound above his head. He’d wrapped Harry’s wrists up in gold and scarlet stripes, pulled from Harry’s trunk, with a terribly wicked smirk.
He also spotted Teddy Lupin in an enchanted pram, rolling just ahead of his grandmother on the road heading back toward the castle. Seeing him brought on a painful mix of emotions as well, and Harry knew he probably should’ve stopped to say hello to them but—
Draco pushed himself upright even as Harry continued fucking him, arching back on him rather gracefully as their hips worked to keep Harry’s cock moving steadily in and out.
It was a relief to see him out and about again, even if it had to be at a formal event like this one.
Draco scoffed at his hopelessness. “Straight on past the atrium, three lefts and one right curve, you’ll be in the library wing.”
They cast in tandem another two hours, until Harry began to feel a bit woozy once again, and knew he couldn’t possibly push himself through another spell. Now it was his turn to cross the room and wait for Draco to finish the careful steps of the charm.
It had been somewhat of an adjustment coming to work in a place where he’d not only nearly been murdered, but also lost his godfather.  He continued to be struck surreally with an unnerving twist whenever he caught glimpses of the rooms and corridors missed in the Ministry’s hurry to renovate away some of its more reprehensible changes.
Harry found himself being propelled out of the main atrium toward the great golden gates of the Ministry’s lifts. He knew he ought to be objecting to this endeavor, but something kept his feet moving regardless.
He found it impossible to ignore now that his Patronus was a little less bright and a little more ethereal with each casting. His memories had not changed, and Harry felt as though he himself had not fundamentally changed, so he could not pin down what might be causing the disruption. He only knew if it continued he would need to look into it, and preferably before it began hindering his ability to do his job.
While Draco whispered a spell to prepare himself, the tip of Harry’s cock brushed between pale thighs, and then Harry slid himself up between Draco’s arsecheeks in a slow tease. When Draco tried pushing back on him properly, Harry rather enjoyed playing with him—after all of the teasing Draco had done the last time.
They’d been engaged and living together no longer than eight months, but with Ginny on the road so often, Harry mostly took on the burden of fixing up the place himself. He’d even started doing some of it the Muggle way, though as a result, the whole endeavour was taking much longer than he had originally intended.
“Harder,” Draco pleaded tightly, a loud moan stuttering in Harry’s rhythm when he enthusiastically complied.
He wasn’t around for Harry to thank him, but even if he were Draco wouldn’t’ve accepted his thanks anyway—not verbally, at any rate.
Every word Malfoy spoke was steeped in superiority, but Harry also thought perhaps Malfoy was more ‘intellectually invested’ than he was letting on. Or, Harry was succumbing to wishful thinking again—which he had been mentally begging himself to
The next morning when he stepped through the library fireplace, promptly at nine, Draco was standing just beside the hearth shelving a book above the mantle with the levitating point of his wand.
“That’s alright. If I don’t make it for lunch tell everyone I’ll see them tonight, after everything’s over and done with.”
He felt a faint tremble in Draco’s thighs when he stroked over them, and Draco rocked forward over the back of the chair with his own tense moan when Harry pressed in with his mouth—teasing his tongue all through the mess he’d made, only flicking lightly over the quivering place he’d just fucked so thoroughly, before delving his tongue deeper into rather salty heat.
It took a fair amount of Harry's self-control not to bother him for sex that evening. He certainly considered the idea, but he needed to give Draco the time to focus and fix the problem. Not to mention he really should’ve been practising, and he did that instead.
“…Yes well, they’re not the enforcement arm. It’s really Improper Use you’ll need to worry about. Their detection abilities are top-notch.”
Now Harry could put the proper force into pushing his cock in past taut muscle, sliding stiffly deeper. Driving in so gradually felt devastatingly good, and his cock twitched hard inside, drawing dulcetly low moans from them both.
However, mostly the week flew by so quickly that Harry hadn’t the time to angst about his poor choices.
Harry made the rounds with hugs and greetings, before slipping off to find Ron and Hermione—only to find Ron sitting at a corner table with George, going over a long sheet of words and numbers that made Harry’s head hurt to look at.
Draco moaned again incoherently, but was finally relaxing enough Harry could push himself in completely—a touch mind-blowing on a level it had never been before, even on the potion. This felt more intimate, somehow. Harry could see every flash of pleasure and abandon on Draco’s face, teasing his cock with slippery fingers as he got lost in the incredibly tight hold Draco’s arse had on him.
When he rubbed a bit harder, his fingertip popped past the tight ring. Draco wouldn’t stop kissing him long enough to let him whisper a lubrication charm, so Harry was very careful nudging his touch a little deeper, searching for a sweeter spot as narrow hips writhed down ever more frenetically on him.
He’d stayed in for at least an hour more, willing himself not to think of Draco, how he felt all around him, or any of the other vexingly persistent little details which might make it harder for him to get some much-needed sleep.
On Harry’s second casting, the teacup held up a smidge better than the paper bag had—but then it too cracked into pieces, after only a few seconds under the influence of the charm.
“No, I’ve brought it up because it’s completely unrelated,” Draco drawled sardonically, rather lazily unbuckling his belt, until Harry stopped him.
“I’m going to fuck you until you come so many times the bed will never be clean,” he murmured. It was very ambitious, but Harry would surely try.
When a searching hand slipped back to swat insistently at his hip, Harry quickly interpreted it as a request to fit warmly to Draco’s back, hooking an arm around his middle to pull him just a touch closer.
He was silent a long moment, considering Harry, the house, the garden, and the whole lot of it. “Is this
Nothing he’d said was entirely false, though Harry knew he was stretching the truth near to breaking now.
Draco had said please. Harry thrust as hard as he could, but he was already coming from the sinful noises out of Draco’s mouth. The pleasure was a touch excruciating, and Draco locked their lips roughly, muffling their cries as his climax followed only seconds later, both of them exacerbating the already sticky mess of fabric trapped between them.
Harry sighed exasperation, shutting down the strange twist catching in his chest that they might have an eventually anything.
They both summoned their clothes, cast a few cleaning charms, and dressed in relatively peaceful silence.
Somewhat over-eager again, when they swapped, Harry immediately sunk to his knees to suck Draco’s cock into his mouth with a low hum.
He had time to wonder at the surreality of the moment, sitting in the kitchen at Malfoy Manor discussing soup with Draco like it was the most normal thing in the world. Though at the moment, it did sort of feel like the most normal thing in the world—there was no hint of awkwardness, and as their peaceful moments in the chair had been, it was very nice—which really only added to the surreality of it all.
“I haven’t found a single spell that might deter magic users, let alone one with specific clauses on who to deter. It would take only one to report us, and the Ministry, the ICW, they could come down on the whole thing and bollocks the entire plan.”
But perhaps Draco was just tired. Harry certainly was, the exhaustion only weighing on him more as the day wore on.
Draco nipped at his cheek, where the faint line of a still-healing curse cut across Harry’s cheekbone.
As his thoughts drifted it crossed his mind to wonder at how they had ended up here, and where they stood—but he was too tired to examine anything now. Draco’s firm weight and the steady warmth of his breathing lulled Harry inevitably toward the pull of a true dreamless sleep.
Standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder, they both took in the few shelves of prophecies before them, only a small half-circle now, and far shorter than they had once been. Harry didn’t bother to scan the shelves, or read the labels—in the back of his mind, he knew whatever he might’ve been looking for was no longer there.
They considered a few solutions between them, but in the end went with Draco’s proposal of tying each one to an individual passive glow charm on an enchanted pull-cord.
“Luna heard it from Mandy Brocklehurst, I think. See, I gossiped—before the war turned everything death and doom all the time.”
As she picked up one of the larger volumes from an off-kilter pile of them, Harry’s stomach did an uneasy flip. Probably there was no real reason for him to hide what he was researching from her, but his nerves seemed to think otherwise.
After the pandemonium of the last few months, Harry was ready for some time off, and decided on the last week of May.
He forgot completely about closing the back door when Draco used the table as leverage to wrap his thighs around Harry’s hips. Harry caught him by the arse and all but carried him up the stairs.
Draco drew in a short anticipant breath as Harry tossed the spoon aside, not caring where it landed, too busy surging down to suck the honey off of Draco’s nipples, which he had been certain to cover especially well.
“Yes Potter, the curtains are fucking essential. Stop pulling faces, it shouldn’t be overly demanding in terms of power. If we review a few standard transfigurations ahead of time, accounting for some variation in style, then we only need alter the colours—and that’s easy enough.”
When Harry’s burning cheek finally landed hotly on Draco’s chest, he felt completely spent, and dangerously euphoric.
“You’ve just watched me make it. It’s primarily wine and cherries—though I’ve had to alter the recipe some. As written, it has a tendency to come out far too bitter.”
Draco seemed to catch on then, and also sent Harry an assessing look. “Were you offering to help me get off?”
He found the right spot, and did not let up, rocking down harder, then abruptly pumped his hips in quick short slams until Draco’s cock shot between them in pulsing spurts.
I was going to wait and save this chapter to release with the next one but I'm happy with how it came out so I'm just going for it. Enjoy!
“Seems harmless enough. ‘Certainly cares about her work… hard to argue she’d have any motivation not to help.” Draco sighed. “But it’s hardly a sure thing, is it?”
Draco made a complaining noise, then let slip a small sleepy hum, apparently not yet ready to open his eyes, in the same way Harry was not yet ready to stop touching his hair now that he’d started.
The first hour or so, they spent their time going over the theory behind Draco’s new spellwork, and there was a peculiar awkwardness between them that Harry didn’t understand—but the nervous tension was turning his stomach inside out.
Harry groaned, thrusting up all the harder as Draco’s cursing intensified. The throbbing hold on his cock squeezed tighter as he found Draco’s sweet spot again, and again, and they each flew closer to the edge of relief.
When Harry opened his eyes to the Sunday morning sun streaming in through his bedroom window it took a few yawned seconds for him to register the warm body he was spooned up behind was naked and, more importantly, Draco. The hint of spiced coconut was his first clue, and the brilliant white-blond gleaming in the sunlight was another.
“The fire here is connected to the Floo network,” Draco nodded across the library to the large hearth inset into the dark shelves as he fastened the buttons at his wrists. “We can leave whenever you’re ready.”
They hadn’t gone very far, and Harry was just pondering how to word his question about the weird magic something that’d just happened, when the snappy sound of Draco’s footsteps abruptly halted.
Harry’s only answer was another low moan, and then he was rolling them over once more, if only to properly press his still straining cock against Draco’s and rub down
“Well, I—before I knew who I was really, at my aunt’s—for the longest time my entire world was a dusty little cupboard.” It hardly compared to some of the hardships Cassie talked about, but that didn’t make it any easier for him to admit this, especially to Malfoy.
“Or,” he offered, with a flippancy far too dangerously smooth. “I could always more thoroughly demonstrate my gratitude later tonight.”
“Well, I lived the better part of a year in one of those tents and was perfectly fine—aside from the twats trying to kill me part, of course.”
Groaning quietly, Malfoy hurried his buttons open, in a rush he had not been in when he'd undone Harry’s.
Either some of Draco’s tension eased then, or he’d hidden it very well in the slow arch of an eyebrow. Harry was guessing the latter.
Harry thanked the woman, following her instructions and passing through the large front room into the back half of the building, down a tile-covered corridor with fluorescent lighting that reflected off the shine of the floors. Many of the rooms he passed looked quite small, though he did pass a set of open double doors, behind which he could see a much larger room, lined with windows. It reminded him some of a common room, what with all the tables, chairs and sofas dotted about.
“It’s a matter of time, Potter. As in, the time it would take for me to create an altered jinx that functions properly. It appears possible on parchment, and I have nothing but time. It’s an intriguing challenge.”
“…Pretty sure,” Harry lied, and hitched a gasp when Draco started biting repeatedly just beneath his ear—sharp enough to be punishment, only it felt so perfectly incredible that it was really a reward.
Without his glasses, Draco was fuzzily outlined in a dim halo of light emanating from the ballroom’s chandeliers, spilling in through the un-curtained bedroom window. It was remarkably enchanting, even if Harry was struggling to interpret a rather enigmatic smirk.
“By the way,” he added quickly. “I wanted to say, I do honestly appreciate your helping with this. I know I’ve said it before, but I never expected—”
“Hm,” Draco hummed, pushing his hair back from his face with a deep sort of sigh that Harry had never heard from him before. “Fucking fantastic actually thanks for asking.”
“They’re really Father’s peacocks…they’ve been quite despondent since he’s gone to France, but I’ve been trying to cheer them up.”
Harry was rather distracted watching the process, and Draco snuck in behind him to nip into the curve of his shoulder. He started, fighting off a shiver.
“I’ll make a deal with you, Potter. I will deign to give your futile little pet project some of my very valuable time and attention, and in return…”
“Thanks for the daring rescue, Potter. Now we’re even,” Draco drawled with hoarse amusement, rising to his feet and stepping closer for too-clever fingers to work his cock gently back into his pants, doing up his trousers, belt and all by hand.
,” Harry moaned, Draco clenching tight all around him driving Harry to coming in hard, throbbing pulses.
He whispered a spell to undo the buttons, and took his time sliding in his hand to squeeze at Draco’s cock. Draco tipped his head back onto Harry’s shoulder with a hitched sigh.
Harry was a bit shocked at the idea, but his cock was quite interested—or tried to be. “No, I—yeah. It’s the last door there.”
Pale fingers brushed lightly over sensitive skin, and Harry hissed a breath, but then he was smirking a bit proudly.
Harry coughed a quiet laugh. Draco could be incredibly dedicated to whatever he was working on, assuming you could get him invested in the first place. It was curiously endearing.
Being this close, all sorts of things might’ve set off their hormones, but instead they only stood together for several silently serene seconds.
He’d always been particularly competitive in matters involving Harry, and suddenly the sharpness of his annoyance made a lot more sense. Only now Harry had to think of something to say that wasn’t going to make matters worse.
Lawrence sounded a bit unnerved to be speaking with him, but Harry was used to that reaction from people anymore, especially lately. He knew for many he would probably always be a reminder to them of darker times.
“In my case I think it may well be a lost cause. Anyway, it doesn’t really matter most of the time, it’s just a bit annoying.”
Harry smirked a little awkwardly sliding them back on, and Draco scoffed a pretentious sort of laugh, flicking at his lightning scar before he was slipping out the bathroom doorway.
He thrust forward in a hard snap, and Draco whimpered at the impact with the stinging skin of his arse.
Draco gasped relief when Harry carefully pulled the wand free of him, still humming and slightly slick.
“If, by some fucking miracle, we make it through the rest of this weekend without reverting back to totally hating each other, then I might reconsider accepting the favour. Eventually.”
Harry was absolutely not allowing himself to be miffed that the letter had been so curt. Although in retrospect, he wasn’t sure what he might’ve expected Malfoy to have written instead.
A few charms and some dropped pants later and Harry was inside him, and it was fucking wonderful. Draco planted his feet at the bottom of the stairs and held tight to the banister and Harry fucked him quite hard, until he was bent over, palms-flat on the attic’s wooden steps.
“Ah, sorry. You read about famous people, of course…never really expect them to be sat in your office attempting to solve all your problems, do you?”
For most of the evening his guilt had been hitting far more intensely than before, in sudden stomach-churning waves whenever he recalled how thoroughly he was lying to them all.
And it had all blurred by so quickly—his episodes of intimacy with Draco had happened so fast and frequently for the last several weeks that Harry hadn’t had time to consider what would happen when it stopped. He’d been running all on impulse, if only to avoid thinking about absolutely any of the potential consequences.
“I’ll message you on the board Tuesday night to work out a plan. Let me know once you’re certain you’ve got the time off,” he instructed tersely.
But Draco was more focused on the collection of plastic junk now cluttering his otherwise neat antique desk. “Potter…what is
” he expelled. Draco was intoxicating, and Harry was coming before he’d got more than half of himself where it was meant to be.
He couldn’t deny his cock’s desire to be where his fingers were, but Draco looked too much on display for Harry not to take advantage. This was Draco Malfoy, naked and hard and spread out in the middle of what had surely once been his father’s desk, for Harry, apparently.
Harry snorted. “Not that I believe you really care, but he’s fine. What, no more witty insulting nicknames?”
That would explain her reaction, only now Harry felt quite awkward standing there, considering the questions he would need to ask her. How was he meant to excuse what he was doing there now?
He wasn’t too concerned about it, given the nature of being Harry Potter his house was pretty well warded—however it was a reminder why they had gone out there in the first place. Before he started the tea Harry popped quickly out to the garden to gather some mint and finally closed the door behind him. He located his wand where he’d left it by his chair in the sitting room, and began charming together a small tray with a kettle of tea, two cups and, as an afterthought, he summoned a jar of honey out of the cupboard.
Draco seemed to realise he might’ve said more than he intended—though it did not take him long to recover, and he was excellent at distracting Harry. Sliding up to him so smoothly it was frustratingly seductive, he left a step or so of space between them, but reached out to trail his fingers barely touching down Harry’s chest to rest at the button of his jeans.
He never got around to talking with her about Draco either. When he’d come down for tea, they’d chatted for an hour about the new Weird Sisters album.
It was dangerously tempting to thrust right back in—and Harry was decidedly dazed moving to kneel on the hard cool marble instead.
He had no idea if Draco cared at all about the end result of their efforts, but Harry still very much did, and wasn’t going to give up on the idea now.
Everything Draco said sounded perfectly practical, and Harry couldn’t think of a reason why this wasn’t as good a first step as anything he’d considered. Although—
Harry glanced down just in time to watch shots of white seed throb from the tip of Malfoy’s cock to coat his fingers in sticky heat. Malfoy was still shuddering faintly with residual tension, and it was only very gently that he released his grip. Hearing him whimper that way was almost worth the whole ordeal.
“Prat.” Harry was buttoning his shirt, already heading toward the bedroom door—but he hesitated. “Talk to you later?”
“You’re not inspecting anything, we’re sitting down. My head’s about to go completely sideways, and you’ve just almost fallen over.”
“Right, thank you. We’re very excited.” A slight exaggeration, nervous being the more overwhelming feeling when Harry spent any prolonged period of time thinking about his impending marriage.
Trying to imagine what Draco being this tight might feel like on his cock was too much for him to take, so Harry focused on watching him for now, a light sheen of sweat forming as Draco began flushing faintly pink all over, rocking into Harry’s probing touch.
He was too busy shielding his eyes from a particularly bright pendulum, hyper-reflecting the bell jar’s light directly into his eyes, to notice that Malfoy had stopped—until he walked right into him, and immediately received a sharp elbow to the stomach.
It took Harry far too long to remember what he was meant to be telling him, let alone what his idea had been in the first place.
Eventually Draco summoned the energy to pull away from him, and lead their way back down to the kitchen. On the way, they were both rather determined to ignore the element of nervous energy edging between them as they walked.
“When we get back I’m returning the favour. You don’t need to repay me in sex—or anything else actually.”
More than once, he’d sat down with a scroll of parchment and his quill, with every intention of sending Malfoy a strongly worded owl to rid himself of the conflict. His first attempt turned into a long diatribe reaffirming his commitment to Ginny, which he’d immediately binned and started again. Another devolved into a lecture on the importance of the rule of law, and Harry had binned that as well, as it might be hypocritical to lecture Malfoy about following the law whilst also playing with the idea of breaking it. The last had gone so embarrassingly soppy and nostalgic that Harry had disposed of it with a rather overenthusiastic
Then his fingers were threading through the soft damp strands of Draco’s hair and they were kissing. Draco’s lips tasted of coffee and rain, and Harry spent a moment exploring them quite thoroughly. When he caught hold of Draco’s arse and pulled them flush together, Draco moaned.
Only later that afternoon did it dawn on him there wasn’t really anything in Malfoy’s letter he would’ve needed to hide from her in the first place. Yet the instinct to do so had been overwhelming, and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to bring any of it up in conversation later either. For now, he felt far more comfortable keeping the whole thing to himself.
Cassie was nodding but she looked a bit worried. Which might’ve had something to do with the way Draco’s eyes narrowed dangerously as he emphasised the precarious nature of the situation.
It took Draco the better part of a half hour to finish it, and he looked unusually uncertain when he finally lowered his wand.
“Probably not,” he agreed shrugging. “Thanks for letting me stay over. No—I know, don’t mention it—but I am mentioning it. Thank you. Shut up and accept it.”
Logically Harry ought to have taken him back to the bedroom, but he didn’t. He led Draco out the front of the tent instead, wandlessly summoning the same stylish modern dining chair they’d just been snogging in out to the ballroom.
They were moaning in tandem when Harry brushed swollen-sore lips between Draco’s shoulders, and bit down hard as he pushed his cock in far beyond where his tongue could go. Draco drew out another low moan, and it was intoxicatingly erotic.
As they moved into the new year, frustration had become Harry’s primary emotion, and more than once he found himself snapping at anyone who crossed him at the wrong moment. Only Ginny was really spared his temper, and only to do with his being so afraid to give her any hint that anything was wrong in the first place.
Rather than wait for Harry’s answer he pressed into another kiss, sharing the smooth burn from the tip of his tongue, which Harry sucked at, kissing him still a while longer. He gave Draco’s trouser-clad arse a sharp smack, and Draco rewarded him with a rougher friction, humming a low moan, and nipping at his lips with provocative promise.
He only needed to give him a bit of lift and Gordon took off at top speed, out through the corridor’s open window into a greyish morning sky.
He needed to find a wand, but was having no luck finding his own. He found Draco’s in his trousers on the floor, and it worked fine for a quick and mostly-effective spell, which he cast over Draco’s sleeping form as well. Draco was typically pretty quick with the cleansing charms, but what with being fucked into forgetting his own name it was no surprise he forgot the charms too.
He struggled a bit to swallow when Draco was as deep into his throat as he was, but Harry got the hang of it after a moment, and it was worth the trouble for the way Draco groaned at him, rocking his cock into Harry’s mouth, and pulling out almost reluctantly—though his fingers remained tangled deep in a dark mess of hair.
Harry eased in just the tip. Draco moaned, and Harry’s cock throbbed watching the first inch of his wand slip in. He waited for the encouraging rock of Draco’s hips before he went in any deeper.
“Only the ones with very fit arses and exquisite cocks,” Draco taunted, skirting around Harry to the ballroom doors, leading their way down to the manor’s kitchen.
With his doubts still warring his desires over Draco, their hard work finally gaining ground, and Quidditch Season just on the horizon, how long can Harry's better judgement hold out?
Malfoy had quickly taken a step back, and seemed to be very absorbed in staring at the bubbling liquid in his glass, and anywhere else that wasn’t at the two of them. Harry felt a pang of sympathy he didn’t fully understand.
Harry went a bit flushed as he hurried to try doing up his trousers by hand and simultaneously scramble to his feet. It wasn’t going well. He tried to ignore the way Malfoy was watching him—only for him to offer Harry a hand.
Harry was a bit anxious to move on as well, not to mention he was ready for lunch, but he also hadn’t wanted to be rude.
He hadn’t cast it all together yet, and Draco was working diligently to add on even more, but Harry kept going over what he did know of the spell’s casting complexity, drilling it into his head so many times he didn’t think he could possibly forget any of it now. He hoped not, in any case.
They parted for him, a spark of amusement dancing in Harry’s eyes, Draco pushed in abruptly and Harry moaned around him, taking him receptively deeper.
When he returned home again, Harry stored his broom and took a short shower before he was flopping down into bed to prod at the blackboard with his wand.
Before they left the tent behind, Draco verified the bathroom, kitchen, and the sitting room were all as clean as the bedroom, as if they’d never been there at all, and they headed out together to finally get on with casting the extensions again.
Harry bit him until his teeth left marks behind, and proceeded then to fuck him, right there in the kitchen.
“—but as you’re obviously completely hopeless on these subjects, I suppose I could continue to offer my advice. I’m somewhat intellectually invested now…I might as well see what comes of it.”
They Transfigured from four-thirty until nearly seven, and by the time he was finished with his last Harry was quite tired of curtains.
Draco made a long moaned noise then that Harry never heard before—it was visceral and uninhibited and painfully fucking hot.
After levitating a fair bit of the furniture out of the middle of the room first, Draco charmed the tent to set up right in the middle of the library. When it was fully erected, he wasted no time adjusting his stance and starting to cast the elaborate chain of enchantments, linked together through the whirls of his wand tip and the complex strings of Latin he murmured to make it all fit into one spell.
“Is this any better?” He felt awkward as all hell, but Harry was trying not to make a mess, or Merlin forbid slurp.
“I only think it's a foolish, bleeding-heart notion that even Granger would tell you is too ambitious. You know the Ministry can barely deal with its own, let alone… how many hundreds more? That’s ridiculous."
“I imagine he does—which I might add, will have no effect on whether or not I decide to do so. I was raised to respect my father…I’ve learned not to trust his judgement. His plans for my future very nearly got us all killed.”
“I’m sorry about this, but first I’ll need to ask you not to say anything to anyone about my being here. Not even your sister.”
Once he’d wiped his mouth a bit, he waited for Draco to find the focus to look down again, before he jumped right into taunting him.
As the day approached, he found himself increasingly wracked with annoying bouts of nerves and concerns over his own abilities to show restraint. On the other hand, it would also be a perfect opportunity to dig into his spells practice—with so much free time in the evenings after work, he was sure to get a lot more accomplished.
Locking their eyes in heated tension, Draco’s voice cut off as he came, hard and hot and mostly all on Harry.
He caught hold under each of Draco’s thighs, holding him steady for Harry to fuck him harder, fighting on a razor’s edge of control as he sped his thrusts. Draco slipped his hand between them to tug at his cock as Harry drove into him faster.
The stony stairs spiralled up, opening to a larger arched corridor, lined with wooden beams and a number of remarkably violent magical tapestries.
“I’m not saying no or anything, but I’ve got to be honest with you, I might be too tired for thrusting.”
Draco’s hand drifted from Harry’s hand to his wrist—but then he flattened his palm to Harry’s cheek, and they were kissing, and Harry went all lightheaded.
Clearing his throat and sipping his tea, Draco recovered with predictable grace, but Harry could see his ears clear as day in the afternoon sun.
“Er, yes? Or, I mean—no?” Harry wasn’t sure what the correct answer was, but then it didn’t actually seem to matter.
It was too vivid and purposeful for a normal dream, but Harry felt none of the telling burn in his old scar that might indicate this had anything to do with Voldemort. In fact, he felt perfectly fine, despite having slept so fitfully.
“If I pretended to agree would you cease endlessly badgering me with your ridiculous attacks of conscience?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Harry muttered under his breath, muffled by the hand he rubbed tiredly over his face.
Draco clearly wasn’t shit at folding charms. As Harry wrote out his letter, he couldn’t help sneaking glances to watch him properly spell everything clean in two quick laundering charms, and enchant it all into two small, neatly folded piles on the sitting room table. He even charmed Harry’s into his bag, to join the jumble of wrinkled shirts, denims and pants Harry had packed for his stay.
“Welcome to the Malfoy Family Library, Potter,” Draco drawled in a bored sort of fashion, waving his hand vaguely at the room as they entered, all sides of which were lined with dark oak shelves nearly overflowing with books.
He waited about a minute, but when Draco didn’t answer he went back to reading. It was another ten before he received a reply.
The weekend before, Hermione had Floo-called to plan a night to catch up—and they had both discovered they worked nearly opposing schedules these days. Combining in the need to include Ron, who was at the shop more nights and weekends than not—it became clear fairly soon that it might be a while until they could find a time to meet when they were all free.
Harry read for a while longer while they waited on the tea, and Draco charmed a scattered jumble of many notes into a more manageable pile of neatly rolled scrolls.
“That can’t be healthy,” Draco drawled at him with an arched eyebrow, which took Harry a moment to recognise as concern.
“I’ve got a lot more relevant books back at the library but it’s not exactly practical to cart them all off to you. I need them as well. Perhaps one of these days you might pop in to look through them.”
Harry shuddered and Draco murmured a spell, undoing every button on them all at once. He worked Harry’s trousers down a bit, but only just enough for his fingertips to trace the line of Harry’s hips.
Draco’s touch traced taunting down his chest, stroking over his abs, dragging through smears of honey and lower, following a narrow trail of hair to rub into the dark mess of Harry’s curls and circle at the base of his cock, squeezing tightly.
“Er, hello—perhaps you could help me—I’m looking for someone who might be able to answer some questions about the people that you service here, what they might need—that sort of thing.”
Draco hummed a flippant agreement and took the glass back from him, presumably lost in his thoughts, which, after a careful swallow, he proceeded to share.
“...Good.” Malfoy sounded a touch distracted himself now, rolling up his sleeves and pausing a moment to eye Harry a bit expectantly.
Malfoy’s laugh was lower and throatier than Harry rightly remembered. He couldn’t tell if the potion was playing with his perception, or if Malfoy’s voice had always sounded so much like sex to him.
“You could always sneak in another time,” he teased a bit, now trying to decide which door would be a better choice.
It was about quarter-till-one in the morning when Harry realised how very easy it would be to see him. He also recalled how direct Draco had been about coming to see Harry on his birthday—as if Harry were the only gift he had wanted.
“That really ought to be locked,” Malfoy drawled. “Anyone could just stroll in here and destroy it all with a poorly aimed spell.”
Shuddering bodily against him, Draco sounded so much hoarser than he had a moment ago. “That’s playing
Even with several days off he was struggling to sleep, and spent probably too much of the time in his chair by the fireplace, or up in the attic practicing spells—among other things.
He was meeting Ron and Hermione at their flat that night, and with Ginny still out of town it would be only the three of them. Inevitably as the evening approached his mind raced with thoughts about what all they might be wanting to discuss, and in particular if it had anything to do with the fact he had been collaborating with Draco Malfoy.
“It’s going alright, all things considered. D’you mind if I close the door? For the magic, you know.”
“Shut up,” Draco muttered, nipping at his lower lip with the same gentle sharpness he’d used on his balls. “I know.”
He caught Harry’s tangled hair in a tight grip, and Harry gladly gave over control—even when Draco pressed in deeper than he thought he could take and he choked a little. His cock ached sympathetically, all his remaining focus on controlling the sharp edge of his teeth, and fitting his lips sorely around Draco’s thrusting prick.
“I’ve cast my fair share of wards—yeah, I know, this is highly specialised. I’ve also been practising your ridiculously long amendments for weeks. I’m as ready as I’m going to be.”
Draco sat up then, shifting closer to nip sharply at the ball of Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t be a prick, Potter.”
Harry shook his head. "I’m sorry Malfoy, I can’t agree with that. People are meant to help each other—it’s how we survive.”
As he worked his ring finger in to join the other two, Harry nudged the sticky tip of his cock over the flush of one arsecheek with pointed promise. Draco writhed for him, gasping when Harry started rubbing with all three fingers over the oversensitive centre of nerves inside him.
Half-lidded green eyes swept over Draco’s face as he rocked for the right angle to force Harry in deeper, searching for his own pleasure as well. Draco looked profoundly debauched, and very striking.
“Right,” Harry agreed quickly, tucking it into his pocket and already trying to slip past the jittery wizard, and continue on his way to Hagrid’s. “I’ll be in touch.”
On Friday Harry was forced to heal what remained of Draco’s bitemarks still visible on his neck. He left only a pair of them behind, just above his collarbone where his shirt kept them well hidden. What would be the point in wasting time on unnecessary spells?
In Harry’s wandlight Malfoy’s expression could only be called pure curiosity. It wasn’t a side of him Harry recalled ever seeing before, but he couldn’t shake the feeling their plan was rather unwise. He was not an Unspeakable, and he did not have a good excuse prepared should anyone ask what he was doing wandering drunk through some of the Ministry’s most closely guarded secrets with Draco Malfoy.
The rest of their lunch went relatively without incident. Draco corrected a few minor etiquette violations but didn’t pick apart every move he made as Harry’d feared he might.
“Ran into Malfoy,” he muttered in reply, focused now on getting his feet to go one after the other, as they were meant to.
He hurried to get his mouth over Draco’s cock before he made any more of a mess, but mostly so he could taste him properly—as Draco tasted him that night in the Hall of Prophecy. Harry had dreamt about it of course, but the salt and bitter on his tongue hadn’t been a part of the dream at all.
The boys discuss some important things, avoid a few others, and spend most of the day disinclined to get out of bed.
Ron wandered their way then, tossing another arm about Harry’s shoulders. Thankfully he kept most of his weight to himself this time.
“That’s the idea, yes.” Draco extracted the blackboard’s twin from the same drawer, and tapped with his wand, charming words from its tip in neat chalky cursive.
easy—the particularly perfect way their legs tangled, and the decidedly mind-blowing explosion of sensations when Malfoy arched up against him, wriggling and pressing until Harry was afraid to move for fear of actually moaning.
“I won’t wear a tie,” Harry insisted immediately. “I haven’t since school, I’m not starting again now.”
Not that he had to do much pulling, Draco kept up just fine. He had always been pretty good at running away. Having slightly longer legs, he nearly outpaced Harry, but after nearly a year of field training Harry knew these backstreets, so well he didn’t have to second guess where he was taking them, stumbling to a stop in a deserted intersection of narrow lanes.
They went on challenging each other for more than an hour, and at some point Harry lost track of the time.
He also thought of the last and only time he had set foot in Malfoy Manor. Did he really want to go back there?
Harry managed what he hoped was an encouraging smile, and was relieved to see her smile back at him easily—she had been very excited lately, almost giddy, for Quidditch season to begin.
Out from under the tree’s cover it was raining a bit harder than he’d thought, but luckily it really wasn’t that far a distance. Safely beneath the restaurant’s black awning, he discovered they’d only got damp enough to make Draco annoyingly just a touch more attractive than usual. Rather than go on staring stupidly at him, Harry made an effort to take in the place he’d chosen instead.
As February changed over into March and Harry plodded along into spring, he spent any spare time he could find perusing the books Malfoy had lent him. He spent so much time flipping through them in the evenings, he supposed it wasn’t a terrible shock that Ginny eventually noticed them, being spread over the sitting room table they were all but impossible to miss.
“I’ll prepare an outline for the composition of the spells and the wards. I think we should go over everything from the start again before we set in to casting them all.”
On Tuesday night after work Harry’s curiosity and impatience combined to get the better of him. He laid the Protean blackboard on the sitting room table and touched his wand tip to its surface, sending through a message.
Ginny would be leaving for Dorset to play the Wasps on Tuesday, and be gone until the following Sunday.
And Draco somehow managed to turn Harry on just lithely standing to offer him a hand up. Probably it had something to do with the crotch of Draco’s trousers being right in front of his face just then, and his throat being still slightly raw from Draco’s cock fucking it.
Draco had taken on an almost deadened level of emotion that Harry found somewhat distressing, though apparently not distressing enough to change the subject.
In the residual heat, Harry noticed Draco trembling slightly and realised he was trying to keep them falling forward and unbalancing the chair.
Ultimately though, there was one argument that tended to sway him in the direction of going forward with the whole endeavour. When his father was not so much younger than Harry was now, he and all the Marauders had gone out of their way to break Wizarding law in becoming unregistered Animagi, and why? To help their friend, and because it had been the right thing to do.
He led Harry out into the corridor, and down into a narrower side hall, which curved around into another larger corridor.
It didn’t look as if Draco believed him; he also seemed to find the concept rather amusing, what with the hiccup of laughter. “Sorry, that’s very hard to picture.”
Harry shut the window against the frosty January chill invading the house and grabbed himself a jumper from the hall cupboard. With some effort, he managed to regain his calm as he took the short roll of parchment with him to the kitchen. He would need tea for this.
“—no, I completely understand, it’s alright! I’m busy too, and I don’t expect you both to help me with everything I ever work on for the rest of our lives. Malfoy says he has the time to spare; I guess I’ll just need you both to trust me on this… and keep the whole bit about breaking the Secrecy Statutes to yourselves, you know. I’ve got good reasons, I promise.”
Draco hummed throatily back. “Let’s shower. If we’re very quick, you can fuck me before we get back to work and I’ll do it again.”
He was genuinely hurt at the rejection, but there was a lot of residual anger thrumming through him. He shoved back, harder than necessary—and Draco furiously closed the distance between them anyway, gripped into Harry’s hair, and pulled until he was hissing pain.
Harry glanced down as if he’d only just noticed, even if he hadn’t actually, and shrugged. Draco immediately pushed him down into absurdly soft sheets, and proceeded to taunt and tease Harry’s cock with his tongue, until Harry could not stop himself erupting all over it.
It was also clear to Harry that Draco was really enjoying mercilessly torturing himself on Harry’s cock—in that he would seem to find just the right spot, press Harry in hard, and rock with his hips until Harry could feel him tensing all over.
It was an odd moment, a backwards mirror to a life not so far behind them, just for a moment, before Harry accepted the help.
“By the way, how did you end up getting the Taboo to do what we needed?” he queried, as Draco was just finishing with that layer of the spells.
“He means to say, we could use your help with a strategy we’re working on for the, er, case. I know you offered to help last time but... well we would still need to require absolute secrecy. It’s very important, there could be some very serious legal ramifications if anyone finds out the nature of what we’re working on. But if you’re alright with that...”
In the tent’s dim bedroom, the world narrowed for a time, both men rather lost in their fleeting closeness.
He gathered up the few things he needed to take home, and as an afterthought, cancelled his last spell on the tent, lest anyone be subjected to the mixing of tartan and paisley again.
Harry grinned at him the entire time they spent looking for a hidden-enough place to Disapparate, while Draco finished Harry’s coffee, and refused to make eye-contact the entire time.
“I suppose I’ll take that as a compliment,” Draco drawled— and sunk down to straddle Harry’s lap where he kneeled on the floor.
He held out for as long as he could—really only a few minutes—before Draco was pumping his orgasm out of him in faster strokes, while Harry panted and gripped at Draco’s arse through his trousers.
Harry was as reluctant to disentangle from the play of their mouths as he was to disrupt the lust-charged quiet simmering between them, diluted only by slick sounds, heavy gasps and the increasing intensity of Draco’s low moans as he sped to lightly ride Harry’s fingers.
“I’ve just got back—Renna says hello, by the way—I’m sorry I’m so late but I hadn’t seen her since the wedding and we had so much catching up to do! We had some lovely wine, and she was telling me all about their honeymoon. Paris, Harry! Can you imagine?”
“If she gets any smarter, the Unspeakables are going to haul her off to study her brain,” Ron bemoaned.
Harry nearly lost focus mid-spell when he swung open the tall doors, allowing the orange glow of late afternoon to bounce off the room’s many mirrors, painting their multitude of tents in warm light.
But Harry didn’t think Ron would ever agree to be involved in a talk about how Harry wasn’t marrying his sister fast enough. It had taken him long enough to get used to them living together in the first place.
He could hardly sleep at all, and when he did it was almost always the nightmares. A few times he thought he’d dreamed of Draco, but it was so shadowy in his memory it was impossible to tell if he wasn’t only remembering a different dream. Lately he was grateful for the dreams about Draco he did remember, for the break of them, even if it never lasted and the nightmares always came back.
Harry layered on his lack of enthusiasm, but on consideration, if Draco was willing to teach him how to avoid embarrassing himself, maybe they were lessons worth learning. He thought all the pretence horribly tedious, but what with the eyes of most of Wizarding society tending to be on him at all times, it was hard to argue it wouldn’t be a useful skill to have.
Harry mounted and kicked off from the ground hard. The rush of air and the joyous swoop in his stomach was as exhilarating as it ever was.
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco responded with a rather snide scoff. “Are you taking this seriously or not?”
“Spread your legs a bit more,” Harry suggested, helping guide Draco’s arse to rock more fully down onto his cock.
“Got it,” Harry affirmed, scanning over the neat list on parchment. “Why are the illusions split up? We can’t do them together?”
“Oh, you misunderstand me, Mr. Potter! That is, we were hoping you might be willing to give us your permission to make
“—though it appears you could stand to take a short break. How about I get started inspecting what you’ve just done, then you could join me after.”
“Well, that’s unfortunate,” Malfoy drawled, sounding more pleased than disappointed that he hadn’t got it on the first try. “My turn.”
“Not a chance. I imagine the both of us would be long dead by now, with a slim chance there would even be enough of polite society left to put on a wedding at all.”
He guided Draco down a long hall toward one of several small rooms with chairs and tables that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had at their disposal. They were used mostly for questioning, witnesses and suspects alike. It only occurred to Harry as they walked in that Draco might well have been in one of them before—at least once.
Harry quickly realised he needed to hold on to something that wasn’t likely to break or drive him mad, and ignored the warning look Malfoy shot him when he laced his fingers through pale strands of hair, as soft as they had always looked to be.
He had a lot to prepare for, the magic required for the work they were about to take on would be no small feat. The casting time alone was excessive, but Draco seemed to think they were ready, and Harry was looking forward to showing him exactly how well he had mastered his spell.
Harry let out a hoarse sort of hum, not bothering with spells or patience in hurrying Draco’s shirt over his head, and his own shortly after. Draco pressed to him straight away, wrapping his arms around summer-freckled shoulders, narrow hips rocking forward against Harry’s.
As he swallowed down the syrupy potion, he heard Malfoy scoff quietly—as if he hadn’t really believed Harry would try it. But now Harry could only await the effects of whatever it was he’d just agreed to take.
“How am I meant to fit into your clothes? You’re all—” Lost for words, he gestured at him instead “—you.”
Blaise muttered something inaudible, and when Draco arched an eyebrow threateningly, he quickly changed the subject. Sort of.
“I could pop by next week, if that would give you enough time? In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with a way for you to contact me—I have a Muggle address but the post seems a bit—”
Harry shut his eyes, and let it happen—momentarily afraid to move, or open them—lest she see the war of emotions in him. He felt worse still when Ginny smiled into their soft press of lips, and then it was over, and Harry had to take a deep breath before he opened his eyes.
Impossibly smooth lips ghosted over the straining length of his cock, and Draco gripped tight around the throb of it to rub the edge of Harry’s tip against his lips, parting them just enough to flick his tongue out wetly.
“You know it will be. Worse even. I’d also like to point out that you were the one who wanted to do this all in one go.”
“Fucking Merlin that is dark, Potter. And wrong. I’ve always loved my parents…I’ll grant you I might’ve been happier and more well-adjusted if they hadn’t fallen in with the petrifying snake man…Now could we talk about literally
“Firewhisky?” Draco offered coolly, walking back toward the tent they’d shared the night before, what would soon be their new office, drawn by the promise of the spirits they’d left in its kitchen.
A hesitation of Draco’s mouth on his cock, faltering as he considered—though even as he did, his tongue swirled wickedly on Harry’s tip, teasing out a few salty drops of Harry’s desperation before he very slowly pulled Harry’s cock from his mouth.
He closed the small distance between them, rubbing hard at Harry’s cock through his jeans before he was pressing flush to his front, locking their lips.
Harry’s cock twitched dangerously close, he caught a tight groan in the back of his throat, but he fucked as hard as he could, for as long as he could, even after Draco went face down and arse up on the bed, shuddering into another profound climax. He kept on until Draco begged him to come, and it was too hot to hold it off any longer—thrusting unsteadily, until the scorching impact of his own orgasm gradually subsided.
They wouldn’t need to have identical interiors, so long as the rooms and furniture were all there, but it would probably be best if his weren’t so obviously clashing. As with their conversations on spellcraft, he felt a bit out of his depth, but he trusted Draco’s judgement so far as it related to taste level. He certainly knew more than Harry did.
“Tried to sneak him a hat once,” Draco said with a wry smile. “Didn’t work, though. It had to be Father then.”
your parents? I’m not going to turn a corner and be hexed for surprising your father at tea or something?”
Glancing back at her, just before he tossed his powder into the flames, Harry frowned in tipsy thought. “He must know that. Maybe… I dunno, maybe that’s part of the problem.”
But he was losing all sense of time, and found himself feeling out the long length of Draco’s swelled cock as he stroked him, the weight of it and the way he grew ever stiffer each time Harry pressed into that place inside that sent Draco into an arching writhe against him.
Hi! This chapter took longer than I expected and life interfered for a bit but I'm mostly happy with it.
Harry had already forgotten. Draco was very distracting—and he had Harry’s wand now, arching an eyebrow as he twirled it gracefully in his fingers.
As the night progressed, as with any good wedding reception, the revelries intensified, plied by many a drink and the increasingly raucous nature of the music.
As close as they were now, it became very clear that just the vibration of Harry’s voice alone was causing the body against his to shudder softly.
To distract himself, Harry was trying to map out the route from the ballroom to the kitchen in his head, but it was very twisty. He could get from the ballroom to the library—that was fairly straightforward—but then he couldn't remember how to get from the library to the kitchen either, so that wasn’t terribly helpful. Thankfully, he had Draco there to guide him.
“I forgot the bloody etiquette lessons,” he muttered, attempting to straighten his posture just the same. “Fine. Go on then, explain the unnecessary number of forks.”
A minty cloud of steam trailed behind as he levitated the tray up the stairwell, and it took a few more minutes to prepare them each a cup. Draco slept the entire time, and eventually Harry had to climb up the bed and lie down beside him, pushing his fingers cautiously through Draco’s hair before he finally stirred.
When Harry got close enough to bump his lips up the length of Draco’s cock, Draco tangled long fingers in dark hair to pull him back, smirking down at Harry smugly.
Anymore, Harry knew the longer he waited to admit what he was doing, the more tangled his absurd web would become. Yet he could not bring himself to be honest with her, or anyone else. It was so much easier to pretend like everything was normal…except for the bit where he was constantly thinking about Draco Malfoy.
As close as they were, when silver met green, a chill danced down Harry’s spine that he found utterly maddening, given he had to walk away.
In fact, the room was almost all mirrors, and disconcertingly it reminded Harry of a carousel, only without all the painted horses and lions and such. The mirrors were edged in ornamental gilt carving, and three twinkling chandeliers cast a warm glow, echoed back in an infinity of reflections all around them.
The hall was pitch black, and for whatever reason the blue flames that lined the hall did not flare to life as they exited the lift. Harry waited a moment to see if they would before whispering a quiet
“We’ll be looking for a lot of some sort—one centrally located between here and the settlement you mentioned near the riverbank. You know the area far better than either of us, we had hoped you might have some suggestions.”
He tried to send a message on the blackboard first, but he hadn’t answered, and Harry was too impatient then to wait around. It was also possible he was eager to share a bit more than his improved casting.
When Harry returned to the ball it was to discover that someone had enchanted some sort of mint-flavoured snow to fall continuously down on the solstice celebrators below. He didn’t have to guess too hard who might be responsible for it either.
Harry hummed, his hand migrating to circle the proud length of him and stroke as he washed away whatever honey he’d failed to suck off. He let out another low noise of encouragement when Draco caught his cock in a fiercely tight grip, tugging in perfect time to Harry’s hand on him.
“As much as I would like to take advantage of you right now, in numerous ways, I haven’t the energy to lift my head—so it will all have to wait.”
Draco’s moans turned desperately demanding, pressing his forehead to the mirror’s surface and gripping the back of the chair to push back on Harry’s mouth harder.
Harry knew that didn’t come out very convincing, given he thought any gathering of the sort would be all dour moods and sarcasm.
By the time August’s second Saturday arrived, Harry was really looking forward to exploring London when he wasn’t having to relive his parents’ deaths.
Harry hadn’t fully understood the reasoning behind the tactic, and Ron looked similarly confused, although that might have also been Harry’s piss poor excuse for an explanation.
?” Harry was proud of himself for switching to Parseltongue mid-sentence, and was rewarded watching the flush painting high on pale cheeks. “Afraid you can’t control yourself?”
want him. If Harry couldn’t control himself, his only alternative would mean sacrificing months of hard work entirely, his own and Draco’s—not to mention however many people they might’ve helped if they actually succeeded turning their ideas from theory to praxis. Draco was right that Harry couldn’t do it all on his own.
When they were settled on opposite sides, their drinks and the stack of books between them, Malfoy picked back up where he had left off at the bar.
There was a superior sort of quirk to his pinker-than-usual lips that Harry found particularly daunting. But as sitting was all he felt capable of, he was careful lowering himself down to join Malfoy on the floor; he hadn’t the brain power for anything more.
Spinning around, Harry caught him by the cheek to kiss him hard, and Draco moaned very frustratedly into it.
He sucked gently at them, when he wasn’t teasing all over the sensitive skin with his tongue. As his mouth worked over them, Harry caught Draco’s cock in a tight grip, still somewhat slick from Harry’s mouth, and stroked him roughly.
On the other hand, neither of them appeared to doubt Harry’s story in the slightest, so perhaps it wasn’t that terrible.
“I should start by saying… there is no practicable way for us to hand it all out in a disorganised free-for-all. Not in a way that wouldn’t put ourselves and anyone involved under far too much scrutiny. It’s not going to work.”
Propping himself on one forearm left his hand free to pin Draco’s hips firm to the mattress to thrust into him. Which turned out to be necessary, because every time he slid deep Draco writhed against the mattress, trying to push back on his cock—but he soon discovered if he fucked down hard and quickly enough, Draco didn’t have the time or space to push back.
"I don't know, Malfoy.” Harry felt very tired all of a sudden. “Hermione’s completely absorbed in her Centaur Rights cases now. Ron’s busy too, with the shop, I almost never see him… Surely you must be getting bored stuck in that dusty Manor with all your books and alchemy bollocks."
Harry held up immediately. Given the squeeze of intense pressure around his cock he was a little shaky, but he quirked an exasperated eyebrow at Draco anyway.
Draco’s narrow fingers dug into his shoulders and Harry grabbed at his arse possessively, but he was still thinking about what happened when it was over. He was thinking about that moment when he had to go back home, and Draco told him to have a good evening, and he went back to an empty house, and thought about what a horrible person he was being.
Between them there settled a silent acceptance of this, and Malfoy also seemed to take it as some sort of compliment, if the way he was smirking was any indication. But Harry’s mind was still spiralling with thoughts that he was now intent on sharing, whether or not Malfoy actually wanted to hear them.
“Fuck me harder, and I’ll come all over your charming little bed again,” Draco drawled throatily, full of lust.
He picked out a book he’d been intending to read through instead, and settled into the armchair beside Draco’s settee to read. Every once and awhile he would look up when Draco shifted, but he stayed asleep for over an hour.
Draco was properly shuddering now, and Harry shifted down the bed and caught the tip of Draco’s cock between his lips, sucking wetly. Then, he hissed against the slit of it, stroking faster.
He moved as quietly as he could down his creaky staircase to make a pot of tea, and in the kitchen he rediscovered the door to the back garden hanging open.
Draco whined pleasure at each, arching through pain and desire the more persistently he smacked. Harry couldn’t help being entirely enthralled by exactly how well he reacted, every heated sound following the firm bounce under his palm. With each strike Draco squirmed, and Harry's cock throbbed, prodding demandingly up against Draco's front—surely why Harry kept on so long.
A stilted cough drifted out from the bit of balcony currently cast in shadow, and gave Harry a (delayed) start. He spun around too quickly in search of its source, managing to make himself dizzy in the process.
Ron swung by a little closer tossing the Quaffle idly in the air. “You know he probably would if you asked—and he knows some pretty great Seeker feints as well.”
What they found instead was a queue. Stretching up the narrow alley and onto the main road, it was impossible to see where it began, but Harry estimated there must’ve been nearly fifty Muggles just from the end of the line to the corner they disappeared around. And it seemed he had been very wrong about the sort of people he expected to find drawing so many Dementors to London.
Fair warning, this chapter is almost twenty pages and a good half of them are sex. You have been warned.
Groaning low, Harry found within himself some reserve of restraint to keep fucking Draco and not just explode under the sensuous sound of him moaning things like that right into Harry’s ear. Draco wasn’t making this easy for him—but he never did.
Draco didn’t touch him again, or bite him, but he didn’t need to, that low voice so close to his ear was enough.
In fairness, he didn’t really know why Malfoy agreed to help him; though he doubted very much it was only out of the goodness of his heart. It hadn’t escaped Harry’s notice that Malfoy might have an ulterior motive, he just couldn’t sort out what it could be.
Hi! It took me a bit longer to get this chapter out but I got sidetracked writing some things for down the line and getting the timeline in order.
Caught up in a wave of uncertainty, he felt an anxious twinge that he had been incredibly foolish—but mostly he was being inundated with a visceral sort of rage that he had not rightly experienced since the end of the War.
Malfoy snickered beside him. “If that is what the potion seems to be telling you… who am I to argue?”
Harry usually did his own, and had since he was very small, excepting the time he’d spent at Hogwarts and the Burrow. At least he now had magic to help—though he was pretty shit at folding charms, only slightly better at them than he was folding by hand. He often left it all unfolded, but it was still one of the few chores he kept up with in the house, much more diligently than he did the dusting in any case.
“Slow?” Cassie suggested with a laugh, nodding. “And I suppose phones don’t work terribly well around magic. But alright, next week would be fine. I look forward to speaking with you, Harry.”
"I'm not suggesting the Ministry do anything at all. In fact I’m fairly positive anything of the sort would break most of the International Secrecy Codes. It wouldn’t be easy."
Harry finally let up—and as soon as Draco had the room not to kick him in the head, he was shifting around to face the back of the chair, gripping the top of it as he arched an eyebrow over his shoulder impatiently.
Harry caught him by the hips and worked Draco’s pants further down his thighs, giving himself better access to sweep his tongue along the soft curve of Draco’s balls.
Which was fine, except they were meant to be paying attention to important details like the levelness of the ground and what the surrounding environment was like, but Harry kept getting distracted watching tiny drops of water catching on the ends of platinum hair. The droplets trailing down Draco’s neck and disappearing under the collar of his suit’s fancy shirt were also very nice.
However, eventually Harry began to get the sense that Hagrid would not be waking on his own anytime soon, and didn’t have the heart to wake him either. He blamed George—or more specifically, he blamed George’s flask.
"By all means then, spend the rest of your life attempting to solve Muggle poverty, instead of hunting down Dark Magic as your job supposedly entails. I'm hardly going to stop you.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the hissing, pressing a hand to Harry’s chest in an attempt to put an inch or two of space between them.
His cheeks went warm, but his jaw set stubbornly. “I didn’t. I mean—yes, I thought about it but not that way. You were such a prick I couldn’t imagine you snogging anyone. It was really strange.”
Harry knew better than to trust the wizarding community at large to support him doing anything terribly unpopular. He recalled how easy it was for the whole of the community to turn on him in the face of a few bad articles.
“I suppose I meant—perhaps improving some of the conditions around here might actually run most of the Dementors off for good,” Harry reasoned as politely as he could manage. He was slowly maturing into diplomacy, yet still it had a tendency to escape him.
Malfoy looked a bit annoyed at the interruption. “Doubtful, as I’ve said, that sort of thing is very tightly controlled. All those tents and the like available for purchase have registration and tracking spells built right into them. There is no way you could pull it off without raising suspicion from either department. Also, they don't come cheap—there’s a reason the Weasel family all squeezed into one.”
No wonder Draco went to pieces when Harry did this to him. He knew he would need to heal anything before Ginny returned, but for now—
He flipped over onto his back, and Draco stretched out close beside him, a slight warmth touching only barely, the hush of his voice very close to Harry’s ear.
However, rather than go up the stairs and knock on his door, Harry decided to stand on the lower level and call out, his voice echoing off the great domed ceiling, loud enough to be heard over the continuous splash of the fountain further in.
After they’d eaten it was getting quite late, and Molly retired to bed with hugs all around—including Arthur, who laughed patiently.
His lips stole Harry’s, kissing him deep and rather hard before he whispered the spell to unravel the ties coiled around Harry’s wrists.
In truth, just then, Harry realised Malfoy looked like the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen, and only grew more so with every subtle shudder and arch of him, and every needy spasm of the long cock in his grip.
Harry snorted distractedly, now more focused on the menu—or rather, the fact he couldn’t read a word of it. “Do you actually understand what you’re looking at here?”
“I know you’ve always enjoyed breaking the rules, but have I mentioned that deliberately violating the Secrecy Statutes, whilst also being in the middle of your Auror training takes spunk?”
Harry repeated the slap on his other cheek, both sides now flushing faint pink. Then he did it again, and again.
Draco, who was now nuzzling sleepily into his neck and languidly rolling taunting hips atop Harry’s. Their lower-halves being all wrapped up in silky sheets, with a least one layer between them, did nothing to hide the stiffness of their cocks when Draco squirmed to more closely align them, spanning Harry’s thighs lazily with his own.
Moaning something vaguely affirmative, Harry leaned into the lithely forward-push of him, until the heavy length of Draco’s cock rubbed at his stomach. Draco was quite bendy, and Harry was close enough now to tease over parted pink lips with his own, so completely surrounded in Draco’s heat it was provoking his already raging arousal to a furious intensity.
“Hasn’t stopped you spending time with me, has it? If I’m wrong, tell me how you really feel about it.”
Probably he should’ve told someone else where he was going—but Harry knew if he didn’t catch up to Malfoy soon, he would likely lose him, so he kept on.
“You too,” Harry muttered, vacillating a moment more before he was stepping back toward the library’s hearth. “Talk to you later.”
When they finally pulled their lips apart, Harry’s head tipped back to breathe, and a bit of paint dropped down onto his cheek.
“Maybe two weeks? Or three… I can’t remember. We were only meant to be questioning someone, but he took one look at me and—”
Harry showered, shaved and brushed his teeth, then took a few minutes to heal the most visible scratches and bites marking his throat. Perhaps he ought to have been reflecting on how awful he was being, but he was sort of in a hurry, and preoccupied thinking about what all they would need to accomplish in the next few days.
As he made his way around the far end of the lake, covering familiar ground quite quickly, he forgot all about going down to The Hog’s Head for lunch.
Harry already felt lost, and then Draco made several more turns after that before they came upon a large iron archway, which opened up into a ridiculously tall atrium, its walls and ceilings all glass and iron as well.
Hello! First off thank you for reading if you're still reading! I'm mostly entertaining myself so it's good to know I'm not the only one enjoying it, and thanks for the comments and the kudos!
“Correct,” Draco intoned, occupying Harry’s lap in one graceful move. “We have unfinished business.”
“If we’re going to do it any time soon, then we ought to before Ginny gets home, this is the longest stretch of time I’ll have to myself for at least a month…we’d have to start this week. I’d need a few days off work—”
He didn’t expect an answer right away, and after several seconds of watching just in case, went out to the kitchen to find something worth eating in the cupboards. He came back a few minutes later with a bit of magically reheated chicken and dropped down on the settee to check the board.
“Same reason we’ve used it before, communication. I’ve got something of an ally on the Muggle side of things, I needed a way to keep in touch.” Harry tried to be cautious about how much he divulged, without seeming like he was outright hiding anything. It was trickier than he expected.
“Yes, yes, I know. Touching strange prophecies is a direct ticket to certain madness. Honestly though… are we not already mad?”
Tracing Harry’s lips with his fingertip, Draco fixed him with a pointed look, then kissed him again, pressing in to taste the salty trace of come lingering on Harry’s tongue.
Harry let out an appreciative sort of groan, really not bothered about the cleanliness of the wall, and fully content to let Draco ravish his lips, as he seemed intent on doing just then—biting and sucking, tracing each with a talented tongue only to bite a little harder. It felt pretty incredible, and Harry’s hands travelled unhesitantly to his arse to pull him in even closer. The persistent adrenaline of fear was still raging through him, but it all quickly shot southward as teeth pinched sharp and impatient beneath his ear. It was incredibly distracting.
“Have you just put that in your mouth?” His normally-perfect hair was only a little sweatily dishevelled.
Harry dropped the letter in shock, his heartbeat pounding abruptly in his ears. Scrambling to retrieve the parchment from the kitchen’s dusty floor, he crumpled it and shoved it into the nearest tea tin.
That was too many words for Harry, so he kissed him again, and felt Draco’s soft sigh between their lips.
“There now, we’ll be able to toss about whatever spells we like without alerting anyone else. What’s the latest then?”
As the blond man arched beneath him, meeting each of his thrusts, and Harry rapidly approached his limit of pleasure—half lidded green eyes caught on a swirling silver serpent inlaid in the elaborate black stone headboard on Draco’s bed.
Draco’s brow took on a slight furrow, as if the matter genuinely troubled him. “Not for now. Tomorrow night, if we’ve finished absolutely everything else and we’ve still time to spare, then we might double back to them. For now, we’ll keep on as we’ve been—”
Draco so rarely looked uncertain, his hesitation felt curiously significant just before he pressed up to steal a single soft kiss—quick, before he was sitting upright to pull a teacup from the tray.
Something about the breathy drawl purred into his ear, his name on Draco’s lips as their hips worked faster caught him completely off guard—when he came it was practically a shout. He only noticed he’d been so loud when he felt Malfoy biting at his lips a moment later.
Draco pulled off him, and Harry’s cock immediately missed the hold of him, but Harry was rewarded with the sight of Draco pushing sweat-damp strands of pale hair back from his face as he peered back over his shoulder at Harry expectantly.
He took another sip, and Harry unthinkingly watched him swallow. It was a surreal moment, recalling that barely a year ago he had watched Malfoy testify before the Wizengamot in this very building. And now—
A few days later found him sitting at his Ministry cubicle late into the afternoon, his mind wandering well off-course of the field reports he was meant to be completing.
Thankfully, thus far Draco hadn’t voiced any objections to Harry’s décor choices, but he wasn’t exactly voicing his approval either.
The note of panic in her voice was familiar, as there appeared to be a new Harpies crisis every week or two.
Blaise was still standing shocked on the bedroom side with a towel—and that look someone had a tendency to take on when incredibly juicy gossip landed in their lap.
But he didn’t have to wonder long, and hadn’t even got his question out before Malfoy was shifting to his knees, there in the cool blue light of the prophecies. One wrong move might send them both spiralling into madness, and the only thing Harry could focus on was the anticipation of having his cock sucked by Draco Malfoy.
“Not at all,” Harry confessed. “But I’m sure you do, so that’s fine. You’re saying we don’t need the curtains for stability?”
“Harry, you need to be careful. Dad always refused to talk about all the Dark Magic artifacts the Malfoy’s’ve got hoarded in that place, but it’s no secret there’s a lot of them. You have checked these over for curses first, before you brought them into the house. …Haven’t you?”
He wasn’t even certain he’d read her properly at first, but now she had gone a bit giggly and he became even more certain—however, he was also disinclined to come right out and ask.
That made him huff out a laugh as he slipped his trousers on properly. “I have to be awake in two hours… It’s going to be a very long day.”
It was loud and echoey, what with all the moaning and the wet impact of heated skin in the few inches of water still left in the bottom of the bath.
“I think you’ll find you’re the one being a stubborn prat this time. Just accept the fucking blow job.”
Harry gave him a proper blow job in the tent’s comfy little sitting room, teasing his fingers dry over the tight swirl of his arse and the sensitive taint just behind his balls—until Harry felt them tensing against his forearm and the firm length of Draco’s cock twitched against the hold of Harry’s lips.
He dropped panted bites at Draco’s ear, struggling to control the urge to rush and fuck him until they both exploded.
Harry didn’t know why that was making him blush so unreasonably pink but it was very annoying. Well, perhaps he knew why a little bit.
And before they finally got around to the washing bit of their shower. Which they got over with pretty quickly, as the water had started to go cold—one more annoying little quirk of Harry’s house.
Harry was only a series of quick faltering thrusts behind him, grinding down flush on his arse as he came, too hard.
He backed Draco up against the edge of his kitchen counter, trailing sharp sucking bites from just beneath Draco’s chin to the base of his throat—pausing only to whisper a spell against soft skin that set Draco’s shirt to unbuttoning itself—and then Harry continued his trail of nipping and tongue-tracing down Draco’s chest.
“You’ve got an exquisite cock, Potter,” Draco taunted low beneath his ear, teeth catching at Harry’s skin until said cock was twitching dangerously between them. Then he traced his lips along the shell of Harry’s ear. “Put it inside.”
True, Draco had told him to shut up, but Harry was used to that anymore—it almost seemed Draco’s odd way of trying to reassure him. But fuck if Draco acknowledging it had been excellent didn’t set something in Harry’s chest skipping absurdly fast. They had never once in all their letters done more than allude to anything beyond the vaguest notions of their research, and nothing really beyond that. These days, their owls were usually all exchanging times to meet—
“Well, it has been lovely chatting with you in this—” He seemed to be struggling to find an insulting enough descriptor.
They’d tried it in the water first—but Harry hadn’t been able to thrust hard enough to satisfy either of them, so they’d let it all drain out.
“It’s a mild hallucinogen, with a large punch of bliss inducers, some inhibition inhibitor… and a hint of cinnamon.” He looked very proud.
Harry watched him work curiously. He rarely bothered cooking with magic. Having learnt to do it the Muggle way at Privet Drive, it was the only way he knew. There were times he had seen Ginny use her mother’s recipe spells, but she had only ever cast the steps one at a time—never all at once like this, with ingredients mixing themselves all along the table.
As close as he was, Harry couldn’t miss the small twitch of amusement to Draco’s lips, before he gave up on Harry’s hair and stepped back.
“She’s been travelling all summer, but she’ll be coming home to her father’s next month. She’s got a lot of marvellous adventures to tell me about…and also I’m to remember to dispel my wrackspurts.”
Harry watched Draco wrapping up the last few syllables and wand-waves, and as he lowered his wand the blond swayed precariously on his feet.
“I also have a lot of work to do if we’re going to be ready for this week. But for now, I’ll let you wash off the honey you’ve insisted on smearing all over me, and if you change the sheets after I might consider getting back into bed with you.”
They were both moaning profusely when Harry bottomed out in his arse, rocking him forward on the bed—as though he could possibly get any deeper. Draco pushed back, tensing purposefully.
But Harry was still teasing, wetly tracing his tongue up over Draco’s hole and back down, pressing in every time he licked over the stretched whirl, still salty with sweat and rather a lot of Harry’s come. Probably it wasn’t fair for him to be tempting Draco like this when he wasn’t ready to let him go all the way. Harry wasn’t ready for all of him, yet he felt more than ready for this.
Draco got on with the whole brushing process very perfunctorily, and kept on a minute more after Harry finished, though he did pause to arch an eyebrow through the mirror—alerting Harry to the fact he’d completely failed at not staring, again.
Amusingly, Harry realised Draco had asked him that very same question when he’d first raised the matter. He could really only blame the peachy-cinnamon drinks, but he wasn’t going to admit that now.
Even if she didn’t push his buttons ‘properly’, that didn’t mean he cared for her any less. But truthfully, he didn’t crave her, not in nearly the same way his everything now ached to see Draco again.
With a choked, high-pitched sort of noise, Draco was spilling over Harry’s fingers in seconds, his own clawing for purchase on the wooden edge of Harry’s kitchen counter as he arched against it—
“I dunno, Harry. If it were me I might just lamp him and be done with it. Screw the bloody community service, rehabilitation nonsense. He’s always been fully rotten
Draco’s shirt was left draped over the iron railing of the spiral staircase leading up toward his bedroom, where Harry had arched him back on the railing while he worked Draco’s buttons open by hand, biting gently down his chest with each unfastening.
Tucking their wands away, they retraced their steps back to the off-street where Harry had first spotted the Dementors congregating. He supposed what he expected to find down that tiny road was some sort of den of iniquity, the worst of the worst sort of people.
Listening to his quick steps echoing off the stone corridors, some of Draco’s careful control slipped. “Fucking Gryffindor
They stripped in the sitting room, then made for the shower, where Harry fucked him roughly against the shower wall until they both peaked into perfectly intense pleasure.
Draco chuckled low, lifting his hips enough that Harry could release his own cock from his pants, already eagerly stiff. He helped work down Draco’s too, enough to reveal his bare arse to Harry.
Malfoy stepped closer just behind him, close enough now that when Harry naturally tried to glance back, pale thin fingers grasped his jaw, facing him forwards again.
“You could come back to the Manor for tea—if you’d like,” Malfoy offered, with a careful sort of indifference, which Harry found a bit suspect.
Harry busied himself pulling one of several sleek black dining chairs out from the table, and slouching into it with a quiet groan. He stretched a bit as well, and only just happened to catch Draco watching him go about it.
Perhaps ‘lucky’ had been the wrong word, but Harry was too far drunk to bother choosing his words more carefully. It still sounded to him like Malfoy was just feeling sorry for himself.
“I don’t like this at all, Mate. What if he’s planning to do horrible things to you the moment you let your guard down?”
He’d offered to help, but Draco waved him off, so Harry occupied himself trying to roll some of the tension from his shoulders with a thoughtful hum.
Standing at the bottom of them, Harry caught Draco at the hips as he went to take them, and pulled him back down, forcing the very eager stiffness in his jeans against Draco’s arse. Draco rocked roughly back against the rise of his cock with another low moan, and Harry groaned, thrusting forward even harder.
He felt a catch in Draco’s breathing when he nudged the tip of his nose along the shell of his ear, getting a bit lost in the increasingly familiar scent of coconut and something spiced, so much stronger when they were this close. Harry could also feel the growing tension in Draco when he trailed his palm down Draco’s chest to the top of his trousers.
“It’s a Merlin spell,” he said offhand. “If you’ve got an object with a purpose of some sort, it will usually enchant it to do its job independently. I’ll write it down for you later.”
Malfoy kept his hand over Harry’s a moment and their eyes locked for the time it took him to whisper a quiet lubrication charm. Now Harry could squeeze a bit tighter. When he did, gripping hard and tugging faster, it was completely enthralling to watch the shifting twitch of Malfoy’s hips, and the steady building flush under normally so pale cheeks.
Before attempting to sleep, he pulled out the Protean light, tapped it on and wrote out ‘MEET FRI?’ over its dome in blue marker. Then he tucked it away again to glow in the dark of his drawer. With any luck, Cassie would see it when she went to work the next morning.
Huffing his frustration into the kiss, Harry only tried to kiss harder—but he couldn’t entirely relax the anxiety coursing through him, it was overwhelming.
“The biggest alteration would be in what triggers the jinx, and the ensuing consequences—then we would need to limit it significantly, so that it applied only to those who’ve passed through the enchantments of...wherever we’re doing this. Ideally then, it would require a more reasonable amount of power to cast. If we, or—really, if
Draco grabbed for the handle too, and Harry nearly dropped him a second time when the door flew open with a magically-enhanced force, slamming against the wall with a loud wooden
Humming a low acknowledgement, Harry edged with his teeth a touch harder, and Draco thrust past the sharpness. The luridly drawn-out depth of his moan stood Harry’s cock to hard attention, tenting the worn cotton of his bottoms.
Catching his gaze with that same hint of uncertainty, Draco stepped close enough to nip softly at his lips. Harry leaned in, his tongue sliding warmly between Draco’s for a quietly moaned kiss before Draco pulled hurriedly away, stepping back toward the sitting room hearth.
Harry frowned thoughtfully, and stood to stretch. They had been working for quite a while now, and his brain needed a bit of a break.
He knew all of these questions were coming, and even so, Harry had to swallow around a lump in his throat before he could speak.
Ginny wasn’t actually there that evening, and would be on the road with the Harpies for the majority of October, which only gave Harry more room to thrash—until whatever nightmare he was having about the War gave way to something new.
,” Draco whispered, and their tangled fingers grew slick and slippery. He trailed a path of sharp bites along Harry’s jaw to his ear before he elaborated any further. “We’ll be doing things the long way this time. No spells…except for that one.”
“Er. Alright, then. I have work this week as normal, but didn’t you say you wanted to meet up for spells practice soon?”
“Goodnight,” Draco threw out offhandedly, already back to scanning his book, and apparently not intending to put any clothes on any time soon.
“We’ve barely covered everything we should’ve today. If you’re able to make the time, we might meet in a week or two to go over my progress. Have you spent any time practicing the spell?”
“It sort of… came up in conversation. ‘Suppose I thought it couldn’t do any real harm to ask. It was all my idea really; he’s just offered to do some of the research. Said he liked the challenge of it, I don’t know.”
Gripping under Draco’s knee, Harry spread him wider, whispering a short lubrication spell and thrusting right back in. They fell into a speeding rhythm of cries, raw noises, and shamelessly urging each other on to another pair of euphoric orgasms. Harry fucked into his sweet spot relentlessly, watching Draco come in hard throbs up his chest before he gave over to spilling inside him one more time.
“I’m not exactly sure what you did at the end there, but it felt a bit like—erm, like that one time in the library. You know?”
“Took them about nine hours to heal it and it’s still not completely gone away. Healer said it shouldn’t scar though.”
Moreover, he should know better than to let Draco bloody Malfoy shape his moral compass over whether or not he should be worried about being a duplicitous prat. Obviously he should be worried—and the more he thought about the potential consequences, what people might think of him, the more panic set in that he really needed to get it all under control before it exploded in his face.
Prodding at a small pile of herbs with the tip of his wand, Draco paused to smirk. “No, I didn’t think you would.”
He swallowed as much as he could, trying not to choke a second time as he eased off slowly. Draco’s cock fell spent against his front, and Harry licked over it a bit longer, appreciating the prone tremors he was drawing out of the man beneath him.
Harry surprised them both by laughing, and as his eyes adjusted to the light, he thought he caught the edge of a bemused smirk from Malfoy as well, but it did not last, if it had ever really existed at all. An odd mix of old tensions and awkward silence fell over them, yet Harry was far too drunk to analyse what was happening around him. Only very few thoughts filtered through the fog.
Only in a magic Manor would anyone risk a fireplace so close to so many ancient, likely irreplaceable books, but Draco didn’t seem to find the crackle of the flames concerning in the least.
Draco waited for him to catch back up to reality before he spoke, his chin settling pointily on Harry’s shoulder as he peered out at the bit of kitchen behind them.
A part of him registered the potion had started to fade—though it might have been an hour ago or five minutes for all Harry knew—another part registered that his cock was throbbing sorely in his trousers, pain and a precarious sort of need.
As salad went, it wasn’t very good, wilted and notably flavourless. He’d definitely had better, he’d even made better, but he ate it anyway, with the right fork even, and it wasn’t very long before the rest of their meal arrived.
Harry’s palms immediately found purchase on Draco’s arse and pulled him down flush, all soft skin and hard lines, and they both moaned quietly into a swirl of tongues. He knew his stamina was not up to anything at all just then, but that didn’t seem to make him want Draco any less.
It was a bit of a walk away, but Harry thought of exactly how comfortable he recalled Draco’s bed being and sighed.
There was a wicked slant to his smirk then that made Harry very nervous, but as Malfoy paced an idle circle around him, something about the shine of silver-blue light in his eyes was
He had been back in the cave with Dumbledore, while he sobbed for Harry to make the hurt stop, and when he woke his cheeks were wet. It took him another four hours to get back to sleep, and he only eventually managed it when he went down to stretch out by the fire, on the settee in his sitting room.
Harry’s first thought was that Draco wore the Muggle look quite well—for someone who spent so much of his life hating them.
Ginny kissed him more squarely then, and Harry felt his cheeks flush—and a sort of sinking in his stomach that he’d only just recently started experiencing when he kissed her. It all felt so wrong. In a heartbeat he felt a wave of guilt and fear and a painful awareness that her lips were not doing to him what Draco’s lips always seemed to do.
Savage and a number of other Aurors were staring at Harry as he awkwardly scrambled up from his chair. He had to think of very boring things like water fountains and flowers to stop the very real danger of blushing or getting hard in front of all his coworkers.
“Suppose I might mention it next time he visits, but I haven’t got much use for Seeker moves anymore. I’m always playing you and Ginny, and neither of you ever wants to go Snitch catching.”
Harry did not allow himself to meet Malfoy’s eye then. He couldn’t, afraid of the question he might see there, or maybe he was more afraid of seeing nothing there at all. Regardless, he kept focus on his half-empty pint instead.
He helped himself to a dry but mostly edible biscuit in the meantime, and the quiet between the snores was comforting.
he’d said that night at the ball was a shock, given he was not generally well known for his charitable nature, most especially when it came to Muggles.
Harry knew that the evening part was meant to be something of a release from the pain of remembering, but he found himself dreading it as well—all the stories, questions, the stares—just the trauma of it all. He didn’t want to go through it again, last year had been hard enough.
Harry had a lot to get done before Wednesday, but a bit of flying wouldn’t take all night, and he hadn’t seen the familiar freckled face since his birthday gathering—a night so chaotic and full of firewhisky he only barely recalled speaking with him. He couldn’t bring himself to beg off this time, so he accepted.
As Malfoy pointed his wand, Harry spent a moment appreciating it for what it was. It had served him quite well in the final battle, its unicorn core un-corrupted, even despite Malfoy's somewhat forced turn to darkness those last few years.
Cleverly, Draco managed to rinse and tease back at the same time, easy enough to do when he had to bend over to spit, and bending over only pressed him more firmly to the stiff outline of Harry’s cock. Straightening up, he only needed to turn his head the tiniest bit for Harry to be drawn to smirking lips.
“That can’t be right,” Malfoy disagreed dryly, only managing to confuse him further. “But as we’re unlikely to be interrupted all the way in here...I’ll need you to be honest with me.”
Lately, the Fates were in the habit of throwing wildly inappropriate situations at Harry when he least expected them, and it was all starting to shake his foundations a bit.
For someone who purportedly wasn’t interested in cuddling, Draco was starting to make a regular habit of sitting on him. Harry squirmed to unseat him with a testy groan, but far from jostled he climbed gracefully off with a quiet snicker.
Still gasping, Harry nevertheless pushed his tongue past Draco’s lips to slide against his tongue, and their moans intertwined again. He got in a bit of residual thrusting too, drawing out their searing afterglow—impossible to resist when Draco’s ensuing noises were so enticing.
Harry felt he might come apart at any second—but he very much wanted to give Draco what he asked for. Finding a rhythm with enough force to fuck him, Harry had to push his cock repeatedly through intense tightness, and somehow not come before Draco did.
“Look, you don’t have to make any commitments—” Harry continued advocating, ignoring the exaggerated glare with which Malfoy attempted to quell him. “—only think about what I’ve said, maybe you’ll have some ideas, that’s all.”
“Erm,” said Harry. “Things’ve…changed, a bit. Since the war and all. You know. He’s helping me with the case.”
Harry smirked at him a bit proudly for a few oblivious moments. He only snapped out of it when Draco shot him a look, and he recalled he had one more thing he needed to ask.
He pulled out momentarily to capture an escaping trail before pushing back in, wriggling around inside until Draco writhed back on his tongue.
While not exclusively, there were naturally an abundance of Slytherins and Ravenclaws present for the festivities. Despite the significant easing of tensions between the houses after the war, Harry still felt a bit… outnumbered. Even if these days he supposed the worst that might happen was a stretch of awkward silence. Gone were the days when the mere presence of Gryffindors and Slytherins in the same room together would come to blows, hexes, or worse.
“Nice job,” Harry said spontaneously, and caught Malfoy smirking proudly as he pulled the shoebox off the table to examine it more closely.
Harry took a step a little too wide and hissed a pained sort of noise when his everything objected to the movement. Perhaps he wouldn’t take it again
Expelling a shaking breath behind him, Draco started stroking himself at an increasingly feverish pace. Harry felt the twitch of him in quickening prods over his arse, and with a deep moan his eyes fell closed against the bolts of pleasure sparking straight to his cock with every touch.
Rocking his hips up, Draco worked himself closer to the edge of the desk, and more firmly onto Harry’s cock.
Harry deliberately left out the bit where it was because he had wanted to get everything off the ground before Ginny got back.
Draco growled a frustrated noise and bit into the soft skin just above his nipple, and Harry hissed in a tight breath at the spike of pain. Caught under an impatient mouth, he only wanted more.
Except Harry was certain it was him. For a split second, Malfoy glanced back over his shoulder and Harry thought he might’ve looked right at him before he disappeared into the Forbidden Forest’s thick tree line.
Then he Apparated home—before he could give in to the impulse to stay and sort out why Malfoy was so reluctant to accept a simple ‘thank you’.
Harry’s impatience sparked then, pushing into an unmoving grip—but Draco released him, and shifted up to find his lips instead, hovering just over them with his own. So close, that Harry got a bit lost in the lust darkening silver staring back at him, but he didn’t close the distance between them either—he let Draco draw out his tease.
Dropping his bags in front of the fireplace, Harry hurried to close the short distance between them to kiss him. Dropping the book he was levitating, Draco let him, kissing back for several blissful seconds, with an almost imperceptible sigh. His lips were softly warm, and he smelled as wonderful as he always did.
Of course he remembered the Malfoy trials that January following the war, and the horrors those trials had forced them all to relive, all of it rushing by again in a painful flash of harsh reality. It had been nearly a year since the start of them—though it felt like so much longer since they'd had to fight for their lives.
His final stop for the day was the very first shelter he and Savage had cleared of Dementors. It was smaller than many of the others, but had been just as busy every time they had gone by to clear off the worst of them. Thankfully there were no floating wraiths lingering by the doors that afternoon, and no queue out the door either.
Draco sighed, but summoned some for him, quill and ink as well, and Harry took a seat at the table to write his reply.
"Magic can't fix money problems, Potter, or the Weasley's wouldn’t’ve been paupers for generations."
Following his gaze, Malfoy tensed noticeably before seeming to regain his composure. He even twisted his forearm into the glowing blue light of the prophecy shelves.
Harry raced back down several minutes later, having also changed out of his work clothes into jeans and a tighter than his usual shirt. Draco seemed to like him in Muggle clothes, even if he complained about them.
“And?” Harry felt an itching need to leave, before either of them accidentally bumped into the wrong corner. “Are you satisfied?”
After that he’d given up on the whole idea, though as it happened he needn’t have put himself through the anguish at all.
Eating with one hand, he flicked his wand at the board with the other. His first question disappeared, and he replaced it with another.
He broke off with a quiet gasp when Draco placed a few emphatic bites up his cock through his jeans.
Irrationally, Harry wanted to pull him back again. It was Draco’s next point that stopped him, it certainly wasn’t the paperwork.
“We went to Hagrid’s looking for you after the afternoon speeches, but he was asleep. We found your note—”
“Tonight. Once we’ve finished with all the extensions I’ll let you fuck me again, and you can lick me wherever you like, for as long as you like—”
In the end they barely got out of bed all day. Every time Harry might’ve had the chance to reflect on how wrong it was that he was fucking Draco for hours in the bed he shared with Ginny—well, he didn’t have the blood flow to reflect on anything but how good Draco felt all around his cock, which was really incredibly good.
need socks, there’s never enough—but yes no, I’ll sort out what I can, and bring a starter list with me tomorrow. Will that work?”
Harry started biting at his throat, catching pale skin between his teeth and biting to bruise when he felt the growing tremors inside Draco intensifying.
Harry hummed something of an agreement, bumping their lips together playfully—but Draco resisted taking his bait.
Harry couldn’t stop, and didn’t want to—he had no idea how long he spent in that clearing, steadily fucking him against the grass as they both repeatedly came to the sparks of the potion raging through them. It must have been hours. At some point he found Draco’s prostate, and he didn’t really know what he'd found, beyond when he hit just the right place inside him Draco came again.
“There now. That ought to do—in a day or two. Try not to rub it off in the meantime. Baths only, no showers.”
Thankfully, once again, all the ticking and the sparkling in the room made good cover, and Harry was fairly certain they had not been spotted by anyone. Surely they would’ve been stopped if they had.
“You could do with a lesson or two,” Draco drawled with understated disinterest. “We can start today—you’ll need it where we’re going.”
He did not think very hard about reaching out to run his fingers curiously down the length of it. He told himself he was only testing his sensing skills, searching for any hint of magic beneath the surface, a trace of the evil that once had been. Obviously or not, there was nothing left to sense, only the fading ghosts of a lubrication charm, and whatever spell Malfoy used on his hair to make it so shiny.
He saw Ginny off in the sitting room, pressing an affectionate kiss to her forehead as she hugged him. Then she pulled back to fuss at Harry’s shirt.
When Harry finally knocked on Hagrid’s door there was no answer, save Fang’s rumbling barks, and rather than wait Harry pushed the door open to greet him.
Harry’s crooked smirk went a bit self-satisfied, but he was much gentler pushing in. He held Draco’s gaze through every inch, if only to be sure he was truly alright. When he was in fully balls-deep he whispered an extra lubrication charm, and soon he was dragging slowly in and out of the tight hold of Draco’s arse as they both moaned in voices wrecked from a lot more moaning, and a bit of cock sucking too.
Harry couldn’t help but to be interested. The kitchen looked fairly ancient, all wood and stone and black iron. It was quite large, clean and neatly organised—and not nearly so small, dusty or cluttered as Harry’s kitchen.
Harry’s cock twitched warningly as he went on intoning low in Draco’s ear. “Two days, then we’ll fuck your sheets filthy too.”
“None of these enchantments restrict access outright—coming or going—the biggest hurdle here is finding the right figures for the magic to assess who’s really in need, versus who might have intent to cause harm—well, I’ll circle back to that, but it’s not an easy thing to sort—even Hogwarts hasn’t got perfect security.”
Harry sighed heavily, as if the weight of the world were on his shoulders once again, and Malfoy spared him another exasperated glare.
“Not terribly fluently, but Mother and I also fancy shopping in Paris occasionally, and I've spent a few summers there. I’ve picked up enough to read a menu.”
Harry’s self-control would not last hours, and he knew it—yet he found himself following suit, hanging up his robes as Malfoy had done, and settling into a sitting position beside him on the grass. Hesitantly, Harry removed his glasses, and slowly lowered himself down to lie on the forest floor beside his former rival.
“Then we mustn’t get caught. I know you know how to sneak around; you were always better at it than I was.”
All of his focus poured into working his hips between pale thighs until he could make Draco come moaning his name, and Harry came not very long after.
It took almost no time at all for him to get hard again, what with Draco working his arse right up against Harry’s cock and rubbing back all slippery and firm, the light strands of his hair dripping and tickling over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry sat shoulder to shoulder with Ron and Hermione for the early ceremony—and they had not been given a choice to sit anywhere but in the front row.
Malfoy arched a slow eyebrow at him, and with a lazy wave of his wand, the tent removed itself from Harry’s hands and began erecting itself.
He was drifting from important details of the interior transfiguration—the furniture, the way the kitchen and the bathroom would need to pull magically from a nearby water source, weather-proofing, and wallpaper.
With an extremely tight moan, Harry risked shoving deeper for several thrusts as a devastating ecstasy found his break point, flooding hot from his bollocks to the tip of his cock. Easing out slowly as he came, a final bolt of heat moved through him as Harry stroked to urge his last drops over the already sticky centre of Draco’s arse.
“The longer this takes, the longer it drags on for the Muggles, the Ministry, the whole lot…” Harry was torn. “But if you really think you could pull it off, I haven’t got a better idea. We can’t very well go around Obliviating everyone involved.”
Draco hummed dispassionately at Harry’s thanks and took a sip of tea before he went on. “I should be getting back to the Manor soon.”
Draco went on riding him a bit longer yet, trailing rather sticky fingers up to trace over Harry’s lips.
“That was the idea.” Draco leveled him with a rather piercing look, and a knowing smirk. “What are you proposing as an alternative?”
He spent his Monday off with her, and they’d had tea in their tiny back garden. Harry had talked with her about her upcoming final games of the season, what players they were looking at for next year, and how excited she was to be home more often over the summer.
But Harry couldn’t help but notice his stag appeared somewhat more subdued than usual. He watched it joining Savage’s goose (moving at a significantly slower speed) in a lap around the area, seeming to ensure their safety before dissipating as well.
Several long wordless seconds met his question. Then, huffing hushed exasperation, Draco set his teacup aside and crawled the small distance on the bed to take Harry’s away too, sending it floating wandlessly back to the tray. Harry didn’t have to guess too hard what he might be up to—there was a distinctly predatory look in the sunlit grey of his eyes—and it felt pretty good when Draco crawled nakedly into his lap.
his wand as the torches within lit themselves with sapphire flames. As Malfoy pulled the door closed behind them, Harry immediately shut his eyes to prepare for the inevitable disorientation he knew was coming when the walls started spinning all around them.
Harry wasn’t able to follow his exchange with their waiter in the slightest, but for some maddening reason it was quite attractive to hear. In such a way that he thought he might better understand why Draco liked it so much when he spoke Parseltongue.
Harry caught grey eyes watching him then, and drew in a tight breath when Draco leant in to brush his lips just at his jawline. Then he very carefully, somehow still gracefully climbed to his feet, gathered up his robes and began heading back the way they had come all those many hours ago.
“I suppose that one will do. In the morning we’ll need to pack everything up and shrink it all down as carefully as possible, I doubt we’ll have the energy for it tonight.”
Nevermind the fact he had absolutely just called Draco a whore, or the part where Draco had no idea what he'd said last Saturday, because he'd said it all in Parseltongue—he was not prepared to examine his extraordinary levels of hypocrisy at the moment. All he could think of was Zabini in Draco’s bed, hearing him moan the way Harry always did.
defending Draco to his friends, when Harry was still struggling to justify any sort of forgiveness himself. It wasn’t easy for him to parse, even before adding in the very compelling arguments his hormones were making.
He nipped at Harry’s lips again before he was moving off to stretch out beside him with a tired groan, on the bed of Harry’s old school robes they had laid down.
“You’ll need to know how to differentiate between the fabrics and the patterns. You wouldn’t want a sitting room full of nothing but polka dot and floral velvet, would you?”
“International Statute of Secrecy. First Edition?” She flipped open the tattered front cover only to freeze. “Property of the
When they finally forced themselves to separate, as the potion’s effects began to abate to nearly-normal, Harry nevertheless immediately felt a void of something fundamentally missing—an ache that grew and was only really satisfied when he gave up trying to do up his trousers and dragged Draco back down on top of him.
It was getting toward evening by then, and Harry supposed they ought to head back to his house—if they were going.
The gasped incoherence just followed Draco’s tensing arch, flooding his throat with seed in several steady shots.
He didn’t mind too much, and he was a good enough flyer to pull it off, but Harry occasionally missed the solitary nature of the Snitch hunt—all the focus required to block out the chaos of a game, pinpointing his target quickly and efficiently before the other Seeker could. On some sleepless nights he’d considered sneaking up to the orchard alone to chase a Snitch through the dark—but he’d only done it once or twice, and found himself often too busy to entertain the idea in daylight hours.
They tried the door to the room full of brains as well—which Harry shut immediately—before finding the correct door to exit the Department of Mysteries. They argued about who was the least lucky of them the entire way back to the lifts, but Harry was just grateful that he hadn’t had to face the Veil.
As they moved past a noisy pub, and several shuttered businesses, Harry noted the street looked a mess, even more so than it had the first time he’d ever come to the Ministry with Mr. Weasley. It had been nearly four years since that day, but after all that had happened in the world, it wasn’t terribly shocking that London was a bit worse for wear as well.
. It simmered through him every time he thought about anyone else touching Draco like he did, and now he couldn’t stop thinking about it. How many others did he have? He hadn’t let on in all these months, but he was very good at being discreet, the sneaky bastard.
The first location they examined had been too sloped, and the next one too obviously flooded to be a good candidate for their needs—because of course, it was raining on the day they had set aside to go look at Cassie’s lot suggestions.
Harry coughed his doubtful amusement. “You’re suggesting that we don’t work ourselves to complete exhaustion this time?”
Setting his book aside, Harry watched the other man a little more lingeringly than necessary before he went for the bag he’d brought with him, pulling out a small collection of things and laying them out randomly on Draco’s desk.
He threw the annoyance of his emotions into the rapid-hard hurtling of the Quaffle, and got two in a row past Ron.
When Harry finally bothered to look around at the rest of the room, all the furniture was where it was meant to be in the mostly-dark, windowless library.
Harry carefully pulled out before tackling him sideways onto the bed. Draco made a complaining noise, shifting to avoid some of the mess under them.
“Oh, well that’s one thing I can definitely help with—it’s what I do here, among a lot of other things of course—oh! Socks! We
The lack of space was a bit awkward, but then Draco’s cheek pressed to his collarbone, his nose nuzzled into Harry’s neck, and Harry could not have given a fuck if they were a little confined then—he wasn’t moving.
What he found particularly nice was the way he could go right back to sleep then, without even bothering to pull out, and Draco let him. In fact, Draco rested his eyes for a few minutes too—but eventually the position was a little too contorted for him and he groaned complainingly and nudged Harry awake enough to move off.
“I’ll let you come on my arse,” Harry offered in quiet English, ignoring a spike of uncertainty in his enthusiasm. “Promise you won’t go too far, and I’ll let you come right on my arsehole.”
Not being terribly invested in the outcome of that particular tradition, and being more than a touch past tipsy, Harry decided to take a break from all of the excitement, if only to avoid making a spectacle of himself.
Harry has to attend the Memorial whether he wants to or not, but his day takes an unexpected turn and a strange potion may just change his life.
Harry kissed him hard as he pushed up to sit, and Draco helped not at all squirming against his trapped cock.
“Oh, I know you, of course. I’ve read all about you—” She cut herself off, large blue eyes shifting uncertainly between them. “Wait a minute, aren’t you two meant to have this massive rivalry of epic proportions? What happened?”
Harry sent back a small Portkey, one from a pair of tarnished cufflinks he’d found in the back of his attic. He had to look up how to link the spell to a matching object, one Harry could keep on him whilst running all about London, and he thought it ought to work quite well.
“Possibly, probably, and if I’m recalling the modifications I’m thinking of correctly, then I could potentially work a few additional stabilising charms into the curtains.”
A brownish vine of thorny white roses climbed a lot of the walls, though they didn’t go all the way up. Toward the back center of the atrium was a great stone fountain, perhaps a meter in depth from the looks of it, with a spiralling serpent statue that rose several stories to spurt a continuous fountain of water from its mouth.
Harry understood how that might be confusing for her—given he hadn’t actually told her anything about his conversation with Malfoy the night of the solstice. She hadn’t asked, and he hadn’t been particularly inclined to volunteer any of what went on that night.
“Not fair?” Harry laughed, while Malfoy scowled at him. “Fine, whatever. I’ll try the paper bag then.”
Some of Harry’s recent research on the formation of the Statute of Secrecy had illuminated that at one point in their history, the Malfoys were quite deeply entwined with the Muggle aristocracy in England and France. In light of their more recent defections, and their fondness for enchanted Muggle artifacts, Harry couldn’t help wondering what all Draco knew about the Muggle world that he never let on.
When Harry opened his eyes to check that the spinning had stopped, Malfoy looked even paler than usual, and the blue flames cast wavering shadows on the dark walls between each of the twelve doors.
it would be to—but Draco was at his lips again. Their noses bumped, and Harry’s glasses jostled when he closed the distance to kiss Draco even harder.
Harry’s question was swallowed up, and Draco was kissing him again. It was a shock of the best sort all over again, caught up in the hot press of Draco’s lips on his. It was sparking desire all through him.
“What are they doing here? They like misery and whatnot, but hadn’t we cleared them all out after the War?”
There was a hungry look in the flickering silver-grey of Draco’s eyes in the firelight, and Harry couldn’t say no to him. However, it was also around then Harry decided this could actually be a bit of fun.
“That’s not really my problem, is it? It’s entirely none of your concern who I decide to fuck. Now take your ridiculous fucking tantrum elsewhere.”
After prodding cautiously at an elaborate serving bowl full of something yellow, and tar-like in consistency, Harry settled instead on wandering occasionally by the tables to steal an olive or two. They were at least something he recognised as a type of food.
Minerva stopped to give him a hug, asking after Ginny, Ron and Hermione as well. He’d also walked by Neville—but as he was clearly busy chatting up Hannah, Harry had decided not to interrupt.
He looked quite vulnerable there in the clouded-over moonlight flooding in through the atrium’s glass—vulnerable in a way he hadn’t been before, even when he was arse-up for Harry and about to come. This was very different—and it was twisting something up in Harry’s chest he was far too intoxicated to reign in or deny.
Draco pulled open one of the old wooden drawers on his desk, and took from it a small rectangular blackboard, no bigger than a textbook, but obviously much slimmer.
have the time to do them after we’ve got back. Once we’re done with them, of course then we’ll need to practise the wards and—”
Harry didn’t think that was right. After all—he had his head now, enough to know how quickly he would need to sort out explaining away where he had fucked off to since lunch.
Harry thanked her for the information, and thanked her again for her discretion in not telling anyone she had seen him before he made his way back out into the city again.
