He gave her a warm smile in return and nodded his head.
Harry bent down further and carefully cupped Tulip’s hands in his. “Thank you, truly.”
Olympe chuckled at Minerva’s loss of professional tact.  “So you have experience with this as well?”  The witch smirked into her tea before continuing.  “His heart is in the right place, but they’ve set him up to fail.  That boy knows nothing of struggle and it shows.”
“Give me a moment.” Neville grabbed a couple pieces of parchment from his bag and proceeded reach for the platter of sausage rolls on the table. “Do you want one or two?”
I give the biggest shoutout to MiladyMorningstar for giving me the beautiful gift of short king Radomir Nikiforov who is a delight to write.  I owe her my life for this precious gem.
His eyes aimlessly wandered the Great Hall.  There was a clench in his gut when he accidentally made eye contact with Professor McGonagall.  The witch paled and her lip trembled as she returned his gaze.  His stomach dropped as the sensation of pins and needles pricked all over his skin. He shuddered and broke eye contact first.
“However, I must ask you to notify the Ministry on my behalf that this will be the last Triwizard Tournament Hogwarts will participate in for as long as I am headmistress.”
For fuck’s sake, he fucking
Soon after, the school heads said their goodbyes. Olympe gathered her things and left with a joyous “ta ta.” Minerva and Radomir were alone together once more.
Percy looked to Minister Shacklebolt in panic.  This was escalating quickly.  The dark skinned man signaled his secretary with a reassuring hand.  He’d strategized and fought alongside the witch in the Order of the Phoenix.  She could handle herself just fine.
Kingsley Shacklebolt leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.  He released an exhausted sigh. “I’m so sorry Minerva.  I’ve tried everything but they’ve got the Wizengamot wrapped around their finger. They’ve overruled me every time I’ve objected and requested a re-vote. I’m afraid we’ve ran out of options.”
Ron’s protective scowl deepened.  “I mean it Harry. ‘Mione comes in my bed all the time.”
“Ugh, my ears!” Ginny cried as she massaged her temples in a poor attempt to exorcise the scarring mental images from her head.
Ginny dug her toes into the sand and twirled at a blade of grass with her fingers. “Are Ron and Hermione still in Hogsmeade?”
She paused to give herself enough time to breathe and to keep her tone calm and even as she replied.  “Alright. I guess I will have to give my blessing, much to my chagrin.”
Ron wiped away Hermione’s tears away with his thumb and gave her soft comforting kiss on the cheek before sending her away, most likely to get some sleep.  Guilt wrapped around Harry and strangled him like the tentacle-like vines of a Devil’s Snare.
Percy flicked his eyes back up to meet Minerva’s, his voice solemn and apologetic.  “Thank you Headmistress.”
He gave the nervous elf a reassuring smile. “It’s more than adequate. Thank you, Tulip.”
The harsh slam of the Great Hall doors crackled through the tense atmosphere.
Minerva gave her former student a silent nod of her head and watched as the ginger man walked towards the door of her office.  Apprehensive fingers drummed against the rich mahogany as he paused and tentatively turned back around.  “Headmistress?”
Ron exhaled a long relieved breath which turned into a soft whispered, “Good man.” The ginger wizard tapped on his chin in thought. “Make it three.” He deserved it after all the shite Harry had been putting them through.
So I'm still figuring out how I should warn and tag as I go and I just want to throw it out there that this chapter deals with dissociation and panic attacks if that isn't your thing.
An elbow gently pressed against Minerva’s arm as Radomir murmured, “So that’s what it’s called in English, eh?”  It took all of Minerva’s self-restraint to not combust as Radomir wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Amazing, ain’t it?” Harry beamed at the equally mystified voice of his best friend.
“Yes Mr. Weasley?”
His tears trickled hotly down to his temples as the door closed with a gentle click.  Harry wiped his eyes and maneuvered to his side.  His regret and fatigue merged into quiet sobbing as he curled into fetal position and eventually cried himself into dreamless slumber.
Ginny’s voice was raspy as she coughed out, “Merlin’s saggy ballsack, Ron!” The witch paused to wipe stray droplets of pumpkin juice from her mouth. “Warn a girl before you start talking about your sex life at breakfast!”
“Y-yeah. Just tired.”  Harry ignored Ron’s penetrating gaze and the guilt forming in his belly. He looked shamefully down at the table and reluctantly grabbed a piece of toast.
Minerva raised a stern brow.  “With all due respect Mr. Dujardin, being so obtuse will not guarantee you a long career in politics.”
“Of course.” Minerva’s knuckles turned white around the handle of her floral teacup.
“Eh, I try.” Radomir winked at both witches before dropping Olympe’s hand and lifting his head in a hearty laugh.
In retrospect, Albus had no issue sitting back and allowing his students to be used as pawns in the games of war much larger than themselves.  His gentle demeanor and wisdom hidden in riddled quirks allowed him to shape and mold the people beneficial to his cause like a master potter.  The realisation that there were times where Minerva was one of them was sour, much like the lemon drops the man coveted. However, unlike the candy, there was no sweet aftertaste to soothe her.  Still, despite her conflicting anger, Minerva could not deny Albus was a natural leader.  He was an unmovable mountain and stood rigid in his ideas.  Nothing could shake the man and she envied him for it.  There was no going back as far as the tournament was concerned.  Every time she mentioned it and thought about the students at risk she felt like she would crumble.  It only felt like she could keep upright for their sake.
As he trudged back to his room, it became harder and harder to ignore the neglect from weeks—no, probably months worth of insomnia and the anxiety and depression that tagged along for the ride.
Harry couldn’t fight the bright smile that stretched across his face as the first years filed in for the Sorting Hat ceremony.  He whooped and cheered for every house, even Slytherin which had a surprisingly large amount of new students all things considered.  After the past few years, house rivalries could wait for quidditch season.  Professor McGonagall had emphasized the importance of unity in her welcoming speech and he was all for it.
And Draco swallowed it all down, just as Harry had.
Harry grabbed his bag, the other half of his sandwich, and took them outside.
Mrs Malfoy made an amused sort of sound—not quite a snort. Something softer. 'Don't think I don't know you've desired Harry's friendship before you'd even met.'
been the sort of person to have a clean, minimalist flat before. Or at least something far more expensive-looking. Maybe he’d been pretending to be that sort of person back then, or maybe Malfoy might’ve thought he’d been that person himself. He’d always seemed to care too much about how everyone saw him, and … and probably his parents would been overbearing about the way things were “supposed” to be.
Draco smiled a little, up at the ceiling. ‘I suppose so.’
Draco spun around, to find Potter racing over to him, nudging past fellow students as they walked the halls to their classes.
“Sorry—”
Groaning, Draco crawled his way up Harry's body and collapsed over half of him, with his face pressed up against Harry's cheek.
Astoria moved closer to him, and lay her head down on his chest. “Harry’s a good man.”
Draco frowned. There it was again—computers. Were they really so bloody important? Civilisation had survived a very long time without them.
“I don’t suspect you,” Harry said breathily. “Of anything. I really don’t.”
And then he noticed little Rose, in turtle pyjamas, curled-up sleeping on a blue blanket laid over two seats—with her mouth hanging slightly open, and small fingers bunching up the blanket in a fist.
‘He’d pop back and forth between there and his flat. But he was at the house more often than not.’
Harry arched up a bit. 'That … feels good,' he panted out.
Draco narrowed his eyes and sighed. “
‘It’s over,’ Harry exhaled.
“Dear Draco and Astoria,” Draco mumbled. Okay, that in itself was weird. He and Potter didn’t call each other by their given names. Granted: it’d be just as weird to write ‘Dear Malfoy and Astoria’, or, ‘Dear Malfoy and Malfoy’. “Congratulations on your union of souls.” Draco made a face.
Shaking his head, Draco’s immediate response was, “No.”
He Floo-called Draco’s flat, and his heartrate sped up. In a good way. Not in a frightened way … more of a … hopeful way. Excited way.
‘I’ve got this book, you see. It’s a Muggle one,’ Neville began. ‘So, supposedly, for Muggles, certain flowers have symbolic meanings to them when they’re gift-giving. And I thought you might like to hear what your flower represents, that is ... in case your admirer was sending a message?’
Yes, that was a vagina. A normal, womanly vagina.
Harry spluttered and choked a bit as Draco thrust a bit far.
‘Of course.’ Pansy smiled, taking Morgan’s arm, and stalking off.
Draco pushed himself up, and crawled up a fraction to lean over Harry, with hair in absolute disarray. Harry lifted his fingers up to run through the soft, slighty-frizzy strands.
. The man whose ‘Potter Stinks’ badge you’ve kept in your trunk all these years for some reason.” Hermione sighed. “Oh my God, Harry. You’ve fancied him longer than you’ve realised, haven’t you?” she asked dryly.
He let them hug him, before Harry said, ‘Let’s get on the train.’ He’d had just about enough of feeling everyone’s eyes on him.
“To be honest, I think Ron and I have both sensed a distance forming there, between you two. And at the end of the day, it’s up to the both of you if you want to try to get back what you used to have … whether that’s through a series of long, difficult, honest conversations ... or whether it's with couples' counselling, or some other way. Or, you could take some time apart, maybe even break up, if that’s what you decide is best. And if that is what happens, Ron and I are going to support you, you know that, don’t you?”
Then, Draco was off. Harry’s mind clicked in to gear, it was time to move. He raced towards where Draco seemed to be aiming for. Harry was far, but, he might be able to catch up. Then Draco took a sharp turn, and Harry leaned into his broom, putting all he had into it—but then, in a flash, Draco was waving the Snitch in the air.
‘Did you have a good time last night?’ asked Hermione.
The water pushed Potter into him. Draco’s fingertips collided with Potter’s side. Potter took hold of Draco’s wrist and tugged at him—like he wanted his attention.
Merlin, she could put up an argument. And, against all better judgment, Draco found himself saying, “Fine.”
They’d broken up, he thought she’d understood that. He wasn’t ready. He didn’t—He didn’t
Flitwick handed Draco his information folder. “Here you are, Mr Malfoy.”
Harry was furious now; his blood was pumping. He grabbed a quill to scribble a response.
wear each other’s clothes.
'Yes.'
The two of them looked up. Merlin, they were a wonderful, beautiful family. He loved them so fucking much.
occurred to him, yes. He’d even spoken to his Mind Healer about it. But, ultimately, it was probably wiser to focus on his mental health first, and put everything else on the backburner.
“Harry!”
Rose Granger-Weasley was probably Harry’s most favourite person in the world.
Well. No one would really know. The curtains were drawn, and he’d try not to stomp around.
'Yes,' Draco said, wide-eyed and breathy.
?’ Draco asked, aghast.
'Draco,' Harry whined out, as the pleasure built and built and built. Fucking hell. 'Draco, I think—' His orgasm surprised him, rippling out his body, shooting in white hot bursts against Draco's hand and the shower wall.
“I’d be afraid to be a father … in case I’d turn out anything like mine,” Malfoy said quietly, pushing his dish away from him.
Malfoy eyed the glass.
Muffled, against Harry's lips, Draco asked, 'Are you trying to seduce me again?'
‘If you don’t know the answers, I certainly don’t,’ Harry said, smiling.
“Buona sera!” A waiter approached with two clear bottles in hand. “Gas or no gas?”
Frowning slightly, Draco didn’t say anything for a moment, as he stared straight out into the night. ‘I can learn from it, I s’pose.’
… happy.
Then Mulan became determined all of a sudden, and the music changed and Draco just watched it all with wide eyes.
She pulled him towards the dancefloor, where so many bodies were grinding and dancing along. June, Beth and Nancy trailed after them.
Malfoy scoffed.
Draco bit back a groan. This was going to be awful.
Harry just looked at Draco in disbelief for a moment, shaking his head. Then he took one more sweeping look around the kitchen before announcing, ‘I’m going to my house.’
?” He watched Harry expectantly.
“Let go of me!”
‘And your social life?’ Draco asked, taking another dumpling.
‘Why not here?’ Draco shrugged, going for nonchalant and hoping Potter would just accept it.
over to Draco. It was a bit ridiculous really, and Draco thought he might even tell him so.
“Do you … forgive me?” Malfoy asked, more hesitantly.
It was … not what Harry expected. ‘Oh this is
. Just … just what on earth did Harry Potter
‘Oh, good,’ Harry breathed out.
'Thank you for telling me.' Still with that same enigmatic smile … Harry couldn't tell what she was thinking.
” before leaning in to snog Harry absolutely senseless.
Malfoy was scandalized, struggling against Harry’s vice-like grip. ‘Potter, I swear—’
‘He’s a
“Oh. I don’t know.” The easy way they spoke, the easy way Harry would smile at him. It made his chest ache just thinking of it. He wasn’t sure he liked the feeling. It felt heavy, it felt ... like it was almost too much for him.
A slight frown.
‘Leave it! It’s messier than
The man glowered.
'We can set up video calls for meetings. You could Portkey in once and a while for fundraisers and galas and whatnot. But it's
me to be in love with you?’
He thrust faster and harder.
Trying to repress a smile, Harry leaned in, and kissed him some more.
“Ah—er, I … suppose I could.”
‘Oh. I’d like it.’
“You still have things to offer to world, you’re a fucking genius with everything at school—if you just focus on one thing you’re interested in—who even knows what you can accomplish. And that’s
Draco groaned. ‘Harry …'
‘Your life wasn’t really yours, for so many years,’ Draco said quietly. ‘You had an impossible weight on your shoulders, impossible tasks. And … terrible losses.’ He took a breath. ‘So you wanted to live in Spain … that’s your fucking prerogative, and sod their opinions.
Hermione and Harry made eye contact, she smiled at him—a smile that said she’d kept his secret. He tried to smile his appreciation back.
A package dropped down in front of the girl, which she excitedly ripped open to reveal a box of chocolates—probably sent by her mum. Lila waved the box around in front of her friends’ faces, before opening it up, and passing them around to share. Harry smiled a little wistfully.
It took a long while to get around to Draco.
He wasn’t going to last.
One of the bottles very clearly had a photo of a mango on it, so he pulled that one out to try. On top of the fridge were some packaged items—probably crisps and crackers and the like. Harry picked up a package of something that’d been already opened, and took them over to the desk to sit, pushing some papers aside so he could set his things down.
Harry smiled, and said softly, ‘Thank you.’ He folded the paper up, and shoved it into his jean pocket.
‘It’s brilliant, isn’t it?’ asked Ginny, leaning forward and looking at each of their faces in turn. ‘Who wants to start a pool, betting on how long before they’re dating?’
'Mmhmm. Please.'
And maybe Malfoy
‘As you can see, he is quite fit and I’m very lucky.’
Harry winced even bigger. 'Lord, no … Unless … Fuck, it'd help draw attention to your charity, wouldn't it?'
So, he left the bathroom, with only a towel wrapped around his waist, and headed straight for his drawer.
“Yeah, I especially like the part about your arse.”
“Beg pardon?” Draco asked, a bit annoyed at his fantasy being shut down so quickly. He turned to Potter then, and caught the stern expression on the man’s face, his unfocussed eyes looking outwards, unseeing.
A pause. Harry waited with bated breath.
actually leave Minerva’s office.”
‘I didn’t want to see it again. That’s all.’ He was shaking. Merlin. He’d admitted it. And he was shaking now. Great.
‘Do you want to sleep in my bed tonight?’ Draco asked, studying him.
‘Ugh, fine.’ She stood up straighter. ‘But I’m here if you want to talk.’
Draco Malfoy had been commanded to kill Dumbledore. By knowing this, by telling Dumbledore, it was supposed to have prevented it. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t fair.
'This is very good,' said Draco, breaking off another piece of it with the side of his fork.
Draco sighed deep, and stabbed a few pieces of lettuce, and put them into his mouth. They tasted flavourless now, though it was likely no fault of the cook.
Harry glared at the pimply man. ‘No, seriously, what was that?’ The Gryffindor boy squirmed, trying to get out of Harry’s strong grip on his robes.
His friends exchanged a hesitant look with each other.
on the side, along with a little palm tree.
Harry placed the parchment down.
Harry was just staring at him, bewildered. And yes, it was rather mental.
for Harry too, back then.
(he guessed—he didn’t know much about alpacas, whether they were anything like a herd of sheep—he could look it up in the library later).
Harry came shortly afterwards—surprising himself that he even
He sighed and looked around, rubbing absently at the centre of his chest. Luckily, he spotted Pansy and Blaise at a four-person table. He made his way over to sit with them.
Harry shrugged again, sauntering over closer. Malfoy just eyed him warily.
He squeezed his eyes shut, took a breath, and then turned to face her. ‘I don’t think so.’
That old timey night shirt, Harry thought fondly. He came up next to Draco. ‘Hi.’
In, and out.
He pushed himself up onto his knees, book in hand, and chanced a glance at Potter. Potter met his eyes, and smiled a little. Merlin, help him.
Harry’s mouth was Draco’s favourite thing. Well, all of him was, actually.
Harry stopped moving and stared at Draco. No one had ever asked him that before. It really hadn’t been possible to travel before, what with Voldemort and all. But now … ‘Yes. I’d really love that.’
Malfoy stared at him for a beat. ‘I guess I should … go back …'
“Ugh!” Malfoy uttered. “You’re driving me mental.” He turned away, like he couldn’t stand to look at Harry a second longer, and stormed away.
He smiled, and went back to Potter’s video.
Harry shrugged. “I guess they’ve stayed friends after Hogwarts.” Apparently they'd somehow bonded from Luna being imprisoned in Malfoy Manor, but Harry thought better than to mention that out loud.
A small smile grew on Draco’s face. ‘Yeah. We’re good.’ He licked at his bottom lip. ‘And I’m sorry. That was immature of me, I shouldn’t have just avoided you.’
‘I’ll get you a glass,’ Harry said, not waiting for an answer.
Potter sauntered off, leaving the room in silence once more. Draco sat still for a while. That had been nice of Potter. It was nice to be invited. The idea of stepping into that room, though, and seeing everyone’s face fall or twist into anger, hearing everyone’s conversations immediately stop—no thank you.
Draco pinched his mouth shut and stared at Potter, who stared back at him with eyes flashing.
Let me preface this with a few notes:
Draco’s eyebrows raised. “Oh. I wasn’t aware...”
‘I wish I had a camera with me.'
She raised an eyebrow. 'In your work trousers and a button-down?'
Draco seemed to be stunned into silence. He looked out in the distance, wide-eyed. After a moment, he mumbled, “We would’ve been in the same dorm room.”
‘What?’ Draco said, finding his voice.
‘Mm,’ Potter hummed. ‘I wonder what they could be like.’
Radomir hummed and rubbed his muttonchops.  “I might need to speak to him.”
Minerva’s veins trickled with ice cold rage.  “I’m well aware, but this is barbaric and I can’t with a good conscious stand by and simply allow the lives of my students to be used as a pawn for political gain.  They’ve been through enough and I stand firmly by that.” The man’s beard shook violently as he spluttered in outrage.
He finished and went to the sink to wash his hands.  Harry grimaced again as he became aware of the dry sandy desert that was his mouth.  He bent down towards the basin and splashed cool water against his flushed face before cupping his hands and drinking deeply.
Olympe hummed glumly in agreement.  “Had I known the circumstances, I would have said no.”
The constant saccharine poetics written about their relationship made both of them nauseas.  They were two teenagers trying to figure out how to be “normal” as two celebrity war heros in a post-war world and dealing with trauma along the way.  In the end, their coping mechanisms was what brought the end to their romantic relationship.  Ginny threw herself into quidditch and family while Harry threw himself into following the trials and rebuilding Hogwarts.  The passion that kept them both alive during the war fizzled out and replaced itself with a deep platonic love for one another.  They were each other’s first love and for that, there would always be a deep fondness.
The former colleagues were interrupted as the fireplace came to life with a flash of green flame.  Percy stepped out onto the hearth, his hands wringing erratically.  He cleared his throat.  “I regret to inform you that our… guests are running behind and will be here shortly.”
Harry closed the curtains with a bitter huff and laid back down on the bed. He folded his arms behind his head and stared at the sea of velvet crimson above him. A gentle puff of air escaped his lips as he counted the rhythm of his breath in his head.  He closed his eyes with trepidation and forced himself to try to go back to sleep.
“I’m sorry Headmistress, our hands are tied.”  Percy Weasley tangled his fingers anxiously in his lap.  It took all his courage to maintain eye contact with the steely glare of his former Head of House. “The Department of Magical Games only recently came forward with the plans The Department of International Magical Cooperation have been working on in secret for the past year.”
Harry’s shoulders tensed as each step caused a rumbling roar to echo through the empty halls, a trail of angry mutterings from the portraits stirred by the noise left in his wake.  Once he was in a better state of mind, he’d have to ask Luna how to turn off that feature.
Harry’s body continued to convulse in despair.  They had almost lost each other so many times along the way, yet there was no guarantee that still couldn’t happen.  Anxiety, sorrow, and rage wove together in his body.  He hugged Hermione even tighter and felt the shorter witch’s muscles flex as she tried not to buckle beneath his weight. She matched his anguished cries with subtle painful sobs of her own.
Harry awoke with a shiver.  He groaned as he forced his numb arm from underneath his head.  He began to shake awake the crushed limb, another pained groan escaping his lips as the feeling of pins and needles pricked hotly beneath his skin.  The dark velvet ceiling of his bed curtain spun like a whirlpool as he moved onto his back and came back into his body.  Harry counted to ten and prayed to his body to let his nausea cease before he weakly tried to sit up.  He closed his eyes again as the world began to swirl once more.  Had it not been for his screaming bladder, he could have easily fallen back asleep.
Malfoy didn’t say anything, he just looked at all the mismatched envelopes arranged in front him. Different colours. Different sizes.
And suddenly Draco was thinking about masturbation. Thinking about Harry masturbating.
He gasped, there was a dark human-sized lump on the bed. It rolled over.
He realised he was squeezing his hands into fists, tight enough to be uncomfortable.
‘Harry,
Then Seamus pulled Harry into a huge hug from behind, forcing an, ‘Oof,’ out of him, while dragging Harry back in to the crowd. Everyone wanted to talk all at once.
Draco nodded, and got up to go fish around in his bag.
Harry laughed, low in his chest. “Yeah. I think so.”
He looked sad. And blotchy from tears. But he was looking at Draco, and his eyes dropped to Draco's hands.
. Yes, he was ridiculous.
‘You didn’t think we’d notice?’ Hermione asked, raising her eyebrows and leaning forward.
'Well … went to the circus didn't I.'
Harry went back to his empty flat after work, and stood in the kitchen, looking out the window. It was dark so early these days, but the light layer of snow on the ground reflected the street lights. It seemed so still out there. Not a lot of people wanting to brave the snow tonight, he figured.
Harry stood at the glass door, looking out into the snow, into the tree line in the distance, and the stars shining above.
A big white swan drifted past them at leisurely pace. It seemed altogether relaxed.
And Draco didn’t want to have to be the one to ask... to ask whether that’d been pity because of Draco’s scars, or if maybe Harry was still a little drunk from last night, or if Harry had planned that at all or if he’d just felt like it in a spur-of-the-moment thing. Or to ask how it was—how it’d felt (had that been good?), or what that was all for, or had Harry forgotten who Draco was for a moment. Or if perhaps he did that all the time, he kissed his friends... and to him it wasn’t a particularly special act.
Draco helped by holding his cock straight up, as Harry lowered himself down on it. That first brush of cockhead against arsehole was heaven. Harry kept pushing down, as Draco bit at his lip—watching Harry's face.
Draco slowly opened the drawer, careful to not make too much sound.
He licked his lips, as he thought back to the beginning of it. ‘He’d been a bit obsessed with me as a child, I guess. Thought we’d become friends.’
'What does that—'
So they hit up a Tesco on their way home. Draco still looked flawless in fluorescent lighting, Harry noted. That skin, that impossibly light hair … Okay, he needed to put the brakes on those thoughts.
Malfoy faltered again, staring at Harry. Then, he blinked rapidly. “Answer the question.”
Well. Might as well see. Explore a bit, as it were. And if there was nothing suitable, he’d forget the idea completely.
“Nice. Congrats.”
“And he’s different after the war—I've seen him … I’ve seen him actually be nice to people. Just the other day he helped a first year get up onto his feet after he tripped …"
‘Gryffindors,’ Draco muttered, but not unkindly.
‘You don’t mean—’
“I like...” Harry started, trailing off so quickly, while he shoved an arm through a sleeve himself.
—Merlin, why was he thinking of him now? Draco frowned.
‘My …
Harry smiled. He felt he could smile, then. Hermione was stable. That was good.
He looked around. The beach was a private, little horseshoe of small pebbles surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs on all sides. The water was relatively still, slowly lapping at the shore in gentle waves.
Oh, fuck.
Draco nodded and handed it over. “Not a problem. Well... I’ll just be off.”
Harry inhaled slowly, and opened it up to the front page.
With a deep breath, he closed the journal, and returned to his essay, feeling a little bit lighter.
anymore. With Voldemort dead, the Death Eaters dismantled, his family broken, and his old beliefs out the window—what was left? Well, studying, he supposed. That was all he did now. That and sleep.
Malfoy nodded, and looked back at the screen, frowning a little.
Harry cleared his throat, and stared very intently at the road. 'I thought you might like to know all that.'
And Harry smelled... he smelled like Harry. Like warmth.
The pad of Draco's index finger circled and pushed at the hole like a button.
Harry climbed over top Draco, with knees on either side of his torso.
Malfoy set down his cleaning kit, and went to work moving all the trash to the actual trash bin.
His heart was proper pounding by then. Maybe it was a mistake to come.
‘Draco, I have to confess something … You’re not going to like it at first, but, hear me out, please?’ She flashed him her best doe-eyed look.
He pulled out a trolley, and indicated for Draco to push it.
A huge, burly, tattooed man came out to Harry. He eyed the poster in front of Harry. ‘This one?’ he grunted, pointing at the Gyfu.
Truthfully, it was answers that he wanted. Needed. Answers that only Draco himself could provide.
‘Tell me about the places you’ve been to.’
Where had his confidence gone? He used to just swagger up to people. Well... that’d been a bit of a façade, hadn’t it? He’d been a poor imitation of his father.
Harry bit at his bottom lip with an incisor. “Ah …" he began, fumbling around in his coat pocket. “There was a part two to this. But I understand if you’d rather go back to Hogwarts.”
Harry shook his head.
‘Save it. I don’t need you to compliment me or tell me I deserve better.’
Harry could only nod.
Draco turned just his face to look at Harry—his eyes dark grey, and wide-open, raking over Harry’s face snuggled into that pillow. Draco’s expression softened, and he blinked slowly. It was a look Harry wished he could capture somehow. Like in a photograph.
-ed, and tossed about, before being scooped up and carried back to the castle in a sniveling Hagrid’s arms.
Harry felt his friends' eyes on him as he approached the Hufflepuff table. Draco was there, with his head supported by a fist, while the other hand pushed scrambled eggs around his plate. Harry slipped in across from him, in between Charlotte and Pansy’s girlfriend Becca.
The secret desire was him, just him.
‘Well, yeah. I’m here … in Ibiza,’ he said lamely, and worried his bottom lip. ‘And I … came to listen to some music …' Potter was not going to believe him. Draco wouldn’t believe himself.
. He groaned, and swiped his free hand over his face. ‘Fourth year.’ He winced.
Minerva felt the crack in her stony façade. None of this was fair, none of this was right. “The Ministry has taken it upon themselves to make sure that cannot happen again.”  Bile flirted at the edge of her esophagus while her soft blue eyes watered with unshed tears.  She couldn’t ignore the crack in her voice as she hammered in the final nail of the coffin.  “Much to my deep gnawing regret, they have ruled that entry for all students seventeen and above is mandatory.” It felt like barbwire was strangling Minerva’s heart as her foundation finally crumbled at the horrified gasp of her students. It was a death rattle to her ears. Tears burned down her cheeks as she finished in a broken whisper.  “I’m sorry that I’ve failed you.”
Neville threw his head back and laughed. “Good to know.”
I don't quite know how I feel about this chapter to be honest (Harry sweetie, I'm so sorry) but I'm going to keep on truckin' because things are going to pick up soon, I promise.
The shorter wizard risked a glance at the door and his stomach dropped to his feet.  Hermione’s face was buried in Ron’s sturdy chest, his pale freckled hands gently combing through the witch’s frayed curls while her petite frame shook from the sobs wracking her body.  Harry wanted the world to swallow him whole.
“Harry?” Hermione’s hand traveled across the table and she softly brushed her fingers across his own in concern.  “Is everything alright?”
Harry woke to Ron’s hand gently shaking his shoulder. “C’mon mate, we’re gonna miss breakfast.” He acknowledged the ginger man with sleepy humph and rose from his bed.  He stumbled out of his pajamas and into his robes in a daze.  His footsteps felt unnaturally heavy as he met up with Ron in the common room.  He quickly blamed it on his disrupted sleep and forced himself to ignore it.
Tuft cleared his throat with a deep harrumph. “Well, finalizing the tournament is quite time consuming.”
He worried his bottom lip with his teeth and gave a deep sigh.  “I truly am sorry about this.”
Ron looked over to see if Hermione was still absorbed in her book before he mouthed, “nightmares?”
The slack in his fatigued body swiftly dissipated at the mention of the Healer.  He began to wrestle out of Hermione’s hold. “No! It’s fine! I’m fine, I just…” Weeks of insomnia and lack of appetite caught up to Harry. He was getting winded and began to slur his words. “Just need to sleep. M’ fine ‘Mione. Really.”
Harry’s breathing became laboured.  He could hear his racing heartbeat in his ears and the world around him was blurring at the edges.  In his panic he lunged for Ginny’s hand beneath the table. She whipped her head to stare at him with wide, concerned eyes.  Her warm chocolate eyes quietly flashed with understanding and gripped his trembling hand in her comforting embrace.  There was a hollow echo weaving itself into McGonagall’s voice as she wedged the final nail in the coffin.
She gave a forlorn smile to the man. “As am I.”
The petite elf turned with a gasp, her periwinkle dress made from what appeared to be an upcycled bed sheet fluttering around her plump frame. “Master Potter!”
“If you so wish, I can guide you towards yours, Olympe.” Minerva arched a knowing brow as the half-giantess’ cheeks gained a rosy hue.
The rest of breakfast was a mechanical affair.  Harry counted his bites of toast and his sips of juice. Anything to avoid the suspicious stares from Ron and the worried glances from Hermione.
Radomir hugged himself for warmth as the thick grey fur of his hat fluttered in the strong breeze.  “Tea sounds divine. Lead the way, Headmistress.”
The headmistress exhaled out of her nose like a dragon as she tried to remain composed.  “Then what was the point of rebuilding the bloody castle and allowing the students back if I’m just going to throw them to the wolves, Kingsley? What was this all for?”  Angry tears pricked at her vision.
Not much was known about the new Durmstrang headmaster on this side of the pond.  Radomir Nikiforov’s background seemed to be enveloped in mystery as was his promotion after the murder of Igor Karkaroff towards the start of the war.
Harry slumped against the table in shame while the sounds of Hermione’s footsteps drew further and further away.  He felt the warmth of Neville’s large palm between his shoulder blades. “Alright, Harry?” He could only grumble in response.  The idea of forming words at that point was exhausting.
It would be naïve to think that from now on Hogwarts would be danger-free, but for the first time since Harry first walked through the mystifying doors at eleven, he felt safe.  There was no dark lord, no prophecy.  It was as freeing as it was intimidating.  He’d been conditioned all his life to brace himself for the next challenge.  Adrenalin and gut instincts were what kept him alive for so long.  To ignore the tingling in his veins at sudden movement, the tensing of his shoulders at the faintest sound, the intense need to check every dark corner twice felt unnatural. Years of battle at such a young age had left their scars on his mind and body, but Harry truly felt like a blank slate. He could finally look towards the future without the incessant need to attach an asterisk of “if.”
While much was the same as the previous tournament, the heads of the guest schools staying with their students on the outskirts of the grounds or anchored on the lake, her and Professor Flitwick had merged some of the abandoned classrooms on the first floor into personal quarters for the visiting headmasters.  Overall, they were quite modest so their guests could personalize their space if they so wished.  They each had a small living space as well as an office with connection to the floo network for the day to day tasks of a school head.  The only difference was the colour palate. Radomir’s quarters were adorned with the rich greys and maroons of Durmstrang while Olympe’s was a vision of the Beauxbatons powdered blue and bright pearly whites the Madame adored.
“Very well.” He gritted his teeth and took another breath. His nostrils flared with growing exasperation.  “My hands are tied, Headmistress.  It would be a shame if we had to bring forth a vote to the Wizengamot because the Head of Hogwarts refused to comply with Ministry rule.  I’m sure we could find another qualified educator that would be more than willing to participate in future tournaments.”
Worried cerulean eyes searched his face as they sat on opposite sides of the Gryffindor table.  “You alright, Harry?”
“Y-yes.” Percy looked shamefully at his lap. “Unfortunately it seems that way, yes.”
Tuft barged in to the conversation, his face growing ruddy with frustration. “To be frank Headmistress, you and the former Headmaster know more than anyone, that this is fairer. The results won’t be tampered with.”
How do you even begin to apologize for months of neglect and bullheaded stubbornness?
There was a sturdy weight pressing into Harry’s side as Ron stretched his freckled scarred arms to envelope the two.  The taller wizard’s modest sniffles were muffled by Harry’s black curls.
Radomir hummed in agreement.  “Naivety and privilege can be a dangerous combination.”
Minerva couldn’t help but feel charmed by the boyish grin on the stern looking man’s face as he talked about his upbringing. “Very well.”
“—Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah… I know, you prick.” Ron pinched the bridge of his nose and huffed, his other hand tiredly sliding down the door frame with a pitiful squeak as Neville looked between the two with worried eyes. “Look, Harry—just… Just try to get some sleep and apologize to us later. Yeah?”
The Hogwarts headmistress refused to rise to her colleague’s insinuating bait despite the delicate flush brushing across her cheeks.  “Of course.  While I detest the circumstances, I would be remiss if I did not try to be a good host regardless."
She folded her hands in her lap.  “Though I must say, I’m surprised I didn’t see you cast a warming charm.”
Minerva forced a half smile and shook her head.  “Forgive me. My mind was elsewhere.”
A blush bloomed on Tulip’s olive face and she curtsied at the compliment. “Tulip will leave Harry be. Do not hesitate to call for Tulip if you need anything.”
The headmistress huffed before taking her glasses off and folding the delicate golden wire frames and placing them on the edge of her desk.  “Very well.” A humorless chuckle left her lips.  “Then I guess my hands are tied also.”
Ever since the Welcoming Feast, he forced himself to acknowledge his instinct that the year could go south at any moment.  Naïve hope had settled into resigned anticipation.
“Good,” Ron said with an affirmative nod of his head.  He looked up at Neville. “You heard the man. Ready when you are, Nev.”
They answered the witch with soft matching smiles.
He gave the witch a long meaningful look.  “I wish I could answer that.”
The elf nodded eagerly.
When that didn't work, he crawled to the side of his bed and pushed away his bed curtains so he could stare out the window.  Harry sighed. Dawn was quickly approaching. The faint light gave hint that the rich green of summer was slowly exchanging hands with autumn as trees became mottled with red, orange, and yellow.  In any other year, the changing of seasons would have brought him a sense of delight.  Even in his darkest times, where the threat of danger loomed, he could find a sense of celebration since there were feasts and holidays to look forward to.  However, as September shifted to early October, Harry could only feel dread.  Each day was just another day counting down towards the hellish circus of the Triwizard Tournament.  Each night was a promise that his nightmares would become more descriptive and violent, more real.  It made him ill just thinking about it.
She laid her head on the wizard’s shoulder and they fell into comfortable silence.
“No thank you, I’m--” Harry paused. One of the major Weasley love languages was food. It in no way would make up for months of him being an insufferable arsehole but he had to start somewhere.  “Actually, Tulip, would you be able to send some pastries and a pot of tea to the Gryffindor commons room?”
Minerva placed her tea on the table and folded her arms over the tall arm of her chair to turn towards Olympe.  “Mr. Dujardin was a student of yours, correct?”
Why on earth would Potter...
“¡Babosa! ¡Babosa! ¡Babosa!” people chanted, waving their puke-yellow and green flags.
Harry shook his head. 'It's fine. I want to hang out with you.'
He removed the hands from his face, and furrowed his brow. 'That's … kind of you.'
Success! ‘Yes! Consider it!’
'Oh!' Harry exclaimed, watching—
People pushed past them to get into the aisles and out. But Harry sensed Malfoy was gearing up to say something—so, he waited. And tried to act and breathe normally, as he fiddled with his hands.
Merlin's—
It kept spinning for what felt like an eternity.
'What are you doing with it?'
Sodding owls. Why couldn’t the wizarding world adopt Muggle means of communication? Owls made everything need to be so urgent. One had to stop everything they were doing to open a window (regardless of weather), give an owl a treat, sometimes write a reply immediately …
Draco’s expression became more serious. ‘I should apologise for last night … I’d heard you and …
His grin fell. “What?”
Harry took one look at Ron and Ginny with their arms around a crying Molly, looked at Hermione and Arthur staring blankly into the fire, before turning to Draco.
Harry laughed. 'Oh so you're a food blogger now.'
‘Please,’ Harry groaned again, pressing his arse back into Draco’s mouth. He needed more pressure, more …
Harry looked at Draco’s face in awe. This was so much better than he’d dared to hope. ‘Can I kiss you now?’
The waiting room door opened, and Ron, letting out a tired breath, stepped inside. Every set of eyes turned to him.
.” His softened cock touched Draco’s shoulder.
“Er, what?”
‘What’s in it for
So Draco reached for Harry's hips, the loose cotton t-shirt over firm muscle there.
Percy cleared his throat nervously.  "Of course."  He cast a quick Tempus and sighed.  “I must get going.”
“The one and only.” She gave him a playful wink.  One arm was on her hip while the other was relaxed against her side, her hand clinging loosely to her brown leather sandals.  She gestured to the empty spot on Harry’s left.  “May I?”
“I must say, Headmaster Nikiforov, I most certainly picked an unfortunate day for you to tour the grounds.”
Back in the warmth and privacy of Minerva’s office, they stripped off their outer layers.  The witch observed as the wizard continued to unwind an unending trail of scarves off his bulky frame.  It reminded her of the displays of muggle magicians that Professor Burbage described to her after her hiring in 1993.  There was a multicolored bundle of wool at his feet as he finally finished the job at hand before removing his traditional Durmstrang ushanka and placing it on the hook next to her hat.  Upswept fiery red hair replaced dull grey.  Despite the layering, his large crooked nose was a bright cherry red from the bitter cold.  His thick salt and paprika mutton chops connected on his face with an equally thick billowing moustache. He was no taller than five foot four but walked with the stride and confidence of a man twice his size to one of the plush tartan arm chairs she’d transfigured for this sudden yet casual meeting of the school heads.
Ron was embraced in Hermione’s much smaller arms on the plush crimson sofa in front of the fire, her petite front melding into the much taller wizard’s back.  The witch’s chin was hooked on Ron’s broad shoulder as the two lovers slept peacefully.  Harry’s fingers itched to comb back Hermione’s halo of brown curls but he didn’t want to disturb their slumber.  They deserved their rest.  The guilt was trying to crawl back into his system as Harry grabbed a nearby cream afghan and draped it over the two before he left for the kitchens as quiet as a whisper.
Minerva stared at the grinning man blankly for a moment as she tried to regain composure. “Ah, fair enough.”
“Have you now?” Minerva made the mistake of looking back towards Olympe.  The witch’s arched eyebrow was raised in coy investigation, her scarlet lips forming a mischievous smirk.
Minerva and Kingsley shared a silent look. The witch’s body thrummed with anger as she gingerly placed her cup on her desk.  She slid her wire glasses back in place before folding her hands on the desk.  “As you must know, I fought in the war as a member of the Order of the Phoenix.  I refuse to be intimidated, Mr. Tuft.  My decision stands firm.”  She cast a wandless Tempus charm and gave the group of men in her office a pointed look.  Her tone was terse and straightforward. “Now if you excuse me, gentlemen, I have lessons to prepare for.  Good day.”
Harry felt a blush heat his cheeks. ‘It isn’t ...’
‘What stuff?’
, hope you never have to go through anything even close to that, ever again.’
People milled about again, with soft pop music playing from the wireless, and plump cushions arranged around the floor for sitting. The warm, golden room still smelled of cinnamon. Harry really liked Hufflepuff—it had to be his second favourite house, he thought.
‘I didn’t, not really. But I was in touch with his family. They wanted to do something to … well, keep his memory alive.’
“Just ‘no’? We could at least take a look, maybe there’s a hot tub or a sauna or something.”
Draco grimaced. “A dog-lover.”
‘Oh, I’ve known we were over. It took a little while for it to sink in, but it did. Sink in.’ She smiled at him warmly, crinkling her eyes small. ‘I just want you to be happy.’
Malfoy bit at his lip, and pushed.
‘Of course not, why would we?’
Harry’s face felt hot all of a sudden.
“Hmm, black jeans and black jumper... Maybe a... white t-shirt? Yes. We’ll go with colourless, and maximum contrast,” Pansy said, as if to herself, as she rifled through Draco’s clothes some more. She found what she was looking for, and tossed the white shirt over. Draco caught it in one hand, keeping hold of Potter’s hoodie with the other. “Alright,” she said, standing up. “Put them on.”
“No I’m sure I
been a bit mad, Portkeying directly into the entrance of a civilian war victims' hospital. His smile fell. ‘When I arrived, there was a woman being wheeled in, with blood on her face.’
Draco moaned, grabbed onto Harry's thighs, and came hard inside of Harry.
Draco pinched his mouth tight.
‘Okay.’
'Just come here and kiss me,' Draco said, with wide, unblinking eyes and a slightly-parted mouth.
Draco made a hum of acknowledgment.
'And now? While you aren't at one of my fundraisers or my place of business?'
‘Wow, you’re really sensitive.’
“We should turn back,” Draco said, stopping in his tracks to look at the underside of his shoes.
The other, gentler, voice in his head told him it wasn’t his fault. The Half-blood Prince had written that note in the textbook, aside the words ‘
'Evan,' came in response. Draco echoed it, just a beat late.
Harry cleared his throat, and distracted himself by stepping farther into the room and looking around instead. “You have time,” Harry reminded him, as he stared at a bookshelf, overflowing with books. They looked to all be about Potions theory and references for ingredients, of course. He cast a quick Tempus.
Harry’s blood ran cold, all the hairs stood up on his arms. In an instant, his wand pointed towards the sound. A mutilated, half-formed ghost—barely human-looking—hovered in the Astronomy Tower doorway, just floating in the air. Its mouth, or approximation of a mouth, wide open and gaping and emitting the eeriest of shrieks.
While he waited for Dave and Harry to finish their hug, he sipped from his Amante Passion. Delicious, but he found he felt a bit too miserable to properly enjoy it.
“Hi,” Harry said quietly.
Harry’s smile widened. “I... Well, last night. Just seeing you in my hoodie...”
Harry kept blinking back at the man. God, he probably looked so clueless. But … ‘But you refused to kiss me.’
“All right?” Arthur asked.
Harry nodded, squinting out at the grounds. The grass sparkled with dew underneath blue skies, with only a couple fluffy white clouds in the distance. And Harry was quite aware he was being irritating, but it was a fun change of pace.
It was Harry’s journal. How did it …
Malfoy shook his head, as if to say it’s fine.
'Sounds great.'
‘Thanks,’ Harry said, accepting his “Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada” mug. ‘Have you been to Vegas?’
‘Harry,’ Draco repeated, softer now, with twinkling eyes.
“You don’t want to stick together?” asked Pansy, once Flitwick wandered off to another table.
Guilt reared its ugly head again. He had Ginny.
‘Bloody hell. Your admirer all along was Draco sodding Malfoy.’
He wouldn’t cry, though … he wouldn’t cry seeing Ginny in a dress, walking toward him. In fact, he felt nothing at the imagined image. The thought felt painfully true—he wouldn’t cry.
Harry gritted his teeth, narrowed his eyes.
“A letter from Draco Malfoy,” Ron deadpanned.
Thanks for still reading ❤️
Hermione blinked at him, seemingly confused by the question.
Shit.
‘I want to see your face, so … you on top? Or, on your back?’
Harry felt stupid having said that. Obviously it wasn’t important. He was just tired.
And Malfoy did, for a moment, for long enough that Harry could kiss his mouth softly. Gently. Slowly. So that he could run his fingers past those cheeks, over shells of ears, and lace them into silken white-blond strands. So that he could pull his mouth away, and have their slackened lips hover—just a fraction apart—so that he could bring them back together, and feel their softness. To revel in that softness.
‘What?’
He ran a hand through his hair. “Harry Potter hates me.”
Harry opened up the package and looked inside. Oh. The things inside were a bit weird looking. Sort of like lumpy potato croquettes, or perhaps some kind of dried Afghan bug. He gave the inside a sniff. It smelled sweet and a bit floral. Shrugging to himself, Harry dipped a hand in and pulled one out. It was hard in his hand. He popped it into his mouth and bit down—and Merlin, was it
To see Draco better.
to love him? (And if so …
Hermione threw an arm around Ron’s shoulders and hummed her agreement into his shoulder.
Harry smiled. Then he told Draco about that time at the zoo when he was 10 years old.
“I didn’t bother you?”
“I never saw you when Potter and I...”
Fiddling with his hands, Harry looked around, but there wasn’t much to see besides side-tables with old and weathered magazines, and cheerful posters about practicing proper hand hygiene on the walls.
With the trees as their witness, Harry smiled and leaned in to kiss him, reaching for both of Draco’s hands at the same time.
Harry took them, and finally looked down at the food. Whatever it was had been beautifully arranged inside the box—a colourful mixture of golden yellow, white, fresh green, and orange-red. ‘What … is it?’
It was Morgan, with her head in the flames. 'Draco, so sorry. I know it's Friday evening—'
Frowning slightly, Draco watched Harry's back. Then he scrambled up to follow suit, padding over the hot sand and into the cold sea.
'Why might someone be cross with her?'
‘Friends,’ Malfoy echoed, like he was trying out how the word sounded in his mouth. It sounded sharp, and strange, coming from him. ‘You told me to stay away from you.’
Draco’s hand gave a subtle squeeze. ‘Bring your journal.’
"He's a fucking Death Eater, Harry, you could do better. Or is this some kind of latent teenage rebellion? Since you were too focused on Voldemort the first time around?"
Malfoy’s mouth quirked even more. “I’m glad you could come.”
“Why do you have a pumpkin?”
“Er, yeah,” Draco said, staring into the flames. “What did... Weasley want?”
The vibrations intensified, causing Harry’s hand to tingle uncomfortably.
'Fair enough.' Harry watched Draco turn and saunter out of the room—with a chest chock-full of affection for him.
“Yeah, you?”
They spent the remaining daylight hours together, talking about Muggle yachts, and Muggle vehicles in general. Talking about nothing important.
A curt nod, and Malfoy stood up, tossing the magazine to the pile with the others. They made eye contact as they passed each other. Malfoy almost seemed … nervous? Close-up, his eyes were wide, a bit frantic looking.  Harry flashed what he hoped was an encouraging smile.
He let out another laugh. Merlin, what should he make? Maybe a biryani?
Display cabinet? “Oh, then … the kitchen, I suppose. I’ll show you.”
Obviously Draco didn’t …
‘All right.’
Turning, he saw Harry lying on his stomach there—edged onto Draco's side of the bed—and still fast asleep even after that awful alarm. His hair was in absolute disarray, and his lips parted. He looked exceptionally relaxed with face half covered by the pillow.
‘And, I suppose, there just wasn’t anyone since. Granted, I didn’t try too hard to meet anyone new. My job has been my priority lately.’ Harry peered at Draco’s face, unable to read it. ‘What about you, then?’
Blu Cantrell - Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!)
him. Like... actually like him. Romantically. It defied logic, yes. But... maybe Draco didn’t need to tread too carefully.
‘Oh lord, no,’ Blaise said. ‘I always find it’s best to stay out of the drama. Zabinis don’t pick sides, that’s how we survive. Look at me.’ He gestured to himself, grinning. ‘I am unscathed.’
“You think,” Malfoy echoed softly. “And this trip involves … ?”
'The girls?'
He blinked at her for a beat. 'Oh, ah, haven't sorted that part yet,' he said quietly.
Shit.
Ah. Draco eyed the lack of space there, warily.
Malfoy considered this. “Well, alright.”
Harry nodded, watching with widening eyes. Inch after inch of pale skin was exposed as Malfoy’s slender, nimble fingers undid each button. When he was done, he threw open the shirt with a quick flourish, neutrally watching for Harry’s reaction.
Draco typed in the password (Angelpreet said you should always use a password, even if you live alone and your computer doesn't go anywhere.)
Harry relaxed into it, letting his body fall, letting himself splay naked overtop an equally naked Malfoy. With cocks digging into stomachs and hips.
“A cupboard?”
Malfoy—Draco—laughed with his groomsmen as they all came down the aisle in a wild bunch, and he was happier than Harry had ever seen him. Malfoy’s blond hair framed his face, clipped to chin length. He wore white tailored robes—scratch that, not white. More like an iridescent pearl, or … moonstone. His groomsmen, on the other hand, had matte white robes.
Hermione responded with a broken exhale. She let go of her stubborn friend as her lip trembled.  She turned towards Neville who’d sped over to them to help when Harry started to fight her.  The witch’s throat tightened as she tried to keep her voice even and free of the sobs she desperately needed to release for her own sake. “Neville? Can you—” she motioned to Harry with a shaky hand, “I just—I need a moment.”
Harry wanted to chase the vanishing heat as Ron and Neville untangled his thin shaky frame from their arms.  He stumbled over to his bed and flopped onto the downy comforter.  It took his remaining energy to lift his head and throw his glasses onto his side table.  For a brief moment, he made eye contact again with Ron.  His stomach clenched with guilt as he took in the dark circles tattooed beneath his eyes.  He parted his chapped lips to speak. “Ron, I’m—“
“Please,” he stood on tiptoe to get a better grip on the witch’s hand, “call me Radomir.”  He lifted Olympe’s hand to his lips. “May I?”
All too soon, the cup was empty and he was once again alone with his thoughts.  A tired sigh escaped chapped lips as Harry desperately tried to find answers in the stray droplets remaining at the bottom.  He ran a hand through his tangled hair before resting his elbow on the ancient stone counter.  Harry began to massage his temple with his thumb while his free hand drew lazy circles on the cold smooth surface.  He exhaled through his nostrils, deep in thought.
Well, that was rough to write.  The title of the chapter comes from the song "Not" by Big Thief because it's been harder for me to write Harry but something about that song finally clicked and I had a soundtrack for Harry's angst lol.  I know this chapter is not a fun one but next one should have a little bit more lightness to it since we're finally getting to the introduction of our champions.
The bastard had some nerve.  Minerva brought the forgotten tea to her lips so she wouldn’t be tempted to chuck the porcelain at the infuriating man’s head.  “You think me for a fool if I’m going to be swayed by glory and riches Mr. Tuft.”
“Not really, I’m just curious about the charm he used to decorate the room.”  The shorter wizard pointed at his maroon dress robes. “While I am very proud to wear Durmstrang’s colours, I’m more of a canary yellow type of man.”
Tuft took a deep breath which allowed the blotchy pink to leave his cheeks.  A shark like glimmer flashed in his beady eyes.  “Forgive me for my outburst, Headmistress.  I just feel so passionately about this event.  It has the chance to bring unity to the whole of Wizarding Europe.  Imagine that.  You could go into the history books for this, luv.  Perhaps the Ministry might even be able to contribute more funds to maintain the illustrious reputation of this school from the capital this tournament will bring.”
“…As you know, there have been rumors of Hogwarts hosting another Triwizard Tournament to boost morale amongst our community…”
The world around him became warped and muddled.
Harry bit his lip and sighed before nodding yes. Ron returned the nod. His brows slightly furrowed.  The ginger wizard gently leaned across the table and offered, “if it gets to be too much, you can come to me y’know?”
Tulip’s olive skin gained a peachy hue as she blushed from the over abundance of praise.  She gave Harry a wordless curtsey and went to work.
“Sorry,” Hermione puffed, “I thought I was going to be late.”
“E-excuse me…” A blushing Neville quietly grabbed the pumpkin juice pitcher and filled his goblet before awkwardly shifting away from the chaotic trio to return to his conversation with Luna.
McGonagall’s words faded away while Harry’s suspicion only grew deeper as he noticed the tightness at the corner of her lips and small furrow of her brow. He swallowed uncomfortably.
Harry felt like he was floating.  Most of his weight was supported by Ron and Neville, and for that he was grateful.  His legs felt like jelly and his head limply swayed side to side like a pendulum as he was dragged up the stairs to their dorm.
Minerva slammed the Ministry letter on her desk. “Their sheer audacity!”
Their conversation was cut short as the gargoyle statue at Minerva’s door alerted them of Madam Olympe Maxime’s arrival. The floor of Minerva’s office shook with the thundering click of the half-giantess’ stilettos against the stone floor.  Both Radomir and Minerva rose from their seats to greet the Beauxbatons headmistress properly.
Ginny slid down the bench with the speed and agility of a seeker to wolf whistle the already embarrassed couple before settling herself to Harry’s right.
He threw his head back in laughter at the matching blushes forming on the couple’s cheeks.
Hermione bit her lip with regret at the sharpness of her demand. Her next plea was softer, a broken hitch to her tone, “Harry, I know it’s hard but can you just try? Please?”
Had Harry not been so exhausted he would’ve been doubled over from laughter.  He could only muster a small lift of his lips.  His mind was miles away.  A thick mist of anxiety drizzled around him.  Something felt amiss.
Harry dug the toe of his trainer into the gravel still wrapped up in his thoughts.  Perhaps, it wasn’t a bad thing. Grieving forever was impossible, perhaps even irresponsible.  Maybe it was a sign of strength to press forward in spite of those lost, like the plots of all those Great War documentaries Harry had been forced to watch with the Dursleys.
Harry rolled the crick out of his neck as Hermione and Ron sat opposite of him at the Gryffindor table.  “So, how was Hogsmeade?”
Harry swirled abstract patterns on the back of Ginny’s hand with his finger.  “Of course. Why wouldn’t we be?"
but deep down she knew that it wasn’t fair.  Hell, none of it was. They’d all been deceived in various ways.  She bit her tongue and managed, “well, what’s done is done.”
It had a taken a year for the trials and rebuilding to take place.  McGonagall had sent a letter to those who would have completed their Hogwarts education the previous spring to notify them they could return for an “eighth” year and finish properly with N.E.W.T.s in tow.  She had also stated in her letter that eighth year students were allowed to enter the grounds prior to the day of the opening ceremony.  She reasoned that they were all adults and could be trusted to make it back to school as they saw fit.
Harry swallowed thickly.  Ron and Hermione had proven themselves to be loyal loving friends ever since he’d met the two at eleven.  Hell, they were family.  He knew he could confide in them about anything and everything yet somehow there was always a guilt when he was completely honest with them.  They all had their own traumas, many of which overlapped with one another’s but he still had this constant nagging thought that he shouldn’t burden them with his problems.
Sorry for the delay on this chapter. I'm going to be honest, my work life balance has been in shambles the past year. I've also been in a writing rut for a long time. There have been so many times where I wanted to delete this chapter and start over, but then I felt like I was too far in to do so and it just sat collecting dust while I scrambled to find any way to save it. This was a fucking monster to write and I still don't quite know how to feel about it overall but we're going to keep on truckin'. I know I promised this next chapter was going to introduce the champions but overall I feel like instead of taking another year to update and having an 11k+ chapter, I chose the lesser of two evils and chose to divide the next part into two, so thanks for sticking around this hot mess express.
The shorter bundle of fur and wool to her right shook as the man’s chuckle rumbled like distant thunder.  His voice dripped thick like molasses with his strong Russian accent. “With all due respect Headmistress, you are a powerful witch but you can’t control the weather.”
For the first time in years, Harry dreamed of Cedric.
Olympe nodded. She then tapped her manicured fingers to her scarlet lips thoughtfully.  “Mr. Dujardin… how do I say this?  He was a competent student, very much an idealist, but was very poor on the follow through. He’d have grandiose plans but no realistic way to accomplish them.  And, Merlin, his parents. The boy himself was fine, but I’ve never received more howlers from a parent than I did in the seven years he was at Beauxbatons.” The witch shuddered at the memory.
The young man’s gaze wavered. “Well… But… Had I been given the opportunity to represent Beauxbatons, I surely would have taken it. It’s the honour of a life time.”
Minerva’s fingers gripped tightly on her spoon as the fireplace came to life once more.  Her nostrils flared as the thorns in her side appeared in the flesh.
“Harry?” Hermione rushed around the table in a panic. She hooked her trembling arms underneath Harry’s arms in a desperate attempt to get his heavier frame up from the table. “C’mon, we need to get you to Madam Pomfrey.”
Harry’s stomach fluttered as more students and professors filled the hall.  He was giddy.  So much blood, sweat, and tears had gone into rebuilding.  To see the shock and awe in the eyes of the students made it all worth it.  It was a fresh start for everyone, a new era.
simple. Merlin, you two are a pair. Love poems sent by a ghost …" She shook her head. “Just talk to each other! You’re eighteen!”
Draco snorted.
'I saw you with Evan. Dancing.' The man said, talking over the sound of his piss. ‘You looked close.’
“All right.”
But it didn’t have Harry’s sparkly pink butterfly sticker on the inside cover.
'I know it wasn't my place to say anything to him. But I got the feeling he deserved it?'
That certainly caught Harry’s attention. He sat up straight.
The world needed Hermione Granger.
He and Potter locked eyes, and Potter seemed positively amused, albeit surprised. His eyes were wide and sparkly and pinned to Draco’s face.
“Watch me,” he answered petulantly, and immediately felt a little guilty.
'Yes, I do,' Draco admitted, as Harry's smile grew, slow and lazy. 'Don't you?'
“No,” Draco answered automatically. He needed to think more. He had to... process all this. Draco hazarded a glance at Potter, who nodded—as a muscle clenched in his jaw.
Draco smiled politely. “Yes, a field trip.”
Draco downed the rest of his Amante Passion.
Harry sucked in a breath. He’d admitted a lot, there. But, so had Draco before that. He managed a smile back. ‘I liked what you sent, you know? Mail from you was the most interesting part of my year.’
'Merlin's tits,' Draco said softly. 'I think that was the best time yet.'
. Potter wanted it.
Next Harry dabbed lavender oil on the back of his neck, and onto each wrist. (“It’ll help calm you,” Hermione had said when she handed it to him). He took a deep sniff from his wrist. She was right, it was a calming smell.
He didn’t want to knock and wake Rose, so Harry tried the handle. It opened for him. He hoped Ron and Hermione wouldn’t mind.
Harry looked at her. She seemed bored, examining the fingernails on her right hand. He turned to the window with a suppressed sigh, and pulled it closed, standing there looking out for a beat. He thought he saw the owl on the horizon, past the row of houses across the way, nearer to the park. But it was difficult to tell in the darkness.
‘Well … I’m glad you didn’t.’
Why did it always have to be Draco Malfoy? And why did it always have to be Harry?
“Ah. Right. Thanks.”
Harry smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. He seemed a bit … well, sad.
The edge of his mouth quirked up.
Harry shrugged. “I really don’t think there’s any cause for concern.”
On the next video, Draco just moved how he wanted to move, and kept an eye on Potter’s dances. In a way … it was like they were dancing with each other.
Draco took a spare blanket out of the closet, and draped it over Harry, and then he climbed into bed, setting an alarm for 9am.
? To slip back into his quiet life, knowing that handsome, brilliant, fascinating, and single Draco Malfoy was out there loving him? And he was supposed to just live with that? He was supposed to let him go, without trying? (Trying for
“Er, you know you can call me Harry now, right?”
'I didn't say that.'
“Hush. All right, and maybe I like it when he speaks to me like I’m a normal person.”
. So Malfoy was saying …
All he had was grief and uncertainty, really. Well … he could write about that … all those thoughts and feelings, like his Mind Healer wanted him to.
Harry grumbled to himself, as he walked the stone path up to Luna’s cottage door. He was a bit late—realising belatedly that he should probably shower, for the first time in several days, before facing human beings again. He hadn’t had enough time to shave … but, whatever. At least he smelled okay now, and not like old, sour milk.
Hermione blinked at him a bit, then nodded.
“Harry!” called Luna cheerfully, dressed from head-to-toe spandex as a red-striped candy cane. “Oh do come in!”
—and this was better than he could’ve ever imagined.
Which was a terribly normal thing to do, after agreeing on a wager. But it was
Harry didn’t know why that set a pit in his stomach. Was he … disappointed? Because a young girl just meant another of his young fans, someone who didn’t know him—the real him. When, when … maybe, if he were being honest with himself, he may have hoped the notes were from someone—special? Is that the right word here? Special, someone he
He wasn’t sure how to answer any of that. ‘Draco’s my friend.’
Harry sighed, and dug around in the box for the next cryptic note.
Were they? ‘Um, it’s possible … Professor.’
said a voice in his head that sounded irritatingly like Pansy.
‘No! No, that’s not it at all … I was … You see …' He just
That ... that part hurt. “I … hope we still are? In a way?”
Ron huffed and mumbled under his breath, “We already bloody well did.” Then, louder, “Whatever. Come on Harry, I’ve had enough of looking at this waste of space.”
Harry grinned, despite his low mood over the weekend that hadn’t left. “No, it definitely wasn’t as fun.” Ginny and him had been happy, then. All their friends were there—they’d laughed all night, and
He turned and smacked his hands against the surface, making a beautiful arc of spray in Harry's direction.
She leant closer to him, grinning. ‘Well apparently he’s a fucking DJ down in Ibiza, and he’s got his own YouTube channel.’
Harry let out a laugh, and kept going.
? Wasn’t there a more posh, less Muggle, place Malfoy could’ve picked? Blimey.
Maybe this’d been a mistake. He loved Luna, yeah … it’s just, he didn’t know if he had the energy.
had kissed Terry Boot and Hermione and who knows who else (not Harry, anyway), before he’d gone back to his dorm and chatted into the small hours with
‘So what? I’ve been cooped up for like a month. I’m not sick. Are you?’
Draco listened to the birds singing their greetings to the new day’s sun, as he leant back on his arms.
Harry smiled softly. Who knew, he supposed. But they did seem to be getting on well now. And he found he didn’t feel bothered to think about it all too hard. Like, why overthink it? Especially when it was nice—it felt … good. Felt good to be friends now.
