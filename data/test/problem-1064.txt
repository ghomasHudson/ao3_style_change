He probably should've stayed and talked to them. Potter would've done that. But this friendship was just... it wasn't like that. They rarely had these heart to heart, honest and deep conversations. He would never change them for someone else, though. It was always suitable for all three of them. Everyone had their lives and privacy.
Sirius always tells him to not worry about things that are imposed on him by rich, high-profiled people in expensive robes. It was slightly clashing with his decision to impress Draco's father one day. The guy was disgustingly rich, he had connections in the Ministry and outdated views on the world around him. He was exactly the kind of people his godfather liked to run over with his motorcycle and eat for breakfast.
He could literally see gears turning inside their heads, when they were processing that information. The circus has arrived, it's time for the show.
'I'm, well... I'm with Draco. We've been dating for a while now, a couple months, and it's really cool so I thought it'd be good to let you know, or something.' he didn't look them in the eyes, he didn't like to do that. But he had to take his eyes off his shoes when after a while they were still silent. Ron looked even more confused and lost than usually, but Hermione seemed as if everything just made sense to her.
'Draco!' he heard suddenly. He lifted his head, but he didn't manage to see what was going on. Something hit him in the face.
He got up and stood on the fountain wall to see something. He felt his knees go weak, and he definitely turned pale, when he saw Draco being dragged by his friends towards the Hospital Wing. It seemed like he was unconscious, his face was covered in blood.
'It just... it doesn't make any sense.' Blaise's forehead was wrinkled. 'I mean, it's cool and all, but you don't even like him. He's driving you crazy.'
'I haven't heard anything about that.' Harry sat down next to them on a small wall around the fountain. 'Dumbledore keeps promising him he'll talk to other parents, but honestly, he's not doing anything.'
'We must've really annoy you, trying to find you a date and all.' Pansy wrinkled her nose. 'Is that why you're telling us now?'
'And you're always plotting, trying to come up with ideas to piss him off or annoy his friends. We spent the whole weekend...'
'Ew,' he winced at the sight of blood. He sat down, and pulled Harry's sleeve to make him do the same. 'Come on, it's just Malfoy with a wrecked nose.'
'So... we're good? Because like, at this moment I really need to talk shit about that Ravenclaw who hit my man with a buldger.'
He looked down at his friends, and then at Draco's. They were, quite ineffective, trying to get him off the floor and inside the castle.
He probably should have returned to his dormitory for the night, but well, this wasn't that bad either.
'I'm happy you told us, and I'm proud of you.' Pansy touched his elbow and gave him one of her rare, nice and honest smiles. 'None of us is good with that sort of thing, Draco. But we're both here for you, right?'
Draco snorted, but nodded his head a little. They started walking towards the Quidditch pitch. They didn't know how to get this conversation going, but they were trying, and Draco knew that. After all, they followed him out of the castle, instead of just letting him go.
They walked to the place at the long Slytherin table where Draco, Pansy and Blaise usually had their meals. The three of them sat down, while the other three looked at them over the table and didn't know what to do.
Like that. It was the best, the absolute nicest summer of his life. He had to cross all the borders he made for himself to write Harry a letter. They met a couple of times, his parents invited him over and let him stay for as long as he wanted. He shamelessly took that opportunity and stayed there for the rest of the summer break.
'I'm not, I promise,' he sighed. 'You said it yourself, we're not good with this whole... talking thing. I just want to get it over with, and I'm tired of hiding.'
Draco told him earlier that he's planning on telling his friends about them. Harry was looking around since breakfast to find him, he wanted to cheer him up or check how it went. He could barely restrain from sending him hand signals all across the Great Hall. He was also gathering up the courage and words for his own honest conversation with Ron and Hermione. After all, he was the one who insisted on that.
How the hell was he supposed to know? He fell in love deep and fast and such a long time ago, he didn't catch the exact moment and didn't even realize until it was too late. He found it very annoying, so obviously he did the only reasonable thing there was to do. He started being the biggest bitch possible, trying to ruin Potter's life. He hoped that maybe, just maybe, he would see through it, but he was way too dumb for it.
Last year he decided to tell Ron and Hermione he's bisexual. He considered it his personal discovery and he wanted to share such revealing news with them. He was a bit nervous and sure it would knock them off their feet.
'Hey, loves.' he started, putting his hands in the pockets of his too-big jeans. One of the trouser's rolled up legs unrolled itself, but he didn't feel like bending down to fix it. Chill wind blew into his face, revealing his forehead with a cool scar that he got as a baby, after hitting his head on a cupboard. 'This is an emergency meeting, I have news.'
While he was stirring honey into his tea with resignation, Pansy and Blaise were having the time of their lives, not knowing how pointless their efforts are. They were looking at everyone eating late dinner in the Great Hall and looking for familiar faces. Draco got really far in not correcting them, every time they assumed he was either straight or single. At this point, it would be rude to admit that he has been pulling their legs for months.
'We've been together since summer. I spent a lot of time with him during the break and it just... happened. Like that.'
'Did you eat breakfast?' Harry asked instead, crossing his arms over his chest, because he didn't know what else to do with them. He was surrounded by more people that usually and he wasn't sure who he should be looking at. When Draco shook his head, he moved forward towards the Great Hall without looking back. His pale boy quickly caught up with him and poked him lightly with his elbow to check if everything was okay. Harry smiled at him. It was a bit awkward, as none of them knew how to act in front of the other's friends.
'No, I think I'll stay' the redhead sat down right in front of him, despite the visibly malcontent look on Draco's face. He started to fill up his plate as if he was at home. Hermione sat at the edge of the bench next to him, and Harry squeezed in on Draco's right side. He reached for the chocolate croissants to put them on Draco's plate. Little bastard knew exactly what his boyfriend liked to eat for breakfast. While he was at it, he seemed as if he really wanted to say something.
'How long have you known?' asked Pansy. She had her hands clasped behind her back, and she was turning her face towards him, so that she could look him in the eyes.
'Draco!' they all sounded surprised. Did they really think he was still unconscious? Or asleep, with the awful racket they made? He didn't even have to say hello to them, as Madame Pomfrey approached him quickly, wanting to discharge him from her hospital to get rid of all the unwanted noise.
'For fuck's sake, Potter' Parkinson was looking at him with pity. 'It's just a broken nose. He's gonna be
Harry stared at the door, very offended and also, of course, worried for Draco. How could she not let him in? After he brought her the limited edition of Halloween cookies? He heard a heavy, irritated sigh.
Eventually he figured out that it's not gonna get better until he confronts him. He'd rather risk it, than never find out whether he ever had a chance. And when it turned out that he did, in fact, have it, he was way happier that during any mean prank or heated argument with Potter and his friends.
girl at this point, because they really didn't want him to spend the yule ball alone. He would probably find it almost adorable that they cared this much, if he wasn't in such a bad, hopeless mood all the time. He was so far gone in the closet, he started considering himself a permanent Narnia resident. He was seriously thinking about changing his legal house address in school papers.
'It's just that...' he paused, because there was some kind of fuss by the entrance. People were crowding and standing on their toes to see better. 'What's going on?'
'Yes, hi, but I'm in hospital! Can't I take it out on you a little bit?' Draco raised his hands defensively, but he didn't say anything else, trying to behave. He put away his blanket, thanked Madame Pomfrey for fixing his gorgeous face and walked out first to the corridor. 'Shit.' he blurted out. The hospital room was well heated, but once he walked out of it a wave of cold air almost knocked him off his feet. It was a freezing saturday morning, but apparently not freezing enough for teachers to put a heating spell on the castle. And he was still in his yesterday clothes, with no coat or jumper whatsoever.
Harry knew how his friends perceived Draco. He knew that on the outside he seemed reserved, often snarky, he was constantly calculating and extremely overdramatic. In private, however, as he experienced for himself, Draco could be really lovely and vulnerable. He loved teasing Harry, but at the same time he deeply cared for him, and he knew that. All the insults and mean words didn't affect him anymore. For him, Draco was just a kitten, trying so hard to be seen as angry and tough. At first he was surprised, because it was nothing like the Draco he thought he knew from previous years. He needed a moment to get closer to him, to get to know him better and experience what he was like, once the walls he built to protect himself are gone.
'Is this why you didn't want to tell us which girl you were dating on our fifth year?' Draco paused mid-step, a bit embarrassed, because he completely forgot about that. 'Was she even real?'
He tried to show off a bit when Draco visited him during summer. Unfortunately, they had to illegally enchant the machine, because driving with supervision is one thing, and stealing Sirius' motorcycle for a romantic ride was something a bit more complicated. It was, obviously, another reason for Draco to tease him. Harry didn't mind, because he got to hear his most sincere laugh and see his hair, for once just as messy as his own, blown by the wind and without a trace of hair gel.
'I... I don't know, since like, always? I just didn't think it's a big deal, and there was no reason to tell you' he shrugged.
He wasn't observant. Draco was still making fun of him and how incredibly blind he was to his obvious signs of affection. How was he supposed to know that constant insults and teasing meant he liked him? He was no psychic, and he had terrible grades from divination. And other subjects as well, while we're at it. Grading system was, after all, just another social construct.
'Tell me you're kidding' Blaise had a blank stare. 'You made us waste all that time to find you a Yule Ball date, when you actually had one already?!'
'Jesus, Potter, get up.' Parkinson pulled him by his arm. She looked a bit worried, but mostly irritated (and she was throwing knives at him with her stare alone). 'He's gonna be okay. We were walking by the pitch and some Ravenclaw kid accidentally sent a buldger right into his face. Come on, help us get him to the hospital wing.'
'Uhhh...' he was a bit paralyzed. Ron stood up as well and climbed the fountain next to him to see it for himself.
Draco was surprised by the relief he felt. “Thanks, Harry,” he said. “I appreciate your hospitality.  I suppose I will stay for a while longer.  To be perfectly honest, the thought of being back at the manor, full of dark memories, doesn’t appeal.”  As an afterthought he added, “But please don’t hesitate to tell me to go home when you get sick of my presence.  That famous American Muggle Ben Franklin said that house guests, like fish, start to smell after three days, and I’ve been here for much longer than that.”
Keith listened intently to Harry’s narrative, and then said, “Harry, you started out by saying you were confused about your relationship with Draco and obsessing about it.  Tell me what is confusing to you?”
“I hope it doesn’t bother you that I took the liberty to add non-pureblood family members and restore the names of disowned members to the tapestry,” Harry said.  “It felt a bit presumptuous of me, not being a member of the Black family.  But I guess my commitment to social justice took precedence, and as custodian of this ancestral home, I decided it was my prerogative to restore the tapestry in a way that reflected my own values.  It didn’t feel right that two of my heroes, Sirius and Andromeda, had been removed from the tree, and that someone like Teddy Lupin wouldn’t be included because he’s half-blood.”
Hilda took a seat on the sofa next to Harry.  Keith said, “The next step is for you and Hilda to watch the memories together.  Harry, I’d like you to describe what you are seeing in the present tense, as if he were happening right here and now.”
“Oh,” Harry said, dumbfounded.  He was silent for a few moments before asking the question that was on his mind.  “Just wanted to touch my hair, or more?”
Ron said, “He looks like he’s about the same age as Rose, six or seven?  You must bring him by sometime for a play date with Rose and Hugo.”
Draco replied, “He’ll turn seven in February, and he’d be thrilled to meet Rose and Hugo.  He doesn’t get to spend much time with other kids.”
Dr. Mathey then said, “Please do not hesitate to ask any questions or express any concerns that may come up for you, Mr. Potter.  It’s critically important to Ms. Lancaster and me that you feel safe and comfortable with the treatment.  I also want to assure you that Ms. Lancaster and I both have an ethical obligation to maintain your confidentiality.  So whatever is said or happens in this office is kept completely confidential.”
As the two men spent more and more time together, Draco’s distrust of Harry continued to erode. Draco was now confiding personal information to Harry that he had never shared with another soul.  It had begun with the conversation in which both men had talked openly about their marriages and Harry had come out to Draco.  After that conversation Draco was inclined to turn to Harry whenever he needed advice or support.
Draco nodded. “I approve of the changes, Harry,” he said.  “It’s fitting that Sirius, Andromeda, and Teddy are represented.  I also appreciate the addition of Scorpius and me.”
Harry had made arrangements with Dr. Mathey for Hermione and Ron to join his next therapy session.  Keith warmly welcomed the couple and introduced them to Hilda.  He explained what their role was and how the session would proceed—Hermione and Ron would view selected memories that Harry had siphoned into the pensieve and then share with Harry any thoughts and feelings they wished to share.  Keith alerted the couple to the fact that viewing another person’s painful memories can be distressing, sometimes to the point of vicarious traumatization.  He assured them that he and Hilda would monitor the process and interrupt it if they observed any signs of excessive distress.  Keith also stated that he and Hilda would provide any support or debriefing the couple might need after viewing Harry’s memories.
After Harry and Draco had exchanged messages via owl, they scheduled a meeting at the Ministry of Magic the following Monday morning.  As both men had expected, Lucius Malfoy’s suicide immediately became the top news story in the wizarding world, covered excessively and obnoxiously by The Daily Prophet and the other less popular, but still influential, magical tabloids.  Reporters were camped all around Malfoy Manor, desperate for glimpses of Draco and Narcissa.
“Of course,” Harry said, pulling Draco into a tight hug.  He whispered, “You were brilliant, today. Your father would be so proud.” A feeling of warmth suffused Draco’s body.
At his next therapy session Harry told Keith and Hilda that he had considered asking friends to witness his painful memories but had decided against it.  He explained his reasons for not wanting to involve Ron, Hermione or Draco.
Harry explained to Keith and Hilda his decision to focus first on his experiences of childhood abuse.  They agreed that a pensieve would be useful to access and work with Harry’s childhood memories.  Harry would retrieve specific memories from his time at the Dursleys, he and Hilda would watch and describe the memories, and Keith would guide Harry to do the therapeutic work as he revisited scenes from his childhood.
Draco also looked at Harry’s offer of assistance with a kind eye.  Harry had written, “Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.” Draco could read between the lines.  Harry knew that the tabloids, especially the Daily Prophet, would have a field day with the story of Lucius’s suicide and that would cause a major disruption to Draco’s personal and work life.  If anyone could help Draco get through the approaching shitstorm, Harry could—after all, he was a senior official in the Ministry and a close friend of the Minister herself.
Hilda spoke up then.  “I have a suggestion,” she said.  “Even though we viewed only a memory of dementors and thankfully not the actual phenomena, the memory can cause some feelings of despair, hopelessness and anguish.  I think it may be helpful for all four of us to cast our patronuses to counteract any of those negative feelings.”
A blissful feeling permeated the room and remained, even after the wizards had lowered their wands and their shining patronuses had faded.  Harry and Draco agreed that they had accomplished all their tasks at the manor, and all that remained was to teleport their own and Scorpius’s belongings before moving in on August 1st.
Keith nodded.  “Makes sense,” he said, “but let me check in on Harry and Draco first.  How are the two of you doing?  Would it be OK to talk before using magic to soothe the emotional reactions?”
Harry explained how he came to be a client of Dr. Mathey, who knew all about the magical world and was respected in wizarding healing circles.  Harry also explained that Dr. Mathey worked with Ms. Lancaster, who was both a psychological technician and a witch.
“No, I don’t know where I stand with him,” Harry said.  “I don’t want to be in love with him, I really don’t.  But if I’m honest with myself, I have to admit that I do love Draco.  What a cliché, falling in love with a straight wizard.  And I don’t want to fuck up the friendship we have.”
Hilda cast the charm and said, “I wish I could do more, but unfortunately there are not many incantations to heal the psyche.  Our community needs to work on remedying that.”
“Oh, nonsense,” Harry said, “it’s absolutely no inconvenience.  It’s a huge house, too big for just me and Kreacher.  Besides you probably won’t see much of me as I spend way too many hours here at the Ministry.”  Draco looked skeptical.
Escorting Harry to where his mother stood, Draco said, “Mother, please welcome my friend and colleague, Mr. Harry Potter.”
Draco had chosen to remain in the manor, of course. Although the Malfoys had lost a substantial part of their fortune due to the huge restitution penalties imposed for their war crimes, they were permitted to keep the manor house and land.  Draco knew that as the sole Malfoy heir it was his duty to protect the family home.  He also realized that, had Harry Potter not defended him at his trial, the Malfoys would undoubtedly have lost the manor too.  He wished he didn’t owe such a huge debt to Potter, but carrying the emotional burden of that debt was preferable to losing the manor.
“Incredibly hard,” he said. “To be honest, I’m feeling pretty wiped out now.  What made it especially awful was that I knew what was coming, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it.  Like watching a Muggle film when you know that it’s going to end horribly.  You want to change the ending, but you know you can’t.  You feel so powerless.”
“It helped to consider why he might have acted the way he did,” Harry replied. “I’ll never know for sure what his motivation was, and I certainly will never hear those words from him.  Still, it helps to entertain the possibility that he treated me badly not because I deserved it but because of his own issues.”
Meanwhile, Hermione and Harry assigned a team of aurors to accost the hordes of reporters camped out at Malfoy Manor.  The aurors’ task was to inform the reporters that neither Draco nor Narcissa were currently in residence at the manor but had departed for undisclosed locations.  Persons on or near the Malfoys’ property were also to be warned that any act of trespassing, loitering, or vandalism would be dealt with severely by the Auror Department.
The tension between the two men thawed considerably a few months after Draco’s trial.  As soon as he arrived at the Ministry on a bright Friday morning, Harry received the shocking news that Lucius Malfoy had committed suicide in Azkaban.  Despite his overpowering aversion to the elder Malfoy, Harry felt intense compassion for Draco, knowing that the Slytherin would be devastated.  And heads would roll at Azkaban.  There had been so many attempts to institute much needed reforms at the dreaded prison.  Obviously those reforms hadn’t been successful if one of Azkaban’s most renowned inmates had found a way to kill himself.
The wizards apparated in the Grangely parlor at the appointed time.  Hugo and Rose ran up to Harry, demanding hugs and welcoming him with shouts of “Uncle Harry.”  Harry then introduced the children to Draco, saying, “Hugo and Rose, I’d like you to meet my partner, Draco.  Draco, this is Hugo and Rose, my godchildren.”
“Thank you, Timsy,” Draco said, “but I am not expected.  Please do not trouble Scorpius but do ask Lady Astoria if she is free to see me.”
Draco nodded and said, “If you don’t mind me asking a rather personal question, can you give me an example of something you’re sorting out?”
“Fair point,” Harry admitted.  Mr. and Mrs. Granger were knowledgeable about all things magical.  They had worked hard to learn as much as they could about the magical world so they could better support their brilliant daughter.
Harry took a deep breath and continued, “And when Hermione said she wished she could have helped more, and Ron called me the strongest wizard alive, I realized how lucky I am to have such brilliant friends who will always have my back.  I’m beyond grateful.  I love you two so much.”
Lifting his head up for a second, Harry yelled back, “Go for it!” then immediately returned to his task.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Draco said, “why did you and Ginny break up?  You always seemed like the perfect couple.”
Scorpius and Albus got along famously from the beginning of their acquaintance.  The two little wizards were only a year apart in age and loved playing together.  They would rush around on their toy brooms, pretending to fly and creating elaborate fantasies in which they were the heroes in the midst of thrilling and perilous adventures.
Harry felt awkward.  He knew that Ron would have a hard time understanding how his feelings for Draco had changed.  “Draco’s not the same person we knew at Hogwarts,” he said.
“Huge.  I don’t want to lose him,” Harry said. “I’ve been so happy since he started living with me.  I love hanging out with him, whether we’re having a great conversation, or just hanging out listening to music, or unwinding at the tavern, or enjoying a meal together.  Being with Draco is the highlight of my day.  When I’m at work, I look forward to spending the evening with him.  I miss him when he’s not around.”
“Keith suggested that it might be beneficial to have a trusted friend view some of my memories and share their reactions with me.  He saw how I reacted when Hilda shared an emotional response to one of my particularly painful memories.  It was healing to see Hilda’s response.  So, I was wondering if you would be willing to view some of my memories, Draco.  I didn’t want to ask you because I know the memories can be jarring, and you’ve been through so much lately.  So please tell me honestly if you’d rather not.  I know it’s a lot to ask."
“So let’s begin, shall we?” Keith suggested.  He began gathering information about Harry’s history.  Some of the information Harry shared was already familiar to both Keith and Hilda.  However, they were astonished to learn about Harry’s experience of horrible childhood abuse when he lived with the Dursleys, as well as the torture that Dolores Umbridge had inflicted on him.  Keith asked most of the questions in an attempt to establish an accurate timeline of the many traumatic events in Harry’s life.  However, Hilda would interject a question here and there to clarify the magical details, such as how exactly Harry was able to summon the phoenix Fawkes to rescue him in the Chamber of Secrets.
“I don’t know, 'Mione,” Harry said to his best female friend, “do you really think I should see a Muggle psychologist? Whatever for?”
The friends were sitting in Harry’s living room at 12 Grimmauld Place after a challenging day at the Ministry.  They had grabbed some take-out curry and apparated at Harry’s house to resume their conversation about Muggle psychotherapy for Harry.
At that moment Hermione entered the parlor, walked over to Harry, and gave him a welcoming hug.  “Ron should be here in a minute, and we’ll dine shortly,” she said.  Looking at the children clutching their boxes of chocolate frogs, she said, “You may each have one chocolate frog after supper. Now go wash up.  We’ll be eating soon.”
Harry laughed.  “Well, I’ll leave it up to you whether to tell your mother about us.  But maybe we can start with Pansy if you think she’ll be cool with it.  We can slowly build up to the more difficult people to come out to.”
The friends shared a laugh.  “No, that wouldn’t do at all,” Harry agreed.  He added, “I haven’t agreed to this yet, mind you, but I’m not completely opposed to the idea.  I know that I do need some help.  I just need to think about it some more and to get some more information about how Muggle psychology works.”
The wizards were facing away from each other so neither could see the expression on the other’s face.
“I appreciate that, Dr. Mathey,” Harry said. “And please call me ‘Harry.’  That will go a long way to making me feel more comfortable.  I’m not a particularly formal person.”
“That is so amazing, Harry,” Hermione said in awe. “How did I have no idea about your independent study with Remus?”
Harry took a momentary pause, then added with a grin, “So then we started being physical and one thing led to another.  I won’t go into details.”
“You won’t, Harry,” Draco said earnestly.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I have strong feelings for you too.  I already told you that I love and admire you. I’m just confused about what happens next.  I’ve never been with another man before.  Actually I’ve never felt like this before about anyone, except maybe Scorpius.”
“Would you like to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place for a while, at least until the pandemonium quiets down?” Harry proposed.
“On Friday we had a conversation through two-way mirrors,” Draco replied. “Mother put on a brave face but I know she was highly distraught.”
Tears were streaming down Draco’s cheeks, as he reached over and pulled Harry into a tight hug. “I’m so sorry, Harry.  I wish I could have been there for you.  I’m here for you now.”
After interviewing Harry for about a half hour, Keith said, “Harry, I know we have just scratched the surface of your amazing and often difficult life, but it’s important to me that you don’t get overwhelmed by recounting past painful experiences.  I also think that the best bet is to proceed slowly and cautiously, which means starting off by working on less painful traumatic experiences before moving to the more painful, deeper wounds.”
Harry, Draco and Hilda looked away from the pensieve, overcome with emotion and unable to speak. Keith looked at them with concern. “Hilda,” he said, “do we need a magical intervention at this point?  It’s clear that was an intensely powerful and extremely painful memory.”
“I try to talk to him a few times a week either through two-way mirrors or Floo Powder,” Draco replied. “Astoria and I negotiated a six-month trial separation, so we have another three months to figure out what we’re going to do about our marriage.  At this point it doesn’t look good, I’m afraid.”
On a coolish day in mid-April Harry made his way to Dr. Keith Mathey’s office in Harley Street.  Harry had decided to take Muggle public transportation for a change.  It had been quite a while since he had spent much time in the Muggle world and he regarded this visit to see the Muggle psychologist as an adventure of sorts.
“Ron, please,” Hermione chided in her most reasonable tone. “This is obviously important to Harry, and we have to be supportive.”
What Harry had disliked most about Draco since day one was his snooty, patrician attitude, his superiority complex.  Ever since their first meeting on the Hogwarts Express when Malfoy had sneered at Ron and insulted the Weasleys, Harry would bristle whenever Malfoy put on airs, acting like he and his family were Merlin’s gift to the wizarding world. He couldn’t imagine ever completely forgiving Malfoy for calling Hermione a Mudblood.  Hermione, who had more class and integrity in her pinky finger than all the Malfoys combined.
The room feels freezing. He fidgets between the covers looking for a warm place between the covers, but the empty space next to him is much colder and his skin instantly bristles sending a wave of chills throughout his body. He turns back to his previous position cursing under his breath. He hadn't expected winter to take over the ideal fall weather this year.
It doesn't take long, but it does take longer than expected until they find themselves in the magical town of Ireland and climb a hill to the purple houses at the top, and according to the letter they sent to Ron, this must be where they live.
"Hey, idiot, you left your damn boxers in my room." Draco stomps into the orchard. He stops when he sees Ernie next to Neville, and then a smile replaces the scowl on his pale traitorous face. "... MacMillan."
Draco wants to turn around to get that other boy, but they couldn't act until something happened according to the rules imposed by the ministry.
The Hufflepuff team gathers in a large circle around both professors. The weather was too horrible to be outside, especially for a Quidditch practice, but since Slytherin was suspended until February for his mischief with Felix Felicis, Draco had to do something during his afternoons not to freak out with boredom, and if anyone came To win this match, he preferred it to be Hufflepuff and not Gryffindor. Now that Potter was in command it wasn't certain that they would take a leading role on the house cup marker. McGonagall might have Dumbledore fever.
His eyes see Harry's face and the useless potion on the table. He goes back to Harry and his gaze turning into something more worried, and suddenly everything is spinning, he looks at his own blurred hands and it's a matter of seconds for everything to be black and his body hurts.
"Fuck it, I want to go out." Draco twists around staggering in the attempt, Potter is there to hold him just in time. And he pulls him away. "Leave me alone, Potter."
Connor nods. They both get up to leave, but Connor stops to thank him for the support. Draco tells him that he has nothing to be thankful for, but that the boy is giving him his best kept secret and the power to completely destroy him.
"That doesn't mean you can't be homophobic. Marlene says that even gay people can hate themselves." Ron explains as if he was an expert. With that know-it-all voice that he surely got stuck with from Granger.
"I found out about them, like officially and all, but I swear that squeaky bitch James already knew about it." Dorcas laughs and Draco's body is electrified by the joy of that laugh. "We went out into the muggle world to show these crib children what the world was like without magic. We lost Sirius, it turned out that he went on a motorcycle, and Pam! Remus ran to look for him, I think he could sniff it out or something like that because he always found him when he was given the chance to do a drama and he was hiding somewhere. But when we found them they were kissing behind a repair shop."
"I guess my parents' ideas. My father found out about her visit and forbade us to see them again, we could not receive any of their owls."
"Is this letter from your family?" Harry asks, eyeing the envelope warily. The alarms in Draco's head go off and he doesn't wait any longer to snatch it from the hands of the man in front of him.
"Great! See how easy it's? Now everyone get together with someone from the opposite house to which they belong and stay like this for the rest of the class because those will be their places the rest of the year."
The two of them stand up quickly shaking hands with Draco before saying goodbye to Harry. Finally an elf appears with a bottle of Lady Willembur's pomace and Draco is the first to help himself. It doesn't take long for him to start feeling the effect of alcohol on his body until a man sends him a drink.
Between curses and murmurs of anger Draco puts on his coat and gets out of bed feeling the cold ground on his feet and cursing for not having taken a pair of socks or shoes. He has his wand in hand in case it is an emergency and some Death Eater escaped from Azkaban and they plan to assassinate him for being a fucking coward. He could almost hear Fenrir Greyback's bitter laugh or Barty Crouch Jr.'s annoying lip movement.
Draco shrugs, putting the coffee cup on the table. Takes a napkin and wipe the corner of his lips. "Let's say I need a better salary."
"They are the reports that must be signed for the permits to go out to Hogsmeade, the director asked me to give them to you, I suppose it is part of your punishment for playing rock star."
There's an interesting glow so he brings his hands up to the face of the man in front of him and carefully removes his glasses.
"Jeremy says that absinthe goes before glass," says the girl. Draco denies it. It was a mistake to think that the day couldn't be worse.
In fact, it made sense that he was there all the time; He didn't have his own office yet because the Defence Against the Dark Arts office had a Grindylow infestation or something like that and the remaining classrooms were no better than that room where they had coffee on hand, and cinnamon cookies if they were lucky and the elves felt happy to make an extra dessert.
"I'm sorry, Director!" Teddy's hair turns red again and the students laugh. "Hufflepuff misses this chance, but it doesn't matter, it looks like Hugo is over- Oh, damn, damn. John, that bludger is going to hit Victoire! Got damn."
CW: Homophobic language and internalized homophobia. If this doesn't do you any good, please take a break. Or I can alert you as soon as the scene gets too hard, I'll put a small notice in capital letters and italics.
When he arrives at the classroom he finds it empty, however, the students begin to arrive little by little in groups and end up separating by houses. Hufflepuff is on one side while Ravenclaw takes the other end, they're a third year and do not look at each other.
Someone drops some of his drink on the floor when Draco is passing by, but he's faster and with a wave of the wand he orders her to stop, the man who dropped it mutters something about how disgusting the Death Eaters are and Harry turns to pull him by the arm.
"The Beatles! Neville says with a chin full of chocolate. We love listening to my mother's old records at Christmas. He plays Paul and I play George, of course, sometimes Herms joins us and plays John. Harry doesn't sing and so he goes to play Ringo's drums."
"Ernie..." he replied. Hannah nodded mischievously, teasing Neville's blush that made a cute combination with his nose already red from the cold.
With the end of the first semester and December exams coming through the door with the bells set for the holidays, the most exciting topics also began according to Draco. The first few months were simply a preheat with absinthe and fire paprika for simple and almost useless potions, and although he seemed to be the only one excited about it, he knew they would end up liking it. Especially since in third year most of the adolescent crushes arose.
"I would have preferred a little more sun." Put his hands together to get friction and get some heat.
But he couldn't, he wasn't physically able to not feel at least a little bit of Harry's happiness, when he gave him that giant smile.
They walked away and when Harry turned around, he saw Ron and Hermione peeking at him around the corner. He went to them, despite the fact that they were giving him weird stares.
'It's, well...' alright, he wasn't a twat after all. And it was not just for himself. 'Okay, I know how this sounds. But it's Potter. I'm dating Potter.
He was walking down the courtyard, doing finger guns at his friends that were passing by, but aiming for Ron and Hermione, as they were sitting by the fountain. Magic lanterns were shedding dim light all over the place.
'No,' Draco grunted. He took a deep breath, and reminded himself he knew too many of their dark secrets for them to abandon him. They have to be his friends, or else he will fuck up their lives (not really). 'It's just that I'm kind of… dating someone?'
Blaise gave Pansy a very disapproving look and raised his eyebrow. She just shrugged, slurping her third black coffee in a row.
The three of them were easily able to transport Draco to Madam Pomfrey. Harry wanted to go inside and stay by his side until he wakes up to find out who did this to him. Madam Pomfrey, however, didn't like that idea and sent them out the door as soon as they delivered her patient.
Ron was staring at her in consternation, and Harry was questioning his entire existence. He couldn't be
Even though there was a war of heavy sighs, cold stares, mean comments and crossed arms going on right above his head. And even though he was just laying there, in the middle of that pitiful play, because one, of course, he liked attention, but also two - Potter was finally in the same room as his friends and they haven't killed each other yet. Even better, they all had almost peaceful intentions. He saw it as an absolute win. Apart from the fact that his head started to hurt from laying down for too long and listening to their banter.
Sirius was, without a doubt, the most awesome person Harry has ever met. He was a great influence on him since he was a little kid, and he was the one who taught him how to be cool. Despite Harry's absolute obliviousness he knew how to quickly adapt to the situation and pretend that he knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning. Besides, in secret from his parents and Remus, Sirius was teaching him how to drive a motorcycle.
He noticed their friends were looking at them strangely, as if they suddenly started to behave like lunatics. Well, maybe they weren't completely wrong.
'Just so I can, you know... talk to him about it' he shrugged, but when Draco was still giving him an expectant look, he raised his slightly clenched fists and pretended to punch the air. 'Alright, and maybe beat him up a lil.'
seen me wearing something so...' he sighed heavily, when Harry pouted as if he was really hurt and upset. He was just pretending, obviously, but he was almost convincing. 'Give me that.' he took this incredibly hideous, knitted jumper with a big H on it and put it on, messing up his hair. One sleeve was tucked up, because otherwise it would be too long for him. Harry reached for the other sleeve, to tuck it up as well.
'It's really weird for me to imagine you two together' Draco heard the redhead speaking out of the blue, after he saw Harry running his fingers through Draco's hair to fix it a little.
He believed so badly, that they should tell their friends and stop hiding with the relationship that formed between them. He wanted to be able to take his hand carelessly on school corridors and bump into him during meals whenever he felt like it. How was Draco supposed to say no to that? He was so determined to tell Pansy and Blaise about his boyfriend, he completely forgot how utterly shitty he is, when it comes to having a conversation. That's probably why he felt so comfortable with people who didn't want to (and didn't know how) talk too much about emotions and private matters.
'Potter, you're so pathetic' he pinched his nose again and turned his head the other way to hide a smile he couldn't resist. 'You're embarrassing me.'
Harry flinched, when something white appeared in the corner of his view. He raised his head very quickly and started pulling at Draco's shoulder, extremely happy with something. His boyfriend gave him an irritated look, because
'...trying to figure out how to throw him out of that fucking tower, I know.' he sighed heavily and shoved his hands deep into his pockets. He looked up at the sky. It was winter, it started to dusk already. 'Look, I don't know what else to tell you.'
Draco was absolutely conscious and awake, he has been for a long while. He just didn't feel like dealing with the bunch of people that was currently standing around his bed, so he was pretending to be asleep. Even with his eyes closed he was sure that Potter, his friends, Pansy and Blaise were killing each other with distrustful and mean glances since they entered the Hospital Wing after breakfast.
Harry considered himself a somewhat genius when it comes to life. He has always been, in his opinion, very bright and observant. With time however, he realized that it was all bullshit.
'Oh no,' Blaise gave him a fake-frightened look. 'You have a crush on me. Draco, I'm honored, but I think I prefer girls.'
Well, snow wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It was cold and white and fluffy. Draco was about to go back to his croissants, but Harry kept staring at him, very damn pleased about something.
'Why'd you bring your morons with you? Draco doesn't even like them.' Pansy snorted, still on the doorstep. 'It's not a train station, there's already too many of us here.'
'I'm gay' he muttered into his teacup. His friends went silent and he started to freak out again. He really doubted they would reject him for that alone, but he still panicked. It was very stressful for him, opening up about literally anything. 'Sorry' he stood up quickly and stormed out of the Great Hall, before they got the chance to say something. He had to admit, it did turn out a bit awkward.
'Tell us his name!' demanded Pansy, visibly happy. 'You have to, you started the conversation yourself! I can't believe you actually liked someone! I
. As it turned out, however, he was so visibly not straight, they have been suspecting it since around third grade (which means, a lot quicker than him). He also found out that there was no heterosexual explanation of his crush on Cedric Diggory or the fact that the guy invited him to the prefects' bathroom (he didn't go, sadly).
'It's not a circus, you can come tomorrow morning when I'll be discharging him.' she slammed the door shut right in front of his face.
'Actually, I could still eat something' admitted Ron, again, out of the blue. He looked around the long table at the Slytherins that were eating breakfast.
She laughed. 'You've been busy most of the summer, haven't had a single fight with Malfoy this year, he even almost stopped being mean to us. Besides, one time you spent a whole day wearing a Slytherin tie and you didn't even notice that something's wrong. I caught you staring at Malfoy more times than I can possibly count, and today you were waving at him during breakfast.
'I feel silly to say it,' he admitted. Blaise and Pansy were looking at him, carefully and uncertain, and it was hard for him to figure out what they were thinking. 'But I really like him. I know it has to be weird to you, but...'
“During my independent study with Remus, we were using the Boggart to help me fight back against my worst fear—the dementors.  Not only were we working on the Riddikulus incantation, but Remus was also trying to get me to cast my Patronus to fight the dementors.  Even though I wasn’t very good at it, the idea that I could fight back, that I didn’t have to become a willing victim of those horrible things, helped a lot.  What was healing in my work with Remus was the experience of fighting back and feeling that I was getting better at fighting back.”
After Harry's therapy session, Harry and Draco spend the evening together at 12 Grimmauld Place.  Something happens.
“I suppose that it did,” Harry said, “but it happened when I was younger than you are now, so I don’t remember.”
That evening after supper, Harry talked to Draco about what he and Keith had discussed in his therapy session earlier in the day.
When the opportunity presented itself, Draco asked Harry about the tapestry.  “I was surprised to see the changes to the family tree since I last laid eyes on it,” Draco said.  His eyes widened listening to Harry’s explanation.
After viewing and describing the memory, Harry let Petunia have it with both barrels. “How dare you withhold food from your nephew, your own sister’s only son, you fucking cow! Just because you were jealous that she had magic and you didn’t!  The most barbaric and inhuman person in the world wouldn’t keep food from a starving boy.  If anyone deserves the Cruciatus curse, it’s you.  Even the Ministry of Magic would exonerate me for casting it.”
“You’re right that in the past we did everything we could to prevent Muggles from knowing about our world, Harry,” Hermione explained. “But that’s not really sustainable anymore.  We can’t go around obliviating everybody who sees something magical.  We’d spend all our time doing that and not getting anything else accomplished.  Besides, more and more Muggle couples are having magical children.  That makes it so much more difficult to keep everything a secret.  The Ministry’s long-term strategy now is, one, to accept that eventually Muggles will know that magic exists and not be freaked out by it, and two, to ensure that the awareness of magic and reaction to it happens in a peaceful and orderly fashion.  The process will take time.  The goal won’t be achieved in our lifetime, but I sincerely believe that it will be achieved someday. Maybe not during Rose’s, Hugo’s or Teddy’s lifetime, or even their children’s lifetime, but someday.”
“I wish I had been more aware of what you were going through then, Harry,” Hermione said. “And if I had been a more powerful witch, I could have helped you more.”
Draco took a deep breath and said, “I don’t know.  It felt so good to hug you at my dad’s funeral and earlier today at the therapist’s office.  It felt right, you know?  The physical contact, I mean.”
“I’d like to try another,” Harry said.  “Even though it was tiring, it felt good to stand up to those tossers.”
Hilda reached over and touched him gently on the shoulder.  Keith inquired gently, “How are you feeling now, Harry?”
Keith greeted Harry and Draco in the waiting room and escorted them into his office.  He introduced Draco and Hilda, then explained the process of viewing Harry’s memories, the potential risks, and the safeguards in place, just as he had with Hermione and Ron two weeks earlier.
Keith interjected then, “He ran his fingers through your hair.  Tell me more about that, Harry.  What exactly happened?”
Harry continued, “There are plenty of bedrooms, so you’d have your pick. The only downside is that I’m not a particularly tidy person, so if you can put up with a bit of chaos . . .”
The two Gryffindors were sitting in Hermione’s large office in the Ministry of Magic.  After Kingsley Shacklebolt retired five months ago, Hermione had been unanimously voted in as the new Minister of Magic—the youngest person, witch or wizard, to ever hold the position.  As Harry was Head Auror for the British ministry, Hermione was now his boss.  He was intensely proud of her but at times he was not clear about whether she was talking to him as his superior or as his friend.  This was something they were both trying to work out.
“Sorry, so silly of me,” Hermione apologized. “Of course you would have the best Muggle technology available.  But in my defense I’ll remind you that I married into the Weasley family. Arthur Weasley is the sweetest man alive and he is fascinated by all things Muggle, but he still thinks the correct word is 'fellytone.'”
“I can help you figure out your side of things. You told me at Dr. Mathey’s office that you are here for me,” Harry said earnestly.  “Well, I’m here for you too, Draco.  Anything you need, just tell me and it’s yours.”
“I’ll give it a try,” Harry said.  He closed his eyes and tried to imagine an ideal version of Snape, a wizard who would be honest and own his mistakes.  Then assuming the role of this ideal Snape he began speaking in a voice that sounded remarkably like the Potions professor’s: “You’re right, Harry.  I was needlessly mean to you.  I looked at you and saw your father who had bullied me at Hogwarts when I was a kid.  I saw the man who had taken your mother away from me.  The man I hated. There were times I felt guilty for treating you the way I did.  I would think about your mother and know how sad and angry she would feel if she had witnessed our interactions.  But I couldn’t help myself.  I was so bitter about what your dad and his friends had done to me, and I focused all that bitterness on you.  That was wrong of me, but I hope that you will remember that I did protect you as well.”
“Not as much as I like,” Harry admitted.  “But I try to apparate at the Whimple house at least once a week for lunch with the kids and spend at least one day each weekend with them.  They have stayed here a few times since the divorce, but it’s been a while since their last visit.  I think they find this ancestral home a bit gloomy and spooky, and they miss the beauty of the countryside.”
“It’s a completely different space now,” Draco said with satisfaction.  “I can even see Scorpius playing with his collection of magical creatures down here.”
Draco lay on the sofa in the drawing room, while Harry sat on the floor, his back leaning against the edge of the sofa.  The wizards continued to sip firewhisky throughout the concert, eyes closed as they listened enrapt to Celestina’s beautiful voice singing hit song after hit song.  After the last song they remained silent.  Harry was enjoying the slight buzzed sensation from the Firewhisky when he felt Draco’s hand on the top of his head, gently running his fingers through Harry’s hair.  The Gryffindor froze. He was confused about what was happening and didn’t know how to respond.  Eventually he just said, “Draco?”
Harry was flabbergasted.  “Really, five Muggle psychologists just in London?  That suggests that there may be hundreds around the world.  And, if you think about professions other than psychology, then there are probably thousands and thousands of Muggles who know about magic. I thought the Ministry has to cast obliviate spells to erase the memories of Muggles who catch a glimpse of magic.”
“So, yes, it’s a scary prospect to tell Draco how you feel,” Keith acknowledged.  “If you were to disclose some of your feelings to him, is there a way you could do it that would feel less scary?”
Draco was astonished when Iphigenia appeared at his window and even more astonished when he read Harry’s message.  Try as he might, Draco couldn’t find fault with the letter.  Potter certainly hadn’t written it to appear virtuous, as no one other than Draco would know of its existence.  Nor did the letter seem phony. Harry had actually hinted at the enmity that had existed between Lucius and himself, writing, “Although your father and I never did see eye to eye, I know that Lucius Malfoy was a man of many parts, and I’m very sorry for your loss.”  Draco found himself admiring that sentence.  It was diplomatic, kind and, Draco suspected, sincere.
“I know you told me there were dark memories there,” Harry said, “but maybe we can dispel those dark memories and start creating happy ones.  I keep thinking about the beautiful garden, the fresh air, and the wide, open spaces which would be so good for Scorpius.  Besides, the manor will be his one day, so it makes sense for him to spend time there now.  And I’m sure that Astoria and Narcissa would prefer visiting Scorpius at the manor rather than here.  The only concern I have is whether your mother will have a problem with me living there with you.”
Draco remembered learning of Cedric’s death and attending his memorial service.  Reflecting on that period in his life, he also realized that he didn’t understand the enormity of the tragedy back then.  Death hadn’t yet touched Draco personally.  During his fourth year at Hogwarts, Draco still possessed that teenage feeling of invincibility and immortality.  Thinking about Cedric’s death now, he was struck by how devastating it must have been to his family and friends, and especially to Harry.  The least Draco could do would be to view Harry’s memory of the tragedy with him.
Draco couldn’t stop shaking his head, thinking about how different their childhoods had been.  While Harry had been starving in a tiny cupboard under the stairs, Draco had been feasting on delicious meals prepared by house-elves in the expansive rooms of the affluent manor.
Harry rose, nodding, and the gentleman held out his right hand. “Hello, Mr. Potter.  I’m Keith Mathey.  Thanks for coming in today.  Let’s head to my office, shall we?”
After viewing the memories in the pensieve, Hilda gave Harry a warm hug and whispered, “I’m so sorry that beast did that to you, Harry.”  He nodded, tears welling up in his eyes.
Harry took a moment to reflect before responding, “Can you give me an example of a safety concern that might arise, and what Ms. Lancaster might do to ensure my safety?”
Anxiety coursed through Harry when Draco said he was thinking about returning to Malfoy Manor.  He did not want Draco to leave the Black ancestral home.  He felt intense relief when Draco said that he preferred to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place because the manor was full of “dark memories.”
With a sly grin he added, “Plus, Remus used to always give me chocolate after a tough session, so I would prefer a Muggle psychologist who keeps a stash of excellent chocolate, preferably Montezuma, House of Dorchester, or Aphrodite.”
Before long Astoria entered the parlor and greeted him.  “This is a surprise, Draco.  To what do I owe the pleasure?” she said politely.  She sat down in a nearby chair and faced her husband.
“That would be brilliant,” Draco said.  A joyful image popped into his head--he and Harry reading bedtime stories to their sons.
Keith decided then to challenge Harry gently.  He said, “You told me that Draco said he had the urge to touch you. And that physical contact between you felt right to him.  That suggests to me that he has deep feelings for you.  I’m not saying that he’s in love with you, only Draco can know that.  But from what you’ve told me, it seems unlikely that he’ll reject you if you disclose at least some of your feelings for him.  I’m not suggesting that you declare your undying love for him.  But maybe you can tell him that you have strong feelings for him and are attracted to him?  Would that perhaps be worth the risk?”
“Indeed it has,” Draco said with a grimace.  “It’s getting impossible to continue living there so long as the bloody media and the vindictive public remain obsessed about my father’s demise.  My mother escaped to Paris right after Dad was taken away to Azkaban.  Evidently she made the right choice.”
"Don't fight. You didn't send a name when you signed us up, so nothing can be done anymore, but for next year I'm sure you did."
And his plan to tell the principal about the contest was pretty easy. They would make a presentation at the last supper before the students went home to their families and Draco would take it upon himself to convince her over the holidays by inviting her to tea. It was well known that Draco had a talent for afternoon tea, he was a pureblood after all.
Draco appreciates that Harry is stupid enough to conclude something like that before he can open his own mouth.
"Seriously? Or can't you really live without sticking your nose into other people's affairs?" Harry snorts.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek and sighs heavily. "Don't think I care so much about you, Potter."
Malfoy picks up the chart with the list of students who will be staying for Christmas and quickly reads it. "Six Gryffindors, thirteen Ravenclaws seniors; I guess it's because of the N.E.W.T.s. Also two Hufflepuffs and four Slytherins.
Why did he turn to Draco Malfoy, the potions professor he knew not as a jerk who liked to make his life miserable but as a professor no more than two months ago? Why him and not Neville? Why not his ex-girlfriend who came out as a pansexual in the Quidditch finals in Ireland and who was the talk of gossip in all the wizarding journals?
"What is a tracking potion?" Eileen Jefferson asks, raising his hand. Draco clicks his tongue and points at her sitting on his desk. He crosses his left leg and rolls up his shirt, but stops when he plans to lift his left sleeve.
That day he puts on lotion, a new one that he ordered from the Pansy perfumery and that came to him in the Parkinson's owl three days ago. It was the same one he used in important events in his family, the one that smelled of peppermint. He doesn't cover himself as he would have done in early January and, on the contrary, takes off layers of clothing, leaving only the usual emerald silk shirt under the tunic and the gray vest that hangs around the body in the waist area. He doesn't wear a tie and swaps it for his old student scarf. He fixes his hair by ruffling everything, setting aside all the hair wax that he usually uses.
Haven's gaze drifted and she gasped for a few seconds, there it was! Of course she left the dirty work to him. He wanted to yell at the girl for not considering that McGonagall would slit her throat if he asked her permission to enter a contest that they were in fact already entered.
Harry is about to speak when Draco interrupts him saying that they are not friends at all. The woman only says that friends or not, if it hadn't been for him, no one would have found him until the next morning.
"I'm afraid we all know the François family, so you'd better go home, the party's over," Harry says, pushing the other students towards the exit with a much more relaxed tone. Except for Evan, whom he of course takes to the infirmary to deliver something for the pain. The boys say goodbye to Evan and leave laughing toward their homes. "I think you should write to Principal McGonagall as soon as possible."
Draco picks up a lock of his hair and runs it behind his ear in the best attempt he can make to appear relaxed. -Hello.
The reproaches are not long in coming, Jerome is furious and many boys are questioning them. Slytherin hasn't lost a single time since Draco started in command and to his pride it's best to keep things that way. Malfoy doesn't want to lose, but there are more important things.
Of course he didn't expect to find Harry Potter there. Not at that time, not in that place, not talking to him.
"I received beautiful gifts, Professor, if you're an admirer of Rousell, the very famous Irish opera singer, you'll know it, but since I doubt that..." she casts a quick glance at Evan, who is already rolling his eyes. "Well, I don't think my classmates know her, but my parents took me to her recital on the night of the Yule, it was splendid, accompanying a ritual as sacred as Yule with the voice of a goddess like her is simply perfect, but you It's a Malfoy, right? So you must know."
He stands still looking at the ceiling of his room. Waiting for the dream to come back to him, he still remains quite awake.
"Are you not the least bit upset?" Draco stops him by taking him by the arm. Neville denies with a smile.
"Pay attention at every step, today I'll do enough potion for everyone, but next time everyone will take care of creating their own dragon mucus, okay?" A sonorous assent is heard and Draco sees Harry take nods with the other students, without realizing a slight smile is drawn on his lips.
Teddy soon appears at the door of the great dining room accompanied by Victoire Weasley, Neville sees out of the corner of his eye how Connor and Evan whisper to each other before they all yell a loud "surprise!" which causes Teddy to change his hair color from pale pink to bright red. A smile is drawn on his face when all his companions run to ruffle him hard.
"You know what? Sounds good, Ernie, uh, maybe I will." Ernie smiles back at Harry and is about to speak when a voice yells from his pocket. It's Hannah's voice, Neville acknowledges.
"I'll go find Pomfrey." Neville stands up as he leaves the room as fast as he can to avoid facing a Draco in a tantrum.
Would he have leaned into Quidditch? The Chudley Canons were always at the table in any discussion on the subject, there were even rumors about Potter being recruited to play the Caerphilly Catapults as a seeker, but turning them down for an Auror position in the ministry.
"Cassie? Who is?" Another female voice comes from within until a plump blonde woman comes to the side of whom Draco assumes is Cassie. "In the name of the lion's teeth! You are identical to James. Cassie, what are you doing there? Step aside and let them pass. I am Marlene McKinnon, I studied with James and Lily, this is my wife Dorcas, but as you can see, she is speechless with shock."
"Teachers, please take the students to their compartments, we have to avoid a ruckus. Welcome Professor Weasley, I see that Madame Hooch has done a great job finding a replacement." Professor Flitwick shakes Ron's hand, and he nods in the same way with a slight blush on his cheeks.
"Hey, idiot, you left your damn boxers in my room." Draco stomps into the orchard. He stops when he sees Ernie next to Neville, and then a smile replaces the scowl on his pale traitorous face. "... MacMillan."
"No, who would take him to a game?" Fresia McKinnon faces with supreme calm. She is like that, except for Quidditch.
The bell on the bar door echoes in his eardrums, the alcohol making him more sensitive and much less tolerant with this dying noise.
"We try to stop her." Teddy Lupin muttered from the back rubbing his arm in embarrassment. He was so much like his father, he even had the same stooped posture, he was slim and had grown almost two feet since he was eleven. If you gave him a couple of scars and a bigger nose he would be identical to Lupin.
The three men arrive at the gates of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes at nine o'clock. The snow wasn't being a pain in the ass that night so they weren't wearing any spells to keep warm and just wore coats.
Draco shakes his head. "I was behaving like a stupid child." Neville laughs and he imitates it. They don't lose their habits and it's a good thing. "What happened to Macmillan?"
he means, because really all he had planned for that weekend was to go have tea with Pansy like they did when they had time, which translated to "when Blaise isn't around" because they weren't in good shape terms, because Draco was heartbroken because of him and because Blaise was afraid that Draco was going to tell Pansy that they hooked up before they were together and in those lapses in which they ended the relationship.
Harry smiled wryly down at the first-years before fixing a look on the young boy. “Nothing wrong with Slytherin,” he said. The child was too stunned to reply, so Harry continued, “I’ve known some excellent Slytherins. I was nearly in Slytherin myself.”
“I welcome you all to another year at Hogwarts,” she began grandly, hands outstretched to mimic the wings of the owl, to a hushed ripple of awe and delight from the assembled students.
“Wow,” said Harry, trying to keep from mentally tallying all the other things he had done for Ron in the past. At the top of the list was
“And would you have wanted me?” Draco returned, his eyes narrowing as he turned to face Harry. “Even if I had decided to help you, and let my family die for that, can you honestly tell me after everything that you would have wanted my help? Or that I would have had a single friend on your side?”
“I’ve told you what I’m able to say. I’m sorry Harry,” he said, sighing with what sounded like genuine remorse, “but you’re putting me in an impossible position. I can’t lose this job, I’ve got a family of my own to take care of now. I know you want to help, but I trust Kingsley, and he doesn’t want you getting involved with issues that are already under control. You have to trust the system a little bit, and not take everything on yourself.”
Hermione looked leagues happier than either of the boys put together, and her smile only faltered when she glanced between the two of them and saw that they were not nearly as excited as she was. “Well, you should be pleased, shouldn’t you?” she asked, in the sort of lofty voice that was only a hair away from agitation. “I’d give anything to have a break from work right now, and here you are complaining. Honestly!” Her fluffy hair bounced around her head as she slumped back in her seat, arms folding across her chest.
When she caught sight of their bags, Hermione rolled her eyes, though the smile never left her face. “All right,” she said, steeling herself. “What did you get?”
The students would be arriving at the castle at any moment now, and filing into the Great Hall for their house sorting and arrival feast. Harry skipped down the stairs as quickly as his legs would allow him, and upon rounding the corner at the bottom, nearly crashed into a pair of familiar figures in the next hallway.
Hagrid shook his head, his watery eyes turning happy. “Havin’ ya here is enough. Go on then, have another rock cake. I’ve never known yeh to have less than three.”
“Fine,” Harry said, his eyes fixing on the exact point he was looking for. “Then I’ll see you later.”
“So not by choice, then?” Harry confirmed. Bill said nothing, regarding him with inscrutable blue eyes.
“You knew,” he muttered, as Harry grinned apologetically, “you knew that I had a headache and now you’re going to have them blow the place up with me right here.”
Draco Malfoy had woken up on the morning of September the second from a nightmare so vivid that he staggered directly to the sink to vomit, his insides roiling as his body struggled to expel the rot. Gasping ragged breaths, shocking his face with cold water from the tap, he reminded himself bitterly that it was impossible to remove something that was all in his head. All those Legilimency lessons and he couldn’t read his own mind.
By the time they arrived back at the castle, Ron was pacing the courtyard outside the main entry, followed by the bemused gazes of the upperclassmen who were spending their free periods outside. When he saw Harry and Bill, the frown on his face slowly melted away into a look of relief.
“Where have I heard that before?” Harry muttered darkly, too irate to say anything else. Bill offered him a reassuring smile, which only annoyed Harry further.
“No, really,” Harry said, trying not to laugh at the way Hermione crossed her arms and pretended to sulk. Ron’s face visibly changed with relief when Harry came to his defence. “He didn’t, I promise. I think you’ll actually like it.”
“And you’re sure it was him?” Ron was saying, his mouth hanging open disbelievingly as he stopped with his spoon halfway to his mouth, a piece of chicken sliding unnoticed off the end and splashing back into the broth below.
Harry folded the note back up and tossed it onto his desk, too stupefied by the dim warmth of the candlelight and the torpor of heavy food to think about much aside from collapsing back into the comfort of his newfound four-poster bed. He stifled a yawn even as the tranquillising thought surfaced that he wouldn’t have to be awake until gone ten in the morning, when he would need to rouse Ron from next door to go visit the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom if they wanted to get their meeting in before lunchtime. This was, in some ways, far superior to Auror field work. At least the food was better, and the hours were kinder. Harry contented himself with these sorts of hazy thoughts, sluggish from the feast and the wine, as he manage to ready himself to sleep and collapse into the warm cocoon of crimson blankets upon his bed.
“Alright, then. Be safe.” Her eyes darted in the direction of the front hall, and Draco could tell she was wondering if he had seen the dead peacock. He plastered on a half-smile as though he had not, endured her kiss on the cheek, and returned to the fireplace in the main antechamber. Narcissa stood and watched him from the doorway, a mixture of sadness and concern warring on her features, as Draco stepped into the swirling green flames and vanished from the house, leaving Narcissa to stare around her at their resounding walls and wonder when this room had gotten so large.
“I lose sleep over all of them,” Harry snapped back, then instantly closed his mouth. The words had been more honest than he’d meant to say.
The door to the classroom was open when Harry knocked, the door swinging open with a metallic groan on its hinges that made him wince. “Bill?” He called softly; no one answered. He glanced around. The office door was closed, but light was flickering out from under the threshold, and Harry was sure he could hear someone speaking in the room beyond. He should have left right then, he knew it, but the instinct to interfere was still there. Cautiously, he began creeping across the ancient slats of flooring and ascended the stone steps to the office.
“Are you heading out?” She asked in hushed tones, giving him a brisk once-over and smoothing the sleeves of his jacket with small but firm hands.
“They’ve got this new thing, George says, that’s like an enchanted beetle; you can sit it anywhere and it will help you listen in on conversations. Inspired by Rita Skeeter, no doubt, but it’s definitely an improvement on the extendable ears.”
“Reacquaint yourself with the grounds?” she offered. Harry nodded. “By all means, Potter, have the run of the place.”
“Yeah,” Draco echoed distantly. He was still staring at the forest below, his eyes unfocused and glassy. Even to his own ears his voice sounded far away, as if he were listening down a tunnel. “Yeah, I get that.”
“Figured they’d still have someone keeping an eye on me.” Draco took the opportunity to give Harry a once-over, a smile like a razor slash crossing his face. “I’m deeply insulted that it’s you.”
“You’ve got a lot to answer for,” Harry agreed. He squinted upward at the swath of stars splashed across the sky like a shower of sparks and felt a trickle of calm seep into his body at the knowledge that Draco couldn’t curse him, though he knew better than to ask why. “But I don’t know that hexing your fingers together is going to fix any of it.”
” Harry said, grimacing into his mug. “And I’ve already had a couple ask me to sign theirs, so you can save the trouble of mocking me for it, I’ve been embarrassed plenty.”
“What are you even doing up here?” Harry asked, ignoring Draco’s ultimatum and finally lowering his wand. He took a side-step to put some more distance between himself and Draco; he didn’t feel completely sure Draco wouldn’t pitch him over the railing given the chance.
“So that’s it, then?” asked Hermione as she flopped down into a chair at their usual table in Wandering Wendelin’s Pub, startling Ron so forcefully that he dropped a chip halfway to his mouth and watched morosely as it landed on the floor with a visceral smack.
“I don’t want to hear about the sex life of my two best friends, thank you very much,” Harry cut in sharply, throwing up his hands to block the view of the red mark Ron was now demonstrating on his jugular.
McGonagall commanded the presence on the room when she stepped up to the podium. The gilded wings of the owl figurehead snapped open with a sound like a blade on a whetstone, which echoed loudly enough through the silent chamber to sound deafening.
Ron groaned. “We’re adults, and so is he. Can’t we just tell him he can’t cook and never have to meet him for lunch again?”
Muffled voices were carrying from under the door. Harry paused at the top of the steps, breath sticking in his throat, and strained to make out what was being said in the ensuing silence. The first speaker was undoubtedly Bill, but he was followed by another, agitated, achingly familiar voice...
“I’m afraid that may be best at present. You’ve caught me at a singularly unfortunate time.” The sound of shuffling papers continued, and Harry took that as an end to their conversation, and began picking his way across the office to the enormous oak door hunched in the far wall.
Harry turned his back to the room once again, tugging Ron with him into a huddle with their shoulders together. “Did you read the plan for today?” He hissed softly, feeling Ron’s shoulder lift against his in a shrug.
why you should be sympathetic!” Draco roared. Their argument had reached a fever pitch, and their ears rang in the silence as Draco’s words hung between them. He looked equal parts angry and upset, unsure whether to yell or cry as each emotion fought for control over his features. “Even
Silence descended, broken only by the whistling of wind through the spires of the castle. Harry briefly regretted making Draco close off like that; this was quite possibly the first occasion where they had managed to have a civil conversation, and he had so many questions about why Draco was back, and why he was in the astronomy tower so late at night. As it stood, he assumed any such line of questioning would have a similar effect to the silencing charm that seemed to have descended over the tower.
They’d tried the bottle in the shop, not entirely convinced it wasn’t a carefully disguised prank, but it had worked as intended. Harry thought it smelled of some kind of earthy soap, like sandalwood, and Ron had smelled vanilla.
Silence descended, a smothering blanket over their heads. Harry felt like he was suffocating the longer he stood there, his skin prickling with the strangeness of it all. Two years ago, the boy beside him had tried to kill him in the second floor bathroom, and now they were speaking as if none of that had ever happened.  A lot had changed since they were at school together, but Harry was still unable to look Draco in the face without feeling a twinge of unfettered rage.
A sudden thought occurred to him, and Harry felt a weight like a boulder pressing into his chest. Fingers shaking, he reached into his rucksack and produced the Marauder’s Map from the outside pocket. Ron’s eyes widened.
Harry and Ron exchanged a grim look when Hagrid’s back was turned. It seemed not even the tea was safe anymore.
“Yeah, but you weren’t, were you?” Ron countered. “Besides, you have more right than anyone else to hate them all.”
Hagrid began to mop at his streaming eyes. “Nah, you don’t gotta do that,” he warbled. “The Headmistress’s already been down to fix things up, an’ there ain’t no wizard alive I trust more’n Professor McGonagall.”
“Hey, you break my only sister’s heart, I get to have a few jabs at you,” Ron said, swiping Hermione’s pint and downing the dregs of that as well. “Anyway, we should get going, mum’s already gonna box my ears for showing up late. Now she won’t even have time before dinner to interrogate me and Hermione about wedding plans...”
“Thank you for this.” Bill slapped a hand down on the cover of the book. “Now I’d suggest you get some rest. You’re teaching tomorrow, and those kids are counting on you.”
“You’re not the only one who had to grow up too fast, Malfoy,” Harry countered. Bitterness rose in his throat like bile as the conversation turned to his least favourite topic.  “We were all there for the war.”
The Ravenclaw who had spoken up shrunk back into their seat, shoulders hunched to hide their reddening ears.
It was eerie to wander the halls of the school in its empty state, each footfall reverberating around the stone chambers as though he were a dragon stepping with enormous clawed feet. On more than one occasion he turned down a hallway to see a house elf polishing a suit of armour or straightening a portrait frame, and sent the poor creature running with a violent gasp of shock and the resounding slap of large, bare feet on the flagstones.
Ron froze halfway to picking up his chip off the floor and straightened up before Hermione had a chance to gawk at him in horror. “Wasn’t gonna,” he mumbled unconvincingly. “I was just going to bin it. But yeah, we’re off for the term. Robards released us this morning.”
Ron snorted. “Reckon any of the kids have that new broomstick they made for you? What’s it called, Light-something...?”
“I’d guessed you wouldn’t leave me alone after yesterday,” he sighed, resigned, as Harry fell into step beside him. Resignation was, at least, better than anger. Harry had never seen Bill angry and was beginning to realise with dread that he never wanted to. “Saw me on your map, did you?”
Hagrid sighed, slumping down into his chair until the wood creaked a low, keening protest. “It’s the thestrals,” he began miserably. Fang shuffled over and rested his head on Hagrid’s knee, giving a quiet burp that made Harry wince across the table. Hagrid simply stroked the dog’s head, unaware of Harry’s worry or the froth of congealed drool that was now dripping onto his trousers.
“May I help you with something?” she continued, a dry smile playing on her thin mouth. Something about the lilt of her Scottish brogue was both sedate and terror-inducing at once. Harry realised with a rush of embarrassment that she was sorting through a large sheaf of parchment papers, sending them to different piles about her desk with languid flicks of her wand. There was a tin of biscuits on the corner of the desk as well; as Harry dithered, her expression softened into something reminiscent and fond, and she indicated it with a nod. Harry shuffled over, careful not to track any ash across the polished wood floor, and took a biscuit from the tin as McGonagall’s eyes turned back to her work.
Harry’s voice had risen very quickly in agitation, and Draco dared a glance at him to see that he was genuinely angry now, his face pinched in the centre as his brows lowered behind his glasses.
“Look at him, slick git,” Ron muttered, jerking his head at the high table. “Bet he thinks he’s gonna be the cool professor this year.”
The classrooms were quiet. Dust motes drifted across the watery patches of early evening light seeping through the windows. The courtyards were empty and immaculate, every shrub and blade of grass perfectly arranged and pruned, waiting for the onslaught of students to arrive and trample it all back down again under the torrent of their loafers. Many of the portraits in the grand staircase were empty as their subjects gathered together in concentrated droves for parties, celebrating their last nights of misbehaviour before the new term began. When Harry passed the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, the Fat Lady was nowhere to be seen.
“I brought your book back.” Harry walked forward and placed the volume on the edge of the desk, then stepped back. As Bill went to tuck the book back into place on a shelf behind him, Harry took the opportunity to take full stock of the room around him. Two bookcases, one filled with dusty old tomes, one displaying a variety of strange relics. The desk, one office chair, two chairs for students. Two latticed windows on the far wall, peeking out the windows of the tower onto the grounds below. A large folding trunk that had been configured into a stand for a file organiser. On the left wall, a fireplace, lit despite the warmth of the early autumn sunlight filtering in through the windows. Harry paused upon the fire, squinting at it until Bill turned back around and noticed with a quiet, “ah.”
going to be the cool professor this year,” Harry grumbled back. “Rotten luck for us, but there you have it.”
Harry wondered, as he stood at his perch on the highest spire, if he was really cut out for this. Saving the world had been predestined, something he never had time or inclination to question. He was told it was a job only he could do, so he did it, dutifully. But was he truly the best man for this job? Surely real-world experience didn’t translate seamlessly to the classroom. What if he managed to ruin the next generation of Hogwarts students? If they all failed their OWLs, he would be the obvious one to blame. The worries ricocheted about inside his head like bludgers until he felt a palpable ache behind his temples, and groaning turned away from the balustrade.
Harry didn’t argue this, just kept walking in stride with Bill, focusing on stretching his steps to match Bill’s longer legs. “I’m stubborn like that,” he agreed.
“No, I’d reckon not,” Harry said thickly. Hermione reached over and laid a hand meaningfully on Ron’s forearm, as if to say,
When Harry returned to Grimmauld Place that evening, it was to find a crisp parchment envelope sitting in the center of the faded old dining table, staring up at him with shining emerald ink that had scarcely had time to dry. No doubt Kreacher had left it out for him. Harry crossed to the table, dusting a bit of glittering Floo Powder off his jacket sleeves along the way, and took up the envelope with delicate fingers. It was almost too perfect to open, its penned address neat and uniform, its stamped wax seal in a perfectly formed circle, a red so startling against the cream of the paper that it looked like a globule of blood had been spattered down onto its center, aside from the elegant lines of the school crest in its centre. Harry had recognised the handwriting immediately upon inspection, but it was still with a feeling of wonderment that he opened the letter and unfolded the single sheet contained within, allowing his eyes to travel along the paper.
“It’s because you always had shit taste in friends, I thought,” Draco said. Harry bristled and shifted to throw him a murderous glare.
“Oh yeah, sure. Hermione’s fine, by the way. Don’t know if you’ve seen her since your aunt tortured her, or your friend tried to kill her.”
Ron arrived the next day and spent most of the afternoon settling into his room, the mirror image of Harry’s and not much farther along the hall. While he shuffled his belongings through the Floo, Harry ascended the Astronomy Tower and arranged his forearms against the railing to look out over the distant pointed roofs of Hogsmeade Village. The train arrived just as darkness was beginning to gather again, a distant streak of red that slithered into the station and crouched between the rooftops, belching steam. Students began appearing from the carriages in droves and swarmed in packs toward the waiting coaches at the end of the road like a swarm of ants emerging from a mound.
“Harry, I know there’s history between you and Draco Malfoy,” Bill said measuredly. “But you’ve known me for a long time, too. And I hope you know better than to think I would keep anything secret that would put you in danger.”
Hermione met Harry and Ron at the Three Broomsticks with pencil shavings on her blouse and a smile on her face. With the sun going down outside, the temperature had plummeted from the mountain air, and her cheeks were bright red as she flopped into the chair next to Ron’s, greeting him with a quick kiss that Harry pretended not to see to save Ron some embarrassment.
“It was my father’s,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure what made him say it, but Bill did not seem startled by the revelation; rather, he simply nodded slowly, looking thoughtful.
Ron shook his head, a look of determination settling into his face. “I want to. He would want me to. He’d tell me to stop fretting and shove me right through the door, and he’d insist I spend all my money on his rubbish.” Ron blinked furiously to dissipate the glaze coming over his eyes. “This is the first time I can afford to spend all my money on this rubbish, Harry, so come on. Let’s make it count.”
Ron got to his feet wordlessly and circled around Hagrid to throw his arms as far as he could reach around his neck. Hagrid’s sobs, which had begun to melt into anger, returned full tilt, and Harry took advantage of the moment to think. What would possibly kill a thestral? Surely something so skeletal wouldn’t provide a food source for another creature. Besides, few would ever venture close enough to the school to hunt their creatures.
“I’m being monitored within an inch of my life. Of course she knows I’m here.” He gave Harry another quick once-over, decided he wasn’t about to get hexed, and turned his back on him to lean against the railing again. “If no one sent you and I’m not needed anywhere, then shut up or piss off. You’re ruining a perfectly nice night.”
“I’d just feel a lot better if we’d gotten them all by now,” Harry heaved with a sigh, carding his fingers through his hair. By contrast to Hermione’s carefully styled curls and sharp business attire, he would venture that he and Ron looked as though they hadn’t slept in a week, hair ruffled and eyes dark, dressed still like they were preparing to trek across the highlands in search of Horcruxes. But of course, that was all over now. The only remaining trace of Voldemort lay in his followers, a handful of whom were still scattered to the wind despite Harry and Ron’s best efforts.
Ron coughed and swallowed hard to clear his throat. “You did what? Robards has other shit to worry about, I don’t think he’s gonna answer.”
The applause was thunderous for Neville alone, but by the time McGonagall got to Harry’s name the din of chatter within the hall was deafening, students beginning to rise out of their seats, craning their necks to get a better look at the three figures stood in the entryway. McGonagall abided the unrest for only a moment before the sound of a magically amplified clap jolted every eye in the room back to the forward dais.
“Er, right,” Harry said lamely. “Plus, I’m overseeing practice here this weekend anyway. It’s the best McGonagall can do for me, since I’m too old to play.”
Hagrid answered the door with a booming laugh and a crushing hug that enveloped the both of them easily and squeezed all the air out of their lungs. By the time Harry’s feet hit the floor again he was winded and gasping to suck in air through a windpipe that felt crushed to the capacity of a straw. All the while, Fang the boarhound danced around their ankles, barking in low timbre and startling a flock of starlings from a nearby tree. Hagrid ushered them inside with hands the size of frying pans and closed the door behind them, humming merrily as he went to stoke the hearth where a copper kettle was beginning to whistle. Fang walked circles around Harry’s ankles as he and Ron settled into their usual spots on the window seat, then with an enormous sigh flopped down onto the floorboard and began licking at the toes of Harry’s shoes.
“Sorry, sorry,” he brushed off, waving a hand and getting back to his feet. “I Flooed to Hermione’s last night. Barely slept a wink.”
Ron shook his head. “Nope. No way. If I go stalking my brother about the grounds I’ll hear about it at home for the rest of my life. Mum always sides with Bill. She thinks he invented magic or something. You’re going alone.”
“And he succeeded!” Bill supplied unnecessarily. “Now get out of here, you’ve more than done your duty for today. Harry said it was a long first day. Go and have a drink for me.” He saluted them lazily with two fingers to his temple as they parted, Ron and Harry back down the rise, Bill through the enormous oak doors of the castle.
“Bill said he had a meeting today,” Harry explained, activating the map and beginning to flip frantically through the accordion-tabbed panels. “He didn’t say where or why.”
“No way! I’m thrilled that you’re not shagging my sister. Best thing you ever did for me was split up.”
Harry’s anger flared up behind his eyes, tearing through him in a blaze. “I wouldn’t have thought so either,” he said accusingly. Bill looked momentarily sad, then quickly became resolute.
At some point that evening, he had to return to Grimmauld Place via the Floo to retrieve his belongings and swipe some more substantial food from the cupboards, carefully treading around to not attract the attention of Kreacher, who didn’t enjoy speaking to him anyway. He hardly felt like he breathed again until he reemerged in the Hogwarts guest room, dragging a packed trunk and polishing off the last of a hastily constructed sandwich. There was a bottle of firewhisky somewhere in the base of his trunk that he intended to crack open before turning in — another excellent benefit of returning as a teaching assistant. McGonagall wouldn’t fault him for it, at any rate; he was fairly certain he had caught a bottle of the same stuff in the cabinet behind her desk.
The rock cakes and stoat sarnies were unavoidable, as they always were at their first visit of the year. They had both learned by now to buy their coats with large pockets so as to hide more food, but Fang proved equally useful with his insatiable ability to consume anything [remotely] edible. After feeding the dog his second sandwich, Harry began to worry that he might be sick later on and give away the entire operation. Much to Fang’s disappointment, he turned to tucking his rock cakes into the large pockets of his jacket instead.
The markers Harry was looking for were down by the lake. Two names scrawled beside one another in razor thin lettering, punctuated by tiny maroon footprints like a spattering of dried blood across the page. He hastened down the steps to the lakeshore, zipping his jacket against the chill wind off the water as he went. Somewhere just beyond his view, on a beach partially hidden by the tree line, Bill was once again meeting with Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, Merlin, no, none of that ‘sir’ rubbish,” Harry groaned, and was met by a smattering of laughter from the group. “Harry and Ron, okay? We’re not that old, I promise.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to come along, Harry?” Hermione asked. “Molly’s got the spare room set up for us already, you could take Ron’s old bedroom for the weekend...”
“Well, I wasn’t worried about you, mate,” Ron lied quickly. “I knew you’d be busy doing brilliant stuff out here, didn’t want to bother you was all.”
Ron and Harry kicked off their chairs and trooped down the steps, Bill following them a pace behind. Bill peeled off when they passed the staff room in search of food, but Harry grabbed Ron by the arm and dragged him along the corridor to audible protest.
Harry hadn’t seen him in nearly a year, and their last meeting was not one either of them would soon forget. Harry, swearing softly to himself under his breath, nervously tapping his wand against the side of his leg, had sat in silent discomfort until it was his turn to speak. Hermione had gone with him, sat beside him, held his hand more for her benefit than his own, whispered encouragement that did nothing to deaden the feeling of solid lead filling his chest cavity. He had spent the preceding weeks to that day unable to shake the feeling that he was doing something that even he should never have considered, above and beyond the call of duty. He had sway with the Ministry following the war — with everyone, really, somehow seeming even more famous than he had been in the years before Voldemort’s return, when everyone who met him had rumbled his name back to him in an awed wheeze and addressed all their questions to the mark on his forehead rather than his eyes. It had come down to him what happened to them, and he had made the decision to let them walk free, a decision that had haunted him for months after, wondering each night whether he would awaken the next morning to a headline in the paper that was a direct result of his decision. But that morning never came, and he had gradually forgotten about the Malfoy family, no longer worrying about what they were up to behind closed doors. That was, until now, when he heard the unmistakable voice of Draco Malfoy seeping through the crack beneath the doorway and felt every synapse in his body fire a sudden, urgent bolt of panic and rage that kept him frozen on the top step until he heard the voices quiet down, footsteps cross the room, and silence descend once more over the classroom. Harry waited another moment on the landing to give himself plausible deniability, then quietly shifted his way to the threshold and knocked twice on the door.
A large gaggle of young students awaited them when they approached the entrance hall; judging from the raucous din of chatter seeping from under the Great Hall’s closed doors, the rest of the school was already inside awaiting the arrival of the first-year students for the sorting. Harry, Ron and Neville slipped down the final flight of stairs and waited against the back wall for the students to be escorted in. One child, wild-haired and teary-eyed, was whispering urgently to a friend who was clearly not invested in the conversation.
“You going to kill me?” He asked. Harry’s grip adjusted on the handle of his wand. His arm wasn’t visibly shaking, but Draco could feel the faintest tremor in the tip of the wand where it connected with his throat. Despite himself, he couldn’t keep down a dry laugh. “You know something? I almost wish you had it in you.”
He turned around slowly, not wanting to startle his company, the heels of his hands digging into the railing, tracing a volute on the underside absently with the tip of a finger. “Don’t you ever get tired,” he addressed the empty room, “of failing to spy on me under that wretched blanket of yours?”
“I should thank you for that, I suppose,” Draco continued, stunning Harry so effectively that he nearly toppled over the railing himself. “Though the more I consider it, the less I think I deserved it.”
“He’s not the bleeding Minister of Magic, he’s my stupid brother!” Ron moaned a little too loudly, causing several of the students at the nearest seats to glance around and gape in amazement at the sight of the trio in the doorway. Harry desperately held a finger to his lips in panic just as he heard McGonagall begin to mention them.
“Don’t be sorry. And definitely don’t call me sir.” Harry put on what he hoped was a reassuring smile. “Be happy that you’re at Hogwarts, whatever house you’re in.”
“Goodnight, then,” he muttered, ducking out. Bill raised a hand halfway in farewell. As soon as Harry had left and the door to the adjoining room swung resoundingly closed, Bill dropped his forehead heavily onto the desk and groaned.
Harry’s instinct was to ask more questions that would likely go unanswered, but some fire was burning deep in his chest, and it spurred him on in a rage. “If you have nothing to hide from me, then you can tell me what’s going on!”
Bill laughed harshly at this. “Only partially. But do you think they’d have asked you or Ron to do it?”
“Plus Ron can’t spell for anything,” Harry added, earning himself a sharp jab to the gut from Ron’s elbow.
“We’re meeting Hermione tonight!” Ron shouted after him. Harry waved acknowledgement from the door, throwing his coat on as he closed it behind him and left Ron sitting alone in the staff room.
Harry finally stepped up to the balustrade, keeping a good two meters away from his company and trying his best to hide the tremor in his fingers. It had been over a year since they had exchanged more than a passing glance with one another. Neither seemed to know what terms they were on now.
Neville stepped within earshot now, tapping them both on the shoulders gently. “Oi,” he whispered. “We can stand in the doorway to watch, McGonagall’s going to do announcements soon.”
“Er—been trying to cut back,” Harry lied quickly, even as Fang began to press his nose into Harry’s coat pocket with interest.
“I was just thinking that before tomorrow, I might have a chance to, er...” Harry trailed off, glancing around him as though the word that had eluded him was resting somewhere among the crevices of the office.
“They’re children,” said Harry flatly, feeling a touch of annoyance rise in the back of his throat. He folded his arms, pointedly looking away from Ron, into the hall. “What did you want me to tell them?”
Their drinks arrived, and the flow of conversation turned to work, and classes, and finally their plans for the next two days.
“I am a wee bit busy this evening, unfortunately, with the start of term tomorrow,” she said, in a tone that was meant to be apologetic but only came across as brusque. Harry hastened to finish chewing his bite of biscuit — he had been hoping for chocolate, but it turned out to be filled, disappointingly, with only raisins and walnuts.
“ “You are really making it difficult to keep my promises,” he warned. “But I have a feeling you’re not going to just let it go, whatever anyone tells you.”
“Certainly, master,” Kreacher rasped, sweeping into such a low bow that the chain around his neck nearly slipped off. Harry never knew how to respond to this kind of treatment, so he opted, with a flood of utter embarrassment, to depart with a casual little wave that made Kreacher’s eyes squint up in confusion.
“You don’t own the castle, Potter,” Draco said, looking just shy of amused, before his tone turned bitter again. “And you don’t get to interrogate me on my movements; I’m a free man.”
“Robards promised us that the rest would be handled,” Ron reminded them all unnecessarily. “Besides, they’re all too thick on their own to try anything. Bet Greyback’s sleeping in a cave somewhere, the fucking loon, so we’re just as like to never hear from him again.”
“Yeah, I get it.” Ron sat forward, taking up his spoon again. “We’ve had to keep an eye on our backs our whole life. You don’t lose that in a year.”
Harry heaved a fond sigh, casting a look around at his two best friends. Still by his side, after all these years. “To trusting the system,” he muttered grudgingly, and watched Hermione’s mouth twist into an encouraging smile.
What did that mean? Bill was teaching him? Why would the Ministry sanction more education for a former Death Eater? Robards had been furious with Harry for defending Draco and Narcissa Malfoy at court and keeping them out of prison. It was unfathomable to Harry that he would pivot so quickly to encouraging his continued learning. Did the family even have their wands back? Harry had returned Draco’s to the Ministry after the war, but it wasn’t outside the realm of possibility that they were on magical probation. None of it added up, which spurred Harry more quickly down the hill. He hardly realised he hadn’t been checking the Marauder’s Map until he approached the edge of the forest and skidded to an abrupt halt as a red haired figure emerged from the trees.
Ron returned, pushing the hovering dummy along with his wand. “Alright then,” Harry shouted, raising his voice to be heard over the din of excited chatter. “Let’s start with stunning spells.
“So what’s all this about, then, Hagrid?” Ron finally dared to ask. “You looked upset when we got here.”
The students nodded vigorously, just as the doors to the hall began to swing open with a great sigh from their enormous hinges. The assembled students began to file into the hall, and Harry waved the pair along until he and his friends were once again alone in the entryway.
“Come on,” Neville’s voice hissed, suddenly very close to Harry’s ear. A hand simultaneously gripped the back of his arm, tugging him insistently away from the door. “There’s food in the staff room as well, and if we stay here we’ll get mobbed the second McGonagall’s done talking.”
“Don’t remember you ever getting an ear pierced,” Harry countered, shrugging when Ron shot him a sour look. “Look, I’m not worried about Malfoy or anything. He’s a coward and a prick and he’s all alone, plus he owes me for saving his life, so I don’t think he’s a danger. I just...want to be careful.”
Narcissa was whispering furiously, her voice a faint hiss, from somewhere near the entrance hall of the house. Draco paused on his way to the main chamber and leaned against a shadowed wall to listen. The strained, manic voice of his father drifted to his ears, distinctly more audible than his mother’s.
Harry ducked from the room, slipping into the hall and shutting the door as quickly as he could. As soon as it swung shut behind him and he was alone on the landing, he allowed himself a full-bodied shudder. A truly terrible decision on his part, to think that McGonagall would be any less intimidating to him now. He hoped it had been worth it for the chance to wander the castle uninterrupted.
Bill beamed at him, his face showing a ghost of its former handsomeness as a dimple appeared in his unscarred cheek. “Great. Back to work, not that anyone’s surprised. She insisted I take the job offer here because it’s safer than Gringotts, and what does she do? Goes right back to working there as soon as I’m gone.” Bill’s smile was infectious, and soon Harry was grinning, too, and then they were all piling into the office and flopping down on overstuffed chairs while Bill answered all of Harry’s questions about the book he had leant him, and Ron periodically swiped hard candies out of a tin on Bill’s desk, earning himself a handful of pointed glares but no further chastisement from his oldest brother. At last, when they had caught up and spent some time each complaining about their misfortunes and laughings at the others’, Bill began sifting around in the enormous oak desk and finally produced a stack of parchment for each of them and handed them across. Harry flipped through the pages, bound at the edge by a sticking charm, and discovered that they were lesson plans — pre-written outlines, clearly copied down by an automatic quill, judging from the uniformity of the stroke, that had been drawn up to help them teach classes unsupervised. Harry glanced over at Ron and they locked eyes, passing between them an expression that predicted a grim year of carefully sanctioned teaching, rather than the the sort of exciting and spontaneous lessons they had hoped to teach.
It was cloudy and dark outside, the morning light a watery grey through the windows, shuttered by lumpy grey clouds squatting before the sun like something congealed. Between last night’s nightmares and overall lack of sleep, he was in a terrible mood to start his day, and things only continued to sour when he overheard his parents speaking downstairs. As silently as he could, Draco dressed himself and slipped a few important items into his pockets: his wand, a thin leather wallet containing a handful of galleons, an emerald-capped vial of Floo powder — and slipped down the stairs, landing each footfall so as not to make any sound through the empty stone chambers of the ancient house.
“I suppose I should have guessed that,” he conceded. “Then it seems only right that it should have passed to you. Though I would remind you that it could be kept solely for decorative purposes. Sentimentality, if you will.”
“But what if I’m put in Slytherin?” the child moaned, tugging insistently at the sleeve of his friend’s robe. She continued to ignore him, gazing instead at the carved stone sconces on either side of the entryway.
Harry stood silent for a long time, his eyes fixated on Draco’s face. Everything hung suspended in that moment, like time had stopped everywhere except for that single tower, until a faint breeze began to gust between them, the only evidence that life outside went on.
“I hardly need to remind you that it’s because of your intervention that Lucius’s kid walks free,” Bill said. “So be careful who you go around accusing. I don’t like it either, but I do what Kingsley asks me to do.”
Harry,” Hermione insisted, slapping her palm on the table to punctuate her point. “I can’t believe we’re still having this conversation. You couldn’t fight a war on your own, and you can’t clean up from one on your own either. Let people help!”
“Glad teh see ya,” Hagrid said in a watery voice. When he turned, holding a set of mismatching teacups in his enormous hands, his black eyes were glittering with tears. “Yeh’ll never believe wha’s happened.”
“Complaining about a war that the rest of us all had to fight in as well, only you were too much a coward to stand for the side you knew was right.”
They ordered food and drinks while Ron went through their purchases, including a trick hair gel that turned all the user’s hair acid-green for 24 hours, a veritable mountain of assorted candies, a set of sticky trainers that allowed the wearer to scale walls, and a crystal vial of Ammortentia-inspired perfume, which smelled differently to each passerby depending on what smell they liked best. This last item, Ron quickly slipped back into the bag before Hermione could get a look at it, telling her that it was a Christmas present and she would see it later.
Ron grinned unapologetically. “Hey, mate, just because you aren’t getting any doesn’t mean you can spoil it for the rest of us.”
Harry threw a fortifying arm around Ron’s shoulders, giving it a squeeze, and together they forged onward into the shop, following the sound of raucous laughter and the smell of boiled sweets and burning hair.
“It’s delightful seeing you fight your compulsive need to listen to your own voice,” Draco sighed at last, raising an eyebrow at Harry while giving him a look out the corner of his eye. “But I know you have something you want to say, so out with it.”
The trio shrugged on their jackets and shouldered their way through the heavy door into the bracingly cold night. Hermione shivered at the sudden change in temperature from the warm fire-lit belly of the Hogs Head tavern, and Ron put an arm around her reflexively to stop her shaking.
Draco’s look darkened. Even in the moonlight there seemed a sudden shadow across his face. “No friends of mine,” he said, low and vehement. “Thought you knew that when you got me acquitted.”
Minerva McGonagall was sitting at her desk when Harry turned up, spluttering and coughing from a sharp inhale of smoke that had coated the back of his throat with a layer of smog. He gained his footing just in time to realise that he had tracked ash onto her carpet in the midst of his clumsy arrival, and glanced up sheepishly to be met with a reproving glare that was not at all softened by the barrier of her crescent gold-rimmed spectacles.
“Bloody hell.” Ron chortled. “You do a little thing like save the damn world and Ellerby and Spudmore go ahead and name their new model after you. Suppose Ginny’s got one yet?”
“Sort it, then,” Narcissa said, indicating the peacock. “I’ll be in the kitchen when you’re done.” She left Lucius in the foyer and swept Draco away down the hall, shadowing him from the eyes of his father.
“You always did make friends with the wrong sort,” Harry said at last. “I could help you, if you wanted.” He took a step toward Draco, who tensed and flinched away like a wounded animal. Harry halted, hardly daring to breathe.
magic.” He glanced at Harry then, fully, searching his face for something with calculating eyes. Harry did his best to hold the gaze, but looking Malfoy in the eye for this long without feeling like he was about to be murdered was making his skin crawl.
Again, the class laughed, and Harry felt his heart swell up. He hadn’t allowed himself to miss this, what with the reek of war that surrounded his past teaching ventures, but he was finding, with a wave of reminiscence, that he had missed it more than he could bear. Every spell they learned was another injury avoided, another life saved. Here, in this room, he would create the antithesis of everything Voldemort had ever held dear.
The sorting finished quickly with no stalls to speak of. The boy Harry had been speaking to went to Ravenclaw, though his friend was sorted into Slytherin. Harry hoped silently that they would still be friends afterward, that his words had made some effect on their opinions.
Harry looked at him for a long time then, like he was trying to puzzle out an arithmancy problem. Draco could feel the piercing green eyes on him, making every hair on the back of his neck stand on end, but he refused to return the look, worried what Harry would see in him if he did.
This startled Harry enough that his arm dropped. Draco’s relief was small as the pressure on his neck released, and he reached to massage the injured spot with his eyes still fixed firmly on Harry’s, determined not to show fear. Harry’s wand had lowered and was now aimed somewhere around the center of Draco’s chest. Draco was unarmed, unresisting. Not only that: he had looked death in the eye and asked it to hurry up. Somehow, after everything they’d been through, this unsettled Harry most of all.
“I’m not trying to start an argument here,” muttered Ron quickly, his hands up in a pacifying gesture. “I just mean, and I’ve told you this before, but, I think you’re too forgiving.”
“Because it’s always worked so well in the past?” Harry said. He didn’t sound entirely convinced, but there was a resignation starting to colour his tone that said Ron and Hermione were wearing him down.
“Probably just a wolf or something,” Ron reasoned, giving Hagrid a strong clap on the shoulder. “We can go put up some protective enchantments if you’d like, though. Make sure nothing else gets to them. I’m really sorry, Hagrid.”
Draco tugged down the cuff of a sleeve jerkily and resettled his arms against the bannister, grimacing. Harry caught a brief flash of marbled scar tissue on his forearm as he did. “Maybe you can ask your friend Bill. He seems to tell you everything about me anyway.”
“Are you okay to go in here?” Harry tried to meet Ron’s eyes, but Ron was transfixed on the swaying sign above the doorway. “Ron.”
“One ‘a ‘em...” he hiccoughed, seeming to choke down a sob. “One ‘a ‘em got attacked last night after the students got in. I went to feed ‘em after pullin’ the carriages, you know, they always do such a good job...” he reached into his pocket and pulled out an enormous, ratty handkerchief, which he blew his nose on loudly. “And they’re all spooked, like summat’s been hangin’ about and messin’ wit ‘em. So Fang and I have a look, ‘a course, and down in the gully by their usual spot, we found it...all scratched up and bleedin’ like. Just a wee critter. Didn’t even have its hair grown in, bless the poor thing. An’ it...it...” Hagrid was full-body wailing now, heaving huge, wretched sobs into his handkerchief, which looked beleaguered under all the strain. “It died after we found it. Monstrous! Horrible, heartless thing to do, attackin’ a defenceless creature like tha’.”
There was a bowl of fruit on the desk, all red apples, to match the decor. Harry wandered over to them and took one up, methodically weighing it between his hands to make sure it was not made out of wax. The sort of decoration Aunt Petunia used to like, back when he had to be apprised of such things. The apple was real; he collapsed bonelessly onto the couch and sunk his teeth into it, enjoying the satisfying crunch to the bite. He closed his eyes and sunk back into the cushions to listen. Nothing but the sound of his own chewing and the crackling of the fireplace reached his ears, and it was a delight.
“Your own fault for having older brothers. Now, I’ve got another class in half an hour,” Bill said, shooting Ron a capricious grin. “So both of you shift so I can go nick a sandwich or something.”
“I know you’re trying to be funny,” Harry said, the bitterness colouring his tone however hard he tried to bite it back. “But that’s not where we are right now.”
The top of the Astronomy Tower was peaceful this late at night, which was what Draco had been counting on when he snuck his way up to its ramparts, feeling foolish as he ducked into alcoves in the stone hallways and avoided contact with any of the students or staff. Strictly speaking, he shouldn’t still be here this late, but after the events of the morning he was reluctant to return home any too soon. The grounds had been busy earlier, which he had discovered the hard way. Now he stood at the balustrade rubbing ruminatively at the sore spot on the bridge of his nose, relishing in the silence. The only sound that carried up here was the low whistling of the wind through the open arches of the tower. It carried the heady smell of pine trees and lake water, stark and blasting and rejuvenating by degrees as it washed over him. Too long he had been confined to his childhood house, breathing in the stale air heavy with dust. Even after all that had happened upon this tower, within these halls, those long years ago, the castle hadn’t lost its familiar quality of home. The people had changed — or perhaps more accurately, he had changed them — but at least the creaking ancient gyroscope seemed not to mind his company, suspended as ever from its enormous chain in the centre of the tower. Just him and the wind and the railings, the sort of profound peace that had been remarkably hard to come by for one so often alone. He closed his eyes to drink in the silence, feeling the hair on his forehead rifled by the wind.
Hagrid’s eyes were dark, his cheeks blotchy when he lifted his face out of his handkerchief. “Fallin’ don’t shred the flesh off yer bones,” he said. Harry shuddered.
“Can’t we just celebrate?” Hermione implored, reaching across the table with a reassuring hand. After a moment’s consideration, Harry straightened up in his chair and took it, accepting it without complaint when she gently squeezed his fingers. Ron sighed dramatically and threw his hand on the pile as well, inciting Hermione to a quiet giggle.
“Brighter than you look,” Bill teased, earning a light shove from Harry to the shoulder. “Yes, of course. The Ministry can’t keep that family on probation forever. And society tends to prefer wizards who can defend against dark spells, not cast them. And Hogwarts is, as usual, the safest place to monitor someone.”
However exciting the finding of the door had been, it was nothing compared to Harry’s reaction to the room beyond. The chamber was expansive and comfortably furnished in varying shades of gold and crimson — no doubt a touch of McGonagall’s, who like him, had a considerable amount of house pride. The four-poster bed on the far wall was flanked by turret windows and trapped in velvet curtains, and was at least twice the size of the standard bunks in the dormitories. There was an oak desk all his own on the left wall, and on the right, an enormous hearth, within which a fire had begun burning merrily the moment his feet crossed the threshold. The fireplace had before it a large red couch and rug to match those of the Gryffindor common room, and the sight made his heart constrict. It really was just like being home.
Harry reacted more quickly than Draco had even expected — and he had expected it, raising his hands in a lazy gesture of surrender as the air in front of his warped like a mirage, the shape taking form as the cloak was cast to the ground, and in two lightning strides there was a wand-tip at his throat, pressing insistently against the pulse point under his jaw, and the resolute arm of Harry Potter connected to it, his green eyes wild with a maelstrom of passing thoughts, most prominently anger and curiosity in remarkably equal measures. The moonlight caught on his glasses as he shifted, and the telltale green eyes vanished behind a wash of Draco’s own face, sneering and unconcerned where it was reflected back to him.
"It means you can't be here, Mr. Lupin." Draco mutters and Teddy smiles at him, the way little Sirius in the family photo of his mother smiled, with teeth and that dimple on his right cheek. "Don't make a fuss or they'll figure it out."
"No." He sentences and takes two steps closer to Harry with a dangerous look that makes Potter recoil. Draco could have scoffed, but he doesn't. "You don't care. You're here because you're making fun of me, you're taking this opportunity to rub my face that you won and that I'm a stupid bad shit teacher and-
The walk to McGonagall's office down the hallways isn't very comforting. He bumps into a couple of prefects who are doing their usual rounds, but he doesn't stop to give a proper greeting because he feels that the later he talks to the headmistress, the more she will get mad at him for being such an idiot that anyone defies his authority.
Later that night, after flipping through several pages of droll lesson outlines and nearly falling asleep, Harry had turned back to his curse-breaking book to finish the final chapter. The margins were filled with Bill’s thin, sloping handwriting all the way up to the last page, and when Harry finally closed the back cover he realised that his own scroll of notes contained just as much of the information that Bill had written down as the passages from the book. He checked his watch, a gift from Ron several years earlier — the golden snitch face had tiny spectral wings that unfurled and beat softly against his wrist on the hour, though they were silent now as it was only quarter to nine. His legs were stiff from sitting in the same position for too long, and the students would be back in their dormitories by now, so really — if he thought about it — now was the perfect time to return that book. He hauled himself quickly off the couch, reduced the fire to embers with a flick of his wand, and jammed his trainers on as he went for the door.
Neville shook his head fondly, glancing between the two of them with a half-grin still plastered across his face. “We should start heading down soon, we can watch the sorting from the back of the hall.”
“Oh, there was a war. Hadn’t you noticed?” Draco, despite the imminent danger, rolled his eyes and bared his teeth in a sardonic grin. “Do you care, suddenly? You never write.”
“Come on.” Bill’s voice was gentle, coaxing. He nudged Harry to follow and resumed walking. “Tell me how class went.”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice; Neville dragged both him and Ron away from the entrance hall and began ascending the stairs two at a time on his gawky legs, Harry and Ron jogging to keep up until they arrived at the second floor staff room, where a smaller yet equally elaborate feast had been laid out on the long central table, alongside several decanters of pumpkin juice and raspberry wine. It was only when he set his eyes upon the food — an overwhelming assortment of roast meats and cooked vegetables, heaps of mashed potatoes, braised sausage and lamb, mince pies and pasties, gelatins and treacle tarts —that Harry realised he had not remembered to eat anything all day, and despite lying in until nearly midday, he was hungry enough to eat everything on that table. Ron seemed to second these thoughts without a single word even passing between them — they both dove for the stack of gold dinner plates with a fervour and began towering them with food from every dish, Neville following after them in an awed sort of bemusement.
“Look, just start with the classic shit, it’ll be fine. I’m Harry Potter, I saved you all from the reign of evil, my incredibly fit friend Ron here needs no introduction...”
“And here I thought you enjoyed our rivalry.” Draco’s eyes swept the trees below as he wrung his hands absently, thinking.
“Me own blend,” Hagrid said, sounding a little cheerier, as he shuffled off to grab the kettle. “Been growing it in me garden out back. Mind ya, it’s a bit stronger that wha’ you two are probably used to. Bloke my size needs a bit more kick to wake hisself up in the mornin’.”
“What was he doing here?” Harry asked quietly, failing to hide his anger with Bill, who looked entirely unconcerned by this development.
“It’s changed a lot, hasn’t it?” Ron sighed, catching Harry’s eye with a weak smile. “I don’t know what half of these places are anymore, all the old ones went out...”
“Fair enough.” Harry stuffed his hands into the pockets of his anorak to protect his fingertips from the persistent chill. “What are you teaching him?”
Draco’s frown only deepened. “Scared the living shit out of him when he saw me sneaking back across the grounds. Out by the greenhouses? He probably thought it was Peeves playing a prank. Idiot just fucking swung at me in a panic.”
Someone was breathing nearby. There were dozens of stairs to scale to reach the Astronomy Tower, and the listener was fighting to slow their breathing in shallow, ragged huffs. Blood would be roaring in their ears from the climb, no doubt softening the loudness of their breaths to their own perception. Draco considered all of this in the calculated way he considered most things, factoring in the available information, filling in the gaps with conjecture, coming to one glaringly obvious conclusion. He had always been good at assessing a situation and twisting it to his benefit, a talent he had too often wasted on the wrong pursuits.
“I think you’re stalling,” Harry guessed. Bill actually smiled wanly at that, a quiet breath of a laugh escaping his lips.
Harry wanted to retort, but he was having trouble forming words around the enormous smile spreading the span of his face. “I’ll bring him flowers,” he mused in barely restrained delight.
Harry had been leaning with one foot propped against the wall behind them — when he lowered it to the ground with a sound of scuffing, the children whirled around in a panic. When they realised who was listening in on their conversation, the girl clapped a small hand over her open mouth to smother a gasp, while the boy simply gawked, his eyes as wide as saucers.
“You could go grab that practice dummy out of the storage cupboard,” Harry suggested at his usual volume, nodding to the slanted doorway under the office stairs. “If it’s not there, they’ll have to practice on us, which I don’t particularly fancy on day one.”
“All I know is, he’s keeping a close eye on all the Malfoys — as much as he can without closing them all in Azkaban. But you seemed to trust Draco after the war, Harry.” Bill stopped now, turning to face Harry with a knowing stare. “Don’t underestimate how much impact your actions have had on that boy’s life. I doubt he’d be walking free if not for you. So really think before you go responding negatively to his continued freedom, because Robards will take any chance he can get to lock them all away for good.”
"How are you doing with the wolves?" He asks after a while because the silence with Potter feels suffocating, especially when he's like this indeed shit.
"Oh, yeah, right, me too. Sure. Harry, see you at Hogwarts, okay? Take care of Draco for me, see ya." Draco hears the door closing and he can almost imagine Potter's shocked face.
Draco's mind disconnects from the real world, which is normal when he's going through paperwork, but he curiously seems to be having a conversation with Neville; who is noteworthy, is wearing the most horrible Christmas sweater he has ever seen in his life. And Pansy particularly liked wearing the most hideous ugly sweaters, it was an essential part of her constant flirting with Aidan Lekser, a Ravenclaw senior.
"Yeah well..." He takes a sip of his beer. "I would have loved to find more, but that wasn't possible, I guess, maybe I should just look for more. Although Teddy will blow his mind when he sees the photos of Remus and Sirius. We don't have many at home, Remus didn't like photographs."
"It doesn't hurt me to accept that they are handsome, although they are not my type because they do not go me blonde, but I know that Neville does." Neville groans, tucking her face into his arms.
Draco understood Connor's position. He was the pride of the family, the first man in generations, not the first-born, but the youngest of the Tremletts. His mother bragged that her son was a Ravenclaw with excellent grades, his sister was part of the Auror strategist team. Probably the best of his generation. It wasn't just about whether his son was gay, it was about not wanting to be an embarrassment.
"It's true, we studied together with Professor Longbottom." Connor chimed in. Evan looked very funny between the two boys, Lupin who had been brought forward a year by his excellent grades being much taller than him just like Connor.
"Don't brag about a war you didn't fight." Harry mutters under his breath so only the man can hear him. He did it in a way that even he had a chill run up his spine, and he wished Potter couldn't feel his goosebumps from him.
Harry enters with cautious steps, even for being drunk he seemed to keep the same composure that he always maintained around him, walking as if he were taking care of something, perhaps that this was a trap and Draco was actually a Death Eater who seduced him into bring him to his apartment and kill him.
"It doesn't seem like Christmas around here." He jokes pointing at the room. He pulls his wand out of his coat bag "Can I?"
"Well, it's now that you're here." Harry laughs. Why the hell is he laughing? "Now what do you want, Potter?" Draco carves his face and turns as if it hurt to do so. And it could be true.
"I didn't have time to go out and look for a tree." He jokes leaving a cup of hot chocolate in front of Draco. "I don't have coffee, I hope it doesn't bother you."
"Tomorrow don't you'll come to ask me for help with your hangover, Longbottom." He points his finger at it. He rotates in his place ready to go to sleep, perhaps to give himself some attention, or whatever the dream he was feeling in his eyelids gave him.
"Call him Connor, and voilá," Draco says with his arms crossed over his chest. Evan smiles triumphantly and he denies, straightening a lock of hair. "There will be time for us to talk about Connor the frog or the yule, now let's focus our energy on deciding what we will sing."
"Not." Draco grips his lip between his teeth, twisting his face into a grimace. Fantastic! Announcing to Harry Potter that he's more alone than Trelawney's madwoman because yes, he is abandoned and sad, and very, very drunk.
"Professor, professor! Charlie put two tablespoons." Jamal exclaims standing while he adjusts his glasses. Draco opens his eyes as dishes. The cauldron begins to bubble, a green smoke springs without limit.
Neville knows that it's that inferiority complex that he has been a victim of all his life, he finds it difficult to accept compliments and more difficult to believe them.
Draco looks at Harry's hand on his shoulder and then looks at him. He may notice something strange in the way he looks at him. Emerald green eyes fixed on him, his face and his own eyes.
Draco sighed as Harry did and after pouring himself more whiskey he raised his glass for another drink that burned his throat to a lesser extent than the previous drink.
"I understand, I also have fame, but they don't stop me for autographs or photos, you saw it a while ago." Draco winks at him mockingly. Harry looks away watching the round of beers float down to his table. The man quickly grabs one in his hands.
"Do you want us to accompany you, Professor?" Connor asks, coming down the steps. If he wasn't shitting himself, he would hug this child, but he only denies with a smile that he hopes that they'll leave him  alone.
Draco chuckles mentally, he was told the same thing every year when a new defense teacher walked through the door. A classic, he thought.
"Uhm ... doesn't that sound very simple? I had thought that it could have a more... uhm- more magical name, because Connor gived it to me, is it bewitched?" Connor denies and Evan purses his lips in disappointment.
"Hopefully they'll authorize the modifications." Harry Potter looked tired as he spoke, two large dark bags settled under his eyes and the emerald green was surrounded by a faint reddish color that replaced the white. Draco didn't let his guard down.
And therein lies the fucking irony of life, Harry Potter, who went from being the most wonderful being, to the most petulant and hateful, had always been a damn angel among human garbage. The boy who defeated who should not be named, the boy who fought in a war they should never have lived through was here in front of him, Draco Malfoy, the stupid rich boy who let himself be branded as a Death Eater by asking him to be friends.
"I'm talking about soup, who eats soup of their own free will?" Neville growls crossing one leg over the other. "Why don't you invite MacMillan over to your place?"
Draco runs up to Evan and holds him checking his head, hoping he doesn't have anything but a few scratches. Teddy tries to hit Jerome in response, but Draco stops him as best he can. The rest of the students run alongside Evan while Gilbert complains from his place.
Victoire is safe, high-five with Milton and gives Renée a nod. Principal McGonagall again scolds Teddy for his vulgar language. The game resumes in a matter of seconds. And Victoire scores twenty points for Gryffindor. Hugo and Helga are not far behind, and they score thirty managing to be on par.
"Jenna and Kevin can't agree on positions." And ask me if I know anything about Quidditch. I don't even know the basic rules! Ron was always there to explain to me what the hell was going on in the field."
"My punishment was to stay here, did you forget?" The smile on the teenager's face makes the blood in his body boil, but Draco is good at feigning serenity, so he seeks all the patience he has and smiles.
"Okay, he sighs. The game is about to start, I will go to my sit. I hope they don't disappoint their peers."
"No, these- these guys were beating up Messrs McKinley and Henderson." Harry's face changes to surprise and he quickly walks over to the students at his house to ask if they're okay. "I need you guys to come with me to present the situation with Principal McGonagall."
So going back to work doesn't sound so bad anymore because he at least he's able to not think about Ernie all the time when he has to worry about not cutting off any of his students' hands. Although at the end of the day Ernie is always there, and the pain in the stomach; which is more like a broken heart invades him until he wants to lock himself in his office to listen to Sagittarius = Tears at full volume while he feels sorry for himself because he is not able to go straight to Ernie and ask him if he likes boys, or if at best of the cases, he likes him.
"Don't worry, I won't ask you to tell me about your life reduced to what you like and what you don't because I certainly don't care if you think Macbeth's Witches is the best RMI band." There's a general laugh. Draco mentally pats himself on the shoulder. "However, I need you to mix with each other. One Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff in each row."
The last thing he hears before he passes out and falls to the floor like a sack of potatoes is Potter running to the rescue, repeating his name as if he was seriously being paid to do it.
"Jerome was holding the two boys in the air. Gilbert was casting a spell, something akin to the cicatrix. No... I have no idea what he was doing."
"If I find out again that a student in my house is doing that kind of stupid thing one more time, I will not hold back, I swear by Salazar that I will move heaven, sea and earth to have them expelled." Nobody flinches too much. "This year his behavior has been terrible, every week I have to lower points to my own house and take charge of the detention of at least three students. If this is because I am being too soft, then forget about me, there will be no further consideration, and I will not hold back from lowering the house four hundred points if necessary. Merlin! Get that face off, Joanne."
"Apparently this is not our best time for love." Harry mumbles sounding heartbroken in his minority.
"Only at Christmas? You, Harry Potter?" The young man twists his lips with a shrug. "I didn't expect that at all, I mean, what about Weasley?"
Haven Kingsley is the first to welcome Draco as a new singing teacher. The enthusiastic Gryffindor girl explains the voice type of each of the choir students.
"Haven Kingsley asked me if the choir would be closed," Draco snorts when he sees that Neville is still more focused on the music on the radio than what he's saying, he throws a spoon at him and slaps him on the arm. "Are you hear me?"
"If that's your way of telling me you love me, that's fine." Draco clicks his tongue sarcastically. "If someone had told me that we would end up speaking like decent humans with no spells involved, I would not have believed it for a second."
The alcohol rose through his veins, he felt like a layer under his skin that burned, as if he had been injected with adrenaline and all he could feel is the rising heat in his blood, a fervent need to shoot all his energy into something.
When they say goodbye to the two women, the sun is already beginning to hide behind the mountains as if it were a kind of ritual that always arrived without fail. Harry turns to him asking if he's ready to go and Draco nods so they show up in Hogsmeade in the same alley from that morning, right behind Hog's Head.
"To Helga's ears, hurry up, McGregor." Evelyn Wolff arrives at the classroom door and takes Evan away so fast that she doesn't have time to see Connor's reaction.
Harry extends a hand to Draco, and he's held tightly by feeling Harry's warmth in the touch and brings his skin with his fingers by accident and wonders why his skin is so soft to the touch. He blushes immediately because he does not care about Harry Potter's skin, he does not give a fuck.
"Oh yeah." Neville cleared his throat. "They asked my permission, it's something between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, Professor Flitwick knows about that."
That is until he is finally in front of the door of the woman's office and this must be his record time in getting there so fast to the place, but he does not have time to breathe one last time because before he even considered knocking on the door, Minerva is already asking him to enter.
"Did what?" The way he asks is slow, as if a large part of him expected this to be a trick of his mind, as if this girl hadn't led Draco to the wolf's mouth to be mercilessly devoured.
"Hmm." Draco bites his tongue, Harry turns around ready to go which increases an indescribable sensation in his gut. A feeling of relief, disappointment and anger, the desire to fight and deal with this at once. Everything grows like a suffocating tickle in his body.
"Because you were drunk and very unconscious. I think I should tell you that I tried absolutely nothing with you." Draco smiles much more relaxed, which infects Harry. "I was more worried that night that you would find out and be mad at me than I was about the fact that you had kissed me or whatever."
With careless steps he left the room to go to the astronomy tower. He hummed in time with Kingsley as he dragged his long limbs through the hallways, ignoring the annoying noises from the squares on the walls.
"It's not written in any book that I cannot use the infatuation of my students to my advantage in the field." Draco shrugs and Neville curls his lips in agreement.
Being this drunk made him feel light, like all his problems didn't exist. The pressure of work, the problems with his family, his own homosexuality, the choir, Connor, none of that was invading his mind. The only fixed idea was the desire to feel the wind on his face
As expected, François's parents made as much or more scandal than Draco expected; It wasn't a surprise even when the boy's mother threatened to destroy the status of the Malfoy family and the sole heir to it, and Draco couldn't smile more when he answered a clear "fuck it."
Maybe this was just his chance to show Ernie MacMillan how good a fit Neville Longbottom was as a future boyfriend aka husband, aka father of his children. He would have to send a letter to Luna and Ginny to talk about this as soon as possible. Draco wasn't an expert on relationships and Harry had been single since that girl from the ministry three years ago.
Draco is finishing up chorus rehearsals with some Ravenclaw students who decided to join in at the last minute when he sees Neville walking in the rain accompanied by Ernie Macmillan. Neville looks embarrassed and if Draco weren't so surprised he would have laughed three long, loud laughs.
The holidays are ending too quickly for Neville's liking, who still hadn't even digested the turkey for his return to school.
The idea crosses his mind at all times, the words he can say, the excuses, the apologies. But what do you say to someone after you kiss them? And not only that, you kissed him while you were so drunk that you didn't remember anything the next morning, and even though he must have killed you, he was kind enough to heat you soup and escort you to your room. Guilt gnaws at him inside and he's about to apologize when Jerome lunges at Evan and hits him non-stop. Potter gets to his feet as fast as he can and pulls them apart taking Jerome by the shoulders, while the boy growls in anger.
"Once she put a spell on him so that her hair was a bird's nest, you could already see it all over the school being chased by the little birds." Harry laughs in fascination.
"Heard the Hufflepuffs are having a party tonight." The three men's gazes shifted to Headmistress McGonagall who was watching them through her half-moon glasses.
He gets to the second floor as fast as he can, Jerome has Michael and Jeremy pinned in the air while some students made noise, Gilbert was striking purple sparks coming from his wand in what appears to be a scar-like spell at Jeremy as Michael was trying to get out of Jerome's hold with all his might.
"Are you sure, Neville?" Harry looks at him doubtfully too tempted by his hero's heart. How lucky to have this man as a friend.
So the next morning he's glad to find Harry sleeping next to him in the armchair and is surprised that he didn't worry about changing his clothes from the previous day, but decides to continue sleeping on Harry's chest until eleven in the morning of the day After Christmas. Because Harry's arms are comfortable and keep him away from the idea of the piles of snow out there.
"Professor Malfoy?" A voice called from the other side of the door, immediately recognizing him as one of his best potions students.
Teddy is on his feet, leaning towards the field, his hands are fully gripping the fence and the people in the stands are just as concerned as he is looking at the girl. John is slow to react, but Milton flies with great speed towards Victoire, she is moving on her broom, but another bludger wants to hit her. Renée bites her lip and flies quickly to hit the second bludger.
Harry clears his throat and asks for his glasses back. Draco curses himself for thinking of kissing him when he's done with whatever his relationship with Blaise Zabini has been in his life just the day before.
"And I... wanted to apologize for everything I said the other day in the greenhouse, and for forcing you to choose between Potter and me and for... for being an idiot, in short."
"We would have invited you, Harry, but it was secret. Seamus's mother wouldn't allow it and he said 'hell, let's go to one of those Muggle places' and we went to Holland."
, but today. Just today, which should be a great night to undress and live his five senses, he's wrapped in alcohol in a bar in Hogsmeade forgetting about the dignity and elegance that he
But Harry turns to him at that moment, neither of them move and they are at a dangerous distance that he cannot break because like the fire in the middle of winter it's mesmerizing and those emerald eyes that shine like crystals invite him and Draco wants, really wants to touch those thick lashes that fall majestically, as pretty as Granger's or Pansy's when she was putting on makeup with her mother's cosmetics.
"Let's go?" He asks her with the suitcases in his hands, it's not a long trip, but he repeats himself, just in case.
Neville denies waving a hand in the air. Too busy wiping his nose with a tissue that he holds with his other hand. "I can go, I need some fresh air anyway."
These scenes remind Draco of the horrible school days during the war when everyone walked in groups to avoid being enchanted by some Slytherin who had crossed over to the dark lord. All the half-blood walked near a teacher, even. And suddenly Draco realizes that the war for people like him never ends.
"What do you want?" He asks with a sore throat. Draco plays with his hands and bites the inside of his cheek.
"No, he has to prepare his tests for Monday morning ..." They are both silent for a couple of seconds until Harry lifts a finger and turns to him, taking his arm. "Would you go with me, Draco?"
Fresia takes a deep breath and denies with calm and a severe frown of outrage, but Jude Singh nods and stands in front of her teammates even though Milton and Jerome pull her to stop her. "Fresia said she would guarantee us the match," she says. "Kyle was so bad in practice that we all thought a little help would be good, just enough for the game. Professor Malfoy was so convinced that Professor Potter would cheat that we believed we could also cheat when Fresia offered it. I'm so sorry."
"Need help?" Harry Potter walks into the great hall with the same stupid smile as ever. "It seems like you're not enjoying having to decorate very much."
"A round of Fire Whiskey for Harry Potter." Says the bartender from The Three Brooms with a smile so big it seems to hurt.
"Shut your mouth," he said as soon as he saw Neville's intentions to laugh. The man smiled and nodded, pretending to close his mouth with a latch.
"You have two kids here, Lupin, join me if you want to chat with a real adult," he says, standing up in the direction of the small kitchen to make some tea. Edward follows him impassively like a puppy taking a seat at the bar with a smile and a blush still painted on his face.
Harry smiles looking at the photographs in his hands. "He's identical to Remus, but when he smiles and does his thing, he's more like Sirius ... although Tonks inherited all the energy from him."
The man smiles even more. Small folds forming under his eyes, making the time on his face much more mature. "What are you doing here at Christmas? Are you alone?"
Neville nods, twisting his lips. "I try to touch myself and the first thing that comes to mind is Ernie, but I immediately feel guilty because I shouldn't think about him, Draco, that's an invasion... it almost feels like- like- Shit! What do you do?"
In reality, vacations are just more work outside of school, planning and reviewing homework, what he has in mind for the end of the year when his students finish their studies at Hogwarts, and what plants would be more interesting to freshmen who seems less interested in Herbology than they might be in Charms. He doesn't know what he was thinking about when he decided to leave two essays on lava paprika to the second-year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.
The good astronomy tower was usually used by lovers to have some privacy, in years past it did not bring up good memories for Draco, but now he usually used it to observe the sky and smoke his pipe. Unfortunately, tonight he didn't have it with him.
Draco opens the windows with a movement of the wand of him, but it is not enough. They can not stand retaining the breath a second more, so he moves his hands so that everyone leaves the classroom. Not without first throwing himself a spell to remove his smell.
One, two, three seconds and nothing, Draco wants to escape, but the door opens showing a pathetic Neville Longbottom with a red nose and watery eyes. Draco can hear The Witches of the Valley with his best known heartbreak song, "Broken hearts of Fire." Which could only mean one thing, Neville had another one of his fits of self-pity for Ernie.
Neville told him how he put a spell on Gilbert Clearwater to make him bubble every time he opened his mouth. He should have deducted more points from Hufflepuff not only because of the mischief, but because it was against a student from his house, but Gilbert had to learn to shut his mouth and if it was a joke he was going to teach him to be quiet. Upstairs, he couldn't help but silently thank Evan.
Draco snorts. Yes, of course, and now that Harry Potter laughs because he has no talent even to coach a school Quidditch team well. Thanks, Longbottom.
Neville shakes his head in time to the music. It's a new group, Draco doesn't know them and because of how bad they sound, he doesn't care either.
"As soon as you learn of the condition of your sister, feel free to write. I'll see what I can do." Rolanda takes Draco's hands and thanks with tiny tears at the edges of her eyes.
"Thanks for joining me today, Draco. I know I've said it a million times, but I ... I really appreciate it, I didn't want to do this alone."
Draco doesn't realize he has been staring at Harry until the man scrambles into place waking up from his sleep. He's not wearing his glasses and he assumes he doesn't see him looking away quickly. Harry stretches out on the nightstand and probes several times until he finds the ugly round glasses and brings them to his face.
His body feels wet when he field of vision returns. Everything is dark, he can see the castle a little closer, and he realizes that he is on the lake.
"Hello." He says hello, fixing his clothes. He's not wearing his tunic and his hair looks rather like a bird's nest, much worse than when they were children and had a fight during a Quidditch match. "You want to eat? Ernie made hangover chicken soup. I'm not really sure that works, but you must be hungry I guess I don't know. Or we can buy something, the bar is not open yet, they have a blood-
"Nonsense, let's all go together. I bet you want to see Thomas and Finnigan, you guys were great friends, if I remember correctly."
He likes Evan, he's a good boy. He's not his favorite type of guy, but somehow he likes him. He's quiet when he has to and talks up to his elbows the rest of the time. Draco would say that he's a friend of all the students in the school or simply that there is no one who doesn't know him.
Draco wanted to scream and pluck his teeth to wipe the stupid grin off his face. If it bothered him? What an idiot was asking! Of course it didn't bother him. He was furious.
Draco squirms and Harry grabs him, he doesn't know if he can stop him because he's stronger or because he's more sober. "You kissed me. You're not in your five senses, let's just go back to the table, I'll go get Ernie and Neville."
"It turns into a bed, and is of course a quality sofa; I bought it with the Petitgirard a couple of years ago."
"Listen well, Weasley; I hate myself, but I can bet my ass it's not because I'm gay." Harry smiles and Ron follows suit.
Draco barely let out a laugh, even to the echo of the hallway. Maybe her own bad mood was due to how bad all his past relationships had gone. Not counting all the boys and girls he kissed drunk in his teens, there were Blaise Zabini, who left him when he discovered that he was actually more in love with Pansy Parkinson than with him, Tracey Davis was his last attempt to prove himself as such. Maybe he wasn't gay and that's why he couldn't find anyone good enough, but it all resulted in the girl's tears because he really didn't seem to love her. And finally, his story with Terry Boot was no better. Just a couple of disastrous dates that ended in "we can't seem to keep up, we should just leave it here, Draco."
The music hits Draco's ears right away. There are too many people in the place, some of them are dancing and others are just at their tables drinking. His heart stops when he sees two girls kissing with no one paying any attention to them.
And it was true, Draco had never been curious to touch himself or anyone else. He had listened to Theodore a few times in the bedroom bathroom. His moans were low, making it easier to hear him through the door, and he had to put a silencing spell on the bathroom more than once. Only for the damned to look at him the next morning and smile at him as if he had done it all on purpose.
Jerome was a spoiled and arrogant child, he came from an important family in France, belonging to one of the most important magical networks in Europe, at least among the purebloods, he was more of a power elite with political influences, but they were not official.  His mother fought for the ministerial job as soon as Hermione set foot in the office, more sickened by the idea of a mixed race in the ministry than anything else. And the first thing Hermione did was forbid the use of the word "Mudblood". Or at least, punish her with a large fine that, in any case, the François could pay without problem.
Would he have leaned into Quidditch? The Chudley Canons were always at the table in any discussion on the subject, there were even rumors about Potter being recruited to play the Caerphilly Catapults as a seeker, but turning them down for an Auror position in the ministry.
He barely finishes his breakfast and heads to his classroom in the dungeons. He says goodbye to Neville with a mocking smile when he sees him appear with dark circles under his eyes and an obvious migraine that seems to be drilling his brain.
Draco becomes alert when he sees Connor's crystallized eyes that have already started to shake. It's not normal at Connor Tremlett. He is generally peaceful, with almost no expression on his face.
"Write an essay on bonding, do all you can because it will be very important later. And go thinking about the person on whom you will use your potion."
"Connor, if you've already come to see me and your integrity is under attack, you have to tell me so I can sanction him."
That morning isn't too bad after all, Harry mentions something about how Remus was as much a chocolate lover as Teddy and the boy smiles happily. Then Teddy looks at Victoire with dreamy eyes and he is so much like Sirius that no one would doubt for a second that Edward Lupin was his son.
Draco doesn't respond. He's tired and it's been a bad week. He stares at him without an expression that says something really decipherable, he doesn't make an effort to say something.
"It seemed like a good opportunity to talk, to make the passes. I saw you reconcile  with Neville." Draco hummed in agreement.
"Did you have plans for today?" Harry asks and his voice shakes like he's shitting himself, then Draco suspects he's nervous, even though he's never seen Harry Potter nervous in his whole fucking life. Not even in fourth year when he took the scare out of his life and thought that giant lizard had made Potter coal.
"If you don't have a problem with missing a day off reading and signing reports, then an extra pair of hands wouldn't hurt." Potter smiles as he sits in the chair across from Draco's desk. He picks up a couple of folders and sets out to read everything. Draco mimics him, offers him tea and they work quietly for a couple of hours.
Draco blushes embarrassed. He was the same and he must have made up another last name, a dull and boring one like Longbottom.
"If you're busy giving a good presentation, I'm sure they might consider it." Draco says very calmly, but his body was burning under his skin, as if he had an instinct installed in his body and the need to fight Harry had grown. "They love graphics, but you should know that by now, you worked with them after all."
Harry shrugs. "And you would have been fully entitled, Malfoy. But I was more concerned about not ruining the little breakthrough I had made with you to be honest."
Malfoy moves closer to the cauldron, tosses the oleander leaves one by one mixing at intervals until the potion turns pinkish on its own, he does an approving addition. He takes the volcanic rock next to him and puts it in the cauldron.
"What's wrong with you? Don't you want to win the house cup at the end of the year?" The Slytherin team turns to look at him in surprise. Of course they wanted the cup.
"I'd better go see the director as soon as possible or else it'll be worse for me, shit..." Draco picks up his coat and briefcase in his arms and adjusts his neck because if he looks worse than he knows feels she will probably kick him. "Please go to your common rooms, we'll see you tomorrow."
They drink it all in one go, barely taking the time to savor it, and his sober Draco would be pissed off that his tea is enjoyed, it is not drunk as if it were anything, Draco didn't do things that were in the category of " anything".
I just love Neville too much with Ernie, I hope I can explore more about their relationship later. I don't know if there's anyone around here who likes this couple too.
Hogsmede's new bar that had been talked about so much lately was in fact an LGBT bar that you could only enter through a booth behind Hog's Head. Neville had been itching to go since he first heard from him, but Draco would never agree to go to a gay bar with him since he was still "closeted" and highly doubted that Harry, a straight man, would be interested, anyway.
"Why doesn't he have Sirius's last name?" The two decided to start with the tree and in the end they opted for white spheres.
"You are better now?" He asks and Neville has to do his best to understand. The man seems to understand Neville's bewilderment because he smiles. "About your cold."
Blaise once tried to get Draco to touch him under his underwear on one of his escapades in fifth year, during which time he hung out with Pansy and Draco functioned as his sex toy clearance. Blaise cornered him in a hallway around midnight, they were kissing and Blaise was putting his hands on his butt trying to break any hint of distance between the two, Draco was good at keeping up with him. He was kissing him desperately, just as they both liked, the adrenaline rushing through every corner of his body and Blaise's hands touching his skin, going up his back, and he imagined that there was love in his touch; That the Pansy thing had been for sheer appearance in fourth year, he liked to imagine that he was on Blaise's mind when he kissed Pansy. And then Blaise's hands left his back in peace and relaxed on his belly until they began to move down towards the buckle of his pants and Draco pulled away from him, broke the kiss, and the contact, and no they spoke to each other again.
"I would never do something like that." Harry walks over to Draco with his hand outstretched. I found this in the field.
"Neville isn't coming today, take my word, he'll be in the greenhouse waiting for Ernie to show up with his thousand roses." Draco points, lowering the newspaper. Harry gives Weasley a puppy dog look and he nods in defeat.
They don't talk much at the time, he doesn't know if it's because there is nothing to say, because the ravages of his drunkenness are already taking effect or because they are the kind of people who can be close to each other in normal silence. Draco has nothing clear with Harry, or what kind of relationship they have, if it's okay for him to listen to conversations about his family; he doesn't even know if it's right for him to accompany him when he could call anyone, friends weren't something Potter lacked ... unless he saw it as a charity case, did he feel sorry for how lonely he was it now?
"I guess we're all aware that winter holidays starts this Monday." Some students make festive noises and others snort in annoyance. "And it's a mutual agreement between us never to send homework during Christmas, but I reviewed his assignments for the past few days, and...” Draco brings the palm of his hand to his face and shakes in a tired voice. "You're my worst group, okay? And I don't want to see bad grades, especially in the students of my house, so to upload your grades you'll write eight scrolls on dragon scale substitutes, two scrolls on The Natural Conservation Agreements of Magical Animals from 2001 and an extra couple about the investigations of Tomás Alebrie."
"I don't think you want to come in and help me anyway." Draco's face flushes red before heading off to the kitchen to make tea as soon as possible.
