"Do you think so?"
"Shut up." Teddy threw the parchment down in disgust. "I've already wasted five sickles on this stupid thing. I don't want you making me feel any worse."
"He doesn't care."
Scorpius sighed and said, "My father didn't like the star. He said he wants money."
Harry was ready to accept defeat. He just lay on the ground, panting and sweating under the many layers of winter clothes he had piled on. He squinted up at the sunny sky, his glasses covered in drops of water, damp hair plastered to his forehead. He must have looked a frightful sight when Draco stood over him, blocking the sun from his view. He held up his hand. Draco took it to help him up to his feet. "You know, using magic was a bit unfair," Harry complained while patting at his jacket and pants to brush off the snow that had caked on. "I don't have my wand on me."
"Happy birthday!" Scorpius and Teddy exclaimed as they surprised Harry with a wonky neon blue cake that had a couple of sparklers sticking off the top, shooting yellow sparks over the icing.
"I didn't say that."
As soon as the door shut behind them, Scorpius gasped out, "I'm
Draco looked down at the cold glass and rolled it between his palms. Did he miss Harry? He wasn't sure. He had thrown himself into work and fixing things with Scorpius; distractions that gave him no time to think too hard. "Admitting it is rather mortifying."
So, one Wednesday evening, when Draco showed up in the kitchen while Harry was in the middle of his cooking, he was only mildly surprised. "I didn't know you were coming over today."
Draco slumped into the sofa and hid his face behind his hands. "Potter's right. I'm a bad parent," he realized.
"You can join us, Malfoy," Harry winked.
"I won't," Scorpius whispered back. "Don't tell my father."
"What am I supposed to do with a star?"
Draco gritted his teeth and winced. Everything in him had unsettled. He was glad when he got his wand back before he stepped out the building he loved to loath. Was this really any better than taking Veritaserum? He was beginning to wonder now.
Scorpius winced once again. "I don't think I like it that much."
"For God's sake-"
Luna looked back at him, her dreamy expression fading as she studied his face. She then squinted and placed her teacup down on the table before leaning very far forward, startling Harry into craning back in his chair. She moved her gaze over him rapidly. "Hmm." She sniffed a few times. "Hmm." She closed an eye, then opened it, then closed the other eye. "Hmm." Then she sat back. "No. You're still the same."
"Scorpius has a fever."
Sometimes he would lay awake, wondering what he was doing with his life. If Harry from ten years ago could see this now... After the war, everyone had expected him to join the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He had decided against it. Everyone had expected him to settle down with Ginny. He didn't for reasons not entirely satisfactory. He was living a life of boring rebellion. Harry from ten years ago would be trying to shake some sense into him, telling him to get on with it, make something of himself, live the life he had dreamt of as a child hiding under the stairs. And certainly not screw around with Malfoy, of all people. Draco Malfoy was never part of the plan. April would pass by in the blink of an eye - an hour after work, maybe a Saturday together. Harry would find himself in bed once again, thinking they couldn't possibly keep this up for much longer, this preposterous clandestine affair.
Teddy decided it was time to change the subject to something entirely different. "Hey. Wanna see the new books I bought?" He extracted himself out of Harry's arms and skipped over to his messy table. He quickly found the books he had been meaning to show Harry since forever. He jumped into bed and scooted up against the headboard, pulling Harry with him until they were sitting side-by-side against the pillows. "It's got pictures of
"I didn't feel bad. I just wanted to help."
They found him in the kitchen getting lunch ready. Harry didn't even have time to voice his surprise as Ron rushed at him, snatched the spoon out of his hand, and thrust the latest edition of Witch Weekly at him.
"Well, no," Harry admitted. "But I won't be free for another hour. I've got some work to do."
Harry and the boys worked on getting all the gingerbread men out of the oven. Draco set about brewing a much needed pot of coffee while deep in thought.
cry?"
Harry interrupted Draco by pulling him along as he apparated to Malfoy Manor. "I know." They had landed neatly outside the front door. Harry placed his hands on Draco's shoulders. "I'm Harry Potter. I'm kind of a big deal."
initiated a conversation with him before. "Yes, I know him from Hogwarts."
Harry pondered for a beat. "How?"
"Oh, you don't want to know, darling."
Harry cocked his head. "What are
Draco could tell that Scorpius was feeling miserable. He had recognized the look on the young boy's face while singing and had cringed. "You looked very grown up, Scorpius," he said. "And this was just your first performance. Many more to come."
"How?" Harry planted his hands at his hips. "There was an entire bowl of it."
"I'm his father. I don't need a reason. Why are you interfering?"
Scorpius just couldn't figure out what was wrong.
"Whoever told you that is lying," Harry said. "Crying is just as natural as laughing. When you're happy, you laugh. When you're sad, you cry. No one's said you can't laugh, have they?"
"Harry Potter," Draco repeated.
"What about you, Harry?"
He liked Hermione and Fleur the best so far. They sat opposite him and, if he shifted about while eating, he could watch them talking from around the bowl of potatoes. Hermione had bouncy Hugo on her lap and Fleur, who looked and spoke like an angel, held Rose. They weren't as loud as everyone else. They even smiled at him when they caught him staring. He would drop his eyes fast, but then couldn't stop himself from peeking a minute later. Hugo waved at him from time to time, obviously taken by this unusual boy with white hair and grey eyes. Scorpius certainly stood out in contrast to everyone else at the table, from his physical features to the clothes he wore and the way he ate.
know what possessed him. Draco Malfoy had possessed him. He would never have raised his voice or said such hurtful things to anyone else. Malfoy knew how to push his buttons, even after all these years. And Harry had fallen for it too, just like old times. Although he stood behind everything he said, now he was kicking himself for letting Malfoy goad him into being the fool. On top of all that, Scorpius was angry with him. The boy would hardly talk to him anymore, simply glaring instead. That signature Malfoy glare. It was all too much.
"Whoa." Harry closed the space between them in three strides, resting a hand on Draco's arm to stop him and turn him back around. Draco slapped Harry's hand away. Harry conceded by raising that hand in surrender. "Can you forget it?"
Harry looked over at Draco. The man appeared withdrawn, exhausted, and lost in the past. "Do you want to sleep?"
"How is it?" Harry asked him once they had gotten through a few bites. Scorpius nodded eagerly and hummed. He didn't want to talk with his mouth full, even though a lot of the Weasleys tended to do that from what he could see.
"Of course, honey," Astoria cooed.
"That's that."
"I said I was sorry."
"Would you tell him the truth?"
"That's right," Theo agreed wholeheartedly. "But the thing with Harry and Draco is that they never seem to grow up when they see each other. They act like they're back in Hogwarts."
"Scorpius."
"Are they true?"
"Okay. Got it." Harry gulped down the pain potion in one go, gagging as the bitter molasses-like medicine coated his throat. He handed the flask back to the nurse. "How much longer do I have to stay?"
"It's been passed down." Draco gestured at the bookshelves that spanned the entire perimeter of the room from floor to high ceiling. "Enough books to last a few lifetimes in here. A lot of history."
That night he wrote a crooked letter to Teddy. He refused to let his nosy father take a peek. He hunched over the table, using his arms to hide his words. He knew Teddy would give him a straight answer. He also trusted Teddy to keep the letter to himself.
What was he to talk about? He didn't know anything yet. Scorpius stared down at the colorful cover of the comic book in his hand, feeling glad that he had decided to come over. "If you talk, I'll listen," he said. "I'm good at it."
"Much." Draco pressed his smile to Harry's and they moved as one, falling onto the dusty sofa as their hands began to wander.
Patricia laughed.
"We didn't work."
"NO! NO INSIDE VOICE! YOU'RE
"Maybe next time, huh?" Harry pitched in before Draco could say anything.
"Cut it!" Teddy suddenly brandished a knife out of nowhere. Harry yelped and snatched the knife away from him.
Teddy beat Harry to the living room, and was celebrating despite loud protests from Harry that he had cheated. "My turn!" Scorpius shouted, already readying himself for the start of the race. Teddy was rearing to go too, not the least bit winded. Harry, in the meantime, was panting with his back to the wall. He was the first to notice Draco. He picked himself up off the floor and made his way over. "Did we wake you?"
Draco tsked.
," letting it click open. When Harry shuffled in, he gestured to the bed. Harry sat down, knowing that Teddy was about to give him an earful. Teddy strode forward and stopped in front of his godfather. "Do you know why I'm angry with you?" Harry nodded. "Remember how we're never supposed to lie to each other?" Harry nodded again. "You broke that promise." Harry stared at his hands. "Why would you keep secrets from me?" Teddy pressed on. "I'm not a kid anymore."
"I don't want him to come over anymore."
Harry occasionally watched Scorpius play. The boy was always alone. He didn't make friends well because he never smiled. He also never talked to his peers. If someone tried to play with him, he never pulled a tantrum. He would simply stand aside and let his classmate grab the toy right out of his hands. Gabrielle had tried instigating a few playgroups in an attempt to include all the shy children. Even so, Scorpius didn't seem to think much of all the cooking games and freeze tag attempts. He spent most of his playtime by himself.
Harry followed Draco through the manor, wondering why he had been asked along to pick an after-dinner drink. He knew next to nothing about fancy wine. Draco didn't make conversation as they climbed down the dark stairs. He had remembered his wand, unlike last time. He waved it once to light the wine cellar.
She gave him a big nod.
"Right."
Draco shrugged with a distracted air as he kept his eyes on Scorpius. "I work for a private law firm." He reached out and moved a cup of water away from the boy's elbow. "Careful," he murmured. Scorpius scowled at his father, as though to say 'I
"You don't know about Harry?" one of the boys asked. "I thought
An hour, bowls of peppery soup, and two potions later, Scorpius was sleeping with his head on Draco's lap in the drawing room while Harry cleared up the messy coffee table. "Are you feeling better?" he asked Draco.
Draco frowned at Harry. He reached out again.
"My whole life with him is a lie, Potter."
Hugo examined Scorpius, then reached out with his chubby hand. Scorpius flinched away in shock, knocking into Harry. He had never been that close to a baby before. Harry also knelt down next to them. "He likes you," he told Scorpius. "See? He's smiling." Hugo was grinning, which exposed his toothless gums, while reaching for Scorpius' hair again. Harry urged Scorpius forward. "You have to be gentle with him, okay?"
"It's not like that."
Andromeda was one of the few people who kept her calm a handful of days after the scandalous report in Witch Weekly. She let Harry into her home with a warm and sympathetic smile. She noticed the bags under his eyes. "Are you getting any sleep?"
Scorpius shivered because he certainly did not like the spooky cellar. "Nope." He decided to help Theo with dessert instead.
"Just at my place," Harry continued. "I won't starve him or anything."
, perhaps, and he was probably telling the truth. He didn't care and there was nothing wrong with it. Harry exhaled in one big rush and shut his mouth.
Harry faded out of the rant as he bit into a warm, cinnamon-sugar soaked apple slice...
said," Ron interjected. "Apparently a fat kid fell on him."
"His fever has been coming and going. Patricia is on holidays, so I stayed home with him. I'm giving him potions to get rid of the chills. But he can't swallow any food. He starts to cough. And he can hardly talk because he... he's... I don't-"
"Scorpius..."
Harry felt an overwhelming rush of sympathy. It wasn't often that he saw Draco like this, defeated. At the moment, he was keeping his anger in check as well. When he had been asked to confirm Draco's alibi, it had taken all his power to not throw a royal fit. If the Aurors had been anything but polite and hesitant, Harry would have demanded Draco be released at once. But his intention wasn't to make more of a scene. He had answered their questions as concisely as possible, all of which took no more than two minutes. But releasing Draco took another hour. It was ridiculous. He couldn't begin to imagine how humiliating the whole ordeal must have been for Draco.
years putting my past behind me. I've made certain that Scorpius never goes through what I had did. You ruin it all without a second thought! For what?! A picture-perfect day?!" Draco snatched up the magazine and hurled it across the room.
"Because I want it to be a surprise."
Draco didn't know how to respond to that. He averted his gaze instead and continued to drink the eggnog.
"Anything else?"
"Good, good." Theo shifted Scorpius over to his other arm so they could shake hands. "Surprised to see you here, I must say. I was expecting you to be an Auror or something else of similar caliber."
Draco returned to his senses with a jolt.
caught a peacock?"
"You're his father. You're allowed to make him feel entitled."
Scorpius wasn't sure yet. He pulled off a bigger piece and squished it in his hand. It was very greasy. "What should I make?" he asked Harry.
"I'll look really dumb." Scorpius' pout grew more pronounced.
"I know."
"When's dinner?"
Harry trailed off and glanced over at Draco. "Hardly your fault."
Scorpius finally opened his eyes. He had to heave to get air into his shuddering lungs. Once he realized that he was in his bedroom, safe with Draco, his sobs turned quieter. "Don't go," he croaked. He rested his cheek against his father's neck.
He jumped a foot in the air when he heard footsteps by the door. He zoomed over and pulled it open with a flourish.
Draco snapped his teeth together and whipped around at Harry. He struggled to sort out his thoughts, and it sure was quite the struggle. The only word that came out was, "Huh?"
Harry gathered Draco in his arms as they staggered into the middle of the foyer, leaving a trail of melting snow, wet shoes, and mittens in their wake. Harry broke away for just a moment to breathlessly ask, "Are the boys asleep?"
The hospital room rang with a loud wail as Scorpius spun around and threw his arms around Harry. Wrenching sobs burst out of him. His tears soon wet Harry's shirt. Harry held Scorpius tight. He whispered soft words that neither Patricia nor Ron could hear. Both of them made feeble excuses to get out of the room, leaving Harry and Scorpius to sort things out on their own.
"Teddy will be
Draco didn't speak until they had disapparated from the streets and landed on the grounds of the Malfoy Manor. "He asked me if Stori was going to be at that school thing on Friday. Just like that!" he finally exploded. "He acted like she was some kind of-" He broke off with a frustrated snarl. He stomped up the stairs and threw open the front door in a grand display of anger.
"Oh dear," the beautiful blonde woman cooed as she bent down to pick up her son. "Look at you! You're so grown up!"
"Yes, that's all."
important for Scorpius' future. Why do you think I fought so hard to get him into that school? I'm glad you two have made amends. It's all for your baby, right?"
"I'll tell Harry to grow up."
Patricia Hassleton had been Scorpius' au pair for the past five years, since he was a baby. A brunette in her forties with a soft shell, she adored her charge like her own son, despite him being nothing like the other children she had taken care of in the past. Until this year, she had been looking after him for the better part of the day. Now that she had the whole morning and afternoon to herself, she was still getting used to the routine of picking Scorpius up at three in the afternoon from school. "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry," she apologized as she reached down to hold his hand.
"Hey!" Teddy interrupted them. "Tell us about your Quidditch games. Scorpius hasn't heard about them yet. Harry's never lost a single match. He was a Seeker."
" An old gramophone was perched on one corner, blaring a Beatles vinyl. Victoire and Dominique danced beside Teddy, throwing their arms and legs about with wild abandon. "
The next morning, he was very surprised to find Scorpius marching towards him before class began. "Did you give my father my drawings?" he asked Harry with his arms folded across his chest, probably something he had seen adults do when they were miffed.
"Yummy. Lucky you. Is your throat sore?"
Before Harry could respond, Draco said, "Theo."
"Hey, now," Astoria tsked. "I missed you, Draco. Truly."
"Mhm." Harry had guessed as much. Malfoys always had an ulterior motive. Harry was used to ulterior motives. Soon after the war, he had made many 'friends' - people who needed help getting the right jobs and references, reporters wanting the exclusive scoop, those who rode his coattails. As far as he was concerned, it was par for the course. He didn't really care if the Malfoys used him to help themselves. What else was he supposed to do with all his unused persuasive powers?
Upstairs in the playroom, Scorpius had hastily shoved Teddy inside and shut the door to ensure they were alone. "Teddy, we've behaved so poorly," he bemoaned, repeating his nanny's words. He wrung his hands in front of him. "I think they're happier together. Or maybe they're sadder not together. Don't you think?" He looked up with wide, expectant eyes at Teddy.
you believe me, don't you?" Teddy proclaimed as he waved the letter in front of his friends' faces. Then he pulled it closer to read it. His eyes went wider and wider still as he skimmed the letter three times over. "Oh my goodness!" he hooted with laughter. Before his friends could ask, he had scrambled off of the bench and was racing down the Great Hall.
Once the mess was cleaned up, Harry was thoroughly exhausted. He excused himself so he could wash off the tomatoes from his hair. Draco, Teddy, and Scorpius were left alone then.
"I love you too," Harry managed to gasp out. Once Teddy let go of him, he finally breathed easier. "You're growing up way too quick, Teddy." He ruffled the boy's hair. "I remember when you were just
"And if you don't have anyone to take care of you?"
After their snack, they cleaned up all their crumbs and finished their milk before retiring to the living room where Harry laid out Scorpius' workbook on the coffee table that was just low enough for Scorpius to kneel beside and write diligently. Scorpius was even more nervous because Harry was sitting right next to him, watching him write. But he didn't make any mistakes and he flushed with pride every time he finished one line perfectly. Sometimes Harry helped him with some of the cursive letters so they could be curlier. Even though he never asked for help, he liked being helped if it meant that he could do things better. He was finished his work in record time too because he wanted to impress Harry, just like when he wanted to impress his father. He looked up at Harry after he had closed his book.
"Yes."
nice and I don't like you."
"But this is rather convenient, isn't it?"
Harry tried to look more presentable for Scorpius but his temper didn't allow him to look any less angry. Luckily, Draco was right behind. "Go to your room, Scorpius. Now," he said. Scorpius seemed to have half a mind to argue, then thought better of it. He shrunk away but didn't go any further than out of the hallway and into the living room where he stood by the pillar and strained to hear.
A short while later, Scorpius was sitting on the marble counter of his kitchen, his legs swinging under him, as he watched Harry mix honey and peanut butter in a bowl. He was making 'food that you play with'. Scorpius had been taught never to play with his food. Harry set the bowl beside the boy. "See? It's play dough," he said.
Harry hazarded a peek at Ron.
He reached to the side and clasped Harry's hand. Their fingers entwined. "For a minute."
"Yes."
"You could have," Teddy retorted. "It's called a sleepover because I get to sleep over."
Scorpius skidded to a halt in front of Draco first. "Dad, come play!" He grabbed Draco's elbow and tried to pull him up.
"Let it happen."
Harry chuckled and took the laces in his hands. "Where did you hear that?"
Draco finally opened his eyes, only to frown at his son. "What do you tell them?"
"Wow!" Teddy was captivated. "That sounds amazing."
Draco looked down at the slender wand between his fingers and began absentmindedly fiddling with it. "You said you wouldn't."
"Pardon me?"
"That is obviously confidential."
"You've still got fifteen minutes." Harry pushed himself up onto his elbows. "Didn't last long."
Astoria interjected by putting her hand over Scorpius' and saying, "That trick won't work." She told Harry, "Don't bother with him. He knows we won't want them. He's planning on keeping them for himself."
"He doesn't have any kids," Scorpius thought aloud.
"Touche."
Draco didn't know what Harry meant. "How's that?"
"Certain that she's here to stay?" Harry had heard this from many a divorced parent in his line of work. Mothers and fathers didn't want to introduce a new person into their child's life until they were certain. He supposed Draco was even more cautious than other parents because Scorpius' own mother wasn't 'here to stay'.
After dinner, the family settled in the living room for a nightcap. Soft music played in the background as assorted fruits and cups of tea were passed around. The children were quieting down considerably by then, leaving the adults to their own conversations. It was nearing eleven when Ginny was finally able to wriggle out of her mother's grasp and join Harry on the floor by the window. He had Rose in his arms and she was fast asleep. Ginny smiled as she stroked her niece's cheek. "I missed you all so much."
"Yeah." Scorpius knew Teddy would. "He's cool like that."
Harry nodded in understanding. He was merely surprised because he couldn't quite see Draco working
"On." Scorpius picked up a book from the pile at the foot of the bed. He had asked Patricia for them before she left. "I'll read to Dad. I'm not sleepy yet."
Harry pitched backwards, stumbled a step, and slipped spectacularly on ice, falling onto the snowy landing with a muffled thump. "Ow."
pale Scorpius while tending to what appeared to be a twisted ankle. Harry attempted to shoo the other children away but all of them insisted on staying and watching this excitement. Scorpius was worrying his lip and sniffling back tears. Gabrielle shrugged at Harry, as though to say the ankle didn't seem too bad. Harry ruffled Scorpius' hair to try to get him to look up. Scorpius ducked his head instead. Gabrielle hooked a finger under her student's chin and moved his head up so he could see her smile. He blinked away his tears and used the back of his hand to wipe his nose. "Can you walk?" Harry asked. Scorpius didn't answer. "Let's try," Harry encouraged as he helped the boy up. He was able to stand on one foot while keeping a tight hold on Harry's arm. "There we go." Harry waved a hand at Gabrielle so she would stay put with the other children.
"What?" Harry asked.
Harry couldn't say no to Molly's concern. She always went out of her way for him. He truly appreciated her. "That would be lovely."
"You aren't supposed to have fun when you're sick."
"That Halloween is a warped consumerist and, frankly,
Harry sighed for the umpteenth time while looking up at the ceiling from his slouched perch on the couch. It's what he had been doing for the past hour. Then he let out a pitiful groan and slid sideways so he ended up curled on the couch cushions with his knees pulled towards his chest and his arms wrapped around them.
The next morning, when they awoke to rowdy boys running around the manor, and Harry began fumbling out of bed, Draco pulled him back in. His chest was pressed to Harry's back, arms wrapped around his waist, and chin resting on Harry's shoulder. His eyes remained shut against the bright sunlight. It was hot under the sheets. He moved his legs to tangle them against Harry's. He was hopeless. He screwed his face at the thought. He was hopeless around Potter. He had always been hopeless around Potter. He listened to Harry's breaths even out, long and deep.
"Mhm."
Nearly every family member figured it was their moral duty to lecture Harry on the various devious reasons the Malfoys had befriended him. All of them seemed valid. In fact, they
"But my father said big boys don't cry."
Harry really wasn't expecting Ron to elbow him hard in the arm, jostling his sore shoulder wildly. "Ah!" he exclaimed. "What the hell?!" He gawked at Ron in astonishment.
your father. I would never do something you are uncomfortable with." Draco needed Scorpius to hear all this. "Tomorrow, at school, you will behave. When you see Harry, you will behave."
Harry brushed the splinter off of his shirt. He realized maybe he had to switch tactics. He asked, "Does Astoria tell Scorpius when she's seeing someone new?"
Harry quickly looked away, nodding.
draw my stars," Harry said as he grabbed a scrap paper off the table and drew a five-point star without lifting his pencil.
It was rather frustrating to behold.
my closet?" Harry exclaimed. His closet wasn't really a closet, to be fair. It was just a cupboard and a bunch of drawers stuffed with shirts and pants he had bought over ten years ago. Perfectly good shirts and pants too, he thought. But when it came time to annual Ministry hullabaloos, he had to break out the black tie attire he kept in the back of the wardrobe, shake off the moths, and begrudgingly wear it. This year, he had somehow misplaced the tie. He stood in front of the rows of ties of all colours and shapes neatly hanging from pegs. "You're too much."
Scorpius first responded with a glower. Then he retorted, "I don't have a problem."
"DID YOU HEAR ME?"
Draco waved his hand, vague once again. "All this. It doesn't bother you?"
Harry smiled. "Let's start with an easy question then. Sweet or salty?"
"Milk?"
Teddy gasped again. "The nerve!" He couldn't believe the gall. "The absolute nerve on you, Harry Potter! I am the
"Anyway," Harry decided not to press any further, "I'll be off." He made his way out the drawing room. "I'll pick Teddy up after breakfast. Maybe around ten." Draco followed him out to the foyer. Harry was pulling his damp winter coat off of the stand. "Oh, and the Weasleys are having a dinner in the new year, asked if Scorpius wanted to tag along." Draco handed Harry his scarf and nodded. Harry took the scarf and, while winding it around his neck, said, "Friends of convenience, right?" Draco supposed so, so he nodded again. Harry opened the front door and the sound of howling, biting wind slipped into the manor.
In the upstairs playroom, Teddy stretched his arms out for a few seconds before sitting up with a groan. He had to hunch over a bit to keep their makeshift tent intact. Otherwise his head would lift the whole thing off. He rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Did you sleep okay, Scorp?"
Scorpius really was growing up much too fast, Draco thought as he conceded with a smile and a nod. "I am very proud of you," he said. "You found all that out by yourself."
Draco dragged a hand through his hair. Deep down, he was glad that Harry wasn't having a fit like he was. One of them needed to be levelheaded at that moment. Ignoring Scorpius' question, he asked Harry, "What do we do?"
"Oh, really?"
Harry spent the rest of the hour preoccupied by what the little Malfoy boy had said,
"No, you didn't."
"But you'll be okay, won't you?"
"I see."
"Hmm?"
Theo, with Scorpius still in his arms, started walking down the street. Just as Draco turned to follow them, he heard a quiet, "Could I speak with you for a second?" He turned back, surprised.
A lot of people were mean to Draco. That's why Scorpius wasn't allowed to go out with him to the park or the library. He had heard Draco and Patricia speak about it. He liked his nanny. She was always sweet to him, answering his questions and keeping him company when he was bored with his books. But he would rather spend time with his family. The only family he knew was his father. He wanted to go out and play with Draco by the lake like the kids in his school. But some people didn't like to see that. Draco would always brush it off, saying things will change when Scorpius grew up. Now it turns out Harry Potter was his family too. And he has a cousin named Teddy. Like the bear. Scorpius wondered what his cousin was like. But he had
Harry clicked his tongue in exasperation. He had expected to hear this but it was still very frustrating. Prejudices ran high, especially within the Ministry. The Malfoys were the only Death Eaters who were acquitted, but that didn't mean Draco was in the clear. "How often?"
"Nice things?"
Scorpius felt calmer after hearing those comforting words. He unwound his arms from around Harry, keeping his eyes down and letting Harry wipe his cheeks dry. He felt loads lighter. He really believed that Harry would help him get better and better at singing. Because he knew he could count on Harry. Because he knew how much Harry cared. He gathered up his courage to ask, "Am I your favourite?"
"Ginny."
First there were the few who thought drawing hour was for throwing small pieces of rolled up scrap paper at each other. Then there were the few who liked to draw on
"I bet he's really happy now, it's been years since all that. You don't have to get married to be happy, you know? That's old-fashioned thinking." Now Patricia seemed to be comforting herself with her words.
"Thought you might change my mind."
"You need to start thinking."
Somehow he hadn't realized that Harry would feel the same.
But all of that had faded away as the memories of war became distant in people's minds as time passed. Draco had managed to get his hands on his current job a little over five years ago, just before Scorpius' birth. His desperation to support the new baby had led him to put aside his reservations and try hard to maintain a stable income. The hate letters and graffiti had stopped years ago as well, most likely due to a lack of retaliation on Draco's part. Eventually his last name merely elicited a sort of chill from many folks, but it did not invoke much hate or anger; just indifference.
Draco piqued a brow.
First thing he did was throw himself at Harry, because he knew no one else could have planned this. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" And then he threw his arms around Teddy, because he knew no one else could have made the decorations so outrageous. "This is awesome!" He couldn't stop giggling. This was everything he wanted. Best surprise birthday ever!
Ginny knelt on the rug beside Harry and peered at his downturned face. "You've been very preoccupied today."
"I would be happy to stay," Harry said.
The children's voices rang out in the auditorium, echoing against the walls. Five-year-olds hardly had a sense of timing or volume, but the charming picture of so many little boys and girls singing and, in some cases screaming, their voices away was enough to make all the parents beam. And what was even better than listening to nursery rhymes? Watching the children animatedly use their hands to mime the song word for word.
Draco knocked his elbow against Harry's arm, which made it slip into the sink full of suds. Dishwater splashed upward in spectacular fashion as Harry sputtered in indignation, drenched, while Draco walked away muttering, "Frustrating," under his breath.
"Every Christmas."
"Come here for a second."
"You must be bored."
Draco clenched his jaw and let go of Harry, then smoothed his sweater down, turned away, and began walking to the door.
Luna had said he hadn't changed, that he was just the same. He wasn't so sure about that, especially not when he caught himself staring at Draco fixing Scorpius' socks, or when he looked forward to their next explosive argument, or when he started wondering how he could spend more time at the manor. That did not sound like the same Harry Luna knew.
Draco had to cover up his laugh behind a cough. He set the quill down on his desk after managing a straight face. "Wherever did you get that attitude?"
He glanced at Draco, then turned his gaze back to the green grass they trod. "I was."
Draco slapped a hand to his forehead as he watched his son dig the pencil into paper. Scorpius spoke out loud while writing so he could sound out the words, which meant Draco knew exactly what was going on. "What in heaven's name are you writing, Scorpius?"
They ended up in the living room upstairs where Scorpius climbed on Draco's lap and Teddy sat across from them. The older boy was tapping his foot on the floor, a habit he had picked up from his uncle Percy. When he tapped his foot like that, it meant that he had something very stern to say. He sat forward and asked Draco, "How come you never visited me?"
"That's a big number."
"There would be no more lies."
"And everything sweet I can find," Harry finished.
"Where did you hear that?"
"Have you tried telling him it's not true?"
"Look, it's complicated. For Scorp's sake, I've had to sort some stuff out," Draco tried to explain.
"We helped him clean it up."
"What makes you think that?" Draco asked as he shuffled books together before putting them away on the shelf, taking care to keep his back turned to Scorpius. "Did he say something?"
Harry resorted to clapping his hands on Draco's cheeks and pulling him nearer. "Spit it out."
Draco tsked and bent down to pick up the pillowcase filled with candy. "I should go." He hefted the candy in his arms and started to close the door.
"Hearing you kills the mood," Draco lied as he eased onto the bed beside Harry. The truth was much worse. He pulled his trousers up, then took his wand out of his pocket and waved it once, cleaning them off. As each moment passed, the ludicrousness of what they had just done was setting in. Like a couple of teenagers, jerking each other off. What on earth were they thinking? Draco sat up and willed his fuzzy head to clear up. "What time is it?"
"It's bad."
Draco pushed him back down. "Let me see," he said again.
"Yup. I'll show you everyone. There's got to be at least
"I know. Words aren't as easy to clean up as ink, is it? That's why we have to be very careful with the words we choose." Patricia always knew. Scorpius was very glad for her. "Let's start by being extra nice to Harry at school."
"Upstairs with Teddy."
Meanwhile, Harry was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Theo Nott had just flagged him down. If he went, he would have to socialize with him, which wouldn't be a big deal if Malfoy wasn't with him. If he didn't go, he would look like a complete prat. After weighing his options for a bit and then seeing Scorpius wave at him as well, he dragged himself away from the doors and trudged over to them.
Scorpius stilled for a moment with his chin tucked against his chest and his shoe scraping against the rough cement steps. But then he kept walking his solitary path along the edge of the stairs. "Because… no one is
Draco pulled a face behind them before flicking his wand at Astoria's luggage and sending it off to her room.
"Of course, I am!" Harry wanted to melt through the floorboards and disappear. "Don't go reading into things a five-year-old brat wrote! I don't know what he was thinking."
He had been letting things happen. He knew all about 'letting it happen'. Most of his life, he let things happen to him. When you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, things do just tend to happen without your say so. He didn't make his father buy the entire Quidditch team Firebolts. He didn't make his mother send him on holidays to Italy and Spain for the summer. He didn't have to make them do anything. These things just happened to him. He let the Dark Lord mark him. He let his friend die in a Fiendfyre. He let Wizengamot take his mother and father away. He was no stranger to letting things happen.
"Of course, I did! Did you get
"Then why's he a teacher?"
Just as lightning flashed ominously, a figure staggered in, drenched. It bumped into the coat stand and, in an attempt to right itself, proceeded to fall instead, taking the coat stand with it. It fell to its knees before collapsing completely onto the floor. Motionless.
"Yes, coming," Harry sighed without complaint. He rocked upright and let Scorpius drag him over.
Harry unscrewed the lid off of one of the jars in front of Scorpius. "There you go. Try this first." He dug a butter knife into the creamy brown spread that smelled much too incredible.
Scorpius pouted while pulling on his pajamas. "Aren't you going to ask me what I want?"
"I... um... No, that's not... She doesn't bother me." Harry didn't know where Draco was going with this. "Wait, do
Scorpius hid his embarrassed face. "Of course I know you love me, Dad."
"I'm sure they're around the orchard somewhere," Scorpius insisted to Harry who had been listening intently for the past five minutes in the crowded hallway of the school where students were milling about waiting to be picked up, sheltered from the wet flurry outside. "Dad doesn't believe me though. He says there were peacocks when he was young, but they're probably all dead now. But I've seen them with my own eyes."
reason to-"
Harry laughed again.
Harry knelt down to meet Scorpius' anxious eyes and flushed cheeks. "You'll do fine," he said reassuringly. "You look dapper, you know all the words to the song, your friends will be singing beside you and it's going be splendid." Scorpius could feel tears welling up in his eyes and he was mad at himself for being unable to stop it. Harry clutched Scorpius' hands to try to steady them. "What's the
"What's this I hear about you joining Potter's gang?"
pauses."
"How much do you miss me?"
"What?"
He most certainly wasn't expecting Draco's reaction.
Scorpius was bewildered because his father had never rushed him like this in the morning before. "Are we late?"
"There is no talking you out of anything," Draco reminded her. "Did you check on the boys?"
"Patricia picks him up from school. You can come over for dinner, if you'd like."
made a bigger deal out of things and then everyone came rushing down to worry insistently until he was smothered. Usually he would have no problem being in that position. When Molly smothered him, it meant great food. When Ron smothered him, there were gratuitous compliments and an almost brave optimism. Today was slightly different, what with the Malfoys thrown into the mix.
Draco paused at the doorway leading into the kitchen when he realized that Patricia was preparing food. She looked up before he had a chance to slink away, making the situation a bit awkward for him. He walked in reluctantly, which didn't go unnoticed. Patricia hid her smile by looking down at the vegetables she was slicing for the salad.
Draco scowled at his son. "No, I did not. What makes you say that?"
Draco ran his fingers down the slightly worn wood of the wand. His father would admonish him for not taking proper care of it. A wand told stories about a wizard, Lucius used to say. It was a symbol of a wizard's pride and status. It was a privilege that must be honoured. His father would curl his lips in disgust if he saw the state of Draco's wand, scratched and pitted, dull from years of use and abuse. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had paid much attention to this wand. He touched the tip of it to his palm.
Draco slid his thumb over the condensation on his glass of water. "I didn't really know about him until a few years ago," he said. "And I'm not one to be curious."
"Why are you still here?"
"Fine. You?"
do something to warrant a time out. At least, he never would have. Harry slowed to a halt near the boy, unsure of what to say. Scorpius didn't notice until Harry cleared his throat. When Scorpius looked up and recognized who was standing beside him, a scowl drew across on his face. He turned away and faced the wall.
the time. He's always wrecking the kitchen. In fact, I'd be surprised if he didn't blow things up at least twice a month."
"Yeah. Harry."
"See?" Theo arched a brow at Harry. "Prickly." Then he looked thoughtfully at Harry. "How about you? Interested in some new investment opportunities?"
"What would you like to eat?" Harry asked him.
"Say no."
"At least have the decency to deny it," Astoria snarled. With the setting sun behind her, she looked a vision - fiery red halo silhouetting her golden hair and taut posture. She seemed ready to strike, like a coiled snake.
"Lift the arm off the record."
"What did they want?"
The other half would prove to be a bit more difficult.
"Daddy," Scorpius whimpered. His fingers were clenched into fists and they bunched up his father's shirt. "Don't go," he begged.
"I know her name," Draco said. He was met with silence. Scorpius obviously didn't believe him. "Really. I do."
"I'm really glad Harry came over today," Scorpius said before blowing bubbles away from the edge of the bathtub.
"Mhm."
"Come to bed?"
Rose wrinkled her nose. "That's silly." She tilted her head up at Harry. "What's his name?"
"Scorpius was waving that letter about for almost a month."
Draco interjected. "Astoria is a part of my life. She will always be part of Scorpius' life. Especially during the holidays, because it means a lot to them. They'll be close, despite... I mean, I hope you understand that."
Scorpius finally looked up at Harry. "I don't know what to say."
Draco, having handed a towel to his son in the bathroom, now sat on the floor in the hallway, his back to the wall, nearly breathless.
"Not particularly. It's just a lot of paper pushing and legalities."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?" he asked, even though he already knew the answer.
"Now, now." Harry rubbed circles on Scorpius' shuddering back. "Why would you say something like that?"
"I'm not sure," Draco said after a short pause. "There aren't many opportunities for someone like me."
"That's right," Teddy said with a firm nod. "You have me. My grandmother is your grandmother's sister. So we're cousins, you see? You're part of my proper family. And you know what else?"
"Come on, let's give your slave a break. We'll get Scorpius from school."
Scorpius couldn't get his voice out even though he was trying hard. He curled his hands into fists, scrunching up the sides of his trousers as he did so. His lips moved, but he couldn't sing. His throat was closing up and he couldn't stop trembling. It wasn't long before his eyes began pricking. Heat built up in the back of his throat. He couldn't remember the words. His legs shook. What was he going to do? His vision swam from tears. This was disastrous. He bit his lip hard. In a moment of panic, he jerked his eyes away from Gabrielle and looked to the back of the room.
"The scene you've caused." For an unusual second, Astoria was at a loss for words as the enormity of the situation overwhelmed her. But only for a second. There wasn't much that could strike her speechless. "This is absolutely the most selfish and irresponsible thing you have done. Have you lost your mind?" She was standing in the middle of the library, her furious presence knocking Draco down a few pegs. "You dragged Scorpius into a world of ridicule. Was it everything you had imagined? Was a roll in the hay with Harry Potter worth dragging my son through this shit?"
He saw a flare of red before him.
Scorpius tsked at his mother, sad that his plan was thwarted. At least he managed to come away with one candy cane. "You and Teddy will come over for Christmas, won't you?"
Harry wasn't the least bit surprised. "Aren't we always looking for a reason to celebrate early?"
made fun of me," Scorpius said in earnest. "He says if you tell people how you feel, then they can take care of you."
It seemed like a very big deal by the way everyone was now gawking at Teddy in awe. Here was a real live person who had seen a Dark Mark with his own two eyes. "Have you been to his house? I heard it's creepy in there, filled with ghouls and all."
"I thought you could mind Teddy for the day."
"Not even a fish?"
"Whatever shall I do with you, Scorpius?" Harry sighed. "You're just too smart for your own good."
"What? Really?"
The only light shining in his home was the one from the kitchen, where the sounds arose. He paused with his back to the wall and took a deep, strangled breath to summon up courage. Then he peeked in to see what he would have to handle.
A familiar lump rose in Harry's throat. How had he messed things up so? He had never, for a moment, thought that he would end up hurting Scorpius like this. In the end, all he could do was walk away.
Draco could never fully express the love he had for his son. He couldn't get the words out without sounding disingenuous, so he had stopped trying. But he would hug like this and Scorpius would understand. He loved his father too. He listened to their hearts, wondering how much older he would have to get before his heartbeat started sounding as loud as his father's.
Draco stroked Scorpius' cheek. "I love you too."
Draco pretended not to see Harry glancing at him when he collected Scorpius from school. He wouldn't acknowledge Harry grazing his arm anytime he walked past. When a hot cup of coffee was waiting for him in the kitchen, he knew it would have just a bit too much sugar in it.
Draco was seated behind his writing desk, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off that headache he always seemed to get whenever Stori lectured him. "Don't be crude."
"Malfoy-"
"Inevitably," Draco agreed.
With a loud snap, Harry shut the book in his hands and placed it back on the shelf. "A lot of history," he echoed under his breath. He walked up to Draco. "What do you plan on doing with them?"
He splashed cold water in his face to snap out of those spiraling thoughts. Nothing productive came of dwelling in the past. His gaze followed the swirling water going down the drain. Then he glanced over at The Quibbler laying on the granite countertop, drops of water wetting the cover. Theo had called it a publicity stunt. Ginny Weasley was this Quidditch season's sweetheart, after the nail biting match against the Falmouth Falcons at the European Cup finals that summer. As the captain of Holyhead Harpies, she had turned the team around in a spectacular fashion over the past few years, culminating in a fantastic championship match that had the country hooked. Being by Ginny Weasley's arm at the award ceremony would put even the most heinous criminal in favourable light. No doubt the tabloids would latch onto this new development. Last month's Witch Weekly was already forgotten, thanks to The Quibbler article.
Teddy and Scorpius shrugged in well-practiced unison. Speckles of rainbow sugar were stuck around their cheeks and chin.
Scorpius appeared dubious. "You already know how to draw stars," he guessed.
It's true. Ginny didn't look angry at all. She seemed sad instead. "You alright?" Harry hesitated before shaking his head. "Okay. I figured." She took his hand, made him sit on the couch, all the while pretending not to notice when he wiped his eyes. She sat beside him and opened the magazine to examine the incriminating photos. "Have you read it?"
Harry glanced at Draco for a moment before saying, "He's doing very well. He's a pleasure to have around." He smiled when Scorpius looked at him shyly. "You are," he assured Scorpius.
"Hello," Scorpius smiled shyly.
"I don't need you."
"I think you're a natural." Harry wasn't being patronizing. Scorpius really was growing fearless after each flight. "You'll be showing Teddy up in no time."
"Fine."
"How is that my fault? How old is this kid?"
There was a short pause on the other end. "Yes?"
Scorpius exhaled in one loud gush and took Harry's hand in his. "I'll play with you outside when I'm better. I promise," he said. "Today we'll play inside."
"I know!"
Luna finally brought the binoculars down. There were circular imprints around her unblinking eyes where the eyepieces had pressed into her fair skin. She cocked her head knowingly at Harry, then tucked an errant hair behind her ear. "So, you see why I can't help you," she said as she pulled herself out of the swamp, her galoshes squishing in the mud when she stepped onto firmer grass. "Who am I to stand in the way of love?"
"You didn't seem to mind. You kissed me back."
"Know what?"
He tapped his pencil against his chin. Now that all the pleasantries were out of the way, what did he want to ask Teddy? Should he just ask what happened to Harry? Or should he be more discreet?
"You let me fly."
Startled, Harry shot upright.
When Draco walked back downstairs, leaving Scorpius to dress himself, he found Harry in the vast library, flipping through old books of his father's. Harry looked up when he heard Draco, then said, "You have quite the collection."
Scorpius flew down to meet Harry, Draco trailing behind him. The boy had the biggest and proudest grin on his face.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Scorpius. "What?"
"Eep!" The boy scurried away.
"Then?"
Scorpius wished for more fun birthdays as he blew out seven candles on the brilliantly decorated carrot cake. He got many toys and books and art supplies. He ate enough sweets and drank enough juice to fill his yearly quota.
Truth was, yes, he did like Harry a lot. No, he shouldn't worry about what bullies think. What's the problem then? In Scorpius' mind, it was all so simply laid out.
"Stay here," Draco told his son.
"I'm sorry," Harry apologized. "It's just that, if she won't be able to make it, it's easier on Scorpius if you-"
"No."
Draco was on guard when he saw his son exit the school with Harry Potter. A scheme was afoot. Scorpius latched onto Draco's hand the moment he was close enough to reach it, squeezing him rapidly to telepathically let him know that Harry was about to say something absolutely outrageous.
convince Harry. But he didn't really care. The Malfoys wanted him on their side for the sake of Scorpius. Many people had benefited from him, why was this scenario any different? He knew that no amount of reasoning would help him get out of this mess, though, so he just listened, nodding and mumbling at the desired pauses while letting his mind wander. He had been expecting this. In fact, he was somewhat surprised that it had taken this long for the Weasleys to intervene in what they saw as a trap. He had been teaching Scorpius for nine months, been civil with Draco for half of that time.
"I'll leave you to it." The nurse winked at Harry before walking away, letting the poor man fend for himself.
"Will you?"
"I think so," Harry mumbled. He shifted his hand against the floor to sit up straighter, but let out a sharp yelp before he could readjust. Upon bringing his hand up, he realized that it wasn't just tomato sauce that was coloring his hand red.
Draco was sitting beside her, leaning his arm along the length of the back of the couch and his head rested on it, watching mother and son. His drowsy expression turned into an unpleasant frown when he realized that she was looking at him.
Scorpius folded his arms at his chest defensively. "What about me?"
"I don't know," Harry murmured. "I wasn't thinking. I guess I haven't been thinking for a while now."
"Oh, that." Draco relaxed. "It nourishes my soul."
Harry titled his head down to hide his amusement from Draco. What was he to do with this sweet boy? "Do you know what I heard some of the parents say?"
"But I
"Until yesterday I didn't think this mattered," Draco continued.
"Come on! We're here!" Teddy shouted before disappearing down the other side of the knoll.
Now he really did huff. "Well," he snapped, no longer bothering to stay polite. "I teach at this school. I am your son's teacher. Will you be able to come by soon?"
From the other room, they heard a clatter followed by a dismayed, "Oh no," that prompted Harry to pull away.
It was a little before six when Draco awoke. He reached over instinctively and he felt an empty bed. He rolled over. Harry wasn't there. He sat up and looked around. The sun was barely peeking at the sky, so the room was filled with soft shadows. There was no sign of Harry. Draco fell back into bed with a quiet groan. As he did so, he heard a quiet rustle beside him. He looked over and saw a small note resting on the pillow to his side. He picked it up, holding it up over his head to squint at the scrawling words in the faint light.
"Sorry."
Draco stumbled out of bed in fright, grabbing his wand blindly. He didn't even bother with the lights as he raced to Scorpius' room. He threw the door open in anticipation of a fight. Instead, he found his son sitting up in bed, crying his heart out. He rushed to Scorpius and pulled him close. Scorpius curled into Draco's arms, trembling as he sobbed. "Wake up now," Draco soothed. "Did you have a bad dream?"
strange conversation he was having with his teacher. But he was a Malfoy, after all. He narrowed his eyes at Harry and then turned around to leave without another word.
"So... nothing, I guess." Harry wasn't looking forward to this shindig he had let Hermione rope him into. Every year, he was guilted into attending either a charity affair, celebration of life, or gala put on by the Ministry of Magic. Once the Boy-Who-Lived, always the Boy-Who-Lived, even after fifteen years. He would have to mingle with witches and wizards he would promptly forget the names of, pretend to be interested in policies he had no sway over, and generally be available for press photographs when he shook hands with countless dignitaries. "I wish I didn't have to go." Harry let out a martyred sigh. "It's dreadfully boring. Borderline unbearable. But someone has to do it."
For the first time, Harry saw a genuine expression on Scorpius and he couldn't help but laugh this time.
Hermione handed her husband a plate of fresh apple pie, exchanged a meaningful look with him, then gave the second plate to their best friend who hadn't said more than a handful of words all dinner long. They were gathered in the living room with their desserts, the children already in bed. The three of them made sure to meet at least twice a month, a time to catch up and reminisce.
"Who do you want to spend Christmas with?"
Draco shrugged noncommittally.
Harry was astonished to find dimples on his cheeks. That must be from Astoria. Scorpius was quick to compose himself and hide his smile though. "I won't," he promised. "You're nicer than him too. But I still like him better."
"We have already called your emergency contact. They should be here any moment."
"-you should tell me if-"
"Yeah, right," Harry snorted. "You'll forget all about us when you get on that train."
that their teeth fall out," Scorpius answered honestly. "I tried it one day and I got into trouble. So I don't do that anymore. Instead I told my teacher and they got in more trouble. Serves them right."
"But you did those bad things long ago. It doesn't matter anymore."
Teddy threw a dirty look at Harry before turning to Draco. "Are you sorry too?" he snarled.
"Sucks to be you," Harry hummed.
Draco was taken aback. Scorpius
"Sweet dreams."
Harry was handing out candy canes to the children. He wore a bright red winter sweater with flashy yellow and green lights trimming the edges. Beside him was his partner in crime, Gabrielle, dressed in a gingerbread man costume. The kids were milling around them, their hands outstretched for some sweets. Scorpius had no qualms about joining the masses, peeling away from his parents to get a piece of the spoils.
Theo clinked the cold stones in his glass impatiently. Like pulling teeth. "I mean... are you really?"
Still, Harry kept trying.
Draco was troubled that night, for many reasons, but especially because of the conversation with Scorpius. His heart broke at the idea of his son growing up so quickly. Neither of them were good at speaking their minds when it came to difficult topics, so they simply didn't. Draco was beginning to realize that perhaps they should have been speaking about this weeks ago instead of letting doubts fester in Scorpius' head. He should have been letting Scorpius know from the start that he was the most important person. He should have been saying it since the day Scorpius was born instead of keeping those words to himself. Maybe then...
"I've made you sad, haven't I?"
He couldn't remember what he had been so afraid of.
"You said spontaneous," Harry repeated as he faced Draco fully.
"Yeah."
Scorpius let Draco tuck him in and he didn't make a sound when he was kissed on the cheek. Draco furrowed his brows questioningly. Scorpius responded to the look by saying, "I love you."
Draco glanced past Harry to find Astoria standing at the foot of the front steps, surrounded by presents at her feet.
"TOWEL, DAD!"
Harry ignored her and glared at Teddy. "Don't open my letters, you brat."
Now Scorpius looked unsure. "I… um… My friends at school said that… Harry doesn't have a mother or father."
"Right."
Draco thought otherwise.
Harry frowned as Draco turned to look at him. "Huh?"
Harry was inundated with Weasley well-wishes and food that afternoon. It turned into an impromptu gathering in his kitchen, in fact. Molly insisted that he still wear the sling for another day, so he was halfway useless, smiling helplessly at the ruckus around him. He wondered if the Weasleys were maybe making up for the past few months.
"Theo, you tell me," Scorpius sighed. "My father's being silly."
"This is not the time to be reasonable!" Ron couldn't believe Hermione. "Look at them. I mean,
"Well, well, well," Theo hummed. "Not so glamorous now, is he?"
Draco was breathless from all the running. He took an uncertain step into the room.
"Squirrels."
"Harry taught me," Scorpius said. "We just finished our flying lesson." He then proceeded to show his father how he could do up the other shoe as well. "It's actually really easy. Easier than when Nanna does it."
He couldn't take that away from them.
"What do they say?"
"Oh, I like homework," Scorpius told him. "You can make me do homework. I'll show you." He liked accomplishing tasks that his teachers gave him in his workbook. He liked to do them neatly because, then, he would get stickers of stars on his paper. He could show that to Astoria. She would love them. He liked feeling smart. He slipped his hand out of Harry's to wipe it on his pants to get rid of the clamminess. He must have warm hands like Harry too because his was sweating. He reached out to hold his teacher's hand again. "Do you live all by yourself when Teddy's at Hogwarts?"
Scorpius giggled. In hindsight, that had been funny to see his teacher sitting on the ground with sauce all over him. "When will my father pick me up?"
By the time Scorpius clamored downstairs, he had all of twenty minutes to gobble up his eggs and toast, pack his lunch into his brand new backpack, and stuff his feet into his shoes. Draco helped him with his bag while Patricia did up his shoelaces. "We better get going now," she told him.
"Nothing."
"Fine."
Draco wasn't so sure. "Remember that time, you asked if it were someone else, whether I'd care." The answer was simple. "This would be a lot easier if you weren't Harry Potter." Being Harry Potter in this day and age still held a rather significant amount of power and responsibility. A fling with Draco Malfoy would quite possibly be considered the most irresponsible thing Harry Potter could do. "You're a celebrity. The Golden Boy. People practically worship the ground you walk on." To Scorpius, there was the added dimension of Teddy being his cousin, and by proxy calling Harry Potter his family. When, in the not-so-distant future, Harry and Draco couldn't see eye to eye, it would be Scorpius who would be caught in the middle with no real idea of what happened between them. "I like having a private life, without people scrutinizing my every move. So does Scorpius. It would be a disaster for all of us if anyone found out." Draco decided to leave it at that. This was enough torture for one day. Maybe more tomorrow. "Anyway." He stretched his arms above his head with a quiet groan. "Want to have sex?"
Harry tsked when he understood. Malfoy wasn't safe at home. "Do you have somewhere else you can go?"
"It's okay." Scorpius squeezed Draco's hand. "I don't want to see my cousin."
Scorpius shook his head.
"Huh?" Scorpius hiccuped while fiddling with his father's tie.
That evening, Harry walked Scorpius down the stairs and towards the fence where Draco stood, glaring at everybody. From the looks of it, the man apparently hated all children except his own son. He glared at Harry too, but Harry was used to it. He had been glared at by Malfoy all his life. It was no big deal to him. Draco picked Scorpius up in his arms. "He didn't strain too much today," Harry reported dutifully.
those letters, he liked yours the best. He wouldn't put it down or quit smiling for a whole day, can you believe it? Of course, he loves you two. He thinks the world of both of you."
Harry felt as though he had been struck, like he had the wind knocked out of him. He stuffed his trembling hands in his pockets. Everything Draco said hit so close to home that he couldn't speak. Blinded by frustrated tears, he stormed out before he heard anything else he would regret.
"Yes, that's my teacher's name." Scorpius nodded. Then he turned and pointed at Harry who was standing by the door, regulating traffic. "There he is. That's my teacher."
"My mum said that Harry was the bravest boy in all of Hogwarts."
The moment Draco opened the door to 12 Grimmauld Place, he heard music. It was muffled, it was loud, and it was rock. He followed the sounds to the stairs leading down to the kitchen.
"Alright, alright," Harry coughed.
"Do you need me?"
Harry let that comment slide. "Teddy wanted to come over."
Teddy marched over to his cluttered table and picked up a mysterious black bag that fit in the palm of his hand. He held it out to Scorpius.
"But how do I clean
Teddy narrowed his eyes and his smile turned into a very sly smirk. "That's a secret," he said. "You know something? I was glad that you agreed to come visit me. I don't know much about you at all, but I really want to know more. I don't have a proper family except for my Grandmum."
"No one has come to collect you yet."
"Have I?" He picked his head up and marveled at her inquisitive brown eyes, faintly freckled cheeks, tumbling red waves of hair, and he wished he could want her.
"The absurdity of all this," Draco said, gesturing between them. "Being here, in the manor, with me, after everything that's happened. Why doesn't it bother you?"
"Sure. He's my friend," said Scorpius. "He's Dad's friend too."
Draco wiped some dust off the horn. "Worse things to hide, I suppose."
"No."
of them."
Harry poked his head out from behind the Christmas tree that he was decorating. Rose and Hugo were playing with some toys in front of the crackling fire. Hermione was fiddling a wreath while Ron picked at caramel popcorn from a bowl on the sofa. Teddy had just walked into the living room carrying an armful of letters. He had taken the liberty of opening one, and he was making a sour face while reading it. "Are those mine?" Harry asked as he got up to his feet.
"It matters to me too," Harry confessed. And, with that, he took his hand off of Draco's leg. "I like you." He placed the wand atop the barrel, beside Draco, and hesitated for a moment. "That is..." He looked at Draco without pretense and repeated, "I like
"No."
"This is in relation to an incident that occurred in Cardiff Saturday night. Standard procedure, Mr. Malfoy."
They flipped through pages and pages of broomstick history, gawking at old illustrations that showed posh women sitting atop a broom with sour expressions on their faces and wind whipping their cumbersome skirts to the right and left. They read the book until Harry nodded off onto Teddy's shoulder.
"You'll wake me up, won't you?"
"Oh?"
"Consequences matter. Time doesn't change the fact that I hurt a lot of people. They might forget what I look like or what I said and did, but that doesn't change the past."
Scorpius often sat and read with his father. On Sundays, when it was cold out and they had nothing to do, they would sit on the floor of the playroom by the window and read for hours. The house would be quiet and the only sounds in the room would be of pages flipping. Sometimes those sounds made him sleepy and he would take a nap. In fact, he was feeling a nap coming along now.
"For the sake of our sanity."
Scorpuis pondered Harry's circumstance further. "Maybe
Draco eyed the chilly grounds covered in a fresh foot of snow. "That was the idea," he said deliberately. "I want to speak to you. But I'd rather speak inside."
"Yes, yes," Draco conceded. "You are all knowing and I'm just your lowly servant, here to serve her highness."
"We're searching all possible avenues."
When Harry skidded to a halt at the foyer, a shoe was already flying at his head. He ducked in time to dodge it, but he was still hit by the matching pair that headed straight for his stomach. "Oof!" He cowered as more shoes rained on him. "I don't know what happened!" He tried to dodge his way through the deluge. Draco moved on from shoes to the next thing he could get his hands on, which were umbrellas and book bags. Harry had to resort to magic to stop from getting an eye poked out. He swept his wand to the side, flinging all the flying objects against the wall. He finally managed to get to Draco and placed firm hands on his shoulders before he could go hunting for more things to throw.
Scorpius could hardly believe his eyes when he arrived at the park on his birthday, hand-in-hand with Astoria and Draco. His parents had promised a surprise, but this?! He gasped. There were red, blue, yellow, and green balloons and twisted glittering streamers and a huge cake that was shaped like a broomstick and
"Just a few hours," Harry assured him. "And, don't worry, I won't make you do
"On the ground?"
Draco stilled. "Here?" he hesitated.
"This would never happen to you."
"He won't come over to our house anymore. I won't keep any secrets from you. Everything will go back to the way it was-"
"I thought I would give it a try." Theo waved his fork around flippantly, as though anyone could just wake up one morning and decide to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. "Honestly, Harry, not as difficult as you would think."
The year-end pageant was nothing to laugh at. All the students converged in the main auditorium where seats were plush, stage was raised and curtains were made of regal purple velvet. To say Scorpius was nervous was an understatement.
"Oh, 'that's all'. Right," Theo parroted. "Sure, that's all, Draco. He's just teaching your son. No big deal. It's just Harry Potter. Wiping up Scorp's snot." He cackled at the image. "Have you talked to him yet? Been a bit civilized?"
"I have nothing but the best interests of Scorpius in mind."
"I'll look after Harry," Scorpius said eagerly. "He'll be all better in the morning."
Hermione and Ron exchanged looks. The real problem here was Draco Malfoy, of course, but there was no convincing Harry at that moment in time. He wasn't in the right frame of mind. His skewed sense of morality and stubbornness wouldn't let him see reason. He wouldn't care if he was being patronizing. He would stay loyal until the bitter end. The couple figured they had done all they could do for now. They said their goodbyes, ignoring Draco altogether, and walked out, leaving the house silent.
"I don't care if you tell him," Scorpius retorted. "And you don't have to pretend to like us anymore. We've gotten into enough trouble already."
Harry pushed off the counter. "I should go."
Harry glanced at Ron in dismay before pushing off the pillows and swinging his legs off the bed, wincing when a stabbing pain pierced his shoulder as he got up unsteadily. He hobbled over to Scorpius with some effort. "I'm okay. I didn't mean to scare anyone." He rested a hand on Scorpius' shoulder to try to get him to look up. "Would I be lying?"
Scorpius nodded and held still when Hugo rested his hand against Scorpius' ear. But he wasn't expecting the baby to grab a handful of his hair and pull hard. His head jerked down and he hissed in pain. Before Hermione could do more than gasp in dismay, Scorpius had his fingers wrapped around Hugo's wrist. "That hurts," he chided as he managed to get his hair away from Hugo's itching fingers. "You have to be gentle with me too, baby," he said. "You can't pull my hair, okay?"
"I'll keep that in mind."
"Did you stop by yesterday?"
Teddy was standing on top of the banquet table, crooning into a wooden spoon. "
"Draco...?"
not nice."
"Your favorite student, apparently," she smirked. "Scorpius Malfoy, it says." She showed the letter to Harry through the fire. "Interesting kid. He wrote it to Teddy. Teddy sent it to me."
"Good. I didn't go to school today."
His argument with Malfoy had been ringing in his ears for the past few days as guilt wormed its way deep into his gut and gnawed. He couldn't figure out what had possessed him to say those inappropriate things to a student's parent. Well... he
Harry looked at Theo, then at Draco, then quickly back at Theo again, saying, "Oh, I don't want to impose," because Draco had just glared at him from behind Theo's back with his lips drawn into a thin line, shaking his head while his nostrils flared, clearly wanting Harry to say no.
And just outside, he found Harry kneeling on the floor with Scorpius, hugging him tight.
Draco finally looked up at Harry.
"Hmm." Harry had figured as much.
"Draco-"
"I don't know how."
Everyone turned to look at Victoire Weasley, who was perched on a windowsill, Butterbeer in hand and examining her fingernails with sudden interest.
"The children are making some crafts for parents. I was wondering if Scorpius could expect to see his mother there as-"
Astoria wriggled her nose. "They are growing boys." She set the heavy plate on the counter in dismay. "I don't want to dump these. Shall I pack some for you, Harry?" She cocked her head in concern when she noticed Harry massaging his temple. "Oh, headache? I've got a tincture in my trunk. It's marvelous. Works like a charm."
After the winter pageant at school, Scorpius was handed a bouquet of flowers by his mother, as well as two hearty kisses on his cheeks for his wonderful performance as a reindeer in the play his class had put on for the parents. His button nose was painted black and he wore felt antlers on his head. Absolutely ridiculous, if anybody had bothered asking his opinion. The adulation was nice though. He smiled bright at Astoria and graciously smelt the flowers. These bouquets were getting more and more outrageous. At this rate, by the time he had completed school, he would hardly be able to hold the mountain of flowers his mother would shower on him. Astoria was singing praises about him remembering all his lines and what a perfect little reindeer he was. Draco patted Scorpius' back because he couldn't get a word in edgewise. The three of them were walking through the cheery corridors of the school when they bumped into Harry.
They had reached 12 Grimmauld Place by then. Harry helped Scorpius out of his shoes and jacket, hanging up his backpack as well before ushering him down into the kitchen. Scorpius had his hands clasped shyly in front of him while he watched Harry get to work. Watching adults use magic was fascinating. It was amazing to see the things they could do. Like how Harry had conjured up white plates along with white mugs out of thin air.
"Heh," George snickered before he could stop himself, receiving a glare from Molly. "Finding some levity in the situation, Mother."
"I got a ton of presents, you wouldn't even believe it." Scorpius began rattling off all the gifts he had found under the tree and in his stocking a week ago. Meanwhile, Theo had flagged Harry down. As soon as Harry approached the trio, Scorpius added, "Oh, and, and Harry got me this scarf, you see?" He showed off the grey knitted scarf tied around his neck. "It's warm and looks nice, doesn't it?"
"Potter?"
Draco carefully brushed some specks off the table so he wouldn't have to look at his son. "No. I don't have a problem," he answered.
Harry took a breath, to begin to speak.
They were in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Typically, being admitted to St. Mungo's meant something was awfully wrong with you. Unfortunately for Harry, any injury he incurred resulted in a huge hubbub. Sometimes he felt as though he was treated like porcelain instead of the Boy-Who-Lived. That day, he had been placed in a rather swanky private hospital room despite his protests. He wished he could just be in his own bed instead of being fawned over something so silly.
His gaze roved over the back of a trench coat-clad figure standing over his sink, also dripping with water from a downpour; which was strange because it wasn't raining outside. The man stood casually enough, with his slim shoulders relaxed and his head bent down. Draco held his breath and readied his wand while sidling over to stand squarely in the doorway.
"I'm Rose."
Predictable and-
There was a knock at the door and a muffled voice called out, "Are you done fighting?"
"Yes."
Scorpius was definitely not trying to keep quiet now.
"Get out of my house," Draco finally managed to heave out. He didn't care why Potter was in there. He just wanted him gone. Now.
and didn't say a word to me." He sat forward to give Draco a very disappointed look. "The least you could do is let me make my pitch."
Embarrassed by her theatrics, Harry chuckled and pushed her back. "Oh, stop that."
"Is he nice to you too?" Scorpius interrupted.
"It's just a few days."
"Alright."
"Nanna?"
When Harry glanced up from his reading, he found Scorpius sleeping with his head against the cushion and legs curled up. He glanced down at his watch. It was only seven and the boy was already asleep. Maybe he had been tuckered out from school. Harry rolled his neck and arched his achy back one more time before conjuring up a thin blanket. He draped it over Scorpius.
Teddy caught him looking and he smiled knowingly. "You're way too quiet, Scorpius," he remarked. "You should talk more."
He all but huffed. "Yes."
"I believe you," Harry agreed. "Do you think you'll be alright for the night?"
"Hello, Patricia," Draco greeted. "You didn't have to make dinner."
As the children were being put down for nap-time, he knelt beside Scorpius who was busily fluffing up his pillow and neatly brushing down his sheets. After a few months of watching the boy perform the same rituals, some of the children who slept around him had also started doing the same, 'making their beds' before nap-time.
Draco wasn't in the mood for this conversation so early in the morning. He twisted his arm to hide the Dark Mark.
Harry flushed when he remembered that first letter from Scorpius. "Teddy loves writing letters to his cousins. He was thrilled when he got one from Scorpius," he told her. "In fact, they've already seemed to have made plans for the summer."
Draco stumbled into a bookshelf beside Harry. His head and elbows smacked into the mahogany with a resounding thud. "Ow!" He scowled at Harry. "What?"
Scorpius hollered in delight. "Teddy!" He grabbed his cousin and dragged him inside, snow and all. "This is the best surprise! Merry almost-Christmas!"
"Not as complete as the day before."
Draco inhaled slowly as he was roused from his sleep.
"Are we?" Harry faltered as Draco opened the door to reveal his only heir dressed in ripped rags, blood dotting his green-tinged face, holding a severed foot in one hand and an empty pillowcase in the other.
"Chocolate syrup."
'Real smooth,' Harry mouthed.
Draco knew that Scorpius hadn't minded in the past. But, ever since he started school, he seemed to mind a bit more than before. Seeing his friends with their mothers must be hard on him. Scorpius never complained though. "Didn't you have a hard time?" Draco asked instead of answering Harry's question.
"And a mistake," Draco was quick to add, now kicking himself for saying the wrong thing. "That was definitely-"
Harry turned around to look down at the Malfoys, shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand and raising the other in a short wave. Scorpius waved back happily.
Hermione walked over to Scorpius. "Can I look?"
Scorpius offered half his s'more to Harry. "Hmm?" he asked enticingly.
"What does that have to do with-"
"I know."
Harry stifled his exasperated sigh and sat quietly with his hands folded on his lap while he listened to many pieces of unsolicited advice flying at him from all corners of the crowded dining table full of redheads. He was at the Burrow for brunch and he should have known something was up. Rumors had been flying around through Ron's accounts of Harry's talks and Teddy's weekly letters. The Weasleys had heard enough to point incriminating fingers at the Malfoys.
"You aren't sick anymore."
doing here?!" Just how many 'emergency contacts' did that nurse call?
"How long is a moment?"
The boy shrugged.
"Who's that?" Scorpius raced out of the study, across the corridor, down the grand staircase, and into the foyer where he threw open the door expectantly.
"What's going on?" Harry looked down at the magazine. "Oh my God!" He looked up at Hermione and Ron in horror.
"Sheesh." Teddy threw an arm around Scorpius. "No wonder Harry likes you." He flipped the page of his album. "Let's look at some more of these." He started pointing out different people. "I think you'll like Dominique the best. She's not like you at all. She loves to talk. You can listen to her all you want." He tapped at the photo of a pretty blonde girl in one of the Christmas pictures. "She's probably the same age as you too. If you want to come over to the Burrow tomorrow, you can see her."
"One second you say you hate him, and the next, you're crying over him."
"But Nanna will pick me up."
Teddy screwed up his face to concentrate. Right in front of their eyes, his features morphed so that his skin grew lighter, his nose became longer, his lips got thinner and his hair turned from brown to messy black. The Malfoys gawked at the lightning scar that etched itself on Teddy's forehead. The boy opened his eyes to reveal his brilliant green eyes and wiggled his eyebrows up and down.
Draco dragged his hand over his face. Harry didn't know. How could he? "Isn't this enough?"
Draco could have exploded.
"Your mother's waiting in there," Draco murmured and jerked his thumb into the classroom. Scorpius nodded before scurrying away.
"He taught me a lot about flying, you know? Next time I'll go even higher."
Draco, however, came to an abrupt halt. His patience suddenly snapped into nothing. He spun around on his heel and stomped down the hill. He felt immensely satisfied when he heard Harry yelp an exclamation. He would go no further. He was getting out of this uncomfortable outfit, taking a much needed cold shower, and reading his book in peace.
"I can take care of you if you want to be a baby sometimes," Scorpius promised his father. He had never had to take care of anybody before. "I can be
The enormity of all that singing didn't strike him until the thunderous applause that followed. His eyes snapped up to the audience and, though he couldn't make out a single face because of the lights above his head, he could hear their cheers.
Scorpius buried his face against Harry's chest and fell asleep a few moments later.
"I'm glad to see you two getting along."
"Wait-"
Draco had a way about him, an aloof air that Harry begrudged. When they were younger, Harry had assumed that Draco was putting on a pretentious act. Once in a while there would be cracks, like the disastrous bathroom incident in Sixth Year or when Draco had asked Harry to take care of Scorpius if anything were to happen. But those cracks would soon smooth over into an effortless mask of apathetic superiority. Harry began to wonder if maybe it wasn't an act after all. Maybe Draco really was a cold person.
Scorpius rested his hands on the arm of the chair, tilting forward so his face was right up close to Draco's. "If Harry were here, you would let me, right?" he asked sweetly.
Scorpius was fast asleep not ten minutes later, a blissful expression on his face as he lay enveloped in a plush blanket in the middle of his own huge king-sized bed, his brand new broomstick clutched in his hands. Draco and Astoria stood on the balcony of the suite, enjoying a final glass of ice wine in the cool breeze. Astoria rested her head on his shoulder while looking out into the dark gardens and starry sky. "Thanks for joining us, Draco. I wish it didn't have to end."
"Teddy's different." Harry couldn't think of a single person more unlike Scorpius than Teddy. "He likes the attention. He's not bothered by how absurd my life is. He's grown up with me. Scorpius isn't like that. He's shy, quiet. He's sheltered. Draco has-" He broke off.
He spent the rest of lunch worrying about this and that. He couldn't even remember what he had eaten or any of the conversation topics going on around him. The more time he spent with Potter and Teddy, the more anxious he was becoming. He kept telling himself that he was concerned for his son, but he was also concerned for himself. This was not something he had planned for. He had planned for everything else but not this.
"I don't want to talk about it." Scorpius walked out the room, leaving Draco to scratch his head in puzzlement. If the kid was already acting this way, Draco would have his hands full when puberty hit.
"No. You said Holeyeheed Harps. It's Holyhead Harpies."
Theo, meanwhile, was roaring. "Oh my, Scorpius! Where did you hear that?!"
Harry winked at him. "Alright, then. Will you still come say hi to him?"
"Oh, just wait."
Before Draco could blurt anything out, he was grabbed by the arm and pulled away firmly by Astoria. The two Malfoys stumbled along after her confident strides through the lines of milling parents, and Draco could hear her mutter under her breath, "Leave that poor man alone."
Harry couldn't say he was too surprised when, after school the next day, he found Draco outside his classroom. Scorpius happily ran up to his father. But Draco patted his head and said, "I need to speak with Harry for a moment. Are you fine playing outside?"
