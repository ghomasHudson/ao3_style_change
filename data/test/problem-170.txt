“So the sex should be pretty spectacular. I bet you could both get into some really erotic positions.”
Harry took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. It was okay. He wasn’t fired. He wasn’t in trouble, and reluctantly he admitted Roger might have a point. He could use some time to brush off all the vivid images Mike’s words had brought to mind and the sudden flare of lust that accompanied them.
Malfoy rubbed his chin thoughtfully, “The hardest part was the Hippogriff feathers. They’re not really monitored but they’re also not used in too many common potions so apothecaries don’t stock them. If you want them, you have to get them from the source. Millie didn’t have any Hippogriffs in her sanctuary so I had to go into the wild.” He shivered and glared at Harry. “I hope you know what hell I had to go through for you, Potter. Luckily, I had a year, so I could visit herds and pick up their discarded feathers rather than corner one and pluck it.” He shivered again and there was a vague look of horror in his eyes.
“I live in the block of flats on Higgins Road with the giant toadstool statue in the garden,” Harry contributed, watching as Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up and his mouth dropped open, the same thoughts clearly running through his head.
Harry scrutinised Malfoy’s face, eyes darting briefly to the stool, and searching for any sign of offence so he knew how to proceed. He couldn’t find anything as Malfoy’s expression was blank and more inscrutable than it had been in school, when he’d worn his emotions plainly for everyone to see. Well, for
Harry laughed again at Malfoy’s indignant expression and the way he drew himself up, a pout on his lips. “And why is that so funny?”
Harry licked his lips thoughtfully. There were so many questions he wanted answers to, he’d just added more as the night had gone on, and he had to pick carefully. This could be the only question he managed to get an honest answer to.
him. He didn’t know the intricacies of his emotions, the complexity of his relationships, what he was like in his quiet time, his intimate thoughts or what he was like now, although he felt an increasing desire too. However, what Harry did know was that Malfoy would
“Ah, no, just me. Can’t believe he brought me up in conversation,” he grimaced, “I’m guessing none of it was positive. We weren’t exactly friends.”
And then the dangerous questions. What was Malfoy like now? He seemed relaxed and reasonable with his gang, and acted like an actual decent human being, but was that reserved for them or was he like that with everyone? Was it all an act? Could he ever act like that with Harry? Could they be friends? What would he think of Harry? Was he suffering the same fate as Harry right now? Questions running through his brain with no answers? Did Harry want to talk to him? Did he want to get to know him better? Did he want to-?
She sidled up to the bar and rested her arm on the sticky top without flinching, smiling at Harry in a way he was sure was supposed to be semi-sweetly but instead made her look like a hungry shark.
And Harry could forget too. Forget what he’d lost, all the friends who couldn’t celebrate with him, and instead focus on what he still had.
He wondered if he’d somehow inhaled all the fumes from the alcohol and had managed to get drunk himself.
“Please. People are going to be talking about this for weeks,” Harry said lightly, hiding the fact the thought that he’d subconsciously chosen Malfoy over his friends terrified him slightly. “They won’t remember it was my birthday until September. I can celebrate with Ron and Hermione at the weekend or something.”
It appeared Bruce didn’t believe in beating around the bush nor did he have any sort of knowledge of social norms. People didn’t just ask someone they met four seconds ago about their romantic life.
Harry flinched when he saw one man shove another out of the way to get a better view and a fistfight broke out. “Me and some of my friends went to The Hog’s Head for drinks to celebrate my birthday.” Harry turned back to look at Malfoy uncertainly. “Um, you knew it was my birthday?”
They fell into an uneasy silence, the air tense and heavy with things left unsaid and neither one of them knowing how to react. As minutes passed with no movement from either of them, Harry started to panic that this would be it for the night, that all his questions would remain unanswered and the things he’d been worrying about would be for nothing; Malfoy would turn around, go back to his friends, and never talk to Harry again. But he couldn’t find the courage to be the one to break the increasingly oppressive silence and with each passing second it became more and more difficult to do.
Mike hummed, “And all that tension that built up being on opposing sides. Probably turned sexual at some point. Did you ever release it? Did you have hate-sex in the showers?”
There was a soft chime from the back room and Malfoy turned to look towards it. He snapped his head back to Harry and started to rise.
Seb jerked his head in the direction of Malfoy’s table, “The handsome studmuffin you’ve been mooning over since he came in. He bought his round from Terrence when you were on break.”
“Oh,” Harry said. He frowned when Seb’s words caught up to him. “I have not been ‘mooning’ over him.”
what house you were in. Your identity is not determined by the colour of your robes or what table you sat at for breakfast. We’re all adults, with jobs in different fields, relationships based on love; what was the centre of our world at school barely crosses our mind now.” Malfoy seemed to realise he'd been rambling and shot an embarrassed look at Harry. “At least, that’s how I feel.”
After a brief moment of hesitation, Harry strode wordlessly forward and flung the newspaper on the counter, raising his eyebrows.
is why nobody managed to spot me. Because Ministry employees are either too lazy or too busy to use their legs.”
Harry paused and, realising he couldn’t remember the last time he’d taken stairs if there was a lift available, decided to take that as a rhetorical question and hope Malfoy didn’t notice. “What do you mean old tunnels?”
Harry looked up and met Malfoy’s eyes, hoping his expression conveyed his appreciation because he wasn’t sure how to put it into words.
Harry took a moment to process that, wondering when Malfoy became so wise and aware. Was it a recent thing, something that happened after the war, or had he always been like this and Harry was just too blind and too consumed by his negative opinion of the boy he was to see it?
Harry couldn’t tell if that was Malfoy trying to make the conversation about himself and prove to Harry how important he was – that reporters wanted his attention almost as much as they wanted Harry’s – or if it was genuine understanding, comradeship and empathy that made his expression so soft. In all honesty, Harry didn’t know where the two of them stood after the war and felt like they were on unsteady ground. It had never been complicated in school with their mutual rivalry and distaste of everything about each other, and it was a fairly easy relationship despite it being full of torments and spite and prejudice on both their sides. But you didn’t go through a war at 17, watch numerous people die, and end up saving each other’s lives without changing and that uncomplicated relationship transforming into something tangled and uncertain. Harry didn’t think either of them knew how to act around each other or what to expect anymore.
“What is it?” Harry asked, hoping he didn’t sound too relieved and failing if the look Hermione shot him was any indication.
“Er, right. Well, we went there because we all wanted a night out, somewhere we wouldn’t be bothered, and nobody ever goes to The Hog’s Head because-”
Malfoy tugged his sleeve back down again and glared at Harry. “Unbelievable,” he muttered. Then he waved his hand dismissively. “Anyway, keeping you alive should be a breeze. How hard can it be? If the Dark Lord didn’t manage to off you after years of trying I doubt a bunch of hysterical teenagers will manage it.” Malfoy took a peek around the wall. “Hysterical teenagers and what looks like one 90-year-old woman. Is that Longbottom’s Grandmother?”
Malfoy looked up and there was a strength in his eyes, a depth and clarify in them that hadn’t been there previously, as he focused intensely on Harry.
Sometimes Harry thought the older wizarding families thought impoliteness was more important than sense. It made Harry want to laugh that the only thing stopping Malfoy discovering their little ploy and reporting them, definitely achieving his lifelong goal of getting him expelled, was his unwillingness to be impolite.
“Uh huh,” Malfoy said, clearly not believing him. “Do I need to have words with them? Do I need to curse them or spike their drinks with a Weasley product?”
“I would never!” Harry said. For one thing, they weren’t allowed to give out free booze due to a previous incident with a staff member giving away hundreds of pounds of product for free to girls he wanted to seduce. If that wasn’t the case he’d probably try it. “I’m simply letting you know you are a beautiful young woman. Frankly, I’m offended you’d think so low of me as to assume I’m manipulating you. I would never do that. And I-”
“Well, Harry didn’t need to say it! It was written all over his face that he wanted to fuck you over the bar.”
How did it feel to be a year older? The same as always and no different, as any person on the planet would say when asked. Is it more joyful now people are recovered from the war? No, because they hadn’t recovered and people they loved were fucking dead, gone for good. Was duelling in a controlled, monitored environment under the watchful eyes of experienced law enforcement personnel the same as being 17 years old fighting a homicidal, sadistic lunatic with an army and the intent of murdering you and taking over the world? Yes, of course it fucking was. How was his relationship? It was just dandy, and even if it wasn’t, every couple had obstacles they needed to overcome and oh, yeah, it was none of their damn business.
Cheers erupted as fireworks sounded outside and Big Ben rung on the TV. The two loudest cheers came from a group of drunk men sitting at the bar and a table of four towards the back of the pub.
He wondered if the Muggle world had been as magical for Malfoy as the Wizarding World had been for Harry.
Harry looked up automatically at his name to see Ron and Hermione gawping at him. They looked shocked, which was understandable as their best friend had just suddenly burst out into hysterical laughter without there seeming to be a trigger or reason for it. He wouldn’t blame them if they sent him to the spell damage ward for delayed war-related injuries.
Harry darted down the side street and turned to see if he’d been followed. There were no signs to suggest he had been, so with a smile and a spring in his step he started towards Malfoy’s potions shop. Malfoy’s little performance at the Ministry had done its job; everybody Harry had passed had been gossiping about that rather than Harry’s birthday. Normally when Harry arrived in the street he was swarmed in minutes, but today they’d been so caught up in guessing the identity of the mysterious prankster, retelling the events to their friends with increasing exaggeration, or even contemplating what other horrors could be expected from a clearly unhinged evil genius (that one had made Harry chuckle), they hadn’t even glanced at him. He’d managed to slip silently through the crowd and to the quiet side street without a fuss.
"Don't apologise. I can't get into it, but it's not your fault. You didn't know - no one does - so don't feel guilty."
“He doesn’t have to.” Granger frowns. “But if you want to, we’re all ears.” She adds, turning to face me.
He looks at me with thoughtful eyes, before reaching for something on the table. I don’t see what he grabs but a second later the plug in my ass begins to vibrate painfully slowly. I let out a yelp and one of my hands grabs his thigh.
I glance in my rear view mirror, seeing the blue lights have gone, and smile. I don’t lower my speed, but as I turn a corner I see the police car parked across the road, lights blaring, waiting for me. Both police officers have exited the car and are standing with shit eating grins on their faces. I panic, slamming on the breaks before I crash into them. I get out as one walks over.
Draco spotted James sitting on the bottom of the stairs, observing the two wizards having their argument.
Once Teddy was settled into his room, Draco had left and I had Luna organise an appointment with our tattooist for him. ‘Our’. He wasn’t a member of the gang, but he did everyone’s tats despite their age and we get him good deals on weed.
Harry pulled his coat around him, shivering as he trudged in through the snow as it surrounded him in flurries, lost on a street he only vaguely recognised. The car had broken down some way back and no recovery vehicle could get out in the snow. His only option was walking.
“Draco and I are fucking, I guess. Or will be, sometime. And Zabini and Neville are definitely fucking. Malfoy and Zabini are police officers, if you couldn’t tell.”
As he shoved inside of me, I had to stop myself from throwing up. Every inch of my being wanted to shed it's top layer as he grabbed me sharply.
"Oh, I'd forgotten..." Draco muttered. James went to sit on Draco's lap, peering at him in the gap between his torso and the clock, which he was holding still. He placed the clock down beside him, carefully watching James. "You're certainly more clever than I gave you credit for."
“Potter.” Blondie speaks, voice full of authority. The way he said my name… if only there were less people here… and fewer clothes. “Your friend is here to pick you up. I suggest you hurry for his sakes. Officer Zabini is struggling to keep it in his pants.” I’m let out of the cell, sending a wave to Seamus, before I’m lead to the front desk, where Longbottom is waiting for me. He’s leaning against the desk, a furious blush across his face as the officer who helped apprehend me earlier chatting him up, who I assume to be Zabini. The officer is about to lean down to whisper something in his ear when Neville spots me and hurries over.
When Draco woke the next morning, Harry was curled up into his side, an arm around his waist, already awake. Draco reached a hand over and ran it through Harry's hair as he had every morning for the past few months. Harry hummed contently, leaning into the hand out of instinct.
It didn't. He grabbed my chin forcefully, making me look at him as he pounded into me. He slammed in, pausing with a grunt, before slamming in once, twice more. I shook with horror as I felt him unload in me, too scared to cry or to scream.
After being called to dinner, Teddy spends most of it asking me about the Griffins. He tries on multiple occasions to get me to tell him about the crimes we commit, but I knew Andromeda would throw me out if I told him.
"Can I know who did it, at least?" I bit my lip. "It's fine if not." He added quickly at my silence.
“Just me and James here,” Draco sighed, smiling, giving the kitten a couple of scratches behind his ear. James mewed in return, jumping down to curl up in the man’s lap. “He turned up one night at the café, injured little stray he is. I’ve had him for a couple of weeks, finally got a collar on him on the way here.”
"You're an idiot," was all Draco mumbled in reply. He went to head further into his house, but stopped for a second, turning to to Harry. "I'll run you a bath, just leave your clothes by the door."
“Ok. I need you to try your best to remember everything from today. Put yourself back in the location, close your eyes if you want to or need to. Please try and answer every question to your best ability.” I nodded. “Tyler - Do you mind if I call you Tyler? - would you please tell me about the events before you were assaulted. Include as much detail as possible.”
"He's in a holding cell. Once they've processed his DNA, we'll hear back from the labs. If it's a match, they can get him into questioning. He'll probably take it to court, but we expect that." Blaise finally said once he pulled up outside my home.
A few hours later, Draco found himself entering the wizarding pub, the black kitten hot on his tail. He ordered a drink from the bar - just a butterbeer, nothing alcoholic - before searching for his old friend, seeing his sat in a booth near a window. He wandered over, letting James jump up onto the seat as his friend stood to greet him.
”Draco had to leave for work. Scorp’s offering a lift home.” I grabbed my clothes, scribbling a note to Draco under his neat calligraphy, before slipping my shoes on and heading to Scorp’s car outside. Teddy was sitting upfront with him, so I lay across the backseats.
He nodded, smiling. He liked that his employees felt they could come to him when they needed something. He liked that, unlike earlier in life, he was in a position to actually help people.
"Har? It's me, Ron. Mind if I come in?" I sniffled, before getting up from where I was to open the door.
”Please, daddy.” I beg, pushing my ass against him. I hear him chuckle and he pulls out slowly, before slamming back into me. He does it again a couple more times, and each time I make an inhumane noise in pleasure, before he sets about pounding into me with a fast yet even pace.
"It was just Cho from the Serpents. She wanted somewhere to stay for a couple weeks until everything calmed down. Said she feeling scared."
When I look to daddy, he’s no longer watching what’s on TV, instead he’s watching me wriggle about on the plug with a smirk on his face. His hand is still gripped on his cock, moving up and down the shaft slowly. I look at it wantonly, but he shakes his head at me.
”Excuse us for simply being worried that you haven’t been in a relationship for years.” Astoria throws an arm around my shoulder, leading me into the kitchen so Draco can chat with his mother. She plops herself down onto a stool and I stand opposite her. “So.” She begins, a small glint in her eye. “Have you two had sex yet?” She asks, no filter whatsoever. My eyes widen.
As Draco Malfoy of all people opened the door, Harry realised he would have been safer if he'd carried on walking home.
"Let me hear you, baby. Don't worry about everyone else. Let daddy hear your beautiful voice." He scolds.
"Maybe he would have been safer if you kept him locked up at home. Look, he's even already wearing a collar!" She nudged Draco with a small laugh. "Oops, I'd better shut up," she added as Harry stood up and made his way over.
I’m sitting at my desk, sorting out paperwork for Teddy, who would be moving into the neighbourhood soon. Andromeda had sent over his papers, signing me over as his legal guardian. Bitch.
"I mean, I've seen some stuff in my time. Never thought I'd meet a cat who understood English. Unless, of course, I'm going mad." He added thoughtfully. The kitten rubbed against his leg again. He looked down at it, thinking for a minute. "Meow if you understand me."
Millie didn’t stay for much longer, heading back to work in time for her shift, leaving Draco alone with the cat.
"Frankly, Potter, I've had a long day and am far too tired to begin to discuss this with you." He spoke, managing to keep his voice calm despite the circumstances. Draco pushed past Harry, laying down on his bed gracefully.
“Harry. No offence, cuz I know you’re into that kind of shit, but I ain’t one for giving or taking it up the ass. Unless it’s a woman. A female woman. I’m not gay!” His voice getting louder as I close the door to my room behind me. He wouldn’t have to worry for a while. The only way to contact Seamus was to go through the police station, aka Draco, and who knew when he would next arrive. Well, whenever I saw Draco next, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on what he was packing.
"What's wrong with you?" He asked, almost ready to scold himself for talking to an animal. He reached a hand to its back leg, jerking back when the kitten almost hissed at him, baring its teeth. "I don't want to hurt you. You're the one who knocked on my door, after all." As if understanding him, the cat moved forward again and Draco was able to see a deep cut on its leg, blood oozing out slightly.
"'Ave 'im!" Another shouted. A man close to the front started running to my with a small knife in his hand, but I dodged the blow before sending a sharp jab to his stomach, and then a right hook to his jaw, sending him out cold.
“Griffin?” He checks and I nod a reply. He chucks the bag on the floor by my feet, and I throw my identical one to him. He looks inside, counting the money. “Perfect.” He says before leaving and I head back to my car. I check the bag, seeing a couple bags of marijuana and a small, clear bag with a dozen or so small pills in. I open the boot, placing the bag in the empty spare wheel slot and cover it smoothly with the carpet before getting in and driving off.
"Sorry," I muttered, before leaving the room quickly. I heard worried voices, but ran up the stairs and dived into the nearest bathroom before the tears could fall from my eyes. I locked the door and let out a choked sob.
"Draco!" He whisper-yelled. Draco jumped, a small flash of magic coming from his fingers as he grew infinitely more fed-up with Harry.
want to fuck me. What devil did I ever do to deserve this?” He complains, dragging himself up off the floor. We head to the kitchen and begin dinner, Teddy sitting as far away from Scorp as he can. Draco asks me what happened, but he quickly notices the looks that’s the two boys are sending each other.
”House 3, your new home. You’ll be sharing with Ginny and Luna. They’re super sweet, so don’t worry.”
This has been sitting in my drafts for months, practically finished. I genuinely have no idea why this wasn’t out sooner. Also, it’s almost twice the length of my other chapters. Anyways, hope you enjoy xx
"Thank you daddy." I smiled at him when I was back in reality. He sat up and let his hands rest on my waist.
While he chopped and cooked, James simply sat at the end of the countertop, watching Draco eagerly. He hopped down when Draco served their meals, but was back up there to watch Draco as he cleaned up, which took a while as Draco refused to get a ‘dishwasher’ but didn’t feel safe using magic so often in a muggle area.
“You’re as bad as Pansy,” he rolled her eyes, leaning back against the counter now that they had finished the lunch rush. “He’s a cat, Melissa.”
The next day I woke to a call from Blaise, letting me know he was on the way to pick me up. I didn't bother showering or eating, but I threw on what I'd worn yesterday and waiting for him in the lounge.
"Now, I made cake and I know Melissa has presents for you." Millie smiled, kicking Draco out into the lounge.
Once the two were done with their coffees, Draco, after speaking to Jen who insisted it was ‘completely fine’, clocked out half an hour early and took Millie to see James.
Draco couldn't stop himself from reaching a hand up and tangling his fingers in Harry's hair. The man above him leaned into the touch, just as James would have, his green eyes fluttering closed for a second.
"What was that for?" Comes the sleep-ridden yet familiar voice of Harry, who stands in doorway, making his presence known.
Draco practically scooped James up, pressing a kiss to the top of James' head as the kitten let out a meow of surprise. He rolled onto his back, putting the kitten down on his stomach.
Draco didn't know when he started crying. Draco didn't really know he was able to. But his vision was going blurry and tears were making their way down his face faster than he could wipe them away.
“I won’t lie, the thought of seeing you pregnant if kind of hot, but we met yesterday so I doubt you want to go that far too quickly. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on knocking you up anytime soon.” I think for a minute, the silence unfortunately allowing us to hear another moan from upstairs.
“Dean. You alright?” I ask, heading into his room. He grunts, before rolling onto his back to face me.
"Hi," was all Draco could muster up once Harry pulled away. Partially because he was out of breath, and partially because his mind had been rendered useless.
He tripped up on something and realised, as he landed in the snow, that he couldn't feel his hands nor his feet, and he was losing faith in his arms and legs. He wasn't religious but he prayed for the safety of his extremities regardless.
SIDENOTE: I was about to go to update the His Name Is Seamus fic and I did a bad. I was deleting this draft from Wattpad (I write on Wattpad on my ipad, come at me) and either Wattpad broke or I did. So my draft for the final chapter of HNIS got deleted instead of the draft for this, so I’m going to have to rewrite it :) It WILL a be up as soon as possible though. Love you all x
”Yep. Finished her earlier. Just had to do some other checks for damages but she’s ready to go. Excuse me while I go let the owner know.” The kid nods, and mills about the garage while I head into the office to make a phone call. As I put down the phone, I hear someone else enter the garage.
"Please, daddy." This assures him, and he flips me over before he moves himself down my body, his head near my crotch. I'm surprised, however, when his tongue begins to press against my asshole rather than my clit, but nevertheless it has a moan tumbling out of my mouth and into the pillow I'm pressed against. He lifts my ass up slightly, before speaking again.
Harry opened his mouth to say something more, but the words failed him and he headed back to his seat in the corner. Draco turned to begin on the drink when he saw Melissa starting at him deadpan.
“Finally you’re home, da- Oh.” I stop midsentence when, instead of Draco, I see Scorp entering the house.
Draco slams the door shut with hit foot before throwing me on the bed. He wastes no time in attaching his lips to mine as he unbuttons my shirt. Despite his amazing kiss, I press a hand to his chest and gently push him back. He gives me a strange look and I hold up a finger to him, telling him I'll just be a minute, before I head into his en-suite showerroom. While in there, I brush my teeth - hopefully he won't mind sharing - and then undress, leaving me in the green thong. My heart was beating hard, threatening to burst out of my chest. I take a deep breath and open the door wide, letting Draco see me. When he does, his jaw drops and his eyes widen as he takes in the sight, and I feel my cheeks flush.
"You love the idea of me. You love the boy who lived, the boy who defeated Voldemort, who saved the Wizarding World. I'm not him, Ginny. I'm Harry. I'm clumsy, I'm forgetful. I get scared during thunderstorms and powercuts. I have days where I'm so mentally drained I can't leave the bed, I can't eat, can't get dressed. I'm not the perfect man you think I am. No matter how many times I try to tell you this, you ignore me. And I can't deal with it anymore."
I took pictures of both the inside and outside of each wrist, my hips, and my thighs. I got both sides of my neck as well. All the images I either had to hold or awkwardly tape a ruler to myself, just as Marcel had requested.
Draco explained his situation, with Melissa pausing him every few seconds to stroke the cat, who seemed to be loving the attention.
"Seriously, Draco," she hissed. "I don't know what he was like at school. But he made a lot of people realise you're just a normal person. And you're here, just being a very normal person. I'm not going to hold your past against you."
”The Narcissa Malfoy I know would have never gone to either of those.” Draco commented, sitting down opposite her and handing her a mug.
you like.” I read it aloud. “Wish I could.” I reply to no one. I head into the laundry room, only to see that my clothes are still drying, and with my panties laying torn in a corner of Draco’s room... bollocks.
“How is it that you guys are the most lawless people in this town and yet we can’t bring you in because we’ve no concrete evidence?” I shrug my shoulders.
He continued. "You were loud and boisterous and clumsy. Loyal to your friends, not just that fake shit I pretended to have with Crabbe and Goyle either. You were an idiot, still are really, but incredibly bright. Your lopsided grin and constantly messy hair were far cuter than they should have been. You have this dumb, loud laugh that I love to hear. Wished I could have been the cause of it.
”He came with me. Draco invited me over for dinner and Teddy came along to distract Scorp. I assume Scorp would have been very nosy otherwise.” I answer.
”You’re insatiable. I bet that now we’ve finally fucked you won’t want to get off me, will you baby?” He grins, leaning over me. He grinds his crotch down onto mine, makin me writhe at the the touch. I wrap my arms around his neck and pull him down to capture his lips in a searing kiss. He pulls back and my arms fall to my side as he moves down my body, pressing an open mouthed kiss to my cloth covered crotch. I let out a sigh in content at the barely there touch, and he removes the thong, throwing it somewhere I in the room. “You’re so wet for me, baby boy.” He growls, sliding a finger along my sex.
Draco scrolled through the channels until the cat meowed loudly at something. He glanced to the cat, before going back to where he was when it meowed. It chirped again as he did and he put the channel on, playing a program called 'Doctor Who'.
”You don’t need it for now. I’ll wash it. Take your nap, I can’t stand lying to my mother.” He winks, before leaving the room holding my clothes from last night. I collapse onto the bed, the smell of Draco on the hoodie carrying me into a deep sleep.
"Nothing, absolutely nothing..." he answered, something was clearly up. "But I'll send him a message. I know Scorp's free tomorrow too."
”You won’t be needing these. Not for a while.” I can hear the smirk in his voice, and I wait as he heads into the laundry room, shivering as the cool air hits my skin. “Go into the lounge and kneel by the sofa. I’ll be there in a second.” He orders, before heading upstairs. I walk into the lounge, almost scared I’ll see someone there, before kneeling next to the two seater sofa, hands on my thighs.
"He's in the line-up thinking he's filling in. Obviously, the other four men who'll also be there are actors." He briefed me as we drove there. "Most times we get each person to step forward and say something, so maybe think of something he said, but that could also be used in any other assault. Sorry, that's worded weirdly," he backtracked. "Don't let it be specific to you."
Draco reached down and grabbed the backs of my thighs, picking me up and carrying me to my bed, where he threw me not so gently. He stood for a second, looking down at me with lust-filled eyes as my breath was heavy on my lips and my crotch began to throb. He didn't waste a second pulling my shirt off me, and I kicked my shoes and socks off as best as I could. His lips met mine briefly as his fingers deftly slid my belt off my and unbuttoned my trousers, pulling them off swiftly. As he did, I worked on the buttons on his shirt, trying to carefully undo each and every one before he removed my hands and ripped the fabric apart, throwing it into a corner of my room. He took a second to study me in just my boxers, letting his hands run across my torso and brushing his thumbs against my nipples. I leant up and grabbed the waistband of his trousers, using it to pull him down onto me.
Scorpius has managed to get Teddy lying beneath him, and there’s only a few inches between their faces.
Blaise stayed with me until I was feeling better. I don't know how long it took. The ride back to my house, he was silent, as was I.
“I believe Harry called it “fraternising with the enemy’ earlier.” Malfoy smiles to me as I hand him a warm mug of coffee.
He replied, letting me know that Marcel wanted me to come in the next day for a line-up. He offered to pick me up in the morning, before I was set to go to the Weasley's. Supposedly it wouldn't take long. I just wanted to make sure there's be enough time when I got back to sort myself out. Seeing him again would only bring everything back - as if having it haunt my nightmares and almost every waking moment wasn't enough.
She smiled. “I understand. We don’t have to use your birth name for this case. Neither in court. I remember when my daughter was first going by her chosen name, and her birth name was still on her driving license and all her legal documents. It sucks, when you haven’t changed your name legally. But here we can use your preferred name and pronouns.”
Pleasure exploded through me and I moaned his name loud enough to shake the room, a comfortable warmth following quickly after as my body relaxed into Draco's hold.
"The fat bastard who looks like a pig fucked another pig but somehow ended up with a pig-human mutant baby?"
“Whole house could hear you.” I grimace. He blushes a bright red, burying his head into Blaise’s shoulder.
“Third time lucky, kid. Name. Your name. The words people use to get your attention.” He rolls his eyes. Something in me lifts.
"Really?" I asked, exasperated. "Because I haven't seen my boyfriend for days and I've been missing him to no end, and now I've heard he's been hurt and I want to be there to support him." I paused. "Because I wasn't there to protect you when you needed me most, and now I don't want to leave your side. I want you, Harry. Nothing has changed that, nothing ever will."
"What were you reading?" Draco asked as he finished drying his hair, climbing into bed beside the other man.
“King of the Griffin gang, caught fer speeding of all things? Pah!” I give him a look, wondering how he knows who I am. “Don’t be surprised. That scar on yer forehead gives it all away.”
The ravenhead was sitting on the edge of the bed looking concerned, his head in his hands. At the mention of his name, his head jerked up and he rushed over to Draco.
”F- for you, daddy.” I moan at the contact. He leans down, pressing kisses to the insides of my thighs, before taking my clit gently between his teeth. At the pressure, I squeeze my eyes shut, letting out a loud and sharp gasp. He lets go, instead taking it into his mouth and sucking on it, circling his tongue around it.
Draco shook his head. "Officer Goyle is riding with me today. Smart, but a twat all the same. I'm sure you remember." Mm. I certainly remembered the knobhead. "Some evidence has been found that suggests the arresting officer that's night was actually the murderer. We've no concrete evidence so far, but honestly no one is surprised. We can't prosecute until we get some stronger evidence, like camera footage, or if we get enough witness statements and she finally admits to it. But it's all moving in the right direction!" He smiled.
Harry nodded and mumbled something incoherent as Malfoy dashed around the counter and through a swing door camouflaged in the wall next to it. Harry started drawing patterns in the countertop as he waited for Malfoy to come back and he considered how to ask the one question that he’d been desperate to ask all morning.
The smile on Malfoy’s face made Harry’s heart soar and the promise of seeing that again, of having Malfoy’s permission to hang out with him and laugh with him and talk with him, made him more excited and happier than he had been for a while. He was looking forward to it.
“You weren’t fucking Professor Sprout in Greenhouse Three then?” Harry said light-heartedly. “I think I read that somewhere.”
He’d wanted that for his birthday too – to have a small gathering at the Burrow with all his closest friends, eating their fill of Molly’s cooking and playing games and talking about anything that wasn’t war related. Not only would he enjoy himself, but it would also be good for everyone else. Molly could get distracted with entertaining and forget for a moment she only had six children now, Arthur’s eyes wouldn’t look so haunted, George wouldn’t look like his soul had been sucked out, Percy wouldn’t be standing around awkwardly like he didn’t know what to do, Charlie wouldn’t look like he wanted to run for the hills, and Bill and Fleur wouldn’t hold each other so tightly, like they’d be ripped away from each other any second.
just that amazing,” Malfoy said. “So you followed me to the common room?” Harry nodded. “How did you get in? It’s not like you could just stroll in, you’d need the password.”
“Lots of built-up sexual tension by the sounds of it. How long did you say you’d known him Harry? Since you were eleven?”
They drifted into a comfortable silence and Harry took the time to look around at his surroundings. It was dark but not Borgin and Burke’s dark. It was an odd little place, full of potion ingredients and items that seemed normal but Harry had no doubt did something magical. It seemed like the sort of place a person would go too to look for something bizarre and specific.
Malfoy frowned at him. “I think I’d remember letting my sworn enemy and his ginger sidekick traipse into my sanctuary. Spells would fly.”
The smile dropped off Malfoy’s face and for one terrified moment Harry thought he’d gone too far and scared him off. Then he caught the flush to Malfoy’s cheeks and his wide eyes and realised perhaps scared was the opposite of what Malfoy was feeling.
“I know,” Harry grinned, “To be honest they mostly seemed to be trying to wheedle information out of me. Mostly about my sex life. If I was seeing anyone. If I was available. If I was into men or women.”
She nodded. “Draco told us about his school. Said they taught very unique topics rather than normal things. Is it true you studied ancient runes and never studied maths? Or is Draco playing some elaborate prank? Because if it’s true I’m pretty sure what your school did is illegal.”
He knew the culprit. It was Malfoy. It was always Malfoy that was to blame. He’d thrown Harry off his game and distracted him by spawning millions of questions in his head.
Harry blinked and was caught up in the rambling speech of what he thought was an auror, a man who would be training him soon, as he gushed about the honour of working with the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry tried to tug himself free from the man’s grip but failed, condemning himself to listening to the unwanted flattery as the other option was offending a future colleague.
“You know the fit leggy blonde you served when Harry was having a meltdown in the back? Sitting at table 9? He’s with the girl in the hot pink dress, you can’t really miss him?”
By his calculations, Malfoy was the next member of their group to buy the round. Harry wouldn’t have to wait too long until the man was in front of him and he didn’t know whether he was dreading it or was worryingly excited.
“I could see you crouching here like a garden gnome avoiding a kneazle from across the street, so thought I’d bring you a drink so you at least weren’t a thirsty garden gnome.”
“Harry! How would you say this year compares to last year’s celebrations? Are they more joyful now people have recovered from the war?”
Malfoy sauntered back into the room a few minutes later, brushing his arm against Harry as he passed and causing Harry to shiver.
Harry broke first as someone started clicking their fingers in his face and snapped him back to reality.
Harry should’ve known better. There must’ve been a reason he fit in with the group and it turned out he was the biggest pervert of them all.
And there was no doubt it was Malfoy. That hair colour only belonged to one family and Harry would recognise those delicate features and slim figure anywhere. He’d spent the entirety of his teenaged years with the menace, insults spewing from that pretty mouth and the gorgeous blonde locks messed up from fights or Quidditch matches. He looked a little different, his hair swept artfully to the side instead of slicked back like it had been back then, making him look more relaxed, and instead of long black robes, Malfoy was wearing tight-fitting ripped jeans and a shirt the clung to his chest to proudly display his muscles.
The honesty rang true in his voice, the depth of his tone and the seriousness in his eyes making it very hard for Harry to think Malfoy was lying.
Seb looked him dead in the eye. “Would you regret it if you didn’t talk to him? Is the stuff you just listed worth wondering if you’d missed out on something great for the rest of your life?”
their enemy anymore, had barely been one before, and Malfoy matched his criteria of someone he knew not currently engaged. Plus, he was hardly boring. He'd been quiet since the war, sure, but Harry doubted Malfoy knew how to be dull. He
Malfoy was silent for a few moments, taking all the information in and processing it. His expression was open and to his relief Harry saw no pity or disgust, simply curiosity and perhaps a hint of understanding. If Harry remembered correctly, Malfoy’s family were hounded almost as much as he was after the war, never being left alone. Harry supposed if anyone could understand the freedom the muggle world brought it would be Malfoy.
They studied each other in silence for a moment before Harry summoned the Gryffindor courage he was renowned for – and that had deserted him earlier – to break it.
He stared. He knew he was staring but he couldn’t quite understand what he was seeing. It was such a strange image and one that his mind couldn’t have conjured up alone, he wasn’t imaginative enough. There was one prominent question screaming at him though:
This was easier than Harry thought it would be though. He hadn’t seen Malfoy in a year, or at least Malfoy hadn’t seen him. Harry had glimpsed him a few times in Diagon Alley and once at a Quidditch game – the first one after the war – but Malfoy had never acknowledged him, and Harry didn’t have a good enough reason to approach him. Curiosity didn’t count, not after the shit they’d done to each other. He’d never
“From the old Ministry,” Malfoy answered. Seeing Harry’s confused look, Malfoy sighed and explained further. “The current Ministry structure is built on top of one that was used back when the wizarding population was smaller and there were less employees. They never demolished the old one, just buried it, so all the old offices and corridors are down there and you can access them from the original entrance. You ever been to the lowest floor and seen that weird statue of Bonkorvitch the Troll Hunter?” Harry nodded. He’d been down there once or twice and always thought the statue was oddly placed and random; it was the official government headquarters and home to the officials who ran the wizarding world, the statue should be of someone high-status or legendary, not some guy who killed three trolls before being torn apart. “Well, that’s the main access tunnel. The Ministry covered it up because they don’t want people just wandering around down there unsupervised, but my father had the original plans. Honestly, with the amount of time Granger spent harping on about
She was silent for the most part, the only sound coming from her was her nails drumming on the bar top. Harry wondered if he’d get away with simply handing over her drinks without her uttering a word to him.
Rumbustious, joyful laughter was bouncing off the old walls and a constant stream of chatter accompanied it. Music was playing in the background and the TV broadcasting the lead-up to the celebrations was on, but it was useless as it was completely drowned out by the noise. Waitresses were manoeuvring themselves through the heaving crowd with a skill that was almost supernatural, determined expressions on their faces and a death glare for anyone who got in their way. Bodies were pressed closely together, some people flirting with each other, some couples getting frisky, some people smushing together in the booths to fit more people in, and others pressing together simply because there was just no room. The poor bartenders – including Harry – were running up and down the bar trying to fulfil the non-stop orders as quickly as possible, responding to the yells and calls of the patrons and getting drinks out in record time. The giant clock projected onto the wall of the pub read two and a half hours until midnight. Harry noticed that with every passing hour the patrons became more and more excitable and increasingly drunk.
Malfoy seemed to find what he was looking for as he suddenly cocked his head to the side and his lips quirked up in a playful smirk. There was a challenge dancing in those grey eyes now, beckoning Harry to come closer and daring him to play with him.
Terry elbowed him gently in the side and when Harry glanced in his direction, he gave Harry an encouraging smile. Seb tilted his head in Malfoy’s direction, clearly indicating wordlessly that Harry should go over to him, Jason was smiling goofily and switching his attention between Malfoy and Harry, and Gerald…well, Gerald was sticking out his tongue and making crude gestures where Malfoy couldn’t see them.
“Well, I’ll leave that for you to find out for yourself. Of course,” he continued, “Draco’s also painfully shy and insecure about his body, even though he really doesn’t need to be. The blush that appeared when he was bare spread all over his face and down his chest making him look somehow adorable and sexy at the same time. He needs someone strong and confident to take control in bed and reassure him I think.” He paused and looked Harry over, “You should take him into the loos right now and do that. You look like someone who’d be perfect for him.”
Malfoy’s face lit up with a triumphant grin and Harry’s breath rushed out of him all at once. If he hadn’t been sure before, he was now; he wanted to see that expression on Malfoy’s face again and he wanted it directed at him.
“We were using Polyjuice potion to look like Crabbe and Goyle,” Harry explained. He briefly wondered if he should be revealing what they’d done back then to Malfoy; it was a long time ago and nobody would care that The Saviour had brewed a restricted potion when he was twelve, in fact they’d probably be impressed by it. However, there were some who would demand he be punished, that he couldn’t get away with something just because he was famous, or they would use it to assassinate his character. Plus, Malfoy might be offended by it and stop talking to him, and Harry didn’t want that. He didn’t think Malfoy would though, the curiosity in his eyes confirming that. Malfoy had always been as interested in Harry as Harry was with him. He sighed and shrugged sheepishly. “We jumped them on the way back from dinner, stuck them in a broom cupboard, then wandered the dungeons until you found us. We must’ve looked like idiots, stumbling around like lost lambs, Ron arguing with his older brother dressed like Crabbe and me forgetting to take my glasses off.”
Potter? I always thought Granger did that for you.” He waved his hand dismissively. “Let them follow, I have nothing to hide and neither does my mother. My life is dull and they’ll realise that soon enough. If they’re looking for gossip or scandal or a sordid affair between me and Professor Flitwick, they will be sorely disappointed.” He paused, then muttered so quietly Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hear. “But if they don’t learn quick enough, I’ll have to take morally questionable actions to speed it along, and make them suffer. Like those bastards who upset my mother.”
“Right,” Seb said, “It’s just we’ve been trying to ask you a question for the last few minutes and you looked like you were on another planet.”
Harry’s head snapped around to find ten young women rushing towards him and realised too late that he’d given away his position.
Harry blinked at her for a moment in confusion. Why was that a question? Didn’t everyone know Hogwarts? It was the only wizard school in the country, where else would he be referring to? And why was she talking about it in such an odd way? He guessed that was what Hogwarts was in very generic terms but that was overly cryptic for no reason. Sure, there were muggles around and wizards always needed to be careful with what they said around them, but not
He decided to change the tone of the conversation to distract himself from such thoughts. Harry coughed and crossed his arms, trying to keep his voice light and expression disapproving despite being anything but. “You know doing this sort of stuff isn’t going to get the reporters to leave you alone. Isn’t that what you wanted? For them to think you’re boring so they don’t write about you? Pretty sure creating mass hysteria and chaos isn’t the way to go about getting that. They’ll never leave you alone if they find out.”
“Oh, everything’s fine sir. I was just chatting with Harry and surprised him I think. It wasn’t his fault at all.”
“How do you know that?” Malfoy said distrustfully, leaning towards Harry again. “When did you see us together?”
Harry could hear his stupid laugh all the way across the room and whenever he looked over at the table Malfoy’s face was always lit up in happiness or his hands were waving animatedly as he told a story. He didn’t look like the same stuck-up, stiff bully he’d been. He’d nod along, listening intently when someone was talking to him and at one point Harry saw him throw an arm around the shoulders of one of the guys and pull him into a hug. Harry pushed down the irrational jealousy that reared its head. There was no reason for it. Him and Malfoy weren’t friends or anything; did he really feel possessive over the twat just because he’d been such a huge part of Harry’s life?
“Uh huh. Well, we should get to know each other, Harry. We need to if you’re gonna be screwing my best friend. Feel free to join us at any point tonight.”
“This isn’t funny!” Hermione said. “This is people’s livelihoods! People depend on their jobs to feed their families and for some people losing one day of work is the equivalent of losing a meal for the day, the only thing standing between them and destitution. And the wizarding world relies on the Ministry to function. Without the auror department active, crime will increase and criminals might get away if it’s true the courts are off limits.”
Malfoy gave him a disbelieving look that showed just how stupid he thought that question was. “Potter. The whole of Wizarding Britain knows it’s your birthday.
“Oh, all sorts of things,” Gerald said, batting away his friends attempts to stop him, “That you were too shy to proclaim your undying love for Harry. That you wanted to ask Harry out and he was just your type. That you spoke about him all the time and thought he was hot. That you looked really good underneath your clothes.”
“No, Ginny couldn’t make it because of work,” Harry said, sadly. He was pleased for Ginny, really he was, because she was doing what she loved with people she idolised. She deserved all the happiness and joy in the world after the horrors she faced during the war, but a part of him was bitter that he never saw her now. Their schedules conflicted and her training schedule was so intense she often didn’t arrive home until late or chose to stay with her teammates because she was too tired to travel. When they were together it was great; they still had the same passion they did in school, but it had matured, and the two of them were now simmering in a more steady and reserved love. They were no longer kissing like it was the last time or ripping each other’s clothes off whenever and wherever they could, they’d progressed into the next stage of simply enjoying being with each other, where they could do nothing together and be perfectly happy. At least, that’s what Hermione told him when he’d confessed he feared they were losing their spark. She wasn’t wrong, Harry did enjoy his quiet time with Ginny but those moments were increasingly rare, and he found himself wanting to get up and do things instead when Ginny was perfectly content to sit in his arms and listen to the wireless.
“You got to ask your questions,” Malfoy said, and Harry envied how his voice only shook a bit. “Now I get to ask mine. You’re not escaping that easy.”
It had been a fairly regular thing when they were younger, but Malfoy had really stepped up his game this time. He hadn’t spoken a single word to Harry and Harry still wanted to punch him for the turmoil he was causing in him.
Harry turned sharply back to Malfoy and found him looking at Harry with amusement and clearly trying not to laugh. Harry wanted to slam his head onto the bar again so nobody could see his face. “It was practically his hobby in school.”
The guy in the new group had taken his hat off – a hat that, now Harry was looking closely, was a suspicious silver and green colour.
“Been lusting at him from afar all night,” Gerald piped up, ignoring Harry’s interruption, “but hasn’t been able to talk to him yet because when he came up to the bar you served him.”
“After I told her what I said, Felicity demanded I come over and apologise for being ‘a total dickhead who may have scarpered Draco’s chances of getting laid tonight’ and if I didn’t she’d ‘hang me by my balls from the ceiling fan and poke me in the eye with my own cock.’”
Slowly, the puzzle pieces slotted together in Harry’s brain; not mentioning Hogwarts by name, referring to it in such a vague way, questioning its existence, and not knowing it taught only magical subjects. Now he was thinking about it, none of the group had reacted to him being Harry Potter either. They didn’t fight to come up to the bar to be the one to speak with him, none of them flung themselves at him or gushed over him or talked with him longer than necessary which wizards usually did with Harry. He’d not thought it was strange until now and had assumed they were treating him like that because they were friends with Malfoy, but they hadn’t sneered at him or given any indication they’d recognised him at all. He was just a random bartender they never intended to see again.
Before Harry could ask him to clarify what he was talking about, Malfoy smirked and gave him a two-fingered salute. “See you around, Scar-head.”
year had flung his arm around his shoulder, and the chaser for the Holyhead Harpies was practically hanging off his arm, whispering what she obviously thought were enticing and flirty comments into his ear but which sounded filthy and revolting to Harry. There were numerous hands clapping him on the back or thumping his shoulder or punching his arm playfully and many nameless faces talking at him about the same dull topics with the same plain words, so much so that he’d zoned out and let them all flow into one several times.
He nodded, “Take your thirty-minute break now. Calm down, get your head on straight, have a drink and a snack, then come back out and be your usual kick-ass self. Okay?”
“Well, he first mentioned you when we were talking about secondary schools. Told us all about the snakes vs the lions and how there was this one boy he really didn’t get along with. Verbal insults, physical fights that got really bad, putting each other in the hospital wing, trickery, manipulation-”
“If she’d simply said no I could’ve handled it,” Harry admitted before grimacing, “Well, no, I probably couldn’t have. It was the look on her face, the horror and embarrassment. Apparently, she was planning on talking to me about seeing other people and ending our relationship that weekend. She told me she’d been deliberately avoiding me for over a month hoping I would get the picture and bring it up myself, so whilst I thought she was busy with work and tried to arrange my day so I could spend time with her, she was partying and making plans so our schedules clashed and finding any excuse she could to not see me. She didn’t want to be with me anymore, she didn’t think we had enough in common, and she said she was disappointed with our relationship. That she felt like we were moving too fast and I was pressuring her to settle down when she wasn’t ready to and wanted to focus on her career. I think her image of me and the reality of me didn’t match up. I was heartbroken.” Harry shrugged, “So I ran.”
Harry could admit to himself that he was fishing for information. He wanted to know who Malfoy lived with, if he lived alone, if Harry could perhaps go round to see him or would he get laughed at or jumped by persistent and over-involved flatmates.
Harry’s heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest. He passed that window every Saturday when he went to pick up his dinner from that takeaway. Malfoy had been close the entire time and he hadn’t even realised it.
He was ‘a beacon of hope and triumph’, as Hermione had put it, and thus people would want to be around him and express their gratitude, and likely always would. To them, every time they looked at him they saw peace and remembered what the world was like before and, more importantly, what it
“Oh, it wasn’t that hard really,” Malfoy waved a hand lazily. “I just went through the old tunnels nobody uses anymore to avoid any witnesses in the lobby and the Welcome Witch. Not just because she’d record my presence, she has a crush on me so would definitely remember me being there. I cast a powerful disillusionment charm on myself so nobody would see me sneaking around, disabled the monitoring charms – which are really rather simple to crack, someone should raise that with the DMLE - and used the stairs to get around.”
“It’d take more than that to damage my huge ego, Potter.” Malfoy said it in a way that almost sounded like an innuendo, but Harry couldn’t for the life of him work out what it was.
The sudden pop of a cork flying out a champagne bottle and the raucous cheers of what appeared to be half the ministry drowned out his long-suffering sigh. Some stranger who Harry vaguely recognised as a member of the wizengamot who had been at his trial in 5
After a moment of thinking it through and realising that Malfoy had a very good point, Harry nodded slowly. “Yes, I…I agree with you, I think.”
Malfoy seemed to sense Harry’s change in mood and stepped closer to him, clapping him on the shoulder with one hand and looking seriously into his eyes. “That’s alright.
Malfoy was leaning casually against one of the clogged up floos that had feathers spilling out of it, watching the chaos in front of him with his arms crossed and an obvious smirk plastered across his face.
Malfoy frowned, “Honestly, I’m surprised you came here rather than make the most of it. I thought you’d be out drinking yourself into a coma or more likely getting food poisoning at the Hog’s Head with your entourage whilst you could, rather than sitting in this little shop with me.”
Malfoy kept eye contact, looking at Harry seriously and speaking slowly, as if he wanted Harry to listen to what he was saying and believe him. “I said I’d protect you. I meant it.”
“What a loaded question,” Malfoy muttered under his breath. Harry wasn’t certain whether he was supposed to hear it or not. Malfoy cleared his throat. “Same as last time, please. I think we’ve reached the point where we’re all a bit too tipsy to be creative.”
He’d always chickened out though, knowing he had no excuse to go there and that only going to see Malfoy was creepy.
Harry was quiet for a moment as he considered that. As much as he hated to admit it, he appreciated Malfoy’s outlook. He wasn’t acting like the vast majority of the wizarding world and ignoring Harry’s friends and others’ sacrifices and triumphs nor was he downplaying their involvement either. He was saying that all those people did just as much as Harry in their own way to win the war. That included Malfoy, though Harry doubted Malfoy would consider himself to be one of those people. Perhaps he was right that Harry should start accepting the recognition and deserved some peace, rather than him shooting down everyone who even implied he was special.
“Malfoy, um, yeah, sorry about that.” Harry shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Reporters.”
“Is that because it’d be a busman’s holiday, your work colleagues would never shut up about it, you don’t think a pub is a great first date location, or you’re too socially inept to get a partner?”
It sounded to Harry like Malfoy expected to see him again. More than that, it sounded like Malfoy expected him to be around his friends, perhaps in his flat, but he might have been reading too much into it.
Harry darted down a small side street, so narrow the reporters got stuck at the entrance as they all tried to force their way through first to get to him. He sprinted down the street to lose them, and when he heard the first yell of triumph from behind practically threw himself into the nearest shop.
be missing the lady-love!” Jason, a young banker who Harry knew had work tomorrow said. He flittered his eyes in Harry’s direction, “Or man-love. Whatever floats your boat.”
Harry chuckled and went about concocting the order and as he was pouring, he watched Malfoy out of the corner of his eye.
Malfoy choked and that was all the vindication Harry needed. He gave Malfoy a smug look and folded his arms.
“Or,” Malfoy said, and his voice wasn’t soft anymore. He sounded like he was choking back emotions, his voice rising in volume with his frustrations and determination to prove his point and, Harry quickly realised, the surge of painful memories. “That every single Slytherin from our year and the year below turned up to Vince’s funeral, even after he treated everyone like shit that last year? That, when Theo was left orphaned after his father was killed in the battle and his mother fled to the continent without him, Blaise took him to his house to live with him and his mother, who practically adopted Theo as a second son? That my mother spent
“Potter! You’re a bad man!” Malfoy exclaimed, though his wide grin and the laughter in his voice belied that fact.
“And you’re sitting talking one-on-one with Draco Malfoy in a dusty old shop without exchanging insults,” Malfoy said calmly. “I don’t think any of us saw that coming.”
Malfoy shook his head as if to clear the fog and to Harry’s disappointment leaned away from him. Reluctantly, Harry followed his lead and took a step away and knew his expression would be one of dejection. Malfoy would hop off the bar stool, turn on his heel and stroll out of Harry’s life like this had never happened. It made him oddly sad thinking of his life being Malfoy-less again. He hadn’t thought of him often over the years, but after meeting him here tonight and spending time with him he realised part of him had missed the Slytherin. It sounded cliché, but Harry hadn’t noticed that there was a part of him missing until Malfoy sauntered in and slotted himself into the gap. Whilst Harry’s life was thankfully calmer and more comfortable than his teenage years, he had become stuck in a rut doing the same thing every day with the same people and that wasn’t who he was; he was someone who needed some excitement, some danger, something to get his blood pumping and Malfoy had always been that for him. He thought it spoke volumes that whilst Harry’s life was full of people who loved him, he’d still volunteered to work New Year’s Eve rather than spend it with anyone special.
Harry stuck his head in the room and saw Auror Cassidy’s head floating there, searching for someone to talk too.
Harry coughed, “Er, no, I’m just…,” he laughed and decided to be honest, “I hate to say it, Malfoy, but I’m kind of impressed.”
Harry shuffled closer to him so they were directly opposite each other and distantly heard Terry call over one of the waitresses to take his place serving. Harry picked up a glass from under the bar and started wiping it over to give the illusion he was doing work just in case Roger came over.
to come here. His first thought on having a free day wasn’t to go out drinking with Ron and Hermione, it was that he
fantasies about Malfoy before. However, it wasn’t just physical attraction. If it was Harry wouldn’t be thinking too deeply about it. He was curious about Malfoy. He had always suspected that maybe Malfoy of all people understood him better than anyone else; they'd both had similar experiences in the war despite being on different sides and seen up close just what Voldemort was capable of. Even though his friends had suffered, they didn’t understand the obligation of having to fight and had volunteered. Malfoy certainly had not. Plus, Malfoy had never once treated Harry like he was Merlin’s gift to Wizardkind like the majority of the population which Harry needed.
Harry grinned and waited until the door slammed shut, cameras flashing and Malfoy’s voice calling everyone to silence, before he snuck out the back.
“Yeah!” Gerald blurted out loudly, “We were like ‘Earth to Harry. Come in Harry. How’s Jupiter, Harry?’” He giggled and nearly fell off his chair.
What Harry really meant was ‘what was Malfoy, a wizard, doing searching for a muggle supermarket’ but he couldn’t exactly ask Bruce that, so instead he just gave an embarrassed shrug and handed Bruce his Vodkas.
Gerald was nodding, “Yeah, he’s been trying to coax them into revealing information about you all night. Borderline stalking you if you ask me.”
“One day is all that matters. The backlog this is going to cause in the departments will be horrendous.” Ron didn’t seem to be taking it as seriously as Hermione wanted so she glared at him and her tone became sickly sweet, the one she usually reserved for when Ron was being stupid and an indication he was in serious trouble. “For instance, let’s say the employees of the Department of Magical Games and Sports can’t work for all of today and tomorrow. Isn’t there a game on Saturday between some big teams? That probably won’t go ahead now.”
“Nope. Just me and Pepper. My owl,” Harry clarified at Malfoy’s inquiring look. “You? Do you all live together?”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he said, meaning it and not just because for July the night was unusually cold. Malfoy had
But it was easy to slip into this role with Malfoy, the one where they parried back and forth, trading sarcastic comments and insults that had no heat to them anymore and did no damage. It was comfortable, like stripping out your work robes at the end of the day into your pyjamas and snuggling in an armchair with some hot chocolate and a blanket: familiar, simple, calming, and fun.
That shut them up. They all averted their eyes and Jason loudly started discussing the benefits of his favourite hobby: flower pressing.
Ron nodded in agreement. “At least they aren’t focusing on your birthday this year, Harry. They’ve got bigger things to worry about. Maybe we can actually go out tonight and have a peaceful year.”
“I was a complete jackass; rude, invasive, inappropriate, maybe a bit too descriptive, I can go on if you want?”
For what felt like the millionth time that day, Harry wasn’t sure what to say. It went deeper than Malfoy wanting to be the only one who could break Harry, despite his last sentence making it sound that way. What Malfoy had described, it was eerily close to what Harry himself felt: this strange, undeniable but completely irrational attraction to Malfoy, a connection that was different to all his other relationships and that he couldn’t quite define. Possessive, yes, obsessive, yes, and the thought of anyone hurting Malfoy definitely made Harry feel uneasy. There was also a sort of…dare he say,
"He's a Gryffindor, Draco," Blaise chuckled. Neville sent his boyfriend a death glare, although it didn't seem so effective.
Draco examined the inside, seeing it was lined with a glossy, deep green silk, with the edges lined in a silver thread.
“We’ve only just met and you’re tying me up? Officer, I’m flattered.” I flirt, feeling his crotch lightly press against my ass.
Harry was a little less graceful in the way he climbed onto the bed, coming to kneel over Draco, their faces just inches from each other.
“Mhmm. But it’s just a suggestion, right? I’m much better at following orders.” I press back against him and I can sense the gasp he holds back. He ignores what I say and looks to his coworker.
”No cool house names?” He asks. I shake my head and he frowns. “How about... Hufflepuff?” Draco lets out a small laugh, as do I.
I woke to the sun high in the sky, signaling that I had been in bed for half the day. I sighed in frustration, pushing the covers back and swinging my legs over the side of the bed.
”Be kind on him, Cissy. He’s doing well for himself. I’m glad Scorpius lives with you.” Astoria smiles to him. “Speaking of, where is our son?” She looks to where I am, and tilts her head slightly in confusion. “Not to sound rude, but you aren’t Scorpius.”
TRIGGER WARNING: rape, sexual assault. Please, please do not read if this affects you. I’ll get the next chapter up as soon as I can so you can skip this!
"That's right. My perfect little virgin princess. All ready for me to pound into her tight little cunt. This is why Draco takes you from behind, isn't it? So I could have your cunt all to myself. You're so thoughtful." I looked up. Perhaps it would make the ordeal less awful.
Once out, we dress quickly and get downstairs in enough time to see a car pull up. I grab one of the spare keys for house 3, where Teddy would be moving in, and go out to greet my Godson. I see him climb out the car and grab a bag and a medium size suitcase. As soon as the door closes, the car speeds off up the street. I watch his body posture sag at the action, and then visibly brighten when he sees us. I walk over to the blue-haired boy and pull him into a hug.
He wishes me goodnight before leaving me aloneness in the room. I clamber into the bed and try my best to get comfy, but to no avail as the plug keeps vibrating ever so slowly in my ass. Try as I might to get pleasure from it, the plug only serves to tease me relentlessly. I let out a loud groan in frustration as I wiggle about madly. I eventually give up, and hug a pillow to my chest a smirk I try to sleep, letting the scent from daddy’s hoodie calm me.
Draco planted his hands on the bar and lifted himself up off the barstool and forwards a little. Harry’s breath caught in his throat and he didn’t dare look away as Draco leaned in close to him and gently pecked Harry on the lips.
She was a little worse off than when he’d seen her last. By this point she’d had quite a few potent cocktails.
Which added a huge, impossible question to Harry’s list: why was Draco Malfoy, a pureblood wizard from one of the oldest wizarding lines in the world, hanging out in a muggle pub on New Year’s Eve with muggle friends?
She didn’t even introduce herself, but along with her short, sequined pink dress and hot pink heels she was wearing a necklace that spelled out her name. There was nothing intrusive about this question and it seemed innocent enough so Harry answered
“It’s lambs-” Malfoy gave him a grin that was all teeth and Harry realised that this time Malfoy hadn’t mixed up his idioms; he knew exactly what he was saying. “Never mind.”
Malfoy was sitting behind the counter, his eyes glued to a dusty old yellow book. At the jingle of the bell, he glanced up and, to Harry’s absolute shock, smiled softly at Harry.
in a dark room. Harry almost laughed; of course he was drawn to Malfoy, even in a crowded room he managed to grab Harry’s attention. It shouldn’t have been surprising, after seven years of always being aware of where he was and what he was doing, seeking him out – if only for a fight or to confirm his suspicions -, and committing his appearance, facial expressions, and voice to memory for survival purposes, Harry had developed a sixth sense for the man and practically had a Malfoy radar. He’d always watched Malfoy.
Malfoy laughed and the underlying worry Harry had that he’d be scared off by his story dissipated. “Not anymore,” he answered, quickly continuing before Harry could ask about that, “You’ve been working here all this time? Living nearby?” Harry nodded and Malfoy shook his head in disbelief, “It’s funny, we only live around the corner and I’ve never seen you here before.”
“You can go out the back door. I’ll distract them,” Malfoy said, turning towards the door and eyeing it with consideration. Harry could practically see the ideas and schemes flickering through Malfoy’s brain and the excitable gleam in his eyes promised trouble for those on the other side of the door.
“Oh.” Harry hadn’t expected that. The Malfoy of the past would rather Crucio himself than admit he was in the wrong.
“Yeah, I know. But I would’ve come over to apologise with or without the threat. I know I screwed up and freaked you out, and I’m sorry.”
Harry felt a shiver run up his spine. It was so reminiscent of their schooldays but instead of an insult being spat out, there was a fondness there – no, more than fondness. There was an undertone to his words that spoke of something
Harry blinked in surprise. He’d known some of Malfoy’s housemates had known, they had too as it was a scheme that required more than just Malfoy to pull off, but not that all of them had.
“It’s alright, I didn’t poison it,” Malfoy said. “I wouldn’t be so obvious. Poison in food and drink is easily detectable. If I wanted to kill you, I’d ambush you when you were chasing a suspect – hopefully through a crowd to avoid recognition – and hit you with an untraceable dark curse. Much quicker. You are wise to be wary though.”
“Yup. Say what you want about her but she can strike fear into even the most heartless journalist with her arsenal of curses and knowledge.”
Malfoy was quiet for a moment. “Even if I didn’t owe you for saving my life and keeping me and my mother out of Azkaban, I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing to you. I made a promise to myself after the war that if I saw injustice then I would speak up, so the same thing didn’t happen again, and you should be allowed some peace and quiet after the crap you’ve been through.” Before Harry could interject and say Malfoy didn’t owe him anything, Malfoy was continuing. “Besides, I suppose I feel…close to you? Like you said, at school we interacted with each other the most out of classes. You were a daily annoyance in my life, always there, and I was always aware of you. I guess spending so much time around you, knowing you, it made me a little…possessive. Seeing other people upset you makes me uncomfortable.” He took a slow breath. “You’re
“Not when you want to lick chocolate sauce off the naked body of said girl’s very pretty male friend.” She scrutinised him for a moment before she smirked and raised a finger at him accusingly, “Ah. You want to know about Draco. You want to dig up all the nasty little secrets I know about him, any information you can by plying me with free booze. You want me to betray my friends trust.”
Malfoy’s friends had all started eyeing him curiously when they came up to the bar too and now seemed to be targeting him. When they came to get their drinks, they would all head straight for him even if he wasn’t free and asked him the sort of questions that made Harry feel as if he was being interrogated. He guessed Felicity had told them about their conversation and they’d all made it their mission to get some serious info on him and Malfoy’s relationship.
“I have a lot of questions,” Malfoy said, pulling his pint towards him and making it clear he wasn’t going anywhere.
Just as Harry was stepping forward to approach Malfoy, someone jerked Harry’s arm, yanking his attention away from the blonde and forcing him to focus on them.
Harry shook his head violently but Malfoy ignored him, just glanced at him with an emotion Harry couldn’t identify dancing in his eyes.
“What?” Hermione said, snatching the paper out of Ron’s hands and skimming the page. Ron gave a mumbled protest before diving back into his scrambled eggs. Harry saw him grimace but soldier on, used to Hermione’s culinary skills by now. “This is awful! How are we supposed to get to work! We’re going to be late.”
at school, I thought she would’ve told you about the history of the Ministry when you started working there.”
Malfoy smiled at him, and again it was one of those soft smiles that made Harry feel warm. He wasn’t sure he’d managed to fool Malfoy that his visit was nothing extraordinary, but Malfoy didn’t push it.
If someone had told Harry he’d be sitting drinking butterbeer and discussing Quidditch with Draco Malfoy on his birthday casually and easily without incident even this time last year, he never would’ve believed them. It was not how he’d expected to spend his birthday, but he had to admit it was one of his better ones.
Malfoy held out a paper cup to him and Harry took it sceptically, feeling the heat warm his hands and smelling the unmistakable scent of chocolate. It was like Malfoy had read his mind.
Malfoy’s voice went quiet and the tone was that of someone admitting a secret. Harry subconsciously leaned closer. “Besides, I don’t want to get by on my family name and reputation anymore, not that there’s much left of it. This way I’m earning what I have for myself.” He smiled and Harry stared at the honest expression there. “It’s a wonderful feeling.”
Harry was so desperate he seriously considered it. Ron would be screaming at him that it was another dastardly trap and how a leopard couldn’t change its spots, and Hermione might possibly be hurt that he’d go to a once-enemy rather than his friends. But it was just that: Malfoy
Harry smiled before going into a small lecture about the unlikelihood of a sixteenth-century English monarch knowing a Victorian serial killer.
Harry startled a little and discovered he’d been hogging the cherry garnishes for the last few minutes. Silently, he handed them over to the other bartender.
if you were found out, your reputation would be in tatters and you’d lose connections and respect and friendships. And why make all this effort for someone you barely see, let alone talk to? This must’ve taken
“And,” Malfoy continued. “The moment Umbridge gave one of her ‘special detentions’ to a Slytherin – a Second Year who she’d caught snogging her boyfriend in Myrtle’s Bathroom -, we started spiking her drink with whatever Weasley products we could find, hit her with more
His head shot up when he made the conclusion and he immediately sought out Malfoy. For the first time that night, Malfoy was looking straight at him, his body turned towards Harry’s across the room, and as their eyes met he slowly shook his head. Harry got the message.
The most obvious difference was that the lips he was so used to seeing curled up in a sneer were parted and the corners curled up as he laughed at whatever the people with him were saying. Harry had never seen that expression on his face before.
They walked over to a booth that had freed up not five minutes ago and Harry turned back to the boys at the bar. Gerald had started trying to blow beer bubbles through his nose, Jason was eyeing him with mild horror and a lot of curiosity, and Seb was poking a pretzel with a straw and glaring at it like it had stolen his alcohol. Harry was idly wondering if they’d make it to midnight or if he’d have to cut them off before then when he caught a flash of white-blonde hair in the corner of his eye.
A quick flick through of the rest of the paper revealed nothing else Harry-related which was a miracle on a normal day, let alone his birthday. He met Ron’s eyes with amazement.
They all cheered and raised their half-finished glasses at him before requesting more beers. Harry wondered how any of them were still standing.
Malfoy didn’t respond to Harry’s outburst by yelling back, instead he was calm. “That is true. All the others do deserve recognition too for everything they did, including keeping your stupid self alive. Honestly, Granger deserves a medal for that alone. But just because they also did things, does not mean you
Perhaps it was just a coincidence. Harry had jumped to conclusions before and been devastatingly wrong, but he’d like to think he knew Malfoy better than that.
Scarlett opened her mouth to answer but paused as she seemed to realise something. Harry could practically see the cogs slowly turning in her brain.
Harry raised a challenging eyebrow and lowered his voice, “Yeah? What you gonna do about it, Malfoy? Punish me?”
“Hey, Terrence!” Harry briefly flicked his eyes to the side to see Seb and gang motioning Terry over.
make this work. They complimented each other perfectly and the intense feelings they had for each other, had always had for each other, were worth holding on too. Most importantly, they understood each other better than anyone else could: the loneliness whilst being surrounded by people, the peace anonymity brought, the affection for the muggle world, the traumas of war and the fighting to recover from that and be a better person. They were what each other needed in their lives and were the missing pieces of each other.
Harry nodded and he felt anticipation growing in him. It couldn’t be true, Malfoy couldn’t have been living
“Huh, all those years of silently stalking you around the halls of Hogwarts paid off then. I am now as stealthy as a niffler when Potter-hunting.”
Malfoy’s voice dragged him from his conflicted thoughts and Harry looked up to find Malfoy watching him expectantly. Harry looked down at the money, did a quick count, and glanced back up. “Yes.”
“Oh, I have tried it. I’m banned from The Three Broomsticks and there’s not another pub in Hogsmeade so if I want a drink I have to be prepared to disinfect my robes.”
Just before he slipped out, he caught Malfoy staring at him with concern from across the room. Harry felt his eyes stay on him until he’d pushed the door to the staff room open and disappeared from view.
of it. When threatened, we join together and fight for each other, because usually nobody else will.”
It wasn’t the sneer or smirk Harry was accustomed to; it was soft and sweet and even a little nervous. Harry would go as far as to say it made Malfoy look
But he was the defeater of the Dark Lord, the most-evil wizard of all time, and had fought in a war; he would not be cowed by a twenty-something year old woman in heels so sharp he was pretty sure she could impale someone if she tried.
“Are you interested in getting to know him? Find out what he’s been up to since the last time you saw him?”
“Really?” Harry said flatly. “That’s what you focus on? Not the stalking or mass hysteria or increasing chance of trouble…you know what, forget I said anything. I know you thrive off all that. What was I thinking.”
Hermione sighed and shot a glance at the newspaper still in Harry’s hands. “Who would do something like this?”
He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t looking forward to the moment Malfoy finally came up to him. Harry was self-aware enough to acknowledge he may have been a little too interested in Malfoy, borderline obsessed with him in sixth year. Malfoy had been a huge part of his life, perhaps just as much as Ron and Hermione, and if Harry was being honest it had taken a while to adjust to the lack of Malfoy in his life when school finished. Every time he said something stupid he expected a nasty laugh and insult to follow and was surprised when it didn’t. He’s not sure he’d say he’d missed the bastard, but he was definitely interested in finding out what he’d been up to, what he was like now, if he was still an arsehole…
Mostly professionally anyway. He resolved that if they were going to interrogate him, he’d turn the tables and interrogate them. He wanted information too, after all, and who better to reveal secrets about Malfoy than his probably tipsy drinking buddies? Maybe they could answer some of the questions that were buzzing through his brain and keeping him distracted.
Harry chuckled. “Not only that, Draco Malfoy just forced the Ministry of Magic to shut down for me. Pretty sure if anyone said that to teenage me he’d laugh in their face before having them committed to St Mungo’s for suggesting it.”
He dragged his eyes away from Malfoy for what felt like the millionth time that night and topped up Jason’s glass, receiving a crooked smile in thanks.
“The brooms, all faulty ones the manufacturers just throw out. I asked if I could have them, they said yes. The insult charms…well, I perfected that particular charm in Fourth Year.” Malfoy grinned at him and Harry shook his head, smiling. “The Nifflers were a bit more complicated, but Millie – Millicent Bulstrode – works for a creature rescue charity, and they got wind of a smuggling ring; some wizards were snatching nifflers from the wild and selling them as ‘exotic pets’ to both wizards and muggles. Normally they’d inform the aurors, the aurors would go in wands blazing, and the nifflers would be stuffed in an evidence lockup for a while before either being released or given to Millie’s charity. I volunteered to liberate them early so we could get them to her faster rather than wait for the aurors.”
But then Gerald continued. “That Harry wanted to have hate-sex with you and spied on you in the shower at school. That he wanted to lick chocolate sauce off your naked body. That he had fantasies about you pinning him down and fucking him. That he was interested in you. That he wanted to kiss you when the clock struck midnight.”
careful. She could mention the name of the school without indicating it was magic. Was she trying to be funny? Make a joke with the bartender to lure him in to agreeing to whatever she wanted him to do?
They were all things that had come up in conversations he’d had with Malfoy, or something they’d done in school. Harry distinctively remembered Malfoy’s skill with charms when he made those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges in Fourth Year, so it was within his capabilities. Plus, Malfoy had the money, imagination, and sheer determination – some may say stubbornness - to pull it off. Then of course there was his vindictive streak a mile long.
“No. Me, Scarlett and Bruce all live together. Felicity and Mike are dating, have been for four years, so live together a couple of rooms down.”
There was the sound of a bar stool scraping against the old wooden floor and Harry heard a flurry of movement in front of him as someone hopped up onto it. Harry's eyes widened and he bolted upright to find Malfoy sat there looking at him with one eyebrow raised in amusement. His eyes darted to Harry’s cheek where his hair was glued to his skin by whatever nasty stuff had congealed on the bar. Embarrassed, Harry pulled his sleeve down and rubbed the sticky gunk off his face, feeling his cheeks heat up and grimacing as he did. Another thing Malfoy had been the best at in school was catching Harry in embarrassing situations, and it seemed he still had that ability.
was about our houses: Quidditch, house points, relationships, rivalries. The first thing people wanted to know was what house you were in and the friendships you formed were determined by where you were sorted. A Gryffindor and Slytherin couldn’t be friends, let alone anything more, because of their house pride and values even if they were compatible and would get along well. Nobody would study with a Hufflepuff due to the stereotype they were slow and stupid, even though they got some of the best grades in exams due to their hard work, and Ravenclaws didn’t get invited to parties because they were seen as buzzkills and too uptight. But now we’re older,” Malfoy sighed. “Well, it means a total of jack shit, doesn’t it. It doesn’t
charms and jinxes than was probably good for her health, and eased off on the whole monitoring and punishing thing, gradually dismantling her reign of terror from within? Towards the end we spent our shifts lounging in the common room or occasionally plotting with Peeves if we could get him to stay still long enough.”
“Yes, and poor, innocent blonde wizards are their prey! I still have the scars!” Malfoy yanked up his sleeve and thrust it in Harry’s face.
It came as a complete surprise. The guy looked nerdy and bookish with a light blue cardigan on, curly brunette hair and warm brown eyes hidden behind glasses only slightly more stylish than Harry’s were. He greeted Harry with a soft smile that showed off his dimples. He looked like the sort of person who would be hunkered down in a library studying engineering rather than a guy hanging out with social drinkers who had no sense of personal boundaries.
By this point Harry had worked out that Malfoy’s little group were taking it in turns to buy rounds, though only a couple had been served by Harry. Harry knew that couldn’t continue for the whole night and eventually Malfoy would be in front of him. Each time they finished a round, Harry would panic that Malfoy would be the next to rise and approach him. He was always caught somewhere between relieved and disappointed when it didn’t happen. Each time it wasn’t it made it more likely that next time it would be and Harry felt like his life was on a countdown determined by the amount of beer in a glass. During one round he’d actually filled their table’s glasses with as much as possible to delay the inevitable but when half of it had slopped out all over the floor on the return journey he’d decided it wasn’t worth the clean-up.
Harry smiled and shook his head in amusement. He loved the completely wacky turns conversations could take when people lost their inhibitions.
Ginny had been stolen away by the Captain of the Holyhead Harpies, hopefully to apologise for her chaser’s ‘seduction’ of Ginny’s boyfriend. Luna was stood near a flower arrangement by the double doors, whispering to the plants with a good-looking young man watching her with wide, awestruck eyes. Seamus and Dean were snogging in a corner that also hosted many other couples making out like they weren’t at a public function. Neville was surrounded by fans as he recounted his heroic tales – or more likely, he was giving them comprehensive instructions on how to properly harvest valerian sprigs. Ron had strolled away without even a goodbye the moment he saw the buffet table and Hermione had only lasted half an hour more before she’d disappeared into the crowd. A quick glance over the heads in front of him and around the room showed her nodding with a frown on her face as a stuffy-but-important-looking witch spoke to her, probably about something Harry wouldn’t understand.
The group were still at the same table in the same seats and laughing uproariously at something Bruce had said. He frowned as he noticed all of them had semi-full glasses rather than the nearly empty ones they’d had when he left.
Malfoy looked startled at Harry’s sudden outburst but quickly recovered himself, drawing himself up as if he was expecting Harry to attack him. “I do.”
Harry’s expression must have betrayed his terror at the thought of Felicity, who Harry was convinced would eat him alive given the chance, and Mike, who had no filter and no boundaries, together because Malfoy gave him a sympathetic look. “Yeah, I know. They are a force to be reckoned with when they’re together. Thrive off chaos and making people uncomfortable, but they compliment each other beautifully and want the same things. They’re the perfect couple.” He paused. “Though it’s best not to mess with them, you should bear that in mind.”
“I did have some help,” Malfoy admitted. “Sneaking that amount of dung bombs into the auror department was virtually impossible because, unlike the minister’s office and The Department of Magical Games and Sports, there are still employees there overnight. Luckily for me, Pansy had a meeting with her probation officer and she likes wearing short skirts, so nobody really noticed her ‘accidentally’ leaving her shopping bags full of dung bombs in a few rooms.”
with Pansy, trying to boost her confidence, drag her out of her depression, and repair her family’s reputation even though our own was destroyed because she saw her struggling and nobody else was helping her, only ostracising her. That Millicent set up a support group at her sanctuary, using the creatures there as therapy animals after Greg,” Malfoy broke off, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes and voice dropping to a whisper. “Tried to kill himself. Nobody thought of us, they threw us aside the moment they could and abandoned us, as nobody wanted to help an ex-Death Eater. Even you.”
Harry licked his lips unconsciously. It was his favourite. It was cruel of Malfoy to dangle it in front of him when Harry couldn’t keep it. He wondered what Malfoy would do if Harry drank it before he could take it back.
Harry knew he should look away and quickly go back to serving customers so when Malfoy did spot him it wouldn’t be to the embarrassing sight of Harry looking like a surprised fish with drool coming out of its mouth, but he couldn’t do it. His eyes were glued to Malfoy and he watched in horror as Malfoy turned slowly to see what his friend had wanted to show him and his gaze fell on Harry.
Harry couldn’t help the squeak that came out of his mouth as his head snapped towards the group of men he’d been serving earlier, all of them trying to hurriedly shush a very intoxicated Gerald.
Harry laughed, “I think they’d notice something was up if they started vomiting up blue liquid and you didn’t.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened at the exact same time Harry’s did and his eyebrows shot up in surprise. Clearly, he had been expecting to see Harry as much as Harry had been expecting to see him.
Later that evening, I’m somewhat happy to see Blaise and Neville in the lounge, curled up together watching a shitty, old action film. I wanted to do something for Draco - something sexy, as embarrassing as it sounds - but I hadn’t a clue what he was in to.
"Do you want to come with me?" He asked it, almost in disbelief. It took a couple steps closer to him, still on the sofa, as if to say yes. "And I'm going to have to carry you up the stairs, aren't I?" He didn't wait for an answer, picking the thing up gently and going to his bedroom.
"It was sharp during secondary school, I remember that, but..." Harry leaned in close. Draco took this time to study Harry's own features, not that they had changed much since school, he'd just never had the opportunity.
”I’m fine!” I insisted, punctuating the sentence with a series of sneezes. “Just a sniffle, nothing to worry-” I wasn’t cut off by a deep, hacking cough from my chest, scratching at my throat and causing a horrible bile to rise in my mouth. I spat it out into a tissue before turning back to Draco. “Nothin to worry about,” I smiled, but even I could admit I didn’t even sound well.
“I don’t remember buzzing anyone into the building,” he announced as he opened the door, ready for conflict. He frowned. “Weasley. Granger. You’re here, at my house.” He processed the situation aloud.
"The kitten!" She gasped, ignoring him for a second, jogging over to stroke the cat. "Oh, sorry. Yeah, probably. What's up?"
”I told you to wait in the car. I was just going to be a minute.” Draco’s voice sounds stern and he hasn’t noticed me yet.
James immediately jumped up onto the counter once they reached the kitchen, eager to watch Draco cook.
”I’d tell whoever was my second in command, or Luna, down some meds and get back into the action. I’d just blame the cough on smoking or something. Worked every time.” I shrugged, before yawning.
”You never knew Narcissa Black. Why do you think they married me off to your father, such a strict man, couldn’t be more against muggles if he tried.” She muttered, tutting at her late husband before taking a sip of her tea. “Pansy stopped by the other day,” she went on to say. “Asked to view the library.”
Sorry I haven’t posted recently. Had to take some time for myself. Hopefully there’ll be an update soon and thanks for your support. If you enjoy my writing and want you support me further, consider buyig me a ko-fi:
When he woke, he was glad to see James still close to him. He was a little less glad when he heard his doorbell ringing in an incessant manner which could only bring to mind one person.
"Bugger off," Was the chuckled reply. Harry kept looking above, as if eye contact between them would make talking harder. "I saw a side of you I never thought I'd get to see. I didn't have to worry about being 'The Boy Who Lived'. I could just wake up every day with no expectations placed on me." He brought a hand up to play with the collar that was still around his neck. "I was just James. Nothing more, nothing less. But I guess that's the end of that, right?"
"Harry?" Oh god, I wanted to take him in my arms and tell him how I felt. But I didn't know how he'd react. "This isn't what you think it is," I cleared up. "I didn't come here to end our relationship. Because I can tell that's what you're thinking."
"Well he included 'virgin' in it but that might be a bit specific." I looked to the line up, seeing him as number 4. I know he was just looking at the reflection, but it was almost as if he was looking right at me, like he knew I was there. I had to sit down. Blaise gave me a worried look, but continued with it, asking each one to step forward and say the phrase. I tried to block it out, covering my ears when I knew he was next, but I still heard it, and it still made me gag. Within moments I was back there, back in the alley, him close to me, trying to convince me Draco didnt love me, that I was a girl, a 'perfect little virgin princess'. Suddenly I could feel his hands on me, feel him inside me, and I shouted and screamed to get him off me.
Draco wanted to be furious at her for getting him something that meant a lot to him, even something as simple as chocolates. He only glared at her as she continued to smirk knowingly.
"Good morning to you too," he chuckled, still half asleep, and brought a hand up to stroke the cat. James went to bump his head into Draco's hand affectionately but stopped when he saw the tattoo on his inner-forearm. He mewed softly, going to paw at it gently. Draco brought his arm down, resting it on the bed beside him and watched as James slowly examined it. "It's stuck there forever, James," he added once the kitten had tried to lick it off. "Nothing's gonna get rid of it," he sighed.
They sat opposite each other, catching up for a little while, James sitting comfortably next to Draco.
I’m not prepared enough for when he brings his hand sharply on my left cheek, the sharp sting sending pain shooting through me.
“We aren’t at that stage yet and it’s probably a bit forward of me, but when we eventually get to... fucking, where do you want it?” I stare at him blankly.
“I’d tell you no more recruitment drives but you only needed one.” She seethed. “Now, out!” I’m pushed out of the house by the old lady, before the door is slammed behind me.
“Yeah. Sirius was always one for dramatics.” I chuckled. “That’s why your father liked him so much.” I’d been told stories of the two men. Blind idiots in love is what my mother patently called them. “Anyway. I know you’re only 16, and you have your whole life ahead of you, but I don’t want this to be forced on you. I want you to have the choice.” He gives me a confused look. “Currently, I have no heir, so to speak. I may never have one. Because of this, as my godson, I want to ask you if you would like to be my heir.” Teddy is silent, staring at me in disbelief. “You don’t have to answer now. And even if you don’t want to be heir, the Griffins will always accept you as a member. But if something were to happen to me, would you be willing to take my place?”
I hear footsteps approaching, but don't bother looking as I knew the alley wasn't completely abandoned.
"Some things happened and I got sent home for the day." He gave me an odd look, asking me to explain. "I got into a bit of a fight - it was one-sided, really - and the captain suggested I come home."
“It’s entirely bullshit,” Draco rolled his eyes, before watching in disbelief as the redhead squatted down to talk to the cat.
“A friend of mine was shot recently, and the detectives got a new lead on the case, so he came to let me know.”
No one had come forward about the cat. After some experimenting with names, he and Melissa - because she seemed more invested in the kitten than he was - had found that the kitten responded to James. Draco had tried other nicknames to, like Jamie, Jamesie and Jay, none of which earned respect from the cat. But as is with most cats, respect is hard to earn.
"Sounds good. We'll have two officers waiting outside the door to cuff him and take him to get DNA samples. But you can leave as soon as you identify him."
”Can you do one thing for me?” He asks as I’m about to leave. I turn to face him. “You and Draco need to make it official.” He winks, before turning to unpack.
"You think you're so bloody important, running this fantasy gang because your family left you some money. You think that Draco loves you, huh? Running around, prancing about, pretending to be a boy so you can act like this fucking fairy faggot who managed to make a straight man suck your cock! Well you're nothing! You're not the king of some gang, you're just a fucking slag, prancing around, hoping to get someone to fuck your arsehole so you don't get stuck with a kid."
"Could I get Blaise's number? Draco's phone must have died." Lying was turning out to be one of my strengths, I'll have to add that to my CV.
When I wake the next morning, sunlight is streaming in gently through the windows and the plug has stopped moving about. I sit up in bed, letting a soft yawn slip through my lips. The event starts of last night rush to my head and I feel a blush settle on my cheeks. Speaking of, I can feel a slight soreness on my asscheeks from daddy’s spanking. Not knowing the time, I decide to get up. I pad downstairs in my panties and hoodie, my feet gentle on the hardwood flooring. I don’t hear any noise coming from the kitchen so I assume Draco is still asleep.
"So, Harry, still dating that chick?" Fred asked with a grin, halfway through the meal. "What was her name again?"
”Just yours, daddy.” I whimper, lost in a haze of pleasure. By some will of the Gods, I climax as he does, pleasure shooting through my body as he covers my insides with ropes of cum.
"If I want him put away, Yes." I answered for him, looking him in the eye. He gave me a sad smile. "Thanks for the lift," I muttered, before heading back into my home.
"Those are nice," Harry muttered after a while, Draco still softly drying his hair. He felt Draco stop, probably to have a peek at the TV screen.
"This? You're only fooling yourself. We all know you've got a sweet, wet cunt down there." He took it and threw it down the alley. I whimpered, and closed my eyes. This was a mistake.
The following day, I find myself in an adult shop. It takes me a while to build up the courage to go in - what makes it worse is that the person who‘s working it is also a member of the gang.
Draco stalked over to her, rolling up his sleeves slightly before gripping her collar and roughly shoving her against one of the police cars.
I place the phone down in the kitchen table before letting out a worried sigh. I turn around to get dressed when I see a note on the fridge door.
"Say another fucking word about the gangs or Harry and it'll be your murder that's being investigated." He hisses, before throwing her to the floor. "Come back here again and I'll turn my eye to whatever these kids do to you." He walked back over to me, placing a protective arm around my waist and pulling me close to him. "Sorry, that got a bit out of hand, but the way she spoke about you made me see red." He said quietly to me.
”I’ll start undressing in the vicinity of you when I know you won’t harass me. Go on Grindr for god’s sake, Seamus.” Rather than standing to observe the conversation, Draco came over and sat by me, joining in as he threw an arm around me.
I have now realised I haven’t even touched anal plugs yet, which is like, one of the first tags I put. I PROMISE there will be plugs soon. Very soon (very very soon!!)
”Men get pleasure from it.” Seamus leaned against Dean. “See, with a woman, their g-spot is up their, you know. Men have it up the ass. You fuck that and you’re both having a good time. We can have a good time if you want.” How Thomas put up with the Irish lad, I don’t know, but he rolled his eyes and pushed the kid away from him. “But imagine, you’re butt fuckin’ a guy and he’s screaming yer name because he actually enjoys it!” Dean got up, leaving the room and the conversation with his hands held up in frustration. Seamus followed, loudly giving us all an example. “Oh Dean! Oh fuck Dean! Right there baby!” He shouted, following Dean to wherever he had gone.
Somewhere along the line, glances across the room turned into soft touches as they passed and a peck on the cheek.
“I’d say having someone balls deep in me would be fairly intimate.” I counter, making Neville laugh. He walks past us with a nod, heading to his room. No doubt to start on his share of the marijuana. I wouldn’t blame him. A stable source with high quality products for a good price. I treat my gang, what can I say.
”His son gave me a lift home today. He wasn’t there with us but he can confirm I was there this morning. I’m not sure who else.” I trail off.
“Thank you for doing this. It takes a lot to come forward and to have to recount those horrific details. Many people say it’s like having it done to you all over again, and I agree wholly. But if it helps to get this person off the streets and to keep others safer, then perhaps it must be done. I’ll be seeing you around, Harry.” With that, she left, Blaise entering after she does.
We head straight for the kitchen to get drinks, something strong preferably, before heading to a room with the loudest music in. I see Finnegan immediately begin chatting to some of the lads in the room and something flickers in Thomas’ eyes, but the Irish lad only seems to be being platonic. If you can call a sly hand on their chest platonic. Once they finish conversing, I head over to the guy and ask how he knows Finnegan.
”But no concrete evidence of where you were.” She hums. “Harry what happened last night whilst you were at Officer Malfoy’s?”
As his shift neared an end, Draco saw black clouds rolling through the sky, and he had just closed his front door behind him when the first flash of lightning lit the room up. Rain came down hard and fast, slamming on the windows loudly.
“I’ve made my decision.” He states once we’ve finished eating. “I’ll join the gang!” He exclaims loudly. I shake my head with a small chuckle, finding his excitement amusing. Andromeda, however, stands up silently and takes her plate through to the kitchen. “Oh. What’s wrong with her?”
“To see you. Is it not obvious?” She replied with an attitude as usual, stopping stroking James to speak with Draco.
“Because I’m so hot?” He doesn’t deny it. In fact, he smiles a bit. “What if I am back here soon?” I tempt.
In all of this confusion, I find myself gazing at Draco, and suddenly I am aware of the throbbing in my crotch. Thanks to the testosterone, as well as making my clit strangely big, it also hugely increased my libido. And now I was horny. While surrounded by Draco’s family. Crap.
“Your father helped create the gang. The Griffins, at the time of its creation, was of course small. But with time, it grew slowly. The Griffins was a family of people who had had close friends turn their back on the, people who were hated or ignored by their family. Rarely people joined because they wanted to be in a gang for fun. It’s a close knit community of people who needed the support. It still is.”
"Aw, James," Draco cooed, crouching down to get to the cat's level. "You scared of the storm buddy?" James mewed softly in response, poking his head out from under the bed. Draco coaxed him out, picking him up gently as to not scare him before laying on his bed. "I used to get scared of storms too, you know." He spoke as if he were trying to calm a child, as if James could actually understand what he was saying.
"What are you doing?" Draco chuckled, the kitten tugging at some hair which had fallen onto Draco's face. James looked down at Draco from where he was standing, practically nose to nose with each other, green eyes to grey.
He contemplated using the array of expensive-looking soaps and whatnot but decided that he'd rather not face Draco's wrath after wasting such bougie products. Instead, he let himself slip a little further under the water as his body soaked up the warmth, grateful for this recovery from the harsh winter night still raging outside.
”Your situation? Oh, you mean banging my dad. No thanks.” Scorp meets my gaze through the rear view mirror.
”Anything that you want to say to me can be said in front of Neville.” He gives me a pointed look. I sigh before replying.
”I uh... I was taken to the police station with a couple other gang members. Then when I was released I went home with my boyfriend and spent the night at his house.”
”Hi Harry! Hello Officer Malfoy.” She grins. I wave to her. “Andromeda called; Teddy’s on his way now.”
"Damn, I hate you so much though. You really sure I can't ride with Goyle?" I replied sarcastically as we began to head for the cars out front.
"He's a bit.. arrested at the moment." Blaise said after a moment. I stopped in my tracks just by the front desk.
A series of emotions danced across Harry's face in the short space of time that followed; disappointment, confusion, and embarrassment included, with a small blush rising to his cheeks to finish it off. He was a little speechless.
My eyes gazed over his body before I saw the bruises. First I saw the ones on his neck, clear marks where Goyle's fingers had pressed harshly against Harry's throat. Then the ones on his waist and hips, much larger. His wrists, too, were bruised. The bruises were clearly beginning to fade but were still a hue of purple which was sharp against Harry's skin.
“In town? Since when did you go to town?” He asked as he headed into the kitchen, preparing some tea for the both of them.
“James?” Draco called entering the flat, like he was coming home to a spouse. The kitten came bounding down the stairs, the pat pat pats of his paws on the carpet warming Draco inside-out.
No. No. Not when. If. I’m only getting done for speeding. I can pay the fine easy. They won’t search my car for drugs. I’m fine.
“A long time ago, long before you or I were born, a man and his friends created a gang. He and his friends had often been ignored by family members, Hell, this guy was practically hated by his family. They knew what it was like to only have your closest friends to turn to, or to have someone close betray you.” I took a breath. “This man was Sirius Black, a distant relative of yours, and my godfather. And his friends, James Potter and Lily Evans, my parents, as well as Peter Pettigrew and your father, Remus Lupin.”
"They know better than to mess with us." I tell him, before heading outside. Standing in front of my house are thirty or so Serpents, angry expressions on all of their faces.
”Please, Daddy. I promise I’ll never miss behave again.” I whimper as he makes me kneel by his feet. He looks at me with a smirk, unbuttoning his trousers and pulling his cock out, which is hard and stands to attention. I feel my mouth begin to water at the sight and I ache for it inside of me. However he simply turns the TV, turning to a porn channel where he slowly strokes himself to a video of an older man furiously pounding into a bound and gagged twink. Watching the video, I imagine what it would be like to be that twink, and I feel myself grow impossibly more horny. I wiggle about on the plug inside of me, trying to get something from it. But it wasn’t long enough, and it’s base didn’t allow for the movement I needed.
I shook my head, "it was uh. You know the guy that Draco sometimes patrols with? Usually he stays in the car if Dray comes to visit." Ron nodded, his eyebrows furrowing a little.
When I woke the next day, I wasn’t feeling as bright or as energetic as I had the day before. My throat was dry and sore, like I’d been deepthroating a cactus, and my nose was blocked. My ears were too and all the will to move my muscles had left me.
”Fuck, baby. Like that.” I give a few more tentative licks, along the base of the shaft and around the head, loving the way he praises me with each action. I take the tip into my mouth, swirling the tongue around it for a second before sliding down and taking as much of it as I could into my mouth. I’m barely halfway down when I feel it hit the back of my throat. My gag reflex kicks in immediately and I splutter around the member in my mouth. I pull back, looking apologetically up at Draco. He leans forward slightly, cupping my face in one of his hands. “You’re doing fantastic, baby.”
"How fucking DARE you!" I shouted, spitting in his face. "You worthless piece of shit. I trusted you. I thought you were a friend." Goyle only smiled at me, his eyes gleaming. With my free arm, I punched him in the gut, earning a groan of pain. "You disgust me." I spat at him. "You don't even deserve to be alive right now."
”Just so you know,” Scorp began as he drove us back to the estate, “we could all hear you two last night.” I don’t know how to reply. Part of me wants to be an embarrassed, blushing mess, but the other part of me wants to be snarky and confident about it. I try the latter.
From where he now lay against me, I could feel him pressing against the zipper of his trousers. I wrapped my arms around his neck and ground myself against him, our moans joining together in the otherwise silence of the room. He finished undressing me, tossing my boxers away from us, before leaning down to meet my crotch.
"Quiet now, Princess." He hushed me. "I don't want to harm you, darling," I shook my head violently. He shushed me like I was a baby. A hand on my hip. A tug forward. Hand behind thigh. I felt him.
“There’s a shower through that door,” was all he said, pointing to my right. “Take as long as you need.” The look in his eyes had changed, but I ignored it, knowing that all he sees is a victim, someone he should feel sorry for. Someone who’s broken and ruined.
"I brought a plus one, hope you don't mind," Blaise smiled, gesturing to Longbottom, who was stood slightly behind him, grasping the man's hand in his own.
“One sec!” I yell, panicked. Draco tucks himself back into his trousers and does the fly up, before going to answer the door. I grab my boxers, pulling them on and setting my packer into place. Before I can get some clothes on, Draco swings my door open to reveal Luna, a cheerful look on her face as always. She doesn’t bat an eyelid at my appearance - sex hair, no clothes, the usual - and instead greets us happily.
"Such a perfect ass, baby. Can't wait to be inside it." This send a wave of warmth through me, and I spread my legs further. His head dives between them again, licking my hole before his tongue dives into it. I can't tell how long he spends down there but it has a chain of moans and happy sighs falling from my mouth before he finally pulls back. He grabs a pillow, propping it under my hips before he reaches into a drawer and pulls out a bottle - lube. I hear the cap flip open and it's a couple seconds before a cold, slick finger is pressing at my hole. I press against it, quietly moaning Draco's name as it slips in. His lips press against the small of my back as he waits for me to get used to the intrustion. "You're doing so well for me baby. So good." Another kiss and I wiggle my ass, getting him to move his finger. He pushes it in and out a few times, curling it as well, before a second lube-covered finger presses into me. This time he doesn't wait before he begins to scissor the digits, stretching my hole a little further each time. I shove my face into the mattress so the rest of the household can't hear the loud moan I let out. This annoys Draco.
”Nothing? So, I’ll just leave for work and let you carry on your day, running about the gang trying to organise the mess that it is?”
”Scorp? What the hell are you doing in here?” I head back into the garage and see Draco with the kid from earlier.
“There’s a few extras in the side pocket. They can stay here.” She nods, heading upstairs. I turn to the man beside me. “Come on.” I lead him outside, showing him the estate and greeting a few others we see along the way. We head into a small alleyway where no one will bother us, and I turn to face him. “So why are you really here?”
They spent a good while talking to Millie about the muggle world. Draco, despite practically living in it for almost a decade, still had a lot to learn, and the other three were intrigued - or perhaps amused - by the way muggles handled situations which seemed impossible without magic.
“Don’t think for one second I don’t want to fuck you.” He says inbetween kisses. “It took so much in me not to just fuck you on that car bonnet when I arrested you last night.” He adds with a growl. I moan as he attaches his lips to mine again, before letting them trail across my jawline and down my throat. I feel myself throbbing with want. Not even the danger of being seen with him is bothering me. Not that anyone would care. I’m the Griffin King, if I want to get off with someone down an alley, then I fucking will.
"Now, I didn't know what to get you so I got you a bit of everything," she admitted with a smile. "And yes, I wrapped everything in there." She added with a wink. Draco peered inside the bag, noticing a charm had been placed on it to make it bigger on the inside. Not bottomless, but certainly bigger.
Unfortunately, when I woke later, both women had already left, as well as Draco. I meandered downstairs, a yawn slipping from my mouth, and headed into the kitchen, where my clothes were folded on the side with a note placed on top.
“What were you thinking, Harry?” Neville scolds once we’re in his car. “I understand you’re like, our leader, but you still have to be careful.”
Teddy slowly nods. “I think... ok. I accept the offer of being your heir. Although, if you’re with Draco...”
"I lived in this huge mansion. Black wallpaper, dark wood furnishings. None of this muggle electricity either. It was gloomy on a good day. Storms turned the house pitch black, thunder seemed to echo down the hallways and lightning made the coats in my wardrobe look like boggarts, although they look like what you fear most, so- never mind." He shook his head smiling, getting off track while talking to a kitten was a feat. "My mother tried her best to calm me, but soon I realised I had to stop being scared of storms because there were worse things to be scared off. At Hogwarts, I put on a brave face. And at home, the storm was the last thing keeping me up at night.
“Oh, go ahead,” she chuckled. “I need to head home. See you soon, Draco!” She gave the man a quick hug and wished Narcissa farewell before heading off.
He let the sheets fall, revealing a turtleneck sweater which looked like it hadn't been washed in days.
“Miss Hayley Lily Potter. 19 years old. Female. With a vagina.” He speaks bluntly. I can’t contain my anger and slam my hands on the table.
I closed the door behind me and sat on the end of the bed. I didn't know how to say what I was about to say.
The streetlights offered little help in the midnight darkness. The snow only left Harry colder and more confused than he was before.
"James!" He called, letting the kitten know he was home, just as he always did. He fixed himself a cup of tea quickly, not knowing how long the power would last.
”Hm. Wouldn’t be a punishment if you came, would it?” He asks, before pulling his hand from my trousers before I could reach my climax. I whine loudly.
Harry let out a soft 'oh' of realisation, blushed a little more, and handed his empty mug to Draco, avoiding eye contact after his blunder.
"Thanks," he smiled, scratching the top of James' head. "I know you don't know what I'm saying, but thanks."
“Thank you, Harry.” She stopped the tape recorder. “On a less official note, it’s horrible to think that, possibly, someone who I work with has done this. It’s disgusting. Please, don’t be offended at me saying ‘possibly’. It’s not that I don’t believe you. I do. It’s just, in my line of work we can’t go forward without that DNA evidence - of which I’m sure will be a match to who you say it is.
”I had a lot of films to catch up on when I got here.” I answer. I step aside and let Draco talk to his cousin. Teddy brings him into a very tight hug, and as the head catch up I can’t help but notice how good Draco is with him. Once they’re done, Draco am done I grab one of his bags each and I lead us over to house 3.
“One.” And then one on my right cheek. “Two.” I take a sharp breath in. He slaps me twice, once on each cheek, and then once again on the left, but slightly further down so it’s mostly on my thigh. I let out a yelp. “Five.” A quarter done. Even by now my ass was stinging, and I wanted it to stop. Another two spanks in quick succession, and slowly the pain ebbs away as pleasure begins to mask it. “Seven. Eight” He adds as he slaps my ass again. I fail to hold back a small moan. “Oh yes, that’s right. You’re a little pain slut aren’t you?” He chuckles. “That’s alright. Once we finish this I’ll have to find some other punishments for you.”
By some miracle of Merlin and Morgana, Draco actually slept in that morning. Something which has only happened once in his life, on a day which sleeping in was certainly not an option. It may or may not have been on the day of his final, and main, exam at University, the exam which was make or break on his entire future.
”Daddy wait!” Draco leans back into the room curiously. “Can I borrow a hoodie, daddy?” I ask, gesturing to my mostly naked body. He rolls his eyes before disappearing for a second, returning with a light grey hoodie. I slip it on quickly, pulling the sleeves over my hands and immediately being surrounded by his scent. I lean up on my tip toes and press a kiss to his cheek. “Goodnight Daddy.” I say gently.
"Time to go home, kitten." He coaxed the cat awake, softly stroking its back as it shifted slightly, before those bright green eyes peered up at him. It chirped at him, sitting up on his chair. He picked it up with one hand, trying his best to make sure it felt safe in his grip, and left the cafe. He locked the door behind him and then dutifully pulled down the shutters, securing them to the floor with the padlocks to ensure the glass windows and door didn't get a brick through them during the night. He had worked too hard for this place for that to happen.
I can’t help but moan, feeling his fingers rubbing me in such a manner. He moves his head down, dragging his tongue from it to my asshole. My hands grab his hair, trying to keep him there, but he easily grabs them and pins them above myself head.
Once I’ve regained my strength, Malfoy and I make our way back to my house. Once we walk back inside, Thomas sends us a knowing smirk at the sight of our disheveled hair and clothing, but he doesn’t say anything. I kick my shoes off by the front door, encouraging Blondie to do the same, as we hear a loud moan from upstairs. My eyes widen and Blondie snickers, and I quickly lead him into the kitchen, where Weasley and Granger are stood chatting.
"It's comfortable," Harry shrugged it off, although he still seemingly 'forgot' to remove the collar. "Are you working today?" He asked, changing the conversation topic quickly.
He let the cat down onto the bed before slipping under the covers himself, smiling gently as it moved to lay at the top end of the bed.
"Green," He spoke softly. I leant down, pressing a gentle kiss to his lips. He took a second to return it. As much as I had missed him, I didn't press further. I waited for him to pull away. When he did, I moved my thumb across to his cheek, gently rubbing a small circle but not applying any pressure.
I couldn't even be with friends anymore. I was ruined. Charlie was basically family, but the way I had acted, it was as if he were some grotesque monster. I couldn't even handle a bit of physical banter because all I could imagine were those hands on me.
"Good luck kid." Zabini smiled, gesturing to where Draco was leaning against his car, looking extremely displeased. As Zabini headed inside the house, Draco began walking over, authority in his step. I held in my breath, waiting to see what would happen, as he strode past me into the household, leaving the door open. I followed him in up to my room, where he slammed the door behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest, threatening to break my ribs if it beat any harder. Draco looked angry, and stared me down, making me feel like I was tiny.
”Oh.” I blush hard and look down. “We, um. We watched TV and then... went to bed.” I simplified it down a lot.
When Draco finally appears in the doorway, his shirt is slightly unbuttoned and he’s pulling his trousers off. He closes the door behind him softly, not wanting to draw attention from our guests, and he throws his trousers onto the floor before pulling his shirt off.
“And a kitten too! Aww, hey baby!” She cooed at James, leaning down to stroke him. James meowed happily, ignoring how Draco very clearly felt about this entire situation. “You look like an old classmate of mine,” she giggled to the cat.
“It’s- its the morning after pill.” He stated quietly. I nodded once, taking the medication before letting him lead me to a small room, with a table, two chairs either side and a mirror on one wall, which was clearly one way.
“No.” Pansy corrected, coming to stand opposite him again, wand in hand and hair now a mess. “I want to turn an animagus back into a human. Don’t you think it’s weird?”
”Maybe invite Teddy. Trust me, Scorp is going to bug us a lot if we don’t distract him.” I nod. After giving me Seamus’ number, he gives me a quick peck on the cheek before exiting, leaving me stood blushing like a mess.
"Well... I was once the son of leading Death Eater Lucius Malfoy. I was the boy who let the Death Eaters in Hogwarts. Now I run a coffee shop."
“Our team of experts will be able to use evidence left on you by the attacker to determine his or her identity. I understand it's not a comfortable experience, but it's our best shot at catching the guy." I was silent as I let the officer half carry me to the police car, and silent still as I was driven back to the police station. Along the way, I listened to the officers speak in various codes back to the station, letting them know of our arrival.
"I've been him for two months," Harry replied with a chuckle, sending Draco that lopsided grin which he hadn't seen in years.
"Hmm. Boyfriend." I lean up and kiss him slowly but passionately, humming as his arms slip wrap around me and hold me close.
"Tyler, this is Officer Zabini. Or, I can go get a female officer of you prefer." She smiled. She had obviously heard about the request from when Alyssa had called.
"Yeah, I'm Harry." I stepped out of the house and let the door close behind us. "Did you want to see Luna? I'm sure she'd be able to help you with anything you need."
Draco ducked into the kitchen, where he promptly took off his cloak before making a round of tea for everyone.
"Never stop wearing them, for God's sake." He groans, slipping a finger between my cheeks and rubbing my hole. I squirm slightly in his lap an he captures my lips in his in reply. He stands up, still holding me, and throws me onto the bed, where I was a minute ago. While I get comfortable, he pulls his own clothes off, and he leans over me on the bed, buck ass naked. He brings his crotch down, rubbing his bare dick against my covered crotch and I can't help but to gasp. I wrap my arms around his neck, grinding against him as I bring him down for a seering kiss, teeth clashing. He pulls back from the kiss for a second to slip the thong down my legs, throwing it into a corner of the room. "How far do you want to go?"
”It’s my T injections. I’m a couple days late because I got so wrapped up in... us. Sorry for not saying anything.” A sneeze escaped, making Draco smile at me.
When I emerged, Zabini handed me two plastic cups. One with water, one with a pill. I gave it a weird look.
“Alright,” Draco smiled, “but you can’t cross this line,” he said, drawing an imaginary line across the surface. “This is a food prep area. Also I don’t want to be eating your hairs.”
“I’ll have you sticking to orders in no time, baby boy.” Malfoy winks at me, ignoring the other two people in the kitchen. Weasley chokes on his drink and Mione lets out a small laugh. I can only stand there blushing.
Draco didn’t own a mobile phone nor any ‘social media’ accounts, so the only way for her to contact him was to pop into the café, which she tended to do after each shift.
“Shame you got that ban. But I guess you got a boyfriend out of it?” He’s joking, but I smile and shrug my shoulders.
”Drink this and then strip.” I quickly drink the cold water, not realising how parched my throat was. Handing the empty glass back to him, I begin to take my clothes off, chucking them into a pile by the locked door. I hesitate when I go to pull my trousers down, but Draco clears his throat impatiently and I shove them off. “Maybe leave those on for now.” He looks at the pair of panties that I’m wearing with a smirk, before picking up my clothes.
My vision was blurry thanks to the tears, but I could see the deep worry in his eyes. "Harry, he's gone now. They've got him. You're safe now. You're here in the police station with me, you're safe." I nodded slowly. "This isn't professional of me, but am I ok to hug you?" I smiled at him, at him being so considerate. I nodded.
“You brought a cat with you...” he mumbled, before carrying on. “I started seeing Nev about a year ago. We kind of haven’t told many people though. I don’t even know if he’s told his mates.” Blaise scratched the back of his neck awkwardly.
“She hates us.” I shrug. “I think your gran wants me gone. I’d better head off.” I’m about to leave the house when Teddy tugs on my sleeve. I stop in my tracks, turning to face him.
Eventually Harry relaxed and Draco carried him up to their bed, tucking him in a little as Harry slept off what he had just been through. Draco didn't truly understand what exactly Harry had been through, but he had been carrying it for years, and Draco understood the toll that has on a person.
I turn my head when I hear footsteps approach but his hand grabs the top of my head, not too roughly, and turns it to face forward. I hold in a small whimper at the action and he places a few things on the coffee table. I don’t try to look at what they are though.
Harry looked up to him, quirking his head to the side slightly as he did. "What do you mean by that?" Draco raised an eyebrow. "It's just relaxing, alright? I think I'm allowed to relax."
"What were you thinking about?" Draco asked after a moment of silence, because of course Harry loved to spend time remembering their time together on quiet mornings, and of course Draco knew this.
“Can...” I thought for another second before continuing what I wanted to say. “Can you make sure Officer Goyle goes with him, please?”
He woke early the next morning, as always on his days off, and, knowing it would be pointless to try to get back to sleep, he headed downstairs and turned on his filter coffee machine. Not wanting to wait long for a cup of joe, he poured a cup as soon as enough had gone though, adding milk and just a little sugar to taste. He went about opening the curtains in his flat and other menial chores until he was interrupted by the black cat again, once more pawing at the front door.
"It seems to easy. Was there no one else? Perhaps someone jealous of his power - it's a pretty big gang, you have to admit."
"I'm going to the Weasley's tomorrow, but I know Draco has a day off. I was thinking maybe you and Scorp could spend the day with him. He's been pretty busy recently so it might be nice if he got to spend some time with you guys."
“Hey, kid. You ok?” I feel him nod his head against my chest, but his shoulders shake gently and I can tell he’s crying. “Hey, listen. You’re with family now. The Griffins are family. And family means no one gets left behind.” He pulls back.
"Nuh-uh." She cut him off. "You've been sneaking glances at him every chance you could get, don't think I wouldn't notice. Your little smile when you realised he was looking back at you too."
I head into the kitchen, where two uniformed officers, as well as Blaise standing in the corner, looking concerned. He smiles when he sees me, and I sit at the table opposite the two officers.
As the evening passed by, Draco didn't feel much like moving. Instead, he and James lay in bed together, Draco switching between stroking James' back and scratching below his ears, which always earned a loud purr from the kitten.
That was, until, he noticed James moving. Wriggling in his sleep, hissing, scratching at something that wasn’t there. Panicking, Draco threw his book down and tried his best to wake the cat.
"So I left. When you were sing-songing about the dress you were going to wear, I left. I turned into a cat and ran. Ran as far as I could when I reached Draco's café. Maybe it was some twist of fate that led me here exactly, I'm not sure. But the months that I've spent here have been exceedingly better than the years I spent with you."
"Guilt," Draco lied. Harry saw right through him. "Why were you even trying to walk in the snow? Why not wait for a recovery vehicle? You know you'll get yourself killed that way, right?"
“I uh... fuck yeah ok.” I run a hand through my hair in frustration. “I’ll be there as soon as I can. Don’t know when that’ll be but I’ll see you later.”
"Because they're scum." She spits. "They contribute nothing to society, they go around causing harm to others and damage to properties, disrupting people's lives. You're just blinded by your dick because you get to fuck the tranny." Not even a second later and Draco has sent a forceful fist into her jaw, leaving a large red mark on the skin and causing her lips to swell.
There was a knock at the front door, and when I went to open it I wasn't surprised to see him stood there.
"What, you're going to have to ask me every time you want a hug? How am I going to manage when you want sex?"
”Draco messaged me last night when you were there. It’s not concrete proof you were there’s, but he hadn’t no reason to lie about your location.” The police officer looks down at her notepad.
After sitting down on the sofa, he glances at me. He pats his thighs and I go to straddle him, but he places a hand on my chest and pushes me back.
“Don’t worry, I wasn’t listening! I’m just going to go in and see if any hairs were left behind. Almost done know.” I turned back to Blaise as she went to work, but the look on his face told me he thought he was right. Within a minute or so, the doctor had finished. She packaged everything and labelled it up.
Introductions were made quickly, with James recognising Blaise quickly and taking a friendly interest in Neville - not that Draco was jealous.
"Daddy..." I whisper, as I feel myself tip over the brink. I moan loudly, my hands twisting in the bedsheets and my back arching sharply, pleasure jolting through me. Draco moans my name loudly and I feel him release in me as his thrusts slow but continue, riding out his orgasm. Spent, he pulls out of me and lays down on the bed next to me, both our breaths heavy. He kisses me softly, a hand cupping my face.
“Yeah. Might be a bit awkward. Sirius was the black sheep of the family, no pun intended, and Andromeda might have brought Teddy up with that idea. But he needs to know about it. His father was a part of the gang, almost prince consort as well.” I chuckle. “It’s his heritage, I guess. And I don’t exactly have any kids to pass it in to.”
“Remus and Sirius had an on again off again relationship during their life. Idiots in love. Didn’t know how to handle it.” Teddy nods slowly, before throwing his arms around me wishing me goodbye and heading back upstairs. Andromeda appeared in his place, a stern look on his face.
“Harry, please-“ Blaise tried, as I started rushing out of the stirrups and going to find my clothes.
"I'm Officer Waters, that there is officer Stoke. Do you mind giving me your name?" She asked gently. She waited calmly for me to answer.
He walked out into the lounge. No sign of James as another flash of lightning lit up the dark sky outside, followed quickly by a loud, bellowing roar of thunder.
When he drops me off, I see two police cars parked messily outside my home, and I head in cautiously. In the living room is a large amount of the gang, sitting around and talking anxiously. They all look up when I enter the room, and Ginny rushes over, throwing her arms around me in a hug. I’m taken aback slightly but don’t push away.
This isn't happening. This is a nightmare. You'll wake up any minute in Draco's arms. At home. Safe. With people who love you. Just count to three. I thought to myself, each second he came closer to me with that thing.
"Ugh, it's so gross," Melissa groaned, fanning cool air to her face with her hands. Draco chuckled in reply. In the past month, the weather had been fairly cool, but had become a lot hotter within just a week, heatwave temperatures. Not a single person seemed to be enjoying the typical June weather, though.
I showered quickly once inside, and dressed quicker, hating the sight of those marks on my body. I had a light breakfast, and by the time I was finished, 'Milne and Ron were ready to go.
I slipped out of Draco’s arms, which were grasping lightly at my waist, and slipped out of bed, stumbling slightly, my balance gone. I showered quickly, the steam easing my sinuses and giving some relief to my heavy head.
She was silent for a while, and both Draco and Harry waited with their breaths held. Ginerva nodded once, then twice, before standing. She didn't say much, only a short thank-you to Harry, before she headed out the door leaving the men in silence.
We dance for what feels like hours but I don’t get tired. I can feel myself sweating through my clothes but I haven’t drank since I got here and I don’t feel thirsty. The bass beats through me like my own heartbeat and I can feel the thudding in my skull.
”Since Rose-Anne recommended I go to the farmer’s market during book club.” She answered innocently.
“My gender? Was that not obvious? What’s my dick got to do with this? Sorry I didn’t realise I was at a speed dating event. How many siblings do you have? Any pet peeves?” I could tell my voice was growing louder.
Harry chuckled, partially because it was true and partially from surprise at how easy it was to talk to Malfoy, “But you managed to adjust alright? How has it been?”
Harry wasn’t sure how the conversation had turned from a light-hearted and enjoyable discussion on Malfoy’s pretty amazing pranks to an in-depth and emotional analysis on house stereotypes, prejudice, and the neglect suffered after the war, but what he did know was that Malfoy had just bared a part of his soul for Harry. Harry wasn’t stupid enough to take that lightly or for granted. There was no way Malfoy would’ve given this to Harry in the past. Malfoy always had a perfectly crafted mask, one that only seemed to chip away when he was around Harry, and walls nobody could beat down. The only time Harry had seen those walls fall was when they were in Myrtle’s bathroom, when Malfoy was desperate and scared and Harry had almost killed him, and that wasn’t something Harry
Just as Harry was thinking maybe nobody else would come in - it had been more than half an hour since the last customer had entered - a cold blast of wintery air hit him as the main door opened. He groaned quietly before casting a quick glance in that direction. Five people, three men and two women by the looks of it, all young. Harry wondered if they’d be trouble; if they wanted to be drunk by midnight, which a lot of people their age did, they’d have to drink a lot very quickly. The women were not dressed for the Winter weather in short cocktail dresses and heels with not even a cardigan between them. The men were a little better, with two of them carrying jackets and one wrapped up in a scarf and hat. Harry immediately designated that one as his favourite; he couldn’t stand people who prioritised fashion over practicality and this one seemed to have some sense to him.
He strolled along the street, looking for a familiar door. He hadn’t been paying much attention when he’d fled to the shop the first time, and that had been two years ago now, so he didn’t even know what the shop was called or what it sold. It was just pure chance Malfoy had been in that particular one: chance, destiny or his Malfoy radar drawing him there.
“We’re drunk, not blind,” Jason said bluntly. “And we’ve been eavesdropping on your intel-gathering sessions with his mates.”
Tentatively, Harry reached his hand out to rest it on top of Malfoy’s. Malfoy’s eyes darted down to their joined hands but didn’t push him away, instead licking his lips in anticipation. Harry let out a slow, controlled breath and tilted his head to the side as he went to close the gap between his mouth and Malfoy’s and-
The way he’d said ‘flatmate’ made Harry think Malfoy had wanted to say something else but stopped himself.
Harry cleared his throat. “Sorry, guys. Just seen someone I knew from school is all. Bit embarrassing.”
“Always,” he answered, putting the glass he was no longer pretending to clean down and resting his weight on his arms, his face close enough to Malfoy’s that he could see the way his eyelashes fluttered when he blinked.
Malfoy nodded, “That was a bit of a challenge. The sardines were easy, I just went to a muggle shop and got them, no questions asked. I mean, I got some odd looks, but that might’ve been my stunning good looks. Or the fact I went in robes.”
Honestly, Harry hadn’t thought about what happened to the Slytherins after the war or what effect it had had on them. The only person he had thought of in passing was the man in front of him, and by default his family, but after the trials even that had dimmed a bit. Harry had had bigger things to worry about, like the rebuilding of the wizarding world that had been left in ruins and what the hell to do with his life now his destiny was complete; the wellbeing of a few kids who had hated him and made his life miserable in school didn’t even cross his mind. He was embarrassed to think that way now; he shouldn’t have preached about acceptance and supporting each other in the long battle to repair the damage to their world and themselves when he was ignoring a quatre of the population.
Malfoy waved his hand dismissively and wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes, “It would explain some of the things they’ve been saying tonight. That’s all.”
“I will,” Harry said, “Two conversations with them both was enough to know it’s best to stay on their good side.”
Harry tried not to laugh. It wasn’t really a ‘big team’ game like Hermione seemed to think, but no doubt Ron had been chirping on about it for months and that’s where she got the idea. Of course, the truth didn’t matter because either way that would get to Ron. Screw crime and law and regulations, nobody kept the Canons from playing.
wanted to re-live. So for Malfoy to willingly let him in, at least a little, well, that was a gift better than any he’d received for his birthday.
The two of them stared at each other and for the second time that night it felt like the world around them didn’t exist. Harry was certain – and he thought Malfoy was too – that the two of them could be great together,
Harry sighed again and scanned the crowd, hoping he’d find someone he knew who wasn’t engaged in something interesting that he’d be interrupting and wondering if people would notice if he disappeared. Perhaps he could duck out before the speeches started or creep over to the function room’s side door that had nobody guarding it or make like he was going to see Luna and jump out the window.
I'm back! Sorry for the delay, I was on a trip and had no access to a computer. No Draco in this chapter but he will return in the next one - it was getting too long so I had to split it.
“No!” Harry yelled, holding his hand out as if that would stop the words spilling out of Gerald’s mouth.
article about the breakup of a celebrity couple, not to mention anything to do with ‘the destroyer of darkness and saviour of wizardkind,’” Malfoy said. Harry snickered. “Granger?”
“I don’t know whether to be offended you automatically assumed I was going around trying to commit murder or flattered you thought I was so magically capable I could pull that off. Either way. you must’ve thought a lot of me,” he said, sounding dazed.
“I was going to say quiet, but that’s gross. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it though; the company isn’t bad if you go at certain times and you get used to the taste.”
“Mostly uni. Me and Mike were flatmates, Felicity was on our course and Scar was in the archery club with us.” Harry’s eyes widened. The image of Scarlett in her heels and horribly bright dress armed with a dangerous weapon was a frankly terrifying one. “Draco we found lost in the library. He was looking for the supermarket and wandered onto campus accidentally. Poor lamb.”
Harry started in surprise at the direct question. Malfoy had never hidden his opinion, taking great joy in telling Harry exactly what he thought of him, but he thought he’d at least balk at asking something so personal about his school rival. Harry had never hidden his sexuality from people, but he didn’t go screaming it from the rooftops either.
“I don’t blame you. Draco is very easy on the eyes. Every part of him is mouth-watering, believe me. I’ve seen him without those well-fitting clothes on during a game of strip poker and my god. I used to think his clothes left little to the imagination but it was so much better than anything my imagination could conjure up. His legs seem to go on forever and his abs look like they were sculpted by the gods. His strong arms would be perfect for pinning you down whilst he fucked you and his cock-”
“A wackjob with too much imagination, too much evilness and too much free time,” Ron said grumpily before pausing. “You know what, I’m gonna firecall George and ask him if this was him.”
turned up to the church to light lanterns.” Harry sighed.  “I just want one day a year for me, to spend it quietly with the people I care about, is that too much to ask?”
“What’s that?” Harry asked curiously. Personally, he thought it wasn’t great the Ministry had been hit; it meant extra work for them and if
Turned out Felicity was too drunk to notice. She giggled and waved her hand at him, “Stop it! I mean it’s true, but we both know it’s not me you want to fuck over the nearest flat surface!” Her giggles stopped abruptly and she froze, seeming to realise something. Harry was slightly afraid when she squinted at him suspiciously, “What do you want?”
chronicling their relationship and predicting their future, complete with clandestine photographs. Plus, he and Malfoy weren’t close enough that Harry could just reach out and pull him to him. Not yet.
He blinked a couple of times before his attention was drawn to the owner of the fingers and he found the slightly concerned face of Seb.
The best birthday present he received that year he didn’t know about until the next morning when the
“Ten seconds until midnight!” Terry shouted from nearby. The crowd cheered and started counting down.
Roger raised a hand to calm him down, “I’m not saying you can’t work, but you’ve been a bit off the last hour.” Harry hung his head, ashamed Roger had noticed. “I don’t know what that guy did, but can you tell me you can shake it off immediately and return to your usual standard of work?”
Harry started laughing, and when Photo-Malfoy grinned at him he found he couldn’t stop, his laugh becoming louder and more uncontrollable. He bent over and started gasping for air as tears formed in his eyes. He thought he’d got himself under control but one glance at the paper had him starting all over again. He couldn’t remember the last time he laughed like that, where his stomach hurt and he couldn’t breathe, and the fact that it was because of Malfoy somehow made the situation even funnier.
Harry could understand everyone's perspective; it was the first of his birthdays after the war and they wanted to celebrate. Celebrate him, celebrate his victory, celebrate his life, celebrate that it was
The woman was watching him carefully when he returned his attention to her, having observed his silent conversation with Malfoy. There was something in her expression that worried Harry. It was the same look Hermione sported when she’d latched on to an idea and was determined to see it through.
“Those things have lethally sharp talons that can slice through human skin like a knife through butter! And their beaks! I saw that thing eat a ferret whole.”
Malfoy shook his head, “All they said was that you two had amicably decided to split up as you both had different wants in life.” He paused before raising his eyebrows knowingly, “It was strangely innocuous and brief for a
Harry‘s heart melted and warmth spread through his chest, and he found his own lips tugging up in response.
Malfoy regarded him with a look that was caught somewhere between curiosity, suspicion and worry. “Yes, I noticed you and my friends having some interesting-looking conversations. What did they say to you?”
. He put everything into that kiss: his passion, his desire, his want, his emotions, his hopes, his trust, his promise. His promise to Draco that he would fight for this and love him and make him happy and, with the enthusiasm Draco was responding with, Harry felt his promise being returned.
Harry groaned and put his head in his hands. Malfoy patted him on the shoulder again but this time it felt mocking.
Harry groaned and dropped his head onto the bar with a loud thunk. He heard the guys around him muttering their commiserations and Terry patted him on the shoulder in sympathy. It did little to make him feel better. Of
“Because it’s a depressing and unhygienic cesspool of a pub where criminals frequent and the butterbeer tastes like Filch’s armpit sweat and a cupboard full of expired potion’s ingredients mixed together?”
“I may, or may not, occasionally use a Scorify to clean the bar,” Harry said, “And I may, or may not, occasionally use a jelly-legs jinx on aggressive patrons.”
Malfoy tilted his head to the side as he considered him before nodding his head in a wordless signal for Harry to continue.
Harry flicked quickly back to the front page and his eyes darted around the photograph there, searching for anything that would prove his theory or screamed Malfoy. It took him less than ten seconds to find it, and he had to shake his head in amazement at the audacity of the blonde.
Harry didn’t know what to feel about that. Part of him was offended at the fashion assassination as he knew his clothes were way better than they were in school (they fit for a start) but the main part was screaming
They stared at each other for a moment, the intensity of Malfoy’s gaze making Harry slightly breathless and pulling him in. The excited chatter and drunken yells around him became muted and the world seemed to drop away. Instinctively, Harry leaned forward so he was closer to Malfoy and parted his lips.
Harry couldn’t suppress the little smile that graced his lips. He was oddly proud of Malfoy and extremely impressed. It couldn’t have been easy doing what he’d done, going out and acclimatising as well as he had to muggle life when he’d spent his childhood being raised to reject anything related to it. When Harry had been introduced to the Wizarding World, he’d at least had people there constantly to explain things to him and there were other kids coming from non-magical backgrounds who were as confused as he was, but Malfoy had nobody. Nobody to tell him how toasters worked, nobody to explain the currency, and nobody who could understand what he was going through, but he’d still come out on top. He’d done all that even with people doubting he could do it, and based on their conversation so far Harry was willing to bet he’d become a better person because of it.
He instinctively stiffened, his brain associating the signature colour with a certain school rival of his, and his head snapped towards the source.
Malfoy seemed to read that in his face. “Oh, don’t worry, Potter. They’re not gonna want to start their smuggling ring up again anytime soon. I made sure they were properly traumatised and also sent an anonymous tip to the DRCMC, so they’re all on a watchlist.” Harry relaxed.
“Oh?” Malfoy said, leaning forward so he was centimetres from Harry’s face. He looked up at Harry through his eyelashes, a smirk dancing on his lips and his tone dropping low. “Who’s going to tell them?”
, the little pub Harry worked at. Normally they’d have a few regulars who appeared every other night (if not all nights), a tonne of business people on Friday afternoons, and families out for dinner on Sunday nights but nothing to this magnitude and not a clientele this eclectic. Young people, old people, single people, couples, groups of friends,
A slow, creepy smile spread across Mike’s face and his eyes lit up the same way Ron’s did when he’d been offered food, only far more sinister. Harry realised he’d walked straight into a trap.
He wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality or any of his partners, but damn that was inappropriate. Luckily for him, Bruce seemed to know when to call it quits, grinned, ordered, and took his tray back to the table where him and Felicity immediately huddled together for a hushed conversation.
It was as painfully awkward as Harry feared, but he chalked it up as a success that they hadn’t started screaming at each other across the bar and hadn’t yet resorted to hexing each other in a pub full of muggles and thus break the Statute of Secrecy. Progress.
“No!” Harry said hurriedly and a tiny bit too loudly if the looks he was getting from the table nearest to them was anything to go by. “No,” he repeated quieter. The images that brought to mind were not something Harry wanted to think about. Malfoy and he had never and would never do that.
This round was the responsibility of one of the two women, specifically the one who’d originally outed Harry’s presence to Malfoy. She was pretty, he admitted reluctantly, with long legs exposed by her short black dress and a curvy figure. She also gave the impression that she was the sort of girl who’d knock your teeth out if you insulted her or her loved ones.
“It’s not like that,” Harry said hurriedly. At her raised eyebrow encouraging further explanation (a move that reminded him strangely of Hermione), he elaborated, “We went to school together. That’s all.”
”Do what, baby? You want me to suck your little dick?” I nod, growing impatient. “Then ask me nicely.”
"Mr Jospeh, I can go and get someone if you like. We can have an officer sit here to calm you, or we can call home if you like?" She seemed honest. I shrugged. "I'll go and get an officer," She smiled gently. "You can relax for now," She gestured to my feet. I removed them from the stirrups and laid back, trying not to close my eyes. Trying not to sense my body.
Draco didn't, pointing to the floor in front of where he sat. Harry sat down, scared of what might happen if he didn't, his legs crossed and his back to the sofa.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell.” He whispers in my ear, his hand momentarily landing on my hip. “Remember, I better not see you in here again.”
"So..." Harry picks up the conversation, "you want me to go?" He nods his head towards the paper. Draco scoffs, almost choking on his drink.
"Yes, I'm going to ask you. Every time. Until you feel comfortable with me touching you. And I'll do it for everything else. Because I'm not going to push you to do something that you're uncomfortable with. As for sex? It can. It can wait until you're ready. Our relationship was based on sex in the beginning but now?" I shook my head, unable to fully explain myself. "Harry, I care about you. So much. Hell, more than Scorp. Just don't tell him that. I don't want you to think the only reason I'm with you is because of sex."
“I’ll go and have these sent to the lab. You’ll be taken into questioning in a second. Unfortunately, even if you do know who the officer is, we still need the DNA evidence to be able to prosecute. But please know that it’s not because we’re trying to push you away. I’ll leave you alone now, I’m sure Officer Zabini can take you to the interview room.” With that, she took the evidence and left the room.
"Harder?" I nod. "Faster?" I nod again. Immediately he slams into me, no word of warning, and begins to fuck into me at a much quicker pace.
He explained how he finished school but didn’t go to University. How, at the end of school, he was lonely. Most of his friends had gone off to do their own thing and his father had passed. He worked as a barista, learning the ins and outs of the cafe business for a couple years, before going to Uni and earning a degree in business management. He worked throughout all of it, saving up moment where he could, eventually able to buy this place, which had just been an empty shell of a place at the time.
Draco could only watch Ginerva Weasley began interrogating Harry, her voice becoming louder with each question. Draco was glad they were the only people in the café, otherwise he'd have had to step in after question number three.
“Harry, if I had to go the rest of my life without sex so I could be with you, then I would. It’s as simple as that. Provided you want me with you, I’ll be there. For whatever you need.”
”My badass bottom, huh?” I sigh contently as he begins to press kisses on each scar on my chest, even the two that were supposed to be there. He deftly slips my belt off, making quick work of pulling my trousers down so I’m left in just my boxers. He sees the lump in my boxers and cocks an eyebrow at me.
When I went back downstairs, I had barely calmed down. Blaise was talking to the receptionist, and I dragged him to the side.
James was in Draco’s flat at the moment. When Draco had had shifts on previous days, the cat tended to head out too, which Draco was glad for. He knew that no one, not even a cat, would stay sane cooped up in his small flat.
“That’s one way to put it.” But Teddy isn’t a child. He’s not an adult either, but teenagers are smarter than they let on. I would know.
They didn’t awkwardly avoid each other in public anymore, though Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy had even noticed him those previous times. If they saw one another, they would nod or smile or occasionally, if one of them was feeling especially friendly, wave. Their conversations were sparse; probably the longest and most profound conversation they’d had was when Harry sidled up to Malfoy outside Quality Quidditch Supplies and talked about the features of the new Fireblaze Broomstick. It was difficult to talk about anything truly meaningful or revealing when they were both always with people, Harry with the Weasleys or Hermione or Ron – who always glared at Malfoy and muttered insults at him when they spotted him – and Malfoy with his parents or his friends from school. Every time Harry went to Diagon Alley his eyes were drawn to the little street he knew Malfoy’s shop was down, and more than once he’d considered just popping in to chat. Or, more likely, go in and pretend to buy something just so he could spy on Malfoy, which was his usual style.
“Yes, I’m aware of her skills,” Malfoy said, smiling at him reassuringly. There was no judgement in those eyes, nothing to indicate that Malfoy would spill his secrets to anyone nor laugh at him for them.
Malfoy raised a glass to Harry in a silent toast, the amber liquid reflecting an orange light onto his face, and raised an eyebrow. It was an expression Harry was well-acquainted with, a tamer version of the expression on his face whenever Malfoy had said something to anger him in school, waiting to see what Harry’s reaction would be and hoping it would be explosive. It was the look that demanded Harry do something, pay attention to him, but also one that said Malfoy didn’t think Harry would act on his feelings. Now it was the same thing: Malfoy was challenging him to react to him, but didn’t think he had the courage too.
Harry wanted to interrupt and to ask so many questions about Malfoy, the personification of a pure-blood Slytherin, going to a muggle shop and just
“But other people did just as much as I did! I don’t deserve all the credit for ending the war! I had no choice!”
Seb raised a finger at him and said sternly, “He’s right, Harry. This ain’t no way to celebrate New Year’s…working.”
“No, even in private you were all distant,” Harry said with a frown. “In the Gryffindor common room we’d play games with each other, study with each other, chat openly by the fireplace and help the other years. You sat quietly in your little groups and read silently.”
It was hard to tell with the flames distorting her face and ash swirling around her, but the look on her face appeared to be less than amused. She was in a bad mood, and if she was supposed to be working this morning, Harry had a good idea about why – and because of who - that was.
