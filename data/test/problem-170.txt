“That will be fine. I will arrange it. But you should get to bed now. It is getting late.” Dumbledore squeezed the boys shoulder before he continued down the hall towards his office.
“He has not come up yet. I gave him a quick look over at the arena after he finished. He has a few cuts and bruises, some minor burns. I told him he could go up to his common room and celebrate as long as he comes in sometime tonight for treatment.”
“But he’s okay?”
“For all of the horrible things I have said to you. I don’t mean any of them. I think you are a brilliant witch. The fact that your parents are muggles means nothing to me. I don’t enjoy saying the things I do.” He turned his face away from her and laid his cheek against his knees.
Draco stared at the ceiling of the hospital wing and wished he really could become invisible. Harry was sitting on the next bed over. Madam Pomfrey was busy fussing over his arm. Dumbledore was sitting in a chair next to the bed, his legs crossed, a serious look in his eyes. And Snape was standing at the end of the bed. Looking decidedly pissed off.
“I’ll try.”
“Breakfast on Wednesday I think.”
“I want to apologize. I shouldn’t have said what I said. I honestly thought you had been with someone else too.”
“I am.”
Draco turned his eyes away. “I have my reasons.”
Draco turned to look at Harry as he handed him a teacup. “Thanks.”
“He would never love me.”
“No. I found him running through the halls and brought him here. He was very upset. He told me what happened, Harry.”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. All I’ve felt today was the fear and worry.” He took the woman’s hand and gave her a pleading look. “Did he come in after? Was he hurt?”
“It took him longer then it should have to come back up.” Hermione took the boys hands and began to clean them gently. “I’m not good enough to heal this completely, you will need to go to Madam Pomfrey for that. But I can close them so they stop bleeding.” She took out her wand and did just that. Then she washed the blood from his face before returning the towel to the bathroom. She stood on the other side of the table from Draco, who was now sitting with his knees drawn to his chest, staring at the fire. “Harry asked me to come and make sure you were okay. To tell you that he’s fine and he will be here as soon as he can. There’s a party in our common room right now and he can’t get away.”
“Same as last week?”
Draco’s eyes filled with tears again. After the third time he had cut himself, Madam Pomfrey had figured out that every time he did, it was after a certain person had been injured or had a scrape with death. She confronted him with it. He had denied it, but in the end he had broken down and talked to her. She was the only one that knew. And she had sworn to him that she would never tell anyone. He trusted her. And in return, she took care of him whenever he went too far.
Draco clenched his jaw and stepped out of Harry’s arms. “I’ve never let anyone touch me. I’ve never wanted anyone but you to touch me.” His breath caught as he had a sudden visual of Harry’s body with other people hands touching him. Harry reached for him, his eyes confused. He backed up again. “I can’t do this right now. I’m sorry.”
“Any time I spend with you is special. It felt incredible to finally touch you. Did it not feel good for you?”
“Albus. The other boy is here. He is waiting in your office.”
“You are welcome, Harry. I only ask that if the two of you wish to do something other then talk you remember to clean up after yourselves.”
Draco watched as blood welled into the second path of the blade slicing into him.
“I am now.” Draco leaned in and pressed his lips to Harry’s. When hands roamed down his back he moaned softly and pressed his body harder against the other boys. His body stiffened instantly when Harry’s hands gripped his ass and pulled him even closer.
“I don’t feel well. It’s nothing.” But it wasn’t. His heart ached. His stomach was tired in knots. His body wanted to melt against the one he felt hovering so close to him. He wanted to turn his head and let the hand gently touching his hair touch his face, brush against his lips. But most of all, he wanted to open his mouth and say those three words he most wanted to say.
“I don’t want to be an awful person anymore. But I can’t be anything else or my life will be over. My father would rather see me dead then have a son he sees as tainted and weak.”
“Would that be acceptable to you, Draco? To meet with Harry more then once a week?”
“How often would you like to meet?”
He ran. He didn’t know where he was going. All he knew was that he needed to run. Tears streamed down his face as he turned another corner and ran up the stairs he came to. The need to scream was building inside of him. If he didn’t find a way to rid himself of this pain he was going to explode. He turned another corner and ran straight into Dumbledore’s arms.
“I’m not going to hurt you, Draco. But you’re bleeding.”
“It may seem like cutting yourself helps, but it only makes things worse. You cannot relieve one pain with another.”
“No. We shouldn’t be seen together.”
“A lot of people are rooting for you. You have your friends to help you prepare.”
“Draco. Look at me, please.” When the boy didn’t move, Harry set his tea down and placed his hand on Draco’s head. He was trembling. A fine vibration was running through his entire body. “Please tell me what’s wrong.”
“I’m fine. What did you want to talk to me about?” Draco took another sip of his tea and then set it down to refill the cup. He refilled Harry’s as well and handed it to him when he sat back.
“I don’t like this, Albus. That Malfoy boy is bad through and through. You know how his father is. And that boy is just like his father.” Minerva stood and clasped her hands in front of her.
A knock on the door brought Dumbledore’s head up. The door opened and Harry stepped into the office. He walked quickly to the desk and stopped in front of the polished wood. He wrung his shirt in his hands. “I can’t find him. He just ran off. He was so upset. What if he hurts himself?”
Closing his eyes, he couldn’t get the sight of his body out of his mind. Even with the wounds, Draco could clearly see the strength in him. The muscles of his arms. The long lean lines of his body. Draco took a deep breath and shivered at the memory of the way the muscles in his back had moved when he had turned slightly to look over his shoulder at Madam Pomfrey.
“Who told you?” Draco grit his teeth. Whoever it was that had told him, he would kill that person.
Harry sighed in relief and sat down in the chair Minerva had been sitting in. “She said that he’s okay. But she wouldn’t tell me how she knew. Just told me to come here. Did he hurt himself?”
“Because I am supposed to hate you.” Draco stopped in front of the windows again and laid his head against the cool glass.
“She told you?”
“If you took better care of yourself there would be no need to go there.” He shrugged when Draco gave him an annoyed look. “I’m only saying what you know is true. Did you eat today?”
“Let me see.” Harry grabbed his arm and pushed up his sleeve.
“You won’t tell him? About my hands?” He sat when she turned him and pushed him to sit on the couch.
“How could Dumbledore have protected him if that dragon had bit his head off? The rules of the tournament state that no one can step in, even if a contestant has a life threatening injury.” He looked at her again and she could see the pain clear in his eyes. “How could he have saved him?”
“Fat lot of good it will do. People will still hate me. I caught a glimpse of Malfoy as I was leaving the arena. He looked shocked and pissed off that the dragon didn’t kill me. I bet he would have loved that. Seeing me torn to shreds.”
“It’s okay. Dumbledore said we could use the room as long as we clean up after ourselves.” He bent back down to continue only to have Draco roll out from under him and stand up. He had his hands held in front of him to hide his arousal. “What’s wrong?”
Harry quickly backed off and smiled at Ron, rubbing the back of his neck, “hey mate.”
“Don’t be daft, there’s nothing to apologise for,” he looked away from Draco’s curious stare and coughed, “besides… I, uhh– gotusedtoit.”

Harry trailed off, but Draco’s grip tightening in his let him find his words. If anything, it gave him the courage to carry on.
“Shut up,” Harry interrupts, hating how small Draco starts to appear. Before he can shrink into himself further, he pulls Draco back. “I’m sure we can work something out. Don’t give up before you’ve even tried. I thought you were better than that. You should have seen your way wasn’t working out, you should’ve tried every avenue and conclude that your mission was pointless. Voldemort is afraid of Dumbledore. Why would he task you with this? He knows you’re going to kill yourself trying, or die not doing it. Why not pull the rug from beneath him and defy him when he least expects it?”
Harry looked to Hermione who had covered her eyes but was smiling. Ron was predictably gaping, but upon noticing Harry’s stare simply shrugged. Leaving it to Harry to decide. He gulped and started to make his way across the circle, crawling toward Draco. Cheers from the majority of the circle faded into the background as Harry stared into Draco’s eyes.
, his mind would say. Some days it would be sour sweets, like the flying saucers, other days he’d want a Freddo. But Harry was smart. He didn’t spend it; didn’t waste it. He could wait, until he had more and more and more!
It was only when he accidentally dropped one face down, that he realised there was writing at the back. Harry grabbed the picture and pulled it closer to his face.
Mark looked back at the table, they still weren’t talking to each other. “I’m not exactly sure, but the blond and the curly-haired man appear to be dating. They seem to have decided to come out to the other four during this meal.”
He headed back to the kitchen, jogging as the enticing smell was simply calling to him. He slipped a few times since he was only wearing socks. He could detect some hints of cinnamon, which meant one thing. French toast. Specifically
The next appointment was a few days later. Draco’s displays of affection were still frequent. When he realised how mean he had treated Harry, he was very apologetic. He upped his efforts in his displays of affection, much to the amusement of everyone in the common room. However, their laughter was cut short when Draco shouted at them to go away. His anger had returned and was triggered by everyone but Harry. Harry who was often greeted with a kiss on the cheek in the mornings and a hug before the separated at night.

Kreacher stepped behind him and asked him what he would like for lunch. Harry put his mug down and brushed some of the breadcrumbs away from his lips.
Draco continued to watch Potter, and when he noticed Potter leaving his table, Draco made his move. He quickly emptied his goblet – which may or may not have contained some liquid courage – and followed. He wouldn’t have plenty of chances like this. And while he felt brave enough, he had to seize the opportunity.
“Is Draco alive?” She asks him quietly.
Harry thinks back to the first day he brought Draco and Narcissa over. Kreacher practically falls on their feet, bowing, one step away from kissing their shoes. He wails, “Kreacher is happy Master Draco is in the Most Noble House of Black. Oh yes, he is. Mistress Narcissa too! Oh, hows wonderful it be’s to have true Blacks once again!”
Draco squinted at Harry as if to read his thoughts. He was probably trying to, so Harry avoided his eyes. “Well, from what I’ve seen, the two seem to have been interested in each other for a while. Why? Are they your next project? Good luck with that. I’ve tried myself, but Pansy’s mum has plans for her that don’t involve Blaise.”
- using or uttering few words when speaking
He walked off before Harry could continue.
Now that he has time to breathe, a memory springs in his mind. A promise. A promise that is so long ago, yet so precious he’s surprised he almost forgot about it. Almost.
Harry blinked at the excited man before him. A Malfoy showing him the hows and whys of the Muggle world? He was curious to know more. “Alright, sure.”
He finally found them and put them on. He checked the full length mirror in the corner of the room, making sure his hair wasn’t too unpresentable and proceeded to find where Harry was. He was either in the living room catching up on the morning news and answering owls, or in the kitchen having his morning coffee.
Confused, Harry slowly starts to stand as well. The field around them transforms to the familiar Kings Cross station.
Harry rubs his forehead against Draco’s neck, “there’s a prophecy…”
He started to pull away, but Draco wouldn’t have it. He grabbed Harry’s elbows and tugged him back, “don’t go too far away.”
They break apart, but can’t seem to stop themselves from giving each other quick pecks. Draco only stops when he can’t feel Harry’s lips, but instead his teeth. He opens his eyes and sees the most dazzling smile. He presses one final kiss to the corner of Harry’s mouth and backs away.
Despite his nonchalance, Draco could detect some insecurity behind his words.

“For the better part of a few months, I found myself paying attention to you. Not in the way I used to, but a new way. This foreign feeling crept slowly and before I knew it, I was unable to stop it. I found myself paying attention to the way you laughed. How your face lit up whenever you talked about something that excited you. I enjoyed that you would come to me to share something that amused you. I —” Draco had leaned onto Harry’s pillows and brought Harry toward him with their joined hands. His eyes were intense, but he made no move to stop Harry. Now that Harry found his words, he was loathed to stop, “—I couldn’t stop myself from checking every day if an aura was around you. I started to hate myself at the thought that should one appear around you… I wouldn’t say anything. I didn’t want to see you end up with someone who… well… wasn’t… me.” At the last word, Harry had found he couldn’t look at Draco.
Once more, the Fates allow him to live.
“I’ll eat my sock if it isn’t,” she replied assuredly.
, Draco thinks. He lets himself smile briefly at the funny thought, forgetting he has company. “I doubt I would require such help professor…”
“I knew if I followed the loud noises I’d find you.” A posh accent that only belonged to a blond Slytherin drew the attention of the five Gryffindors. He simply blinked at them, before taking a seat on one of the couches.
“I can’t tell you…”
“I like you too, you prat! And if we talked this out properly we could have fixed ourselves a whole load of pining!” Harry almost growled. He thought of the weeks they spent apart and how they could have spent it instead.
“Go set the table and call your Aunt and cousin in.”
“Harry…” Draco breaths, closing his eyes.
The eyes become limpid and turn to Harry, “yes. Exactly like the constellation. It’s from my mother’s side of the family. They have the tradition to name us after the stars.”
“I hate you.” Draco pants, his mug half empty. Most of the hot chocolate had spilt on the counter.
Cally was unaware of the history between Harry, and, who he could only presume to be, Malfoy. She merely laughed and nodded in agreement, “now he is very correct in that statement, Mr Potter. Of course, we at Floriform cater to every need, and I can understand if that changes things.”
“Morning.” Draco greets him, his smile beatific. He reaches for the cup next to Harry’s and casts a warming charm. He groans at the taste, “I knew I kept you for a reason.”
Harry’s eyes were drawn to the tiger lilies, bright and eyecatching. The girl seemed to notice and asked him if he’d like a bouquet of them. He shook his head and started to explain. “It’s my parents’ twenty-fifth anniversary, so I wanted to get something for them,” he said.
Harry’s wide eyes were drawn to Malfoy’s lips before he could help himself,  “oh, no, no. Nothing like that. I just blanked out.” He quickly looked back at the roses, hoping his cheeks didn’t mimic their colour. If they did he could use the excuse that they were just reflecting.
“Okay, okay! Yeesh.”

“Would you like to hear a Wizard marriage vow, by exchanging one with me?” He asked, opening the ring box to reveal a silver band. It was engraved to look like a daisy chain, only it was an alternating one of lilies and narcissi.
“Masters would be taking a while, I say,” he muttered, heading back to his hidey-hole.
Harry’s eyes widened, wondering if he really was that obvious.

“Ah ah ah Longbottom my boy, there is more to come for today’s festivities!” Seamus sat next to Neville and manhandled him into a chokehold. “I and my lovely assistant, Dean-oh, have come bearing gifts!
“Yes.”
Harry shifts slightly when he feels a wand poking his back. He remembers Malfoy’s wand in his back pocket and takes it out before handing it to Malfoy who gasps when he touches it.
“I thought you two were getting along–”
“What’s cooking, good looking?”
The two decant the potion into seven vials and move onto to brewing the antidote. Only, Harry thinks it’s too late for them to take it.

He didn’t want to believe it.
“Yeah yeah,” Harry replied.
Harry looked at him in interest, what could Flitwick possibly tell him?
, he thought. He patted Harry’s jaw as he  backed away and stood up, somewhat wobbly, and headed back to his seat.
“Good morning to you too, love.” Harry put his mug down and crossed the short distance to hug Draco.
It reminds Harry of the judgements against him. How people assumed he was bad because of things his aunt said to her gossiping neighbours.
This confuses Harry, he’s only seventeen. Surely seventeen years aren’t that long to an immortal being such as the angel before him.
Draco’s smile grew at that, and he made to stand. He placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder in an attempt to comfort, much like Harry had tried to do to him. “As weird as it sounds, yeah it makes me feel somewhat better. Thanks for letting me in on your secret. Hope the matchmaking becomes successful. Let me know if you need help with Pansy and Blaise, or other Slytherins. I know things about them that may help you.”
Apollo stands up and brushes the invisible dust away from his chiton. “Now, begs the question, what will you do?”
Draco, raising his free hand to play with Harry’s hair, twirling the curls between his fingers, laughs. “Mmm, yes. Imagine my surprise when it was actually the notes of a previous student  who had edited the Potion’s textbook.”

surrounding Ron, but it remained. It was just a week after his birthday, and it seemed like strange things were happening to him again. The longer Harry stared, the more vibrant the colour became. When Hermione finally returned from the kitchen, Harry gaped as the

. He didn’t know what controlled him, but he grazed his nose up and down Draco’s neck before pecking his jaw. His eyes were closed the whole time, and when he leaned back to stare at Draco, he was elated to see that he was breathing quite heavily.
“Great, come sit. Take out your notes, let’s start out with the basics as a warm up, and lead on from that.”
Harry stared at the glass for a few seconds, “I was told not to talk to strangers, or accept things from them.”
“I wonder if that’s how our wands work, with the interwoven magic! Oh! And our brooms! Think of all the spells woven into the different types of wood! Draco–” Harry looks up and his eyes widen at the dishevelled state Draco’s in. His tie has been loosened, and his eyes are glassy, lost in thought. Harry’s mouth dries at his obvious distress. “Draco?” He questions, straightening his posture. “Is there– is there anything wrong?”
Harry hums again, “right…”
Harry sighed, and started playing with Draco’s hair. He remembered seeing Pansy do it to him in the common room whenever he looked particularly glum. “Okay. That’s probably expected. Some people just can’t accept certain things, but they aren’t all people. I know for sure that Hermione’s forgiven you. Even Ron’s come around. If the three of us can forgive you, I’m sure others will follow.”
Draco and Hermione grin at each other.
“This century please.” Pansy drawled, giggling toward the end. She was definitely feeling the effects of the firewhisky.
This time the lady with a black pixie-cut interrupted him, “I think we have decided our food orders. I’ll have the Saumon Fumé, please.”
and he had no idea what to do. After careful reading of the book Hermione annotated for him, he knew that the glowing would continue until the person found their match. It was proven true as the glowing between Ron and Hermione had faded to a subtle pulsing regardless of whether they were apart or together.
“Oh yes,” Draco replies.
“Would I like to what?” Harry asked, finally looking up.
His cheerful peace and quiet seem to take a turn when Professor Slughorn notices Harry. He squeezes through the tables, making his way to Harry with an enthusiastic smile.
“I dare you to kiss someone –” Harry looked up at Terry, and was about to go for a forfeit before Terry raised his hand to catch his attention again, “I wasn’t finished, dearest Potter. I have a specific person in mind.” His fellow housemate, Michael, leaned in to whisper in Terry’s ear, a name which caused him to nod eagerly, “Malfoy! I dare you to kiss Malfoy!”
“I’ll just put this away then,” Flitwick said to the two boys. They hadn’t realised he was still in the room and closed the door after they left. Flitwick shook his head and smiled at the sight. He looked at the arrow and sighed. Hopefully, it would do more good than bad.
“Yes, Minerva, thank you.”
Harry sat back and sighed. “I have always felt drawn to you. I can’t explain why. Maybe something I saw in your eyes. Maybe just pure physical attraction. I don’t know. But after our conversation yesterday, I realized that you aren’t the nasty person you make yourself out to be. It’s merely a mask you wear to protect yourself. I also realized that if you didn’t like me at least a little bit, you wouldn’t have trusted me with that information.”
“Is there a reason you seem to be so fixated on Malfoy being the worst of those who dislike you?”
“The Headmaster wishes to see you.” Snape stopped and turned to look at the boy. “I wish you would tell me what is bothering you, Draco. You haven’t been yourself for the last week.”
“Yeah. I guess.”
“A few aches. The burns are bothering me a little now that the pain blocker you gave me is wearing off.”
“I hate saying those things to you most of all.” Draco spoke the words so softly Harry could barely hear them. He tightened his arms around his knees and pressed his face against his arm, trying to hide the tears that had begun to sting his eyes.
“Do you do this often, then?” Draco’s eyes turned to Harry when he spoke.
“What?” Draco looked down at his arm. There was blood seeping through his shirt. Which meant it was also seeping through the bandage he had wrapped around the fresh cuts he had made that afternoon.
“Yes. So you have said.” Harry sipped his tea and turned his eyes to the fire. “I won’t pry if you don’t want to talk about it. So what shall we talk about? Or should we study for the charms test we have on Friday? I brought my books.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“No. But you should. Hiding things isn’t healthy. Stay right there.” She went to the small bathroom that was off the sitting room and ran cool water over a hand towel. When she returned, Draco was staring at is hands.
“I have my reasons, okay? Stop asking me questions. I don’t want to talk anymore today.”
“Harry calm down. Draco is fine. He is asleep on my couch. Didn’t Minerva tell you?” Dumbledore sat forward and put his elbows on his desk.
“I can’t do this here. I don’t care if Dumbledore said we could. I can’t do this here.” His face flushed a bright red and he turned his back on Harry, picking up his shirt and pulling it back over his head.
“What do you care?”
Tucking the item into his pocket, he closed his trunk and left the room. He left the common room and wound through the hallways of the school until he came to an empty bathroom. He slipped inside, being sure no one was around to see him. He locked himself in a stall and knelt on the floor in front of the toilet.
“Yes.”
“The people you say those things to the most are Ron, Hermione, and myself. I trust my friends with my life, Draco. If you let me tell them about us, and about the real you, they will want to help. You can continue to act the way you do and turn your hostility on us. I know you don’t mean those things, and if Ron and Hermione are let in on our secret, they will know too. And they will help me keep you safe.”
Harry gently stroked Draco’s back as he clung to him, his body shaking. “I’m okay. I’m here.”
“Shh.” Dumbledore rocked the boy in his arms and felt a tear slide down his own face. He felt the boy’s pain. He had ran from his office as soon as the painting he had watching the boys came and reported what had happened. He had known Draco would run, and would likely have hurt himself if he hadn’t found him. Draco’s struggling calmed and he started to sob. Dumbledore stood with the boy in his arms and turned back towards his office. “It will be alright, Draco. I promise you.”
“That is enough. Go upstairs. He’s waiting for you. Though I wouldn’t expect a warm reception. He’s still very upset.”
“That is wonderful, Draco. Now tell me what has you so upset.”
“You lied to me. I asked you if you had been hurting yourself and you lied right to my face.”
Now he sat alone in his common room, his knees pulled up to his chest, watching the fire. His friends were across the room playing a game. They had asked him to join, but his mind was elsewhere. For the past week he had been swimming in a haze of fear, worry, and pain. And to top it off, Dumbledore’s order had him nervous.
Snape nodded and turned to continue down the hall. He took Draco to a small, empty sitting room on the third floor of the castle. Draco looked around the room. There were two small sitting areas, each made up of a couch and a chair set around a short table, and there were two chairs in front of a fireplace. The furniture was done in shades of green and gray, much like some of the furniture in the Slytherin common room. The walls were the typical stone of the castle. One wall had three large windows looking out over the forest. He had never been in the room before. “Wait here. The Headmaster will join you shortly.”
“Would that be so bad? At least the company is good.” Draco looked over when Harry set his plate down and put his hands on his shoulders. “What?”
“The burns aren’t too bad. The one I saw on your back earlier looked like it was going to blister though. Take off your shirt so I can heal you up.”
Harry gritted his teeth. “Don’t say that word. It’s foul. Hermione is not a mudblood.”
“Have you tried talking to him when he is alone?”
“Indeed. And therein lies your problem. Emotional pain can build up when one doesn’t have an outlet. For most, their outlet is to talk about their pain, to seek assistance. But for you, you let the pain built up until it boils over and the only way you know to ease your suffering it to hurt yourself.”
“Maybe you should try talking to him.”
Draco dropped the blade to the floor. Watched as the silver disappeared into the pool of red. He swayed as his vision turned black.
“It is expected of me. I don’t do it because I want to. But if I didn’t, it would get back to my father. I would rather look like an idiot here at school then have to face my father’s wrath.”
Harry blinked at the cup Draco handed him. It was completely unlike him. “Thank you.” He sat and watched Draco for a moment, wondering what was wrong with him. “There are some questions I have wanted to ask you. But I’ve never found a time to ask them.”
Dumbledore looked over his shoulder to be sure Professor McGonagall had left before turning his attention back to the boys. “I have been hearing increasingly distressing rumors concerning the hostility the two of you seem to have for one another. I have asked you both here in the hopes that the two of you could possibly talk things over and come to an agreement.”
“You need to sleep and let your mind rest. Tomorrow, you will be calmer. And we will talk more.”
“I am. I think he needs someone to talk to that isn’t a Slytherin. He seems to be in a lot of pain.”
“You’re father expects you to hate someone for no reason?”
“No. Don’t.” Draco tried to pull his arm back but Harry held his wrist in a tight grip and he felt too weak to pull away.
Draco sighed and eased down to sit on the wide windowsill. “What if it doesn’t help? What if what he says only makes things worse?”
“No, Malfoy. But I would like to be your friend. If you will let me. And friends take care of each other. I’m worried about you.”
“It wasn’t his fault. And I didn’t say I was with other guys. All three of them were girls.”
Draco closed his eyes as tears spilled hot over his cheeks.
“It could help. Can we talk about it later? I’m tired.” Draco rolled over, putting his back to Dumbledore and Harry.
“You have but to try. Get some sleep, Draco. If you need anything, Madam Pomfrey is in her quarters. Just knock on her door.”
Harry’s blush had been growing deeper as Dumbledore talked. He swallowed hard and nodded. “Okay. Thank you.” He turned and continued up the stairs. Stopping in front of the closed door, he took a deep breath and tried to steady himself.
And now he was so worried about him that he was making himself sick. He thought the year before, their third year at Hogwart’s, had been bad. When Sirius Black had escaped and it was rumored he was after him, Draco spent most of the year with a need to take potions to make himself sleep.
“Not for lack of trying. Every time I find him while I am alone, his friends are always there.”
“Your belongings and mail are being searched regularly for a reason, Draco. You cannot keep doing this to yourself. Why did you do it this time?”
Draco blinked his eyes open when he heard the rustling of fabric that signaled him taking off his shirt. He rolled over as quietly as he could and pulled the fabric of the privacy screen back just enough for him to look through with one eye. The nurse had been wise enough to take the candle that had been at his bedside with her when she walked away. She had known that he would need to see him. Without the light, his shadow wouldn’t be cast on the screen and give him away.
Draco looked up at her and she could see the pleading and the fear in his eyes. “Is he okay? Was he hurt?”
Draco pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them. “Sometimes. I don’t want to talk about that.”
Draco swallowed hard. “Like what?”
Draco jumped when someone put a hand on his shoulder. He looked up to see Snape standing over him. “A moment of your time, Draco.” The man removed his hand and moved to the door leading out of the common room.
Harry moved toward the stairs and stopped with his hand on the railing. “Thank you, Professor.”
“There are different kinds of pain.” Draco looked away from Harry and laid his cheek against his knees. “If I don’t do it, my father will beat me. When I do say those things, I hurt myself. Because I don’t want to say them. And I know I cause others pain when I do.”
“Then why do you say the things you do.”
Draco looked over to see Harry holding his hand out to him. He took the hand, feeling his stomach twitch nervously at the fact the he was touching him. When Harry took his hand back, Draco dropped his into his lap and slumped back into the couch. “No. I don’t share his beliefs. While she may be a bit annoying, Hermione is a brilliant witch. The fact that she is a mud…” Draco closed his eyes and shook his head. “I’m sorry. The fact that she is muggle born doesn’t effect her magic. I have nothing against muggle borns. If they can do magic, they should be welcome. But that isn’t the way my family thinks.”
Draco shivered again and trailed his hand down his body, under the waistband of his pants, to take himself in his hand. Ever since the first time he touched himself, it had always been him on his mind. His body lying before him. His face looking down at him or up at him. His hands on his body. His lips against his. His warm skin against his own.
“How did you hurt yourself?” Harry pulled off the bandage and hissed at the three straight lines across the inside of Draco’s forearm. He looked up into the boys blue eyes to find them shiny with unshed tears. “Did you do this to yourself?”
Draco gritted his teeth. “In my trunk. Hidden under a flap of material in the lid.”
“Now, now, Draco. Your father would do no such thing. If you want to prevent your father from knowing, you need to stop this self destructive behavior. You need to find another outlet for your pain.”
Harry slid his hand around to Draco’s forehead and frowned. “You have a fever. How long have you felt sick?”
“I’ve always been so mean to you, Harry. How can you be doing this to me now? Is it payback? For everything I’ve done?” He closed his eyes and leaned his body away from his. “If it is, I’ll understand.”
The boy frowned. “I am?” He raised a hand to his face and Hermione grabbed his wrist. He looked up at her. “Where am I bleeding?”
“I don’t want to go back to my dormitory.”
“You can’t always tell what people will think when seeing someone they know in such a dangerous situation. Even if they don’t seem to care for them much.”
“Alone? You’re going to leave me alone with him?”
“He told me he loves me.”
“Of course it did.” He took a deep breath and stared out at the dark forest. “I don’t think I’m ready. I love you. And I want you so badly my body aches. But I don’t think I’m ready for that yet.”
Dumbledore nodded to the portrait and stood from his chair. “Wait here, Draco. I will send Harry up in a moment.”
“You can.” Dumbledore stood and patted the boy’s leg gently. “Within the next week, Draco. I want you to at least try to talk to him.”
Dumbledore caught the boy as he ran around the corner and pulled him against him as he sat against the wall. Draco struggled, trying to get away so he could run again. Dumbledore put his hand on the back of the boys head and pressed it to his chest. “Shh. It’s alright, Draco. Calm down.”
“As I have said, you can. You choose not to. From what Madam Pomfrey told me, he told her tonight that he wishes to speak to you. Try frequenting an area he does, alone, without your friends. Talk to him. Or, if you would prefer, I could arrange to have him go to somewhere at an appointed place and time so that you two could talk. You need to do this, Draco. I fear for your health and your sanity if you do not. Your cutting has been growing progressively worse.”
Draco turned to look out the window but could only see his reflection. “I love you, Harry. I have for a long time. I try not to. But I learned that it isn’t something I can just stop doing, no matter how hard I try.” He crossed his arms over his stomach and turned to move away from the other boy. “I’m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.”
Pushing his way past Crabbe and Goyle, Draco left the stands and started walking back to the castle. He was breathing very fast and his heart was pounding so hard it was painful. He needed to get away from it all before he passed out.
“How many others?”
Finally was all he could think as he made his way through the dark, deserted corridors. He pulled opened the door to the sitting room and locked it behind him. Draco looked up at him as he moved across the room and was in his arms a second later, having leapt from the couch.
“That will not be necessary. Go now, Severus. I will speak with you tomorrow.” Snape spun on his heel and stormed out of the hospital wing. Dumbledore turned to look at Harry. “Come sit over here beside Draco so that I can see you, Harry.”
“I love him. I don’t want to think about it anymore. I just want it all to go away.”
“Good. He will be joining us here in a few minutes. I want the two of you to have a conversation. Where things will go from there,” Dumbledore shrugged elegantly and leaned forward to refill his tea. “Well, no one can know for sure.”
“That is where you are wrong. But it is a conversation for another day. Please find Potter for me and give my message to Severus.”
“How can you help me? If I stop acting the way I do, my friends will think something is wrong with me. If I tell them the truth, they are likely to beat the shit out of me one night while I’m laying in bed. And on top of it all, my father will find out.”
“There could be no reason good enough to cut yourself.”
“Sometimes.”
“The things you say hurt me, Draco.” When the other boy tried to pull away at his words, he tightened his grip on him and kept him in place. “But I could always see the pain in your eyes when you said them. I doubt anyone else would notice. But I watch you sometimes. I’ve seen you happy. I’ve seen you angry. I’ve seen the look on your face when you are teasing your friends. But when you say hurtful things, your face may look happy, or smug, but the feeling doesn’t reach your eyes. It has both confused and intrigued me. But it hasn’t made me any less attracted to you.”
“Alright. But I hope you know what you are doing, Albus.” Minerva turned and left the office.
“I do want you. So much. It just hurts, Harry. The fact that they were girls helps make it a little easier to handle.” He felt tears filling his eyes again and leaned forward so that his face rested against their entwined hands. “I wanted so badly so be the first one whose hands touched you.”
“Why didn’t she let me die?”
“What was I supposed to say?”
“That will be all, Minerva. You may turn in for the evening if you wish. The three of us are going to share a spot of tea.” Dumbledore waved to the only seat available in the small area where they were sitting. The spot on the couch next to Draco. “Please, Harry, have a seat.” He poured a third cup of tea and handed it to Harry as he sat on the couch.
Draco paled and looked back at Dumbledore. “I can’t.”
He knew what the problem was. He was worried. No. He was way past worried. He had been worried before, but never to this extent. He couldn’t stand it. The thoughts that were running through his head made him physically sick. For more then one reason.
“Do you want to die, Mr. Malfoy?”
“He found me in the corridor and brought me here. He is free to leave anytime he wants to.” Draco pulled his arm away from Madam Pomfrey when she began rubbing salve into the cuts again. “Leave it. Please.”
Draco felt himself growing hard from the visual memory. He shifted his thoughts, turned it into fantasy. He pictured him lying in his bed, his body surrounded by the dark green velvet of his bedding. He was lying on his stomach in his mind. He was completely nude. He imagined himself running his hands over all of those beautiful muscles.
Draco shivered and felt himself grow instantly hard. He has spent so much time dreaming of what it would be like to have his hands on his body. But he had never imagined that he would be so forward. Draco frowned and pulled away again. “You’ve had other lovers, haven’t you?”
“And then what would you do? Where would you live? How would you make money? If you don’t finish your schooling, you couldn’t do magic. You would have to live among the muggles. Work a muggle job.”
There was a knock at the door and Professor McGonagall stuck her head in. She frowned when she saw Dumbledore sharing tea with Draco Malfoy. “Professor. You asked me to bring Potter down here for you.”
“One of the staff sitting rooms. Students aren’t normally allowed in here. But I thought it a comfortable place for this conversation. It is rarely used as it is a bit out of the way of most of the classrooms.”
“You don’t have to. You can sleep on my couch if you wish. I will be here all night if you need me.”
As she turned to go, she thought she heard a noise. She moved closer to the fireplace and saw Draco sitting in the corner of the room with his knees pulled to his chest. He looked up when she knelt in front of him and her heart clenched at the sight of him. His face was streaked with tears and blood.
The woman shook her head and removed her hand. “No one. I brought you here and cleaned you up. I send a house elf to the bathroom to clean up the blood. I put a salve on your arm to stop the bleeding since I know you don’t like it when I completely heal the cuts. I told Professor Snape that you came to me sick and that I am keeping you here overnight. Which I am. Along with the blood loss, you have a fever. Were you feeling ill before?”
“How about neither? How about I just run away and then I won’t have to deal with any of this anymore?”
Draco opened his eyes and turned to see Madam Pomfrey sitting in a chair beside his bed. “Why am I here?”
Harry stood and moved to the window. He took Draco’s hands in his. “I love you, Draco. I want to you be my first everything, too.”
Dumbledore nodded and turned the boy around. He led him to a large soft sofa and pushed him down to sit, taking a seat in a chair across from him. He waved his hand and a tea service appeared on the table, no doubt sent up by the house elves in the kitchen. “Let’s have a cup of tea while we talk.” He poured out two cups, added a drop of milk, and passed a cup and saucer to the boy. “Peppermint. Wonderful tea for a cool evening.” Dumbledore sat back in his chair and crossed his legs, balancing his saucer on his knee.
“Draco, this isn’t a problem we can fix right now. You aren’t a bad person, no matter what you say or do. I know it. Dumbledore knows it.”
“I won’t tell anyone, Malfoy. Anything said in this room will stay in this room.”
Draco frowned. “Why not?”
“How did your hour go? Did the two of you talk things over?”
Harry wormed his way through the crowd of people in the Gryffindor common room until he found Hermione. He pulled her aside and bent low to whisper into her ear. “I need to get out of here.”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows and sat back in his chair, folding his hands in his lap. “Well. That may change things. I thought you were gay. Since you seem to be in love with Draco.”
“Of course you do. You care very much. And that is your problem. Stop thinking of only your own pain and think about his in this situation. Do you think he enjoys that what he has done hurts you? He came here last night, very upset about what happened. We spoke. He explained things to me, things you need to hear.”
“Well I haven’t.” He turned to look back out the window. “I don’t want anyone else.”
“I don’t like hurting people, Harry.”
“Draco. Harming yourself in any way does not count. Refusing to eat is a form of harming yourself. You need to find something to do with your spare time.”
He hated that he loved him so much it hurt.
Draco nodded and watched her walk away. His stomach was twitching with nerves. What if he saw him? What if he finds out somehow that he was there? He didn’t want anyone to know about his cutting. Only Madam Pomfrey, Dumbledore, and Snape knew that he cut himself. And they had all kept it a secret while trying to figure out why he did it and help him to stop.
“Sometime today? Sometime in the last few days?”
“Lost.”
“I want you to be my first, Harry. My first everything. I have for a long time. And I wanted to be the same for you.”
Harry blushed and squirmed in his chair. “Three. I didn’t love any of them. I just had sex with them because I was lonely and they offered it.”
“Harry.” Draco skimmed his nails down Harry’s back as he pressed his lips to his ear. “Make love to me.”
Dumbledore smiled as the boy shifted and settled himself more firmly in his arms. He was 14, and to big to really be comfortable laying across someone’s lap. But Dumbledore could feel Draco’s need coming off of him in waves. He needed to be comforted. It was being offered by someone he trusted and he wasn’t going to leave that comfort until he was ready. Dumbledore didn’t mind.
“Yes. I did eat today. All three meals. No, I didn’t cut myself today. I didn’t harm myself in any way.” He put his feet on the floor and held the cup and saucer in his lap. “Though I did feel like it several times.”
“Where are we?”
“Harry told me. But I appreciate hearing it from you. I accept your apology. And Harry is right, Draco. I know you don’t mean the words you say. So they don’t bother me anymore. Harry loves you. So that means I want to see you safe as well.” When the boy’s shoulders started to shake again from crying, she opened the door and left him alone.
“Anytime, dear. You know where to find me.”
Harry blinked at him again. He actually apologized? “You don’t though, do you?”
“An hour a week should not effect that, Harry. Every Friday we will meet here at 8 in the evening. Neither of you need to tell anyone the reason behind your weekly appointments. If needed, I can make an excuse for you.” Dumbledore moved to the door and stopped in front of it to look back at the boys. “Your hour will start now.” He turned over an hourglass set on a table by the door and walked out. The sound of the lock turning echoed in the room.
Harry nodded and sat in the other chair facing the fire. “You look better. Did you get enough rest in the hospital?”
“I believe that you will find him to be a rather trusting person. Just tell him how you feel. Answer any question he may ask with truth.”
Draco turned and looked into Harry’s eyes. “You aren’t angry?”
“I don’t think I can do it.”
“You shouldn’t let your family effect how you are.”
He watched as Dumbledore walked away. Looking down at his arm, he was disappointed to see that the cuts he had made were nothing more then faint pink lines. He sighed and looked up at the ceiling. He was tired. His body still felt heavy. His eyes itched. He rolled onto his side and curled into a ball.
“I didn’t realize how badly I cut them.”
“Please. Don’t tell my father.” Draco’s eyes were panicked as he reached out and grabbed the sleeve of Dumbledore’s robe. “Please. He’d kill me if he knew.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco when panic filled his eyes. “We will figure something out.”
Harry turned at Dumbledore’s voice and let his hand fall away from the bird. “Is he okay?”
“No, Sir. Though I have wanted to.”
“What did you do to your hand?” Hermione pulled his hand to where she could see it in the firelight. His palm was ripped open in four long bloody lines. “Did you do this with your nails?”
“Who else knows?”
“We could meet more then once a week. We could…I dunno. Talk. Or study. As long as I have time to work on the next task for the tournament.” Harry shrugged when Dumbledore looked at him. “I don’t mind. We had a good conversation.”
“Oh, Draco. You should not let something so small cause you to be so upset. He loves you. That is all that should matter.”
“It ties into our conversation.”
He hated being so worried for someone he was supposed to hate.
Draco nodded and continued to stare at the fire. “Do you know when he will be here?”
“You know why.”
“It helps me. I know you don’t approve, but it makes the pain stop, even if it’s just for a little while.”
“His voice.” Draco closed his eyes and felt the tears threatening again. “I do want to hear his voice.”
“So why don’t you tell me?”
“He’s coming here? Now? But…”
“Okay.” He wanted to curl up on the couch, but he didn’t want to move. It had been so long since anyone had held him. His father had never held him. And his mother had stopped at the demand of his father when he had been three. It felt so good to just let someone comfort him.
Draco looked away from the woman. “I don’t know why I went there. I don’t remember even thinking about it.”
“What is going on, Albus? Potter just came to me practically hysterical. He said that Malfoy had run off and he was afraid he was going to hurt himself again. Since when has Malfoy ever hurt himself?”
“Why would it scare you? My dying would solve a bunch of your problems.” Harry picked up some of the napkins on the tea tray and pressed them to the wounds on Draco’s arm. They were slowly seeping blood. Not much, but it was still bleeding.
“I understand the need to make yourself as invisible as possible. My Aunt and Uncle have a habit of punishing me anytime they even see me. So I avoid them as often as I can. I don’t blame you for doing something you don’t want to so you can avoid being hurt.”
“You physically harm yourself because you don’t like the things you say to people?”
Dumbledore sighed and settled into the chair behind his desk. “Draco has been cutting himself for sometime now. Only I, Madam Pomfrey, and Severus know of this.” He waved his hand and pinched the bridge of his nose. “And Potter. But only because he brought Draco to the hospital wing after he almost passed out from fever, hunger, and blood loss after the last time it happened.”
“Why did you want to hurt yourself?”
“Know what?” Harry stood and moved to stand in front of him at the window.
Draco heard him sigh and he dug harder into the cuts. “I know. I’m trying.”
“Does not eating count?”
Draco moaned softly and opened his legs so Harry’s body could fit into his. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders as his hands traveled down his sides until his fingers could find their way under his shirt. Gasping, Draco arched his back as Harry’s hands ran up the bare skin of his body to pull his shirt off over his head.
“Are you going to just stand there and stare at me?” Draco turned his head and looked at Harry. He looked like he hadn’t slept all night. There were dark circles under his eyes and his clothes were rumpled, like he had slept in them and hadn’t bothered to change his clothes that morning.
“I had to. I haven’t been able to think straight since I watched that dragon almost kill you. It scared me. I don’t do well with fear.”
“May I ask what this is about, Professor?”
She frowned but nodded her head. “Okay. Fine. Where is he?”
“Yes, you do. And you need to hear what he has to say. It’s important, Draco. I believe that once you hear him out, it will help you work through this.”
“I want to apologize to you, for the things I say. I don’t mean them. I don’t wish you any harm. I wouldn’t say them if I had a choice. You don’t know how bad my father can be when he is angry.”
“I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to be in this tournament. I didn’t put my name in the goblet. How can they force me to compete when I didn’t enter and didn’t want to?”
“I want to die.” Draco pulled his head out of Dumbledore’s grip and laid it against the man’s shoulder again. “I just want the pain to stop.”
“You said he did this last week. It was just after the dragon, wasn’t it?” When Dumbledore nodded he asked, “How bad was it?”
“I can tell. Just lean on me. I’ll get you there.”
“He was saving himself for the one he loves.”
“There is always another alternative.” He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Draco’s.
“It was the single most frightening experience of my life. I thought for sure that dragon was going to tear me apart and pick its teeth with my bones.”
“But why? I’ve haven’t done anything but be mean to you since the day we met. Why would you want to kiss me?”
“The windows are spelled. You cannot open them or break them. So you can stop that line of thinking right now. Hurting yourself will solve nothing. Harry loves you. If you hurt yourself, how do you think it will make him feel?”
When Monday evening came around, Draco was curled up in a chair in front of the fire place of the sitting room. Dumbledore had come and gone to make sure Draco was there and to have tea and snacks sent up for the boys. Draco had been waiting alone for twenty minutes before the door opened again and Harry walked in.
Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him over to the couch. He sat down and pulled Draco to sit with his back against him so he could wrap him in his arms. “Okay. Let’s think about this. You don’t want to say the things you do anymore because you don’t want to hurt anyone. But if you don’t say them, your friends will hate you and your father will find out and he will hurt you.”
For five minutes both of the boys simply sat and sipped their tea. Harry was concerned to see that Draco’s hand was still trembling and he looked paler then he had before. “Are you feeling alright, Malfoy? You look sick.”
“Yes, girls. Three of them. I had both boys and girls offer themselves to me. I couldn’t be with another guy if it wasn’t you. I went through a time where my attraction to you was eating me alive. All of my friends were going out with girls, and I didn’t want a girl. I wanted you. And I didn’t want to be any more different then I already am. Being gay makes me different in a way I didn’t want. It scared me. So I slept with them. I was trying to change myself. It didn’t work, Draco. I couldn’t even get hard without thinking about you. I couldn’t touch them unless it was you I was thinking about. After the third one, I gave up trying to change myself. It just wasn’t working. Nothing I did could make me stop thinking about you.”
Draco sat up in the bed and suddenly looked panicked. “He’s coming here? Tonight? Madam Pomfrey, you have to let me leave. You have to let me go back to my own room. I can’t be here if he’s coming here.”
“He has his reasons. Most of which he doesn’t share with me.” Draco turned and went back to sit down next to him. “You defeated the dark lord. You’re friends with mudbloods and disgraced wizard families. Take your pick.”
“Told me what?”
He turned to look into those soft green eyes. He wasn’t lying. Draco could see it there. “You don’t know then?”
Madam Pomfrey looked up as the door to the hospital wing opened. “There he is now. You just relax. I’ll have him sit a few beds away so you can hear him.”
“The truth. We cannot help you if you insist on hiding things and lying.” Snape turned around and pointed at Harry while his eyes were on Dumbledore. “What is he doing here?”
“That’s why I sent her.” He took Draco’s face in his hands and kissed him softly. “Are you okay?”
“I don’t want to study. I want a piece of that pumpkin bread.” Draco stood and moved to sit on the couch. He cut a slice of the pumpkin bread and was spreading butter on it when Harry sat on the couch next to him. “Do you want a piece?” Draco offered the plate to Harry and cut another slice for himself.
“Not quite. But along the same lines. I didn’t go as far this time.”
“I was attracted to you the first moment I saw you. In the robe shop. Do you remember?” When Draco nodded, he continued. “You were so confident of yourself. So strong. So in control. It’s what I wanted for myself at that time. To be stronger. And I saw that in you then. And on top of all that strength, you were beautiful.”
“He hurts you. Doesn’t he?”
“You can. You just need to relax. Really think about it. What is more important to you? The fact that he has been with someone else? Or the fact that he loves you and wants to be with you?”
Draco’s head shot up and he turned tear filled eyes to Harry. “Girls?”
“Yes it will. But it will heal the burns almost overnight. You should be feeling just fine by morning. Why don’t you tell me about your first task while I fix you up?”
“Sorry it took me so long. They decided to throw a party up there and I couldn’t get away till now. Hermione had to yell at everyone about how I needed to get the cuts and burns treated so they don’t scar. She can be quite forceful when she sets her mind to it.”
“Yes. That’s it exactly. You have things to say to me as well?”
Draco didn’t turn when he heard the door open. He sat in the same stop in the windowsill where he had been sitting when Dumbledore left. His heart was racing. He didn’t want to have the conversation that he knew was coming. But he also knew that Dumbledore was right. Nothing would change unless he heard what Harry had to say.
All of the color drained from Harry’s face and he slumped in the chair. “I told him I love him. I kissed him.” He sighed and put his hand over his face. “He asked me if I had been with someone else. I couldn’t lie to him.”
“Disappointed Potter didn’t drown. No point being here anymore.” The two snickered and one of them clapped him on the back. “You two stay. Tell me later what the scores were.”
“Then stop thinking.” Harry rolled out from under Draco until he was laying on top of him. He leaned forward and pressed their lips together in a breath stealing kiss.
“Alright. So Malfoy has problems. Why is Potter so hysterical and why were you up there rocking Malfoy like he was a child?”
“No. I have no idea what to say. And yet I want to say so many things. I don’t know what I could say that he will believe. What would possibly make him trust anything I say?”
“Okay. Okay. I believe you. Calm down.” She suddenly felt something like panic well in herself. This was not the Draco she knew. Harry had told her about who the boy really was, but she wasn’t sure she believed it until now. “Come on. Come sit on the couch. I’ll do something with your hands so Harry doesn’t see them, okay?”
The man nodded and folded his hands in his lap. “I have had Madam Pomfrey close the wounds on your arm so that you can not reopen them again. I am also restricting your mail privileges for the next three months. Any package that is sent to you will be opened by myself or Professor Snape first to be sure you do not receive another blade with which to hurt yourself. Professor Snape will also be searching your belongings once a week during this period. If you are in pain, Draco, you may come and speak to me at any time. If I am not available, you can always speak with Madam Pomfrey. We only want to help you.”
“You aren’t going to die.” Dumbledore stopped in front of the statue that guarded the stairs to his office and muttered the password. As he climbed the stairs, he held the crying boy tightly and tried to think of what he could do to help him. He walked through his office and entered his private quarters. Students were never allowed in here, but Dumbledore knew he would be needing to give Draco a level of care that required a more personal setting. Dumbledore sat in his oversized stuffed rocking chair that faced the windows of his tower. It was his favorite spot. The windows looked out over a perfect view. The forest on the right, the lake on the left. He rocked with Draco in his arms as the boy continued to cry.
“I told you. Because I wanted to.”
He hated the mind numbing fear.
“So you haven’t eaten in over two days? No wonder you’re feeling ill.” She put a cool cloth over Draco’s forehead. “I want you to eat something. And I want you to stay here tonight so I can make sure you don’t get any sicker.”
Harry closed the door behind him and paused to turn the hourglass as Dumbledore had instructed. The lock clicked on the door as he set the hourglass down. Their required hour had begun. But Dumbledore had said that they could take all the time they wanted as long as they were in their own beds by morning.
“Yes, so I have heard. I am pleased that you are trying, at least.” Dumbledore took a sip of his tea and watched the boy closely. “Have you thought of what you will say to him?”
Draco’s eyes widened at the completely unexpected action. When those soft lips pressed harder against his own, Draco moaned softly and kissed him back. He had to be dreaming. Nothing this good ever happened to him.
Draco jumped when he heard him hiss in pain. “That stuff stings.”
Harry took Draco’s hands in his as he tried to move away. “Draco. I love you, too.”
Harry set his cup down again and leaned his elbows on his knees, looking at the floor. “What did I do to make you hate me so much?”
After about ten minutes, Draco was asleep. Dumbledore stood carefully and laid the boy on the couch on the other side of the room. Pulling the blanket off the back of the couch, he covered Draco and silently left the room and headed back into his office. Minerva had looked into the doorway of his sitting room while he had been rocking Draco to sleep. She had backed away when she saw that he was busy and he wasn’t surprised to see her sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk.
Dumbledore sat in his chair and watched Draco pace in front of the windows of his sitting room. He had calmed after sleeping, somewhat. He wasn’t crying anymore. But he was still upset. And right this moment he was very nervous.
“You shouldn’t do this to yourself, Draco. I know you worry for him. But Dumbledore wouldn’t let anything happen to him.”
“I know. I shouldn’t have done it. But at the time it happened, I was in a difficult place. I really needed someone, even if it was for a short time. After it was over, I realized that it wasn’t a one night thing I need, or even want. I wanted to be with the person I have been harboring feelings for, for over four years. I wanted Draco.”
Draco flips him off.
try it, darling.”
Scorpius looks away guiltily. “They know I have to do this.”
Harry grins nervously.
Ginny doesn’t let go of Draco for a long,
He’s not as angry as he used to be, but he’s not going to make it easy for them. A dreadfully awkward meal is the least they deserve.
“What?” he asks.
“Everything’s alright,” Harry echoes, nodding; they both still need reassurance, sometimes.
“I love you, too.” He says. Harry can’t look away from his eyes, everything he’s ever wanted mirrored in them; to grow up, to be happy, to have a job, to get married, to be happy, to have children, to raise a family, to love his husband, to be happy, to grow old with someone, to be happy, to do something with his life that wasn’t defined by his birth and the murder of his parents, to be

like him.
The letter lands Draco in the Headmistress’s office with a hurricane of teachers arguing over him and his parents being called to the school, along with a few aurors.
brother, if you think we’re not-” Ginny begins angrily, crossing her arms over her chest, but Hermione interrupts smoothly.
The wedding arrives surprisingly quickly, and the night before it he’s lying on top of Harry’s chest, with Harry’s hands gently running up and down his spine, when he mentions it.
So he’s been having wine for breakfast.
Draco’s heart tries to escape his ribs.
(See the end of the chapter for
.” She presses.
“Gentlemen.” McGonagall interrupts sharply. “On subject, please.”
“Yeah, sounds about right,” Harry says; he’d scared several hospital patients looking for Draco, and he really hopes they won’t throw them out for it.
“I’m not avoiding him.” She says evenly.
Harry’s just finished speaking to McGonagall about the Horocruxes, and he’d been telling Ron about how they have to go speak to someone named Dumbledore and the Elder wand – which Ron had believed a fairytale – and how Sprout was going to ask Draco to find two Horocruxes; at the mention of the name, he’d gotten the sad, far away look he’s currently wearing.
He knows his brother – and he
“I know.” He rubs a hand over his face tiredly. After a beat of silence, he looks at Hermione. “You’re oddly quiet.”
Draco swallows, tries to organize his thoughts.
this, needs Harry to agree, to take him along, to be with him even if they both die before next year. “I’m not some Muggle wife you can just leave behind when there’s a war.” he tries to blink the tears away, but a few of them slip down his cheeks. “I can’t – I
“All we’re saying is you like him, and he likes you, so you could go for it!” Pansy says. Before Draco can argue, she continues. “Anyway that’s not the most pressing matter right now. I was waiting for them to leave to tell you guys this. I asked my parents about the Malfoys.”
“The food here is just
“Okay,” Pansy says, still in that very calm tone of voice that is honestly giving Draco the creeps. “But she’s read it then?”
“The best,” Draco says, smiling up at him through long, pale lashes, and it’s not fair the way it makes Harry’s heart try to escape his ribs.
Harry – who’d stood the second he’d seen Draco walk into the room – opens his arms, and, a second later, Draco’s wrapped around him like he wants to disappear. He buries his face into his chest.
“I’m a Slytherin, not a Death eater-”
“We’re in the middle of a

about who I’m hanging out with-” Draco says hotly.
But that’s not going to happen, and if Harry has a chance – even the smallest chance – to give Draco a few more minutes to live, hours, days,
“So how do you know it
“You are.” Harry says. Draco’d mentioned it in passing, waving it away before Harry could comment on it, but he could tell it made him sadder than he let on. “You both are. He told me.”
“I – Gin would never-”
“What did it say?” he asks. “The spell?”
I knew from the moment I saw her,”
“Now,” he says calmly. “I believe you two kids belong at Hogwarts?”
“As if anything could.” They say.
“Lily Evans was going to be my wife. Even if she didn’t know it herself.”
And it isn’t; the fiery desire of justice is something they have in common, and Draco never believed it could be a bad thing. He won’t leave because he doesn’t think it fair that there’re people fighting a war when he’s
“Oh, it hurts, doesn’t it?” She says drily, arms crossed tightly.

“And that was crucial.” Harry agrees. “But-”
“Search all of this,” Dolohov sneers at him. “And find anything that looks out of place. If I’m not satisfied, you’ll regret it.”
and her Blood Purist husband, as in-laws. Delighting.
“The seventh years are here to help you if you’re struggling!” Lupin announces. “Most of it is the memory though, so you have to find the right one. Start practicing.”
“Definitely.” Blaise says. “Oh, and flirt with him. A lot.”
They’ve already floo’d McGonagall at Hogwarts so she can tell Ginny that both Draco and Luna are here, because she’s been worried sick about the both of them for months.
“Alright, alright!”
“Draco, Draco, shush,” Harry says soothingly, pulling Draco into him, wrapping his arms around him and feeling how frantic Draco’s breathing’s turned. “It’s alright. You don’t have to get pregnant. We could always just – adopt, you know? Or
“Okay,” he says.
“We’re not having sex.” Draco explains. He can’t possibly ignore how much his face is burning, but he feels like he needs to clear this up. “We
Professor Quirrell tries to kill Scorpius by the end of the year, and somehow, that’s not the biggest one of his professor problems. His biggest problem is that Professor Zabini, the Potions Master and the head of Slytherin, absolutely
He’ll get the Baron kicked out of Hogwarts if it’s the last thing he dos. The Grey Lady doesn’t deserve to be spending eternity like this, forever hidden away and avoiding a man who harmed her.
Soooooo i'm going back to school tomorrow, so if the updates get a little bt less regular don't worry babes.
“I – well. I’m being tortured every day.” He says. “
Their parents come back with chocolate bars after a few minutes, and their mom switches places with Bill, who begins pacing around with Fleur.
“Before the first wizarding War, Lucius and I were happy. My sister Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange, and he began to get mixed up with the Death Eaters. I thought… I thought it’d be fine, it’d be temporary, but it wasn’t.” Her lips purse unhappily. “Voldemort gained power, and your father only got more and more caught up in it. The first war broke out, and he became Voldemort’s right hand man.”
Draco and Hermione look at each other alarmed, and Draco begins to put the books back in their place with magic. Hermione does, too, and when they’re done, they both slip under the invisibility cloak.
, Harry!” Draco’s worked up now, on the verge of freaking out, and Harry honestly didn’t know how opposed Draco was to this. “I’d have to take time off work, and my body would change, and who would even-”
. They don’t talk too much about it, but Harry knows enough. Draco doesn’t feel like he belongs in either side, because many Aurors alienate him because of his past, and everything from his past was no longer an option the second he ran away, so he’s eternally stuck in a limbo he didn’t want and doesn’t belong in.
“They better.” Pansy says. “It’s been odd, Defense without you.”
“Well, would you look at the time!” She says, and Draco glares at her venomously. “Draco agreed to be my best man, so we’re off to do some bridal – wedding – planning – things.”
“I want you to think about it,” Draco says. “
“You’re lying.” He says, again.
“No one’s excited for school, ‘Mione.” Potter groans beside him, and Draco wishes to all gods his face wouldn’t get so red every single time Potter opens his mouth. By now, he wouldn’t be surprised if Potter thought pink was his actual skin tone.
“Thank you, professor.” He says sincerely.
“But I don’t
“What’s going on?” Fred asks, and their mother sighs and pinches her nose.
“Draco, I don’t think she has time for this-” Harry begins, but McGonagall shakes her head.
“It’s got to be a lie, right?” Draco says, chewing on his thumbnail. When his friends don’t respond, he gives them a sharp look. “
“Yes?” Blaise asks.
And now, with everything that’s been happening – since Draco disappeared from Hogsmeade and the rumor spread that it had been Death Eaters, people won’t come out of their house. Muggle attacks and wizard disappearances increased dramatically, and the Ministry’s not doing anything about it but denying it, and Harry’s nightmares, or visions, or whatever it is they are, have only been getting worse – he can’t seem to find the right moment to say anything like ‘
“Harry,” He says.

“When you two are done you can join us for breakfast.” Their mom calls out as she leaves the kitchen.
Luna nods.
“What?” Harry asks, surprised.
Malfoy’s stopped walking too, a few steps away from Draco. He can’t see a wand in sight or other Death Eaters, but he still feels in desperate disadvantage.
Though he knows it only affects him, and it isn’t really a way to prove how angry he is at the professor, he feels oddly satisfied with himself.

Draco’s eyes flash dangerously.

He’s in the nursery the first time Dobby starts a conversation. Draco’s been doing it because he’s terribly lonely, but Dobby had limited himself to answering Draco’s questions with short sentences.
“Harry?” He hears Hermione’s voice. “What’s going on? Are you alright?”
, that isn’t as far and untouchable as Harry is. Someone he doesn’t love as deeply and completely as he does him. Someone he could walk away from, if he needed to.
A reluctantly fond smile appears on Sprout’s face briefly, before she’s frowning at them again.
“What other boy?” Draco manages.
“Yes!” Blaise says. “Really, what was that even
“No.” Everyone, including Bill, says immediately.
Because they protected him at all costs, with their lives, because they knew what they wanted, and Scorpius doesn’t have the smallest clue.
Slowly, Draco comes into consciousness; Harry can feel his heart pounding through his skin, sees the way he’s taking frantic breaths.
“I’m here.” Luna’s voice is much closer now, and he can feel the heat of her body beside his. He shudders. He’s been so cold for so long. “I’m not your family, and I’m not Harry, but I can hold your hand if you want.”
Draco’s thrown on his knees in front of Harry, and Harry has half a mind to kill Bellatrix Lestrange for it and half to pull Draco into a hug because he’s
“I’ll hex her.” he warns.
okay?”
Draco shrugs again. Harry stands - much to Ophelia’s and Phillip’s dislike - and finishes his milkshake before walking over to Draco and wrapping an arm around his waist, pecking his lips.
But Snape’s found the memory of the first time Harry’d realized just how
The illusion dissolves around him, and Draco finds himself back in Hogsmeade, cold and alone.
“Maybe small ones.” Harry says. “Not big ones. I think he’d be very embarrassed.”
Calling Malfoy is definitely the more dangerous – and possibly stupider – of the two options, but Draco’s never been great at not doing stupid things.
“Harpy,” He says.
“I’ll figure that out later,” he clears his throat. “I’m going to take a shower.”
“Detention.” She says. They all groan. “All of you. You’re going to be planting trees for so long you’ll turn into one! Now back to bed, young men! All of you! And if I hear that any of you-” she glowers at Draco. “
“I don’t-” Draco begins, sounding pained. He shudders, and something like a sob escapes his mouth. “My head hurts so
“Is it? Zabini and Parkinson have been avoiding you? Your sister,” his lips curl around a sneer at the word. “Who you thought loved you found out and now she’s disgusted by you. And you want to know why they didn’t tell you?” Draco stops throwing hexes, only because the pounding in his head is getting too strong to think through. “Because they’re not your family. The only reason they adopted you was because they thought you were going to be a death eater. They didn’t want you, the ministry forced them to take you.”
He shuffles on his feet, insecure about where he stands. A hand reaches out to him, covering the view of his shoes that he found so fascinating. He knows those hands, the callouses from hard labour, how they feel against his skin. He takes the hand and looks up into the
“I’m almost scared to ask, but what are you doing?” he asked Potter.
Potter raised his eyebrow, “who’ve you got left?”
- French for ‘right?’/assurance.
Harry started to shake his head, “no that would be ridiculous. Besides I like—” his eyes widened and he lifted his hand to cover his mouth.
, he thinks to himself.
Harry can’t help himself from reaching out and wrapping his left arm around Draco’s waist. He willingly goes to Harry and accepts the kisses Harry plants all over his exposed neck and collar bone.
“I’m glad you’re happy. But what happens if you’re suddenly struck with a new emotion when you least expect it? Isn’t it better that you have everything back when you expect it? At least this way it’s in a controlled environment? I mean, it’s up to you. If it were me, I’d feel like I was lying to myself in a way…”
