"No problem! Maman will pick us up from the train station. Just let your relatives know. Oh, and we'll be going to Diagon alley for a bit of shopping!" she had a glint in her eyes that told Harry he was not going to like this trip.
She had been researching glamour spells all summer for this moment. Placing the strongest one she had found on herself. She made herself look like Harry Potter again. She made sure to sit in a compartment alone, not wanting to see anyone until she had to. Taking a deep breath, she tried not to think about what would happen when she got to Hogwarts.

He just wanted it all to stop. He knew it wouldn’t.

Once the students arrived at the academy, they were shown to the assembly hall to be paired up with a roommate. Harry was paired up with a French boy by the name of Luis Daniel.
“You came into your inheritance!” she responded confusion lacing her voice.
When the door had shut behind them, some of the girls burst out giggling. The group went off to talk with Snape in order to show him the memories. They hoped to get a shared common room with their own private rooms attached, just to spite Dumbledore. When they got to the dungeons they looked at Draco, ready to ask him where his head of house would be. However, when they turned they saw Snape glaring at them with a sneer on his face.

Those two weeks were the best of the year. They were the only weeks of the year that he could relax.
When his uncle had entered the room, it was clear he was furious. His face was turning red, and his fists were clenched. It was only 6 in the morning and his uncle had been asleep. The man rarely rose before eight. He was still in his pyjamas and was looking for the culprit. Turning his beady eyes on the boy he began to yell. Before either of them knew what he was doing, he had his right hand raised and he struck the boy across the face.
At about midnight, though he couldn't be sure, he got up and began to make his way through the castle. Coming to a holt in front of the entrance to Gryffindor tower, he began to scratch at the frame. He scratched once and waited, twice, waiting he scratched a third and final time when the door swung open to reveal Hermione. Almost sighing in relief he walked through the entrance and came to a stop in front of the fire. He could have cried in relief when he saw that other than Ron sat on the overstuffed armchair the common room was empty. Looking at his friend's fearful faces as Hermione looked at his nametag Harry decided to turn back.

She glanced between them, before her eyes widened and her mouth formed a perfect 'o' before turning into another smirk. The boys took longer to figure it out, but when they did they went through the same steps as Pansy.
Trigger warnings are both before and after the part and are in bold, so if you need them just scroll down to find the end. I'll try to post again on Monday, Enjoy!
Downstairs Lucius and Narcissa exchanged a knowing look before heading to bed. They were awoken in the early hours of the morning by a blood-curdling scream coming from across the manor. They got out of bed and ran across the hall to their son’s room. They tried the door handle and found the door locked, Draco still screaming inside.
I am so sorry that this chapter is shorter than the others, and that it has taken so long to come out. I have just been really busy.
Hadrian just chuckled softly and waited for Draco to get over his shock. “Wait, don’t basilisks grow to be 50ft long.” Sasha hissed a response.
While his Uncles back was turned Harry was looking for an escape, however, not knowing his Uncles plans, could not prepare for what was to come. When Vernon (Harry refused to think of him as anything other than Vernon as he knew what was to come) turned to face him, Harry tried to bolt for the door. Vernon grabbed the small teen and, once again, threw him on the bed, handcuffing him to it so he could not escape.
Harry turned around slowly to meet whoever it was that had called him, only to meet the eyes of Mad-Eye Moody. “Follow me. Your relatives are over here.” Harry looked over to the barrier, hoping to catch Draco’s eye, only to see him disappear through to the muggle world.
The effect was instant. Silence swept through the hall as everyone turned to look at them. When they began to move towards their tables the whispers broke out, Hadrian couldn’t even decipher what anyone was saying. It was all just a buzz of noise. Only when Dumbledore yelled for silence did they finally die down and come to a stop. “I want all of you to follow your Prefects back to your dormitories, except those who were late to the meal.” He said before gesturing to Hadrian to follow him into the room that he had gone into when his name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. He looked at his friends and family and nodded for them to follow him.
"This is Ember, she's a fox. By the way I didn't name her." He said glaring a Dean.
“I prefer your hair like it is.” The elf replied, turning away from the blonde. “Hurry up, we’ve got to go, we’re meeting the others in ten minutes.”

Christmas may have been the worst day he could remember from that year. Every single other student was bragging about what they thought they would get. When he awoke on Christmas morning, he chanced a glance to see if he had anything and found a grand total of 0 presents. Sighing, Harry rolled over and went back to sleep.
After telling Vernon, she awaited the backlash, but it never came. All he said was, “If you can bur the damn thing yourself and care for it, I don’t care.” She had been shocked by the response. Sitting in her bed that night she had an idea.
When the call ended Draco, with some trouble, gave the potion to the screaming boy. All that was left to do was wait.
All that Draco could feel was pain. He didn’t know what was wrong with him. He could hear someone screaming nearby. The pain slowly subsided and he could finally sleep again.
I wish to contact your twin,
“No Mi I’m fine.” Hadrian promised her.
"Well…"
Sat on the floor in his cupboard Harry cried to himself silently. Today had been horrible. Petunia had taken Dudley to an all-day playdate with one of her friends’ children. Vernon had taken this opportunity to beat Harry within an inch of his life. Everything hurt and, although it made it worse, he couldn’t stop crying. The digital clock Dudley had got for his birthday and didn’t want was sat on his old bedside table.
"I got caught, I don't know and I'm sorry, it just slipped my mind." Harry cut her off before she could finish.
"Who were you talking too?" Pansy asked, giving Draco the look that Hermione would give you when she wants a straight answer, and it's terrifying. Harry could tell that it was having the same result on Draco as it had on him. Just do what they say to keep at least a scrap of dignity intact.

August. He was aloud in his old room for one day, to collect all of his stuff. Harry knew what was going to happen seconds before it did. Vernon lunged at him, trapping him on the bed and winding him. When Harry got control of his senses again his uncl-
The next morning Harry awoke with a start. He looked around wondering where the fuck he was when he saw Malfoy on the bed. Then he realised.

"I would love too. Thank you for the invitation Sav." Harry said, relieved to not have to go to the Dursley's for another week.
” He asked the snakes.
"I was talking to Hunter?" Draco said, however it came out as a question.
The train ride was entertaining, they all talked about their pas years at Hogwarts. They also spoke about Christmas. Hadrian and his family were staying at Malfoy manor and Ginny was staying with James and Lily. Once they had shown the Weasleys the memories Molly was furious. She gave her daughter permission to go and stay with the Potters, while mumbling darkly about Dumbledore.
"That, is your familiar?" she asked, shocked.
He finished the apple just in time. The door was opened, and Harry was dragged out and up the stairs. Vernon had turned his old bedroom into his ‘office’. He would bring men up into the room to have their way with him. When they were done another would be brought in. by the end of the day, Harry was aching all over he would be thrown into his cupboard, and bread would be tossed in after him. This went on until his birthday.
We see what's going on in Draco's head after his confrontation with Harry.
“That’s true I suppose.” Harry agreed as he followed Fred out of his bedroom and back out to the lounge.
“Anyway what exactly did Harry’s invitation say then?” He asked casually whilst they ate.
The fact that Potter would be turning up at essentially his home anytime between five and seven did in fact unnerve him, why had he said anytime?! He hated that, he always liked to put a time on things but he could hardly take it back now.
He looked up to check Blaise wasn’t offended but Blaise nodded his head in acceptance indicating that Draco’s words were true. So Draco carried on.
“To you Draco.” She interrupted.
Before Harry could respond the stadium around them roared to life as the commentator started welcoming them and witches in dark green and gold robes started flying out from the tunnel to deafening cheers.
his Godfather as such, they weren’t really that close. Professor Snape didn’t get
“It was near the end, we’d had the leftovers boxed up and I said I would give them to you because it was your favorite restaurant and then he said that you were the reason he’d invited me out in the first place.” Daphne continued.
The desperation was getting real now and the kissing was abandoned as Harry’s breathing grew louder in Draco’s ear. Every now and then Harry would scrap his teeth alongside Draco’s neck and Draco could still feel his rough stubble. Draco was incredibly sensitive and feeling Harry all over him like his was setting his world alight even with their clothes on. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like without them but that thought alone was enough to send him over the edge.
Yes. He told himself. Fred and George would always welcome him no matter what and no judgement. Getting to his feet slowly he felt his legs shaking. He didn’t even know how long he’d been here now. He couldn’t walk across one of the busiest streets in wizarding Britain looking like this, even on a Sunday when it was quieter. He tried to think about his destination clearly and willed himself to feel strong enough to make it there.
Draco sighed and opened the bedroom door so that they could come in.
He loved the Weasleys but they were quite a loud family and that perhaps was another reason why Harry had never particularly invited them over, he thought it might be overwhelming to have them all here. At the Burrow it just seemed natural and they tended to all spill out into the large garden anyway. At his home he liked things to be fairly quiet but not completely silent. Draco fitted into that wonderfully. He had an elegant and delicate manner about him, he never trampled up and down the stairs or made a lot of noise in anything he did yet Harry could still hear him. He was quite talkative actually, more so than Harry had first thought yet he spoke softly and had periods of being quiet too.
“Yeah” Ron said slowly and nodded, letting Harry’s words sink in and willing himself to believe them.
“Right now though I really do need to go I’m afraid or I’ll be late.” Draco said standing up suddenly. “I’m already in danger of arriving after Daphne and I wanted to arrive at the same time as her so she’s never alone there.”
However these stories so hold a special place in my heart and I am proud of them. I want to finish them for my own satisfaction but also I want to finish them for all you lovely people who are still reading them and still commenting on them so thanks again, you all keep me going!
They met back again five minutes later in Harry’s study, as it had all the other notes from the book in and Draco’s was full of his business stuff, but it was Draco who sat at the desk quill in hand.
Harry and Draco start settling into their new routine, we find out if Harry's sleep is any better and they make progress with the book.
“Draco… please say something.” Harry’s voice came through his thoughts louder from beside him.
It was warmer in Harry’s house than in his horrible flat so he had simply slept in his boxers. He got up and put his grey silk dressing gown on that he placed on a hook on the back of his new bedroom door. The rest of his clothes had been neatly put away in the wardrobe but they only took up half the space in there. He crept to the bathroom not wanting to wake Harry in the room opposite.
“Don’t hate me Draco but I think it would do you both good to talk.” She said quietly.
“But?” Harry prompted.
Today’s task was to restock the potions in the shop that had sold in the last week and to keep his mind off the fact that he was going to see Potter tonight. He sighed and went down the stairs through the door on his right to the cellar. A day of brewing is exactly what he needed. The process always calmed him down and having a line of perfect vials sitting on his bench at the end of the day would definitely make him feel better.
“I can see that!” Harry laughed again and nodded. “And by the way I don’t think that all Slytherins are evil.” He said as a serious afterthought before finishing his starter and picking up his red wine again.
“We can apparate to the safe house from the boundary of the school grounds, Mr & Mrs Malfoy, follow me.” Williamson said before walking ahead to lead them through the remains of Great Hall and out the front of the school.
“Right then Potter! Let’s go!” He said with a cheeky smile before throwing the cloak over himself and holding onto Harry’s arm.
“I wasn’t that bad.” Harry muttered. Draco smiled at him again and Harry spoke up a bit more seriously after a second to process this information. “That must have been hard for you though, to deal with that with Lucius and everything else.”
“It’s going to hurt, do you think we should give him a pain potion or something?”
“Fair enough, it does make sense.” Harry said honestly. “It’s just strange that’s all. This whole thing is surreal, you’re just so… different. You don’t even look the same.”
The film started to play and Harry got settled next to him. Draco almost forgot to pay attention to the start of the film as he thought about what it would be like to snuggle into the raven headed man. He forced his mind back to the screen and they watched together. It was good, but he kept having a lot of questions. Fortunately Harry seemed to find them amusing rather than annoying.
“Yeah.” Blaise answered simply.
Came two familiar voices stepping into the kitchen.
“You agree not to involve my mother?”
“Of that I have no doubt.” Daphne said smiling. Then she went off silently to open up the shop.
“Malfoy Manor.” He spoke clearly before the green flames engulfed him.
He wasn’t really much of a jewellery man but on formal occasions he did wear the Potter ring that he’d discovered in his vault. When he’d asked Andromeda about it she said that the male head of the household usually wore their family crest ring on the smallest finger on their dominant hand. He wondered why his father had preferred to keep it in the vault rather than wear it but then it did seem a bit too poncy to wear daily. Tonight though he thought he’d wear it. He was going to a pureblood family home and although he didn’t know much about pureblood customs, part of him wanted to impress.
Harry frowned. “What did he say?”
Leo laughed at this which Draco found himself smiling at. Laughter wasn’t something he had heard much of these past few years, unless you counted the manic laughter of a psychopath. Leo didn’t reply straight away, he let Draco’s words sink in a bit, thinking them over before answering.
“Draco?! You here… did you make it in OK?” Came the slightly worried tone. Harry, Blaise and Daphne were all looking towards him without being able to actually see him.
“I’m really pleased for you man, you deserve it.” Harry said bouncing Rose up and down on his knee and making her giggle.
“And your father? “ Harry prompted delicately.
“Master Draco Black is in the fire calling for Master Harry? Kreacher is honoured to serve the noble house of Black. Kreacher will go fetch Master Harry for Master Draco. Master Draco be waiting there one moment.”
Now though he’d told Harry that he was gay and there was no getting that back. He wasn’t quite sure what made him say it but he had just wanted the other man to know. The worst thing was there hadn’t really been any reaction to it. Harry hadn’t seemed surprised but the match had started so it had distracted him and forced them to take their seats. Draco wanted to know how Harry felt about this piece of information. He knew Daphne would never have told him so the man couldn't have known, he might have guessed though he supposed.
I'll shut up now so you can enjoy!
To be honest the rest of my chapters are looking pretty long too... let me know if that's a bad thing! Still would love to hear your thoughts!
“You invited me out to talk about Draco?” She said clearly, slightly amused.
“I expect he’ll come round later and want to tell you the news, your mum will probably want to throw a party to celebrate too so let’s just let him have his moment.” Harry said.
“Ok.” Fred said, giving Harry’s forehead a quick kiss as he stood up to help George.
“Pinky shall inform Mistress that Master is awake and then Pinky will fetch Master Draco’s favourite sir.”
“Morning Draco” She replied, neither one asking how the other slept out of courtesy, both knowing they would not answer honestly. “I had wondered whether we could have an informal breakfast in here today. I know it’s unusual but you seemed pleased with the changes you’d made to your sitting room and I wanted to enjoy them for myself.”
“Erm, no, it’s not. I’m not going to write about before Hogwarts. I just highlighted the facts I guess…” Harry said a bit awkwardly like he did when he was anxious.
Daphne nodded. “Meet him as Pierre by all means but even if he does work out that it’s you I really don’t think he’ll care. I’m not sure why I know that but I just have a feeling.” She said with a twinkle in her eye.
“Yes.” His mother said slowly, her face set back to it’s calm demeanour. “With hindsight that does seem like a bit of an oversight. Perhaps that’s something you can correct when you have your own children Draco?” She said as her face returned to a bit of a smirk.
This here was his home, his home with Harry, and he’d never felt happier in his entire life than he did in this moment as Harry perched on the arm of his chair and kept his arm around him whilst Draco drank and chatted with his three favourite people in the world.
His mother tensed ever so slightly and looked a little taken aback but Draco could only see it because he knew her so well. “Very well, say what you need to say.” She replied coldly.
Then he turned to face the table too with one hand on Draco’s lower back. With the other he raised his glass. “To friends, family and freedom.” He said happily.
“I knew the second I saw this shop, Draco.” She said softly. “Daphne told you that I came to the shop a couple of weeks ago?”
Ron immediately straightened up and looked more serious. He always preferred to fool around but he took his job very seriously when it mattered. “What’s up mate, you OK?”
.” He said, giving her a bit of a look as if they were sharing a private joke. “Just make me whatever, you know what I like..” He said dismissively and started to walk away towards the small raised decked area to find a seat.
“Erm, you’re welcome” came the somewhat surprised reply.
“Well, yes.” Draco replied and he cupped the side of Harry’s face moving it gently so they could look into each other’s eyes once more. “And I like how it was you who put them there… I know it’s weird but I do.”
“Yeah, that was hard actually. I felt really alone those first few weeks.” Harry said sadly. “But I didn’t include that in the book, obviously, I know Ron still feels bad about it and Merlin knows we’ve all made mistakes. Jealousy has always been an issue for Ron but his loyalty makes up for it. Our relationship has definitely been strained at times and sometimes he really infuriates me but he’ll still always be my best friend.”
All he could think Sunday morning was whether it was too soon to floo call Draco. Draco had said he would be free later on today to work on the book together but that he needed to do some brewing first. They’d left it very loose just saying one of them would floo call and they’d meet up at some point. When they had this conversation last night it had seemed fine and a good thing to be flexible and carefree about their plans. Now thought Harry was very much regretting not getting some clarity. Should Harry be waiting for Draco to finish work and floo call him? Or would Draco be waiting for Harry to call?
She smiled at him and stood up. “If that’s all for today I’ll see you tomorrow?” She asked politely.
“You think I’m going to scare that easy?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
“I- well yes I kind of made it yesterday and Ron was obviously happy about it and no doubt told everyone…” He half rambled and then got back on the right train of thought. “But like I said, I haven’t signed a contract and it’s not too late to change my mind if you don’t think it’s the best thing for me, for- for us… you know, with my whole ‘hero-complex’ thing that you pointed out to me.”
“Oh, er, sorry, erm, no one told me or anything and I wasn’t trying to find out.” Harry stammered out nervously suddenly thinking he might have said something wrong. “It’s just in my house, erm, I live in the Black family home now, erm, if you didn’t know… anyway you’re on the family tapestry in the drawing room and er, well it’s magical I guess so it changed your name.”
“Well you’ve been a bit up and down... like the Friday before last when you came round after you got your eyesight fixed, well you looked really good and you seemed happy, possibly a bit excited and we thought maybe your new look might have been to impress someone… but then when you didn’t come here last week we were worried something might have happened, then on Friday you seemed really happy again, the happiest we’ve seen you in ages actually but you seemed quite distant and you kept checking your watch…” Hermione trailed off and Ron picked up the thought.
“Young master Malfoy, it is a pleasure for Pinky to be seeing you again” See said whilst bowing very low to him.
Harry wondered again if this was a good idea. He loved Hermione but once she got an idea in her head she did tend to become a bit obsessive and overbearing about it. It was one of the main reasons why Harry had stopped discussing her love life and he definitely didn’t want to tell her that it was him who funded the research of the department.
“Oh that’s good.” Harry said wondering why he suddenly felt a tiny surge of jealousy that the twins would see Draco again before he did. That’s weird.
“What would I do without you?!” Draco said in a joking way even thought the sentiment was entirely serious.
Fred had managed to sit through a meeting with Draco the previous evening and the twins were raving about the potion geniuses ideas all through dinner on Thursday. It all sounded very positive and it was helping Fred stay in a good mood. However his foot was still bandaged and George was insisting he took the rest of the week off which he was a bit grumpy about. It had worked out well though as George had advertised a new shopkeeper position on Monday and had an immediate response from someone who could start straight away. The shop had been a bit quiet and George had been able to spend Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday training him on the job.
Potential trigger warning for repressed memories.
At 10 o’clock he decided he couldn’t wait anymore. He went down to his office where the fireplace was enabled for floo calls and knelt down on the floor and threw some floo powder into the fire saying the address he’d been given. When the flames turned green he stuck his head into them.
As always please let me know what you think! It would just be nice to know if people are still reading this or not! Thanks!
“Yeah, just doing her N.E.W.T.S.” Graham mumbled not really offering anymore information than necessary whilst still being polite.
“Anyway,” Harry said after a pause. “As interesting as that was, we’re never going to make progress with this damn book if we keep getting distracted.” He pointed out.
“You could have given me a little bit more warning!” Daphne hissed straightening her black and gold robes she always wore now in her shopkeeper role. Draco had used his little bit of money from last week to have them specially commissioned for her with his logo on.
“Harry what’s wrong?” Draco asked him worriedly. “Do you not want this?”
He approached the table and slammed his hand down on the magazine forcing her to look up at him. Even Harry and Hopsy stopped what they were doing to look over.
It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to, of course he did, but now when faced with it as they continued up the long staircase, he was beginning to get a bit freaked out. He hadn’t had to please someone new like this in years. The first time with Fred they’d been drunk so he hadn’t really had to think about it. Really all the sex Harry had before then he’d been drunk for too, he could very much use a bottle of whiskey right now…
Teddy was really curled into him so Harry picked him up and continued to hug him as he stood up. He casually managed to shake off Miss Violet’s hand from his shoulder as he did so.
Apparently though Fred still hadn’t had enough as he said he was going out tonight even though he insisted it was mostly for George’s benefit. Fred said he wanted to get George laid but Harry was already betting that it would be Fred and not George waking up in someone else’s bed tomorrow. Fred was just much more confident than George. Even though it rarely showed, anyone who knew him really well knew George was ever so slightly quieter and more shy than his outgoing twin. Harry went back home to get ready for his rare evening out.
Blaise had stood up to take control of the situation. “Follow me.” He said and walked out the room first followed by Boot. Rogers waited for Daphne.
“OK, well if you’re sure.” Harry said, still slightly unconvinced but not wanting to press Draco about it.
“It’s not the sort of thing one usually asks.” Draco replied.
“I still haven’t made up my mind to be honest.” She replied after some consideration. “I am still rather fond of the grounds and it is a beautiful part of the country. However, the Manor will never be mine, it is the epitome of the Malfoy name and I’m afraid it doesn’t have good memories for me anymore, not really.”
“Well I suppose we can start with your plan for the afternoon and then think about the rest later!” Fred said with a cheeky grin as he slid his hand under Harry’s shirt and along the bare skin of his back.
Harry shrugged. “You were right though, I am a pathetic mess who drinks too much. I already knew it really... I just never had it pointed out to me like that from someone… someone I care about.” He added the last part after a slight pause but looked straight in Draco’s eyes as he said it.
The thought scared him more than he dared to admit. He felt vulnerable without the comfort of money. Money was powerful, it could pretty much get you anything you needed as long as you knew where to go. This was a very different life than the one his father led, the one his father had groomed him for. That was a good thing though, Draco reminded himself. He would work hard, he would get the money back on his investment into the business. He would fill his own vault in time, in his way, an honourable hardworking way.
“Great! You OK if I borrow one of these owls after I get the deliveries done to send Daphne a note? Hopefully she can persuade Draco.” Harry said after he finished his sandwich.
The cynical part of his brain was telling him that if she was here she’d be moaning that it was too hot or that she was bored. She wasn’t very good at sitting still for long. Harry had planned lots of activities for the rest of the honeymoon to keep them busy but he thought it would be nice for the first day to do nothing for once. He never had the opportunity to do nothing and he really thought that some rest and relaxation would be welcome for them both after all the pre-wedding stress.
“I’m happy I said yes.” Draco said wrapping his arms back around Harry’s waist. “Now it really can be our room, knowing you’ve never slept it in either, it feels nice.”
Draco thought about the best way to respond to this for a moment hoping he would get the right words.
“Good one man, I haven’t laughed that hard in ages.” He said after a while as his laughter subsided. He hadn’t seemed to notice the moment where Harry leaned down onto the table and rested his head on it with a slight thud.
“I’m proud of you Harry and everything you’ve done.” Draco said, staring into his eyes.
Harry trailed off and then suddenly he turned his face away and screwed his eyes up. Draco looked at him and he looked like he was trying not to cry.
Halfway through, Draco decided he may as well make himself comfortable too as it was hot and his romper was quite fitted. There was a time and a place for fitted clothing but mostly Draco preferred his clothes baggy. You could still look sexy in baggy clothing and be comfortable, it was an artform that he thought he’d mastered. If Harry was comfortable going topless than Draco certainly was and it really was hot even with the air-conditioning. So he just slipped on a pair of white and black striped linen shorts with a comfortable drawstring waist and settled back down next to Harry.
“Me too.” Draco said kissing him on the forehead. “Did you talk to Mr. Weasley and Bill about the book?”
Potter carried on his speech undeterred.
Somehow he thought that things were working out for the best. Was that crazy to think? And were they just supposed to be friends or could they be more than that and make it work? He wondered what would actually happen with his feelings for Draco, he definitely knew that there was part of him that wanted to admit to the man that he’s started to have feelings for him but how exactly would that conversation go? What if it just all went horribly wrong? He needed more time to know exactly what they felt for each other and whether it would be worth the risk of losing him as a friend first.
The words slipped out of his word before he had a chance to take them back. He quickly turned to face the kitchen cabinets absolutely mortified with himself. It had just come from the conversation they had earlier about Draco being the Slytherin Prince… it didn’t mean anything… except it sounded an awful lot like a pet name that you give to a boyfriend… bloody hell! He needed to watch what he said.
“That sounds nice.” Draco hummed happily into Harry’s ear. “Better still be a mountain of presents though.” He mumbled as his head lolled onto Harry’s shoulder and his eyes closed.
“I think I must have done.” Draco frowned. “We used to have lots of gatherings at the Manor when I was little and she must have been at some of the early ones but I don’t remember her particularly and she died when I was five so…”
“I’m sorry Draco, I was just worried. I-I do care.” She said slowly before brushing off her show of emotions with a more formal tone. “I believe Pinky is bringing some food out, it is rather lovely here. Would you care to sit with me for a while?” She asked tentatively.
Draco shook off his expression and let his face fall soft to hopefully express his gratitude to his best friend.
Ron snorted and threw a mock scowl over his shoulder at Hermione. “Well now there’s no excuse!”
It might help you visualise things that I'm writing about a bit more such as looks and outfits. Also I have created my version of the new Grimmauld Place on the Sims (again yes, I really am that sad!) and although it's not as good as others I've seen and I'm not 100% happy with it, I might include some more screenshots of it as we go through the story to help give you more of an idea about he setting.
“Yes Daphne, I heard you.” Draco said simply, still not moving.
“Ok, well thanks.” Harry said drinking a bit more coffee and taking a deep breath.
manager. Head of reception and administration to be precise.” He said simply picking up his pineapple this time to take a sip and only answering the last of Harry’s questions.
Draco automatically started to make some toast, feeling more confident today and not even asking Harry. He reminded himself of what he’d seen in some of the cupboards and did have to open a few before he got the right ones but after a short time and not too much effort he’d placed a tray of spreads, a rack of toast, two knives and two plates on the kitchen table. Harry sat down with the two mugs of coffee and they tucked in.
Even though he’d lost the bet, Harry was pretty damn happy too. It had been the best Sunday afternoon he’d had in a long time. The game had been thrilling to watch and it made him annoyed that he hadn’t made more use out of his private box in the last few years. He was determined to come to more matches next season and it really made him want to fly more too.
“Other than that though, I wanted to be exactly like my father, it was what I was brought up to be and the only thing I knew. I wanted to be the aristocratic business man, heir to the Malfoy fortune and everything that went with it which I guess is why I repressed my sexuality. I knew I would be married off to some beautiful respectable pure-blood witch and we would have to produce an heir and I thought that’s what I wanted or I was trying to convince myself I suppose.”
Draco looked at the outstretched hand. He never thought that Potter would hold his hand out to him and he was reminded of that time of the train all those years ago picturing them at eleven years old with an outstretched hand between them. Only that time it had been Draco’s and Potter hadn’t taken it. It had made him so angry, how dare Potter refuse him and think that he was better than him, he had half a mind to refuse Potter now only he wasn’t Draco. He was Pierre and Pierre would never refuse a handshake with a client.
“Speaking of things getting serious, George has started telling his family about Daphne apparently it’s official now did you know?” Harry asked as he sipped on his hazelnut latte. He didn’t indulge in one often but this was nice.
Instead Harry slowly reached out his hand and ever so gently trailed his fingers across the white lines etched across Draco’s chest. Draco’s skin was pale anyway so they didn’t stand out too much but they were definitely noticeable. They weren’t raised or ugly though, they were thin, delicate and smooth to touch, so smooth that they almost looked shiny in the light like strings of white gold.
“You still going out?” Harry enquired casually.
“I really did live in France.” Draco said indignantly. “I’m not a liar Potter, I may protect some of the truth and I do what I need to in certain situations but I’m still a man of honour!”
All of a sudden he felt his whole body become stiff and he couldn’t move. Just as his rigid form began to fall backwards he floated into the air instead and his petrified body was laid onto the bed. He couldn’t move, he couldn’t speak all he could do was listen to Harry as he spoke.
“Yes I suppose that could be said.” She said back a little coldly but not extremely so.
“Harry” Daphne said gently in a way that let him know she was serious in what she was about to say. “I’m hoping you still want me to be honest, you’ve responded well to it so far.” She trailed off waiting for his confirmation.
Shaking off his trailing thoughts he carried on. “I definitely want to emphasise how many people helped me along the way and tell the stories of the other war heros too. That’s the main reason for doing this really, to hopefully stop this ridiculous idea that I just waltzed up to Voldemort during the battle and just killed him with a flick of my wand by myself… I’m just aware that it’s not only my story to tell, I guess I need to get permission or something from the people that I’m writing about… there might be some conversations that need to happen before the book comes out.”
“So what’s going on now?” Blaise asked the question on everyone’s mind.
“That’s because I am Potter or have you forgotten?!” Draco said, raising his left arm angrily.
Waking up with Draco everyday was a gift and something which he would never take for granted. They would shower together more often than not and on days like today where Draco wasn’t going into the shop, they could take a little longer enjoying each other's bodies. Harry liked to remind Draco just how hot he was in Harry’s eyes and wanted to keep that fire they’d discovered on their initial attraction to each other. So far at least, they definitely still had it.
Another little bit of Blaise/Harry interaction at the quidditch for you!
“I like most wines to be honest as long as they're good.” Draco said smiling but then looked a little worried about something, his eyes flickering ever so slightly to upstairs but Harry didn’t take much notice.
It was nearly lunchtime and he was just looking over the new orders he’d just received during his morning appointments. He was still getting bespoke Hallows Eve presents and he had a few wedding gift baskets to do too as Halloween seemed to be a popular wedding day for the wizarding community for some reason. Still he wasn’t complaining as they were good money makers. The business was still doing well and Draco was thrilled. His reputation had really increased now so he might even be able to put his prices up.
“Ah the firewhiskey is open already, should I be worried?” He called out from the other room.
Harry was temporarily thrown by the fact that Malfoy looked
“No, not really allowed to.” Harry said flatly as if it was no big deal. Really though he didn’t particularly want to talk about his own life. “So how many of those do I have to get you to drink before you tell me your story?”
Immediately after moving back to the manor his parents had started talking about the need for him to start formally courting a suitable witch so he could get married and then produce an heir for the Malfoy line. His father said that they’d allowed Draco to “go have his fun in France” but now it was time for him to put the family first and do what was expected of him. Draco planned to do no such thing but he needed to bide his time. He knew that if he told his father his plans straight away he would risk being disinherited. He’d decided a long time ago that he didn’t really care about that but he needed to save up his own money before he could make a break for it and strike out on his own. He had no doubt that his father would block him from all of the Malfoy vaults if he knew what he had planned.
Harry had forgotten they were even holding hands, it just seemed so natural but thinking about it he supposed it wasn’t. After all, he didn’t hold hands with any of his other male friends… He couldn’t think about that now though, it was too confusing. If Draco wanted to hold his hand then he could. Frankly if Draco wanted to do anything now Harry would probably let him after everything he’d just revealed to him.
“Hmm that’s why you smell so good now!” Fred said playfully quickly leaning over to Harry and dramatically smelling his neck.
He’d written this part but he couldn’t be bothered to go and get his notes upstairs. Draco could read them later properly but for now he was more in the mood to actually talk to Draco and tell him about this for them, not just for the sake of writing the book.
It was the most thoughtful present he had ever received and he found himself fighting back tears. Draco knew better than to not openly cry so he was suddenly immensely grateful that his father wasn't present. His father would have launched into a speech about how “Malfoy men do not cry”. His mother however had just delicately placed her hand on his shoulder to give it a little squeeze before quietly slipping away without another word. It was her way of silently letting him know that it was ok to cry, so cry he had.
“Probably toasted crumpets with butter, can’t beat it!” Harry said happily.
“Yeh” Potter said back.
He stepped forward and addressed Narcissa in a gentle way but still with an air of authority. “Ms Black as I understand it?” He questioned. So far he seemed to be avoiding Draco.
Harry shifted slightly uncomfortably. “Erm, no it was before Hogwarts mostly. I, er, did a lot around the house I guess but it’s no big deal. I’m sure lots of kids had to do chores… except you of course.” He said with a fake sort of chuckle but he hoped he’d deflected enough for Draco not to ask anymore questions.
“So your favorite food is French right Draco?” Potter looked at him and spoke so casually as if they’d been best friends for years but Draco could still see the flicker of uncertainty in those eyes he knew so well.
Blaise and Daphne looked at him eagerly in anticipation.
“Thank you, Pinky it’s perfect.” Draco said honestly, with a rare genuine smile on his face.
That warmed Harry’s heart too. It was nice to think he was providing Draco with a place to properly rest and be well looked after, he deserved that.
“No worries.” Fred answered back. “Come on Georgie, let’s go make you handsome!”
“Yeah. Dromeda, Teddy and Narcissa know too.” Harry said shifting slightly. He was hoping Hermione wouldn’t mind not being the first to know.
“Yeah that’s the one!” Harry said enthusiastically. “I don’t really know him but he seems like a good guy. Fred and George like him and they say he’s a really good worker. He’s really keen to impress and he wants to stay, think he’s had a tough time finding work since he left school. I doubt he’d care about the situation at all, he has a lot of respect for Fred and George and he wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise his job. He keeps his head down and just does what he’s asked so he wouldn’t bother you.”
Draco was touched by her care and felt a bit guilty now about his initial response so tried to show some care back in his reply.
“Well true.” Harry nodded in agreement. “But still doesn't mean anything. Just because I find someone attractive doesn’t mean I actually want to be in a relationship with them. The idea of me and him is still absurd!” He insisted honestly.
Draco nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s probably true. Still not sure how I feel about him knowing though. What exactly did he say to you?”
“Ronald!” Hermione scolded her husband just coming into view behind him from the garden path that led round the back. “How many times have I told you not to swear in front of Rose?”
“Then I finally decided to get this place redecorated but it took some doing. I stayed with Hermione at her flat while the work was being done mostly but I still wasn’t there every night, I was out a lot. That was before her and Ron were married obviously. Dean and Seamus did the work and I was really pleased with it but weirdly it still felt like someone else’s house. I dunno, guess I’ve never really had my own space and a proper home before so it was strange. It still felt cold and empty even though it looked nice. I’ve been spending more time here recently though since I left the aurors and it’s started to feel a little bit more like home I guess.”
“Now drink this.” She said quietly but still commandingly handing him on of his own pain potions from his limited basement stock.
“I’ve had my fair share of adventure and it wasn’t always fun!” Harry muttered but still hadn’t pushed Blaise away.
“What?” Draco asked, examining the man’s face. “You don’t like this outfit?”
Harry felt sick.

Enjoy!
Another fun and light chapter, who else really wants to go and party at The Burrow?! Love that place and love the Weasleys!
“M-Mr P-Potter.” She stuttered.
“You know the visions of Voldy I mention?” Harry asked.
So Monday was just a normal brewing day. Except this time he had Harry bringing him lunch which was a very welcome addition to his routine. After the working day they cooked dinner for the first time together, well Harry cooked and Draco did what he was told but still it was nice to contribute.
As I had some lovely comments I thought I'd treat you to another chapter!
“Oh.” Draco said, surprised. “Not sure if I should be offended or not that I’m not in the beginning! Guess this is before Hogwarts then?”
“Er, I hope it’s the right one, I tried to say it in my head how you’d said it but erm, well it might be wrong.” Harry noticed how Draco’s fingers brushed his ever so slightly as he took the glass from him. He tried to look away but he couldn’t as his eyes fixed upon Draco’s mouth as he took a sip of the wine.
“Oh.” Was all that Harry said.
“Well he certainly doesn’t seem to like me now! What changed?” Draco asked.
Although, Draco hadn’t seemed like he regretted it, not straight away at least. Harry wasn’t sure who pulled back first but it had come to an end in some way. Draco hadn’t withdrawn hastily though, his hand had rested on Harry’s waist for a moment and he had looked into Harry’s eyes. Then, as the credits had finished running, Harry had asked Draco what he thought of the film which had led to a fun friendly chat about it. They had laughed and talked on the sofa as they had before, not touching, not addressing the kiss but not being awkward either, it had been perfectly comfortable.
Draco immediately tensed up and he could almost feel the mark burning into his skin at that moment, although it didn’t really burn anymore, it hadn’t since that day. He never looked at it, keeping his arms covered in long sleeves at all times. Even in the shower he avoided touching it. He never allowed himself to think about it even though he could never forget it was there.
Potter had raised his head from the desk and was watching the exchange curiously but silently.
Harry sighed knowing he couldn’t lie to Draco and he’d just have to get it over with.
Draco hesitated but only slightly. He knew what the answer to that was really, he’d always known. “Yes, I very much think he could be.”
“Right, yes, sorry.” He said somewhat awkwardly and slightly flushed.
“Oh right.” Harry said, feeling foolish. “I didn’t know you had a pool at the Manor but of course you did.” He said shaking his head slightly and then he turned his head in the direction of the garden. “Is there enough room here for an outdoor pool?”
“Wow.” He said shaking his head in disbelief again. “I do believe you are right.”
“I’m not worrying! I don’t care who the idiot dates. I just didn’t want to see him around here more than I have to that’s all.” Draco said sharply.
What has he really been up to for seven years? Why wasn’t he marrying the beautiful pure-blood witch and living a life of luxury at the Manor. Did he really live above a shop? How often was he dressed as Pierre and not Malfoy? It had really just been his hair and his eyes that were different. Harry could recognise that nose and that chiseled jawline, those hands and those lips lips. Merlin now he was thinking of Malfoy’s lips. That was odd.
“I’m not your fucking charity case Potter! I’m perfectly fine. I- I just don’t get hungry that’s all I focus on my work and I have sustenance potions. I don’t need your help and I don’t need your pity. Get out.”
Draco was surprised. Of course he knew that Harry kept an annoyingly close eye on him at school but he hadn’t realised that Harry would have picked up on little details like that and remembered them all these years later.
What did you think?
“Show off.” Were the words that came from Draco’s mouth causing him to look up again.
“No…” Harry shifted awkwardly. “I dunno, I just felt angry about the whole thing still and I didn’t want to see him like that, you know I’m not very good at hiding my feelings sometimes. I don’t think I could have lied to him and he wouldn’t have got it. I convinced Gawain and Kingsley to get Ron in and tell him that we’d just had a chat about my conduct and that we’d all agreed it would be best if I left as my heart just wasn’t in it anymore. We’re also going with the line that they told me they would be promoting Ron and that he wouldn’t need a partner anymore so that meant it was the right time for me to leave. I’ll have to apologise for him later for not telling him myself but I think he’ll be so happy with his promotion that he’ll forgive me.”
“We need to move out of this through OK? So we’re going to move you now.”
“It does?” Harry said quietly.
Harry, again reacting in instinct but thinking Draco needed encouragement gave his hand a gentle squeeze as Draco had done moments ago to him. The touch was enough for Draco to look back into Harry’s eyes.
“Yeah and if you want to join the ‘my father was a dick’ club then let me know. So far it’s just me and you but I could probably find us a few more members, especially from Slytherin.” Draco said with a snort and that earned a faint chuckle from Graham.
“Yeah…” Harry said slowly and Draco thought he almost sounded like he didn’t want to go. “I’m usually there by now to be fair, it’s nice to spend a bit of time with Hermione on her own before Ron comes back, quality time with each of them you know? She likes to moan to me about him cos she can’t vent her frustrations around the Weasleys in case Molly hears of it! Plus I get extra cuddles with Rose this way too.”
“Yeah… ok.” Ron said slowly. They always had a laugh together but they weren’t really much good at talking about stuff. “So what happened? Kingsley said you’re not coming back… they didn’t make you leave did they? Cos you know everyone understood about, you know, the thing the other week, it was an easy mistake to make mate, I didn’t think they’d make you leave because of it!”
He was suddenly aware that this was the first time they were meeting without Daphne and Blaise. Their relationship had progressed pretty quickly already considering it was only a month ago that Draco was moving into his new home having not thought about Harry Potter for years. It had been intense so far and it wasn’t going to get any easier. He suddenly felt nervous and wondered if coming here had been a good idea.
“Oh” Draco said before he could stop himself.
“Draco,” his friend said quietly as he slowly walked towards him. “I’m sorry…”
Thursday was another day of meetings as Pierre, although fortunately not quite as many as Tuesday as he already had quite a few commissions to be getting on with. He had managed to brew a bit in the end yesterday late afternoon and evening though as he’d left Harry’s around 3pm when the other man needed to go pick up his Godson from school so he wasn’t as behind on his work as he thought he might be, he just needed to stay on top of it. It gave him nothing to do in the evenings though too. He only had his potions and business books, he didn’t have any books that he could read for pleasure, he didn't have anything entertaining in his flat really!
Hopsy helped Narcissa move out and Kreacher even offered to help too which Narcissa graciously accepted. Harry had never seen Kreacher off help like that. He was an odd one to work out, sometimes he seemed more than happy to help and pleased to be asked. He even moaned if Harry didn’t want his help half the time but then when Harry would ask him to do things he usually found a few to moan about them too. Harry didn’t mind though, he knew that Kreacher wasn’t actually unhappy, it was just that moaning was his natural state. It was done in a kind of affectionate way though. Still it was strange to see Kreacher offer to help so freely without grumbling.
It was Daphne’s turn to entertain them during dessert as Blaise drilled her for information about her budding relationship with George. Draco was surprised he hadn’t asked her the minute she returned from her date last night seeing as they lived together but then it was highly like that Blaise had been out himself until late. Draco stayed mostly quiet again enjoying the humours interactions that Blaise and Daphne had and happy to be out of the spotlight for questions.
Draco snorted. “Yes because you work really hard!”
Then he picked himself up and spoke with more confidence.
Lots of food, lots of conversations and a fund kayak adventure.
They both teared out of the room leaving Harry to once again feel sorry for the woman who had raised these terrors! Clearly it had been a good day in the shop today as the twins were in a very good mood. Harry felt another pang of guilt as he realised that he would probably be the one to ruin the mood later.
“I love it Draco, thank you so much.” Harry said genuinely.
“Well the Ministry can’t be seen to have lost their Golden Boy can they?!” Draco said bitterly before he could stop himself.
“Relax Harry it’s fine.” He heard Draco say quickly from his left. His voice certainly did seem to convey he was perfectly casual about it. “Our engagement was just for appearance sake, please don’t ask me to explain more now but maybe one day I will. All you need to know is that there was never actually anything between us.”
Draco smiled softly at Harry. “Yes, now I can understand it from your point of view too with what you’ve told me.”
“It’s a muggle radio.” Harry said as a sort of explanation even though Draco was none the wiser. “Impulse buy from the supermarket, I thought it might help me sleep.” He said quietly still with his back to Draco.
She turned to Draco. “You’ll come? Open minded?” She questioned.
Harry nodded. “You always kept telling me that year that I should still be putting myself out there, kept teasing me about finding Mr. Right... “
Draco frowned. “You didn’t have to do that, I thought you were just here on your lunch break.”
“He loved it Draco! Honestly you should have seen him, he really was impressed!” She said fondly. “You are really good at what you do, you know.”
He got up from his seat and stood by him for a moment laying a hand on his shoulder. “Good luck at the Ministry sweetie but remember get a contract and bring it home to read properly. I’ll look at it with you tonight.” Harry still seemed too surprised to even reply but kind of nodded and Draco bent down to kiss him firmly on the lips.
“James?” He questioned.
“Oh you will.” He said fondly rising from the bed. “I shall leave you to your paperwork Mother. Shall we say half six for dinner?”
He was at a crucial stage where he was adding just a tiny splash of peppermint extract. It was used in calming draughts but only in small amounts, too much and it would react negatively with the charms he’s placed on the lavender sprigs. He was just hovering over the cauldron adding the tiny drop of peppermint required when the tight band on his ankle suddenly burned hot. The alarming sensation shocked him and caused him to drop the entire bottle of peppermint essence in the cauldron which consequently exploded.
“Just doing my job Potter.” Draco replied simply with no hint of emotion.
“Yes! I rather think I have!”
Kreacher set about showing Draco where the glasses, mugs, plates, cutlery and utensils were kept as well as pots, pans and other kitchen items. There were lots of things that Draco didn’t recognise and he was beginning to think that cooking would be harder than he expected. Kreacher also showed him this muggle thing that was like a big cooling cupboard with a light on the inside and lots of different things on the shelves. There was also another one underneath that was really cold, everything in there was frozen. It was amazing really that muggles found a way to keep food cold and preserve things without magic.
talk about this.
Just as Draco suspected he would, Harry got slightly nervous again. “Erm, well yeah… you could say that. I know who their source was… I’m really sorry I didn’t mean to say anything but I just wanted to shut her up and it did work to be fair.”
“Erm, you can collect Blaise, Daphne, Fred and George’s on the way out I guess and I’ll get Graham’s from him next time I see him.” Harry said casually.
“Yeh… had enough of fighting for a while, and it’s still a bit stressful amongst the aurors at the moment. To be honest this seemed like a good peaceful assignment and I thought you’d be happier when you go to school if you knew she was with me. She’ll be alright with me.” Leo shrugged.
“My father has french descendants, hence the name but my mother is British. I grew up in England but learnt french from a young age and then moved to France to complete my education and do my potions masters.” He said in his professional but warm tone.
The impact shook the whole table and the completed perfumes that Draco had already made fell off the edge and smashed on the floor. The cauldron shattered and remnants of the pewter pot went everywhere crashing into bottles and breaking them but worse than that was the boiling hot liquid from the cauldron that shot up everywhere. Draco threw his hands over his face to protect most of it but splashes of the liquid went all over his hands and down one side of his neck burning his flesh on impact.
I was debating whether this was too much, I thought about spiting into two conversations but I do want to get the main plot moving a bit now...
There was a slight moment where the three of them exchanged slightly nervous glances but Draco had been holding himself together for too long it seemed and seeing Harry there he looked like he needed the physical comfort he had recently learnt to accept. He stood up suddenly and threw his arms around Harry. It took him by surprise but he accepted it nonetheless wrapping his arms around Draco too and rubbed his back. Draco nuzzled into his neck and whimpered slightly. Harry hadn’t expected him to be so open in front of his mother, it really wasn’t like him but then he had been changing recently for the better. He was more open, more honest, more himself and it was good to see that his mother’s presence hadn’t sent him backwards.
Harry sighed loudly but when he spoke it was in a really quiet voice. “Yes… it’s the only time I miss him really.”
Blaise shrugged. “I did, she’s got a good body even if she’s not classically pretty.”
“Yeah, you too.” Draco said in response.
“We cannot simply let you go freely elsewhere either, you all still have some explaining to do. There are people here who would have me send you directly to Azkaban, however, it is not in my nature to incarcerate people before a trial, whoever they may be. We must also take into consideration that there are known Death Eaters who have escaped today. If they believe you have… switched sides... they may wish to do you harm. So what I propose is that you will all be taken to a safe house where you will await your individual trials. I can assure you that you will be looked after and your trials will be fair all you need to do is cooperate with us. This is the best I can do for the moment”
Harry nodded but didn’t say anything.
“I don’t care about the money but it would be better for Mother and I want a permanent freedom from Lucius not just a temporary one. Perhaps we should involve the aurors.” Draco admitted.
He just shrugged but smiled anyway. “It’s just so empty, shagging some guy in a club. Just doesn’t do it for me anymore. It never really did in the first place but at least it was kind of fun before. It made me forget for a while but now…” He sighed. “I thought I was happy being alone, I haven’t felt anything about it in ages but then, erm, well, something happened to make me feel something again and now I want more but I can’t have it.”
Harry just nodded again.
Some mornings it was just the two of them, but sometimes Leo would come and help too. Most of the time they would discuss a plan and then work in a comfortable silence just coming together every so often to decide on a colour or agree the layout. Occasionally, the morning would be a bit livelier and they would talk as they worked. Either one was fine with Draco, it was nice to have something to do and he found himself enjoying the company in whatever form it took.
Harry was nodding seriously. “Yeah I can understand that, but you’re safe here.” He said seriously, repeating his words from the night before. He watched Draco try to put it on and secure the fastenings one handed but struggle. He scooted forward wordlessly and took over from him to do the straps up.
“Could you please confirm for us all that you do in fact bear the Dark Mark on your left forearm?”
He was pleased that his friendship with Harry was back on track now, he was amazed at how easily Harry had forgiven him and how he’d taken him in without question. The man really did have a heart of gold which only made Draco like him more. However, there had been nothing flirty about their interactions last night and the sexual tension he’d felt around the man on Saturday had gone. What would happen now that they were living together, would it return? Was there anything between them in that way or had Draco simply imagined it? Or maybe now that Harry had been reminded of Draco’s ugly side he realised that he didn’t want Draco like that anymore. Maybe Harry only ever wanted to be friends.
“Merlin save me.” Ron muttered under his breath and then composed himself. “See you around D-Draco.” He stuttered out and then turned to Narcissa. “Ms Black.” He said politely then he swiftly left the room.
“You’re a dick.” Harry replied, giving him a playful kick.
Also I was debating on a reread if Draco's reaction seems a bit extreme but he is still pretty fragile and his gut reaction is to automatically push people away who get too close. Blaise and Daphne know this which is why they haven't pushed too far but it's not because they're bad friends... Also they don't realise how bad Draco's situation regarding food is and Draco hasn't overly complained to them about his living quarters.
When Draco caught sight of Harry though his expression turned back into one of mischievous glee. “Looking good Potter.” He teased eyeing his chest and then trailing his eyes down to the stupid shorts.
Harry turned his attention back to breakfast and they finished it in a comfortable silence. When he was done he looked over to Draco again who was also finished so he called Kreacher to take the empty trays.
“You going to come out and show us any time soon?” Came Daphne’s soft voice through the door.
You may have noticed the chapter number update. I have spent a long time this week reading back over the whole story and planning out the last few chapters properly so I'm fairly confident now that they won't change now. I plan on it being 45 chapters in total but then with an epilogue.
“Good, you have the morning off today as I shall not be here so you will have plenty of time for your correspondence.” That got Draco’s attention as he turned to look at her.
“OK.” Harry said chuckling lightly at Draco’s ever changing moods but pleased the fire was back in his little dragon. “Draco,” He said softly and waited until Draco looked back into his eyes. “Nothing you do will be wrong, you already make me feel better than anyone else has ever done so just trust your instincts and I promise you I will enjoy it.” He said honestly giving Draco the confidence boost he needed.
“-then maybe you can finally allow yourself to be happy.” Fred finished softly kissing the top of Harry’s head.
“OK.” Harry said happily.
Was struggling with this chapter as I have a lot of ideas for the end half but we're not quite there yet and didn't really know what to do with the middle so had writer's block for ages.
“What did he say?” Daphne prompted quietly with a smile.
“Morning Minister” Robards said, shaking hands with the man first.
They both had a tear in their eyes now. Harry had cried a fair few times in his life but he wasn’t a massive crier and he wasn’t sure if he’d ever seen Fred cry, not even at Percy’s funeral. He had the suspicion that the only person who’d ever seen him cry before was George. Fred buried his head back into Harry’s chest again.
“Agreed.” Harry interjected.
“Name them.” Potter said confidently.
“Miss Greengrass, it’s really nice to meet you, Harry has spoken very fondly of you.” George said with a slight bow to the head and then he gently kissed the back of the hand that she had extended towards him.
Then he cleared his throat and looked up at Draco again. “It’s not control if I’m asking for your help in making a decision.”
Fred gave a little cough before continuing. “But it might not be the healthiest way of coping…” Fred trailed off.
Just then George came back with three bowls of chicken soup. Turned out Harry had slept for longer than he thought earlier and it was quite late. They ate their soup in George’s room mostly in silence. Harry couldn’t use his right hand and struggled slightly with his left. It didn’t feel right. He even tried controlling the spoon with magic, levitating so he could just slurp from it but he always used his right hand to channel controlled wandless magic with and it was hurting so much that he couldn’t quite do it right. He’d never managed wandless magic with his left hand unless it was done by accident, even his wand couldn’t be controlled in his left hand but he couldn’t grip it with his right at the moment.
His shop was a terraced building and at the rear was an alleyway that all the backs of the shops next to his lead out onto. He only had to walk past the back of two more shops to access the side alley that ran round to the front of Diagon Alley. As he turned in that direction he saw a flash of someone ducking back around the corner from the alley but he could still see their shadow on the ground. They had clearly just gone round the corner but they weren’t walking off yet… was it possible that the person was waiting for him or was he being paranoid? He stopped Daphne by grabbing hold of her arm, she did stop but she clearly hadn’t seen what he’d seen.
Draco moved his head back so that it was no longer leaning on Harry’s chest but he didn't remove the arms he had wrapped around him so Harry didn’t remove from the arm of the chair that he was perched on. He shifted his arms slightly so that one was draped around Draco’s shoulder and the other was just hanging loosely by his side. They were still close and it still was probably more than friends would be but it was slightly more casual and less intimate. Harry was glad that he didn’t have to move away completely. Somehow he wanted to be physically close to Draco while he spoke so he could tell Draco through his actions that he cared as well as his words as he wasn’t sure if they would come out right.
Eager to hear your thoughts on this chapter please I love reading your comments!
Draco, who had carried on walking past Kreacher into the kitchen, suddenly turned around and realised the house elf had disappeared.
“So I just apologise or something?” Draco question full of uncertainty.
“Oh Merlin.” Draco laughed but he wasn’t worried. His apparition technique was perfect so as long as Harry was picturing where they were going Draco could help control them both.
She looked a little taken aback but fortunately for her she could the slight pause in conversation as Hopsy served dinner to compose herself.
Daphne smiled again and elegantly sat down at the table. “I hope you like my choice of restaurant.” She said as she sat.
“Hmm damn you with your plans and your sound logic.” Draco whined. Then he pulled his head back, eyes closed and kind of shook it a bit as if riding himself of his thoughts. He took a deep breath and then opened his eyes. “What time will you be back tonight?”
“I don’t think I could ever get tired of seeing you topless.” He blurted out even though it hadn’t been what he’d meant to say.
“About the whole Triwizard Tournament being hijacked in order to get me to a graveyard in the end be forced to take part in a ceremony that resurrected Tom Riddle so he could start another war?” Harry asked as if it was still unbelievable to him even all these years later.
Draco smiled to himself as he remembered a particular potions lesson during sixth year as he realised what he could do with that knowledge. It wouldn’t do to slip up again though as there was no way that Pierre would know that.
“Did you miss me?” He asked Draco jokingly, even though part of him was serious.
Sunday morning his nerves were almost getting the better of him and he was wondering why he’d ever agreed to this in the first place. Just when he was thinking about floo calling Daphne from the fireplace in his office that was connected to the floo call network, there was a knock on the back door. There were only two people that ever did that, both of whom he was supposed to be meeting in an hour but he had a feeling he knew why they had come.
"Weasley, Ginevra."
Harry awoke with a start after another nightmare. Today was the last day of his 5th year at Hogwarts, and that meant that today he would have to go to the Dursley's. Harry
Harry didn't know what to say. He didn't have anything against it, he was bi after all. He decided to go with, "Well if it's a day for coming out, I'm bi."

When Draco Malfoy awoke the next morning, it was to his parents sitting on the armchairs, looking shocked. He cleared his throat to get their attention, causing them to look up sharply, a startled look on their faces. It was only when they were with people they were comfortable with, that they showed emotion. Therefore, it was always a little funny when they looked so shocked, which wasn’t often.
‘Harry came to us at the beginning of the term in a pretty bad shape. He could barely walk and was clearly in a lot of pain. He can have a scholarship, but I would suggest removing him from the school.’
Vernon sat up in bed, shocked awake by a scream coming from downstairs. Getting up as fast as he could, he made his way down the stairs as fast as he could, which wasn’t very fast at all. When he got to the sauce of the sound, he saw his wife clutching a letter to her chest. A noise made him turn to look at their armchair and noticed a bundle. Walking towards it, he noticed that the bundle was moving slightly. Picking it up he was face to face with a baby. He would never admit this to anyone, but he had a soft spot for babies. He looked at his wife for answers. She silently handed him the letter before leaving to make breakfast. After watching her leave, he placed the baby back on the chair. Turning back to the letter he began to read.
However there was one complication. The Slytherin's were determined to get him into a Christmas jumper. He was currently, after an hour and a half of them trying, lay across the top of a bookshelf glaring at Draco. What he didn't realise was that Pansy was behind him. Suddenly he was in a Christmas jumper, however unfortunate that was, he now had an excuse to leave. He jumped down and walked straight out of the common room, the sound of laughter behind him.
Shaking her head to dispel her thoughts, Petunia nodded her head. She went to the attic and walked to the back. In front of her, under a bedsheet, sat her sisters’ old bed. Collecting the mattress, Petunia walked back down the stairs. She placed it on the sofa and walked back into the attic. Next to the crib was a chest full of bedding. She picked out some single bedding and made her way down the stairs, turning off the light as she went.
"This is Eclipse, her sisters are, Lila and Angel."
Also, I am looking for a beta, so if anyone is interested, email me at slytherindrarryshipper@gmail.com.
Potter!"
“I’ve found him!” He yelled and helped Harry out of his cupboard. “We have the memories for you to view.” Morfran wisely left out asking his grandson what had happened, sensing that it was still too fresh.
When we arrived Sav showed me the guest room that I was going to be staying in. she let me in and went to the window. "Oh My God." Was all she said.
They both began to speak at the same time but Harry shushed them, he lowered the charms on Ron's bed and yelled at the top of his lungs, "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" it had the desired effect as Ron jumped out of bed, wand in hand and began looking around. Harry got a pillow to the face before he could escape the room laughing, only to be met by an angry, pyjama clad, Hermione. She apparently had heard the yell from her room and had the same reaction as Ron causing her to get funny looks from her friends.
must be Harry Potter.
His friends didn’t seem to think anything of his bizarre behaviour, they just assumed that he was traumatised by what had happened to Cedric. Harry was good at hiding his secrets. The year passed in the same way that most did. With nobody noticing the strange things Harry did.
Both Harry, who was in the process of raising his head, and Draco froze, glancing at each other briefly before tensing up and looking at Pansy, who now had Blaise, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle stood behind her.
“WHAT?” Harry flinched at the volume of his own voice, expecting a hit. After all, that was the only thing that family did.
When Draco got back into the common room later that day, he was still trying to come to terms with the fact that Potter was his mate. He stopped in his tracks when he realised that he still hadn't found Hunter. Deciding that the cat wold be back, he continued into the common room. This was the weirdest Christmas he had ever experienced, and that was saying something. When he got into the common room he was met with an odd sight. Hunter sprawled on his back with Pansy absentmindedly stroking the underside of his chin, Crabbe and Goyle doing their homework and Blaise and Theo lying down on the sofa reading. Sitting down on one of the overstuffed armchairs, I could smell my mate again, which meant that Harry Potter was in the Slytherin common room. And that meant that
He asked politely.
Vernon was just about to enter him again.
Everyone was at the Halloween feast when there was a loud crash in the entrance hall. The chatter died down and everyone was wondering what was happening. Before the mutterings could start, there was another crash, this time the doors to the Great Hall were blasted open. There stood, Lily and James Potter, Alice and Frank Longbottom, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, most of the higher ranking Death Eaters and Tom Riddle, no longer looking like Voldemort. They made their way towards where Dumbledore was sat and shared a hushed conversation with the old man, before turning and leaving. All of the children and friends of the people that were now leaving the school, had a letter on their plaits when they looked down.
“It doesn’t matter Ronald. Harry, what’s wrong?” Mi asked, looking at him worriedly.
When, an hour later, they got to the Dursley’s, they threw Harry into the cupboard under the stairs, locked it, and went to eat.
It was weird to see Hermione now. He could see the way she would have looked if her appearance wasn’t changed in his head. She looked a lot like her mother, Bellatrix, not Mrs Granger. “I’m fine Mi, but
Taking a deep breath, Harry dove into the memories that he knew would change his life.
It was a difficult task for Harry to seem unaffected by those words. 1 hour, he had been unconscious for two days, what was Dumbledore doing in that time. Harry growled at the headmaster and ran to the dungeons. When he got there he bumped into Draco making his way to the carriages. Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him into an empty classroom.
October 1981 saw a young boy orphaned. Crying in his crib, just wanting his mother to stand from the floor and hold him close. Oblivious to the world around him. He looked up with tears streaming down his face. He had heard something downstairs. Crying harder, he held his blanket close. Staring at the door, he saw a man turn the corner. The young boy didn’t know who he was, just that he was wearing dark things. The unknown man fell to the floor beside his mother, holding her close. Hearing another sound coming from downstairs, the man disappeared, leaving the child alone.
Vernon thought as he walked up the stairs after his nephew.
Father still wasn't back so he couldn't show him the letter yet.
"Harry?" She asked clearly trying to hold in her amusement. Somehow he knew he couldn't talk so instead just nodded. "What happened? Oh right you can't answer. I know who could fix this but first we've got to meet Maman's friends dog, Spark. Come on." She picked him up and ran down the stairs.
“We had three names that we were going to choose between.” She explained, stepping into the room when the door was held open for her. “Theodora, Cassiopeia and Theophania”
Hoping to just walk past him Harry continued on his way.
“Vivienne. Vivienne Potter. But I will be down as Harry.” He added the last part as an afterthought. “My aunt and uncle were told I was a boy, and it was too late to change it.” He added, lying smoothly.
“Only if you call me Narcissa, Hadrian. Mrs. Malfoy makes me feel old.” She said with mirth shining in her eyes. Hadrian laughed softly before offering her some breakfast. “That would be lovely Hadrian. Although, I didn’t know you could cook.” Narcissa said looking at the dark haired boy curiously.
"Yeah." she said in a high pitched voice.
Harry thought smiling bitterly through his tears.
Harry really tried to get on with his fellow students, but they all seemed to hate him. They didn’t seem to understand that he didn’t have parents. They just thought he was strange. He was treated like an outcast and couldn’t wait to get a fresh start in his new school.
When Petunia Dursley awoke at 6 am the next morning, she went to do her usual morning routine. Moving to the kitchen, she got everything out ready to make breakfast for her family. Satisfied with the breakfast plan, she moved towards the front door to collect the milk. It was always there to collect early in the morning.
“WHERE THE HELL ARE MY HAIR PRODUCTS?” Draco yelled from his bedroom before coming out and glaring at the younger boy, who was trying and failing to hide his laughter. “Hadrian, I need my hair products. There is only half an hour left until the train leaves.” He continued pacing, hair falling into his face.
When they got outside, Harry noticed a big man standing there, tears in his eyes. The adults were talking but Harry was too tired to listen. Eventually, he felt himself being handed to the new person. His uncle had handed him over, so he must be good! He was wrapped in a blanket and before long had fallen asleep.
After signing her name on the envelope he gave it to Hedwig, let her out and then ran down the seven flights of stairs to get to the Entrance Hall. He got to the gates just before the last carriage left. Only Sav was in it so he was lucky.

Once she got off the phone to the Academy, Petunia turned to her husband. Once he had turned the volume down on the television, she began to speak.
The day before everyone was to leave Harry attempted to pack his own things but, being so young, he was just running around, throwing items into the bag. When he awoke the next morning, he jumped out of bed and ran into the dressing room. A teacher was already in there getting another boy ready to go.
They told him to get into the car and, without even looking at him, drove off to Number 4 Privet Drive. Harry was coming up with a plan in his head, he knew now that they wouldn’t let him leave in a hurry. He was hoping to just go to his room and get his wand, he would leave at night when it’s dark and take the Knight Bus.
“Mrs Dursley,” she said politely, “both boys have passed the exam, Dudley just passed, only a few marks over. Harry has almost full marks and has earned a scholarship. Please choose which boy is going where and buy them everything on this list. Both boys are required to have everything, or both of their places could be taken.” She handed Petunia a list before continuing. “Congratulation’s boys. I must leave you; I have a meeting in ten minutes.” Bidding the trio farewell, she turned and walked into her office, closing the door as she went.
“I think that would be best, both get grumpy if they don’t eat.” She said, chuckling softly. Hadrian smiled and went back to his cooking.
The voice was female, but that wasn't what caught his attention.
‘The school is to cure people of mental illnesses. It is not a mad house!’ the teacher sighed, before talking in a quieter voice, ‘Just don’t put him in the hospital again, there aren’t enough beds. Otherwise, do what you want.’ He heard the teacher leave the students quietly laughing as they followed.
Once Draco had got the others to stop laughing he went and got dressed before putting Hunter on his leash and making their way to breakfast. On the way to breakfast the 6th year Slytherin boys, and Hunter, met up with Pansy Parkinson and the other familiars that were all wolves, Silver (Pansy's familiar, a grey female with silver eyes), Frost (Theo's familiar, a white male with icy blue eyes), Bullet and Bolt (Crabbe and Goyle's familiars, in that order, brown males, brothers, with brown eyes) and Paws (Blaise's familiar, a black female cub with golden eyes whose mother was Silver). Then they made their way to the great hall, when they got there all eyes were on them. Well who wouldn't look at people with such odd pets.
Hi! Chapters will start going up every other Saturday from now. Also, I have a new story that is going to start being posted next Saturday. Anyway, here's the chapter.
That is why it came as such a surprise when he heard the locks go on the door, he knew that it was the morning, as he had only heard his Cousin come down the stairs about an hour ago, so why was she unlocking the door.
Harry was all packed and dreading going back to the Dursley's. He was praying that they didn't know Sirius was dead. If they knew then everything would turn south very quickly. After he had said his goodbyes he used the floo network to get back to 4 Privet Drive. There waiting for him was his uncle. His uncle grabbed him and shoved him into his cupboard wordlessly, chucking his stuff in behind him, he locked the door.
“Harry?” the teen in question froze.
No one in the group particularly wanted to be the one to tell the Professor about what they had learned. So Draco, being in Snape’s house and his Godson, stepped forward. “Professor, we have some memories that we need to show you.” He said hesitantly.
Once he had finished the passages that he needed, he moved to sit on the floor. Pulling his wand from his bag, he practiced the spells. The first one was a privacy spell. It would ensure that no one heard him when he had his nightmares. The second was a glamour spell. It was more complicated but required. He was currently using some makeup he had bought in Diagon Alley to cover his scars and bruises. Luckily for him, Hagrid wasn’t too observant. It took him all night, but he finally got the spell. Looking at the clock on the mantel, he saw that it was almost 5 am. Creeping back into his dorm room he went to his bed. It was Monday today and he would be heading to class in the morning.
He was by a lake so he went and had a look at his reflection, how he got there he didn't know. He was a tortoise. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived was now a tortoise. He looked at his reflection again and saw something beneath the surface. It was a shark. A small shark, but still a shark. He was going to jump back when he saw two other figures beneath the surface. A whale and a small dolphin.
birthday that his life began to change. Making a quick decision he decided that his uncle was correct. He should hide the truth.
“Okay well we need to get to the carriages, Pansy will be screeching like a banshee if we’re any later.” Draco said, with a hint of laughter. Harry turned back into his animagus form and allowed Draco to attach his leash to his collar.

"Yea just give me a second." Draco said, then whispered to Harry, "Turn back, now."
He did his best to act like everything was fine in Japan. He made up excuses for why his arm was broken. His most common excuse was that he fell down the stairs. The students seemed to buy it, but the teachers were overly nice to him.
“Why?” the potions master asked, but at the look on the blondes face nodded and handed it over.
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter, J.K.R does.
"We all are not what we would expect. Now what is your name." the voice asked.
"You were bored? That doesn't mean you destroy a room!" he said back, not quite at the point of yelling, but, as a reflex, Harry flinched anyway.
They had just sat down when Hadrian walked into the room, fully dressed, with his hair left down. He stopped short upon seeing the elder Malfoys sitting there, but just smiled and greeted them politely before walking into the kitchen.
WARNING!!!
The next chapter will be the beginning of the main plot of the story! I will begin writing it soon.
Harry glanced at his watch before quickly telling Sav the time. They had 20 minutes to get onto the train. He rushed up into his room grabbed a roll of parchment and wrote a note to his aunt.
The welcome feast was the same as usual. Except, the Gryffindor Golden Boy wasn't there, and even his friends look worried.
Before they knew it they were at platform 9 ¾, saying goodbye to their friends. Harry knew that he had to go and get his wand from Privet Drive.
Taking a deep breath, Harry followed Moody to his Aunt and Uncle.
"Hunter's Woodland Park? Harry, that's half an hour's drive, at least." She said, looking at him pointedly.
"Don't worry Minerva, harry is safe. I am going to make an announcement at breakfast tomorrow. You see I have forgotten to tell anyone, but Harry is training in America for a while. Not even I know when he will be ready to return. Hopefully it shall be soon, however we will just have to wait and see." He replies with the twinkle still in his eyes. Minerva nodded and left Albus alone to think. This was going to be a long year.
The day he was told he would be going to Japan for five months, was one of the happiest days of his short life. Even being told that it was a specialist school for “Freaks” like him couldn’t dampen his good mood.
"Yea, sorry. This is too weird. I am having a kind of civil conversation with Harry Potter." He chuckled, and Harry laughed a little at that, but before they could continue their conversation there was a knock at the door.
“Where the hell have you been?” Draco asked as Harry changed back into his human form.
“You should go to bed, Dragon.” Narcissa told him, a knowing look in her eyes.
Harry decided to go with what he called the 'Evil Wakeup Call' and this was the first time he was using it. He put up silencing charms around everyone else's beds and woke up Neville first, as he knew Neville was the easiest to wake.
Professor Severus Snape, Potions Master and teacher at Hogwarts, snapped out of his shock when those emerald green eyes looked at him. He swore that he had seen those eyes before, but he just didn't know where. He would figure that out later however, as there was a bigger problem at hand. The 6th year Slytherin boy's dorm was ripped to shreds.
August at the same time. His Uncle was driving them to the airport and should be back any second. The door unlocked and his Uncle trudged to Harry’s cupboard and unlocked it. Grabbing Harry by the scruff of his neck, Vernon dragged his Nephew up the stairs. Harry was dragged into the master bedroom and thrown onto the bed, his uncle walked over to him and punched him in the stomach. Telling Harry to strip Vernon began to remove his own clothes. Harry, who was refusing to do anything he said, just sat on the bed, fully clothed. When Vernon saw this he hit Harry so hard across the face that he was thrown to the floor. Before the teen could get up, Vernon grabbed his hair with one hand and undressed him with the other. Once done the bigger man stood and walked over to the bed to retrieve some handcuffs.
Harry mentally chuckled at the memory, as he was still a cat wearing a hideous Christmas jumper. He knew that they were there when he heard Ron laugh behind him. He turned around, a murderous look in his eyes. Hermione, however, was saying nothing but 'Aww' and telling him that he was going to get Mrs Weasley to knit him some more for next year. Ron seemed to laugh harder (if it were even possible) as the look in his eyes turned from murderous to "help" in less than a second. Once Hermione had finished with the horrible torment she took the jumper off him and Harry turned back into a human. They then settled down to open their presents. Ron and Hermione had told Mrs Weasley about what Dumbledore had said the same day Harry had told them, and she was furious. Luckily she didn't go and talk to Dumbledore though, she just stopped going to order meetings, as did the rest of the family. Once they had finished with their presents they had a talk.
"Mine Professor." Draco Malfoy, his favourite student and godson, spoke up.
When she was at her destination, she went into the potion store and bought a Polyjuice potion. Hiding in an alley, she placed one of her old hairs into the potion and knocked it back. When the potion had taken effect, she walked up to Gringotts as Harry Potter and got out all the money, in muggle currency, she would need. She waited in an alley for the potion to wear off, once it had, she walked through the Leaky Cauldron and onto the street. Once the street was clear, she pulled out her wand and returned to surrey.
the stream of water hit Neville right on his face. Harry laughed as he sat bolt upright and gave Harry a death glare. "Care to help me wake up the others?" Harry asked after he had finished laughing.
"I can't believe that the Weasel and Weaselette managed to afford a familiar. I thought that their family were too poor." Malfoy mocked getting a laugh out of the other boys "Did you notice Potter wasn't at the feast?" He asked no one in particular when the laughing had stopped.
Before he could finish his musing, there was a knock at the entrance to his study. Putting that king grandfatherly look on and the twinkle in his eyes, he took a seat behind his desk and said, "Enter."
Draco Malfoy however was having a great summer. He had come into his got his veela inheritance on his 16th birthday and got his Hogwarts letter last night.
Hadrian had to admit, he was a little disappointed that he may not get to spend Christmas with his family, but he knew that it was necessary to keep them safe.
so were all their friends, including Lily and James. We are your birth mother, Neva’s, parents.”
"I'm Harry." He responded. Harry never got to figure out the names because there was a blinding light and the horse looked up at the sky in shock. There as clouds were six figures. One for each of them. Each of their animal form. When they moved so did the clouds. "That's fucked up." Harry said. Before suddenly with another blinding flash he was back at Sav's house. Apparently Sav saw the flash because she looked down and squealed a little before realising
The first Saturday of the school year Harry was sat under a tree trying to learn some more French. He was taught everyday after school the last year and had approved massively. He was almost fluent. His other school had worked hard on teaching him the language so he could communicate with his peers.
Once he was done with the charms he walked over to Neville's bed and muttered
They got to Kings’ Cross station with almost twenty minutes to spare. Harry was left to collect his stuff by himself. He had been allowed to get a trolly beforehand, so they didn’t have to wait as long. As soon as he was done collecting his belongings and had shut the boot, Petunia drove away. Harry was alone. He felt tears coming to his eyes and shook his head. He swiftly made his way to his platform to see the train already there.
Chapter 6
Putting the notes in their pockets the students went back to eating.
It snapped. Today was her sixteenth birthday. How could she have forgotten? Her birthday was one of the most important times of the year for her. realising that her mother was still talking she tuned back into the conversation. “We’ll need to go shopping, obviously, and… You’re name! How could I forget?”
In the headmaster's office, one Albus Dumbledore was pacing, while muttering to himself, trying to come up with a plan. "The boy is missing, gone from his house near the end of summer. I need to find him before he figures out what he is. That would be disastrous. I need my weapon, I need the child right where I can manipulate him, like Hagrid. He can't be with his people. Either kind. Then he would be to strong."
"Of course Father." Draco said calmly but his excitement on having such an exotic pet was bubbling beneath the surface.
Spark was not what he expected. He was rainbow and made of wool. Apparently he was animated using a charm. The dog was calm and well behaved. Playing with his toys by Sav's feet. However Arlo, Sav's dog, is really giddy and when he came in all hell broke loose. Me and Sav managed to get away undetected and decided she would take me to see her older cousin, Lizzy. We had to floo to Diagon Alley as she works at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. Lizzy was really nice and managed to find out who the magical signature that changed me into… this, belonged to.
Come September, both boys had everything they needed and were packed for their trips. The school just needed a name for who was going to France.
Vivienne awoke with a start, looking at her surroundings trying to figure out why. Leaning back against her pillows, she quickly realised she would be unable to sleep. When she was dressed, she tried to push against the door. Finding it locked, she slumped back on the bed.
"Father, my letter from Hogwarts arrived this morning and the school seemed to think it wise that a new rule be set. I personally love the rule." Draco said as his Father sat on a chair.
An hour later Draco had everything he wanted and so he went back to the manor. He had dinner planned with his mother.
"Minerva, what brings you here. Care for a lemon drop?" He asked waiting for her to begin.
"Why do I have a feeling I will be dressed up like a doll on this trip?" Harry asked trying not to roll his eyes.

Draco Malfoy was looking for his familiar, who had decided it was a good Idea to run off after they had got the jumper on him, when he somehow made it outside. Shrugging his shoulders he made his way to the lake, which was now frozen over. Not many people knew, but Draco Malfoy loved playing in the snow. It reminded him of his childhood, which was not as strict as people think. As a matter of fact, it was the opposite, his parents were laid back, and let him act like a child at home, as long as he acted like a Malfoy in public. As he walked down near the lake, he saw Granger and the Weasel walking along the bank, rolling his eyes Draco was about to go back into the castle when there was a sudden gust of wind and another, black haired, green eyed wizard was reviled. Draco was about to go and mock Potter, when he smelt a smell, that of his mate, with a look of both horror and realisation he watched the golden trio try to find an invisibility cloak. And once they found it Harry Potter vanished once again.
His hands started to become clammy as he gripped onto his broom tighter, scouring his surroundings to see if there were any traces of the golden snitch. He could see Draco near him, sporting a sour look, most likely from the vexatious commentary that had been going on for the whole game.
"No, Pansy, wait out there, I'll be out in a second." Draco tried his best to keep his voice calm but he doubted Pansy would ever be able to suspect something like this. He could imagine the conversation:
It was Draco again.
Draco shook his head, "Oh no, I'm not injured, I just had to assist Potter here." He explained, stepping back.
"No."
Draco gave the tiniest of a shrug before walking off. He spotted Pansy there and knew what he had to do, stalking up to her. "Can I kiss you?"
"Mr Malfoy... Oh, and Potter, how kind of you two to finally show up." Snape glared at the both of them as they stood in the doorway, unnaturally close to each other, their hands almost touching. "This class ended 30 minutes ago. Where were you two?"
Draco had to press his lips together to stop the laugh that threatened to come out; Harry looked cute.
There just didn't seem to be much correlation between the two.
"Look, if you get off me now-" Draco's eyes darted to the side before he lowered his voice so that hopefully only Harry would hear. "I'll give you unlimited kisses once you've drank that potion Snape's making." Draco cringed at the thought of that but Harry immediately perked up, stepping away from Draco who was able to take a breath of relief.
"Well I- Uh, I was– You know..." Harry hopelessly stuttered over every word he could, rubbing the back of his neck.
"Don't smile like that." It was like their roles had switched: Harry being negative and Draco being positive (Shocker!).
That would maybe explain why he was in the library, pretending to look at a book on Goblins whilst trying to eavesdrop into Hermione and Ron's conversation.
His laughter did eventually simmer down and Draco immediately attacked with a question, "Did my kiss really make you that delirious?" Hiding his curiosity with sarcasm.
So Draco was ready to retort an insult, move against Harry one more time to show who was in control, when he felt Harry's hand slide further down, leaving his burning hot stomach and instead venturing to the hem of Draco's boxers. The hands stayed there– sadly, uh no, definitely not sadly, instead gratefully– but Draco would
comfortable Harry had gotten until he heard steady breathing coming from the bed. "Potter?"
"Whoa, Harry, you all right? You're looking a bit red." Ron had already started to dig into his breakfast, his voice coming out muffled by all the food in his mouth. Hermione cringed at Ron's table manners; in fact, the lack of them.
"This essay." Draco held it up, the papers flapping around. "Were you on a broom while writing this? Because it's the worst I've ever seen." He didn't even try to sugar-coat his words, saying it as it was.
Draco didn't know why, but he reached his arm out, his hand ruffling Harry's hair, seeing the smile Harry was trying to fight appear, "No you don't."
Harry paused for so long that Draco was almost about to stand up and shake the words out of him until Harry blurted out, "I fucking like you Draco."
"No!" Draco exclaimed, shaking his head.
Harry nodded. His knee felt normal again.
He couldn't remember much, but his legs had definitely not been quick enough to make it outside before giving up on him... and there was someone else with him.
Gay...?
Draco didn't think that would work, but was ultimately pleased when Harry turned around to face him. "What is it?" Harry roughly asked.
"What do you think?" Draco tilted his head to the side, a movement that clearly said 'of course he was joking'.
Nervous to see Draco again. Since the,
He'd, without a doubt, be furious at me, and fire any insults he could at me. I didn't want to lose him as a friend again.
"Oh, yeah uh–" Harry paused, looking for the right words. He knew Ron would be supportive–hopefully– but he was the first person Harry was coming out to. (Hermione didn't count since she had just had to infer from the fact that he said
"Yeah, yeah." Harry mumbled, rewriting the method.  He could feel Draco's stare on him as he wrote, slightly putting him off, feeling a bit self conscious. "Stop staring at me."
, their one-on-one tutoring would be a 'safe space' as one may call it, so Draco calling Harry
"Ah, well yes, you did it right."
"What was it then? I'm still waiting for answer."
Lies.
Draco turned to face Harry, "Like you?"
Draco's words slipped out in a whisper before he could shut his mouth, so quiet that Harry wasn't able to hear what he had said and pursued with the joke (half) innocently: "Where do I rank then?"
. "–to help me. Not her."
Every time Draco and Harry would have a pointless back and forth argument, Harry would almost feel like pulling his hair out, the frustration overflowing. "You don't bloody need to. I can tell Malfoy, I'm not stupid."
"Mm that's a very low chance." Draco didn't even know why he bothered responding when Harry would just carry on.
But then if she thought back to the interactions between Draco and Harry over the past few months, it began to make sense. She had assumed it was just Harry being nice, seeing the good in everyone, but then Draco had also seemed to tone down on his insults too. He no longer would call Hermione a mudblood, or use every moment he could to make fun of their trio or other people, though he still did have his moments where his ego would get the best of him, but then he would look towards Harry, and Hermione had found that strange, but then something else would be happening and she'd forget all about it.
"Thanks."
Hermione so obviously didn't believe him, her gaze staying on him for an extra second before slowly nodding her head, starting another conversation that Harry didn't listen to again.
Harry shrugged, "Dunno, felt like it."
There, Draco could see Harry and Ron discussing something, Ron turning around once to frown at Draco whilst Harry shook his head. Harry probably would've spent his whole time there if he could've but Snape was truly watching him, threatening to take points off of Gryffindor
Just in case.
just because you like boys, doesn't mean I've got a right to just kiss you whenever I feel like it." Harry was saying all of this sincerely, from the bottom of his heart, so when Draco started to laugh the loudest he'd ever heard, he couldn't understand why. "What did I say that was funny?"
"Yeah, you, you're still feeling vulnerable and me kissing you wouldn't be right. Might confuse you more,
Draco wasn't sure if he really did, but gave a little nod, allowing Harry to continue with the cheeky smile he had on. "You'd be ranked first in my list."
"Don't you have quidditch practise tonight?" The words slipped out before Draco could stop himself. He realised he had just half exposed the fact that he had noted every house's practise time in his head.
"Malfoy." He sneered, seeing Draco at the sink who rolled his eyes in response, walking out of the toilets, but not before bumping his shoulder into Ron's purposefully.
Maybe that would explain where he had gotten the confidence from before.
Harry smiled back at her, nodding, then left the hall to go and find Draco, wondering what game he was playing at.
Draco's ego was already overinflated but this was just the highlight of it all. Seeing Harry look so... powerless. It turned something on in him.
Harry, however, believed it straight away, and being frankly honest, he wasn't willing to dive into deeper terms about what Draco had called him since he had been the one daydreaming about... Draco's bloody hand. (Was he really that horny?)
"Because he doesn't approve of you liking boys?"
A few first years nearly bumped into Draco, giggling, but when Draco took out his anger on them, telling them that if they ever walked into him again, he would cast a stinging jinx on them, they instantly ran away from him, one of them looking on the verge of tears.
Draco hadn't been looking at Harry, slightly embarrassed at what had happened last night, but when he did glance at Harry, he didn't fail to miss the look Harry gave to Jack before turning to him and replying, "Well how about later?"
She folded her arms, staring intensely at him, "What's going on with you?"
"Draco?"
Draco froze, feeling Harry's arms wrap around him; he felt how Harry had felt when he had ambushed him with the kiss from weeks ago. Harry pulled away quickly though, looking into Draco's eyes.
be taken advantage of by Harry of all people?
He couldn't do this.
It was Harry who finally did it, initiating the kiss. He was still a bit shaky on his kissing skills so Draco took control, putting his arms around Harry's neck to bring him closer. Harry's whole body tingled at the feeling of Draco's body against his; it was like a wave of warmth had come over him, suppressing a groan when Draco softly bit his bottom lip. Harry's fingers had started to slip underneath Draco's top when Draco pushed Harry slightly off of him, a grin almost playing on his so-very-appealing lips, "You sure you're still not on the love potion?"
That set Harry off.
"Really Draco? Oh I can't wait Draco. Draco, Draco, Draco, my love, Draco Drac-" Harry had started to bust out into some song and Draco couldn't decide if the song was even worse than Harry trying to forcefully kiss him.
Harry caught on and smiled a smile that made Draco's stomach go all funny. "Swear on my life I won't try anything this time." He held a hand to his heart, watching as Draco's serious expression started to relax.
they had between them anymore, and pulled Harry's head to his, smashing their lips together.
Harry was stuck: stay here with Ginny or go out there with Draco?
"Unless you want more." Harry winked, most definitely as a joke, but it sure made Draco splutter on his words. "I– No, I didn't mean... well, y-you're... Uh, no?"
The rage in Harry was at an all time high. Here Pansy stood, spewing out insults, yet he could do nothing but helplessly watch.
He had to stop, or all he would get at the end of this was a boner, so he instead brought up some more innocent topics. "I could really do with a shower right now... and maybe some treacle tart. Actually, definitely some treacle tart." And when he got no response from Draco, he carried on speaking. "Do you think my team's wondering where I've gone? I didn't tell Hermione or Ron but I'm sure– OH, Ginny! Did you see when she hugged me?"
"Who knows what you'll do? Last time you said you wanted a high five but then gave me a hug instead." Draco purposefully didn't mention what had happened after the hug–neither of them needed that reminder right now.
Who even was he anymore? He had enjoyed kissing a boy
"Why couldn't he have just stayed here with us?" Ron was the one to ask.
So what did Harry's body decide to do?
"I'm joking." Harry did that hearty laugh of his again that made Draco have to bite down on his lip to not smile. "Except for the friends part, I'm serious about that." Harry clarified.
He was probably cold.
"It's not your fault at all." Hermione stood up too, standing in front of Harry so he'd stop walking. "So he really just left you and kissed Parkinson?"
"I went back to Madam Pomfrey, but I'm feeling fine now." Harry could see in Hermione's face that she was hesitating to bring up what had happened yesterday so Harry quickly changed the subject. "Where's Ron then?" Another hangry Ron was not what either of them needed, or wanted, this morning.
"I'm not." Draco's answer came automatically, unable to stop the truth falling out.
happily removed Harry's hands away from his cheeks that were definitely as red as they could be and faced his gaze towards the table, Harry's laugh still ringing in his ears. "Focus on your essay."
Maybe it was the ego, he blamed, that's why it felt nice to have that type of genuine attention from a person. (No other reasons)
"Yeah." Harry cringed, thinking back about the memory. It had never been confirmed, and he had always hoped against it, that Pansy and Draco were a thing, but they were perfect for each other.
"Uh no, it's okay. I still feel a bit sick."
Ron actually looked offended, going on a rant about why he should've been Harry's first 'boy crush' not moody Malfoy, and Hermione disproving Ron's claims whilst Harry was still thinking about his wand.
"Why is that?"
harry and draco navigate through their unstable relationship.
job, not Harry's. Draco had no thoughts for an articulate or taunting response back, instead blubbering out a, "Wha-?" and watching as Harry smiled shyly, in an innocent manner though he was far from innocent.
Draco swore at himself in his head; something he had been doing a lot these days.
so because i'm writing in third person, it seems like harry is calling draco by his first name in his thoughts but he still refers to draco by "malfoy". it's just so i don't have to switch from draco to malfoy ( and vice versa with harry and potter ) depending on whose 'thoughts' it's in.
Harry scoffed and shook his head again, going to turn around until Draco stopped him, telling him to wait. The roles they were in were so like yesterday's; Harry running away from Draco this time.
"Why are you upset over that? It's none of your business; it's not like I had a hissy fit every time you and Weaslette were together." Draco knew this was a lie; he had hated every moment Harry and Ginny had been together, always looking for a way to separate them, but not everything needed to be verbalised.
The smile came back on Harry's face; he really did love Ron. "Right then, let's go." He nodded, following Ron out.
He had appeared fine last night, except when Draco had shut down his excitement, but apart from that, they had joked about quidditch.
Harry seemed tense, flinching when the door shut again, and muttered a hello that was barely audible.
had just seemed the easiest thing to do.
"I don't know, I was just thinking. Less stress maybe."
"What?" Was Harry going mad?
"Draco."
Harry, taking this as a sign of rejection, looked down at the ground. "Sorry, I don't even know why I–"
Harry shook his head, "It's alright. I can tell y–" He was in the middle of speaking when Snape turned around so quickly that it felt like Harry could feel the whiplash.
"It wasn't my fault you were late." Draco calmly interrupted.
Hermione stayed quiet, staring at me intensely as if she was casting Legilimency on me which I prayed she couldn't do. "What's on your mind? Maybe I can help." She kindly offered, but just like yesterday, there was nothing Hermione could do to help me.
"It doesn't look like a bruise." She leaned in to see if she could inspect it at a closer view, but Ron interrupted, thank Merlin, and pushed her gently back to her seat. "Alright, I think that's enough."
"Yeah." Was all Harry responded, far-away in his thoughts.
"No, but I will."
"I'm not irritated."
Harry, though, was rendered still in his spot as Draco's words repeated in his head.
"That's an obvious lie." Harry stood in front of Draco who didn't look up at him. Harry bent down, questioning himself on why he cared so much if Draco was okay or not but he pushed that thought aside.
"Wow. Maybe I can actually do decent in these exams now–" Harry pretended to wipe the non-existent sweat off of his forehead.
"Where'd you learn how to do that?" The words came out before Harry could properly think them through.
Nevertheless, Harry didn't appear to deep what Draco had said and instead smiled, seeming gratified at Draco knowing his timetable. "Oh yeah, forgot about that. I guess I'll do it after practise, but thanks for reminding me."
"They already know." Draco stated without a care. Harry, however, froze, taking in Draco's words. They knew? Draco was that comfortable to tell them about this? Draco must've seen Harry's expression and spoke again, "Why do you look so shocked?"
"And you're a Gryffindor. Are we just naming salient things that we already know or-?" Draco riled Harry on, laughing internally at the way Harry's eyes squinted at him, as if he couldn't believe Draco had to have a second thought on who he would pick between Harry and Jack.
He was cuddling with someone, (maybe Ginny, but they had no boobs?), inhaling in a sweet cinnamon smell as the person pressed back into him. The slight friction against him quickly sent a wave of pleasure down to his groin as he moved a bit, slowly grinding into the person's-
Hermione nodded in response and waved goodbye.
His cheeks were flushed, his hair as messy as usual... What Draco would do to run his hands throu-
"He'll be here later, so now he's gone, we can talk about you and Ginny." Hermione smiled, her whole expression brightening.
"Hm." Harry had a million questions more to ask– but then Draco was shuffling closer to him– and he forgot all about them and if that wasn't enough, Harry felt Draco's fingers curl into his and stay there. "Uh Draco–" Harry began to say, unsure if Draco was aware of what he was doing.
Realising what he was thinking, Draco turned away, cursing at himself.
Number one: he wasn't dumb, and could obviously see that it was hurting Harry to just remain friends, no matter how easily he tried to brush it off, and number two, he was going against his father's clear words:
"Come on, why can't I know?"
, not
"Do you think I'm an evil person?" Draco whispered, barely audible.
A note was in his hands as he reread it over many times, having come from his father. It read:
Harry let his eyes wander back over to where Draco was and saw that Draco was already looking at him. Draco mouthed something along the lines of 'you shall play too knight' before looking away, leaving Harry to decipher what he was saying; did he want them to play Quidditch... or maybe chess?
They really shouldn't.
"The, you know– Er... the beetles?" Harry guessed hopelessly, knowing he'd failed horribly when Draco lightly smacked his own forehead. "I am listening, I swear I was just... thinking."
"Yeah, him. Couple years ago, the song would play every day, at the exact same time: 5PM on the dot." Harry had a faraway look in his eyes, a smile that didn't quite look happy on his face. "Anyways, you okay?" He snapped out of his daze, glancing back down at Draco.
"Stay." Draco breathed out after a few seconds; the intense connection between their eyes being too much, causing Draco to step away again. Harry almost seemed disappointed, but Draco brushed it off as his hopeful imagination.
"–and they all have some kind of superiority complexes." Harry carried on, clearly ready to list all the negative things Draco had said about the other house.
What were the point of these labels? They just further confused his already jumbled up mind.
"Where were you last night? Ron said you’d vanished." Hermione asked as Harry speedily searched for an excuse that Hermione wouldn't be able to sense was a lie.
"No, and it's not a date. I don't even know if he likes boys." Harry wasn't looking at Draco, still trying to figure out the game with his thumbs because if he was, he would've seen the disapproval on Draco's face shown by his scowl.
Draco spotted Harry's indecisiveness and understood he needed to answer or Harry would bolt out on him at any second. "What's in it for me?"
"No, I wanted help." Harry could see how clouded his judgement was but he was desperate. He was sure Hermione suspected there was something else that was causing him to do this and of course, she was right.
Harry smiled in return and stepped forward, reaching his hand out and using his thumb to caress Draco's lips, like he was wiping away the smile. "Why do you have to be so bloody attractive?" He whispered, but stepped back just as quick, leaning against the tree as if he hadn't just done what he'd done.
"That knee needs to be rested so I suggest you go back to your room. Don't overexert it, or yourself. You shouldn't be in any pain, but I do have some pain-relieving potions if you need them."
"I think I saw Madam Hooch looking for you,
Draco's lip curled in disgust, shaking his head. "Why would you ever waste your time thinking about what it would be like to be a powerless creature like them?"
"Fuck." Draco sat on his bed, next to Harry, but didn't dare slip under the covers.
And Draco was allowing it.
"Nearly." Was Snape's short answer, but nearly was still too long.
Inside, Hermione was delighted that she hadn't had to kiss someone who she saw more as a brother, but she also felt for Harry who looked distraught. "I don't fully understand why you wanted to kiss me in the first place."
"You're going to be the death of me." Draco could've pulled his wand out, cast any spell he wanted to on Harry, but he didn't, and slowly, but surely, joined his lips to Harry's, leaning up against him. Harry froze for barely a second, causing Draco to believe that maybe Harry really had gotten over his feelings, until he felt Harry's lips moving back against his and Harry wrapping his arms around Draco's neck, pulling Draco closer. Draco had no idea why he was doing this, it wouldn't end well, but when Harry's hands moved to his hair, running them through it, stopping didn't seem so appealing.
"But I want to know." Harry insisted.
Draco didn't respond back for a few seconds before replying with, "So he prefers me over you then?"
Draco finds comfort in the brown haired boy's presence.
"Just shut up, okay? It
The parchment though flowing in magic, lacked any sort of affection. Draco had tried to read between the lines and find any sign that his father cared, but there was none. Not even the signing of his initials at the end helped.
Draco silently agreed then suddenly remembered what Snape's message to him had been. "I have to tutor you. Snape says your grades aren't sufficient enough for the O.W.L. Exams."
Draco rolled his eyes but didn't say anything more. Harry was really making this whole
He hadn't heard one thing they had said, their conversations always seemed to zoom straight past his ears these days. Their faces were still expectant, waiting for an answer that Harry didn't have. "Uh– yes?" Ron and Hermione's heads both tilted to the side slightly, which would've been a bit creepy if it weren't for the fact that he had definitely not answered rightly. "What did you say?"
"But..." She started to speak but Draco zoned out her voice, searching for that one Gryffindor.
That was the thing with Harry: always finding a way to make Draco flustered when it was supposed to be
"Well–"
Harry's voice was dripping with lust as he connected their lips again, this time kissing him gently, but with even more passion than before. Harry felt Draco's smile against his lips and started to smile too, the kiss going a bit sloppy, yet neither of them cared about that, just happy to be in each other's presence.
Something like lovers.
Draco stayed out of the hall, replaying the way Harry's smile had somehow managed to brighten up his whole day.
Harry was so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't even realised Ron and the others had come back until Ron's voice popped up in the silence. "Hey Harry, you coming to dinner?" Harry's curtains were closed, thank God, so Ron didn't see the way Harry's cheeks reddened.
"Ginny."
The class started to empty out, Ron and Hermione taking their time to leave. "What's wrong with him?" Ron questioned Hermione as Snape turned his back to them.
It was like Harry had taken a sleeping draught, simply rolling into the middle of the bed when Draco shook him. Draco decided he was being too gentle and lightly slapped Harry's cheek, receiving a better reaction.
Yet there was still no reply.
"No, no!" Harry denied too eagerly, causing Hermione to raise a brow at him; it was just a simple yes or no question. "I mean," Harry took his tone done a notch. "I'm fine, why?"
"Your lips are so irresistible." Draco dreamily gazed at them, the anger in him slowly dissipating. He was finally able to see a reaction from Harry, though it was one more of horror and confirmation that he had once again messed up. "Please for the love of Salazar, don't say that I've brewed another love potion."
." Draco lied. Couldn't she just take the hint and leave?
or thought about whilst reading those books had made Draco feel very hot inside... and, well, he may have just nodded to everything that Harry had asked, thereby leading to this potion that was definitely not brewed correctly. Draco could feel Snape's eyes burning into him and cautiously took a sip of the potion, Harry's concerned eyes watching his every move. "I feel–"
Draco was shaken out of his thoughts, looking into the worried eyes of Harry who had come much closer than he was before. "Are you alright? You're starting to go a bit pale– Well, paler than usual." Harry let out a little chuckle at his own joke but Draco didn't join in, not even a rolling of his eyes. Harry's laugh quickly died down seeing he was the only one
"I need help."
Draco's eyes grew to the size of buttons as he didn't know whether to be disgusted or shocked at Harry's personal question. "What the fuck? No! I'm not going to tell you that."
Except at night, when he's alone.
Harry wanted to hide under the table and never come out- he didn't know what to say to Hermione about that, but luck was on his side as Ron butted in, scrunching his face up in annoyance. "Hold on, why are you looking at his lips?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't like–"
Ginny immediately perked up, all her stories flashing to mind straight away. "Unfortunately yes, you'll never believe what she said to this girl in my year..." She started to explain, using gestures to get her story across even more.
But then the moment was over as quickly as it had begun, the place becoming near silent again, only the remnant sounds of Draco chuckling. "What was so funny then?" Harry finally asked when Draco had come down from his laughter high.
And Draco of all boys.
Harry quickly spun to see Pansy with her wand pointed towards him but before he could even say anything, Pansy had cast another spell, this time an "
Harry felt the mortification rush through him as he forced his voice to stay in control, not wanting to alert Ron. "Yeah, it's fine. Honestly. I should've paid more attention."
"Is your father a part of your dating life?" When Draco didn't reply straight away with a 'No', Harry knew his question hadn't been interpreted correctly.
"But why him?" Ron turned around to look towards the Slytherin table, giving Draco a glare when he saw him looking back. "He's so... He's so Malfoy. Were there no other boys you could've liked? Surely I'm a better match than Malfoy."
"And I'm not gay." Draco completely ignored Harry's other remark, causing Harry to frown.
"I need you to teach me how to kiss." He blurted out.
Hermione nodded and sat down next to Ron who had come early, claiming he was feeling especially eager today.
"Madam Pomfrey's there for a reason, ask her."
"We'll see Malfoy. Whichever house wins is the better house." Harry proposed to which Draco nodded his head. "Okay, fine."
Harry nodded, but didn't say any more.
wanted to give him a chance."
"You made quite a delightful song, actually. How did it go again?"
Draco was going to confess his feelings to Harry.
"Full of questions today, aren't you?" Draco spoke under his breath. "I called Potter four times and you didn't answer."
"Merlin Harry, are you okay?" She extended out a hand that he gladly took, standing up and nodding back at her, leaning on one leg slightly. "I can take you to Madam Pomfr–" She had started to offer when Draco came from behind Harry, grabbing his arm.
"I feel sick." Draco fibbed, watching as Harry's eyes snapped to him, the book long forgotten. "What's wrong?"
in the original fic, this chapter is called hair gel but I changed quite a lot so of course, the name had to change too. anyways, enjoy reading!
Harry slowly reached his hand out, waiting for a trademark Draco insult, maybe to tell him to go away, but Draco didn't say anything, too distracted by something unknown to Harry. Harry's hand gently held Draco's chin, turning his face to his own, seeing Draco's tear stained cheeks. "Are you... crying?"
Bisexual...?
Draco looked down at Harry's hand on his arm and for a second, his expression softened before a memory flashed in his eyes, and he snatched his arm away from Harry. "Don't touch me."
Whilst Hermione projected her elation, I glanced over at the Slytherin table, catching Malfoy laughing at something Parkinson was saying. Seeing Malfoy laugh was a rare occasion. It was almost...
Now that wasn't what he was expecting Harry to say next. "Friends?"
"No."
"Right, I remember what I said thanks–"
Staring at him talking to the Jack guy.
"Potter wait up." Draco called from behind, but Harry did the opposite, speeding up. "Potter!"
"We ran into each other." Draco quickly intervened, knowing where Harry's sentence was going.
He had no idea what he wanted, but one thing he knew that he
They would have no excuse anymore, both of them were fully aware of that, but Draco still leaned in.
Snape eventually realised the silence and glanced up to see Harry holding onto Draco's arm, almost like he was tipsy. "Potter! Completely inappropriate behaviour in my class." Snape stomped over to them, looking into the cauldron, and immediately recognising the distinct mother-of-pearl sheen. He was about to tell Harry off again, but knew there to be no point since the boy was so obviously not in the right headspace to be getting lectured, so he turned and faced the rest of the class' beady eyes. "Class dismissed early. Either head back to your common rooms or wait silently for your next class. Leave your homework on my desk." Snape ordered, adding an extra "now" when people were still staring at Harry running his hand through Draco's hair.
harry gives draco an impossible offer that he decides to accept, making harry’s life that much more difficult.
"Potter."
"No, I want you to say it in words."
" Belonging to the one and only Pansy Parkinson.
For the majority of the morning, Harry had been completely out of it, occasionally dozing off before being woken up by Hermione shaking him. He had spent the rest of the night thinking of Draco and he was paying the price for it as he tried to focus on the words falling out of Hermione's mouth.
"Right then, amuse me."
"So you haven't then."
so just to clear things up, i am the author of this book from wattpad but i decided to modify and improve my previous writing so this still goes by the plot of the wattpad one, but there may be aspects that are added or taken out. in addition, in this chapter, it may seem like harry is calling draco by his first name in his 'thoughts' and vice versa, but it was just to make it less confusing so i wouldn't have to switch from Malfoy to Draco or Potter to Harry so they still refer to each other by their last names. If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry ahah.
Harry started to slowly move his lower half against Draco's, which reminded Draco of a night that he couldn't explicitly remember, but when Harry began to take Draco's shirt off, he no longer wanted, or cared, to remember what had happened that night. Harry pulled away, trailing his fingers down Draco's chest, sending shivers through his spine.
"I've seen that you and Draco are becoming quite friendly. Is there something more going on there?" Pansy didn't let Harry have time to disagree and contributed on with her insinuation. "Is the chosen one in love with Draco?" Her tone was drunk with sarcasm, her scowl attacking Harry.
that automatically locked the door. (Just in case.)
"I don't want to take advantage of you." Harry explained.
The sound of his name coming out from Hermione's mouth snapped Harry back into reality as he came face to face with a sighing Hermione and a confused Ron.
"Thank you." He genuinely thanked her as she nodded, smiling and sitting back down to carry on studying.
enjoy :) ty for the kudos'
And started to laugh at Harry who shook his head before burying his face in his hands, "You're never gonna let me live that down, are you?"
Harry paced back and forth in the library as Hermione watched on, occasionally looking down at her work then glancing back up to still see a restless Harry moving around.
Harry sheepishly shrugged off the cloak, noticing that Draco didn't make any move to turn around, increasing his confusion even more. "How did you know it was me?"
There were no good reasons that Harry could give to convince the Slytherin. Even he, a Gryffindor, would be entirely confused if Draco one day came strolling up to him and asked for a kiss.
"But whatever happens, I'm here for you. You know that?" Harry put his hand over Draco's. "You'll never be alone and if he even tries anything, I'll be there like... like your knight in shining armour." Harry laughed at the thought.
"Please don't."
"Why'd I have to make what so noticeable?"
the other small fact of him accidentally drugging himself.
There was a voice in Draco's head telling him to say no, just a couple of days had already gotten Draco's mind in panic mode but his body spoke first as he nodded. "That's sounds good."
Draco sat leaning against the wall, looking at the boy who laid his head in his lap.
Before Harry could reply, a looming figure stood over them. Harry didn't even bother to raise his head, knowing he had once again fucked up.
Draco felt the need to ask what he had heard but remembered that with all the nonsense Harry had been speaking that time he was on the love potion, it was no surprise Snape had come up with his own conclusions.
"You always say I'm frowning. " Draco couldn't even count the endless times he had heard Harry tell him to smile, though there was really no need for him to say that; Harry always eventually found a way to crack the scowl on his face.
Draco, the boy who would gladly jump to the side of anyone who would go against Harry and find pleasure in it.
Fuck.
"–minutes late so that'll be ten points off of Gryffindor and since you're at the front of the class, I presume you'll be able to hand in your homework now." Snape held out his hand towards a sheepish Harry who had started to fidget, trying to find the right words to say under Snape's intense stare.
"So I don't care about what anyone thinks?" Harry nodded to confirm his question. "Then I'd say sure."
"But he's so... he- I don't want him near me." Draco knew he was whining, and with no response from Snape, he reluctantly stopped running and stayed in one place, Harry automatically catching up to him, standing by his side. Harry grabbed Draco's hand, squeezing it tightly then let go to cup Draco's cheeks. "Can I kiss you again? I really really really really want to."
Draco had an urge to touch Harry's hair; just once would be enough, so he slowly ran his fingers through Harry's hair, making sure that Harry didn't wake up. What would he say then? 'My hands accidentally slipped and ended up in your hair.' Even someone as dense as Harry wouldn't believe that for a second. Yet these thoughts didn't stop Draco who let his fingers gently slide down Harry's cheeks, stopping at his plump lips. Draco pushed the temptation to just kiss Harry senselessly, give him those unlimited kisses that he had promised, but as soon as that thought ran through his mind, he automatically felt dirty at himself, snatching his hand away from Harry's face too abruptly that Harry's eyes started to flutter open.
