“Good to see both of you,” Ms. Trelawney said “For detention, you’ll be cleaning the 1st year's crystal balls since you both care so little for them”
“Father I’m sorry, I will try better next time” Lucius angrily scrunched up the piece of paper with Draco's grade on it. “What are you trying to do boy? Ruin the Malfoy name!?”
She fixed her glasses and headed to the door, turning around before exiting “Hurry up and start, you don’t want to be here all night do you?”
Thoughts were pilling into Draco's head and he was surely going to explode, he almost revealed himself to Harry, his worst enemy, it didn't matter that he was good looking, Harry wasn't gay and he wouldn't understand. No one could understand his coping mechanism.
“Absolutely not!” Hermione said shocked “He's 15. The dark lord would never recruit somebody that young.”
Draco moved closer to Harry expecting him to move back "Aren't you scared that I might push you off?" Draco asked. Harry stared at him blankly "Aren’t you scared that I’ll push you?” he replied. Draco let out a short laugh “I wouldn’t care if you did” he mumbled as he put his cigarette out and grabbed another.
Draco let out a loud sigh of frustration, putting his head in his hands “Why do you always try and meddle in things that shouldn’t be messed with?” Draco violently screamed.
“Did you have a nice sleep, Harry?” Hermione asked but the annoyed look on her face showed she wasn’t that interested. Ron and Hermione probably had another one of their fights.
Suddenly out of nowhere Draco's arm starting to burn. He held down on it, trying to stop the pain but he couldn’t. He fell onto the floor, and curled up into a ball, letting out  painful whimpers. He was ashamed of himself, but the pain was too intense.
//BEFORE I START, NO I AM NOT DEAD, I WAS JUST EXTREMELY BUSY WITH SCHOOL EXAMS. I’M BACK NOW THOUGH//
Harry nodded and turned the book to page 201. He pointed his wand at the white ball in the middle of the table then at Draco's head “praeteritum” he said clearly.
Draco opened the door to his class with caution, fearful of Ms. Trelawney's reaction to his tardiness. However, when he looked around only half of his class were seated. Draco soon realized he was early. He sighed looking around the room. He kept his head toward the floor and took his seat furthest away from the rest of the class. After a bitter-sweet 10 minutes, the rest of the class joined and Ms. Trelawney began to speak “Ah, Welcome! First, let’s put you into pairs for our upcoming assignment!” She fixed her big round glasses and pointed towards the pairs,
Draco stalked the corridors trying to keep his mind off his negative thoughts. He let out a deep sigh when he walked up to the dining room doors. He stepped inside and looked around (deciding whether he was going to breakfast or not). Mistakenly, Draco made eye contact with Harry. As soon as Harry saw Draco he got up from his seat. Draco frowned at the obnoxiously nosey Gryffindor and walked out.
The cold air was relentless against his pale skin, causing goosebumps to appear. Draco reached into his pocket as he fumbled around for his lighter and the stick he knew well. Draco shivered as he pressed the lifeless cigarette to his chapped lips. He brought his other hand to his mouth as a way of sheltering the cigarette from the wind. The flickering light illuminated his otherwise hidden nicotine-stained teeth and blue, silver eyes; eyes corrupted by loss and pain. The toxic smoke danced around him and expanded into beautiful wisps of vapor before disappearing in front of him. The slight head-rush feeling helped numb him from his toxic thoughts. He stayed fixated on the smoke as he pulled another drag. Draco was infatuated with distracting himself with his pain, so much so that he flirted with death on a regular basis. It was unfortunate that he chose this addiction instead of a more harmless one because he knew this was just another addiction would follow him to his grave. The stick grew shorter with each drag and Draco felt a slight burn against his fingertips before he extinguished the flame. Draco pulled another out of the pack and quickly lit it.
The silent halls of Hogwarts were a welcome contrast to the noisy affairs back at the feast. He much preferred to be alone away from the prying eyes and whispered insults that were constantly thrown at him. His mind kept traveling back to the empty seat and found himself walking faster. He wasn't sure where he was going but wherever he ended up he needed to get there faster. He needed to get there now. He needed to, he stopped in the middle of the hallway, he needed to breathe. His chest tightened up, he couldn't seem to get air into his lungs. No, he couldn't do this here. To his right were some classrooms that he hadn't been in for a few years, and to his left, conveniently located, were the men's bathrooms. He heard voices behind him and panicked. It felt like all the walls were closing in on him, and he quickly tore into the bathrooms ripping off his cloak and dropping it on the floor. His breathing came harsh and heavy and panic clouded every sense. He splashed water on his face and yanked at his tie desperate to get some air. He stared into the sink where drops of water fell from the tips of his hair and made satisfying plink noises onto the porcelain.
Draco kicked the wall angrily and let out a loud sigh. “Just leave me the fuck alone,” he yelled as he brought his fist to the wall, drawing blood.
I'm back. After 3 years or so I will be finally be finishing this fic. I'm just getting started, so be prepared for a long story.
The door slammed shut. Draco kept his head on the desk, not moving. Harry anxiously rubbed his arm and walked over to him, “We should start…”
Unbeknown to him, Harry was following closely behind him. Draco walked into the bathroom and splashed water on his face trying to calm himself down. Harry snuck into the bathroom and observed the boy. Draco carefully pulled down his robe so his shoulder was exposed. He took his wand out and held it against his bare shoulder, whispering a spell
Harry sighed and grabbed a few crystal balls, placing them carefully on his desk and cleaning them. After 10 minutes, Harry started to observe Draco, he wasn’t acting like his   normal snarky self and that was when Harry noticed Draco silently sniffing.
“I will if you show me your wrists,” Harry said, determined to find out if he had the Dark Mark, I mean it only made sense. His father was a Death Eater.
Harry smiled and rested his hand on Draco's sleeve, he was starting to wonder if the Draco he knew was the real Draco. Because now, when they were alone he felt more close then ever. He didn't care if he had the Dark Mark, if he didn't want to work for Voldemort then he was no different to Snape. Right?
“None of your business, Scar-head,” Draco replied aggressively as he turned the tap on and splashed water on his face.
Draco angrily sneered back “Give me a fucking second”. The banging immediately stopped when they released it was Draco Malfoy who was inside. He carefully stood up, using the sink as a crutch. He was feeling unusually dizzy. Draco picked up his lighter and smuggled it into his pocket. He put on his mask and as he opened the door he shoved past the annoyed Slytherins with a face saying ‘try me’.
Before Draco could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit by the Cruciatus curse. The pain was intense and all-consuming. Draco no longer knew where he was, white-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain; he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life.
“If you have nothing to hide then why can’t you show me?” Harry said watching the boy explode in anger, Draco always looked so put together at school, and it was more than a little rattling to see him like this, but Harry expected this. After all, he just found out that he was a Death Eater.
He stumbled to the mirror and let out a tear as he looked at his reflection. He hated himself. Draco fell to the floor in a mess. He started to indulge himself in his negative thoughts and brought his hands to his face to hide his weakness. The door swung open, loudly and swiftly as Harry stepped into the room. Draco quickly stumbled to his feet and used his hands to flatten his robes. “What do you fucking want Potter?” Draco said angrily, closing his fists. Harry, analyzed Draco's body language and took a step back “I wanted to talk about yesterday…” Harry couldn’t finish his sentence before Draco knocked past him- pushing him into the wall.
“Show me your wrists or I will tell Dumbledore that you have the Dark Mark, you’ll go straight to Azkaban”
Both Harry and Draco are 15 years old. There will never be smut in this fanfiction so if you're here for that then this isn't the place. There will be fluff.
“No, but he refused to show me his arm, I’m sure he’s hiding something under there and if it's not a Dark Mark, then what?”
Harry kept the wand there for the required 3 seconds before removing it. He turned to the ball and watched as shadows started to form. Draco stared wide-eyed at the ball, desperate for it to turn into someone uneventful. He caught the eye of his father holding a whip and knew he had to do something before Harry saw.
“I've changed my mind. I'm not doing this bullshit” Draco snapped with anger as he stood up and smacked the ball onto the floor, smashing it to pieces.
His mind was going a thousand miles an hour as he reached into his trunk and grabbed a joint. He carefully avoided making noise as he slipped past the sleeping Slytherins and popped into the main bathroom. He leaned against the wall and allowed himself to fall to the floor. He fumbled around in his pocket for his lighter. He knew marijuana counted as a muggle drug but he didn’t care. In truth, he didn’t
Draco felt his sleeve getting wet and he quickly realized the blood had soaked through. He needed to get out of here now. If Potter were to find out about his coping mechanism he would be ridiculed. “Give me my wand, Potter,” Draco said trying to keep his voice stable.
Harry shook his head “Whatever, I’ll get proof. I’ll show you both,” he said as he left the hall. They didn't believe him but he knew he was right. They hadn’t seen the way he acted. He was so secretive and acted so out of character. Draco even looked ashamed.
He glared over at her “Shut up. My life, not yours.” Draco said in a dangerously low voice. Pansy stopped talking and returned to eating and Draco soon fled the room.
Draco was sitting on the roof in the highest point of Hogwarts, dangling his feet off the edge. He reached into his pockets and grabbed his box of cigarettes, he only had 5 left in the pack.
Draco and Harry aren't going to be nice to each other at first because they are still enemies at this point, and they have to warm up to each other.
"Thought you quit," Harry said as he appeared from the window behind Draco and sat next to him. Draco opened one of his eyes- looking at Harry before closing it and taking in another breath. "It's just one," Draco replied in a defeated tone.
Harry speedily walked out of the class, accidentally jump-scaring Draco. Draco flinched at the sudden movement. Harry recognized that flinch. It was the flinch he knew all too well. The flinch that you only develop from long-term abuse. Harry eyed him for a second before he was slammed into the wall behind him (for the second time today). “What do you want from me, Potter? Why do you keep staring at me?” Draco spat, annoyed he was under Harry's surveillance. Harry gently pushed Draco's shoulder to get him off and Draco let out a small whimper of pain. Harry had unknowingly pressed right against a fresh bruise. Draco immediately dropped Harry's collar and grabbed onto his own shoulder. “Oh come on, Malfoy. I barely hit you!” Harry jokingly teased, hoping to improve the unsettling encounter. Draco wiped the look of pain off his face and sneered at him “Leave me alone Potter.” he snapped before hurrying off to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
That was fast! well hopefully they will all be fast because i have just set the ridiculously outrageous goal to complete the entire second half of this fic by January 8th. (spoiler alert idk if ima make it) but goals are fun! even the hard ones like posting 20 chapters in the span of three months! hahaha well here goes nothing!
“We can't, as far as I know, it's not possible. I suppose if we knew what he saw we might have a better chance understanding at least but again.”
this is very much a project I love working on, its an idea that's been around my head for years now and its all coming together on paper so now all that's left is to see how you enjoy it! please let me know your opinions!
It was fairly a straightforward plan. As plans of his could go. It was at least better than “don’t die, don’t get anyone killed” though that was just as much a part of this plan as any other, he tacked on a silent ‘or worse expelled’ that seemed to be a running theme year after year as well.
Summer at the Dursleys was not a vacation. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t just stay at the castle during the wretched two months in between classes. But he was over whining about it. Dumbledore would only spew more bullshit about how it was the safest place for him until he turned 18. That was a load of crap. Harry would dare to say he’d be safer in Voldemort’s grip than spending one more summer with his Aunt and Uncle.
While deep in thought Harry had snuck into the bathroom and retrieved a pile of Petunia's fluffy white towels. Harry lowered himself to his knees on the floor next to the bed, or rather, mattress on the floor. He had had a bedframe once. In truth, he couldn’t remember how it had broken. Just that he no longer had one. He sat back on his heels and assessed the damage with unattached emotion. He peeled the fabric of Malfoy’s shirt away from the wound.
He looked awful. Merlin, he looked awful. His skin was paler then Draco’s making his scar stand out, looking red and angry against the ghostly white he looked. His hair was just as messy as always but it looked limp and the usual shine was gone. And he was so terribly thin. Draco's stomach churned. Harry Potter looked like a fucking corpse.
“Harry!” Hermione was shouting at him, he realized only now that she had been for some time. He was slumped over half-leaning on Ron, and his scar was on fire. “Harry!” Hermione knelt in front of him trying to regain his attention. He groaned. The images were still clear to him now. He was more desperate than ever to get back to Hogwarts.
Sure he hated the boy. He was so smug all the time and he wasn’t even a pureblood. There was nothing about Harry Potter that should have him walking around like he was the epitome of all things good. Potter didn’t know what ‘good’ meant.
He trudged up the driveway and struggled to open the door. There were quite a many obstacles he was trying to negate while doing so, a mental checklist was running through his head.
“Please, let me help you,” he said. Anger welled up from somewhere deep in Draco. The chair blurred in his vision, the red roses bleeding together until again all he could see was red.
The common room was almost empty only a few seventh years looked up when he entered. He shot a glare at them and they both quickly went back to what they were doing. Being the prince of Slytherin did have its perks he thought as he made his way to the dormitories. The dormitories which should have been empty. And was save for one figure lounged out on Draco's bed. Draco was too tired to be rightfully angry.
When he caught up Dumbledore continued talking as if there hadn’t been a pause, “I need to convince an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and fill our missing spot on the staff list” Right. The defense against the dark arts position.  The one that never could stay filled.
Now the room served a more important purpose. A place for the Dark Lord to gather his followers, of which Draco was one, or more accurately, would be one.
“Damned shame I missed him. The whole Black family in green and silver except Sirius. I would have liked the set” Horus said sighing, oblivious to the fist Harry was making around his wand.
it.” Harry felt nauseous. “Whoever it was, I thought they deserved it. But then someone interrupted, someone I knew and it surprised me enough to see them that Voldemort noticed I was there and severed the connection.” Harry wasn’t meeting Ron's eyes. He waited for his friend to say something, anything would be good enough for him but Ron sat there considering for endless minutes.
The burrow was tall, leaning slightly, and warm-looking. He trudged his way to it, having been left in the swampy marsh around the house. Left by Dumbledore. Every step felt heavy with weight Harry should have grown used to by now. Every step felt wrong in this place he was usually so comfortable in.
He was standing alone for a minute, but he already knew something about his appearance seemed different, happier. He was wearing a red t-shirt and muggle jeans, and the pale skin on his left arm was clean. The mark was no longer there. The mark that now itched under the sleeve of his shirt. He almost thought that was it. That his deepest desire was simply not to be marked. However, a figure was walking up behind his reflection. Their face was blurred at first but in his soul, Draco knew, just like he always knew that everything in his life would always come down to this. And sure enough, his face came into focus, framed by messy dark hair, and he was smiling. Harry Potter was in the mirror, and he was laughing and pushing at Draco. They were happy together, and the Harry in front of him entwined his fingers with Draco and he wished so much that he could be that Draco.
Just as the curtains in front of him were ripped apart Draco’s vision began to fade. The last thing he heard was the shocked sounding ‘Draco?’ before the world slipped away.
“Are you done now?” he asked, hating the way his voice came out choked. The redhead said nothing and Draco took it to mean yes. Draco pushed past Weasley and started out the door.
“You're not him,” Ron said after a few more tense moments. “The scar connects you physically but you're nothing like him. You're just feeling what he’s feeling. You can’t control what he's feeling when you see through his eyes” Harry considered this. The logic was sound enough. It didn't make him feel much better though.
Ron was of course still asleep. Harry didn’t wake him up as Mrs. Weasly had told him he could. Instead, he saw the empty bed and fell into it fully clothed.
“Oh all right” A voice called behind them, Dumbledore wore a small self-satisfied smile and Harry turned to see Horace had followed them out into the street. “I’ll do it”
“I wouldn't mind.” it came out a whisper. And he flinched away from the glare his godfather shot at him.
. Harry thought dryly and fought the urge to roll his eyes. He was caught off guard however when Horace pointed at him and
“Sir, I really wish you would reconsider surely if he's willing to take it that means he's telling the truth isn't that enough, can’t you trust him now?”
It felt like an eternity. It felt too short watching the faceless boy writhe under his curse. But he stopped the spell. Watching the boy panting and trying feebly to crawl away. The laugh that came out of Harry's mouth was sickening.
He heard her again and he tripped over his own feet, falling backward on his arse. Her voice was so quiet now. He craned his neck to look for her, to look up at her. For a moment he could see her, standing above him. And then she was gone and Draco was decidedly going mad.
Part of Harry wanted the wound to automatically heal itself before his eyes. Then Malfoy would wake up and apparate away and Harry could be left with the consequences of trying to have him in peace. But not even madam Pomfrey's potions could work that fast.
Emotion over what, though? He’s seen terrible things before, hell he's done terrible things, and never bat an eye. Over potter? No. Potter is his worst enemy, was his worst enemy. Sorrow bloomed in Draco's chest as he revised his thoughts. Was not is. Was, no longer his enemy. He shook his head of the thought trying to erase the words from existence. It is a particularly sad word, isn't it? ‘Was’ meaning the end of something, looking back at something that isn't anymore. Like a relationship, an event, or a life. Like Harry’s life. Harry's life that Draco didn't care about.
“This must be hard for you, I know,” for the second time that day Draco's limbs moved without permission. Without thinking Draco brushed everything that was sitting on the ornate desk onto the floor. Glass shattered, from what? Draco didn't know and he didn't care to know.
His thirty seconds were over. As if on a timer his hands stopped shaking and Harry pulled himself up Aching limbs and all. First, he needed to make sure the bleeding had stopped. Really he should have done that in the first place. Then he needed to find help.
He realized quickly that what he’s seen a glimpse of actually was hair. The crackle of magic was back in the air, if only very faintly.
“No,” Draco said flatly. Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. “You were there. You saw what was happening”  his hands were in fists and he was looking Dumbledore in the eye and the old man leaned back ever so slightly like he was shocked and the only thing Draco could think was
The corridors were empty as he knew they would be. It was far too early for any student in their right mind to be awake. Which is probably why he enjoyed waking up before the sun. he smirked at the idea of being completely out of his mind and shoved his hands in his pockets, he wasn't sure where to go, there was nowhere he could go. Not until they were able to wake Harry up and get his account of what happened that night.
He wrapped his arms loosely around his knees and watched the horizon. He could admit he was angry with being dropped on the Weasly’s doorstep without a second thought. Wouldn’t be the first time he was left on a doorstep by Dumbledore though. The thought made him smile even if it was flat.
“Don’t move” Harry said softly he cringed at the sound of his voice. He hadn’t heard himself speak in awhile.
So Sorry it's been over a month! unfortunately, my husband, son, and myself all got covid (truly IDK how at this point) and it took a while to get everyone over it. but now that everyone is doing better I've had time to get back to writing! this chapter went through so many drafts and ended up in places i hadn't previously planned. I hope very much that you like it! please let me know what you think!
“Why don’t you start at the beginning?” He looked at her for a long minute before he did just that. He told her about finding Draco hurt, going to Hogwarts, getting along with him for a few days, and the way Draco shook in his arms when he carried him to the hospital wing. He left out a fair bit about the Dursleys and Draco saving him and the Dark mark Draco wore. He wasn’t looking at her as he went through the story. But when he did he found himself sorry he said anything at all.
Harry sighed softly. There was nothing more he could do from here. Harry picked up the soaked towels and threw them into the floor of his closet. Another problem for another day. He was exhausted beyond belief. But his plan wasn't complete yet. He pulled out a few pieces of parchment and sat on the other side of the mattress, careful not to jostle Malfoy. With a textbook in his lap to act as a desk, he began to write.
“I’m sorry” she whispered as a single tear fell down her cheek. And then she was being shoved out of the way and his father was surging through the door. Coming at him so fast Draco automatically stumbled backward, unable to maintain his posture or his cool facade, he was sure the fear showed in his face. His father looked ready to kill him. A look Draco had never seen on his father’s face before and as soon as he was close enough, as soon as he had him back against the wall, his father slapped him hard across the face. Another occurrence that had never happened before.
“How did this happen?” she asked not in her usual kind way. Draco glanced over at Ron and she followed his gaze pursing her lips. He looked back quickly.
“Please please Madam Pomfrey we need help,” he shouted into the empty hospital wing. No one was there. Of course not, she was sitting next to Dumbledore at the feast, of course, she's not here she wouldn't need to be. Okay, he thought okay he needed to get to her now. He laid Harry down and tried not to look at the blood pooling on the white floor, he tried to erase the thought that Harry might already be gone. He ran again ran as fast as he could which admittedly was much faster without carrying the unconscious boy. Luckily the great hall was quite close to the hospital wing. He threw the doors to the great hall open and ran inside. He remembered the time in the first year when professor Quirrell ran into the great hall.
“Funny how that happens sometimes isn’t it,” He said, shaking his head as though the thought was absurd.
“Draco,” her voice sounded like a warning and it made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“Not really” was always Harry's answer. Ron didn’t always believe him but the conversation always ended there. Harry was sure he didn't expect anything close to the truth or he would push harder.
It was hard to tell what emotions were playing on the lines around Potter’s eyes but he could tell when they hardened. When he turned away from Draco. When he decided not to answer. It wasn’t surprising by any means. Draco swallowed down whatever retort he had been trying to come up with and slumped farther into his own seat secretly hoping he could get enough blood on the thing that even a cleaning charm couldn’t save it.
Once in the Dark Lord's hands, he sent a curse at the woman Draco had made a point not to look at. Now he was looking though. Her body slammed into the tabletop in front of him. It was the only place he could look. He didn’t stop himself from jumping back a fraction of an inch at the impact. Her cold dead eyes were looking directly at him. He wanted to cry. He did not cry.
“Sorry to bother you Sir, but I am unable to use magic and when I found Malfoy I couldn’t have saved him without getting expelled.” Found him. Draco thought tiredly. Just how had Potter found him? Where was he that he needed to be found by Potter in the first place? What was going on? And why were they still sitting here in Dumbledore's office instead of in the Hospital Wing where Harry could be being healed.
He kept his eyes down out of habit, watching the floor while Dumbledore whispered to the portraits on the wall. The headmaster was pacing, hands behind his back, ignoring them. Ignoring them both. To his left sat Harry Potter. The same Harry Potter that he’d just watched get thrown down a flight of steps. The same Harry Potter that managed to become a seeker in first year. The same Harry Potter who sat silently, bleeding and swollen. The same Harry Potter that Draco memorized all those years ago in Madam Malkin's. The very same too skinny boy. Harry Potter who was all but broken sitting in the oversized armchair, barely recognizable to even him. Draco shuddered. Thinking about what he’d seen felt wrong. Like he had trespassed, stumbled onto something no one was meant to see, but that didn’t make it something that should be ignored either.
He was met with a rather familiar pain that could be felt even while asleep. A burning in his head. Like the scar was being carved into his head with a failed spell all over again. He could see blurry images. He couldn’t make out any faces. Just the vague idea of people. He was watching from Voldemort’s eyes. He wanted to recoil away from the images but there was a part of him that embraced it. That reveled in the screams he could hear coming from the cell in front of him. It was a boy, Harry realized, that was screaming at the end of his wand. It served him right for having gone against him. The thoughts were not Harry's own but they felt like they easily could be.
“P... Potter?” The boy said, voice full of confusion. So different from how it usually sounded. Then Draco Malfoy passed out. In Harry Potter’s arms.
A boy who was Draco Malfoy was bleeding in his bed, and there was little Harry could do about it being underage just barely, but regardless enough to keep him from being able to use magic. There was supposed to be an allowance for life or death situations as was this one, but after last year's trial attempting to expel him for protecting himself, he knew the ministry was watching him particularly closely and he would not be allowed any such allowances.
His father was a shadow of what Draco always thought he was. His father didn’t look powerful anymore. He looked weak. Slumped over when he thought no one saw him. The way he went about serving the Dark Lord was no different than their house-elves served them. In what world were Malfoys meant to be servants? Not in the world, his father painted for him. Not in the world, Draco wanted to live in. it didn’t make sense to Draco.
But did all that mean that the boy had to die? Draco’s hands began to tremble slightly in his lap. He wasn’t ready for anything about this world he found himself in. there were so many things he knew, he just knew he couldn’t do. Things he had no choice but to do.
“Just what do you think you’re doing Mister Malfoy.” Madam Pomfrey asked sternly. It was clear the way she positioned herself in between him and the curtains that she wasn’t going to let him pass her easily.
“That was all he said? Are you sure?” Madam Pomfrey interrupted, Draco glanced up at her and noticed her brow furrowed. Draco nodded.
They were alone in the kitchen as Ron scarfed down a sandwich and then another. Harry let himself just be in the space. Trying to push away the worry and the dream and Horace and Dumbeldore and all of it.
“Don't know how don't know why it feels like such a big thing either.” She pat his knee and gave him an unreadable look.
“Wait.” she interrupted again holding her hand out to stop him. “you said you went to the crime scene and didn't use any magic?” she asked
Here we are at chapter thirteen! lots going on in this one had lots of things to cover to set up the next few chapters. hope you enjoy it! let me know what you think, what you like and what you don't.
“Well it’s possible he was the one to cast the spell in the first place, though I highly doubt it. This spell is much more advanced than almost any student here could cast.” the potions master answered, almost managing to sound bored. Draco felt like he wanted to argue that he could, in fact, cast whatever spell they were talking about, but at the same time, it wouldn't help his current predicament if he argued that point.
Harry told himself it was only because of this ruddy chosen one nonsense. Like it was in his blood to save people or whatever. That wasn’t exactly true. These days Harry's name was a cause of death to those around him. And maybe he was tired of watching death win.
“Now don't you worry about that,” she said simply, walking out of her office. Draco stood on shaking knees and followed her, eyeing the closed curtains surrounding Harry wearily as they passed them. Doubt crashed over him like waves, causing him to stumble slightly.
Harry felt sick and he didn't know if it was due to the suddenness of the new place, or the fact that he was here at all, here when he should be in the hospital wing. Shouldn’t he be? For a moment Harry didn’t know anything at all about where he should be.
“No really what is it this year?” Mr. Weasly looked like a cross between exasperating and pitying, Harry couldn’t stand it.
“What about me?” Potter asked, and Draco was baffled by the confusion in the other boy's voice. Dumbledore said nothing.
He crossed the room and fell onto his four-poster bed, his head fell into his hands. He remembered when he was younger. Eleven years old, ready to head off to Hogwarts for the first time. He remembered how proud his father had been when he was sorted into Slytherin. It was such a happy time for their family. Draco took a lot of pride in being a Slytherin. Maybe more pride than in his family name right now. Draco used to look up to his father, used to be proud of him and his family name. It was startling to Draco that he no longer did.
The sun was going down. The sun was going down and Harry was hot and he didn’t want to go back to the house. But the sun was going down. So he stood, legs and back aching from sitting so still for so long. And he started the long walk back, with his hands shoved inside his pockets and his head down.
“Then we will see you at the feast,” Dumbledore said warmly.  Horace went back inside. “Well done Harry”
“Oi! Malfoy!” he heard someone calling behind him and recognized the weasel right away. He turned down the first corridor he could find and picked up a sprint trying to lose the redhead. The last thing he needed today was to deal with potters bloody followers. He could hear footsteps running far behind him but knew he’d catch up eventually, Draco made a few more turns and ducked into the first door he could find pushing it quietly closed.
His father had always been a picture of power to Draco. He had never had to see this side of things. His father taught him that to serve by the Dark Lord's side was where the Malfoys would always belong. He told Draco bedtime stories about the good days when the Dark Lord was purifying the magical community.
“Dad thinks the minister is working with You-know-Who,” Ron said, cutting to the chase and throwing a handful of something into his mouth. He was the one who looked the most relaxed. Ginny wasn’t even looking at him. Harry raised his eyebrows at Mr. Weasly
This meeting had little to do with him, most things the Dark Lord said had little to do with him beyond assigning the mission. But here he was, sitting to the right of his father. A position that showed he was ready to follow in his father's footsteps. A position Draco took up of his own free will a little over a month ago. A position that Draco now loathed.
He was once again caught with the thought ‘why am I trying to save him as he uncapped the first of the potions. He didn’t try to answer himself and went about tilting Malfoys head back and pouring each of the potions down his throat. Except for the one for sleeping as Malfoy hadn’t so much as stirred since the long walk to the Dursleys.
“You’re not sending him back” He echoed Potter, looking almost desperately at the headmaster who held up another dismissive hand in an attempt to silence him.
He walked for a while before the boy stirred. He glanced down to see one gray-blue eye struggling to open and look around.
So Harry had never climbed the steps of the play yard equipment, to where the tops of the slides opened up for kids to crawl into. But now he found himself doing just that. Climbing up the steps that as a child seemed so much taller.
“Yes, I think I know a lost cause when I see one.” The words were light, pleasant almost. For anyone who hadn’t spent years listening to Dumbledore, you would think it was all a joke.
“Not really,” He answered honestly. He felt her looking at him then. “There's something I need to tell you both, I don’t know what it means if it means anything I just know well I don't I don't know anything Mione.” She nodded patiently.
“Mhm got here a day ago. She was late too. Trains day after tomorrow ya know” Harry bit his lip, he didn’t know, he supposed it was too much to wish for it to be sooner. He nodded despite not knowing. “They wanted to wake you up and all of us go but you looked really tired, told em I’d wait for you. We can floo to Fred and George's shop if you want or we can hang here until they come back. Doesn't matter to me” Harry half-smiled at his friend. He wasn’t much up for going anywhere. But he didn’t exactly want to tell Ron that either. He knew it was asking a lot for Ron to give up an afternoon with Hermione. Even if Ron didn't see it that way yet.
Harry was reeling, parts of the dreams were coming back with razor-sharp focus. It was painful remembering them. He can’t believe he didn’t before. It was maddening now seeing the obvious splayed out in front of him. He wanted to remember more. He tried to see more clearly the boy in the cell though Harry had a terribly sickening idea of who it would be. It hurt looking so closely. It burned.
“Yes yes,” Dumbledore said and Draco looked in time to see Dumbledore hold up a dismissive hand. Anger began to build in Draco but he looked back down. He was hurt, that was true when first he woke he could feel it in his side. The tear that stretched, pulling at his skin from his lowest rib and wrapped around to the bottom of his back. He could feel it burn under the fabric of his shirt. It was a feverish burn, but for now, at least it was dulling, the adrenaline probably hiding the pain from him. It was still bleeding, hidden under a borrowed cloak, but the bleeding was slow. He didn't know why he was hiding it exactly. Just that for some reason he felt he needed to be here in this office hearing what was being said. Was it a mission? Perhaps something the Dark Lord set him to do. That idea didn’t sit well with Draco making him squirm slightly in his seat, wincing at the pull in his skin.
“Harry, Harry Potter.” he mumbled,  “Help him please please help him, he's in the hospital wing.” Draco gasped sucking in air that he didn't realize he had been holding his breath. “Don't just stand there! Bloody do something!” he shouted.
Platinum blonde hair. That’s what it looked like Harry thought. Probably just something left behind from the children yesterday. He started to continue on his walk. But stopped again when he heard a strained cough.
The sound of bare feet could be faintly heard to one end of the room. He was here. He took his seat at the head of the table and only when he opened his arms and greeted them with a hissed ‘welcome’ were they allowed to be seated.
A place that looked exactly the same as it had that night, complete with a blood trail from the sink to the stall door. Had nobody even bothered cleaning up? Draco stood froze just inside the door. It felt too much like it had that night. He felt sure if he took a few steps he’d see Harry Potter lying on the stall floor. It took him an embarrassing amount of time for him to realize that he wouldn't see the boy here. That Harry was in the hospital wing. Draco felt an intense need to see what was inside the stall. Like he knew there would be something there. Something important. He forced his feet to move until the bloody stall came into view. And he almost forgot just how much blood there had been. As if his dreams weren't bad enough without that reminder. He found himself crouching down to further examine the dried blood staining the floor. He looked closer when a flickering caught his eye.
He pulled one out and held his wand to the tip before whispering the fire spell "Incendio" he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of smoke.
Just then the door swung open, Ms. Trelawnly smiled at both of them looking at all the clean balls around Harry. "You two have done just great. You may leave and go straight to your common rooms! I didn't realize the time." she said, peering over at the clock: 11:00 pm. Draco looked over at Harry before running out.
think muggles were worth less than him despite what he outwardly expressed. Draco sheltered the flame from the open wind coming in the window and breathed in a deep drag. This was his usual night routine. Soon the night came and Draco was peacefully asleep. He had passed out from the strong indica strained joint. The sun illuminated his pale sleeping body.
Draco and Harry made brief, awkward eye contact before Harry walked over to the group of tables Draco was sitting at. Draco avoided making further eye contact with him as Ms. Trelawney finished pairing up the rest of the class. “Now that you all have your pairs. I will briefly go over your assignment. You will use the spells we have been practicing over the past couple of weeks to look into the other person's mind. Your task is to find one secret about the other person.”
Draco sighed with relief once he reached Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He entered a stall and his mask fell. Draco's entire body shook with silent sobs. As he angrily wiped away the tears, the cold voice of his father echoed in his head; 'Malfoys don't cry.'
"I don't have to do anything,” Draco said quietly but keeping his hostile tone, flicking a glare at Harry.
An awkward silence filled the room for around half an hour as Harry cleaned the crystal balls and Draco zoned out in his seat.
Draco knew exactly what was happening, his father put a curse on his arm for being disobedient, in the morning he had eaten too much food for a Malfoy, it couldn’t have been more than 100 calories, but that was more than enough for breakfast. His father was outraged. In his eyes, his son was a disappointment and needed to be put back in line.
Harry spooned some peas into his mouth “I have to go, talk soon” he said with his mouth still full. Harry didn't stay around to hear their answer and followed after the blonde-haired boy.
Harry was about to pull down Draco's sleeve but he could've sworn he saw a tear fall down Draco's cheek, even if he imagined it, that was enough to stop him.
Draco turned around sharply “Don’t you dare, you worthless piece of shit” Draco pulled out his wand, pointing it towards Harry “Stupefy” he said intending to paralyze him but Harry dodged it and quickly disarmed Draco.
Harry was shocked to see Draco like this, he was normally snarky and rude but now he thought if he used his words correctly, just maybe, he might find out what was going on.
Harry pulled out a potion from underneath his bed. This was his last one left, but he needed some peace and quiet. It was a dreamless sleep potion. He opened the bottle and sipped it, before delicately collapsing onto his bed.
Draco looked at the roof then up at him "I, I don't know.” Draco said in a voice that was uneven “I mean, it's just another coping mechanism” Draco said shrugging. Harry again wondered what he meant by this. “A coping mechanism for what?” he asked, looking into the blonde's eyes. Draco quickly realized he had left his guard down for too long “I don’t know Potter, forget it” he spat at him as he brought the cigarette to his lips. Harry could feel Dracos unease about the subject and decided to change it. “It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it” Harry said as he moved closer to Draco. He flinched as he felt Harry's shoulder pushing against his. He quickly moved away, wincing. Harry eyed the blonde “Did I really push you that hard before?” he asked, jokingly trying to hide his concern. “What? No.” Draco spat back as he recollected himself. “What happened to your shoulder then?” Harry asked as he reached for Dracos collar. Malfoy quickly spun his head around, grabbing Harry's arm, “I told you to drop that” Draco sighed before letting go of his arm. Harry let out a sigh as well as he stared at Draco. Harry wanted to drop it, he really did but he found himself intrigued with the Slytherin he thought he knew. “Well whatever it is, you should go to Madam Pomfrey. I’ll take you”. Draco stared at him for a minute “Why do you care?” I mean “Why are you acting so nice?” Draco looked at Harry, trying to figure out if he had an ulterior motive or not. “I’m not being nice, Draco. If you're hurt you should get it treated”. Draco shook his head, taking in another drag of smoke as he looked at the grounds below him. “It’s Malfoy...” he paused “...and I’m not hurt” Draco replied with caution.
Harry pulled himself out of his bed and walked to the mirror. He had terrible bed hair, but there was nothing he could do about it. Since he didn’t own a comb, he ran his fingers through his hair roughly and considered it done. He sighed and grabbed his robe as he started walking down to The Great Hall. Harry found Hermione and Ron and grabbed a seat.
“Okay…” Ron said uneasily, “catch you afterward then?” he said as he threw a few books into his bag and swung it over his shoulder. Harry nodded and watched Ron leave.
“I said I wasn’t doing it you prat, what gives you the right to talk to me?” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry again.
Harry shook his head “No It’s okay. It had me thinking though, he was so worried about me finding out about his secrets that he smashed the ball. Do you think he has the Dark Mark? I mean, I’ve never seen him wear short sleeves...”
If you're wondering why I wrote Harry so mean please don't flame me and try to see things from his point of view, he truly believes Draco is a Death Eater. He's angry that Draco won't show him his wrists because he just wants to find out the truth. He's scared because he has no family left and all he has is his friends, and if Draco is helping Voldemort then that threatens their lives.
Draco stared blankly at the dark ceiling. His curtains covered the windows and no light could make its way inside. His shaking hands brushed over the green, silk-like fabric. With a heavy sigh, Draco pulled the sheets off his body and climbed out of bed. A shudder ran up his spine when his feet touched the hard cold wood on the floor. Draco gathered all his strength and motivation as he forced himself to shower and grab some clean robes. A slight wince escaped Draco's lips when he pulled the robes over his open wounds. Draco held back tears as he looked at his imperfect body in the mirror. Quivering he carefully combed his hair and washed his face. Once he considered himself presentable he grabbed his bag and walked out the door.
Harry just caught him in a weak moment, they weren't friends. He couldn't let him get that close again, he needed to keep his mask on tighter. He needed control.
. Harry quickly walked over to him. “What was that?” Harry asked, observing the boy. “What was what?” Draco replied snarkily, still turned away from Harry. Draco quickly fixed his robe.
“Malfoy!?! What’s wrong?” Harry said reaching for Draco’s sleeve. He just needed a peek, a reassurance that he wasn’t a Death Eater.
Lucius raised his hand another time, but Draco flinched, raising his hand above his face “Father please, please stop.” he said as he tried to squirm away, but he wasn’t strong enough.
Ron stopped shoveling food into his mouth and looked up at Harry “Should we teach him a lesson?” he asked as he made a fist with his hand.
It Harry was lucky then the house would be quiet when he opened the door. So far Harry didn’t like his odds. He was standing in front of the front door, the front door where he’d been left as a baby. And he was waiting to open it, trying to judge if anyone behind it would be awake, not that he could easily tell. Not that he could really tell at all. Maybe it was another game he liked to play. Wait a moment and strain to see if he could hear anything behind the door. Guess if anyone was awake and then go in and see if he was right or not.
It was an honor, his father had said, to be invited to these meetings. To be chosen to help the Dark Lord achieve his goals. An honor to be chosen to take the dark mark at his young age. Draco had been ecstatic at the beginning of the summer at the news. He’d attended the meetings, and was given a mission, to prove himself, the Dark Lord had said. His father had told him how proud he was of Draco. His father had told him what an honor it was.
that he couldn’t quite put a name to. It was important. Whatever it was that he was missing was important,
It was the middle of the night when he woke up to Malfoy’s gasps. It was only moments later that he found himself wherever the hell ‘here’ was.
The fact that he was covered in blood was for some reason not surprising either. He could feel it in his side. The whispering had stopped and Dumbledore cleared his throat, apparently ready now to acknowledge their existence.
chapter eighteen is here faster than I expected, got a rare amount of free time this week, hope you like it let me know what you think so far. this is about the halfway mark of part one if everything goes to plan.
“You have to believe me.” he started, looking down at the floor, Wringing his hands. “I don't know why I left the great hall that night except that I knew I had to. I went straight to where Harry was but I swear I had no idea he was there. I saw the blood and followed it to find harry almost unconscious his arms were already torn open that way when I got there.” a lump rose in Draco's throat and he paused, not looking up from the floor.  “He said my name, He said my name when he saw me but that was it.”
“Draco dear!” Draco didn't even slow to look at the portrait of the three ladies and one man at tea time. The man loved to talk to Draco and would always call him dear as if he was one of the ladies himself. But tonight Draco didn't want to talk he was through talking. He shoved his hands into his pockets and began to walk quicker. He had no idea where he was heading. Just away, just away from the pity in Dumbledore's eyes, away from the accusing in the Weasley's voice. Away from Granger’s sniffeling. Away from the image forever imprinted in his mind. Away from all the damned emotion that bubbled up inside him, emotion that he had long since bottled away in the deepest part of his subconscious.
“The thing who used to do what?” she questioned confusion clear in her voice. Merlin, they have no idea. Draco thought to himself looking at the woman in front of him sadly.
The house was silent and he whispered a near-silent “Thank Merlin'' as he toed the door the rest of the way closed. The soft click echoed in Harry's ears and he stilled for a few moments to make sure no one had heard. To make sure his aunt hadn’t heard.
“We have a problem young Malfoy.”  Draco didn't say anything, any retort he could come up with would just be turned back around on him. “You can move freely into the lavatory where Harry was, injured?” Draco noticed the way he hesitated before the word injured.
“Ron wouldn’t let us wake you,” She said quietly, watching Ron sleep. She bumped her shoulder against his softly “Are you alright?”
Ron and Hermione were still standing close to the door, talking to two older men that Draco had never seen before. They were much taller and stood over Ron and Hermione with a kind of authority. Seeing them sent Draco's stomach churning.  Hermione saw him first and headed over to him.
“Right,” Harry said, drawing the word out to three syllables. “Who is threatening my life this time?” it should bother him to ask such a thing, but he was ashamed to admit it gave him a bit of a thrill.
Days passed the same as the last. He woke up with Harry, they went to potions or they went flying, Draco forgot he even had a schedule of classes tucked away in a forgotten textbook under his bed. They had meals at their respective house tables and then spent all their spare time in the library trying to figure out what connected him and he-who-must-not-be-named. Draco had tried on numerous occasions to tell them there was no need, he hasn't been sucked back into those nightmares. Into that room, in weeks. He did not tell the others that the only difference was that Harry was spending his nights in the same bed.
Finally, he could see the doors. Yes, they were close. He burst through them with the last surge of energy and immediately collapsed on the ground still holding Potter up.
“Want to tell me about it?” Harry considered this and considered Ron, the crease of concern in his forehead. He only ever told Ron about these things. Sometimes Hermione but she was always looking for the answers, sometimes Harry couldn’t look for answers in everything and that's when he knew he could count on Ron to just listen.
“What do you have?” Harry said he was interested now. Call it self-preservation or blatant curiosity. He sat next to Ron.
Harry found himself standing at the base of the Dursley’s driveway. Malfoy had grown completely limp, and his arms were beginning to burn. He wasn’t sure why it surprised him to be standing here. There was nowhere else he could go. No, where he could take Malfoy but right here. It was still early. The moon could still be seen in the soft morning light. Hopefully, this would mean his aunt would still be asleep. She was always the hardest to predict of the Dursleys.
Harry raised his wand. Not his wand. Not his hand. Harry raised his wand and whispered the curse again. The boy screamed and screamed and screamed until the sound of it mixed with Harry's laugh and he couldn’t tell the sounds apart. He couldn’t tell himself apart. Was he himself was he something else something worse. The laughing and the screams filled his ears.
But there was a plan in place, and rules to follow, and expectations to upkeep. Though, it made him sick to think his whole life had been leading him to these moments. To these meetings. To this plan. And failure was not to be an option.
the two started towards the door again, and Draco watched them. For not the first time in his life, he envied Potter. He envied the loyalty he so easily inspired. He envied the power he had so effortlessly. He envied most of all the perfect life he had, and he hated him. Who in their right mind would throw away such a life as Harry Potter’s? He was mister perfect, he could get away with whatever he wanted. He was practically worshiped, who wouldn't want all of that? He was bloody rich. More than that, more than any of it, he was loved. Actually properly loved, by so many people. Draco couldn't say he knew what that felt like. What it felt like to even have one person care for him as deeply as the mudblood and the lapdog cared for Harry.
Dumbeldore merely shrugged beside him, “Then how about a drink my old friend? We’ve come all this way.” Horace seemed to consider this a moment his gaze trailing from Harry to Dumbledore like he was fighting with himself. All at once he slumped and begrudgingly pulled a bottle of firewhiskey from a shelf.
“Absolutely not.” Snape interrupted before Draco could even open his mouth. “Have you forgotten that potion is, in fact, illegal?” Snape demanded, leaning over the desk until he was practically in Dumbledore's face.
“I said that will be all, Severus.” the headmaster repeated looking straight at Draco making him wonder who exactly he was dismissing. He didn't have to wonder long as Snape turned on his heel and stormed out of the room cursing under his breath. Draco knew why his godfather was so angry the effects of the truth serum were not exactly considered pleasant but he would bare it if it meant somebody would believe him.
Perhaps Dobby decides to visit? No. That’s not likely, if it was dobby he’d already been attacked with hugs by now.
The hallways always seemed bigger when they were empty like this. Like they were looming over whoever dared crossed them. Most of the students at Hogwarts found the castle creepy like this, dark and full of shadows, alive in its own way. Most avoided being alone in the dark like this. Most everyone, except Draco who grew rather fond of the abandoned feeling the castle gave off at night. He loved the haunted feeling it had as the castle came alive. He loved the solitary sound of his footsteps, he loved the shadows that each sculpture threw off. He loved the moving portraits, some of whom knew him quite well and would ask him how he was doing or warn him if any teachers were out that night. Tonight was different from most. Nearly every figure in every portrait was awake with frantic whispering. So frantic in fact that the sound filled the halls almost undoubtedly about Potter.
But it didn’t matter what Harry would dare to say. No one would listen to him anyway. He knew his place by now. He was a pawn in everyone else’s games. A pawn, the first piece to be sacrificed in any game of wizard’s chess. That’s all he was.
“I think-” He started to say only his tongue knotted up before he could continue and it came out sounding as though he were drunk. He stood there a moment longer before the entire corridor twisted on an angle tipping everything upside down. “Potter '' He tried to say, he wasn’t sure if he was successful, only that after the attempt he felt arms around him. Catching him. And then the world went dark and cold.
“Malfoy!” the angered voice called. Draco turned away from the mirror stunned, he didn't want to see more and instead decided to face the angry redhead who was now practically charging him. Draco didn't fight back as Ron attacked him, knocking him to the floor and for the second time in a week he proceeded to punch and kick any part of Draco he could reach. Draco took it until Ron had finally tired himself out.
Harry stood from the table when he noticed Malfoy leaving. “I have to go study, catch you guys later,” he said. They both looked at him and nodded before going back to arguing.
Draco stared at him "I like to come up here sometimes, to get away from it all." Harry looked at him wondering what that meant but didn't ask.
He wasn't hungry, honestly. He had just woken up but he knew if he didn’t eat anything Hermione would hang it over his head so he decided to have some food despite his lack of appetite. Harry found his eyes drifting over to Malfoy.
“Mostly because everyone already knows almost everything about me,” Harry said shrugging his shoulders.
Draco hated this punishment. his father controlled when and where his punishment would occur. Draco had no clue when it would happen, but he knew when it did it would most surely be painful.
“T-That spell Malfoy. I’ve never heard it before”. Draco laughed, it was a pain-relieving spell that was no longer used. He supposed, in muggle terms, it would be considered a retired prescription drug that was now being abused. “It wasn’t a spell. I was just testing something,” Draco said as he let out a short laugh. An awkward silence fell for a minute or two before Draco broke it “Potter. Why do you keep following me?” he asked as he leaned against the wall and allowed himself to fall to the ground. “Malfoy. I’m worried about you.” Draco stared at him, dumbfounded by the situation. He shook his head to himself. Harry didn’t care, he had an ulterior motive. Draco just wasn't sure what it was yet. Draco sighed “I don’t need a lecture”. Harry nodded. Draco felt his negative thoughts coming back as he tried to keep his composure. “Leave me Potter. I need to be alone” Harry looked at the defeated blonde in front of him and kept his legs planted to the floor. Draco sighed, “Please?” he mumbled. Harry stared at Draco. That was the first time he had begged for something before. This made Harry question even more if he really knew the Slytherin. Harry simply nodded and left. Draco let out a sigh of relief that he was no longer being monitored. It gave him severe anxiety to think that his mask was slipping, especially around the golden boy.
