Harry blew his bangs from his face. “I don’t know how else to describe it, but that’s the word makes the most sense. You make me feel useful. Helpful, even. It seems like you actually want me around. Like, I’m not just a pretty piece of arm candy you parade out at only the most convenient times. I’m not some prize that you feel the need to constantly show off. I mean, Reid was there but he wasn’t really
He could practically hear the eye roll through the phone. “You two have been together not even a month and you’re already looking for dirt?”
“So… You don’t think they’re doing this as some sort of publicity stunt?” Bill asked, causing Fleur to smack him in the shoulder. “What? I wouldn’t put it past Malfoy to pull a stunt like this to pull his family’s name out of the gutter.”
He stepped out into the hallway, still hearing the shower running in the opposite room. Draco crossed into the opposite room, knocking lightly on the bathroom door. He could swear beneath the sounds of the water were the sounds of weeping.
They disappeared with a pop.
“I never disliked you.” Draco explained. “I think it stemmed from place of jealousy. You were famous before you had even learned to talk. My father would describe the ‘
“I took private lessons as a child.”
“Oh…” Harry breathed, staring down at the shot glasses. “Cheers, then.”
“Did you sleep well?”
“I… I cursed you. Sliced you open. Snape stitched you up with the countercurse but you don’t have any scars. Even with dittany there’d be a mark, albeit faint, but there’s nothing.”
“Go! Go! Be brilliant in Court today.” Harry released the blonde. “There’s a container of chicken salad in the refrigerator, you should take it for lunch.”
“Will you say words of protection with me?”
Draco placed a quick had on Hermione’s shoulder. “I will.”
Harry giggled and disentangled himself from Draco. "Here." He lifted his left arm and pulled down a zipper.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You can dismiss my upbringing, but I was well cared for. You would have been brought up in a similar fashion had your parents survived.”
A mischievous smirk played across Harry's face. "Oh, maybe..."
Harry turned around, looking coyly over his shoulder. “It wasn’t addressed to me.”
She leveled a gaze at the blonde. “Have you had sex with Harry when he’s sober?”
“Gone.” Harry smiled and walked briskly to the Floo exits.
“Uh-hmm.”
“You think Praetor hit him?”
Hermione leaned back in her chair, pinching the bridge of her nose. Remus and Sirius sat silently, looking at one another while the Weasleys sat stunned. Harry lifted his hand to naw on his thumbnail, only to have Draco take his hand in his own. Hermione raised an eyebrow at the gesture.
Draco smiled then swayed a little, went somehow paler and green at the same time, then his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out in Harry’s lap.
Ron blushed and Draco walked away, gave Harry a quick kiss and left the room simply saying “dibs on the shower next.”
“There’s was no way I could win.” She looked very proud of herself.
“I’ll see you tomorrow Malfoy.” He then turned and walked away, hands shoved in his robe pockets and his shoulders bent.
“Draco Malfoy just hugged me” Ron hadn’t moved, in what felt like year (
He smiled back “no we haven’t”.
“You watched me sleep? That’s kind of stalkery.”
He made his decision he span on his heel and ran back to where they had been, but it was deserted, Malfoy was gone.
“Totally not full of yourself are you Potter?”
BobIII xxx
Harry’s seeker instincts must have kicked in because Malfoy had never seen someone turn around so fast.
The only choice Harry had was to follow. He kept going through his brain for things he could have done wrong and nothing came to mind.
“Hi it’s Draco.”
“You’ve been walking for hours!!”
Draco didn’t go to any other lessons that day. How could he?
He made his decision he span on his heel and ran back to where they had been, but it was deserted, Malfoy was gone.
they are appreciated and make my day!!
Harry tried to give her evils but ended up laughing. Turning to Draco he hauled him up off the seat and carried/dragged him to the nearest courtyard.
____________________
They had started to draw quite a crowd, students and some teachers had formed a circle around them, Harry was happy about this till he simultaneously spotted Draco with and eyebrow raised and heard Ginny say…
“from the confusion on your face I’ll take that as no.” she shook her head, “the amount of people asking me if I was okay today was ridiculous, everyone was telling me about how they’d seen the two of you holding hands and hugging, and just being plain coupley.” She leaned back in her seat resting her head on the backrest, “it’s quite sweet actually.”
____________________
“Well as you told me before I have no one else so how could I say no?”
Draco woke up in the morning after one of the best sleeps he had had in a long time, no nightmares and no dreams at all, maybe today was the start of a whole new chapter.
“What for? I don’t need new robes”
The response he got was a wide smile and a “I don’t know but I kind of love.”
Harry stood there for a few seconds staring at Malfoy. Then his eyes widened and he no longer looked confused, tears started to form in his eyes and a wide smile broke out on his face.
What they  couldn’t see however where the tingles that were shooting up Harry’s arm to and making his heart beat faster, he was also struggling to breathe, all of this caused by Draco holding his hand, this had never happened with Ginny.
He felt Potter shake his head against him.
Malfoy was pacing, Malfoy never paced, but there he was. Pacing.
Though it was nice to see them hugging he was suddenly swept with the feeling to join, and be a loveable rogue, nuisance. He wrapped his arms around them and grinned Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
“One, rude! Two that is an empty bottle of fire whisky, how are you still holding it??”
“Shworry”.
“Cauldron cake?” Draco blinked a few times, coming back to the real world.
He got up and found an empty glass and filled it using aguamenti and took it upstairs.
“Uhm…home please.” He started to walk, the stopped. “I don’t mean to be rude but who are you?”
“from the confusion on your face I’ll take that as no.” she shook her head, “the amount of people asking me if I was okay today was ridiculous, everyone was telling me about how they’d seen the two of you holding hands and hugging, and just being plain coupley.” She leaned back in her seat resting her head on the backrest, “it’s quite sweet actually.”
This was the comment that made Harry start laughing.
His head was spinning as he walked back to the common room.
“Everything.” He moved his head so it was resting in the crook of Malfoy’s neck, it felt right, he felt like he in the place he was mean to be.
“Morning!!” Harry was apparently in a very cheery mood.
This gained him another pillow to the face “You’ll run out”
“I don’t know what we are Draco, but I do two things, one that I really really like you too, and two that you are very drunk, I would kiss you very passionately but I would feel like I was taking advantage of you. But know this Draco Malfoy, I, Harry Potter, like you very much and would like to carry on this conversation when you aren’t brimming with fire whisky.”
Harry went into the common flopped on the sofa and put his head in Ginny’s lap, who had been reading there quite contently.
Harry slowly nodded his head and then waited for Malfoy’s response. When Malfoy chuckled Harry felt it move through him and it made all his problems melt away.
“people think we’re having an affair?”
Draco’s mind was racing, he’d just watched Harry and Ginny have a full blown argument which has now resulted in Harry walking towards him.
Hermione just sighed and walked away. Ron waited a bit longer and looked from Harry to Draco and back again, raised an eye brow, smiled and nodded and went to follow his girlfriend. Draco would later say that that was the moment he knew he had got Weasley’s approval.
He walked out of the bathroom and saw Harry and Ron hugging, he smiled, he had never had close friends, he’d had what he now called brown nosing followers, but he had never had the kind of friendship the golden trio where famous for having, and now he was part of it, they had made him feel welcomed and loved.
Dinner was actually quite fun. Potter included him in the conversation as much as he could and Granger and Weasley, when they weren’t being all coupley talked to him as well.
Draco jolted awake.
A laugh bubbled in Harry’s stomach, “pardon?”
Draco was surprised, it was like Potter had read his thoughts, “Are you sure? And is that even allowed?”
“Where are you going?!?” the tone of Malfoy’s voice startled Harry, he really wished he had an answer.
They both groaned in unison, “only making it more real guys.”
Draco turned to Harry, “what in Merlin’s name is going on?”
“So what happened?”
Ron smiled back, “it’s a good thing I love you both or I’d have used a bucket.”
Draco sighed and rested his head against the wall behind him.
“No problem, I’m always happy to help.”
Once inside the shop they bought a selection of sweets, Harry refusing to let Draco to pay for any of them. They then found a shaded spot hidden away but also with a clear view to see when Ron and Hermione leave the tea shop.
Getting off the Hogwarts Express was a weird experience. The knowledge of what had occurred here the year before, the death and destruction of the war and wondering if the school was going to feel the same.
It was about midnight when Malfoy got back to his common room. He led on his bed and pondered what the hell had just happened.
Potter had never been a fan of potions, except in 6
“I’ll have one in the morning for now I want to sleep” Draco shot him a disgusted look, “It helps me wake up I’m groggy in the morning”
“I have no idea what you’re on about” he flourished his arms to accentuate his point making him realise he was holding something in his hand, he squinted to try and focus his eyes but fire whisky was causing everything to seem blurry. He needed answers! Shoving it towards harry “What’s this?! Everything’s blurry, I’m seeing things how I imagine you do without glasses!”
“That might have been part of it yes, but mostly no.”
“Want to stay here hugging?” he wasn’t going to push the other to boy to answer, he’d talk when he wanted to.
Hermione just gave him a small smile and pulled him into a hug, it felt almost like a mum hug, in his ear she whispered “and I apologise for punching you in the face”.
He stopped pacing, turned on the spot and looked towards the reason for his problem. Harry was walking towards with his signature smile on his face, where was Granger and Weasley?
Draco shook the water out of his hair and clambered off Harry, “we have one we just happen to share it with you.” He sent Ron his most innocent smile.
The first thing Ron said when they sat down surprised and slightly annoyed Harry “I can tell from your face he said yes, congrats!! So the stag-do!”
Harry nearly fell off the sofa at this, where had she got that idea from?
____________
shot of fire whisky, along with his control of his eyes, he had lost the ability to walk in a straight line around the 7
i wasnt sure if people knew i had started the prequel so to make sure im going to add it onto this as well :)
Draco jolted awake.
”SHIT!” thankfully no one was near him to see how shaken he was. He ran his hand through his hair, he kept having similar dreams ever since the battle, same ending different place from Hogwarts, to the Manor, to Diagon alley etc.
The time had come they chose to it around lunchtime when most students would be walking around the castle, the bigger the audience the quicker the news would spread, even though it was Hogwarts and news spread ridiculously fast.
This was the comment that made Harry start laughing.
The start of the year feast was extravagant as always. Draco hadn’t had a proper meal in ages so he ignored the wary looks people were giving and just dug into the food. The eighth years sat with the houses as they always had so Draco was surrounded by his fellow Slytherins, a mix of those who took part in the war and those who didn’t.
He’d almost reached out and taken the other boys hand he just hoped Malfoy hadn’t noticed.
“That’s my…”
“Shush, now why have you been lessons today?”
For the rest of the day whenever one of them caught Hermione, or Ron, or both looking at them they would do something coupley, either hold the other ones hand, place their head of the others shoulder or even hug the other one. They were too caught up in their game not to notice their students catching onto the way they were behaving, it was then that the rumours of the Draco and Harry “affair” started to spread.
He was broken out of his thoughts by Ginny, “you two fancy coming to the room of requirements later? I’m throwing a ‘thank merlin those two idiots are finally together’ party. Don’t tell Ron but I stole his secret supply of fire whisky.”
Waiting on Platform ¾ felt strange, Draco looked around him at the families, first years looking scared to leave there parents, older students finding their friends and stepping onto the Hogwarts Express like it was the most natural things to do.
What was happening in his head?! It felt like the weird sisters were havig a full concert inside his head.
“urh, um, eh?”
Harry’s smile grew, where the Harry from last night, this person was all smiles, no hint at what Malfoy had seen. He decided to push this to the back of his mind and focus on the present, if Harry wanted to talk about it he would.
“I don’t know. I was supposed to go to the common room to be by myself for a bit. Then I found myself in the dungeons, then I saw you and I realised I didn’t want to be myself. That’s why I asked to you to follow me. Then I just kept walking and walking.” He gave Draco a slight smile, but his eyes had started to well up. “I’m sorry for causing you trouble I just can’t be alone.”
Harry didn’t answer straight away, he wasn’t sure what Malfoy would think if he said yes,
“I’ll have one in the morning for now I want to sleep” Draco shot him a disgusted look, “It helps me wake up I’m groggy in the morning”
“right” Draco cleared his throat, not for any reason other than to give himself time to think, “ he has an okay voice, bit pitchy  in places.”
They all walked to potions together as a group, which got them some confused looks from people who saw them, Draco Malfoy was walking with Harry Ron and Hermione?
They spent the rest of the weekend sitting around the fireplace in the common room, playing various games and talking about nothing in particular. Draco grew to love Ginny and could tell why Harry fell for her, he loved watching Hermione and Ron together, and started to feel bad for how he treated them in the past.
Ron just shook his head and started walking, Draco behind him.
Draco didn’t go to any other lessons that day. How could he?
When they stopped, to their surprise, people started to cheer, and some even handed each other money. Ginny was stood there smiling at them and Harry realised something, she had planned this from the start.
Harry looked at him both impressed, “a whole bottle?”
His friend squeezed him tighter, “I love you lots too mate, never forget that.”
Harry just sighed, “really really.”
They carried on this back and forth for the rest of breakfast, completely forgetting about Hermione and Ron who sat and watched the entire thing at first confused and then sending each other a knowing look.
What was happening in his head?! It felt like the weird sisters were havig a full concert inside his head.
Draco just stared at him, “It was you?!”
Ron let out a long groan, but he smiled, “I’m glad you’re happy, you won’t be my brother in law but your still my brother, and strangely Draco is my sort of brother in law.” This comment gained him a pillow to his face, “hey!! I’m not wrong!”
He spent the rest of the day hiding out in the library. One thing about being a known ex-death eater, people tended to stay away from you.
“It’s true, he is incredibly scary when he first wakes up the hair everywhere and the glasses missing, he looks like a mermaid from the black lake.” Ron said with an evil grin.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, both becoming very very nervous all of a sudden.
As he was walking a shadow fell over him and he looked up to see a black umbrella over his head, turning he saw it belonged a very good looking man with startling green eyes and scruffy black hair.
“Hello?”
He got up and found an empty glass and filled it using aguamenti and took it upstairs.
This gained another “Hey!” from the topic of this interaction and a “we already are friends, I wouldn’t hand him over to someone who wasn’t.”
“I never said that, I said she was probably at quidditch.”
After the war he was back to being just Harry Potter the boy who’d defeated Voldemort, twice!
“Okay. But again, where are we going?”
hope you enjoyed it
As he stood to leave an arm shot out of the covers and grabbed him and pulled him back down.
rush down to breakfast then walk to his class, thankfully it was on the ground floor.
Draco had no idea why he did what he did next, he grabbed Potter and pulled him into a hug and held him. Draco Malfoy was hugging Harry Potter.
While they walked to the party later that day, after sitting through lessons not really paying attention and smiling at anyone who congratulated them for finally getting together, but everytime someone said he would flinch, where they actually a couple? Yes they had kissed but they hadn’t had a chance to talk about it! Was the party a good idea? Should he drink?
“GINNY!”
They stood there for a while till Draco finally broke the silence, “what’s wrong?”
This broke them out of there trance. Because out of everyone in the room, that had sounded like Ginny.
Draco POV
“People”
He wasn't sure if he should tell Draco or not what was going to happen. He had a feeling Draco had realised Ginny and Harry weren't a thing anymore, he wasn't an idiot and the amount of times he and Harry hung out with each other and Ginny never being there must have given him some evidence. Harry still loved Ginny but not in the way he used to, what he thought was romantic love had changed into a more platonic love, Ginny had agreed when he brought this up during the summer. They had agreed to keep it a secret but with whatever was happening between him and Draco,
Harry’s response to this comment was a look of hurt and “Hey!! Rude!!” and a whispered “true but still rude.”
Draco obviously hadn’t heard most of Harry’s speac as his response was “really really?”
He rolled over in his bed, what was going on? He spent years hating Potter and now he wanted to kiss him and hold him and make him feel safe.
Harry felt everything melt away and he just stood there, till Malfoy broke the silence “what’s wrong?”
Draco normally sat with Pansy, Goyle and Blaise but none of them had wanted to come back, for various reasons so he had no one to sit with. He eventually found a seat on the train with no-one near it and slept for the entire journey, the rocking of the train lulling him into a deep sleep.
“What?”
While they were packing there things away Potter asked Draco what subjects he was taking and when it turned out they were doing the same subjects he asked Malfoy a question that set everything else that year into action;
something was happening between him a Draco, something had to change.
Draco normally sat with Pansy, Goyle and Blaise but none of them had wanted to come back, for various reasons so he had no one to sit with. He eventually found a seat on the train with no-one near it and slept for the entire journey, the rocking of the train lulling him into a deep sleep.
“Ow!!”
Harry shook his head it was too perfect a moment to spoil it.
If only his father knew about this. The though both scared him and amused him.
Draco rolled over, sat up and repeated his previous question.
This gained him another pillow to the face “You’ll run out”
After keeping his eyes closed for a few minutes he opened them again, blinked, then blinked again. Then it hit him, why where the bed sheets red?
Uni has been an absolute ball-ache but is finished for the summer so hopefully more chapter updates!!
Draco let out an irritated noise and lifted his head up off the desk.
He must have been lost in his own thoughts as he hadn’t noticed Harry walk over to him, until he was stood right in front of him their noses almost touching. “Come with me?”
“Where? I thought you were going to find Ginny.”
“Do you want to make them stare some more?”
Fourth year had been the Triwizard tournament and had been filled with multiple different whispers, some caused by Rita Skeeter!
There was a pause before Potter slowly nodded his head. Malfoy chuckled, if his father could see him now.
“I showed my feelings by accident.”
Something flashed over Potter’s face but Draco couldn’t tell what it.
Once at the door he looked in and saw Potter, whats he doing in here? Potter had never been a fan of potions, except in 6th year when he was scarily good at it.
Harry was stood in the middle of the room looking as gobsmacked as Draco, he held a letter out towards him;
During the lesson Harry couldn’t help but notice how close he and Draco were sat. The tables were large enough to have a cauldron on yet they were sat very close to each other, they were on different sides but they were close to the corner. His mind kept reminding him off this all the way through the lesson making the blood rise in his cheeks, this blush was deepened when Draco leaned into him and whispered:
“Offence taken but I see your point.” He had to smile, he had been certain Potter despised him for his part in the war, maybe he was wrong.
“Malfoy? You okay?”
Once they made their way back to Hogwarts none of them had any room for dinner so they made their way towards the Gryffindor common room. Neither the fat lady nor any of the Gryffindor students batted an eyelid or questioned the fact that Draco was with them, some of the students even smiled at him, said hi or asked how his day was.
“I’m sure it’s fine, anyway you’re with me!”

“Great.”
Draco stepped out of the shower still recovering from what had happened, if Ron hadn’t walked in he wasn’t sure how far they would have gone, the shower had helped calm him.
Hermione just gave him a small smile and pulled him into a hug, it felt almost like a mum hug, in his ear she whispered “and I apologise for punching you in the face”.
They started laughing and carried on walking “it was a good punch and I deserved it”.
Ron coughed, scratched his head and stated very loudly that he was “going to go get a shower.”
Ron just shook his head and started walking, Draco behind him.
Love BobIII xxx
“In my…”
“I don’t know”, Potter looked up at him defeated, he stared into Draco’s eyes and held them, Draco felt the frustration seeping out of him.
Draco rolled over, sat up and repeated his previous question.
“Next to your…”
“Off course I did, I’m the youngest out of a group of boys, I know how to manipulate situations” she sent him a proud smile, then turned to Draco, “look after him won’t you? He’s not very good at it, he might have survived the war but it was mostly luck.”
Harry found himself being pulled into a hug he felt Malfoys arms tighten around and he let himself e held.
After clearing his throat Harry spoke, talking mostly to the floor than Draco.
Harry chuckled, “why don’t we buy some sweets and find somewhere to sit? We can then meet up with the others later and walk back to school?”
“people think we’re having an affair?”
“Probably? You’re not sure?”
“no…….?”
He was still thinking all this when they entered the room. A huge banner hung from the ceiling that would change from ‘DRARRY’ then to ‘FINALLY’. He really needed to talk to Harry.
but no one stopped them.
He nodded in agreement and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
i am so so sorry this has taken so long!!
"HOW DARE YOU!" then he felt the sting of a slap,
Why did Ron and Hermione keep looking over at him and Draco? He’d noticed it at soon as potions had started. Because they were only a small class, the pupils had been sat with each pair having their own table. Ron and Hermione taking the table to the right of Harry and Draco.
Draco had lost the feeling in his face around the 5
The golden trio were being overly friendly and what was up with Potter? The guy who had been the bane of his life for the entirety of his time at Hogwarts was trying to be his best friend?
Draco nodded, it was the only action he could do in his bemused state. His day was taking a strange, yet fantastic, turn.
So when Draco shouted “POTTER!” it came as a shock to everyone, including Harry.
Draco had no idea why he did what he did next, he grabbed Potter and pulled him into a hug and held him. Draco Malfoy was hugging Harry Potter.
“I don’t know”,
Harry’s eyes bugged out of his face,
What was he meant to do?
“Where are you going?!?” Draco was hoping to ask this is in a calm voice but had failed and shouted it at Potter.
“Do you remember when we agreed Hermione and Ron were oblivious to their feelings for each other? You’re worse.”
____________________
Time stopped, Harry didn't know someone so pale could blush as much as Draco was doing now. He could hear his own heart beat speed up, why had she said that? Then he saw her face she was sending him a mischievous smile, almost daring him to do exactly what his heart was telling him to. She really did know him better than anyone.
“That’s what I keep asking myself? You shouted Potter at me. You do that when I’m in trouble, or you’re stressed.”
Harry got off the bed and pulled him into a hug and held him tight, his heart was beating fast, and not from what had happened with Draco though that had caused it to beat incredibly fast, but from what felt like relief. He knew Ron would accept him and be happy for him but there had still been a small bit of worry, which he could only assume was natural, but to hear Ron say that he was his brother and that he accepted him no matter what, that had caused him to have a sudden rush of emotions, “I love you so much Ron”.
Ginny’s response was a raised eyebrow and to put her book on the side table.
The entire walk from the dungeon Harry had wanted to turn around and check that Malfoy was still following him, but the distinct sound Malfoys shoes made where enough to make him keep on looking forward. If only he could think of a destination for where he was going.
“You planned this all along didn’t you?” Harry raised his eyebrow at her.
Enjoy
“How long have you had to put up with this for?”
“Of course”
Harry just continued to gawp at her. She waved her hand in front of him, clicked her fingers, then gave up and just waited for him to emerge from his current state of confusion.
Ron let out a long groan, but he smiled, “I’m glad you’re happy, you won’t be my brother in law but your still my brother, and strangely Draco is my sort of brother in law.” This comment gained him a pillow to his face, “hey!! I’m not wrong!”
That last question was the confusing, since when did Draco stair at Potter’s arse? And why did he think it was good? This was all getting very ridiculous.
Harry tilted his head up a bit “you think im pretty?” He fluttered his lashes.
He spent the rest of the day hiding out in the library. One thing about being a known ex-death eater, people tended to stay away from you.
He saw Potter, Weasley, female Weasley and Granger get onto train and was about to follow and ask to sit with them, but changed his mind. Why would they want to sit with him? They must despise him.
Harry was having a dilemma, an adorable and snoring dilemma.
When it came to going to bed Draco started to walk to the exit and make his way to the Slytherin  common room when Ron grabbed his arm, “where you off to?”
“What?”
The Sorting Hat said its poem, a poem of remembrance for those who fought in the war, how all houses were now united and how everyone need to support each other and get rid of old prejudices and feuds. There was a mixture of clapping and tears when it finished.
This was moment everything changed. He moved through the crowd of people towards Draco. When he got there he grabbed Draco shoulders, pulled him towards him and kissed him there and then, if the hug had felt right, this felt like fate.
When the castle eventually came into view it looked the same as it always had, they must have decided to build it exactly the same as it had been before, the turrets rising into the twilight sky and castle windows all lit up with a yellow glow from the candles inside. It was the same old Hogwarts as it had always been. If Draco looked close enough he could see the boats the first years were on slowly moving towards the castle.
“I did that to get your attention and for old times’ sake because I’m hoping that it’s not going to be your last name for much longer.”
“So?” Hermione queried?
He didn’t get very far.
They stood there for a while till Draco finally broke the silence, “what’s wrong?”
“Now shush I’ve practiced this and you’re ruining it.” He cleared his throat like a town crier would before a long speech.
After a couple of minutes they pulled away from each other. They stood there both breathing deeply and looking into the others eyes, both with big grins.
“Yes, but I’m hungry and need food!” Draco grabbed his bag and started walking to the door.
“So what’s with all the fire whisky?”
“No no, you said something.”
"LIKE YOU WOULD LISTEN YOUR TOO BUSY WITH QUIDDITCH TO CARE, I CAN NEVER FIND YOU!"
“I know!!”
“Starving!” Harry lead the way through the big doors and walked to where Hermione and Ron where sat.
He must have thought Malfoy name too much because he was all of a sudden in front of him.
They all went silent for a while, Hermione and Ron ended up playing chess, giving Ginny and Harry something to watch, chess had never been more domestic. Hermione ended up winning by reaching over towards Ron, brushing his hair behind his ear, “accidently” giving him a view down her shirt, making Ron blush and leave the room.
He started to move his hand towards Malfoy’s face but one word made him drop his hand and walk away….Ginny.
What Harry didn’t know was that the exact same thing was happening with Draco.
Harry smiled and stroked the blondes hair,
It was one of the best weekend Draco had had at Hogwarts.
hope you enjoyed this short-ish chapter
“it’s a good thing your pretty” she stroked his hair.
“I don’t know”,
“Where stood here with two very empty beds and where talking about Rons singing voice.”
He sat at the foot of his bed holding a bacon butty on his lap and gazing at the other boy. He then shuffled further up the bed, being cautious to not disturb sleeping beauty, he placed the food on his night stand and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead and stood to leave.
Harry POV
“That’s you...”
­­___________________
Once they made their way back to Hogwarts none of them had any room for dinner so they made their way towards the Gryffindor common room. Neither the fat lady nor any of the Gryffindor students batted an eyelid or questioned the fact that Draco was with them, some of the students even smiled at him, said hi or asked how his day was.
“How’s it going?” she asked, lifting her book up slightly so she could see his face.
“That might have been part of it yes, but mostly no.”
“Off course I did, I’m the youngest out of a group of boys, I know how to manipulate situations” she sent him a proud smile, then turned to Draco, “look after him won’t you? He’s not very good at it, he might have survived the war but it was mostly luck.”
“I don’t think they want it plastered on the front of every magazine and everyone coming up with theories about why.”
“What’s happened to Harry?” a groggy Draco was stood on the stares rubbing sleep out of his eyes.
Ron’s face fell, the split had been hard on both Harry and Ginny. The split had happened a couple of months after the battle of Hogwarts. The end of the war had been hard on Harry, everyone could see it. He wouldn’t eat, hardly slept and became very quiet and spent most of the time on his own. Ginny had tried to be supportive but he just pushed her away, they eventually agreed to end it but keep the split secret, Harry was still all over the magazines and they both thought it best to keep this away from the gossip columns.
“Where have you been?” the recognisable voice of Hermione reached his ears.
Draco lifted his head enough to say “sorry” then flopped his head down again.
“There’s was no way I could win.” She looked very proud of herself.
Harry stood up, almost threw the bacon butty at Draco and walked towards the door.
Harry tilted his head up a bit “you think im pretty?” He fluttered his lashes.
Let the show begin….
Both Harry and Draco put on faces of pure innocence, “So what?” Draco asked, finding full enjoyment out of this whole experience.
Draco turned to Harry, “Charms?”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” He then got off his stool and wrote their names down on the list at the front. They spent the rest of the lesson making a Draught of peace. Potter knew that Malfoy was one of the better potions students and just did as Malfoy instructed him.
Getting off the Hogwarts Express was a weird experience. The knowledge of what had occurred here the year before, the death and destruction of the war and wondering if the school was going to feel the same.
Once they reached the great hall doors, Draco paused. He had no one to sit with at the Slytherin table.
“Why are we at the top of some stairs?” Now Harry was fully confused. He recognised these stairs from somewhere, all Hogwart’s stairs look the same, but there was something about these specific ones.
All of a sudden the great hall broke into applause with a chorus of whoops and cheers and a couple of ‘Finally!’s thrown in. the two of them stood there bemused and completely in shock, not only because of the positive reaction they had got but also because they had spotted money being exchanged between students, and also some professors.
People used find this a usual occurrence, it was Harry and Draco, before the Battle of Hogwarts they used to always be arguing about something, Merlin knows what: quidditch? Or Just Draco being a spoilt brat? Some girls used to hope that it was because they had suppressed feelings for each. Sometimes girls can be very perceptive.
The time had come they chose to it around lunchtime when most students would be walking around the castle, the bigger the audience the quicker the news would spread, even though it was Hogwarts and news spread ridiculously fast.
Draco quickly looked away, “it’s just a recurring dream I have, im in Malfoy manor and im walking down a corridor I don’t know, then someone shouts av…ava…the killing curse then I wake up.”
"MAYBE YOU CAN'T FIND ME BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH DRACO!"
He couldn’t remember how he had ended up in the dungeon or why, but once he had seen Malfoy he knew he wanted wherever he was going to be with the blonde slytherin.
“Ginny, that’s evil”
Ginny ran over to them, “that went well I think”, her hands were on her hips and she was looking around nodding.
Enjoy
“So what happened?”
Draco let him go, looked him up and down, “I can see what Hermione sees in you”
“I needed some time by myself”
“You watched me sleep? That’s kind of stalkery.”
“It’s what school does to you mate” this had Weasley receive evils from Granger that dissipated when he kissed her cheek.
He carried on going but harry just watched him, it was the cutest drunk ramble he had seen, Ron’s were usually incoherent except for the word Hermione, he was sure Hermione got more intelligent when she drank who can say discombobulate when drunk? But with Draco he just looked more human, more animated, than the persona he showed, and Harry knew exactly how to shut him up.
“So fancy being partners?”
please leave any comments you have!!
HE WAS IN HARRYS BED!!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione just walked up and placed a hand on his cheek, “you okay?”
Draco shared there confusion, how was this happening, he’d been back at Hogwarts for one night and already things were changing, it made him feel slightly uncomfortable, he was also being made uncomfortable by the worried looks Potter kept sending him,
“Thank you for your help.”
“With my hands Potter how else would I carry it, my feet?” and to prove his point he placed it on the floor and proceeded to lift it, almost falling backwards off the bench.
So when he heard Harry calling his name, even though it sounded distant and as if it was coming through water, Draco just sent him what he thought was a flirtatious smile.
Before Draco could defend himself, a Malfoy never got drunk, they were always composed and dignified, Ginny walked past “He’s drunk the bottle.”
“I know.” Harry smiled to himself, “they don’t just magically appear on train tables”
His dilemma was the blonde Slytherin that was currently sprawled across his bed and drooling on his pillow.  For the last couple of minutes he had been having an exchange with the blonde consisting of him whispering “Draco” and gaining the response *snore*.
“Okay” Harry must have taken this as some king of hint for him to leave as he tuned to go, with a look on his face that looked like he was disappointed with this turn of events, “I’ll leave you alone then.”

He smiled at her, “hey, you okay?”
and he had lost any inhibitions he had left around the 10
Once they reached the great hall doors, Draco paused. He had no one to sit with at the Slytherin table.
“You know I meant nothing by that.”
He stepped defeated into the common room.
That last question was the confusing, since when did Draco stair at Potter’s arse? And why did he think it was good? This was all getting very ridiculous.
The first years were sorted into their houses all welcomed with open arms and the Headmistress McGonagall got up and did her final speech encouraging everyone to do their best etc etc, Draco just wanted to get to bed.
“He watched his parents flirt” Ginny sent him a smile, “how you feeling buddy?”
They stood hugging each other for a few minutes when they were suddenly both enveloped in a wash of mint and soggy arms encapsulated them both, “Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
“Do you think they have any idea?” Ron whispered to Hermione, he had his arm slung over her shoulder making it easy to talk quietly enough for just her to hear.
Hermione sighed, “I just wish Harry and Ginny would make it public about their split.”
“What are we? Us two. Are we a couple? Ginny and the whole school seem to think but we haven’t had a chance to talk about it! Do you want to be a couple? I know you kissed me but you might have just been swept up in the moment! I really like you, like really really like you to the point that I drink a full bottle and a half, I had some before the whole argument in the entrance, to get the courage to tell you I really really like…”
“No idea” Harry turned towards him and kissed him gently.
He must have thought Malfoy name too much because he was all of a sudden in front of him.
This was moment everything changed. He moved through the crowd of people towards Draco. When he got there he grabbed Draco shoulders, pulled him towards him and kissed him there and then, if the hug had felt right, this felt like fate.
Draco blushed he had never been that forward before.
im so sorry this has taken to so long
He didn’t get very far.
“I don’t know what we are Draco, but I do two things, one that I really really like you too, and two that you are very drunk, I would kiss you very passionately but I would feel like I was taking advantage of you. But know this Draco Malfoy, I, Harry Potter, like you very much and would like to carry on this conversation when you aren’t brimming with fire whisky.”
Why did Ron and Hermione keep looking over at him and Draco? He’d noticed it at soon as potions had started. Because they were only a small class, the pupils had been sat with each pair having their own table. Ron and Hermione taking the table to the right of Harry and Draco.
“What did you say?”
Draco looked at him eyes wide and repeated his previous question but with a lot more volume and followed by Harry raising his eye brows and walking towards Draco’s bed.
Frustrated, Draco broke the song off mid-bar. He searched his brains for something cheerful, but hardly anything popped up. In the end, he reckoned Abba could never be considered depressing. He started
On top of being an unfair prefect, Draco was a lazy one. He’d shout ‘I will report you!’ at the drop of a hat, but never actually bothered to. Having to go all the way up to someone’s Head of House to make a report just seemed like a drag to him – and, by the way, didn’t he read somewhere that punishment should follow right after the crime for it to work?
Draco couldn’t remember the last time
‘Our alacritous auror,’ Draco said another day, ‘took up jogging today. It was a brisk jog through the park, our sources let us know. He took a turn around the pond and circled back to the entrance to stretch his strong auror muscles. If our sources could tell us what
Potter looked at his shoes. ‘I just know.’
‘A right pain. Here’s your tea and please silence me before I say anything I’ll regret again.’ Draco moved slowly to bring Harry his tea in person.
Harry slouched back to his seat. ‘I dropped them in the ocean, once or twice; gives it a bit of… tang – oh, right, that’s what I was saying: do you think it’s a problem we’ve been live all this time? Or do you suppose all four of your listeners have tuned out by now anyway?’
looked nice.
Draco showed a faint smirk. ‘No, I’m Junkie-Draco,’ he sneered. ‘Far more approachable.’
‘He did,’ grunted Goyle.
Snape raised an eyebrow. ‘The disappointing quality of your latest essay? I’m afraid so, yes…’
The sound quickly got on Draco’s nerve. ‘Maybe your
All four Slytherins grinned as Crabbe shook his head. ‘Just did my job. Beaters hit Bludgers.’ He shrugged and Goyle guffawed.
Suddenly, right in the middle of their conversation, people started to scream way worse than before. Someone pointed at the forest behind the group, and whirling around, they saw something vast, green and glittering erupting. It flew up over the tree tops and into the sky.
Being in second year meant a fresh load of younger students – and a fresh new load of admirers for The Boy Who Lived.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. ‘Cat got your tongue?’
Reluctantly, Draco looked up from their game. ‘Well, I suppose Granger and… you know, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.’ He pretended to shudder.
A glass case held a withered hand on a cushion, a blood stained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil- looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.
Pansy’s wand jabbed into Draco’s throat. ‘Tell and you’re dead,’ she hissed with that look she reserved for people who took the last muffin during breakfast, only turned up to eleven.
The man started begging – it was a disgrace.
‘Now,’ said Yaxley. ‘Who wants to try resisting an Imperius Curse?’
‘Say something then.’
I am.’
‘Pretty awkward,’ agreed Barney. He looked at Draco like he expected him to say more and Draco shrugged.
‘Now that you are all familiar with Dragon’s Arum,’ said Sprout, ‘I have an announcement to make. The Yule Ball is approaching; a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests.’
When Draco fell into step, it occurred to him how good it felt. Over the course of the morning he’d started feeling as at ease as when he was wearing the pendant, and even though they were on a boring, fruitless quest, he was enjoying himself.
‘Thank you, Gregory, I will Floo your mother with the details,’ said Draco’s mother. ‘We will pick you up on Monday, Draco.’ And without so much as a goodbye, she vanished from the flames.
Pansy walked forward, her face set. A bloodstained, bandaged mummy stepped out of the wardrobe; its sightless face was turned to Pansy and it began to walk towards her, very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising –
The worst thing was how alarmingly distracted Draco was by these worries.
‘What, you don’t see it?’
‘You are the rudest auror I have ever met.’ Draco, jumped back a few feet. ‘I could report you, you know.’
Instantly, Harry deflated.
‘The upside of being a liar.’
That morning, Draco had trouble letting the words go. He tugged at Pansy’s coat on their way to class and muttered, ‘Do you think Granger is pretty?’
‘Harry?’
Draco frowned. It was legit a fair question. He asked his father, ‘What colour is gold?’
When the coach finally landed, shaking them so their shoulders bumped into each other, Harry leaned over and picked up Draco’s chin. Before he could think of pulling away, their lips touched and a soft, involuntary whimper escaped him. A second later, Draco was left abandoned one last time.
Instantly, Pansy stepped close to the Captain, who was at least twice as broad as her and towered over her in length as well, but she picked up her chin and made her toes touch Flint’s.
Draco’s father squared his shoulders. His anger melted into a smirk and he touched Draco’s chin. ‘Make us proud, Dragon-child.’
Harry stared at him, frowning like he was solving a difficult riddle.
‘I do have an idea,’ snarled Malfoy. ‘I had to live with him for the entire summer.’
‘So, Draco,’ said Zabini, pointedly ignoring the new addition to their group, ‘fifteen Galleons –’
‘No, he is not. He is bad news. A terrible influence, if you ask me.’
Draco racked his brain. Then he remembered. ‘Oh man, is this about the Fae?’
‘Oh, oh, he-hello, mister Malfoy,’ she mumbled, before getting back to her birdwatching. With her arms hidden in heavy, felt robes – giving her tall body an oval shape – Agatha Malfoy rather resembled an owl herself.  ‘We – we got another one... Ju-just flew in…’
Suddenly, Draco caught sight of Weasley, standing alone, leaning on a fence to watch the Shrieking Shack. Draco felt his face split in a malevolent grin.
and the
Feeling oddly hurt, Harry let his arm slide from Malfoy's leg. ‘No… Nevermind.’
Draco almost knocked over his ink, and he wasn’t the only one who got a start: a few tables away, a Hufflepuff girl clutched her chest with a throaty 'My word!'
‘She drives me positively bonkers,’ Pansy replied in a monotone.
‘You alright?’ asked Gregory.
He arranged himself between the trees, away from the crowd, enabling him to watch the show at the campsite in peace. After a while, the relative quiet was disturbed by noisy footsteps and a low, slow voice he recognized out of thousands. ‘Hermione?’
She scootched over on the stool to make room for Draco, who put his hands above the keys to mimic her movements as she played, to get a first feel for the song.
‘Maybe you should talk to someone who actually knows about these things.’
‘It’s technically impossible. Whatever.’ Harry inched still closer. From up close, Draco’s shirt had tiny birds on them, faintly yellow against the white cotton. ‘What is this town keeping from me? What is everyone afraid of?’ Harry inspected Malfoy's pointy face for hints at what he was hiding. ‘Are you being threatened?’
‘Hm. And then probably that gal of his too, little Whatsername, spawn of that Sacred Twenty-Eight renegade… Abbott.’
Pansy froze. For a second, she looked confused. Then, her chin dropped to the ground.
, Nottingham.’
… Loony Lovegood. Wait till I tell – ’
She’d always been unsupportive of Draco’s aesthetic. For instance, every summer she would try to convince him to get out of the shade, to get some vitamin D or – oh horror – “grab a tan”. It was infuriating how adamant she was on cramping his style.
It was still an hour until showtime. Draco felt exhausted. He’d tired himself out.
‘Because, Malfoy, I am tired of the questions,’ Nott snarled. ‘Every single time people find out I have diabetes, I have to give a half hour speech on what it is, how it works, how I deal with it, bla bla bla –’
‘You’re scaring no one, you know! Your filthy scar and inflated ego have no effect in our town!’
Potter didn’t even look.
‘Did he declare her his love?’ Draco drawled. ‘That’s what he usually does, you see, when–’
‘How do you think we should do this?’ Harry asked. He looked around. ’Dra? Draco?’
‘Calming herbs,’ said Bulstrode softly. She leaned her head against the stone wall and closed her eyes. She did seem entirely calm.
‘Parkinson!’ Draco snapped, lowering his voice to a furious hiss. ‘Get up! You know what that dirtbag Warrington tells everyone about girls with bruises on their knees.’
. Potter pulled up and Draco saw his own grievance mirrored in his homeb– in his enemy’s face.
Indeed, there were scorch marks on Draco’s trousers.
‘No,’ Harry admitted softly, and he took another little pull. As he blew out, he sat back in his chair and handed Draco his whisky mug in return. ‘You know what I think is funny about you?’ While Draco sipped, Harry continued, ‘When we were taken to Malfoy Manor and they forced you to identify me and you just straight up shrugged and told them, “Nah, don't know him, sorry, never seen this bloke in my life.”’ Harry laughed. ‘You were like… I'm gonna face this danger by denial.’
Draco let out a weird giggle, both the boys' senses of humour touched by the substances.
Draco’s mouth fell open. Quickly he scribbled, ‘The Chamber of Secrets is in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?!’
‘Not NOW, Taylor! Can’t you see we’re busy?!’
Draco glanced lazily over his shoulder at the bowl balancing on the soundboard. ‘I like them like that. Hmmmaybe I can fit you in… hmmm… Monday.’
There was no trace of either Potter nor Weasley. Granger
Father huffed. ‘Alright, very well. When we go to collect your school supplies you can choose something from Borgin & Burkes.’
‘Okay, now you’re just harassing him,’ said Pansy, putting a firm hand on Tracey’s shoulder to bring her down. ‘You know he’s not interested, babe. He just prefers brooms, it’s nothing personal.’
Too dazed to talk, he put his good arm around the small of her back and allowed himself to lean on her.
. . .
Draco muttered something incomprehensible, squirming away from Pansy’s stare. The lightning bolt actually had left a faint scar.
‘Miss Parkinson,’ Snape drawled, ‘if you have any evidence that mister Montague was taken by the Heir of Slytherin, please tell me at once. If not, kindly refrain from commenting.’
‘Not now, Draco dear, I am very busy.’ She didn’t even look up from the seating chart in front of her.
Draco gaped at him. ‘You have a godfather?’
It was indeed a beautiful day for a jog. So, going back home to change into his joggers and a t-shirt, Harry made his way to the park for a jog around the pond (and back to the entrance to stretch his auror muscles).
As Draco disclosed the plan in full detail, Nott sat back and shook his head. He just kept shaking his head, driving Draco insane.
‘Guess who saved the girl and slayed the monster?’ Pansy grinned broadly.
‘I need to
‘In English, you prat!’
‘Who knows,’ Draco drawled, turning away as casually as he could manage. ‘Even a Niffler couldn’t find a coin in there… I guess I dozed off… could you read any slower?’
As he slammed the compartment door close behind him – hearing another round of Exploding Snap hitting the floor – he kept one hand firmly around Nott’s weedy arm as the boy kept trying to shake him off. ‘Keep
you going with?’
Pansy smiled angelically at the odd looks from their spectators as they danced.
For a solid three seconds, Pansy just stared at something in her hand. Then she started screaming –
‘I can easily tell you everything, if you want,’ Draco proudly offered. After all, he knew everything about everything. Then he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. A huge man was standing outside the front window, grinning and pointing at two large ice-creams. ‘Look at that man!’
‘Dra…’ Harry touched his sleeve. ‘Don’t.’
The benefits of owning a dragon far outweighed any objections his parents could come up with, he was sure of it.
Draco pulled Crabbe and Goyle behind the doors of the Great Hall to watch.
He turned away and saw a dark cabinet. It looked perfectly ordinary, a little boring even, but he felt a hint of magic oozing from it. Father said not to touch anything, but Draco itched to look inside...
Professor Grubbly-Plank led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and towards a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered. Many of the girls ‘ooooohed!’ at the sight of the unicorn.
‘No.’ He tried to coax her aside. ‘I just came to take a look behind the dumpster –’
Draco was not impressed. He wanted to see the Chamber of Secrets. He wanted to know who the Heir was. He demanded answers!
. . .
The Slytherins were laughing again, their questions about Draco’s love life momentarily forgotten.
Draco had barely reached the Slytherin table when he got pulled into a frantic discussion with the Quidditch team. He pulled away from Montague’s grip, who growled, ‘We need permission to practice, Malfoy!’
that he calls you Dra!’
‘He doesn’t care.’
Harry turned round to shoot him a look, which made Draco smirk – and look away. Because by Merlin, was Potter the prize. As far as prizes went, Potter was the Order of Merlin. Not for the first time – nor the last – Draco wondered how he’d gotten himself in this position: holding hands with The Boy Who Lived,
He put a hand to his mouth to make a horn. ‘So we tell them!’
‘I understand, sir, of course,’ said Mr. Borgin. ‘Let me see…’
Pansy shrugged. ‘Fine, I’ll Floo her tonight.’
‘ – As I walk down the dungeon,’ sang the walls.
‘PISS OFF!’ Pansy and Gregory bellowed in unison.
He didn’t know how long he’d been playing when the door hurled open and the violin bow was forced from his hand by Pansy, who whacked him around the head with it in one move. ‘NO! What happened? I’m gone for
‘Well... you are my girl friend.’ He emphasized the break between the words. Pansy’s brows flew up even higher and his hands shot up like he was under attack. ‘Zabini was hitting on me! I panicked! You can’t blame me!’
Harry pulled Draco’s hand in his lap. ‘That wasn’t foolish.’
To distract himself from his animal urges, Draco started carefully rolling up his sleeves, while Harry took off his cloak, leaving him standing in a moss green shirt with the sleeve buttons loose, showing a peek at his forearms.
The Slytherins let out a sympathetic "Oooh" before launching into a fit of laughter again. Bell’s nose was bleeding and the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering.
Girls were screeching in his ears, sobbing hysterically. The frightened crowd was gasping, screaming and shouting.
Sitting at the Slytherin table for breakfast on the morning of the third Triwizard Task, Draco kept his mind busy with the latest article about Harry Potter in the Daily Prophet.
One time, Pansy bellowed after him as he jumped on a moving staircase, ‘You’re a cowardly little asshole, Potter!’ Harry turned a shade darker, but pretended not to hear her, so Pansy shouted louder, ‘AT LEAST HAVE THE BALLS TO END IT!’
‘What did they look like?’ Draco asked.
They were standing awfully close together in the cramped, dim hallway, but Draco didn’t seem as affected by their close proximity as Harry was, and was glancing past him to fix his hair in the mirror. ‘Tea, coffee or water?’ he asked as he swaggered off to the miniature kitchen.
to his Defence against the Dark Arts class, there was a hold up in the East wing.
It worked: Harry started stammering. ‘I just… wondered… Well, in the summer… You’d look – I mean… If we went swimming - It would be nice… I suppose. That’s all…’
‘Yes, got to go.’
Standing outside, away from everyone, Draco put away his wand and lifted his arms. ‘Hit me with your best shot.’
‘I’m so jealous,’ moaned Peregrine Derrick.
‘Why bother?’ Draco felt absolutely miserable. ‘He hates me.’
I read that it can turn black overnight and then there’s nothing anyone can do about it. It’ll fall clean off, you see.’
She looked at him with a knowing smile, that told Draco absolutely nothing.
Harry opened his mouth, but closed it again and dropped his gaze, marvellously confirming Draco’s claim. ‘It’s… It’s your dad–’
Draco jumped. The French words sounded angry and sarcastic; Draco’s kind of people!
‘Amazing,’ he whispered.
Draco jumped up. ‘Does it work, Professor?’
. . .
… He is absolutely perfect in every way.’
As quickly as he had shrunk, Draco was growing again. Upwards he shot, until he was his own size again. The fur retreated, then vanished completely.
The laughter of his house mates died away as Draco read the rest of the article in silence, frowning.
The three girls squeaked in fear and huddled closer together, showing each other their tongues, which were tied in a knot. Their crowd quickly fled.
‘Yep,’ said Moody.
The assistant forcefully put the robes over his head. Draco was fuming. ‘My mother will hear about this! She would not appreciate me walking around with second-rate clothing.’
‘How would you know?’
Draco’d brought the Hand of Glory, so he could see in the dark corridors of the castle. Draco led them out of the common room, then turned to Nott, sneering, ‘Well, take it away, Navigator Nott.’
,’ Draco snarled, ‘it is a logical consequence.’
‘Dear boy, are you still on about that? Don’t fret your pretty head.’
Harry’s stomach turned. For once in his life, he wished he could think for a moment before throwing a raging tantrum on live radio.
Suddenly, Draco gasped. ‘The hat’s been tempered with!’
‘No, I dunno…’
‘What makes you think I told them?’
‘A law! A Muggle Protection law! As if Muggles need protection! As if they were not perfectly capable of slaughtering half our bloodline as it is! As if their filthy existence deserves protection! It is a fraud, a thinly veiled ruse to get into the homes of us dark wizards! If this law gets accepted, that flea-bag Weasley will finally have a legal excuse to search our home! Under the guise of searching for dark artefacts!
‘Aaaaaaayo!’ shouted the castle.
Draco leaned over to hold the joint to Harry's lips. ‘You don't mean that.’
‘What could possibly need such protection?’ Harry Potter asked, stifling a yawn.
Draco smirked.
‘I’m always thinking about you. When you’re hurt, I’m hurt. I
Meanwhile, his grass green eyes stood out between two thick layers of ink black eyelashes and seemed almost luminous beneath his dark, shading eyebrows. He looked like a mix of Heathcliff and Peter Pan, who, unfortunately, just happened to be two of Draco’s favourite fictional characters.
‘That’s an easy one,’ Draco cut in, a bit too loudly because of the used substances. ‘Fighting crime and running in circles.’
, I have to show you something. Up, up!’
. . .
During Christmas Break, his father had explained that it would put a blemish on the entire Malfoy name if Draco harmed Harry Potter or did anything that wasn’t aiding in securing a friendship. Father still had hope of Harry becoming a glorious Dark Wizard, and even if he didn’t, it couldn’t hurt to be friends with the most famous wizard in the country. Mother said if Draco couldn’t say anything nice, he shouldn’t say anything at all.
‘Well done, Harry!’ said Hagrid, ecstatically. ‘Right – yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!’
Through the haze of panic, he heard laughter, cheers and a shout of ‘They’re heading for the forest!’, followed by the slamming of a door – and then silence. Apart from Draco’s screams of pain and horror, and the terrible flapping of bat wings, no one made any sound.
Unfortunately, he'd lost Stanley's attention. ‘Hey, Desi!’
With mock-patience, Harry reminded him. ‘I slashed you to a bloody mess, remember? In the boys’ bathroom.’
Pansy sighed deeply, but gave in. ‘Everywhere we go-o,’ she sang.
Malfoy tipped his head to the side. ‘Slash home. Why?’
allowed to bring their broomstick. It just doesn’t make sense!’
‘And join Slytherin,’ Pansy jeered. ‘Right?’
‘Harry Potter.’
person I want to see, Potter!’
Draco furrowed his brow. ‘Well, no, but…’
‘I do not want you to tell him this,’ boomed Father. ‘Filling his head with lies will only confuse our boy.’
Draco jumped behind Snape, but Potter was moving closer to the snake with a strangely foggy look in his eyes. He seemed slightly possessed. A weird noise resounded through the Great Hall. It sounded like hissing, but instead of coming from the snake… it came from Harry Potter.
Love, Draco.’
’ Draco lashed out from the bottom of his heart. ‘So, to recap,’ he snarled, counting along on his fingers. ‘Flint and Wood don’t want us to play Quidditch together. Snape doesn’t want us to work together. Harry’s dumb friends are convinced I’ll
Draco grabbed her arm, yanked the door close and in the same move he pulled his precious note out of Vincent’s grubby hands. ‘No, you will not! This is
‘Same pairs as usual. Thirty minutes.’
Draco panted. ‘You’re on the
She almost died laughing.
Harry tried to ignore the cannabis scent drifting out of the house. He didn’t dare look at his watch, afraid it would look like judgement, but he was sure it wasn't even ten.
‘I don’t know what Flint wanted to accomplish, but he’s been letting you slack off for way too long.’
Thinking he would be a complete buffoon to let go of Harry’s hand as long as Harry held on to his, Draco went about to pour in drinks with only one hand.
‘Henry,’ the women scoffed and shook their heads above their sewing projects. ‘That old fart,’ muttered one of them darkly.
in company, but quickly regained her composure. ‘Well, would you like to play us something then?’
, I don’t
Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom – and Draco Malfoy’s favourite aunt.
With an aggressive motion, Draco yanked himself loose from Pansy. He had no choice now but to follow the other Slytherins to their common room.
‘Lucius,’ said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.
Behind them, Bagman was talking about the championship and the next task, but Draco did not want to think about that just yet. As he slipped his comfortably beating ring back on his finger, Draco thought about the way Harry’d looked at him. The following weeks, Harry would have oceans of time again… oceans of time for Draco.
‘Aw, did he get permission from your father to be your date?’
They all watched how Madame Pomfrey patched Fleur up, for lack of anything else to see. Pansy seized Draco’s sweaty hands to paint his nails silver and after that, they waited a bit more.
Harry pressed it.
At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Draco left the Slytherin Dungeons for the History of Magic classroom, where he would have to reveal his biggest secret and worst fear to some shady Professor he only just met.
From further down the table Pansy called, ‘Next time, do us all a favour and ask him out!’
With a paper bag full of snacks and another one with just a hotdog, Draco hurried up to the library, where his sour-looking buddy was sitting at a table, already scratching away on a piece of parchment.
As it was, he stood alone for a while longer, feeling less cheerful than before Potter had come along.
Draco heaved the heaviest sigh he could muster. ‘Let’s
,’ Draco loudly said, ‘or
Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder. The Mudblood offered Potter her handkerchief, which he wrapped around his hand. Draco, feeling victorious, laughed derisively.
And so he started searching the Muggle section of the library for books about music, but there was an entire shelf devoted to it. For a second he felt overwhelmed. He wanted to be quick; how come there was so many shelf-space devoted to boring Muggles?
Father rolled his eyes, shook his head and sighed.
‘Shut up, Pansy, they are not! The only one in this school with a weird nose is you, and everyone knows it!’
Before Draco could snarl at him, the crowd collectively gasped. There was an upsurge of noise as people jumped to see what happened. Draco climbed on his chair to look over the crowd.
His father didn’t even look up from their shopping list. ‘You do as you are told.’
The doors slammed shut behind Harry. Hands in his sides, he looked around at the courtyard of the community centre. A basketball net swayed in the wind, but other than that, there was nothing to see but the moss growing between the tiles.
‘Stupid girl… You let the bastards mess with your head.’
‘Hmm,’ said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Draco could still hear her quite clearly. ‘I wonder – the Headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter – can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very extended leave of absence?’
aren’t my Boggart, Harry – your...’ He took a shaky, anxious breathe. ‘Your reaction is.’
‘Of course, I’m prepared,’ Draco lied, smoothly running a hand through his hair.
‘Good,’ Potter called after her, ‘I’ve got enough to cope with at the moment.’
They sniggered as they made their way into the forest, following their world-weary Gryffindor counterparts for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground.
‘Alright, that was unfair. Harry Potter is a very smart man, and I shouldn't roll my eyes just because he doesn't comprehend microphone etiquette or basic hair care… Hair and body soap… the very idea! Gosh, and here I was, placing my bets on Mr Dandy's Hair Candy… Words fail me. Ah well, you can't roll six every time, I suppose. Harry obviously has a lot of other intriguing interests. Like… brooms. And the Black family history, apparently. So, for all of you children listening –’
Draco tried to act cool, but felt very important. Making connections really paid off.
He watched the kid join Hagrid, cheerfully licking the ice cream. Draco’d never seen anyone so content with so incredibly little.
The boy looked around at the street outside, then back at Madam Malkin, who smiled at him. The boy beamed back like he was half in love with her already.
‘No,’ said Potter, more loudly. ‘I forgot the hellebore.’
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Draco felt his hair fly back. His nerves left him in the thrill of the flight. This was and always had been his favourite pastime. He started looking around for the Snitch right away, but only found Harry Potter beaming at him, looking excited. Draco felt himself smiling back before he could prevent it.
‘Be specific, Vinciento.’
. . .
His obsessiveness put an idea in Draco’s head. ‘I’ll tell you what,’ he said, perking up, ‘find my pendant and as a reward I let you know what it does.’ With a smug look he pushed past the Head Boy. ‘Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back, Luna says.’
.’ At those last words, Barney fixed his eyes on Draco, glinting with indignation.
‘Or – or like this!’ Draco put on a mock hazy smile and imitated the way Mr. Lovegood and Loony always danced.
‘Shut up.’
Draco straightened his back, scowling. He couldn’t believe Potter’s nerve, still using that nickname after all this time, as if he’d done absolutely nothing wrong.
So far, though, he hadn’t had any luck yet.
Before he could recover, the Weasley appeared in front of them, pointing his wand at Draco. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.
Swaying slightly at the music, they sluggishly revolved at the spot, and for the first time in forever, Draco felt at ease. For a moment, the eternal storm inside him settled.
‘Draco!’ called Draco’s father. ‘Get over here!’
He could never in a million years
Vincent and Gregory nodded. After seeing the things Gregory’s father could do, and seeing the magic Draco’s parents performed, Draco’s interest in the Dark Arts had only grown stronger. His father always told him that the Dark Arts were the most powerful form of magic. Draco reckoned that if you’re bothering to learn magic, then why not at least learn the most powerful form?
As he’d been pounding his own head with his fist, it might be unconvincing to reply he was all fine and dandy. When he kept quiet, the other person shuffled towards him.
Draco clapped his hands. ‘Enough yammering, Nottingham, get back to the party – Oh! But can you walk?’ he simpered with a feeble voice. ‘How inconsiderate, let me call someone to carry you! Shoulder the burden of your fragile frame!’
‘Ah,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Poppy? We require a little Soothing Spirit over here, please.’
A sharp pain shot through Draco’s face, running from his nose straight down his spine, drawing a wince from him.
He slammed the door.
Draco shot him his worst glare. ‘You actually think I’m here for
And with a pop he remembered: he wasn’t wearing his ring.
Draco leaned over the back of the couch in the Slytherin common room to whisper at Pansy.
The wireless was quiet for a while. Then, Draco cleared his throat and seemed to have regained his vigour:
‘Maybe I should,’ Draco snarled. ‘Those paintings have more depth than you garbage Parkinsons could ever achieve.'
‘I can read hands, too,’ said Tracey, seizing poor Adrian’s hand, who quickly yanked it away and made an escape to the Gryffindor table.
‘Spit it out!’ she snapped.
‘He keeps picking fights with Umbridge, it’s hilarious,’ Pansy continued unbothered. ‘I almost wish we had Defence Against The Dark Arts with the Gryffindors just to watch Potter getting himself all worked up every time.’
The compartment was quite full with Pansy, Nott, Zabini and Demelza Prescott, the Head Girl.
‘Oh, I have those too,’ said Harry, as if they were comparing Chocolate Frog Cards. ‘You wake up screaming?’
‘But you are Potter’s,’ Pansy swooned.
Harry had taken out his notebook. ‘Who’s Sandra?’
Harry’s grin turned into laughter. Draco stopped jumping to grab his collar, shouting, ‘Stop laughing, Potter!’ even though he was grinning too. ‘I’m trying to break loose here!’
Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter and Pansy shrieked with glee.
‘Now, for those of you who couldn’t listen at all yesterday, here’s the biggest news you’ve missed. The big frog migration officially kicked off. Be mindful on the road. We don’t want to interrupt a family of froglets as they cross Long Street, near the bend towards the creek.’
Malfoy sat back in his desk chair, turned it away from Harry and put his feet up on the windowsill. Despite idly ruffling with empty papers near the mic, he brought the news from the top of his head, enforcing Harry's theory that he was making it all up on the spot.
He turned and swept from the office. Draco mouthed, ‘Remedial Potions?’ at Potter behind Snape’s back before following him out. He almost had to run to keep up with Snape’s large strides. ‘Is Potter really that bad, sir?’ he asked gleefully. ‘I mean, I didn’t even know you gave Remedial Potions, Professor. With all due respect, sir, but you don’t even give Remedial Potions to Crabbe and Goyle. Does that mean Potter is worse than Crabbe and Goyle, sir?’
Tears of regret burnt behind Harry's eyes. He shook his head. ‘I think I’ve done something horrible.’
‘Oh? Well, I actually had a rock band during all of that horcrux hunting, you know. We were crazy good, too. I played lead guitar and sang. We had a bunch of groupies in every place we set up camp.’
Draco gave the delivery owl a Knut and lazily unfolded his newspaper when he heard a noise coming from across the hall.
His parents didn’t pay Draco another mind as they started solemnly stepping around the entrance hall, performing spells Draco’d never heard before. They were chanting in a language that Draco didn’t recognize. The magic they performed was not taught at Hogwarts or written in any of Draco’s books.
His parents left. Draco waited and listened. The noises outside were certainly not Muggle fireworks. He heard people shouting; it sounded – frightened? He wondered if that was possible.
Draco was patrolling the castle for his prefect duty one evening, when he got spooked by Professor Umbridge popping up from around a corner.
Pansy yanked at his ankles. ‘Come – with – me! Stupid Malfoy! I – am – bored!’
When Draco held the letter out to Ulysses, the owl hopped away from him.
Uncle Barney had flown up through the floor, almost giving Draco a heart attack.
Pansy was yanking at his arm, putting her entire weight into it. ‘Yes, you do.’ When he glared at her, she sing-songy added, ‘Don’t want to miss it when he dies!’
‘Piss off!’ he yelled. ‘NOW!’
At the swimming party, Draco calls Theo a Bonnacon, which is a medieval mythological being, of which Wikipedia explains: “the bonnacon was said to expel large amounts of caustic feces from its anus at its pursuers, burning them and thereby ensuring its escape.”
‘How am I pressuring you?’ her mother exclaimed. ‘I am simply saying –’
‘Sure,’ Draco muttered, ‘push his luck straight out of the ballpark, why don’t you? Gamble with his life, who cares? It’s only The Boy Who Lived.’
‘Oh Malfoy, please, the girl doesn’t talk,’ Pansy said. ‘Now Romilda, that’s your true rival in this game.’
Draco pretended to have a face-twitch while Pansy covered her head, shouting ‘Flashbacks! Flashbacks! Make it stop!’
‘Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?’ he sneered as soon as he was within earshot.
Dumbfounded, Draco stared at him. Resignation? Was it that easy?
Draco scowled. ‘No one in their right mind would make me a prefect,’ he snarled.
‘Oh, stop it, that vulgar dance is an affront to the entire concept of a
‘I deserved zero,’ said Delacour throatily, shaking her head.
Above his artichoke, Harry caught himself smirking.
‘D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?’ asked Gregory.
They gaped at him.
‘Voldemort’s on here,’ Potter said.
Draco tried not to smile. Instead he faked anger, whipping around. ‘I do not have a Selkie nose. Take that back.’
‘Who are you looking for?’
‘Then what is it?’
‘Don’t think so.’
Harry took a big step over the puddle of coffee to follow him in. The jeans Draco was wearing fitted him well. Harry swallowed and focused on something else – anything other than Draco Malfoy's arse.
‘When’s that then?’ Crabbe grunted. Thinking things through annoyed him, Draco knew, he preferred to act fast.
Harry gasped when the meaning of those words finally landed. Draco Malfoy had tickets to see Willo the Wisp! Those were incredibly hard to get. Harry had pulled every card up his sleeve, had dropped every title on his trophy shelf, but nothing had worked. It was simply sold out. Sold out in ten seconds, Ron had said, and Harry could have wept.
‘Tell me about it. But he told me about their music and it is… It is fairly nice, Muggle music.’
Harry blinked. ‘You can’t.’
‘A Howler? That doesn’t sound like a nice gift.’
With a frustrated groan Harry flopped back in his chair. He supposed there was simply nothing to it but to pay News Treat Wireless Station another visit. For information.
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpet bag in one hand and leaned heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
Quickly, Draco checked his surroundings. As soft as he could, he asked, ‘I need to know about Muggle-ways to listen to music.’
‘Let’s have lunch in the common room,’ Zabini proposed after their last lesson of the morning ended, aiming for a casual tone. ‘I’m sure we can get a house-elf to serve us there.’
Pansy quickly stepped in. ‘Muggles were trespassing our property, Mr. Malfoy, but Draco scared them off for us, before they could attack.’
‘We could move to your bed,’ Harry whispered. Where he had found the cheek to even suggest it, he didn't know.
Again, Potter made it blatantly clear he had never experienced parents; Father’s fury was still bright in Draco’s memory.
When Draco saw Potter the next day, the boy looked tormented with guilt as if he had personally pushed Draco into McGonagall’s arms. Draco hated it. He much preferred Potter’s usual cool, fearless look, and wished he would realise it was not his fault, but the fault of that stupid half-giant and that knutless, blood-traitor he kept hanging out with. Draco wished Potter would realise Draco’d been right, back at the start of the year, about chosing his friends more carefully.
‘On’y jus’ hatched,’ said Hagrid proudly, ‘so yeh’ll be able ter raise ‘em yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!’
‘I’m sure you are,’ the Head Girl, Demelza Prescott, said sarcastically.
The shouts of the Quidditch players faded to the background. The afternoon sunlight felt hot on Draco’s black trousers.
Spotting a fresh collection of wounds on Harry, Draco took out his wand. ‘You know, I’m not the one here taking – Episkey – way too long, while that French – Episkey – girl was covered in blood, and she’s – Episkey – you know, three years older. That was
‘Hot pink,’ Potter replied.
Draco’s stomach turned. Furiously, he shook his head. ‘No! No, I…’
While the house-elf went through her embarrassing disciplinary routine, Bellatrix sat back on the couch like an old lady: groaning, a hand on her back and leaning on her cane. ‘That is enough,’ she lazily told Tinsel. Raising her voice to drown out the ‘thank you’s, she told the elf to pour them all a bit of tea. Then, Bellatrix turned towards Draco as if she was about to ask him something when she whipped back once more. ‘AND KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER!’
On one of the first mornings in February, Ulysses dropped a red envelope on the Slytherin breakfast table, landing next to Draco’s orange juice.
Weasley let go of the front of Draco’s robes.
‘Well, I wish you the best of luck in your search, Brandon Davies,’ Draco finished at last. ‘Now, for the most intriguing news of the week’ – Harry perked up – ‘Mr Carl Ronalds, retired reporter for the Brookley Gazette, wrote to us saying he saw a wild cockatoo in the oak tree in his back garden this morning.’ Harry deflated. ‘Would you believe it? I say pics or it didn’t happen, Mr Ronalds.’ There was the sound of paper rustling and Draco taking a sip of water. ‘In the early hours of the afternoon, this station’s favourite auror dropped by our humble broadcasting station for a little chat. No offence, of course, to auror Garret – the best rehabilitation auror of the southwest of England. Garrett, if you’re listening, you will always have a special place in my heart. But you never had a jawline like Harry Potter.’
‘MUM?!’
‘Then for once keep your fat mouth shut,’ said Harry, looking daggers.
‘First of all: how dare you, second: you don’t know how dangerous it is what you’re doing, because honestly, so far you haven’t known anything at all. Third: my name literally means dragon. If anyone gets to see a dragon it should be me. I know far more about them than you.’
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where they stopped, right outside the staffroom door.
Pansy changed tactics. ‘Have you noticed,’ she said, looking malicious, ‘that Potter’s nose looks like an ugly dragon’s?’
Daphne smirked. ‘Explains Potter’s absence too.’
‘Merlin, this is taking forever,’ Draco loudly complained.
‘Then who
From then on, the Weasleys kept close to Harry to keep the Bludger at bay, but by the looks of it, Potter did not enjoy their protection. The boy was an enigma to Draco. Did Potter like getting his bones smashed in, Draco wondered.
It confused him. This man ruined his life. He deserved to feel bad. Right? Then why did Draco suddenly feel so conflicted?
‘Oh,’ Draco said. ‘Interesting…’
After the P for Parkinson, there weren't many people left. A pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil", walked up to the hat one by one.
Their next exam was the practical examination for Charms. As small groups of students were called into the Great Hall in alphabetical order, those left behind in the entrance hall muttered incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake.
Draco smirked. ‘My word, Potter, now that you mention it, I actually wouldn’t even be surprised if they did!’
Groaning like an old man, Draco rolled out of bed and put on slippers and a thick, velvet housecoat. ‘I hate you.’
‘I said
He looked at crouching Goyle, who he’d rarely seen this excited.
‘Ron attacked me, sir –’
‘Draconius, please…’ His mother rubbed her temple.
In the entrance hall, his father was standing with a man in long, magnificent, flowing robes, who could have been Draco’s uncle for how much he looked like Draco’s father. They were equally tall and shared the long, blonde hair, although the man wore it in a neat braid, hanging down to his lower back.
Draco huffed. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and hooked his chin on the tangling, black hair. Then he grabbed the excuse of Potter neither knowing the book nor the song Wuthering Heights to start singing, supposedly to himself, supposedly out of boredom.
Harry blinked and shifted his attention to his mug. ‘It was fine.’
‘Well, Potter can hardly write,’ Draco scoffed.
‘From those Potter Stinks-badges you made,’ said Tracey. ‘We worked practically all night –’
instead of easier to talk to him.
Draco rearranged his robes. ‘What was that all about?’
him.’
That’s what their old dancing teacher kept singing out, whenever they needed to change partners or when she suddenly switched songs or rhythms to keep them all on their toes.
The butterflies in Draco’s belly were a lot harder to push away. Potter looked amazing. His hair was long and shiny and messy and he had
‘Is the dragon gone?’ Draco asked conversationally.
‘Fine,’ Draco drawled, having trouble carrying his loot. ‘If you insist.’
He couldn’t imagine The Boy Who Lived appearing in front of the entire Wizengamot, just for defending himself in front of his own family. That sounded wildly excessive. Would they really expel their favourite wonderboy over something like that? And more importantly: had Harry really been attacked by a dementor? Out in the open?
know if you did – you’re not exactly subtle.’
‘I’m hungry,’ Vincent complained, as the gale outside pounded their carriage.
‘Talk!’ grunted Warrington.
They all looked at him doubtfully.
The bed creaked with Draco clinging onto the headboard for dear life.
Draco closed his sore eyes. He was shaking, or maybe the castle was. He didn’t know what to think, what to feel. All he knew was that he shouldn’t swagger into Snape’s office looking like an open book, as his father had called it, but Draco found it difficult to close this chapter.
to inspect the owl post.’ She gave a silvery giggle that made Draco feel unsettled. ‘I think we can all agree you’re a
‘Mister Malfoy,’ said McGonagall sharply, ‘watch your tongue if you don’t want to lose your house any points.’
Potter obviously didn’t notice. He was cluelessly giggling at one thing or another, and playing some dumb game with the Monkey Weasley, while Granger slaved away on her homework as usual.
Draco shared a look with Crabbe and Goyle, who seemed oblivious, so as soon as they reached the Slytherin Table, Draco pushed Daphne aside to sit sideways next to Pansy.
‘All done,’ the nurse said after the footsteps of the students outside had faded away. ‘You’ll be okay, deary. It’s healing well and it’s certainly not infected.’
He looked anyway; it was impossible not to –
‘What’s wrong, Dra?’
When Draco wasn’t dreaming about Harry J. Potter, he was thinking of his beautiful robes. They were gorgeous and soft and fitted him like a glove. Mother and he had been going to all the finest dressmakers in the country to find the perfect robes, and this was it. They made Draco look like a
Draco told himself he didn’t care. He was not going to get distracted by any Gryffindors anymore. He was tired and did not skip sleeping to watch whatever charade their dim-witted, half-bred gamekeeper had going on. Draco wanted all the O.W.L.’s. He would hear what happened later.
‘It’s not sharing techniques,’ Draco scoffed.
The door flung open with a flourish, making Harry flinch back instinctively, as a silver-blonde man in light jeans and a colourful shirt leaned his forearm in the doorway, crossing his legs at the shins. One of his sleeves was rolled up tightly around his bicep to keep a pack of cigarettes tucked between skin and fabric. He appraised Harry with a lazy sneer, clearly not at all surprised to see him.
They all had a great laugh about it.
Draco kept his misty eyes on him. ‘What do you think of Willo himself?’
Draco started at his favourite part of the book while pacing around the room.
‘What are you talking about?’ said one of the twins.
‘Tracey, shut up,’ Draco snarled. ‘He doesn’t care.’
First things first, however, and he went to the Library to find out what Sirius Black had done. How did someone kill thirteen people in one blow? He must have been incredibly powerful.
The morning of the Gryffindor’s first practice of the year, Draco and his friends and teammates got up early and walked up to the pitch together, all in high spirits. Even Theodore Nott trailed along on his shiny, leather shoes, with his dainty nose in a book.
Draco handed him the dried frogs. ‘Cut these.’
‘I think so,’ said Harry genuinely. ‘You have an interesting family, I think, on the Black-side at least. So many of them were pillars of either the rise or fall of Voldemort.’
‘I do
During their search for the pendant, Potter had given Draco a little insight in his schedule that he could nicely abuse now, so at nine o’clock the next Saturday morning, he followed the Prefects to the Great Hall, where Chang and Potter were waiting to hand out the orders of the week.
‘Kid’s stuff,’ declared Draco as he joined Harry at the back of the dungeon.
At eight o’clock that evening the Slytherin common room emptied out. To avoid the inevitable queue at the entrance hall, Draco, Vincent and Gregory went to the kitchen for a quick snack first. If nothing else, Draco’s apple could serve as a target on someone’s head to practice on.
‘Parkinson!’ he groaned. ‘Knock first.’
Within minutes she’d returned and slammed a bottle on Draco’s table. ‘Sweet dreams!’ she roared and went to bed.
‘Never mind, Ron,’ said Granger quickly, seizing Weasley’s arm to restrain him as he took a step towards Draco.
Frowning, Pansy put the back of her hand on Draco’s forehead and cheek. ‘What’s wrong with you then?’
Draco was walking back to class with Vincent and Gregory after lunch, when he bumped into the people walking in front of him. Everyone had stopped dead in their tracks in the middle of the corridor.
Draco smirked, not knowing what to say to that.
Draco was taken aback by the intensity of the words and the look on Potter’s face. ‘Course you’re not,’ he mumbled, looking away.
‘Right,’ his father drawled coldly. ‘Well, Mildred only teaches children, as you know, and I require my teenage son to learn a little bit more than a few funny little Leg-Lockers at this point in time. Additionally,’ he continued fiercely, ‘we prefer not to associate anymore with
Soon, Harry’s “shabby condo” above Little Rico’s Pizza was filled with floating, sticky bubbles. He’d thrown them away so often in a rage of impatience, frustration or confusion, they were scattered in haphazard patterns with no way to find any specific one back. It would have been disastrous for his research, had Draco ever actually said anything worth recording for Harry’s research. It appeared that the one line Harry had only half caught had been the only time Draco sounded troubled by something.
‘McGonagall loves to make a little late night stroll,’ said Nott, drawing a dotted line along the corridor outside McGonagall’s room. ‘Through here… and to… here.’ He drew a careful last dotted line in front of Professor Sprout’s room.
‘I have an addition to my previous request for help,’ Draco pompously answered. ‘Can I?’
Lupin had an excuse ready, ‘Draco wanted some more experience with defeating a Boggart.’
cry,’ snapped Nott, whose red rimmed eyes contradicted that statement.
Professor Lupin sat down on a table. ‘Are you alright?’ he asked, looking quite sincere.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
‘I know, Professor,’ Draco muttered, his cheeks burning.
Merlin, Pansy, if Snape is worried, there must
Draco shuddered.
Malfoy seemed to be having the time of his life, looking down on kneeling Harry, and raised a brow. ‘Oh, but the perfect-part is true?’
… Because, you know, it might… well… put me in an awkward position.’
Mr Potter likes to go for his morning jog, we, at News Treat Live From New Street, might be tempted to follow his lead... Or we could at least decide to take the scenic route to Christie’s Coffee on the Corner – the best café latte for the sweetest price! Regardless, for future updates on our local Auror Department, please provide a clear description of what the auror in question was wearing, as detailed as possible, so our listeners can make a well-informed decision on their morning routine. And again, if any of you have information on the suspicious activity going on here in Brookley, please send it to us. We will be happy to pass it on to the local Auror Department. Who knows? If we all band together to help, Harry Potter might have a chance of becoming The Hero of Next Thursday.’
Harry pursed his lips. He ran the people he’d met through his mind and wondered which one of those perfectly respectable-looking people was selling drugs to Draco Malfoy.
‘Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring, That’s why Slytherins all sing: Weasley is our King! Weasley was born in a bin, he always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley will make sure we win, Weasley is our King!’
wanted him to meet my son.’
‘That's sweet. Want to let me win again?’
Harry took a moment to breathe deeply in and slowly out.
Draco rocked his knee, debating if he had to warn someone. Who would he warn? His father? The Ministry? He wished Snape was here, so he could discuss it with an ally.
Draco sauntered over to them, and stuck out his hand. ‘Care to dance, miss?’
The first night was a long one. He didn’t dare lie on his arm, afraid he would make it worse if he moved in his sleep, so he slept terribly lightly and kept waking up at every move he made. When he did sleep, his dreams were filled with steely talons, cold hippogriff eyes and blood splattering on grass.
‘Diggory’s a dweeb,’ sneered Draco. ‘I’d be offended – ’
‘And people are interested in that?’
‘Obviously not,’ he said, sharing a look with Draco, who was sniggering. ‘Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?’
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight, leaving the class alone for minutes on end.
‘Friends?’ Draco scoffed, crinkling his nose. ‘You do know he’s a Mudblood, right?’
‘There!’ Draco pointed. Everyone around him was now searching the air with their binoculars on Draco's instructions.
When the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next morning it was to enormous applause. Both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were clapping for them too.
The older students shook their heads. ‘Not likely,’ said one of them.
Draco proudly poured them all some orange juice. ‘Oi, where’s the Italian?’ he called through the room.
‘What now?’ Draco snapped. ‘He almost had it!’
She’d slammed the curtain around his bed away and dropped a book on his project. Draco tried to save what he could.
‘I’m listening.’
Potter and Weasley weren’t on the Hogwarts Express. Granger was sitting with Gryffindor girls like her stupid friends never even existed.
‘Breathe slowly, dear. You’re safe,’ said Pomfrey, like a liar. ‘Think about something else.’
A few Slytherins sniggered and hummed in agreement.
‘I can do this,’ Draco muttered when the boy tried to help.
She looked up at him with a wistful smile. ‘You have grown so quickly… Back then your father could hold you in one hand. I used to swaddle you into his old Slytherin scarf.’ She smiled again, watching Draco’s hands with faraway eyes. ‘So he'd be with you.’
‘We want you to at least be prepared for the possibility,’ said his mother.
‘What’s that?’ asked nosy Pansy, who had been trying to get Nimbostratus back in his cage.
When he got home, he jumped on his bed to flip through the book, and found it wasn’t half bad. There were several love potions in there, ranging in strength and what nasty stuff it would make the victim want to do, but there was also a chapter about creative ways to make a gift out of a memory. For instance: turning it into a Patronus-like projection, or keeping it in a locket around one’s neck. There was a chapter about tattoos that almost made Draco jump up to force his parents to give him permission.
‘I have a big heart.’ Pansy smiled.
The champion for Durmstrang would be Viktor Krum – ‘
Malfoy smacked the cup on the counter. ‘You can get your own tea.’
Vincent frowned.
‘You know I do, old sap,’ he said. ‘I mean, I can’t exactly ask mummy and daddy why I got a kick out of being smacked around by Potter, can I? It’s the latest step in my descent into lunacy, apparently.’
‘Okay, so if you’re not trying to get Hagrid sacked, why are you still here?’ asked Harry, his mouth full of cookie. ‘Isn’t it time to go back to school? Or didn’t you get enough attention yet?’
With a piercing look, Harry held the mic away from them to mutter, ‘You’re my interview host.’
. A guy. A man. A son of Adam. I should never have even
At least Harry hadn’t heard. He was telling his friends something, while smiling softly.
There had been a career talk with Professor McGonagall – he had told her the first thing that had popped into his head – it had lead to a fight between her and Umbridge.
Remembering their attic filled with magical heirlooms, Draco ran up the stairs, through the corridor, up another set of stairs and through yet another corridor. There he could climb the spiral staircase through the East Tower that lead to the attic of the manor.
‘Just because you were raised with magic, doesn’t mean you’re better than everyone else.’
Draco was taking deep, calming breaths. ‘I will,’ he managed, ‘sir.’
Draco sat down on the floor, careful not to touch anything else, while Uncle Barney cleared his throat importantly and started pacing the air in the room.
Most nights, Draco couldn’t sleep. He felt hurt and resentful and he hated it. He hated feeling like this. He hated how Harry’d forgotten him and how he didn’t bother at all to fix things. And Draco didn’t even
The letter made Draco’s stomach ache. There was no way Potter would survive another “meeting” with Father’s “old friend”. And there was no way Potter would still want to be friends with Draco now that he’d seen his father as the Dark Lord’s second in command. Potter would never understand. He simply didn’t know the Wizarding World well enough.
‘He literally stared me straight in the eye and said “No flying in front of Malfoy!” It was scary, like he read my mind.’
Draco heaved a weary sigh. ‘You’re the boss, applesauce.’
Draco started opening doors and counting the people inside, but every dorm room had at least two occupants already.
‘Found him!’ Pansy bellowed over the grounds. ‘You go ahead! We’ll come in a minute!’ Someone shouted something that Draco couldn’t make out. ‘No, he’s just crying!’ Pansy screamed, and even louder: ‘I said he’s CRYING! Ooh of course, we’ll be fine!’
know someone who writes their O’s with a little curl on the right? Please let Mrs Pendergast know. We are all dying to find out who her secret admirer is!’
. . .
He tried to swagger off, but Warrington seized his robes. ‘Tell me what you know.’
Harry burst out laughing. He quickly stifled it, but it was too late: Hagrid showed up and forced them to re-join the class.
She sat down on one of the antique, French sofas, patting the spot next to her, while Draco’s mother bossed around the house-elves and busied herself at a dressing table in a corner of the room.
‘Excuse me, can I see a selection of fabrics before you force the cheapest stuff on me?’
The two teams walked onto the field to loud cheers. Draco pointed his binoculars at Harry, who managed to look tall despite being the youngest and clearly nervous. Harry Potter always kept his composure.
‘Never you mind,’ she said.
It did not slip his attention how Vincent and Gregory exchanged a look. They did not seem keen to share their afternoon with Potter.
Draco climbed out of the bath to get a few snacks. Earlier that evening, he’d ordered Crabbe and Goyle to go to the kitchen and they had not let him down.
Potter was picturing him that night up on the tower, sad and alone and…
!’ He pointed at the left side of the common room – ‘
Draco smirked. ‘I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be brave?’ He glanced provocatively at Longbottom, who’d heard him fine, but acted like he didn’t.
‘The manor demands more than a single house-elf to run it, Lucius. If you think
When the silver nail varnish had dried, Pansy carefully applied the sparkly green crackle nail varnish Draco loved so much. It took an experienced hand to apply it, so Draco didn’t allow anyone but Pansy to touch him with it. Daphne and Tracey turned around in their chairs to watch her work with unconcealed awe.
For a second, Harry looked miserable. Then he dragged Draco’s legs around his waist, took Draco’s hand away from his face and gently kissed his nose, spiralling from the tip of it to the edges.
Draco agreed.
‘MacMillan. Yes.’
Draco wanted to laugh; his father could be even more petty than he was sometimes.
‘I don’t fucking know, Potter!’
Before Draco could retort, Crabbe and Goyle lumbered back from their mission.
They made their way through the dark corridors of the manor, where torches and chandeliers lit up and extinguished to light their path.
Draco nudged Crabbe and Goyle to leave, and they went back to their compartment.
Following Navigator Nott, they reached their destination without any further trouble, and as soon as the door closed behind them, they started cheering and screaming.
“Hey Draco” he walked towards him with a feeling of dread in his stomach.
“Since they officially came out as couple.”
He actually apologised to Hermione when they walked to the great hall for food, “Hermione” he put a hand on her shoulder to stall her, “I need to apologise for all the times I called you a” he swallowed the word tasting horrible in his mouth, “a mud…..mudblood”.
He all of a sudden had the urge to kiss the other boy. Malfoy was stood in front of him, not the boy from first year with the slicked back hair, but the man who had survived the battle of Hogwarts, and Harry wanted to kiss that man, he was falling for that man.
When it was time for the lesson to end, neither of them wanted to let go of the other, but they were never go admit this, so they reluctantly let go. They walked out of the classroom together and came face to face with Hermione and Ron.
“Bed…..?” he was very confused, why was Ron smiling at him like that?
year when he was scarily good at it.
Harry chuckled, “why don’t we buy some sweets and find somewhere to sit? We can then meet up with the others later and walk back to school?”
“You really think I’d ask you without getting their blessing?”
Harry face fell a bit, “I went searching for you on the train, wanted to offer the olive branch, clean slate and all that. I found you asleep, you looked scared but I didn’t want to startle you, I left them in front of you for when you woke up.”
“Morning!!” Harry was apparently in a very cheery mood.
“That’s what you got from that?”
His peaceful night meant he had overslept which meant he had to check his timetable, his first lesson was transfiguration,
He didn’t notice the piece of paper in Harry’s hands.)
While they walked to the party later that day, after sitting through lessons not really paying attention and smiling at anyone who congratulated them for finally getting together, but everytime someone said he would flinch, where they actually a couple? Yes they had kissed but they hadn’t had a chance to talk about it! Was the party a good idea? Should he drink?
Draco took a step sideways to let Potter past and then proceeded to follow him.
“Sounds like a successful party.”
First year it had been “look its Harry Potter!”
That night harry was sat in the common room smiling about what had happened throughout the day, who knew spending a day hugging and being coupley with Malfoy would be so much fun!! He was aware of all the stares that they were getting but he didn’t mind, he’d spent his life being stared at hearing the whispers;
Harry groaned and held him tighter, Draco knew Harry was a quidditch player but he was only now realising how strong he was.  He then felt Harry kissing the back of his neck then higher up, then on his jawline then his temple. Draco turned his head enough to catch Harry’s lips and then flipped his body around so he was on his front and then started moving forward making harry lie back on his bed.  Next this he knew he was straddling Harrys lap and kissing him with every ounce he had and it didn’t go any further as they were both splashed with cold water.
He’d almost reached out and taken the other boys hand he just hoped Malfoy hadn’t noticed.
“Totally not full of yourself are you Potter?”
“I don’t want to split the love birds and you don’t seem to have anyone to sit with, no offence.”
Draco must have gone into auto pilot because before he knew it he was almost back at his common room.
Ron blushed and Draco walked away, gave Harry a quick kiss and left the room simply saying “dibs on the shower next.”
“You planned this all along didn’t you?” Harry raised his eyebrow at her.
Harry smiled at him, “Charms.”
“So you hungry?”
“Cauldron cake?” Draco blinked a few times, coming back to the real world.
“Nothing.”
“Potter wait!”
“Since they officially came out as couple.”
“Oh really?” Harry raised his eyebrow.
“Have we ever been normal though” she sent him a cheeky smile.
What they  couldn’t see however where the tingles that were shooting up Harry’s arm to and making his heart beat faster, he was also struggling to breathe, all of this caused by Draco holding his hand, this had never happened with Ginny.
Harry shook his head it was too perfect a moment to spoil it.
“Draco’s father would definitely hear about it.”
They’d stood in the corridor for ages, him holding Potter, feeling the other boy breathing against him. Potter had eventually pulled away and looked at him, not talking just looked at him. Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone but he had hoped the other boy would have kissed him, he almost had himself. He’d felt complete when he was holding Potter and when Potter had pulled back his front had felt cold, like the warmth had gone.
Harry felt everything melt away and he just stood there, till Malfoy broke the silence “what’s wrong?”
“No no, you said something.”
“So you hungry?”
“Sounds good to me.”
He smiled at her, “hey, you okay?”
“It’s what school does to you mate” this had Weasley receive evils from Granger that dissipated when he kissed her cheek.
Harry just sighed, “really really.”
“So are you going to stand there staring or should I walk you home?”
“I don’t know mate but I can’t wait to find out.” This caused him to receive a stern look from Hermione who dragged him towards the Gryffindor table.
“Where are you going?!?” Draco was hoping to ask this is in a calm voice but had failed and shouted it at Potter.
Harry stood up, almost threw the bacon butty at Draco and walked towards the door.
“I’ll take that as a yes.” He then got off his stool and wrote their names down on the list at the front. They spent the rest of the lesson making a Draught of peace. Potter knew that Malfoy was one of the better potions students and just did as Malfoy instructed him.

Draco couldn’t think of a retort but Harry must have but he drowned out the friendly bickering, he was taken aback by Ron’s comment, he had said he loved them, both of them, all his past friendships had been built on fear and wanting followers not family, but now he had a family and it made him feel safe and he knew it he got off the bed and gave Ron a hug.
Draco had wanted him to leave,
“In my…”
She nudged him gently with her elbow, “hey” she whispered, making Harry come back into the real world.
But it did explain why he was in the Gryffindor common room.
He was broken out of his thoughts by Ginny, “you two fancy coming to the room of requirements later? I’m throwing a ‘thank merlin those two idiots are finally together’ party. Don’t tell Ron but I stole his secret supply of fire whisky.”
But heres another chapter
Ron burst out laughing while Draco blushed.
“right” Draco cleared his throat, not for any reason other than to give himself time to think, “ he has an okay voice, bit pitchy  in places.”
For a short moment he stood still staring at Ginny not sure what to do, everyone was looking at him, this wasn't how this argument was to go. Then he made his choice, it was now or never. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and started to walk towards Draco.
But it did explain why he was in the Gryffindor common room.
“Want to stay here hugging?”
So when he heard Harry calling his name, even though it sounded distant and as if it was coming through water, Draco just sent him what he thought was a flirtatious smile.
Something flashed across Harrys face but instead of replying he turned to his friends.
Draco had wanted him to leave,
Harry winked at him, “I’ll just share Draco’s.”
He stepped defeated into the common room.
“That is the end game yes”.
“Would you like to sit with us?”
“Great.”
Draco looked at Harry, who looked at him back, answering for the both of them replied “sure why not I could do with a drink”.
“I went for a walk.”
Malfoy just smiled at him, “Me of course.”
“Are you having an ‘affair’ with Malfoy?” she put air quotes around the word affair as they were no longer together.
Draco had lost the feeling in his face around the 5
Oh for Merlin’s sake! Malfoy had noticed? He was going to kill them!
He was a bag of nerved from what had happened last night, both the moment he had with Harry, and the realisation that he wanted more moments like that with Harry. He started to bite his finger nails, another thing he never did, he had been nervous before, but never this kind of nervous.
Draco was surprised, it was like Potter had read his thoughts, “Are you sure? And is that even allowed?”
Harry’s seeker instincts must have kicked in because Malfoy had never seen someone turn around so fast.
He just smiled at her, gave her a peck on the forehead, nodded to Ron who was sprawled on the couch in front on the fire and went up to his room.
“I got lost” this came out more as a question than a statement, he knew Hermione knew when he was lying.
Dracos response was a loud laugh that erupted from his stomach, surprising him and his two friends. “Sorry Harry.” He took a deep breath then turned to Ginny “I promise to look after him and try to keep him out of trouble” then adding “I hope we can be friends, I’ll need a helper.” For good measure.
“Sounds like a successful party.”
“No you won’t and if you do I’ll just ask you instead.” Harry skipped up a step and kissed Malfoy quickly then took the step down again, put his hands behind his back and stood waiting.
Draco stepped out of the shower still recovering from what had happened, if Ron hadn’t walked in he wasn’t sure how far they would have gone, the shower had helped calm him.
Draco took this as a chance to get back into bed and o to sleep, Harry really was sweet.
Ginny’s response was a raised eyebrow and to put her book on the side table.
“No idea” Harry turned towards him and kissed him gently.
When it turned out Malfoys idea to make them stare more was just to grab Harrys hand under the table, he was a bit disappointed. It did as intended though, Hermione and Ron where sat at just the right angle so they could see Harry and Draco hands, and they were sat with their mouths hanging open.
He took a sip of water, it had never tasted so good, and opened the note:
Ron chuckled, “It has hasn’t it.”
“You had breakfast yet?”
Draco woke up in the morning after one of the best sleeps he had had in a long time, no nightmares and no dreams at all, maybe today was the start of a whole new chapter.
“I got lost” this came out more as a question than a statement, he knew Hermione knew when he was lying.
He was a bag of nerved from what had happened last night, both the moment he had with Harry, and the realisation that he wanted more moments like that with Harry. He started to bite his finger nails, another thing he never did, he had been nervous before, but never this kind of nervous.
“Would you want to sit near that?” Potter pointed towards Weasley and Granger who had their heads close together and were whispering and giggling to each other.
“Do you think they have any idea?” Ron whispered to Hermione, he had his arm slung over her shoulder making it easy to talk quietly enough for just her to hear.
Something flashed over Potter’s face but Draco couldn’t tell what it.
“Isn’t it dinner time now? Want to go to the great hall?”
“That’s my…”
Draco shook the water out of his hair and clambered off Harry, “we have one we just happen to share it with you.” He sent Ron his most innocent smile.
“Yeah, thank you” he took one from the bag, “they’re my favourite”.
Fifth year had been the worst, most people believing him to be a liar, at least he had been proven to be right about that one.
“Mate, let me put a shirt on first.”
Where was he going?
Once they’d left the great hall, the couple went off on their own, possible to the Gryffindor common room but who knows.
“What?”
“No was waiting for you.”
He all of a sudden had the urge to kiss the other boy. Malfoy was stood in front of him, not the boy from first year with the slicked back hair, but the man who had survived the battle of Hogwarts, and Harry wanted to kiss that man, he was falling for that man.
“Sign of a good night then.”
“Does he think where..”

Walk back to the common room
“I don’t know. I was supposed to go to the common room to be by myself for a bit. Then I found myself in the dungeons, then I saw you and I realised I didn’t want to be myself. That’s why I asked to you to follow me. Then I just kept walking and walking.” He gave Draco a slight smile, but his eyes had started to well up. “I’m sorry for causing you trouble I just can’t be alone.”
Harry blushed, looking at he well and truly shocked “well yes but still, this isn’t a conversation ex’s usually have”.
“Want to stay here hugging?”
He must have gone too far into his thoughts.
He rested his head on the table and took a couple of deep breaths, when he looked up he noticed a box of cauldron cakes on the table in front of him and next to it a note, “
He was pacing in front of the entrance to the grand hall. He wasn’t quite sure why though. There were two possible reasons for why he was doing this, one of them was that he was waiting for Potter and his entourage to arrive so they could all go in together, or he was building up courage to go in and sit with them.
“Ron should I remind you, your with Hermione and I’m with Harry?”
“And you has that title?”
“I’ve never been more proud” Ginny said giving her a high five.
“We’re officially students, why am I already stressed?”
They walked the rest of the way in silence. When they finally reached Draco’s house, Draco was able to speak again.
“You should follow me?”
“Want to talk about it?”
He sat up straighter, and looked around him. The head movement made his stomach churn. Closing his eyes and holding the bridge of his nose did help, then he took a deep breath and thought back to what happened.
Harry always knew when he was in trouble. Just not always why he was in trouble. He knew he was in trouble whenever he heard Draco shout “POTTER!” On this occasion it was when he was just about to walk into the great hall.
“What are we? Us two. Are we a couple? Ginny and the whole school seem to think but we haven’t had a chance to talk about it! Do you want to be a couple? I know you kissed me but you might have just been swept up in the moment! I really like you, like really really like you to the point that I drink a full bottle and a half, I had some before the whole argument in the entrance, to get the courage to tell you I really really like…”
Though it was nice to see them hugging he was suddenly swept with the feeling to join, and be a loveable rogue, nuisance. He wrapped his arms around them and grinned Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
“Hi Potter.”
“You’ve been walking for hours!!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Let the show begin….
When he was walking towards the classroom he heard talking coming towards him and saw that it was Potter and his friends, hoping they hadn’t spotted him he quickly entered the classroom. Once in the classroom Draco found the desk that was right at the back of the classroom as far away from everyone as he could be.
Draco blushed, it was still new to him, being openly coupley with pda, especially with that being with Harry.
Fifth year had been the worst, most people believing him to be a liar, at least he had been proven to be right about that one.
“It’s true, he is incredibly scary when he first wakes up the hair everywhere and the glasses missing, he looks like a mermaid from the black lake.” Ron said with an evil grin.
Harry groaned and held him tighter, Draco knew Harry was a quidditch player but he was only now realising how strong he was.  He then felt Harry kissing the back of his neck then higher up, then on his jawline then his temple. Draco turned his head enough to catch Harry’s lips and then flipped his body around so he was on his front and then started moving forward making harry lie back on his bed.  Next this he knew he was straddling Harrys lap and kissing him with every ounce he had and it didn’t go any further as they were both splashed with cold water.
Once they’d left the great hall, the couple went off on their own, possible to the Gryffindor common room but who knows.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug, kissing him on the forehead, Draco had a feeling he was trying to kiss the nightmares away.
While they were packing there things away Potter asked Draco what subjects he was taking and when it turned out they were doing the same subjects he asked Malfoy a question that set everything else that year into action;
“I love you too Potter!”
As he went to walk towards the entrance to it he heard footsteps, slow ones that didn’t seem to have any purpose and were just going. Following the noise Draco found himself in walking towards the potions classroom.
Hogsmead weekends use to be just like anyother weekend for Draco. He would go round with Crabbe and Goyle scowling at the younger students and turning his nose up at the people who lived there, but this weekend it was different. If someone had told Draco that he would one day be going to Hogsmead on the arm of the boy who lived while discussing potions with Hermione he would have laughed, said something degrading about muggleborns, while also wishing he was on the arm of Potter, but here he was and he had never been happier. The weather was becoming colder, autumn was definitely making its presence known, so they were all wrapped in scalves and thick coats and Draco was using it as an excuse to snuggle into Harry as much as he could.
“How long have you had to put up with this for?”
“Thanks, Ron I really do need it.” Draco took the glass, downed it and as Ron was telling him to take it easy he grabbed the bottle.
“Just follow me”, Draco could have sworn that Harry made a move to grab his hand, he had almost the same, that’s weird.
They’d stood in the corridor for ages, him holding Potter, feeling the other boy breathing against him. Potter had eventually pulled away and looked at him, not talking just looked at him. Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone but he had hoped the other boy would have kissed him, he almost had himself. He’d felt complete when he was holding Potter and when Potter had pulled back his front had felt cold, like the warmth had gone.
“Urgh” Harry put his hands on his face, “I’m well and truly fucked.”
“Why thank you” Ginny gave a nod of the head as a bow.
Draco let him go, looked him up and down, “I can see what Hermione sees in you”
“Well I’m partnered with you, so less looking forward to it and more dreading it” he sent Harry his signature smirk.
Draco was still sleeping so he put it on the night stand and left a note with it.
He started to move his hand towards Malfoy’s face but one word made him drop his hand and walk away….Ginny.
“I went for a walk.”
“What are we going to do?” Draco turned his head towards Harry, refusing to let go of his arm.
He had almost kissed Malfoy. He still wanted to kiss Malfoy, if he turned around would he still be there?
“Malfoy? You okay?”
Leaning forward he pressed a kiss on Draco cheek causing him to stop and turn to him.
“Yeah he does”
“Yes?”
What was surprising was that Draco himself didn’t question this, who knew the day would come where he felt more at home in the Gryffindor common room in the arms of Harry Potter.
Draco let out an irritated noise and lifted his head up off the desk.
When the door had shoot Draco just smiled towards “Yeah I did, and I wish you had” he took a bite out of his breakfast and gave a small sigh “it’s not like I haven’t liked you since we met”.
“Yeah perfectly fine”, he sent them a very fake smile “so potions is it?”
Harry woke up the next morning with a sore neck, in the arm chair he had sat down in the night before and a blanket on him. He recognised it as Hermione’s, she always looked after him.
Harry was stood in the middle of the room looking as gobsmacked as Draco, he held a letter out towards him;
“Let’s sit on the floor.”
“May or may not have used a certain map that’s shows me were people are” Potter gave him a shy smile as an apology.
He was still thinking all this when they entered the room. A huge banner hung from the ceiling that would change from ‘DRARRY’ then to ‘FINALLY’. He really needed to talk to Harry.
The entire walk from the dungeon Harry had wanted to turn around and check that Malfoy was still following him, but the distinct sound Malfoys shoes made where enough to make him keep on looking forward. If only he could think of a destination for where he was going.
“Where stood here with two very empty beds and where talking about Rons singing voice.”
During the lesson Harry couldn’t help but notice how close he and Draco were sat. The tables were large enough to have a cauldron on yet they were sat very close to each other, they were on different sides but they were close to the corner. His mind kept reminding him off this all the way through the lesson making the blood rise in his cheeks, this blush was deepened when Draco leaned into him and whispered:
His head was spinning as he walked back to the common room.
rush down to breakfast then walk to his class, thankfully it was on the ground floor.
Slughorn was thrilled to see his favourite chosen one back in his classroom so they were forced to sit at the table nearest the front. The lesson consisted of a quick cover of what the year was going to involve and also choosing your partner for the rest of the year.
“Yes, but I’m hungry and need food!” Draco grabbed his bag and started walking to the door.
He must have been lost in his thoughts as he didn’t notice Ginny sit next to him. Even though they’d split they still classed each other as one of their close friends.
“Shush I’m baring my soul. After the Battle of Hogwarts I thought no one would want to know or sit with or have anything to do with me and then you of all people sat next to me. Since then the feelings I had, before everything fell to shit re-surfaced and then you admitted you felt the same! I have never been happier than these past months and I want it to last for the rest of my life. Will you Harry James Potter do me the honour of marryi….”
“Wooh!!!”
All of a sudden Harry was in front of him, his face like he was under the imperious curse. All of a sudden Harry was kissing him and the world fell away.
Hogsmead weekends use to be just like anyother weekend for Draco. He would go round with Crabbe and Goyle scowling at the younger students and turning his nose up at the people who lived there, but this weekend it was different. If someone had told Draco that he would one day be going to Hogsmead on the arm of the boy who lived while discussing potions with Hermione he would have laughed, said something degrading about muggleborns, while also wishing he was on the arm of Potter, but here he was and he had never been happier. The weather was becoming colder, autumn was definitely making its presence known, so they were all wrapped in scalves and thick coats and Draco was using it as an excuse to snuggle into Harry as much as he could.
“Why?”
"HOW DARE I WHAT?!"
He placed a kiss on Harry’s cheek.
“With my hands Potter how else would I carry it, my feet?” and to prove his point he placed it on the floor and proceeded to lift it, almost falling backwards off the bench.
“I was going to take you to Madam Malkins for this”
Harry stared at him with confusion, what on earth could Malfoy mean? A variety of scenarios then whizzed through Harry’s mind, the one that he liked most was the one of Malfoy grabbing him and kissing him. Blushing at this thought he just nodded at Malfoy.
“That’s you...”
“Just imagine what it’d be like if those two got together.”
The four of them walked to potions together but in pairs, Harry and Draco walking a little ahead of Ron and Hermione.
“In your...”
"MAYBE YOU CAN'T FIND ME BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH DRACO!"
The ‘love birds’ as they were going to be referred to in the future came over hands clasped together and sending heart eyes to each other.
“So is everyone looking forward to potions?”
Hermione sighed, “I just wish Harry and Ginny would make it public about their split.”
Ron’s face fell, the split had been hard on both Harry and Ginny. The split had happened a couple of months after the battle of Hogwarts. The end of the war had been hard on Harry, everyone could see it. He wouldn’t eat, hardly slept and became very quiet and spent most of the time on his own. Ginny had tried to be supportive but he just pushed her away, they eventually agreed to end it but keep the split secret, Harry was still all over the magazines and they both thought it best to keep this away from the gossip columns.
