“Don—loo—li—tha—t.” Harry tried and choked on each word, bring Sirius back to the present. Harry was squinting hard enough to make an almost angry expression just to see him. Remus was the first with presence of mind to lower his now unneeded wand and rush forward to bring Harry into his arms.
The muggle audibly gulped as he shifted the next finger in and began to scissor the entrance open, watching it snap back into place when he pulled out to add a third.
“That’s not what I would say about them at all.” The muggle nudged Draco with his shoulder. “I’ll listen for now so you don’t worry—”
“About what?” Remus was holding Draco up and he could tell, he hauled the young man into his arms and brought him into the sitting room.
“I never saw the construction of the school, love. Despite being there when everything was happening to now, I can’t say how many rooms truly exist or how deep it even goes into the earth. Hogwarts has always been a mystery.”
“I’m afraid I must impart some new knowledge of my own as well.” Albus’ eyes drooped in apology. “You see, the threat may be worsened by a new bill passed this week. It’s been in the works for some time because of Harry actually.” That caught everyone’s attention.
“Mr. Potter.” A voice called from the closest accountant’s table. He looked up to see a man growing steadily impatient. He was stout with a hooked nose and pointed ears adorned with gold cuffs that caught the eye. The Bank’s open hall plan allowed Harry to look out at the others writing furiously at their work places and noted the uniformly well kempt attire. These were Goblins, despite their sharp teeth and sharper countenance it was reassuring to see they were just like anyone else Harry would ever talk to.
The bandaged and worn looking house elf looked up with crystal blue globes for eyes. He spoke poorly even for his race and the new cuts and red marks marring his hands and arms was disheartening. He’d never had the will to ask just how he got them and he still couldn’t. Dobby for his part had always said it was his fault.
It was incredibly frustrating to get taken home only to be told they didn’t get to go with Tom who was bringing the bottle to Albus. He wasn’t given the chance to pout about it with his own fatigue, the endless interrogation of where he’d been and what happened and Draco clinging bodily to him as he chastised everything said by anyone and everyone present. Draco for his part, after having time to calm down from his own problems and what looked like the aftermath of a breakdown on his face, the most obvious being the blood red of his eyes from crying, was totally unrepentant now. Acting like it was only harry in trouble, his usual defenses in place saying more than words at this point about just how hurt he was since he couldn’t let himself out of his shell even though he was alone with them.
They were at Diagon Alley in the blink of an eye and walking down the gray streets, pops of magical glow and fresh or faded paint brightened the glum lighting of the day. It was going to start raining soon. Clicking of heels and boots alike surrounded them. Some turned to stare at the group, whispers just a bit too far for them to hear. An undercurrent of tension was there, but no one dared to open the lid to what was underneath yet. Draco and Sirius positioned themselves on either side of Harry in defense and the boy obliviously soaked in the close contact of two of his favorite people.
“This is Nagini, she loves the children we take care of. I am obligated on her behalf to ask if she may look after you and if you would be interested in holding her. I should say being climbed though really.” He tried to joke but he sounded a bit awkward for all the composure he’d shown till now.
It looked like someone’s workshop inside instead of a shop. The tools and open kiln laying out on a large table in the center where the owner clearly spent all their time. Snacks and empty boxes stuffed into the small trashcan under the workstation confirmed that thought.
“I see all that resides in your mind and heart. Being the sorting hat is just a parlor trick really. It is my job to help bring children to the craft they should devote themselves to, to give them an edge in what can give them a good life. Sorting gives them a clan, and a set of traits to hone into a weapon to use. You have many you could focus on; it makes me reluctant to label what best suits you. What you would be happiest with…"
Draco is finally here, and we get some development from everyone. I'm so happy I got to write a fight scene that actually makes at least a little sense. I was worried it wouldn't be good, but I had fun making it. We've hit 20,000 words now and I'm really proud, I really want this to be novel length. Thank you again for reading, every time you do it gives this work a purpose. *Hugs*
Hermione went back to reading with a small serene smile on her lips. That had been the first time a bully had ever been nice to her and it had been real, she could tell. That was enough for now. It gave her a very good feeling about this year.
“Only one thing we can do. Beat the fucking daylights out of him.” Cheers sounded at the order given by their leader. “make him regret the day he was born mates, no one looks at my best mate like that. Insulting my friend was your worst mistake Punss.”
“Not anywhere you’d see, just pushing. Let’s not talk about him.” Harry fidgeted and blushed as he thought of one of the things that had got him through the week. “What did you do before you came to talk to me before?”
His eyes were still a dangerous shade of yellow where there should be white, the same for his nails. A deep pain came with each contraction of his lungs as they refused to work. A stabbing pain in his kidney, appendix, liver, and every other organ permeated and could only be described as organ failure. His heart wanted to stop and for clutch seconds before the Brink elixir it had, now though it felt like it wanted to bust apart. His abdominal muscles spasmed and he was visibly shaking.
“What is your bloody fucking problem mate?!” He yelled out finally, Snape had blessedly ignored the outburst as he continued to keep an eye on the surrounding area.
“And what’s your name?” He asked ruffling the sweet old dogs’ ears and scratching behind his ears. He earned a lolling tongue of approval as he squashed the fluffy face.
It wasn’t more than a few feet till they reached the entry hall and Harry turned to open his cupboard. It didn’t seem to faze Rodolfus as he inspected the space before squeezing in next to Harry on the mattress.
It was all confusion, nothing made sense and the helplessness only grew as the sounds seemed to coalesce. Then they turned to static and he wanted to be relieved. He really wanted to be.
“What—” Harry choked on a new wave of immediate tears and lunged forward to hold onto Ron again. He sobbed louder than he had during his panic attack. He felt Ron flail and grab on to him, a sound of confusion mixed with a groan for air at the tight hold.
“What are they saying at the ministry?” Remus seemed to be taking charge of this discussion, the dark silhouette of Black hovering a bit behind him with a grave look plastered to his face.
Harry sobbed when the figure moved again, so used to no escape he gave up and let them close the distance. He let out a guttural cry he’d been hiding in his throat, trying not to alert anyone, the moment two arms came around him in a barely there hug.
“We think…We think that logically it can’t be in her vault since no one else has the rights to access it to put it there. That the person trusted with it wouldn’t rightly keep them on their person. So that means there has to be a proper hiding place that hopefully isn’t moving. I’ve been ransacking every place I can think of and so far, none of her affiliates have turned anything up. It had to be someone she trusted, but I can’t think of anyone like that when I try.” Tom shook his head hopelessly. “I can’t even hold onto the hope that one day I’ll get to follow after him because of her.”
“I have to say I’m relieved,” Arthur remarked as he patted Tom’s shoulder. “It’s a good job we have people like you, old man.” He teased.
Harry felt his feet weigh themselves down in place as his throat closed in panic. Did Draco know already? Was this how he found out Draco didn’t like him back? It wasn’t fair, he never got to even say anything. It was like Piers all over again.
The older man was slipping out of bed, fully dressed in a nightgown that draped down him like every dip of the fabric and ripple as he moved was controlled. Gray faded, almost cloud white hair draped over his back untied, his chest length beard ungroomed and looking more like a cotton puff.
“No game Snape. I meant what I said. I know it’s not exactly what one might call ideal, mostly my father. Who cares about that?” Truly he did, he knew how hard his father hit when he wanted to get a point across. “I’m asking because I mean it. I’m not asking for you to say yes to anything, just let me court you?” He finished hopefully and a bit more quietly still, weary of curious listeners.
Harry didn’t know what to think. Still, what else was he supposed to do as he stared into the very serious gaze of the man that was supposed to give him a new life. He sighed inwardly and taking his hand made a show of taking a deep gulp of air. The last thing he understood was the gentle chuckle from Roody before the world seemed to end. He felt like he was thrown into a punch, familiar enough that he didn’t stumble too much upon reentry.
Harry blinked, Hermione's worried face swimming blurrily in front of him. Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, so her features came into focus.
“Fat chance we’ll ever find out,” Draco said cynically, tapping his glass. “Hogwarts houses are notoriously bad at working together.”
The intruders’ footsteps were audible now; they couldn’t be more than twenty feet away. Hermione gave Harry a pleading look, but it was Draco who acted.
But despite Harry’s discomfort, his gaze was still alight with righteous fire, pupils dilated with adrenaline. Fighting to his last breath on the side of good - whether they liked it or not, that was Harry’s element. That was what he’d been conditioned for since he was a fresh-faced child.
Harry nods, numb. Draco’s coolness tells him that Harry’s mind must have given up, wearily presenting its memories to cruel technology.
The sound had alerted the two figures down the road. Both turned, muttering, metal flashing at their waists. Joey stepped into a lake of moonlight, her wand visible. The two men’s scowls were closer. She could count the bullets slung across their torsos. Warning sparks flew from the tip of her wand, and the soldiers raised their guns.
Joey still hadn’t said a word, her head bowed to the clasped hands in her lap. She must have sensed the shift in the air, for she said, “I’m sorry for keeping us here.”
“Oh…” Harry readily accepted the hug, his head naturally nestling in the crook of Draco’s neck. “Erm…I didn’t do much. But you’re welcome.”
At the end of their first week back, the eighth years found themselves with plenty of homework to complete; in addition to a Potions essay and a Herbology packet, the first part of their end-of-year paper was due that Monday. Without a Hogsmeade visit, Quidditch practice or match to distract them, Hermione declared that Saturday a study day, and dragged both Harry and Ron to the library.
Harry’s breath came in shaky pants, and for a moment, he couldn’t move, his back pressed to the cobblestone, stray shoots of grass between his fingers. Nearby, he heard the sounds of scuffling, then-
Joanne’s attention was caught by Andreas, and she reluctantly moved to join him and his friends at a different table. Amélie was too stunned by Draco’s blunt answer that she didn’t even notice.
“Anytime.” The Slytherin melted away into the shadows, footsteps echoing on the way back to the dormitory.
The armchair creaks slightly as Luna perches upon it. Padma catches a whiff of marijuana and strawberry shampoo, and she grits her teeth, telling herself not to notice, to turn from Luna and shut her out without being rude.
“Dahlia has a plan to defeat the Following’s leader,” Connors continued as they listened. “Incapacitate her, for the time being. I’ve instructed my Aurors to tell the Following to stand down, but either none of them can understand English, or else they believe they have the tools to fight back.” It was clear from Connors’s frown that she thought the latter. “In about two minutes, you’re going to create a diversion.” She arched a brow at Draco. “A collection of which I’m told Auror Malfoy has already exploded.”
“I want to tell you something. Something I’ve never told anyone before,” Draco said, causing Potter to focus his attention on the blond. “And I need you not to tell anyone else.”
Their raised and desperate voices echoed throughout the quieting street; the surrounding crowd had begun to watch. The man on the ground pleaded in what Joey now recognized as Filipino, clasping his hands and kneeling prone before the members of Sin Pax. Suddenly, he fell silent - the woman beside him cried out in horror as his body slowly, robotically, sat up, seemingly against his will.
“Or what?” Pansy scoffed. Next to her, Henrietta watched the exchange with both fear and curiosity, blue eyes shifting between the three students. “You filthy half-”
“‘Mione…” Ron starts when his wife comes back down. “I think we should tell him. He’s an adult; he can handle it.”
But even if Draco had convinced Potter to stay with him, why should he oblige? Draco didn’t want his pity - nor did he deserve it. He didn’t even deserve to be here, with the family that the Malfoys had ridiculed and scorned for years.
Harry thought he’d have trouble walking, strapped with all this equipment. But only a faint rattling accompanied every step, and he soon grew less worried about possible discomfort and more concerned about the fact that his body was loaded with explosives.
Unfortunately, Crabbe dodges right into Draco, sending his mother’s wand spinning out of his hand and underneath a tower of broken furniture and boxes. Both Crabbe and Goyle point their wands at Potter, their intention clear.
“Harry, Hermione, Ron,” Professor Dahlia said before the Golden Trio could leave. “Did those people seem familiar to you? Anyone you may have run into during your hunt for Voldemort’s Horcruxes?”
Harry’s heart leaped at Ron’s statement. Small victory though it seemed, Harry felt that he was one step closer to getting Ron and Draco to be real friends. Perhaps one day before they left Hogwarts, the four of them could sit together in the Slytherin common room as they did now.
began as a half-assed diversion for myself, and myself only, when my ex-boyfriend and I were going through some post-breakup drama. I’ve always turned to writing in times of loneliness, self-doubt, and shame. At that time in my life, I needed a story that reflected my own thoughts of uncertainty and yearning for peace. And most of all, I needed a story that made me believe in love again.
“Draco.” The familiar syllables fell from his mouth. “Tell me what’s going to happen when we graduate.”
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy spat as Harry neared, though Harry noticed his tone held a hint of fear instead along with the usual disdain.
Draco hesitated, close enough to hear her strained panting as the flames died down. Harry, still caught in the throes of battle, fired a Lightning Hex, and it crackled through her body. Dao slumped to the ground.
“Oh, um…” Draco grabbed Harry’s shoulders and guided their bodies apart, suddenly aware of how vulnerable he was, without bulky robes to hide anything.
Ron, being a relatively fair person, conceded, “Well, maybe so. But that doesn’t excuse the fact that he’s been a git from day one.”
With Draco’s help, Harry pulled the green-edged vest over his head. With slightly trembling hands, Harry started to unbutton the crisp, white shirt, exposing inch after inch of creamy skin.
“Dragon’s Tongue,” Draco confirmed, his silver eyes shining almost manically. “Nearly killed myself trying to deactivate their explosive powers, but I finally figured it out.” He reached over to his satchel and pulled out a large glass jar of murky, thick, gray liquid. He grabbed another cauldron with one hand and turned off the stove with the other, then poured the more viscous liquid inside, making sure to scoop out every last bit with a small spatula. With a tool that looked like a cross between tweezers and tongs, Draco carefully moved the dozen-or-so leaves of Dragon’s Tongue one by one to the new mixture, where they dissolved.
“I understand that people have their fights and disagreements,” Professor Dahlia said evenly, “But it would suit mature students such as yourself to deal with them outside of time designated for learning. Ten points each from Gryffindor and Slytherin. I’ll see you both after class.”
There were a few tense, frustrated moments of silence, then Ron shook his head again, more relieved this time, and Hermione sighed before kissing Harry’s cheek and squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
“We’re probably starting our dueling unit, by the looks of it,” Harry said, and the rest of the class seemed to be coming to the same conclusion, starting to drift off into pairs.
Immediately, Harry gasped, green eyes fluttering open, and Connors wasted no time bringing the Energy Draught to his lips. Harry sipped some obediently, gaze owlish at the sight of her.
The name meant nothing to Joey. She stared at one word in the headline, the word that turned her trusted friend and colleague into a cold-blooded killer.
The teachers at Hogwarts had learned to deal with these frenzied days, either by controlling the class more than usual or merely letting the regular classwork fall by the wayside. Professor Dahlia Balengchit, even though she was still relatively new to Hogwarts, had already developed a plan for match days.
Draco had no idea what this mysterious Faraday woman looked like, but his gaze flicked to the window anyway, absently trailing over the summer-dressed Muggles that strolled and drove past.
“First of all, I want to thank you guys for dropping a free period to help us out,” Professor Dahlia said from the center of the classroom. Desks had been stacked neatly against the wall to provide an open space. On one side stood the thirteen eighth years; on the other, a group of third years that eyed the older students warily.
“He did, actually,” Harry said, “Because he’s my…friend. Anyway, what’s your problem? I thought you were okay with me talking to him.”
“What do you want?” Harry murmured as he added a third finger, and Draco hissed in pleasure. “What do you want, Draco?” Pumping in and out, slowly, stretching him out, but Draco wanted…
Any hint of excitement in Harry’s voice leached away. “Oh. I don’t think that will…” Then it came surging back, and Joey heard the rustling of cloth as he stood, letting go of her hand. “But it could! It could work. But hold on…” Pacing footsteps echoed through the cave, and Joey smiled slightly despite their grim situation. If anything, she’d gotten Harry to start thinking. “Couldn’t we just Apparate out of here?”
“He did, once,” Draco replied. His pale fingers drummed on the side of the shelf. “When he decided to trust his worst enemy.”
“You heard what you said on the tape,” Draco says, “Somehow, you erased me. And if I don’t remember you from high school either, that means I erased you, too.”
As soon as they found one, apparently unused with the desks stacked against the wall, Harry pushed Malfoy inside and slammed the door, locking it and casting a silencing charm. Malfoy smirked at Harry’s hurry, casually sitting down on the larger, teacher’s desk at the end of the room.
be an ending with a little imagination,” Erin answered, which seemed a little vague to Harry. “Anyhow, seven is the most people we’ve had to play, so I think we’ll come up with something really exciting. Go on, Ollie.”
“HARRY POTTER,” Ginny’s amplified voice boomed from the Quidditch pitch. “FIONA HAS CAUGHT THE SNITCH. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?”
Past the open car windows, the town rumbles along as busily as it had before. The warm, lovey-dovey haze of Valentine’s has since passed, and the cutout hearts and colored streamers in store windows seem less like goodwill and more like taunts in the faces of those who spent that holiday in abject misery. Car horns honk, cigarettes are thrown to yellowed slush, teens laugh and chatter and kick beer cans along the curb amidst the aroma of baking bread. It’s almost New York City, less crowded, without any frills, a miniature city that’s honest with itself and its inhabitants.
“Where’s Joey?” He asked his boyfriend, shoving away the mini existential crisis. There would be time for that later.
“Let me see.” Faraday slowly pushed up Draco’s sleeve, weathered hands tracing the ashy-gray tattoo. “My. The Dark Lord pulls no punches, does he?”
Harry frowned in response but didn’t deign to come up with a retort. They slid out of the photo booth, both doing their best not to acknowledge what had just happened, not even with a look. Thankfully, Ginny and the others had entirely scattered throughout the store and hadn’t noticed them.
“I’ve thought about this a lot, Harry. Really. I still don’t think…” Draco nibbled at his lower lip, curling his knees to his chest. “I don’t think I can support a child.
Harry opened his eyes again, seeing the satisfied smirk spreading across Malfoy’s face. Grabbing Malfoy’s chin vigorously, Harry forced his face downwards. “You’re enjoying yourself too much.”
Draco shrugged, no easy feat while lying down. “Guess you bring that out in me,” He replied, silver eyes glittering mischievously. “Oh - speaking of being out in the open…” Draco reached for his wand from his bag and cast muttered charms, drawing the curtains and plunging them into darkness.
Dahlia raised an eyebrow. “I’m not asking for you to throw your career away, Harry. But do what you can.”
“Do quote something from it; you must have all her papers memorized,” Draco said seriously, but he laughed when Harry made a face at him, and Joey realized he must have been teasing.
The fight grew fiercer as it went on, Draco’s faster magic prompting Harry to focus enough for proper blocking spells or simply find more creative ways to dodge. Slowly he grew more confident, pressing forward, firing spells that Draco barely kept up with. As they fought, the room seemed to close in on them, shrinking, the surrounding torches dimming. It took a while for Draco to even notice, and when he did, he couldn’t help but recall how much it looked like the polished foyer in Malfoy Manor…
“Looking sharp, mate,” Ron said, sidling next to him. He’d opted for wizarding dress robes, in a shade of midnight blue that unsurprisingly didn’t clash with his red hair. The style was unelaborate yet refined, with clear-cut edges, layers that became slightly darker as they moved inward, and a collar thankfully lacking lace.
Several dark shapes rustled in the bushes. Draco stiffened in apprehension. “Thestrals?” He whispered, and Harry nodded.
,” Harry whispered, and waited for the spell to pass through the house. “Nothing. Someone could be hiding, though…”
Night compressed his lungs for a painful moment, then they were standing on a different roof, higher up, the flapping of enormous wings sending a breeze through Draco’s hair. The beast, startled by their appearance, hissed menacingly, and Draco’s vision began to darken at the edges. He realized now why it was named the Shadow Dragon; every flap of its wings seemed to snuff out more of the glow emitting from the streets.
Draco’s silent for a long time, his gaze flicking from Harry’s to the sky to the snow. A car drives steadily by, meandering down the street, headlights flashing as it turns a corner.
Something immensely substantial and rock-hard crashes on Draco’s head. His eyes roll back, and he collapses onto the dusty floor.
Draco spilled onto his sheets, panting and overheated from his activity. He slumped into the mattress as he let himself roll through his climax, the white that filled his vision fizzing out as his head cleared.
“They don’t know I have access to the Black home since it’s hidden. Father is a traditionalist and Mother has done all she could to support him. Neither are bad on their own, but consider they are given the open opportunity to confront two individuals of abnormality in their strict no tolerance world, now imagine how that would go. Father would have you sent back to the muggle world for one thing if given the choice. He backed the segregationist movement from the beginning to keep a consistent position of power to maintain the family name and finance. I can’t trust either as a result when it comes to you or my Uncles well-being.” Draco kept writing as he talked, using it to distract him from what he was confessing to.
Sirius and Remus were shaken to the core at everything they saw. They were still helping to contain the black hole a cursebreaker and Auror had begun to dissipate, but that meant they were stuck on the other side of the street, looking up the steps of the bank at their son and nephew. The two holding onto each other as they worked their way down to them. They had the look of survivors. It brought back memories of the day Remus had been bit, the days when they had fought and run from the Death Eaters themselves, the time Rudolfus had ended up in hospital. All permanent scars left in the wake.
“Everyone, maintain position and push back!” Tom Yelled over the din of other noises as he directed the group to move through the opposition, a large round barrier held together by every Auror and teacher present looked like a big raindrop racing along the ground. Looking up Harry watched the giant fists of stone slide off them, the light blue film of protection between him and being crushed was unlikable at best and he reminded himself of what it would have been like if he’d tried to do this alone like every other time before.
“What would you do?” He cut into her rant and she stopped abruptly at his tone. Calculating eyes watching him.
“Thank you mister Weasley.” Harry choked out as he accepted a too long handshake. The foreign concern had made him cling to Roody, he was gentle; and if Roody was gentle then Mr. Weasley was what Harry imagined Santa Clause was like, Jolly. His eyes hurt from staring unblinking with big eyes at the man that only seemed to indulge the moment with an ever-brighter smile.
“How much time left?” Remus leaned forward, elbows on his knees where he sat across from his friend.
He fiddled with the small vase of flowers he’d grabbed on impulse when he was told everything. The ones he remembered Lucius plucking petals off of in herbology years ago when he was still Severus’ Lucius. He’d said he liked the color, shiny pale purples and almost blues. He sat it down in the best place he could on the small table, feeling stupid for how fussy he was being, every old feeling he’d thought he’d finally mastered and stuffed away had flown right out again when Tom had rung the second time.
“Harry,” Draco snapped his fingers in front of his face. “What kind of dream, you have to tell me. Was there someone in it, even just talking about it can stop it from getting in again.”
“Nonsense. Is Sirius and Roody—?” He cut himself off and bore his eyes into two shimmering gray orbs.
He gestured and Tom stood to address the room. “Tom Riddle, case worker for Harry Potter speaking. We are unanimous in the removal of Harry Potter from the Dursley’s as the court has decided previously today. With that proposal addressed it is now time to broach the subject of adoption.”
“So, who knows about Corpse plants?” Harry called for someone to come over, pleasantly enough it turned out to be Roody.
Her voice traveling down to where a small scuffle of the argument cut short to travel towards them. Sirius stomping into view as a smaller hairless being followed, a deep frown and bare thread cloth all that adorned him. He stopped and seemed to force calm into himself when he saw Harry, a tick of worry that he might scare him.
Trudging downstairs to the warm glow of candle light and silly shimmering decorations the two boys enjoyed the sight of everything just for an extra moment. The floppy tree, the two adults that acted like children as they cuddled on the sofa in matching sweaters so bright red Draco secretly wanted to light them on fire with or without the people in them, and two short brownies happily bounding around the corner with trays of food that really should have gone on the dining table but ended up on the smaller coffee table in the sitting room.
“Remus Lupin speaking, for the record. Hello, you all know me. I have taught some of your children and gone to school with most of you. I know that me and Sirius were not always the most responsible back then and I do apologize for that even now. I have been given the unique chance in my position to not only speak on behalf of a long-suffering minority in the magical world but to also teach my students the danger and very real ways to stop that danger associated with werewolves among many other things. When you have lived your entire life with something it becomes second nature to live accommodating it. I am not the reckless youth of my past; I am not a danger to society and most importantly I am not a danger to my family or the children under my care. I have always been willing to fight for this and I do it now again this day in hope that you will make the kind decision instead of the “logical” one.” Remus dipped into a shallow bow before returning to Sirius, their hands clasping together in a tight grip.
“Alright, so I’m willing to bet this Devil’s snare Corpse plant hybrid doesn’t just eat bugs or in this case humans. It’s been down here for a long time so it clearly has a food source or can return to dormancy, we just have to trigger a response to let go and close up or to pollinate.” Harry looked over to Roody who nodded, not in simple agreement, it was clear he planned to do whatever was asked of him.
Was this really okay? Will Draco hate him now? Dumbledore said it was okay though. He said it didn’t matter.
“All of them are different but paintings are known to be a bit chatty or annoying in some way. When I went to school, the paintings in Hogwarts would watch students and Gryffindor’s dorm entrance was even guarded by one that would keep us out sometimes just because she wanted to sing to an audience.”
“Now, I can’t let something like that stand.” Draco smirked as he scooped Harry up in his arms to secure him chest to chest. The friction of cotton trapped between them pulled at Harry’s attention as Draco leaned down to press their lips together.
Draco helped keep him busy and awake till they had him in a bed in the Infirmary being looked over. No one noticed the little green beetle that scuttled away and out the front doors.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.” Tom huffed as he went over the small gold engraving on the handle latch.
Walburga raised a shapely brow at him, “That is not a bad idea. Do die while you’re at it will you?”
Harry just looked up at him, Draco held no sympathy, this boy, this dirt covered muggle looked like an utter mess and it was fitting. His father would have agreed. He snorted to himself at the thought.
“Let me get this right, why are we all doing this?” Ron let himself get dragged towards the small gathering at the Hogwarts double doors as they opened for the day.
“They emit the smell of spoiled meat to attract bugs.” His tone was serious, like he was debriefing another officer.
Hagrid apparently had a penchant for bringing home orphaned wild animals and the puppy he had smuggled onto the grounds was the size of a human being already. Of course, it was, why wouldn’t it be huge and happy to see you like all of Hagrid’s animals. Apparently the deep green cutey would grow to the size of a bull easily and its little barks would become strong enough to incite instant terror and death.
“I’m his girlfriend these days, but we started as friends. I mean obviously.” She coughed a bit to clear her throat. “I’ve heard all about you from him, I hope we can be good friends too.”
He’d been looking forward to this chance at new experimenting since the school had opened, and after years of only the most elite wizards having an inkling of knowledge, Hogwarts had started teaching Alchemy. They had dreams of this, of being the first ones to discover the answers to the immortal soul, the essence of life, and all the biggest questions. Gellert had always been one for forbidden things, least of which was his lovely assistant and fellow student Albus Dumbledore. Despite the harsh view of his peers and their disgust of the rumored yet secretly kept relations they shared, Albus had always been steadfast in his loyalty and friendship.
“I’m scared of…” Losing you forever. But if Harry says it aloud, then… “I’m sorry I ever hurt you, Draco. I want to make this work.”
Perched upon the seat, Draco began to tell Harry of his visit to St. Mungo’s. Harry could tell by the way Draco glanced down at his hands every so often that he kept some details hidden, but Harry didn’t pressure him for them. He understood the gist: Narcissa was okay, Lucius not in his right mind, and the Malfoys’ future uncertain.
The statement was met with matching grim stares of affirmation. A former Dark apprentice and a son of prophecy had sparred with a dragon without breaking a sweat; Joey wasn’t worried about their level of expertise.
Then there was the matter of Henrietta. It was Hermione who found her, a blanket over her head in the Slytherin girls’ dormitory. As it turned out, Henrietta had been over Draco for months, and was merely afraid of what Pansy would do to her if she sided with him and Harry. Once she found out Hermione knew how to cast a good Frog-Eyes Hex and Ginny Weasley was friends with Harry, Henrietta seemed comfortable enough to retract her friendship from Pansy. The dark-haired Slytherin, nose only just fixed by Madam Pomfrey after Ginny’s righteous blitz, responded with a nasally, “Whatever.”
Sadly, as the trio reached the base of the statue, no uniform-clad Auror jumped out to greet them. Joey pretended to read the plaque on the pedestal while simultaneously scanning her surroundings - her partners did the same. Around them walked mostly tourists, with a few civilians mixed in - a pair of siblings in flipflops, a family chattering rapidly in Japanese, three American girls snapping pictures with their brand-new Blackberries, a man in a black jacket with his head on a swivel, a young couple leading their toddler around the park…wait a minute.
After taking the smallest sip he could, Draco leaned back. "Tastes how it smells," He said, wrinkling his nose.
Another bang echoed from the outside. “What the…” Harry made for the door, grabbing his glasses on the way. He poked his head outside of the common room and witnessed pure chaos. A pair of younger students had set off a pile of Weasley’s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs, but they’d placed the rockets too close together, and the fireworks seemed to be exploding at random, out of their control. Slytherin students shrieked and rushed for the safety of the hallway or their dormitories as the colorful projectiles whizzed into the air, bursting when it came into contact with the wall or someone’s robes. Thankfully, no one seemed to be hurt just yet, but Harry slammed the door against the mayhem, heart hammering as he realized something.
Without warning, Draco tightened his hold, leaned close, and pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s temple, almost making him lose his train of thought.
Though Draco shared his sentiment, his curiosity took over, and he smoothed out the parchment. It was a crude drawing of two stick figures engaging in genitalia-less, primitive intercourse. The top person had a forked, snake-like tongue, while the bottom had round glasses. The doodle looked so stupid that Draco snorted and tossed it to his boyfriend.
Even through his alcohol-induced haze, Draco realizes. “Harry, I…” His fingers lace through Harry’s, but Harry tugs away immediately.
Draco, rifling through a maroon and white pamphlet, sat cross-legged on his bed and glanced up when Harry came in. “Hello,” he greeted.
“So modest,” Draco said, smirking, and obligingly faced away. “And if you’re talking about me becoming an Auror in what some may call ‘indentured servitude,’” Sarcastic hand quotes, “then no. I’m not particularly nervous.”
Draco faltered slightly, caught off guard from the accusation. Harry took the opportunity to grab his right wrist and toss the wand aside; Draco scoffed at him and immediately knelt to retrieve it, but Potter pushed him into the snow.
When he woke, the dream lingered in his mind like dew after a rainstorm. He lay still for a few minutes, processing, debating whether it could have been real or not. It
“I’m sorry.” Apologies had gotten easier for Draco since he’d become Harry’s friend. “I’m just trying to be cautious. I don’t want her to get hurt again.”
Harry smiled at his boyfriend’s uncharacteristic softness and knelt by him, picking up the dropped letter. The envelope was soaked through, and Harry tried but failed to make out the smudged address.
“It’s a long and complicated history,” Harry said. A bloodstained school rivalry turned secret romance - it had been enough to draw judgment from Harry’s best friends. He couldn’t imagine what Joey’s reaction would be.
, Malfoy?” Draco slumped over, putting his head in his hands. “Death Eaters?” Draco’s shoulders began to shake; at first, Harry thought he was crying again, but when the Slytherin spoke, he realized it was from fear.
Ice shards as sharp as knives flashed through the rain in hundreds, straight towards Harry. “No!” Someone screamed, and whether it was Draco himself or Dahlia, he didn’t know, only watched as Harry’s body was torn to pieces…
“I…” Yes, I do, Harry wants to say, but instead he shuts his eyes. Another beep sounds, and when he opens his eyes again, it’s another evening in the living room, the couch pulled out and the sheets unmade.
“Yeah,” Potter gave the duo a parting wave before focusing his attention on Draco. “How’s your day been so far?”
A pecking sound came at the kitchen window an hour after breakfast. It was the Sunday the Hogwarts students had to return to school, and most of them were scattered about the house, looking for lost gloves and deciding whether to pack extra jackets.
No sooner had Ray led them to a smaller room, lined with cabinets and set with wooden stools, did Harry blurt, “How on Merlin’s green earth were they doing that?”
A rogue Bludger suddenly whooshed past Draco’s head, and he jerked his broom reflexively. Draco’s side was shoved into Harry’s torso, and the Chosen One was so caught off guard by the contact he nearly forgot he was supposed to be mad at his friend. “Watch it yourself, Malfoy,” Harry managed. Draco only narrowed his eyes and flew off through the rain. Cursing his own hesitation, Harry zoomed off in the opposite direction.
Joey sighed, bowing her head, and Draco thought she might have been praying. She looked up again and set her jaw. “May I use a restroom?”
Harry cleared his throat. “…Right.” Secretly, he’d been hoping for a repeat of the night before, but there was something steely in Draco’s expression that made him unwilling to contradict him.
Cries and sirens wailed through the market. Joey was already on her feet, and Draco and Harry followed, scanning for any injured. The blast radius couldn’t have been more than twenty meters, and most people within it - not many, thank Merlin - were stirring, every figure covered in the same dark gray debris. A few had blood oozing from light scratches, but mostly everyone seemed more stunned than injured.
Harry watched in surprise as Draco calmly rattled off the list. Joey politely interjected when she felt the need to, but mostly she listened and copied down the potion names. This morning, they hadn’t worked together nearly as well; Harry wondered if Draco had just cooled down since, or something Harry said got through to him.
A series of faint, chaotic noises echoed from Hermione’s end. The thundering crash of books, a deep, “Harry? You’re talking to Harry?” and rapid footsteps announced Ron’s presence.
Padma’s curiosity steers her gaze to Luna, whose gaze tends to the ceiling, eyes traveling across remembered words.
“Draco.” Harry gathered his distressed friend into his arms. He moved his hand in soothing circles on Draco’s back as he cried silently into Harry’s shoulder. “It’s okay… It’s okay,” He said it over and over, like a chant. “You’ll be okay.”
Harry huffed, his heart still pounding. “Was that really necessary? I thought someone was going to kill me.”
“You don't know them. A poor orphan I plucked from the streets. They needed guidance, so I took them in.” Dao raised and lowered one shoulder. “Small prices to pay for a servant. They’re a slippery little rabbit.”
Draco yelled, swiping his wand viciously, and a crackling jet of blue light shot towards Pansy. She deflected it at the last second, the Shield Charm absorbing the spell with a sound like thunder. Harry stepped forward to help, but Draco threw out an arm, holding him back.
“Enter,” Called a low, female voice, and the secretary hurriedly opened the door for Draco, letting him through.
Dishes clink and clatter in the nearby kitchen. Harry slumps, tipsy, on the maroon-colored sofa. The warm light of the lamp illuminates photographs perched upon the stuffed bookshelf - mostly of Hermione and Ron, though Harry makes an appearance in many.
Harry silenced him with a fierce kiss, parting Malfoy’s lips unwillingly with his tongue. Simultaneously, Harry pressed Malfoy’s knees to the desk, arms flexing with the effort, to allow him easier access. Malfoy let out a startled “Mmph!” as Harry’s length filled him once more, silver eyes rolling back at the sensations this new angle created. But the moment he’d gained his bearings once more, his gaze snapped back to the boy fucking him ruthlessly, taking in every drop of sweat and inch of bronzed skin. The order in Harry’s emerald eyes was crystal clear, and Malfoy wasted no time complying.
Awed gasps rustled through the gathering as the final pair began to stroll down the aisle. Harry, dressed in a crisp, Muggle-style tuxedo with a lilac-colored bowtie, led Hermione as she clung to his arm. He caught Draco’s eye, smiling almost imperceptibly, but everyone else’s attention was on the bride. Hermione’s pure white gown rustled along the grass, the lacy, see-through sleeves set against her light brown skin. Her thick, dark hair had been let loose and flowing, adorned with a long, gossamer veil that had already been thrown back, revealing a face enhanced with light makeup and an excited smile. Amethyst dripped from her ears and her wrists, nearly hidden by a lavish bunch of flowers - heather, white and lavender-colored roses, lilac, ferns, and baby’s breath.
But he didn’t allow himself to be complacent. As Ollie had put it, “Even if some people aren’t outright homophobic, they’ll let their friends be.”
“Taking off the mask and breaking her connection to the other souls is the best way to weaken her. A spell that simple won’t get through,” Dahlia insisted. “I know I’m asking a lot of you. I don’t expect you to trust me.”
“We were busy brewing a potion, as you may recall,” Draco told him, unable to bar his voice’s contempt. “Granger said a quick hello to me at the cupboards and told me I might enjoy this.” He tapped the royal blue cover, which read,
“If she ever needs it, we’ll help,” Draco promised. He slipped a hand into Harry’s as they made their way from the clearing.
Draco rolled his eyes, but his frustration wasn’t directed at his friend. “I’ve had too many of those, to be honest. I…do you mind if I ramble a bit?”
Danjuma beamed, running a deep brown, stubby hand over her tight, salt-and-pepper curls almost bashfully. “Tea from home. Milo, hot water, cocoa powder, and evaporated milk. Add spices if you wish.”
“Involve the Ministry?” Draco’s voice was damp with suspicion. “Absolutely not. They’re more the ‘lock people up, ask questions later’ type. And I’d rather not let them toss me in Azkaban just yet.”
Harry repeated the phrase in his head while he paced back and forth with his eyes closed. On the third recitation, he opened his eyes to a polished wooden door set in the cobblestone.
“You lot be careful, all right?” Hermione said, giving Harry and Draco a farewell hug each. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
The school gardens sprawled in full bloom across the courtyard, filling the spring air with the scent of lavender, rosebushes, and camellias. As the couple followed their peers along the path to Hogsmeade, the plants grew wilder, heather and daisies adorning their footsteps and trees waving leaf-covered arms over their heads. The few apple trees dotting the trail had reached their peak, and sweet blossoms the color of fresh milk drifted onto the ground like miniature angels. If Harry took off his glasses, he thought, he’d see blurs of white indistinguishable from a thick flurry of snowflakes. Snow in April; wonders would never cease.
The familiar voice pierced the quiet like a sword through ice. Draco, who seemed to be in a rush, came up to Harry, looking more animated than usual. A clinking sound came from his school bag, which hung heavily across one shoulder.
Draco thought, uncomfortably aware that he was still wearing the Quidditch underclothes from the day before.
Though he didn’t voice the concern out loud, Narcissa guessed what her son was thinking. “Lucius is stronger than you think,” She said, and this time her voice was hard as steel.
“I abandoned you, that was me. I hurt him, I loved him and I hurt him too. I told myself, promised the first time I held him I would never hurt him.” His father had said he wasn’t different and now he wasn’t, that couldn’t be taken back.
“Contrary to how I act as you’ve pointed out before I don’t know everything Ronald. Honestly some of them look sicker than you do about this.” She snarked. “It’s starting to grate on me the longer I watch. Are they so disgusted by me that they’d rather associate with a muggle without magic before one with it? No offense.” She hurriedly added.
“Oh, my fucking fuck Bellatrix, you are supposed to be fighting me!” Harry yelled and Draco dared to glance back over to see his Aunt getting clocked with a heavy marble chunk from one of the broken-up pillars. It was a horrifying few seconds as a flash of a curse pulsed between their two bodies, to close to see what it had done and too quiet to hear what she had cast. They both fell hard with a resounding thud. Goblins had rushed over from their own hiding places to crowd the two and Draco hurdled his obstacles to get there.
Harry blushes and scrubbed his mopey black hair. Why did it have to be piers? Anyone, even another bloke, any bloke would be better than one of his tormentors. It was like Harry was finding ways to punish himself now, make himself more miserable. The revelation of his disposition only added to what the Dursley’s would call his list of faults.
Tom hit the lounger hard as he slumped into the cushion. A glint was cast off his eyes where they looked watery and didn’t that just instill a grim feeling in Remus’ gut. The smell like brimstone told Remus all he had to know about how long Tom had been like this, he hadn’t showered in some time to have the scent of floo powder rubbed into his clothes. He had blood dried in his hair and his eyes looked somewhere past his own.
It was a bedroom, may have been used by someone in the family in the past. That much was clear. What it held should not have been there. Should not have been anywhere.
““It was made to as Pansy once put it “Hold up the school”. She said that the other founders cut Salazar Slytherin from the stone because he was going to bring the school down.” Harry answered, a question forming on his face.
Harry lay in bed nervously, the steps of his uncle knocking dust down onto him as they went to bed. He had been wishing a lot lately, tonight he did again. Thinking of Draco, he tried to imagine his new family. He would have parents, he thought disbelievingly. It hadn’t even fully registered that they would be two fathers that understood. He felt exhausted as the days passed and he hoped each time he heard a door open or close that it was for him.
The route through Surrey’s was split into numerous different paths. Harry had waited till he was at the bottom of the area before hopping off the bus so he was relatively close to his destination. He worked his way up the incline of the dirt path to England’s highest natural summit point. Leith Hill.
When Harry had begged him to let him show the class that he could hold his own in defense; that it was a skill that everyone should be allowed to practice and that he shouldn’t be left out, no one had taken it seriously. The Ravenclaws hadn’t been too different having been unsure about what Harry could do besides the many essays he’d had added on to supplement grades in his magic classes. He’d been thinking up alternate ways to accomplish most of the same things the spells did in class, even going so far as to letter Sirius about a lockpick set for when the class would learn Alohomora soon. It may not change anyone else schooling experience, but it was everything to him and it made peoples day once they noticed.
Back at headquarters Tom sat across from Lucius with a qualified healer who had taken far too long in their mandatory screening. The platinum blonde hair of the Malfoy lord was untied and dangling over him like a small curtain, his eyes glazed over from where the healer was shifting through his mind. He could see the grey band of color eclipse with overly dilated pupils as the search continued deeper into his subconscious. With each ticking second of his pocket watch open and in hand Tom grew just a bit more nervous as to the reason this evaluation was taking so long.
“What kind of payment do you take? The references I have said its always different.” He watched her upturn a few jars and shove a bookend out of the way.
It was the start of twilight when the doorbell rang. If anything, everyone was excited at the prospect that Tom had visited and they were all at the door to open it. Instead, everyone but Harry froze at the stranger who should not have been capable of finding their home.
“Maybe because he expresses himself! I ask again, what is your malfunction? You’ve been acting strange all day. Is it because you got in trouble because of me?”
The wisp kept tugging, a silent encouragement to commit to what could be Harry’s final mistake, but still, he came this far. Harry pushed the door open, it moved with ease, the confirmation that the stranger had been telling the truth.
“Come sit, I’m told you two have been too curious for your own good. It sounds like you just need to be told how it is in order to prevent future accidents.” Albus waved to the table for everyone to sit.
“Perish the thought.” Severus rolled his eyes. “That I should be pulled towards those two monkeys in adult life as well. Have I not suffered their attention enough?” He drawled.
The first month went by like a blizzard, fast, but blinding and overwhelming in all the ways you’d expect. All day was classes, both the kind from muggle school and then those for magic making the curriculum either completely normal at first glance or a complete unknown factor. That meant twice the work and class time from usual. The long breaks in between had been a godsend once he’d learned about them. Draco as promised spent every waking moment with him and away from his friends who had been eyeing him with a mix of emotions for a while. They were waiting.
“Won’t have to sneak off for a drink now?” Harry asked Draco fondly as he passed him his huge horn carved mug. “Is this stout?” He asked incredulously.
“You have to take it Albus, listen to me, you need it. Please, please take it love.” He felt tears prick at his eyes as Albus once again looked on in some kind of confusion. “It’s not time for you to die yet.”
“Probably because you’re the only one who can get in to anywhere or something along those lines. Get a picture and I’ll just have Jacob take credit for insurance.” The man raised his brow at her.
The entrance banged open, the metal of the doorknocker hitting the frame startling the blonde man. It was a strangely foreign sensations in Lucius only growing at the death glare that stared back at him.
By the time Ms. Evette stepped away both her and Lucius looked visibly sweaty and exhausted from the ordeal.
“No, I’m not asking. I get that I’m not in his league or whatever you wanna say. That’s not your choice and never was. You can either like it or get over it I don’t care which, but keep in mind he does.” Harry leaned back onto the wall when he was done, the awkward energy from the confrontation was only growing. Should he have just said that outright?
Draco was on his own like the others now, he’d woken to the tight reins of roots and vines chaining him to the trunk of a tree. A startled yelp escaped when he saw the majority of the roots was the very thing that had dragged him away. He was being kept down by a hulking body. It didn’t so much as move an inch, just tightened its hold further like he was going to slowly squeeze the life out of him if he dared to struggle.
So, someone was after him, he thought as the cruel words of Walburga washed over him, but never soaking in. They were going to ruin his parent’s lives. He wasn’t going to get to stay or have a family if they won. His eyes flickered up at his in-denial grandmother.
He hadn’t had the choice or time to go out looking for presents given the uprooting of his entire life and the continuous stress it had brought, but he stopped to plan out asking the Hogwarts Brownies if he could use the kitchens to bake, he was good at cooking and baking thinks. Ron loved food. He’d have to make enough for everyone though.
“It is really sticky isn’t it? Poor clean freak Tom, you have a hard enough time with the clothes I leave on the floor.” He teased.
The Death Eaters were falling in equal amounts to the Aurors, by the time The Aurors were on their last legs there was only half the Death eaters’ original numbers. The rest were scattering by the time he had Lucius in hand, immobilized but clearly hyperventilating from his prone position on the floor.
“And how is Kreacher?” Harry asks with a raised brow. Sirius looks away and puffs his cheeks out just a bit before replying.
“Fine, you may be as unexceptional as any other muggle or mud blood, but at least you are pleasant. There are very few people that do not annoy me or try to pretend, your easy to read and pay attention when I talk.” Draco couldn’t help a blush as he glanced down at Sirius who was watching.
The other boy sat stock still and Draco huffed in frustration as he had to throw an arm over his shoulder. He was doing it again; he was ruining himself in front of everyone for this stupid muggle who needed him. His words weren’t going to mean much to cover up his new allegiance if he had to literally go back on them the same day in front of the same people he bluffed to. Dammit, how was he supposed to be clever and plot things like this? Honestly it was like Harry just over road any other concerns. He’d just have to take the beating eventually, but he’d hoped to avoid it at least for a while.
“I won’t have you coming into my home and telling me how to do things! Potter is treated how he should be, no more no less. Now get out!” Vernon boiled over. The Auror’s were not impressed.
“When you say it like that it makes me feel worse, I’m related to her too after all.” Draco scowled.
Draco looked dumbstruck as Harry turned and started to run away. He heard the blonde suddenly call out in alarm and chase after him as the laughing started up again. The harsh and frank way of Moody teaching had intimidated a lot of kids away from stepping up to try for fear of embarrassment, but Harry was changing that. Sometimes it just took one person doing something.
“I had forgotten actually. Anyways, you’d be worried leaving me here if you think about it that way.”
“That is the weakest—Hey—I’m sorry.” Harry was a little disoriented when the body next to him moved away, not for long though.
Albus had to grab Minerva to steady her the next time she tripped. She fumbled an apology as she cast her wand downward and stilled. A slim root had broken through the floor in front of her and although the path ahead was still pitch black against their Lumos held outward there was undoubtably something close. The air had changed to something humid and fragrant, like fresh morning grass. It would have been relaxing in another place, except everyone knew that whatever it was ahead it would probably try to kill them. Just the thought made Draco sigh heavily and receive a few looks of agreement from the others.
“I’m okay,” He choked out. “I’m actually okay, he didn’t get me. I’m just tied up by some bind.” He let his head hit the ground and shut is eyes in relief. He could sleep right here without giving it a second thought. “Can you get Tom and my dads please…” He mumbled tiredly.
“Mr. Riddle, if you’ll please step out with me for one moment.” She panted as she swept her hair behind her ears.
Kreacher was fast to bring the two boys’ mugs of hot chocolate as they stumbled the rest of the way into the room and found their little perches to sit on. Hedwig glided in to fling herself into the tree, it didn’t hold her well and it sunk a bit, but Hedwig was nothing if not stubborn. Her presence made up for the lack of Tom and Nagini some. Grandma Walburga’s frame couldn’t be moved since it had been charmed, but Harry was pleasantly surprised to find a similar frame now hung on the far wall where her and who he assumed was Orion Black sat together talking quietly.
She laughed so hard at his words that she doubled over for a moment before snapping back up. It was like watching a signal flag for a race being waved and They both dove for it. Her towards him, him behind a divider screen.
“Good morning my love…” He watched a flicker of something in those wizened blue orbs, Albus seeming content to wait. “I have something of yours.” He said as he walked over and presented the box. Albus sucked in a breath at the sight of his promise box from his school years.
“Good job son.” Ron’s father said from a few steps down the stairs. “Your mother has everyone waiting, so no need to worry.” He said before going back down with a smile.
“Are you really so scared of your own friends? I’ve been bullied by kids that always hated me, but shouldn’t your friends be different?”
The two adults of the house had forgone the talk of forcing the two kids into their own beds for their morning nap, that would count as their rest for the night they missed, on account of them looking like they needed the closeness. Sirius and Remus kept a window open for an owl, and the floo in the corner of their eyes waiting for news on Albus. The two sat down nibbling some well-earned breakfast.
The flower base was open for now, clearly inching closed like a mouth around the flesh central spine that stood out of it like a pillar. It looked like it was going to eat them. The spine they were stuck to had its own vines made up of the structure, the Devil’s snare presumably mixed with the Corpse flower was probably what gave it the strength to pull in and hold whole human beings. Mandrakes were huddled around it protectively; they had a clear symbiotic relationship.
“Alright, you did a good job little Hill, ‘re ya are.” The groundkeeper dangled the slice and Hill tested a few loose bites into it to get the food away safely to eat.
Mr. Weasley was a good guide, walking him down the street and pointing out interesting facts about things Harry had never seen before. At some point they ended up stationed in front of the Brooms, a heated discussion on what the hell Quidditch was. Harry tested out how safe he really was and deliberately argued albeit gently against a few points that had Arthur brighten.
“I can’t let it happen again.” He wailed to his love who cried silently as he listened in horror. “I can’t let them do this to us again. We have to stop them Albus.”
“Me and Sirius will look around elsewhere then since you’ve got the perimeter, just yell for us if you find it.” Harry past the line of them spread out inspecting the walls and ended up picking up his personal favorite of his two Aurors, Roody, and Draco of course who had refused to stay still and was half covered in dirt at this point. Raw nerves were bright in his eyes and Harry reached out to take his hand as they went. Sirius had a look on his face like he wanted to say something when he looked back at them all, but he’d decided for a while now that keeping undetected by the Mandrakes with his wand still held fast was the best defense for them and wouldn’t be changing that now.
“I would do anything. What can you do; is a better question for such an incompetent child.” She declared easily. He got an unsettling feeling like he was being sized up.
Draco stopped altogether as he turned to look at his companion. “I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that.”
Every hit or injury Draco had ever had was visible, painted over him like they had never gone away. Clothes gone he threw a hand up to clutch at his shirt where a deep bruise covered his chest reds and purple. The others behind him just as morbidly hurt. The mirror showed the pain they had endured physically and he couldn’t be sure it didn’t do more. It was horrible to witness the naked forms of himself and his companions in such a state but he couldn’t look away from the side view he had of Harry, the litany of slashing red stripes across almost every inch, cuts and even a bone shard sticking out of his arm as it rested at his side casually.
“Quiet down everyone.” A stern woman in a severe hair bun called out from just a few steps above them. “My name if Professor McGonagall, I’ll be your transfiguration teacher here. I know we’re all very excited for our first-year learning magic, but the first lesson you will learn here is to act appropriately. I expect all of you to file up into a line that will stand at the entrance to the dining hall and from there you will be called alphabetically to be sorted. You will remain silent in respect to each other and your future house mates. Once the ceremony is over you will be free to be as loud as you find necessary.”
The best he could guess, they were a breed of Mandrake and if he was lucky that meant that Hufflepuff had diluted and altered them by breeding them into a new subspecies. Some old weapons had been traded out to make them more hostile to intruders, but the same rules may still apply on how to deal with them. She had to have made them stand down to get past somehow, after all she needed to be able to get past too.
“You need a class partner to do the practical portions of the lessons, right? Father said something about it when he was ranting. I just mean that if you do come, I’m willing to play the part, since we are—”
The first challenge would be finding where the roots started, the place where stem met earth and they could begin to tear a path down. They had no way of knowing what waited. How far down. How many would fall to the school or the woman they hunted. They marched forwards to the root.
“You’re the one who had me worried!” Tom protested in mock rage as he grappled to earn a free hand and pull up Albus’ nightgown. He was blessedly unclothed beneath and tom’s smile turned to that of a wicked grin.
It was a hovering observation for some time he hadn’t wanted to dwell on; the new reality he lived in that left him feeling floaty like it was just a dream, a reprieve, from the real world and couldn’t possibly last. He used to float at times back at the Dursley’s, back when he needed it to stop and never did so he just let that part inside him, he could help, leave for a little while.
To anyone else he might have corrected the statement. This was not someone he felt safe with that knowledge. It was like looking into the cage of a lion. An unshaven, raven haired, golden eyed lion. He licked his lips and tried to think of what to say. Of how to ask.
The rest of their time was spent retaliating against the twin’s pranks and Harry following along with Ron like a duckling as he learned. It was easier to take all the change with someone to buffer it all and remind you that you’re not in trouble, that you have permission, even if it was for the most basic things. Ron had never felt so wanted or needed.
“Yes, and I’m sure now the voices I heard were Bellatrix and Tom. I think it’s what happened, but the rest hasn’t? It’s supposed to be a prophecy, right? So, there should be things that are going to happen unless I haven’t dreamed them yet.” Harry was wringing his hands together.
It was then they began to worry, looking to the history of the school and any clues Narcissa was no doubt following to try and crawl her way further in the foundations of Hogwarts to the still undisclosed location of the cornerstone. The more they searched the reachable places of the school the more the war of fear in everyone’s hearts crept closer. It was just a school maybe, just a home perhaps, a fond memory to most absolutely, but just a school nonetheless. It showed in the growing desperation and severe frowns on some of their faces how that fact just didn’t matter, Hogwarts was and would most likely always be their home, much more than just a place. Harry knew that feeling now too and it scared him just a bit.
Narcissa had been baring her teeth and her ashen complexion only turned paler at the sight of her last obstacle holding what they both clearly knew was an unmatched weapon while standing proudly atop her goal.
“You are not my kind… He sends a rat here. An insult. Did he want to see if I would give you mercy? I will show you mercy.” He hissed as he pulled his wand from his side.
The house was empty unfortunately, the estate itself locked down till the Muggle sentence would be passed on the Dursley family soon. It was a loss Bella would mourn. All the best things you had to fight for and this was only the first step. Sure, a brutal muggle death would have held her for a bit, but hopefully she could just impart what she was going to do to her disgusting brother and his misfit family on all the available furniture. This just had to give her an opportunity.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—” He was gasping and it was impossibly difficult. The two men recognized a panic attack when they saw it and Draco wasn’t stupid, just inexperienced.
Draco shook the memory free of his head. It had been a halfhearted attempt, what he had tried to do. He supposed that was because he never wanted to do what he was told for once. He had no motivation to distance himself and every personal reason to get closer. His father had left things at that, but his intentions would shine through no matter what in the end, it was just a matter of how long Lucius would pretend not to see.
Taking the hint to go first he unwrapped the medium sized square and was greeted with a leather case, it was innocuous in nature without labels of any kind. The soft padding, he felt indicated it held something safely inside. Unclasping the binds to open it, he let out a soft gasp. His confusion must have shown because Sirius finally said something, started to babble really. The case held a series of rune and charmed accessories.
“Magic.” Roody sat down next to him. “You see, the British government and magical parliament are joint. Child services extend as well. Usually it’s not muggles but abandoned muggle-borns who get brought into the magical world, but you have someone who wants you, don’t you?” He smiled.
Harry gathers up Nagini’s front half to hug to his chest as he watched the crowd before him take their seats. On the open floor sat a set of chairs and Tom led him to them. Taking the seat in the middle Harry relaxed as Arthur came to take the spot to his left and Tom to his right, creating a wall, warm shoulders touching his. It was once they had settled and the snake he’d been diligently petting found her place that he finally found himself take a breath.
Harry smiled into the pillow for the first time in years. Draco Malfoy. He replayed the memory till he fell asleep with the ray of hope and comfort it gave him.
The place was in order, sure, but Harry saw countless webs and dust piles strewn about the area like they had only made time to wipe off the galleons they were processing. Every one of these people was busy and it showed in how little they had time to do anything else. One of the shorter men even had a spider that had begun to weave a web on them.
The man before him was gaunt and exhausted looking as he leaned against the doorframe for breath, a familiar large snake slithering past into their home. Tom looked like he’d seen something beyond the supernatural or magical and Remus knew what it was.
“Petrificus Totalus!” The full body bind; He lunged forward with his wand, it swiped towards his slower opponent like a knife and sent out a strike of light. The Death Eater had only turned enough to see the spark coming before he hit the ground with his full weight. Every muscle was locked in place except vital functions and he breathed heavily on the floor as Tom stood above him.
Shapes and shadows were cast in deep blacks against every lumos and the sudden image of a midnight jungle left the impression that anything could be hiding among the foliage ready to hunt them. Except this was magic and Harry knew whatever lashed out was most likely to be the very plants surrounding the silhouette standing out at the edge of their vision, alone, outside the safety of their circle and every step away she took from them was another he held his breath as they watched.
The Golems had stopped and the fire fizzled out as the first door opened. It became nerve rackingly silent in the absent of their giant fists slamming down on the Auror’s barriers. A moment’s hesitation filled everyone, but perhaps Albus Dumbledore who had made the first steps into the next room.
“Oh, you mean your new cousin Harry. Fond of the rat, already are you? I’m surprised, for all the Malfoy’s failures I hadn’t thought one would actually shame their blood purity. I suppose I’ll been doing my sister a favor then.” The statement punctuated by a wall of knives appearing and flying at Draco.
“Don’t get you’re point. Muggle technology that requires your location to be visibly connected to a network is dangerous and illegal outside sanctioned crossroads or districts. One of the things you learn as a kid when you ask if you can get one. I’m still depressed my request for the Leaky Cauldron to get one was vetoed by the owner.”
“He was raised not to go to adults.” Sirius sighed and hung his head in defeat, how was he ever supposed to fix that?
“He started the fight, I showed up to him already having my insane aunt on her last legs. I threw a few spells, but they never connected. He used it as a chance to clock her though, so at least I wasn’t a complete deadweight. Rita Skeeter doesn’t know anything. She’s all talk. What happened was far more impressive than what she wrote, I saw a muggle beat the shit out of a serial killer.” Draco gave Hermione a meaningful look.
It was a new sight tonight. The first time Harry would see or touch everything there. A throbbing cock, two round balls tight with Draco’s need and now a small twitching hole he was meant to reach towards. The full view of it sent a gush of precum from his tip as he licked his lips. Draco was silent and switching between watching the other boy’s reaction and turning away to pretend nothing was happening.
Yet another earth-shattering moment for the muggle’s growing list. Having grown up surrounded by intolerance, every time the Weasleys had been kind and understanding it was almost too much. He had been so afraid that the people that wanted him wouldn’t be nearly as open as Draco had implied, and he had to reprimand himself mentally yet again for not having faith in the obvious. It was never going to be easy to trust, but it still felt like he was failing something every time he doubted them. The thing was, he was going to keep doing it, he was going to keep feeling guilt over it too. It would take a long time to change after a life of being made a certain way.
The fact that the Lord Malfoy would never be his old self again had always been apparent, but the new realization that it had been caused and not something he chose was a new painful wound to Severus. Still, he felt perhaps worse at the bit of vindication, of hopeful proof that he had not been played with and thrown away. The thought that Lucius had suffered at least as much as he had. Maybe, Severus thought to himself, he was not a very good man after all.
“Don’t take it out on him Severus.” Draco brought everyone back to his attention. Snape narrowed his eyes at his god nephew. He saw the regret in the young wizards face after he’d used his first name, good.
There were no visible ways further down then the dungeons, and no matter the spell cast or hand wandering over a surface, no one found anything that would help. It was an important part of the school, and it had been properly hidden to reflect that. Even if there had been portraits down here to point the way they wouldn’t have seen the construction of the path to even be able to guess where it would be.
Torches were crafted up from discarded branches and set aflame. The doorway they expected was nowhere along the overgrown walls far in and the small handful of Aurors and one teacher, Remus, looked tired and disheveled. It had probably been at least an hour of searching before they’d even found the entrance to the chambers and now there were no windows to look out of and check how far the moon had stretched out into the sky, or sun for that matter. Still, if they couldn’t find the way forward there was some small hope that Narcissa hadn’t either and it was just a matter of finding her restrained to one of these trees.
“What about at least?” Harry asked, a bit unsure at his try at humor. A pause between reply had him readying an apology for ruining the conversation again.
“Look up Harry, I’d hate for you to miss this. It being your first time I thought we’d walk you down DiagonAlley before going home for the day.” Harry glanced up and gasped, “You’ve had a time of it, I’m sure the air will do wonders before packing into the house, it’s snug with all the children but I promise we’ll have you nice and tucked in with them in no time.”
“It’s Christmas, get up lazy snake.” His muggle said cheerfully from where he’d thrown his head back through the door frame before disappearing out of sight again.
It was an impulsive reply. He had already decided with those words he’d meet this lowly muggle again. It wasn’t about being better either, it was about being the best, Harry’s best. He’d never been looked up to like that before, if he kept coming back he’d be needed. He had followers but no one like this and it fed a kind of hunger Draco never knew he had.
“They really are much better now; I think you’d do well to reevaluate things with them some time. Thank you for putting up with the formalities, if the pensive memory is not enough in court for any reason you may be called on.”
“You are going to tell me where your friend went.” Tom needed the other one. Had to catch the one with memories of Cotton to collaborate his accusation. Without that probable cause his case against Dolores couldn’t even be properly investigated without being roadblocked. The bureaucratic tape was too complicated and unevenly laid to give him any certain results if he didn’t start with proof from the beginning. The same reason why she had managed her position for so long.
“Necklace?” Harry tried to groan out and she reached for his neck to fish out what looked like a silver chain with a chunk of sea glass hanging from it.
“Another Hatchling?” She almost purred. “I heard of a Hatchling that came through while we where out, will I get to warm it?”
“I didn’t want to deal with both my stupid muggle cousin and you simpletons.” Draco snapped and reeled back the next moment, checking Harry’s expression before starting again. “I’m not going to hide from you anymore, I was just busy and now it’s taken care of so come off it.” He tried to close the case.
“I’m not playing some stupid game with you. I get enough of that with the Gryffindor idiots.” Severus bit out.
The member smeared against Draco’s stomach again, literally weeping for attention Harry fought not to give as he felt himself seize up painfully with his own arousal. Soon he’d thrown off his own pants and pressed back down into warm flesh, the wet of their cocks mixing and coating their aching need. Harry fumbled for the glass bottle they’d gotten for tonight and found himself losing more of the liquid than he caught as he poured it from an odd angle. Draco forced him up to do it and looked over at the wet puddle on the bed next to them.
“We are required to ask for your testimony in this hearing in order to take your Will into consideration when we deliberate. If there is anything you would like to state let it be known to the court now.”
“One more time Draco, are you ready? I’m going to show you how much I love you.” He said, resting his forehead against Draco’s neck. Only looking up once he heard a gentle voice.
The shadow of the Auror cast itself over them then, it felt off instantly, the torchlight should have been between them, but it was behind the man too. They whipped around in time to see his face, Roody didn’t look right, his face lax and clouded. The torch threw itself to the ground with a slender hand slipping into nothingness.
“Yes sir.” Dobby hopped in place and bolted for the door to the hall. He didn’t know the human way, but he’d seen Lacy whenever she used the service paths. Knew which turns to make from all the other times she’d had a parcel. He ran and opened the nearest wall panel and turned into the bare wood innerworkings of the manor, the young master in tow.
Even with the chance to visit every Hogsmeade and off day to be with his husband, being mostly away like this was harder to do each year. Maybe he needed to look into the idea of a housing situation in Hogsmeade for Sirius during the year so that he could live with him off the grounds? They had been running circles around the idea for the past couple of years he’d been employed and it seemed like life was dragging on with or without their plans.
Harry had effectively drooled out of his mouth several times as he tried and failed to eat everything he was handed. Roody was trying to help him pace himself but got admittedly distracted in his story telling. A few Aurors and a secretary had tuned in and added bits as Harry sunk into his seat by the duo’s work space. He had cried spontaneously a few times, laughed hysterically and panicked at least once that he was messing up his chance because he wasn’t “good enough”. He’d never felt more self conscious, which was an accomplishment.
“You are not to associate with that muggle again! It has already lost me support in the polls with our side, if this continues, we risk losing my position! Do you want that stupid boy? This is for your own good, do you understand?”
Harry fumbled against the pounds of muscle Nagini had tangled him in before he walked forward. All eyes stared down at him through the low flickering candlelight that edged the walls. An almost iridescent spotlight paling Harry’s skin to white as the people he looked out at were blinded from his sight to nothing more than shadow figures.
Harry’s labored breaths grew a bit deeper as his lungs slowly release their seized muscles. Laying across the living room’s worn sofa, he watched passively as the others took seats in the adjacent armchairs. Without his glasses he was practically blind and he let his unfocused eyes lull him half-asleep as he watched the soft shapes settle.
Gellert breathed in deeply as if to smell the air, it was predatory, a fierce look over taking his features by the second as Harry began to move to the exit. Even the wisp who had led him here was now pulling away with great effort in attempt to take Harry away from the wizard in front of them. Golden eyes locked with his, the pupils flexing inside the ring of color, shaking in confined rage. He had never seen anyone look like that, not even Vernon.
“Oh, that is good as a magical tool actually. It’s formed naturally over twenty to forty years so it has the elemental property of water and retains renewal powers that any other object may require a rune to possess. We can enhance it however.” Draco started to ramble on about the kinds of things they could make as Harry compared him to Hermione in his head.
Slick liquid dripped onto Draco’s inner thigh and he jumped. A finger swiftly finding his hole again, coated with lube to roll over and fondle the delicate entrance as he circled the rim. The breach of sliding into Draco was maddeningly slow now that Harry was fully hard and the struggle to stay paced was ruined by Draco’s own rush to fuck the problems from his own head. Harry finally relented once he’d found himself knuckle deep, flexing his finger around inside to soak the walls and meet Draco’s fervor.
They left with Harry bright eyed, he had been staring at Draco a little too intensely than strictly necessary, but neither mentioned it. Draco had stuffed his reddened hands in his pockets to hide it, thank god nothing had appeared on his face that he could feel or he would have to explain himself. They couldn’t have gotten home sooner, as Draco excused himself to go to his guest room and hide. Harry watched him leave in concern, but let him disappear.
A full grid of sand and shells later and they had a variety of water based, weak ingredients. The earth, brine and rock components of the sand being the prime amongst the list.
A death eater ran down the hall with the letter in hand, a hesitant excitement at news they could use. Bellatrix had been plotting the executions she would be handing out at the next attack this year when he came before her, managing not to undo her exceptional mood. She tore the envelope swiftly and one handed, flicked the parchment open to read it.
“Sorry about that.” He spoke softly till that one settled down as well, accepting a few handfuls of wet dirt patted atop its lap. After being satisfied with tucking the plant in the muggle was off again, to do what, Rita was about to find out.
Tom sat on the headmaster’s desk in his private office, located at the top of the highest spire of Hogwarts. He smiled up to the portraits lining the alcove above him, circling the office, providing help to the next one to caretake this place. It had always been a sweet thought, a way that the headmasters previously could continue to look over everyone and his gaze stopped on Dippet. The sterner man had always felt a bit distant to him in his own years at the school, back when Albus was a younger if not graying man teaching defense. He was looking more and more like one of these portraits and it made his stomach clench painfully.
Taking the floo over Kreacher fawned over him like always before telling Sirius he was there. The shaggy man was a colorful contrast to the neat and tidy gentleman, Lupin, who followed in after.
Rita was shifted into her small beetle form clutching onto Tom’s coat when it happened. She had just been looking for the right moment to photograph when he’d gone to Grimmauld place. Her head was spinning with all the possibilities as she listened to the group of wizards and one young muggle as they set off for Hogwarts. Her story was growing even bigger by the minute and she held on for dear life as her ride took them through the floo.
Draco didn’t talk about what he saw. Not yet. Harry didn’t push when his lover dragged him to the bed instead and started stripping the both of them. He let himself be thrown under the blankets and a warm body crawled in after to lay flush against him as much as possible.
Mrs. Weasley had been dumbfounded when she’d looked out her window to see her two young boys hand feeding her infestation. Lawn Nome’s had always been a personal nightmare for her, the humanoid beings never once listening to reason as she saw it, but Arthur just told her to let it be this once for Harry. Her threat that he would be the one to do the job later only made the man laugh like always, the sounds of “yes dear” trailing behind him as he fled.
It had been his only defense against Narcissa, each piece absorbing or reflecting some bit of damage. It had still been excruciating, but he had been okay, something his opponent hadn’t counted on when he had sprung to action. He was sure that last spell wouldn’t have gone over well.
So if it wasn't clear we have a Tom/Albus ship going on in here that has it's own story going on I'm hoping to make the catalyst of the big final arc of our story and this is me trying to drop the hints before you're just thrown suddenly into a wall of new information. I'm hoping that this makes it a little more organic and creates some anticipation for all the things this could mean. I had to keep rewriting a timeline up in my notes to make sense out of how old everyone was and how much original canon I wanted to build off of as a base. I think it's turning out okay, but any feedback is always appreciated, I like to know how everyone is feeling. Love you all so much and thank you for reading.
“I want to leave.” He tried to enunciate through his tears as best he could and Narcissa relaxed minutely.
Harry had taken too long, looked over at the tv a bit in curiosity and the scolding was here. They never wanted him around unless it was to throw him about in one way or another and he should have grabbed his food and ran for the cupboard like they wanted but sometimes he missed the timing.
“Hey,” Harry pulled at Draco’s coat before he could follow after Snape to the dungeons for the night. “will you stay up with me a little?”
“Aurors, set perimeter around the group.” Tom barked out his orders as the robed figures moved into position. “Albus, on your word.” He said formally with shoulders squared.
Before long the troop was together and Moody was still roasting the two brats that had been keeping up the banter and by extension the groups spirits.
The sound of footsteps caused Harry to tense, this was a public park, but it was also the only place he could be alone. After a moment he steeled himself and looked up. A boy more gorgeous than any he’d ever seen was standing there, the look on his face was the same one he saw every day. White gold hair glinted in the lamplight in an ethereal glow and the pale skin looked like porcelain. The most striking though were those eyes, silver and shining like a predator.
“Alright then.” He exhaled in a puff of self-made fog as he started to wade through the environment.
“Mr. Riddle.” Remus said cautiously as he eyed the man. His hand had subtly grabbed onto Sirius, worried in part for what his husband might be tempted to do given the circumstances.
“Yes, thank you for helping me. The wisp was great, they knew just what I needed.” He flushed at the accusatory glares he got from his worried family.
“The way you were acting was not right Harry.” Draco pushed before giving in to the uncomprehending look he was getting. “Promise me you’ll tell me if it happens again.”
“Professor.” She said coyly as she draped herself on the chair opposite Tom’s desk after she had strolled in. It was technically the teachers desk he was using to grade papers while they were busy.
I would like to give a proper spotlight to this and I'm not sure how well I'll do, at the same time this is a key feature of Harry in this story and it needs to grow more and the only way to do that is by having him interact with these groups and have them developed. The gap between human and magical beings must be questioned, and the symbolism of a muggle being the one to extend a hand and how that allows the reader to project onto him is something I'm suddenly really excited to think about. I'd been wondering how to start the 16th chapter up to this moment and typing this out is actually helping to give me new motivation.
Harry’s hands contorting him into position, in that park they met in. His tears still falling as something entirely different happened in place of their talk.
“Insolent pup.” She cursed under her breathe,” if you see Bellatrix, do tell her to send the house elf home. It is incredibly unseemly watching those two dullards try to sweep.” Walburga relented indignantly.
“—What if… What if I said I wanted something you might not want to give? Do you think you could forgive me? Or hate me?” Harry asked to the open expanse of beach.
Draco returned the looks of annoyance as he looked back, on all the back and forth he’d been struggling with lately. “I’m bad at this.”
“No, wait!” Harry was pushing him away despite the confused look he got. Then he felt Sirius pulled away bodily, the older man gasping at the sudden attack.
“Pfft, that’s what, two months from now? Two and a half? The lovey Gryffindors really got to you, huh.” Draco smirked.
He came to a large study with a flaming hearth. A wall of unidentifiable and messy items on one side and a corner full of fabric scraps lit up another section as he swept his gaze over everything. His eyes caught on the figure fumbling about to straighten a tray of cakes and tea. The woman looked normal in all respects. Plump and freckled with blonde locks reaching the floor even as she stood. Her dress was tied up in place for work and not relaxation, white puffs of bloomers peeking out where the trim of her skirt was hiked up.
“I want to be with you.” He relented finally and he could feel the body around him slouch in relief.
“I did it.” Harry burst out. Eyes shot over to him, gray and black making it hard for him to tell where to look. “I wanted to go to the beach, he was just trying to use it as a way to tech me more so I’d be good for our finals this week.”
“How far down?” Harry walked over to them from where he and his three appointed and overprotective guardians had finished their sweep of the hall. “It goes farther than the dungeons?”
Harry felt his body give out as he slumped down into bed. Returning back with a face full of fresh bruises got him yelled at.
It was an unusual case to say the least. The little men in their tailored high point hats, half burrowed in the chewed-up mounds of grass. Harry watched at first as the poor, if not exceedingly grumpy things were pushed from the Weasley’s land. They seemed to spit and growl indiscernible profanities from between gnarled fangs.
He watched the blue swirl of essence inside the bottle as it danced around. There was something “other” about it. Albus’ youth had been something incredible to witness separate from his body when they had recovered it, but that had been a piece of him. This felt like he was looking at his whole self, like his eyes were the things separate and looking at himself from a distance, like he’d been piloting his body from far off until now.
The minister was pasty white by the end of his lecture. Draco hoped he wouldn’t have to prove that last part, father helping a muggle boy that would be the day, luckily no one outside the death eaters would understand to question it.
Now it was just time to tell his cousin Sirius he was adopting. The investigation would be fast once they saw how Harry lived, it wouldn’t be hard to pass judgment. This was the best place to send Harry, he couldn’t bring him to the manor or hide him in the dorms after all. Sirius would be happy to be saving the life of a boy like him and his husband.
“Family!” He chimed back and Draco choked on his words, the obvious blush and demoralized look had Sirius howling in laughter.
“Hitler said stuff like that too. It all comes down to who you choose to be. Are you someone looking for a leader to give you permission to hurt others or do you really think you’re better? The latter I can forgive for hurting me if you apologize. The other is the kind that doesn’t stop until one or both of you are dead.”
A snap like a firecracker went off somewhere down a neighborhood road. No one would think anything of it, just another kid playing around after dark with friends.
“Sorry, I just can’t stop. You didn’t have to.” Harry had tried taking deeper breaths. It was clear Draco’s quick actions had been a good call.
“Are you sure that this is safe?” He asked the blonde he let drag him through the broken front door. The energy like Grimmauld place permeated the crisp air inside. The wind whipping through one hole to the next where plaster or wood had worn away only slightly letting out a gentle hum.
Harry woke up to a tight hug that threatened his morning bladder and he struggled half-awake to fight Draco’s clinging arms off so he could make a run for the bathroom. The grip around his middle tightened in protest and he squawked in distress. Hedwig, who he’d put with the house owl had been put in his room as a “baby sitter” in compromise of letting the two stay together in the same bed, ruffled her feathers in alarm and squawked back.
It was as her polished nails worked through the stack that she found a name she remembered. Remus Lupin, the disgusting creature she had so long ago failed to throw out of Hogwarts, but as she went to tear up the paper its words caught her eye. An adoption form.
The heel of his hand presses to his temple. He sits up, snow dusting his jacket. “This isn’t right.”
Draco and Potter crash into the wall of the corridor, where clean air fills their lungs. The Slytherin falls off the broom, landing face down on the ground, coughing, and retching. Potter sits up, panting, his face streaked with soot.
“I’m not pure of heart,” Harry mutters, but Draco doesn’t reply. He’s listening with his eyes closed.
“Right?” Draco was grateful for the sudden glimpse into Harry’s life - far from the intimidatingly hot porn star, the real Harry seemed kind and gentle. The exact kind of lover Draco was looking for. “You have any kids, Draco?”
Impatient, Draco took a quick sip. “Well, if you don’t know, who - oh,” He interrupted himself as he tasted the “tea,” which seemed more like a slightly syrupy concoction, sugary, cinnamony, and chocolatey all at once. “This is very good, what is it?” He asked, his sweet tooth making him lose his train of thought for a moment.
“Sure, go ahead,” Lee said casually, “And I’ll fetch George in a jiffy.” He jumped suddenly in the air and disappeared without a sound.
His headspace is darkening. Draco’s silver eyes are farther and farther away. A sob escapes Harry’s throat; his lungs are aching, heart pumping hard.
Parents in robes and Muggle clothes wandered around Platform Nine-And-Three-Quarters, greeting the students that spilled from the Hogwarts Express. Clouds of steam puffed overhead, and the enormous locomotive engine ticked as it cooled.
To Draco’s surprise, Dao nodded. He wished he could read her face, but any human tremble had been hidden away.
The patient’s eyes flutter, unseeing, and Padma tugs away the silken, scarlet fabric of his pajamas, pressing the needle into his arm. Harry’s breath catches - then he sinks back into dreams, deeper than before.
Before Ginny could ask any more questions, Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. Unlike her daughter, Molly seemed upbeat – as upbeat as a mother could be after her son's funeral. Harry could tell she was relieved that the war was over, at least, and the rest of her children were going to be safe and sound for a long time.
“Professor Dahlia,” Hermione said, getting straight to the point. “I couldn’t help but notice you have a gay pride flag, and I am researching LGBT history for an essay. Are you a lesbian?”
“Ooh, very helpful,” Max said sarcastically, bobbing his head. “Well, don’t stop there. What does she look like?”
“Thanks,” Justin says, and balances the cup on the box as he emerges into the dead of night once more. Tiny snowflakes fall in slow motion in the light of the streetlamps. Justin pauses to watch them, piling steadily on the sidewalks and on nearby cars, making ghosts of their machinery. Justin carefully sips his burning hot coffee, hesitant to start walking back.
“I’m glad it comes off that way. Sorry for bothering you like this.” A quick change of topic, a rabbit hopping from one bush to another. “I glimpsed you earlier, but also…” Draco shakes his head, thinking, and Harry glimpses the platinum blond of his roots. He’s never met anyone with a natural hair color like that. “I could have sworn I’ve met you, before today.” He snaps his fingers, leather on leather. “Ah! Do you go to The Raven and the Mushroom? On Pitch Avenue?”
“I’ll get the eucalyptus and fairy tears from the stores,” Draco stated, “And you can chop up the licorice root.”
“What happened, exactly?” Luna takes a seat on the nearby armchair, her dress fluttering as she crosses her legs. Padma watches the motion of the light, floral fabric, possessed by the whimsicality that would spur a girl to wear summer clothes in February.
Three wizards dressed in charcoal gray stepped forward to meet them; Draco was unsurprised to not count Henderson Melocotones among their number. Their apparent leader, a woman whose astonishing mass of red curls was tied back, raised her wand against them.
Harry edged over to Draco, standing by himself as usual. “Hey,” Harry greeted casually, “This looks fun.”
“So, what have you been up to?” Hermione asked smoothly, taking over Draco’s role as the poised converser.
“Ah. Hey, did you see anything moving near your trunk?” Ron asked. A few inches away, Harry felt Draco shift slightly. He prayed the light coming through the small gap wasn’t enough to reveal the person-shaped impression on the bed.
“I don’t reckon there are many gay or bisexual blokes around here,” Harry remarked, wincing as numbness seized his bare calves.
“If we touch his stuff and put it back, he won’t mind,” Pansy decides, and promptly turns herself to land on the wooden floor. Her boots clomp as she strides to the shelf and begins flipping through the music. “Old, old, boring, old – ew, pop – derivative, boring, old…aha!” Pansy exclaims triumphantly, sliding out a white vinyl sleeve, stenciled with a horse. “That’s the ticket. Perhaps Harry’s music taste isn’t as godawful as I thought.”
“I try to keep an open mind,” Ron shrugged. The two of them exchanged a loving look that made Harry slightly uncomfortable. “Let’s get back to it. Go on, Harry. Might as well get your defeat over with.”
As he moved to take it, Draco let his eyes wander about the room, noting which of his expectations about Harry Potter’s office had been met, and which had been flipped on their head. The room was spacious, yet its effects gave it a cozy feel; the weathered walnut desk was cluttered with a couple photographs, colored sticky notes, and lined-up fountain pens. Behind the desk hung a bulletin board, covered with push pins and more sticky notes, and a painting of wildflowers that seemed the least pretentious of all the artwork Draco had seen in corporate offices. Next to a crackling fireplace stood a small table laden with a box of cigars, a single lit candle, a bottle of whiskey, and a few crystal glasses.
Rabbit only shook their head, Draco’s features blurred in the flowing water. “I’m not going to stand here and tell you my life story, Harry Potter. Go and live yours instead. Watch the memory. It will help you understand.”
Harry and Draco shot jinxes at their opponent, but they easily blocked it with a wordless Shield Charm - more than wordless, Draco realized. They weren’t using a wand.
“Final score: Two hundred twenty to sixty, Gryffindor!” Shouted the Ravenclaw commentator over the din. “A well-fought match to be sure. That brings Gryffindor in the lead for the Quidditch Cup, with Slytherin in second…”
Draco smirked and wordlessly raised his glass to the Gryffindor in reply. Just then, a group of eccentric figures wandered onto the dais, dressed in ripped robes and elaborate makeup, carrying electric guitars, parts of a drum set, amps, and oddly enough, a few jazz instruments.
“Well, ours obviously isn’t, Potter,” Draco amended. He rested his hand briefly on his companion’s shoulder in a gesture of affection, and the way he spoke Harry’s surname made it sound like an endearment.
. The wand movement doesn’t matter too much, but I find flicking works the best. Say it without wands first.”
"I wish you'd talk to me a bit," Harry sighed. He waited for a few more moments. The door suddenly opened, and Harry jumped back from it.
Pansy’s smile widened cruelly. “Stupid enough to get caught, huh?” Draco’s jaw clenched, and he looked down at the table. “And I hear you’re being shipped off, too, the second you change out of your graduation robes.”
Their voices, muted and calm, wake Harry. He’s dimly aware of the flush crept up his neck, the leftover taste of Hermione’s famous treacle tart, the wind reminding Ashfell of autumn against the windowpane. And there’s a weight, warm and familiar, in his lap.
Narcissa inclined her head. “That’s a conversation for another day, as well. For now, you’d better say hello to your father.”
“Head to Weasley’s,” Molly called; their group was already starting to be pushed apart by the multitude. “We’ll meet George there.”
The February cold presses the sides of the car, making Harry shiver; he left without a coat. Draco shudders violently, his coat draped over his arm in his hurry. “Leave me alone,” He spits angrily.
This fight, Harry quickly realized, would be markedly different from two-on-one sparring in a classroom - the enemies’ wandless casting was slower, but the gusts and crackles of magic without knowing what came next were hard to block. Harry found himself using one Shield Charm after another, managing only to get a few spells in edgewise, but the two wizards blocked for each other. The hiss and pops of magic ground loudly against Harry's ears. He gritted his teeth and swiftly dropped to his knees as another Stunning Spell whistled inches over his head and shot a thunderbolt at one wizard - it hit him square in the chest, and he collapsed to the dirt.
“Oh, no. I don’t study for non-practical tests,” Luna said airily, “Especially if they’re multiple choice. I’m a good guesser.” She beamed.
make it a habit,” He says, and before Harry can think of a proper reply, adds, “Take a left, just up here.”
Mrs. Weasley came briskly from the front door, positively beaming at the sight of them. She embraced Harry, Hermione, Luna, and her own children - “Mum!” Ron protested - before stopping at Draco. Her expression became guarded, and Harry looked between his friend and Molly Weasley apprehensively, recalling that she had killed his aunt less than a year ago.
“I cannot believe you’re making fun of my vulnerabilities, Potter,” Draco said, thumping his shoulder, but he was smiling.
“A what?” Joey asked as Draco turned as white as snow. Both he and Harry were staring at Dahlia in horror.
Stifling warmth, born of magic and lukewarm sweat, filled the Room of Requirement’s vaulted ceilings and stone walls. Spells flew in multicolored sparks, occasionally accompanied by pops, bangs, and light vapors. On either side, two young men panted, their sleeves rolled up in battle, and wands raised.
“Hey,” Harry greeted softly as he approached. Ginny looked up in surprise. Her eyes were puffy. The two other Ravenclaws eyed him warily but returned to their breakfast when Ginny jerked her head, wordlessly inviting him to sit. “You all right?”
Around one in the morning, Harry placed his empty bottle back in its cardboard box of origin and stood up. “I’m going to bed. Goodnight, everyone. Have a nice rest of your holiday, Luna, if I don’t see you again.”
is radical?” Dao spat, stepping back as if Dahlia had insulted her. “The fire-wielders who killed your family -
Draco flushed, and Harry smirking, dropping his hand, not giving a single damn about the students that stared as he strolled off.
Padma gave an exaggerated sigh, standing from the table while wiping at her eyes. “You’re impossible,” She declared and turned to leave.
"Now, today's potion comes to us thanks to your older brother, Weasley," Professor Slughorn said, nodding at Ron, who looked up in surprise. "Nicknamed 'Twilight Moonbeams,' the potion is meant to cause infatuation from the potion drinker to the giver. Though it may seem like a silly, simple concoction, I've talked with Mr. Weasley about the intricacies of this surprisingly complex potion. I thought it might be fun for us to reproduce it. He gave me the secret ingredient-" Slughorn held up a glass jar filled with white dust, "But not its name. A pinch of this at the end of the brewing should suffice. As for the other ingredients, five leaves of belladonna, two milliliters Angolan caterpillar froth to reverse its poison…"
- pulled back above the trees as a silvery stag leaped around them. Next to Harry, he heard Joey cast the same spell with her retrieved wand, and a spotted canine animal with spoonlike ears bounded to join the stag, nipping playfully at its heels. A gorgeous, moon-colored tiger joined the mix. Harry’s heart soared; had Draco finally unlocked his Patronus? Then he remembered who had a tiger Patronus.
“Everyone has to eat. They might eat one more than the other but that doesn’t mean they aren’t doing what any other being does. Those crops are food, you’re just in the way sometimes.” He teased. “I don’t know enough about it, but maybe if you pile the weeds and things you throw out or don’t need, they’ll just take it without making holes.” Maybe once they aren’t so angry with you throwing them all the time, they’ll even talk to you.”
“Harry.” Albus smiled with a twinkle in his eye that was now unmistakable. “I was told you did something rather dangerous and that more detention may be in order.” He teased as he let the two boys soak in the new body he presented. Oh, this was going to be fun, he thought as he imagined all the ways he would play with the staff and students when they got back.
“It has to be down there.” He nodded to it and saw the agreement on the others faces before attempting to guide the vines out of the way for them. “Roody, can you go get the others for us.” Harry turned his head around to look at the man who took his task to heart immediately.
“Yes, go on.” Albus urged, he was getting that mad glint in his eye again suddenly and it cut through the tension of the dark space.
“It’s okay now. Draco promised, and it’s okay now. Doesn’t matter if she doesn’t like me. They like me. They really do, and Draco and Arthur said too, and Ron said we’re friends. It’s okay.” He murmured the words till they melded into a mantra that drove him to sleep.
Ms. Dolores Umbridge had subsequently found herself in her usual seat, enchanted pen and typewriter that would require signatures after the hearing were scratching away at each letter recorded. One would go to the judges and minister; the extra was for her private records. The personal information of the Dursley’s was the first thing she’d be sending off at break. The muggles themselves were of little import, just a means, a means her people would take pleasure in using.
“To be blunt, this is the absolute last thing I thought I was committing to when I was imagining how we were going to hang out or even be friends really.”
“Can’t wait for more.” Harry moaned past a spike of dull pain that played to the rhythm of his heart on his flesh before a new hand came down to spread a cold substance over it. He yelped in surprise despite the instant relief.
Tom sighed in relief as he signed the final review of the case before the hearing. Ruddy having provided him with his and his partners memories and those recorded by the Dursley family. It had been a clean-cut case except for the matter of placement. Even then, it was mostly the problem that the Pink menace, Dolores Umbridge, and her position as undersecretary to the minister had continued to attempt her dismantling of safety measures and rights for sentient beings.
“Then what is going on with you huh?” Harry crouched down below the vines of moon drops to reach Draco.
this ones a bit shorter because I'm back to holding myself to the minimum "write one page a day" commitment I made myself. personal philosophy, when it gets too hard to keep going on a story don't stop, just scene transition even if it doesn't have to be one, sometimes all you need is a big dotted line separating to the next thought to separate yourself from where your brain is internally stuttering on the ideas you have. When that isn't enough you get a small goal like one page done and go back the next day to add another small bit till it piles up. It makes everything a victory even when it makes you skip over ideas or details you maybe wanted, the point is to keep going.
“You’re mother hening Ron, he’ll be fine. Besides it’s one of the most memorable first moments you get coming to the magical world, it’s a few years late, but he still gets to do it and I’m glad for him.” She turned to Harry now, “I just know you’ll love it, because I did. If Ron hasn’t told you I’m muggle-born so I’m coming from the same place as you.”
“Fuck Draco.” He breathed, startling when Draco suddenly shrieked and bit into his hand to stop the sound, back arching off the bed.
“Harry?” He asked weakly through the panting that had begun to grow heavy between them as Harry had continued to work hickeys into his neck. He removed his mouth with a smacking sound, a shiver raking through Draco at the exposed wet skin.
Now he was sitting and interviewing one of the last witnesses that had seen one of his marks the day before, Severus Snape, friend of the family. If you could call him that. It had always seemed complicated to Tom honestly.
Severus was lost to the past back in his armchair, fiddling with the seams on the arms where his hands rested over the edges. He was down to his shirt and black dress pants he never wore in school when he had to work with the labs, his usual garb of a formfitting long robe was a safety measure not a simple fashion. The white of his dress shirt made his skin look even paler and the fireplace unlit left him in shadows.
“I guess,” Draco frowned, stood up, and resolutely kicked at a pile of snow. “Funny how people see the new year as a new beginning,” He muttered. “But nothing ever changes.”
Harry knew Draco almost as well as he knew himself, knew what made him smile, knew how his face lit up at home or in the potions classroom, stirring up some bizarre concoction for someone else to take to the battlefield. Harry knew, too, what made him cry - the Dark Mark, the nightmares of running down a long Hogwarts corridor that slowly filled with dust and bodies. The adrenaline and danger of being an Auror reminded Harry of the war, but it gave him purpose, a reason to keep fighting for those who stood beside him and those who’d already fallen. But the feeling of chasing and being chased did Draco no favors. It only put him back in that corridor, sprinting for his life with no light, no way out. Harry should have realized that sooner.
“I’m glad to see such enthusiastic players and a great number at that. Of course, that means it’ll be harder than ever to pick our team. If you’re willing to work hard and put in the hours…”
Harry hesitated. Wasn’t she right, at least partially? He was a decent fighter but wasn’t great at school. With Ron and Hermione, he felt invincible - they’d saved his life more times than he could count, but what could he do without them? Become a just-above-average Auror and fade away into the history books? It’s not like he had a whole lot of charisma or intelligence…
” He shouted, and the Stunning Spell promptly ricocheted off the stone wall on the other side of the classroom. The whole class ducked on instinct except for Owen, who was bewildered from having his time perception change; anticipating this, Professor Dahlia neutralized the spell with a quick Shielding Charm.
“What do you mean, he’s not my ‘real’ boyfriend?” Harry hissed, punctuating the question with fierce air quotes. Her tone, bordering on patronizing, made Harry’s fists clench. What made her the expert on their relationship? She hadn’t seen Harry remove Draco’s Dark Mark. She hadn’t been in the bathroom the first time Harry held Draco in his arms. She hadn’t seen Draco grip his hand as if holding a lifeline. “I know him a hell of a lot better than you two do!”
Blooming jasmine flowers overcame the sickening scent of copper and salt, and as Joey removed the vial from her face, she was pleased to see that the effect lingered. “Thanks,” She said and gave the potion back to Draco.
He looked surprised to be addressed directly. The class all turned to look at him, half of them judgmental, half curious. Harry watched Draco’s pale throat move with a nervous swallow, his silver eyes wandering in thought. “I…don’t have much else to say. I agree with you, I suppose.”
The sweet nothings fall from her mouth like nectar, and Padma feels caught in it, the stickiness, the web from an enchanting spider.
“I always ask for them,” Harry told him. He set down the packet he was holding and shuffled through the pages of the bios, each embellished with the pink and black logo of MasoGirlsXXX, the porn studio Draco’s father had founded. “The art is only as good as the actresses, right?”
This time, Draco knew it had worked, because Harry, Ron, and Hermione all gasped simultaneously. He opened his eyes, just in time to spot the silvery substance spiraling from his wand, along with some sort of shape. It was small, but definitely an animal, with wings, or horns, something indiscernible, but
Joey let out a short, sardonic laugh. “Well, that’s…” She stopped, pressing her fingers to her lips as if about to be sick.
, and Pansy’s right, I d-do belong in Azkaban, and I could be an Auror for fifty years, and it wouldn’t matter, I’m just as bad as the others-”
Footsteps crunching on the gravelly sand made Harry look up and over his shoulder. Hermione and Ron, wearing Muggle clothes for the weekend, held each other’s hands as they approached. Their faces wore carefree, peaceful expressions. Harry wondered how long that would last.
As the trio continued to converse, Harry noticed how alike his partners were. Joey had obviously donned a façade of cold indifference to talk to them, just like Draco did with any stranger. Harry could only hope that, in time, he could break through her hard exterior. It would make working together a hell of a lot easier.
A couple Gryffindors gave Seamus frustrated looks, but most of the class sighed with relief that they hadn’t all been killed.
It began to rain shortly after they’d both gone to bed. Any sliver of moonlight that made it through the clouds lined the drops sliding down the window, creating silver stripes against the glass. Usually, Harry and Draco would stay up to watch thunderstorms, jumping at every magnificent lilac web that wove itself through the black. But Draco was disinterested, or perhaps already asleep - Harry couldn’t see his face, couldn’t hear his breath through the storm’s cacophony, but could only watch the rise and fall of his hunched shadow before exhaustion took over.
“How do you like it, honey?” The words, hot against Draco’s ear, came as a surprise. He could hardly think of an answer, his mind clouded with lust as Harry slid his palm over Draco’s tented pants, teasingly taking him in hand.
“I can’t stay,” Joey said apologetically. “It all looks delicious, Molly.” Mashed potatoes, caramelized onions, blanched greens, beef Wellington, roasted peppers, cucumber salad, even jollof rice. She was glad to see Mrs. Weasley had used her recipe. “I’m afraid Harry and I have work to do.”
The pale green velvet box, holding the silver clasp, disappears into the bag. A makeup palette opened only once. A mug painted with their caricatures. A roaring dragon handmade from copper wire.
Only Luna Lovegood seemed entirely unaffected by the stress her fellow housemates were under, and her own hands were empty as she walked, humming, from breakfast.
Joey suspected the latter. She touched her forearm, where her holster and wand were strapped, hidden with a concealment charm. Faraday had informed them that Thailand was much more accepting of magic, but it wouldn’t do to draw attention to themselves.
“That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.” It’s the closest Justin has gotten to being angry tonight so far, but he rarely gets angry. His hazel glare above the monitor isn’t very threatening.
“It’s okay,” Draco said gently. “You don’t have to talk about them if you don’t want to. We understand; Merlin, you could fill a book with the family issues Harry and I have.”
Luna screams, shattering the spell of a silent winter. She screams with the frustration of lost knowledge, with anger at herself, with fear of the pain the past held.
“I might have asked a while ago,” Luna says with a shrug, “I don’t remember too well. Why, do you get bored of telling the same story over and over again?” The corners of her lips curl teasingly.
“Resurrecting Corpse Squashes,” Harry explained as Ron rubbed his chest fervently as if forcing his heartbeat to slow down. “Sprang up unexpectedly just yesterday, so Professor Sprout had us replant them. They’re the weirdest-”
That question and others tumbled around in his mind for a long time that night. To distract himself, Harry strained his ears against the dull roar of the rained-upon lake for a creak of the floorboards, a sigh, anything that would signal Draco’s return. But he never did, and Harry fell into a brief, fitful slumber, dreading the next morning.
Without his glasses, Harry sees Draco as a blur, only able to focus on one feature at a time. His eyes, constant as an overcast sky. His lips, swollen and parted. The marks blooming like red and purple blossoms on his neck.
Harry looked away quickly, his face warming. He set his glasses on the nightstand, climbed into bed, and tucked his wand beneath his pillow. But after a few minutes of tossing and turning, Harry found that the heat had seeped throughout his body, blood rushing between his legs. Though he’d pushed the thought of Draco’s half-naked figure from his mind, his body had not forgotten.
Harry, on the other hand, loved children. In sixth year, he’d allowed himself small fantasies of him and Ginny in a cottage far from London’s busy streets, with a few kids in mixtures of red hair, black hair, brown eyes, green eyes. The dream had died when they’d broken up, of course, and Harry hadn’t yet managed to rekindle it, especially with the impossibility of him and Draco bearing children. But as he watched Teddy match Draco’s platinum blond hair along with the eyes of emerald, Harry couldn’t help but wonder…
“I do, but that’s not why I fell in love with her,” Justin insists. “And-and not to mention,” He adds, stammering with disbelief, “Your ‘boyfriend,’ or whatever, was getting his damn memory erased! Kind of seems like taking advantage of a guy in a vulnerable position.”
Pearly tears soaked into black robes as Draco buried his face into the other young man’s shoulder, but Harry didn’t mind. They stayed like that for a long time, long enough for the drops of water on the floor to evaporate.
Harry nodded, a little taken aback. Professor Dahlia chuckled at her student’s apprehension. “I didn’t mean to scare you. Those thirteen years I spent with my colleagues in the International Crimes division were some of the most rewarding years in my life. But it takes moral fiber, a willingness to learn, and knowing when sacrifice is necessary to handle it. Do you understand?”
“Yes,” He said gratefully, joining them. Harry hesitated for some reason, emerald eyes narrowing at the scene, but he decided to sit with them, as well.
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” Ron roars. But he and Hermione take Goyle’s limp body from Draco’s grasp, dragging him onto their broom. Potter swerves back to Draco and pulls him onto his own broomstick.
The Slytherin pulled Harry close and whispered swiftly into his ear. “I know how to counter Dark Magic, Potter. I’ll stay concealed in case they make you give up your wand.” Without waiting for a reply, Draco gently but forcefully removed the Invisibility Cloak from Harry’s grip and draped it over himself.
Joey was already there, dressed in a plain white blouse and jeans, the edge of her bandages poking out from her collar and short sleeves. Her legs were crossed, and she had been leaning back, but when Harry and Draco entered the room, she stood immediately.
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter! Drama and descriptions are one of my favorite aspects about writing.
Draco and Harry exchanged a knowing look - they had both seen Dao’s vision. “The beginning” was more accurate than Connors realized. Draco hoped he’d be able to ask his former professor a few questions; Dahlia had been nothing but kind to him in his eighth year, but he wouldn’t put it past her to have aided the Following some time in the past - perhaps even recently. He clung to the hope that she would put his doubts to rest.
The twenty minutes was hard to keep track of. Harry counted the drips of rain, spilling through unseen cracks and crevices to meet the underground stream. Finally, he figured he’d waited long enough and breathed deeply, picturing the area just outside the forest clearing. Harry twisted on the spot.
As they turned a corner, Harry suddenly felt a chill rush through him. He’d felt random senses of foreboding before, but he trusted his instincts and stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Joey, oblivious in her dauntlessness to push ahead, kept walking, but Draco slowed.
Draco smirked, carefully uncorking the vial again. A thin stream of golden smoke issued from the opening. “That was a joke. Even if it doesn’t work, the chances of you dying are slim.”
“It was only for an instant. Red cloth, someone’s robes, I guess. It wasn’t exactly the shade of the Gryffindor colors, though. More like a deep ruby.”
Harry took Draco’s hand on the railing, skin warm and brown against his paleness. When he spoke, it was with the ease that suited him most. Draco liked Relaxed Harry much better than the Waspish, Miserable, or Raging versions. “We’ll go check on her.”
“Fancy meeting you here,” Max Vernier drawled in an over-exaggerated English accent as he suddenly flopped down next to Draco. He absentmindedly ran a hand through the mess of auburn, wavy hair on his head. He could have passed for a Weasley, Draco thought, barring the French tinge in his normal voice.
“I think we should get out of here,” Joey said worriedly. Instead of scanning her surroundings, she seemed to be staring at the gap between the remains of what used to be two market stalls; several pots, bowls, and once-colorful tassles were scattered everywhere. “That was meant for us.”
“Are you asking because of what the painted lady said?” Draco said dismissively. “Please. I’ve been a Slytherin for eight years now. We get used to that. Mostly, anyway.” His face fell, and Harry wished to take his hand, but there were too many eyes watching.
Hermione pursed her lips. “We’re falling behind on homework,” She began but softened at the boys’ pleading expressions. “Oh, all
Draco stood up, bottle swishing in his grip. “Well, good night.” And he walked resolutely away, leaving behind a breathless, perplexed young wizard who knew more about Potions than what just happened.
“Getting you three home sounds like an excellent idea,” Antigone agreed, clasping her hands behind her back. “The Thai government got wind of what happened here; we received a missive from them. They’ll be in contact soon.” As if stirred by her militant tone, Harry slowly raised his head.
Cass cursed in frustration. The roar of the crowd grew louder as they surged onto the field, clambering down the bleachers to congratulate their friends. Ginny’s excited shouts pierced above the din: “We did it! We won, we won!” There was a burst of gold and scarlet as the Gryffindor team dismounted, rushing towards Harry, hugging him, thumping his back, ruffling his sweaty hair with gloved hands. Harry smiled uncontrollably, the thrill of well-earned victory sweeping through him from head to toe. Madam Hooch grandly handed the shining, golden Quidditch Cup to Ginny, who held it triumphantly above their heads.
And then he’s in the Toyota, the gash in the metal not quite the farthest thing from his mind as he cruises next to Draco, a bag slung over his shoulder, angrily stalking the sidewalk. “Draco, love, I’m sorry. Let me take you home, at least.”
Smoke issued from the tip of Harry’s wand in a thin, hot stream, wearing a hole in the carpet. He jumped out of his thoughts, noticed his accidental magic, and put the offending weapon down. “Sorry.”
“It’s not a unicorn,” Charon said roughly, taking the scroll. The bat gave the kitchen a once-over, squashed face unreadable, before screeching once and flying right back out the open window. Charon unrolled the message and turned away to read it. Moments later, he said softly, “Bollocks.”
A blast of warmth hit Draco and Harry as they sidled hurriedly into the hut, door slamming behind them. A fire roared cheerily beneath a copper kettle that emitted a white plume of steam. A couple of pheasants hung from the ceiling. The ominous scent of burning flour and raisins meant that Hagrid was baking his infamous rock cakes. His dog, Fang, was nowhere to be seen, but Harry noticed a terrarium in the corner that housed a small, hedgehog-like creature that appeared to be sleeping; a knarl, Harry guessed.
“But what about your potions?” Harry insisted, “Your experiments? I thought you liked doing those, maybe even for a living.”
“You must be rich,” Harry jokes, wide-eyed, and he feels a flood of victory thanks to the well-placed quip when Draco chuckles.
“You’re getting better at lying,” Joey told him as Harry came in, closing the door quietly behind him. He figured the statement was a compliment in terms of the game. “I’ve been playing this game for years, anyway.”
“Well, you’re not done yet,” Harry muttered. “It’d look too suspicious if you came out of the dorms with me. Keep that,” He told Draco, nodding at the enchanted garment. “Follow me out the door, slip into the hallway, and come back inside. Say you’ve been at the library or something.”
Harry laughed along with Ron until he saw a dark shape flit by the window. Draco, already in his black Hogwarts uniform, strode purposefully by.
Harry yelled, wand in hand, slamming a spell towards the ground, feeling the incantation rather than thinking it. An invisible force pushed him, Draco, and Joey to the forest floor, just as identical red jets shot over their heads. He rolled towards Draco, shielding him, and whipped his head around, feverishly counting the fallen -
“Not again.” A tightness forms around his lungs. Harry, in a sudden fit of desperation, grabs the tablecloth and yanks it off. Ceramic plates, utensils, and pasta go flying. Everything turns to smoke before it hits the ground, leaving an empty table and a silent, resigned Draco. “Not again…you…you
The smell of rotting leaves followed the eighth-year students as they exited Greenhouse Five, each of them gratefully taking great gulps of fresh February air. Most teens walked briskly from the greenhouse without looking back, wanting to put as much distance as possible between them and the horrors lurking behind the glass. Others took no such precautions but made a point to brush the various bits of plant matter from their clothes and hair as they left.
Harry nearly smiles, but melancholy drags him under again, an unwanted anchor tethering him to the freezing outside, where his listless body waits. He wants to go back in time. He wants to go after Draco and fix all this. Harry closes his eyes. I want, I want, I want. What did Draco want?
“No,” She said adamantly once the group had gathered before the painting. “No Slytherins; I won’t have it.”
Lucius, visage set in a permanent scowl, haughtily straightened his collar and glared. And between them…
“Thought not.” Joey sipped her coffee. “I have. You’d be surprised at what atrocities other wizards - other human beings - are capable of.”
Thank you to my wonderful friends from creative writing class who proofread and got me through writing blocks when I needed it. We’re all very busy taking the IB, so I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to help me out!
“It’s more than sex for me.” Draco touches his jaw, turning his face. “I mean…I know you know that already, but…” He wets his lips. “I want you to know how much you mean to me. You’re everything I never thought I deserved, Harry Potter.”
“I know him. He’s a decent bloke, I promise. He’ll keep everything confidential.” Kingsley Shacklebolt, with his deep and reassuring voice and persona of invincibility. Harry trusted him with his life; surely, the man could handle sensitive information. “Kingsley will investigate right away without getting you or your family into more trouble. Unless…” He hesitated. “There’s not anything incriminating left in the manor, is there?”
“Stood on the bath. Not very smart.” Draco winced as he struggled to sit up, one hand still feeling the lump on his skull.
Draco thought, a fact that he’d known already, but seeing his body in the flesh was another matter entirely.
“I know it’s a lot to ask from you, but don’t be a smartass. I’m saying you can leave!” Justin beams, and Pansy suspects it’s more at the prospect of being practically alone with Luna than Pansy helping her boyfriend.
“Sort of.” Draco heard a telltale crumbling noise and looked up to see a sizeable chunk of concrete fall towards them. “
“Going to Hogsmeade today?” Harry asked Draco that morning after they both returned to the dorm from breakfast.
“Probably think I’m a vampire,” He said amusedly, holding his hand to the light, and in fact, his skin was so pale in the brightness it was almost translucent.
“No one,” Hermione said, eyes wide, “But look.” She spread the paper onto the table for everyone to see. All four students leaned in.
Somehow they made their way to the sofa, and Draco was struck by the irony of leaning against Harry, limbs and hands tangled in this place where Lucius used to scold him if he laid down.
Harry unsteadily raised his wand, reluctant to strike again after his slipup. Draco took the opportunity, firing a wordless Stinging Jinx across the room. Harry yelped and ducked in the nick of time, the yellow jet riffing his black hair.
that you came to me. Really, I am. However, there’s not much time until my next class, especially not to go into detail about this complicated topic. See me after class today, will you? And we can set up an appointment to chat.”
“Down!” Harry pushed Draco, and they both fell to the dirt. Jets of light sped over their heads, and yelps echoed around the courtyard as the criminals’ spells hit each other. “Come on,” Harry said, yanking Draco up in their rush, and Draco was glad that Joey had not come with him. He had grown to respect her cool head and intelligence, but if anyone but Harry manhandled Draco like this, they were liable to lose a hand.
But he was there, pale hand curling over a corner, his slim figure dressed in plain black robes. Draco moved gracefully, hardly a sound echoing over the cobblestones. He had his wand in hand.
Rabbit and Dao were joined by several other masked wizards and silvery Patronuses, swimming and trotting above their heads to keep the dementors at bay. Harry’s spirits lifted - perhaps none of the dementors had gotten to Draco.
“Joey,” Harry blurted, then hesitated. Joey wished she could read his expression. “Never mind. I’ll ask you later.”
Heat emanated from Draco’s body. He’d shed his outer robes, leaving the vest and dress shirt underneath. Harry tried not to stare, but he couldn’t help noticing the details.
“No, we’re okay,” Harry declined when he saw the alarm on Draco’s face. “We should be heading back. Could you let Athena stay the night, though?” At the sound of her name, the owl abruptly rose from her light slumber and swooped down upon them. On instinct, Harry lifted his arm, and Athena landed on it, talons gripping him firmly. She fixed her yellow eyes upon him and resolutely settled her wings. “Guess she’ll come with us again,” Harry decided, and Athena allowed him to drape a section of his cloak over her as a shelter from the rain.
“Although it goes without saying,” Ron said sternly, “That if you break Ginny’s heart, you’ll have her brothers to answer to.”
Rabbit resisted the urge to dive to the ground and cover their head as the ritual was performed. Their fists clenched as they watched Kayala’s souls separate from her body, watched Dao harness the dementor’s power to steal the spirits and magic from her old mentor’s body. Rabbit closed their eyes and shut out Dao’s wails - she knew it would be painful, Rabbit told themselves, she knew the risks. Yet something seemed terribly, terribly wrong.
Draco blinked at this thought and gripped his wand tighter even as it fell to its side. The smoke had begun to clear; if their tail was around, it wouldn’t take long to pick them off from the fallen crowd.
One by one, the memories click by. An asinine argument over a group project that leaves both Harry and Malfoy nearly in tears. Malfoy’s shocked face, drawing Harry’s attention through a blur of rain as he holds Ginny close after a post-game kiss. A tense game of chess, tradition between the two Salisbury house presidents, that ends in a draw, and in a barrage of insults and accusations. Harry coming to blows with one of Malfoy’s male friends after a snide comment directed at Hermione, Malfoy hovering nearby, unwilling to stop them. The ruthless presidential campaigns, and the sinking dismay when Harry and Malfoy realized they’d both won. The first, and only, time Harry saw Malfoy cry, slumped against the lockers after one of his first weeks at a new school.
“Ron and Hermione,” Harry said fondly. “My best friends since high school. They’re the only classmates who supported me when I went into sex work. And this,” He said, indicating the other picture, “My godson, Teddy.” A months-old baby with a tuft of light-brown hair and wide, hazel eyes, looked curiously up at the camera.
