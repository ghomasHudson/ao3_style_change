Draco could tell that Hayden was nervous and he wanted to do something to help ease it. But before he could do anything, Dumbledore started to speak, the hall quieting as he did so.
"It's the last class of the day, I have no reason to go back. Besides, you're obviously not going? What gives you the right to reprimand me?"
"Hayden? Can we-" but before Draco could finish, the Phoenix had turned around and was walking the opposite direction, heading to their next class before lunch was over.
Hayden told his father all about his classes and about the Tournament and about his troubles with Dumbledore and the Ministry and of course, his problems with his soulmate.
"Are you ready for your interview with the Daily Prophet, Hayden?" Pansy asked from across the table during breakfast. "I heard that Rita Skeeter is giving the interviews. Be careful with her, she'll make anything up in order to sell a good story" She warned the raven boy.
The cup turned red again and their attention was drawn to it, listening for the next name to be called.
Hayden couldn't care less for the new rule. He had no interest in the Tournament and was frankly quite glad he was not allowed to enter!
"We're going to the dorms, your roommate needs you or else he might explode, literally" Blaise said, remembering the feel of Hayden's magic when he stormed into the room.
“Mmmm,” muses Harry, content in their current position. “If I can’t tease you, what’s left, Malfoy?”
The next day passes in a blur. One moment they’re having breakfast, the next they’re packing their bags and pulling on some muggle clothes, Malfoy looks dashing in dark wash skinny jeans. They use the floo network in Mcgonagall’s office to get to Andromeda's house.
Harry mostly listens in silence, soaking up the fact that he is back at Hogwarts with people he cares about. His mind snags a little on the fact that Malfoy is now someone he cares about, and he catches himself looking at Malfoy as the three of them sit down at the Slytherin table. Malfoy sees him looking and raises a pale eyebrow at him before turning back to talk to Hermione. Harry is about to say something to get Malfoy’s attention again when a shout cuts through the great hall.
Draco hisses at the contact but says, “Language around the brat, Potter. And I’m pretty sure you’re the one who suggested dinner and freezing.”
“Yes, of course.” Narcissa says, all calm facade and cool words. Harry suddenly realizes where Draco picked up most of his mannerisms from.
Harry feels Draco smile against his neck, and hears him say, “Oh stop being such a big baby, you’re fine.”
“I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am that you called me, Harry. I know you went through a lot and are expected to bear a lot, but I’m glad you’ve realized you don’t have to do it on you own.”
“It’s worse this time. We’ve become friends and are now sharing a room a Hogwarts.” His voice cracks on the last word, and he rests his head against the cool brick, hoping it will ease his mind.
It gets to the point where Harry finally says, “Will you just take my number, that way I’ll know if I need to save you a seat or not.”
“Oh who cares.” Malfoy says, pulling the door closed behind them and casting a quick spell under his breath to lock it.
Harry laughs helplessly, and feels Draco’s hand twist in the jumper he’s wearing, “I don’t know Ron. There isn’t much we can do is there?”
After apparating into the flat, Harry tosses his bag carelessly onto the ground and flops face first onto the couch.
Harry looks at the elf fondly, and does his best to tramp down any feelings of nervousness that are circling in his stomach at the thought of Draco opening his present. He had a hard time figuring out what to get him. This was their first time exchanging gifts, and judging from what Draco bought his friends, he’s a much better gift giver than Harry.
“It certainly seems that way doesn’t it.” Harry says, gently lowering Teddy to the floor so that he can crawl around while he looks for his bath things from the summer.
Harry snorts before handing the first present over, and watching as the afternoon sun glances off the top of Draco’s silver hair. Thoughts of how Draco might as well be an angel are interrupted by Draco’s gasp.
“Hi Luna,” Harry starts, trying to calm his still racing heart and heavy breaths, “Could I come talk to you tomorrow?”
Harry leans back to look at him. He gently presses the pad of his thumb to the crease between Draco’s eyebrows and ghosts kisses across both cheekbones. “You got to see your mom, she seems happy, you have her blessing to be with me. Is there more you were expecting out of the visit?”
Harry hangs up the phone and apparates directly into Hermione and Ron’s living room. Hermione isn’t in there but Harry can hear her in the kitchen bustling away. He sets his bag down and makes his way into the spacious kitchen.
Once inside, Kreacher greets the two boys and informs them that supper is nearly ready, and that he has Teddy’s food prepared. Harry gratefully lets Kreacher take Teddy from him while he shrugs out of his coat and boots.
There’s silence for a few moments, but Draco is rubbing small circles onto Harry’s back, so he thinks they’re probably okay.
Draco isn’t the type to get a happily ever after love story, and this is the thought that enables him to refuse Harry’s invitation for a nap.
In the silence that follows, Harry reaches for Malfoy’s hand and squeezes. Malfoy squeezes back but releases quickly before Andromeda enters the room.
Harry turns his attention back to Neville and takes a couple of steps towards him, letting go of Draco’s hand in the process. “What do you need to know Neville?”
He pauses before gently saying, “Do you know what caused it? Can I do anything besides sitting here to make it easier?”
After coming to this realization, he pushes off the bar, thanking Tom for the refill, and makes his way over to Draco. Harry catches the tail end of Pavarti saying, “It doesn’t even make sense! Huge plot hole if you ask me-” before slipping his arms around Draco’s middle and hooking his chin over the other boy's shoulder.
Harry focuses on slowing his still speeding heart, and isn’t really sure about how long that takes. All he knows is that Draco doesn’t complain once and holds him and rubs circles on his back until Harry finally looks up and takes a step back.
When he emerges five minutes later Malfoy is sitting up on the bed with his robes half on and his eyes drifting shut, head falling forward.
When they apparate outside of the Weasley’s house, Draco isn’t sure what he had been expecting. His father had always told him the Weasley’s lived in an old pigsty. In reality, it is simply a house. Definitely a house held up by magic, and not nearly as nice as the manor, but a house nonetheless.
For once Malfoy doesn’t have a witty remark to make. He looks at Harry blankly for a moment before giving Harry one of his rare smiles, “Well come on then Potter, those sausages aren’t gonna eat themselves.”
Harry leans in a little more to quickly kiss Draco on the cheek, but Draco turns his head at the last moment so their lips crash together instead. The moment is broken when a slight cough forces them to both look up.
“Do you want me to come to Hogwarts Malfoy?” Harry teases with a smirk, trying to mask the sincerity in his voice.
“Yes to Hogwarts you blithering idiot. If you don’t want to be an auror, or at least not yet, are your ghosts the only thing that’s stopping you? Granger is there and so is McGonagall. So you could get alternative lesson plans or altered schedules to fit your needs. Hell, I’m even there if you really wanted it.”
“I’m sure he is.” Harry says, planting a kiss on Draco’s cheek, “And Mrs. Weasley wanted to talk to us quickly.”
The kiss is all consuming, mind numbing, perfection. Harry wishes he could live in this kiss and never leave. A feeling wells up in his chest. Painful and beautiful and strange. He thought he knew this feeling, had Dumbledore tell him his whole life it was his strength, but really it had taken Draco kissing him and being with him for him to figure out how strong this feeling could be.
Dinner itself is relatively painless. Draco is sitting beside Harry at the end of the table on one side, and across from Granger and Ron. He’s left alone to eat, nobody bothering to talk to him because everyone is focused on Harry, Ron and Hermione.
“Draco, come on.” Harry says taking a few steps and twisting Draco’s hands with his own. “They love me. And I love you. They might not like you but they’ll tolerate you for my sake.”
He needs time to be just Harry, without all the fame and glory, whoever that is. Sighing, Harry gets up and grabs his laptop, phone, and wand and heads out of his apartment. He needs coffee and free wifi. Luckily enough he is within walking distance of both of those in the form of a Starbucks downtown.
Malfoy looks pained and mutters, “I despise you both, I have a reputation to uphold.” Before gesturing that they should continue making their way to the dining hall, "Shall we?"
Distantly Harry hears the jingle of a store bell as the door opens, he silently hopes there’ll be butterbeer in his future.
Saying Sirius’ name out loud to Draco so casually feels like splitting open his heart and allowing all his blood to flow out of his body, but it needs to be said.
Harry smiles in return. “It’s no problem, but I should probably get back to Teddy and Malfoy, have a great night.”
With them pressed close together in a warm hug, it’s impossible to ignore how similar they look. Teddy’s hair had long since morphed to match Draco’s platinum blonde, and Harry knows that if they both opened their eyes, the colours would match. Even their skin colouring is the same.
It’s warm inside, and the smell of cooking food is wonderful. Draco takes note of who is all in the room. He recognizes Arthur, Ginny, George and Percy, but draws a blank at the two older redheads in the room. Ron and Hermione aren’t there yet and conversation screeches to a halt at the sight of Draco in the doorway.
Harry smiles at both of their reactions before getting into it. “Ron you’ll be fine, I haven’t been to training for over a week and you’ve managed to survive. And Hermione, from what Mcgonagall says you’re gonna have a lot on your plate, what with being a teaching assistant for charms and all.”
They still see each other around the Burrow, but Harry makes sure not to hover or pry. He averts his gaze and strikes up a conversation with any of the other Weasleys. How they all stand his presence he’s still trying to figure out. He glances at Ron when Hermione starts talking.
“You’re right.” He says finally, he pulls Draco in for a bruising kiss, not caring if anyone sees, “I’ll see you back at the castle. I need to do this.”
Just as he’s deciding that this is a mistake and that he’ll leave, Luna opens a door and says, “Hey Harry, you can follow me.”
Draco tries to get that voice to shut up, but it’s getting overwhelming loud with each flirtatious comment and lingering stare Harry sends his way.
When they break apart, breathless, hands roaming each others bodies, Harry rests his head against Draco’s and says, “I have to tell you something.”
He wants that for him and Malfoy. He wants late nights, and drinks with friends, all while calling Draco his boyfriend. Without fear of judgement.
“Harry. I’m happy to be with you. But you’ve barely told your friends, the majority of them still don’t know about us. Are you really prepared to have the entire wizarding world writing you demanding you have your head examined, on top of having to explain things to your family and friends? And like you just said, it’s Rita writing it, it won’t be a nice article on young love. It will be an attack on my personality and your sanity.”
Harry doesn’t accept the call but doesn’t cancel it either. He lets it ring out and stares at the picture of Malfoy. It had been taken on one of their coffee dates and shows Malfoy glaring directly into the lens of the camera, a hint of a smirk showing on his lips, hair falling onto his forehead.
He never should have tried this, never should have tried coming back to school so soon, now he’s in deeper than he thought. His mind catches on the only other place he feels safe. He’s summoning Kreacher and apparating away before he even has time to think of the consequences.
But neither boy moves to fix it, too content to stay in one another’s warmth. It’s well past noon again when they decide to move to the couch and exchange gifts. Kreacher flits in and out of the room in the new pillow case Harry had gotten him, preparing Christmas dinner while refilling Draco’s teacup and Harry’s mug of hot apple cider every half hour or so.
"Well, your wings came out at the end of the task and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who saw. So, i'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you have creature blood?" Draco inquired, to which Hayden only stared back in shock.
"Any house news or events will be posted on the event board by the fireplace. Our house password is there and changes every month so be sure to check it before you leave the dorms tomorrow. The password changes every month on the first, if you do know the password then that is your problem and you will have to wait until someone opens the door for you. Your nameplates are on your dorms. Each floor is dedicated to a class, girls on the left, boys on the right. Each dorm room houses two students. If you have any questions you know where to find me. Welcome to Slytherin" Severus finishes his welcoming speech before leaving and heading to his chambers.
With much reluctance the man agreed, and the door closed. The goblin had Harry walk to the center of the room.
Why was he lied to about his heritage, why try to force Harry to be friends with people who obviously seemed to not like him?
He was positive that if he asked, either Draco or his mother- perhaps even both- would be perfectly happy to help him learn, but that didn’t mean it was any easier to ask.
"No, I did not, nor did I get someone else to do it for me!" Hayden said as confidently as he could with all the confusion swirling in his head.
Draco hurried out of the common room and up to where his and Hayden's dorm was, hoping that he didn't put any locking charms up.
“You are just like your mother” Tom smiled as he watched his son laughing and smiling for the first time since he arrived back.
Hayden followed the transfiguration teacher down a staircase and to a different hallway "Mr. Snape we are going to have you be sorted before the first years"
The raven was glad that his parents were who they were because the emotionless glare he shot her down with was something that could only be passed down.
Severus could feel tears start to well up in his eyes. He felt immense guilt wash over him. This was the boy he had been so cruel to? All this time Harry had to deal with this in his homelife and Severus' bullying must've just added to the pain the boy must've already been feeling.
“Oh shush!” Tom said as playfully swatted at his son who just laughed at him in return who fell down to the floor in a show of dramatics.
Hayden uncurled himself and tried to crawl away from the danger he thought was there, but when he looked up, relief washed over him. It was his mate, he didn't know how but he knew it was him. Behind him were his parents.
"I'm here" Sev responded from his place in the arm chair. He placed his book down to turn his attention to his son on the couch.
"Don't think you can hide from me, boy!" Hayden heard his uncle yell from inside his old room. The door slammed open as the big walrus came storming into the room, Hayden trying his hardest to disappear as he kept shuffling back into the closet door.
Severus spun around quickly when he heard a soft groan sound from one of the corners in the room. His dark eyes widened as he looked down at the sight before him.
Hayden closed his wardrobe doors and flopped onto his bed, tired. It had been a long day, this was really the first time all day he had had time for himself.
The Phoenix sighed in resignation as he struggled to try and get to his feet. It took him a couple minutes, but he was finally able to stand. Now he just had to take a step forward.
He hesitantly brought out dinner, knowing what was coming. As he set down the plate in front of Vernon, he tried not to flinch too hard as the man yelled, "WHAT IS THIS! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US WITH YOUR ATROCIOUS COOKING SKILLS!"
"Sure" his mother responded, making his way from his arm chair after putting down the book he had started reading.
Strangely enough, the first night he had spent in the room, he had the strongest feeling to gather all the blankets and pillows and arrange them on the bed in a soft and warm nest.
On the other side of the room a particular red head was swooning, to the point of almost falling out of his seat.
Hayden thoroughly enjoyed doing work for his father. He loved the feeling of having a purpose that spanned to more than just being a pawn.
He laid in bed for a moment, wishing that he didn't have to get up and that he didn't have to endure this family any longer.
He was starting to get an unfamiliar feeling of anxiousness. He didn't know why or what might've been causing it, it was completely new, but for some reason, he felt the need to go and check on Hayden, but he was in an interview, what could possibly be harming him there?
It was then that he noticed Harry's smell. It was so vaguely familiar to him. He knew it from somewhere but couldn't place it. Then it hit him.
After dinner, he and Draco had come up with the idea of just opening the egg, but they realized their mistake almost immediately and closed the egg as quickly as possible.
Helping Hayden to sit up in bed, he gestured to the mirror on the wall beside the bed. Hayden shakily stood up and went to stand in front of the mirror.
"Honestly Ron, it's fine!" Granger said before turning to Hayden, who still laid lounging on the seat.
Hayden pouted not wanting to stop, Draco only smiled though, loving the adorable look on his mates face.
"Come on Sev, move back in, and we can all be a happy family again" Tom said, giving his husband puppy eyes in hopes to persuade the potion master into coming back to Riddle Manor.
When Hayden woke up he did quite recognize where he was or how he had gotten there, but at the same time he couldn't really find it in himself to panic or even care that he didn't remember at the moment.
The next morning during breakfast, Dumbledore announced that the school would be hosting the Yule ball in a few weeks around mid-January. At the same time, the Headmaster also announced that each of the Heads of Houses will be meeting at separate times with their houses to go over rules for the dance: such as dress code, etiquette, and the teaching of the beginning waltz for the ball.
Granger opened her mouth, presumably to make a sarcastic retort, but nothing came out. She tried again, but no words made it past her lips.
Hayden started to tear up a little. He was feeling just so happy that he was lucky enough to have someone like Draco.
"I'm Hermione Granger, it's nice to meet you. We heard rumors that a new fourth year was on board and we wanted to meet you before you got sorted" the bushy haired girl greeted. She smiled at Hayden, who only raised an eyebrow in slight annoyment, before elbowing Weasley who stood a bit behind her.
But instead of the anger he was expecting, he found the man was also crying, but he looked at him with a loving smile on his face.
Maybe it would be good to just have a break for a couple of days, visit his father. Maybe he can help him figure out the next task. Being at the mansion would also probably be better to execute the plan he would have for Dumbledore.
Hayden then realized a quiet growl could be heard coming from Draco, a harsh glare on his face trained on the Bulgarian.
Suspecting it to be just a random person deciding to jog the rest of the way, so he didn't bother looking back behind him. Much to his disappointment, he really should have looked behind him.
Just as he started a new paragraph, he felt a raindrop fall onto the back of his neck. He looked up at the sky, trying to gauge whether or not it would actually rain, he was answered when he felt another drop fall onto his cheek.
Draco was in potions the period before after lunch. Today, Snape was having the class make a sleeping drought with their table partners. Since Hayden was Draco's table partener, he had to work alone, not that he minded of course!
"I want it to be your first mission as the enforcer of our cause. Recently I have been given information that we somewhere in our ranks is a rat" Tom explained.
“And back at Hogwarts he always paid more attention to you than his homework whenever he asked you to help him study,” Hermione threw in.
“I’m not laughing about you,” Harry hurried to reassure him. “It’s just… yesterday I was worried you’d give me an ultimatum or break up with me because I was too clingy for you and now…”
When they reappeared in the living room of their flat a second later Draco’s face grew even paler than it already was. Alcohol and apparition had never been a good combination.
Harry put a bookmark into the book he was still in the middle of and set it aside. “All right. Talk, then.”
“Oh,” Harry said before he could supress his surprise. He hadn’t met Draco in person before, so he’d only had the few selfies Draco had sent him and their handful of Skype calls as a reference and the person in the fashionable coat, who was apparently Draco, didn’t look anything like the image of Draco he had in his head.
Harry lay down on the other side of Gisbert and curled up on his side facing Draco. “Good night, Draco.”
After another hour of lying in bed, dreading the inevitable, Draco’s restlessness finally outmatched his dread and he got up and got dressed to get the awkward conversation that was sure to come over with.
“We should get you to bed then or you will complain to me about not getting enough beauty sleep tomorrow,” he said and gently pushed Draco away from him. Draco blinked owlishly at him but didn’t complain and let Harry guide him to his room without a word of protest as well.
“Can you come get me from the bus station close to your flat?” Draco asked. Harry was suddenly wide awake again.
Harry swallowed around the lump in his throat and then said what he had realized only a few minutes earlier. “It seems I’m much better at risking my life than I am at risking my heart.”
“Okay. Is it important that it’s tomorrow or could it wait another month or two, so you can get more comfortable with the idea of sharing it with me?”
When they were back in Harry’s flat, Harry led Draco to the kitchen and pushed him down on the chair closest to the heater to warm up.
Harry was surprised and then a little confused. “Well, apparently it didn’t, I’ve been around you enough to know you don’t turn into a wolf every full moon. So, what did the potion do?”
He found an apple and concentrated on cutting it into thin slices so his eyes wouldn’t stray towards Harry who looked way too comfortable lounging on the couch with one of his Muggle-written novels.
And just like every GSR Night before this one it took about an hour for Draco to get bored of talking and leave the table to join the throng of young witches and wizards on the dancefloor. Harry watched him leave, half wanting to join him until Ron waved his hand in front of his face.
Draco looked away from him. “You’re much too good for me. You’re always so nice and accommodating and… kind, no matter how shitty my mood is and I’m just… not.” He hadn’t even had to think about his answer. It was the same one he had given himself time and time again whenever the hope that Harry might return his feelings had blossomed.
Without a backward glance Harry mounts his broom and shoots off into the sky. He hears a muffled curse from Malfoy, but it isn’t long before the other boy joins him in the air. Harry lets out a whoop of joy and pulls the broom handle up, urging it to go higher and faster. It’s certainly no firebolt, this broom is old and slow and wonky, but it’s still flying and with the wind stinging his eyes he realizes, that’s enough for him. He manages to pull off a few decent loop de loops before he hears a laugh from Malfoy below and looks down.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Okay, Mr. Mystery.” He smirks before continuing, “Are you happy you’re now a part of the Weasley crew?”
“Harry.” Harry corrects him, smiling and looking at him out of the corner of his eye. “And how am I supposed to tell the difference between what’s mine and yours when your stuff is just thrown all over my room?”
There’s silence for a moment and if Harry didn’t know Hermione as well as he did, he’d think she was gone.
Harry’s heart skips at Draco using the word love to describe their relationship, but it sinks immediately when he takes in everything Draco just said.
To highlight his point a group of first year Gryffindors come giggling up to the table to ask for his autograph. Malfoy sneers and rolls his eyes in response, while Hermione hides a laugh behind her hand and Harry tries to politely decline. The Gryffindor’s finally turn away after Malfoy threatens to use them as his next transfiguration project. After this is dealt with Harry turns back to Hermione.
“I think,” Draco whispers, scared to voice this thought in case it makes it unreal, “I think that maybe he likes me too.”
While he moves to stand down at the end of the counter to wait, he casts his gaze towards Draco, who’s pulled his beanie off and is running one hand carelessly through his hair. He’s fiddling with his phone but seems to sense Harry’s gaze on him because he looks up, meeting Harry’s eyes and quirking an eyebrow with a smirk.
Harry looks at Malfoy for a moment before scoffing, “It’s not much different than hanging around with you to be honest, Malfoy.”
“Hey Hermione,” Harry smiles at how happy she sounds to be talking to him, it is reassuring to know that with all the changes going on in his life right now, he can always count on these two.
Draco smirks and picks Teddy up from the floor and stands up. “Let’s go Potter, the park isn’t gonna come to us.”
“Alright,” Harry says, turning to look at Teddy with his filled bowls, “Let’s give this a shot shall we?”
“That can be arranged.” Harry replies, grinning slightly at the flush that appears on Draco’s cheekbones.
“Somewhere that involves me not wearing sweats you mean?” Harry asks without removing his face from being smushed into the cushions.
Harry’s heart squeezes a little at that, knowing that it shouldn't matter if he gets something or not, but feeling relieved nonetheless.
Draco recognizes the move as one of Harry’s common ways for grounding Draco for when he thinks Draco is going into a panic attack. It’s then that he notices how fast he’s breathing and how tight his chest is feeling.
Harry laughs at that and goes back to working on an essay for his Auror training, shaking his head at the weird turn his day took, but nonetheless feeling a little bit more centered.
Malfoy has a dark far away look in his eyes that makes Harry sit up finally and look at him. Malfoy shakes his head.
But when Harry had looked at him with those big stupid eyes in that stupid Starbucks he was stupidly done for. And honestly, he would take whatever Harry was willing to give. He had tasted his lips once, and now doesn’t know if he could go without.
And with that she walks into the restaurant where Neville is holding the door for her, and what looks like Hannah Abbott and Parvati Patil stand waiting just inside.
He attempts to run drills as well. He halfheartedly gives out instructions and comments, but his mind is elsewhere.
Harry ignores Ron’s eyes on him while he waits for Malfoy’s reply. It comes a short breath later in a tense voice.
Draco smiles at that because Blaise is completely correct, and he’s missed hearing a kind, familiar voice.
This thought is punctuated by Harry’s hand skimming along his back as he passes behind him. Draco closes his eyes at the touch. His stomach is in knots and none of his coping mechanisms seem to be working.
Harry doesn’t fall asleep again, but he dozes slightly, keeping his arms around Draco the whole time. He only gets out of bed when he hears Teddy stirring from the other room. It isn’t time for Teddy to wake up yet, but Harry is tired and still drained from the nightmare, so he goes to the living room to cuddle with him anyways.
Malfoy had insisted that they get dressed to go pick up the food because he didn’t think the people in Starbucks would take too kindly to seeing two very disheveled boys showing up in clearly slept in clothing. Malfoy didn’t have any clothes with him that weren’t rumpled from sleep as he hadn’t brought an overnight bag when he apparated to Harry’s flat, and because he is an absolute twat that refuses to go out in public in slept in clothing, he had almost refused to come. But then Harry had tossed a pair of his own joggers and a jumper in Malfoy’s direction and with a muttered “fine” he'd gotten dressed.
Malfoy doesn’t do this, instead he takes another bite of his sandwich and looks at Harry expectantly.
He reaches for Harry’s hand, “I know you carry a lot of regret Harry. And I know me saying you don’t have to won’t make it easier, but I’m hoping this present will be a reminder of all the things you’ve overcome, rather than the things you lost.”
This thought is punctuated by Mrs. Weasley saying, over the clamor of other voices, “Harry dear, could you and Draco come with me for a second?”
"I am sure they will love you. And if they have any problems at all with you, they will have to answer to me and your father!" Hayden gave a small smile at that.
He tried to get up, but immediately found that he couldn't due to something weighing him down. He felt heavy.
During dinner, the small family discussed what the upcoming year of Hogwarts would look like for Hayden.
What was supposed to be a short run to the library was turning out to be an unending and stressful encounter.
"Well, um, I found out last night, right after getting back to my dorm" Hayden started out shyly. "It's Draco" the boy smiled.
He found it strange that Lord Voldemort had had a child with someone. In a way it made perfect sense, he now has an heir to carry out his will after he's gone, but still.
Tom reached out and brought Hayden into his side. Transfiguring a couch pillow into a thick blanket, he covered his shivering son. Before he knew it, Hayden had fallen asleep against his side.
"Oh, stop pretending that you care. Stop trying to tell me what to do! Stop trying to protect me!" Hayden shot back, tears starting to fall from his eyes.
"Do you know what you did to him?" Severus asked, curious if Draco even knew the consequences of his actions.
The Hall was silent. Everyone was confused, no one knew that Snape had any relatives. Most assumed that Hayden was most likely Snape son's which baffled everyone.
After a minute, Hayden was finally able to calm down, then something caught his attention. The cup in the center of the room had turned red, It must be time. He paid a little more attention to what was going on, wanting to hear the names of the lucky three.
He looked down to the shaking boy in his arms and hugged him tighter. He had finally found his son! After all this time of searching, he had been right under his nose for the past three years.
Hayden and Draco hoped that McGonagall would have mercy on them and put them together, but it wasn’t a very likely wish.
Draco woke up from his dreams to the sound whimpers coming from Hayden's side of the room, and not the pleasant kind he would have preferred to hear from the boy.
"Albus, there has to be something we can do! We can't possibly let him in the tournament!" McGonagall implored.
"You have gone through an early inheritance and because of the creature you are, you have wings" Severus responded.
About the same amount of boys came in marching into the Hall once Dumbledore announced them. Hayden had to admit, they made a pretty good entrance! Way better than the Beauxbaton girls.
He whimpered, trying to brace himself from the next hit, but it never came. All he heard was silence.
Draco could feel the moment that Hayden relaxed in his hold, he could hear when the ravens' uneven breaths slowed.
Two sets of jem colored eyes pinned Bellatrix making her squirm a little under the gaze of Voldemort and the new person in the room.
Wandlessly, he opened the window for the bird who landed on the side table by the sofa. Gently, without waking his son, he took the letter from the owl then watched as it flew off.
"Really? All you have to do is stroke the spine of the book. It's not that hard" Hayden answered, full of sarcasm.
“Thank you for your concern professor McGonagall, but everything is just fine,” The Phoenix beamed, easing some of the worry that had taken over the older woman’s features.
He could understand though why they would forget about him. He just wasn't worth enough to friends like them. They deserved better anyway.
Severus would've loved the possibility of finding him, but couldn't bear it if it turned out the boy in front of him wasn't who Severus was thinking he might be.
He walked back to the dining room and started to hand out the glasses. He had already given his Aunt Petunia hers and as he walked around to give Dudley and his Uncle Vernon theirs, he tripped and the glasses flew out his hands, spilling their contents all over the people seated at the table.
Hayden weaved his way through the few tables that were in his way, making his way over to the booth in the back of the place where Blaise was.
"Thank you, Sir" Harry whispered again, looking down. He had appreciated the thought, but he wasn't used to this. He didn't quite know what to make of the situation.
Draco smiled and leaned in to brush his lips ever so slightly against Hayden's so as not to wake him.
“Of course,” he said. He loved cuddling with Draco. It used to be the only time Draco let all of his numerous masks fall and even though Draco was mostly past wanting to hide any part of himself from him now, he was still much softer when it was just the two of them curled up on a couch with a blanket.
“Draco,” Harry said again and the sympathy in his voice almost melted Draco’s heart. “That’s not what love is about, at least not for me. I don’t care whether anyone thinks I deserve someone ‘better’ or ‘nicer’ than you because I like
It had been about an hour since the sun had disappeared behind the horizon when the change happened. It took only about a minute for Draco’s human body to change into that of a wolf. It looked painful but Draco didn’t make any sound. When Draco’s wolf body had settled into Harry’s embrace again, Harry chuckled because Draco had been right; it would have been near impossible to miss the change. What hadn’t changed though was Draco’s clinginess. Harry couldn’t say that he minded that, it was a lot more comfortable than the aggression werewolves were known for.
With that Hermione turns on her heel and heads towards Mcgonagall’s office, ignoring Harry’s shouts asking her what he was supposed to figure out on his own. Frustrated, Harry takes out his phone, which somehow is still working, and calls Malfoy.
Harry wakes up to morning sunlight streaming directly into his eyes because Malfoy insisted they sleep with the curtains open to “see the night sky.” Harry thinks Malfoy couldn’t care less about the night sky, but he has always delighted in any idea that makes Harry squirm.
Draco looks at him for a moment, his eyes tracking all over his face before saying, “You’re not the one looking at you. You look awful.”
Before long though Luna breaks the silence by saying, “Before we begin our actual session Harry, I was wondering if you could fill out this sheet for me? It’s just a baseline so I know what we should focus on in these sessions.”
Harry’s hands are freezing, and he fumbles as he locks the broomshed up. Fooling around on the pitch had kept his blood pumping and his body warm, but as the boys landed, the outdoor air had finally gotten to Harry. As he and Malfoy turn towards the castle, Harry takes a deep breath. Preparing himself for what was surely going to be the most difficult part of the day.
“Only for a year.” Rita says quickly, “And I’d be more than happy to talk to you instead Harry dear.”
“Is that a such a bad thing?” Harry asks, switching gears to calm Draco and reaching for his hand again.
Harry nods and tries to get comfortable without waking Teddy. Pretty soon his eyes are drifting shut with the warm weight of Teddy on his chest and Malfoy’s head on his shoulder. Before falling asleep completely, he catches Malfoy’s hand reaching up and holding Teddy’s small hand, a small smile playing on his lips.
Draco shrugs one shoulder again and chews slowly, “I was thinking of going and seeing my mother this afternoon after we drop Teddy off.”
For the first time in Harry’s fairly long life dealing with professor Mcgonagall he is pleased to hear those words. Without saying goodbye to the students, he pushes through them after the Headmistress, dragging Malfoy along with him.
Harry laughs at this before saying, “I’ll have you know that I spent quite a bit of time watching Teddy during the summer.”
, so he puts on the weather channel and allows himself to zone out to the bland announcer’s voice and the calming music indicating light rain tonight.
When his mind catches up and starts to really wake up, he realizes there is a rather solid weight on his chest. This realization makes him go still and crack one eye open.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything to that but starts shoveling the food off his plate and into his mouth at such an astonishing pace that Harry counts it as a win.
“No you don’t.” Harry says breezily, “You hate the furniture. And if we got rid of your flat we could take your furniture and put it in mine.” He lets out a light chuckle, “Wouldn’t it be nice to fall asleep on your leather couch surrounded by my hideous orange walls?”
Harry feels a weight come off his chest and he looks over to George only to see him staring back already. When George finally does speak, his voice sounds hoarse from disuse.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and wanders off to the side to pick up his order, and then heads to their normal table at the back of the shop. Still grinning, Harry turns back to the barista and places his order.
The abrupt change in subject and presence of Harry calms Draco down enough to focus his attention back on the essay.
They follow a woman with at least a dozen piercings decorating her ears to the back of the shop. Harry should be getting slightly nervous, but all he can think about is how many times he would get his shirt caught if he had that many earrings.
Harry rolls his eyes and laughs, “You and your bloody beverages, are they all you ever think about?”
Hermione has turned back to the bubbling pot on the stove. Harry decides he doesn’t want to talk about this anymore and has just opened his mouth to ask her about her lessons when Ron apparates into the kitchen. He looks stressed and upset.
Draco sighs but pulls his wand out, and looking around to check that no one is watching, spells them warm and dry.
Harry reads between the lines and understands that Draco desperately would like Harry to come with him but would never ask him to set foot in the manor again.
“What are you doing here already?” Harry demands, the outrage ruined somewhat by how tightly he’s holding Draco and the smile on his face.
Laughing, Harry plants a kiss on Draco’s cheek before throwing the covers off and getting out of bed. Draco hesitates for only another second before getting out of bed and following Harry into the kitchen.
Malfoy laughs before saying, “You could barely stand the attention for ten minutes how would you have handled dinner?”
Harry looks at him for another few seconds before laying down and tucking his face into the crook of Draco’s neck and saying, “Maybe, but I wish you didn’t have to.”
“Quit being a fucking martyr Malfoy, I apparated half way accross town. And I missed dessert. I’m not going to just sit on your bloody bathroom floor and do nothing.”
“For now, I don’t think you need to do anything.” Hermione says, Ron nods in agreement. “You’ll just have to expect a ton of mail from angry witches and wizards.”
Malfoy scowls slightly but good naturedly walks with Harry in the direction of the train station. They make it onto the train with no issues except for Malfoy having trouble with the concept of an escalator, (“Muggles have moving staircases too?”).
It’s slow going. Harry not really sure what to say or how to say it. But Luna is patient and understanding, never prodding or demanding more. More often than not, she asks Harry what he thinks it means, and he’s forced to analyze his own emotions. It’s painful and makes Harry’s throat go tight and hands get sweaty. He’s close to tears multiple times. But he’s determined to work through this. He’s wants to be the only thing that controls his life.
Sallow’s face turns to Harry filled with disdain before looking back to Draco, “You’re going to let this boy speak for you?”
Ron rolls his eyes at that, “Hermione, I love you, but get out of the way. You too Harry. This is between Malfoy and I.”
Harry looks across the tavern and sees a witch and wizard, maybe a couple years older than him and Draco. The boy leans over to whisper something in the girls ear, and they both fall over laughing, hands clasped, foreheads touching.
Draco looks down at the floor and Harry nudges his foot with his own. Harry keeps his eyes trained on his shoes. “Did you tell her about us?”
The building is tucked away at the end of Harry’s street. It’s one of the less busy Starbucks in town but still offers a cozy break from the cold for countless university students. As they walk through the door, Harry’s senses adjust to the clicking of computer keys and the smell of both pumpkin spice and cleaning chemicals.
Harry knows Mrs. Weasley is just saying visitors to spare his feelings, when really she doesn’t want to see him, but Harry can’t wait.
“I’m pretty sure he got pictures of us.” Draco breathes, his breath showing in the cold air. “It will definitely get out now.”
They spend the rest of the day in bed. They ignore their phones most of the time, Harry going so far as to shut his off completely. Draco turns all his notifications off but rushes to pick up the phone when he sees that Blaise is calling.
“Harry it’s okay to have bad days.” Draco starts, setting his one socked foot on top of Harry’s bare one. “This is a bad day and I can listen if you want to talk about it.”
Draco nods, taking his hand out of Harry’s hair to lie down on the other couch. “It is quite strenuous, I won’t lie.”
“Yes Professor.” Ron replies, getting to his feet and following Mcgonagall out of the great hall, whispers follow Ron as he exits.
Harry closes Malfoy’s notepad while slinging his leg over the bench to sit down, using Malfoy’s shoulder to assist him with balance. It’s unnecessary but Harry wants an excuse to put his hands on Malfoy, even if only for a brief second.
Malfoy turns his head and presses a kiss to Harry’s wrist before crossing his arms over Harry’s chest and turning to rest his chin on them. “Andromeda has never met me before, and I fought for the side that left her husband and daughter-less.”
But how is it possible to explain to Ginny how when he is with Draco all the fragments of his broken life come together to make a clear picture? How when he’s with Draco he actually can think of a future where he’s happy?
The great hall is so silent that Harry can nearly hear the wax dripping from the candles. Every single pair of eyes is on the four of them. Blankly, Harry notices that there is movement from the head table. He also notes that Malfoy’s hand is fisted in the back of his robes. Whether Malfoy is holding Harry back or grounding himself, Harry isn’t sure. Ron makes no move to lower his wand.
“No, no, no.” Harry says quickly, grabbing Malfoy’s hand again. Why did he have to be so bad at communicating? “I’m sure about you, but we have to be sure about us before anything goes public because as soon as anyone catches wind of it it’ll be everywhere.”
“Now, I’ll get to work on getting your classes in order, for the time being just attend class with Mr. Malfoy. Additionally, now that there are two of you, you’re more than welcome to stay in the castle if you so choose. There are rooms available in the staff quarters that can be arranged to sleep you two. If not, Potter you’ll have to floo in from Malfoy’s house each morning as I’m at my limit for floo connections into the castle this year.”
They’re all gathered in the sitting room. Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione wedged onto a couch, and everyone else on an assortment of chairs and pouffes. Harry’s arm is once again around him, and Draco has his head leaning on Harry’s shoulder while Ron shows Harry some video on his phone. It’s almost peaceful.
What seems like only minutes later, Draco is unceremoniously dumping a pile of clothing on Harry’s head.
“Oh my god.” She says in such a tone that Harry is forced to look up at her, “Oh my god, are you in love with him?”
Happy Holidays everyone! Your guys' comments and kudos mean the world to us and we hope you loved this chapter <3
Draco leans into Harry’s hand slightly, shoveling another forkful of food into his mouth before saying, “Ya, ya I love you too Potter.”
Tilting his head up to catch his breath, Malfoy starts kissing his neck and Harry wonders how he ever thought he didn’t like Malfoy like this. Harry tilts his head to give Malfoy more room.
Malfoy handles it with incredible grace by replying that, “Potter is here because I fucking want him here, and I get what I want. Right now I want you off my pitch. Go.”
“You watched him all night,” he said. “You know where he is and what he’s doing at all times. You like him Draco.”
Harry stays quiet and he hears someone on their end get up and leave. A door slams somewhere in the apartment.
Hermione’s voice is beginning to slur with the edges of sleep, and Harry is struggling to keep his eyes open so with a promise to talk again soon, they each say goodnight and hang up.
“How are we feeling?” Harry murmurs in Draco’s ear, brushing his nose slightly against Draco’s cheek.
“Jesus Potter, you’re covered in blood!” Malfoy says, jerking upright and looking at Harry in shock and something that looks like concern.
“You’re right mate.” he says simply, throwing his arm around Hermione, “This is shit. I’m sorry it’s happening to you.”
He’s warm and real in Harry’s hands. A solid weight in his lap, and Harry wonders how he could have missed this for so long.
Ron nods again and awkwardly shuffles forward before pulling Harry into a hug. Harry hugs Ron back tightly, extremely glad they’ve made up.
Draco tucks himself into Harry’s side like a comma while saying, “I had to tell the lovely Miss Granger that we weren’t doing class today. She took that as a personal offence and decided to show up at our door.”
“Also,” Draco adds, “I’m not entirely sure you can handle yourself and I have a reputation to maintain.”
Hermione stares at him for a moment, her hand still raised mid gesture, and Harry feels himself flush red. He looks down but not before seeing her mouth slowly transform into a grin.
“Your boy has gotten himself rather tipsy, Weasley.” Draco drawls as he neatly deposits Harry in one side of the booth and slides in next to him pressing his thigh against Harry’s.
And soon enough there is a roaring conversation about quidditch at their table. Hermione, rolling her eyes, gets up to get a butterbeer and get away from the constant quidditch talk.
Harry’s heart skips in his chest but he pulls Draco in for a tight hug, “Everything is gonna be okay.”
Malfoy nods again and they leave the bathroom. Malfoy then leads Harry into a living room/ bedroom combination. There’s a bed and two couches arranged somewhat artfully around the room. Malfoy stands self consciously at the edge.
Malfoy’s eyes dart down to Harry’s lips before slowly making their way up to his eyes again, a smirk playing at his mouth. Harry feels himself swallow and breaks eye contact.
Harry smiles stupidly at Malfoy’s retreating figure before shaking his head and making his way to the counter.
He realizes that he knows more little things about Malfoy than he does about anyone else, but he pushes that thought to the back of his mind.
The next morning dawns before either of the boys are ready for it. They fell asleep some time before three, both of their phones still buzzing with notifications.
Luckily, daycare isn’t something they have to consider. He heads to the kitchen and starts making pancakes while giving Teddy some cut up fruit to gnaw on. He’s just sitting down to feed Teddy when Draco walks in.
Harry laughs, and Hermions asks about what spells were used. It’s almost like old times. The only difference is that when they enter the great hall Harry heads to the Slytherin table and Ron and Hermione continue on to Gryffindor. He wishes they would come sit with him and Malfoy, but he knows Ron isn’t quite ready for that just yet.
Harry shrugs again, feeling as if he’s done that a lot in this conversation. “I do plan occasionally. When it’s important.”
Harry scoffs, “Sure Draco.” And stands up with the pile of clothes Draco gave him in his hands. “You don’t look any better than usual.”
“Oh,” scoffs Hermione, finally drawing level with the two boys, “Ya absolutely no one would believe that Draco.”
Harry scoffs and rolls his eyes, but doesn’t argue. This close, he is reminded of their difference in height. The mere inch and half that Malfoy has always had over him. They both remain silent, Malfoy’s eyes filled with fury.
He gets in line and orders his regular tea before walking towards the back of the building for a quieter place to sit and work undisturbed.
“Draco now is it, Harry?” Rita says, hurrying to keep up, he heels clicking obnoxiously against the floor, “If I remember correctly you two weren’t this close before the war, what changed? Are you so damaged that you’re actually attracted to those who once fought against you? And here I was thinking you were the golden boy of the public, when really you have much darker tastes.”
Luna had grabbed Draco as soon as they’d walked in with a quick, “Not to worry Draco we’ll stick together with a few of the other non-Gryffindors.”
Hermione makes to interrupt, but Draco starts talking over her before she can get very far. Harry wonders how the two ever worked together when they’re both so used to getting the last word.
For Draco every single interaction is hard. He doesn’t want to get his heart broken, and as a result he won’t let himself indulge in the little things. Kissing Harry had taken all the bravery he had in his stores and now he is left entirely depleted and defenseless.
This chain of events leads to a very pleased Harry privately thinking that seeing Malfoy dressed in his clothes, looking all tired and comfortable, is almost better then the whole snogging thing. He doesn’t dwell on this too long, not wanting to think about what this revelation means about his feelings for Malfoy.
He can barely stand the close proximity. It’s what made him spell their beds farther apart in the room. Sure, the house elves move it back every day when he and Harry are gone to class, and his resolve weakens every time he has to do it, but do it he will. He’s spent too many nights dreaming about Harry, he really doesn’t need to fuck himself up more by watching him sleep.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry says, stopping the struggle and letting himself relax against Malfoy, “I’m pretty sure the cruciatus curse was less painful than this.”
“Definitely.” Harry says stepping forward to hug Andromeda, and then stooping down to pat Teddy’s head.
Harry smiles and looks back to his plate. Malfoy lets Harry finish his food in silence before dragging him to their next class. Harry is pleased to see that they just have charms and then a spare period between them and the end of the day. Although he really hasn’t done that much, Harry is ready to collapse into his bed.
“He’s in the playpen with some books and blocks, he’s alright.” Draco says, sitting down beside Harry and digging his knees slightly into Harry’s thigh.
The line goes dead. Draco sits in the hallway for what feels like forever. He clutches his phone tightly in his hand and closes his eyes.
“You mean what are we doing?” Harry turns to look at Malfoy before answering his question. “We’re gonna do some flying and reminisce about all the times I was better than you and almost knocked you off your broom.”
Hayden sat down in his compartment after putting up his trunk. He didn't really want anyone to barge into his area so he made sure to to close all the blinds. He left the door unlocked though in case Sev needed to find him. But that was unlikely seeing as he was all the way at the front of the train with the few other teachers who rode the express to school.
Draco woke up early the next morning ready to prepare to make this the most relaxing and romantic day he can make for his Hayden.
His mate leaned in close to Hayden, smirking, as he brought his lips to Hayden's ear. Hayden felt his heart shatter.
Finally, Hayden stood up. He stood for a moment, intently staring into the old man's eyes to intimidate him. He succeeded if the waiver in his eyes was anything to go by.
He didn’t really say much, just that the dance was nothing new and that the dress should be formal and elegant. The last thing he said before leaving was that a week from today, after classes, the Slytherin House is to meet in the practice room closest to the dorm so that they can learn the specific dance they will be doing to start out the ball.
Hayden was a little nervous to see his father, especially since they have been trying to kill each for the past three or so years. Hopefully they can put all that in the past and focus on the future and, hopefully, being a family.
Just as he made it down the stairs, he was stopped by Severus, who seemed to be waiting for Hayden to come back down.
Suddenly, a big spiked something hurled into the rock beside him, causing him to tumble down the small rocky slope. He was quickly able to roll out of the way of the next hit, sitting up to look at the thing attacking him.
"If you want, you can wear your mask," Sev said, gesturing to the mask laying on Haydens hip. "No one would it against you"
"Phoenix are similar in a way, but not closely. When we are courting, we tend to be rather physical, not so much in any sexual way but rather for comfort purposes. For Phoenix's, the submissive has more of a role, instead of just letting the dominant care for us, we tend to make them work for it. Phoenix's are strong willed creatures and we know what we want when we want it." Hayden laughed at this. He wondered how Draco would react to all this.
“I want you to know that if anything like this happens again tomorrow or ever, come get me right away, alright” Draco spoke before kissing Hayden’s forehead, who nodded in agreement.
A couple days later, it is finally time for Hayden to meet his father's Deatheaters and Hayden has been trying to pick out the perfect outfit for over an hour now with no success.
A couple days later found Hayden pacing nervously in the Champions tent waiting for the first task to start.
“We have a class with the Gryffindor's again tomorrow, right? I guess we'll see if Granger and the rest keeps up this act, then” Hayden said, finishing the conversation as he wrapped his arms more firmly around the body on his chest.
“What do you have there?” Cedric asked when he noticed Hayden was not paying attention to him. So, of course, the upperclassman decided it would be a good idea to step right into the Slytherins personal space.
"Would it be okay if I tried something?" Draco whispered slowly, almost like he was hesitant to ask. He leaned forward ever so slightly.
As soon as he had apperated to the Manor he took a steadying breath before walking into the Manor, purposely forgetting to knock.
All too soon, Draco was pulling away. With a smile on his face, he gently brushed away the dark hair out of Hayden's eyes before his eyebrows furrowed and a small smile graced the Veela’s features as he gazed down at his love.
"Is there anything else I need to know before I go back to my dorm and crash? I feel like I haven slept in three days, despite my 2 day coma" the raven jokes.
A couple hours later Hayden finally left his room, but since the Room created the door on a different wall, he missed the blonde that was sitting on the floor asleep, waiting for his once love.
He knew that his son's life was practically hell when he was still Harry Potter. He wonders briefly how Malfoy will react if and when Hayden ever decides to tell him this truth.
"After due consideration," Mr. Crouch started. "The Ministry has concluded that for their own safety, no student under the age of 17, should be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. This decision is final!"
The dragon looked at him cautiously before breathing a bout of fire his way causing him to jump out of the way right in the nick of time!
He contemplated just taking a seat on the other bench, but decided against. His friends were bound to try and come find if he didn't return soon. After a minute, he managed to pry himself away from the raven, quietly shutting the sliding door so as not to wake Hayden.
Nobody wanted to follow to see what was wrong for fear of doing or saying the wrong thing and possible facing his wrath, but at the same time, they all wanted to go try and make sure that he was alright and that if they needed to hurt someone for him, they would.
"And what brings you here so early in the morning?" Severus questioned. Draco shifted uncomfortably in his spot at the tone in his teacher's tone.
"Eternal glory. That's what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks, three extremely dangerous tasks. For this reason the ministry has seen it fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this, we have the head of the department of National Magical Cooperation, Mr. Bartemus Crouch"
He couldn't stop thinking about Draco and then the impending doom of what the next task was bound to be and how to get the clue he needs out of the egg.
"Where are you taking me? You know I can't stand being left in the dark, what's going on?" Draco demanded.
"I would like to make an announcement now that everything has been arranged" Dumbledore began. The Great Hall broke out in murmurs, everyone guessing that the announcement had something to do with the one Dumbledore gave that morning.
Harry rolls Malfoy off of him and stands up from his bed, “I’ll do you one better.” he sticks out his hand.
After charms, Malfoy and Harry head to the library to spend some time catching Harry up on everything he’s missed over the last month. Malfoy is not a patient teacher, and snaps every time Harry asks him a question, but then again Harry grew up with Hermione so he’s used to it at this point.
Harry smiles despite himself. “It’s good to see you too Kreacher. Do you mind taking me to mine and Malfoy’s room please?”
“Alright," Hermione starts hesitantly when neither Harry or Ron start talking, “I figured you two need to talk it out so we don’t have a repeat of fourth year. I can leave or stay if you want me to.”
With that Malfoy pulls out of his grip and heads to the Slytherin table on his own, head down and eyes forward.
She nods and grabs her bag, he notices her discreetly wipe her eyes with the back of her hand. Harry grabs his things as well as Malfoy’s abandoned book and bag. He shoulders it all and gestures for Hermione to lead the way.
Malfoy turns to go, not looking any happier about the situation, and Ron makes to follow him but Harry catches his arm.
It had been a good weekend up until the end, but Harry can’t pretend that he isn’t shaken by the dream, and anxious to get back to Hogwarts and classes.
Ron scans Harry’s face with a quick searching look, before scoffing and shaking his arm out of Harry’s grip, “I always do mate, calm down.”
Draco sits up so that they’re face to face and hardly a breath apart. Harry kisses Draco once more, softly. He’s not worried about telling Draco. He’s known how he feels for a while, he just hopes Draco feels the same way.
George’s hand wraps absently around her ankle from where he’s sitting at her feet. Clearly trying to calm her down without saying anything. Draco watches that instead of looking at anyone else.
“I’m almost 100% sure that you guys aren’t allowed to do that.” Hermione hisses again. Harry hears a noise that sounds like Hermione trying to get past the door and being rebuffed by Draco. He smiles lightly.
Hermione nods. “Well he is in all of my classes. We’re the only two eighth years, so we have pretty much all the same classes together. It’s nice to have someone as bright as him to bounce ideas off of. He even takes muggle studies now.”
The socks in question are rather fun, covered in dancing snakes. Leave it to Malfoy to be the one person he knows with personalized house socks. Harry’s own feet dig into the plush carpet underneath his toes.
Harry takes a deep breath and looks down at his lap and then over at Ron who nods and squeezes his shoulder again.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand one more time before letting go and turning his attention to the plate of food in front of him. Breakfast isn’t as good as it would have been if Kreacher had made it, but the fact that Draco made it for Harry more than makes up for the sub-par taste.
“Shit, Ron do not apparate right this second.” Harry says, stumbling to his feet and lobbing a pair of trackie bottoms in Draco’s general direction, “Draco and I just woke up and aren’t even dressed yet.”
So Harry had. And now the majority of the Weasley’s are sitting in the kitchen and looking at him expectantly.
Harry breaks eye contact and looks at his knees, trying to figure out a way to say he misses the castle too much to not come back, and that Auror training is not at all like he was expecting. But Malfoy ends up finding an answer for him.
Harry catches himself twisting his hand in Malfoy’s robe in an attempt to slow his heart. He hesitates to continue when he catches both Ron and Hermione’s eyes dart in their direction.
“Janelle will be with you in just a moment, feel free to browse some of the popular designs on the walls, and make sure you fill out these consent forms.” The girl with the piercings chirps and walks back to the lobby, leaving a clipboard and pen behind.
“Shove off, Potter.” Draco responds, “It wouldn’t look nearly as awful if you hadn’t started kissing me.”
Malfoy looks at him consideringly for a moment, before leaning down so that his forehead rests against Harry’s.
Immediately, the other boy is looking at him, tracking up and down his body looking for any signs of hurt. Draco grabs Harry’s hand, but Harry is the one who leads him out of the living room and towards a little closet that Draco hadn’t noticed before.
At first Harry doesn’t realize it’s his because the only two people he ever phones are sitting in the room with him. His heart lurches thinking it might be Ginny, but when he looks at it the screen reads “Incoming call from Amazing Bouncing Ferret.” Harry laughs silently to himself at the name before answering.
Sighing, Draco twists in Harry’s arms so that they’re facing each other and brushes a lock of Harry’s hair out of his face, “How much have you had to drink?”
At this Malfoy turns on his heel and walks out of the office, leaving his trunk behind. Harry scrambles to follow him, ensuring that his wand is in his pocket and thanking Mcgonagall as he goes.
Harry would have bristled slightly and stood in saunch defence of the Weasley’s if Malfoy hadn’t sounded so worried that they were actually going to appear.
Harry swallows, “I was thinking about it, and especially after last night I was thinking about it a little bit more. I don’t know enough about how the mind works to figure out how to stop these nightmares on my own. Potions and spells haven't worked so far so I’m kind of out of options.”
“Harry. Mate. No.” Ron says, cracking up, “Bloody hell, next time I see you I’m forcing you to go through all my memories of the sexual tension and innuendos we had to endure this year in the pensieve. You’ll see just how ridiculous you two were.”
He stomps frustratedly toward the kitchen, and laughing Harry follows. As they enter, bickering, into the kitchen, Malfoy flings the fridge door open and peers inside. No new groceries had materialized since breakfast sadly. Malfoy turns and looks at Harry expectantly.
Harry tenses and waits for Draco to say something, but when he looks at the other boy, Draco is pale and his eyes are pleading as they look at his mother. Narcissa either doesn’t notice and can’t respond the way Draco needs, so Harry starts talking.
He hears himself ask the question as though from a great distance. Fleur turns back to the pot without answering, but Mrs. Weasley takes pity on him.
“What even took so long?” He sneers, pushing past Harry to get to the bathroom. “It’s not like you style your hair or anything.”
As they leave the office, suddenly the regular noises of the hospital reappear. Harry hadn’t noticed they were missing while he was in the room until right this second. As he marvels at the amount of spell work Luna must have done to make the room feel safe for her clients, Luna’s hand wraps around his upper arm, forcing his attention to her.
“Alright Ron, I get it, you’d like to put a tracker on me so you and Hermione can know where I am at all times. Speaking of,” he says cutting in again before Ron can, “Is Hermione with you? I need to talk to you guys about something.”
He puts all the nice letters on the coffee table by the couch and quietly incinerates the rude ones without a second thought. He then proceeds to cross the room, and silently lift the edge of the comforter before crawling into bed.
Harry leaves him be and heads into his bedroom to get dressed. He throws on a pair of old jeans and with some hesitation one of Draco’s jumpers that had been thrown on the floor the night before when Draco was rooting around for his pajamas. It smells faintly of Draco and Harry tries not to think about how long he’s known what Draco smells like.
Harry is too busy scooping porridge into his bowl to notice the genuine smile growing on Malfoy’s face.
Before long he hears his name though and glances up only to realize that Draco is talking about him to the tattoo artist and doesn’t actually need his attention. Harry continues to hold Draco’s hand, allowing the other boy to hold his tightly whenever he pleases.
After dinner, they make their way back to the room. Slowly meandering through the halls, holding hands and talking in low voices, Harry realizes that he feels much better.
Chuckling, Harry saves the number in his phone and decides that he’ll head over to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner. Packing up his things, he phones Ron. For some reason his call goes straight to voicemail. Sighing he phones Hermione and she answers on the first ring.
Harry smiles at the realization that Malfoy had been waiting to fill his plate so that he and Harry could eat together. He decides not to mention it.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand and smiles tightly, his gaze already flicking back to the house. They stand there for another moment and Draco takes the time to really look at Harry.
“Alright Malfoy,” Harry says walking backwards with his hands raised, “You may be right. What about a scrimmage?”
Absently, he wonders if Harry is attracted to him, but then tramps that idea down. Harry is clearly not gay or aware that he is driving Malfoy fucking beserk.
Harry takes this moment of distraction on Malfoy’s end to sidle up closer and hook his chin over Malfoy’s unoccupied shoulder.
Harry goes into the bathroom for a couple minutes to change into his pajamas, his sleep trousers covered in little snitches that Mrs. Weasley got him for last Christmas. When he leaves the bathroom it’s to find Malfoy crawling into bed wearing a grey hoodie, a pair of old sweat pants, and to Harry’s surprise and horror, a monstrous pair of fuzzy green socks.
As Harry gets up, all eyes turn to him, but he ignores them. He’s getting quite good at ignoring the stares.
Harry scans the menu up top before answering. “Actually Marissa, can I please get a regular cranberry white chocolate mocha and two of your breakfast sandwiches, as well as my regular cappuccino please.”
Hermione looks at him and he notices that there’s a slight twitch at her lips before she says, “Harry, he’d be mad not to love you.”
“What about the fact that a vicious article has been written about the two of you, and I don’t see either of you denying what was said in it.”
Harry looks at Luna, for a second. Shocked by the abrupt end to the session, and even more surprised that he has to come back once a week.
Draco stops short and looks at Harry incredulously, “Because you were on the verge of a breakdown yesterday?”
Teddy flails his arms in agreement and Harry decides it’s time for breakfast. He sets Teddy in his high chair and dumps a handful of cheerios in his tray for him to gnaw on while he decides which baby food he’ll attempt to feed him today. He lands on banana baby food and some sort of fruit and yogurt concoction. He also preheats a bottle for afterwards when Teddy will inevitably want one.
Draco, of course, looks absolutely flawless. He’s wearing the beanie again, but this time with jeans, his leather jacket, and a navy blue shirt that Harry vaguely remembers buying sometime earlier in the year and promptly shoving to the back of his wardrobe.
He wonders idly what could have prompted this drastic change in attitude before realizing that there really isn’t that much of a difference. Sure, Ginny is taking part in a group conversation Draco is in, but she still won’t look at him when he’s talking, and is harsher than necessary when she answers him. Draco doesn’t even seem to notice.
As Harry lays in his bed that night looking across the bedroom at a sleeping Malfoy, he takes a second to consider what has happened.
Malfoy grabs Harry’s offered hand but drops the diaper bag and pulls Teddy’s hood up to hide his hair. Grabbing the bag and then catching Harry’s questioning glance he scoffs and says, “We really don’t need every single muggle in London to see the baby’s appearance change right in front of their eyes.”
The walk home isn’t as miserable as it would have been if they hadn’t had magic to protect them, but as they did, it’s a fine walk. Harry is pretty sure that Draco is pretending to be colder than he is just so Harry will keep his arm around him, but Harry isn’t going to complain.
Before long though, Draco is ordering Harry put on his coat and boots while stuffing mittens and a hat in his general direction. Harry, ever the boy who obeys orders, does as he is told. Draco takes Harry’s mittened hand as soon as Harry is fully dressed and they walk out of the room.
Malfoy sneers a little at that. “Seriously? The boy who defeated the dark lord is saying school might be too hard? Let me alert the media as to how retirement is softening their hero.”
“Harry?” Neville says again, taking a step closer, Luna trailing serenely behind him. “You good mate?”
Yet, as they sit in the library while Malfoy corrects his essay, feet tangled under the table Harry’s mind is preoccupied with thoughts of what gifts to get for his friends and family. Hermione and Ron are easy to shop for during the holidays, having had experience shopping for them before. Hagrid he’s thinking of getting a cool grooming kit for Hippogryphs he thinks he’ll like, and Luna and Neville will be delighted with a couple oddly shaped succulents.
It’s still early morning and all he really wants to do is grab Harry’s hand and drag his clumsy arse under the covers. The bed wasn’t very comfortable last night, two teenage boys sharing one horrendously lumpy double bed (seriously, Draco would have to teach Potter how to furniture shop at some point).
There’s silence on the other end of the line for a moment before Hermione says, “Harry, you know full well Luna would never tell anyone what you tell her, and she did receive training on counselling and dealing with PTSD, magical or otherwise.”
Rita looks vaguely disappointed by the contents of her statement and says, “Well that was a waste of parchment Harry. Why don’t you tell us why you’re out with the Death Eater's most beloved son?”
The hall is deadly silent, Harry can’t help but think that the first years are getting quite a show.
Harry laughs once, loud and bright, before Draco pulls his mouth back to his and they stumble blindly for the bed.
“Who cares about that?” Draco says, pulling Harry back over to the bed, “I didn’t need both of your friends knowing that we rip our clothes off like madmen before going to bed.”
With some guidance from Malfoy’s hands, Harry finds himself straddling Malfoy’s lap and kissing his neck.
“We know that, Harry.” Hermione says softly, her eyes sad as they focus on a still silent Draco. “But I don’t think everyone will believe that.”
It’s at this moment that Malfoy comes tumbling out of the grate. He catches his balance by grabbing Harry’s arm and keeps it there when he notices Andromeda looking at him.
“Mrs. Weasley, I know she doesn’t want to see me, but I really need to talk to her. It’s important, otherwise I wouldn’t ask.”
His hair is a mess and he has huge bags under his eyes, but he doesn’t look as upset as he had the day before. Harry crosses the kitchen and holds his arms up. Draco walks into them immediately, wrapping his own arms around Harry’s middle and tucking his face into Harry’s neck.
“Mother, I’m sure you remember, Potter.” Draco says, calmly twisting his hand together with Harry’s as he does so.
Draco’s heart beats a little faster at the smirk playing around Harry’s mouth, but refuses to let it show on his face.
Before opening the door to the outside, they stand looking at one another in the doorway. Draco has a grimace on his face, and the crease is back between his brows. Harry presses the pad of his thumb to it, smoothing it out.
That’s how a few hours later they end up at some restaurant called The Wolseley, and Harry looks around wondering how Draco managed to convince him that this wasn’t fancy. It’s incredibly expensive and Harry wonders why they couldn’t have gone to a place with chicken strips for him and macaroni for Teddy.
But why didn't he mind it? It wasn't like he liked being around Malfoy or anything. He guessed that it wasn't all bad compared to when he was just Harry.
Hayden desperately needed time for just himself, but he just couldn't seem to get that. Hayden made his way back into the common room from the library and immediately started to climb the stairs to the second floor.
Hayden almost dropped his wand in shock, horrified at the thought she knew of something so personal to him.
He smirked to himself as he thought of the upcoming year at Hogwarts, hoping he wouldn't have another life threatening situation and that he could finally have a somewhat normal year!
Not even half an hour later, Harry woke up with a searing pain rushing through his spine. He tried not to make any noise and yell out, but ultimately wasn't able to keep in the cries of pain that escaped his lips.
"For a sense of safety or even anonymity. You don't have to wear it if you don't want to, but it's here if you need it" Tom explained.
"Shut it. The only way we would be found if it was one of you ratting us out" the third man said, Hayden decided that he was the leader of the other two.
“A book” Hayden almost snapped impatiently. All he wanted to do was check the stupid book out so he could go back and read it in the common room while snuggled next to Draco in front of the fire.
He waited a couple minutes before leaving his hiding spot behind the bush, making sure that everyone had gone. He stretched for a minute before looking around the room.
“I think the look in Hayden’s eyes says something very different. I think it would do you good to let go of him” Viktor responded, watching as Cedric slowly leaned back and stepped away from Hayden.
Severus was curious as to what was on the paper, but was hesitant to look. After deliberating with himself, he reached over and picked up the paper before starting to read it, all the while still hugging Harry.
"I thought I had already told him that he needed to talk to you" Sev muttered under his breath in pure irritation.
Getting out of bed, he gently kissed the boy's forehead before starting his morning routine, all while trying not to wake him.
Before he knew it, Draco had stood up and was offering his hand to him. Hayden bit back a smile of his own as he took the blonde's hand. Draco gently pulled him to his feet before leading them both to the Great Hall.
"There's an after? What do you mean, it's not just a happily ever after?" Hayden gawked, he had absolutely no idea what more his mother could have to say on the matter.
Hayden pushed the feeling to the side, wanting to focus on the new day instead of his emotionally confusing night.
Once they were finally in the privacy of their own dorm, Hayden pushed Draco down onto the bed just so he cuddled up close next to the blond.
Once Hayden was calm again, his wings began to dim as they folded themselves back into their hiding spot. Draco admired the faint glow of the tattoo, framing where his wings lay against his skin.
Sorry for the chapter, but before I continue I have a question. In the next chapter, I'll be describing Hayden's outfit and there will be more outfits in the future. So, I've been wondering what you all prefer. Do you all like the dresses I've been using or should I start putting Hayden's in suits for special occasions? Any feedback you can give would be fantastic, thank you!
"Come on, leave already. One at a time" the leader said, ushering them towards the door. Soon they all managed to leave. Hayden wondered how they couldn't have been caught yet, but he guesses that's why he was there.
As if reading each others minds, they both unfurl their wings at once. Silver and gold feathers met as their wings curled slightly inward.
Hayden smiled as he finished reading. He hadn't heard from his father since he left for Hogwarts. He didn't even notice how much he missed him till he read the letter, strange considering their past relationship.
"I don't know why I ever thought your parents taught you anything. I am assuming you would like me to enlighten you as to what you have sentenced my son to?" Severus asked dryly. Draco looked down as he nodded lightly.
Now it was Hayden's turn. He slowly and hesitantly lowered his hand into the velvety bag, flinching a bit when he felt little sharp claws dig into his skin. He pulled the reptile out to reveal his dragon.
Harry tried to get up, he couldn't at first, but he tried again and he slightly managed to crawl back into the kitchen.
"No, I'm not ready, I really want to make a good impression, but I have no idea what to wear!" Hayden cried as rummaged through his wardrobe.
Once the girls had walked about a fourth of the way down the walkway they started to prance the rest of the way, greeting each side of the room in a sweeping motion.
“If you ever need help again, please do not hesitate to find me. Good night” he finished as he gently kissed the top of Hayden’s hand before leaving.
Harry looked at him, confused. The older man went ahead and led him into the bathroom so Harry could see himself in the mirror.
Tom smiled back at Hayden before running his hand through his son's hair. Soon enough, Tom walked through the door to the study with Hayden following behind him.
He had plenty of outfits to wear, both dresses and suits. He looked through the suits he had, but just wasn't in the mood to wear any of them so he turned to the other side of his closet where his dresses were.
Hayden blushed reading the letter. He folded it and put it with the other letter, shrinking the bad of candy and putting it in his satchel he brought with him.
"I had some questions, Professor Snape. I was hoping that you might be able to answer them for me?" Draco asked.
"I could show you if you wanted," he said as he brought his arm up to caress Hayden's cheek, his thumb rubbing soft circles into the underside of his jaw.
"Hayden, I am so happy for you!" Sev said as he hugged his son, After a moment, though, he let go and began to speak again.
"As I was saying" Voldemort continued, already annoyed with the crazed woman. "My child has finally come back home and will be joining our ranks. Everyone this is my child, Hayden"
His wandering thoughts though were answered as he opened the door to the sight of his son looking absolutely wrecked. Tears streamed down from his red puffy eyes in wet trails. His hair was all out of place and he looked like he had just sprinted the length of the castle to get there.
"Phoenixes are very stubborn creatures who are surprisingly very in touch with their feelings and the feelings of others. When they are rejected, they will emotionally shut off themselves. Has Hayden shown you his wings yet?" Draco nodded in conformation.
"You had a child!" Bellatrix screeched, utterly and completely shocked that her Lord Voldemort had a child!
He was now a couple inches taller (which he was more than thankful for) and his hair had grown out another inch, now reaching just below his shoulders. It hung similarly to his mothers, but was wavy like his fathers.
Harry almost flinched away from how loud she was being. He scurried away to the kitchen and got out three glasses. He filled each of them with orange juice and carefully picked all three of them up, walking slowly so as to not spill them.
Hayden quickly pulled his hand back, a fierce blush covering his face as he squeaked out a hello in return.
Hayden couldn’t have been more thankfully for this intervention, but now he had one more person to deal with. At this rate, Draco was going to panic and come looking for him.
Lots and lots of chocolate, the strange thing was, it looked like it was muggle chocolate and not the magical chocolate treats he was used to seeing in the wizarding world.
"Hayden, I would like to apologize to you face to face, not through a door. So, please, will you let me in?"
Hayden flopped down on the sofa, happy to finally have time to himself so that he could think and maybe even take a nap with the feeling of Draco's eyes on him. Not that he minded it, though.
"Draco, do you know what it means to be rejected by your mate? I don't suppose you do, do you?" Severus thought out loud.
"Oh yeah, Bellatrix, Narcissa, and Lucius" Hayden remembered. "Wait, I am meeting them now?" He panicked.
Hayden wasn't really paying attention to the speech, he did catch though something about a tournament and other schools coming? It didn't really matter.
"Hayden, I promise you, no matter what you say, nothing will change. I love you and that will never change" Draco tried to convince as he stood up before the raven.
Severus couldn't blame him. He remembered his inheritance quite clearly, it wasn't pleasant. He distantly wondered how much more pain Harry was going through considering he was going through a rather early inheritance.
So this chapter has some non-con. It mainly just forced kissing but there's a bit of unwanted touching as well, so if that bothers you or makes you uncomfortable you skim or skip entirely up until the last couple paragraphs of this chapter.
Hayden looked to Draco in confusion, he had no idea what this tournament was. Draco just looked back at him with poorly masked excitement before turning back to Dumbledore.
"You'll know. Besides, what fun is there in telling you when it would be much more amusing to watch you and your mate flounder your way to a confession" Sev laughed as he answered, running a hand through his son's hair.
"Wh-What? W-Why?" Hayden said, his voice hoarse from crying. His mate just looked back down him with a frightening scowl, causing Hayden to whimper in fear. His father walked up to him and knelt down next to him.
"I want to do everything I can to help you make the world a better place for the wizarding society and to make sure that it can become great again, like it once was. I want to follow in your footsteps. Before I found you again, I was constantly confused and never really knew what I stood for or what I thought in regards to the world, but now I know how twisted it is. I know that it needs to be fixed and that you can fix it. I want to help" Hayden finished, conviction and determination in his voice.
"Oh then please, enlighten me" Draco said as he crossed his arms, daring them to prove him wrong. Maybe he could trick them into giving him some sort of information regarding what Hayden had confessed to him.
“Granger here was just filling me in on everything I’ve missed. Apparently I can be second in the last task for the tournament. She was just telling me how much she and the other missed having me around” Hayden finished with a happy tone.
Harry mentally cursed himself for being so clumsy. Suddenly he heard one of the chairs screech against the floor as his Uncle Vernon stood up from the table, seething with anger towards Harry.
He looked around, quickly spotting the dark haired Slytherin girl he had followed, and walked up to her.
Draco continues to look Hayden in the eyes for a moment before telling him to wait there for a second and that he'll be back in a minute before leaving the bed and out the door of their room.
"What are you doing back out here? He kicked you out or something?" Blaise said once Draco reentered the large room.
Within the span of two months, Hayden became Toms official successor, but no one knew other than Voldemort's inner circle and other loyal followers, thus keeping him hidden from people like the Order of the Phoenix.
Draco's eyes sparkled at the answer. He almost couldn't believe that he was lucky enough to have someone as special as Hayden as his mate.
Sorry this chapter is so late! I wanted to get it out yesterday, but my WIFI had been down for the past couple days. Thankfully it just started working and now I can post this chapter for you all!
A cage caught his eyes as he looked at the window. It looked like an owl cage, and were those owl treats? Whose room was this?
Once he was done fixing his hair into a short french braid, he waited for his father to bring him down to the meeting.
"Where has he been? When can I meet him?" Tom almost choked out, tears now streaming down his face. He let go of Severus, looking him in the eyes, and waiting for an answer.
"Professor-" Harry began but was cut off when Snape shushed him. Harry looked at him with a confused expression.
“I love you” Draco murmured, gently kissing Hayden's forehead before resting his head on his mate's chest, listening to his heartbeat. The two breathed in silence, thinking over their newly shown problem.
Was it worth it to interrupt his class and let the boy suffer, or would it be in everybody's best interest to solve the problem Hayden was having.
Once they had apperated back they both had made sure that all of Hayden's new things were put away in their right places.
