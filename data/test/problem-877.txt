“It’s not my fault that it’s impossible to find a birthday present for you.” Harry crossed his arms, feigning indignation while his cheeks remained hot. “You have everything—and anything you need, you can buy yourself. I’ve been so stressed out for days thinking of what I could give you and I only could think of your new obsession with fancy cakes, but of course you can buy your cakes if you want—hell, you can even bake your own cakes, Draco—so I wondered how to make this special and…” He trailed, realizing how dumb he probably sounded now.
“What offer?”
It took Malfoy three seconds to process Harry’s words—Harry mentally counted it. And when the words finally seeped in, Harry witnessed as a blush slowly crept onto Malfoy’s pale cheeks. The shade gradually grew darker as the pinkish blush ended up almost beet red by the ninth count. It was such a stunning sight that Harry had to look away with his racing heart.
“No, no, this won’t do,” Gita sighed but she smiled in amusement. “I know this will happen, so I prepared something.” She showed them the little black bag she had been carrying and held it in front of Draco. “Here, take one.”
“You should’ve come to my room, Father. You told me to come to your room whenever I have a bad dream.”
He was still glaring angrily at the recipe book when a Floo sound came from the living room, followed by some rustling.
“I’m glad you’re finally here. Harry couldn’t stop talking about your arrival,” Gita said, her lips stretched into a cheeky grin.
“I’m close, Draco,” Harry moaned, his eyes shut tightly.
“I mean, look at you,” Harry said with a pout. Merlin, a
“And you have me, too,” Draco whispered. “I can’t imagine it means that much, but you do.”
By the time his senses fully returned to him, Harry felt Malfoy still on top of him.
Draco shifted a little to look at Harry. “What—”
“Harry,” Draco shook his head, his hands found their way to rest on Harry’s thighs, “one of the reasons I was down on one knee to acquire your hand in marriage was that Witch Weekly wouldn’t stop choosing you as the most eligible bachelor, and I was getting so sick of it.”
Harry nodded. “And when do you have to be there?”
Harry turned to frown at Hermione with a dejected and betrayed look. His friends really had put him through this. Whether he was deserving or not, he would hold this against them for a while.
He glanced at Malfoy walking by his side. Even the thick and slippery snow under his fancy boots couldn’t hinder him from walking gracefully in his very distinctly aristocratic manner, and it annoyed Harry to no end. He had fallen down face first twice since they started investigating the area and slipped more than he cared to count. He was supposed to have the best balance in the entire DMLE, yet here was Malfoy steady on his feet as though he was strutting on a catwalk.
has to start before sunset.”
It turned out to be a bit of a mistake.
It didn’t faze Malfoy in the slightest. He seemed to be ready to argue with an uninvited guest in his room at any time of the day. “Well, the Headmistress would beg to differ. Would you like to see my teaching contract she signed?”
Ron hadn’t been happy about it, he complained Hermione had almost no time for him as it was without having any competitor in studying and he was upset Malfoy encouraged her to spare even less. Malfoy made it up for him by being the only worthy opponent in Ron’s chess games. Ron was a bit reluctant at first, but he seemed to be thinking that if he couldn’t get Hermione’s attention, he might as well play chess with the blond rather than dying from boredom. A few games later, the two of them had built something resembling a friendship that was based almost entirely on the petty rivalry from their chess tournaments.
“I’m fine,” lied Harry, twisting his body to hide his obvious erection.
“Fine,” Harry huffed. “Consider this a bonus point for you before I mercilessly beat you.”
Hermione hummed. “Yeah, that would be very useful for our Charm project. I think I saw some books on that topic, I’ll get them next time I go to the library.” She pulled out her quill and began to scribble a reminder on the back of her palm like she always did.
“Ah, right, so the ball is magically created for children games like this. You can throw it as hard as you want and you won’t hurt the person who gets hit. Though, it will give you a temporary purple stain to make sure you can’t pretend it misses you.”
It was also really nice having Malfoy slowly regaining his old self. He talked more and became a lot more expressive than when he first started the year. He grew comfortable enough around them that he would harmlessly insult any of them in between their conversations, not unlike the old days but at the same time completely different.
he was. Considering Hermione’s flushed face, Harry started to accept that maybe he did have a problem to be solved.
“It's ancient magic, basically just taking advantage of the blood relation between parents and their children. Very simple in theory, really, but many wizarding communities don’t use it. I don’t know why, all you need are just magic, familial bond, and deep love for your child,” Gita explained, voice wistful, as she tilted her head toward the starry night with a smile. “I remember when Meme used to send me across the village to play dodgeball with my friends and then had me Apparate back for dinner.”
Harry stopped. He thought about the days they spent together, with Draco among them. The leisure walks they took around the castle when they were all too sick with revising and studying and the warm evenings when they just curled up in front of the fireplace in the common room, surrounded by unread books. But certain memories pushed their way to the front of his mind. The lazy mornings when Draco nudged him awake with a bright smile, his face open and free. The peaceful nights when they lied on their respective beds, talking about nothing and everything until they both fell asleep, not ever knowing who was first. He then thought about Draco and his odd little slap bracelets he subtly used to show that he cared about them. Of course, a prat was not a correct description for him anymore.
“It can’t be right,” he said, a little choked out. “He couldn’t have mentioned me in his will. That’s… that’s just not possible.”
“By living in the moment. Right now.” Because now was the only thing they had. If not now, when? “We travelled so far, let’s stay here for now. In the present.”
What should someone do when their crush was inches away and asking for a kiss? Harry didn’t know, so he just nodded, stunned and a little more than dazed.
True to his words, Harry immediately acted on the command he received. Harry, who prided himself on always working efficiently, used his right hand to quickly lube up his hard cock while at the same time bent Draco’s legs up with the other, arranging him into position. In no time, Draco felt the tip of Harry’s cock against his waiting entrance.
“Guesses?” Harry had raised his eyebrows at him. “See, even you don’t believe I get this. You expect me to guess at the test.”
“In his room, taking a nap,” said Astoria. “Are you going to be fine?”
A tinkling laugh came from Draco. “Harry,” he said his name with so much affection mixed with incredulity that Harry’s chest felt like bursting. “Here’s to the infinite possible ways to like you.”
Draco stared at the wizard in front of him. He was tall and broad, dark hair slicked back neatly. Maybe around forty, Draco wondered, but it was hard to tell about a magical person who diligently took care of their appearance. And this one was indeed that kind of wizard. That much was clear from the way he presented himself, sitting stiffly on one of the Malfoy Manor’s settees, back straight. He was wearing a set of formal law robes which were only permitted to those licensed to practice. He was dressed to intimidate and impress people at the same time.
Still, Harry never once woke up before Draco. Every morning, Draco had about half an hour or so to himself before his husband would stir from his slumber and notice his absence. Usually, Draco would make a cup of tea and sit silently on the balcony of their tiny but cozy apartment in the middle of buzzing London, watching the city lazily rise to life. It was a peaceful moment of much-needed tranquility before Draco had to head out for his long and tedious job in his Potions lab.
Harry could already tell the conversation was going in a bad direction, so he turned around and called Hedwig over.
After finding out that mandrake properties change drastically depending on if they were cut with silver or iron knives, Harry knew he had to ask Malfoy to sum it up. The textbook was too confusing, and he kept getting distracted by the conversations around him.
“Hi, uh, I’m supposed to deliver this to Neville Longbottom and Harry Po…” Her voice went quieter and her face redder as she stared at Harry. He had definitely seen her before, but when?
"Not able to follow simple instructions, why am I not surprised?" Draco grinned. "Well, despite your lack of brains, you managed. It looks good."
Draco leaned even closer, his next words almost tangible over Harry's lips, “
Draco walked in as if the others were invisible, silver eyes too interested in the Room. “This is rather impressive, Scarhead,” he mused, sounding like he meant it.
Harry had to agree. Malfoy hadn’t sneered at him since their fourth meeting at the owlery, when their silence had been broken and a bottle of ink had been offered. Harry supposed it was due to the weird truce they had, but the blond hadn’t gone out of his way to say anything to Ron or Hermione either. Harry was truly grateful for that because if he did he would have to stop talking to him.
Ron stood up to pat him on the shoulder. “Listen, mate, whatever it is, it’s no use worrying about it so much. Just wait until he writes back, it can’t be long. I’m sure the Aurors will finish their inspection soon.”
“Let’s get to the point here,” cut in Sirius with another chuckle. “Have you had
“I’m helping Ron practise before the real practice” explained Harry sheepishly. “It’s going to be his first one as our Keeper-"
Despite Harry’s confusion, Blaise didn’t seem bothered by the odd question. “She has just returned from her honeymoon in Greece. Couldn’t be happier,” he answered smoothly.
“Er, yeah, that’s what she said, Ron.”
“Not letting anyone know what spell you are casting until you do it.” Harry felt some sort of vindictive pleasure when Snape’s eyes narrowed. He would have to thank Tonks for her book, especially now that his answer had managed to annoy Snape.
“It must have been the old age,” whispered Draco softly, making Harry look at him. “I have always thought he was a bit loony. This just proves it further."
“That’s stupid,” said Harry.
,” said Hermione, sounding very offended. Then she huffed and glared at her book, mumbling, “It’s just taking a
right when he was young. We all did,” he said. “The point I’m trying to make is that they are still young. And if James-"
“Where is Hagrid?” asked Hermione, bringing Harry’s attention back to the class.
“Not now.” Draco’s tone was cutting, and made Harry halt in surprise. But then Draco blinked, and his eyes fell at the corners. When he spoke again, his voice had softened, “... Later, yes?”
"Of course she is," whispered Draco in his ear, making a shiver run up Harry's spine. "It was only a matter of time. Her performance under Umbridge's examination has been nothing but poor, you said so yourself."
“That was odd,” he said aloud and Hedwig chirped in agreement. He stared at the envelope. The white expensive stationery with the Malfoy seal was the same as always, but there was no elegant handwriting over it.
Harry felt every single blood cell go to his face. “No!”
“Not anymore,” said Harry. Which was true. Snape had all but disappeared, and Harry was definitely not about to go searching for him. Umbridge had made sure it was an awful night for a lot of people, he had seen Parvati and Lavender cry along with Trelawney, but at least something good had come out of it. And against that woman, he would take every win.
The Gryffindors had welcomed him to the common room with a loud celebration that carried into the late night. And Ron had apologised to him and explained that, in a convoluted way, he had tried to help. Harry thought it was stupid, and told him so, but he was happy to have his friend back.
“And narrow-minded,” added Luna, shaking her head sadly. “Must be the Wrackspurts."
“No!” blurted Harry. It stopped Draco from noticing the poster, but now he was looking at him in alarmed confusion. “I mean, er,” Harry fumbled for words while the blond kept silent, waiting for an answer, “the
“Mate,” Ron broke his line of thought, his uncertain voice making Harry realise he had probably gone quieter for longer than he should have. “You good?”
“Kinda bossy, isn’t he?” commented Sirius, and Harry turned to find him standing just by the entrance. “A bit prissy too."
Lee scrunched his nose as if in disgust. "Yeah, but Slytherins?"
"Malfoy?" asks Harry, his eyes fixed on the white ones, and the ears of the wolf press downwards and it takes another step back. It looks wary, almost afraid of Harry, but it doesn't run. There is no hostility, no sign of danger at all, and Harry remembers seeing Malfoy with Snape on the map every night leading to this one.
Draco blinked at him. "Potter-"
The big doors to the Hall were wide open, and from the stairs Harry could see it bubbling with energy, as the students talked to each other over the noise, some even having stood from their tables to talk to their friends, bringing their copies of the Prophet with them.
“I wouldn’t forget that,” said Harry. “But, Draco, you said we couldn’t-”
Draco waited until he was gone before turning to Harry again. “Are you sure about this?"
“Hermione asked me to meet her here at midday,” said Harry.
The blond’s carefree mood dissipated when Harry kept disarming him rather easily again and again.
? Is she alright?
Thankfully, Umbridge and her awful pink cardigan were nowhere in sight, letting Harry, Ron and Hermione let out a relieved sigh.
someone spying on you inside Hogwarts."
Sirius barked, “Oh, shut it! We are doing fine, aren’t we?” He stood up from the couch and signalled at Harry to follow him out. “Now, help me prepare dinner.”
Draco raised an eyebrow in amusement. “Oh? Do tell."
Harry frowned. “What? Why only us?”
Sirius blinked. “Why wouldn’t I be? Why are you all here?” He looked around the room, gaze travelling from the Gryffindors to stop at Umbridge. “Is that Umbridge? Did you-?
Draco looked up at him with a smile. “Yes, it actually reminds me of one of the rooms back at home."
“Sirius, I really don’t think it’s a good idea,” said Hermione.
"If you sign this," Hermione's expression and voice were all business, "You are promising not to betray us."
I was.”
Harry laughed. “He isn’t going to tell, Hermione," he said, but Hermione didn't seem amused at all.
“How noble of you." Malfoy scoffed. "Do you want a prize?”
Draco’s eyes widened slightly. “
“As painful as it may be, do not mention my name in your meeting,” said Draco slowly. He raised an eyebrow when Harry looked dismayed. “Not what you were expecting?"
“Well, after last night we know that plenty of our housemates are hoping he doesn’t,” chimed in Dean.
Harry grinned. “Then where would you like to go?” he asked, feeling his chest warm at the idea of going out again. “For a date, I mean.”
“It’s fine, we will see him today, right?” he said to Hedwig, who merely blinked at him. “And we will finally talk…” Harry frowned down at the book. He had been waiting to talk to Draco for two months, but now that the moment had arrived...
"Quiet," said Harry, leading them towards a corner of the room. Once there, Hermione took out the parchment and a quill and placed both on a small table that appeared out of nowhere.
Malfoy scowled at him but turned away. Harry watched as he seemed to fiddle with a piece of parchment, lips pursed in frustration. Harry remembered last week and let out a sigh.
The familiar
” repeated Harry in disbelief, but Draco didn’t stop this time, and the door began to slide open. Desperation tore through him. “Draco, I
Hermione’s gaze was calculating, looking at Ron as if he were a puzzle. Harry looked between the two of them, managing to catch the moment realisation hit Hermione’s brown eyes. “This isn’t about the Slytherins,” she mused, and her face softened. “Ron, you don’t have to feel envious. I-”
"I'm sure it's fine," said Harry. Then he added, "Are you and Parkinson-?"
"Skeeter," said Harry, too tired to elaborate.
Harry's eyes widened. "No, no." He shook his head. "No. Strictly business- Er, champion business."
“I’ll say whatever I want!” yells Malfoy, trying to no avail to free himself and then closing his other hand in a fist that Harry stops from meeting his face just in time by holding onto the wrist. “Get your dirty hands off me, Potter! Haven’t you done enough? My life is over,” Malfoy’s voice takes a desperate edge and his eyes remind Harry of the sea during a storm, “My parents can’t even look at me, I’m not their son anymore but a filthy creature-” Harry is startled when Malfoy lets out a wry laugh. “Is that it, then, Potter? You like me now that I have become filthy, like that mudblood you like so much?”
Draco dropped Harry’s hand, discreetly leaving his side along with the Slytherins, quickly enough to be standing away when the woman reached the front of the class. She was wearing a green hat that reminded Harry of Fudge’s.
-” His eyes flickered to Harry “-lack.”
“Every colour is my colour,” said Draco haughtily. From the smile on his face and the slight raise of his chin, Harry could tell he was terribly pleased by that comment. Harry was reminded of his Patronus and smiled, it was sort of endearing. “Well, what else did you do? Besides giving your teacher a makeover.”
“Is that why you were staring at him today?”
Harry looked at him. “Did you want to?" he asked.
“You are dead!” yelled one of them, but there were no jinxes uttered and as Harry rounded a corner, he saw why. Nott and Draco were glaring at one another, each held back by Crabbe and Goyle respectively. “Let me go, Vincent!” snapped Nott. “You know what he has done!”

one?”
said the gesture, and just like most of the things Draco silently offered, Harry felt compelled to accept.
“Alright, so use it-” The blond halted, eyebrows rising in realization before settling into a frown. “No,
"I imagine she is," said Lupin, and Ginny, Hermione and Mrs Weasley exchanged a look.
. But save your flattery for later, I assume you are going to be needing help with your essay."
“Yes, because I had to stay in to crack the egg.”
“Right, we don’t want to break curfew,” said Harry, picking up his things and standing up.
"Hi," said Draco, looking around the room that was filled with cushions. "More Stunning today?"
Harry looked at him in the eyes. “I do.”
it said, and under were the brief words of Fudge saying the same thing. They were good news, but the looks both Slytherins were sending him said the opposite so he kept reading.
“Bill asked what happened with you and Sirius,” said Hermione from across the table. “And Ron snitched."
“This
“You shouldn’t have,” said Draco, scrunching his nose. “But I do understand why you might have thought so." He glanced at Harry and sighed, “I’m just trying to stay on her good side, that’s all."
Harry blinked. "Sorry?" he offered, not sure of how he was making things hard at all.
But then Fay had approached them at the common room that same night. She gave them an uncertain smile when they looked up at her.
But there had been a sharp intake of air from Malfoy and Harry looked as the first white beams of moonlight slipped through the gaps of the walls, sealing his fate. Malfoy had stepped back, as if trying to run from them, but then he had frozen on the spot, eyes fixed on a gap of the wall, and his body had started to shudder.
Hermione nodded. “We tried to ask Parkinson about it but she all but ignored us when the meeting was over. She didn’t really look pleased to see us- Harry, where are you going?”
Harry hadn’t wiped the smile off his face when people started pouring into the room, covered in snow and carrying what they had bought. Some looked at him weirdly, Seamus straight out asked him if he was okay, but he couldn’t be bothered but to raise his hand in a vague greeting.
The envelope had been left alone on Harry’s desk since it arrived. He had recognized the elegant scrawl and frozen on the spot, feeling his stomach sink. Harry hadn’t replied to the last one yet, so Draco must have heard what happened, if not from the Prophet then from his father.
"Because he is a moron," said Malfoy, the familiar sneer back on his face. "I did warn you about choosing the wrong sort."
Draco was waiting for them by the exit of the field. “How’s the head, Harry?” he grinned.
“It wasn’t every day.” It was
“Or you could just write what you dream." Draco went back to his essay. “Just an idea."
“That isn’t the worst he has done,” said Hermione, surprisingly calm. “When Ron and I found out, we were upset."
The girl gave him a mischievous grin. "I'm just here to ask you about Vincent's swing."
“Kinda hard not to, mate. It’s everywhere.”
One line. The letter only had one singular short line, only eleven words that formed a straight to the point message, yet Harry had never obsessed over a text so much. He had spent so many hours staring at it the past four days he half-expected the message to have been engraved behind his eyelids.
Harry rubbed his neck. “Just the one about the hopping pot.”
“You are not going to back down, are you?” said Sirius, running a hand through his hair. “Why this boy, Harry? There will be others. You are still young."
Sirius gave him a surprisingly chastising look. “Now, now, isn’t that a bit selfish? If you care about Draco, you will sit here and listen to what Moony has to say. You wouldn’t want to hurt him, would you?”
Harry gulped again. “I just want to say,” he said and licked his lips. “That for the record,
King’s Cross looked grim under the cloudy sky of London, just like the faces of the Aurors in black suits waiting for them by the entrance. One of them attempted to haul Harry by the arm to escort him inside, but Sirius scowled at him.
. What the hell, Harry?”
“Yes?” asked Harry, trying to sound casual.
“Of course, but I’ll have to try it tomorrow,” said the blond, reaching to hold Harry’s hand. “Right now, I have to talk to you."
He sat on the bed again, resting his head on his hands. “Be reasonable, Harry, he’s probably unable to answer for some motive. Perhaps it’s his mom.” He stood up again. “Yes, that must be it, perhaps his mom found out and she doesn’t like it. Or perhaps he doesn’t want her to find out now that his dad is in prison, yeah, maybe it’s that-”
One class they had worked with crups, creatures that looked exactly like Jack Russell dogs with the exception of the split tail. The ones Hagrid had brought were young and quite small, definitely to reduce the risk even more. Harry had seen Umbridge’s cat-temple she called an office, so he wasn’t surprised when she sneered rather rudely at the crups. But then, as to prove what an awful human being she was, she had poked a white crup with her wand and made it float to examine it.
"Draco?" he said and as if summoned the blond appeared from around the corner, going so fast he almost crashed into the wall. With panicked arm swings, he recovered his balance and straightened his path, eyes widening when they found Harry.
Specifically, what he was thinking about Lucius Malfoy.
"What?" asked Harry as he sat down.
“Grimmauld Place,” hissed Harry at the flames, low enough so no one would hear. The orange flames flickered green and he turned to look up at Draco. The blond was staring at the fireplace without moving and Harry wanted to ask what was wrong but he didn’t have the time. “Draco-”
Dudley seemed curious again. “What’s his name?”
Harry reeled back. “What? Why not?”
"You could help Diggory, then," teased Harry.
Harry let himself be pulled to his feet. “I’m not making any promises."
Parkinson perked up and looked at Zabini with wide amused eyes. “You are right! What do you think could have messed up his face like that? He looks like he got in a fight and lost." The bruises that Hagrid had on his face on Saturday hadn’t faded yet, somehow looking even worse and being another reason for Harry to worry about Umbridge’s inspection.
“So chivalrous,” mused Draco, coming to stop just a few steps before the end. He looked at the sleeping Fat Lady, “So this is the famous portrait, I heard she is an awful singer." The portrait let out a loud snore as in response and Draco scrunched his nose in distaste, then turning to look up at Harry. “Well, off to bed with you."
“That’s what Molly said. Er, Ron’s mom” said Harry awkwardly.
Harry was rooted on his spot, feeling troubled, because for a moment he had wanted to go after him, but that was
“Yes,” agreed Ron. “But this girlfriend of yours sounds kinda
Hermione was looking at him in surprise. “Very well put, Ronald,” she said softly before beaming at him, then turning towards the rest. “I fully agree."
“I beg
“Yes, Hermione, he did.” Sirius patted him on the shoulder. “You stay here, alright? I want to go talk to the twins. Have you seen them, Ron?”
“Hi?” said Harry, turning to look at his friends. The way Ron chuckled was enough to tell. “Let me guess."
“It’s not Madam Puddifoot’s, right?” asked Draco, nose scrunched in distaste. “Because that place is
They finally reached the path to the cave. It was a bit hidden, and rocky, but not dangerous. Draco let Harry lead him near the entrance, but stopped before going in, looking warily at the space.
Harry frowned. “There’s nothing wrong with that”
"But…" Harry caught his words and sighed. It just didn't make sense to him. "It was just so…
Cheers came from the sea of green and silver as the Quaffle zoomed past Ron and through the centre hoop. Harry flew past the crowd, momentarily surprised when he noticed a quite big snake head among the Slytherins, then noticing the blonde hair under it. “Fall off your broom, Potter!” yelled Pansy, standing by the edge of one box with Luna, who waved at him cheerily, her weird hat hissing.
There was a pause, then Nott's voice returned, cold and menacing, “I’m keeping my word, Draco, as long as you do the same." After that, Nott appeared from behind the shelf again, sparing Hermione and Harry one last dark look before walking away. Draco followed, not saying anything as he started packing his things, shoulders tense and eyebrows furrowed.
, no,” started Draco with a malicious grin, then stopping himself. He cleared his throat and smiled innocently. “But that’s not important, love. Keep telling me how brilliant I am."
, thought Harry.
Sirius grinned. “See you, Harry. I hope you recover from the
Harry blinked. It was the same one Draco used, yet more controlled and terribly off-putting. The resemblance to his son was clear, but there was a stark difference between them, one that Harry could see but not put into words.
Harry hummed. He hadn’t seen the thestrals, and they were classified as dangerous, but the idea buggered him. He didn't quite believe it was them the ones that had done it.
The lingering flavour of the toffee was sweet, tasting even sweeter when Draco parted his lips, one hand resting on the back of Harry’s head as he kissed him back. It was a sweet, warm heat that made Harry’s head feel light, and he leaned closer, wanting to get a better taste, occurring to him that it was better than any candy. But then the other lips were backing away, making Harry chase them down, not realizing where he was going until the hand on the back of his head seemed to pull him down. The kiss broke as they lost balance and fell, Harry’s hands on either side of Draco, who blinked up at him, pale hair like a white halo against the blue cushion.
To his merit, the other seemed as surprised to see him as he was. Malfoy halted on his steps as their eyes crossed and his head actually reared back a little before he seemed to recover and his lips curled up in a sneer, which in turn made Harry frown.
you to tell me where Sirius Black is.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione made a beeline to one of the tables with a captured bowtruckle. They listened to Umbridge question Grubbly-Plank on Hagrid’s whereabouts, to which the professor replied she didn’t know, then started the class. They were supposed to watch over the bowtruckle’s escape from the cage, to learn about their lock-picking abilities. It sounded interesting, but Harry’s attention kept going back to Umbridge, who walked around the class asking questions to the students.
He extended his hand to Harry, who shook it firmly. They nodded at each other, and with that last confirmation, Harry grinned and went for the Cup.
“It’s not her,” said Harry with a smile, keeping an eye on the figure as it approached with a tankard on his big hands. “Hagrid,” he called as the Groundskeeper passed by their table. “Hi.”
Malfoy brushed rogue feathers from his coat because he was a narcissist and even if he was about to get covered in snow after passing the entrance, god forbid he wasn’t the picture of neatness.

you,” he said slowly. “Are you forgetting things? Should I call Pomfrey?”
“What?” he asked warily. Sirius was trying not to laugh, and that couldn’t be good. Especially next to a serious Lupin. “Did I do something?”
“I do not,” retorted Draco immediately. “It just happens to be the best one.”
Snape’s eyes flashed dangerously. “Out,” he said through gritted teeth, and Harry had never seen the man so angry before. “Now.”
“Better for

“Give me the spines.”
Malfoy frowned. “It’s your fault.”
Hermione looked pained. “No,
Once Harry finished reading it, and writing a bit more on his own essay, he handed it back carefully. Malfoy took it without a word and put it back in his bag. Then he stood up, primly dusting off the snow from his pants before heading towards the stairs. He paused by the exit and threw Harry a weird look.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” answered Draco looking ahead. “What better place to celebrate Valentines than Madam Puddifoot's?” He glanced sideways at Harry and snickered at his expression. “Look at your face, I was just joking. I’d rather go visit your
“I know you didn’t tell her.”
“Sounds good, I’ll go-"
“Oh, so you don’t,” cut in Parkinson. “Yet you seem so sure of yourself. A bit arrogant if you ask me."
Ron snorted, and just in time because Angelina blew the whistle for the match to start and Harry had to let the snitch go and zoom after it.
"Listen, Malfoy. I hate you," he said. The blond raised an expectant eyebrow in such an infuriating way that Harry thought about forgetting the terrible idea that he had and kicking the blond off the tower.
"She is getting sacked," said a posh voice, whose owner was almost hit in the nose when Harry turned around quickly to look at him. "Careful, Scarhead," hissed Draco, still accepting his hand into his own.
There were a million questions on his head and they were all about
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Are you going to duel him for Valentine's?"
They stood there, looking as the bird made another circle around the room, majestic and unbothered by its surroundings. A very regal animal that suited Draco perfectly. “It’s an albino,” said Draco, then rolling his eyes when Harry looked at him doubtfully. “I know all Patronuses are white, but I’m sure that this one is an albino." He brought a hand to Harry’s hair, threading through it gently. “We have those at home."
Umbridge gave her a patronizing smile, “As long as you have studied the theory well enough-"
“Me?” Harry raised his eyebrows.
"So what are you going to do today?" asked Hermione, bringing Harry's attention back to her. She gave him a sly smile. "First Valentine's and all."
thing-”
Harry did. “Not your waist?"
” retorted Draco, with a hint of bitterness on his voice. For a brief moment he paused, eerily still, and when he turned to smile at Harry there was an intensity in his silver eyes. “Sleep easy, love,” he said, the wish sounding like a promise.
“Is it the
“I’ve got that taken care of,” said Draco haughtily. “I have other business to attend to.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s alright, I’ll do something else. Like, uh, live a lavish life doing nothing.”
“It’s not a hippogriff,” jabbed Harry when Draco dubiously raised a hand towards its head, but part of him shared the uncertainty. It felt private.
Besides, they are gone now.”
“Yeah,” Sirius nodded. “But not relating to Draco. It was about Lucius and nothing you might want to hear, Harry.”
“I thought you were a Death Eater,” says Harry before he can stop himself.
Dudley's eyes went from the rude message on the badge to Harry’s face. “I don’t think your boyfriend likes you very much.”
“These are
Figuring he might as well sleep too, Harry sighs to himself in resignation and shifts a bit to make himself more comfortable. He debates what to do with his hands, before deciding to place one on Malfoy's head, the other on the bed next to him.
Harry stands around a corner, trying to not make a single sound. He had been expecting many things when he started following Malfoy around, like another broken nose or the possibility that Malfoy really was a Death Eater, then a fight to stop whatever he was up to disappearing some nights with Snape, or skipping classes and even meals.
"She looks beautiful," said Parvati.
“No one,” muttered Harry. His wand had already been taken from him by Umbridge and a scuffle to his right told him Hermione had been captured too.
The second time he woke up, it was on his own volition. The morning light had already started to pour from the windows, and silence ruled over the Hospital Wing. He grabbed his glasses and noticed the sleeping figures of his friends, sitting on chairs and leaning onto the other.
He looked up at the sounds of chairs moving. Class was clearing out, the other students walking out of the room with sullen expressions, many throwing Harry jealous glares. One of them was Nott, the expression on his face absolutely murderous. That made Harry feel even better, but then, he looked at Draco and his bubble burst in a single pop.
Harry turned to look at him. “Are you going to sign?"
office.”
“What’s the ruckus about?" asked Parkinson disdainfully. "I’ll deduct points for screaming down the halls."
Draco kept looking at him with pained eyes.
Draco ignored him and raised his arm, pointing at the doll with his wand. "Is this alright, then?"
“No,” cut in Draco. “Harry, she is
“Harry,” he breathed out, sounding as if he had been running. His hair was in disarray, and his face was paler than usual, which was saying a lot. His grey eyes quickly studied Harry, before the blond’s tensed shoulders sagged in relief. “You are alright.”
is my business, Granger."
Everyone looked at him as if he were stupid.
"What took you so long, Harry?" asked Hermione, not really looking at him as she checked the many books he had brought back.
What he felt for Draco; the fascination he felt when he saw his silver eyes, the warm feeling on his chest when he heard his laugh, the calm when he heard his voice, the yearning when he wasn’t around, the distress when he was distressed, the craving for his touches. All those feelings and more, so complex and overwhelming, making things hard but also better, brighter, hopeful.
“That’s forty-nil to Slytherin- Come on, Gryffindor!"
“Are you alright?” came Angelina’s voice. Harry glanced to his left and saw the captain offering a hand, which he gladly accepted. Angelina pulled him to his feet and gave him a careful look.
Instead of a dressing down, below Harry’s name was a line that relieved his tension.
families,” continued Fred, accompanying the snobbish tone with a raised pinky. “All purebloods live like this Harry, so you better get used to dust and decapitated house-elves."
"And we were thinking that we need another teacher," continued Hermione slowly.
Harry smiled to himself as they started talking, resting his head on his arms as he watched over them. Of course, like any reasonable person listening to a conversation about numbers, he quickly fell asleep.
The adults exchanged an amused glance. “We knew that, Harry,” said Lupin.
“It’s Felix Felicis!” said Hermione. “Also known as liquid luck! It makes you lucky!”
"Thank you," he said, accepting the package. What was embarrassing was how nice it felt. Harry was just beginning to open the book when he saw a flash of blond hair by the Floo.
They walked up the stairs in silence, and just before the painting Hermione gave him a worried look. “Do you think they won?” she asked, nodding her head towards the entrance.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Someone is a bit late."
"That sucks," groaned Ron.
“No, I don’t,” said Draco, grinning at Harry’s confusion. “But nevermind that, love, there’s something else I need to tell you." As Ron and Hermione bickered about Michael Corner, Draco locked arms with Harry and leaned closer, whispering as they walked. “And there’s a
“What’s the hold-up, Scarhead?” called a voice behind them.
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed the cushion, turning around to place it on the top of a big pile, making sure it wouldn’t fall. When he returned, Draco was walking around the Room again. Even after coming many times before, he still seemed drawn to it, taking his time to examine every column, artefact, book or object the Room provided.
“No, no. I mean, I’m not going to Hogsmeade tomorrow” explained Harry. “I planned to stay and try to solve the egg thing, since the Task is-”
“He needed you to grab something from him, and when you didn’t show up he went and did it by himself, because only you and him can access it.”
. Did you tell Crabbe how to aim?"
Harry turned towards the woman. “Professor, that’s Malfoy,” he whispered.
“Your handwriting is atrocious,” finally commented Malfoy, handing the parchment back to him. “And you forgot the write about its healing properties. The professor mentioned them in class- Ah, right. It was after you left."
Ron looked at him weirdly. “You did it the same day Snape assigned it?”
Hermione frowned. “She shouldn’t have a reason to place him under surveillance, unless he has told her what he did... Or perhaps she knows and doesn’t want Draco to keep contacting Harry, or-”
“Yes, alright,” sighed Harry, looking at him. “Very Slytherin of you."
The pain from a hardcover book hitting his head was a welcomed distraction.
Sirius narrowed his eyes. “It will be fine as long as
Hermione chuckled. “Your mother will be very happy when she finds out you are a fan of Celestina too.”
Ron blinked. “You know who he is?”
Draco shivered, "I hope not. I don't want to see any dead creatures besides that cow- Harry,
The Slytherin members hadn’t done the same. Not exactly. Parkinson had been ecstatic about it, telling Harry that The Quibbler had never sold as much and Luna was overjoyed, Zabini had snickered and told Harry he was quite sneaky for a Gryffindor and Crabbe and Goyle had confessed to not having read the article. “But I did read the one on Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” had said Goyle, looking proud of himself and receiving a wide smile from Luna.
On Sunday, Harry spent the day following Draco around the library. The blond had turned out to be quite studious, maybe as much as Hermione, and wanted to get ahead before classes began.
“Only know flashy things that got no real use for anybody,” muttered Hermione.
“Who’s your friend, Harry?” asked Tonks, a grin stretching her lips.
“I’m aware."
"Obviously," said Parkinson, exchanging an exasperated look with her friends.
Harry looked at Draco again, the blond giving him the same shake of his head, but then adding a flicker of his eyes towards Goyle.
“It’s not a matter of being good or bad company, I know it must be hard for you,” he said honestly, his words making Draco stop and look at him. Harry rubbed his neck. “I just want to be there for you. I promised I would. Even if it’s just sitting in silence, as long as it’s with you, I want it. ”
“Not now,” Draco agreed. He shook his head and turned to Harry. “I better go talk to Theodore.”
“Tell me.” Draco’s voice was cold, indifferent to the way the elf flinched as if he wanted to get away but was stuck to the floor. “Tell me right now. I’m ordering you-”
“Alright,” said Harry, still a bit dazed. “Goodbye, sir."
“Potter,” hissed a voice and Harry’s attention was pulled back to the group. Moody was studying him, following Harry’s former line of sight and frowning.
Harry had always known the Slytherin was good at Potions. After all, he was Snape’s golden student for a reason besides blatant house favouritism. But Harry had never noticed how comfortable Malfoy looked during Potions. Each movement seemed rehearsed, no stutters, no moments of hesitation. The checking of the instructions feeling more like a formality than a necessity for him. His pale face was focused. Not scared like Neville’s or concerned like Hermione’s. Focused. Ready. Framed by the toxic fumes quite artly-
“A door, at the end of the hallway." Big and dark and always out of reach.
“No bad experiences, then?”
Luna giggled. “No, Neville. They are just dating."
Silver light poured from the end of his wand, stronger than before and startling both of them when instead of growing in a wide circle, it moved away, making a slow circle around the room as it took form.
“I know, right?! It’s not fair he is
They were among the last to arrive at the Common Room, but Harry was the first to the dorm. While everyone had stayed downstairs to catch up with their friends, he had walked up the stairs and closed the door behind him.
“And she is smart!” added Hermione.
“No, not really.” Draco gave him an odd look. “I had thought about it before."
“Not exactly. Zoos are in the cities, and the animals are usually kept on small enclosures for people to see.”
Parkinson had given him a really nasty glare the first time he greeted Draco at class and kept doing so every day after that. Zabini had told him that she would warm up to him. Harry thought Zabini was a rotten liar but figured he wouldn't tell him that.
“I mean, I heard that’s where couples usually go,” continued Draco, probably not liking Harry’s silence. “But I think I’d rather have a picnic with you on the Shrieking Shack than set foot in that horrid place."
“There’s no need now that Umbridge is one, is there?”
“Could be useful." Draco hummed. “Besides, I wouldn’t mind getting ahead on my NEWTs."
“That was before you lead us out of the village,” said Draco seriously. “Unless you are planning for a picnic, I don’t see what we are doing here."
Harry was surprised but managed to keep a neutral expression and followed him a bit further from the group. He glanced back and found them sneering, probably waiting for whatever Malfoy was up to.
"She’s staying with you?" asked Harry.
"Blaise Zabini is quite good looking as well," mumbled a third-year girl shyly.
“Few days before the end of term,” said Ginny, recrossing her arms again and looking at one corner of the room.
Draco tilted his head. “But surely you had some cases of accidental magic before that, right? All wizards exhibit their potential before the age of seven.”
“Charming offer,” deadpanned Draco, a tint of his cheeks Harry knew wasn't just because of the cold. “But I stand for what I said then, and I feel like having a Butterbear right now.”
Draco hadn't even waited for Umbridge to hit the floor before approaching Harry and was already helping him to his feet. “She had an alarm here," he explained. "We couldn’t stop her."
“You will notice,” said Snape, his tone perhaps a bit more bitter than usual, “that we have a guest with us today."
badge.
“Don’t fucking say that!” cuts him off Harry, hardening his grip on Malfoy’s wrist until the blond winces again, because he is not just insulting himself, but also Lupin.
Harry stood up, one hand holding on the scarf tightly as he looked at his godfather. Sirius seemed concerned now, his dark eyebrows furrowed as he approached Harry carefully. “The vision I had, it wasn’t just as if I was witnessing it,” said Harry. His throat felt suddenly dry, but he kept going, “I
Ron didn’t finish it. “Fine, whatever... but he isn’t good looking!”
Harry was slumped on his seat by the window, not paying attention to Neville’s conversation with Ginny. Even after walking all the way back to find a compartment, he hadn’t seen Draco. Not even in Zabini’s compartment, which he was sharing with other Slytherins. Zabini had only grinned at him in an infuriating way when Harry walked by, so he had chosen not to ask him anything.
“Ah, and Regulus Black.” Slughorn finally managed to catch Harry’s attention again as he signalled at a portrait of what must have been the Slytherin Quidditch team.
“It’s a
Ron grabbed it, not looking at it as he raised an eyebrow at his friends. “It’s not that I don’t want to read your love letters, Harry, but I don’t.” He dropped his smile when he saw the message, and behind him Ginny was frowning too. “There’s no love here.”
Taking it as a cue to drop the subject, Harry approached the blond, letting his knowledge of Defense take charge. He hummed in consideration, moving Draco's arm an inch to the left. "Let's see you try."
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione glared at him. “You do know he means Harry only, right?"
Draco raised a finger. “An
“So…” Ron shuffled on his seat, cleared his throat and asked, “...How are you feeling, mate?
Ron seemed scandalised, and last night’s mental picture of him clutching his pearls made Harry snort into his juice. “What are you talking about?” Ron whispered harshly, looking from side to side and if scared of others hearing. “Hermione, they are
Crabbe shrugged. “I reckon they are just dumb."
The blond turned around so quickly Harry worried for his neck. “Yes?” he said, looking up at Harry expectantly.
And then Draco was the only Slytherin standing in front of all the Gryffindors, that kept exchanging uncertain looks between them. Harry’s hand didn’t leave Draco’s shoulder and the other went to hold his arm, but he still had no idea what to say.
Harry looked at his hands, so empty at the moment. “I love him,” he said as he flexed his fingers, and wasn’t even surprised by how natural the words sounded to him. After all, he had already said them aloud before, just not to anyone else. His eyes flickered up and met Hermione’s again, and then he did feel slightly embarrassed.
“It’s cold every day, Harry. It’s winter."
“Harry,” corrected Harry.
“Like as a date?” said Ron. He laughed at Harry’s surprised face. “Mate, it was totally a date”.
“Why would it be-” Harry squeezed his eyes closed. “Kingsley told you.”
“So chivalrous,” mused the blond, sounding quite pleased. He then flashed Harry a grin that made the hardship of balancing two owl cages as well as his luggage worth it.
“They left after Weasley stopped dropping the Quaffle, said it was too boring,” drawled Draco. “Personally, I found the nose bleeding interesting. Is that a new tactic you are trying? Bleeding on your opponents?"
Harry frowned. “No-"
“Forgive me if I don’t trust the judgment of a bunch of teenagers, Harry,” said Remus sternly, gesturing at him to sit back down again. “And I bet all your friends will soon have a talk with their own guardians, if they haven’t already. I was just talking to Molly and she said she would be talking with Ron and Ginny as well.”
Draco kept writing to his parents, judging from the letters he received at breakfast every few days. Harry anxiously waited for the moment the owls flew over them because when Draco looked down at his letters, a small smile would grow on his lips.
"I do," sighed Harry.
“Harry!” said Sirius, a tad too cheerfully. “There you are.”
"Harry, aren't you saying too much?" That was Ron's voice. Harry looked at him and Hermione, finding them sending wary looks at the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle seemed completely lost, but Parkinson’s eyes were wide and Nott’s jaw was clenched. Harry was fine with Parkinson hearing, but Nott-
Harry frowned. “I don’t-"
“Draco,” Narcissa Malfoy spoke softly, her pale hand rising to squeeze Draco’s arm with the same affection her voice conveyed. “What’s wrong, my dear?”
“Along with some other members of my House. Umbridge has given us the mission of finding the
Harry hummed in disbelief and looked up, suddenly aware of the extra inches the blond had on him. "What did your father say?" he found himself asking.
Harry smiled stupidly all the way to the castle, and only let go of the blond’s hand when they reached the Great Hall. He sighed as Draco drifted towards the Slytherin table, along with Parkinson and Luna, who seemed to be in the middle of a conversation.
What Draco wanted was rather unexpected. “I need you to trust me with this, can you do that?"
,” said Draco, giving him a light shove. “So on you go, to class with the madwoman."
As he took another sip of his juice, Harry let his eyes wander towards the Slytherin table, briefly irritated by how far it was.
"Yes, sir," said Harry, being careful to not step on the small remains of mechanical dummies as walked towards him. He let himself plop down on the cushion and scooted closer until their knees touched, watching as Draco undid the lace of the rather fancy looking box. “What is that?"
for a second that you have tricked me. I know the truth, which is that you betrayed all of us just to get on Umbridge’s good side.”
?” He tugged at Harry, “The Ministry already has a campaign against him. They would jump at the opportunity to give him something worse than a Hearing!"
Yup... Well, uhm, hope you liked the chapter? Please let me know!
"And you hate me. But I do enjoy the quietness here and, apparently, so do you. So if you could maybe not-" Harry looked for other words apart from
like that woman, Granger."
Sirius finally stopped snickering about god-knows-what and cleared his throat. “Yes, we should get going. Me and Remus have to find Harry’s aunt and uncle,” he gave Harry a wide grin, “and give them the good news.”
about this?”
Silence followed as Draco seemed to consider his words, head tilted the way it did whenever he was in deep thought. “I see,” said the blond, bringing a hand to cup Harry’s face, his thumb moving to caress his cheek. “You and I together. Back to back against Umbridge...Is that what you want?”
“Draco.” Harry paused, looking for the best way to explain the entire Occlumency business before figuring that he should just say the truth. Even if it was
A million ideas passed through Harry's head, until one jumped to the front, sparkling and promising.
Harry saw Ron’s face do a little twitch at the mention of the discussion, so he jumped in before he had any chance to revisit the subject of a certain blond. “Angelina placed her name in, right? I think she would be a great choice.”
“I do know,” said Draco in a low voice. He was still looking at Hagrid’s bruises and cuts. “Did the thestrals do that?” he asked carefully, as if afraid of the answer.
“Really? Well, congratulations, Harry, my boy!” said Slughorn, and Harry could almost see his brain searching for Quidditch related people to show off.
“Your hair is a mess,” was the first thing Draco said when they parted and Harry rolled his eyes fondly at that before attempting to look at the mirror. “No, no,” Draco stopped him and brought his hands to Harry’s dark hair. “I’ll do it.”
Little by little, the chairs around the space began to fill. Starting with Neville, Dean, Lavender, Parvati and Padma, followed by Fay, Angelina, Katie and Alicia. Then walked in Ginny, who beamed after glancing around the room and rushed in with Michael Corner, Justin, Ernie and a Hufflepuff boy Harry didn’t know.
“And from a professor that isn’t rubbish,” added Ron.
“Here, just let me show you,” resolved Harry, taking out the golden egg and opening it.
They turned towards the door, Draco nudging Harry to go first and check. Figuring he owned him for having the twins set the thing after him, Harry conceded. “Haven’t heard it in a while,” he said, placing a hand on the doorknob. With a last glance at Draco, he opened it. The hall was empty, the only remains of the fireworks being a faint smell of smoke and burned paper. “The coast is clear.”
Parkinson sneered. “I reckon it’s her hair."
Harry’s relief was washed away. “Snape? He’s the one watching over him?”
“Of course, professor,” said Draco with a charming smile that seemed to please the woman. Then, as soon as she left, the blond turned to his friends and rolled his eyes theatrically. Parkinson snickered as the rest of the Slytherins shared a complicit grin, then going back to their examination of the bowtruckle. It was clear that for them the sudden change wasn’t nearly as puzzling as it was to Harry.
Harry frowned. “She is?”
“AH!” exclaimed Trelawney, making Ron jump and Harry ready himself for yet another death premonition. She pointed at Harry. “You, my child, I see misfortune in your way. Terrible things await."
As Draco told Zabini that he was
“Perhaps you should try another one.” Harry eyed the stag as it stopped its throttling and vanished in a thin cloud. “A happier one."
“All for Potter,” spat Nott. “Who is probably up there celebrating your father’s incarceration with the rest of the scum. Oh, you are so fucking pathetic, Draco-”
“I see."
?” he said, looking at Draco. There was a part of him that was starting to suspect Slughorn had done it on purpose. But why? It made no sense. Hermione was uncharacteristically unhelpful and only gave him a sad look, which he couldn’t question in time before the class began.
“Right," Harry forced a smile, "well I have to go meet Hermione, so-”
” he read aloud in amusement. “Is this your way of telling me my hair needs gel?”
Harry, Ron and Hermione sighed in relief when he left, to the amusement of the Slytherins.
“Do you think he knows?” said Goyle to Crabbe, only receiving a shrug in answer.
Harry felt his jaw clench. If it were for him, he would already be gone, but it was the start of term and he needed the stupid class schedule, which meant he was stuck at Gryffindor’s table, hearing others go on about his life.
?” Draco frowned at him. “What are you talking about?”
Harry held his arms, squeezing them lightly. "I am taking this seriously, I promise. I'll ask Neville tonight, I'm sure he will be happy to help and bring out all the books he has and won't let me sleep until he tells me all about Mandrakes."
“Nargles, probably." Draco smiled at him. There was something about the Room that suited him perfectly, as if it had been tailored for him. Perhaps it was the tall ceilings and immaculate mirror walls, or the elegant atmosphere that resulted strangely eerie. Or maybe it was just Draco himself, who carried an air of importance that made it look as if he owned any place he set foot in. Be it the library, owlery, or even the forest.
Harry glared at Ron. “If she says I’m going to die-."
thought Harry, his hand clenching into a fist under the table. Anger had brimmed up again. Anger at their fathers, at the war, at Voldemort and at himself for not being able to find a good answer. One year ago he would have made the decision in a heartbeat, but now it was different.
Ron shrugged. “I’ve stopped questioning things at this point."
“Yes, I know, but listen,” Blaise raised his hands in front of him and spoke slowly. “If Draco didn’t go looking for you it must be for a reason, right? So why not change into your robes, get off the train, have a nice dinner and then let Draco get to you?”
His back was against the wall, his head slightly crooked forwards from the low ceiling. There was a pink tint on his face, not out of place because they were very close, chests pressing into each other. It felt like a standstill again, Draco blinking at him and Harry not moving from when he had him pinned
Harry flushed. “Shut up, you know that wasn’t the case."
“We don’t know that.” Harry frowned. “Besides, I trust you.”
“Not immediately,” said Lupin with a grimace. “There are still some matters to clear up, but it will probably just take a week or so.”
“Are you done now?” asked Parkinson as she and Luna followed Draco down the hallway. Her tone was teasing like the light shove she gave the blond. “Or do you need to help him on his broom too?"
“But, are you alright?”
group to study Defense."
Hermione sighed, grabbing her books and standing up. “I don’t know, Harry-” Something made her pause when her eyes passed over the window, and she quickly approached it to take a better look. Before Harry could ask or join her, his friend turned around with a bright smile. “Hagrid’s back!"
“Regulus, Bellatrix and her husband. I’m not sure if Narcissa is one, but her husband is,” muttered Sirius. “And the rest of them, the one’s without burned names, might not have been Death Eaters, but they danced to the same tune: the purification of the Wizarding race." Sirius looked away from the tapestry and faced Harry. “This is a war, Harry, and these people-” He placed a hand on the tapestry “-are our enemy."
“You don’t know either,” protested Draco, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh at how easy it was to rile him up sometimes. “Why were you thinking about that, anyway?” continued Draco. “Thinking about becoming a Magizoologist?"
Draco nodded. “Your grandfather.”
The jump back was just as harsh, and Harry fell to his knees before the stands. There was dirt on his mouth, and grime on his face, from the soil of the graveyard. The cheering of the crowd was loud, but muffled to him, as his mind kept reeling back what just had happened.
, but yes,” said Dean, pointing his chin towards the mentioned boy. At first glance, Neville seemed very focused on harvesting his Bouncing Bulbs, but the pink tinge on his cheeks and the furtive glances he kept stealing from Hannah were quite revealing. It was due to luck that said girl hadn’t noticed.
But it had to be done. And Gryffindors were supposed to be bold and that.
“Why?” asked Harry with a grin. "Want me to show off?"
Harry let himself fall back on the horrid pink carpet as he took in what the elf had said, his heart feeling as if it had stilled after a long run at once, his breath just as missing. “He is safe,” he said under his breath.
favour I need to ask you."
“He’s back,” said Harry, when Dumbledore reached him and grabbed him by the shoulders. “Voldemort is back,” he repeated.
“That makes two of us.”
Ron came near him to watch over his shoulder as Harry opened the paper, which was crumpled under a clenched fist as soon as Harry spotted the headline of Skeeter’s new article.
Harry’s eyes widened in realisation.
"Thank Godric," muttered Ginny, sounding quite relieved.
“Yes, so romantic,” repeated the twins. “True romance in our times."
Draco took a moment to answer, looking not at Harry but around the hallway. Whatever he wanted to say, it seemed he didn't want anyone to listen. “Not here, do we have a meeting planned tonight?"
“Shut up,” mumbled Draco, falling quiet when his pale hand passed through the silvery mist, not dissolving the form but enveloping his hand on the silver light. He rubbed his fingers as if feeling the fabric of something. “It’s warm."
“Nice catch, Scarhead!” called the blond when he noticed Harry’s eyes on him.
he found out about the plot at the Ministry.” The Headmaster was now looking at Harry curiously.
“The freckles,” explained Harry, pulling his hand back. “I like them."
“Oh, that." Harry felt relieved. He had thought it was something bad, but Draco probably just wanted to start with the Patronus. Unfortunately, Dumbledore and Snape had other plans for him, and Harry had to sigh. “No, I can’t tonight."
For a moment, Hagrid only looked at him in the same way Harry had seen him looking at creatures before. Then he nodded. “Awful woman,” he agreed, voice gruff but sounding a bit lighter. “I’ll be seeing you two,” he repeated. “Take care.”
“Perhaps a bit too much,” said Zabini enigmatically.
Harry smiled. “In that case, let’s get started at once."
It was just as they arrived that he realised he had a room of his own and would be able to show it to his friends. “Uh.” There was a lump on his throat, so he stayed quiet as pushed the door.
." He then looked at the rest of the table, finding them giving him worried looks. Making an effort, he swallowed his anger and gave them a nod. “Thank you for listening to me. I’ll go to sleep now."
"Don't mind him, Neville," said Harry, grabbing his bag. He leaned in and whispered, "I'm sure he is angry because he hasn't found a date to the Ball yet. Not like you, huh? Hannah Abbott, right?"
The bricks finished shifting, revealing a quite changed Diagon Alley. Just the sight of it seemed to dampen Sirius’ mood, as he dropped his grin and led them in quietly. Harry could understand how his godfather felt. It was as if a cloud had fallen upon the street, everything looking distinctly less alive. Many shops were closed, their showcases empty and windows hastily covered with wooden planks.
Harry did as he asked and sat down next to him while he examined the cloak. “Merlin, I wanted one of these but my father didn’t budge,” said Draco, rubbing the fabric between his fingers. “What is it made of? Demiguise?”
“...I could
“No, there’s no need,” said Harry quickly. Knowing Mundungus, it could either be something stolen or something he shouldn’t have as a minor. “Really-”
“No, Vincent is right,” said Draco. He turned to look at Harry. “Today we are finishing the Strengthening Solution. Do
Truthfully, Harry missed him, too. He missed the fun and witty Draco, full of odd but charming energy. He missed the subtly but confidently caring Draco. Above all, he missed Draco’s happy and open smile, his sure and unapologetic gestures.
Properly jerking himself off now, Harry tried to remember one of the things he overheard about Malfoy amid the haze of his arousal. Someone had said Malfoy smells citrusy. Sweet and fresh, they said. Harry absently wondered if it’s true since he couldn’t have known himself. Every time Malfoy’s scent reached his nose, his brain would immediately short circuit and he couldn’t think properly, let alone distinguish what the man smelled like.
If anyone told Draco twenty years ago that this was where he would end up when he reached forty, he would probably suggest they get their head checked. Things just didn’t work like that, he would say. If the Saviour with Death Eater concept was not ridiculous enough, it was him and Harry Potter, for Merlin’s sake. They were bitter rivals, each other’s archenemy. The two of them being together was simply illogical.
They came to demand an answer Draco didn’t have.
They were heading toward something, Draco could tell. What that thing was, Draco didn’t know. And he didn’t care. He was ready to dive into anything right now.
“Harry… not talk to anyone after you go. For some days. He stay alone in his house.” Draco threw a side glance at her to see the girl pursing her mouth. “But then he go out again. I remember he come here a lot to play with us.”
Darkness had almost fully fallen by now, the sun had completely retreated to the horizon, leaving Harry and Draco with the last hue of orange lingering in the sky. Draco closed his eyes, intently listening to the gentle sound of the waves crashing, the whispers of the breeze, the even breaths Harry took next to him—very noticeable with how the man was pressed close to his side, his strong arm circling Draco’s shoulders.
His thrusts were getting harder, almost desperate. Harry pulled himself up to his elbows on each of Draco’s head, pressing their foreheads together. Against his lips, he whispered, “call me by your name.”
It seemed like Malfoy was not the only one who was completely unimpressed with his attempt. Without looking up from her buttered toast, Parkinson snorted. “Come off it, Potter, leave Draco alone. He’s taken, you know.”
A violent shiver ran through Draco’s spine, not expecting such a question spoken with so much fervor. Had he? Draco couldn’t remember. He might have, in one of their wilder nights, when the two of them were too far gone to filter their words, too deprived of touch that they didn’t try to hold back. But it was different. In those nights, there was nothing but lust. Nothing but feral need, desperation, and exhaustion. They said things they barely meant, and neither made a big deal of it. Hence why Draco couldn’t be sure if Harry had told him that before.
Pretty much short of other options, Draco tried to execute his plan. He skirted the edge of the court and quickly distanced himself from the square, just far enough that the opponents would take his bait. It worked. A boy threw the ball to him, which he swiftly dodged. With all his might, Draco sped to the square.
The air outside the castle was a little cold but crisp, as though the weather was not yet sure with the transition from winter to spring. And, true to Harry’s words, the sky was very clear. No cloud could be seen, the almost full moon shining with pride. It was bright enough that neither of them bothered with Lumos, their path was sufficiently illuminated by moonlight and the faint glow from the night activities inside the castle.
Harry’s heart clenched at the sight of him. Draco didn’t look particularly sad. If anything, the blond looked confused. And lost. A strong urge to wrap him in his arms overwhelmed Harry.
“I’ll stay with you after this. After N.E.W.T.s. I’ll stay with you wherever they put you for the community service.”
Harry had it in himself to look guilty. “I thought we could ride the last wave of this passion as long as the time allowed. I thought… we both understood that this is not going to last. We promised before, didn’t we?”
In the comfort solitude inside the cottage, Draco took a deep breath and finally opened the journal, right in the middle when Potter first started taking over the book.
Draco still couldn’t believe it. “But how can they Apparate? How can young children stabilize their magic to do something as advanced as Apparition?”
Harry hadn’t really thought about it. Malfoy had just always been Malfoy to him for years. But thinking about it now, Draco didn’t sound too bad. In fact, it seemed more fitting. It sounded so much softer, more approachable. Much like his demeanour these days. Like Draco.
“Granger, Weasley,” he politely greeted with a nod.
Harry didn’t expect that the friendship he so wished would start from something as absurd as a Muggle toy lying on his desk.
Right now, as he embraced the darkness that began to fall on them as the sun had completely retreated for the day, Draco couldn’t remember one single reason for what this had to be a mere farewell between him and Harry. He wanted this forever. He wanted Harry, now and always.
“You’re so hot, Potter. So good,” Malfoy groaned next to his ear, making him moan in reply.
And something shifted, too, between Malfoy and the Golden Trio. It was as if being trusted by Harry had given him a green light to step up their friendship. Harry could feel it, the difference happened in the blond’s behaviour around them. There was something softer in it, warmer. Their interactions became more intimate instead of simply practical. It was like Malfoy had allowed himself to
“Hey!” protested Harry.
Malfoy stared at him as though Harry had just transformed into a house-elf right in front of his eyes. If Harry had to be honest, that confused expression was an adorable look on Malfoy. “And why is that?” Malfoy eventually asked.
“How are you going to show me, exactly?” Harry asked, frowning despite the obvious interest.
But still. It felt almost real here, and Draco would take anything he could get, any last moment he could have. If they had to part ways soon, he at least wanted to have this for now.
Draco stared at him. Harry. Oh, sweet Harry. How far he would go to make this good for him. Harry didn’t owe him anything, and Draco owed him
All he knew was that Malfoy smelled fucking delicious and he wanted to devour the man. Or have Malfoy devour him. That definitely sounded better in Harry’s head. He stroked himself faster, stopping his effort to block certain grey eyes that popped up in his mind.
“As you can probably tell,” Malfoy said, his tone conversational despite the rough edge in his voice after the intense sex. “I can’t pull out yet. It might get a bit uncomfortable after a while, I hope you don’t mind.”
From his seat, Draco could see Weasley and Granger gritting their jaws, still not pleased with the offer but maybe considering it was the most reasonable one they could get. Draco understood, in some ways, that this was hardly about Potter’s old stuff and more about Draco of all people being mentioned in his will. But, as Astoria said, what would they do now?
Seemingly not taking the hint, Harry kept walking closer. “It’s not about me, Draco, it’s—”
He called this upon himself, Draco knew a long time ago. He signed up for this, and he had been willing to pay for the consequences. It didn’t make the heartbreak he knew was bound to happen any less painful.
Arching his brow in question, Draco crossed his arms and prompted him to go on with whatever he wanted to say.
What was
He tightened his embrace and Draco sighed.
Draco was a man of big gestures. Everyone who knew him certainly must have a word or two to comment on his dramatic ways to express himself. To make people notice his strong presence. Harry remembered Hogwarts, his total dedication to do the stupid shenanigans just to capture other students’ attention, particularly Harry's.
“Is something wrong, Harry?”
Some truths were better hidden forever.
For a second, Harry wasn’t sure what it was all about until he felt the cock in him pulse. Gasping for breath, Harry clenched his ass, squeezing Malfoy’s growing length. Behind him, Malfoy groaned from the pressure.
?” he asked incredulously.
"People wonder if Potter planned the time of his death years ago. With the fact that he cut ties with all his friends here makes it even stranger. But no one can think why he would do that." Astoria paused to look at Draco. "I mean, if he really planned everything before he went away, he was doing it while he still had contacts with his friends—but they are all clueless about it."
When McGonagall decided to room him with Malfoy during his return to the Eighth year, Harry was bracing himself for the inevitable disaster that was bound to happen.
They walked to the end of the aisle hand in hand, eyes never leaving the other’s. It was admittedly a little awkward to hold eye contact while walking together, but that was the only thing grounding Harry to the moment, to the man next to him. He refused to look anywhere else and Draco obliged with his kind smile.
If Hermione was mad before, now she was furious. “Harry would fail his N.E.W.T.s at this rate,” she hissed. “But you don’t even care, do you? You never cared about him!”
“No,” Harry answered and immediately winced as she poked his ribcage.
Following Harry’s gesture, Draco turned his head to see a girl half running towards them, her excitedly waving hand almost in sync with her swinging ponytail.
The four of them sat together in the common room, surrounded by a few piles of books as they always did every evening these days. Malfoy, true to his words, helped Harry catch up with his studying, patiently explaining everything Harry didn’t understand and assisting him in organizing his goals. Tonight, though, Harry was left on his accord to write a review work on his Charm lesson while Malfoy worked on his own assignment. Hermione was deep in her Arithmancy book and Ron lounged next to her since he finished his work of the day early, as unusual as it was.
“You can open your eyes.”
Snuggling closer, Draco hummed in affirmation.
Harry let out another incredulous laugh. “It’s weirdly fascinating, though. You should suggest George produce it for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.”
Narrowing his eyes, Malfoy paused for a moment before slumping in his chair with another sigh. “What do you want from me now, Potter?”
Harry doesn't let him finish as he captures those glossy lips with his own.
In the second week, Harry had enough of the thick awkwardness and decided to start initiating small talks with his new roommate. Malfoy was very wary at first, but as the time went, he eventually eased into somewhat civil interactions with Harry. A month into the arrangement, they threw each other polite greetings on a daily basis and sometimes even discussed a little bit about their schoolwork.
“No, you’ll leave—”
Lately, he preferred to avoid thinking about it entirely and keep his mind preoccupied with other probably equally pressing issues. Like evaluating Malfoy’s presence in his life.
Harry gritted his teeth.
“Should we save a spot for you and Meme?” Draco asked.
Harry’s heart constricted at the sight of his boyfriend so tired and deflated. And all because of his utter stupidity and lack of thinking. He didn’t know what got into him today. Maybe it was the fact that lately, life had been quite calm and uneventful, he jumped at an opportunity for danger. It was easy to forget that there was the small group of people that for some unknown reasons wanted to harm him, silently lurking in society. Most of them were not even Voldemort’s supporters anymore, they were the relatives or friends of the Death Eaters Harry had hunted down during his Auror years.
It was seven years ago. Draco should have known it was too much to ask for him to move on and leave everything in the past.
“Snap out of it, Potter, it’s not Dark Magic.” Harry turned to Malfoy when he felt a hand on his upper arm. “You’re overreacting, it’s just diamond dust.”
“You’re right.” Harry paused and sighed. “We promised to not talk about our past, didn’t we?”
The old witch cried her final incantation with her loud, shrieking voice.
“That’s it, Harry. You’re almost there. Come for me,” Malfoy whispered, his tone low.
The whole time, Malfoy didn’t spare him a glance.
A nod, a polite smile, sometimes a quick
“Yeah. Harry has been at it for days now.” Ron threw him an accusing look. “This is like Sixth year all over again but weirder. And worse, I suppose.”
Malfoy hummed and snuggled closer to his back. “What about
Silence fell between them once again. The sun had sunk deeper by now, halfway into the horizon, their surroundings getting darker. Draco glanced at Harry, noticing how he still didn’t try to talk with his eyes intently on the retreating sun. He was still letting him to question.
It took Draco a few seconds to understand that Gita had commanded her students to choose the team they wanted, and the result was somewhat unbalanced. Most of the girls wanted to be in the same group as Draco, while most boys chose Harry—either because they didn’t want to follow the girls or because they thought having Harry as their team leader would be more beneficial, which was kind of insulting to Draco. He might not look as strong as Harry at a glance, but he was confident he could beat the man in a ball game.
“No,” Engel replied. “He died in a marine accident when he sailed in his conservatory voyage in the Arafuru sea.”
Draco smiled. “Yes. How are the fields?”
? Was Harry resurrected from death? What did it mean that he died before his time? How could it happen like that? One minute of thinking about that was enough to make Draco’s head spin. With some reluctance, he let that one part go. Maybe some things were meant to remain unexplainable, just like the magic that ran through his blood—a mystery forever.
Draco walked to the tiny desk under the window, touching the closed drawer where he remembered leaving his journal in. If someone asked him, Draco probably could recite the conversation he had with Potter at this desk over seven years ago. It felt like yesterday.
The first entry in his journal. Draco remembered it so well. He remembered shakily holding the untouched journal right after Harry cut him open, literally, and Severus knitted him back together just in time. He remembered how he recounted the event in great details—the dim bathroom, his failed attempt to use a Cruciatus on Harry, Severus’ shouts. Draco put everything in words, missing nothing but his own feelings as it played out—the aftermath shock had numbed him from feeling any emotion at the moment.
“No,” Draco said, ignoring the fear growing within him that Harry wasn’t on the same page as him. “I said I was getting married because I didn’t know what I wanted to do.” He stopped to inhale deeply. “I know now.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please, Harry.” He said. Harry had to fight down his unnecessary blush from the way his name rolled in Draco’s tongue. Friends call each other with their given names, he reminded himself. There was no need to react like that. “It said educated guesses. Let’s be honest, you might not be able to cover all the materials for your Potions N.E.W.T, but you should aim to learn enough of them to make educated guesses.” He paused to think. “Actually, let’s make it your strategy for this particular subject.”
“Harry!” Draco cried as his orgasm tore through him, entire body overcome with spasms as he shot long stripes of hot come across Harry’s chest.
As it turned out, he had nothing to worry about as the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s curse-breaking teams worked closely and frequently with the Aurors. In this way Harry continued to keep an eye on Draco’s momentum, which eventually grew into an impressive list of accomplishments just a few short years later. As arrogant as Draco was, Harry couldn’t deny he had earned his recognition through hard work and proving naysayers wrong. Five years into their careers, Draco was one of the best curse-breakers under the Ministry’s employ - and not a single soul could argue against that.
“Fine,” he said after another short eternity. “It’s your fantasy. You want me to do it, I’ll do it.”
“We arrived via portkey last night then spent the morning investigating the Mirror,” Draco explained. “Something caused it to go berserk and we were pulled inside so I suppose that’s where we’ve been. But seeing as it’s still night time we’ve only been gone what, six, maybe eight hours tops?”
“But you ‘never want to see me again’?” Harry quoted.
“I don’t get you!” he shouted. “What do you want from me?”
“Uh, glad to see the mission was a success,” Ron coughed. “But Robards and Kingsley have been worried sick. I mean, we all have. ‘Mione’s been crying her eyes out.”
He dragged his hands through the soft blonde locks he had always dreamed of touching, pulling it free from its confines and reveling in the beautifully disheveled sight. Draco’s eyes were unfocused - dark grey rings around pupils blown wide - but he never closed them or looked away from Harry’s face.
Hoping that his famed Gryffindor courage wasn’t about to start the worst duel in the history of all magic, Harry left his room and knocked on Draco’s door before he could stop himself.
“Suck.”
“I see us spending Christmas at the Burrow. George and Ginny are playing some kind of practical joke on you, but you take it in stride and get them back just as good later and I’ve never been prouder.”
“And it hurt, Harry. It hurt so badly. I don’t ever want to feel that way again.”
Harry looked away for a moment, rubbing his eyes from beneath his glasses and trying to control his emotions.
“You’re really pissing me off,” Harry snarled.
He finally withdrew his fingers and proceeded to lube himself up. This whole time Harry had been rock hard but seeing Draco laid out in front of him - thoroughly debauched by his own hands - sent a fresh wave of arousal straight to his cock. He lifted one long leg over his shoulder, kissing it tenderly, and spread the other out to the side. Harry gently nudged at Draco’s entrance, slowly making his way inside.
Harry was, however, just as surprised as everyone else when Draco announced he would also be applying to the Auror training program alongside Harry and Ron. It was the hot topic following their graduation since many people believed the heir to the Malfoy estate was harboring ill intentions while others took it a step further and petitioned to reopen his case, wanting to see him rot in Azkaban like his father. But despite it being a highly controversial decision, unable to deny his impeccable aptitude test results, the Ministry’s Auror Office accepted Draco’s application and he was officially a part of the new training class.
“Fuck,” Harry gasped, a shudder running down the entire length of his spine.
“What’s wrong? Are you hurt?”
“We will be doing nothing!” Draco interjected. “I am fully prepared to die in this godforsaken hellscape, so good luck to you Potter, ta and thanks ever so!”
He tried to ignore the heat of Draco’s body against his as they stood together to apparate, both springing away immediately when they arrived at their destination. The two wizards could feel the dense wards surrounding the old barn, but pushed past them and entered to find themselves before a large arched structure covered with a thick cloth that was heavily laden with spells. Harry’s mood lowered even more considering what he would most likely see if he looked in the Mirror of Erised now, but resolutely shook the painful thought from his head to focus on the job at hand. He left Draco to set up his instruments and equipment, opting to return outside to check the perimeter and reinforce the wards.
They weren’t friends. In fact, they rarely ever spoke except in reference to Hermione’s whereabouts. The war was simply too recent and their wounds were only just beginning to scab over. Everyone could tell that for the most part Draco was on his best behavior and consequently was a muted, more subdued version of his past self - which for some reason left Harry feeling quite unsettled. But there was peace, albeit tentatively, and for that he was grateful.
“Okay, Jesus, I got it!”
Harry counted to three in his head and took a deep breath before responding, trying his best to not let Draco get under his skin.
He grinned and tenderly brushed back the loose strands of hair that had fallen around Draco’s face before kissing him deeply on the mouth. Draco broke away after a few moments, lips swollen and shiny from having finally met their match.
Draco, finding himself free of his bindings, was the first to recover. He immediately rolled away from Harry as if the other was on fire, righting his clothes and swaying dangerously to his feet.
“Hold on a bit longer for me.”
“You...want to play quidditch?” Harry asked. “It’s been a while but I’m sure I can still beat you easily,” he chuckled.
“I’m not mad at you.”
The two were suddenly launched through the air, Harry wrapping himself around Draco as much as he could to protect him from whatever was happening. With a sickening crack they broke through something solid and razor sharp, cutting at their skin and clothes. They flew through until once more they landed on familiar, old floorboards, with glittering fragments of glass raining down around them.
“Guess I’m not doing my job properly if you can still mouth off.”
“Malfoy, please. Can we talk?”
Two sets of eyes - one pair wide and a vivid emerald green while the other was narrowed and could have been carved out of cold, grey marble - focused on the gruff Head Auror, taking in his serious and no-nonsense countenance.
A near-deafening sound cut through the air, halfway between a blood-curdling shriek and an equally painful scraping. Harry leaned in close to Draco’s ear, shouting over the din.
Now that Harry was standing in front of Draco, he realized he had no idea what to say.
“I don’t! That’s not- You’re wrong,” Draco yelled, shoving Harry back so that he was standing in front of the table, creating some semblance of distance between them.
Draco sat hunched over on a long wooden bench with his head in his hands. Harry sighed in relief as he stood up and walked over, taking in the rest of their surroundings. It wasn’t just a bathroom, but a locker room to be precise. Even more specifically, Harry recognized it from Hogwarts - they were in the quidditch team locker rooms, but he could see no exit in sight.
“We’ll have to get up eventually. At the very least to clean ourselves.”
“It’s not- You’re not the bad guy!” Draco cried, covering his eyes with one hand as tears flowed down his reddened cheeks. “It’s me, alright? It’s always been me, Harry. Me wanting you. Me not deserving you.”
Draco rolled his eyes and exited the lift, striding away toward the floos.
With a quirk on his lips, Harry complied, wandlessly spelling them clean. Draco let out a contented sigh, cuddling up against Harry’s warm body properly.
Unable to respond, Draco settled for leveling a conceited glare at the dark-haired man who now looked to be capable of spitting fire. Deep within Harry’s mind, a small voice was telling him to get a grip and try to figure something else out, but he couldn’t hear it over the roaring in his ears which was drowning out all other thoughts. He felt like he was slowly losing control over his own body, watching almost as a spectator as he roughly pushed Draco down to his knees. With surprisingly steady hands he unzipped his trousers and pulled out his cock, which was already half-hard and growing.
“Exactly!” Draco hissed, breaking away from Harry. “We are who we are and we’re in this thrice-damned Mirror! I know it’s a challenge but try and use what little powers of deduction you might possess.” He started pacing again and said darkly, “Don’t worry, Potter, I’ll even let you do the honors if you like. Go ahead and AK me, I give you my full permission.”
“Wait, you’re not leaving now, right?”
“The calf-eteria.”
. Or, when Malfoy didn’t care enough to pretend to act decently polite, an arch of his pale eyebrow. Those were all the interactions Harry had had with Malfoy so far, and it was so
“Wait until he teaches you how to actually ride it, dear. Your father is quite an aviator. The Seeker in him never dies,” Astoria teased.
And Draco did, eyes instantly on the new piece of flimsy parchment curled on his wrist. Harry’s creation was not exactly a thing of beauty. It was almost haphazardly made, messy around the edges and one end couldn’t even curl properly. In his defense, Harry tried his best. He was just never an expert in Transfiguration.
Draco hummed and scooted over even closer until their sides were pressing. “You do mind?” he asked in a low voice.
Harry responded by clenching his ass on nothing, and yes, he was just as slick—if not more than before. “
Okay, maybe Harry paid him
If Gita noticed something shifted between Draco and Harry the next day, she didn’t mention it.
Harry wanted to be a reason for Malfoy to smile like that again. It was normal to want a smile on your friend’s face, right? For now, Harry was sure he wanted to be Malfoy’s friend. The warm feeling in his chest whenever the blonde was near might indicate something else, something stronger, and Harry would love to explore it if Malfoy gave him a chance.
“If you had time to calculate the risk of your jump, you would have Apparated out of there,” she retorted. “The building wasn’t warded.”
He felt Harry almost scrambled to reach for his hand, gripping it in his. One glance at Harry’s face was enough to tell him that Harry felt the same thing, the green eyes were wide open in wonder and disbelief. Draco scooted closer to press the side of his body to Harry’s until he couldn’t tell who was shivering from the two of them. Maybe they were both shivering at this point, not at all because the winds got colder as the sun retreated, but because of the raw power of magic surrounding them.
“I take it as no,” Malfoy said calmly, taking yet another step towards Harry. “But surely you know how sex with an alpha works, don’t you?”
Draco’s bewilderment hadn’t fully worn off when the solicitor, Darius Engel as he introduced himself, told him the news he came to deliver. So, Draco could only stare at him, blinking uncomprehendingly.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Isn’t it supposed to be that way?”
“If only I hadn’t realized my sexuality when I was twelve, Professor Malfoy would surely have been my gay awakening,” said a Hufflepuff boy to his friend, both of them casually leaning on a wall.
Draco tried to hold on to his smirk, but it inevitably turned into a grin. He replied with the words they were both so familiar with. “Scared, Old Potter?”
To be fair, Harry really was not trying that much. If he had to be honest, he was still struggling to adjust with his post-war life that he barely had any energy or motivation left to focus on his academic works. He never said any of it to his friends, though. They seemed to be moving on well enough and Harry didn’t want to burden them with his problems. After all, if they all could, Harry should be able to, right? It was not a big deal, he had never been good at studying, anyway.
Astoria gave him an imploring look before posting her lips and casting her eyes down on the folded papers. "Nothing but speculation."
Maybe it was because of that sense of disconnection that Draco barely felt anything that he was now over ten thousand kilometres away from where he was born, in a country when the people speak in a language he didn’t know. He had never been so far anyway from anything that was familiar in his life.
“You missed the point, Ron!” he moaned. “What if I somehow ruin it? What if I trip on the aisle? What if I actually puke when I’m supposed to say my vow? What if I puke
“What’s this?” he asked instead, bowing his head to read the writing on it.
“Well, apparently he’s here, now.” Ron grinned a bit apologetically, but his blue eyes glinted with obvious amusement at his best mates predicament.
Finally looking at Draco, Harry smiled wider. “The farewell.”
“I trust you,” said Draco simply. Because he did trust Harry, no matter how much the fact scared him.
“I—we win!” he shouted loudly, jerking his teammates from their confused state. A moment later, they all joined him in cheering and jumping around their neatly piled
“But you’re so biased!”
Maybe it had something to do with their different traits. Harry had been so used to people around him acting bold and straightforward in showing their feelings. Like Hermione earlier when she dragged Harry for an angry interrogation after she witnessed the Potions essay incident. He didn’t mind. That had been the only way he knew how people cared about him for a long time, even since the first time he knew anyone cared about him at all. But maybe the straightforward actions hindered them from reading more about what's beneath the surface. Preventing them to stop and discover what’s hidden.
“Because of some kind of miracle,” he huffed against his neck. “Please, don’t ever do that to me again, Harry. I was so worried.”
Slowly, Harry’s hand moved again. “I always wondered why you’re trying really hard.”
Harry really didn’t have an answer for that. “Well, I… panicked? I-I don’t know, I just didn’t think.”
Harry. And everything felt so real.
or he was just overthinking it. Silently, he added it to his list of the mysteries about the man he probably would never understand. Harry didn’t seem like he would elaborate further.
in him, but he could do nothing but obey the command. With a shout, Harry came, his back arching and his whole body shuddering. The last thing he remembered was whimpering his final broken sob before everything turned black.
Draco Malfoy was both different and exactly the same when he showed up to their shared dorm room. He was still this tall, blond, and pointy boy. He looked the same as Harry remembered except for his more matured edges. But he almost couldn’t trace the trademark snide and loud barks he got really familiar with.
Draco’s luck didn’t end with only having someone who favored him in Harry’s team, because apparently one girl in his own team was brilliant at aiming the throws. In the next game when his team played the opponent, the girl—he would later learn from Gita that her name was Sonia—easily swept out most of the players, including Harry, within the first ten minutes of the game. The round ended faster than Draco had expected, with Harry’s team failing to score.
Malfoy and the Golden Trio together. Who would have thought, right? Certainly not Harry.
The kids didn’t waste another second to ambush him.
It was weird. And it was wrong. His heart was not supposed to react that way to his friend. And it was
Draco couldn’t help a big hearty laugh bubbling from his belly. “It’s okay, son. You’ll learn fast enough.”
A moan escaped him as Malfoy’s cock pushed deeper, making it harder to let his words sink in. “I didn’t know you… you can… you find my scent different, too,” Harry gasped.
With a small smile, Draco nodded. “I see,” he said.
“It’s stupid, you know,” he drawled. “The thing that bothers me.”
“This is more than good enough.”
When a familiar, lubed finger gently prodded into his entrance, Draco spread his legs wider in invitation, unashamed to let Harry know how eager and ready he was. Harry, being the good husband that he was, gladly obliged. Starting with one, two, and then three fingers inside him, stretching and exploring.
“Sorry,” Draco said as he twisted his body to see him, his tone not quite apologetic. “And no, I’m not writing a journal, just reading.”
could be more studious than her, didn’t even try to defend her best friend and boyfriend. She demanded to know Malfoy’s time management and organizing techniques—and that was how the study buddies relationship between the two of them kicked off.
A knowing smile bloomed in Draco’s face from the realization.
. Draco applied lipgloss on his lips. Of course he did.
Draco hated it all.
“Seems like the git is rubbing off on me.” Ron chuckled and fondly shook his head. “No one is surprised, Harry. The two of you have been obsessed with each other
Harry sighed. “What you
“Draco, it’s late. Stay the night, I’ll get you to the local department of transportation tomorrow. You need to say goodbye to Gita and Meme, too,” Harry reasoned.
Draco expected the Manor to be empty and the only thing that would greet him was the sad echo of his own footsteps, but the enormous door swung open before he could reach it, revealing a brunette woman in a soft blue dress.
His name shouldn’t sound so good on Malfoy’s tongue. And Malfoy’s scent.
The sight of Harry struggling with his Muggle lock was almost too adorable, making the man looking a lot younger than he was, and Draco felt his chest constricted. Suddenly not caring about the fact that they were still technically in public, Draco latched himself to him again, landing wet kisses on his jaw and neck.
means blond hair,” Gita answered, still half laughing. “And
Draco now looked down to stare at Harry’s hand, warmly covering his. None of them said anything.
“Yes. What do you want me to do to show that I’m being honest here?” Harry asked, feeling a desperate edge seeping into his voice. Why did Malfoy insist on being impossible? “I don’t even know how I could expose you by luring you into having sex with me.”
"I am," he said instead, forcing himself to smile. "I have a wedding to prepare for."
“Harry!” she called.
“Staying here for a bit longer, maybe. Learning those farming spells,” Harry replied eventually. “Then I’d love to find other secluded magical communities like this. There must be a lot of magic still unknown to me.”
instead. And he was sure Harry, his partner in crime, would take his hand and join him in this heist.
There was silence. Harry could see several different expressions fleeting on Draco’s face in the span of three solid seconds. The first was unmistakable shock. Next, brief confusion surfaced, laced with a tingle of concern—which was not unfounded, the state of his kitchen was very
Draco tilts his head in confusion. And the light catches both his cheekbone and lips, making them shine as if challenging Harry. "Huh?"
“Having fun?”
That was why Harry found himself once again standing in front of Malfoy's room in the middle of the night, ready for a sudden ambush. And ambushing he did, forgoing knocking the door before letting himself in, only to find Malfoy sitting calmly on one of his armchairs. He looked up from the book on his lap, barely flinching from the way Harry barged into his room uninvited.
Harry looked down at Malfoy, unable to keep himself from scowling. “You’re a bad alpha.”
Just as the heat in his body crept dangerously near his crotch and Harry’s rational mind decided to bolt out of the room, a voice was heard from his side.
Inevitably, he missed his cue to say his wedding vow. Draco had to nudge him lightly with a low snicker, eyes still glinted with amusement.
, the already thick cock expanded around the base, catching on Harry’s rim and locked them together. Malfoy’s hips kept twitching as he came, the sound he made could only be described as a feral growl. It took Harry a few delayed seconds to distinguish the intense pleasure rippling through his body among other overwhelming sensations. When Malfoy moaned his name as his cock pulsed inside him, Harry was finally tipped over the edge.
Alphas were supposed to be aggressive, uncontrollable. They were dangerous with highly fluctuating temperament, hence it was generally accepted that they shouldn’t work in places like schools and hospitals where their nature could risk the people in it. But, as far as what Harry observed from afar, Malfoy was anything but those traits. He was always calm and collected—almost too calm, in Harry’s opinion. Most of the time, Malfoy was very impassive. Unlike the sneering kid, Harry remembered him from their days as students at Hogwarts, this adult Malfoy had a permanent unimpressed look on his face. Like he couldn’t be bothered to show any emotion.
For a moment, Draco was grateful for the flat and impassive voice of this wizard. It somehow grounded him to reality, pulling him from the screaming of all his emotions, still in disbelief. This was real. Harry Potter had died. He wasn’t in this world anymore. Gone. Forever.
, for Salazar’s sake. “Can that be the same ancient magic Gita described before? She said it’s also ancient magic powered by love.”
The request took Draco by surprise, making the rhythm of his thrust falter. He looked down at him in question.
“Very funny, Potter,” Malfoy deadpanned.
He comes to a realization today. They are sitting across each other in a cafe for their lunch break when Harry finally realizes.
It was not until a couple of days later that Harry found out what he meant by fixing. It was pretty late, he was sitting together with Hermione and Ron in the mostly deserted common room in front of the fireplace writing the Transfiguration essay he forgot was due tomorrow. When Hermione was in the middle of monologuing how Harry was irresponsible for not doing his work until so late, Malfoy showed up.
Molly went on talking about how the decision against giving Draco a black suit was the best as he would look too monochrome considering his complexion, but Harry couldn’t really concentrate on her speech about Pansy’s expertise in styling as the thought of Draco dressing up, preparing for
Not only that, it seemed like even the frosty coldness didn’t affect Malfoy. His muted grey cloak, although looked appropriate for a little hike on a snowy area, was considerably thinner than the one Harry desperately wrapped around himself. He didn’t shiver once or even show that he felt the coldness at all.
As he stared at the vast ocean, Draco felt the tiny waves crashing at his feet, as though trying to calm the storm raging in his chest. As though Harry, now part of the sea, was soothing him. The thought brought a small smile on Draco’s face.
The red-head in question looked up from where he was sitting on a couch in Harry’s changing room, munching on a cookie. “I wouldn’t suggest that. You know Parkinson will kill you if you make even a tiny wrinkle on that stupidly expensive suit,” he said. “I don’t want to think what the devil will do if you cover it with your vomit.”
The girl grinned wider before her expression dimmed. She hesitated before saying quietly, “back then… when you go, Harry get really sad.”
As the crystals continued to merrily swirl around him, Malfoy laughed, delighted. He waved his wand again here and there, making the crystals dance in an odd but constant rhythm. With his wand not ceasing its movement, he outstretched his free hand to beckon to Harry to come closer, his own body swaying softly as if he was dancing along with the diamond dust.
“You think I should?”
show me how true that is. You know I can be a fair judge for that.”
“That’s the point!” Harry exclaimed. “I’m not aging well and no one will be objective enough to agree with me.”
He fought an urge to laugh. At what, Draco didn’t know. Half an hour ago, he was living his quiet life, enjoying his morning tea with his family. Now, someone came uninvited to slap him with news he would never be prepared to receive.
“But we are the foot of a mountain.” Draco arched his brow.
“Since when?” Harry asked suddenly after a few minutes of silence.
, you cretin!”
“Oh? And what will you do with it?” Malfoy challenged him.
It didn’t have to mean anything.
Draco felt both of his eyebrows shoot to his hairline. “
Malfoy licked his lower lip. “I need you to be sure, Potter. Do you truly want this? You know you don’t owe me anything. You don’t have to do this.”
Maybe it was his tiredness, or maybe it was the cold numbing his brain, but Harry could not explain the wild fluttering he felt in his stomach at the sight. He knew Malfoy was not in any way ugly—far from it actually—but now, suspended in the glittering ice fog, the blond man looked extremely
Draco knew he had a magic core inside of him, but he never knew where it was. He never even thought it was in a particular spot inside his body. But right now, he could clearly feel it, the vibration that came from his sternum. It wasn’t like the vibration the rest of his body felt from the shift in the magic, the vibration from a little part of his sternum actually
As if reading his thoughts, Engel stepped next to him and said, “Most of the wealth has been allocated as to the wish of the deceased. The goblins are notoriously fast when it comes to moving people’s funds like this.”
Detecting Harry’s hesitation, Malfoy sighed and walked away, creating distance between them which Harry both regretted and was grateful for. With Malfoy across the room, at least he felt like he could control himself better.
. And Draco couldn’t for the life of Salazar understand what the Saviour wanted from him.
“What would be his reason to put you in his will?” countered Ron.
coming from Malfoy’s mouth made Harry clutch him tighter. There was no way Harry was letting this scent go anywhere. “No need. Don’t need water.”
Harry Potter wasn’t even a part of my wildest dreams.”
He needed to know why Potter wrote his name in his will. And this was the only way to get the answer.
Pleased, Harry led him out of their common room, barely offering any excuse to Hermione and Ron who lounged on the other side of the room. It didn’t matter, from the meaningful look the couple threw their way, Harry knew both of them understood.
Malfoy sighed again. "There's no secret, Potter," he said, his tone exasperated. "You just get used to it after several times."
Ron smiled at him meaningfully.
"Can we look up his name? On that ghoul internet thing?" Draco looked up at him expectantly.
He gripped Harry’s hand harder.
“And we still have a long way to go,” Harry continued, a grin clear in his voice. “As the Muggle’s saying goes, forty is just the new thirty.”
“Where are you going?” she asked, putting down her fork.
No reaction was heard for a few moments until Harry felt a huff of breath on the side of his face as Malfoy sighed in defeat, his body relaxing a bit in Harry’s clutch. “Alright, Potter, I’ll
Harry grinned against his lips. Draco didn’t always let his feelings be so clearly on display, but at times like this, his love was obvious. Harry couldn’t contain his own feelings toward the man and just decided to just deepen the kiss.
Draco met his eyes. “No, but those were the only things worth writing.”
Draco restrained himself from scoffing, and instead he silently gathered his patience. Scorpius and Astoria were waiting for him to have their breakfast together. “Yes, the Malfoys aren’t as well off as we used to be, now,” he said. “But, no matter how hard it is to believe, we are doing quite fine without having to steal from anyone else's vault. Besides, you both saw the will. All his wealth will be donated, anyway.”
Draco received a letter from his mother the day after he got the news about Lucius. Harry remembered him opening it with his bony fingers, read it for a few minutes, and sat up straight on his desk, his expression shifted to deeply troubled.
Humming quietly, Draco asked again, “so we’re allowed to use a Portkey, now?”
Harry tried to keep a straight face, but it was so much harder than he thought with Malfoy’s enticing scent starting to addle his mind. The close proximity didn’t help either. Harry forced himself not to examine the man’s features as Malfoy stopped only a few feet from him. “You shouldn’t be here, Malfoy.”
“He did?”
“Malfoy.” Hermione called, the scowl still on. “Did you know about Harry’s Potions essay?”
The only problem was that somewhere along the way, Harry started longing for something more than just a friendship. His physical attraction for the blond bloomed into something that felt both fiercer and softer at the same time. Harry could easily brush off his attraction to Draco’s gorgeous look, but he couldn’t ignore the desire for his care and attention. He wanted to talk to him about all his feelings, both happiness and sadness. He wanted to be comforted with intimate touches. He wanted to trust Draco with everything and be trusted in return. He wanted to be cheered with odd good wishes on flimsy slap bracelets. He wanted to have them all.
“You’re exaggerating,” Harry defended himself. “I’m just… I’m just being friendly, okay? Just like what McGonagall said, we’re working on inter-House unity this year. I’m trying to set a good example for that.”
“Because she loves me!” Draco cheered merrily as he swooped down to take Maya into his arm and lifted the girl up. “This is what they call having a spy working with your foes,” he said with a laugh, twirling Maya around in a celebratory dance.
“Nothing,” Draco replied with a shrug. “Just depressing stuff about my days during the war.”
“You can’t—Hermione, he’s in South Korea it will—”
His words were so earnest that it was Draco’s turn to be stunned. Right at that time, everything became quiet. Nothing in the mostly deserted hallway made a sound, only their even breathing. Draco tried to comprehend Potter’s question, his eyes still locked with those gleaming emerald ones. Every minute that passed made Draco feel even more dazed.
Ron shook his head in disbelief and let out a low laugh. “Merlin, you’re really obsessed with that Muggle toy, aren’t you?”
Before Draco could shout for help to Gita, the woman emerged from her house as if summoned, Harry in tow. Draco secretly let out a breath of relief when the little girl stopped her attempt to touch him as she saw the two coming, only a few inches left between them.
Harry smirked, coming up to face him. “You need more stamina to keep up with this old man, darling husband.”
left.
Harry tried to find another word in his head that was not another dumb
Harry was all but kicked the door open, swinging it hard and dragged Draco inside in a blink. They didn’t have time to lock the door again, barely had time to close the door, and they were on each other again, greedily marking each other.
And the whole world exploded, crumbling around them and rebuilding itself to a new dimension neither of them knew before this. Before Draco was Harry and Harry was Draco, before they became one as naturally as breathing—as though they were meant to be all along.
The heat burned and burned, consuming every nerve in Draco’s body. He clutched at Harry, wanting to feel the heat he emitted from himself, wanting to burn together.
Harry was scowling deeply at the Potions problem in front of him, willing it to solve itself or praying for the answer to magically appear in his head. It didn’t work, of course. He still had no idea why the specific weight of Billywig wings could have a severe consequence in brewing a Laughing Potion. He slumped in the hard library chair and sighed. The problem was staring back at him mockingly from the parchment.
“I’m glad,” said Draco, ruffling his son’s curly platinum hair. “Actually, I have another gift for you. Not as great as the broom, of course.”
“It’s a classic for a reason, right?” Gita walked to a big crate in one corner of the gazebo and pulled out a wooden box and a little black bag from it. “Come on, guys, I need to explain the rules for you.”
frustrating.
Malfoy made a thoughtful noise. “It’s in my blood, I guess. Probably just a genetic thing.”
“No,” Harry cut him harshly.
“Well, not everyone gets the opportunity to use their ability to save the world. I need to find a creative way to utilize my skills. It’s not like he didn’t deserve it either.”
"I don't plan to tell anyone."
Or the way every time Malfoy looked up to meet his eyes gave his heart an odd squeeze.
Harry tried his best, but his mind simply failed to understand why Draco Malfoy was here in Hogwarts, having breakfast like he was right where he meant to be and smelling so
Still relishing the gentle pulsing of their fused magic, Draco closed his eyes, welcoming the picture of Harry with a carefree smile that his mind conjured. This—with Scorpius in his arms, their magic blanketing them—was the only time he didn’t regret the time he shared with Harry.
“No, it’s not like that.” Harry frowned. “I mean, you’ve been really… quiet. I understand if you’re still mourning, but… well, um, I was wondering if I could help in any way.”
There was something almost sacred about the place. Draco looked around him. The path he was walking on was narrow, but the houses it connected were far apart, separated by rice fields and vegetable gardens and sometimes just empty land. There were a few people lounging in front of every house, sitting leisurely on their porch, seemingly enjoying the bright afternoon sun. Every time the people noticed them, they’d offer a welcoming smile and a nod, which Harry simply replied with the same kind of acknowledging nod.
“I mean yeah, I saw it in person when I was eleven but I’m not a bloody magical artifacts specialist. I figured they picked me because of that but we both know I’m basically just here on bodyguard detail.” Harry’s voice raised as his cheeks heated, feeling defensive.
“Y-yes, Harry,” Draco managed to choke out while being pounded mercilessly from behind. “O-only...you.”
Not needing to be told twice, Draco shed his layers in record time and watched hungrily as Harry did the same. When they were finally skin to skin, Harry couldn’t stop running his hands over every inch of soft flesh, wanting to personally map out each nook and cranny. He flipped Draco under him and captured his lips in a bruising kiss, grabbing a fistful of golden hair. The other man readily opened up for Harry, their tongues duelling for dominance.
After the two of them suffered through awkward apologies and thank yous on both ends following Draco’s acquittal, they spent a surprisingly uneventful year at Hogwarts finishing their studies. The biggest turning point was Draco’s budding friendship with Hermione, which finally blossomed after he spent the first few months apologizing and proving his sincerity through agonizing but eye-opening self-introspection. With not much else vying for his attention, Draco threw himself into his schoolwork and resumed his position fighting for the top rank spot against Hermione. From then on it was inevitable that the two would study together and swap notes, which meant Harry (and much to the redhead’s chagrin, Ron) had to become used to the blonde’s presence from time to time.
Harry felt himself getting closer and closer to release, chasing his high by moving faster and harder. He wrapped one arm around Draco’s chest and pulled him up into his lap, biting down on the juncture of porcelain skin between neck and shoulder. Draco screamed as he came, his body convulsing in ecstasy. Harry fucked into him one, two, three more times until the tightening channel pulled the orgasm from him and he spilled deep inside.
“I don’t know why you’re being an even bigger arse than normal but if that’s how you want to be, fine. I’m going to bed. We’ll apparate out to the site in the morning.”
“Solvo te..."
He rolled his eyes but said nothing as he extended the pen out to Harry, who grabbed it with his entire hand, causing their fingers to brush. Immediately an intense tugging sensation dragged them bodily through space, spitting them out leagues away from where they had started.
“I see us fighting, god. So much fighting. Each other and against those around us who can’t let go of the past. But we’re stronger together, and united we’ll never break. I see our happiness, Draco. And it’s within our reach. But I can’t achieve it alone.” His voice faltered, barely being held together by hope and courage. “Please. Be with me.”
“I see...us getting a cozy flat together. Not too big but not too small either, so that we could have guests over if we like. And maybe a dog? Or a cat, that fits you much better, I would think. Perhaps one of each.”
An old painting fell off its hook as Harry stewed. He stopped moving for a moment to calm down. Harry let out a deep sigh, grieving the emptiness he felt now that he had held Draco once. His heart had been effectively torn to shreds by Draco’s words, but he had to keep reminding himself that they had nothing to start with. Instead, it seemed like he would need to mourn what would now, for certain, never be.
“I want to ride you...'til I come,” Draco said breathlessly, tapping on Harry’s thigh.
“Hours?” Ron goggled. “Try days! You two have been missing for a week! No note, no trace, no nothing. Mate, we were beginning to think the worst. But thank Merlin you’re alright.”
He couldn’t help his unconscious awareness of the other, having developed and fine-tuned such a sense over many years. At first Harry was furious, believing that Draco had regressed to his old ways of looking down on others for no reason. But after further observation, was relieved to find that wasn’t exactly the case. Sure Draco had a nasty temper and was quick to lash out, but Harry could tell it was more or less never unprovoked. For the most part their peers and even some instructors were far from impartial in their treatment toward Draco which caused the blonde to open up to only a select few in their cohort.
It was Harry’s turn to start pacing as his thoughts began to spiral. He couldn’t believe Draco thought so little of him that he was the star villain in his disturbing erotic fantasy. He didn’t know whether his head or heart hurt more at that moment. The two sat in excruciating silence for some time, not even sure how long they had been in the Mirror-world for.
“Patience,” he whispered against Draco’s heart. “I’m going to take my time so that I can worship every part of you.”
“I don’t b-believe you.”
“That’s right,” Harry growled. “You belong to me, Draco. You’re mine.”
“Shut up!” he yelled, slamming the blonde against the wall again. “God, why are you so fucking insufferable all the time?”
Draco dropped his hands and met Harry’s gaze, defeat and sadness in his eyes.
Harry stepped back with his hands out in front of him defensively as Draco began to pace in circles, seething to himself.
Draco just started straight ahead as the floors dinged by and gave a little shrug.
“I’m fine, t-thank you,” he said, stuttering slightly. Draco walked over to his open notebook and wrote a few lines, although Harry could see that his hand was trembling.
Even worse, this gala would be Harry’s first public appearance after his retirement from his Auror career. He could imagine the number of people wanting to give Harry their personal input on his choice and he was not excited about it. He really didn’t want to go and Draco understood—he always did. He suggested that he go alone but Harry disliked the idea even more. With still many wizards and witches holding unnecessary grudges with him, Harry knew Draco enjoyed formal functions as much as he did, if not less. But, he had promised to meet someone at this gala and he insisted on coming. While being perfectly aware that his boyfriend could stand for himself, Harry still did not fancy letting Draco do it all alone. They would both be less unhappy with the other at their side.
“What?”
A lump rose to Draco’s throat the same time he felt his chest constricted. This was the place when they decided to borrow their time, it made sense if Harry thought his invitation to return was to give it back. But Draco was greedy. He wanted to keep their time together for longer. Forever. Wouldn’t Harry want it, too?
don't know why he did that,” said Draco, his patience thinning.
“Stop it, Father,” Scorpius giggled eventually, fully awake now.
Both of them were sitting on the floor, cross-legged, on the wide porch of Maya’s house. Maya’s mother, a woman in her early thirties, had been insistently offering them their third helping of rice and spicy chicken despite Draco’s polite refusal.
“Of course you’d say that, Saint Potter,” Malfoy huffed incredulously. He got up and walked to his desk, pulling out a piece of parchment. He scribbled something on it and took his wand out to put some spells on the parchment, cutting it long and narrow. And stiff. He walked back to Harry’s bed and held out his hand. “Give me your wrist.”
“I’m not busy,” Harry said and was granted with two identical looks of judgement from both Hermione and Malfoy. It was almost amusing. “No, really, I’ve finished my outline. All I have to do now is just some finishing words.”
“That’s why I’m here to help, right?” Draco grinned, open and pleasant. Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight. “Shall we go to the library? We could study one more chapter before dinner.”
“Salazar,” Malfoy gasped between his laughs. “How could you mess up your potion so bad it does the exact
“All is fair in love and war, darling.” Draco threw him a wink.
“Good morning,” Harry said quietly, almost whispering.
A frown appeared on his face. “Are you asking me to go stargazing?”
“Really? Why would you help me?”
“No, we’re as free as we can be,” Harry said. “Need us to do something?”
In the back of his mind, Draco absently thought that he should have been a bit surprised to find Astoria here, but he didn’t. He gave his soon-to-be wife full access with the wards before he left and Astoria could come by anytime she wanted for all Draco knew. He was just not sure that he was in the mood to be in anyone’s company at the moment.
“Not really. I actually got my qualification to work in the government office, but I came back after school for Meme.”
“Oh,” was all Malfoy said.
, a sacred magical ritual to celebrate the growing season—a way to show our gratitude for the magic itself that helped us grow our crops,” Gita explained. “The non-magical people adapted it to be a local dance and it became a famous attraction for tourists in Bali, but the original form involves a lot of magic and ancient spells. It’s kinda hard to explain, though, better for you to come and see it for yourself.”
“Please don’t be,” Draco said. “I’m happy they’re living their lives and moving on. Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Theo…” He trailed off and Harry had a feeling he was thinking about his friend that didn’t make it out the War. “Anyway, I’m happy for them. And I’m also grateful for my chance to befriend you, Hermione, and Ron.” He looked up from where he snuggled up on Harry’s chest, his grey eyes gleaming with sincerity.
“Hardly,” answered Harry, smiling. “It’s just the custom here. Everyone is so friendly. In no time, you’ll find them trying to engage you in conversations.”
“He’s still mourning, Harry. We should give him space,” Hermione told him.
“A what?” said Ron with a frown.
definitely crossed a line. He opened his mouth, ready to defend his boyfriend when he felt Draco’s palm move to his back, grounding him.
“Well, if he didn’t even contact you, what would be his reason to contact me?”
“It’s called
If Draco had known this seven years ago, he would have asked
Exhausted with sleep deprivation, Draco dragged his feet to the parlour in the east side of the Manor where he knew his wife would be at this time of the day. As expected, Astoria was sitting on one of the armchairs in the room, a cup of tea on the table in front of her and today’s edition of
Draco stumbled to his feet as he was dragged over to the bench by his hair and unceremoniously draped over the end, the sharp corners digging into his stomach uncomfortably. His own cock - which was trapped painfully within the confines of his trousers - strained against the material pitifully, the smooth underside of the wooden bench providing no friction to rub against. Draco yelped in shock when Harry pulled his trousers and pants down over his arse in one swift motion, the tight fit of the garment locking his legs together and constricting his crotch even further. He had no time to adjust to the new sensations as his mouth was once more filled, this time by two warm fingers.
“Well I’m not a bloody mind reader, I barely even passed Divination! How am I supposed to guess what your stupid fantasy is?” Harry yelled in exasperation.
Harry cleared his throat, ears burning in embarrassment.
“Shit, gonna come,” Draco warned, about to tip over the edge.
Harry returned to the inside of the barn, noting that Draco had set up a couple tables with all sorts of confusing looking gadgets around the Mirror and had removed the protective cloth. The man himself stood directly in front of the Mirror, staring intently at whatever it was showing him.
There were no other sounds aside from their labored breathing and the matching staccato of their hammering hearts. Harry still held Draco against his body when they were both sent flying backwards with extreme force, exhausted and disoriented when they landed on dusty wood in a tangled heap.
“Perdam te!”
He desperately didn’t want to have to force his way in - although Auror-grade unlocking spells were a handy thing - but neither did he want to have such a private conversation in an open hallway. And they were going to have it. After five excruciating seconds, Harry let out a breath he didn’t even realize he was holding when he heard the lock click on the other side of the door. Bracing himself for either a physical or magical assault, he turned the knob and stepped inside.
Draco had a rolling trunk in his other hand and had changed out of his full work uniform in lieu of comfortable travelling clothes, which for him still meant a sharp-pressed button down and equally smart slacks. His hair, however, was a shade darker than its normal platinum and fell loosely around his face, damp and curling ever so slightly at the tips.
“I decided long ago to throw away the notion of having to simper and ingratiate myself to others simply because they are older than me.” He shifted almost imperceptibly and muttered under his breath as if reminding himself not to forget, “Older does not mean wiser.” Looking over at Harry he continued, “Perhaps you honorable types had the right idea all along, that respect should be earned. As for Robards...he’s alright. So, that was me being polite.”
“So...perfect, Draco,” Harry gasped. “God, I want to be inside you forever.” He was absolutely convinced there was no one better suited for him in the entire world.
Draco closed his eyes and nodded, silent tears escaping like dewdrops in the moonlight. Not wasting another moment he ran into Harry’s outstretched arms, which closed around him instinctively in a tight hug. Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck, committing the feel of the man in his arms to memory and vowing to never lose him again. He kissed and stroked Draco’s head as the blonde continued to blubber, his words a jumbled mess of apologies and confessions. When he finally straightened up and tried to clear his vision, Draco stiffened in Harry’s arms, visibly alarmed.
“Someone...needs to...teach you...to control...that mouth...of yours,” Harry grunted as he slid in and out of Draco’s mouth, going as deep as he could.
“Of course not, you wanker!” Draco said, his voice hoarse from all the shouting. Unsurprisingly, he felt no better after his confession. “That’s why it’s a fantasy and why we are probably stuck here forever!”
Harry stood stock-still, speechless as Draco continued.
“Want you so bad, Harry,” Draco begged, arching up to grind frantically against the tanned body above him. “Need you in me!”
Thankful to have been greeted by neither, Harry tried to quell the pain in his chest as he looked at Draco. The other had retreated deeper into the room - past the rickety wooden table that was part of the inn’s basic furnishings and currently laden with Draco’s wand and his assortment of magical devices - standing by the lone window with his dressing gown pulled tightly around him. He refused to meet Harry’s eyes. Draco’s face looked even worse than before, eyes puffy and skin marred by pink blotches.
“You know, even though he’s not your direct supervisor you should still show a bit of respect,” Harry said, settling beside the tall blonde while they waited. “Or...basic politeness.”
“Fuck yes!” Draco screamed as Harry simultaneously sucked hard on his cock while vigorously fingering him.
“Ha fucking ha, Potter.”
Harry grunted in pain, having for what he presumed was the third time, broken both of their falls with his body. Draco remained within his arms, unscathed for the most part save for a few shallow cuts.
“Make that two or three,” he said with a wink before Harry apparated them away.
Everything began to fly around them in a whirlwind, although nothing seemed to have a corporeal form anymore and the lines separating them blurred together.
“Got it in one, Potter. Hermione would be proud,” he sneered.
“Are you hurt?”
“Tsk tsk, no one likes a rule breaker, Malfoy. Wouldn’t want that on your pristine record, now would you?” Harry couldn’t help but shoot over his shoulder as he headed toward the next available floo. He was rewarded with a rude hand gesture before Draco disappeared in a violent burst of flames, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.
“Maybe we should break for lunch?” Harry suggested.
“You waited for me, I’m touched,” Harry said with a light laugh, taking in the sight before him.
The surface of the Mirror had morphed into an almost liquified state, reflective tendrils reaching out and grabbing onto his limbs, clearly intending to drag him in. Draco felt the icy touch of the Mirror spread over the front of his body and a dueling one filled with warmth at his back as strong arms wrapped around him. The Mirror-slime engulfed them both, latching onto Harry and Draco as if with a thousand sharp hooks and dragging them within its depths. They felt as if they were thrown off a cliff, falling endlessly as the world faded into darkness.
“Crying?” Harry asked. “What are you talking about?”
“Stop teasing me,” Draco whined, trying to push up further into Harry’s mouth but only meeting air.
The feeling of the tight, hot channel was incredible and Harry wanted nothing more than to bury himself deep within, but he knew he would have to be patient just a little while longer. He scissored his fingers apart as far and deep as he could, since without proper lubrication it was going to be a painful stretch regardless. Harry continued to massage around until he felt Draco’s body tense up and heard a sharp gasp.
“Not done with you yet,” he said, his voice a throaty rasp.
What really bore down on Harry, however, was the Mirror’s call. It was an oppressive and instinctual need to go over to it, as if all the happiness in the world that always lay just out of his reach was waiting for him if he took a single look in it. Harry realized belatedly that it was probably part of his file that he could resist an Imperius - just another reason for why he was assigned to that particular mission. He wondered how Draco must be faring under the Mirror’s pressure; after the scene Harry walked in on earlier, there was no way he was unaffected. Harry cleared his throat as delicately as he could to get Draco’s attention, hopefully without causing the other man to lose whatever train of thought he had going on at the time.
“Draco!”
“What are you talking about? I’m sure we can figure something out-”
He lined himself up with Draco’s quivering hole, now pink and swollen from the attention. Harry took a deep breath before forcing himself inside fully in one swift motion, drawing out a long moan from the man beneath him. Not allowing any time for Draco to adjust to his size, Harry pulled out nearly all the way before slamming back in. He started with slow but long strokes, unable to look away from how completely he was being swallowed up. Draco’s eyelids fluttered shut, his senses overloaded from the onslaught of sensations while being restrained.
“I’ve secured the- Malfoy?”
Harry woke up flat on his back with a dull pain in his head. He blinked groggily at the overly-bright lights above, feeling around as his senses slowly returned. The ground was hard and cold beneath his fingers, but smooth with thin lines forming a grid-like pattern. Bathroom tiles. Harry sat up in alarm, immediately looking around frantically and seeking out his partner.
Harry nodded and moved a few paces closer, wanting to be prepared for anything. Draco took out his wand and stood directly in front of the Mirror once more, casting in wide, sweeping arcs and speaking softly under his breath. He looked over to the table bearing his instruments while he continued chanting, focusing on a rectangular box that had a small window with a meter inside, much like a Muggle thermometer. His eyes grew large as the meter filled up halfway with a blue light when Harry suddenly shouted.
“I- No- What the fuck?” Harry had no idea how to feel or even respond. “I would never- You think I would do something like that?”
“No, sir,” Harry replied after a few moments of what he felt was an uncomfortably tense silence. He glanced at the unmoving blonde sitting beside him out of the corner of his eye, wondering what was going through the other’s head at the time.
“Laugh all you want, Potter, but believe it or not I worked extremely hard to get where I am today. No tricks, underhandedness, or money involved. So pardon me if I feel like I am finally deserving of my superior attitude.”
Harry laughed and brushed a hand through Draco’s hair, kissing his forehead.
“Er, yeah,” Harry shrugged, not really having given his previous action much thought. “I guess so.”
Harry nearly came on the spot, hearing the words he had only ever imagined in his dreams. He removed his fingers and had to grip his twitching member to stave off the feeling, knowing that he wasn’t going to last much longer.
Draco straightened his back and sighed deeply, running a hand down his face. He had tied back his hair - which normally fell to just above his shoulders - to keep it out of his face and had a light sheen of sweat on his forehead.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, concern etched in his brow.
A delicate glass ball rolled out of its cradle and fell to the floor, shattering into pieces.
“Yes, your past,” Harry cut him off, throat tight and moving directly in front of Draco. “But what about ours? How am I supposed to feel when I find out literally the thing that you desire most is me turning out to be the bad guy? After all these years, why do you hate me so much?”
“Your c-cock!” Draco sobbed. “P-please fuck me…”
Harry growled, grabbing the taller man by the shoulders and shaking him roughly.
“Shit. Well, it’s not like we planned to spend a week in some freaky mirror dimension. I’m glad we’re back too,” Harry said. He turned and looked at Draco, whom he was still half-hugging, and smiled. “But I’m even more glad that you were with me.”
“Who would have thought everyone’s beloved Saviour is really just a freak who gets hard for a Malfoy on his knees-”
Draco started, shocked out of his maudlin state by Harry’s outburst.
Harry couldn’t look away from the form in front of him, wanting to remember every minute detail: the half-light illuminating the sharp planes of Draco’s body and reflecting off glistening beads of sweat; the sensual noises that flowed unceasingly from his bitten lips; his dripping cock flushed and trembling in anticipation.
Draco let out a hysteric wail that made Harry start to question whether or not the blonde was actually in his right mind. But when Draco refused to make any further comment, Harry listed out the facts in his head and tried to draw some conclusions. The two of them were inside the Mirror of Erised - completely uncharted and frightening territory - that was drawing people in with their heart’s desires and feeding off their magic. Desires? Did one of them want to be trapped inside the locker room? Harry wasn’t the most self-aware individual but he was fairly sure it wasn’t him.
Harry tightened his grip around Draco’s neck, eyes wild and teeth gritted.
Harry hiked Draco up further on his lap, pushing in even deeper and closing the final distance. He readjusted his grip on both legs before beginning to drive in and out, brushing against Draco’s prostate with each stroke. Draco braced himself against the headboard, meeting Harry thrust for thrust. The air was filled with their moans and labored breathing interlaced with the erotic sounds of sex.
He had taken them straight to his bedroom back in London, and looking around felt very self conscious about the obvious mess. Harry raised the lights only a little and kicked a couple piles of clothing beneath his bed before getting knocked on his back. The bedsprings creaked as Draco got on top of him, straddling his waist and pinning him down.
“I am a man of my word, so let it be known that I will continue to be, present and future,” he scowled, flushing lightly. His expression suddenly turned sly as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and added with a raised eyebrow, “More importantly, I believe I was promised dinner and drinks?” Draco ignored Ron’s bewildered expression as he leaned in to whisper loudly by Harry’s ear, “Or, we could just skip to the fun part.”
I don’t understand! he thought in frustration. What else could I have possibly done under the circumstances? And why is he mad at me when it was his fucking fantasy that got us trapped in the first place!
“You want to know what my fantasy is?” Draco shouted, red in the face and clearly at his wit’s end, on the verge of tears. “Fine, I’ll tell you! We’re in the quidditch locker rooms after a game, and I’ve finally caught the snitch before you! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been and you’re furious. So mad, in fact, that you pin me down and tie me up before taking out your cock and fucking my mouth with it, hard, so that I’m choking and crying. But you don’t stop there, no. Then you finger me in the arse roughly, just enough so that you can fuck me there too, until you come inside. And the whole time you’re pulling my hair and insulting me, calling me names.”
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin when the room began to shake violently but he tightened his arms and continued.
“No.”
“Draco?” Harry asked, voice heavy with worry. He could see Draco’s eyes were seeing something past him, thoughts far off in another place.
“No.”
Harry couldn’t help but let out an unflattering snort in response, causing Draco to scowl.
When Harry thought the other man was reaching his limit, he pulled out suddenly and let go, causing Draco to slump over against the wall. His chest was heaving as he gasped for breath, barely managing to cough wetly and clear his airways. Harry’s heart continued to beat like a jackhammer in his ribcage, the drumming of his pulse so loud he thought Draco could hear it too.
“Use your words, Malfoy. Tell me what you need.”
Harry gave Draco an endearingly lop-sided grin and held his arms wide open.
“Close?” he asked, voice rough.
“O...kay. If that’s what you think then why are you mad at me?”
“Come for me,” Harry urged, taking over and snapping his hips up forcefully at a brutal pace.
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to keep the hurt out of his voice.
“Wait! Are you okay?” Harry said thickly. “Shouldn’t we talk-”
“I’ve wanted to be your friend, to be close to you, all this time. But what right do I have to stand by your side? No matter how much I change or pay for my youth you can never belong to me. Not back at Hogwarts, not now. And the Mirror understands this, otherwise it wouldn’t have come up with the only kind of scenario where I could be with you, even if it hurts.”
“Thank you,” Harry whispered against Draco’s head. “For choosing me too.”
“Alright, any questions?”
Harry and Draco landed with an unsteady thump, clutching each other to stay upright and laughing so hard their stomachs hurt.
to obey him.”

“I figured that out when she stormed off and he stood there looking like a stricken baboon,” said Malfoy with an amused grin. “But I don’t blame her for thinking he was joking. A Slytherin with a Gryffindor?

“If you don’t mind me being here, I have a letter to send, you know,” said Harry. Something about the way Malfoy nodded and looked away made Harry rush to add, “I actually wanted to show you something.”
. Just for your information, Lavender and Parvati feel terrible for you because,” she clasped her hands and sighed theatrically, “
Two pale hands were immediately over his. "I'm not letting you destroy my eardrums again," hissed Draco. “Don’t just open it!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “There are no buts, I was just thinking you could make a good Defense teacher since you did well with your little army.” The blond shrugged.  “Of course, you could do that after retiring.”
“That doesn’t mean I like any of them. There's a difference between acknowledging someone's looks and being attracted to them," she said matter-of-factly, nose turned up in defiance. "Which I'm certainly not, for the reasons I already mentioned."
“Not about you not being worth it, of course,” said Ron. “But Harry, you know how things are. First of all, he and his family are a bunch of blood purists, and you are a half-blood. So it wouldn’t go anywhere.”
“Anyway! We were there, feeling quite lost, and guess who we ran into?” Hermione grinned.
“She kept glaring at me!”
It was then when a familiar chirp broke the silence.
“Even if I’m speaking with Ron again, I wasn’t planning to stop coming here, you know,” said Harry slowly, figuring he couldn’t make things worse.
There’s another sound that silences her, almost inquisitive and followed by an intake of air.
“Do you have any proof they
As the days passed, Harry discovered that Draco Malfoy sent letters home twice a week, which was more than most students did. Hermione wrote to his parents once a month, and Ron only did it during Holidays or special circumstances. Harry…, well, Harry wished he could write to Sirius as often. But it wasn’t as simple as that. His godfather had yet to answer his first letter.
“Don’t be dramatic, Ron,” said Hermione, “He hasn’t seen him all summer. It’ll pass in a few days."
Harry barely managed to catch the twitch of Draco’s right eyebrow before the blond’s patience snapped. "Harry, that bloody elf was at the Manor on Christmas! You can't trust it."
There is something clearly animalistic in the way the werewolf crouches in front of him, with the wariness of a kicked dog. But there is also something inherently Malfoy too; perhaps the way his white eyes look calculating, or the paleness of its fur. "It's really you," says Harry, as if he hadn't seen the transformation. But now that he is not running for his life, he can think clearly, think about the horrible implications behind all this.
“You are such a git,” said Harry as they left the library.
got you. It’s a nice scarf, too bad he only bought it to sell you his House values."
Harry laughed. “No, of course not.” Draco seemed surprised and dropped his hand, Harry caught it and brought it to his chest. “You are not Hermione or Ron. You are you. So of course you would help me in another way. Maybe you didn’t rush in, but you are still with me, right?”
.” Sirius whistled, patting the black leather seats. “Scrimgeour is working hard to separate himself from Fudge, isn’t he? Now instead of the Boy-Who-Lied, you are the Chosen-One and he gives you
, Pansy," said Zabini, voice as neutral as ever, if not slightly tired.
They sounded like fireworks and seemed to become louder by the second. He froze at the middle of the hall when he realised that the noises were coming from around the corner at the end of it and seemed to be going straight towards him. And so were other sounds; the fast steps of someone running, almost drowned by the explosions, so loud now that Harry swore they sounded like a growl, and a very distinctive scream of terror.
“Uh... what if we get going downstairs? The rest will arrive soon, and you have to be there to greet them. You know how birthdays go.”
“I suppose I owe him as well,” mumbled Draco, making Harry’s eyes flicker to him again. Draco met his gaze, a faint blush spreading on his cheeks. He cleared his throat. “Anyway. He can’t be worse than Trelawney.”
“Well, you must be happy, right?” Harry went back to finishing packing, giving his back to his cousin as he came up with a way to fit in his shoes. “I won’t be around anymore, you will probably get this room back.”
it was that the guys at Hogwarts
" insisted Harry, and the blond finally met his eyes, steel gaze softening slightly. Draco sighed and cupped his face with a hand, giving him a very brief kiss.
Hermione frowned. “But the list just came out today."
Angelina raised her eyebrows at him in disbelief.
Ron grimaced. “Listen, mate. I just think you should forget about him.” He waved his hands. “I mean, there is plenty of sea for the fishes, as the muggles say.”
Malfoy gave him a quick nod. “Peachy. I have to go now.” He hurried towards the stairs. “Bye, Potter."
"Where is your little sidekick, Potter?" said Malfoy, a hint of distaste on his voice. “Did he grow tired of your shadow?”
“If he’s better this way, then I’ll have to leave him alone.”
The blond wasn't even looking at them, his eyes fixed on the back of Harry’s raised hand. Harry’s
Harry straightened up, “He can read minds?"
to talk about.
Harry stepped out of the way and closed the door after the man, then going to stand next to his trunk as he watched the scene in interest.
“Someone must have blabbed,” continued Ron, looking around in suspicion. “Hermione, what are we looking for? Acne?"
Harry blinked, feeling a bit struck. “Alright."
“Yeah, what’s wrong, Ronnie?” said George, sitting next to Harry.
Draco only grinned at him. "Bye, Potter," he threw over his shoulder as he walked away to join his team again. The Slytherins were discussing with Madame Hooch, who kept pointing angrily at a confused Crabbe. Draco firmly stood next to his friend, placing a hand on his shoulder and staring down at the professor while Montague argued with her.
he had realised he had touched a nerve. He could already picture the knowing grin stretching his lips and the cruel taunt that would follow.
With a snort, Harry turned around and walked away, looking over his shoulder as Draco waved at the air before settling down to sleep. The last thing Harry saw before exiting through the door was the blond covered up to his chin with the sheets. It was cute, and Harry found himself thinking about the four-letter word again.
" he said on a bad imitation of Draco's voice that still managed to make Harry's heart stop.
“It’s very clean, Harry!” said Hermione in approval. She made a beeline to the shelf next to his desk, where he kept all the books he had. It would be a hassle to stuff them back in his trunk, but Sirius had insisted on unpacking everything.
"It's you," stated Ron, looking at him earnestly. "You should teach us, mate."
After a way-too-brief explanation, Snape had them pair up to practice. Harry followed his trail around the room, watching as he stopped to speak with Parkinson, most likely to give her the advice he reserved for his House. Parkinson listened and nodded, then made to try again. In front of her, Draco prepared to shield himself. His posture was stiff.
Harry smiled at that. “Do you spend much time there?"
“Well, bye,” said Harry hastily, only pausing on his steps after Dumbledore when Dudley approached with an extended big hand.
“Alright, but I want to run a practical diagnostic spell first.”
“Draco, you did it!” Harry exclaimed, jumping up and scooping Draco into his arms.
“Calm down, Malfoy,” Harry yelled, starting to get angry himself.
But despite their proximity as colleagues, Draco never let Harry into his personal circle. And although it took a while for Harry to eventually come to terms with his deeply-rooted attraction to the blonde, once he did, it made the seemingly unbridgeable gap between them that much more upsetting. After much needling on his part Harry was able to strike up a level of banter befitting co-workers-slash-friendly rivals - even being able to make the odd war joke here and there - but it was always other people Draco left with for friday night drinks or passed personal messages through. They had never even worked intimately on the same assignment before - until now, that was. Harry saw this as his chance to finally get closer to the other man and planned to ask Draco out for dinner or drinks after the successful conclusion of the case.
“What? D-don’t be absurd,” he stuttered.
“Decerno te..."
“What the fuck?” Harry exclaimed, standing up in surprise.
“I don’t think you have it in you, Saint Potter.”
“Ugh,” Harry groaned, stabilizing himself before he fell over in a heap. “Hate that.”
“My body is fine. Is that all?”
“Harry! Malfoy!”
“Open your mouth,” he commanded, his voice low and completely foreign to his own ears.
“We need to talk.”
After a relatively short summer spent away from seeing each other somewhat regularly, Harry expected to meet the same quiet version when their training began. However, Draco had once again undergone a transformation - or perhaps, reversion - showing up on day one with a fierce look in his eyes and trademark sneer on his lips, as if daring anyone to challenge his right to be there. Back was the sharp-tongued and imperious ice prince of Slytherin and Harry’s blood was set on fire.
Draco’s attention snapped back to the Mirror, sheer panic out of place on his normally placid face.
“I...” Draco bit his lip. “I don’t think you’re capable of doing it properly!”
“Explicabo te..."
Harry could merely watch as Draco walked out of the barn without looking back. He didn’t take a single step for a long while even after hearing the crack of disapparition. He stood stunned - angry, lost, hurt - and utterly unsure of how to move on. Eventually at some point Harry found his way back to the inn, equal parts relieved and anxious to have not run into Draco. He started to break out of his dazed state after washing and changing into clean clothes, pacing around his room in thought.
At the thought of that, Draco wanted to laugh. The lengths they took to conceal their relationship. He even flew across the globe the Muggle way. Lucius would die from a heart attack if he knew—assuming he still had the energy to care.
“Patience, Potter,” Malfoy hummed. Gently, he prodded Harry’s entrance with a finger. His brows raised when it slipped easily. “Were you also this loose before?”
Harry didn’t die in a marine accident. Five years from the war, two months after Draco left Ajawera. Harry died seven years ago.
“I said I’m—,” Harry's sentence was cut as a shudder ran through his body from his proximity with Malfoy, making him double over. He wanted to just curl up on the stone floor and die of embarrassment as his cock throbbed under his robe.
Potter laughed. “Was it bad?”
? “I didn’t know you’d… you’d ever want to kiss me?” He nearly winced from how breathless he sounded.
“It’s so fucking freezing here.”
There were so many good memories in the regal looking garden.
Harry narrowed his eyes as he felt heat creeping up his neck. “Since when are you able to be sneaky?”
