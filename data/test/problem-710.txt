Trying to remain as flush to the wall as possible, Harry slinked after Draco, watching the heels of his boots disappear down the corridor opposite the bathrooms. He could hear Hermione and Ron behind him cottoning on to his disappearance and starting to call for him.
Still twirling his wand, Draco surveyed the closet they’d found themselves in for the first time. He found the standard fare: dormant self-cleaning supplies that probably triggered themselves automatically when the floor cleared in the back and a wall of shelves stacking higher than the the width of the hall outside into the unseen. Boxes stacked neatly on each one.
“Revenge of course.”
Behind them, a young witch in purple robes with the flag of Albania stitched into the lapel rushed excitedly down the hall toward another witch who seemed too invested in a scroll she was reviewing to notice. She jumped a little as the witch in purple latched onto her arm.
“How do you know I leave at 5:30 every day?”
Mordha glanced to the pin coming to rest at his foot. Brow furrowed, he glanced up toward the spot it had fallen from, a soft aborted “Whaaaa” faded before the word could be fully realized as his gaze landed on Scams.
Harry supposes this is where he made his mistake. He’d been assigned as the lead for security, which mainly consisted of weekly meetings to divide the security resources and concoct complex security measures to keep everyone attending the iMage safe and well hidden from muggles. They’d already staged a vague construction plan on a city’s worth of forest with the help of the muggle parliament to secure a plot of land big enough to support over 100 participating wizard countries.
“Ok, we’re off.” She patted the side of her bag and hugged Harry again, patting his cheek with one hand. “Happy Birthday, Harry. I hope it has been memorable.” She glanced briefly at Draco before kissing Harry’s cheek. She did the same to Draco. “Don’t be a stranger, Draco. I’m sure Scams would love a visit.”
Draco twirled his wand again, shrugging. “Mordha gets on my nerves.” He said it simply, but Harry felt like it was a rehearsed response. Something he’d tell anyone who asked if he were caught.
“You had to have known that wasn’t going to happen. At least not when you work for the ministry. Don’t all aurors have some sort of trace?”
Even so, there were only so many circular routes he could throw in before Draco cottoned on and Harry eventually led them to the evidence hall. He gave Draco a smirk and then scoped the hallway out one more time just to be sure they were alone. He took out his wand, performing a complicated pattern over the iron door blocking their entry.
“Better start with his office then.”
Their voices faded but Harry didn’t seem to find relief in that. If anything, his face had gotten redder and Draco was beginning to become concerned.
“Sorry, I missed that section of my education. Given robe, will wear as given.”
The other witch snorted in response, now fully distracted from her task. “I miss all the good bits. Tell me everything.”
“We have emergency port keys that are trackable upon our person, but that I can take off and put in a drawer. Merlin, she’s had a tab on my every move for years.”
Draco had to laugh. Scams took advantage of both their distraction to clutch at the pin Draco had hidden in his pocket. Harry smirked but said nothing.
“Sorry. ‘Mione - she still has a trace on me.”
Harry covered his mouth to muffle a snort but Mordha seemed to be experiencing some sort of inner turmoil and hadn’t moved an inch. Hermione and Ron began surveying the room. Harry quickly swung the invisibility cloak over himself, laughing quietly at the clump of cake clinging to Ron’s shoulder, even as he reached a finger out to swipe at the bit of frosting on the edge of Mione’s jaw.
Once the dust had settled after the war and the British wizarding society had shaken off Voldemort’s darkness, it quickly became apparent how separate the different parts of their culture around the world kept themselves. Harry and his class of auror trainees were stationed in America shortly after making it through the academy and were shocked to learn how little the American’s were aware of what exactly had happened less than a year ago across the pond. Shacklebolt, then settling comfortably in his new roll as minister, had been deeply troubled by the news. He sent the team of young aurors to various countries with a strong wizarding presence, quickly learning that most, if they’d heard of it at all, considered the war more of a strong criminal that was easily squashed by a teenager rather than a mad man hell bent on immortality and power.
Harry hadn’t realized how much he’d wanted this until he drew back, searching Draco’s eyes and waiting for his usual post first kiss thoughts to intrude like they always did. How something always felt off – a slight bit disappointing. Like Mordha who used way too much tongue, or Ginny who always took the lead, or the other failed fumbles who felt dull, or smelled off, or didn’t grip his arms right.
Harry hated these things, any and all parties really. Always a beacon of unwanted attention, he tended to forget what to do with his face. Scowl like he wanted, and he’d seem ungrateful or too good for whatever event he was at. Never one to master the politician smile, his forced grins always came off just slightly on the wrong side of deranged. He settled for many small sips from progressively less strong mugs of ale while reassuringly patting his inside pocket where he kept his invisibility cloak for comfort. It’d been years since he’d actually needed to use it to escape one of these things. But he kept it on him just in case, thankful for it now more than ever.
Draco blinked in response, not quite knowing how to accept a fully-grown man fearing possibly one of the least deadly animals, magical or otherwise, on the planet. The niffler was literally built around the ability to be adorable, non-threatening, and stealthy as fuck. Dangerous to your material valuables - only dangerous to your personal safety if you’re susceptible to death by cuteness.
Harry pulled himself to full height, the auror mask sliding firmly in place. Draco had to give a little shiver. Watching Auror Potter work was one of his favorite pastimes. One he didn’t get to participate in nearly enough.
Draco could understand how horrible that must feel having been under constant scrutiny his first few years out of Azkaban. He pulled out his wand. “So, let’s remove it.”
He smiled when Draco released his hold on Harry’s robes, concentrating on his hands straightening out the wrinkles he’d left behind.
“You just said you were too old for this.” Harry countered.
Draco knew how she felt. There was a surreal joy found under the invisibility cloak with Harry who’d hunched over in an effort to keep his laughter as silent as possible. Draco had to lean into his bodyweight to support Harry as he too couldn’t maintain any mask of indifference whilst watching a thirty-year-old wizard losing spectacularly to a five-pound niffler.
“Then we wait.” Harry nodded emphatically.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, didn’t tell you? I have a magical wildlife sanctuary. We have more than ten little nifflers roaming around. There was quite the breeding boom a few years ago.” Luna looked up suddenly, “You alerted me to it yourself, Draco. We rehomed what we could from that breeding raid, but some with the stickier fingers stay with me where we provide all the shiny seeking enrichment activities to keep them satisfied.
“Cake-pocalypse,” Harry muttered, turning his attention back to Scams. Draco thought the term was a fitting title for his success. He wondered if Cake-pocalypse should go under the hobby section of his CV.
Final chapter up tomorrow! Hope you've enjoyed it so far!!
Harry contemplated Draco’s hunch, thinking back to the last time Hermione had lifted the trace, now wondering if it was all for show or if she’d actually done it and then replaced it. She couldn’t have faked it though; he’d felt the separation.
Harry shook his head, the red from his face draining, but he still clenched his fists at his side. It felt like a physical way to shake out the irritation and calm himself. When he thought he had himself under control again, he glanced at Draco, feeling the rest fade when he noticed how hesitant he stood.
Draco hesitantly stepped forward before pausing. “What exactly did you have in mind?”
“Hindsight,” Harry murmured. He thought on the Draco he knew now, tried to align the man he was getting to know with the idea he had of Draco back in school. Harry couldn’t imagine Hogwarts Draco planning harmless cake exploding expeditions, but Harry often only saw what he wanted to back then.
A hush fell over the already quiet flour and heads came popping out of doorways. His own scream seemed to shock Mordha before he came to his senses. Scams stood on the mantle, eyeing him.
“She won’t steal it. Doesn’t mean she doesn’t want to be near the most valuable thing around.”
Harry smiled at Luna’s retreating back, and Draco felt a pang of sadness watching Scams hug her new pin to her chest.
Draco stood with his back against the wall, leg propped up behind him and a satisfied smirk on his face while he watched person after person fight for bathroom access.
A ball of flying keys hovered over her desk. Less than six millimeters in size, the keys looked like a swarm of angry bees, plinking against the invisible barrier keeping them contained in the clear floating globe.
Draco had one hand fisted in Harry’s robes over his chest, the other hand splayed around the back of his neck, a thumb sweeping the bottom edge of his hairline still, gentle and comforting and perfect. Perfect in a way that Harry wanted to settle into the moment. Build a house around it and live in it. He felt like he could probably spend his whole life in that house and still not find anything wrong with this moment.
Still, the hallway remained blissfully empty, and it was almost five o’clock, so Harry was feeling less and less bothered by the trace Hermione had on him.
Harry started to fidget nervously in Draco’s silence. He didn’t know why he wanted a favorable review from Draco, but it felt oddly like a date, this whole adventure, and Harry was as nervous as he’d always been at the end of dates. Only more so because Draco was looking just a tad bit disappointed and Harry started reviewing the entire past couple hours to see where exactly it’d gone wrong.
Harry shrugged. “Bosses from outside my own damn department throw me atrocious surprise parties. If anything went amiss, everyone would know right away.”
He didn’t think there was a wealth of ice breakers for such a situation. Harry began tapping his wand rhythmically against the floor. Draco had to smile at how nostalgic he looked. That tapping wand had echoed around a fair few of Draco’s Hogwarts memories.
“Well, then my earlier assumption still stands.” Draco postured like one of his ancient old white peacocks. Harry would’ve argued his point if he didn’t sort of agree with it. Instead, he continued forward, repeating his early actions on the still sleeping Gathy until the live evidence locker key was safely back in its orb with the other keys.
“Everyone expects me to have my own security detail. Anyone would be far too dumb to pull off a successful kidnapping if they thought they could come after me here.”
Draco physically shuddered at the telling off he’d be getting in the near future. Though, Pansy would understand. If not now, then when she was covered in significantly less frosting. “Unintended consequence, I guess.”
Harry huffed, dropping the cloak to his waist. “You said you wanted adventure, and that’s what we’re going to do.”
A key shot out from amidst the pack, landing delicately in the offered palm and growing in size. Harry leaned in closer to Draco, ignoring his own desires to watch Draco’s reaction to the new proximity and concentrating instead on Gathy, making sure she still snored loudly. Snore on she did, and Harry plucked the now full-sized key from Gathy’s palm as the purple wave retreated and the keys resumed their endless loops around their glass prison.
Harry leaned closer, Draco’s favorite smirk firmly in place. “Mordha’s scared of nifflers.”
“Clearly she prefers finer things.” Draco patted his robe proudly.
“Do what?”
Harry had to roll his eyes. “Not very creative, I know. She belonged to a muggle jewelry thief.”
“Alright there?”
Draco smiled at him, a small genuine thing that Harry rarely saw directed at him. He tried to ignore his heart fluttering in his throat.
“I’m an adult now, Potter.” Draco raised himself to full height now, a picture of his father’s old stance that also used to make Harry roll his eyes. “I can’t be running around under invisibility cloaks.”
Draco hurried over to Harry, disregarding the man in favor of the little one in his hands.
People gathered outside Mordha’s office now, laughing as he unsuccessfully tried to catch, hurt, maybe scare Scams from his office. Draco and Harry took the opportunity of the commotion to inch into the office unnoticed. Harry thought Scams probably knew what she was doing. She could easily outwit someone like Mordha who’d so far had ignored his fully functional wand, the sole item left on his now cleared desk.
“You leave work at 5:30 everyday you’re not on a mission. I assume it’s specifically designed to wear off at 5:30.” He nodded. “Seems your after-work exploits have not been tracked.”
Draco arched his brow at Harry who shrugged. “The ministry thinks she’s unsafe for release, but the one thing muggle’s do right is animal training. Scams here seems to follow a host of commands and won’t outright take anything unless directed.”
“No, I can stay,” Draco rushed in. “I didn’t think you’d want me to.” Draco busied himself settling in to avoid watching Harry’s reaction to his confession.
The room held a series of tiny cages, no more than forty, twenty on each side with a heavy metal door in front of them. Draco followed slowly behind Harry, peeking into each cage front, some opening to large expansive rooms, one pin holing to a small dark hole, two red eyes peeking out at Draco. The metal door at the end was hard to look at, like it had a weak Notice-Me-Not spell on it, which would make sense if one needed to find a door without being tempted to open it. A faint metallic tapping echoed from the inside, rhythmic, smooth, and uninterrupted. Draco couldn’t think of any instance where his curiosity would drive him to figuring out what exactly was kept behind that door.
“Alright you,” he said, lifting Scams from his pocket. Scams fell back on her bottom in his palm and hugged the pin to her chest, obviously gearing up to say goodbye to it. Once Draco had her eye level, he waited until he had her attention. “You can have the pin as a reward for a job well done.”
Harry, not knowing what to say now either, followed Draco’s curiosity. Lifting the lid on one of the boxes and rushing to grab the single yellow sheet that burst from the open box.
Draco grasped Harry’s waist to stop his momentum once he realized he had little choice but to bump right into him as softly as possible. Harry planted his feet and gripped the hand at his waist.
“They’re the same ministry ordered uniform, Draco.”
“Hmm?” Harry still watched the now fading lines.
“Ron’s in on this?!” Harry spluttered, feeling betrayed and wondering how to get him back.
Not needing to worry about making noise in the already overbearingly loud chamber, Harry almost sprinted to the door he was looking for. He stopped at a bit of wall, and Draco waited as Harry performed another complicated pattern in front of the wall which caused a door to appear with a lock in the middle. Harry inserted the pilfered key and stepped through the closed door that had turned incorporeal once unlocked. Draco followed after.
For at least 2 of their 3 years working at the ministry together, Draco was satisfied, grateful even, to be on the farthest orbital path of Potter’s attention from his place in the financial offices a full 15 floors above the Auror bullpen. The crossover between the two offices could be narrowed down to the frequent exchange of allowance for undercover operations. Which wasn’t exactly Draco’s expertise.
He specialized in the more lucrative, but unstable, monetary generating initiatives from various muggle investment opportunities. Think of a ministry sanctioned black market for magical cures for muggle ailments and you have Draco’s day-to-day.
Harry turned back to Draco, holding Scams between them. “Ok, I’m going to crack the door open, and Scams?” Scams hoisted herself up on her back feet. Her nose twitched eagerly, waiting for a command. “You have my permission to pocket anything shiny and bury it in the Wych Elm pot next to his desk.”
“The cake bomb.”
Harry cast a nonverbal Tempus. “For 5:30.”
Satisfied that her thanks was well received, Scams retreated back down Draco’s arm and leapt into Luna’s arms. Luna opened the flap on the bag strapped across her chest to deposit Scams inside.
“Revenge seems a little dark for your image, Potter.”
Without thinking about it much longer, Draco stepped forward, very close to Harry. He took a second, only just, to analyze Harry’s reaction for any hint of distaste or hesitance before closing that minuscule gap between them and kissing him.
Harry felt pleased, not analyzing why too closely. Instead, he slid down the wall this time.
“Still with the cryptic.”
Harry laughed, head dropping to Draco’s shoulder, both loving the cheesy sentiment and how only Draco could deliver it so clinically and perfect.
“I’ve got to rescue Scams. Follow me,” Harry whispered to the empty space Draco inhabited only sure of his whereabouts by the grip he held on Draco’s invisible wrist.
Hermione mumbled something Harry had to strain to try and hear. “He’s still in the ministry, so it’s likely safe to assume this wasn’t a master kidnapping plot.”
“Last year, Davies got kidnapped from his own office.” Draco’s arched brow leveled Harry, and he huffed.
“‘Here’s ta ya on yer birthday, Mr Potter.” She raised a phantom glass in the air, as if in cheers. Harry didn’t pay her any attention outside of a quick nod of acknowledgement.
And then further back. Every hateful word spewed between them during the war and before. Every article about the tainted name of Malfoy, the latest published not a fortnight ago in the Daily Prophet. Even if everything he’d hoped came true, they couldn’t stand up under the weight of that history. No one could thrive in a death eater’s shadow.
Harry turned back to the black door. He leaned forward and Draco had to follow lest the invisibility cloak stretch too far and reveal his feet. The floor was rather quiet with only a few delegates milling about in the corridor. Draco was distracted by Harry’s responding smirk when they both realized Mordha was in his office. It was highly reminiscent of every shit-eating grin Harry had given Draco back in Hogwarts when he’d tried to get him in trouble.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, and released Draco’s hand, biting the inside of his lip to stop himself from saying anything embarrassing. Instead, he tried to calm his heart and ignore Draco’s rather warm hand still gripping his waist. “Right,” Harry cleared his throat and twisted in Draco’s grip. Draco’s hand fell away, but the action brought his attention to the fact that it was still there in the first place and a blush bloomed prettily across his cheeks. Harry tried not to stare, especially this close.
“What are you all laughing for?” Mordha, briefly distracted by his impending niffler doom, yelled into the crowd after a particularly large guffaw from a shriveled old wizard drew his attention to his growing audience.
Draco had known of little Scam’s existence for less than an hour but he already felt attached. The thought of her sitting back in that evidence locker with whatever creepy thing banged behind that metal door made him uneasy. Scams seemed to echo the sentiment and hunkered down in Draco’s pocket.
Draco watched the stag hop around the room once before dissipating into thin air. He never didn’t get a chill watching anyone’s patronus in action, specifically his own raven.
“What?”
Draco let go of the cloak, his hand clapping loudly against his leg where he dropped it like a dead weight. “You’re going to make me say it.” Draco said with a cringe.
He seemed taller, which shocked Harry for some reason. Like all this time and he’d not noticed how tall the bloke had gotten. Tall and handsome, but Harry didn’t want to concentrate on the second bit and fixated more on the first. Draco, like always, seemed to know exactly when Harry was close, his head tilting a bit to the side, eyeing the seemingly empty hallway.
“Success,” Harry chimed, nudging Draco with his shoulder. Draco smirked and gestured for Harry to lead on. He did without hesitation, grabbing Draco’s hand this time while they snuck around Gathy who’s hand had returned to the desk gently.
“I want to go on an adventure.” Draco said through gritted teeth, cheeks flaming redder than before. Harry couldn’t stop the word adorable from flitting across his mind.
Harry smiled reassuringly. “Come on. We can’t have your first Harry Potter Adventure consist solely of closet squatting.” Harry shook out his invisibility cloak, and Draco would be lying if he said he didn’t have to suppress actually jumping in excitement. Instead, he rose that petulant eyebrow, causing a chuckle from Harry who shook the shimmering fabric enticingly.
Except then Harry reached out, recovering from his own shock, and placed a heavy, warm hand on his waist. The spark of him ignited every dark, negative thought until Draco was on fire in the best way.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I wanted you knocked down a peg most of the time, not maimed or killed.”
But that just wasn’t Draco’s style.
Draco cocked an eyebrow. “Need to send a memo?”
“Your hunch?”
Once he was done, he eyed the pattern that made no sense to Harry but Draco read like a book.
“We?” Draco countered and Harry frowned.
Harry lit up. “Of course, I am;” he couldn’t help his smile then. No matter how their relationship had changed since Hogwarts, wars, and adulthood in between, Harry still liked to one up him.
Harry watched as Scams seized this distraction to launch herself at Mordha. If Mordha’s initial scream was loud, his last scream was nothing short of piercing and terrified. Scams roamed his shirt, dipping in and out of the pockets in his open robes. Draco would see hints of sparkle while Scams stuffed all the valuables he found into her pouch. When she scrambled up his neck to pluck out his ridiculously big diamond earring (the one that Harry always thought made him look like a middle aged muggle going through a midlife crises), Mordha flung her off his shoulder, his yells for security drowned out by the laughing crowd.
If anything, the shiny glow simply became more polished. As much as he’d always convinced himself that he knew Potter, how could he not with their history, and that he’d had enough experience to fuel his assumptions about him, this day felt like a glimpse into something new and exciting but not … enough.
“Let me in,” Draco said, feeling the edge of the cloak still pulled taught in Harry’s hands as he resisted the tug.
“Along with everyone else in school,” Draco sniffed, willing his nerves away.
Harry snorted. “Picture it often?”
Harry eyed him, impressed. Draco tried not to preen at the attention. Harry looking at him in approval never failed to feed his inner childhood Draco.
“I always thought you’d imagine a more gruesome end to those adventures back then.”
Harry decided to call his bluff, shrugging the cloak around himself so only the front of his face remained like some animated mask that was honestly quite a creepy sight even for Draco whose world was full of creepy sights.
He ignored them, also ignoring caution and bumping into a few people here and there in his quest to catch up to Draco. The confection covered victims paid little mind to the invisible nudge.
“Harry told me about this little one. The ministry thinks she’s better under lock and key, but we don’t think so, do we?” She reached out a finger to scratch Scam’s belly. She still hadn’t relinquished Draco’s pin but did appreciate the attention in any case.
They made quick work of ascending the levels of the ministry up to the department of international affairs. The floor was at the very top of the magically expanded building, a recent addition to facilitate countless foreign dignitaries as the entire world prepared for the Olympics of the wizarding world. It reminded both Harry and Draco of the tri-wizard cup in their fourth year with significantly less deadly results and neither of their active participation.
Draco clutched the pin, laughing a bit at the disappointed frown the niffler gave in response to his thwarted plan. He pocketed the pin, returning with a silver, shiny galleon. He handed it to the niffler’s reaching grasp. Harry watched with a polite smile, scratching a single finger into the pleased niffler’s fur.
It came rather quickly, thank Merlin. Mordha disappeared with a soft pop and reappeared not seconds later with a cake lit with 25 candles, the flames vacillating through all the colors of the rainbow as it floated toward Harry. Harry couldn’t help thinking of Dobby all those years ago in the Dursley’s living room.
“You can relax.” Draco muttered.
It’s amazing what months of comparing notes and evidence can do to buff a childhood rivalry into something shiny and almost resembling a friendship. If Draco had stopped there, all would be well.
Harry crouched down and didn’t complain. Draco had an air of expectation that was sort of catching; so, they’d navigate too short cloaks and spontaneous nefarious activities together.
Draco could see Mordha now laughing too loudly and telling all who’d listen how this was his plan, his surprise for his Harry. Draco felt his magic crackle across his fingertips at that and had to refocus on the dreadfully boring conversation about the American muggles stock exchange he’d attached himself to, giving the barest amount of attention while still responding correctly, surreptitiously waiting for his moment.
The niffler sat back at Draco’s approach before scurrying up Harry’s shoulder, standing tall and expectant as Draco got a closer look. The niffler hopped over to Draco’s shoulder suddenly, and Draco tried not to startle. Harry chuckled in any case.
“Not really,” he said with an apologetic but hopeful glance. “But it has to be some form of finite, right? All the major cancellation spells are.”
Draco chuckled. “Calm down. I can’t tell who gives it to you, just that it’s ingested and has a shelf-life.”
Usually Harry hated meetings but being in the DOI reminded him a bit of traveling abroad, and he found himself not minding his constant trips up. Mordha had seemed innocent at first. Just another accented person who couldn’t give a toss about what Harry’d done when he was barely eighteen.
“You know, when I pictured being in on one of Potter’s greatest adventures, I’d always thought it’d be more … eventful.”
The closer they got to Mordha’s office, the more Harry replayed every exaggerated hello or casual touch shared between them. Mordha had an irritating way of waiting until the most important witnesses were around for his little shows of affection whenever he’d approach Harry in the beginning. He did seem genuine, if not over enthusiastic, at first, and Harry was known for his obliviousness. He’d also not been with anyone seriously since Ginny and one offs were getting a bit redundant. One could hardly blame him for falling for Mordha’s attentions.
“What does Scams have to do with revenge?”
Scams whole body shivered with anticipation. Harry wordlessly used his wand to open Mordha’s office door just enough for Scams to squeeze through. A terrible hollow moan of pain greeted them from inside the office. The gap in the door was just wide enough for Harry and Draco to glimpse Mordha sitting at his desk with his face covered by his hands. Draco took great pleasure in Mordha’s obvious mortification and defeat.
Draco’s hand tensed under Harry’s and he tried to retract it as inoffensively as possible. “Warn a bloke,” he muttered, keeping a careful eye on Scam to avoid looking at Harry directly.
“They do?” Harry didn’t see the point of his question.
Scams rotated Draco’s financial department pin in its tiny hands, making the floating lights glint of the shiny surface while they walked. Draco thought it was possibly the cutest thing he’d ever seen. So cute in fact, that said cuteness distracted him from the fact that Harry had stopped in front of a black door with little warning.
“Fine.” Draco stood, gesturing to Harry with his wand. It was a source of triumph for both that Harry hadn't flinched at the action and Draco didn’t falter. Instead, Draco began making complex movements with his wand over the space Harry stood, a thin yellow line appearing in the air to track the movement.
“No,” Harry said firmly, a new spark of anger flaring. “I made her remove it after the war. Seventeen years of my life I’d had some sort of trace on me and it’s not like anyone stepped in when I needed it.” He leaned back against the wall under the weight of old wounds he thought were well enough along to healed. “I told her I didn’t want it. Made her promise she’d remove it in fact. She lied to me.”
“Watch your pin.” Harry pointed to his lapel pin on his uniform robe.
Draco took a moment to breathe deeply, welcoming the silence of the room. Harry lifted the cloak off both of them and stepped forward. Draco thought this was probably living up to his idea of a Harry Potter adventure so far.
“You’re taking her?”
Harry picked up Scams who climbed his shoulder again, eyeing Draco’s disembodied head. Draco smirked and reached a hand out. Scams hoped over, running down his arm and back to his pocket, clutching Draco’s pin with glee. “We don’t have to put her back, do we?”
Harry nodded, as if to say, ‘it’s true,’ and picked up the discarded cloak. Harry draped it over both of them before opening the door back to the evidence atrium. Scams popped farther out Harry’s pocket as they walked, glancing up at Draco every so often as he reached over to Draco’s pocket. Eventually, he slipped inside soundlessly when he met no resistance from Draco who snorted in response.
Draco gave him a glare dripping with the obvious. “You’re on duty, Potter.”
“How’d a muggle get a hold of a niffler?”
The iMage was a month-long competition and magical fair where teams competed for the top spot in various magical events while a sort of magical world’s fair rose around them, shops toting wears from every attending country mixed together. Or that’s what it was going to be. And why Deglan Mordha was here, along with a delegate from every country, on the new floor dedicated to planning the event to take place in six months’ time.
They walked toward the alcove in the middle that held a desk with a sleeping elderly woman so skinny and frail that she looked more specter than person. Her snores drowned out the shuck, shuck, click of the cabinets in the surrounding area, and Draco would be impressed if it didn’t create a painfully loud symphony.
Harry could almost hear the shrug in Ron’s voice, “I suspect he seized an opportunity.”
He gave Harry his signature cocky grin. Harry tried not to blush at the implications of his statement before shooting Draco a grin of his own.
“Or maybe he created it,” Shacklebolt offered in that confusing tone where you couldn’t tell if he was pleased or angered by whatever was happening.
Harry turned to him quickly, “You know how?”
He supposed he should’ve saw through the ruse quickly. Mordha had a funny habit of always trying to be the loudest, funniest, smartest person in the room, even when he failed at it. He may not have cared what Harry had accomplished during the war, but he did care that Harry was obviously important to the ministry and therefore someone worth attaching too.
Draco stood half listening to the conversation on the other side of the door and wondering how funny it would be to pop out of the closet for a real surprise until he noticed how rigid Harry had become.
“Get out! You foul thief!” Mordha yelled. Forgetting he was a wizard momentarily, he began grabbing random items off his cluttered desk and hurling them at Scams. Scams became rather indignant at having to dodge the scrolls, quills, half full coffee cop, and picture frames sailing her way. Draco thought she looked to be having the time of her life.
Even solely being involved in the security detail for the event felt too close to the tournament for Harry but such is an auror’s life.
Scams didn’t concern herself with Mordha, only looking baffled at the pendant that was now much farther from reach than she’d like. Mordha on the other hand couldn’t not notice her. His face drained of color as he surveyed the now much barer room quickly, but his eyes slammed back on Scams as if he knew she couldn’t be trusted out of sight while he released the loudest scream Draco had ever heard emitted from anyone.
And sure enough, Lucius had received a life sentence.
That is, there
Harry can’t help but agree. He’s not blind. He
Draco pauses, turning to face him properly. “Nightmares? I thought they were getting better.”
That explains why he hadn’t been drinking at the Halloween party then, despite practically everyone in Gryffindor house pressing a drink into his hands. Neville had mostly passed them off to Seamus or Harry, both chugging each drink down immediately to raucous cheering with little prompting.
For Draco, walking through King’s Cross feels like a victory march.
He’s so tired.
And the challenge in his eyes, bidding them to try anyway. Those that take him up on it regret their decision quickly. The war was a hard teacher, but Draco is a
I did some minor but kinda important edits to the last chapter. Just added a handful of lines to the end bit. I wasn't really happy about it when I posted it the first time. The edit made me feel a bit better.
Anton blinks. “Like what?”
He should be cold. Is he cold?
Indignance bubbles up in Harry’s chest. He’s responsible for his own actions, no one else is. Before he can say as much, Luna turns to face Zabini, three fingers pressed to her chest.
McGonagall now, Harry supposes. It’s odd to look up at the head table and not see Dumbledore with his twinkling eyes. No matter how much he resented the old man’s involvement in his life towards the end of the war, there was no denying that Harry loved him, as complicated as that love was, as one of the first adults who showed him that he
Samhain. He might’ve been… jostled loose for a little bit.” Though even as he said it, Harry sees how Malfoy bites his lip a little, as if he wasn’t entirely convinced of his own reasoning.
Somewhere, he hears his name. Someone calling him, trying to be heard over the wind, someone behind him on the sandy bank. For a moment he thinks that he should go see what they want.
There was nothing simpler than a rag and a bucket of soapy water. Harry would clean the house, top to bottom, over and over, until his hands were raw. He had kept the windows shut so the dust would accumulate more quickly and give him more surfaces that needed cleaning.
This is where it starts.
Same, Cailleach, same.
The water is cold. He can feel the gentle waves lapping at his arms where they dangle by his side.
All the tables had been shrunk when the castle saw that there were many less students returning this year, but Harry sees now that the Slytherin table still looked slightly bare even then.
Malfoy seems like he’s keeping his cool though, wearing a neutral look on his face as he trades comments with Zabini under his breath. But Harry sees his eyes constantly moving, cataloguing exits, scanning over the first years being sorted, and occasionally meeting an acquaintance’s gaze and nodding. He claps politely, the gesture lazy, after every first year’s sorting.
A pillow hits him in the face. “Shut. Up.” Blaise growls. “I thought we were done with this.”
The little boy shrugs. “I don’t know. Everyone. Theo said they might be. What if they are?” He looks up, and –
“My-, “ Harry drags in a breath, sharply. “
(And maybe he’s a little lonely too, but he’d never admit that to them.)
Potter narrows his eyes. “What could you even want to learn from me?”
“Some.” Blaise grunts through the fabric of one of his remaining pillows. “Godwin’s sleeping through the night finally. But the boys are still having trouble.”
He tilts his head up to the moon and watches it drip, light leaching out of it to fall somewhere beyond the horizon. The night is dark and quiet. He watches as even the stars dim slightly, as a great wind rustles through the trees.
Luna giggles and Harry can’t help the smile that comes onto his face when he hears it. She brightens any room she walks in and he counts himself lucky that they’re friends.
From there both Harry and Neville can see the whole space, having arranged the chairs so that they could cover each other’s blind-spots. When he sits down, he’s suddenly conscious of the textured surface of the upholstery, the faint ink stains on the arms.
He blinks. Swallows hard.
Draco stifles a laugh. “Enjoy the revels, my lady. But I’m afraid that we must take our leave.”
But you don’t use wands at these sacred rituals. They predate wands. All the control work has to be done the traditional way, using their bodies and the movement of the stars.
Anton: Draco, I'm scared
“How did- how did I get here?” he asks. He doesn’t mean for it to come out sounding so small, so frightened.
Edit: 03/04/2020 Changed Julius to Julian and fleshed him out a bit. My pink haired, chaotic son.
“The Patronus. Teach me how to cast a solid Patronus.”
She pouts slightly, but nods, pulling Harry into a tight hug. “We’ll miss you, but we understand that you need this. And no one deserves a slice of peace than you do.”
A flash of black robes draws his eye to the right, and he watches as a girl who looks barely fifteen makes her way over to him on Blaise’s arm with a serene smile.
“Huh,” Harry says, as cracks begin to appear and web across the surface of his mirror. “This is a problem.”
It does mean though that instead of twelve each, they’re carrying twenty to face the veil.
“Just past two. Don’t worry, seems like everyone’ll be taking it slow today. We weren’t the only ones partying last night.”

“Tea?” Draco flicks his own wand and the tea service he had set aside earlier gets to work.

“Not much time, mind you. I have to be back at the common room in less than an hour.” Not strictly the truth, but since Blaise had taken over bedtime duties for Draco last night, Draco should probably cover for him tonight.
and Harry worries.
“Speak English,” Harry growls.
Despite all the homework and studying he has to do, something in him seems to settle as he goes through the Hogwarts routine. There are still days where his skin feels paper-thin, but so much is constantly happening around him, so many bits of meaningless gossip and little petty squabbles, so much stuff that doesn’t
He chats idly with Neville as he pulls himself together for the rest of the day, charming the curtains around Seamus’s bed so they wouldn’t wake him.
And every time, Harry would walk back into Grimmauld Place as the sun sets, hanging up his broom or shedding muddy boots. He’d sit in the overstuffed armchair by the fireplace with the sounds of Hermione pacing upstairs or Ron’s determined clattering in getting dinner ready harmonise with the house’s creaking.
A flick, and something the size of a snitch comes flying out from somewhere behind Harry. Malfoy snatches it out of the air to inspect it.
Draco’s eyes narrow at how Potter’s hand twitches at his side and- oh, look at that. He brought his wand along this time.
Both Harry and Draco just want to go to sleep.
Fair. It was a long shot anyway. “An exchange then.” He decides after a moment. “I teach you something, you do the same for me. Knowledge for knowledge.”
He locks eyes with Susan who is sweating, her hair whipping wildly behind her. She nods, and he takes another deep breath.
Not that it’s easy, even then. There’s a reason people mostly use wands to cast. The wands do half the work of channelling the magic to the right place and the effects of overloading a spell are minimised.
But here’s Luna, walking into Malfoy’s poncey room, with its poncey emerald-green, four-poster beds against the left wall, and a
Sorry this took so long to come out. I got so distracted. I just started Dragon Age: Origins, finished season 1 of the witcher, just started The Untamed. All three has me thoroughly shook. I am so obsessed.
The snakes make a commotion.
But Anton wouldn’t know the difference. Draco glances down at him. Safely on the train, Anton looks nervous, fingers knotting into the wool of his jumper. Normally, Draco would wait for him to initiate before addressing the situation, but Theo had warned him about his little brother’s anxiety attacks and how he works himself into a state if left alone to spiral.
I was so tempted to add an extra thousand or two words to this and make you wait longer but the
Malfoy shakes his head again. “But I think I can make it work. Hold on.”
Luna shakes her head. “He was looking scooped out on the train, but it got a little better. And then suddenly he was like this.”
“Three months with the dementors is a hell of a lot more than a slap on the wrist,” says Harry, staring with distant eyes into the corridor.
Harry pulls his eyes away from the window, hearing the tinge of concern underneath the exasperation in Seamus’ voice. He’s just in time to see Neville nudge Seamus with an elbow.
The Malfoy family had always had a knack for investing in businesses that would prove to be highly lucrative. They started as moneyed merchants, and over their five-hundred-year history, they’ve done what they do best. They bought shares. They networked. They funded just enough philanthropic projects to draw the
Neville nods. “It’ll do fine.”
They help each other move through the water. Harry can hear Luna’s breaths hitch as she wipes her eyes, can feel her shake. He feels horrible.
It puts him on edge. He can’t trust Malfoy to help him without an agenda of his own, but he can’t guess what it is Malfoy wants either. The whole thing leaves him feeling unbalanced. He hates being on the defensive, having to react instead of taking the initiative.
Returning to Hogwarts is nothing at all like what Harry had thought it would be.
“I’d drink to that. Heavily.”
, and immediately feels bad, because Luna is sitting right next to him, humming as she flicks through her magazine. Neville and Seamus are here too, catching up, along with Lavender and Parvati.
“Thanks, Greg.” Draco salutes him with the sandwich before practically inhaling it. He spares a moment to kick Blaise’s sandwich under the bedframe surreptitiously. “How did everyone else fare this morning.”
Luna waits until her painting is empty before pulling Harry down the halls again.
Harry goes downstairs to make some tea.
Malfoy nods, chin propped up on a hand. “Just minor rituals to remind your soul of how it fits in your body. Luna knows them if you need someone to teach you and your gaggle of lions can’t help.”
“Hello? Excuse me, Madame? Hello?”
He takes another breath and crosses the line out.
. We need your help.”
Your comments are a delight, seriously. I read over them when I'm trying to gear up to write and they honestly make my day. Thank you so much and I hope those of you coming back enjoyed this chapter too! <3
them all, left him feeling scooped out, just a thin, papery shell. He would find himself after a long and confusing day of trials back at Grimmauld scrubbing the kitchen floor clean.
Hello friends! This chapter took a little longer to come out, so I hope you're appeased by a slightly longer chapter this time. I'm so glad you liked Anton, the precious bean! He's a returning character don't worry.
Another groan, sounding more like a scream muffled by the pillows. If he hadn’t almost died barely an hour ago Harry would probably sympathise.
I was.”
, he’d never hear the end of it.
Neville purses his lips. “Not sure. By himself? Nah. But…” Neville eyes him carefully. “Malfoy. Think he’s up to something?”
He takes her through the next spin with a huff, but pulls her in gently as she slows down. He can hear her bones creak now as they dance. She moves like it aches, with her back hunched and her head level with his chest when before they stood almost eye-to-eye. Her hair is completely white where it streams down her back, strands falling out over Draco’s hand as they come to a stop.
“Did Potter barge into here in his sleep-clothes last night or was I hallucinating?”
“Remind me to send her some chocolates.”
Robinson eyes him for a moment before he returns the nod and retreats to his friends with a wave.
Any other first year and Draco would have thought that they had run afoul of a prank or a hazing ritual.
He still avoids the bathroom mirrors though, ducking his head while he brushes his teeth. And if his hair looks a little more disheveled it's not like anyone really notices.
He holds up a hand as Luna starts to protest, eyes still on Potter. “I heard you, Luna. I sat down with Harry Potter,
But this was Julian Selwyn. The boy had asked Draco for a sterilising charm on the second night of term, holding a needle aloft with the same, vaguely disinterested expression he’d worn when asking for the plate of roast potatoes at dinner.
(An absent part of Harry thinks that it must get cold in winter here and wonders how Slytherins heat up their rooms.)
Neville sighs. “I was afraid you’d say that.”
Good thing both Susan and Draco have the most precise spellwork seen at Hogwarts in decades. Only Hermione Granger could beat them in this.
“I would if I could,” says Luna earnestly. “But it’s urgent.”
Greg nods. “She’d probably like that.” The ritual was always a little harder on the Light contingent, what with it being so firmly in the Dark time of the year, and if Draco was feeling lethargic this afternoon then Susan is
“Yes,” he says. “I do.”
“How?”
Malfoy money and Black status.
“I suppose so.”
“C’mon Harry. You look like you’re on the train to Azkaban!”
, was Draco ever that small and pitiful?
But then again, there is very little about the current Malfoy walking the halls of Hogwarts that he is familiar with. His gait, the way he holds his shoulders. His friendship with Luna. Even his pointy face looks different somehow, though all the features are still the same.
shrieks the part of Harry still capable of registering danger), is almost completely dark and empty.
“I’m trusting you to take responsibility for him.”
Harry catches the rock before he even realises Malfoy had thrown something at him. “Oi,” he says, more out of reflex than anything else.
But the nightmares. Draco swallows down his worry. “He did well though,” he says. “Anton too.”
“Adorable little buggers. We’re sure to get the hellions though, aren’t we?”
Harry’s brain catches on the way Malfoy’s tongue curls around the French word in that sentence.
“Oh, that’s right! You’ve been there too! Charming house, isn’t it?” chimes Luna.
He blinks again.
“Are you sure, Draco?” Luna asks. “It’s not something more serious?”
They both move towards the hag, dragging their feet. She stops crooning for a moment to regard them as they sketch deep bows. “You did very well, children,” she croaks. “Very well indeed.”
“Harry? Are you sure you’re ok?”
And then there’s nothing left to do but to step through.
He’d seen Anton during the war walk up to his mad father, who had been in a rage after losing his quarry when even Lucius’ cool logic couldn’t calm him. The boy had been shaking all over, and yet his voice was clear, telling him to stop, to “please have a rest, dad”. He remembers feeling Theo beside him, standing on sheer willpower alone, remembers him stiffen all over and hold his breath, wand in hand. Thank Merlin for Narcissa Malfoy who had drawn the elder Nott’s attention away from the boys and back towards her husband.
The words hang in the air for a moment before a surge of magic courses through the ground, the lines of the star blazing for a moment. His hair moves with it as if swept by a great wind.
Everyone eats a sandwich.
, he thinks. He’ll have to keep an eye on Malfoy.
He glances at Malfoy who seems to be having the same feeling if the way he narrows his eyes suspiciously at her is any indication.
She presses a kiss to his brow and pulls away as she rises to her feet. She holds out her hand. “We’ll need help.” she says, as she hoists him up with more strength than he thought her tiny body could contain. “We need to see a dragon.”
“Draco, why don’t
If you ask Draco, everything can be traced back to the moment he turned sixteen and realised that his chances of turning seventeen was fading with every raspy inhale that Voldemort took in through his slitted nostrils.
Luna walks in without knocking, and for some reason, it’s that move that just about makes Harry ready to explode.
“Oh no. Harry,
Draco slumps back into his compartment after dropping Anton with a few other first years. When he had left, the boy had already been making fast friends with what looked like a Selwyn, bonding over their identical jumpers, of all things.
He keeps an eye on Anton from his side of the large space, watching him solemnly take his turn around the floor with one of his classmates on his arm. The elves had expanded an unused classroom for their use to accommodate all the people taking part in the ritual. Tiny as he is, Draco had lost sight of Anton several times during the night and only spotted him now on account of his dancing partner’s hair dyed a bright pink.
Maybe he should tell Ginny to try the older one out for beater.
He’s familiar with that look. He seems to inspire it often.
, but he-” Draco’s brows furrow. “He didn’t even pull out his wand.”
That’s twice tonight. Harry is getting really tired of being flicked at.
don’t you da-“
On second thought, Harry thinks he needs better friends.
*Edit: 06/02/2020
grown, child.”
No. He’d come to terms with his actions. There would be no more apologies, not to anyone.
Harry expects him to turn back to his mates, but Robinson lingers, scrunching his face thoughtfully before drawing closer. “Look, I should probably warn you. I saw one of Malfoy’s snakes sniffing around near here when we went to get the food. The big one, Goyle,” he says, voice lowered. “Don’t know what he was after, but he left quick when he saw us. Bastard shouldn’t be back at Hogwarts in the first place, after what he did, and I doubt he’s up to anything good. You’d better watch your back, Potter.”
. The times when Harry wakes up feeling empty and airy are few and far between.
Luna shakes her head. “I know them, but I’m not very good at them.”
The whole room seems to breathe as one, keeping time with the music as first Draco and his partner takes one step into the air just above the stone floor. The magic carries them up off the ground as they twirl, as if climbing a spiralling staircase. The rest follow them up to dance amongst the glass globes of captured
“You should do that.”
He still hasn’t technically finished his letters. But to be fair, he’s been putting off writing this particular one for a while now.
They sit there on the sand for a while, listening to the crickets. The moon hovers high in the sky still over the Black Lake, but Harry can’t bring himself to look directly at it. But he also can’t bring himself to look away, keeping it in his peripheral.
“We, children of the night, swallow the bread, the wine, the breath. We acknowledge our pain, our scars, our joys. We welcome the dark so our shadows may shelter the hungry.”
He kneels, bones creaking and limbs heavy. The lake water covers him like a shroud. He feels it stir his hair as it closes over his head with barely a ripple.
They crash onto their knees in the sand, panting. It’s too cold to stay outdoors while soaked for too long, but when Harry fumbles at his pockets for his wand, he can’t find it. Luna seems too distressed to pull out hers, clinging to his side while she catches her breath between soft sobs. He gives her head a few awkward pats. He hasn’t gotten any better at comforting crying people.
Harry had fully intended to testify at Malfoy’s trial, having done so at his mother’s to support her plea. The prosecutors had also clearly expected the younger Malfoy to do some squirming of his own, with the pile of parchment they had at the ready on their table during the trial.
Potter’ shoulders straighten, something shifting in his eyes. Draco thinks idly that this is probably what he’d look like on the battlefield, all fire and focus. “What do you want from me, Malfoy?” His voice is cold, controlled.
“Julian and Antonius.” Blaise turns his head slightly to smirk at him with one bleary eye, cheek creased by his pillow. “There’s a joke in there, somewhere.”
“I guess we’ll find out, one way or another,” Harry says after a swallow.
Huh. So he
“Why do I bother with having friends if they’re all just going to betray me at the earliest opportunity.” He turns to Greg, sitting on the other bench. “Well? Do you have anything to say about this, or can we move on to actual important things that need discussing, like say, how our teachers and peers are likely to attempt to assassinate us before NEWTS, or what to do if Anton decides he wants to be the next Dark Lord?”
He turns to Neville who has a concerned look on his face. It’s not full-fledged worry yet, so Harry gives him what’s hopefully a reassuring smile. “Yeah. Just… working through a problem in my head.”
surprised that none of the students in green ties have spontaneously combusted from the heat of the glares yet.
Neville chuckles. “Don’t strain anything.”
The Black family connection that Narcissa brought into her marriage set Draco to inherit not only the Malfoy businesses and shares, but also the legitimisation of an English Noble house. Draco’s sphere of influence in England and abroad is projected to be even wider than his parents, and he’d been trained accordingly since birth and walked with the confidence afforded him by his inheritance.
: Blaise, no, Blaise, listen. Why doesn't Potter think I'm scary? I need him to think I'm scary. I need him to feel things for me.
He fiddles with the stone in his pocket. That was another reason to not tell Ron and Hermione. If they hear that he’d had an encounter with Draco Malfoy and that he
, for you, and I will show him the base exercises to honour my word. But I will need something more than our friendship to cooperate any further.”
He catches a glimpse of movement at the corner of his eye and tenses. A wash of relief falls over him when he sees that it was just a portrait’s occupant shifting to peer out at them. Luna glances back at him and follows his gaze.
Meanwhile, Harry is silently having a crisis in his corner. “I didn’t know Malfoy was coming back this year,” he manages.
He doesn’t understand. Why does Luna want him out of the lake?
, thinks Harry.
Someone, somewhere, starts playing their cello again and more and more instruments join in. All around him the revellers bow to their dead partners, some bidding them goodbye and others inviting them to dance once more. Draco honestly just wants to sleep for a year.
“What?,” Ron struggled to stay on his feet pressed in between all of the bodies. He was obviously miserable in the noise and the heat.
“No dating?”  Ron willfully misunderstood.  “That’s too bad, but as it happens …”
“What reason?” Pansy asked, looking confused and intrigued.
The crowd went wild.
“Norberta?”  Harry asked and sure enough, the dragon’s large head swung their way as it began to sniff at them.
Wait.
“Wait, you are going to be the band photographer?  What do you know about photography?”
“I got some great pictures of the sunrise.”
“And the next year, fifth year, I swear Harry followed Draco around everywhere he went.”
Sliding down the Hortail’s leg, Draco sat back and took his first full breath since Harry had fallen.  “Never better,” he called back and the smile on his face was too full of relief to be anything but happy.
“Blaise.” That was Malfoy’s voice, deep and resonating, washing over the crowd with almost as much power as the chords of the music. People laughed again at the obvious scolding tone in that one word. The lights came up just enough for everyone to see Malfoy, tall and majestic, the microphone in hand as he peered back over his shoulder towards the keyboard and his bandmate.
“It’s not your fault the Wizengamot sentenced you to a year working with the Muggles any more than it is mine or Draco’s,” Pansy said kindly.
“I’ve seen him dance.” Pansy said to Draco.  “He’s got rhythm.”
Ron shook his head.  “I asked her.  I was hurt, but I thought, you know, something big came up.  People in danger and they needed her, something like that, you know.  But there wasn’t.  She just forgot.  Just ‘slipped her mind’.” Ron’s fingers making quote marks in the air.  “I can’t keep doing this.  I can’t keep making her my whole world when she can’t even be bothered.”
Ron nodded.  “I’m waiting for Harry.  If he caught the guy, we might have more to work with.  It won’t make any difference as far as the treatment and she obviously needed a minute before dealing with St Mungo’s.”
“And your mother.”  Harry added and then laughed at the horror he can feel coming off his best friend.
“Neville developed a tissue regeneration potion,” Fred explained.
Dolohov charged at Robards, wand extended, curses flying.  One of the best duelists in the wizarding world, it took nearly ten Aurors to fight him to a stand still.  Robards stumbled backwards almost immediately lost to Draco’s view.
Ron shrugged.  “We both agree that the man has gone around the bend, but is it enough for Kingsley to do anything … I don’t know.”
“We’re here to take pictures,” Ron spat back.
“He thinks they’re casting spells on their audience?” Harry asked.  “That’s crazy!  Mass effect enchantments don’t work like that.  Every first year in Hogwarts knows you can't enchant your way into being loved.  There isn’t a single one of us who doesn’t try to figure out how to cast a spell to become the most popular kid in school.  That came up in the first week in charms class and Flitwick lectured us on it for the whole class.  Think about it.  How do you cast a spell so that people you’ve never met want to come see you?  I mean I guess you could cast a spell on the audience when they are there but as soon as they get out of range everyone would be right back to normal.  Trust me, if there was a spell to permanently make everyone love you every politician in the history of politics would have used it.”
“When a band is good, that’s not unusual.”  Potters voice was low but his annoyance was clear in his tone.
He was wearing a golden shirt that flowed, undone down to the navel and tight enough in all the right places to leave little to the imagination.  Draco’s chest was smooth and nicely curved.  He didn’t have Harry’s washboard abs but there was nothing extra on the tuck of his flat tummy.  Forest green velvet pants, tied at the waist with a wide sash that shimmered like silk in the club lights and leather boots completed the look.  He seemed to transcend common concepts like gender.  It was like a godling, one of the heroes of Greek legend, brother to Apollo, friend of Hercules and Perseus, had stepped out of the legends of the ancient past to grace them with his presence.
It makes the hair on the back of his arms rise.
Harry doesn’t much like being a figurehead for justice. More and more, the ambiguous cases had him leaving the Ministry wanting to peel his skin off. The ones who were marked against their will. The ones who weren’t marked but did horrible things. The ones too young to know any better.
“We should hurry,” she says. “It’s late, and he won’t wait up for long.”
It takes a moment. Harry sits in an empty compartment for just long enough to consider pulling out his textbooks before the door clatters open. Then it seems like all of Gryffindor house rushes in to say hello with handshakes and hearty slaps on the back. Some students from the other houses try to come in too, and the commotion has them blocking the corridors until the witch manning the snack-trolley makes irritated sounds at all of them.
– but it is a contrast to how the first time went, with only him on the platform, scared and alone.
“And the rest of the time,” Harry takes in a deep breath, smelling moss and damp. “The rest of the time, does he live in a big manor house with pretentious hedges and peacocks on the lawn.”
‘pparently got hammered. The ones old enough anyway. Most everyone had their own Halloween parties or stuffed themselves sick at the feast. Not many were up for brekky.”
figures of Wizarding society, there was nothing stopping the Dark Lord from holding his parents lives over his head for whatever other equally suicidal task may later come up.
“But I don’t know any good hexes! Or quick ones!”
Too bad Harry had always only had one response to being intimidated. He straightens his spine and cocks his head to meet Zabini’s challenging gaze with his own.
They lead the descent, Draco scanning the floor for Susan. He finds her waiting while Anthony Goldstein plays her cello for the last refrain. As the rest of the dancers follow, the music softens, dropping into silence when Draco and his partner’s feet touch the floor.
Draco sneers. “Potter. I see you left behind the pyjamas today. Though,” he slides his eyes down and up quickly. “I’m not sure if this is an improvement.” He makes sure to inject as much disdain into his voice as possible. It’s a lot. He’d learnt how from his mother.
Everyone: what
The thought of it had transformed Theo’s face and for a moment, it was as if the two of them were sitting across from each other in the Great Hall, eleven years old again. Both of them,
So Draco automatically takes point position as they walk through the diminished crowd, his friends falling into place behind him. Blaise, the strongest caster, watches their flank with feigned casualness, eyes roving around the family groups as if bored. They arrange themselves around little eleven-year-old Antonius Nott, floating his bags along with theirs. He had insisted before they left that he was too big to hold their hands, but had still clutched a handful of Draco’s robes all the way to the platform.
They’re all so small.
Luna pokes what must be a foot (Malfoy’s foot! Harry’s danger alarm is
Theo’s eyes glared defiantly out from under his overgrown fringe, chains rattling lightly around his wrists as he leaned closer. “Don’t let them take that away.”
She hums. “And now you are eighteen summers old. Don’t you think boys your age should stop making a fuss about greens in their meals?”
It starts like this.
“Yes,” Harry chokes out. “Cosy place.”
dragon,” says Harry, speeding up a little.
“We can’t all be going on adventures and saving the world.” He blames the late hour for his candidness. “It’s bad on the knees.”
Too bad Harry has less of an idea about how to deal with
None of the eight-year students were involved in any leadership positions this year, having been specifically advised, or forced, by Professor McGonagall to focus on their studies.
So he does.
The part of him that had been clenched tight since the war ended, held even tighter after waking up to the reminder of what it had cost every morning, unfurls to drip out of his mouth. His chest feels light. Hollow.
Draco groans. She’s been talking to Blaise. Blaise, and possibly his mother. “I was

“What’s it for,” Draco had asked, absently, wand already out.
and he’d made every adult in that room stop in their tracks.
It's not enough. His skin still doesn’t fit him right. He still wakes up in the middle of the night panicking because he can’t hear Ron or Hermione’s breathing in the room. He sits in his armchair in the common room with clenched fists when his friends are away, staring into nothing.
He turns back to Luna who is gripping his hand so tightly it hurts a little, her sodden hair sticking to her pale face. She looks scared. Why?
A glance at Susan tells him that she feels the same.
Draco moves to the north point, takes a breath and lifts his arms.
Eventually, the crowd disperses, shouting promises to catch up later over their shoulders. The trolley-lady presses a few pumpkin pasties into his hand as she passes, thanking him with tears in her eyes. Harry’s glad that she moves on quickly, leaving Harry and a handful of friends in his claimed compartment. He hasn’t gotten any better at handling people thanking him for what happened over the summer.
help Harry with the grounding rituals?”
“Milk, one sugar.”
Malfoy’s mouth purses as he bites back what is sure to have been some choice insults, but he looks away with a hard exhale. “I won’t ask about what’s drawing you closer to the spirit world. I can guess, but it’s really none of my business.” He looks up to catch Harry’s eyes. “This is something you can fix. Do some grounding exercises, use your magic a little less over the next few days, and
have been, if so many Malfoy assets hadn’t been entangled in post-war recovery efforts. Kingsley hadn’t been happy about it. No one was. But they all had agreed that “at least it wasn’t Lucius” and cheered a little at the boost in economy that freed up Malfoy money conferred. Apparently even with Narcissa free, Wizarding Britain had felt the effects when Draco Malfoy’s personal assets were frozen.
open a door so he could get to where the whispers called for him. And then –
I honestly did not expect to fall in love with baby Nott but he's so cute. I didn't even think Theo was gonna be in this.
Luna nods. “I promise it is very short. Could you please convey my apologies to the Dragon? Please tell him that I was held up by an urgent matter and will be bringing a guest along.”
Harry wakes up with the little holey stone clutched tight in one fist and the smell of rain in his nostrils. He doesn’t remember the dream he had been having, but it leaves him tense, jaw aching with how hard he’d gritted his teeth. He releases the breath he’d been subconsciously holding and feels his lungs ache with it as he blinks his crusty eyes open.
There’s no pretending in the water, only darkness. It washes him clean and numbs his hurts where he’d been ignoring them. He feels the air leave his body in little bubbles, tickling his cheeks and forehead on their way up.
of them chivvying him out of the house into the garden with a broom in hand.
“The ones at the Samhain ritual all left by about five? Five-thirty? Most of ‘em stayed around their common rooms if they’re conscious, though Goldstein’s up and about. Bones ‘s still in bed, last I heard.”
“He shouldn’t have,” Seamus growls. “I can’t believe he got out of Azkaban, with what he did.”
He breaks out of his thoughts as Malfoy shakes his head slowly. “He looks every inch the impulsive dim-wit, like always. But I can’t see like you do, Luna.”
And then,
“I suppose you think that’s clever of you, Malfoy.”
“Old Slughorn’s looking for you.” Greg adds.
Sorry it's been ages. I went overseas on holiday and this chapter was hard omg. I changed Julius' name to Julian in the last chapter because I liked it better, so please don't be confused when it comes up in later chapters.
, and you’re in my room, interrupting my sleep.”
She sighs, the sound like wind across a dead battlefield. “Mortals are so fragile.” She clicks her fingers and two wreaths materialise, one looking almost aflame with its orange and yellow leaves, the other heavy with tiny red berries.
Draco tosses his head. “He didn’t tell me anything. I didn’t teach him anything. I still have plausible deniability.”
He’s so busy having his crisis that he doesn’t hear Luna say the password, but the wall in front of them parts along seams he hadn’t noticed, leaving a stone archway.
She nods, a smile popping up as easily as a weed on her face. “It’s good. Go on and take a look.”
” says Neville, sounding choked.
“What look?”
” He’s not proud of the pitch he hits on that last word.
He shakes the thought out of his head. “Look, you said it won’t get worse?” Malfoy confirms his assumption with a nod. “Then it can wait until after we all get some sleep. We can figure out what’s happening and what to do about it then, but right now we’re all tired and it’s not helping.”
(his casting is precise and his reflexes seeker-honed. Aunt Bellatrix had also trained him out off hesitating. Painfully.). It’s more in the confident way he holds himself, the complete assurance that nothing they do would touch him.
” and everyone hisses with narrowed eyes, as Malfoy claps loudly, pointedly, and stands to usher a brown-haired girl with big blue eyes to sit between him and Zabini on the bench.
The woman smiles at them and the expression takes Harry’s breath away. The brushstrokes are careful and gentle here, amateur as they are, lovingly tracing every detail and drawing the eye to the woman’s dimpled cheeks. The varnish of the wooden frame seems to shine a little in the darkened hallway, cradling the woman in a gentle glow like a warm fireplace. Whoever had painted her had loved her smile very much.
“I suppose,” Harry agrees, slowly. “So this one that we’re going to see, is he a friend?”
“I’ll vouch for Harry, don’t worry.”
“Look at him.”
Zabini clears his throat behind them. “Lovegood. Your guest.”
Something in the tone of his voice drags a shiver down Harry’s spine, the way Robinson’s eyes turned steely where they were warm and amiable just a moment ago. He nods anyway. “I will, thanks.”
Harry nods, weakly at first, then more decisively. He wraps his free arm around his middle with a shiver. He’s suddenly so cold.
And that was true too. Malfoy will have to do a lot of scrubbing to clean up his family’s reputation with the public. If someone accuses him of some wrongdoing after he’d been released and manages to make it stick, then stinking rich or not, the Minister and the MLE would have to lock him up or risk not being re-elected in the next season. There was no one left powerful enough that was willing to defend him.
At that point Hermione begun casting glances at the Hogwarts Express as if she had half a mind to jump on it herself. Ron, seeing this, rather quickly intervenes. “’Mione the portkey’s leaving soon. We’d better say bye to Harry quick.”
Until faintly, from somewhere in the narrow distance between the space where they stand and the realm their shadows occupy, they hear the crying of a child.
A knock sounds at the door before Draco could work himself into a proper brood.
The magic in the air is visible now, covering the whole area in wisps trailing a cold chill. Draco sees his breath fog in front of him and hears the music stutter for a moment. He was going to have to replace the strings of his violin. Samhain was always murder on them. But both Blaise and Susan compensate for the change in temperature and tone smoothly, the sound quickly rising and picking up speed.
“Early. I’ve got a project going down at the greenhouses. Needed to harvest the blooms.”
kind of attention, all the time keeping their noses on the ground for any new potentially profitable ventures. The businesses privileged enough to receive their patronage find themselves suddenly enfolded within a highly exclusive – and well-paying – network of merchants, producers, manufacturers, and customers. There, they would find that the social currency granted to them by the Malfoy’s patronage is worth much, much more than the financial success their attention initially garnered.
“Of course,” huffs Draco, mood instantly soured. “That arrogant toe-rag.”
Somehow, Zabini manages to look more intimidating here, petting the back of a sleeping child soothingly, than half the Death Eaters Harry had ever met.
And yet, he feels a shiver run down his spine as Anton brightens with smile. “Thank you, Draco!”
Then they stand. All of them, living and dead. Utterly still.
He can’t help but shiver. Her eyes at this distance are a void. He could feel them pull him in, urging him to take just one more half-step closer. To sleep. To fall.
: guess who's back on their bullshit!!
She laughs again, and she is older, her mirth just barely visible now on the corner of her eyes. “I do too, Dragon. Though you are a wonderful dancer, I would so love to see you meet your destiny.”
As if to confirm his assumption, the hat shouts “
“So,” he says as he throws himself into the seat beside Blaise. “I think we’d better shore up our investment portfolios, don’t you think? Who knows when the next dictator will come marching!”
I thought I knew all of his faces???
He looks up through the water to the moon and braces himself to twist, to
“The Dragon?” she says, voice curious. “My, my, he has everyone in the castle talking about him tonight. A promising young man, don’t you think so? Very talented.”
Luna looks at him with her huge silvery eyes and places her cool hand on his cheek. She wears a look on her face that Harry realises is determination. Somehow, that look settles him. He lets his eyelids close when she brings rests her forehead against his.
“Eyes on me, Dragon.” His partner moves him to face her with a hand on his jaw. “You have only one night with me.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “By all means, take as much time as you need to process this new and interesting experience. It’s not as if it’s –“ he flicks his wand. “-almost five am,
Harry shrugs. “It’s Hogwarts,” he says.
Pansy snorts. “Speaking of being plausibly in denial, the word around is that Potter’s holding court in the rear carriage,” she says from where she’s reclined against the window, legs up on Greg’s lap.
Good. He hates being underestimated.
Luna clears her throat pointedly. “
When they stop, having slid down to the carpet during the tussle, Neville taps him on the knee. “You know I’m here if you need to talk it over, right? I mean, I’m no Hermione or Ron, but I’m here for you.”
“Yeah mate,” says Neville, with a crooked grin. “You totally do. Right, Luna?”
The bed that sits closer to the door is empty, sheets still done up. Probably Zabini’s. The back wall seems to be made entirely of glass, looking out into what seems to be the middle of the great lake.
“Oh, right.”
Luna stops.
, he thinks.
Draco’s mother in some ways, is even better at it than Lucius. Narcissa kept the machinery of the Malfoy businesses working while Lucius greased the cogs. As a result, now sixty-eight percent of the businesses in Knockturn Alley, a good twenty-three percent of the ones in Diagon, and a solid
He raises an eyebrow as he takes her through a lift. “The fates have plans for me, then?”
he doesn’t say.
Harry takes a deep breath. “Grounding exercises, you said?”
speak French. Harry feels as if an entire chapter of his life has been a lie, and also completely confused as to why he would feel that way about Malfoy speaking French. Lots of posh people speak French. It shouldn’t surprise him to hear Malfoy speak a foreign language in general, but for some reason it does.
Draco nods. “It would be best. Another look will allow us to confirm our theories and assess whether the exercises are effective. But I believe we must address something else before we go any further.” He turns towards Potter to look at him with narrowed eyes. “I agreed to these meetings as a favour to a friend. But we, Potter, are not friends.”
“You can’t go, Harry!” She sounds like she’s about to cry. “Hold on to me, please!”
Draco takes a moment to catch his breath, wiping the sweat off his brow. He scans the room for Anton, finding him helping his pink-haired friend to his feet.
Greg thinks for a moment, nodding slowly. “I get what you’re saying, Draco. That stuff is important,” he starts, face so guileless that Draco doesn’t see it coming until it’s too late. “But you and Potter not dicking is pretty big news.”
She grips it tightly for the rest of the train ride.
Harry and his friends had claimed the slightly overstuffed set of armchairs at the back corner of the room from the first night, and for the most part, the other lions don’t bother them when they’re sitting there in an unspoken agreement to give them, Harry especially, some space.
Malfoy lifts his wand arm higher.
Draco scoffs, flicking his hand as if he’s physically batting the topic away. “Whatever. We have more important things to discuss than what Potter’s wearing this afternoon.”
to understand any of it. At this point he just wants to sleep for a few years and wake up when everything starts making sense again. But he’s scared that if he does go to sleep, he’d wake up in the lake again, or in the forbidden forest, or standing over one of his friends with a knife in his hand. He still doesn’t remember how he got into the water.
Harry grunts, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes with one hand while casting a
He clears his throat. “Come in, Luna.”
As soon as that thought registered, Harry shakes his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Luna agrees. “We’ll meet up later today after we get some rest. Draco, send us word when you’re free.”
“And you, Potter?”
“Was that Malfoy,” Seamus says, his voice low with something that makes Harry’s fingers twitch towards his wand.
(also if there's someone who could teach me how to indent on ao3 that would be much appreciated because trying to format this was more painful than my entire honours thesis)
He had asked Pansy for help warding off the entire hallway leading to the cleanest empty classroom he could find for their meeting and then had made sure to get there early to prepare. It’s still about five minutes until the time he’d specified. Luna must still be worried despite their conversation last night.
"Good then" Ron grinned brightly, "let's get back to the party!"
Harry was getting extremely nervous. He knew that they were going to call his and Ginny's names after Lavender was done singing "Since You've Been Gone". His thoughts were all over the place with worry. Then, he felt a slender hand grasp Harry's own hand under the table. Harry hadn't told Draco what he was planning yet. A small part of him was afraid that he would be angry and leave Harry alone again.
Draco watched from his seat across from Luna. He heard Pansy cheering from the seat next to him, but kept his eyes on Harry who had just entered the stage. Music started playing and Ginny was singing in a clear voice.
“And what if I don’t want to sing?” Harry asks, teasingly.
"Finally, it's about time that you told people"
"Luna," Draco asked carefully, "what's this song called?"
“Kary-okee,” Hermione responds, smiling brightly, “is a muggle thing. You get a microphone, a device that amplifies your voice, and you sing a song on a stage. It’s really, very fun. I’ll do a song with you if you want, I’m sure you’d be good at it!” Harry snorted, remembering all the times he’d wanted to blast his eardrums out, listening to Ron sing in the shower. he quickly turned that snort of laughter into a cough, seeing the look that Hermione gave him.
“Well, I was thinking I could sing it with Harry for karaoke night” Ginny said a bit nervously, wanting her girlfriend's approval before going through with her plan.
“Hey Ginny,” Harry says, sitting in his usual spot across from her at the table. He feels a weight settling into the seat to the left of him and turns to smile at the beautiful man sitting down. “Hey Draco. Luna.” Harry says, nodding to Luna, who has plopped down into the seat to Ginny’s left.
“The one you’ve been playing on repeat for weeks? Yes, I think I know the one”
"Our sister was murdered by a group of death eaters, just like you," the second one spat, "and you don't even know her name?!"
“We are” Draco murmured back “but that imbecile weasel still hasn’t figured that out yet. What do you want me to say ‘Oh Potter, love of my life, my heart, my soul, my stars and moon, would you like to go to this muggle karaoke with me? Oh yeah, and your friends can come, too’” Harry snorted at that, his boyfriend could be a sarcastic little shit when he wanted to be.
Draco's POV
Draco's body filled with equal parts dread and excitement. He knew exactly what Harry was planning to do, and was terrified and ecstatic at the same time. He looked up to catch Harry's eye, but he was already looking at him. Harry winked at Draco and then he started to sing.

This is the actual Karaoke Night!
Pansy and Blaise show up at some point and Ginny listens to Hermione explain what karaoke is. Somehow her eyes always wandered back to Luna. She watched Luna’s face for a few seconds, smiling softly, before she turned her head to see what her girlfriend was gazing at. As it turns out, she was watching Harry and Draco. They were whispering to each other softly, both occasionally laughing or smiling at something the other had said.
Ginny blushed. “Did I say that out loud?”
“Hogwarts Karaoke Night! Hogwarts 7th and 8th years are invited to a karaoke night in the Great Hall at 9:00, this Friday night. (Note: the microphone will not be autotuned)” the flyer read. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were standing in the Gryffindor/Slytherin common room, along with all the other 8th year students crowding around the bright orange flyer on the wall.
"So we convinced McG to let us throw this muggle party!" Fred finished. The twins smiled at them and Harry and Draco turned to go inside.
Him and Ginny started to head for the stairs but they didn't even make it halfway down when Draco rushed toward him. He threw his arms around his boyfriend and kissed him hard. Harry kissed him back, not even hesitating. Everyone applauded loudly, with some cheers and wolf whistles mixed in. They pulled away from each other, both smiling widely, and walked down the stairs hand in hand. When they got back to their table where their friends were waiting (which was hard, as everyone kept patting them on the back and saying that they supported them), they all started talking at once.
Draco got very suspicious when Luna said this. All the songs that Ginny liked were about girls, mainly dating girls.
"you know what," Draco said out loud, standing up from his bed, where he had been laying for the past 30 minutes, "Fuck  you, Father. I am entitled to my emotions and I am allowed to show my affection in whatever way I deem fit. I'm going to surprise my boyfriend, whom I love, when he gets back from where ever he is with the weasl- Ginny." Draco stood up and started to make his way to the kitchens. He was going to get the house elves to send some of Harry's favorite food up to their tower so they could eat dinner together in their shared dorm. As Draco was walking past a deserted corridor, though, he felt powerful arms push him into a corner.
This is the same chapter except from Ginny's POV
"yeah"
"We were in the area-"
"I kissed a boy and I liked it, the taste of his cherry chapstick," Harry sang in a clear, rich voice, "I kissed a boy just to try it, I hope my girlfriend don't mind it"
"Come on, Draco" Harry exclaimed, dragging his boyfriend behind him like a mother with their toddler.
"Draco?," Harry asked tentatively, after a couple minutes of laying together comfortably, "how would you feel if we came out?"
Draco nodded seriously.
"Now, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley will sing a duet of a new muggle song! Come on up to the stage, Harry and Ginny!" Lee Jordan, who the twins had persuaded to MC, shouted into his wand.
Luna looked surprised that he didn't know. "This song is 'I Kissed a Girl' by Katy Perry"
“Um, Earth to Harry, hello, can you hear me?” Hermione said, waving her hand in front of Harry’s face.
Friday, October 8th 1999
"I kissed a girl and I liked it," Ginny sang into the microphone.
“Ginny and I were talking about karaoke. She was saying how she has a song in mind for you two, but won’t tell us which one, says it’s a surprise”
The color drained from Ron's face. He looked back and forth between the two of them and Harry held up their connected hands as Draco raised an eyebrow, daring him to object.

(See the end of the chapter for
“What is karaoke, anyway?” Blaise asks. While Hermione started to explain Karaoke to Pansy and Blaise, Harry leaned over to whisper in Draco’s ear.
“What’s Kara-oke?” Ron asks, looking at Hermione in confusion.
“Hey Ginny,” Harry says, taking the seat across from her. “Hey Draco. Luna.” He adds, nodding at Luna, who had taken the seat next to Ginny’s left. Ginny made small talk with Hermione, Luna ate their waffle, and Ron sat, staring at Hermione with an expression of such love that it was almost pathetic. “Romione” as Harry had taken to calling them, had gotten together shortly after the war had ended, and Ginny was thrilled for them. She had never seen her brother so happy in a relationship before.
Draco has been thinking about his past (uh oh) and tries to surprise Harry when he returns from wherever he's been with Ginny. (trigger warning: mentioned abuse, and a bit of violence, maybe a little angst, too)
