By this time Harry was grinning himself. “Fine, I guess it was a little – listen, if you’re not going to eat that…”
“I’m going to give you this in a minute,” Draco said, holding the slipper up. “Then you’re to leave the Manor and go think about this job opportunity. Same tasks as before. Four days on, two days off. Ten sickles a day. Come back tonight if you’re interested.”
Their eyes locked through the sheets of rain. Potter was breathing heavily, eyes blazing, looking like he had just defeated the Dark Lord all over again.
“Harry, mate, we want you to go to the wedding,” said Ron, loyal to the end. “Don’t you think Ginny would be crushed if you weren’t there?”
Everyone knew where Harry Potter lived; half the time there was press camped out across the street, and unfortunately today was no different.
“I said don’t I deserve anything else?” Potter said, not looking like he was really asking. Draco watched him a moment more and Potter’s eyes fell. “Don’t I deserve something I want?”
“This,” he said after a moment. “This isn’t like that. No one’s been…” He clenched his teeth. “Jumping me or anything. Do you really think I’d even go if I thought–”
Harry knew Ron and Pansy’s property eventually hit a woods and shallow creek if you walked far enough. They could take the hedged path so no one would see them go. Ron and Pansy were drunkenly dancing their hearts out on the dance floor even though speeches were only just finished and the sun had barely set. Harry could see what would happen now: they’d spar, heal each other, maybe kiss in the gathering dusk until Harry couldn’t breathe for how impossibly relieved he was that Malfoy was here and in his arms. They’d miss dancing and dessert, but Harry wouldn’t miss a thing.
“I said I’d do training for a few months in Stockholm,” Malfoy returned tonelessly. “You’ll be given a temporary partner here to continue with our open cases. But obviously,” said Malfoy, some nastiness working its way into his voice the way it always did when he thought he was being rejected, “I can obviously only accept Shacklebolt’s offer for myself. You of course can go up to his office, refuse his deal, and request to work with anyone but me.”
A week of agonizing later, and Harry had turned up on the steps of Malfoy Manor. Lucius Malfoy looked terrified, and Draco’s eyes went so wide they looked like they were going to fall out of his head.
Never taking his eyes off Harry, Malfoy smiled. “You know, I think I can be persuaded to finish up my getting kidnapped paperwork at home,” he said, and pressed a light kiss on Harry’s lower lip.
The crack of the house elf brought both of them back to their senses as he began to stack plates on the table. The house elf never spoke, Harry noticed. Draco watched Harry grow more and more sullen.
Harry sighed. “I think I might get a point for distracting the kidnapper with gay feelings,” he said.
“But I lose a point for stunning you,” Harry conceded. “And I think you lose a point for having a plan that ended up with you in a
“It’s not too late to resign, you know,” Malfoy said back, equally softly as though the conversation wouldn’t be happening if they spoke quietly enough. “I just thought – well, we like our jobs. It would be better this way. And it’s not for that long, just–”
Draco breathed a laugh. “God, Harry,” he said, “maybe that’s what I was trying to tell you last time.”
Well, Harry wasn’t delicate, and he certainly wasn’t about to hear whatever hideous news Malfoy clearly had being treated like a delicate flower.
Draco could only freeze as Potter pressed the softest kiss to his lips. His eyes closed, but he could
Harry ignored the faint sounds of explosions coming from George Weasley’s room, and padded into the kitchen to make tea. Ron was playing some kind of card game with Neville and Seamus at the long oak table. He saw the look on Harry’s face and threw down his cards.
For a moment he couldn’t read the expression on Harry’s face, then the boy started to speak. “Wait you want me to use my hero status to mess with Slughorne so that he will let you use the potion classroom? Don’t you already know N.E.W.T.s level potions?”
For the remaining time of the dinner, Harry couldn’t keep his eyes away from Draco. His eyes followed the blond everywhere and every time he was able to find him alone he couldn’t keep his hands to himself. Of course, Harry knew that they still needed to talk about their new developing relationship, but right now talking was the last thing he wanted to do.
“I heard that you and miss Granger are looking into occlumency, may I ask why?” Draco looked surprised, he wondered how much he should tell her.
“Draco, I know it’s hard to believe, but what your parents told you is wrong. The Dursley always told me that this was wrong, but now I know that they were the one to be wrong. So Draco please don’t let your parents still control you.”
He was glad that Hermione and Ron agreed to accompany them, he knew that for them it was less about helping Draco and more about spending time together and introducing Ron to muggle society, but he was happy that he will have someone with him that will not be afraid to smack him when he will be staring at Draco for too long.
“The drawer, next to my bed.” Quickly Harry made his way to the drawer and took out the tube and Draco probably acquired during one of their trips.
Draco looked at him for a long time and Harry feared that he is going to leave but when he finally stoke he couldn’t stop smiling. “I would like some ice cream”
“Thank god. I don’t know what was that but I’m almost a hundred per cent sure that this was not a regular nightmare. I've been trying to wake you up for five minutes. Are you okay?”
“Why aren’t you sleeping.” Before he could stop himself the words came out of his mouth. Shit. He could feel panic making its way to the front of his mind. Why did he say this? He was so stupid, he has to fix this before he starts having a full-blown panic attack. “I’m sorry, you don’t have to answer that, it was stupid of me to ask. I think I need to go.”
“I have always wanted to have a big family, but it never really crossed my mind, I mean I would love to have children and Teddy always wanted to have a sibling, but I never thought that it was a possibility.” Draco gently kissed the raven-haired man hoping that it would smooth his worries.
His thoughts were so loud that he didn’t hear when the door opened. He was brought back from his chaotic thought when someone put a hand on his arm. He looked up and locked his eyes with a middle-aged man.
“Well, I feel exposed and besides I eat the normal amount of food thank you. I just like snacks.” He looked at Ron who was looking through the menu. “Ron agrees with me we should order something, also Andromeda would kill me if I didn’t take care of you.” The last comment was directed at Draco, who now looked at Harry with pure annoyance on his hand.
He couldn’t stop the smile that appeared on his face when he handed Draco the ice cream and his eyes lit up. He hoped that the small treat helped him a little bit. They came back to Hogwarts still talking about the gallery. Harry thought that Draco’s mood would be better in the castle, but when they entered the common room the blond immediately went to their room.
“Oh, Draco you don’t have to repay Andy. She did it because she loves you. You no longer have to feel like a burden Draco, trust me.” Without hesitation, he gathered the blond in his arms and hugged him tightly. “Come on I thought we have books to check out.” The blond hugged him back and quickly escaped from his embrace to open the door.
Nothing in his wardrobe was good enough. Harry slowly left his room in Grimmauld Place and made his way to Ron and Hermione’s room. He wasn’t sure if his friends were still there so after a moment of consideration he decided to knock.
“The dinner is ready boys, it’s time to eat.” She smiled at them and added. “You can continue later.”
To his surprise a voice next to him answer his question, he looked at Harry, their eyes locked. “It makes sense, you’ve never wanted to be a Death Eater. You did what you did only because you wanted to protect people that didn’t deserve it. So you were under so much stress that your mind conjured this shadow that consists of the things you are scared of and the things that you want to hide.” Draco just looked at him mouth agape.
“Well, it worked, besides even if you knew what you are missing you’d never get it back.” Harry was delighted to find that Draco was still smiling.
Once again, thanks for all the positive comments and kudos, I'm really happy that you like this fic and hope that you will also like the one, I'm writing right now!! <3
“Oh, Harry we don’t want to miss it!” Harry let Draco drag him away back to the ongoing party. The blond was smiling, and Harry couldn’t stop his own smile from appearing.
She didn’t know what to think, in a way she wanted to hate him for all the things he did, but he did apologise. She asked for a reason and he gave her one, she hated that she felt bad for the boy. In a way she also hated that she understood why he behaves like this, she understood why his brain made a connection between the pain inflicted on him and her.
“Earth to Draco.” He looked up and lock his eyes with Harry. “Do you want me to choose something for you?” He wanted to be offended because honestly, it’s just an ice cream flavour, but truth be told he had no clue what he wanted, slowly he nodded.

“Em... Hi, I don’t know if you can understand me and I know that usually I ran away and you chase me but I just wanted to ask how do I get rid of you?” He knew that it was stupid and he was rude, but honestly, this thing was hunting his dreams and he wanted to wake up rested not drenched in his sweat. The shadow stayed silent, but it wasn’t moving towards or away from him so he decided that it will not kill him. Keeping what he hoped was eye contact with the shadow he asked another question. “Can you understand me?” To his surprise, it nodded.
“We don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want, but it could help.” Harry’s voice was soft and Draco smiled involuntarily. Even though the proposition sounded good, he couldn’t find his voice yet, instead, he placed his head onto Harry’s chest and shook his hand. “Okay, I will wait.”
This question made him stop in his tracks. He stared at Harry as if he couldn’t understand what the other boy was saying. He couldn’t form words. Neither of them dared to break the silence that fell upon them, but Draco knew that he needed to be the one to say something.
He woke up and for the first time since the shadow appeared he wasn’t terrified. Trying to move he discovered that Harry was wrapped around him. The previous day came back to him. The gallery, the talk with Harry and falling asleep in his arms. He could feel the blush appearing on his face. Carefully he detached himself from Harry’s arms and took his sketchbook. He didn’t use it since the war started, but now he could, he was allowed to do what he wanted. Producing a charcoal piece, he started to sketch the sleeping form of the Boy Who Lived. He knew that it won’t be his best work, he was pretty rusty but he wanted to practice again, to feel the paper under his hands.
“This is what you wanted, you told me to help you buy new clothes and I did. It’s not my fault that you cannot dress. I tried to be gentle.” He could hear a tint of laughter that he couldn’t suppress in his voice.
Draco looked back down at his little cousin and noticed that the excitement started to die down a little. “Well the sooner the better, the little guy isn’t going to last much longer.” Just as he said it the duo appeared next to Harry.
This chapter describes Draco's childhood, so there is a mention of torture and child abuse. Stay safe and please if you cannot read this but want to know what happened, just comment and I will try to summarise it in a way that won't be triggering.
He could feel himself drifting off in Harry’s arm, he was afraid of what he will see in his dreams, but he was so warm and comfortable and Harry was rubbing his back. He couldn’t really fight anymore falling asleep was very easy when one feels safe.
His mother wasn’t as involved in the Dark Lord’s cult as his father was. Narcissa only followed her husband. She only wanted her son to be safe. Draco knew that the act of concerned mother she was presenting was just that an act, but what could he do. He knew that he would only suffer if he opened his mouth.
For a moment Harry loosed his hold on him then moved and kissed the top on Draco’s head. “Good morning.” The smile that Harry gave him made his heart melt. Draco wanted to wake up like that every day with Harry’s arms around him, safe.
“About the dorm arrangements. Honestly Draco what are you thinking so intensely about?” Granger sounded as if she knew exactly what was Draco thinking about. He shifted a little under her stare.
Draco looked at Harper, then at Sam, who looked about ready to cry. “Well, it didn’t work the last 20 times so no, but be more careful.” He noticed a smiled on Harper’s face.
The Golden Trio was supposed to return in about half-hour leaving Draco plenty of time to decorate the room with flowers and place Harry’s present next to the basket. In the beginning, he didn’t want to engage Ron and Hermione’s help especially on Valentines, he knew that the two of them most likely had plans, but when Hermione asked him if he was planning something she not only gave him the green light but also volunteered to keep Harry busy in the morning, after that the duo had a reservation in one of the muggle restaurants that they visited a few months back.
Finally, at his words the Slytherin looked up, his expression was unreadable. He watched as Draco slowly sit up and continued. “In the second year I told Narcissa that I thought Blaise was handsome, she told me to never say that again, then she told Lucius and that was one of the worst nights at the manor. I was to be a perfect heir and I was to marry a pure blood woman and have pure blood children, but I couldn’t do it if I liked boys, so my father decided that he can beat it out of me.” Once again the blond paused, but this time he looked at Harry. “At the gallery when I saw these paintings. I don’t know what to believe Harry.”
After checking the map, they slowly made their way to McGonagall’s room. He watched as Draco approached the door and held out his hand to knock. He waited and when nothing happened he looked at Draco with raised eyebrow with he hoped was interpreted by Draco as an indication to knock on the door. To his surprise, Draco turned towards him still holding his hand up.
Draco sat rotten in his spot still holding Harry’s hand, he forgot about the dorm arrangement. He will have to room with someone who probably hates him and will make him feel as if he was still with his parents. He looked up and locked his eyes with Headmistress McGonagall and he could swear that she smiled at him, quickly Draco averted his eyes and looked at the table.
Still wrapped around Draco, Harry slowly lifted his head. “What did McGonagall wanted?” Draco was silent and Harry thought that he won’t get an answer to his question.
Draco couldn’t properly control his limbs, panic making his leg sway and his hands tremble. Before he could leave the room, he felt someone hands on his shoulders.
The painting presented a man with a short brow beard kissing another man, both of them looked extremely happy. They were wrapped in a rainbow flag and Draco could feel himself reaching out to touch the painting, but before he could do it a hand stopped him. He looked to his left and saw Harry, he wasn’t surprised per se but for a moment he forgot that the Boy Who Lived was next to him, for a moment the only thing that mattered was the panting. Harry looked and Draco could read his face very clearly. Harry was asking a silent question ‘Do you wanna talk about it’. He smiled at the boy next to him and squeezed his hand. “Later.” He answered quietly.
Slowly Draco lifted his shivering hands and quickly pulled the zipper of Harry's pants down. The Gryffindor sat on his knees, making his erection visible. Draco lifted his hips and with one movement Harry pulled his pants down leaving him only in his underwear. Quickly Draco reached for Harry pants, the Gryffindor let him pull them down to his knees. When both of them were only in their underwear, Harry took Draco’s hands in his and pinned them on both sides of his hips.
He looked for Harry and found that the Gryffindor was already surrounded by at least two dozens of people. He heard as someone shouted at him. Immediately he wanted to go back. He could feel his breathing picking up. Suddenly a shape appeared in front of him, instinctively he moved back, but a hand stopped him. He recognized the black curls in front of him.
Draco sat in his place mouth open, staring at Harry. “Excuse me what?” the clear disbelieve could be heard in his voice, but right now he didn’t care about masking his emotions.
He looked at Draco, who was sitting next to him with an expression of pure wonder. Harry was aware that Draco wasn’t expecting forgiveness, that’s why he was so nervous. The Slytherin kept opening and closing his mouth as is he was trying to say something but was afraid that his voice will destroy the moment.
“Maybe you can take some to your room for later. I really don’t want you to go to bed hungry” At this Draco looked at him, his expression was unreadable but after a few seconds the boy nodded and Harry smiled.
Harry smiled and run towards what Draco assumed was the entry. Draco knew that he wouldn’t catch up to him, but nevertheless, he jogged towards Harry and together they entered. It was loud and crowded but also colourful and full of life and he hated and love it at the same time.
Harry waited patiently for Draco to start the explanation wondering whether he will have to step in. To his surprise, the blond didn’t hesitate this time. “Could we come in?”
Harry wondered how Andromeda deals with the fact that Draco gets stuck in his mind more and more. Harry hated that it was becoming harder and harder to bring him back, especially when he was anxious.
She wanted to say something, but before she could Draco begun to speak. “You don’t have to forgive me. I don’t count on forgiveness. I just want to stay friends with Harry and I know that in order to do it you have to at least not actively try to kill me. That is enough for me.” She realised that his voice sounded hollow as if he already decided that this was a lost battle.
Draco didn't know where Hermione and Ron disappeared to but he also really didn’t care. Harry was still by his side and they were still holding hands which was a good sign. Slowly they made their way around the gallery, stopping at every painting.
A smile started to spread on Draco’s and Harry could feel his cheeks heat up. “If I knew that you appreciate my fashion sense so much I would have taken you shopping a long time ago. But honesty I would love to change your whole wardrobe and make you more presentable.”
Their room was the last on the left, there was no keyhole and for a moment Harry was lost. He began to wonder if there was some sort of password that he forgot when Draco tap him on the shoulder. “The door handle has your magical signature inside, all you have to do is touch it.” The blonde didn’t sound condescending and Harry was grateful for it.
“I can’t believe that you dragged me to 20 shops and proceeded to tell me that I have no style in every single one of them.” Draco couldn’t suppress the smile that appeared on his face.
“Yes, I want you to fuck me.” He watched as the Gryffindor turned to the nightstand with lightning speed and took out the lube.
He furrowed his eyebrows, why would Potter, or perhaps it was time to start referring to him as Harry, ask about his plans? “Yes, I’m free, but why do you want to know?”
Trans people are valid, non-binary people are valid, asexual people exist and are valid, questioning people are also valid!
Today was like every other afternoon after class, they were sitting under their tree when suddenly Hermione approached them and started to speak without even saying hello.
“Oh, cheer up Harry, at least you won’t be their Head of House.” Thinking about the teacher, who will have to deal with the children made him smile.
Harry looked at the blond that was laying on his lap and smiled. I was an extremely hot March day and they decided to study under their tree. Harry knew that he would miss this spot when they leave, he would miss a lot of things. Sharing a room with Draco was one of them, he liked waking up next to the blond, it made his day better, he also liked when the blond criticised his outfits and when he fell asleep in his arm and moved his head to the side so that he was pressed closer to Harry. The mere thought of this made him smile.
“I don’t need another person to pamper me about food. I don’t know why everyone thinks that I have a problem with eating.” Draco sounded exasperated, Harry just thought that he looked cute.
“Come then, Teddy is waiting” He knew that using his cousin was stupid, but he really needed to get away from the dirty alley in which he felt more emotions than during his whole stay at the Manor, obviously not counting the nightmare which was the war.
During the first weeks of their meetings, there was a lot of problems, mostly with people who arrived and left after five minutes stating that they refuse to be tough by a Death Eater. Harry almost laugh at one of them because Snape was also a Death Eater but everyone seemed to forget this fact. After only the people that wanted to learn something stayed in the classroom there was still a surpassingly big number of students that wanted to learn. That day when he looked at Draco he expected t see a grimace on his face, instead what greeted him was a smile and Harry was happy to note that it was real. Potions were Draco domain, the boy was amazing at it, giving tips and making sure that everyone heard and understood him.
“Harry, mate, thanks, Merlin. I the four of them are pure chaos. I can’t imagine how bad they will be when they get to Hogwarts.” Harry just shook his head and smiled at his exhausted friend.
The gallery was small. Draco didn’t know that muggles had such small galleries. When they went inside Hermione produced tickets and gave them to a short Asian woman that checked them. After a moment she smiled at the four of them and let them pass giving them all pamphlets and whishing them to have a good show. Draco smiled politely and thanked her.
“I thought about using Black, aunt Andromeda is a Black and she said that it was okay.” He felt a slight blush appearing on his face. He never actually had someone who was proud of him, aunt Andromeda told him that if he wants he can use Black or Tonks, although he was tempted to use the latter he still didn’t want to cut all ties with his family.
“You’re not a Death Eater Draco.” He knew that he will do anything in order for Draco to forgive himself, even if that means that he will have to tell him every day that he is not a Death Eater.
Draco could just look and nod his head as Harry spoke. He knew that the boy in front of him is caring, but he never could have guessed that he would be so understanding. Draco was a Death Eater, a scam and here was the saviour of the wizarding world telling him that he will wait for him to be comfortable.
“I’m almost done with the summer reading, I still have to catch up on the work that I couldn’t do in 6th year, Father” He could see the frown forming on Lucius' face.
“Will you help me, Harry?” He wasn’t expecting this question, but he knew that if he was going to do it he will need Harry as his anchor.
“As ready as I can be.” He knew that this wasn’t the answer Harry wanted, but at this point, this was the only one Draco could give him.
Draco smiled as Pandora showed him yet another experimental potion that presumably was supposed to make the object covered in it invisible at will for up to a week. The last five of her attempts ended disastrously, and he was glad that he managed to convince his daughter to test the potion on something other than herself or her sibling. He watched as a few drops of the liquid landed on a rock that they found in the garden, for a moment nothing happened then the rock started to smoke, and a sickening smell appeared in the air. A moment later, the stone was on fire, Draco quickly cast Aguamenti and dragged Pandora away from the failed experiment.
“I – Yes, I would love to shopping with you.” He could see a smile forming on Harry’s face, the felt proud that it was because of him.
He thought that nothing could be worse than becoming a Death Eater, but of course, he was mistaken once again. He was given a  task from Voldemort, he was supposed to bring Death Eaters to school and kill Dumbledore. He knew that he couldn’t do it, but he tried to fulfil the impossible task and survive.
here is the last chapter of this fic!! I'm very excited to post it and I cannot wait to hear what y'all think about it. Honestly, when I started to write this fic I never would have guessed that it will become so long, but I wouldn't change a think about it.
“Nothing, my clothes are still in my wardrobe. I just need something better.” He moved towards the closet and started to look for something that would look good. “I’m going shopping and I need some proper clothes”
. For a moment Harry felt as if he blacked out. The only thing he saw was Draco dressed in all black with pants that hugged all the right places.
“Oh. I, Thank you. Nobody ever told me this. My mother sometimes told me that I shouldn’t laugh out loud because it’s unbecoming, but I always thought that laughing should never be suppressed.” Harry was smiling at him again and Draco’s heart was slowly melting.
She turned to Draco and put her hand on his arm. The boy looked up and she saw the emotions in his eyes, the fear and panic were so strong that she wondered if it was only his emotion. And then it clicked. She knew what was wrong, why this place felt so unlike the boy next to her. She could feel as she regained control over the situation, she nodded at the boy and ended the spell.
Looking at the blond Harry noticed that he was playing with his sleeve. “I mean, I’ve never had alcohol before, so we could do this while camping.”
Please wear a mask, don't be like the orange man!!! Also, don't be an asshole and be nice to shopping assistants.
Teddy was happily giggling on his lap, Andromeda was chatting to him about everything and nothing at the same time and Draco realized that this was what he was missing all his life. He wanted to stay, even being back at Hogwarts wasn’t as appealing as finally feeling at home.
Harry detangled himself from Draco, took his hand and led him to the kitchen. He sat Draco on the bench next to the stove and started to heat their meal. The blond watched him the whole time. Harry knew what Draco is going to say before the blond even said it, they talk about it a lot recently.
“I… You… Luna…” He shut his mouth and looked at Ginny. After close inspection, he noticed that she started to fidget with her sleeves while looking extremely uncomfortable. “Well, welcome to the club, Ginny.”
He eyed the ice cream subspecialty. “I don’t even know how this kinder something tastes how am I to compare the flavours?” Draco was confused if this tasted like something else shouldn’t he know the flavour of the original candy?
“Harry, do you have a moment?” Harry really didn’t want to talk with Ginny right now. He knew that they agreed to try again after the war, but after their talk back in August when she showed up in Grimmauld, he really didn’t feel like talking about their relationship or lack of it again.
They studied for the past hour and right now on their break Draco decided to sketch their tree. He watched the precise movements of Draco’s hand and couldn’t stop himself. He leaned down and pressed his lips to Draco’s, the blond kiss him back and when he pulled back he found the blond smiling.
After Andromeda left, everyone started to leave one by one and a half an hour later the two of them were left alone.
Harry didn’t know what to expect when Malfoy came down the stairs. He hoped that for the sake of his godson Malfoy could be civil.
Even though he expected Potter to come like he did every day, he was still startled out of his train of thought, when Potter’s hand came in his field of vision. Draco looked up and noticed that the boy had bags under his eyes, they weren’t as prominent as his, but this was worrisome nonetheless.
“And what about accommodation?” Harry watched the blond carefully, his expression was guarded and Harry knew that right now he needed to reassure Draco.
“It went good Hagrid. But we are not here to discuss the exams. You see little birdie told us that you are going to visit Madam Maxine this summer.”  Hagrid blushed at the mention of Madam Maxine, and Harry smiled at his friend. “Draco decided that you are in need of wardrobe change if you two are going to spend the holiday in Paris.” Harry started to full-on laugh when he saw the blush hut adored Hagrid’s face.
When they stopped in front of the next painting he couldn’t breathe. It showed a couple, some would argue that it was nothing special, but for him, this painting was something he was never allowed. He can’t do anything but stare, McGonagall’s words burning in his mind “your parents told you that something that is a part of you or maybe something that you really wanted to try one day is wrong”. His parents told him that this was wrong, that he was filthy and if he was to become a hair he had to get rid of his weird fascinations. But now looking at this painting he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were wrong. When he looked to the right he noticed that the whole wall was dedicated to paintings with the same theme.
“I’m sure the boy knows what he is doing. After all, he is the only free Malfoy” his father spat the words. Draco saw as his hand closed on his cane. “So, how are you preparing for school, son?”
Suddenly Harry remembered where they were, looking around the library he noticed that people were either staring at them or purposefully looking away. Harry noticed that his Slytherin was almost as red as Ron, but a bright smile was still present on his face.
With one move he hugged Andromeda, he felt as she wrapped her arms around him. “Thank you. This is the most one ever did for me. I can never repay you.”
To his surprise, the Slytherin looked at him and smirked. “How will you know that you packed everything when you won’t have time to check? Didn’t think about that.” The smirk morphed into a playful smile and Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from Draco.
“I, they, it’s complicated. I kind of walked out of the manor and told them I quit, so my parents disowned me.” He looked straight at the door avoiding the man’s eyes.
For a moment everyone was silent, he tried not to look at Harry, but the raven-haired boy sought his eyes out and finally Draco obliged. As soon as it happened Harry started to shout. “Draco Black!” He almost flinched at the noise, but after noticing that Harry’s face didn’t hold any real hate, he slightly relaxed. When the boy was right in front of Draco he spoke again. “You win.”
“You have nothing to apologize for. It was my fault I’m sorry, I didn’t want to –“ Draco was interrupted before he could finish.
The headmistress briefly looked at their joined hands and smiled a little, but soon her expression returned to normal. “That’s very peculiar indeed. The fact that all your life you had the same dream is very weird, but considering that your family is known for being good at occlumency it may be connected with this, maybe some kind of safe space for your thoughts.  I imagine that you were under a lot of stress at the time, or you had to make a lot of difficult decisions which can be connected with the change, but I would have to look into your mind to understand it better.”
Without warming the spell that Draco’s carefree exterior out on him broke and Harry could only hear shouting. “How dare you laugh, you Death Eater scam. How can you parade here when the victims of your crimes will never again. You should be ashamed, you should be dead.” He couldn’t identify the voice, but the words that were spoked made his insides twist.
I'm really sorry if you are a trans person and a fan of Harry Potter, but remember that she only gave us the story and although she is the creator and she made a lot of mistakes, you as a fan can fix them. Stay strong and stay yourself because you are amazing, beautiful and so strong.
He can still feel the heat on his cheeks, Harry calling him darling was a completely new thing and Draco knew that he has to get his emotions under control before he does something embarrassing that he cannot ever undo.
But being prepared did not, in fact, made Harry calmer, most of the times between the exams he felt like throwing up. Even though Draco was as stressed as Harry, he helped a lot with the stress, mostly thanks to the breathing exercises and simply being with Harry. He knew that at one point Draco even helped Hermione, who started to overwork herself again.
Then they took him to Diagon Alley and everything changed. His parents made sure that he grew up pretty secluded, the only other people he saw at the Manor were his parents business partners. His father made a deal with Crabe and Goyle parents and so they were made to stick together. He never saw so many people and so many families. He saw children laughing and running around. This was the first time he realized his parents aren’t that great, but he still believed that they do it all for him.
At this comment Draco laugh and Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from the blond, his eyes focus on the way Draco closes his eyes when he laughs and the little shake of his head. “Yeah during the exam sessions.”
Harry took their dinner from the heat and gave Draco his plate. They ate in silence for a moment then Draco looked up at him and smile.
Draco didn’t know how, but she picked up an outfit that Draco knew for a fact Harry will like. Black skinny jeans and Harry’s ruby sweatshirt, Draco noticed that every time he wore Harry’s clothes the raven-haired boy couldn’t stop looking at him. This time he wasn’t sure if the clothes will attract Harry, but he needed every advantage he could find to get the boy alone.
Both Ron and Hermione paused their argument and stopped in front of his bed, gaping at the two of them. “I’ve never thought that I will see him so peaceful.”
In many cases what pushed people into a breakdown is usually a small seemingly unimportant thing, unfortunately for Draco, it was the same. After coming back to his room, he spieled his quill onto his potion textbook and that was enough for him to break. All his frustration, insecurities and doubt came crashing and he couldn’t stop the tears. The only good thing about this situation was the fact that Harry was not in their room, he couldn’t imagine what would he do if Harry witnesses him crying once again.
They were standing side by side for what was beginning to feel like a lifetime, nothing was happening and the empty forest was slowly becoming hunting. Minerva couldn’t comprehend why this felt so wrong, so unnerving. She couldn’t connect this image with the boy next to her.
Never had Draco been this nervous. Right now he felt as if he was going to collapse any second. Andromeda went with him to the ministry, she sat next to him until an Auror informed her that she needs to leave because he is going to be escorted to the place where his evaluation is going to take place.
“Oh, god. I’m sorry, but look they wrote about our potion and how the first dosages of it are being given to the patients. I’m so happy I could kiss you Draco.” Draco smiled and wanted to answer the boy when he felt a protective arm around his waist.
Harry watched as the students slowly left the Great Hall, he didn’t know what this year had in store for them all but he couldn’t wait to find out.
For a moment both of them were silent. Harry could see as Draco slowly thought about his proposition. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice was calm although harry could hear the emotions behind it. “I would like that.”  Draco sounded unsure and hopeful at the same time and Harry thought that this was a start.
“Draco people stopped harassing you because you help most of them with potions. The fact that you didn’t notice that is just funny.” Oh, this was something that he didn’t expect, but he couldn’t complain.
He didn’t expect them to thank him, he didn’t even want them to do it, all he asked for was to be treated a little better. Like a human, not a punching bag. Obviously, this would never happen and he had enough.
Andromeda just laughed at him got up and left Harry alone at the table. Slowly he got up and tried to make his way towards Draco when out of nowhere Ginny appeared in front of him.
To Harry’s disappointment, the shopkeepers did not let go of their prejudice even though Draco was cleared from all his crimes some of the people still treated him as if he was the worse scum of the earth. Harry hated the fact that when he looked at Draco the smile he had while he was with Andromeda and Teddy was gone.
“Draco can you please open, you are scaring me. You know I don’t want to hurt you. Open the door please.” She needed him to do it, she knew that in this state if he saw a wand there was no way of knowing what will happen.
“Did you just tricked me into packing?” He couldn’t believe how quickly he allowed Draco to fool him.
“Take your time. I’m not going to scream at you because you befriended Malfoy, honestly Harry. I’m guessing that he is staying with Andy and this is why you were visiting her every day?” Ron didn’t sound angry and Harry realised a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“Why are you nice to me? I made your life a living hell and now you are here with me. Why do you care?” The look on Draco face was hunting, his eyes were red and his pale face was almost translucent.
It took Draco 10 minutes to finish his ice cream and clean himself. Harry led him towards a big building from which a lot of people was coming out. Draco couldn’t suppress the urge to ask questions.
He stopped in front of a house with a bright yellow door. Slowly he gathered the courage and knocked.
“I think that everything depends on the number of 8th years that return, but I’m also pretty sure that McGonagall won’t make us share a dorm with other years.”
“I…, Yes I’m perfectly fine thank you. So are you ready? His voice was quivering and he could feel a blush creeping its way onto his cheeks.
Draco could feel as the blood drained from his face, he knew that if Harry wasn’t holding him in place he would flee and probably never come back. All the images of Lucius and Narcissa screaming at him, telling him that he was unnatural and that he was allowed to stay with them only because he was their only heir assaulted him. He could feel as his breathing picked up and he shot up. This was bad, he didn’t want to relive these moments.
“How am I strong? I ran away from my parents, I couldn’t make them see that this wasn’t right. I messed up.” Harry knew that the Slytherin was working himself into another panic attack and he had to stop him before Draco exhausted himself.
Draco watches as the raven-haired boy looked towards the ice cream stand, he couldn’t help but think about their first shopping trip together and the ice cream that Harry bought them.
so this time I just wanna say that it's bad. The election in Poland is most likely to end badly for people that care about human rights. It's pretty depressing and I'm sorry for everyone that lives in this country. No matter what happens know that I' with you and you are not invisible. I think I will write something when they announce the official results of the election, but it doesn't look good. I don't know how much Polish readers I have, but if you are from Poland I.m sorry and ***** ***!
Because I've missed two dates I'm doing a double update. I also once again highly recommend a fic tittle survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller, here the link https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826 The story is amazing, the writing is beautiful and I think everyone should read it!
“Maybe, but just to be sure I’m going to check on him.” At first, he was gonna give the boy some time alone, but he knew that if Draco was to actually face the problem he has to talk about it, not bottle it up inside. “Don’t wait up!” He screamed at his friends and quickly made his way to the room.
After a moment Draco looked at the duo with a blank mask firmly in place. “Goodbye gentleman I will be seeing you in the future.” With that, his boyfriend turned around and walk towards him and his friends.
“Yeah, we talked about this. Honestly, Harry communication is everything. Now come on you shouldn’t make your second half wait so long for you.”
Upon entering the kitchen, he behaved as every sane person would, he loudly shouting. “HARRY JAMES POTTER!” Looking around he noticed that Harry was in fact not alone in the kitchen, Hermione, Ron, George and Charlie Weasley stood next to him probably talking, but after his shout, all five of them stood silently staring at him. “Um, hi. Can you please leave Harry and I for a moment?” The four additional people look from him to Harry then stood up patted Harry on the shoulder and left then alone.
“Great, so ice cream or do you wanna go back?” He wanted Draco to stay even just a minute longer. “Ice cream always makes me feel better.”
“Harry what the fuck, you are not a child anymore, you don’t have to sneak out.” He watched as the raven-haired man blushed once again.
Teddy turned to Harper and ruffled his hair just as Draco did to him a moment ago. “I’m going to miss you.” Harry watched as Harper hugged the older boy.
“Yes, but it’s usually in special craft stores. I’m sure we will find them. After that, we can get ice cream and I also have a small request.”
The blond laughed a little then turned to him with a serious expression. “I could never have enough of you. It’s just that everything is changing. Teddy just graduated. Harper is on her way of becoming a professional Quidditch player, Pandora is wonderful at potions, and I’m sure that with proper training she will be even better than I am, Sam is going to start Hogwarts after the summer. It feels like I’m going to be left all alone.” Harry turned the blond all the way so that they were facing each other.
Draco didn’t know what to do so he stood awkwardly next to the door waiting for any indication that would tell him the next step he should take. He heard as the man shut the door and moved to stand next to the desk. After what felt like forever he looked at the man and found that he was looking back. Draco couldn’t read his expression, which made him worry more.
They been to at least three stationary shops and not wanted to serve Draco. At this point, Harry considered taking him to regular muggle stationery shop, but he wasn’t sure if that was allowed.
She remembered the movement and hoped that she was right. She knew how Lucius works and if this was his work perhaps she still had time to save Draco.
“10 am don’t worry we can sleep in for a little while.” Draco audibly exhaled, and Harry couldn’t help but kiss the bond once again. “Oh, I just saw Pandora and Fred Jr put something greenish into George’s drink, should I be worried?” He watched as Draco’s faced scrunched in confusion, then cleared and a smiled appeared.
“That’s the thing I want to do it. I need to say sorry, I need to apologize, not for Harry, but for myself. I have to make sure that I’m not like my father. I need to know if I’m redeemable.” Once again he could hear the desperation in his voice.
As Harry began to feel asleep he imagined all the afternoons and night they could spend together like this after they moved in together. Who knew that the two of them would work so well together. Harry felt a smile appear on his face as he imagined how their new house. The future started to look promising after McGonagall proposed him a position of DADA professor. At first, he was hesitant since he had no experience, but after he sat down and discussed the proposition with Hermione, Ron and Draco the three of them managed to give him some very good arguments. Ron and Hermione knew that he was a good teacher since the DA times and Draco informed him that the rest of the professors, as well as the Headmistress, would help him if he needed it. Besides, if after a year Harry decides that he wants to stay he could study and prepare himself for the position better. Harry smiled and moved closer to the blond, with his left hand he covered them with a blanket and fell asleep for the first time he didn’t fear what the future held for him.
"Draco," Pansy starts slowly, a look of absolute shock and horror etched onto her face. "we're brewing Amortentia." She adds.
Harry had begun to hate Hogwarts. Not because of the other students, but because of the new Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts; Dolores Umbridge. She worked for the Ministry of Magic, and everyone assumed that Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, is the reason that she was sent to Hogwarts. Because he's insecure in the fact that Dumbledore, as well as Harry himself, have claimed that Voldemort has returned, when he does not believe it himself, or doesn't choose to believe it. He had begun to feel himself becoming cold on the inside, and getting angry, far too angry than was necessary, it almost concerned him, but that would mean that he would have to care, which, at the moment, he didn't, or he didn't care a whole lot to do anything about it. About the anger that always seemed to be there, the anger that he never knows what to do with. The anger that he tries to push to the outside of his mind, but no matter how hard he tries it always finds its way back to the front.
"I'm not sure, he was still asleep when I left for breakfast this morning." Blaise answers with a simple shrug of his shoulders, head turning to look at the door of the classroom as Harry, Ron, and Hermione all walk in, seemingly so engrossed in their conversation that they don't notice two other Gryffindor students before they almost run into them. "Ha, what a bunch of idiots." He says before he turns back around to face where Professor Slughorn is fiddling around with a spare cauldron at the center of the classroom. "I think he was up all night doing homework, so he probably just slept in." He says, after noticing how worried Pansy still looks about their friend.
"Huh? I think everyone here is interesting." Harry answers honestly and with a shrug of his shoulders, as he had never been around so many vibrant and different personalities all at once before.
He had begun to loose his patience for those around him; especially his two oafish friends, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. He hadn't wanted to come to dinner that night, not wanting to deal with those around him, but he knew that it would cause more of a scene if he weren't to go, so, in the end, he decided on going to dinner. Though, he wasn't in the mood to talk to any of the other Slytherins around him, as he knew that he would snap at them, whether they were being annoying or not, it just hadn't been his day that day.
And there it is! My first ever completed work on this site! Thank you so much for reading, kudosing and commenting! It means the world to me :)
"It's not exactly a surprise you know, and if we wanted to make fun of you for it, we would have started doing that years ago." Blaise had admitted, as everyone in the Slytherin house had found Draco's 'obsession' with Harry, so to speak, rather odd.
"Yeah, it's all Potter's fault that Dementors are hanging around the castle." A different student says as the trio walks towards the Gryffindor table.
Blaise just nods in response to this, the classroom filling up with even more students as he does so. Professor Slughorn looks up at the class and seems to be considering something, before looking back down at the cauldron, signaling that class would be starting soon. "Slughorn is going to kill him for not coming, it's not like him to miss class." Pansy adds, sounding more worried about her friend than annoyed.
Pansy then proceeded to whisper something into his ear which made his cheeks and ears turn as red as the Gryffindor badge, or logo, or whatever someone prefers to call it, which made her and all of the Slytherins around him laugh, though no one but him and Pansy knew what made him turn that red. It wasn't that her comment was overtly sexually, or anything of that nature. It's just the fact that it had surprised him what she said and it had embarrassed him that they both knew that she was right, and there was no way that he could convince her otherwise.
Letting out a breath he didn't know he was holding he turns and looks back at the Gryffindors sitting around him before he tries to pay attention to the conversation going on around him. Though, both Ron and Hermione noticed who he was looking at, and what Draco did when the two locked eyes, which confused both of them, but neither of them brought it up to Harry, knowing that all it would do was embarrass him rather than give them the answers that they're looking for.
"Nice job, Mrs. Granger! Very good indeed. Now, if you all wouldn't mind coming up here, I would like to have a volunteer tell me what the potion smells like." Professor Slughorn says, making a waving motion with his hands as he does so, as if the motion itself will beckon his students closer to the cauldron, and the potion inside of it. "Now, is anyone willing to be my. volunteer?" He asks after all of the students have stood up and made their way closer to where he, himself, is standing.
"Harry," Hermione greets almost the second that Harry walks into the common room. "What did Zabini and Parkinson talk to you about? Did it have something to do with what Malfoy said during Potions?" She asks as Harry sits down on the same couch as her, with Ron sitting in the red, plush, armchair to the left of said couch.
"What is it?" He basically snaps at the other first year, not looking at her as his eyes dance around the room trying to find the Gryffindor that has constantly been on his mind since the previous night..
"Oh, uh, nothin'." Crabbe says stupidly, eyes lowering in slight shame before he continued eating his dinner.
And, without being fully aware of his actions, had been staring at the previously mentioned Slytherin for a good five to ten consecutive minutes, and he had been caught dead in the act by Pansy Parkinson. Much to her delight and his agony. As, when she caught him the two made painfully awkward eye contact before Harry could basically see all of the dots connecting in Pansy's head before a sick smirk spread across her face, a glint of mischievousness in her eyes as she turned to whisper something into Draco's ear.
"Look, I know that this may be weird for you, but it's even worse for Draco. He can't control how he feels, and he just outted himself to the entire class, and there's no doubt in my mind that by tomorrow almost all of Hogwarts will know. So please, take it easy on him, don't throw his feelings back into his face, he was never planning on acting on them." Pansy pauses for a second. "Don't use this as an 'advantage' in the fights that you get in with him, or whatever it is that you two do. I don't even care if you feel the same way for him, or even bat for his team, but don't use his feelings against him." She adds, making it sound more like a threat than anything else. "It doesn't matter if the two of you keep up with with this petty little feud anymore, just don't be an asshole about something he can't control, and don't go around telling everyone, alright?" She adds, sounding a bit sad as she does so. "If Draco's father were to hear about this, he would kill Draco." She adds, her tone taking on a bit more of a seriousness as she brings up Lucius.
"What? Why would I tell you guys? Just so you could make fun of me for it? Yeah, no thanks." Draco had scoffed as he had placed his hands on his hips in a rather dramatic fashion.
"Whatever." Pansy scoffs before turning and talking to the Slytherin boy next to her as Draco rolls his eyes, as Pansy is always trying to get his attention, no matter the situation, and it has begun to bother him slightly.
He rolls his shoulders before he begins to fill his plate with the foods around him that he wants to eat, though, he doesn't add very much, as he normally doesn't eat much during meal times. Once his plate was filled with a rather small amount of food compared to the amounts of those around him, he settles down in his seat, slowing his actions as he begins to eat his meal as his eyes search the room for someone that he knows he shouldn't be looking for. Before taking his first bite of dinner, he makes it a priority to find the other boy, as if he wasn't able to eat unless he knew the other boy was in the Great Hall with him.
"No, not really, I mean, it's no secret that I've had feelings of my own for him for about a year or so now, but, I don't know if it would be the best thing to just come out and tell him that, especially after all of the shit he's done." Harry says, as he came out to both Ron, Hermione, and almost the entire Weasley family the previous summer, but only told Ron and Hermione about his feelings for Draco.
Harry had been especially 'in tune' with his emotions, and in turn, he was painfully aware of the thoughts, especially the inappropriate ones, that went through his head each time that he saw Draco. And this time was no different, though, this time, he allowed his thoughts to get the better of him and carry him off into a daydream that was not, in the slightest, appropriate for school.
Though, one thing had stuck with him; looking for Draco during meals. It seemed as though that had become just as an important part of his life as either Ron or Hermione, though he would never admit that to anyone, let alone himself. He was supposed to hate the other boy, but, in reality, he felt the opposite of hate towards the blonde. It seemed to have moved its way into all meals, not just dinner.
"So? Why wouldn't you tell us?" Blaise had asked, and he had sounded slightly annoyed at the other Slytherin.
"That's odd, he never misses Potions." Hermione says, but with a quick shrug she focuses her attention back onto the small book placed on the table in front of her, seemingly not caring about the Slytherins whereabouts.
But one thing that he hadn't been able to hide from himself, no matter how hard he tried, were his feelings for a certain Gryffindor boy in his year. Even though everything that has happened between the two boys should make him feel the opposite of the way he does; he knows that there's no way that his feelings for the other boy will change, or nothing Draco could think of would change his feelings.
Not that he had a problem with eating alone, as most of the meals, and the time he spent eating said meals, he had at Malfoy Manor were spent alone, or with someone of the house staff, or even Dobby, before he freed himself, not that he would admit that to anyone though. So, he was fine with eating by himself, it allowed himself some time when he could think without someone asking what they should do every five seconds. He enjoyed being alone, he felt as though he performed his best by himself, such as for school, as it gave him the ability to think without being interrupted and things of that nature.
"It's a love potion." Blaise says simply. "It smells different for each person who smells it." He adds, and after a second of Draco not fully comprehending what that sentence means, he continues. "It smells like the person, or thing, that the smeller loves." He says with a roll of his eyes, as he and Pansy had known about their friends little 'crush' for years at that point.
"Huh? Yeah, fine." Harry answers, lying through his teeth, though Hermione seems to buy the lie as she goes back to listening in to the conversation that Ron and Neville are having next to her, only offering Harry a slight smile before she did so.
Draco hadn't even been able to come up with a witty remark, or even an insult in response to the whisper. All he did was sit in his seat, beat red, with his mouth wide open with nothing to say as the Slytherins around him laughed.
Draco was never one to worry about where he should sit and who he would be sitting with, and his time at Hogwarts, both during classes and during meal times in the Great Hall, was no different. He never had to worry as his 'friends' seemed to do everything that he did the time that he did it, so, when ever he woke up either Blaise, Crabbe, or Goyle would wake up within five minutes of him, without fault, and he was guarantied someone to sit with during breakfast until everyone woke up. But not this morning, he had even waited an extra ten minutes after getting ready before he decided to leave and get breakfast himself, not wanting to wait for anyone else any longer.
Harry had begun to get a bad feeling as his eyes drifting through most of the faces in the Great Hall, looking for one in particular with no success. His stomach began to drop as he continued to search and he still couldn't find the blonde haired Slytherin that he was looking for. He had been on edge ever since Mr. Weasley told him to not go looking for Sirius Black at the Leaky Cauldron. No, he had been on edge since before that, since the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, had pardoned him for using magic outside of Hogwarts. It seemed as though he had been on edge all summer, and just burst when his Aunt Marge came to visit.
Draco had had, a not so great day, his father had sent him a letter saying that he needed to hurry and find who had opened the Chamber of Secrets, or he wouldn't like what would happen if he didn't. Draco and his father had never had the best relationship, sure, Draco looked up to his father, and admired him, but he had never truly loved him, not like how he loved his mother, Narcissa. His mother was the only one who he had ever known who he knew had his back, and would always have his back, no matter what happened, and for that, Draco was grateful. But, as Draco got older, his mother didn't treat him as such, always babying him and calling him 'her baby' and other cheesy nicknames that almost every mother gives their child.
Draco wasn't interested in the other Slytherins sitting near him. He wasn't interested in them or the stupid conversations that they were having. He had only found interest in one person since he came to Hogwarts. And that was none other than the infamous Harry Potter himself. Though, he shouldn't be as interested as he is, as the other boy refused his offer of friendship. He couldn't help it though. It irked him that the most famous boy in contemporary European Wizarding history had been raised by muggles and refused to be friends with him. He, Draco Malfoy, had never been refused something in his life. Not by his father, and definitely not by his mother, who had, and still does, spoiled him rotten when he was younger.
But, he was grateful. Grateful that his friends knew him well enough to not mention it until he himself was comfortable enough with himself and his emotions to bring it up on his own accord. Though, he had noticed, in retrospect of course, that Ron had tried to bring it up a few times before Hermione shot him down immediately and before Harry knew what he was hinting at. Though, there had been a handful of times over the past few years that he had been caught in the act by other Slytherins at Draco's table, which instantly caused him to become embarrassed and he hadn't looked up from his table until the meal was over.
"If he doesn't come to me first within the next week or so, I'm going to talk to him first." Harry says as the first group of Hufflepuff students filter into the room for their own Potions class.
"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone." She had added, just as quiet as the first thing that she had said so only her and Draco could hear her, which Draco was internally grateful for, as he knew that, if she wanted to, she could have had that information around the entire school within a day, maybe less than that if she tried hard enough.
Draco Lucius Malfoy was never late. He had never been late to anything in his entire life. And yet, here he was, sleeping away in the Slytherin dorms, not only sleeping the day away, but sleeping through all of his morning classes as well. If it weren't for the loud screeching of his owl he may have just slept through the rest of his classes that day as well. Under normal circumstances, he was the first awake in his dorm, always making sure to go to bed at the appropriate time to allow him to get just enough sleep for the oncoming day of classes, as well as for the weekends. Though, the screeching of his owl was seemingly in vein, as he seemed content to stay within his deep sleep, only waking up merely five minutes before the class of his favorite subject was scheduled to start; and that class would be Potions.
"No, no I'm not." Draco snaps harshly, elbow on the table as he's resting his jaw in the palm of his hand.
It was in Harry and Draco's third year, within the week of the year, or sometime around then, and everything was going well. Harry, Ron and Hermione, though it was mostly just Harry and Hermione, had freed both Sirius and Buckbeak and they were both safe somewhere. Ron's leg had been steadily healing from where Sirius bit him, classes were going well, and all was well, for the most part.
"Harry? Are you alright?" Hermione asks, noticing that Harry was looking at the opposite wall of the Great Hall with a rather sad, and somewhat lost, expression on his face, snapping him out of his thoughts.
It was the last week of his and Harry's Third Year and he was beyond ready for the school year to be over and for summer to begin. So he could get away from all of the other students at Hogwarts, and Harry Potter to be more specific. It was during dinner and he, per usual, was starring off at nothing, or maybe Harry, he couldn't exactly remember, but anyways, that's besides the point.
"Sure." Hermione says with a quick nod her head, knowing that Harry will fill them in when he meets them in the common room, before she tugs on Ron's arm before the two leave the Potions classroom.
Draco lets out a rather loud groan as he practically bursts into the Potions classroom, instantly gaining the attention of all of his classmates as he does so; looking as if he had meant to miss the majority of class, with no hair out of place. Looking around, he realizes that most of his classmates have finished brewing whatever potion Professor Slughorn had assigned them. "Ugh, why does it smell like Potter's girly perfume in here?" He asks, rather loudly, as he takes his seat to the left of Pansy, either ignoring, or not noticing, the now shocked facial expressions of all of his classmates that heard what it is that he said.
After smelling the potion, a bright blush pops up onto Hermione's cheeks and spread all the way across her nose and into the tips of her ears. "I smell freshly mown grass, fresh parchment, and spearmint toothpaste." She says before taking a step away from the potion, almost to indicate that she is done talking.
"Are you joking? He's treated both of you, let alone almost everyone else in this school, like trash ever since First Year." Harry scoffs. "I could never condone that, and wouldn't I, in a sense, be accepting of his actions if I were to act on my feelings for him?" He asks.
Some time later – he was never sure how long – another figure stumbled out into the courtyard with him. Draco was too startled to move as Potter wheeled around and saw him.
. Harry had panicked when Malfoy had been captured and stunned the man standing behind Malfoy when Harry had finally found them. Unfortunately the man had Polyjuiced them both, and Harry had learned that the hard way when he raced towards who he thought was Malfoy and took his face in his hands.
Somehow it was always overcast when Harry walked up the path to the front doors. The cool wind held more bite than it should for an early-October afternoon.
Potter was somehow in the bar, brooding as usual. It had been years, but something made Draco throw caution to the wind and bring his djinn and tonics over to Potter’s table.
Draco stopped at the foot of one of the two main staircases. “As charming as ever, I see. Did you come here just to antagonize me?”
Harry had seen the article about his and Ginny’s breakup in the paper on Draco’s desk. Draco knew. Everyone knew. They never talked about it. What would they say?
Somehow, the insult made Harry feel a bit calmer. He met Malfoy’s eyes one more time before he pushed out of the office. When Malfoy found him an hour later, Harry was running the track in the new training wing (now with fireproof mats).
Potter’s eyes, which had so far been interested, slammed into fury in an instant. “I told you,” he began.
They hadn’t won every year since that first time. Once or twice they had been beaten legitimately. There was that year they got zero points each on a case, which hadn’t happened since
“Nothing,” Harry said, straightening up. Draco’s eyes followed him. “I’m not going to thank you for showing basic decency, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said, harsher than intended.
They Apparated to their flat. Harry sat on the bed in a state of numb shock which Malfoy hurried around the room, throwing things into a trunk and explaining the situation in a little more detail. Harry didn’t catch it all, but he heard enough – three or four months, special clearance, secure location, limited contact, no visits. And he was leaving in ten minutes.
An awkward silence had filled the kitchen, though it seemed more because everyone was waiting for Harry to act than because anyone was bothered by this news.
When Potter did, it was only to lean his forehead against Draco’s. Their breaths came out together. Somehow Potter’s fists had Draco’s robes, and Draco had his hands in Potter’s soaking hair.
Draco smiled back, and before he lost his nerve entirely, he produced a long-stemmed fire rose. The dark red petals were as simple as any other rose, but the silken surface of the petals smoldered and shimmered beneath the surface, causing a faint glow. The flower was breathtaking; it was the only thing Draco could think of as an offering to the man before him.
– and Harry had been so thrown by the sincerity in Malfoy’s smile that he couldn’t help as his lips parted, partly in surprise, but mostly in awe. He smiled helplessly back. They stood there a moment. They didn’t kiss, but it had stuck in Harry’s mind, and, bless him, Zabini had somehow been there to capture the moment. Harry never got tired of looking at it even after seven years.
There was a time that Harry never thought he’d ever have this, never have Malfoy staring into his eyes, their hands clasped tight. He never thought he’d be sitting on
“Stop that, it’s not – Draco – it’s not that funny,” said Harry, trying desperately to fight his own laughter bubbling up in his chest.
The damn Sorting Hat had tried to put him in Slytherin, and Harry had set out to prove it wrong. But bravery wasn’t a one-time thing; you had to keep being brave, again and again.
“It’s not about what we deserve, Malfoy – Draco,” Potter corrected, drawing Draco’s eyes back to his at once. “It’s not even about what we want.”
“I want to do this right,” Harry said into the kiss. Draco’s eyes widened. “I want to be with you. I just need something from you. Tell me you want this.”
Draco stared at the spot Welly had just occupied. “Mother’s going to kill me,” he said, and put his head in his hands.
Harry had just failed to do anything with the piece of mud and leaf cake that Bill and Fleur’s daughter had just offered him at Ron and Pansy’s wedding. Where the child had found mud in the shining sea of pristine white tents and crystal accents in Ron and Pansy’s backyard was anyone’s guess, but Harry took it. When saying thank you wasn’t enough for the girl’s expectant eyes, Harry handed it back to her. The girl looked crushed.
Seamus cackled and pulled the tiny pile of knuts into his hand. “Two weeks in a row, Weasley,” he said.
Never one to outright admit when he was at fault, Malfoy looked down for a moment, then back up at Harry. “Am I?” he asked, softer this time.
A timid house elf opened the door when Harry knocked. He almost left right then. Who where the Malfoys to keep an elf when they had treated their last one so terribly? He hadn’t come here with anger, but he felt it now all right.
“Are you staying after all?” he asked. His voice betrayed no sign that Harry’s answer mattered to him, as always.
“If Thomas and Louison hadn’t found you in time, you’d probably be dead,” Shaklebolt told Harry as though neither of them had spoken. “Consider yourself suspended until the end of the week.”
The elf had barely started on cleaning the table when Draco called him. He looked startled to be addressed and approached Draco slowly.
Harry nodded, eyes still closed, but Malfoy had his arms around him now, his check pressed against Harry’s. The Scottish chill was starting to fade as Malfoy pushed their bodies together. Harry’s arms came up around Malfoy, and he leaned into him.
Shacklebolt seemed to expect this. “I might remind you that you work for this department and not the other way around,” he said, shuffling some papers.
But Draco was almost crying with mirth. “I’ve never seen Father so horrified,” he managed to say. “Please do that more often. No, wait. Let me sell tickets first.”
Harry’s breathing went desperately shallow. “Yeah?” he asked, biting off a moan as Malfoy’s lips made their way across Harry’s jaw to his neck.
Malfoy had a small curl to his mouth as though he might say something sarcastic, but his eyes were gentle, and Harry knew he wouldn’t just then. He was waiting for Harry to be all right too.
Draco, who never took anything the right way, blinked once in disbelief. “Are you s–” He looked outraged. “Fine,
“Draco,” Harry said, low. Draco hadn’t given him much. Nothing, really. But Harry had come to be brave. “I’m sorry I left. I’m sorry because it was rude and you deserved an explanation, but I’m mostly sorry because I’ve missed you so much.”
“What?” barked Harry, distracted by Malfoy’s incomprehensible ramblings as Malfoy probably intended.
Ron looked back. “That’s lucky. That means both of you probably messed up,” he said. Hermione choked into her tea.
Harry’d thought Malfoy had finished packing a while ago, but he was still puttering around, moving things here and there, checking a short list Shacklebolt had given him. The timed portkey – a ceramic salt shaker – sat on the dresser near the bedroom door.
“Why Potter,” Malfoy said, mouth quirking, “and here I was thinking you still didn’t understand the points system at all.”
Work kept him busy during the week, and Saturdays remained pub night with the Gryffindors. He and Ginny had cooled off a week or two later and had a more reasonable breakup the second time. At Harry’s insistence, Ginny even said she’d continue to live there, and promptly took the big bedroom on the third floor that Harry knew Ron had been thinking of for a nursery in a few years.
Grimmauld Place was a place of many comings and goings, party central on weekends, and residence of up to six witches and wizards at any given time. Harry and Ginny had a bedroom on the fourth floor. Ron and Hermione on the third. Harry had knocked a massive skylight into his room so it felt like being in the great hall at Hogwarts.
Draco’s breath caught. Harry tilted his head up and caught the breath with his lips. Draco leaned in, hesitant, wary, but he kissed Harry back all the same. After a moment, all Draco’s hesitation was gone. He gripped the front of Harry’s shirt and kissed him and kissed him.
Ron looked at him sharply. “Well you have to tell her soon,” he said. “Even if she weren’t my sister, you still can’t go back and forth in your mind forever.”
A cold wave of dread filled Harry’s mind. Malfoy almost never called him that. Aside from a handful of times in bed, the last time he’d heard his given name from Malfoy was when his Aunt Petunia died last year, and Malfoy thought Harry was feeling something that required delicacy.
All too soon, Potter pulled away, but his smile lingered. “Do you want to come inside for some tea?” Potter asked.
Ginny apparated into the bedroom late that night, already irritated at something that had happened at practice. Harry was hoping to find her in a good mood, but in the end, it was probably for the best. It turned into a fight, both sides shouting things that were both hurtful and true. Harry collapsed exhausted into bed alone that night, but it felt like a weight had been lifted. No more lying. No more affair. No more Ginny. No more Draco.
Malfoy took a glance around the living room. Harry had insisted Malfoy decorate since he couldn’t care less about what his living space looked like so long as Malfoy was in it. Malfoy had the exact taste Harry assumed a rich pure-brat would, but Malfoy’d still asked Harry things like “The indigo accent pillows or plum?” or “Would you rather have sex on this sectional couch or a chaise lounge by the window?” so Harry felt like it was his too. They had elegant dark wood furniture, but the coffee and dining tables had a visible grain and a live edge, so it gave it just a hint of a rustic feel. It was fancy and cozy all at once.
Harry stayed on the floor a while. It was nice here. The floor never left him for Sweden. And it’s not like he’d be able to return to their bed without Malfoy. Harry took one look around; it was clear that he would have to move.
Potter seemed to remember the rose in his hand and looked down at it as though seeing it for the first time.
Draco got surprisingly close to the door before they noticed him, but noticed him they did. Soon bulbs were flashing, and the crack of new reporters apparating to the spot filled the air. He even heard the sizzling crack of wizards apparating from outside the country.
“My goodness!” Lucius exclaimed loudly. “Someone must exit the dining room and retrieve a towel!” He fled the room, his wand abandoned next to his toast.
Malfoy didn’t even pretend to be surprised by the interruption. He only slowed, shoulders sagging as though relieved Harry had stopped him.
Harry took advantage of Draco’s glee to swipe the last of the bacon on Draco’s plate. Draco looked briefly outraged, but his laughter had taken over, and Harry wasn’t sure Draco could stop at this point.
Draco’s shocked expression brought Harry back to reality. He and Lucius both froze for a moment before the pouring tea rose up and out of the cup onto the table.
“But actually,” said Malfoy, examining his nails, “I also seem to remember that my work here is done of my own free will, which I can revoke at any time.”
Potter’s smile in the kiss. It was mesmerizing. He didn’t even notice the press having a collective heart attack behind him.
Potter watched them with a composure Draco didn’t remember him having as kids. Figures Draco could feel his face burning and Potter was back to his dark stare all over again.
It was more because Draco couldn’t stand to see Potter look dejected and broken that he did it. Draco took another step and took Potter’s chin in his fingers like Draco had a death wish.
Draco Malfoy had been a mistake. Obviously. But things were not all right between Harry and Ginny, even if Draco had been removed from the equation.
Draco finally pulled his head back and looked at Harry with pupils blown wide with desire. “Bedroom. Now.”
It happened because Draco was a coward – always had been – but for once he wanted to see what it was like to be something else.
“No!” Harry said, laughing. “I mean–” He held out his hand to Draco, who looked like he was beginning to understand. Harry was beginning to understand too. “I mean I want you to go with me.”
Potter’s mouth. Which curved into a smile – a real one. Not one Draco had seen directed at him before.
Potter’s anger had subsided, but Draco couldn’t quite discern the expression on Potter’s face now. Maybe because he couldn’t quite meet Potter’s eyes.
Welly cautiously reached for the shoe. Draco raised an eyebrow. The elf’s fingers closed around the slipper.
“You’re right,” Draco said abruptly, even though that’s not quite what he’d intended to say at all. “I do owe you. You didn’t have to help me. And I would do anything to repay what you’ve given me.”
Potter looked back at him, still looking like the avenging angel who once pulled Draco onto a broom and out of the fires of hell. Draco wondered for a crazy moment if Potter had caused the rain to wash away the last of the smoldering embers of the curses that had struck them all.
But now there was no Malfoy here to save Harry from Rahim, or possibly vice versa. Malfoy had been reassigned for a few months – it was supposed to be three, but Malfoy’s last letter said it could be up to six now – and now Harry was supposed to say it out loud.
Potter watched him for a moment like he hadn’t even heard Draco speak. After a moment, he turned away, but his lips moved as he did so, and his words were lost in the downpour.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispered. They had their foreheads pressed together, breathing heavily even though not much had happened. Harry closed his eyes because he already knew this moment was going to haunt him, and he didn’t need more fodder for his dreams. Instead he felt Malfoy’s fingertips against his face, across his lips. Someone might have even said something more, but the portkey buzzed, giving the one-minute warning. When Malfoy sighed and stood up, Harry felt safe enough to open his eyes.
Potter did, but he pulled back almost immediately after, stepping back and untangling himself from Draco.
He was back at home ignoring Blaise’s owls before he thought to wonder what Potter was doing in a gay bar.
Malfoy smirked and turned back to Harry, dusting off some of the mud cake that had fallen on his black dress robes.
“Don’t want to hear what?” Harry challenged. He’d been ready to leave a moment ago, but now Draco’s tone had touched a nerve, and he was back at Hogwarts, furious and wanting to make Draco
Draco was ready to move past it too, though he’d had very different ideas of what that looked like. The first time he’d kissed Harry, the kiss had gone on entirely too long before Harry had broken away and explained in great detail about how utterly heterosexual he was while Draco went steadily pink and tried to pretend like Harry wasn’t speaking.
“Sir, what Potter no doubt means is that, while crazy, his heart of gold was in the right place,” Malfoy said. “And anyway, who’s to say I wasn’t kidnapped as part of my plan? It could have been part of my plan. I would have pretended to fall in love with my assailants, and then, on our Linen anniversary, I would have revealed myself and our dastardly plan to take them down. They would have been foiled by
Malfoy turned quickly and met his eyes then, Malfoys own eyes narrowing to slits. Harry stared right back.
“Clearly I’m at zero points for getting captured and Polyjuiced,” Malfoy said thoughtfully. “What about you?”
Afterwards, they got dressed in comfortable silence, shooting each other the occasional grin. Draco had objected to the getting dressed part at all, but Harry didn’t want to give Lucius a heart attack by finding them like that in the library. Heart attacks were too fast for how Harry planned on killing him.
Harry ran his hands up Draco’s arms. Draco was standing almost between Harry’s legs now. Harry could feel him trembling.
Harry did, but he didn’t want to have sex in a cold tent with half the office no doubt listening just outside. With a flare of shining professionalism, Harry took a half step away from Malfoy’s embrace – being careful not to step on the debris of his tantrum – kept their hands linked, and Apparated them straight into their living room.
“A suspended trained professional,” said Malfoy, dropping a look at Harry’s mouth that was entirely incongruous with his words. Harry felt his breath catch in his throat.
The water turned off before Harry could come out of his thoughts. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he came back into the room, dripping water on the hardwood.
“I thought you were the straightest straight guy who’d ever lived,” Draco breathed as Harry kissed him. So he had been listening after all. Lucius had said something long-winded about how he absolutely had correspondence to attend to, and he was absolutely not fleeing the sitting room of his own house in terror. Harry had moved fast, straddling Draco on the sofa and bringing their mouths together. Draco responded hungrily, hands flying to caress Harry’s face and neck and shoulders.
Harry was breathing hard, and he was still on edge. Still not right. He clenched his teeth and closed his eyes tight.
Harry had about to say something incredibly foolish back. But the words died in his mouth. He wasn’t with Ginny anymore, and there was no more buffer between his life and Draco Malfoy. He’d even just addressed a Death Eater by his given name, for God’s sake. If he’d said it, things would get real.
Draco looked at him like he’d just grown antlers. “I didn’t exactly come kicking down your door to get you here, you know.”
“No, you just happen to run into the man who’s been obsessed with you for years in a gay bar and it’s totally innocent,” said Blaise.
“Wouldn’t mind,” Harry muttered, turning back to Malfoy with a trace of a smile. Malfoy’s lip curled in reply, though it seemed more wry than happy.
Malfoy crossed the room slowly and knelt in front of Harry by the bed. “It’s better this way,” Malfoy whispered up into his face. “Isn’t it?”
He knew Malfoy always lashed out disproportionately when he was angry or hurt, but Harry hadn’t thought he’d have that thrown in his face after all this time.
"He's right." Pansy had said with a shrug of her shoulders. "And even if we did want to make fun of you for it, we wouldn't. Why? Because we're your friends and, this may sound surprising to you, but we actually care about you." She had added, voice softened as she did so.
"Fine, you guys can go on ahead, I'll meet you in the common room." Harry says, turning slightly to look at Ron and Hermione as he does so.
"Isn't someone missing?" Ron asks, looking around the room with a skeptical look on his face. "Oh! It's Malfoy." He says, his malice for the other boy practically rolling off of his tongue with the boys last name.
"Harry?" Hermione asks after she notices what, or who, Harry is looking at with a dreamy look in his eyes.
He didn't know why Ron had automatically assumed that it was his fault that his name ended up there, but he had gotten to angry at the accusation to actually fully talk to Ron about it in the first place. So, him and Ron were no longer speaking to one another while Hermione stayed on good terms with both of them, though she seemed to have taken more of Ron's side of the situation. Ron had begun to become closer friends with Seamus and Dean while Harry was either alone or spending time with Hermione or Neville.
As soon as Professor Slughorn had dismissed class, Draco basically stormed out, not even sparing a second to tell either Pansy or Blaise where he was going. Though, neither of them try to stop him as he storms out, knowing that, from what had happened during class, he needs a little time to himself to try and figure out what his next move is going to be, and that he'll talk to them when he's ready. It doesn't stop them from being concerned about him though, but they know him almost as well as he knows himself, if not a little more, and they know that now is not the time to be following after him like lost puppies. They take their time to collect their things and to put them away, as it is their last class for the day and dinner was still a few hours away.
"Nothing, nothing, I must have zoned out or something." Harry says, eyes drifting down to his plate, playing with his food as he does so.
"I assume that this is about what happened during class." Harry says as he crosses his arms over his chest, leaning against the table he's standing next to.
"Oh, alright." Ron says, doing the same as Harry, both not being hungry, as all they want to do is get their friend back.
Jealousy wells up in Draco as he sees Harry laughing with Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and few of First Year boys. He instantly shuts those thoughts down, knowing that he is meant to be in Slytherin and that he is meant for more than to associate with blood traitors or mud-bloods. Or that's what his father tells him.
"Potter?" Blaise says, only receiving a short nod from Pansy in response. "Do you really think that that's the best thing to do? Shouldn't we let the two of them figure it out?" He asks.
"Draco?" A second year boy named Vincent Crabbe asks, calling the blonde boy out of his thoughts just as his eyes land on the Gryffindor that he had been looking for for the past minute or so.
this is a bit shorter than the other chapters so far, but it's almost 4 AM and I have a test at 9, so I gotta get to sleep soon :)
After successfully reaching the Great Hall, he notices, almost instantly, that only a few other students are in there, some are eating, while others, for some reason, have brought their homework to do while eating their breakfast. Being the first Gryffindor to sit down, he chooses close to the area where him, Ron and Hermione normally sit, as most people have sat in one general area their entire time at Hogwarts, and they don't like it when people up and change their seats, or the general area of where they sit.
"Yeah, okay, well, now you know, I guess." Draco had shrugged, not knowing what else he should have, or could have said. "Just, if you two want to make fun of me for it, fine, I'm not exactly happy with my feelings either. But just, please, don't tell anyone else." He had added, knowing how bad it would have been, and still would be, if his feelings for the other boy were 'leaked'.
"'Oh' is right." Pansy says as Draco's face begins to visually turn redder and redder with each passing second until the blush has practically consumed his face and is now making it's way down from the tips of his ears.
Though, unbeknownst, to Draco, this would not be the last he heard of his feelings towards Harry, especially from Pansy, who seemed to only be interested in that subject and that subject alone. And eventually, meaning by later on that night, both Pansy and Blaise knew about his more-than-friends, completely-different-than-'enemies' feelings towards the infamous Harry Potter.
"Did you get your permission slip for Hogsmeade signed?" Ron asks, expertly changing the subject, though, he didn't know what, or who, Harry had been staring at just a few moments before.
A few, maybe ten or fifteen, minutes pass before Harry actually begins eating, he, for the most part, was just sitting at the table, absorbed in his own thoughts. A few moments after he begins eating Draco, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini walk into the Great Hall, all three seeming to be paying their full attention to the conversation that they're currently having, sparing no time or attention to any of the other students in the Great Hall with them. Harry allows his eyes to follow the trio, as he has nothing else to entertain him, as they walk over to the Slytherin table, all sitting down where, Harry has noticed, are their usual spots, as if their names have been written at the places that they sit so they can remember exactly where it is that they should sit.
"Probably. Hmf, what an idiot." Pansy says with a huff, sounding annoyed as she crosses her arms across her chest as she leans back into her seat.
"Nothing, never mind." Pansy asks, as she can tell when she isn't wanted, as Draco's eyes fall on the Gryffindor boy.
"Draco? Are you even listening to me?" Pansy Parkinson whines from across the Slytherin table, brown hair pulled into a loose pony tail.
"Huh? What do you mean?" Draco answered, having decided that 'playing dumb' was the best thing to do.
"Thank you." Draco had said, thankful that they were more understanding that he thought they would have been about the whole situation.
"What're you looking at?" Ron asks, turning around slightly to try and see what his friend was looking at so intensely.
Harry had quickly looked away, not wanting to make eye contact when Draco would, and he had no doubt about this, look over at him before laughing and storing the information away for later use that would no doubt humiliate Harry for the rest of the week. Though, that never came, the humiliation nor did the loud laughing from the Slytherin that he had assumed would happen. It had seemed as though Pansy hadn't even told Draco that she had caught the Gryffindor boy staring at him.
"Leave him be." Percy snaps at the twin who asked Harry that question, knowing what he was getting at without having been fully attentive to the conversation. "What class are you most looking forward to?" He asks Harry, instantly changing the subject, as a few more of the First years who are sitting near them, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan for example, join in the conversation.
Moving his eyes back to the table in front of him, he begins to eat the food in front of him. Which is a few pieces of toast, some sausage, bacon and a large pile of scrambled eggs, just as Hermione walks into the Great Hall, hair pulled into pony tail on the crown of her head.
"You know what I mean." Blaise had said, eyebrow raised, with a knowing look that had made Draco realize that he wasn't going to be able to get out of that conversation, at least not by playing dumb.
And during this meal it was no different. It was the first time since the three of them became friends that Hermione wasn't there eating dinner with Ron and Harry. Which threw both of the boys through a loop. As they both relied on her for more than they realized. Harry loaded his plate with as much food as he could fit before allowing his eyes to scan the Great Hall for a certain blonde haired Slytherin. He let out a noticeable sigh of relief when he found the other boy, but it almost instantly got stuck in his throat when he saw that Draco almost looked sad at the Slytherin table. Nothing was on his plate and he was looking down at the ground, resting his chin against the palm of his hand, not talking to any of the other Slytherins who are sitting around him.
"So, Harry," Fred, or George, Harry couldn't exactly tell the difference between the two yet, asks with a wide smirk plastered onto his face. "have you met anyone interesting here, yet?" He adds, as if he has caught on to something that Harry isn't even aware of himself yet.
In their first year, Draco noticed, and he noticed quickly, that most relationships tended to stay within houses. Meaning that most people in Slytherin and Gryffindor would, typically, only be friends with people in Slytherin and Gryffindor exclusively. Though, some Slytherins and Gryffindors have become friends with people in Ravenclaw house and Hufflepuff house, as the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses don't have rivalries with any of the other houses.
Draco, not being one to step down, continues looking at the other wizard, waiting to see if the he would turn around and look at him again. Which, sure enough, he does, and this time Draco smiles, even if it's a small smile, he allows it to rest on his face for a few beats before he diverts his attention to the conversation going on around him, knowing that he had made his point, and that the other boy understood that point.
"Should we say something to him?" Pansy says, breaking the silence as she pauses with placing her things inside of her bag to look over at Blaise.
"Alright, fine, I don't hate Potter, far from it actually." Draco had scoffed, as he had gotten up from one of the couches in the common room just to begin pacing the length of the room, though, Draco can't remember why he did that, as he had never been known to pace when he got nervous or anxious, or anything like that.
Andromeda just smiles beside Malfoy. She moves in order to sit in a way that will allow her to see Malfoy’s face better. Slowly she brings her hand to his still red and swollen cheek.
“That depends am I going to get in trouble?” The carefree tone in which Harry asked the question told Draco that the idea of getting in trouble wouldn’t scare the raven-haired boy off.
He closed his eyes when the time for his punishment came. He knew what he deserved and what he didn’t. He definitely didn’t deserve Potter’s testimony, he also didn’t deserve for his aunt to show up and testify in his favour. He wanted to shout, scream that he wasn’t worth it. How could they do this, didn’t they knew that no one could save him. No matter what they said Draco knew he deserved punishment for his crimes, but he was set free. Draco couldn’t believe what he heard. He will need to return to Hogwarts and his punishment required him to undergo a psychological evaluation. At this Draco couldn’t breathe.
Harry pulled Draco into a quick kiss before they enter the potion classroom, since the beginning of the additional Potion lesson tough by Draco, they had even less time they could spend together. Harry wanted to complain, but for the first time in his Hogwarts education, he actually understood Potions. Draco was a surpassingly good teacher, he didn’t insult anyone and even though there were better and worse students he tried to focus on everyone equally.
For a moment Harry couldn’t comprehend what the blond was saying, but after a second he realised what is happening. Quickly he nodded. “Yes, Hermione is great at research. We will ask her tomorrow. But now are you going to sleep some more or do you wanna sneak to the kitchens to eat something? I know you didn’t eat during dinner.”
I hope you all had a pleasant Monday and that all of you stay safe and wear a mask to the protests and just generally.
“And what if you can’t?” Draco’s voice was so quiet that Harry thought that he imagined it, but after a second he continued a little louder. “What if I’m too damaged, too broken, too destroyed? What if even a saviour like you cannot fix me?”
Her eyes landed on Harry, and she saw that his eyes didn’t leave the unconscious boy. He looked exhausted and Andromeda doubted that she looked better. After a few seconds, Harry rose his eyes and looked at her.
Hi, so I guess I'm writing the 3rd story, which is cool because I had this idea for a very long time, and since you helped me choose I decided that you can help me some more. I'm thinking of one day writing a story about Draco being a seer because I really like this trope, but I'm also not opposed to putting a seer Draco in this story, tell me what you think.
After the sorting hat, was placed on his head, Harry held his breath and waited. After what seemed like forever to him, the hat shouted. “Hufflepuff.” Teddy looked at him, and Harry couldn’t help but smile at the boy, he held up a thumbs up and started to clap. After a moment he turned towards Pomona and noticed that she looked proud yet upon closer examination, she also looked a little anxious and terrified, and Harry almost laughed, he couldn’t agree more.
Draco knew that sooner or later he would have to leave his aunt house and do some school shopping. Andromeda lent him some money, but he still couldn’t fight the dread that came over him every time he thought about stepping outside Andromeda’s house. He knew that she can’t go with him, someone had to stay with Teddy. Draco didn’t blame her, honestly the kid grown on him. He hoped that his presence in the house won’t influence the child negatively.
Something changed, of that Harry was sure, he wasn’t sure what brought the change but after their trip, Draco was more relaxed and Harry could see that he slept better. Slowly the dark circles that took residence under Draco’s eyes started to fade and he became more talkative. Harry loved to observe the different interactions between Draco and their other pears.
Everything was different for him even something so simple as meal times. While at the Manor they eat in silence and he was never allowed to eat much, at Andromeda’s mealtime was never silent and Andromeda encouraged him to eat whatever he wanted. Although because of anxiety he didn’t eat much, he ate what he liked and that was enough of a victory for Draco.
I hope that your Pride month is amazing even with everything that is going on. Additionally,  hold J. K. Powling accountable for the hate that she is spreading during not only pride month, but also when people are fighting for their right to live.
He felt Andromeda’s hand closing around him. “Draco it’s not your fault, it never was and it will never be, do you understand? What your father did was wrong and no one should be hurt by someone they trust. He cursed you Draco, what he used was black magic and it never should be used on another person.” Somehow when she acknowledges that what happened to him was bad he felt a little lighter.
“Draco relax. Breath, in and out. You didn’t do anything wrong. Come on sit.”  He felt so pathetic but complied.
“Malfoy, slow down or you going to have a panic attack.” The boy still didn’t move his eyes from the floor, but his posture changes a little bit and Harry is sure that Malfoy understands him. “Breath with me”
“Draco, this is a brilliant idea and you want to tutor the students.” This time he noted that Harry’s voice was soft once again.
McGonagall was silent, Harry looked up and noticed that she was lost in thoughts. After a moment she asked. “What changed?”
“Oh, I think that would work.” There was a moment of pause after which the blond added. “We can leave the hiking or camping, I’ve always wanted to do it, but my parents decided it was undignified.”
When Teddy began Hogwarts, Harry gifted him his invisibility cloak after Harper joined him the two of them started to share the cloak. Now as more and more of their family were attending the school, the cloak was in constant use, to solve the problem their brilliant daughter decided to develop a potion that would work similarly to the cloak, but with a set timer. Draco was proud that she showed such an interest in Potions, but he was also worried about the use that this particular potion when she succeeded because Draco did not doubt that she would.
“And why are you in pyjamas at noon?” Harry’s blush became even more prominent, and Draco could hold his smile.
“I didn’t really leave Andromeda’s house and besides they don’t care about the relationship I have with my parents. I’m going to talk with some person that probably hates me because of the family name that still exists in my papers. They will probably threaten me and that’s that nothing new if you think about this.” Harry, hated how dejected Draco sounded.
He knew that Harry is going to look for some excuse, but recently spending time away from the raven-haired boy was becoming more and more difficult. He knew that now that they won’t be rooming together for two weeks their scheduled film/game night will resume, but it was still not enough.
After they finished the dinner Draco went to fetch Teddy and the four of them sat at the sofa while Teddy’s favourite show played in the background. Soon the conversation came to a close and Draco excused the two of them taking Harry back to his new room.
When they stopped near George’s chair Harry was confused for a moment, everything looked normal, then George’s hand that still held his cup started to disappear. Harry blinked and shook his head, but the redhead's hand was gone or invisible as he was still holding the cup. Suddenly Angelina screamed and pointed at George’s hands, the redhead looked down and jumped out of his seat.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco turned to look at him, and Harry couldn’t breathe, the blond still could make him breathless with only one gaze.
"Do you really think he would do that? Sure, Potter's an idiot, but he's not a downright, grade-A asshole." Blaise says with a shrug as he slings his bag over his shoulder, Pansy mimicking his actions a few seconds later.
"Hey, Potter, can we talk to you for a second?" Pansy asks as her and Blaise drawer closer to the 'golden trio', who have now focused all of their attention onto the two Slytherins.
"I don't think it was anyone in Gryffindor who said something." Ron says, speaking up for the first time. "I mean, I talked to Seamus and Dean when we first got here, and they said that they had heard some of the Slytherins talking to some Ravenclaws about it just outside the classroom." He adds, further explaining his assumption. "Do you know what you're going to do when Malfoy talks to you?" He asks after a couple beats of silence.
And, without fail, Hermione's hand shoots into the air with the speed of a wannabe rocket ship, just as it has since her first day of her First Year.
"I can't believe that Sirius Black hasn't been caught yet, they know where he's coming, here! And he's coming for Harry Potter." Harry, Ron and Hermione hear another student say as they walk into the Great Hall.
"Oh, my god." Ron says from the opposite side of the Potions classroom, as even the Gryffindors in the room had heard what Draco said, sounding as equally confused as Harry currently looks. "Wait." He adds, turning to look at Harry, who is still sporting a dumbfounded expression. "You, and Malfoy?" He asks. "Since when?" He adds.
"Fine, just give him a little time." Pansy says before her and Blaise turn and leave the Potions room, Harry following shortly behind them, but not close enough to feel obliged to continue their conversation, though, they do part ways almost the second they leave the classroom; with Harry going to Gryffindor common room and them going to the Slytherin common room.
Draco doesn't waste any time in allowing his eyes to land on the one person that he's looking for, the one person that he 'needs' to see to make the anxious feeling in chest finally dissipate. He's not surprised to see the other boy looking around, as it seemed to be the one thing that he always ended up doing during meal times in the Great Hall rather than focusing on the conversations going on around him. Though, he is surprised when Harry stares at him dead on, and is even more surprised when the other boys cheeks begin to turn a light shade of red before looking away.
Almost subconsciously his eyes began to search the room for one boy, a Gryffindor, in particular. He had always found an odd sense of comfort in looking, and being near, the other boy. Ever since their first year at Hogwarts, he had had what some would call an obsession with the Gryffindor boy, though, he had never said that to anyone, because he knew better than that. He knew that if anyone found out about his obsession with the other boy not only would his pride come into question, but his loyalty to the Slytherin house and his own family, and their allies and their importance to him would be questioned as well.
"Oh." Draco says, sounding dumbfounded as he now realizes that he has outed not only his feelings, but his sexuality, to the entirely of his potions class, and even the person said feelings are towards.
"So you're telling me that I have to wait until Malfoy is done having his little tantrum to even try and resolve this?" Harry asks, as Blaise has just made it seem like Draco would just throw a fit if Harry were the one to try and initiate a conversation about their newfound issue.
"Very good, thank you Mrs. Granger." Professor Slughorn says quickly. "Alright, now, off with the rest of you! Once you have finished brewing your potion, compare it to the color and smell of the one I have brewed myself, you have the entire class to do so." He says as he slides the lid of the cauldron back onto the one in question before the class all move back to their individual seats to brew their own 'versions' of the aforementioned love potion.
He had never felt more alone in his life. Well, ever since he started going to school at Hogwarts that is. As, since day one, he's had Ron there by his side, and it was odd to no longer have that.
"Not if he tells you that he's willing to change." Hermione says simply. "I assume that most of the things he says are only to keep up appearances, and I think this because if he was truly an awful person, he would never have developed feelings for you in the first place. If he's truly as awful as he acts, he would, subconsciously or otherwise, have never allowed himself to develop feelings for you." She pauses. "Most of his actions, and his supposed beliefs, are because of his father, I doubt that he actually believes most of the stuff that he preaches about." She adds. "So, when he eventually does talk to you about all of this, ask him, and if he truly does believe and agree with all of the horrible stuff both him and his father have done, well, I assume you can figure out what it is that you should do. And if he doesn't, then it's truly your call, but I believe that you should make the decision that will make you the happiest, and if that means trying to pursue a relationship with Malfoy, then I support you, and if not, I will still support you." She adds.
"Huh?" Harry asks, slowly pulling himself out of his thoughts, sitting up straight before he turns his attention over to Hermione.
"Thank you." Draco had muttered quietly before he went back to his dinner, his face slowly returning to it's normal shade of pale white.
"I'm not talking to you, Weasel." Pansy snaps before turning her attention back over to Harry. "A word?" She asks, clearly not intending on taking 'no' for an answer.
"Very good!" Professor Slughorn says with a wide smile on his face. "Go ahead, take a good whiff or two." He says, making yet another hand gesture to indicate what she should do.
It was the morning after they had been sorted into their houses; Harry into Gryffindor and Draco into Slytherin. Harry had felt something for the other boy that he couldn't place, nor did he want to. SO, he went for the nest best thing, alienating the possibility of friendship with him altogether. He was eating his breakfast with his new friend, Ron, and Ron's older brothers when he felt the need to look for the Slytherin boy. The need came so quick, and so strong, that he had no other choice than to raise his head from his plate and allow his eyes to scan the entirety of the Great Hall.
"It makes sense, what they said to you. No one can control their feelings, or who they develop feelings for, and Malfoy is, apparently, no exception. So, if you were to use his feelings against him, that would just speak about you, and your character, rather than his." Hermione pauses. "Though, I don't understand why they are making you wait on Malfoy for this one, he must understand that this isn't only affecting him, right?" She asks, though she doesn't intend to get an actual answer. "I mean, even just when Ron and I were walking back here, a bunch of people stopped us asking about the two of you, and some of them aren't even in our Potions class." She adds.
As soon as his eyes lock onto the other boy he feels, weirdly, relaxed before he begins to eat his dinner, now noticing that the conversations around him have died down as mostly all of the others at the Slytherin table begin to eat their dinner. He lets his eyes fall from the Gryffindor boy and look around the rest of the Great Hall, though, he doesn't notice anything that catches his attention as he continues to eat.
Draco had had enough of his Slytherin peers, they had been bugging and pestering him for days about how it was madness that Dumbledore assigned Hagrid to be the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Yes, he knew that it was not a good decision, but he only knew, or thought that, because of what his father had told him about the oaf of a teacher in the first place. Draco had never had a bad experience with Hagrid personally, he even secretly liked the half-giant half-human, though, he would never admit that to any of his peers, and especially not his blood elitist father, Lucius Malfoy.
He knew that it was odd that whenever something seemed to happen in Hogwarts, or in the Wizarding World as of late, that he was always, whether he liked it or not, was caught up in the middle of all of it. But he thought that Ron had gotten to know him well enough that he would never try to bring more attention to himself than absolutely necessary, especially if it included going against Dumbledore.
Harry let out a sigh as he sat down at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, Hermione and Ron doing the same. With the year drawing to a close, everyone was itching for summer to begin, no one, other than Hermione, wanting to do their end of year assignments which were due the following week. Harry, unlike Ron, had begun his assignments, though he hadn't gotten far into any of them, just forming a base to work on when, he knew, that he would be finishing them last minute. With what happened at the Ministry of Magic, Harry had felt himself becoming lost, as who he considered his last family member, Sirius, had been killed. He had no hope, or any plans, for the future, and it was really beginning to get to him.
And so, from that point on, Draco made it almost crucial to wait until Harry looked back at him until he looked away from the boy, always allowing a smile to slip onto his face before he did so. And Harry, after a few days, began doing the same thing without even realizing it until Ron had asked him why he was smiling so much during meals, which caused him to just smile more, as it was something that he had completely to himself. Or something that him and Draco shared without anyone else having to know, or without anyone else pointing out what they were doing.
"Yes, Mrs. Granger?" Professor Slughorn says, sounding almost impressed that she is the one who raised her hand.
"When he's ready, he'll come and talk to you about it, but if you try and push him to talk about it when he's not ready, things'll just get ugly." Blaise says, as he knows Draco well enough to know that what he said is true, and Pansy knows this as well, which is why she almost subconsciously nods after Blaise has finished talking.
Draco was tired. Tired of his father. Tired of his mother. Tired of Snape constantly breathing down his neck during the school year. Tired of other Slytherins. Tired of all of his 'friends' who are in Slytherin. And tired of having to act like someone that he isn't. This isn't something that he could express though, as he wasn't one who was a fan of either pain or discomfort. So he suffered in silence, and he had been ever since before he could remember. He was used to it, that and hiding away his own thoughts and emotions, especially from himself.
He assumed from the hushed talking around him that had happened ever since First Year that some of the other Gryffindors had picked up on his, 'habit', though, no one had ever mentioned it to him directly. Not even Ron or Hermione, and he KNEW that they knew, or he knew that at least Hermione knew, but, for as much slack as people give him, Ron isn't as stupid as he looks. Including when it comes to other people, ESPECIALLY Harry. But he knew that if either Ron or Hermione had brought it up to him he would have just denied it and told them that they were crazy, or something along those lines.
Though, the one thing he could not stand when he was alone was seeing others together and having a good time, as it made him feel left out, and almost secluded, from what has going on. And this morning was no exception to that, as when he walked in the 'golden trio', or Harry, Ron and Hermione, had already started eating their breakfast and they were all heavily involved in the conversation they were having. So, with having no one to sit with and no one to talk to while he ate his breakfast, he decided that he would stare, though, he hated the word stare, it made him feel like a creep. Not stare, he would look at the 'golden trio' openly, as he nothing else to entertain him, or to pass the time while he waited for his friends to wake up and join him for breakfast.
"Huh?" Harry answers, getting snapped out of his thoughts, eyes drifting to look at his best friend.
"Yeah, they told me to not use Malfoy's feelings for me against in him in our fights, or feud, or whatever it is that we have going on. And they want me to wait around until he has the guts to come and talk to me about it himself." Harry says with a sight, slumping further into the plush couch cushions. "I just wish that I could talk to him about it now, to just get it over with, you know?" He adds, turning his head slightly to look at Hermione, who only offers him a sad, yet understanding, smile.
Harry was overjoyed, finally, after almost two weeks of constant nagging, Draco agreed to meet with Hermione and Ron. He knew that this was a big thing for Draco and although he wasn’t pushy per se he was talking more and more about the two.
“I…” Draco starts, but didn’t finished and Harry worries, but then he looks up and holds his free hand out to Neville. “I will help you, but I have a condition. We can discuss it later because I don’t everyone to see as Harry drags me away from here, but tomorrow we can discuss your plant and my condition. Now goodbye Neville.” When Harry looks at Neville the boy is basically jumping with excitement, he sees him nod, but after that, he is pushed forward by the blond Slytherin almost losing his footing and landing on the stone floor.
Draco turned and looked at him with a shocked expression. “I’m able to babysit on my own Harry.” The emotions behind this statement were not hatred, so Harry knew that he could persuade Draco.
“No one ever did anything that nice for me. I’ve always been a burden for people. I don’t know how to repay her Harry.”
It was a drawing of Draco and him laying tangled together in bed. Harry knew that it was a drawing made by Draco and he couldn’t believe how talented the Slytherin was.
Harry came back 5 minutes later carrying their ice cream. “So, I didn’t really know what would you like, but I know that you have a sweet tooth because Andromeda always has some sweets for you, so I bought you Kinder Bueno flavoured ice cream. I’m pretty sure you will like them.” Harry said and handed Draco the ice cream.
Harry couldn’t help but think that the holidays came too quickly. One moment he was laughing with Draco under their tree and the next snow was everywhere and Draco refused to go outside for longer than an hour, so they spend most of their time either in the library, the common room or their dorm.
“Do you want to go shopping with me. I know that you didn’t do it yet.” At Draco’s questioning gaze Pot – Harry continued. “Andromeda told me that you haven’t left the house for the past month.”
