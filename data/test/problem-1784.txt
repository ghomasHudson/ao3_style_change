Potter walked the few steps back, coming to stand infront of Draco, still holding his glare.
She took one step back, then another. Her hands were fisted to her sides. “You didn't. How could you? Why?” Turning, she rounded on Ron as he walked into the room. “Tell me you didn't have anything to do with this, Ron! Malfoy?”
Potter wasn't looking at Draco. Facing out, his eyes squinting, crinkling at the corners as he looked out into the street. Draco heard a soft snap, and the din from the street went quiet. Draco almost snorted, would have, if he wasn't trying to control his breathing. Of course Potter could do a wandless Muffliato. Of course the fucking first time he had come anywhere near the wizarding world Potter would be there.

Follow Me Down by 3OH!3
He had to remember how to breath a little bit more after learning he'd be returning to Hogwarts.
“Er, just look for my owl, alright. See you.” With a twist and a crack, he was gone.
Snatching his wand from Potter's hand, Draco surveyed him with a cool eye.
He watched the papers, saw every picture of every funeral.
Well, everyone would have, but secretly they would have agreed, it was a ludicrous idea he go. He'd be killed on the spot, wouldn't he?
“Er, well, ok. So,” Potter stumbled over his words. Draco wondered just where exactly the sure, confident man from just an hour before had gone. Was this the same person who had stood, in front of the whole of the Wizengamot and spoke for Draco. Spoke for Draco in the kind of voice, the one where you can hear everything the person is saying, but you find yourself straining forward anyway, trying to take in their words, sink into them.
Draco didn't have a tutor either. Because, Dark Lord, Marked, Second Wizarding War losing side. Same old song and dance.
Potter caught his arm, Draco took a step and then looked down, then up again at him.
May 29th, 1998
He thought, probably not. The Weasely's had lost one of their own, so maybe they did. But Potter had done it, he'd defeated the Dark Lord. He probably didn't have nightmares anymore, if he had. They'd gone when he'd killed him. He'd done what he'd set out to do, so he was probably okay now.
Draco Malfoy knew he had no need to sit his NEWTS. No one would be hiring him. He would sit in the Manor, day in and day out.
Showered, shaved, and dressed comfortably, he was NOT going to put on nicer clothes until the last possible second, thank you very much, Harry made his way to the kitchen. He hadn't heard a peep from Kreacher, which was just as well. Didn't need to start his day before 5 am and be ridiculed. Even Malfoy hadn't ever managed to make fun of Harry that early.
Harry walked up behind them, spotted the wall. There was a huge, smoking crack. Hermione looked back at Harry, something like fear in her eyes. “Harry, what?”
She said is so softly that Harry could almost, almost think she wasn't upset about it. Seeing as he knew her much better than that, Harry looked up and caught her eyes. She stood again.
“Ginny, we thought it throu-” Ginny rounded on Hermoine, her eyes absolutely furious.
So, the same day he'd had for the last seven months, give or take the entire 2 years before them.
Harry glanced at the clock on the table, 5:27. Deciding that managing to avoid thinking about why he would have to be putting on nice clothes for a grand total of 35 minutes wasn't half bad. In the last few years Harry had become a pro at shoving down his feeings, after all. All but throwing himself into a chair, Harry ate his cereal with a scowl. If Hermoine had been there she would have scolded him, telling him, “No one is going to believe you want to testify for the Malfoy's if you look like you're doing it against your will, Harry.”
Tumbling back through to Grimmauld, Harry spun and cast with fumbling fingers the charm to block his floo for an hour. Just an hour. He needed, well he really didn't know what he needed. He needed to breathe, he needed to warm up. He was so cold, he couldn't feel his fingers, his grip slipped on his wand and he let it fall. Stumbling to the couch, he reached for the throw, pulling it up and over himself. He wasn't going to think about anything right now. He refused.
Also, let me know what you thought of this chapter !! :)
Draco huffed a laugh. “If only”, he mumbled.
brush, though neither boy seemed to mind all that much.
Seeing as she wasn't going to get any reaction out of him anymore, Ginny stood, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezing it reassuringly. "You know you can always talk to us. We're your friends after all", she whispered, a sad smile playing around her lips.
"Sorry?" Harry asked, tilting his head, confused. "For what?"
Why he hadn't learnt from his past mistakes, he didn't know.
He couldn't quite remember
"Ronald!" Granger scolded, an exasperated look visible in her warm, brown eyes.
He didn't want to show his sketches. Not yet, at least. He didn't want Potter to know everything and ruin the fragile friendship - if he could even call it that - that they had formed so far.
Anyways, enjoy chapter 8!
At one side of the room - opposite of the entry door - there was another door that led to a simple bathroom with two lavatories, a toilet and a shower. One of the sinks was clearly already claimed as different glass bottles, filled with questionable liquids, decorated one half of the shelves.
He looked up from where he had been staring at the ground, his emerald green eyes meeting Malfoy's silver ones.
Though his stomach was protesting profusely, Draco sighed and ate more of the chicken on his plate. He knew they were right, of course. And he really didn't want a repeat of the situation from two years ago, thank you very much.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked confused as he dusted off his clothes.
Harry hated feeling that way.
Still confused and feeling very stupid because he had probably looked over the other half of the costume and Draco would definitely complain about blind Gryffindors and their inability to find something even when you would hold it right in front of them, Harry opened the bathroom door.
“It’s… it’s really not, Harry.”
Again, Harry waved away the words, shaking his head with amusement now visible in the depths of his green eyes. "Don't worry about it. It was the right thing to do."
Finally - after what felt like an eternity - Harry managed to get his brain working again. He shook his head and raised an eyebrow at the blonde next to him. "I'm not so sure I know what you're talking about", he admitted quietly, scratching the back of his neck with a sheepish smile gracing his lips.
The couple glared at each other as Harry ran a tired hand through his messy, dark curls. He loved his best friends - he really did - but sometimes they could be such a pain in the arse. Even when they weren't together yet, they would start arguing about the smallest things like the amount of sugar they used in their tea.
"These two colours are your new house colours", McGonagall explained. "You're new robes, as well as you luggage will be sent to your dorm which you will share with one other student. Your names are engraved next to your doors."
"Alright, Malfoy", Ron said, his voice cold as he addressed the blond. "You'll have to show us what you've got."
As Draco opened his mouth to voice his thoughts to the portrait, he was rather rudely interrupted by a voice coming from a portrait a bit further down the hall. "Why yes of course, Salazar dear!"
Mr. Weasley was also sitting on the ground, his hand rubbing comforting circles on his wife's back, his eyes red and his lips trembling. Every now and again he would lean closer to Molly, whispering sweet nothings to try and calm his distraught wife down.
It wasn't often Harry got to see the Slytherin so relaxed. He liked this side of him better. It made him look younger. It even made him look kind of... cute.
would wait on the rocky shores of the island, their scales the only colour against the dull grey of the stones and the water.
Why couldn't he do this, dammit?!
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes, he loved his friends. Though he couldn't help but feel like sometimes he was being the third wheel ever since the two of them had gotten together. Not that he was complaining. After everything they had gone through, they all deserved some happiness in their lives. It just felt like sometimes he wasn't needed anymore; like he was a superfluous piece to the puzzle. Sometimes it felt like the Golden Trio had become the Golden Duo.
Draco squinted into the dark when he saw some movement at the edges of the garden. A figure was walking through the grass, making its way towards Draco’s balcony. A figure Draco would recognise even if he would be blind
Harry laughed at the dark blush creeping up the ginger's neck and onto her freckled face. He threw his head in his neck. "Hello to you too, Gin."
Still looking a little doubtful about it all, Teddy finally dared to leave the safety of his – rather too obvious – hiding place. “But one of Gran’s books said the Thunder Gods come to the earth every now and again to snatch innocent children away from their parents!”
appeared on the parchment were dark ink stains from where his - once again - borrowed quill had been hovering above it.
With a slightly shaking hand, Harry pushed open the door of the compartment and stepped inside.
“Yes, I did!” Draco exclaimed. “I messed up the perfect opportunity to bloody propose to you! And it’s all my fault! How could I be so stupid?”
Wary of what he might find around the corner, Harry gripped his wand tightly - his knuckles turning white as he did so - and walked forward. His instincts were screaming at him to turn back to the safety of his own common room; that this wasn't a good idea. But Harry never really listened to his instincts when it came to danger, now did he?
"Your voice, owls and footsteps."
Once again, Malfoy turned around, although now his eyes were more curious - and a bit accusing - instead of spooked like only a few moments earlier. He raised one of his pale eyebrows at Harry, urging him to elaborate.
As everybody rushed to their dorms to find out with whom they will share a room for the next ten months, Harry stayed behind in the - now abandoned - common room. He didn't feel like going to probably his and Ron's room, having to listen to Ron's endless blabbering about the Chudley Cannons' bad performances lately.
Draco peeked out from between his fingers. “
again "And since when have I ever done anything you told me to,
Ron's hand squeezed his shoulder painfully hard as Harry stood up from his crouched position on the ground, turning his back to the body lying on the ground.
He looked back up to see Potter staring at him, his head tilted in question. "Why are you smiling like that?" The annoyance from before seemed to be completely gone.
"I've already told you," Harry mumbled, his voice low and annoyed, "don't worry about me. I'm fine. Just not hungry at the moment."
Knowing Draco would already be upstairs, getting ready for tonight, Harry walked up the stairs. At the top he was greeted with hushed voices coming from one of the rooms a little down the corridor. The door to Teddy’s room stood ajar, the sound of Teddy’s and Draco’s voice drifting through the small corridor. Harry walked closer and peeked inside.
Harry’s frown deepened as he watched Draco run a shaking hand through his hair. This wasn’t about what he thought, right? Not after the lovely evening they had had so far? Harry had cooked them a delicious meal and Draco had brought home a fine French wine. They had had a comfortable candle-lit dinner, talking about their days, making plans for the weekend.
students who didn't seem to have a problem with betraying Hogwarts during the Battle."
What the hell just happened?
Draco’s smile softened, his hand caressing Teddy’s blond hair. “Alright then, Champ. Let’s get dressed then.”
Uncorking the small bottle, Harry poured the liquid in his mouth, closing his eyes as he felt the pain slowly fading away. He sighed contently as he stretched and walked to his desk, gathering all the materials he would need for the many assigned essays this week. He already felt ten times better.
Draco huffed a laugh at the confused look that slowly replaced the panic in Harry's eyes. He smiled, proud at his accomplishment. "And lastly, name one thing you can taste."
thought about was winning that damned cup! Fred and George were always complaining and making jokes about his obsession with winning. I'm fairly certain that if he could, the bloke would have married the bloody cup long ago."
Harry had to admit, it felt rather nice. He had always liked that about his relationship with Ginny. Whenever he was around her, he didn't feel the need to fill up every moment with pointless small-talk, like many of his fellow year eights had been doing with him recently.
Tilting his head with a playful smirk dancing around his lips, Harry said, "I can't complain."
Draco shrugged, turning his head away as he looked at something outside one of their windows. Harry thought he could see the blond blush though.
That was, until he had received his Hogwarts letter.
Draco nodded too, a small reassuring smile grazing his lips.
“No”, Draco said quietly. He met his mother’s eyes, only cringing slightly at the raw emotions he could see written across her face. “I’ll leave, if that’s what you want.”
Careful not to make anything worse, Draco moved his hand from Harry's shoulder to his shaking hands, taking them into his own to steady them.
"Mr. Potter! May we ask you some questions?"
Potter stood up from his desk and walked towards him, a predatory smile on his lips as his gaze shifted to the sketchbook still perched against one of his legs. "Care to share what it was that made you smile?"
about me? Oh!" - he gasped, placing a hand dramatically over his heart, his eyes wide - "Can you imagine! The great Draco Malfoy, Prince of Slytherin, caring about
didn’t particularly help either.
Harry nodded in greeting. "Good... morning, Sir."
After what felt like hours, with Harry still awkwardly standing in the doorway, fighting his internal battle, Hermione finally made the first move. She closed her ever present book and stood up, crossing the small gap between them and throwing her arms around Harry.
Curiosity getting the better of him, Harry took a few steps towards the box and peered inside when Draco lifted the lid. Though all he could see was bright orange fabric neatly folded to fit inside the box. “Don’t tell me you bought more curtains”, he said, one eyebrow raising.
That had been almost 5 years ago and still... they hadn’t been able to clean and repair everything. It almost felt useless now...
know someone. After all, sometimes people think it's safer to hide who they really are behind their masks of indifference."
And if he needed a late-night talk in the common room after a rather stressful day, both his friends would listen and talk with him until none of them could keep their eyes open for much longer.
A few weeks after the war had officially ended, Harry had needed some time alone to process everything that had happened. He had needed time to think, time to battle his demons. And when people kept ambushing him from the moment he set a foot outside, asking him questions about defeating Voldemort or begging him for yet another autograph, he decided it was time for him to disappear for a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
A frown had appeared between his eyebrows as he frantically patted his pockets. “Oh Merlin, where the hell is it?”
And with a last smile, Luna let go of his wrist and walked out the front door, her blonde curls swaying in the slight summer breeze as she walked. Once Harry felt her cross the heavy wards that guarded the old house, she Disapparated from sight.
. He closed his eyes, not even wincing as a throbbing pain spread through his head from where he had hit it on his desk. His glasses dug painfully into his face, though he didn't care.
Harry silently took the offered piece, a thankful smile on his lips. "Thank you, Gin."
Harry huffed, raising an eyebrow in playful challenge. "Who are you to command me like that?" he smirked. "I don't recall agreeing to being bossed around."
The morning before his eighteenth birthday, Harry had been sitting in one of the comfortable armchairs with a hot cuppa of Earl Grey in his hands after a rather rough and sleepless night when all of a sudden he had felt something cross the heavy wards he had placed around the old house.
Nodding his head once with a polite smile, Draco turned around and started walking down the maze of corridors to the Entrance Hall at top speed.
It was already late in the afternoon of the following day when Harry joined his year mates in the common room. He had lost track of time when he was rewriting his Potions essay, causing him to miss both breakfast and lunch - much to the disapproval of Hermione.
Draco was still standing next to the couch where Harry had last seen him, looking as regal as ever with a soft smile decorating his delicate features. Even from the other side of the room Harry could see and
"Guys," Ron muttered under his breath, "I'm right here, you know."
“Of course”, the Siren said, confusion lacing their voice, “why would I lie?”
"A headache?" Malfoy asked. "Why don't you simply take a Pain Relief potion?"
"Anyways," Helga said, "good morning, Mr Malfoy. Going for a fly on this cold day?"
Biting his tongue to prevent himself from saying anything that would get him into more trouble, Draco kept quiet. He knew what they were trying to do, but he wasn't going to take the bait.
A layer of pink coated her cheeks as she looked away. "Yes", she whispered, smiling brightly.
“You look absolutely stunning, love”, Harry growled against Draco’s neck, rolling his hips forward again and relishing in the amazing friction that caused. By now he had Draco pressed against the wall next to the fireplace, one leg between Draco’s legs.
helping, Potter.”
Though he couldn't help but try one last time. "Brilliant", he responded, willing his lips into a - what he hoped to be - reassuring smile. "I'm doing brilliantly."
"Yeah, see you", Harry mumbled to himself. He turned around and made his way further down the train to get to his friends' compartment.
As Harry swung his legs back over the back of the armchair, he scanned the upside-down common room, noticing a pair of grey eyes looking in his direction, once again.
- of having to keep living through those never-ending nightmares. He hadn't had a nightmare-less night in what felt like forever.
"Honestly, Ron," Ginny sighed exasperatedly, "could you stop whining for one minute? I've only just arrived and I already wish I didn't join you at all." It was silent for a moment and Harry could clearly picture the annoyed look on Ginny's face, even though he couldn't see it from where he was standing. "I can see now why Mum practically forced you to go back."
"Alright, Harry", Draco said gently, his thumbs stroking over the back of Harry's hands in a slow rhythm. "I want you to name five things you can see."
The fuzzy feeling in Harry's chest he had been feeling lately returned, his lips twitching into a small, involuntary smile. "Are you sure it was Hermione's idea and not yours, though?" he asked. "Maybe you're just concerned about me? Maybe you actually
Luna waved away the concern, a smile growing on her pale face. "Nothing's wrong", she assured him. "I've just totally forgotten I had promised Ginny I would meet up with her to get some school supplies and join her afterwards for a cup of tea."
His mother had persuaded him into helping her clean the Manor. She had made it her mission, from the moment they were locked up inside their own home after the trials, to get rid of any Dark Magic still lingering around the rooms.
Now, Malfoy seemed more relaxed, more careless somehow.
Wasn't Salazar known to play the game himself, from time to time? Wasn't he one of the people who had taken the initiative to make teams for every Hogwarts house?
far away. You can always floo over for a visit."
He felt tired, yes, though he couldn’t ignore the faint thrill that had started growing in the pit of his stomach all afternoon. Tonight wasn’t over yet. It was All Hallows’ Eve; the one evening on which both Harry and Draco traditionally went trick-or-treating with little Teddy. They would Apparate or Floo to their friends’ and family’s homes, asking for candy, dressed in the most original costumes Draco had come up with that year and
However, before he went inside, he glanced back at Harry still standing in the empty corridor. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but shook his head. "I'll see you around, Potter", he said instead and went inside, leaving Harry alone.
Harry, on the other hand, absolutely adored the hot weather. Despite the way he had been feeling over the last few months since the end of the war, summer always made him feel more alive and he found himself smiling more often.
People were dancing and singing on the streets below, the orange-yellow hue of the streetlights making everything look ethereal. It was Harry’s favourite time of the day. He had just eaten a delicious home-cooked meal and was now relaxing with a glass of wine on the balcony, enjoying the slightly off-key French songs filtering up from the crowds below. The iron railing of the balcony was adorned with wisteria, the sweet smell filling his nose.
Ginny shrugged and turned her head his way, a sheepish smile grazing her soft, pink lips. "Luna's told me", she said. "I'd heard Hermione has been looking for you all day. So when I was... spending time with Luna, I asked her and she told me to find you here." She gestured around them.
"I hope you are aware that there are only two Chasers", Blaise commented, raising an elegant, dark eyebrow. "We need three, though."
A dark shadow hovering above you, clouding your view of reality. It leaves you feeling empty as loneliness slowly creeps through the cracks of your skin, swallowing the small bits of happiness on its path.
And this time their hands
A small gust of wind blew inside the room, his platinum hair falling slightly in front of his eyes and Harry thought - in that moment - that Malfoy looked like he came straight out of one of the portraits spread around the castle. He looked like he was
“So, we’re not going trick-or-treating this year?”, Teddy eventually asked, his voice sounding slightly muffled against Harry’s chest.
or helping his mother cook in the kitchen, but ending with more food on his face than in the pot...
And what better way to do it than with the person that meant the most to him (after his mother, of course)?
Draco nodded, promising to talk to her soon as the girl made her way back towards the Slytherin table.
Yet they all knew it wouldn't stay by only mild stinging hexes for long.
Also, let me know what you thought of the first chapter!! :)
So that’s how they had ended here, in a countryside cottage away from all civilisation. The nearest village – a small Muggle village – was about ten kilometres to the west. Not that the distance bothered them much; they could easily Apparate there after all. The only thing that bothered them – mostly Draco though – was the fact that it was a
Laughing loudly, Harry followed his boyfriend to pick up Teddy and go trick-or-treating.
Draco felt his chest tightening, his breath speeding up a little more. Although the little voice in his head was jumping up and down in excitement at the rather close proximity.
"And where are you going, young man?" a deep familiar voice called from behind Draco.
Draco returned the glare, already opening his mouth to retort a nasty comment, but one look at Pansy's cautionary eyes, Blaise's raised eyebrows and Theo's slightly shaking head, made him close it again.
Malfoy turned to him expectantly, a faint blush visible on his normally pale cheeks. "Yes...?"
“What are you thinking about, darling?” Arms wound themselves around Harry’s waist, a pointy chin resting on his shoulder.
It were those small things about him - small things in his behaviour - that made the concern for her best friend grow each day as she watched him helplessly change into a shell of who he once was.
McGonagall gave the portrait one of her rare, genuine smiles. "Quite well actually", she said. "Busy, but well."
With a heavy sigh, Harry opened the letter, his eyes quickly scanning the piece of parchment.
He had shaken his head, throwing the letter on the coffee table, and had sat back down in the chair, picking up his cuppa and taking a tentative sip.
Seamus wiped it away with his thumb, cupping his cheek. He leaned forward and kissed the other boy, Dean responding by wrapping his arms around Seamus' neck and pulling him closer.
He wished he could find someone who would look at him like that: with love clearly visible in their eyes. Someone who would hold him in the middle of the night when the nightmares managed to overtake the little happiness he had still left in his life. Someone who would whisper sweet nothings in his ear to try and calm him down when even the grounding techniques his mind healer had learned him didn't work.
, Harry thought.
He felt more than saw Harry shrug. “It’s the most important thing.”
The smile now fully spread across Draco’s face. “Well, yes. Yes, I did.”
Maybe everything would be okay. Maybe he didn't have to worry about anything. After all, Ron and Hermione still were his best friends.
Potter started at that, big, green doe-eyes staring at him, unseeing. From this close Draco could clearly see the panic in them.
Though Draco had his own flat on one of the side streets at Diagon Alley, the people who lived in his building weren’t the most welcome towards him. Even his landlord – an old man with a stomach so big Harry wondered how he even fit through doors – hadn’t been very civil towards Draco.
"You will pay for what you've done, you filthy
But with Draco looking at him like that; like he understood exactly what was happening to Harry; like he truly wanted to help him with whatever was happening to him...
Neville and Hannah were talking animatedly about Merlin-knows-what - probably some plant they found exciting. Harry could see the faint blush that coated Neville's face or the small,
Hermione's suspicious gaze held his own for a few more moments. A few moments in which Harry feared she had looked right through his easy lie and was now readying herself to scold him and tell him lying wasn't going to solve his problems.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. "I'll eat it later", he said, motioning to the plate. "After I've finished this essay."
Yes, he preferred summer far more than the cold and dark winter.
Often, Draco would be seen walking with some of his friends down the corridors, but never alone. Probably to prevent students from doing him more harm. With the Ministry breathing down his neck, Draco couldn't afford to be involved in any fights. They would gladly throw him in Azkaban for that.
Harry gaped openly at the girl sitting next to him, absolutely flabbergasted about the fact that she had figured something out even
He had brought Draco’s knuckles up to his mouth and placed a loving kiss on top of them.
“Take me”, he said, no,
They both stood up from their places on the armchair and turned to Harry. "Will you be alright without us?" Hermione asked, giving him a gently smile as she tried to hide the obvious blush on her cheeks.
Harry froze in the doorway at the sight in front of him.
It was right in front of him, dammit!
Draco moaned at the friction, his hands gripping Harry’s hips tightly for a moment. “Alas…”, he sighed heavily, releasing Harry, and taking a few steps back to create a little room between the two of them. Still, Harry could clearly see the lust and the desire swirling in the silver depths of his boyfriend’s eyes. “We don’t have time to do that right now. I’m sure Teddy’s already waiting for us.”
As if by some invisible force, Harry felt his legs move and before he knew it, he had crossed the room, his arms wrapping around Draco and their lips furiously crashing down on each other.
When she had asked him that question the first time she had come around, he had lied to her like he had done with the countless of other people who had asked him. However, she hadn't taken his
Harry’s expression softened. “It’s almost over.”
He wouldn't blame Draco.
The first time Harry had asked Malfoy, he had looked at him much the same way as he was now - with an eyebrow raised and a bored expression visible in his silver eyes. He had simply turned away from Harry and resumed his writing, ignoring any further attempts of asking him for his quill.
Luna gasped loudly, flailing her hands around her head as if to wave away the invisible creatures. "I really should be going then before my mind becomes too clouded", she said quickly, grabbing her bag and walking in the direction of the front door.
book he had found rather interesting whilst Pansy was trying to sleep, her head resting back on her boyfriend's shoulder. Draco opted for simply staring out the window at the passing fields and woods. Watching as the fields slowly changed into higher hills and even some mountains with low current creeks lazily meandering their way through.
A smile of her own appeared on Rowena's full lips as she clapped her hands together, her eyes now scanning the students behind the Headmistress. "Oh, that must be our Eighth Year students!", she exclaimed happily. "Welcome back. My name is Rowena Ravenclaw. I am one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts and I - together with my three companions - will be guarding your common room."
Draco returned her smile. “Thank you, Mother”, he said.
"Please", the voice - Harry now recognised as his mother's - whispered softly. She sounded as broken and defeated as Harry felt himself.
Harry waved away his words, determined to - for once -
"Indeed they were, young man", Godric smiled, a faraway and glassy look in his dark eyes. "It's a shame it had taken me so long before I truly saw them for who they really were, though. It would have saved us a lot of fights and nasty words."

marry Astoria.”
And that was all it took for Harry to give in. He crouched down in front of the Siren’s bemused face, his knees scraping the rough stones.
"I have to share a room with Blaise bloody Zabini!" Ron's arms swayed around dramatically and Harry couldn't resist but to roll his eyes at his friend's antics.
stop gloating about his first win of the season. He even declared the Eighth Years will win the Quidditch Cup this year. Ha! As if they will stand a chance against Gryffindor!"
He was fully laughing at that point, his Transfiguration essay completely forgotten.
If only he could remember where he had put his Pain Reliefs.
"Two things you can smell."
The Siren reached up to cup Harry’s cheek. Their hand felt cold against his burning skin.
Harry visibly flinched at that, causing Ginny to withdraw her hand. "I'm fine", he muttered lowly. "You don't have to worry about me. I've told all of you
"Says the one who probably won't even try out to be on the Quidditch Team anyway", Justin Finch-Fletchley joined in. Theo ignored him.
"I'm not hungry." Harry shrugged.
"Breakfast's ending soon", Harry noted, eyeing the numbers of the watch on his wrist before turning to his friend. "You should go down to the Great Hall, Ron. Hermione is probably waiting and you don't want to be late, do you?"
The soft voice of Ginny Weasley drifted through the silence as she sat down next to him, her arm slightly brushing against his own. Her brown eyes were looking out over the lake.
It had even reached front page news in the Daily Prophet:
Yet when he walked down the stairs into their living room and saw Draco standing in front of one of the windows, looking at the depressing, grey outside world in just a pair of black skinny jeans with a silver belt and the same shirt as Harry – only his was midnight blue instead of maroon – he couldn’t help but release the breath he hadn’t realised he had been holding.
"Ginny", he whispered, his green eyes finding her bright brown ones.
But who would want to be with a Death Eater like himself? Who would ever be able to look at him and not see him for the boy with the disgusting Dark Mark, but for who he really is? Broken and in need of someone who truly understood him. Someone who could love him unconditionally.
The silence that followed nearly suffocated Harry as he stood in the doorway of the narrow door, not trusting his legs enough to take another step forward.
Also, let me know what you thought of the chapter!! :)
"Bloody hell, Harry! You're still in bed?!"
have had her wand she wouldn't have stood a chance against the dark wizard in the room. Voldemort was the strongest he had ever been at the time.
"I'm so sorry, Fred", he whispered, his whole body shaking like a leaf in a storm.
"You know", Luna continued, her eyes wandering the room until they landed back on him. An involuntary shiver ran down Harry's spine at the intensity with which her blue eyes stared at him. "From the moment I had entered the house today, I saw more Wrackspurts than usual. The closer I got to you, the more there were. You're practically covered in them."
The wind was howling in his ears, his heart beating rapidly and his veins full of adrenaline. The rush of finally being back in the air, the gold-winged ball fluttering right in front of him as he chased after it, Harry hadn't felt this good in a very long time.
A startled yelp suddenly sounded from behind him, the yellow robes of the Hufflepuff Seeker disappearing from sight as they were hit by a well-aimed Bludger from one of the Eighth Year Beaters - Harry thought he could faintly hear Terry Boot's triumphant howls.
All other things weren't important in this moment. He was free in the air to do whatever he wanted.
! The good news is that the Weasleys have invited us to celebrate All Hallows’ Eve with them.”
Harry squared his shoulders and righted his back. “I’m not… I’m not afraid of you.”

Harry took another handful of the powder and went to throw it in, but something caught his eye. There, on the coffee table lay another tiara – no, a
"I don't think you have to worry about Astoria either", she continued. "She's a very lovely girl, though I'm fairly certain Draco doesn't really swing that way."
However, as Ron was about to enter through the portrait someone else entered at the same time, causing the ginger to stumble slightly. He looked up annoyed, only to be met with the dark robes and blond hair of none other than Draco Malfoy.
At that, Harry had raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing around the corners of his mouth.
"Wood?!" Ron exclaimed. "The only thing
If only Ron would notice it too, though...
Taking in deep breaths through his nose and breathing them out through his mouth, his eyes wandered around the room, inspecting every little detail he could find in the dark.
"I don't want to hear it", she simply said. "I know you're sorry - of course you are - but do you have
the better Seeker."
As a matter of fact, he wasn't moving at all.

"Don't act as if you didn't mean for this to happen, Harry! This is all your fault!"
The happy chatter of the students down in the common room already met him halfway down the stairs.
managed to make them work for the both of them.
When he had emerged from the bathroom, Draco was already standing in the living room, his white angel costume – consisting of a tight, white t-shirt with large wings on the back and white leather trousers – a stark difference from the dark and gloomy atmosphere of Harry’s flat.
"Oh! My dear Minerva!", the woman - now called Rowena - exclaimed, her sapphire blue eyes sparkling with excitement. "I'm so glad to see you again. How have you been?"
As his breaths slowed down and he looked around the room in hope that nobody had noticed his little episode, he found a pair of silvery grey eyes staring at him, an unreadable expression on his face.
The second time Harry had asked Malfoy to borrow a quill, he had sighed and had thrown one at Harry's face without looking up, even though Harry swore he saw the corners of the blond's lips lift up slightly.
become friends, Harry didn't think they could be classified as
He was absolutely tired - no,
Harry couldn't help but wonder if Malfoy noticed all the vile looks that were sent his way as he stood there in the small corridor, his piercing gaze roaming over Harry's face.
At some point during the evening, the 'celebration' party for the Eighth Years had moved to the shores of the Black Lake. All Eighth Years, and a few of the younger years as well, were sitting around a large campfire, laughing and singing campfire songs - although the latter had left most purebloods
"I think that question answers itself, Sir", Draco replied, gesturing to his old, green Quidditch robes he was wearing and the broomstick firmly held in his hand.
Still patting Harry’s back, Draco nodded.
And even though Harry had laughed at the ridiculousness of his boyfriend’s behaviour at that moment, now he had to admit he used the mirror more often than not. Not that he would ever tell Draco that.
"You haven't turned up at any of the meals today", Draco mumbled, looking everywhere but at Harry.
They had encouraged him at times he thought he would have given up. They had held him as he cried into their shoulder at times where all the bottled up emotions came flooding out at once. They had even stayed awake the whole night with him when his nightmares had become so bad he was unable to fall back asleep.
Surprisingly, the practice game had gone smoothly.
Confusion crossed Ron's face, his eyes narrowing and glaring at Draco. "Are you sure you don't need any help with the Ferret?"
"Just go, Harry", Hermione said quietly, coming to stand next to her boyfriend, whom took her into his arms again. "You're only making it worse for everyone."
“Hey!”
Why won't they go away? Why wouldn't they leave him alone? Why wouldn't they take a few steps back so they weren't standing as close as they did now?
in different corners of the bathroom. How Draco could even live like
"I don't think you should keep taking that potion", Ron continued.
So, he had fallen back into the routine of avoiding sleep as much as he could. He would often do some homework or he busied himself with research; research that might come in handy if he was to accept Shacklebolt's and Robard's offer for him to become an Auror.
Shaking his head, smirking slightly, Harry muttered, "Touché."
A mischievous glint flashed through Draco’s eyes as he tightened his grip on Harry. “You,” he mumbled, his face only inches away from Harry’s, “will find out in a bit.” And with those words, he took a few steps backwards out of Harry’s embrace.
"Harry, come on! Wake up, you prat!"
A sad smile ghosted the Founder's face, the lion nuzzling his hand with its nose. "Yes... yes, I did. You could even say we were enemies, rivals at first..." He shook his head thoughtfully.
"We can organise try-outs", he eventually managed to say.
Laughing again, Harry took Draco by the hand and led them to the fireplace too, taking a handful of Floopowder. “Ladies first”, he smiled, gesturing graciously in the direction of the hearth.
After their trial Draco had wanted to thank Potter, but the boy had seemed to have disappeared in thin air. And it wasn't long after that, that the headlines of almost every paper in Wizarding Britain spoke about the same topic: Harry Potter vanishing from the face of the earth.
It was with a heavy heart that Harry turned away from the blond and slowly started making his way towards the castle, ignoring the tears that were now streaming freely down his flushed cheeks. And he definitely ignored the image of the disappointment and sadness and
She leaned closer to him and laid her head on his shoulder; just like she had done many times before over the summer. "Have you used the journal I've given you yet?"
His fingers closed around the tiny ball, his hand held high above his head as he smiled at his victory. He had caught the Snitch!
George stepped forward; his face seemed emotionless, though Harry could see the grief and the betrayal in his eyes. "Ron's right", he said as he met Harry's gaze, the intensity sending shivers down Harry's spine, "You should go."
"Now, I'm sure you will all be tired from the long day. Have a good evening and I will see you all tomorrow in class." And with those words the Headmistress walked out of the room, her emerald robes billowing behind her in a way Snape would be proud of.
Harry awoke with a start.
And as always, my
“Yes, well”, Draco continued happily, “the bad news
Draco, however, had been intrigued by the younger girl and when they were walking through the gardens of the manor later that afternoon, it hadn't taken them long to strike up an easy and comfortable conversation.
This is Draco Malfoy we’re talking about, the king of crazy costumes.
“Okay, but
And of course she had tried to help him.
Shaking his head, Harry offered Ron his plate, the latter gratefully taking the piece of meat and starting to eat it, earning him a few disgusted glares from their friends around them.
Harry chuckled then, peeling Draco’s hands away from his face and leaning in to place a soft kiss on his lips. “If it helps you at all,” he whispered, “I would gladly marry you.”
"Let him be, Ron", Hermione sighed. "Maybe you should take a leaf out of his book for a change, hm?"
A trembling voice broke the silence of the corridors. Harry jumped at the sudden sound, his heart beating wildly in his chest and his wand raised, ready to attack anyone who dared to cross his path.
"Who deserves some happiness?" a light, familiar voice asked from Draco's right.
Chuckling softly, Harry ran a hand through his hair. “You took the words out of my mouth.”
Not to mention all the utter rubbish the Daily Prophet published about him every day. From rumours about his love life - because apparently he had a love life
He wished the students would stop spying on him or watching his every move in order to sell the information to that damned newspaper. Even McGonagall's warning a few days prior clearly hadn't done anything - if the newspaper issue from that morning was anything to go by.
This was all his fault. He was responsible for this; just like he was responsible for all the others too.
All gone.
Harry raised an eyebrow as Ron's face reddened dangerously, his eyes narrowing and a finger pointing to the Slytherin. "Listen here you b-"
The blond turned his head and was greeted by the soft, chocolate curls of Astoria Greengrass, a beautiful smile lighting up her doll-like face.
Squeezing the other boy's hands again, Draco nodded. "Now, name four things you can touch."
Harry laughed again, something he should do more often. Everything seemed much brighter when he laughed. Most of the times though, he didn't really have a reason to laugh. The only reason Harry was laughing now was... well Draco, actually.
Harry thought as he positioned his body even further to the front of his broom, the action causing him to wobble slightly. It was a risky move - if the gasps he heard from the students in the stands below were anything to go by - but he managed to pull it off easy enough.
Draco was talking to and smiling at.
Apparently, those words were all it took for Draco to tip over the edge. His frantic movements came to an abrupt stop as he cried out, Harry’s name repeatedly falling from his lips as he buried his face in Harry’s neck.
It was at times like this he truly despised his fame. After disappearing off the radar for the whole summer, he had hoped the excitement about him defeating the Dark Lord would have calmed down a little. However, as he leaned against the wall of the train corridor with a heavy sigh, he couldn't have been more wrong.
And every 19 years,
managed to speak for more than five minutes over the last week was in the Great Hall at a few mealtimes. But even then, Ron and Hermione had left the room before all the others had, claiming they still had a lot to do.
Ron nodded, smiling as the common room exploded in loud, enthusiastic chatter and laughter.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed when he saw Draco standing in his living room. He quickly dropped the spoon on the counter, his cheeks flushing. “Draco… I uhm… I didn’t expect you to be so early.”
But Draco didn’t wait for his father to react. By the time he could faintly hear the low buzz of his father’s voice, he had already left the room.
“Right”, Draco said, nodding his head, “So if you’re too scared, Teddy, we can always watch a film on the tell… uhm… tell-a-vishion.”
Ron eyed Harry suspiciously as the latter walked to the bathroom to search for some Pain Relief potion. He was pretty sure he had restocked his bottles somewhere near the beginning of the school year.
"Oh, you poor thing." Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to his sketch, smiling softly as he started to recognise the scene he'd chosen to draw.
I know it's taken me forever :( and I hope it won't take me as long to post the next chapter. I've discovered I'm an extremely slow writer and my best friend had to push me A LOT to actually keep writing. I really want to finish this story so I can start on a new one cuz my head's been bursting with ideas!!
Rowena nodded thoughtfully before opening the book she was holding in her hand, casting a spell to make it float in front of her.
looking fiancé to everyone else? Go take a look for yourself.” He gestured towards the mirror on the wall next to the front door.
, Draco had said quickly, taking a drag from a freshly lit cigarette,
The door to their dorm opened loudly, the sound of a now vaguely familiar melody Draco always seemed to be humming under his breath, filling the room.
At that, Harry had looked away, an embarrassed blush creeping up his neck.
"Did you...", Harry trailed off, uncertain if he should even ask.
let it come this far, thank you very much - were strewn all across the shelves and hangers.
"Are you okay?", he asked quietly, taking another step closer, so he was standing right in front of Harry. He squeezed their hands momentarily.
was very addictive. So, that's why he had promised not only himself, but also his two best friends he would cut back on the consumption of the drug-like potion. Hermione had even offered to take away his stash so she could hide it from him, but Harry had politely declined, claiming he could manage on his own, thank you very much.
Draco tightened his grip on the handle of his trunk. “I think he’s had enough time to get used to the idea of me being…”
Draco must have thought the same as he squeezed Harry’s hand in silent comfort and pressed a light kiss on Harry’s shirt-clad shoulder.
Crossing the room to the front door, Harry stopped in front of the mirror and looked at his reflection. What he saw though, had his mouth falling open. Draco was right; he looked
Harry had given him a questioning look when he had put up the full-body-length mirror one evening, a few years back. “At least then I know how good I look whenever I exit the house”, Draco had said defensively, daring Harry to say anything else.
He deserved that, he knew that. In fact, he deserved far worse than only a slap to the cheek.
First, Draco had to pay way more rent for what the apartment was actually worth. When Harry had first stepped inside, he had been surprised to find Draco Malfoy living in such a small and filthy flat. The ceilings were cracking and leaking water in different places, the wallpaper had started peeling from the walls and Harry was sure he had seen a few patches of
He could see Draco blushing even harder, a small yet genuine smile lighting up his face. "Thanks", he said. "I would say the same for you, but I haven't actually seen you play."
and stay updated for future uploads and even other works!
Harry nodded his head, though he couldn’t – for the love of every witch and wizard dead or alive – figure out what their costumes were supposed to be.
His breath stopped for a moment when he read the other name.
Hannah chuckled, placing a delicate hand on his shoulder. "It's alright, Nev", she said. "You'll understand eventually."
The mayor greeted him on the rocky shore, her eyes soft and apologetic. Harry had always been rather fond of her.
Draco was still standing on the balcony, his silvery blond hair gleaming in the light of the street below. He was staring at Harry, a look in his eyes that hadn’t been there in months. His hands were clasped in front of him, though Harry thought he could see them shaking slightly.
The grip on his robes suddenly loosened as the heavy - now unconscious - weight of his attacker slumped against his body, causing Draco's legs to give out underneath him. He slid down the wall, curling up as small as he could as he clutched his head between his knees, trying to get his breathing under control by focusing on the sounds of his surroundings.
But then everything had gone downhill with the start of the Second Wizarding War and Voldemort practically living at Malfoy Manor.
After many cold and wet months, August had been unusually hot in England. The once green grass had turned a dry yellow, the leaves on the trees were shrivelling up underneath the hot rays of sunshine and even the birds seemed to have lost their will to fill the air with their cheerful chirps.
Ron huffed. "If you weren't in my way, Malfoy, I wouldn't have bumped into you."
The only thing he cared about was sleeping. A few minutes couldn't hurt, right?
Raising a dark eyebrow, Harry eyed the trunk in one of Draco’s hands. “What happened?” he asked, confusion lacing his words. “Are you leaving?”
Ginny threw a pebble into the water before she turned to face him again, her eyebrows furrowed. "You know you can talk to us, right?" she asked carefully.
“Mhm”, Harry turned to place his empty glass on the small table, “let’s go for that walk then.”
"Well yes, eventually, but-"
The sound of the door opening caused Harry to break free from his thoughts. Footsteps were walking around the room and he could just see the top of blond hair out of the corner of his half-closed eyes. The quiet humming of an unfamiliar song filled the silence.
Malfoy shrugged as he put a worn and old-looking book in his satchel. "I always have some emergency potions for when the need would arise. You know, just in case."
"I'm..."
There - right in front of him - stood the Weasleys in a half-circle, surrounding the unmoving body of none other than Fred Weasley.
Go check out my
Go check out my
He was exhausted.
So what if something had happened now?
When the war had ended and Lucius had been taken to Azkaban, the Greengrass family had happily broken off the contract, claiming they didn't want one of their daughters married to a Death Eater.
And with the cry of Andromeda’s Floo-address he disappeared into a whirl of green flames.
"Oh, come off it, Ron", Hermione exclaimed, taking one of Ron's hands in hers and dragging the loudly protesting boy with her towards the castle. She turned around and smiled knowingly at Harry before saying, "We'll see you in the common room, Harry!"
oh, I don’t know how to say this.”
"Draco can try for Chaser, if he's still allowed to", an unfamiliar voice called from behind the group.
"I have no idea what's going on", Neville muttered, shaking his head at the group. He had been half-following the conversation whilst explaining to Hannah what the pros and cons were of Devil's Snare. Still, he had no idea what to make of what just happened. More than anything, it left him more confused than before.
and disappearing in a whirl of green flames.
and just. Leave. Him. Alone.
At the lack of reaction he got out of the older boy, Gage clenched his fists, gritting his teeth. Yet he continued, not showing anything of his growing irritation to his friends, his sneer still in place.
be the one to hex them?"
Before he could do so much as blink, however, Ginny had walked over to him, one of her hands colliding rather harshly with his cheek. A stinging feeling started spreading across one side of his face as Harry took a few steps back, bewilderment clear on his face.
As the group started making their way back up to the castle for lunch, Harry managed to grab a hold of Draco's sleeve, pulling him back. "Can I talk to you for a moment?" he asked Draco whom had turned around, a questioning eyebrow raised.
"You should tell him what happened", she simply said and Draco knew from the tone in her voice that there was no room for debate. He would have to tell Healer Glover about what happened. It was the only way the man would be able to help him and he knew that.
Harry stopped walking, lifting his wand as if to attack the first person or thing that jumped around the corner.
and stay updated for future uploads and even other works!
Had Malfoy just smiled at him? Clearly he must have mistaken his smile for a sneer, right? There was no way in hell
A mischievous smirk had found its way onto Harry’s face as he took the crown and stepped into the green flames. After all, he wouldn’t miss the chance to tell everyone how his fiancé had almost forgotten his beautiful
The portrait of the common room suddenly opened and in stepped a grinning Ronald Weasley. His hair was a mess as if he had been running his hand through it multiple times and his cheeks were slightly more pink, making the freckles on top look like tiny, dark ink stains.
"So tell me, Harry," Luna said after a while, "what's bothering you?"
Pressing a hand against her mouth, Hermione marked the page where she had stopped reading and pushed Ron away gently, mouthing the word '
Running a frustrated hand through his raven locks, Harry turned to look at his best friend, raising one of his eyebrows. "I think I can decide that for myself, thank you very much", he said curtly. He
And that left Harry feeling alone more times than he dared to admit. He had never known how much he actually depended on his two best friends, until now.
Harry shook his head again. Even his favourite dessert didn't look as appetising as it used to. "No thanks, Hermione. I'm all good."
The ginger held up his hand, interrupting Harry once again. "Save it, Harry", he spat, "I don't want to hear any excuses from you anymore. Leave."
Harry closed his eyes momentarily, taking a deep breath to try and stop his hands from shaking.
, dammit – much like the one Harry was wearing. Only this one wasn’t gold with yellow, orange and red gemstones. This one was silver with white, dark blue and black gems. It shimmered in the low lighting of the room.
He had packed his bags at the Burrow where he had been staying at that moment and had said goodbye to the Weasley family - with the promise of writing at least once a week, of course. Molly had embraced him tightly with teary eyes before he'd said his last goodbye and had Apparated to 12 Grimmauld Place.
being dramatic."
Too close! They were standing too close!
People seemed to be getting more creative over time.
"How did you know where I was?" Harry asked surprised. He hadn't expected Ginny to be the first one to find him. Knowing Hermione, he had expected her to be first.
But it had felt real; the sounds of people screaming, the feeling of the cold air on his skin, the smell of destruction and
Gasping offendedly, Draco placed a hand dramatically over his heart. "Potter! You wound me!"
As Harry opened the front door of the small countryside cottage, a large splash of rain fell inside, the wind blowing a few photographs from the wall onto the floor. With a low grunt and a lot of pushing Harry managed to close the door, leaning his back heavily against it. He ran a tired hand through his soaking wet hair.
Harry turned around, a wooden spoon in his hand serving as an imaginary microphone.
before he had walked to his room.
Sighing again, Ginny let her head fall onto her bent knees. "I'm not going to fight with you over this", she said defeated, her voice sounding muffled through the fabric of her dark jeans. "But I really want you to consider this, Harry. It might
He had to get out of here, but he couldn't. They blocked every exit, their bodies pressed tightly together.
The girl had never done anything wrong to him. He didn't even know of her existence until a few weeks ago when he had first seen her on the Quidditch pitch.
"Harry?" Hermione's worried voice drifted through the low buzz of voices in the Great Hall, her big, brown eyes eyeing him thoroughly from the other side of the table. "Are you alright?"
George emerged from between his brothers, stepping towards Harry. "Ron is right." His voice sounded hoarse as he met Harry's gaze, a haunted look clearly visible through all the grief in his eyes. "You should go."
But he was wrong; so horribly wrong.
Had Draco been crying?
Turning his head, Harry glared half-heartedly at the Slytherin's back. "Thanks", he muttered, "I hadn't noticed yet."
It wouldn't take long for the rumours to start, Draco knew that. His already tainted reputation would only get worse. The whole bloody school would know about his pathetic 'episode' by dinner. It was only a matter of days for the word to spread outside the castle walls too.
It hadn’t been his idea to go live on the countryside, surrounded by nothing but fields and hills, away from all the hustle and bustle of London, though he couldn’t say he regretted it one bit. Draco had been the one to suggest the idea three years ago.
will take you away from us. You are safe here.”
A smirk of his own appeared on Draco's face as he leaned even closer. "You would like that, wouldn't you?" he whispered, his teeth nibbling at his bottom lip. His eyes flickered to Harry's lips for a second before returning to stare into Harry's green gaze.
Nobody else but Blaise, Mandy and Neville had tried for Chaser.
Draco, on the other hand, had flushed a deep scarlet, the tips of his ears burning as he shot Pansy another glare, her shoulders shaking with mirth.
“Please… never leave my side. I… I don’t want to be alone anymore.”
A small, curvy woman clad in a long, yellow dress entered the portrait, a bright smile lighting up her round face. "You only say such nonsense because you are a sore loser." She chuckled as she turned towards Draco, her honey-brown eyes sparkling as she leaned closer, shielding her mouth with one hand and whispering, "He never got over it, as you can see."
"You two would look lovely together", Luna commented out of the blue.
Draco had been delighted when Harry told him, rambling on and on about a cosy apartment he had found in a small village. He had wanted to move as soon as possible.
Harry laughed at the small boy. “Of course we are, Pup”, he chuckled, “What else did you expect from Draco?”
It wasn’t perfect, but it was theirs and Harry absolutely adored it.
He had stopped hanging out with the three of them as much as they used to do so many times before. Instead, he had withdrawn more and more into himself, locking himself away from his best friends.
Mrs. Weasley was sitting on the ground, cradling the head of her lost son in her lap as tears streamed freely down her face. Her loud sobs filled the quiet of the night.
Harry had straightened again, taking a small sip of his wine to clear his throat.
Draco took a step back and patted the clasp once before turning back to the box and taking something out that looked suspiciously like a tiara…
Though, he had to admit the cheers of the students sounded an awfully lot like the cries from his 'vision' - if you could even call it that; an episode perhaps?
Maybe, just maybe, they could have a normal year for once...
Nodding his head, Harry turned around and slowly made his way down the corridor from where he came, lingering for a moment in the hope they would call him back and tell him it was all a joke; a joke the Weasley twins had come up with.
I feel like this chapter is all over the place... (¬_¬)
Their heads hung low, their shoulders slumped underneath the weight of their grief and grim expressions decorating their freckled faces. They were standing in a half-circle. In the middle lay a body, unmoving.
Harry could feel their forgiveness washing over him as they stood there, swaying gently to the rhythm of the moving train. They were all reunited again, the Golden Trio was whole again.
Draco lifted his head to look Harry in the eyes. From this close Harry could clearly see all the different emotions swirling around in the deep, silver depths that were Draco’s eyes. That was the thing he loved most about Draco. He could be as cold as ice to some people, but whenever he let his guard down his eyes were almost as expressive as Harry’s own. Sometimes they didn’t even have to speak with words to understand each other. Sometimes a look said more than a thousand words.
They really didn't want him anymore. The people he had started seeing as his own family didn't want him anymore.
Soon after, an unknown tawny owl had started pecking harshly at one of the windows, its huge eyes peering at him through the half-closed curtain.
But all in all, their home was truly perfect, an exact representation of their relationship. In every room, you could find at least two soft, warm rugs – very handy if they didn’t manage to make it to the bedroom in time. The floor to ceiling windows were decorated with heavy curtains in all different kinds of colours – because even after a week’s long argument they still hadn’t been able to come to an agreement to which colour of fabric would go best with the rest of the house. Every corner was filled with different kinds of plants and photos – both Wizard
"What?" Harry said, shooting a glare in Hermione's direction. "I'm
He absolutely didn't feel like going to classes today. The only thing he felt like doing was sleeping, but he knew it wasn't a smart option. It would only make him feel even worse.
The other students of Hogwarts, however - mostly the younger years - didn't seem to have the same mindset. They would squeal or giggle whenever he looked in their direction, doing everything they could to get his attention. Some even swarmed him, asking for autographs or pictures or they kept thanking him for saving one of their relatives Harry didn't even know had fought in the war too.
McGonagall had been furious when she had heard the story.
"Well then", Ginny said, "would you mind, Harry, if I stole Luna away for a while?" She looked at him, pleading, brown eyes staring back into his own green ones.
Now turning back to look at the other boy, Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course, you would say that", he said, placing his hands on the edge of Harry's desk and leaning closer. His warm, minty breath ghosted over Harry's face as he spoke, "That's why I'm not asking you to come. You're coming with me, willing or not."
He had tried napping during class - of course - but both his teachers and Hermione had prevented him from continuing that. Hermione had even threatened she would refuse to let him borrow her notes from classes if he kept wasting away his time in class by napping.
"How are we going to determine who gets which position on the team, though?" Hannah asked from her place on the ground next to Neville. Harry noticed they were sitting closer than before.
It wouldn't take much for Harry to just lean in and close the small gap between their mouths, connecting their lips. Draco's lips looked so inviting: warm and rosy...
As a very annoying hand kept poking the side of his head, Harry didn't see another option but to wake up from his for once relatively peaceful sleep. Still half-asleep, he managed to sit up in his chair, the annoying hand still poking the side of his head. "What...", he grumbled.
Harry took a deep breath, his blood rapidly rushing southwards when Draco ground against him again. His own leather trousers were becoming unpleasantly tight. “Then why don’t you”, Harry asked hoarsely, moving his own hips to meet Draco’s lazy movements.
“The moon and the sun.” Draco’s soft and raspy voice broke the tender silence.
But no story could ever describe anything as breathtakingly
Harry knew it was time. When he had awoken that morning, he had known.
Blaise raised an eyebrow at his friend.
He had smiled at the girl when she had given it to him, thanking her politely, though he had known he wouldn't do much with it. Really, he wasn't planning on keeping some sort of diary. He was sure - after all that had happened - he had grown out of that stage.
“Bloody, fucking hell!” Draco exclaimed loudly, throwing his hands in the air before letting his head fall into his hands. “I can’t actually believe myself! Could this get any worse?!”
Different kinds of affirmative answers could be heard around the room.
"Oh, uhm..." A sheepish smile appeared on his face as he scratched the back of his neck. "Well, as much as I would be honoured to be our captain, I don't think I'm the right person to do that right now."
"It's a nice combination, isn't it?", the voice of Rowena Ravenclaw echoed through the room.
enjoyed or learning how to ride a broom with his father chasing after him and yelling at him to come down because
Shrugging, Luna finally averted her gaze from the fire to look at Harry. An amused twinkle was visible in her dreamy, blue eyes as she lifted her hand and pushed against Harry's chin to close his mouth again. "You're going to catch Wrackspurts."
Teddy looked away, mumbling something they couldn’t quite hear.
He felt absolutely drained to the bones. It had been quite a long time - a little over a month - since he's had a full blown panic attack like this. Yes, he's had a few moments where he's had to use his many grounding techniques for the most stupid things like him not finding a matching pair of socks or a staircase moving when he was already halfway to the top. But he had always been able to shake it off.
Draco had been in a sour mood for most of the day, scowling at anybody who had tried talking to him. And by looking at his reaction now, Blaise realised it might have something to do with the Golden Boy.
This year, however… there was nothing crazy or complex about the costume. The only things Harry had found in the bathroom was a pair of black skinny jeans with a golden belt and a loose and rather transparent maroon shirt.
Taking a step in the direction he had come from, Harry shook Ron's hand from his shoulder, retrieving his wand from the ground. "I'm sorry", he whispered, his voice wavering slightly. "I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I really wish things could've ended better."
It had started as a battle of tongues and lips, the passion between the two growing stronger until they could barely stand it anymore.
Harry was holding him close, rocking them back and forth as Draco sobbed into his chest.
Raising one elegant eyebrow, Draco continued, “It’s a crown.”
"What are you doing, mate?", Ron asked, his gaze never leaving Draco, who was standing rather close to Harry - perhaps a little too close. "Aren't you coming?"
curfew for you -" different sounds of excitement rang through the now empty Great Hall "-
“One of you… you mean…?”
Harry sniggered as Ron mumbled an apology, intertwining his fingers with his girlfriend's.
Harry shook his head. Surely he must have misheard his best friend? They were
After the plate was completely empty, Hermione had taken his essay and had read over what he had already written - not that there was much to be proud of. However, she had helpfully corrected any spelling mistakes and had made some notes in the margin for things he could add or things that weren't completely right.
I've written this chapter a while ago. it's not one of the best tbh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Even though they had never officially announced it, it was still as clear as day Ginny and Luna were together. You would have to be blind not to see the way the two of them looked at each other sometimes; it wasn't like they were hiding it anyways.
Despite his reaction earlier that evening at Harry's close proximity, Draco now found himself to actually enjoy it. He relished in the warmth of Harry's body and how perfectly it fitted against his own.
Harry noticed that he - like Blaise - was smoking a cigarette as he listened to whatever the girl was saying. He smiled fondly every now and again or added something to the story and Harry suddenly found himself wishing it were
“Oh…”
The Weasleys didn't want him anymore. The people he had considered as family hated him. The friends he had fought a war with, friends who had seen him at his worst and even then refused to leave his side... gone.
She looked each and every Eighth Year in the eye before continuing, "Seeing as technically you do not belong to your original houses anymore, I have made some arrangements in which you will have your own house, namely the Eighth Year House. You can still lose or gain house points and also have a chance at winning the House Cup if you so please."
He didn't think he was ready to tell another person yet.
Feeling the blush creep up his cheeks at being caught staring, Harry quickly averted his eyes. Instead he opted for checking out the room.
He nodded again.
An unamused, pale eyebrow was raised at that question.
Again, Potter nodded, his unfocused gaze never leaving Draco's. The panic was still very apparent in the depths of his green eyes, his breathing never slowing down and his hands still shaking violently.
When Harry pulled back eventually, he was smiling broadly. “How about that walk now?” he asked. “A little midnight walk with your fiancé.”
His cold eyes roaming Draco up and down, Salazar sniffed disdainfully, his lips once again curling into a sneer. "Ah yes", he drawled lazily, lifting his chin. "Quidditch... I do not understand why people keep playing such a game. It seems a tad... barbaric, if you ask me."
Never once breaking eye contact with the boy in front of him, Harry nodded slowly.
The chatter and laughter had quietened relatively quickly as they were all awaiting Harry's answer.
“He doesn’t want to come from under his covers again”, Draco sighed, a sad smile dancing around his lips. “Says the Thunder Gods will kidnap him and drag him away from us.”
However, he hadn't told
Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, had been put on house arrest in their manor in France. It was one of the reasons why Draco had chosen to go to France after Hogwarts and not some other country. That and his ability to speak fluent French, courtesy of his pureblood upbringing.
A forced smile curled at the end of Harry's lips. "Of course 'Mione", he said. "I'm fine. No need to worry about me."
Luna nodded her head. "I noticed more Wrackspurts flying around your head earlier." She tapped the pair of glasses in her hair. "Perhaps it has something to do with Draco Malfoy?"
He hated to admit it, but - despite the pain and the headaches he had to endure when he awoke - he was getting quite addicted to the potion, depending on it more often than he would like.
Draco nodded. “I’m the moon and you’re the sun.”
His breathing had quickened, his heart pounding in his chest as his throat closed up, unwanted tears building up behind his eyes.
The thought of falling off his broom was pushed far away to the back of his mind as his hand reached out again, the tips of his fingers finally touching the cold, metal ball...
Harry couldn't quite decipher what they were reading about. He never had been good at reading upside-down anyways.
Draco had blurted it out, apropos of nothing, just at the moment Harry had taken a sip from his wine.
Hermione looked at him, her arms crossed over her chest. "But I've barely seen you eat anything tonight!" she exclaimed, concern filling the depths of her brown eyes.
now too. I post little ideas I get in my mind or some microfics. I'm always open for suggestions or asks either, so don't hesitate to come say hi :)
building being constructed next door! Honestly!” He flailed his arms around wildly while he talked, a few strands of his messy, shoulder-length, blond hair falling in front of his eyes. “Not to mention the bloody neighbours! Haven’t Muggles ever heard of being more discrete whilst having sex? It’s not like the whole building has to bloody hear them!”
Harry looked around him. Most eyes were directed towards him. "I'm sorry, what?" he asked, his cheeks flushing slightly again at all the attention he was getting. They had probably asked him something important whilst he had been too busy staring at Draco bloody Malfoy... again.
"Please try not to lose it this time", he continued. "I'm not going to keep letting you borrow mine otherwise."
Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that his parents were taken away from him on this particular day. That also meant many other things were taken away from him, such as his chance at having a happy family who truly loved him for who he was - not one that was forced to take him in and practically treated him like their personal slave just because he was different.
The sound caught the attention of the Slytherin, his head snapping towards the door, those sparkling, silver eyes landing on Harry who awkwardly stood there, his fingers fiddling with the end of his jumper sleeve.
Draco stared at Harry, a muscle in his jaw twitching and then…
“I’m not done quite yet”, he smiled. “As I was saying, you make me feel powerful, Harry. Whenever you’re by my side, I feel like I can take on the whole world. So that’s why…”, Draco fumbled for something in one of his trouser pockets, “that’s why… hold on a moment, I can’t find what I’m looking for.”
for the ocean to just wash it away.”
In the second year of their now far less fragile relationship, Draco had thrown all caution to the wind, however. He had stormed into Harry’s depressingly dark flat – not even bothering to knock – had thrown a set of clothes he thought would fit his boyfriend at him and had forced the sulking, young man into the bathroom, ordering him to put on the costume and bloody get over it.
At that, Potter huffed a laugh and looked at him again, “Spent literally an entire year noticing when you were somewhere unexpected, Malfoy. Old habits die hard.”
“I didn't ask you, Hermoine! I really don't care what mental leap you used.” She stalked up to Ron, poking him in the middle of his chest. “Tell me why! Did you just go along with it because Harry wanted it? Because Hermione thought it was a good idea?”
“Well this is a reminder of why I don't go out at all, isn't it? Can't step foot in Diagon Alley without being accosted by a member of the Golden Trio? Do they just pay you lot to prowl around, staring at the people all day?” Draco ground out, turning to Potter, arms crossed over his chest.
“Thank you for your time,” Potter said, turning again to Draco. “Malfoy, find me after.”
So, he had waited. He probably wanted the press attention for being such a bleeding heart.
Every sound the house made startled him.
Malfoy watched him go, furious at himself for letting Potter make him feel like a kid back at school, letting him get under his skin again. Like he always had.
“Draco could have done a lot of things during the war. He didn't. He did just enough to keep his family as safe as he could.” With this, Potter turns, arms out, palms up. “I believe it's time for us, all of us to heal. Voldemort is gone. I ask that you not try to punish those left in the rubble. Voldemort isn't left to punish, I understand. No examples need to be made out of children.”
“I, ah, so, the allegiance of the wand switched when I took it from you.”
Sighing, he heaved upright, slinging on his robes as he walked around his bed. Coming down the stairs, he heard voices in the kitchen.
Ginny was standing in the doorway with her arms crossed. Harry's throat hitched a little. She looked pale, tired. He hadn't seen her since the battle, couldn't bring himself to come to the Burrow and face all the Weasely's yet. He knew he should have been here sooner,  but he hadn't been ready to face any of them, let alone Ginny. He didn't want to think about the questions he'd see in her eyes, he didn't have any answers for her, didn't have any for himself even.
This chapters title comes from Help by Papa Roach. Very on the nose, but can't be too deep with every title.
Ginny stepped even closer to Harry, fighting mad. “Who the hell are you to decide that Malfoy get's to go free? What the fuck Harry! You hate him! He hates you! Him and his shitty family aren't worth help from you!”
Harry took a step backwards with his eyes locked on the crack, darting up to Ron, then Hermione. “Did I? I don't..” He couldn't finish, he needed to get out of there. He spun and walked to the Floo, calling out Number 12, and was gone.
Then he was gone, leaving Draco behind to figure out the labyrinth that was the Ministry.
“Gin, things happened before the Battle that the Wizengamot needs to know about. That's it, that's all I can tell you.” Harry told her.
When the owl came, later that day, informing him that part of his sentence was to return to Hogwarts for the Eighth Year, he wanted to laugh.
After that, they were suddenly surrounded. Ron and Hermione had closed in on both sides of him, and rushed to the Floos. Harry had tried to block out the shouts and questions, trying to keep his feet under him as the crush had pressed in from all angles.
I told you I might post the second chapter yet tonight. Here we go.
He didn't have a job. Didn't much need one, in all honesty. However, no job meant no reason to leave the Manor. No reason to leave the Manor meant being subjected to his Mother whenever she deemed fit. Or not being subjected to her for days on end. It meant realizing that his mother hadn't been leaving her rooms very much at all. It meant realizing that Draco himself hadn't either.
Potter snapped his fingers softly, Shacklebolt turning from him in the same moment. He stood before Draco, eyebrows raised. What did he-?
Is his mother safe? Has she already had her trial? What had they decided would be her fate? Thinking of his mother almost brings the tears that have permanently settled right behind his eyes out. Draco sharply forces his mind to pivot at a turn from his mother and the worry for her. Bring the anger, think about Father. He lifts his head and forces his eyes up to the platform to Kingsley Shacklebolt. Once again trying to focus on what he's saying. The volume in the room, deathly silent except for the murmurs of outrage when he had answered, truthfully, the various questions the Examining Board had had for him, has risen, is rising. Had they already told him-?
“I suppose here is where you're expecting a sobbing thank you, Potter?” Raising one carefully practiced eyebrow, letting Potter know exactly how long he'd be waiting for that.
That's chapter 2, actually the catalyst for most of this fic. I love the idea of Harry testifying for Draco, but notice that most fics just reference it happening, don't actually show it. That's because it's bloody hard to write. Here's my shot at it. Cliffhangers give me life.
His eyebrows raising, Potter shifted from a foot to the other, looking in that moment like he wished he could be anywhere else but here. Draco supposed he did.
He was a Malfoy, however, so all he said was, “Thank you for returning it, Potter.”
“Get your hands off me, you pillock.”
“Kingsley, may I?”
This time, Potter did laugh. “You were, you absolute bellend!”
I really like them, tho, so I'm going to do it. Hopefully in the next few days.
He didn't, but he could have. No one would have blamed him.
Draco knew he had to get a new wand if he had any hope of taking his exams. There really was little hope he would pass any of them without a tutor but he was going to try. He would just order all the books he needed, and teach himself. How hard could it really be?
"Today has been long, hasn't it?" Here, he pauses, scanning the crowd. "Today, this week, the last year.  Long, too long.  I'm tired. Draco, I'm sure, is tired."
Potter was sitting off to the right of the desk that took up most of room, on an awkward little couch... thing. Draco could tell this office had been whipped together, possibly in the dark, by people who had a very loose grasp of what color even was.
Something inside Harry, the honestly shocking calm that had been so hard won, snapped. He threw his arms out in frustration “I'm absolutely NO ONE to decide anything Gin, you fucking know that!” Harry took a step forward, forcing Ginny to move back, give him some room. “I'm just sick of death! I'm sick of it! I want it to stop. That's it.” There had been a noise to his right, he ignored it. Harry was breathing hard at this point, Ginny had gone white.
“Justa minute! Getting my robes!” Harry called, leaping up from the bed. He had been getting his robes, decided that he wasn't ready, and as such had decided to lay down on the bed and stare out at the street as it woke up for the day.
“Mate, why do you only have one bowl in here?” Ron was staring into the cabinet sadly, holding two spoons in his hand.
“Another bowl broke? What in the world?” Hermoine looked at Harry as Ron slid the remaining bowl over to her.
That being said, it's been wild to begin writing this, having never done it before. Thanks for reading, please tell me what you thought!
Realizing he had totally lost the plot, the trial and the time before definitely getting to him, he decided to focus, looking away from The Boy Who Fights Cheese Graters, who was speaking to Shacklebolt in low tones while Draco hovered in the doorway. He focused on the desk beyond them, trying to pick up what they were saying. They were so close, but he couldn't make a word out, everything was fuzzy.
Well well well, we've had a touch of a time jump, haven't we? What did happen after the Burrow? *I* know, I'll tell you eventually!
Hermione looked at him, twisting her hands together a little before sitting in one of the overstuffed chairs.
“It's, well, Malfoy, your wand.” He held it out to Draco, point facing back at himself, and Draco's mind supplied him with the fact that the Boy Who Lived was either very stupid, or so very sure that Draco could never do anything so bold as to hex him the second he got his wand.
