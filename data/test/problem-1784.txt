.” The Gryffindor released a rumble of words down at me, his burning gaze peering down at me with heavy lids that made him look so damn sexual, lips tipping up to reveal a daunting vicious grin that made me whine at the sight of him, my cock pulsing faster with each fucked out thrust of Harry’s dick drilling into me.
“I decided to visit one of my favorite people in the world.” Harry’s voice sounded out low yet powerful in the noise of the music and people’s chatter surrounding us, my gut dipping sickeningly with dread and anger and
And Harry’s answer made sense. The Gryffindor had to go and help one of his best friends and Sirius was almost as powerful as Harry in the magic department so the assassin could trust his godfather to keep me safe.
Pressing the tip of my nose into Harry’s neck, I let myself breathe in his cigar and rain scent, bathing myself in his warmth and feeling his chest shift beneath me the the slightest before falling into a normal, relaxed rhythm, the tense line of his hard body seeming to laze back now. The stilted air that surrounded us disappearing in a slow withdrawal.
But I couldn't budge much of my limbs away from Harry’s body pressing over mine and his teeth clamping into me.
“Fuck, that’s better.” I voiced my own thoughts throughout the quiet of the living room, tone shaking in my breathy rasp.
On instinct, I pushed my back flat against Harry’s front, snuggling myself up against him and unconsciously wiggling my arse back so I could practically help Harry melt into me, my heart hammering widely against my chest as we both sped down the deserted road, passing tree by decaying tree with the cool air ruffling my skirt about and the engine becoming a thunderous murmur beneath me.
Sirius brought his hand up to curl his arm around the back of the brown haired boy’s torso and bring him closer into his side in an intimate gesture, his fingers drumming playfully along his boyfriend’s side enough to make the boy squirm in his grip. “When Bellatrix tried hitting me with Avada Kedavra, Harry had apparated my figure to the Forbidden Forest where he later found me and told me to hide out for the rest of the war. I didn’t have much say in the decision considering my godsdamn godson put a chained spell on me that made my essence attach itself to the vicinity of the forest. If I was to step foot out of the place, my skin would burn and my stomach would become nauseous to the point where I would throw up, so needless to say, Harry faked my death against my will. But I’m alive and I have to thank him for that.”
please!” My voice cracked, the stoicism I always carried around with me crumbling beneath Harry’s harsh demand that both excited and scared the holy hell out of me. I wanted to turn away now, hating that I had yelled out Harry’s name like I was his little pet to play with.
The blood seemed to have dried out in the pitch black tousled strands of Harry’s hair, some locks looking dried and clumped together in a disarray as if the Gryffindor had just come from a
The musky, male taste of the assassin’s finger invading the expanse of my tongue caused my jaw to slacken in unadulterated pleasure and my lashes to flutter open and close in a dizzying countenance, my lips parting wider to let my tongue lave out shyly and run the flat of it up Harry’s finger in a flick of a lap.
He kept tearing me apart with every acidic, gravelly word he drawled out from the distracting curve of his lips, his voice gnawing holes through my chest and leaving me gaping open for him to mock and peer into.
The pressure increased spontaneously in the dip of my spine, my grinding growing frenzied. Harry’s breath fanned over the hollow off my left cheek as he released his addicting, sinful mouth away from mine, eyes peering down at me to elicit a devoir keen up and out of my working throat.
Harry!” I spoke out my words in a shaking breath, my chest shuddering beneath my lax weight as I was being stripped of every coherent thought, hovering above any logical notions as I became just an object of sex.
I proceeded to then slam the sides of my curled fists against Harry’s chest, pounding my hands across his broad torso repeatedly as I pressed my trembling lips together to keep the angered, aching congested whines from escaping my mouth as I looked down at Harry's torso to keep myself from looking up in his eyes.
My hands, which had been left limp at my sides, procured a burst of energy and  immediately snapped up to slap the heat of my slick palms against the next steps flat ledge. I subconsciously let the tips of my fingers push against the surface as the rest of my frame went somewhat lax except for the occasional shudders rocking my body whole from Harry’s touch and body over my own.
Heat radiated from the body pressed against my back, slamming me further down onto the soft of my belly in my wet figure as I became a trapped specimen beneath the form crowding in on me like an all consuming force. Lips, soft and warm, slipped over the left of my earlobe, a heated breath falling over my gooseflesh there and making me let out a hesitant whimper as the low timbre of Harry’s voice mocked me in that cruel gruff tone of his. “Did you think you could run from me?”
I fiddled with the envelope in my hands, an awkward warmth falling over my being at the sight before me. The space of this level of the building was huge, high ceilings that carried neon purple lights strung up on black wirings that faded into the color of the dark building. On either side of the room were spiraling staircases, open and seen to the whole crowd as it led up to a wrap around balcony from the inside that shown VIP groups sitting around on lush, white furniture that glowed beneath the strobe lights, smoke flitting around the balconies to display the allowance of cigars and cigarettes above the dance floor.
I watched Granger click her heels towards Weasley, grin up at the man with an air of adoration and vibrating happiness, and tilt her head back to reach up and peck Weasley over the part of his lips with her own. “Hey babe. Neville wants to know if you’re up for drinks later tonight at the Leaky Cauldron? The kids wanted to visit with your mother and I thought we could have some relaxation later, just you, me, and our friends.”
Feeling the sickening source of the teleportation magic ease away from the slowly draining hum of my temples and the pit of my stomach, I blinked profusely as the soles of my heeled shoes sunk deep into the mass of clay like, carmel tinged sand.
Chang’s big boobs were flying every which way that did nothing to sway me from being my gay self, causing me to wrinkle my nose at seeing the swinging harsh movements of her large chest while the girl moaned and cried out too fucking much.
I turned around to watch Weasley come in after me and close the spell off, leaving both him and I in the penthouse suite.
I was just about to exclaim in aggravation with my failed attempt at getting the potion right on my first try but before I could, Harry suddenly let out a discomfited harsh grunt, causing my attention to come back immediately towards the man as I took in the state of him.
The emerald film of Harry’s eyes were almost completely taken over by the ruby, blood red hue that mingled together with it, seeming to pulsate as if his gaze was alive itself, intimidating and bearing down on me with a force that left me breathless.
The pit of my gut pinched with this sort of inferno of fire that licked me from the inside and out in a dizzying state of arousal, fear and utter confusion.
My eyes, widening further in their state of horror stricken fear and astonishment, caught sight of a nearby lamp that was attached to one of the walls but wasn’t lit up next to Harry’s head, manifest into a zest of shimmering explosive fire sparks and implode, the sound of a crackle and sizzle popping loud from beneath the sounds of thunder and lighting as well as the in between quiet the mansion provided while the energy I emitted from my wand with a hysteric wave scorched the lamp.
Zereth wanted me to kill as many people as it wanted me to until I was left unhinged with both my dark magic and others’ and more poweful.
I was both mad at myself for making Draco feel that way and at the Slytherin for doing something against my words and most likely putting himself in the position of getting into trouble.
Weasley stared down at me with a raise of his brows, the burnt orange hue of his eyes watching me glare up at his massive frame, the bulging muscles of his arms stretching over the black sweater he wore that complimented the russet red of his unruly hair.
The man’s pupils were blown wide, the black looking as if it was going to overshadow the red and green from how much Harry’s eyes were dilated.
And I couldn’t stop the familiar sensation of bile rising up the confines of my constricting throat, acidic in the back of my mouth and molars as a heaving sickness developed itself in the quivering of my gut.
He also always chuckled after giving away that comment and thought he was quite the comedian for it.
Hunching over to catch my heaving breaths, I glanced up to see Hezian standing in front of a glass desk, the bulk of his arms folded over his broad chest. Hezian’s frame was almost as tall as Harry’s, the dirty blonde of his hair perfectly styled in a wavy mess while he wore charcoal trousers and a fitted white  rolled up long sleeved button up shirt to reveal the tone of his muscled arms and the strength of his long legs. The eerie set of his cerulean eyes gazed down at my hunched form in that same calm confidence yet mischievous air he carried.
“Now that you are eating, ask away some questions then, Kitten.” Harry spoke to me from where he stood cooking away, his brilliant gaze sliding over to my figure as he gave me a dark raise of his eyebrows to usher me on.
And Harry damn well deserved to be around people that cared and was there for him through thick and thin. It was time for the Assassin to make amends with Hermione and Ron.
And I kept my own gaze fixated on Kikue, my heart pounding rapidly against my chest as I attempted to keep the calm of my anger and hurt from showing. If I looked at Harry right now, I was going to break down, especially with everything that happened tonight and not having a freak out session yet. With seeing another boy and Harry touch each other, I was going to bloody well
“Answer me, Princess.” The low tone of Harry’s voice shuddered into my frame, my breath stuttering out of my mouth as I whined with my head falling forward and the tendrils of my pale hair touching the granite floor beneath me, pressing the top of my head against the flat ledge of the stair I dug my fingers into above me.
Godsdamnit, I want to fuck my cum into this boy until he was drooling out my juices and dripping globs of my filth from his pretty, devastated boy pussy, to see it run down the inner slopes of his milky, spazzing thighs as he lay there,
I yelped as I felt Harry’s heated hand grasp my right wrist to tug me toward him in a rough yank only for him to step sideways as my body swayed forward, his frame coming up behind me and twisting my arm behind my back to unceremoniously shove me over the lab table behind the one I was working on.
left him with to show others that he is to not be messed with by anyone else. Use that dumb brain of yours to decipher the sort of magic I used. Don’t act stupid. Leave and stick your cock into someone who wants it.”
Zereth flung it’s body away from mine, growling out in rage and pain as they stumbled about on their feet.
“And if I don’t follow your o-orders?!” I called out to him, my breath fast and my hands subtly trying to cover up the arousal profound beneath my pants, watching the shifting muscles in Harry’s back strain against the loose fitted form of his shirt.
“Nonononono! Harry, you’re not supposed to kill him!” I yelled out at the Gryffindor, shaking as I looked at him with my features pinched in a grimacing affronted hurt.
The dull throb in the back of my head sliced a resolute shrilling pain straight through my skull to the space behind my eyes, the sensation feeling similar to when that dark creature had spoke to me earlier in Harry’s kitchen, though the voice sounded different this time.
I was truly only trying to protect my family, and Dumbledore had actually been one of the few people to actually care about me so I was just as devastated when he had died. I couldn't follow through with Voldemort’s order on killing the Headmaster and watched my godfather kill the one man that I thought of as a father. I had begged Severus to not go through with it, but he had to for his fear of keeping me alive.
” I hiccupped as I couldn’t help the flood of tears from escaping. I started to sob by the time I felt Harry grip me from underneath my upper arms to drag me bodily over to him as he plopped unceremoniously across the bed to lay beside me and drag me into his front so he could blanket me in his warmth.
I exhaled a breath at the same given time the tight furl of my fist was brought back in a snapping motion, the curl of my fingers jabbed beneath the right bone of a ribcage. The marrow cracked sickeningly beneath the amount of force I broke the cartilage back in a simple twitch of my wrist.
Why did Potter taste blood as if he's done it many times? That wasn't something a regular human being would do. And the Gryffindor didn't seem fazed at all by killing someone. How did Potter learn how to throw a dagger like
I felt the very center of my gut up heave violently as a nausea started to claw its way back up my working throat without much of a warning, my upper body bending forward to release deep breaths as I tried to calm my racing heart and the confusing emotions wrecking havoc within it.
But when I went to stare incredulously at Potter, he was no longer in the bathroom, disappearing from my line of sight without making any sound.
My voice cracked at the seams, going higher in its gasping, wet mewls as Harry shoved the entirety of his large, ten inch cock, into the deepest parts of my myself and made my inner walls stretch to its capacity and create his own sheath of a meat sock for himself, touching the sore points of my prostate with such an immoral drive that the top back of my head slammed against the flat ledge of the step above the one I laid out over when I whipped it back in a filthy
I nodded to Granger, chewing on the insides of my cheeks. “Uhm, if I may ask, why are we so out in the open in Wisixi Podge of all places? Won’t Animadverto find us easily?”
This chapter is the tipping point for all the shit that's that's going to happen in the next one! So get yourselves ready in this chapter because the next one is pretty fun and hot and dark mwaha.
A sense of unadulterated fear lunged into my stomach, rapacious and violent with a searing abhorrent fire that licked up the inner skin of my thighs and every nook and cranny of my jelly like limbs.
been mine, Draco.” I couldn't recognize Harry’s voice. It was otherworldly and ethereal in its disastrous cadence of discordance, deep like tones. It was a damnation of a voice.
Slipping my hands into Kikue’s, I gave a good shake of the sweat slick hand belonging to the dark haired boy’s, before speaking with a polite rasp that could be heard above the pounding music. “Nice to meet you, and thank you for having me here.”
Gasping out loud, I bent down to unlace the strings of my high heel shoes and kicked them off to the side in a haphazard, frantic manner, my breaths coming out faster than usual as I felt a prickling of unnerved and warmed energy skitter down my spine and over the cool of my skin.
The same voice that held a confident intonation spoke up again, the hand on my arm releasing and causing me to plant both my feet firmly onto the ground as I blinked away the vast array of colors playing across my peripheral view. “Sorry about that, I forgot you don’t use magic anymore.”
. I’ll ruin you and I’ll like every second of it. Why do you think I went up here with Kikue? I don’t like him, he’s not what I find attractive and he’s not the one I want to spread wide open and fuck my aching cock into until they bleed. I only brought him up here so I could get a rise out of you, because I take in all that anger and hurt and feed off of it, I find your suffering fucking orgasmic because I know you’re the only one who can get my dick harder than bloody
I was shaking now, the breaths escaping my mouth shocking and breaking in its foundation as I listened to every word Harry spoke out with a ringing fruition in my heated ears.
I quickened my pace, humping against Harry’s thigh and bouncing myself over his thrusting finger like some drunken slut, my mouth turning into molasses  as a long drawn out moan escaped my working lips against Harry’s.
There was something … demonic carrying Draco’s body in it's arms and it had let out this sort of energy from it's body that made both Ron and I pass out. We don’t know where Draco is or whatever that
silence fell between us, his fingers easing out of my mouth to suddenly grip the sharp sides of my hanging jaw and press his spit slick thumb and middle finger into my flesh there, brutal and ominous as he snagged my face up to have
And I instinctively practically tried molding myself into Harry’s side as my heart rate picked up in abnormal ticks, the blood pulsing in my veins faster than usual as I felt a a foreboding air scurry its way into my bones.
the front of his chest pressing right up against the line of my spine and letting the heat of his body warm the entirety of my person, the hard set of his abs smothering my back and rendering me breathless at the feel of the lean corded muscles of his arms tensing and relaxing with each steady inhale and exhale he gave away over the skin of my ear.
I yelped out at the demonic way Harry slammed his jaw shut a millimeter away from my face, his snarl growing into a death like grumble as he rumbled down at me in a rough grunt. “I don’t think you’re weak,
If Harry was going to make this difficult on me, then I was going to have to get a little bit creative and surprising.
“And yet you’re hard for me.” Harry murmured his words lowly over the flesh of my mouth, his statement making me tremble and press my lips together at the burning sensation crawling up my cheeks.
practically purring out of my damn mouth and the audacity of begging for him in the middle of having a mental breakdown. But my emotions were everywhere. And that included being extremely happy to see Harry. It didn’t help that I woke up to the godly sight of Harry sitting on his drawer like
But Harry was not going to like this, given the way he was tearing my damn skin apart with the prominent sinister air he was emitting at this right given moment although he remained his calm and collected self in the face of his boss.
I did my best to narrow my moonstone gaze up at him while he leaned his head down to let the tendrils of his obsidian strands brush softly over the skin of my forehead while he caught my angered, ashamed gaze with the hard cruel set of his own green ones.
I looked up at my friend from beneath the long of my pale lashes, raising my own brow up in mockery as I pressed the plush of my lips together and gave him a snort of dissatisfaction. “What’s ‘rude’ is making me lose my winning streak in Mario Cart to ask a stupid question about the party tonight, you fucking twat.”
at knowing that Harry was with Chang sexually, just a few months before us meeting each other again. Because here I thought he fucked guys only, and all of them were worthless to him, but now he went and fucked a woman and particularly one that he was in a relationship with before.
Wiping the blur of water from the narrow of my eyes, I flicked the droplets away from my visage and started a sprint up the hill, my heart picking up its rhythm as thunder and lightning started to dance among themselves in the flashing neon purple and sapphire strikes in the grey clouds gathering in clutters together with each passing second I raced up the slope of the hill with the bare of my feet slapping against the flat stoned pathway of the mansion.
you, makes it easier for my power to feed off of your purity because of the attachment it has upon you and how it would ruin me, as an individual, if you were dead. My magic feeds off of my own sorrow and emotions, so if it can have some of your magic and essence, it can also have my pain and get even more powerful. Why do you think you felt so weak when I killed that mass group of Carbonou? My magic was immediately drawn to you the most and started to eat your energy with vigor before I stopped it.”
The assassin’s eyes roved over the designs on my skin, the jaded crimson of his gaze trailing the curling paths with an eerie, dark focus that had my lips pressing together into a thin line of concern and irritation at the way Harry was completely ignoring my words.
I took what was mine, making sure his insides knew my shape and was stained with my cum like a permanent injury.
My magic started to turn black from taking in the man’s dark magic into itself and back into my body, seeming to suck it up in fast increments as the wizard’s flesh started to gray and a massive amount of blood started to create a pool around my feet and the man’s spasming body from his open stomach.
My heart gave a vicious thump against my rib cage then, the ache spreading like wildfire, flooding and setting aflame an
Keeping my eyes on the screen of my Nintendo Switch, I spoke through a barely there voice, too quiet to the regular human ear that even I couldn’t hear the mumble passing from the slight part of my mouth, exasperation and calm anger flooding out as I responded in kind to Blaise’s words. “I don’t want to go the party. Now be a good loyal friend of mine and get some sour gummy worms for me to ease my abundant hatred for your manky pillock.”
“That was a long time ago, I swear I’m a changed man now. No more anger issues, Little Dove.” The Bulgarian’s voice didn’t hold any hostility in the rising of his placating tones, the jasper of his eyes lowering in a somewhat sheepish, guilt driven manner as he shrugged in his discomforted shame.
The Asian looked ragged in her grey dress pants and blazer top with a silver colored blouse beneath, doing well to show off the curves of her voluptuous body. The woman’s black shiny long hair was left in a rats nest basically from positively getting a good fucking.
“Harry!” Weasley’s low voice snapped me out of my daze, my gaze trailing back up from the man’s dead body to the redhead who had his arms crossed over his chest, muscles straining against his black top and wide chest, seeming well put together now rather than sick to his stomach a couple minutes ago.
My mind was falling into a pit of white, black static that made my head go dizzy with spots that flooded my vision in incoming hazed pleasure.
With the way I looked, I had almost had a nervous breakdown simply by getting on the damn stage. Granger practically shoved me onto the open platform of the club with a scary grin spreading across her delicate features.
How did Granger even get involved with assassins? She’s the most morally civilized person I know. Granger having to work with hired killers doesn’t sound right to me. The damn redhead has always been all gung ho about peace and rights.
Harry’s expression gave a cold demeanor, giving nothing away but a placating tranquility that was both unnerving and exhilarating.
me with Cho Chang and Hezian in his office, apparently having to deal with sudden inquiries that dealt with assassin business where I wasn’t included from getting a magical mind linked message from Weasley.
My vision had started to grow with dark masses around the edges, spots of black and bursting white playing in my frantic dazed eyes while I hiccuped repeatedly from the lack of oxygen filling my brain as my body started to shake profusely from the amount of stress my pent up conscience decided to release out all at once.
“Give. Me. The. Bag.” I spat out my words in a frigid intonation, my brows furrowed in anger that simmered higher and higher with each minute that the two Gryffindors toyed with me.
I was falling forward, my legs fumbling out from beneath me as I felt hands reach out in time to catch my frame at my sides, Sirius' warm hands gripping onto me to keep me from becoming a limpet across the bloodied floor.
I shook my head back and forth, trying to rid the voice out of my thoughts as my mouth flapped open and closed and hands gripped at my arms to keep me steady, although the touch just made everything burn more.
Wouldn’t that voice belong to some sort of dark creature or demon? What could the thing gain in keeping me
I knew it was Weasley by discerning his magic from someone else’s in a span of a millisecond with my own.
Harry was off of the bike and placing the kickstand back into place to keep Thanos from tipping over in a blink of an eye, the warmth of the assassin gone from my cooling body and the scorching touch of his hard chest absent over my back.
Harry let out a deceptive chuckle, cruel and lilting with a raspy lull, as he dropped the head with sickening thunk across the bloodied floor.
“Okay. Yeah. Well, I’m going to go look around now so have a nice night-” I yelped out, the sound spewing out of my gaping, wet mouth as I choked on my own words when something soft and warm slipped around the circumference of my slender neck and heard an indefinite
The man let out a sigh as he watched me stand stubbornly next to his horrid painting, my arms crossed over my chest to try and make myself look like I wasn’t having a miniature panic attack at the moment.
Harry obviously enjoyed my sudden reprieve of control over myself from how he had suddenly released a guttural groan that made me press my lips together in a measly attempt at trying to keep myself from moaning out like a whore.
Making it halfway up the steps, I took a stride onto the other set of the winding stairs only to yelp out, my voice cracking in its tone with a shaking tremor, when I heard a footfall of another's steps
His eyes were hidden beneath the low drawl of his eyelids, so I couldn’t make out what he was thinking, but there was the disarming cool line of lips that told me that I wouldn’t have been able to tell what the Gryffindor was feeling simply because he wasn’t
Hezian snorted at my reply as he lifted his left hand and outstretched it towards me over his desk, awaiting while he wiggled his fingers in expectation, words short and crisp coming out of his sly grin. “Hand the money over now, Malfoy.”
that I wanted him to take me like the way he wanted, was the quivering shudder of my words that I whispered out loud from beneath the thunderous roil of the storm causing havoc outside of this wondrous mansion. A confession in sin that I will forever be tainted and ensconced by. “Yes,
I was about to speak, but my airway was blocked at the abrupt tightening of Harry’s hand, the emotionless line of his mouth opening as he continued on with his words. “That man wanted you, you know that? Despite the fact that I’ve left my magic on you to ward people off, he went out of his way to try and get just a taste of what is …”
My eyes widened, dizzy for good two minutes as I tried to gain back any semblance of my mind as I rapidly blinked from where I was forcefully being held.
The room was decently low lit, a bed made of black silk pushed up against the far wall, sheets rumpled as the room smelled of male, a particular scent of cigar smoke and warm honey filtering through my senses enticingly enough to make my body give out a series of shivers at the heady scent.
The assassin’s voice hardened into a deep rasp as he flexed the strength of his fingers over my throat, rubbing the tip of his thumb over my Adam’s apple that bobbed from my cautious swallow around a dry mouth I had, the pressure on the front of my neck making my lips pop open wide to release a heated whimper of dreaded enticement. “My magic, now mingling in with others dark powers, feeds off of others energy and magic. When I kill someone or a crowd of people, all their essence or magic, if they have any, is soaked into my skin and devoured by my power. My magic and the others I carry around  with me likes the taste of a pure being, so much so, that it would subconsciously
And in the divot of my spine, bowed in its curved state from how my arse was stuck up in the air at the sudden burst of tingling arousal overshadowing the entirety of my frame at simply being touched by Harry Potter, was a drop of my own warmed swelter.
And to be told about all this in my face from the person he fucked and not from the him himself made me want to rip out the Gryffindor’s and Cho’s face off.
Something inside of me wanted to bring about a sort of haphazard state around me and inside of me, to make a mess of things a bit. I wanted Harry to wreak havoc on me, inside of me, and around me. I wanted to shake Erus’ foundations a bit, make him come at me with some of the harsh I know he holds back against me.
Even without the stream of compliments that Harry was giving away, hearing the low sound of his enticing voice, made the erratic, panicked beating of my heart, slow down into that of a fast pace but not reaching past an hysteric pulse.
Kingsley’s eye color shifted then, so fast that it was in time to that of the beat of a Hummingbird’s wings, switching back and forth from a glowing, eerie yellow to a murky brown.
Yet now I didn’t feel guilt. Just foolish absurdity that didn’t have me feeling like complete crap and instead made me feel unrestrained and serene in the fact that it was okay for me to make mistakes.
Weasley let out a string of garbled mumbles beneath his breath at my words, squeezing his eyes shut for a brief second before he lifted his blue gaze to meet mine head on as he released a put upon apologetic sigh. “Hermione won't tell me where Draco is because she says, and I quote 'Harry is being a twat and causing the poor Slytherin turmoil. Tell Harry to find out where he is, I'm even with him and enjoying myself quite a lot.'"
Neville had on black jeans and a maroon red long rolled up sleeved shirt, his outfit showing the hard of his strong build.
And with my body shaking in the aftermath of my first mind blowing orgasm, Harry snapped his hips forward and reamed his cock straight into my worn out hole.
What I really wanted to do was shove the envelope down Andrew’s pudgy throat and watch him choke on it for a good few minutes before kicking him through his office’s floor-to-ceiling glass windows that overlooked Diagon Alley and watch him splat against the stoned floors below.
My eyes were squeezed shut, trying to breathe through my nose as my heart felt like it would lunge out of mouth from the sickness that I was put under in such a quick manner, catching me off guard as my body reacted before my mind could function what my lungs were inducing throughout my frame.
Everyone knew not to mess with me for my known bitchiness and they stayed clear of me whenever I was around, ignoring me as a way to get revenge for my snarky outbursts for their unwanted treatment towards me.
Now, sitting across the Gryffindor’s lap in only a pair of knickers that the assassin magically conjured up on my person and in a simple white T Shirt that carried Harry’s scent all over it, I was quiet giddy with the conversations exchanged between the two of us.
With a few painfully cruel punches of Harry’s cock into my sore abused hole, he had released a guttural moan and spilled himself inside of me, my body twitching from the aftershocks of my orgasm and the sensation of liquid sloshing around my insides as it painted the walls of my asshole.
“Well well well, is Kitten hungry?” Harry raised a brow up at me in dark chastisement, his voice releasing an entertained tone.
Zereth was prowling around me as I killed the victims he’d dropped at my feet, the silent amber fire of it’s gaze flickering with some sort of malicious craving intent that I haven’t seen in their eyes since the first time I was put into this room and they almost killed me by sucking out my energy.
Honestly, I wouldn’t mind working on some potion producing and helping take down a group affiliated with necrophilia sex slavery shite. If I can help in any way I can, I think I should. And I could have fun making the potion, I haven’t played around with such things since Hogwarts and I was itching to do it since Hezian announced his idea for what I could do for him.
Pressing my lips together, I breathed in and out through my nose to keep myself from vomiting, blinking rapidly as I straightened back up to see where the hell I was apparated to while I played with the insides of my cheeks between the bite of my teeth.
People loved verbally bullying me since the war but it only happened sometimes. I defended myself with my snarky mouth because despite what I’ve done in Hogwarts, that didn’t mean I needed to be treated like shit when my whole life I’ve been treated like trash by my own father, my fellow classmates, and even my professors.
The redhead had the nerve to shrug and turn around on his heel to give me the view of his broad back. “Could have fooled me. Come on, time to leave.”
Neville, whom watched me with those unearthly eyes of his, amber tinted and a burning inferno that carried molten lava and gold in the scorch of his gaze, glowing like the bursts of a sun’s fires. Assessing in his stare. No longer the gangly nerd that he was, Neville sported a body that was ripped like Harry’s, muscles tensing  and growing lax with each steady breath he took, all lean and muscled too in his equally tall stature and strong long limbs like Harry. The sinuous dips and lines of his muscles were like a supernatural being, more powerful in the way he moved like something not human with how his frame looked while carrying the strength of something akin to a myth that went around and tracked and killed whatever they thought worthy of killing. Brutal and threatening. He was wide at the shoulders as well, alabaster flesh smooth like that of marble.
I released a silent squeak when nausea flooded my system, the pit of my stomach seeming to spiral in a dizzying squeeze as it felt like my insides were being twisted every which way from the confines of my body.
And I was popping out of Hezian's office in a whirl winding blur with a rioting stomach sensation only to plop into a dingy looking foyer the next.
“Well what did you expect? I don’t like Cho and I knew you did that on purpose to get a rise out of me because you simply like getting under my skin just as much as I do with you,” I retorted, tone light except for the slight tremor in my breaths that I tried to keep steady with my nerves feeling frayed and my senses on high alert with the assassin.
He was breathing hard, the continuous inhale and exhalations from the man obvious in the way the hard planes of his chest rose up and fell in cruel increments, his pecs and abs outlined from the fast repetitive press of his thin shirt.
But why would Harry want me to hate him so much? Even when I couldn’t for the life of me, despite the way I repeated how much I hated him over and over again. Harry
I had to relive the moment where everything came crashing down on me, where I realized with despair that I’ve had a stupid crush on Potter ever since I’ve met him. It's where I figured out that I had no strength left in me to try and kill Dumbledore. It was the moment when I cried like I was being torn apart in front of my childhood nemesis, vulnerable and tired and so very young and confused.
My arse was fine as it was, not too big and just the perfect amount of plumpness at the cheeks. I was slim, having come at an average height with proportionally long legs and pale, light flesh that was splattered in freckles everywhere across the creamy expanse of my skin that I didn’t mind or thought much about.
Blinking my eyes open, I jerked back in surprise at the sudden close proximity of Harry’s handsome face near my own, my head snapping back and colliding with the wall behind me when Harry brought his middle finger down closer to my open mouth and caught the divot of my bottom lip to drag the skin downward with a slow tug, my tongue brushing over the flesh of his finger as he let out a rush of air through the slight part of his mouth, strained and roughened following my own soft exhale of a breath.
I heaved in one breath after another, chest rising and falling as I felt a cold sweat break out over my flesh as I tried to regain any sort of logical thought and my wits about me while trying to put a look of nonchalance over the pinched strain of my features.
Kingsley shook his bald head, his mouth curling down into a disgruntled scowl as he rose up his arms and crossed them over the wide expanse of his chest, reminding me of my father when he was about to give me a lecture on family priorities.
I couldn’t even look at Harry as I whipped my head sideways to avoid his gaze and started to wiggle my legs out from beneath the Gryffindor’s body in an attempt to run as far away as I could from the man and hide away in utter mortification from how much of an
“Nonononono! D-D-Don’t look, never mind about touching me, I-I-I’ll-” I cut off my own words when I heard the sheer hysteria pitched high in the tremor of my raspy tone, my fingernails digging into the floor with a frenzy as I tried to push myself up onto my forearms to gain enough weight on the tips of my toes so I could push myself up and cover the whole of my body.
Harry’s jaw tightened for a minute shifting moment, tensing with a strict countenance as he spoke through the barely thin veil of his almost immovable mouth, his hard gaze shifting down to stare at me for a swift millisecond. “Last warning. Don’t talk. I don’t want you to utter a sound. They will be able to hear
“Nah, we’re actually three.” Neville intoned huskily beside me, laughing lowly under his breath in malicious intent as the lava gleam of his eyes flickered with a Stygian promise that I wanted to run far away from.
When Harry and Neville stared at me from the smoky screen of the room filtered throughout the air surrounding them for more than a given minute, the other men at the table slowly turned their heads away from their cards and focused their attention on me now.
Perhaps tomorrow I should try to escape from Harry for a little bit and see how the Chamber is. It’s not like Harry would care about my whereabouts as long as I stayed in the vicinity of Krum’s club.
I snapped my hands up above my head, reaching for one edge of the steel door entrance with a dig of my fingertips into the old iron, but it really wasn’t necessary with how much of a push Harry gave me since my head came popping on out of the square door a moment later from his shove, my hands only helping me find a grounding object as I came basically hopping on up out of the entrance. I simply had my knees come out into the open air from Harry’s rather strong and easy push, causing me to immediately bend my knees and collide them with the forest floor outside of the door, discovering my figure out of the tunnel and into the thicket of trees and leaves surrounding me.
My vision came back to me in a fast motion. Clearing a way in my imagery like a smoke screen being dispersed from its hazed draping as I blinked rapidly in confusion, my gaze finding the steady, focused yet bewildered gaze on Harry’s face, the contours of his hard features displaying a rigorous carnivorous conflicting troubled expression.
Without even making a slight shift, the Tenebrous like magic that Harry emitted became a quick expansion, similar to that of an explosion as the black of the liquid like smoky filter separated like the breaking of atoms and inkling veins, spontaneous and releasing a burning scorch of air in its wake, momentarily rendering my vision
Hello my fellow readers! Here's another chapter for you! It may be a bit of a slow pace one but it's mostly to set up the second part of the chapter which is going to be a lot more exciting and down to the nit and gritty mwhaha. I hope you enjoy this chill chapter, it was lovely and calming to write and I think it gives more character to both Draco and Harry's personalities.
And I had to find out more about what Draco was capable of, what with being a conduit for dark magic and all.
I stared at the motorcycle with my eyes wide, stricken and cautious as I spoke around a hiss of nerves to Harry who was already starting towards his bike with long strides, easy and lazed back with an intoxicating confidence that made my skin prickle with heat, the shadow of his unruly hair darker than the steel of the bike but complimenting the foreboding sense of dominance the vehicle emitted. “I am
“You f-fucking brute! Put me down! Embarrassing me and killing someone so easily, what is wrong w-with you! I-” My mouth dropped open when Potter had tugged me closer to his chest, my sentence getting cut off as the gesture made my prick drag up his defined stomach an inch or so, the friction maddeningly burning and the pressure enticing my frame to break out into goosebumps.
When I gave a jerking, rolling motion of my hips backwards so I could ground my arse up against the warmed fabric covered large prick of Harry’s, the bastard let out a small
“You look amazing. Seriously, I feel like I need to go out there with you just to ward off everyone from coming at you. You’re very pretty and you’ve got a banger body.” I felt my neck grow warm at Caetia’s words, not used to hearing such compliments from anyone ever.
“I’m happy you’re mine.” The assassin’s tone shifted into a vibrating timbre, harsh in its almost breathy, strained rough confession as the provocative set of Harry’s lips barely moved with his quiet words spoken throughout the comforting quiet of the room.
I am so sorry I took so long to update this story. I've been busy with work and some mental problems, but I wasn't giving up on this story nor was I ever intending to and I'm not. So please be patient about the updates, my dear readers. This story is still ongoing, and I have plans for it mwaha. Thank you to those who kept supporting me and my stories as well as loving them so much.
Glancing up my figure, I turned back around on my heel, watching with a sort of trepidation at way the wet curl of my long hair, wet and silver tinged, assorted into weird coils to create something similar to that of a rats nest. The scent of almond and the light fragrance of rain coveted the whole of my body and the steamed bathroom, filtering through the humid air after having taken a slow and leisure shower in the early morning of my waking.
“You're not hard to find, Draco.” I squeaked when another voice spoke right beside me, the air of a sultry, high pitch, rich tone sounding throughout the entirety the streets into my left ear and causing my heart to collide with my chest in harsh palpitations.
One guard stood to the right side of the doors, burly looking with his extremely large muscles, seeming to try and burst out of the dark, rich suit he wore on his big stature. The man was bald, colored tattoos slinking up and wrapping around the back of his neck with a harshness to his features, strong and dangerous. The guard’s eyes were rather unique, a shade of blue that can be compared to that of sapphire.
But having to spend time with Granger was sort of perplexing. I didn’t really know the girl and the times I did shown how much we didn’t get along. Shopping with someone is something that I’ve never done before for the simple fact that I usually did things on my own. I was going to have to suck it up though if I wanted to wear clothes and not walk around nude.
Just when I was about to get my selected favorite character, Toad, through the finish line in a game of Mario Cart, a familiar voice shattered the deep concentration hovering inside the corners of my mind in a series of rapturing cracks.
I sucked in a sharp breath when I felt Harry’s other hot hand slide up the length of my neck, the blunt of his fingernails burrowing into my throat as he let his hand span out and wrap around the circumference of my neck, his skin smooth and a tanned contrast with my pale flesh.
Fluttering my eyelids about to veer away the droplets of rain water catching on the pale of my thick lashes, I let out a plush of air from my mouth as I swung my other leg up and snuggled the whole of my bare foot into the ivy as well, breathing rapidly as I let the wet of my skirt’s material slip from the death grip my hand had on it to reach up with both my free hands now and grapple onto the vines.
The rising bumps on my flesh caused my body to quake where it was strewn out across the floor, the large round of my eyes stuck on the harsh gaze the assassin bored into my own as he watched the way my bottom lip wobbled slightly from the rush of emotions flooding my senses, my insecurities rioting inside my head as I replayed each statement that released out of the Gryffindor’s mouth.
I watched Caetia’s jaw flex with a minute click, tensing as he swallowed profusely around an anxious gulp that I caught sight of with the way his Adam's apple bobbed prominently. Instead of backing away from me, Caetia decided to release a small huff of frustration as the hazel set of his eyes ripped away from my narrowed ones, looking down at the foyer and back up to me in a quick motion before speaking with a grit in his voice. “You want to let out some steam? Perhaps you should come with me to dance. And before you deny it, I’m going to say that you’re bloody gorgeous and that outfit you have on is
“You want me to fuck you? For me to lift you up by the slim of your hips so I could press my cock into your arse and pound you until you bleed for me, cry and become dirtied by my hands? It won’t happen. I have every right to tell you what to do,
I could feel the steady rhythmic beating of my heart grow in tune with the humming in my ears as the old fuck in front of me stared up at me with the stricken set of his dirt brown gaze, watching with repetetive twitches escaping his limbs how I lifted the left of my hand up towards his stomach in a slow trek.
My gaze, low lidded in a sort of awestruck want, focused on the slow rise of Harry’s eyelids, revealing the crimson glow of his magnetizing gaze mingled in with the emerald shade that pulsated within the blood of his hooded stare, blunt and searing from how they watched ahead in an unblinking manner. Harsh and all consuming.
That seemed to get the Japanese boy in gear, his feet scurrying about as he went to come at me with his lips curled up into an ugly sneer, but he didn’t get far when I suddenly felt the tugging and nauseous sensation of the apparating teleportation spell being cast upon my figure as the sight of Kikue’s haphazard, sort of crazed state, popped out of my view and was replaced by something else.
over Harry’s lap while the man sat profusely still and let out a rumble of possessive malice, the assassin held himself rigid as if he knew not to move or else he could snap at any moment from holding back whatever it was he was restraining.
Not with the way she was practically digging daggers into my flesh with how much she glared at me from where she stood patiently by her fuck toy.
isn’t he here with you right now in the state you’re in?” Caetia’s voice came out in a sort of grumbled annoyance, the anger evident from the crease in his forehead as he stared back at me in question.
when I gazed up at Harry in a daze of confusion, fear and heat, my skin flooding with a warmth from being held captive beneath the playing colors of both green and red gleaming in Harry’s penetrating gaze, the emerald sheen of his eyes pulsating within the ruby glow.
Harry seemed like someone who no longer had that calm control he always carried around with him, but instead, it was as if he had shed just one layer out of many others of his steel like skin and was showing me a
I couldn’t seem to concentrate on my newly found boss, mind elsewhere as I tried my damndest to look as if I was interested in anything Hezian was saying. But I was failing miserably.
Harry and I would need to talk further on the subject of my magic despite my obvious contradiction between agreeing or denying Harry’s suggestion.
“Did you dress yourself up?” Caetia’s question caught me off guard, his voice lilting higher in intrigue as he raised a light brown brow up at me, the  fleck of his amber eyes zeroing in on me.
I gave a raise of my brow towards Hezian. “If I didn’t cooperate, I think I wouldn’t be coming out of this place alive. So no need to thank me. You can do that when I see Animadverto eradicated. And then I’ll give you my gratitude once I know I won’t end up in a ditch somewhere.”
There was that low thrum of sated pleasure buzzing across the laze of my weakened limbs, spreading through my person similar to that of a river running over the most jagged of rocks, slickening them with a wet sensation.
I yelped out in astonishment, moving myself up to spread my thighs out on each side of Harry’s defined hips so I could sit on top of his lower half with a look of affrontation and chagrin at how I my ass
someone. I’ll traumatize myself even more so than I already am with the people I’ve already killed in the war.”
Snapping my left hand out in my bout of clumsiness, I gripped onto the ledge of the large sink and steadied myself, breaths whooshing past astonished lungs as my other hand clutched the cool material of my towel and dangled the spread of its fabric over the front of my body.
Looking anywhere but at Harry, I bent the right of my knee, feeling the air kiss the curving underside of my arsecheek and hole with how thin the panties were. I swung my leg over to the other side of the seat, my breaths coming out short and puffy as the ringing in my ears got louder and the heat on my face burned brighter, the cage of my ribs expanding harshly when the leather seat of the motorcycle rubbed up against the flesh that met my groin to my thigh, making me squeak out at the odd thrilling sensation.
When I look at Draco, there was something so deeply twisted inside of him that I could barely stroke with my outstretched fingers, a burning solstice that folded into itself and created a vast abyss of its own destruction. His purity was left abandoned as well as the darkness that has been deemed alone from the beginning. I had a morbid yet enthralled feeling that once Draco touches the darkest parts of himself, the most lightest spaces of his psyche would collide and create someone that was a rare cruelty come into existence.
I twisted my head to the side when I heard the unmistakable, very familiar, sound of someone heaving in air too fast like they were about to hurl chunks all over the place, and it was Caetia, as well as me.
A few strands of my hair fell out from my ponytail, framing the sides of my face and brushing across the skin of my cheeks and the top of my forehead.
As I stood in a cesspool of blood, guts, and dismembered body parts, I figured that my heart was somewhere halfway out of my mouth at the moment. A sense of exhilarated hatred seemed to overflow within my heated bloodstream, my blood pumping so incredibly fast that it felt like my body was merging out of myself and floating above me as I lost all sense of reality and control.
Sirius’ lips twitched at whatever the boy told him before the man’s gaze slid back over to me with a raise of his brows. “It seems my boyfriend needs me to help him with cooking the eggs, so I shall leave you for now-”
Without a given notice, the Gryffindor lowered the hand that had gestured for me to keep quiet, sweeping it vertically into the air in front of me, the motion fast and careless as the illuminate ruby hue of Harry’s eyes seemed to throb in his harsh gaze that stayed on my figure.
Harry spoke then, his voice rumbling in the wicked tundra of his words, causing my eyes to snap back over to the relaxed and confident form of Harry’s powerful body, my own trembling at the sound of his voice. “Krum and the members of his club can smell you out. Krum made a potion for him and his customers to have the knowledge of who has been untouched and who has fucked in their span of lifetime. They dab it beneath their nose and can gain the ability to decipher which one is which, for personal preference in knowing who they want to go after, a virgin or a sexually experienced person.”
I was not going to think about how I was dressed and how there were a bunch of people who wore even less clothing and could see the bare skin on my body.
My vision blurred for a moment as I felt a heated arm press up beneath the curve of my arsecheeks as I was lifted unceremoniously up against the hard chest, the air stalling in my lungs as I felt every hard dip press up against the soft flat of my chest and tummy. The familiar scent of Harry invading my body.
Hezian didn’t seem to notice my weird behavior, his attention on Harry as he gave a nod to the Assassin to show his understanding of what Harry threatened him with and his gratification.
“Fuck!” I yelled out loud, the strain in my voice cracking as the sensation seemed to crescendo, heightening in its scorching touch like the backs of my eyes were going to burn out and turn bitter, the bile in my throat rising as I choked out a series of silent screams, my body seeming to seizure on the spot as my gaze obscured and the sound of my name, worried and painfully concerned, spoke out of Harry’s mouth.
“Draco Malfoy, have you forgotten about the party today?” Blaise’s voice was pitched in a smooth drawl, all proper and uncanningly haughty in a luxurious low tint that he often thought made him out to be some sort of chilled out man but in reality actually had him sounding as if he always had something stuck in his esophagus from such force put into his pristine countenance.
I watched the way Kitten seemed to shake himself silly to dissipate my demand from his thoughts by jutting out the lush of his bottom lip and swiftly turning his head away from my eyes, the locks of his messy pale hair brushing across the cream colored, ruby stained flush of his cheeks at the quick dismissive motion.
me the way I want you! For fucksakes H-Harry, I’ve had this stupid crush on you ever since you saw me cry in that bathroom and f-f-flashed me a charming smile during my trial in the wizard court. W-Why do you want to know so much about what I’m thinking-g-g-g when you don’t even care about me!? You
The man was dangerous, a killer. And seduction dripped from the mussed locks of his dark hair that flicked at the bronze skin of his forehead and high cheekbones.
I watched Harry through my low lidded gaze, a sizzling heat playing beneath my skin that had my breath quickening and arousal lulling awake in my groin as the Gryffindor turned around from the sink he stood in front of to face me, the laze like movement slow and confident.
The muscles in his strong jaw ticked overtime, the moonlight bathing his sharp features in a soft light that made my heart
I wanted to wring the Bulgarian’s neck. I was in an enough bitchy mood now with the conflicting emotions warring inside of my body like a fucking hurricane. And the man didn’t have to interrupt my words even though I kind of appreciated it since he stopped me from digging my own grave when I was about to tell Harry that I
Harry watched me from where he sat casually across his drawer, long muscular legs spread sinfully apart as he radiated a powerful masculinity about himself with the way the dark grey sweats he wore hung off of the sharp set of his strong hip bones. The fabric of his sweats showed the defined lines of his groin, cock slightly bulging tauntingly and threateningly.
My arms were folded over my chest in a petulant manner, my lips curved into a straight line of broiling irritation and nerves as I let out a huff of air every other passing second, my eyes wandering away from my messy, nap addled expression to the entrance of my bathroom, waiting for anyone to come and help me escape this godforsaken room.
The abrupt pain that zinged through my heart at the thought of Draco having gone through any sort of torture made me take a stumbling step towards Draco only to stop short in my tracks as I watched the blonde whip his head sideways to stare at me with the unearthly glow of his gaze. Now instead of the usual stunning cobalt gray that were his eyes, their color was now like a cat’s eye, yellow with amber burning beneath the surface as if they gazed straight into heated glass.
I didn’t want to have sex right now. I only wanted it for a few seconds before coming to the conclusion that I was only doing it because I was so emotionally unstable at the moment that I chaotically thought that fucking would distract me from my problems.
The voice inside my head didn’t feel like mine, the tone harsher with the low rasp of a rumbling growl that was dipped in dark intent.
I hated that the damn creature looked otherworldly handsome. Nothing this demonic should look good. But it only briefly appeared gorgeous before it's damn face morphed into that of a nasty predator.
Harry’s breath brushed over my naked neck, wet and hot, as he pulled my head to the side some more and brought the soft of his lips over the flesh that was open to his taking, his mouth covering the white of my skin and puncturing my throat with the prick of his teeth, stabbing his mouth into me as the muscles in his jaw ticked and locked in its defined lines as he bit me.
Giving the both of the men before me a rigid nod, I ushered them with my sweeping hands to get out of my way so I could open the damn door and step out.
“Harry? W-what’s wrong-” My words were prevented by the quick motion of the Gryffindor’s hands rising up in a gesture to make me stop talking, silently telling me to keep quiet as the man standing in front of me with a decreasing hard on went deadly hushed. It was as if he was mentally venturing away from me and leaving me stranded.
Pressing my lips together, I blew out air through my nose. My arms disentangled themselves from their crossing position over my chest as I went to lift my right hand up to let the soft pads of my fingertips brush against my upper forehead, sweeping away the stray strands of my pale hair from my peripheral view.
The assassin’s hand was covered in blood, the brains of the blonde man's pouring out of his severed head and creating slick sounds as the insides trickled out and splurged onto the floor in a cascade of blood and human flesh at Harry's feet.
My back felt as if someone shoved ice down the length of my spine, my stature straightening up significantly as my limbs tensed from where I stood with my head reared back so I could look at the Auror from my shorter height compared to his tall one.
A dark wash of colors belonging to the shadows of the night spilled across the halls of the Slytherin dorms, my feet softly padding against the pristine hardwood floors as we traced our way down the halls in a hushed manner in an attempt to keep our presence unknown to any perking ears that may be awake.
But in my head, at that age, I had to kill them because it was the only way I could survive Voldemort and keep my family safe.
I tried to give another feeble try at crawling out from under the Assassin, but he just only ground his hips further onto my arse when I did and trapped me.
I was going out of my mind, speechless and left with a plumping prick that made my skin flush hotter and my heart go into hysteria as my trembling hand went to grasp at the back of Harry’s shirt to tug on it. “P-Put me down. I’m really s-sorry. I won’t do it again.
into my arse. I could tell. What with how easy Harry’s finger slipped into me and how my hole was now straining around a bundle of liquid and a penetrating appendage.
Chewing on the insides of my cheeks, I let out a huff in response to Harry’s words, an itching sort of burn beneath my skin starting to formulate as the weariness of everything happening around me started to weigh heavily down on my mind, causing mingling emotions of dread, arousal, shock and confusion inside of my head.
The cool air caressing the whole of my back made me want to hunch over in on myself or attempt to cover the expanse of my exposed spine. The top I was forced to put on was made up of the darkest shade of blue, the sheer navy hue shadowed like the early mournings of midnight. The top was backless except for a few thin strings that crisscrossed over one another at the bottom dip of my spine, the sleeves were made up of the same stringy material. The shirt was created out of silk that gleamed whenever the fluorescent lighting touched the material. The top exposed the flat of my navel and the skin just above my belly button, the bottom hem curving into a rather elegant upside down V that had its edges touch the curves of my sides.
. Right now, I have to flick time back on and get us out of here.” The breeze of Harry’s warmed breath caused a riotius sweep of energy to play down my curved back, his words ringing in the empty space of my ears as I subconsciously made a minute
Harry swished his hand out into the air abruptly, making me tilt my head sideways in fixated bafflement as I watched within a blurring second how Harry’s clothes changed and from the chill disappearing from my once exposed back from the outfit I wore during the whole night, I looked down to see that my apparel had changed as well.
I trembled underneath Harry’s gaze, having no amount of strength to look away for the sheer fear I felt at the consequences I would get if I did. The vampire was screaming louder now, causing my eardrums to quake at the high pitch splitting the still air.
His words and the sound of his meek voice made my cock pulsate violently inside of Draco in response, blood and heat pumping faster into my prick.
The handsome sharp lines of his features were in more of a defined set with the way his jaw ticked as if working with a strain he couldn’t contain and mask enough, the set of his provocative lips in a line of neutrality that made the indifference he shown unsettling and
Sucking in a sharp breath with my imagery instilled deeply into my mind, I directed it into my hand that gripped Zereth's wrist simultaneously.
with me? Oh dear gods. I needed to get  inside of the Chamber before I had to turn this man down. There was no way that I was going to fall into this man’s hands like putty.
I lifted my hand away from Harry’s nape to smack him playfully against the side of his shoulder, huffing out indignantly although I couldn’t help but smile nonetheless at the man’s words.
Tightening my hold over the envelope, the straining whites of my knuckles were a ghastly white against my already pale enough skin, anxiety heavy and rushing through my very veins as I watched the slight tremors in my hand.
“Right. Well. It’s not like I’m interested in involving myself with such vulgar behavior. Now can we move on from this subject so I can get some rest from this exhausting day?” I asked my question through the grit of my teeth, refusing to meet the two men’s gazes that I felt were boring into my very flesh.
I saw Caetia start to tug at the short sleeve of Sirius’ shirt, the brown haired boy nudging his head towards the kitchen's space out of my room. “Give your cousin some privacy.”
I may be an ex death eater but whenever someone threatened me, I didn’t take their shit. I’ve had to deal with everyone hating me all my life and there was no way that I was going to stand here and take this vampire’s crap. There’s a reason why no one bothers with me, and that’s either because they think I’m nothing but trash that shouldn’t be acknowledged or because an angry Malfoy that makes them not even want to get close to me makes them stay away. My bitchy attitude has kept me safe so far and right now, I needed this stupid vampire to back off.
I gave my cousin a bored look, my cheeks hinting at a flush of red from the man’s words. Sirius held himself like Harry, but without the overwhelming sinister demanding presence that the assassin carried around with himself. The way they looked at people were the same though, heavy and focused, just less intense than when Harry did it.
exposed in front of the Gryffindor, not knowing whether or not it was a good idea to have been so vulnerable in front of this assassin.
I woke up with a startle, limbs jerking about haphazardly as a chilling breeze swept across my flesh in a biting flush, the sound of clanking metallic chains rattling inside of my ear drums in a startling wake up call as my body slowly arose from its state of deep slumber only to realize that I was entrapped.
I opened my mouth to retort, but the blue eyed man had stopped whatever I was about to say by having my focus obscure from watching him reach behind his back to procure a red wood cut jagged wand with his right hand and swish it with a flourish around both our bodies in a circular motion above our heads. That same queasy sensation of magically induced teleportation stuffed its way over and into my body as I found myself gritting my teeth to keep from sneering at the boss once we landed in a dark brown room.
Hissing beneath my ragged breaths from the amount of exertion my body was going through from all the fucking running I’ve been doing, I realized it had to be at least thirty minutes since I’ve started to go through the cave and gawked a bit at the mansion then started up the hill with quickened feet.
another latin term that means “to turn the mind to” or “perceive”, basically a faction that wants to make itself sound fancy when their doing shite things to people for the sake of another’s pleasure. Literally. They want others to take notice and interest in combining dark arts and sexual practice together, which usually ends up with a disturbing case of fucking the dead, like necrophilia.”
Zereth had said the wizard had murdered his own family with dark magic. But I couldn’t find it in myself to be the one to kill him. The act of killing in itself is different from seeing someone else do it and doing it yourself.
I did my best to settle my features back into my signature look of a prissy Malfoy so I didn’t have to show anymore of my emotions out in the open in front of Sirius.
I butted in before Hezian could respond, raising my brows up and clicking my tongue towards the seething woman. “Because I have things that he needs. Don’t be upset and start bringing up my terrible past to make yourself feel better and get revenge at me after Harry and I accidentally interrupted your rather boring fuck fest.”
I let out a tittering hum around the food in my mouth, the sweet jelly fruit of blackberries and soft fluffy waffles touching the space of my taste buds causing an explosion of sweetened euphoria to trickle its way into my person.
The boy was covered in intricate sheer lace, his bum trying to pour out of the thong he wore with his nipples evident against the see through red corset stopping above his belly button, his stilettos going all the way up to the middle of his thighs.
”. Pansy’s trilling voice spoke out from behind my stood figure, her tone giddy in the slight teasing manner that formulated within her comment.
How did this happen? I didn’t do anything last night and I sure as fuck didn’t go out and get myself sucked on for shits and giggles.
I tried not to rub myself off on him and focused on staying still so Potter wouldn’t notice my inappropriate hard on.
And my heart stuttered and faltered in the cage of my chest right then and there at the way the fluorescent lights above the stage I stood on shown brief flashes of Harry’s form in miniscule moments, causing my heel shoes to stagger about clumsily across the gleaming dark floor with an embarrassing shuffle.
Potter was sexy, unbelievably so, looking like some sort of otherworldly being, devilishly handsome and stunning to look at.
I felt Erus’ body shift into a walking motion, jostling my frame a bit from side to side as I practically melted and stuck myself against Harry’s hard front, arching my back so I could feel the harsh grip of Harry’s fingers embedding themselves into my bum's jean covered flesh, sagging against the assassin as all the energy seemed to be drained out of my skin and bones, leaving me frail and shaking as I repeated the words Harry spoke out to me just now in my head.
Lifting my eyes up off of my feet, I looked at Harry cautiously, my eyes narrowing the slightest. “Is it because I’m not to get hurt on the job?” My words came out irritated and a tad pinch of reluctance flooding into my tone as well.
The assassin let his palm on my spine, run down the slope of my curved back, pressing down upon my frame with a heavy, steady dominance that caused my chest to concave upon itself with the amount of oxygen I tried to feed off on as a clear demand from the man above and behind me slipped its way into my bones and settled there, molten and alarmingly feverish.
Here's a new chapter! This will be the second to last one so the next chapter I update will mark the end of the story! I thank all of my readers for giving so much love for the story and the characters involved. You've all been so very kind and enthusiastic about my works and I couldn't have wanted any better.
Harry’s lips were on mine in the blink of an eye, the heated soft flesh of his mouth pressing almost fervently over the plush set of my own as as I let out a small breath that Harry seemed to have breathed in as if he was taking the entirety of my essence with him like the selfish beautiful bastard that he was.
The top I wore was a long sleeved black one that had a low dip in the neckline, the fabric coming off my shoulders to cinch around the sides of my upper arms, showcasing the sharp lines of my collarbones. The bottom hem of the top reached exactly where the hemline of my skirt stopped a little above my belly button.
And without a second of hesitation, my brain not even having enough time to catch up to what was happening, the man flicked his right hand out and brushed the skin of my forehead in a feather light touch with the pad of his middle fingertip.
I slammed my fists over the Assassin’s shoulder blades, pounding away at the hard flesh as I squirmed in his grip where he had slung his right arm over the top curve of my arse in an ironclad grasp and kept me there with such careless ease.
But I had no qualms of it. I knew I had a body that could match a woman’s almost. I thought I looked fucking killer in what I wore when I had the time and energy to put effort into my appearance.
I made sure that the potion was away from Harry’s quick exclamation in case it caught any of his molecular spit from his sneeze.
Harry’s lips twitched, as if he had the urge to smile at the open curiosity of my statement, but he didn’t give it away from the neutral line of his cupid bow shaped lips as he started walking away in the direction to my left, ushering me to follow him with a grunt my way.
I was too shocked and scared at the thought of almost breaking every part in my body down those steps to get pissed off at the Bulgarian. Instead, I had quickly walked off and went back to the Slytherin dorm rooms to cry like a baby.
The voice sounded inhumane, coming out in an animalistic snarl that’s tone was dropped two or more octaves, rattling inside of my head to the point where I couldn’t contain the broken cry from releasing out of my mouth at the torturous agony the voice created in my head.
I’d go back to work, function normally because one shot couldn’t get me drunk, and end up in my apartment when I finished. Alone. As always.
I winced from where I sat against the big leather chair in front of Hezian’s glass emblazoned desk while I was getting lost in my mind like a dumb arse and probably looking like a lunatic.
And by the sound of Hermione’s voice, the woman was obviously worried about me and most likely mad at Harry for keeping me hidden away from her.
My cock twitched at the thought of the Gryffindor chasing me, stalking after me as I tried to keep my distance from him and keep myself hidden from his penetrating, overwhelmingly brilliant gaze.
When I heard Andrew Grant permission for my entrance, I stepped into his office, tearing the door open in my haste of nerves and stepped through the office to shut the door soundly behind me.
I was starting to see black and blue in my vision as my skin grew more hot and cold by each passing second, my gaze catching sight on how all the Carbonou creatures stilled in their rapacious movements as their blank faces swiveled over to where Harry stood.
“I know. You’re a sweet, untouched virgin who’s never shown you’re creamy pale naked flesh to anyone … ” Harry mumbled out his words in a deep rumble as his hands settled over the curves of my arse and squished the meat they held with a biting force that made me jolt against my prone position across the floor.
And if sneaking out in revealing clothes is what I had to do to go have some semblance of an entertaining time, then I’d do it.
And as quick as he looked at me, his gaze was off of my figure and back to facing the forest in front of him, the succulent curves of his mouth barely forming around the rasp of his low words as he spoke out to me. “We’re in Kamakura, Japan. When we get to my motorcycle near the road that's supposed to appear soon here, we’re going to head off to Tokyo where a good friend of mine lives. He throws parties every night. You need to look the part of a young, pretty gay boy since everyone who attends the parties are homosexual. You need to blend in and with this appearance, well, it's really the only way to get into the party since my friend doesn’t allow those who don’t dress up into the event. Everyone is dressed to the nines in that party so us showing up at the place all bloodied and gross would catch their attention and we don’t need that cause it could notify wizards around the area who are affiliated with Animadverto if we cause a scrutiny.” Harry’s voice was a deep drone like mumble, as if his thoughts were elsewhere as he explained to me the reason why I had to dress like this.
“Grab onto the ledge of the entrance and heave yourself up when I give you a push.” Harry’s words were rumbled out loud, the hot and heavy tone of his voice catering to a severe drawl that made my groin thrum in attentive, bubbling heat.
But of course, Harry had to make my embarrassment worse. The assassin’s mouth tilted up into a salacious grin, leisure and dipped in mockery. “I am. I find myself leaning towards guys more with the way their arseholes squeeze much
Before I could start bawling like a baby in front of Granger, I spoke out around a shaky response although laced with appreciation. “I’ll take that offer on getting some sleep now … Hermione.”
I had to keep myself from whining out in dismay at his display of enticing masculinity and his devilish charms.
” My last word was yelled through the part of my wet mouth as my chest and the side of my cheek bounced and slid up the floor from another heavy slap of Harry’s palm against my left arsecheek, this time smashing the heat of his hand right where my thigh met the curve of my cheek, making me kick out my legs in blissful pain, not knowing whether or not to try and escape the spanking I was receiving.
Harry gave no emotion away, expression devoid of any feeling as that unearthly unsettling stare of his stayed on my person that dripped in sopping wet clothes.
The man’s eyes shimmered then, a sly look passing over his handsome features as he let the curve of his lips tip up into a grin. “Yes you may. Since you’re new, I suggest you put on this white band that goes around your thumb. It shows that you are going into the Chamber to have a look around, that you are not available to be propositioned. If you want to go in there with the intention to ‘play’ then you must wear a silver band, it shows that you are a submissive and are willing to coalesce. I can’t sense if you are a virgin or not since there is no scent coming from your body, so I suggest you tell anyone who is going to come up to you tonight if you are experienced or not. Do you understand?”
The assassin released a languid groan, filthy and downright predatory as he went even faster and harder, fucking his cock into me like an untamed beast. His dick practically slaughtered my insides as his thrusts became so powerful that the wall behind me cracked from the force of his thrusts, my back aching from the pain of it slamming profusely against it, spine tingling and cut up.
I had started growing it out during my seventh year in Hogwarts for the sole purpose of having my fingers be able to fiddle with something whenever I was too stressed or nervous about whatever was weighing on my mind. My hair fell past my shoulders and reached the small of my back.
feeling I could formulate and pinpoint throughout my loss of perspective while being the sole thing that made my thoughts run rampant in chaotic fixation. He was a puzzle that had no discerning shape or size that I wanted to glue together. He was a continuous interest of mine that I knew I would never bore of and that both adrenalized my person and enticed me to be extremely cautious of him. Because Kitten made me
Harry used his magic on me like it was children’s play, no words murmured out loud, just pure mental strength capacity that allowed the depth of his power to release and conjure up over my person.
The demon’s face was screwed up in confusion before pain withered across their features when I swung my right leg out and slammed it against Zereth’s left thigh, forcing all of my power into the hit at the exact moment my limb collided into the demon’s.
I rolled over across the small expanse of my bed, fuzzy black blankets curving around the tangle of my limbs as I let out one exaggerated breath after another, the air releasing from my mouth blowing away the mess of my pale hair out of my eyes and cheeks as I shoved my face into the soft plush of my pillow.
The emerald gleam of the Assassin’s gaze looked to have almost been eroded completely by the deep wine red color of his eyes, shrouding the brilliant hues of the jaded shade in a dark consume.
“So I’ve heard,” Harry responded in kind to my words and interrupting my train of thought, grinning still as he went to lean his head back down to meet my lips once again.
There was no way to stop the buckle of my knees and my bare arse from falling to the floor in a heap of warmed, frail limbs, my breathing becoming ragged.
Pressing my lips together to keep myself from letting out an indefinite sound that would put me into an embarrassment turmoil, the Gryffindor’s hot breath whooshed across my thigh as he gripped the back of my knee and gave an easy tug up to cause my balance to wobble while my leg bent up towards Harry’s knelt fit frame. “Take them off, Princess. I’m giving you an hour to hide from me inside of my house until I come searching
I rolled my bottom lip into my mouth, taking in the matted blood stained hair of Harry’s as well as the red coating parts of his clothes while I bounced my leg over the man’s thighs, trying to grab Harry’s drifting gaze with my own again. “I knew, somewhere in the back of my head, that you didn’t mean to hurt me that way. You don’t know about my past trauma with my parents so it’s alright, Harry. I just reacted too quick with my hurt feelings.”
At the far end from where I stood in front of the party, there were various hallways that led down into darkened corridors where other rooms led to another in an almost endless maze of rooms. A bar sat precariously over to my left, students making their own drinks and sloshing the alcohol around in their tittered excitement.
“I didn’t want you waking up to some unknown figure lying next to you if you still didn’t recognize me … I wouldn’t want you panicking and hurting yourself in your attempt to hurt me or run from me if you still hadn’t regained your memory of everything by then, so I had kept my distance in case, although it pained me to do so,” Harry mumbled up at me.
I pressed my lips together in an attempt to not start gasping for air again, watching the gurgling of the red liquid slide out of the Auror’s head and spill more out onto my floor.
shite! I just wanted to get some fresh air!” I hissed out my angered words to the empty air, the flush of my skin bitten cold from the freezing air touching every nook and cranny of my body.
I stood very still, my heart hammering harsh against my chest as I blinked at the man before me, soaking in the information.
And then Harry opened the succulent curves of his emotionless mouth and uttered out three words that made my flesh break out in unwanted tremors of terror streaked caution and trepidation. The lingering thrum of my arousal dissipated then, and I was left with an anxiety that I could not shake off.
Saliva started to gather up in my mouth and spill out over the corners of my lips to curve down my jaw and the upturn of my craning neck as I stared helplessly up at Harry with large eyes, the sensations skittering over my skin and inside of my body all new and overwhelmingly pleasurable.
Caetia was clad in black leather short shorts, tight fitted around the slim of his frame with a long sleeve navy blue top that shown the sides of his shoulders in an open oval formation before the material fabricated once again to reach the middle of his fingers, sheer and see through as it shown the curves of his person, chest exposed and walking around with a pair of black high heel boots, the smooth of his white skin on display with a decadent and wondrous mask of subtle makeup.
I knew where Draco lived, what he was doing every day, how, when, where and why. I watched Draco strip down the the barest form of his milky flesh as he doused himself in water for a bathing or prepared for work or bed.
I’ll most likely end up finding something, perhaps a leather jacket, to cover myself up more a little. But there was a surety about wearing Caetia's clothes to keep me mixed in with the crowd and not stick out too much.
And two of them, men that I’ve decided to ignore for the sake of my sanity, were sitting by each others’ side at the opposite side of the table, facing me head on.
I pressed my lips together, chewing on the inside of my cheek as I slipped around one person and the next. The crowd of people, both muggle and wizard, clambered about across Diagon Alley’s cobbled stone floors. They chattered amongst themselves, some walking briskly to their destinations as some took slow treks - others mumbled while some yelled or talked in hushed tones to their acquaintances.
Turning on my bent knees, I brought the fork up to show it to Harry in case he thought I was bluffing about having grabbed my fork, but stopped the words of self pride from coming out of my mouth when I had craned my neck up and stared up at the assassin from beneath my lashes.
“The In-Between” by In This Moment, a rock song, started to play across the speakers that were hefted up on each corner of the walls surrounding the room.
A scream tore away from the dropping of my perplexed jaw all of the sudden, head snapping to the front and body jerking in Harry’s lap as well as across the floor when the heated flat palm of the Gryffindor’s hand became a blur of motion and I felt a stinging slap smack against both my arsecheeks and right over my quivering, exposed hole.
“You don’t get to come. But you will come with me to my place and have a long talk.” Harry’s voice was devoid of any emotion, monotonous in contrast to the terrifying cruelty lying dormant underneath the eerie calm of his facade.
My breaths stuttered out as my back was forced up against the wall, my legs wrapping instinctively around Harry’s narrowed defined hips. My stupid jeans hung off of one leg now, stuck on my boot as the fabric dangled and brushed against the ground, material caught on my foot. But I couldn’t have cared less.
Smiling contentedly as I took in the heat from the fire crackling in their chimney to my right with a comforted sigh, I didn’t even notice I was losing myself in my own thoughts until Granger shifted from where she sat cross legged in front of me on the rug.
The man liked the sound of my shout what with the way Harry let out a sinister, snarling moan while he punched his hips with a ruthless grind of his cock against my prostate with a given barbarous thrust of his dick into me.
But just as I was about to set myself into the notion that I would fling myself over Hezian’s stupid office desk to strangle the living shite out of the bitch before me, Harry’s boss decided to interrupt Chang with a sharp, hard edged response as he spoke to the two of us. “That’s enough. Let’s establish that Cho here is a regular fuck hole for the assassins and a well rounded woman that’s highly respected in her business,” Hezian growled out his next words as he stared straight at Chang with a look of complete irritation towards her, “and let’s also establish that Draco is not useless but is far more smart than any of the assassins here, plus you and I, given his exquisite history in academics. So put away that hideous jealousy you got going on there Cho before I kick you out of my office.”
That wanker, Hezian, knew that I was going to go through with his plan, and already had people assigned to me so quick!
Potter’s black sweats clung to his defined, tanned hips, the powerful muscles of his legs and thighs flexing beneath the workout pants as he had the left foot of his leg crossed beneath his right in an angle to lean against the doorframe with a casual stance. His white short sleeve T-Shirt shown the swell arch of his biceps and the straining tendons of his long arms crossed over his hard chest.
I had to do this if I wanted to survive anyway. And once I gained enough power for myself, I would kill Zereth before they tried to kill me.
Within a spitting, blurring motion, I felt Harry release a growl that resembled something akin to an unholy snarl, the sound hedonistic and ravenous enough to make the blissed out daze of my gaze focus enough to catch the split second of the carnal sneer curling up on the side of Harry’s lips, all animal and
The few of my housemates that were very much liked and forgiven, were Blaise and Pansy, including a few others.
It seemed the fear resonated in my words, given the way Harry brought his eyes back up to my body in a slow trek to meet the wide of my gaze, his brows drawing down to give me a look of concentrated focus, although calm in the way the hard, striking set of his features receded into a relaxed demeanor. “You may think that I wasn’t much of a learner, given my history of skipping out on every test I could back in Hogwarts, but being an assassin and all, I had to have a good knowledge of both wizard and muggle history. To be profusely intellectual. So I had to study a lot in all the subjects the world had to offer so I could qualify in such a high task job.” Harry paused his stream of words as he took a step forward, too damn quick for my eyes to catch as I found my body a sliver of air away from the assassin’s, his towering form crowding in on my space with that heady scent of his and the heat of his body colliding with my own, significantly calming my nerves with his close presence.
Snapping my head forward, my back jarred against the wall as it gave a harsh spasm from how I found my face just a sliver of air away from Harry’s, the rushing breath of my lips aligned with the assassin’s.
And when I watched the man die before my eyes, my magic ceased to exist and it collided back into me and settled deep into the marrow of my bones like a comforted kitten, purring with happiness and blatant glee in it’s murder of the human before me.
The hand around my throat squeezed, making my breaths come out stilted and my body wiggle in discomforting, shamed
The smell of rain, wet and fresh, blanketed over my senses, causing my skin to revel in its soothing, thrilling touch as I raced up the slope of the hill with cold feet and my hands fumbling about across the slick fabric of my sticking top and skirt in an attempt to cover myself up, especially the outline of my perking prick and my hard nipples.
Just as I was falling into a tunnel of darkness, head ringing like a high pitched whistle with static in the background, Zereth had pulled it's mouth away to release an impassioned guttural chuckle then. The sound was laced with dark delight that came out in languid savagery, depraved and in dark bemusement.
My breaths were coming significantly faster and faster, the harsh of my heart beating against my rib cage causing my chest to rise up with a shudder and my body to gain a hazy weakness within itself at everything that just happened around me.
Right when I was about to veer the conversation away from what it was and towards some questions I desperately wanted answers for from the assassin, my stupid stomach let out a rather ferocious grumbling growl, bubbling empty in the pit of my gut as the sound seemed deafening in the still quiet of the room.
The cold dollop of vanilla ice cream creamed over the expanse of my seeking tongue, a delicate sweet soft flavor exploding inside of the caverns of my greedy mouth as a tuneless purr emitted from deep within my chest, content and pleased.
Flashes of images played like a livewire of electricity across my eyes when I stared down at the broken porcelain doll lying across the wet linoleum floor, of how I could easily drag the slim thing by the small of his ankles, turn him around and shove my cock into him, rough and without mercy as I turn him into a meat sock for my dick to fuck until Draco was left drooling and bleeding out. To desecrate and shed him of every thought until he shown me the innocence he carried within him.
And it seemed that Arte et Marte needed the money to stop a large faction of psychotic killers from running a disturbing business.
Blinking out of my haze of amazed awe at Harry’s mansion, I watched with widened eyes as a flash of lightning, amethyst streamed and electricity laced, shot out of from one of the clouds and struck diagonally in a zigzag motion to my right. A clap of thunder following soon after the rush of lightning, brutal and rumbling deep in the confounds of my chest as it sounded out like the growl of a steam engine all around the prone shape of my figure and making my breath come out in a whoosh of exaltation.
With one simple tug upwards of Harry’s index fingers in the rip of my pants below my arsecheeks, the material tore away with a deafening splitting of fabric bouncing off of the dark walls surrounding us, and I yelped out as the careless action made my hips sway from one side to the next from the rough pull of Harry’s hands.
I pressed my lips together, letting my teeth chew on the insides of my cheeks as I twitched against Harry’s magical hold on me.
Resisting the urge to throw a hissy fit, I rolled my eyes as well, not too keen on the time I’ve been spending with Harry being interrupted once again of all things.
I tried not to grimace whenever the cracking sound of bones shattering or limbs breaking slid into my ears.
order I give you without hesitation. I need you to keep your mind in check, as best as you can, because this is going to get messy extremely fast and I will not be holding you’re dead body in my hands anytime soon. You do as I say, when I say it, and exactly how I say it. Don’t argue with me. And do not speak. Do you understand.” Harry’s voice dropped into that of a thunderous roil, akin to a heavy cadence that seemed to wind its way around the very harsh expansions of my lungs, squeezing around my air supply to leave me bereft of any air. There was no question in Harry’s tone, just pure stringent demand that settled like murky water in the shaking of my limbs as I sat in my incoming turmoil and the abrupt realization that shite was about to hit the fan and if I didn’t want to die, I had to do as the professional assassin
it’s cum out and into the channel of my Kitten’s arse. I felt the veins in my neck snap and strain against my skin as my throat worked over its strain to keep my dark magic at bay while I thrusted my hips twice the rhythm it was at so I could shove shove and
I also didn’t think that anyone else knowing about what I am is a good idea since the damn Ministry of Magic would lock me up or something of the sorts if they got word of what I was.
My flesh felt like a knife had been dragging its tip into it, carving its way through the skin with heated metal, breaking into me and digging, digging,
Heat buzzed like livewire over the contracting slim muscles of my limbs as sweat slicked along my flesh, my body rocking as I started to kneel across the marbled platform to press the palm of my hands on the ground, the lower half of my body swiveling in a slow figure eight motion as I started to crawl towards the front of the stage to close in on the tables nearby.
As if on reflex, my hands twitched by my sides, the sensation of Draco’s naked plump bum jiggling beneath the cracking swat of my palm seeming to tingle back alive over the inner skin of my hand at the thought of the kind of punishment I gave the princess before we were ambushed by the Carbonou.
The surprisingly tight jeans Pansy had picked out for me practically form fitted around the plump of my bum cheeks, accentuating the perky, robust curves quiet enticingly. My mother would have rolled in her damn grave if she saw me wearing such tight clothes, but I really could care less since she barely even checked up on her own son nowadays.
The fact that Zereth had declared that they were going to eat me only gave me more confidence in knowing that the demon was weakening because it needed to feed and I was pumped full of enough magic and energy for it to regain some good power to revitalize itself.
Harry slowly settled into the chair in front of me, looking at me all the while with an intensity that felt as if he was setting my flesh on fire from how the blood red of his gaze slipped down every crevice of my body as if he was violating my body on the inside on this stage in front of everyone right now, filthy and animalistic.
The blue eyed man stared me down with a lazy frown now marring his once bemused expression. “You’ve also got a bitchy mouth on you. Sort of makes me want to show you how to use it correctly, love. Why don’t you hold your breath and come with me to my office so we can speak in private.”
“Why must I wear heels? At least let me put in my boots-” Caetia furrowed his brows down at my words, causing me to put a halt in my protests.
Whatever was talking to me didn’t sound like the same thing that talked to me through my mind earlier today, the tone more quiet but holding an indefinite threat and sin behind its constrained words.
I watched Kingsley’s jaw tense, his gaze finally dropping away from my stubborn one as he cleared his throat rather obnoxiously loud while he situated his prone form by rolling his shoulders beneath his black Auror robes. “I’m here to interrogate you about Albon Trisko and Jazine Besory, that bartender women you met. They were both murdered last night at the nightclub, Astringent, and witnesses say that they saw you vacating there for a good couple of minutes and leaving rather abruptly just before Zabini found his bartender and customer dead.”
I watched Ron look my way, his wand raised in apprehension as he gazed at me with darkened blue eyes that conveyed an apology that I didn’t want whatsoever because Draco was going to be okay and with the help of both Ron and Hermione, we were going to find him even if I had to kill each and every thing that gets in my way.
And when the Gryffindor emitted a sadistic, dull humored chuckle that wrenched its way into the center of my abdomen to cause a riotous tremor to rake over my flesh, my body went into overdrive and did a flighty movement.
In the end, I was still suspected for killing Dumbledore even when Snape admitted to it and was also sent to Azkaban with my father. But Hermione came forth during mine and my mother’s trial in the wizarding court and proclaimed both my mother and I innocent, speaking about how we were under the dark lord’s influence by force.
“My turn,” Harry’s voice rumbled within my chest, making me suck in a sharp breath at the voracious sound he released, his eyelids lifting open to reveal the illuminate sheen of his contrasting colored eyes, “what’s your favorite color?”
I was both angry, ashamed, and hurt, most of the frustration aimed at myself for being a stubborn git in my crush for Harry and ending up getting a solid mental slap in the face at the cold realization that my like for Harry was never going to be reciprocated in the way I ached for.
Harry, the bastard, walked around my stern figure to shove the heat of his hands behind my back and cause me to stumble forward and right beneath the open entrance directly above my head, my arms disentangling themselves from the off balance of my feet as I huffed out indignantly at the audacity of everything.
Harry’s face was set into a look of dark rapture, his focus on me and only on me as I ground myself against him, moving my bum along his thighs in a sensual motion as I breathed in his scent and basked in the heat of his body. I could make out his muscled chest rising up whenever I let my prick and arse rub along the length of his large cock beneath his jeans, the smell of blood and ominous power rolling off of him in unnerving waves as I held myself back from crying out at the slightest friction I’d make with our bodies pressing up against each other.
I was squeaking out my stuttered words, spit dripping from the corners of my wide mouth as I drooled over the marble floor and moaned with a slutty grind of my arse against Harry’s hard dick.
My cock was bouncing profusely and rubbing against mine and Harry’s lower abdomens, causing a delightful friction that made my bliss heighten even more as I was fucked stupid and became drunk on the assassin’s assaulting member inside of me.
My gaze flicked away from Potter’s to fixate on anything but the assassin in front of me, angling my body to the side in an effort to cover up the hard outline of my bulge beneath my towel and keeping my head tipped low to let the strands of my messy drying hair shield my burning face from Potter’s view.
,” Harry murmured lowly down at me, letting his weight fall slightly so he could press me into the mattress with his toned body over mine while lifting our intertwined hands together so he could press soft kisses across my knuckles there as he watched me beneath the heavy set of his glowing red green eyes. His messy hair swept across his forehead with the motion, rendering me speechless from the way he looked so brilliantly gorgeous in that moment
Harry’s eyes darkened, the red of his gaze turning into a bloodied shade as the green flickered into a poisonous foliage, sinister and tinted with a foreboding film. “Let’s play a game. For every question I answer, you do as I tell you too, no complaints whatsoever, since you’re such a stubborn
I had to tell Harry what my intentions were for agreeing with Hezian’s orders since it wasn’t all just to help make a potion but also to help me get a better grasp on what I was with the knowledge that I’d have to have a large amount of resources to help me make said potion. So I’d get my hands on some books that can give me a bit more information on my dark magic and what with being a conduit and all.
The heart in Harry’s hand was grasped between the assassin’s straining fingers, his appendages digging into the lifeless organism continuously in a controlled grind with the flex of his hand opening and closing, a vicious calm that shown the protruding veins that ran rampant and brutally in Harry’s arm.
Why did my body react that way with those two arseholes? I didn't want it too. Those Gryffindors were nothing but trouble.
that the demon was taking my magic and my life source straight into itself from how the oxygen in my brain seemed to thin out along with the heavy weight of my pain, a repetitive stroke of receding agony and then scorching suffering.
And that’s when a sickening squelch resounded throughout the room, my wide eyes catching the sight of the tip of a dagger, blood red and dripping with the liquid onto my wooden floors, sticking out from the front of Kingsley’s head.
“Guess my potion worked so far.” I whispered my words into Harry’s hair as I let my hand rub softly against the man’s back in a soothing manner.
you want to stop, Draco. What? You can’t handle a little bit of a punishment you’ve been itching for since we’ve collided with each other’s lives all over again? Tell me, what’s going on in that witty head of yours.” Harry was
his hold around the jut of my Adam’s apple and flexed the calm of his hands around my collar with a sadistic flash of blood red lighting up the sharp and
You just keep trying to suck me in. Want me to give you my cock some more?” Harry rumbled up at me, eyes keen and daunting as they flashed red and green at me from the moon’s light washing over his upturned face.
The Gryffindor let out a dark chuckle as he brought his head down to let the soft set of his lips drag down over the space behind my right ear and to where my neck met my shoulder, a quiver shaking my body as he grumbled into the flesh there, loud enough for my ears to pick up. “You know your safe word?”
Miraculously, as if the Assassin knew what I was thinking or if he just wanted to get into a more comfortable position in fucking me, he had wound his strong sweat slick arms around my lower back and lifted me up with a slight tremor.
I couldn’t help the flush that spread out over my neck and up my cheeks as I started shaking my head vigorously, the mess of my pale hair whipping across the skin of my forehead and cheeks as well as my neck from how hard I shook my head, my heart thudding violently against my chest as I tried to keep the sudden erratic bursts of my breath calm.
to see you like this. So you’re going to take the punishment you asked for. You’re going to get exactly what you wanted and I’m going to
Maybe I'll even ask Caetia to teach me some dance moves just to spite Harry and his orders for me to stay docile in my room.
I tried plastering on a blank face as I gazed back up at Harry, trying to hide the tremor I felt in my body from having to be under Harry’s focus again. “Fine. But the least you could do is let me have some ice cream after I get some real food in my system.”
I dipped my right hand down and straight into Harry’s trousers, fingers brushing against Harry’s pulsing hard cock, soft skin burning against my greedy hand as I rubbed my palm against his prick and arched my front up against Harry’s, rubbing my nipples against his chest.
Ron was in jeans and a dark T-Shirt, the shirt sticking to his large muscled torso as the sweat of his nerves seemed to pour out of his flesh.
Hezian’s eyes darkened into more of a Caribbean hue, the blue of his eyes seeming to diminish in its bright tones and produce a heavy set of severe prominence. “Your boss, Andrew, was found dead the night you went to Astringent to do his dirty work. It seems Andrew got in touch with one of the most dangerous dragon affiliated faction that deals with the dark arts and wizard trafficking. They go by
didn’t say anything about how I looked. I thought I made it obvious that I was checking you out every bloody second of the night in that outfit of yours that has no right to make you look like the finest specimen of a man I’ve ever see-” my words were abruptly cut off when Harry’s handsome features switched into that of viscous victory.
Anyway, I hope you all like this chapter. It was so fun to write. Remember, I have a tumblr blog dedicated to my stories: reimcai. If you want all the news on how my stories go and when updates are going to be released, that it the place to go to! Thank you for the support and love for my stories! It means the world to me. Now, go on and read my perverts!
But I was too bloody stupid to realize that I should have seperated the two same-colored potions from each other so I knew which one was which. I should have also looked at the tube long enough to know that it had a label on it unlike mine.
Walking down the dark path, I finally reached the second to last room on the right, twisting the golden door knob to open the closed door. I stepped into the room with my head bowed to watch where my feet were walking cautiously in case I tripped over anything in the dark lit area I stepped into, my nose picking up the scent of both cigars, cigarettes, and weed.
A rousing wash of heat zipped down my groin and imploded from the tip of my cock, the pleasure hot and fast as I was being made into Harry’s
Zereth raised a brow up at me, a visible mirth and hungered delight flashing in that bright amber gaze of his as he stared down at me, the tendrils of the dark curtain of his hair hanging around his shoulders as he awaited for any words to leave my mouth.
“Stop it!” I chastised myself out loud, my voice ringing with a shrill of rage and mortification throughout the whole of my small studio apartment, breaths wheezing past my mouth as I shoved the palms of my hands into the pillowy surface of my mattress to heave myself up so I could lean my arse against the backs of my calves. I knelt precariously, running my fingers through the mess of my hair and gripping the pale strands to tug on them in a fervor of frustration.
Because I’ve grown impatient now and I want to have my cock inside of you since years ago. Now, open wide,
stripper poles, and if I’m not mistaken, flashes of lace covered women and men clad in lingerie peered out over the tops of the gleaming platforms and around the poles from my peripheral view.
My eyes snapped back over to watch the way Potter’s body tilted towards my person in a predatory fixation, the hunch of his shoulders prominent as he let his head dip forward and the black smoky tendrils of his hair sweep across the smooth skin of his forehead.
Blinking rapidly, I mentally shook away my thoughts, sucking in a sharp breath as I started up the cobbled steps that led to the large entrance doors of the publishing building. I pulled the doors open to step through, sign in at the front desk, and rushed to the elevator to get to the fifth floor where I knew my boss would be waiting for me to hand over my assigned paperwork for the day.
Shaking my head, I walked back out to get to the large white marbled kitchen and rummaged through the large fridge to snack on some cheese and the crackers I found in the cabinets. There was a lot of food but I just wanted a snack so I could get to bed sooner.
I flicked my gaze over the large cherry red painted steel doors, my footsteps faltering when I watched Krum step forward and press the base of his right hand palm over the center of enclosed entrances.
I tried pressing my legs together to keep my erection from showing, but the magic seemed to tighten its hold on my limbs and render me completely too immobile to make so much as a flinch.
Turning slowly on the heels of my combat boots, I started to angle my body away from the group of men, heart racing so profoundly beneath my chest that the thrumming of my organism was so loud in my ears that it seemed to flood out every other sound in my state of unnerved anxiety.
I went limp, all remaining strength in my limbs leaving my body as my mind went into a tunnel of sensation, pleasure rocking my frame as I was forced back and forth onto Harry’s cock, mind numbing down to the only feeling of his dick pistoning in and out like a machine, nonstop and overwhelmingly
It was as if Harry’s voice fused with that of the very devil himself, every dark being flooding themselves in Harry’s vocal chords and coveting both of us as Harry gave a snarl that resembled that of a hellhound, face contorting into dark delight as he watched me rock back and forth in a fever pitch, my cock pulsating and the pleasure building in harsh volumes.
When Harry let his head agonizingly slowly tilt to the side, the tendrils of his obsidian chipped hair brushed across the bronze flesh of his forehead and sharp cheekbones, obscuring the glow of his eerie and brilliant eyes that kept their fixation on my own.
I’ll just stay inside when I’m by myself and prey that I don’t get eaten or mangled throughout my stay here.
.” Harry said his words with a deep growl, so animal like that it made me keen in response from how none human the assassin sounded at the moment, as if he was something demonic.
I quickly put my own clothes back on despite how sticky I was from the sex. And I was too exhausted to care about doing a cleansing spell on myself or Harry. I did, however, pick up my wand and placed it on the arm of the chair to have it with me in case something were to happen.
I let out a sound of frustration, cutting off my cousin’s rant. Letting my hands open and close beside my thighs to form tight clenches of my fists in an attempt to ward off the need to stomp my feet in aggravation and anger, that same burning itch coiled tight in the hollow of my stomach. It grew with every millisecond that I wasn’t out of this guestroom and down in the Chamber where I wanted to be.
The fucking nerve of this man. “S-so you just expect me to do as y-y-you say? Yeah, whatever, P-Potter. Maybe I
The assassin dragged his wet hot tongue teasingly around the surface of my asshole, the sensation of his warm spit seeping into my hole as he spat at it, grunting with hushed cruelty. In a matter of a second, he let the muscle of his tongue push into me with his stupid wandlessly conjured up lube to ease the way along with his spit, parting the skin of the rim of my asshole as if he was gliding into water, easy and slick.
I jabbed my teeth into my lip once more before releasing the skin with a slight pop, my hands curling in on themselves to keep from smacking them against the floor in mortified rage.
Harry’s obsidian locks were pitch black, as if they blended in with the darkest hour of the night, a shadow of sorts that seemed like a black hole. They looked soft and silky, the slight curls and divots of his strands creating an unruly roguish manner about him.
Warmed air hit the bare of my exposed bum now, my gaze large as I stared, dumbly, at the pieces of torn leather fluttering beside my naked thighs.
Blinking profusely in a dizzied manner at the image of Harry literally disappearing from my sight like a fucking
to him anyways, that’s all. It’s not his profession to make sure I don’t get fucked. He’d just be mad if I got physically hurt and would be unable to help with the whole mission process. So-”
And he looked, saddeningly happy, what with his intense wounds and somewhat unnerving, serene smile in all that chaos he wore on himself.
I didn’t have the strength in myself to speak, any words I tried to conjure up out of my mouth halting and choking in the slender of my throat that still tasted like bile from my last throw up session.
Someone walked in to stand beside Sirius, a guy who looked around my age with feathery light brown hair and amber flecked eyes. The boy interrupted my cousin’s words as he rose up on the tip of his toes to draw his face near Sirius’ and brush the bottom of his lip against the black haired man’s cheekbone to whisper words spoken into my cousin’s ears.
Harry had conjured up some vanilla ice cream once I got settled into my own room and given me the delicious delicacy in a shimmering rose wine glass, the sweetened fluffy cold cream plopped into a sugar cone. The Gryffindor just walked right on into my room with an emotionless expression crossed over his handsome features, silently used magic without another given second and watched me squeal with delight when my ice cream literally popped up right in front of me from where I sat on the bed.
Biting down on the wobbling of my bottom lip, I couldn’t stop the way I pushed once again at Harry’s shoulder, wanting to get away from this man as quick and far as possible. He was making me experience feelings that I have never felt before all at once, and I was going mad with it.
I wanted to stick my head in the ground and block out the way the goblins were either leering at Harry and I or sneering our way.
The pretty little princess had no idea that I’ve been watching him for years, even after having graduated from Hogwarts.
” The Gryffindor’s voice represented that of a demonic essence, so very low that I grew restless and
Huffing out a sigh, my chest hummed with satisfaction as I twisted my ankle from one angle to the next in open admiration, the shifting of my movements tiny in an attempt to not show the complete fascination bubbling within my gut at the sight of the heels.
You had a punishment coming to you the moment I watched you sob on the bathroom floor back in Hogwarts, so
The other students that weren’t seventh of eighth years were already in their cozy assigned house dorm rooms, creating an unsettling silence around the small group that my body and my friends’ created.
I felt the hot heat of Potter’s thigh push up into the sprawl of my legs, dragging up the insides of my own jean clad thighs as he shoved his muscular leg up against the bottom of my throbbing cock and arse.
With a quick side glance towards Harry’s way, I knew by the neutral expression splayed across the striking of his features, that the assassin had used wandless magic on my body and glamored my skin to be clear of the tattoos I had inherited just a few minutes ago as well as giving me proper clothes to wear.
My body jerked over both the men, heat shooting into my veins when I felt the large, hot hand of Neville’s come down in a resounding slap over the back of my right thigh right below the swell of my bum, the skin beneath my jeans screaming out in burning pinpricks while my perking cock was forced to rub up against the side of Neville’s right thigh from how my body jostled up at the way the Gryffindor having quiet literally
The jaded glow of his eyes seemed to encase his gaze in a shadowed green color that seemed to pierce into my own as they collided with mine.
My goal was to look great tonight, for myself and for Harry, but the Gryffindor didn’t even compliment on how I looked when we were both done getting ready to go to the Weasleys'.
” I mumbled, biting down on my lip to keep myself from smiling so wide that I'd start to probably look like a psychopath if so, watching Harry from beneath my eyelashes.
I didn’t dare talk back then. My body growing hot at Potter’s silent demand of me to keep quiet although I didn’t want it to.
Finally reaching the top of the hill, wet and tired, I trudged on over to the front entrance of the mansion where large Italian wooden doors towered over my frame in a looming sense of intimidation, the handles a large circular ring steel nob that I had to grasp onto with a heavy breath of strain from how bloody heavy the thing was, and pull it towards my figure to open up the large door.
I didn’t hold back the disgusted curl of my mouth, a drench of trepidation and disturbed countenance flooding my system from what Hezian was telling me.
Dark crimson blood oozed out from where both ends of the dagger stuck out of Kingsley’s head, running across the floor and pooling around my bare feet.
I was in a slight daze from such a quick apparition that my head was still trying to wrap itself around what was happening around me.
“H-Harry … do you really want this? I-I-I’m not experienced and I’m not that good looking nor-” My voice broke off into a shrill squeak, interrupting my stream of nerved words, when I felt the heat of Harry’s large, heated hands curl the long of his burning fingers around the width of the front of my thighs. The Gryffindor dug the blunt of his nails sharply into the apex sensitivity of my flesh to grasp ahold of the trembling of my limbs in an ironclad grip to forcefully and with a careless ease, yank my legs further apart and shove me up onto the weak of my knees, my breath whooshing out of my lungs with a stuttered sort of air as Harry caused my arse to perch up high into the air.
Rolling my bottom lip into my mouth so I could suckle at the flesh there, I made a fast track towards the bathroom of my room, bare feet slapping against the cool marble tile as I rounded into the area and swiftly turned my body to face the wall to wall mirror in front of me.
I could hear my name being repeated, over and over again, passed his quivering mouth as I watched his head loll like a lifeless puppet as his body went liquid gold in my hands and his knees gave out from under him, eyes rolling to the back of his head in anadulturated bliss from his released arousal.
I often found myself with the planes of my back hunched and tensed, shoulder blades sharpening out to hiss at moist air, a spark of scalding liquid dripping into the caverns of my heated gut like an acidic bite as my head bows in constraint. My palms would shake, splayed out against any solid ground to keep myself
*Breathes deeply* I give you all a new chapter! This one took a toll on me because Harry, in this story, is a very complex person and I had a roller coaster ride with the way Harry acted and the way he expressed himself in this particular chapter. He's a difficult character in my vision, a dark one at that, and it's even harder to express it to you readers in the best way that I can. I hope you love this update, because I had a ton of fun writing it. I know I said that I will try getting my next update released on the weekend, but I don't think I can with my work getting in the way, I'm so sorry. So the next update will be on a Monday instead or if I get it done earlier, I'll post it on a late Sunday night.
I could feel myself being watched, the hazed spell of sleep slowly dissipating from the darkness of my vision and waking mind as the soft breathing escaping my breath mingled together with the other person’s own inhale and exhales that echoed throughout the entirety of my room.
“H-Harry?” I spoke out through the pressuring quiet of the hallway, my voice high and nervous as I suckled at my bottom lip and looked back up at the man as I twitched about in an effort to try and get myself out of the magic hold.
I tried to catch my uneven breaths, eyes widened at having to be in this position and predicament while I whipped my gaze up to stare at both Neville and Harry beneath the flutter of my confounded pale lashes, the sensation of heat threatening to flood up my neck and spread out over my cheeks when my ears rang with the mocking laughter coming from the men around me.
Harry let out a contemplative hum, husked and deep, his burning eyes watching me for a good few silent seconds before I released a squawk of surprise when I felt his hips thrust up minutely in a quick manner, causing my body to bounce up and down across his lap.
I decided to completely ignore Harry’s suggestion, trepidation flooding my system at the fact that I didn’t mind having to do what the assassin said.
With a blurring motion, Harry’s right hand found its way through the tousled mess of my hair, wrapping the strands around his wrist and into the palm of his heated hand to secure the soft of my hair in his grip with an air of terrifying demand.
Harry’s hands were off of me, the touch of his skin against my own gone. I was left panting across the space of the floor I found myself sprawled over on the flat of my tummy, the cold, black shimmering marble of the ground eliciting a shiver to race down my spine and confusion to mar the bubbling heat in my stomach. There was no sign of the assassin anywhere near, just a quiet that made the hollow of my ears ring with the pounding of my heart. “H-Harry? Where are you? W-What’s happen-”
I was bent at my knees, hunched over and chest heaving up and down in a quick pace as the realization of the amount of happiness I just got from taking the literal
Hezian’s face becoming a blur in an instant and that yucky gut twisting sensation hit my body all at once with the spell.
I knew I couldn’t force Potter to stop whatever he was doing to the vampire physically, and I had no magic to prevent the Chosen One from killing the creature.
The burly guard’s blue gaze slid down the length of my body and back up, not in a way that was heated or taken for a blunt appraisal of my person, but in way that shown he was analyzing me as his job required him to do.
And now the edibles were in Harry’s left hand, the plastic of the bag dangling precariously off the tip of his middle finger while I felt my mouth part on an intake of breath in surprise and irritation.
An ache formed where the teeth embedded themselves as I writhed under the man, eyes glazing over as Harry did four mind-numbing slaps across my bum, my cheeks flesh burning and most likely bruising and breaking at the skin, sobs spilling from my mouth as tears dragged themselves down my cheeks with every violent slap of Harry’s palm across my bum.
Dread fell over me. I had no way of protecting myself. No wand, no switchblade on me, hidden beneath my pillow where I should have grabbed it before the man came barging into my room. With the way Kingsley was looking at me, half out of his damned mind, I had a feeling I was going to get hurt.
Grinding on Harry’s lap as he delivered one smack after the other, my mind was in a daze as I peered at the assassin to watch his gaze shift away from my eyes and stare with a perverse danger at my rocking arse, taking solace in the hurt and heat he created on and in me.
The Gryffindor had the audacity look back up at me from beneath the unruly locks of his pitch black hair that swept across the glow of his blood red and jaded eyes, the image achingly gorgeous and causing my breath to stall in my throat at the look on Harry’s face.
I then heard Weasley’s apparating spell pop into the space in front of me before the redhead's body even appeared, indicating his arrival and my time to get up from my crouching stance as I slowly rose to my feet at the given moment he shown up.
The truth of the matter was that I was gay but I didn’t like having sex regularly because the past  people that I let stick their pricks into me were complete strangers and made me feel like shite afterwards. So I decided that I could be celibate until I had someone I actually loved and trusted and knew enough to see me in such a vulnerable state and treated me the way I wanted to be treated, like a slut but a princess at the same time, and give me the care and affection I shamefully craved compared to the “useless fuck hole” that I felt like I was when I let those men fuck me before.
And it was marvelous, but I was starting to lose consciousness from how much the Assassin was fucking up into me.
I swallowed around a suddenly dry mouth, any moisture that conjured itself up into the space behind the slight open gape of my lips, was significantly gone. A cotton ball fixated dryness remained in my mouth that reminded me of the sensation of someone going without any semblance of water in the bloody Sahara desert.
I liked having to work alone when it came to these kinds of things, especially if it had to deal with potions. I needed to be in my own head and think clearly without getting input on anyone else's end until I was done with my thoughts and was ready for another’s opinion.
Pursing the moue of my mouth, I dragged my bottom lip between my teeth, gazing down at my figure in both trepidation and anticipation, giddiness flooding my system but anxiety coveting my frame nonetheless.
Weasley had come practically popping into the room and told me that I wouldn’t be needing any of my stuff with where we were headed for my safety.
Inhaling a long breath through my nose, I released a whoosh of exasperated air, the strain in my shoulders loosening some from my annoyance with Blaise. Pressing my lips together softly, I looked away from the Slytherin to gaze out at the crowd of students in the dining hall.
Although with both of our words said and out of the way now, I did feel ten times better but I was still worried about the state of my magic.
A shot of dark electricity shot down my spine and back up as I turned my back to Harry, the air blowing out of my parted mouth at the sudden covetous sinister air that surrounded my frame in a brush of such an overwhelming heated impression.
But Harry’s voice coaxed me to disregard the warning in the back of my head to stay away from this man, alluring and inescapable.
The unmistakable prod of the demon’s cock along the cleft of my ass had me freezing for only a given second before I snapped.
Harry continued on with more of his low words in the eerie silence of the forest as we trudged on through the trees and leaves beneath the navy blue of the shimmering night sky above us. “That’s also where Sirius, Caetia, Granger and Weasley are waiting for us. And on the subject about Krum, you just need to know that he’s with his wife in New Orleans right now. I sent a magical telepathic link to him before everything happened and told him to get out immediately, which he did. He’s going to be sad about what happened with his club but he has to deal with it. I’ll help him make a new one later. As for answering the other questions I know you’ve been dying to ask me, that’s going to have to wait until we get to my friend’s place.”
What I feared the most was that once I killed this man before me, then my magic and my mind would somehow mold together and cause me to take pleasure in the act of murdering this poor wizard.
And yet I was still so absurdly mortified at the situation I found myself in, too insecure to follow through with Harry’s demand for the sole reason of fearing he wouldn’t like what he sees or feels when he creates pleasure upon my person, the hysteria of my low self-esteem an annoying tick in the back of my skull that I wanted to claw away at and scurry it back into its cellar of self induced depravity.
to come true. Harry probably simply just wanted his coffee cream and brought me the plates for the sole reason of wanting to eat and drink quicker.
“You’re aroused, Malfoy. I wonder why?” The last statement that Potter spoke was dipped in a saccharine, dark taunt, lowered into that of a mocking cadence.
My tongue, I shit you not, lolled out of my mouth at the sensation of being so wonderfully filled up that I came again, dry and rung out from the simple feeling of Harry coming inside of me.
“H-Harry-” My voice was strained with nerves, my words being swallowed within the half of my choked fear as I wobbled on my horribly wobbling legs, my head twisting around Harry’s person to catch sight of what the assassin had shot without blinking an eye.
And when Harry dropped my leg that he had held open with his hand to slam his palm against the wall to my side, he went even
“You left me with people whom I barely even knew and trusted. You didn’t even ask me if I was alright with your decision in leaving me there with Hezian and Cho. My parents did that to me often times when I was younger and it always left a sour taste in my mouth, like they didn’t care about my well being, their own child, as they left me with strangers constantly while they went and did Voldemort’s biddings.” I let the words flow from the slight part of my dry mouth, letting my tongue flick out along the bottom expanse of my lip to give some sort of moisture over the drying gloss of my mouth.
Caetia blinked for a moment, a look of befuddled shock and surprise passing his features briefly before his lips tipped up into a sly grin. “Good.”
When my eyes drew down to the wand settled in Harry’s hand, the man let the stick shift through the splay of space between his fingers, flicking it around in an easy gesture, nonchalant as he practically swung the dangerous object within his hand, his eyes settled onto the unnerved features of my warmed face, a sense of dread and a zing of heat shooting straight into my prick and flooding it with consuming blood and
“Still full of sass, I see. Why don’t you stop trying to burn me alive with your eyes and take a look around you. I’ll explain to you what’s happening when you do.” Granger’s response was haughty and dipped in amused filter.
And I was breathing faster by each passing second, my lungs inflating with too much oxygen as the air in my skull began to thin out in a habitual panicking manner. “Why do these creatures only mess with … with my kind?” My voice came out in a soft shake as I looked up at Harry once again to watch as he gazed down at me with the focus of a hawk, harsh and assessing, hungry and dark in its stare.
My words came out stilted in an octave lower, rasping out of my tense jaw, the sharp of my cheekbones seeming to grow rigid as I yanked Draco’s leg that I had in an iron grip towards me the same time I pummeled forward, air cracking out of my lungs as I felt the searing clutch of Draco’s hole seize around my cock and pump my prick with a frantic suck.
Harry’s unnerving calm anger pummeling its way towards my writhing form as the song came to an end, my gaze once again snapping away from his as I finished up my last moves and stood up to lean my back against the pole to grind up against it as the music reached its finality.
of me, I had gone limp and tired and my poor prick couldn’t release any more of it’s pleasure, leaving me practically being fussed around and used for Harry’s simple pleasure.
Just the scent and the heat radiating off of the Gryffindor’s body behind me, as well as the barely there touch of his long, smooth fingers against my neck, made me
“It would be very much appreciated if you didn’t open that fish mouth of yours and talk about my appearance as if I was some sort of object. And let’s be honest here, last time I saw you, you had pushed me down a flight of stairs back in Hogwarts during the triwizard tournament. Don’t act like you like me when you don’t.” There was no fluctuation in my voice, just pure admission and a bluntness that sounded like my words could cut through marble.
I realized that the whole of person had hunched forward, my chest rising and falling sharply with my mouth parted to breathe in oxygen that I felt like I couldn’t get enough to stave off of, my chest hollow and the sound of rushed rain catering to my hearing.
“Hold still.” By the thunderous rasp of Harry’s voice shoving its way inside and around me in an alarming inflection, all of the tensed fixture in my limbs had become soft, the rough sound causing my frame to fall into Harry’s arms even more as I breathed out a shocked gasp of dismay and mortification.
My brows drew in together in concentration, fingers wiggling about to try and grasp a plate only to have the air in my lungs stutter to a halt when I felt the long line of a hard chest and abs press up against the shivering form of my bowed back, my feet skittering across the floor when my body jolted from its position at the sudden heated contact of another body.
Harry raised his right hand out of his pocket, resting his curled knuckles beneath the curved, sharp line of his cheek to let the pad of his thumb sweep across the succulent skin of the bottom corner of his lip, the motion slow and deliberate as those green of his eyes went into a shade of a midnight laced jade.
I didn’t want to know how Granger got my exact sizes for my clothes and how she knew about some of my fashion senses and interests.
And we were going to talk about his manipulative ways to get a rise out of me. That whole jealousy thing between Harry and I situation made me completely lose it as well as made Harry kill someone over me for fucks sake!
There was the nagging sensation, searing and wanton that coursed through my frame at the idea of having someone have complete control over me, mentally and physically sexually. When I was in my Seventh year in Hogwarts, I had snuck into the Hufflepuff's quarters during Halloween. I had heard rumors that the surprisingly filthy group of Hufflepuff’s indulge themselves in sex parties each year during Halloween and I grew curious enough to ditch my school work and sneak into their facilities to be gobsmacked at the way they were treating each other. The Hufflepuffs were naked and they were sexing each other up with whips and chains and simple smacks and other such BDSM etiquette.
to me and you so obviously despise being in the same bloody room as me, s-so why the hell would I tell you I like you when I know you don’t feel an ounce of the same feelings as I have f-f-for you!”
Draco was beautifully tantalizing and sexy to the eye, carrying an elegant yet focused presence he held about himself that made others and myself want to slam the cute boy up against the nearest wall and fuck him into a
Harry leaned over my body, pressing into my back from behind as he shoved his hips forward and made my knees skid across the floor while my hands grappled for the ground to keep my balance, the crane of my neck bare as I swallowed nervously.
It was as if I was treading on fine waters near a living and breathing predator aware of my every movement, a calculating severity that embodied the entirety of Harry’s ominous persona.
My chaotic thoughts were interrupted once Harry pulled me into his arms some more as if he was trying to mold himself into me, a solid warm reality and grounding foundation. The mere action of it had made me cry even more as I mewled out pathetically in the apex of my strained mental state, hiccupping out incoherent words of how much shit I had to go through for the past month and how scared I was. And how much I wanted Harry to come and get me out of the hell I was in.
hell?” My words were a disturbance to the quiet in the bathroom, broken at the pitch as a horrified mortification and befuddlement cascaded into the pit of my stomach, my cheeks hinting at a pink flush that rendered me speechless.
My being seen in public could alert any lurking members of Animadverto of my presence and further expand the possibility of them targeting me right then and there and Harry was not having any of that.
Harry Potter looked like a damn demon that’s goal was to only fuck, devilishly handsome and dirty but magnetizing in the way he moved his body.
“How did you get the papers to Trisko? You were the last to see him before someone found him dead, if I’m correct with the information I’ve gathered.” The Auror looked at me with a narrow in his light brown eyes, obvious suspicion etched deep into the creases of skin beside his eyes. And that made me pissed off.
That’s when the Assassin decided to drop me back onto my feet with an easy plop, my heels clicking against the marbled stage as I staggered somewhat from the quick movement, blinking rapidly against the fluorescent glowing lights above both our heads as I now stood in front of Harry who stared down at me from his towering height down the length of his nose, all consuming and downright menacing in the cold silent anger he emitted right at the moment.
I would have to save my panic attack about the new found information I had about myself for a later time.
Harry moved in closer, pressing the hard of his abdomen right up against my back, my body consequently being shoved forward and drug up the seat of the leather at the impact of the warmed, muscled body of the assassin's crowding in one me and attaching itself to the arch of my back like Harry was trying to mold himself
“I’m glad to to see that the clothes I got you fit so well. Although those jeans are practically cupping your cute arse cheeks rather
Harry’s magic made me want to jump off of the nearest cliff and douse myself beneath hundreds of pounds of water in hopes to escape from
I started to kick and scream, voice rising high in my hysteria as my vision started to explode with both white and black, the screech of my yell echoing and popping my own eardrums as I thrashed wildly beneath Zereth’s heavy body.
But I wouldn't dwell on the many times I could have had Draco beneath me, crying out so sweetly with my prick inside him and rearranging his insides, no, because I have him now. And I still wasn’t done with him, not in the nearest.
Right now though, I was showing how much of a Malfoy I was and that surely wouldn’t get me on Potter’s good side.
I realized that Potter was probably never going to see me the way I saw him. He was also dating that redheaded sister of Weasley’s, Ginny, back then. I thought he was straight. Well, up to the point where I just saw him fucking a boy like he had done it many times already.
Harry disregarded me as I practically became a live Muppet in his hands, my lips pulled up into a crazed grimace as I tried to swing my arms back and forth, urging my hands to smack at Harry’s chest as he dangled me with no effort whatsoever above the floor. Like a rag doll.
My mouth popped open wide to release a squeak when the soles of my bare feet sloshed into a body of cool water hidden beneath the fine mist surrounding the entirety of the rock and sand coveted floor, the tips of my feet sinking into the wet ground, moist sand seeping in between the wriggling of my toes as I took a momentary motionless stand still in surprise from the sudden sensation of feeling a pool of water I carelessly stepped into.
“I’m not a fucking pony show. Mind your own business,” I snarked, voice coming out in a sharp hiss that rendered the others around me immobile for a moment from my tone before they brought their heads down to get back to doing their personal work.
Of course Potter taught his best friend an ancient form of magic. I bet Potter used the damn spell often, and if Weasley was telling the truth about not getting tired from doing this sort of magic, then he must have upped his skill in the magic arts.
And with the way I was raised as a child, I couldn’t help but be a bitch in exchange for the hurt I was feeling. In the heat of the moment, I was so angered and ashamed and burning up from the Gryffindor that I had raised my left hand on instinct to ball my fingers up into my palm with the intention to slam it against the hard wall of Potter’s chest, letting out a small sound of agitation with a small curl of my lip.
