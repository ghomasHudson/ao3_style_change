“With the Chosen One so close, who could resist a peek at the goods?” says Draco, the corner of his mouth upturned.
"Right." Harry believes him, but only because Charlie's not really the type of person to lie about it. "Let me ask you something, then. If ... if you have this person you'd hated the entire time you knew them in school. Who hated you probably even more, and there was so,
Pansy shrugs and finally plucks up a piece of maki, but she doesn’t put it in her mouth. “Maybe,” she says. “She clearly likes Draco. Besides,” she grins a bit now, “I’d kind of like to get a look at her in person these days.”
Harry laughs, but it’s really just an exhale. “Fair.” He slides off and out of Draco and curls him into his side, stroking the damp hair from his forehead. “I suppose I should thank that Charms specialist."
When Harry stops coming, Draco says, “mm.”
“Sorry,” Harry snorts, moving his hand back down to Draco’s thigh. Draco bites his lip. Harry notices.
Potter is unnerved, and Draco feels somewhat more relaxed for it. He waves a hand. “Only coke.”
“You weren’t exactly discrete. And it’s not table service, you know.”
The fork is a proxy for Malfoy's neck, which he would like to be squeezing. Preferably until his eyeballs swell cartoonishly and then pop. It would be incredibly cathartic to do that, and not just because he's proper fucking annoying. Also because the longer he's forced to look at him the more Harry is forced to acknowledge a disturbing ... attractiveness about him. The flushed cheeks and the long, slim throat and especially the way Hermione's merlot (which he and Ron refuse to drink, seeing as it's fucking rancid) has stained his lips a bit red.
“Don’t worry. I’m sure even my strap would wilt in the face of all that righteous indignation.”
“You’re doing it. You’re being annoying.”
Entirely ignoring Justin and Lavender (although the Justin of it is kind of poetic), Harry says, more quietly, “Yeah,
, is it not?”
And, of course, Harry knows Malfoy is gay. He’s at a gay bar. Harry’s just seen a man licking spirits from his abdomen. He reads the papers (or rather, Hermione reads the papers, and tells Harry the important bits.) He knows that the Wizarding public has been able to forgive their Saviour things they’ve never forgiven Malfoy for; his sexuality, his promiscuity.
“It means impermanent. Transitory. Ad interim,” says Draco, because it’s fun to watch Potter’s neck get all indignantly flushed when he’s patronising.
Pansy had nagged him, though. And Potter would be there. An entirely neutral environment where Draco would be able to be observed being unbothered and aloof and making out with much fitter blokes, but not approached. So it didn't end up taking too much nagging, after all.
"I called you an idiot. Halfwit. Imbecile." Draco bites into the flesh of his lip when Potter grips harder on his hip. "Do keep up."
"Right," says Harry, "guess I'm leaving then." Leave it to Malfoy to ruin his plans. He trudges out of the water, grabs his socks and trainers, folds down his trousers, and gives Malfoy an ironic little salute.
"Well?"
“Yeah.” He leans back against a counter and looks at Ron, arms crossed, brows raised, knowing why he’s here and wondering if he’ll let Harry keep dodging around it. “Too bad he’s shit at repairing all my glass he’s broken.”
“Have you got sausages?”
the hell is going on out here?"
"Perhaps your father wasn't as much of an utter despot as mine," Draco says, waiting until he can be certain in the stability of his voice before he speaks. Lucius has been like this for quite some time now, since Azkaban and maybe even a little bit before, but still it unnerves him. His father has never been terribly warm, but Draco doesn't remember his eyes being quite so frigid when he left for France as they were when he got back. Now they're worse, all milky and gelid, and Draco doesn't want to look at them.
It’s not the reveal to Draco that it seems to be for Potter. Yes, he likes to be ordered around sometimes. He also likes a pretty mouth around his cock, and for it to do exactly as he says. Draco is
The lights above them change from strobing white to deep, rolling blues and purples, slipping empyreal shadows back and across Draco’s face. Harry takes a deep breath. And dives back in. “My hands?”
Grabbing Malfoy’s jumper off the ground, he brings it to him and hands it over. “Maybe we just take it a day at a time,” he says. “I’m gonna have to deal with Ron and Hermione.”
“Oxygen,” Draco mumbles, soundly completely hoarse and spent and indecently fucked-out.
"Thanks," he says when a cup is set down in front of him. "There's sugar in the cupboard over the sink, can you grab it?"
. Draco says, "I think you like the thought of that a little too much. Do try not to drool on me," and then yelps when Potter starts pinching a bridge between his hip bones.
Draco looks at Harry for a second, and then says, “
“No,” he answers after a moment. Honestly, he can’t remember well enough to say it with one hundred percent certainty, but he dislikes the implication. “Were you?”
"The only thing gagging is your ego for a flattering. Go bask in the adoration of some fourth-year bints and leave me the fuck alone," Draco says. He turns, banging his way back through the swinging glass doors and into the greenhouse.
"I always slept through everything," Neville says miserably.
speaking to him is Malfoy. It’s been two weeks. And he’s been very satisfied with the indirect answer he got to that rather bold assertion, but he feels guilty now too. And if he gets any drunker, he’s going to do something stupid probably.
“Roqberry’s fine,” says Draco. He vanishes the rest of his coffee, and elbows Granger as he does because she’s looking all smug around a mouthful of lettuce. “Their breakfast blend is terribly bitter.”
“So glad you’re joining us, Malfoy,” he says sarcastically, “what would we have done without your pretentious French food? Perished under the weight of our lack of culture, surely. Thank god you’re here to save us.
“Enough,” Pansy says. It’s not
"If you call me that, I get to waterboard you."
“Exclusively,” Draco says. He adds, in jest, “I’ve evolved.”
"Finally ditching the glasses?"
He shouldn’t have. Hermione would do her nut, if she knew (do-you-

And that was where Harry walloped him with a pillow and did some very useful reading on Self Obliviation. He’s suffered enough for one lifetime.
’s of surprise and then, very quickly, whines of abject pleasure.
“I finished,” he says.
“You feel good,” Harry expands. He wants to take Draco’s lips between his again, he wants to slide his hands firmly along the pale curve of his waist, wants to kiss and bite, wants to feel a delicate swell against his cock instead of the tight seam of his jeans. But he’s pathetic. And he can’t.
There's a sense of being exposed, so excruciatingly seen, that makes Draco's teeth click with a hate so intense he thinks he might scream. Nails in his palms to keep from shaking, he says, "Whatever deluded little gay crisis you're suffering, Potter, I didn't ask to be the object of it."
"I'm afraid I'd accidentally kill you," says Harry. "We can put a pin in that one. So who was the bloke?"
“Fine,” says Draco. “You’re nice to look at.”
With unbearable effort, he pulls out and (biting down too-hard on his lip) manages to shove his throbbing prick back into his boxers and zip up. "Get your robes on," he says, "quickly."
the Weasel would've told Granger. She's no better than Pansy. "And, no, Potter, as you're not an employee of St Mungo's, I had no fucking clue you'd be here tonight. If I had, I wouldn't have come. Or I'd at least have brought a bucket. Are we done?"
"I'm versatile. I don't think you are.
"Great," Harry says sarcastically, "have fun with him. Just make sure you let me know so I can find something else to do that night."
"Splendid," says Draco. "That'll throw her off the scent."
He thinks,
Draco opens his mouth to say; you’re not a normal person, but then his wand starts to vibrate incessantly against his wrist. “
“I s’pose you should cover them,” says Harry regretfully. “They’re quite — erm — noticeable.”
“Right, yeah,” Draco scoffs. “That ended well.”
"That's a little dramatic, it's only been twice," Harry points out. "But fine,

"The lengths you'll go to to be able to say you're right, Merlin—"
, only Pansy very much enjoys it when she has the time. She sits down again and gestures for Draco to do the same. "I don't know what you mean,
“You’re really fucking hard."
Malfoy actually
“No spiel,” Ginny says. From the kitchen, Mum’s reprimanding Charlie for the size of his julienned carrot sticks. “Just curious.”
,” Pansy insists, though she’s still smirking. “Just looking.” She sticks the sushi in her mouth finally, chews, swallows, and then knocks back the rest of her drink. “I’m gonna do it,” she says. “I can’t watch Draco pine over Potter or whatever he’s doing, it’s unhealthy and more importantly, he’s no fun when he’s doing it.” She picks up another maki and holds it up to Blaise’s mouth. “Now open up, pet. We did come here to eat, did we not?”
. A delightful plot twist.
“Mm hm,” says Draco. “I’m off.” He’s not, really, for another twenty minutes at least. But it’s either stay, and fall asleep in the middle of an Epinsky, and literally disfigure someone, or knock off a bit early. “Back at seven tomorrow. I’ll keep my pockets empty.”
That stings a little. Harry frowns, telling himself it’s just Draco being Draco, they most certainly
“Both have their merits,” Harry admits.
After a minute of heavy breathing and rutting his hips softly through the come-down, Draco murmurs, “Yes.” The mattress he’s been pinned to for the better part of an hour is a little damp with his own sweat and come, but it’s warm and smells so thoroughly like Harry underneath. Turning slowly on his side and only then realising there’s a cock still inside him, Draco gives a satisfied little huff. “Sleeping here,” he says, eyes closed.
“That’s Sirius,” says Draco, pointing to the brightest star in the swirl above them. It’s a little dizzying, lying on the solid ground beside the fire, surrounded by the familiar scent of wine and warmth and Draco, but looking up at so much deep, dark sky. Harry pushes his knee further between Draco’s.
He knows it’s not because of That, because That happened over the summer holidays (in the room next to Harry, with alarming frequency and volume), and Ron finally stopped smirking about it like a complete twerp months ago.
“Kay,” says Malfoy.
“Of course she did,” says Blaise. “But I want the details from the Hippogriff’s mouth and I've waited long enough, frankly. Tell me, was he actually good at it?”
“‘Rough and angry’?” Harry says sardonically. “That was part of your brief explanation, was it?”
“More,” Draco says, head thrown back so he can just see the stars beyond the roof of the parapet. His cock ruts again Harry’s midriff as he’s fucked, smooth and warm and taut.
“Second from the, ah, ngghh, the sun.” Even Harry knows that’s wrong, and he thinks he probably only paid less attention in Divination than Astronomy.
Pansy lets out a laugh of disbelief that quickly loses its humour. "You aren't serious," she says. And suddenly Draco's foul temper is beginning to make more sense. "Oh ... my god, did you not finish somewhere else?"
Using her free hand, Pansy removes first one shoe and then the other, setting both aside and out of harm's reach. "Well are you going to tell me the reason then? I assume it isn't simply that he's a prat and you hate him, since that seems obvious."
at fucking, I'm much more concerned with you enjoying yourself for a few minutes. When was the last time you had a good dicking, Draco,
He disappears into the kitchen with Seamus grumbling and Dean taking the piss out of him, and Harry barely has any time to start feeling guilty for wishing they'd all fuck off sometime soon before Ron's joining him with that look on his face like he's concerned but pretending not to be so Harry doesn't bite his head off.
"Course, mate," Ron says. "Thinking I'll do a roast."
“Good.” Harry releases his cock and tongues the slit, eliciting an easy hiss from Draco. “Start talking, then.”
Harry laughs and swipes a thumb along Draco’s bottom lip, wet with spit. “It’s just endearing is all,” he says. “How much you want me.”
A great, weathered arch has been cut from Déshabillé’s backmost stone wall. (Harry knows it filters out into what functions as a beer garden between the hours of eleven am and five. A courtyard filled with polished wood trestle tables and cordoned with velvet ropes — before the end of the night, it’ll be closed off completely by a rolling door of corrugated iron. Harry knows this not because he’s a particularly frequent patron, but only because he might’ve thought on one of his few previous visits, and in a spectacularly intoxicated state, that it would be a good idea to bet the bloke he’d been drinking with that he could slide under it as it closed. He was right. Only then, he was trapped in a deserted beer garden and had to scale the fence (he grazed his knee), stumble to a phone box (too drunk to Apparate, too far from any Wizarding establishment to Floo) and call Hermione to come fetch him (and she had, the angel).)
Sitting back on his heels, Draco bites gently at Harry's wiry inner thigh, just because it's there. "I'm surprised," he murmurs.
“Of course not,” Pansy says, and strokes the hair off his forehead, and Draco knows she’s being patronising.
"Well I don't," Ron says. "Harry, Malfoy's been a shit to you as long as you've known him. To us, too. I know Hermione likes him, and for her sake I'll try my best with him, but Merlin, she's a better person than I am, forgiving all the things he's done. It still makes my blood boil, you know? The way he used to talk to her. To you, too."
Grinning, Harry says, "You don't know a fucking thing about me."
"Welcome back," he says.
Draco is, in fact, wearing pants. However, they cover about as much skin as a piece of the fucking cooking twine Molly uses to truss up her Sunday roasts.
"Pansy," she says. "It's nice to see you. I received your letter, obviously. Can I assume this is about Draco and Harry?"
“Mate,” says Ron, grinning broadly, “that’s Malfoy! Hey, ferret face! Harry, Malfoy.”
Harry drops his head back on the pillow and sighs. “I said

Harry decides to ignore him. This can’t possibly take that long, it’s not as if it’s a Muggle lift running on electricity.
“Just that you might like to. It’s not good to suppress that temper of yours, you know.”
“I see,” Pansy teases. “So there was foreplay. And with no kissing? That’s interesting.” She leans back in her chair again, utterly fascinated. Clearly Potter had tapped into that part of Draco Pansy had only actually witnessed once (on a very memorable, very treasured occasion) and heard about in spades. Usually he’s not so defensive about it, but it is
“Yeah,” Harry says gruffly. He looks at the doorway to the living room, through which he can see Neville helping to light the bong while Luna hits it, and then down at the kitchen floor. “The other night. I was angry he talked to Hermione about what happened in the lift.” A long pause, and he shrugs. “I was just looking for an excuse to see him. He knew it, too.”
Draco’s amused sneer curls into something sour before he can stop it. “I told you last time we spoke,” he says, “that I don’t give a fucking shit. You pulled out, I went home, I found someone else to finish the job. This is getting tedious, Potter.”
Harry has to pause for a moment and restrain himself from doing something he shouldn't, like causing Malfoy's wine glass to explode in his hand for instance, since that would probably end with glass in his eye. Some part of him would also be okay with hauling him out of his chair, pinning him against the wall, and tasting his stupid wine-stained lips.
“Mum loves Lucius more than has ever been good for her.”
“Feels good,” he manages, because he does want that. Wants it, wants it, wants it.
“But you are my lover,” insists Harry, shifting his hand so it’s teasing the head of Draco’s cock through his wool trousers. “Keep telling me about the stars, lover.”
“Yes,” Draco says. He picks up his teaspoon and flips it around between his fingers. “Briefly.”
“Want it now,” Draco tells him.
“Not where I would’ve expected to find you,” Harry says. He rests a hand on top of the white marble tomb, feeling its chill. Imagining Dumbledore in there with the Elder Wand. “You come out here a lot?”
"That sounds nice," he says. "How's your mum?"
Well fuck. “'Twasn’t an offer. Simply attempting to educate the ignorant.”
"Course."
since he's gotten off with anyone. He shifts and lifts his hips again and groans when their cocks brush. "Shit," he breathes. His other hand finds purchase on Charlie's shoulder. "Charlie, I'm not gonna last long."
Draco’s arse is bare—
“Come back,” he says. “Need it.”
He stares at Malfoy another second, all white hair and tantalising grey eyes, and Harry pushes him lightly back against the wall of the lift.
Mental note; debrief with Harry about what emotions seeing Draco again brought up for him, et cetera. She’ll do it later. Right now, she’s busy being completely narked off.
“Yeah, that’s what I mean,” Ron says reluctantly. “Harry. What’re we gonna do about him.”
"Well, that's true," Luna says sensibly, which finally makes Harry burst out laughing. "Of course, they're not really potatoes, they're only called that because they're plump and brown. And they do get very cold in the winter, which is why they hide in people's jackets."
“Pot,” says Harry. “Kettle.”
Warmth spreading over his own — that’s spunk — that’s Draco’s spunk, and that’s Draco making those brilliant, desperate little sounds as his cock paints it over the inside of his stupid-hot, stupid-
“Alright,” Pansy allows once they’re settled and basking in the glow of the fairy lights and the view, “this was a fantastic idea.”
Draco lies next to Harry, who looks as if he's sleeping, with his eyes closed and dark lashes heavy on his cheeks, but is actually murmuring in Draco's ear. Dapples of moonlight fractured through water and window fall on his face, and the moss-coloured silk sheets bunched up around his torso make him look like some kind of Pre-Raphelite angel. Draco wants very much to kiss him.

it, but also he hates it. "But yeah. At least let me know or something. Sorry for yelling at you."
. Just because you and Parkinson have no boundaries to speak of doesn't mean we all have. And you can't even just fucking apologise, can you?"
Ron rolls his eyes. “Yeah, cheers to that. Wish Fred could’ve heard about the Malfoy thing, he’d have knocked some sense into Harry right quick.”
“It’s your decision, mate. I think it’s a bad idea. Hermione’ll go spare if she finds out I discouraged you, though. Whatever. Just be careful. I still don’t trust him, alright?”
"I should hope so," says Blaise. He walks in front of Pansy and Draco like he wishes he had a cape for them to hold, parting the crowds with little flicks of his wrist. "The fact that you're a stellar fuck and one of my nearest and dearest shan't help you in the slightest if you stock my bars with shitty spirits, my dear."
Narcissa nearly starts. She’s taken so surprise by the rapid topic change — and to something she so violently does not want to talk about — that it takes her a moment to compose herself. It breaks her heart to know her son is an adult now, capable of his own decisions and opinions and with the freedom to do as he pleases. She misses her small boy with his easy laughter and his trivial tantrums.
Discomfort twists his insides into a hot chord. “Don’t cosset me, Potter. You’re not saying anything,” Draco says.
Draco says, “Rather understandable. I think Umbridge would take to your relatives.”
“Not much at all. I’m very busy. The life of a gentleman of leisure, and so on.”
"Yes, Hermione," Harry says without missing a beat. "He makes me extremely uncomfortable. Not to be crude but if you half-shagged someone you used to hate in a lift and then got utterly rejected by him the next second you'd be uncomfortable too."
"Dear god, Draco," Pansy sighs. It shouldn't be surprising. She's truly never understood the two of them and their insistence upon complicating a very obvious mutual dislike. "I don't suppose you told him to fuck off?"
“You’d make a nice Cygnus. Perhaps Eridanus.”
Draco knows the wine is by the sink. He can see it. Doesn’t stop him from bending over to search through the lower cabinets, and making enough noise that Potter has to look down at him.
She looks up from the flowers she's watering and thinks, when she sees Draco, that at least she has him this year.
Draco turns back to him with a wicked smile. “Ask me no questions and I shall tell you no lies, Auror Potter.”
There’s the old Malfoy.
. You touched my hair.”
"Oh," Draco says. The several times he and Potter have come face to face since their colloquy a week ago, nothing changed. Potter hasn't been back to the tower, or, at least, Draco hasn't seen him. He's been quite satisfied with that. A strange little interaction he can entertain Blaise and Pansy with when he decides he feels like. But this works, too. "Yes. You don't."
“That,” says Draco, “is a shame for her.”
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Draco says, and turns his face back to the sky/ceiling. “That’s Gemini. You can see Pollux at the tip, right there.”
Draco can't articulate this any more eloquently than he can think it, so he says, "You have a beautiful way with words, my love.
Draco does it in messy spurts. Over the plane of his abdomen (pale, blushing with bruises from being fucked hard into Harry’s desk), and the aforementioned desk itself. The sounds he makes are, Harry thinks, ludicrous. Ridiculous. Fucking criminal.

“What? Tell me.”

it but shit like that still gets to him considering it’s only been Ginny he’s ever done anything with and that relatively recently. All they’d done sixth year was snog.
Some part of Harry had been expecting it, because there’s a release of tension when he hears Malfoy’s voice saying his name. He turns and raises his eyebrows. “Yeah?”
“Am too.”
“Would you like me to come?”
“Ah, so it’s
Then he thinks of their surreal conversation a week ago up on the Astronomy Tower and all those things Malfoy had told him, and Harry decides to give him the benefit of the doubt that he’s just feeling like shit tonight and taking it out on the most convenient target.
"Yeah, I know. I'm not saying it's a conscious thing. I just don't think he's
“It’s freezing cold,” Pansy complains as they start walking, the building already in sight. “I can’t believe you’re making us walk when we could have Apparated directly outside Maison.”
"Is that why you're crying?"
"Don't be smart, Draco," Lucius says calmly. "It's plebeian. Drink," he adds. It brooks no argument. The boy is a bit of a pansy — always has been — and he's always believed that developing a taste for whiskey would harden him. "I am still your father, am I not? Do you enjoy knowing your mother has cried over your absences?"
Unsure of what to say, and knowing the uncertainty won't quite abate until his wand is in his hand, Draco steps closer. "I — thank you. Should we find somewhere — I mean, I can't do it here."
"Angry," Draco echoes.
He does, and as much as Harry loves listening to his voice, he thinks the whole rant might sound better if it were interspersed with a few whines. A moan, or two. Harry’s not fussed.
He puts out the lamps with his wand and sets it aside on his night table and says, to Klaus and to the darkness, "D'you think it's time I quit pratting around and try dating like a normal person?"
Harry laughs, but it's a pained, tired laugh. A little hysterical, too. "Grow up, would you?" he says. "And I didn't lick it." Why hadn't he licked it?
He starts to scoff and then realises it's pretty sound logic: he even remembers Hermione mentioning something once about a failsafe in case the hospital ever encountered a large-scale Stifling — like, well,
"What are you gonna do with your hands, Malfoy?"
"Harry."
"I think it probably means what it sounds like. If the two of you have been going at each other ever since you met, I can see how that would be hard to shake."
"Yes, we shall."
is too far, but that’s where Harry moves anyway, crowding Draco and sucking at his neck until he’s flush against the wood.
Draco frowns some more when Blaise calls him baby. He doesn’t like that (and Blaise knows it), but he does like it when Blaise kisses the bracket of his ribs, so he lets it slide.
He's thinking about doing it,
“Now you really sound like Snape.”
“Because you were touching my cock, you imbecile.”
“You. Grinding all over me like I’m your fucking broomstick.”
“Probably don’t call her ‘it’ around Hermione,” Harry says. “And she’ll start up again the second I give her back to you." The proper reaction to being held by a Malfoy when you're but a defenceless infant. "I’ll stay if you think you can stomach my presence, I need to talk to Hermione anyway.”
Nothing does.
Draco's opening his mouth to protest when a waitress approaches. Two single malt whiskeys, a gin and tonic, two of the Otoro and a Katsuo, hold the daikon, please leave, thank you, and Blaise turns his attention back to Draco.
“But ... he’s intolerable,” Harry protests, realising even as he does that he’s experiencing jealousy right now. Some completely surreal, completely irrational part of him feels slighted to find out he’s not the first Gryffindor who’s fucked Malfoy. “He filled in for Ron as my Keeper for a while sixth year. He’s the
"Actually you
Harry wordlessly (because his mouth is rather preoccupied) slicks his fingers and traces Draco’s rim, working a finger into the first knuckle.
Turning back to his books and flipping Potter off as he does it, Draco says, "I'll get it to you within the week."
Harry lifts an eyebrow. “Go … where?”
something is going on here. It feels like it, but he’s reluctant to give it a name. Because it’s absurd. He gets up and follows Malfoy to the water, removing his shoes and socks and rolling up his pant legs so he can wade in the shallow. “You ever gone swimming in the lake?”
“Afraid so,” Draco says. “I’ve another function to attend.”
She helps him undress but remains tragically platonic about the whole thing when she helps him into his tub which she magicks full of steaming hot water and rose petals. Another flick of her wand and there are candles burning on most surfaces, perfumed and soothing. Finally she Conjures a velvet-covered chair, and she pulls out another cigarette as she sits.
Harry reinforces his grip and laughs. “Maybe I’d’ve tried to help you if you hadn’t immediately attacked me,” Harry says. “Ever think of that? And don’t think I didn’t hear you try to cast a
Harry shrugs. “I said my fair share as well. And anyway I keep my promises.”
“I’m a
"Yes, how terribly
Draco groans and cants his hips upwards when Harry pins his wrists, needing more even though he’s already overwhelmed. “Mm, close,” he says.
He allows Draco another kiss, parting his lips and sliding his tongue between the familiar texture of his teeth. He’s easily one of Blaise’s favourite fucks: Draco is soft and pliant where it counts and a brat in the best way. He’d have been happy to fuck him now, here, with Pansy watching (he likes an audience sometimes), but Draco’s clearly distracted and the longer he holds onto whatever happened, the longer this Potter thing will be drawn out. And Blaise is sick to death of Potter.
“Perhaps you could find another. It’s important to stay busy.”
If Potter keeps pulling on his piercing, Draco’s going to do something awfully embarrassing. Like whine. Or come in his trousers.
“Please do. I’ve got a thing for gingers, you know?”
“Dunno,” Harry shrugs. “Ginny? She was good, you know. Before. Safe and familiar and all that, and she’d always liked me.” His hand goes to the back of his head, rubbing awkwardly, and he sighs. “Now I’m just leading her on.”
“You’re welcome, then.”
“Yeah, well, unlike you, I have a conscience to worry about,” Harry says flatly. As they crest the stairs leading back up to the first floor Harry touches Malfoy’s shoulder to stop him. “Don’t say anything, alright? Seriously.”
He feels a bit bad for making Malfoy talk about it but still asks, “Have you felt anything since?”
“Ladon,” Harry repeats, dropping Draco’s hand back to the rug and refocusing on the warm bulge in Draco’s trousers.
“The Dog Star,” he says fondly.
They're in a fucking lift, is the thing. At St Mungo's, where, yes, something's happened to stifle their magic, but it could be resolved at literally any moment and is this
“Harry,” Draco moans when Harry begins to rock them together. Fabric and friction and hot against hot. “Harry.”
When Harry walked over, Malfoy tucked his feet under himself. Harry realised Malfoy was making room for him — he thought Harry was trying to sit down, when in actual fact Harry was just trying to read the title of the book Draco seemed so engrossed in. It seemed like something Harry should know, for some reason. He knew what Malfoy sounded like when he cried and what his insides looked like. He knew the way Malfoy’s face went horribly twisted when he was scared, and the size of his fingertips by the bruises they’d left on his rib cage. He shouldn’t know that stuff, and not what kind of books Malfoy liked to read. That would be weird.
Blaise wouldn't believe him, and Pansy absolutely would. He can't even fathom telling Greg, who doesn't say much anyway and would probably just look at him like a traitor. "I don't know what I would tell them," Draco says candidly.
unsurprising, isn't it? Thank you, Pans. Yes, so, we're in the lift, and Potter is tragically hard over the stunning aesthetics of my exterior, and through no fault of my own — don't

"A Christmas Miracle, as it were," says George. He can feel the subject hanging in the air between them, unspoken but very present. And George wants to talk about it — about him. Fred. Christmas is a good time to remember him. It's just hard to get started.
“Wanna make you come,” Harry parts their lips to mutter.
“You didn’t really think we’d care more about Granger’s child than your half-finished tryst, did you?”
“Sorry,” he says on a sigh. “I haven’t been here since …” He gestures vaguely instead of saying it. “Bit jumpy, I guess.” Holding up the joint, he says, “Stay a minute?”

He could tell Ginny he didn't actually shag Charlie, but explaining to her that her brother had simply pulled him off feels not quite appropriate, so he settles on an eye roll. Also, he knows where she's going with this.
Charlie had a boyfriend in Romania. His name was Dominic, and they broke up after Charlie realised he'd rather spend time at work than the flat they shared. That was about three months before he'd gone back to England, and stayed there for two years.
Granger rolls her eyes, grabs Draco about the wrist and places his hand gently at the babe’s forehead.
“Yes please, Potter. Court me harder.”
Harry clenches his jaw again. Turns to the sink, where he starts washing dishes by hand. “Then I guess you’re not getting any wine, are you? Tragic.”
expected Malfoy not to notice his staring, but it's still fucking humiliating being called out on it, which makes twice now. He wants to hit him. He also wants to kiss him and see if he can taste the wine on his lips. The fact that he hasn't moved makes Harry think that maybe Malfoy wouldn't stop him if he tried, which he doesn’t currently feel like analysing.
“I dunno,” Harry shrugs, surprised by the easy acquiescence. “Er — something about your childhood. What was the manor like over summer hols?”
“Gonna—mm, fuck me over your desk?”
“Yeah.”
“How about that one,” Harry says, pointing to a brightly blinking constellation towards the corner of the ceiling. Draco’s eyes are hardly open. But whatever. “What’s that one called, love?”
Yesterday, Ron told Harry that he could guess what the secret was, and he’d tell him if he got it right. He also said he never would, and then laughed for about five minutes.
"That wasn't so hard," Harry says. He moves both hands in order to unzip Malfoy's flies and tug his trousers down his slim waist, just enough that both hip bones are blissfully exposed and he can see his erection through ... yeah, that's definitely silk. "God," Harry sighs, drifting his fingers along the shape of it, "you're such a fucking ponce. D'you go around hoping this'll happen or is it just silk for silk’s sake every day for you?"
She looks down at her cup, thinking not for the first time about that moment five years ago when she’d put all her faith into that boy and lied to the Dark Lord, scared witless, only knowing she needed to find a way out of there to look for Draco.
“Then tell me how much you wanna kiss me right now.”
"So don't close them," Draco snaps. "Last chance to hide any of those kinky little fantasies of yours, Potter."
. He’d like to say turn them over and do it himself, but cry is probably a more accurate assessment. Or beg.
introduce me to some of his brilliant colleagues and reacquaint himself with London, though, it's been far too long since we were here. Anyway. Potter." Her attention turns to him and Harry tenses up, meeting her gaze steadily and hoping she can't taste his uncertainty in the air. Like a demon. Her dark eyes travel the length of his torso and back up. "I hear your talents extend beyond the battlefield. We should talk technique sometime."
He swallows noisily, eyes back on Malfoy’s mouth with its too-pink lips, and the long, slender throat below it. He doesn’t understand what Malfoy’s doing, why he’s not run out of here in a strop yelling about perverted Gryffindor heroes and their ill-timed erections.
“So beautiful,” Harry says. “Mine.”
flirting with
Harry’s hands off him now, Draco collapses heavily against the wall, shoulder blades sharp against the cold stone. He says, “Okay.”
“A practiced hand at Augamentis?” guesses Ron.
“Am,” says Harry. “Keep going.”
Ginny takes that as a compliment. “Good thing we broke up. Our offspring at Hogwarts would’ve been the death of McGonagall, I’m sure.”
?” Beside them, one of the Hall’s arced doors creaks open and Fletchley spills out, lips attached to Lavender Brown’s. “Nauseating,” Draco mutters.
“Fourteen,” says Draco.
“I need a Nausea Potion. Honestly, Pansy, how you get anything done with that bint’s head so far up your fucking arse is beyond me.”
“Yes,” Draco says, voice low and fingers clutching at the pristine tablecloth. “He was. He got me so hard I couldn’t think straight. He made me ask for what I wanted, wouldn’t even let me fucking move without admitting first I was gagging for him. He turned me against the wall and rimmed me, and fucked me with his fingers, and he tugged on my belly ring and called me a ponce cause I was wearing those black silk pants, the ones you love so much, Blaise, sweetheart. I got one thrust of his cock inside me, and then the lift started again, and he was Harry Potter again, and he went off knowing I was so terribly desperate for it that I begged for him to finish fucking me in a fully functioning lift, in my place of work. And so do you.” Draco raises his glass and clinks it hard against each of their tumblers, eyes smarting but not bothering to try and blink it away. “Chin-chin, do with that what you fucking will. Tossers. I’m leaving.”
a prick,” Draco agrees. “It was after that, I think. After I—" And then Draco remembers what came next. “
He wonders whether Malfoy realises exactly how right he is, or if it's simply a taunt for the sake of taunting. Almost three whole months since he's fucked anyone, and for what? Because his relationship had gone out so explosively he'd only been in the mood for his left hand? Here, trapped in a lift with Malfoy of all
"So, what?" says Charlie. "You're just going to forget about him?"
“A specialist?” Harry says.
“Yes, lover?”
That's the question, really. It's why Harry still
"That wasn't the question."
For a second, Draco thinks he might’ve misheard, and then Potter’s face goes a little red and he takes an urgent drag on his joint.
"Gonna go get some plates and stuff," he says. "Seamus, will you get the bong away from the edge of the fucking table, it hits worse every time you break it."
“I was eleven, you fucking ingrate.”
“Nice,” Harry says again. He tries not to picture Narcissa wandering endlessly, aimlessly around that huge, depressing manor with only Lucius Malfoy for company. It makes him feel rather sick. “I was never really a fan of gardening myself. Couldn't get into plants and Herbology.” But perhaps that’s because Aunt Petunia forced him to do their gardening in the beating sun for hours at a time. Who knows.
The soft milky whiteness of his midriff would have been bad enough on its own, but Harry barely has the brain power to admire it (or imagine touching it) thanks entirely to the small silver hoop adorning Malfoy’s infuriatingly perfect little belly button. It’s covered up again too quickly but the image of it is burned into Harry’s vision.
It takes Harry a second to process and when he does he lifts his head and frowns down at Draco. “I’m
“And you’re right. You’re not delicate. You know it’s okay to be, though?”
“Hush, you,” Hermione says. “Harry, get Ron off the floor.”
“You realise it’s gonna end up in the
"Yeah ..." Harry says slowly, blinking at him.
The second Harry steps out of the Floo at half past one in the morning, Klaus comes padding into the living room with pink-rimmed eyes like he's just been sleeping and his fur ruffled on one side. He rubs against Harry's shins once, sits down next to where he's standing, and meows loudly.
Draco says, “Thanks awfully,” and slams through the Hall door so hard his wrists click, and makes a beeline for Pansy, who’s sat on Daphne’s lap.
’ kind of head tilt.
“Right …” Harry says, because he doesn’t know what else to say. “So ... shall I get it from you tomorrow, then?”
Malfoy sighed, “No, it wasn’t,” and got up and left the room.
“Au Revoir!” Hermione calls back.
“I’m sure I’ll manage,” Draco says, even though he’s really very much not. He clears his throat. “Thank you. I suppose.”
Malfoy does one of his little sniffs. “Speak for yourself.”
nice.
“Draco, you’re mad,” says Harry. “How much did this cost? Is it even legal? Fuck, this is like, fucking, ridiculously complex charmwork.”
Harry releases Draco’s cock, and is met with an irritated mewl. “How about this,” he says. He tugs at Draco’s waistband and he lifts his hips obligingly, letting Harry pull his trousers and pants down to his delicately muscled thighs. “On your back, pet. Good.”
Malfoy, and it's not easy — but mostly he feels like an arsehole for acting like Malfoy's the only one with feelings when he knows perfectly well it's not the case. He definitely doesn't know what to
“What’s with the immediate sarcasm?” Harry says, stung a little. “I didn’t even say anything, I asked a question. I mean, obviously we can’t go back to normal. I don't even know what that would mean, I just …” He shakes his head, utterly lost for the right words and trying to stumble his way through it as best he can, which is probably only making it worse. “Can we talk about this or something?”
you I would clearly be more than happy to ignore it until we were out of this nightmare."
"I'm sure I will," says Draco.
After a minute, she asks, "Better?"
A moment of silence, and then Pansy erupts into ringing peals of laughter that echo off the walls of the (spacious) office. She lets it take hold of her, deep, gut-splitting belly laughs that bring tears to her eyes and wet her cheeks. It’s highly relieving and just exactly the sort of delightful gossip she’d needed to lift her spirits.
“Oh,” Harry says. “I probably meant to say; you’re not funny, Malfoy.”
“Naturally. Well, that’s very nice. You’ve ... seen him, have you?”
, to his stomach. He might retch. It's possible. He presses his fingers into his forehead, rubs at his scar in a gesture so ingrained it's as if his brain thinks it'll still help with headaches.
He also appreciates Ron's inability to take things seriously, and he laughs at his icebreaker.
“Gonna fuck you now, Draco,” Harry says — Draco moans and pushes his arse back into Harry’s hips — “within an inch of your life. Gonna shag your brains out.”
Draco’s knuckles whiten around the railing. “Ha, ha,” he says. “How convenient it must be to be able to mask all your attempts at stalking as righteous altruism.”
"Wouldn't you love that." Draco flexes his wrists against the squeeze. It's actually starting to hurt a bit.
feel, so the point seems rather moot. And he's tired. And pissed off, but that he's saving for Malfoy next time he sees him.
His eyes drop to Malfoy's throat, completely unconscious, but he becomes aware he's done it after the fact and looks away again, irritated and too warm. From the beer. He's had, like, three of them.
Harry looks up from his parchment, and says, “If you tell her, then you have to tell me. Unless it’s more gross sex stuff.”
Pansy pinches the bridge of her nose. "This whole thing is absurd," she says. "Surely you know that. I don't even— Where did this happen? When did you see him?"
Ron shudders. “Surprised by a Malfoy. A fate worse than death.”
Sometimes Harry manages to get a fucking grip and will his erection away (mostly) and then pull off later while thinking about anything but Malfoy. Because he does want this to go away, and he knows it will with time, but it's really bloody bothersome at the moment.
“That’s Draco.”
, Harry thinks. Only half. Mostly from the straw. Whatever. “Well. There’s a bloke staring at me over your shoulder. He's very fit. A real Adonis type, you know.”
"You're a piece of fucking work, Malfoy," says Harry, trying for casual and falling short. He just sounds flustered and irritated and, frankly, obvious, only he hopes that's just to himself. He decides it's because he hasn't slept with anyone in three months and his brain is confusing his elevated emotions (anger, hatred, contempt, all sorts of negative ones) for arousal. An easy mistake. "Here's an idea: move your entitled little pureblood arse and pour it yourself."
Harry watches him a second, thin and pale and apparently quite lonely. Vaguely, he wonders what tomorrow will look like when they inevitably see one another.
Harry’s not sure when he started smelling like home to Draco, but he likes the thought. Expensive cologne and lemony shampoo and old books and lots and lots of coffee has started smelling rather like home to him, too. Draco would call him an insufferable sap if he knew, which would be hypocritical, but that’s never stopped him before.)
"I'm only curious," says Harry. "
(See the end of the chapter for
“My favourite,” Harry says.
“How thoughtful,” Harry comments. Thankfully at that moment a house-elf (not Kreacher, who must be sleeping) comes to greet them and Harry asks for his hot cocoa as well as Malfoy’s coffee with two sugars.
“Does Draco know about this?” Hermione asks. “That is ... has he said anything about Harry in terms of ... not wanting to see him anymore?”
"No, it's pretty much shit," Harry says with half-arsed sarcasm. "But don't worry, there's zero chance of anything happening. He doesn't want anything to do with me."
“more, Harry, more,
Satisfied he’s finally found something to adequately rattle Harry, Draco laughs again. “Should I get us some handcuffs? A leather gimp mask?”
“Wait,” she says slowly, latching onto that latter bit of fascinating information and turning it over in her mind. “You
"Draco," she says softly, "I think it would be a very poor decision to get involved with Potter."
He pushes Draco onto his back on the sofa and crawls over him, dropping one more kiss onto his pretty mouth. “Tell us,” he says. “Out with it. Get it over with.”
, Harry, please."
,” Harry frowns.
Harry snorts. “You’re actually ridiculous.”
It was a tad bourgeois (or at least, it would have been without his tapenade), but Draco still feels slightly defensive when Pansy crinkles her nose. How horrifying. Still, he hasn't the time to fret the possibility of becoming an ally to
him anymore, and it’s brilliant.
Then Ron told her he and Draco had an
“Hermione’s snoring. Rose went off easy for the first time in weeks, so she pretty much passed out straight away.”
“Can’t,” he says, turning back to the sealed path. “Fuck, what’s wrong with these trees.”
“So what?” Harry fires back, but he’s losing steam. The thing is, he knows she’s got a point, even if he doesn’t like it. But there’s more to it, too. He just doesn’t know how to articulate it. “I’m not trying to have a relationship with him, Hermione. It’s sex. And, by the way, he called
“Seriously, you’ve made your point,” says Harry. And when Ron gives him a murderous look, “She’s clearly fine, isn’t she? Malfoy’s had plenty of chances to be a prick since he’s been back and he hasn’t. Just leave it alone.”
"You haven't shagged another one of my siblings, have you?" Ron says, and is horrifically reminded of that time Harry sat him down and told him, with much erring and apologising, that he was fucking his brother. "Is it Percy? For fucks sake. It's starting to get a little incestuous, don't you think mate?"
“What’s better than that?” says Blaise, but they finally come to the restaurant and Pansy opens the door to let them both through ahead of her. They take a lift up to the seventh floor and when the host tries to tell them there are no tables, Blaise slips him a few notes and soon they’re sat outside at a table overlooking the city, with heaters around them to keep the area warm.
“Oh,” Draco sighs. Harry’s touch is gentle, but he can still feel the tender pull of fresh bruising beneath it. “Of course you do.”
Because you’re right. Because I wanted you, and you knew it. “The same reason as always,” Draco says, voice low. “Because you’re a completely incensing pillock.”
Lights change; orange now, and Harry grunts without meaning to, and pushes Draco against the wall by the hand on his neck, and frots harder and faster while Draco moans around his fingers.
“Define stupid.”
It does look rather placid. And sweet, Draco supposes. It’s got Weasley’s complexion though, the poor thing.
“I’m diversifying.”
“I had to get it out of my system,” Harry says defensively, looking down into his mug. Shit. “
Draco chokes on his tea.
. He said try again.”
Draco mewls softly as Harry takes him by the waist, turning him over to rest on his knees and elbows, and scrabbling about for his wand to Vanish both their clothes. He’ll get in trouble for that later (Vanishing wrinkles the wool, you
Harry looks at him, searching his face, and then back out at the water. “No, I suppose you wouldn’t,” he muses. “That is unless you’re about to die in some cursed fire, obviously.”
“Fine,” she says, rolling her eyes. “But it’s
"Yeah, only now I'm traumatised," Ron says. Sulks. "Please tell me he's at least like, fuck, got a really small prick or something. Actually, don't. Bloody don't. No details, ever, and you can give Rose her bottle. I need my hands so I can start pulling my hair out."
It is
, it says.
, until he regains confidence in his ability to string a sentence together.
Carefully, Draco says, "Do you read?"
He’s pretty sure the professors all know what’s going on and that they’ve collectively decided to let it happen because they feel guilty for how shit the last year has been.
"Her bottles are all in the refrigerator," she tells Draco, opening it and showing him a top row filled with them. "All you have to do is warm it up. And please don't forget to test it on your wrist before you give it to her. You're
He swallows hard. Instead of answering, though, he lets his inebriation lead him, leans forward himself and kisses Malfoy with his heart hammering and his palms sweaty where they fall tentatively to Malfoy’s hips. Everything happens quickly, mouths opening and tongues pressing together and Harry feels like he can't get enough, can't taste enough, can't
“Hm?”
Grinning, Harry says, “My pleasure.” He kisses Draco again and then helps him zip back up, using his wand to spell his trousers and the floor clean. “Starting tomorrow you can do the cleanup now.”
the sort of chaos he wants to invite into his life?
When Blaise asks Draco whether he'll be coming to Venus in the evening, Draco says yes. When Blaise asks Draco if he would like a cocktail, and then another, Draco says yes. When they're in one of the five private rooms on the mezzanine, and Blaise is lamenting the quality of his coke in recent weeks, and Pansy is fishing a cigarette stick out of her corset, Blaise asks Draco if he wants a quick fuck, and Pansy says; yeah, and can I stay? Draco says no, and
“I shall hold you to that,” Draco says. “A minute later, and I’ll have to take her with me to Blaise’s club. I’m expected at five past.”
"You shouldn't tell people that."
Idiot. Draco says, “Perhaps I could help.”
"I'm not exactly sure. It's just— you know what Harry can be like. He'll think it'll be his fault if he can't fix things between them. He'd see it as giving up, or something, to just end it."
, you mean?"
Eventually, when it becomes clear Pansy's not taking it, Draco says, "No. Of course not."
“Brutus's!” Harry calls after them. “Bruti!”
"You know what?" he says darkly, "Good. Five years, you haven't changed in the slightest. You're exactly the same, and I don't know why you're hiding it in front of Hermione but let me assure you of something: she
,” says Harry, glancing sardonically up at Malfoy, rolling his eyes, and pushing his sweaty hair off his forehead. “And I’d be grateful for it considering the current view is giving me indigestion.”
"Come on," he says and leads the way across the entrance hall to the door they'd come through as first-years after crossing the lake with Hagrid. It's not used anymore: a nasty bit of Dark Magic kept it from being fixed after the battle and it's still mostly in crumbles. When the door bangs shut behind them Harry backs Malfoy up against it and kisses him again, but only briefly. From millimetres away he says, "Tell me what happened to your wand."
He knows Draco’s thinking about something particular, it shows on his face, and once again Harry wishes he could just open Draco’s head up and look inside and read what’s going on. He’s about to ask again when his sarcastic-sounding little promise makes Harry laugh.
"So?" Harry prompts. A few of their straggling classmates have thrown them glances but he's not really bothered.
a little hard to think without a steady flow of oxygen, but it’s a welcome inhibition. Draco wiggles under the firm grip and prevaricates with a soft grunt.
This is why Harry doesn’t drink tequila. Two shots with Ron and he’s comparing stupid idiot
"Oh," says Draco, "fifth year."
Harry rolls his eyes and lets his arms drop, shoving his hands in his pockets instead.
“You’re kind of a prick, actually,” says Harry.
"Right." Harry pulls his arm back from Ron, more aggressively than he'd meant. And to Hermione: "Just try not to make it a habit."
“And here I was thinking you’d be high maintenance,” says Harry. He links a hand with one of Draco’s, sliding their fingers together and smoothing his thumb over Draco’s palm. “Come stay in my room again?”
Draco gives him an abhorring look. “Of course not,” he says.
Draco smiles. “Your naivety is charming, actually. Pans’ fucked them too. And Daph. Has shagged Pansy, I mean. Though, her and Theo might’ve fucked once or twice, too.”
Potter, with a deep red flannel rolled up to the elbow and sufficiently less scrawny than the last time Draco saw him, looking like he’s one well placed barb away from dishing out a good-and-proper thumping is. Satisfying. Kind of. Perhaps, Draco might even venture to call it arousing, was Potter not the worst.
When Harry returns to the living room, Draco is frowning lazily up at him. “Did you spill wine on my floor?”
. And fuck,” Ron sighs. “Let’s not go there. You just worry about what you’re gonna say when Harry inevitably puts the moves on you, next.”
. Draco doesn't get told what to do. He tells.
Draco sniffs. “We’ve never been friends.”
Draco's first year at Hogwarts was the year Lucius decided he was no longer a child, and, therefore, shouldn't be disciplined like one. A quick smack across the knuckles or prod in the ribs with the heavy, emerald studded serpent atop his cane when he was insolent. When he was a little older, hexes so fleeting he wouldn't feel the pain until moments later, on the soft, porcelain plane of his cheek.
, like that.”
“Hand,” Draco pants warmth at Harry’s ear. “Your hand.”
Draco pants out a breath. In his desperately horny delirium (because fuck, Potter, get it
Charlie’s supposed to be coming tomorrow, on Christmas, but Harry knows he’ll sneak in tonight. He's predictably unpredictable like that.
“Very funny.”
"What?" says Ron. He wishes he'd had the bollocks to have this conversation when he wasn't so fucking high. "You saw him again?"
Spat around a mouthful of tapenade (interesting), “
getting it out of my system, technically. But we’re not together.”
Draco clears his throat. "He rimmed me first. And don't get too bloody excited. He only had time for one go at it before the lift started moving."
He leans into the hot spray and tries to focus on relaxing his muscles instead of the inevitable hardening of his cock which happens literally every time he steps into the shower or climbs into bed to try and will his mind to shut down for a few hours. Getting off with Charlie had helped for maybe two days. Then it was back to being sexually frustrated over Malfoy and the lack of sex he's had lately. Which is completely his own doing.
"Oh, I am keeping up," Harry says. His voice is lower, although he hadn't done that on purpose. He's also harder than he can remember being since the first few months of his last relationship.
Draco, feeling a prickle of guilt over his allegiance to such a sadist, curls further into Harry’s side. “There’s not much to tell,” he says, without much hope it’ll come off.
“Harry,” Draco says, lifting his head. There’s a stupid, lazy, lopsided smile on his face. “I’m wearing pants. I promise you.”
“Come on,” Hermione says to Ron.
“Mphh,” Draco says, and since Harry knows his noises, he knows this one means ‘please’.
Draco frowns. “I’m not lost. You’re probably picking up my elegant nonchalance.”
Golden apples,” Draco babbles. Harry swipes a thumb over his slit, and Draco ruts desperately into his fist. “
"No, not at all," Blewitt laughs, and Hermione can't help smiling. The sound is a bit contagious. "I only came to make myself some tea. Don't mind me, I'll be out of your hair in a minute."
Ron and Hermione would sit at the kitchen table for hours almost every time after they saw Harry in those months, talking. Ron knew Harry would hate it, being discussed like this, but he was being rather worrying and that warranted discussion.
“You know, Draco just spent the last couple years in France,” says Hermione as she hovers Mrs Weasley-amounts of food onto all their plates, which Harry privately thinks is a habit she’s picked up since dating Ron. And living with him. And becoming his wife.
Draco jerks his head backwards, the staircase into to dungeons he’d been heading for. Pansy says his eyes widen like a scared bunny when he panics. He keeps them at a determined squint. “Left it in my room. Not that it’s any of your business.”
She could hit him, really. But that's Draco. "Yes, well, it was a time-consuming hobby," she says, beginning to organise the papers on her desk and file them away. "And you were always much more passionate about the cause than either of us. I'd say your enthusiasm was rivaled only by darling little Ginevra Weasley." She stands up from her desk and
?" Oh, it gets more delicious by the minute. "When was the first time?"
Harry laughs. "You're a narcissistic twat. Where is it?"
“You’re very funny,” Harry says. “How many more witty deflections d’you have in you, you think?”
Someone else certainly might have been intimidated walking into the enormous office building in the heart of London where Pansy's business is located, up on one of the highest floors. Lavishly (but tastefully, admittedly) decorated and with the sort of bluntly attractive girl at reception who is probably intended to make visitors feel insecure about themselves, the whole thing feels very foreign to Hermione, but not intimidating.
that delicious sliding warmth — smooth like vellum, wrapped around his cock.
“Me?” says Draco. “Why do I have to find out?”
Harry’s tongue finds his cheek, contemplating Draco and his annoying little pose. “Do you often use sex to distract people from getting to know you?” he asks lightly.
grappling with the idea of being attracted to blokes,
“I don’t mean

Harry frowns up at him. “Wouldn’t that be in the
with it, and Draco is clenching around him, milking the last of it from his flagging cock.
“Oh yes,” Ron nods. “Very.”
They're only halfway through dessert when Rose starts crying from upstairs. Ron and Hermione argue for only a second over who will go check on her ("I'll do it!" Ron insists while Hermione says, "It's fine, Ron, I don't mind!" and they finally grin with pink cheeks and decide to do it together). And then they're gone, and Harry starts (angrily) hovering some of the plates into the kitchen without looking at Malfoy.
, and if he is it's because of the frankly inappropriate way —" But she cuts herself off, because it isn't worth it to get worked up and start yelling about how unhealthy she thinks his relationship with Pansy and Blaise is based on the things she's seen and heard. She takes a breath. Moves some hair out of her face. "Is this about Harry?" she asks again. "What's Draco said?"
“Why?” Draco smiles. “What were your parents? Fourth cousins, or something?”
“S’pose she figured I was working. It was nice of you,” he says, and clears his throat, “to come help out. Did she say when she’d be back?”
Gods, Potter is still dim as a dead fucking stick.
Besides, he’s not sure that would be completely honest of him. If Draco’s a refined-kind-of-asshole, Potter’s an extremely crude one. He wears his emotions without discretion — it’s part of what’s always made him so fun to fuck around with. Draco could practically see Potter debating whether or not to throw his coat back in his face (he’s glad he didn’t. The wool really is very delicate). Anyway.
He likes that Draco is passionate and articulate, and he likes that he can talk to almost anyone.
No, Harry hadn’t blasted them out of Bellatrix’s vault in a paroxysm of wandless magic. Hermione didn’t discover the location of the fourth Horcrux by deciphering some Ancient Runes. But yeah, they camped in a tent in the Forest of Dean. Yeah, Ron destroyed the locket with the sword, and Hermione the cup with a Basilisk fang.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Lovegood mentioned it to me. Of course she would believe in that Muggle nonsense.”
Harry bites down on his lip and closes his eyes, slightly overwhelmed by the sight of Malfoy trying to fuck himself backwards on his fingers. He doesn't let him, of course, but only because the pleasure he gains from being in control of everything beats it by the smallest margin.
who’d gotten him there. “So he dommed you into a pathetic little cock drunk daze and then left you hard and wanting, did he? Poor Draco, you deserve better, darling.” She smirks. “What’s the plan, then? Jump him at

“I’m sorry, are you

Draco sets his wineglass aside and drops his head onto Harry’s outstretched arm. “Muggles have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to the stars. Not even Wizards do, really. Centaurs are the only beings that truly understand how to interpret them. Stars reflect the future, not the past or the present, you know?”
Harry’s hips stutter with the last of his orgasm, he strokes his softening cock against Draco’s, and squeezes his delicate throat at the join, and feels rather than sees him come.
“Fine,” he says, filling the kettle with a flick of his wand.
It’s like he’s not even talking to Malfoy, particularly when he says ‘Harry,’ which he’s definitely never done before.
“Have I broken you? Do I need to call Granger?”
“You didn’t want to join?” Pansy asks Draco, taking a cigarette from Blaise.
“Don’t be such a lout, Draco,” Pansy scolds him gently through a smirk. “Dominique is quite useful and very good at her job. Now,” she crosses a leg lightly over the other and dangles a sharp stiletto from her foot, “out with it. Or I’ll send you on your way.”
Draco opens his mouth to protest, you absolutely can be expected at a club at a specific time, especially when that club is Venus and that time is when the private rooms open, but she blows right past it. He just scowls, instead. He hasn’t seen her since before Christmas two weeks ago, and he hasn’t missed her.
was going to be offered. “Erm. Sure, thanks. What — what book?”
Dominique gives Hermione a tight little smile and says, "You can go through now. Please knock, first."
Draco clears his throat. “It is important,” he says. “To stay busy.”
It’s not often Harry remembers she’s not actually his primary carer and he doesn’t actually have to do what she says, but when he does, it’s usually because he’s got some liquid courage in him. (Or liquid stupidity. His own instincts when it comes to things like drinking and studying and spending half his Galleons on a new racing broom even though he plays Quidditch roughly oh-point-five times a month are rarely more enlightened than Hermione’s advice.)
. “A Galleon says he’s not a Hufflepuff.”
The problem is that it’s the middle of winter and the hospital is warm to compensate, and with neither of them capable of producing a Cooling Charm the heat starts becoming oppressive after only ten minutes (in which they stand on opposite sides of the small space and don’t look at each other).
Draco moans, his hips shift back, pushing further against Harry’s mouth, and he’s, God, he’s collapsed to his front on the desk, and his hands are reaching back and—
“Hermione did
He’d discovered quite swiftly that the pinchy little bastard holds an almost universal fancy — every bloke he’s fucked since has groaned upon his disrobing, said “fuck, that’s hot, et cetera,” and given the thing a tug.
"Slightly," Draco corrects. "Slightly above average. And yes, I would say so. He's one of your sort, Pans."
Harry drags a hand through his hair. Not
? Thrilling.”
“Seldom,” Harry says. “If ever.”
"A quote from you in the lift, I assume."
Draco frowns. Harry's leg is pushing between his, and he shifts to accommodate it. "Arrogant fuck," he says.
"No," Draco hisses. "I understand this is all very amusing to you, but I can guarantee it'll be significantly less so once I've literally murdered you in cold blood."
"Good," Hermione says with a nod. "Good, I think it's healthy they both want to move on from it." Even though something about the entire situation still feels very silly and childish. "I'm glad Draco has someone looking out for him." She gestures to Pansy, mostly to be polite. "I don't think it'll be necessary for you and I to reconvene on this but of course, feel free to let me know if you need anything."
“Oh?” says Hermione. “And who would we sic him on instead?”
“Fine,” says Harry. “What is it?”
Harry looks at him, surprised, and then laughs. "What exactly am I doing?"
“Why does your face look like that?”
Drunk or not, Harry doesn’t buy it. At all. And his curiosity is more than piqued — he has a special interest in Malfoy’s wand, and he has a feeling other people might as well. “I know you’re lying,” he says. “Who took the wand, Malfoy?” A pause, and then, “Is that why you were gone Monday?”
“Then we need to just not talk about it,” Ron says with a shrug. “You know? Don’t bring him round when Harry’s here or might show up, try to make sure they don’t run into each other at Mungo’s. Out of sight, out of mind, right? I mean, it’s Harry, he
It's not the first Harry's heard of Ginny's aversion to having kids and he's quite proud of her for the dedication she has to her ambitious goals. He'll watch her in the Quidditch World Cup someday soon, he's absolutely sure of it. Molly won't like the lack of offspring, but then again, it's not as if she's
Taking a few steps down to where Malfoy is, Harry’s inebriation robs him of boundaries and he stands close enough he can smell him. “I shouldn’t have said it,” he says. “I feel bad.” And then another thing Malfoy said finally processes and he furrows his eyebrows. “Why don’t you have your wand?”

women who are always stopping him in the street and telling him how dashing he looks in his Auror's robes. Because Draco isn’t nice. Draco is an arsehole.) “Merlin!” he squints. “You’re right, Harry. I can’t believe I didn’t notice.”
“My aunt tried to cut it all off once,” he’s saying of his hair, able now, ten years or more in retrospect, to be amused rather than traumatised by it. “Grew back overnight. Didn’t know I was a wizard yet, so that was weird.”
“Why are you such a cunt?” he wonders without any real venom in his tone. He squints, though, in the direction Malfoy’s indicating and he supposes he can see some suggestion of a string of bigger stars. “So your namesake is just a
"Georgie always did have such a juvenile sense of humour," Charlie says, but privately he's happy to hear it. George usually slips a bit around the holidays. "Come here. Give us a cuddle."
Malfoy squints, then smiles. “Are you high? What’re you high on?”
The revised Muggle Studies syllabus now includes a study of Muggle popular culture. Including reality shows.
, mostly because she thinks Pansy knows that. And because she realises they’re clearly not going to get right to it, she adds, gesturing around the office, “You’ve done well for yourself. I feel like I see your spirits at every pub and grocery I’ve been to in the last five years.”
“Immature. Sex is a perfectly normal and natural—”
"You like when I tell you what to do," he says quietly — more to himself, as a discovery. It works out nicely, since he can't think of anything he's enjoyed as much as he's enjoying bossing a horny Malfoy around. He tugs his trousers lower to rest below the swell of his (
“Course,” says Harry. He yawns and drapes an arm across Draco’s waist, pulling him close and nuzzling into his shoulder, wondering suddenly, absurdly, what Draco likes for breakfast.
“I’m not sure,” says Harry, grinning, “it never occurred to me to throttle her.”
"I always knew you peaked too early, Potter," Draco says, drawing his wand from the standard issue hospital holster on his arm. "And now you're withering."
, this time.
Harry rolls his eyes. Everyone he knows is so fucking dramatic.
"That's the one," Harry agrees with a feigned earnestness. "Lush forearms.

"Put the clipboard down, Malfoy," Harry says with deliberate calm, "and come have a chat with me."
Draco would have laughed, if not for the lurch in his stomach. “You're much too earnest, it's embarrassing. I was talking about you.”
"Yeah," Harry laughs softly, only it gains a bit of traction when he actually thinks about it. "Yeah, that would've been pretty bad. To be fair, I wasn't breaking rules just for the hell of it, though. Everyone's always putting up red tape. If they just let me do what I needed to do, less rules would've been broken."
Draco pulls himself back, looking at Harry with his head pressed firmly against the wall and his pupils blown wide and heavy lidded. The corner of his flushed mouth hitches up slightly. “I do hate to be cliche,” Draco says. “But I must insist you make me.”
,” he indicates the two of them with a free hand. “And yeah, I was here,” he adds to Hermione. “I came to see you and found him with Rose, screaming her head off. So I calmed her a bit and put her down for a nap and left. I thought he would’ve told you, to be honest.”
Two, then three, licking and sucking while he whines. Draco is thrusting his narrow hips, and Harry can
“Fine, Potter. You know it’s an act of great cruelty, to deny a man his wine? Not very Gryffindor of you.”
"Christmas is not a time to hole yourself away, Draco," Lucius says when he finally finds him in his study with a book. He keeps his best whiskey in here, and he knows Draco's been pilfering it since he showed up. But he'll address that later. For now he takes a seat in another armchair and fills two tumblers instead of one. "You've been back three months. We've hardly seen you."
Truthfully, he's surprised Malfoy responds to the command so fast. Broken he'd wanted and apparently broken he's gotten. His cock (which, as he was reminded, has been hard for the past twenty minutes) twitches and he bites back a groan. With his trousers pulled slightly down, Harry can see two perfect little dimples above Malfoy's arse that make him feel half mad with lust.
Harry frowns. He’s not entirely sure what he’d been expecting, but it’s not that. “Yeah,” he says slowly. “Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind.”
Draco whines a little. Harry knows he must be feeling constricted, his semi trapped behind the waistband of his trousers. Draco doesn’t like leaking on his expensive clothes, usually. Tonight he doesn’t protest.
, when he’d had a louche, languid wank in the shower on Saturday morning. He was, obviously, thinking about Potter when he decided that it must have been that atrociously mediocre Merlot that made him act like such a shocking flirt.
Ginny rolls her eyes. She'd put her hand on his shoulder, but she knows Harry can be a little skittish when it comes to touch. "Harry, I really couldn't give less of a shit. If you wanna fuck Malfoy, go for it. Even I can admit he's far too fit for his own good. I just want you to do what you want to do, you know?"
"Hell yeah, thanks," he says, leaning over Ron to see the food. Neville's treacle tart rivals Molly's or the ones from Hogwarts and usually he'd be a lot more excited about it considering how much he's smoked, but Harry's pretty sure there's not enough marijuana in all of Great Britain to get him to stop thinking about Malfoy, so.
“A self righteous prick of a one, Pans. Probably thinks he can fuck Draco around how ever he wants cause he’s king of the fucking Wizarding world.”
going on, and he loves it, the flurry of activity, but wow, it truly is utter chaos — but as everyone keeps telling him they've got a handle on it and he doesn't need to worry, he's found himself in the living room with Ginny. Which is nice, actually. It hasn't been just the two of them in a while.
“Okay,” she says. And he knows he’s fucked up, that she’ll prod later, but he’ll deal with that when it comes. For now he opens the portrait and pretends to tie his shoelace to give Draco time to clamber out, then follows.
"An outrage," Ron says for the sixteenth time. "An outrage! Our daughter's been tainted, Hermione!"
And he found that not thinking about Potter freed up rather a lot of space. A lot of his time, too (Draco pulled many an all nighter in order to get those badges finished on time). Even when he was offered a residency at St Mungo’s by Hermione Granger’s side (so appallingly high paid that his decadent dining habits and penchant for expensive antique rugs couldn’t resist), and some long discarded, eleven year old part of him started to rustle,
Draco can feel a migraine coming on in earnest. “Yes, tried. He caught my hand, and asked me why I was so angry at him.”
“No.” Draco dips his head to mouth at Harry’s neck. There’s a triangle of blurred freckles that he laves; into them, he says, “Yes, probably.”
. I’ll teach it to you when you get back, if you like.”
“Alright,” Harry says, “I deserve that. Look, I just wanted to apologise, yeah? Gimme a second.”
"Lucius had been talking to Nott Senior in Azkaban. He's known Theo's gay since he was twelve, I mean," says Draco, "almost everyone did. Once he was released, Father came back to the Manor ranting about how their family had gone to waste. Never mind that Alphard is rotting in a cell for fifteen years, Theo's ruined the Nott name because he's a filthy sodomite. That's what Father said."

Granger is not Draco’s friend. The reasoning for this is three fold.
Raising one shoulder, Draco says, "Whatever you want. Keep shagging the She-Weasel. Don't. Just stop forcing the image upon me before it scalds my retinas."

“Darling, we’ve been back home less than a month,” she says when she’s gotten control of herself. “It didn’t take you long at all, did it? Well, let’s hear it, then.” She grabs her tea again, recrosses her legs, and leans back in her chair. “Is he a terrible kisser? I’d have to assume so.”
He has, of course, nailed it. The Weasel coughs over a murmured “wanker” and Granger delivers him a swift whack to the back of the head with a salad spoon. Draco is already having more fun than he thought he would. It helps that he can hear the sound of Potter digging his nails into the arm of his chair beside him.
“Draco, no,” Pansy says quickly, shooting up from her chair to grab his arm and feeling bad suddenly, especially when it’s shaken off. “Come on, you know I’m only teasing you, why are you so worked up about this?”
Harry said, "I'm not crying."
An hour or two in and Potter's sideways glances at Draco have become, in a direct parallel to every drink he downs, increasingly unsubtle. Idiot. Draco's quite pleasantly drunk himself, enough to have further pondered the theory he'd thought up in one of the few sleepless nights he'd endured after that Tuesday — was it a coincidence that whatever weird, tenuous little kinship he and Potter had shared had ceased the second they'd brought it into the daylight, or was it a perfect metaphor?

"God, I hope not," Harry grimaces. "I don't know much about my family, honestly. I'm choosing to believe I'm less inbred than you are." He takes the map back pointedly and folds it up. "How were your holidays? I assume you stayed here?"
This is brilliant. Harry loves drunk Ron. “Foncey?”
He’ll kick out the bottom of the lift and plummet to his death before he lets that happen, though.
“I, er, fuck. That’s not good, is it?” Ron says, and he knows it’s probably not the right thing. He also knows Hermione would have said “
intentional mistake. He stares at Malfoy another second, back and forth between cool grey eyes that he still can't read, and finally steps away, turning back to the sink just as Ron comes in.
"I'm so sorry, Ms Parkinson," Dominique says obsequiously, standing from the desk. "I tried to stop him —" here she shoots Draco a devastatingly bitchy glare "— and he started throwing a tantrum."
If Potter doesn’t hurry the fuck up, he’s going to. Fucking,
It’s awfully sarcastic, and awfully hot, and also one of the reasons Harry knows he would never leave Draco for one of his many suitors. He loves it when Draco’s a prick. Preferably not to him, but anyway. If Harry voiced this thought aloud, Draco would surely come back at him with some delicately veiled nonsense about ‘beggars, and their inability to choose’.
"That's terrifying," Harry informs him. "I'm a shit Occlumens, but I'm sure Snape told you that. Go ahead."
— on your cock.”
“Please, Pansy,” says Blaise. He clicks at a nearby waiter and waves his empty glass around. “Granger’s an obdurate fucking pain in the arse, do you really think she’ll listen to you?”
“No,” says Draco. “Normal sounds excellent. I’ll see you on the tower perhaps. Just give me a bell next time you want your cock sucked, will you? I’m off to Scourgify my mouth.”
Draco is rutting softly, rubbing his cock against the wood of Harry’s (largely unused) desk and fucking himself back on Harry’s tongue, babbling for—
, well into their twenties, but mostly he’s just sad for him. Because yeah, mixed up is putting it a bit lightly.
"Think we could've gone the whole year without speaking?" Harry says, putting his hands on the balustrade next him. He glances out at the grounds and then at Malfoy — the same blond hair, the same pointy nose, yet different for all of that. "If I hadn't ruined it just now, I mean."
Draco says, "That's foul. Do you think he was infatuated with you by association? Would've driven him to cruelty to know he couldn't have you."
Draco swallows a smile, and bites his lip. “Fuck, well, yes. It’s just the big hands.”
"Sure," Harry mutters.
“Shall I keep going?” Draco says.
"You, however," says Harry, "don't seem to be doing quite as well. How many more names will you be calling me before you decide to ask for what you want?"
“Tell me more about the Dragon.”
"Oh?" Draco tosses his fag over the balustrade and slides another from the pack. He doesn't light it. "Is it a haircut? That would be rather daunting for you."

Harry's much happier without his ex around, and so is everyone else. She really wasn't very nice, though Harry always insisted there was another side to her, and she just got a bit nervous or something around his friends. Ron and Hermione were of the private opinion that she was just a bitch, but they tried their best to be supportive.
“For what?”
? Since when has having sex with someone ever meant you had to like them? Clearly you enjoyed whatever he did to you,” she says with a lifted brow. “Yes, if you were
Harry fucks his finger in further, twisting and curling and twisting and curling and sucking Draco further every time his words go broken and babbled.
They never actually use the word deviant, but it’s there in spirit. Despite the fact that Malfoy is, you know. A complete cock. Harry feels bad about that. It rankles.
“I will not,” says Draco. He shifts on Potter’s bed, which is, unsurprisingly, unmade.
"D'you think you could quell your hard on for me for just a tick, Pans? Fucking
“You’re ridiculous,” says Harry. “Lie down, I’m getting some wine.”
Fuck, he's an idiot. Twelve hours with blue bollocks and no sleep is clearly starting to take it's toll on him. "Stop
It's not been that long. Not long enough for me to go begging to Potter, certainly. And for last time, — you, once again,
Harry looks at the opposite wall and then down at his bent knees. He's pretty sure Malfoy's referring to Crabbe.
Pansy looks up and catches his eye, and they share a silent moment of communication. She looks as confused as Blaise feels, and significantly more apprehensive.
“What the fuck?” says Seamus. “Don’t be stupid. Roll it, Luna. Ron’s fine. Look at him, he’s just vibing, leave him alone.”
mind, awfully, not parading it about like a bloody trophy every time you get within five feet of me? You’re offending my virtue.”
Malfoy makes a little sound of satisfaction and sips his drink.
Draco makes a sound of raw frustration, teeth clicking. “
Fresh off of her rounds, Hermione's delighted to see Draco in the tearoom already when she goes to sit down for a quick lunch. She's been wanting to talk to him, gauge his emotional temperature, but she hasn't wanted to actually pull him aside and make him suspicious. So this is good.
Full and a little drunk and warm from the fire, Harry can’t remember the last time he’d had such a nice Christmas Eve. He feels surprisingly content about the way things panned out with Charlie and he likes watching him now with Rose and Hermione.
Of course the one person

expected that to work, but it was worth a try. It's probably just the morning sunlight filtering in through the glass, but Malfoy looks softer than usual and perhaps more given to suggestion. It also turns his hair gold, which Harry feels really weird about in terms of the way it makes his stomach feel.
“What’re you — oh, Merlin’s

had a chance to get to know, and that made him safe and familiar. They'd bonded over Seeking and a shared sense of humour and eventually sex. And he'd known it was temporary, but Harry had still gotten a bit attached. Charlie was hard not to get attached to.
"You told her?" he says loudly the second Malfoy steps through the door into the blistering cold. "Are you out of your fucking mind?"
Harry forces himself —
He bites his bottom lip, and hopes it’s stained a bit from the wine he’s been nursing all night. He let Pansy paint his lips with that red stuff she loves so much, once, and it made them look excessively fuckable (bloke-in-the-club-toilets’ words, not his). Not that Potter would ever be oh-so-blessed as to have Draco on his knees, but Draco thinks he should probably let him know what he’s missing. As a courtesy.
“Because you already know him!”
— as his suspicions about the wand being taken resurface. "According to who, exactly? Where is it?"
"We're drunk," he says. "And in the entrance hall."
“Right,” he says, “well. I’m heading back up to Gryffindor. S’pose I’ll see you next time I feel like manufacturing a coincidence, yeah?”
to have mine just for a few minutes. I imagine you miss them, yeah?"
Draco whines at the loss. “Charms,” he says.
“Well at least you won’t treat me with kid gloves,” he half-heartedly jokes.
Harry pulls at a loose thread in his jumper. He should have thought of this before, but it really hadn’t occurred to him until their last (now compulsory) Muggle Studies class.
And there’s—mm. There it is.
“Actually, yeah, it’s been going pretty great until now,” Harry says. “This doesn’t have to change that.”

Behind him, he hears Ron muttering, in a mocking, childish voice: "
“Perfectly suited then,” says Draco. “You know, if you walked past this wall three times and thought about what you need most, it might give you a haircut that doesn’t make you look seven years old.”
“Not my type,” he says. “Your mate Weasley is fit though.”
Harry does. Malfoy tastes bloody great, and his lips are soft and swollen and pliant.
Charlie sighs and wandlessly clears a patch of snow for him and Harry to sit. Harry’s always been either frustratingly evasive or completely blunt. Looks like it’s the latter, tonight. “I dunno. It’s— there’s so many shades of grey. I mean, people can do stupid shit, like, really bad shit, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re all bad. Look at Perce,” he says, even though it makes his gut twist a bit. “But on the other hand, didn’t the kid like, poison Ron? His dad tried to kill you. And, shit, I’m not saying any of this to make you feel bad, or whatever, but I guess you’ve just really gotta think about whether you can properly forgive him for that. If you can’t, I’d say yeah. Bad foundations.”
See, Potter? Slytherins can be chivalrous too.
“Tell me something first,” Harry says, keeping his grip locked and stepping closer. “If it’s not because I didn’t let us finish then why are you so fucking mad at me?”
Harry snorts. “I don’t have
“I do,” Harry says. “I’ll keep finding you, then.” When Draco’s dressed, Harry hands him the cloak and leads him carefully downstairs only to find Hermione studying in the common room. He says, “Shit,” and then, louder, “Morning,” to which Hermione greets him sleepily.
“She didn’t know,” Harry lies through his teeth. “I mean, she knew
“Oh, don’t be such a sourpuss, Harry,” Hermione chuckles. “Drink your beer.”
. But it also wasn't the toxic shit show of an impression you gave Hermione. She thinks I'm—" He breaks off before he loses himself to a rant he doesn't want Malfoy to hear. "Don't fucking talk to her about me.
“You’re not going to like, propose to Hermione, are you?” Harry says.
"Look, I'm sorry," he says awkwardly, not quite knowing why, just that he feels like he needs to based on the look Malfoy's wearing. "I can't just —" But the lift opens and, lo and behold, there's no one waiting outside the doors. However, there

"I kind of want to, though."
“We’re at school,” Harry points out.

“A Glamour should work alright. It’s just, actually —“ Draco holds the wand out again “— could you?”
"Out of morbid curiosity, what would you choose?"
Surprised, Harry says, “Yeah? What’s that?”
“Warming Charm,” Draco mutters. His mouth is fuzzy from the nicotine but he can still feel Potter through it, full lips that taste a little like toothpaste. “Let’s fuck here.”
“What makes you say that?” Harry frowns. Because the only people in the world who know about the Horcruxes are Ron and Hermione and him, and that’s an unexpected amount of confidence from someone who’d relentlessly bullied him for so long.
“I’m not sure,” says Harry.
Draco sniffs and gives a delicate shrug, but inside his hatred of Potter has taken up residence in his stomach as some kind of wriggling, thrashing thing. The slovenly hypocrite; it's obvious he's told the Weasel — he took one look at Draco's abdomen and winced as if he were having a flashback.
Not the best response, but in all fairness Draco looks pretty similarly any time he has an overnight shift.
“Harry,” Hermione warns him and he pushes her away drunkenly and follows Malfoy out of the Great Hall where he’s just disappeared behind the doors, Parkinson, who'd ushered him there, fading back into the party.
Draco's body goes taut. Potter's told him that before, at dinner on that first night they saw each other and again in the lift. That he hasn't changed, will never change. It's not true.
The sentence confuses her for a moment, until she realises the stressed pronoun isn't referring to Potter. Unconsciously she sneers, back stiffening.
Only Potter would have the duality to do something as evil as bringing Draco to this kind of brink and leaving him wanting, and then be a stupid,
“Being hot,” says Charlie, and kicks off from the ground.
“Not very efficiently. It’d destroyed half the dungeons by the time you witless little picknies got to it.”
"Do you know us at all, pet?"
When they get there he leaves Draco outside the common room portrait, quietly gets the cloak out of his trunk, and sneaks back out.
Yes, it's
“It’s rude to insult people while you’re groping them,” says Harry and tugs Malfoy’s jumper off next. He’s completely perfect, all pale skin and pink scars that Harry had prayed wouldn’t be there. He smoothes his thumb along one, then another. And he doesn’t know what to say, so instead he kisses him again. And this time he presses his hips against Malfoy’s, grinding his hard cock against him and dropping his hands to his hips to hold him still.
When Potter flicks away the end of his joint, Draco sighs. “I meant the mask, you imbecile.”
Harry flinches at the touch to his scar instinctively and has to shake his head to rid himself of what he
is an admittedly sound argument, but Harry resists. By the absolute skin of his teeth, he resists. He throws on his Auror robes in spite of being covered in sweat for good measure.
'oafish' shall ever get within five feet of it. You should know that," Draco says.
Primly, Draco says, “No thank you.”
When Hermione got pregnant in the same month that she was promoted, there really wasn't time to worry about Harry anymore. Ron said it would be a good thing. That at some point, she had to stop making him colour-coded calendars and guides for self care, and let him figure things out for himself a bit. Hermione disagreed. Then Rose came, and she didn't have a choice.
." He scrubs his hands over his face, feels the heavy stubble of ... four days without shaving? Five? “I can handle this myself. Don’t you have a child now that you can lecture? And a husband?”
“Ouch,” Draco murmurs. Harry snorts.
, you fucking twerp." He tosses his head. "I was child-minding."
It's ironic, because after sixth year, he'd decided that the tower, along with Myrtle's bathroom, was to be avoided with utmost dedication. However, it's been brought to his attention since then (rather unceremoniously, and on multiple occasions) that he's somewhat of a coward. Of course, it's nothing Draco hasn't thought of himself before, but he also thinks his skin tone makes him look like a sickly medieval twink, and according to Pansy (who is brutally honest) it doesn't. So, there's that.
Draco snorts. "You're completely right, Potter. Telling my closest friend, with whom I share everything — and I do mean everything — is indeed much the same as broadcasting our private affairs to the entire Wizarding public. Bravo, to your persuasive abilities, for you've convinced me of my wrongdoings, and I prostrate myself before you in apology. Twat. I'm going back inside."
"Many things," Draco says, and leans forward, because Blaise has stopped kissing him. His lips are firmer than Potter's look, but they're still warm and good, and Draco thinks a bit less when they're on his. He's not in the mood for a fuck. A proper snog would be nice, though.
, Ron.”
Technically he's not doing anything stupid. Yes, Hermione would probably classify it as such, but they hadn't discussed differing opinions on what constitutes 'stupid,' so as far as he's concerned he's in the clear. Anyway, if she hadn't wanted him confronting Malfoy about his treachery she should have known better than to tell him.
“I mean, like. I can’t stop thinking about him,” he admits quietly. “And when I do, I just ... I feel sick. It’s like a constant battle, trying not to go see him again.”
The snap in her voice gets Draco (of course, she should have known) to snap his jaw shut. She can tell just by the sight of him that he's disheveled emotionally — add to that the fact that he looks physically out of sorts as well and Pansy's curiosity is sufficiently piqued. Enough even to calm her temper, which at this hour is easily stoked.
Hm. He had been about to scold Potter for throwing a proper fit (his tantruming is making Draco awfully claustrophobic), but. However. As Potter flings his robes from where they’d been ever so subtly bunched at his waist, Draco feels a rather sudden thrum of déjà vu.
“Alright,” he says. “You’ve got to come to Gryffindor with me and I’ll go get the cloak from my dorm and come back out and sneak you in. Good?”
So Harry’s excited to see him. And he’s excited to enjoy the holiday without the weight of relationship anxiety dragging him down.
not good at shutting down his mind. Trying desperately anyway, he says, "Whenever you're ready."
“You know, if those wrinkle,” says Harry, gesturing to Malfoy’s robes, “you’ll look only half as poncy as usual. And, really, that would be
“Did I say anything?” Harry bites out. He sets a plate into the dish rack and it finally breaks, although he thinks that’s his highly reactive magic rather than the physical force he’d used. He sighs, uses his wand to clear it up, and rests his hands against the edge of the sink. He can’t turn around, because if he turns around Ron, like Malfoy, will see his (flagging,

Not even five minutes pass after Molly and Arthur retire to bed that Ron says, “Alright, spit it out. You two,” he points at Harry and then Charlie, “mind telling us why you were late?”

Hm. How very interesting.
“Yeah,” says Harry. “Will you?”
“Idiot boy. Kiss me again.”
Pansy snorts. "Don't be gauche, Granger. I'm simply requesting that you, as I said, leave him be. Draco's quite delicate at the moment, and it's really only due to your intervention."
," Draco hisses.
"Fine," he says. "Get on with it, then."
“Mm,” says Malfoy. He takes Harry’s hand, suddenly. His skin is warm. “Come on.”
“No,” says Draco. “It’s here. I’m allowed to use it during classes. Other supervised activities. Otherwise, I think McGonagall has it. It’s supposed to be kept warded away somewhere, but she’s incensed about the whole thing, so.”
"—cause it's winter and they'll be cold!"
Harry clears his throat.
“Bad,” Draco murmurs, taking the glass of water between his lips eagerly. “Bad Harry.”
Draco says, “Are you serious?”
Terry snorts back a few laughs and says, “Yeah, good, thanks. How’s bubs?”
Harry can actually feel his self control crumble, like a dam reaching its limit. It happens the moment he sees Malfoy’s tongue sweeping across his lower lip. It makes sense: he’d gotten reamed more than once in Auror training for his tendency to give into urges.
"Come off it, Potter," Draco snarls. "Do you really care if your best friends know that the fuck we had in a
"We're not finished," Harry says, and before he can think properly about it he grabs Malfoy's wrist to stop him. The second he does it he lets go again, horrified, although he tries not to let that show on his face. "Your
. It's not as if you're baring your soul to him, darling, you're just having sex. As much as it pains to me believe Potter is ...
"It's the same thing in this case, you treat him like a little doll after you're finished, it's very cute—"
“harder, Harry.
any of this. "It didn't occur to you that Hermione didn't know anything because
Harry presses him back against the sinks, entirely annoyed with the way Draco’s obvious goading is working. “Yeah?” He drops a hand to look for a bulge in Draco’s trousers and squeezes when he finds it. “Why’s that?”
He lets the air out of his lungs and looks at Malfoy, trying to decipher what's going on in his head. The shock seems pretty genuine, which. That feels good, at least.
Ron grabs Harry by the elbow. "If you don't take me with you, I'll literally kill you."
“Hercles, no, fuck,
Harry shrugs. Says, “I dunno. Now that you’re here I realise I could use some company.”
Charlie really liked shagging Harry. He was young and inexperienced, but he was also a quick learner. The sex was great, and if it wasn't it was fun, and all in all it was a brilliant distraction.
“Coffee at two in the morning? Really?”
George's grimace grows as Ron talks, highly averse to the idea of visiting his niece only to find a Malfoy haunting the place whenever Harry's there.
Draco turns his head into the crook of his elbow. “I sort of fucked Potter,” he says, and squeezes his eyes so tightly shut that little folds of his shirt crinkle in his lids. “Just a little bit, though.”
“That’s right,” Hermione says, trying not to sound snappish. It’s possible Pansy
Out of nothing more than desperation, he punches a few of the lift buttons again and when it doesn't work, he throws his robes against the wall. How long have they been in here? It can't be more than fifteen minutes yet it feels like hours, and he can't stop thinking about that obnoxious little navel piercing, and it's bloody
Number two: Granger is simply far too intelligent. Draco, in his adolescence, came to realise that there was a distinct variation between what he could get away with in Greg and Vince’s company, and what he could get away with in Pansy’s (which was precisely nothing). And now Vince is gone, and Greg doesn’t want to see any of them anymore, and Draco has no friends with whom his shit will be put up. If he wanted any more (which he does not) he wouldn't be recruiting another
"Just,
Blewitt laughs again. Draco's going to throw his coffee cup at him.
She sets her cup down sharply and levels him with a piercing stare. “
, you psycho."
“Really?” Narcissa says, a little surprised. She hadn’t really expected it. Not after ... everything, and that on top of the enmity between him and Draco in school that she and Lucius had never stopped hearing about.
He and Malfoy are alone for approximately five seconds before the lift jolts violently and then stops.
“Buy you another,” says Terry. “You need it.” He gets up and goes over to the bar where Harry suspects he also wants to flirt with the girl behind it.
Because he really, truly, had not thought about Harry Potter all that much in the last few years. After the mottled bruises from Weasley’s right hook and Potter’s elbow in his ribs when they fell together from the broom had faded, and he’d packed up his assorted bedrooms at the Manor into cardboard boxes, and said fuck you to Lucius and I’ll miss you to his Mum, and jaunted off to France with Pansy and Blaise to be young and sexy and not at all infamous, he had not thought about Harry Potter.
Harry chokes on the hit he's just taken.
Draco's helpless to stop the sound of complaint that escapes him when Potter stops his frotting after only a moment of friction.
“He’s just seen Malfoy,” Ron says it with an and-we-all-know-what-that-means (which Harry absolutely doesn’t) kind of smile and a clap on Harry’s shoulder.
"It was, yeah," Harry says ironically. At the time, he only remembers being pissed off. And humiliated, when he realised Dumbledore wouldn't have let Fleur's sister die down there. "I mean, honestly, that's the main reason I bothered getting rid of Voldemort. I can't get enough of the adulation. It keeps me young, Malfoy."
"Close," says Harry, in as casual a voice as he can muster. He applies more pressure to Malfoy's hips to try and stay them, as good as it feels. He then gives into the mad temptation to bury his face in Malfoy's neck, where he noses along the skin beneath his ear and then nips at it gently. "Let you what?"
“I see,” Harry says. Because of course Lucius and Narcissa are not just racists but homophobes. It makes perfect sense. “Your mum and dad have always had interesting parenting methods.” He pauses, then says, “I think Dumbledore was bent.”
“Of course,” says Narcissa. She puts a smile back on. It simply isn’t worth pushing. “Well, in that case. How would you like to help me water the rest of my flowers?”
Draco drapes his robes about his shoulders, and goes back to the steadying comfort of the corner.
“You’re welcome,” Harry says. “You’re awfully surprised for someone who’s spent most of their life getting whatever they wanted.”
Sighing a little but saying nothing, Hermione goes to the door to Pansy's office and knocks.
Draco turns for the door, knowing Harry will follow. “Your problems are pitifully easy to solve, I hope you know,” he says, over his shoulder.
— but of course it applies only to the essentials, which doesn't include lifts.
“That doesn’t have anything to do with it,” Harry says defensively. His twitchy little movement causes Rose to drop her elephant and he picks it up for her before she can start crying. “And, you know, even if it did, you can shut up about it because it’s clearly out of my control how I

His trousers are still at his thighs, but zips elude him. He can’t. Will not.
“Perhaps,” Draco says, over a cool sip of his wine. “Although her dowry was most unimpressive.”
, Pansy, that I shouldn't have let him see me like that. I shouldn't have— fuck, I shouldn't be able to make my own decisions. You make them for me. Actually, no — you'd abuse your power far too much, you fucking sadist. If only Blaise weren't such an idiot, I could make him do it. "
Merlin. Hip bones aside, Malfoy is still utterly infuriating. Completely incensing, and—
"Draco won't discuss it." There's no point feigning niceties, now. Granger's not going to acquiesce anymore than she already has. Pansy drains her glass, and continues, "He did, however, make clear his intention to let it go no further."
“This is how it’s
, if someone sees them, he’ll get fired.
There's a brief silence filled in by the sound of the wind outside and the crackling fire. A creak of wood upstairs, probably Ginny, not yet asleep. It smells like pine and gingerbread and his childhood, which is both wonderfully nostalgic and very sad.
“I understand the appeal,” Harry says. The sky above them is somehow denser than that of the Hogwarts Great Hall. Not pellucid clouds drifting below a high, arched ceiling, but a real slab of deep, dark, opaque night. In Draco’s living room.
Once the green flames simmer back to amber, Hermione sets Rose down on her play mat on the floor and turns to Ron. "Okay, number one; you're right. I shouldn't leave Rosie with someone who you don't completely trust, even if I do. It's not fair," she says.

"Oh," says Draco, strangely bereft. "Okay."
Draco laves Harry’s warm, eager tongue with his own. Cloying physical exhaustion joining his emotional torpor, he thinks he would quite like to be back in the plushy four-poster, with its quilted maroon pillows and a curtain to separate them from the world outside.
“Where,” he says. Licks his lips. “Where the fuck are our clothes?”
And yet, he finds himself lounging back into his chair while Potter clears the table.
to be here, only he doesn’t really understand why), and when Malfoy comes closer he can smell him again, that same scent as last time that he’d liked.
"Yes, well. Adversity makes strange bedfellows."
Harry feels himself go taut, grunting out a string of curses as he comes inside of Draco, leaking about his cock and in rivulets down Draco’s thighs.

She grabs her bag from the kitchen counter and looks around, as if something she's missing will present itself to her.
"Yes," Harry says emphatically, already taking out his wand and sending the plates and forks and knives into the living room ahead of him. "I deal with things, that's what I do." A sentiment he could in no way overstate.
“You don’t have to,” Harry assures him. “I‘ve never really seen it up close. Just curious.”
Harry raises his eyebrows. Dark haired bloke has disappeared, but there’s still a slight slick of tequila below Malfoy’s belly button. Which Harry can see. And it makes him dizzy, which it probably shouldn’t — just like he’s not terribly unused to seeing Malfoy out and about, he’s not terribly unused to seeing him in a state of scant dress.
Draco crosses his arms, cocks his hip. Waits.
brought it up. Do you always like bottoming, or is that just for me?"

Groaning against Draco’s neck when he feels him start coming, Harry pumps him through it with quick, sure strokes that become wetter and more slippery as come coats his hand. Eventually he slows and finally stops, kissing his way across Draco’s jaw as he does and finding his panting mouth.
His stomach does a weird nervous flip and Harry stops grinning. He moves a little closer, anxiously crossing his arms over his chest. “What’s the difference, exactly?”
Yeah, there it is. Malfoy. “Are too,” Harry presses childishly. “You’re hard.”
Draco smirks. "I can't tell you. You wouldn't be able to handle it."
What does surprise her a little bit, however, is the note of real hysteria in his voice. She hasn’t seen Draco this genuinely worked up in some time.
. Potter's inside him and all over him, a hand on his cock and his wrist, mouth collapsed against Draco's own. "Fuck off," he pants, then, "Oh,
He’ll have to workshop some truly devastating insults to get him back for this — for making him obey so mindlessly, making him feel so good.
“One simply had to read Hogwarts; A History” (Harry’s not even being dramatic when he says that this inspires traumatising flashbacks) “familiarise themselves with the Charms used on the ceiling of the Great Hall —”
Hermione laughs. "Well, you could. They have plenty of antioxidants, lots of caffeine, obviously. But it wouldn't be easy to chew, and they're very acidic. Everything alright?"
“Yeah, good,” Harry agrees mindlessly. It’s like Charlie’s touching every frayed nerve, every tense and strained and overworked piece of himself that he’s gotten used to ignoring lately. He tilts his head back and presses up into the heavily-calloused grip on his cock, the lips on his neck, unable to feel the hard ground or the cold. There’s a part of him, just below the fog of his need, that understands Charlie is doing this for him because he knows he needs it. That nothing will be magically solved afterwards, and Charlie certainly won’t be staying. But it doesn’t matter: he does need it, and he wants it from Charlie instead of whatever random person he’d have found somewhere else just to take the edge off. “Fuck,” he groans, trying to fuck the fist around his leaking cock, “Charlie. I’m close.”
"That," says Draco, "and the mess."
"Meaning what?" Harry says, and there's a sharpness to his voice he immediately regrets. "I mean, what are my choices?"
Draco’s stomach dips in a nervous and horrifically excited kind of way. “Say it,” he demands.
going to say Charlie, I realise that's different. I also think
“Although,” Ron says, twiddling a wooden piece between his fingers. “I was thinking of— fuck, now I’m nervous.”
Draco feels a mewl rise in his throat, but purses stubborn lips around it. Potter hasn't moved, except to tug on his navel ring like he's trying to fucking jerk it off, or something, but still he feels impossibly closer.
Leaning against the nearest bench, Draco says, “I thought you said you weren’t together?”
There’s nothing for it but to trust him, and for some reason Harry does.
“Such a tosser,” Draco says into Harry’s chest when he finally gets his jumper off. His skin is warm from the charm, and smooth as that where Draco licks below his jaw. “Such a prick.”
"Betrayal!" Ron exclaims. "Harry, what the fuck? You saw the ferret here and you didn't even tell me?"
Draco says, “I suppose you couldn’t help yourself.”
“He does not love me,” Draco hisses. He regrets it immediately, the way his words make his mother flinch. He clears his throat. “I only mean to say, I am here for you and you only, Mum. I won’t tolerate him trying to get me back in his clutches.”
Draco murmurs, “I’m sure she’s very
"Harry's weird like that though, isn't he? He's all sort of ambiguous about Malfoy ever since he almost killed him in sixth year."
Draco blinks. "I don't."
in this moment, that it’s impossible not to think fleetingly of how close he’d come to death last year and juxtapose those two things. It fuels him, makes him groan as he pumps into Malfoy and tries to wrench an orgasm out of him before he comes himself.
Malfoy’s not pretending Harry isn’t here at present. At present, he’s shaking off suitor after suitor and doing some passive aggressive elbow choreography just to get to him.
“Au contraire,” says Draco.
“There’s the fucking, ah, the minor constellations” — Harry scissors his fingers — “Merlin’s
He heads around the front, and Molly's there snipping herbs from the pots on the window. He's usually only grateful for the way he's become all broad and muscled because blokes seem to really like it, but around the holidays it saves him the whole you're-far-too-thin maternal fretting thing that Mum inflicts upon the rest of the brood. So that's nice, too. She just drops her wand when she sees him, and pulls him into her and pets at his hair.
Draco sniffs. "I've always been boring." It's not true, but Potter already knows that. "You've always been interested," he adds.
And Harry comes, cock taught against Draco’s, and fingers fucking languidly over his tongue.
"Wow," Harry says, holding the joint out. "
“How do you know all this shit?”
Naturally, Draco was a bit cross with her about that come Monday morning. Harry, too. To be expected. What Hermione didn't expect was what Draco told her over biscuits in the tea room on Thursday afternoon, when he'd finally emerged from his strop (though, Hermione suspects it had more to do with the Jaffa Cakes she offered him than genuine forgiveness).
Harry positively gapes at him. “Fuck you, Ginny and I aren’t even together anymore!”
. Beat himself
"When do I coddle him?"
Harry's tried to help — there's
The fifth time they speak is right now.
"Please," says Draco, dropping his hand to the mattress with a hollow thump, "cease with the dramatics. You're twisting my words. I know you're serious, you dickhead, I just didn't know you were, you know, living together serious."
"Clearly," says Harry. He picks up another stone and throws it; it skips five times. Six is his personal record. "You know what you're doing after graduation?"
For some reason, that fucks Draco off more than any bitchy little thing Potter's said to him so far. "
Murmuring, Draco says, “Don’t have to tell you.”
The thing that stings a bit is the way Potter talks about Granger, like she’s his and his only. Yes, Granger is absolutely not Draco’s friend, but she kind of is, too. He can speak to her about what he fucking well pleases. Fuck Potter. Fuck. Him.
Mother, perpetually the hostess, has always been incredibly talented at polite conversation. She could talk for hours about absolutely nothing, Draco’s seen her do it. He resents her small-talking him, though.
“You’re not funny. Fuck you. Really.” Harry whacks Ron as hard as he can in the arm, grabs his head and turns it firmly back over the chessboard. Berk.
"I thought I was cute."
“I know,” he says, watching Draco carefully. “It’s good to, though. Hermione makes me do it and I always feel better after.”
Because he's a fucking pervert, apparently, Harry drops his gaze to Malfoy's stomach, as if he'd be able to see the navel ring through his clothes, and then lifts them again to those chilly grey eyes he remembers looking round and pleading last week in the lift. He wishes more than ever that he'd let them finish, that he'd gotten it out of his system then and there. "Sure," he says flatly. "Whatever you want, Malfoy."
"I warned you," says Draco, not bothering to try and look sympathetic.
He's in a state of aristocratic disarray, and Harry didn’t know there was such a thing until now. His hair is all gold at the roots with sweat, and the shimmery stuff from his cheekbones is smeared across his nose. “Hm?”
"Let you win." Draco, with the little brain power he has to spare, tries to square this Potter with the one who'd been so quick to fluster earlier. "Jekyll and Hyde," he says, and then drops his head to Harry's shoulder.
“Tickety boo.”
“Don’t make me spank you, Blaise.”
“Stop it,” Draco complains.
It’s three nights later that Harry finally takes the map out to find Draco again and sees him, interestingly enough, in Myrtle’s bathroom. Myrtle’s in there too according to the map, but she’s gone by the time Harry walks in, for which he’s very grateful.
Of course not.
What Harry would
"He's quite handsome," she says. "Seems familiar too."
Right. So
Ugh. Trust Potter to wrangle mention of his fame at a time like this. Draco wants to say as much, but it’s enough effort already to pull himself shakily from the wall, and take his robes from where Potter’s holding them out.
Draco pulls closer still, impossibly so, and presses the straight bridge of his nose against Harry’s. Harry thinks his glasses must be digging into Draco, and then wonders why exactly he’s thinking that when there're golden eyelashes kissing at his cheeks.
"Bloody bullshit, Harry," Ron scoffs, covering Rosie's pink little ears. "When have you ever been able to shag someone without it getting complicated? And don't say Charlie, because you know that's different. And did I not say no details? Now I'm not going to be able to look at the git without seeing you licking his fucking piercing, or something. Gross. Fucking gross."
"Mm. I'll try you then. I'm also an extremely gifted Legilimens."
of emergency happened? It’s nothing serious with George, is it?”
"Yes," Pansy agrees, "but not to this extent usually. I mean, a couple weeks ago he was a bit broken up about it — that night I took him home and gave him a bath, you remember — but I thought he'd gotten over it by now. He hasn't said a word." She sighs, tracing a finger round the lip of her tumbler. "I could just

in the glasses he grabbed, thanks.)
“Yeah. Fuck,” Harry says, nuzzling against Draco’s neck, by the hand that still rests there. Draco’s knuckles are pressed into his chest, and Harry feels the fine bridge of his nose against his flushed cheek. "It was so hot, Draco. You’re so fucking hot.”
"He didn't realise," Harry says to a stranger passing them, who gives Harry a look that is both recognition (he can't go

peaking."
A soft knock on the door interrupts him and both Harry and Ron goggle at it while Hermione glares at them.
“Who’s Skeeter? I can’t even read. Fuck off.”
There’s also the small addition of Draco’s hand on his cock, pressing the seam of his jeans against the leaking head, so he groans and feels the vibration run down Draco’s spine.
“Like falling snow.”
“I was gonna tell you, Ron, but I didn’t want to get involved in
As it turned out he needn't have worried.
“Fascinating, isn’t it?” Pansy says, leaning into Blaise even as she continues grinning at Draco. “Go on, Draco, it’s been
“Don’t we have to stay here?”
If Ron had known in sixth year that Harry would end up shagging Malfoy and becoming obsessed with him all over again, he doesn’t think it would’ve come as that much of a surprise. He would never tell Harry this, because Ron’s pretty sure he would find it completely humiliating. But yeah. The parallels between then and now make his stomach hurt, a bit.
Draco braces his palms on Potter’s thighs as he fucks into his throat, hands tugging on his hair so hard it hurts. There’s no slack in his grip, and Draco’s cock strains against his flies.
“Let me in. Let me in let me in let me in let me in—”
"Yeah," George laughs. "Guess so. Probably good she does, though, if you ask me. He never really stopped being a bit of a loose cannon."
He's not
“Yes, of course, Harry. I can’t imagine what the professors were thinking when they told a bunch of twelve-year-olds to fuck off and let the grown ups handle the murderous snake man. Unconscionable.”
“Do share,” says Draco. He takes a cigarette from his pocket and a crude little plastic lighter that Blaise bought him after his trial, just to be a cunt.
Even now, Draco bites down on the relief. "Are you fucking with me?" he asks.
Ron had been trying awfully hard to be solemn that night out of respect for his friend, who had just fallen several hundred feet out of the sky (although, that must've been about the fifth time Harry had landed himself in the hospital wing, so it was rather difficult to be appropriately concerned). When Seamus had started groaning and having ostensible nightmares over various lunching items, he'd given up altogether.
, about this two-am version of Malfoy agreeing to having been obsessed with him for five years. He's not really sure what to do with that information. He's not even sure he wants it.
So no. Granger is not Draco’s friend. But that doesn’t stop her from doing ridiculous things like inviting him to dinner and hugging him when he arrives. It also doesn’t stop Draco from doing ridiculous things like accepting the invitation, and burying his face in her absurd hair.
Ron yawns. “Yeah, right, like you haven’t done that enough for the both of you.”
“What’s funny?”
Harry does choke, this time. Malfoy looks pleased.
“Tell me,” she says, not for the first time this evening.
“Yes, thanks Ron."

“Wait, you were watching
Potter, whose cheekbones do look rather chiseled when he frowns like that, and whose hands flex with veins when he grips his fork tight enough to warp the silver (Draco assumes it’s a proxy for his neck).
Knowing he should get Draco out of here, Harry still gives into temptation and kisses him again, slow and deep with a hand on his jaw and their legs tangled together. It’s another world, one with soft blond boys in his bed and pleasant stripes of early morning sunlight coming through the hangings. “You’re still fucked out,” he says with a crooked grin when he pulls away. “Good look for you.”
"Our magic is being suppressed, yes? Well, you can't cast Stifling Spells in magical hospitals, for obvious reasons. Ergo — that means therefore, Potter — something else has to be doing the Stifling. And since the lift, which is powered by magic, has also stopped, we're left with the, I repeat,
Draco hums softly. “Quite.”
She doesn't know which thread to follow. Whether to ask
Draco shifts the pillow under his head. "I told him. He was on a terrific spiel, one of his best; 'if my son were such an aberrant recalcitrant, I'd count myself a failure', et cetera. So I said, you are."
“Please tell me you’re not gonna do something stupid.”
Harry does mean that. He nods.
Blaise gives Pansy a look, who gives him a quelling one in return that he ignores. He gets up and reseats himself beside Draco with an arm slung about his slim shoulders. "Pouting is the same as sulking, baby boy," Blaise hums against his cheek. He takes Draco's chin and turns his face so he can kiss him on the mouth. "Stop thinking about it," he says. "Put him out of your mind. He's a troglodyte."
Harry rolls his eyes and for a second only tightens his grip on the broom. Then (with a terrible clench in his gut) he realises it just isn't fucking worth it to be annoyed (over Malfoy, no less) when Charlie's right — he'll be gone in a few days, even though Harry doesn't want him to be.
"I'm a bit of a tea snob myself," Blewitt admits, with a smile that is clearly in no way
“I don’t usually drink cognac,” Hermione says, although she accepts the glass she’s handed. She cradles it in her hand, not tasting it yet. “I’ll have to take your word for it, I suppose.”
“That was a joke. At your expense.”
"M'not sensitive," Harry protests into Draco's mouth, lifting his neck a little to follow when he pulls back. "Just don't know how to read you yet."
“I don’t even know him, really,” says Harry. “I don’t see how I can like someone I don’t know. Maybe it is a physical thing.” He doesn’t think so. It feels more substantial than that, but it’s too hard to explain. “I wish you’d stay. You’re good for me, you know?”
“That’s exactly it,” says Harry. He’s glad the lighting is limited to what’s coming in through the window because he’s flushed with all sorts of emotion. “Funny, though, isn’t it? All that pussy and it’s baby Death Eater in my bed.”
“Yeah, you are,” says Harry cheekily, and slides two fingers inside. He’s slightly looser than he was before because he, Harry, had fucked him half an hour ago. And that’s kind of a mindfuck. “Wish I’d known how much this shuts you up, I’d’ve started doing it years ago.”
"Harry," Seamus says (Parvati says "Seamus!" but he shushes her), "how many warnings do you get before the Aurors take you away for good?"
, to be safe.
“I don’t know,” Draco groans. “But it’s different. You’d just be, you know.” He cuts himself off and uses the baluster beside him to get up. “It’s different,” he repeats. “Where’s my shirt?”
“About an hour ago,” Draco says. The whole thing feels grotesquely domestic, like they're actually friends, and it makes his stomach go all sour.
look at Malfoy or think about plucking that absurdity of a navel ring.
Draco smiles. “Nothing at all.”
"True," Draco concedes, and leans across the bed, and kisses Potter at the seam of his lips.
you,” Harry says defensively, stung at being called out. “I said I don’t wanna hurt you. I’m a bit confused at the moment.”
"You are a fucking egotist," Draco says. "I've always said so."
Mentally weighing up the cons of Pansy's probing with the pros of a warm, naked Harry in his bed, Draco concedes. "Fine. I suppose we'd only have to get you past the common room."
“Ah,” says Draco. His satchel sits atop his workbench, the book he’d promised Potter is poking out. “Here you are.”
“Please,” Draco murmurs. Harry rubs the rough pad of his thumb across Draco’s soft, pale thigh.
It’s a thrill having Malfoy do what he’d asked, and he looks so fucking good bent over the rail with the moonlight turning his skin nearly translucent. “Stand up a second,” Harry says, and when he does he circles his arms around Malfoy’s waist in order to undo his trousers and pull them down his hips, kissing the back of his neck as he does. “I’ve got very little idea what I’m doing,” he mumbles into his skin. With one hand he traces the curve of Malfoy’s arse and dips briefly between his cheeks. “You have to let me know if I’m hurting you.”
and then continued to function like a regular fucking person.
"Yes, I guessed that much, you whited sepulchre. Plaster saint," Draco says. He was jesting (sort of) before, but now he's really feeling the bloodlust.
Harry can feel Malfoy looking at him finally but keeps his gaze on the floor, laughing when he mentions Ginny but leaves her unnamed. “Not really,” he says when Malfoy’s finished. He looks at him now, hiding nothing on his face. Not the resentment, or the anger, or even the longing he’s been feeling the last month. “And I ended things with Ginny. Officially. Much to the annoyance of everyone who agrees with you that that should be my future. Funny enough, though, after the fucking shithole that’s been my life since the day I was left on my aunt and uncle’s doorstep, I’d like to make some of my own decisions for a while.”
“— those are part of the castle’s ancient magic, you
"He's told me to fuck off enough times," says Harry sarcastically. "Does that count?"
“Yes,” agrees Draco, closing his knees tight around Harry’s. “It’s part of Canis Major. See the way it goes back there, and then into the tail?”
Harry lets himself be pulled into the kiss much too gratefully. He's missed this, kissing Charlie, but he's also missed doing this with
"Of course," Harry says. Close to salivating, he palms the outline of Malfoy's cock and watches him carefully. Ideally, he'd like to see him break. "Silly of me. You
“Mm,” Draco says. “
“Right,” Harry says, taking Malfoy’s pointed silence as an acquiescence. Trouble is he’s got no idea what to say. “Look, as you’ve probably gleaned for yourself, I’ve never actually — erm — done anything with a bloke. I’m sort of …” He sighs heavily, lifts his glasses and pinches the bridge of nose. Then he looks at Malfoy again and says, sheepishly, “I just want to be honest with each other as much as we can. And I don’t want to … erm. Hurt you. Or whatever.”
Harry looks behind him when he hears Malfoy's familiar drawl and immediately regrets it, because the first thing his eyes are drawn to is the inch or two of skin uncovered at his hip. It's very pale and looks very soft, which isn't fair since Malfoy's a prickly berk and deserves horrible skin. And a mouth that's less inviting, for that matter. Harry clenches his jaw as the soapy water starts filling the sink.
"Yeah, he wanted to race me," says Harry. He gives Charlie a shit-eating grin. "I won. He's getting a bit old, aren't you, Charlie?"
“Thanks,” he says weakly, against Harry’s mouth.
“Shut
“Pleasure,” Draco drawls. He stirs a few teaspoons of sugar into his mug, and tries not to think about the situation he’s in, but instead how he’ll spin it into an amusing little anecdote for Pansy and Blaise later tonight. Not that Pansy will buy it, but whatever.
“Well, he didn’t. He was in rather a rush when I got back, anyway.”
Granger's knock is neat and sensible, like those ghastly shoes she was wearing last time Pansy saw her at the pub. The
Harry slides his hands up from Draco’s hips to his waist, never breaking eye contact as he lowers himself. He wants to kiss him in the worst way. “Can you handle it?” he enquires, only half teasing.
Surprised by the shift in position, Harry lifts his eyebrows up at him. There’s something off in his voice, just a hint of something genuinely irritated. Pushing it out of habit, he says, “It’s not my fault you’re so horny about it.”
the next chapter (a whole ass double christmas special!) is going to be up on christmas 🎄❤️ see you then!
With a small sigh, Harry hops down from the table, grabs the bottle, and goes to get Rose from the other room. He'd known Ron wouldn't be any help — it's
an arrogant twat, so there’s that. Harry decides to tell him.
Draco smiles that lopsided thing that, despite its own best efforts, is far too genuine to be a smirk. “As much as it soothes my aesthetic sensibilities, this rug is murder on my bare arse. Onward, yes? To the
. He lifts a hand to his cheek and kisses him for real this time. “How long d’you suppose this can possibly last?”
Klaus chirps sleepily as Harry climbs into bed and peers at him through slitted eyes, as if to say,
Lifting his hips, he uses his knees to knock Draco’s legs apart and reposition himself between them. He grinds against him again with better leverage this time, still mouthing at his neck and under his jaw. “I’m a what?” he prods.
The kitchen door swings open, and then; “Why is Malfoy petting my child?”
He’s whining. Babbling. Something like “fuck, fuck, fuck, I’m
"So I didn't
“I’m sure you could come up with one or two.”
“When you say you want to call me Draco,” says Malfoy. “You mean you want to kiss me, no?”
, Potter. Period. I’ve no interest in waiting around for you like some lovesick schoolgirl.”
Harry tightens his grip around the base of Draco’s cock. “Do you understand, love?”
Draco turns the joint over in his hands and passes it back without bothering to pretend to hit it. “How cute of you.”
“No,” Draco says, the pretty flush on the back of his neck to Harry as he pulls him through pulsing music and writhing limbs and several spots slick with spilt drinks that Harry has to try his hardest not to trip on.
“Well I’m glad you’re more comfortable now, Seamus,” Harry says, and takes the joint from Ron to his left. “Incidentally so am I. I appreciate you reminding me whenever you get the chance.”
"Well there's nothing to worry about," he says. "Please, just ... don't talk to him about me, okay? It's weird and it'll drive me insane. And I promise
Draco lifts an eyebrow. “Splendid, thanks. Yours?”
keep fucking him. Nothing is physically stopping him. It's even possible they have enough time before anyone comes to use the lift that they might be able to finish, if they hurry. But it's only a maybe, and even through the fog in his brain Harry knows that’s not good enough.
“Meaning what, exactly?”
“I knew it,” Ron says, “you’re still hung up on him, aren’t you? Harry, it’s been weeks.”
“Here, get under it,” he says. And to the Fat Lady he gives the password again, to which she replies, “I’m trying to sleep, Potter. Going a bit far with these ‘Chosen One’ privileges, aren’t we?”
“Pitiful,” he spits. “Useless boy. Get out of my sight.”
He wants it to last forever yet can't find the strength to slow down and drag it out now that he's started. Gripping Malfoy's hair to keep him in place and far too turned on by that sense of control, Harry fucks into Malfoy's throat half a dozen more times and only manages a groaned "I'm gonna come" before he's shooting down that gloriously tight, wet throat and feels Malfoy swallowing around him.
“Charmed,” Harry says, crossing to where Malfoy is and tapping the branches with his wand so they untangle and retreat. The lantern over by the log throws ominous shadows over them.
"Fuck off," says Draco.
Instead he says, more tactfully, "And how did he find out about you?"
, you daft bint, not coddling—"
Draco says, “Mm.” He wonders where the book ended up, and thinks it’s somewhere near their feet.
"Wouldn't mind a bit," Terry says too quickly. "Coffee, Harry?"
Harry feels vaguely vexed, and confused, and terribly charmed. “What?” he says. And then, when Draco does nothing but laugh some more, “
“Mm,” Draco says. Harry takes his hand in the one that’s not on Draco’s cock and presses his lips to each knuckle.
Pointing at constellations has always struck Harry as comically useless. Or maybe that’s just because he’s bad at seeing them.
“You know,” says Malfoy, leaning closer, “they say sarcasm is the lowest form of humour.”
Ron looks up at him, earnest. “Proposing,” he says. “To you, mate.”
Harry doesn't say anything at first. It sounds like something Hermione would tell him — erring on the side of logic instead of emotion. He wonders sometimes if the Sorting Hat had thought about putting Charlie in Ravenclaw, like Hermione, but he's never asked.
on your
Draco ruins it by saying, in a thick, heady voice, “Your hands, Harry. Want them on me.”
?" Harry snorts, and then thinks he really shouldn't be surprised, actually. "No wonder Slytherins are so fucking neurotic." He uses his wand to light the joint, takes a hit, and holds it out in offer. "You'll like this more."
, Harry.”
She rolls her eyes at his contemptuous repetition of
“I believe the words ‘rough’ and ‘angry’ were used. He also told me you fought on Friday night.”
"How could I
"I don't trust him either," says Harry. "I just wanna finish fucking him so I can quit thinking about it."
“Don’t
“First tell me what the hell you’re doing out here,” he demands, walking closer. “You scared the fucking shit out of me.”
“He’s fine. You’re good down there, aren’t you mate?”
Hesitating a second, Harry abandons his drink to follow Malfoy out of the kitchen, frowning. “How’s that?”
Also,
“I can assure you, alcohol does not divest me of my wit.”
enjoy his company.”
bong. It’s all pretty standard fare whenever the lot of them get together at his flat.
She rolls her eyes. Magically pinned to the wall, of course. "And? Did he fumble through it like an oaf? How big is he? Details, Draco, how many times do I have to ask?"
"Nope. Stuck in a lift." He kicks some more snow around, eyes to the ground. "We have a bit of a history, he and I." And now he looks up again, pinning Charlie with his gaze. "D'you think less of me for it?"
He closes his eyes and tries to block out his surroundings, to find some minuscule vibration of magic in the dense air around him, and if not that then to access his own magical core through sheer will power alone. He does feel something heavy spark to life deep in his gut and for a heart-stopping moment the lift actually vibrates, but as soon as he's opened his eyes and looked wildly around, the spark is out like a flame and he feels powerless again.
“Mmph, please.”
“Ah, but would an egotist sacrifice his life for other people?” Harry says with a shit-eating grin. Draco’s very close, in his bed. He’s all Harry can smell. “I think not. I died, remember? Exempt from being an egotist.”
“That was
He stays downstairs in the living room after everyone else has finally gone up to bed, and he's not surprised when, ten minutes later, Ron comes back down as well.
"D'you mind not looking at my dick every time we're around each other?" he snaps. "It's already getting old."
When they start going at it like this, they're actually worse than Rose at her shrillest. And Rose can be quite shrill, with the impressive lung capacity of an Olympic swimmer. And it's worse than it was at Hogwarts, because they're married now so they're comfortable with one another and don't really hold back.
“I’m out. Who is it?”
“You eat it with crostini,” Draco adds, because he knows it’ll make Potter and Weasley roll their eyes.
Harry laughs against his cheek. He starts stroking more firmly, gathering wetness from the head to ease the slide. He's never done this to anyone but himself — the angle's weird — but he loves the noises it's getting out of Malfoy. "Now's as good a time as any to admit I'm right," he says into his ear.
“Does it have to be about forgiveness, though?” he says after a few moments. “Why can’t it be about ... I dunno. Accepting the past. Dumbledore told me ...” He sighs, shoves his fingers through his hair. “He said that remorse is really important. If ..."
“It’s the Dioscuri. Sons of Zues. Castor and Polydeuces,” says Draco. “That’s my star sign, you know. And yours is there. Leo, just by Jupiter. The star Regulus is at the tip.”
“And you saved me from a lake. In the Trournament. Triwizard Tournament.”
"He is a prat," Draco says, sinking back into the bath and leaning his head against the cool porcelain. He wants Pansy to stroke his hair again, so he makes a small noise and lolls it in her direction. "Do hate him."
It’s just. Malfoy's always been pretty. In a vapid, haughty kind of way, which doesn’t sound like a particularly good thing, but (unfortunately) is. Harry thinks it’s the aura of disdain as much as it’s the full lips and the long eyelashes and the fine bones of his face. Malfoy exudes fuck-off-you-peasant energy that both intimidates and entices.
. I stand by my decision,” he says. “So yes, more inadvisable than that. By a wide margin.”
"It's fine, I know no one liked her," he says sardonically. "The whole thing was fucked up. I dunno. I'm glad it happened, but. I'm glad it's over." He kicks some snow and mentally tries to prepare himself for bringing up the other thing he wants to talk about, but he can't get the words out yet. "Are you seeing anyone?" he asks instead.
Charlie told Harry he was leaving on Boxing Day. He'd meant to go in November, but Mum had convinced him to stay for Christmas. That ended up being the right thing to do, but still. Charlie missed his home. He missed his dragons, and big planes of hills and sky and nothing. He missed his work. He knew he'd miss Harry though, too.
“Perfect,” he says, “if death is coming for me I’d definitely prefer to go that way.” He kisses Draco’s jaw. “So what’s the charm?”
The first time they spoke, Malfoy had been sitting on one of the cushy green couches reading. He’d been like that, this year. Bookish. He was besting Hermione in half the subjects they shared. Perhaps Malfoy had always been a swot, only Harry hadn't noticed because he’d been a bitch far more prominently.
"A cunt. Fuck." Draco tilts his head back against Potter's pillow, wanting more of those teeth grazing his throat. "And I don't like you."
, Malfoy. I'll fuck off when you get that through your inbred little pureblooded brain."
Harry grits his teeth and tries valiantly to keep himself in check when Malfoy starts mocking him, like it’s a law of nature. He thinks it really might be.
Unfortunately, the only words that spring to mind as of right now are
Wine. He’s supposed to be looking for wine.
. Why don’t I put on some hideous rags and find some stupid glasses and you can pretend I’m golden boy when I fuck you, yeah? It’s time we get you past this once and for all.”
He looks at Ron to determine whether
Draco shifts his weight. “Unlike you, I like to consider my actions before I take them,” he says. “And, also unlike you, I’m not an idiot. You were the only one who could’ve killed him. So.”
Oddly enough, Harry thinks he kind of gets it. ‘Boyfriends’ sounds fucking ridiculous, to be perfectly frank. Especially in the context of the two of them.
“Quite possibly,” says Draco. “The cunt was the real deal-breaker, though.”
“Shove it, the both of you,” she says fiercely. “Good behaviour.” She goes to the door, puts on a charming little smile, and positively beams when she opens it on Draco sodding Malfoy.
Harry rolls his eyes and pushes off the guardrail, hands going to his pockets. "Right," he says. "Well. Good chat, Malfoy. I've learned all kinds of stuff I never wanted to know."
Realising he's caused offence, Draco wriggles his hand from Harry's grip and uses it to stroke his cheek. "I suppose I'm confused," he says. "I didn't think you were that serious about me."
“Aren’t we?” he says. “I like you very much, you know.”
“I can’t dance.”
“Could you cease with the histrionics? I was walking,” Draco says. He’d like to step back for the distance Potter is closing between them, but his back is already close to flat against the branches behind him.
Draco nods. “You wouldn’t want to put Weasley off his tapenade.”
could’ve been the one to kill the snake and get the points.”
Jaw tight, Harry finally gives up. He nods. “You got it, Malfoy.”
"Oh, that's very funny. I like my hair, thanks very much. At least mine isn't a shade of white that suggests inbreeding."
. And, of course, his last girlfriend. Who was a bint.) But still, Malfoy is another level.
"I dunno," he says honestly. "Jesus, do I look like I fucking know? I feel bad about ... what happened." God, he's, like, twelve years old, can't even say the fucking words. "I shouldn't've left you like that. And
Shrugging, Harry says, "Not entirely." He thumbs over Draco's chin and kisses him again. "I was already considering it ... there's a lot of reasons. Your wand was sort of the final decision-making factor for me."
"Merlin," Ron coughs (having snorted and then choked on a piece of bread), "and the fucking, shit, what was it?"
“I’m not
Christmas at the Burrow is one of Harry’s favourite things in the world, and it’s at its best when every last Weasley is there. Charlie hadn’t been, the last two years — probably for the best, since he, Harry, had been with Nat. And for some reason, the prospect of Charlie and Natalie interacting (because she had joined him at the Burrow for Christmas) was less than appealing. The tension between her and Ginny had been bad enough.
“Stop trying to divert, mate.”
?” Harry calls out. “I fucking see you there. What are you doing?”
I won't do anything stupid. Deal?"
"I can be very charming when I want to," says Draco.
“I bet they’d pay a hundred-thousand Galleons at least,” Malfoy muses. “Two hundred, maybe. For the Chosen Cock.”
“Looking,” Harry says.
“So this was a one-time thing is what you’re saying.”
Hermione says, "Noted."
What he
Harry’s eyebrows raise, surprised by the request. “Sure,” he says slowly, taking the wand back. His chest clenches again with emotion. There’s an implicit trust happening here that he dares not acknowledge out loud. He’s not well-practiced at Glamours but it doesn’t take too much skill to cover up what’s on Draco’s neck and soon the bruising is so faint one would have to be looking for it to notice. “There,” he says, returning the wand to his bedside table and smoothing a thumb over Draco’s neck. “Should hold up under all but the heaviest scrutiny.”
Harry frowns, caught off guard by that. He thinks of the forest and Narcissa asking after Draco.
Swivel. Malfoy drops his head back against Harry’s shoulder. “How so?”
"What does it sound like it means?" Harry says vaguely.
"You're fucking sick in the head," Harry laughs. He looks down at his watch and is surprised to see that it's already past three — funny post-war world where he passes time talking to Malfoy and finding out all kinds of fun things about him. Like how he's bent and does coke and has recently been disowned. "Well Hagrid's taken too unfortunately. But if I think of any other blokes with red hair and-or big hands I'll be sure to let you know."
Ankle squeeze. Ouch.
Hermione frowns. She wants to say that it's
That feels rather like stones, glass house, and so on to Harry, but he lets it slide, and presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead.
with me for that?” Harry says, somewhat sardonically. “I’ll do a better job of dying next time, shall I?”
, but doesn’t. He just says, “Guess I’ll see you round, then,” and gathers up his coat before stepping back into the Floo.
Harry could be all bright when he was properly happy, all sarcasm and beautiful golden skin. On good days they'd fuck in the kitchen, on the bench. In the shower, on the balcony (just once) or pressed up against a wall. On bad days Harry would come over in the evenings. He was usually quiet, but sometimes he'd talk after they fucked — always in the bed, when he was like that.
“The question was inane. Just ask what you really want to,” Draco says sharply.
Ron's good, though. Surprisingly enough, he's actually been the most helpful. Having him at the store to take Freddie's place wound up being the best possible decision for a lot of reasons: Ron's enjoying it, for one. And he's got a real knack for running a business, too. The other thing is that of all their brothers, Ron was always closest to him and Fred. Ginny too, but she's off playing Quidditch and is far too energetic and ambitious to like running a joke shop.
spent seven years loudly loathing someone and then tried to shag them five years later only to get essentially rejected halfway through the fuck, she thinks she too would probably have spent a week or two utterly mortified.
"Same as before," says Harry. He takes one last hit, tosses it in the air, and Vanishes it before it hits the ground. "I still like the Moonraker. Nothing's come out the last two years to rival it. For me, at least," he amends, taking the extra broom from Charlie. "The Harpies are using the new Stratus model, Ginny says she likes it. I've tried it — it's fast, but it's not dynamic enough, know what I mean? You can go as fast as you want, all you're gonna do is pelt yourself into the stands if you can't make a sharp turn at the last second."
Summers at Wiltshire had been perhaps the greatest joy of Draco's young life. The Manor's windows would be thrown open, with thin silk curtains that made shapes in the breeze and wide sills he could sit on while his pale skin pinked in the sun. Lucius would take him for walks in the fields of wild flowers, and turn their tissuey petals whatever colour Draco asked him to with a tip of his wand. His mum liked to sit outside with a careful array of protective charms over her smooth, porcelain complexion, embroidering under the East pergola or taking her tea down by the pond. When Draco sat with her, the house-elves would bring out jugs tinkling with ice cubes for afternoon tea, and cookies that had sweet violets pressed right into the dough. He'd lounge against the cool stones of the pavilion in the evenings, usually with Pansy by his side, until Narcissa demanded their presence at dinner or Pansy's terrifying bitch of a mother came screeching through the Floo.
“I told you I would,” Harry says, frowning. He moves closer and, a little hesitantly, leans in to kiss the corner of Malfoy’s mouth. “Didn’t we just establish that I like you?”
"What the fuck," he says, standing up and trying to ignore the warmth in his cheeks. "Are you kidding me, Hermione, why are you talking to Malfoy about this? And what the hell do you care if it's 'rough and angry'?" The words are heavy with sarcasm. "Aren't you the one always talking about validating sex or what the fuck ever? This has
"For the best," he says. "Any children of yours would be extremely defiant."
He touches his scar absently. Looks at Malfoy’s arm, then up to meet his eyes. “Can I see it?”
Malfoy looks not quite real in the moonlight with the softy falling snow as a background, nearly but not quite the same colour as his white hair. Going up next to him like that first night, Harry leans over the balustrade and glances at him. Then he takes the book out, and he hands it over.
“Can’t make that promise, dear boy. Don’t think I’ll ever have them, so.”
“First of all, don’t get any closer than you just did to insinuating I took advantage of you,” Harry says sharply. “Because I did
Malfoy grins broadly. “I’m a shocking fag, Potter. Or don’t you read the papers?”
Surprised and pleased, Harry says with laughter in his voice, “There’s, like, three or four of them. Don’t tell me that’s a yes.”
“Right,” he says eventually. “Well I had a lot of help and got really lucky.”
“Indeed,” Harry agrees. He pushes some of Draco’s hair off his forehead. “Now unless you fancy sneaking out of here under that cloak while everyone’s awake, we really should go.”
"Oh, fuck," says Draco. He's peripherally aware that Ron Weasley is asleep not five feet away, and that it might be fun to remind Potter of that, but he simply can't muster the words. Canting his hips up to get more, deeper, Draco lets his head drop back to the pillow and eyes fall closed.
Draco waves away the joint, but doesn’t move when the path opens. “Why?”
“Glad to know you were paying attention, Potter,” says Malfoy. He catches the eye of one of the bartenders and gestures expansively.
hurts. He can feel his flies digging into it. He hates Malfoy right now in a way he hasn't hated him since they were in school together.
He has to unbutton his trousers before he gets to his knees, making room for his painfully hard cock. He tugs Malfoy's further down his neverending legs and without much preamble pulls his cheeks apart, swallowing at the sight. "Keep your hands on the wall."
Draco scoffs. It’s languid, but it’s still a scoff. He rolls his eyes, too. “Don’t be daft, Potter. Of course I am.”
Harry mutters, “Pillock.”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco moans, as Harry teases his rim.
“That’s me,” he says finally. “World’s most selfish prick. You’re the one who’s obsessed with me, what does that say about you?”
Draco palms him again through rough, well-worn denim. “You're very hard, Potter.” His voice is too hopelessly breathless to be taunting, but Harry knows that’s what he’s going for, anyway.
"Oh, shut up, Ronald!" Hermione says, blood warm under her cheeks.
"Very well," Draco says. "I couldn't have done six, anyway. I was otherwise occupied."
He doesn’t pull out straight away, instead falling forward onto Draco’s slick chest, listening to the sounds of him breathing and coming down beneath him, lazily mouthing at the salty-pale skin of his shoulder.
“Doubt me if you must,” says Harry, reaching for his wand and handing it to Draco. “Believe me, I’ll enjoy gloating.”
Blaise looks as astonished as Pansy feels, which is quite out of the norm seeing as Blaise doesn't usually show feelings other than maybe contempt and satiation. She watches Draco go with a terrible weight in her chest and a cloying guilt clogging her throat. She looks at Blaise once Draco's out of sight, meeting his dark eyes. "I think he was crying," she says quietly. "I didn't mean— surely he knows we weren't ..." Taking the piss? Yeah, actually, they had been. But, Merlin, for him to have been reduced to
“Shut up,” Draco mutters. “He’s a fucking bore.”
“Good,” Blaise says. He pushes Draco’s shirt up, trails his fingers along the lines of his Adonis belt to watch goose bumps appear on his milky white skin. Then further up, where he plucks at the navel ring which matches his own. “He had his chance, right, baby? He doesn’t get another.”
“Did you get a look in at the internal Splinching from last Friday, Draco? That nurse — you know, the young one with the
Hermione nods politely, accepting the compliment, ironic as it probably is in nature. “Thank you,” she says. “It’s very fulfilling. I think Draco feels the same way.”
“Thank you," he says, "that’s nice of you to say. I wouldn’t actually know why they named me Harry seeing as I never got to meet them, but I bet it’s because they could already tell I’d be common.” He takes a long drag, holds it in his lungs a while and then exhales through his nose. “Yours fits you too since it’s stupid-sounding and pretentious.”
"Oh? Listen, Harry, I've gotta go say hi to everyone, but wait here, yeah? I reckon we've an hour or so before dinner. Can go for a quick fly and catch up."
It hits Draco then, when his abdomen begins to coil, what he’s actually doing. His Healer’s robes are bunched at his feet. He’s about two seconds away from coming all over them. He’s at
Taking a breath, he pockets his wand again and pushes a hand through his hair.
Draco really thinks he could come right there. Incredibly reluctant to turn away from Potter’s mouth, he groans but does as he’s told, forearms on the balustrade and Potter’s cock flush against his arse.
Draco says, and he can feel his cheeks colouring, "No, Potter, I don't think we shall. I've got shit to do — might come as a terrible shock, but not all of us can coast through on our reputations. I'll be taking my notes back, thanks."
Harry waves a hand (how is it that it looks all elegant and aristocratic when Malfoy does it? When he does it, it feels kind of grotesquely jovial.) “It’s okay. He wasn’t actually executed, did you know? Buckbeak.”
Pansy smiles lasciviously. "It's always worth a try," she says. "It's in my desk if you change your mind." And, returning to the point, "Anyway, it isn't about begging — well, it
"Oh, shut up, Ron," Hermione says. She whacks him on the back of the head with her wand, eliciting an exaggerated shout of pain. "And it's tapenade."
“Bonjour, Potter.”
Klaus is currently making his rounds, moving from person to person for pettings and attention not unlike a dog, which Harry has always thought was very funny. He’s on Neville’s lap at the moment looking like a grey loaf of bread with his eyes squinted in pleasure as Neville scratches his neck.
“I brought tapenade,” Draco says when Granger releases him, glancing down at the Stasis charmed dish. “I’m not sure why.”
Draco smirks. He really hadn't told Granger what he did to be contrary, but annoying Potter gives him the same thrill now as it did at eleven, so he decides he can believe what he will. "It was, rather. The three of you are so very close. I assumed they'd get all the finer details anyway. You told Weasely I had my navel pierced, no? You did have rather a vested interest in that particular little detail."
And then the worst occurs to him.
“I’m what?”
In the end, Lucius's absence didn't matter, because Draco learned that disobedience could be punished with pain far greater than anything his father had ever inflicted, that year.
Harry snorts half-heartedly. His eyes and limbs feel heavy and so does his sense of humour. He regrets packing the indica. It makes him too vulnerable to his emotions.
“What’s that?” says Harry. Both hands free, he lets them drift of their own accord. They find Draco’s arse. Of course.
“Right. So how long is temporary, then?” he asks.
—arse is glued to his pelvis. Harry really does get himself into the oddest little situations.
“And how do you figure that one?”
“Yes,” says Hermione, deciding to forego explaining she’d meant
“Whatever,” says Harry. “Sure.”
“Yeah,” Harry says. He brings a hand to Malfoy’s jaw, heart beating fast. “Me too.”
Harry and Ginny's break up had lasted for days, and this was one of them. "Did you know I like blokes now?"
Of course, Ron could be lying when he tells Harry he’s wrong, but Harry figures that if that ends up being the case when he eventually finds out, he’ll just give Ron a really good hex in the face. So it’ll all even out.
"No, you complete and utter twit. One
"I do not wish to discuss it," he says, stiffly. "Move on."
Ron doesn’t especially want to talk about it, either. It’s just that Hermione thinks he’ll fair better than she will, and if Ron’s not a good enough friend to put the whole Malfoy-in-a-sexual-context thing (which is completely nauseating) aside and have this conversation for Harry’s sake, he’s at least a good enough husband to do it for hers.
With a last stroke of the hair across his forehead, she pulls out the chair beside his and Summons her tea. “Let’s talk more about your career, shall we? I’m so interested. Are you ... working closely with Granger?”
“Lovely, thanks.” Yeah, not really, but Hermione suspects Terry doesn’t really want to hear about Rosie’s reverse cycling so late in the day.
of times I've seen you two spread out on top of each other after a fuck—"
Harry lifts his eyebrows when Malfoy pulls a cigarette out, surprised and rather amused, particularly by the Muggle lighter. "That was Jekyll's big mistake," he says, "thinking morals had absolutes. We all have good and bad tendencies, you can't neatly separate them into two ... I dunno, distinct personalities." He pauses, then adds, "Not really sure what the significance of the missing ingredient was, but it was a good plot twist."
“Sandwiches?”
“I think you should stop talking,” Harry says, taking Draco’s hands and pinning them above his head exactly like before. “Before I pummel you.”
Harry shoots an affronted look Malfoy's way. "A little refined for me, don't you think? Also it’s ugly."
“You’re a fledgling top. It’s endearing.”
Molly scolds them when they walk inside (as they’d known she would) but does so as she ushers them around the table to join everyone else. Harry takes a spot between Ron and Ginny and is glad to find that he’s ravenous, not to mention in better spirits than before.
Maybe it’s because he’s high, but when Malfoy calls his name ‘common’ Harry laughs. It reminds him of the Dursleys; he’s pretty sure Aunt Petunia accused him of the same thing once or twice or a hundred times.
“Good,” Charlie says. “Yes, Harry, good.” He’s about a hair’s breadth from coming as well, even though he usually has more stamina. He usually does, but not so much with Harry.
Nodding again, Hermione sets the liquor aside (mostly untouched) and stands. "Great. Well, thank you for inviting me here to talk. It was nice seeing you, Pansy. I'm sure we'll see one another again at some point. Is your Floo connected to the hospital?"
“I think maybe she’s tired, I’m gonna try to put her down. Did you feed her?”
He wipes his mouth and says, “Why are Slytherins so incestuous?”
"D'you not know how to turn the telly on or are you really as nerdy as Hermione?" Harry says, sitting down in an armchair and gesturing at the book he's holding.
It's just that
Annoyed with Hermione all over again for letting this happen, and now at Ron for misbehaving enough that she's decided to take him away for a patented Hermione Lecture, Harry looks deliberately away from Malfoy and grabs for his beer, which he finds empty.
Harry strains and makes a noise in his throat and digs his nails into Charlie's shoulder. Then he lets go, gets his hand between them and pops the button on his jeans. "Touch me," he says, getting his fingers around himself and shuddering. "Please."
“What the fuck,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron sighs. Harry’s doing the look again, and he really hasn’t missed it. “Are you gonna be annoying about this?”
“You first. Tell me about your first time.”
He’s expecting some sort of pushback, even just a small one, because it’s habit or because he needs to know Harry’s not fucking around. He gets none of it. “That’s it?” Harry says in disbelief, pushing off the rail and taking a step towards Malfoy, closing most of the distance between them. “You’re not gonna make me jump through hoops?”
So yeah, he’s not a baby expert. But he’s decent, and at least Rose knows him. Ignoring the fact for now that Malfoy is for no immediately discernible here in their house with their child, he goes over to him and takes Rose, setting her over his shoulder and bouncing her gently.
Ron says, "
Draco’s weird. He’s always been weird, since they were kids. There aren’t many Slytherins who are easy to read, necessarily, but Draco’s enigmatic to the point of being an isolationist when he feels like it. Too many times Blaise and Pansy have spent weeks knowing only something is wrong with him, but not what. It was the worst at school, particularly as they got older and sweet old Lucius dug his nails deeper into Draco’s neck, but in Paris things had changed a little. Just a
He hasn’t come to see it up close since bringing the wand back, too afraid of everything he’d feel. But the truth is, all he feels as he walks up to it is kind of sad and empty. One day he thinks he might ask to sit down with Dumbledore’s portrait and talk, but he’s afraid of it feeling shallow because it’s a painting. He supposes that relationship is one for which he’ll never really have the closure he wants.
“Bully for me,” says Draco.
"I've seen you
Hermione says, "Gentle with her head, yep, good job, Teds."
It’s funny in a cosmic kind of way, like if he could step outside of his body and enjoy the stupidity of it from without. But Harry doesn’t laugh, because he’s tragically tethered to his mortal carcass, which is currently sagging with the weight of his apparently tangible emotions.
compared to you. Merlin's fucking bollocks, Harry.
Ron knocks over a row of pawns in his haste to turn around. “Fuck no. Is that what you think I’ve been keeping from you two?”
It feels quite good.
"You want orders from me?" Draco prods.
Draco moans again, babbles something that sounds an awful lot like “shut up,” and rocks his arse back against Harry’s finger. Harry draws it away.
Harry feels rather than sees Draco pout. It occurs to him, then, that they’re not kissing. Just pressing closer against each other until there’s no space or sound between them, and muttering. “What’s wrong with my trousers?” says Draco.
“I was just really grateful, I think,” he says, laughing quietly against Draco’s cheek. “I mean, I didn’t really question it when I spoke to a snake at the zoo, either, so. I don’t know. Maybe I was in a constant state of Dursley-induced dissociation.”
"We'd never visit the kitchens. How plebeian."
He doesn't so much appreciate being called naive but Harry's brain is doing too much processing to get too upset about it. The Slytherins have full-on orgies, apparently. Goes well with the coke Malfoy mentioned once.
“You know,” Draco says thoughtfully, as Harry casts Cleaning Charms over his come-splattered chest and plies him with chocolate and forehead kisses. “I’ve always wanted to fuck under the stars.”
"I asked you a question," he says. He pulls his finger out and forces in a second when he slides back in, still foregoing lube just yet. "I'd answer it if you want me to fuck you eventually."
“Nobody took my wand, for fuck's sake!” Draco protests, staggering down another step or two and only just catching his balance. “How entirely pathetic do you think I am?”
It feels like a small win. Harry revels in it privately.
There’s even a mask on the scorched ground. The inky, red-scrubbed mark on Draco’s wrist twitches when he sees it. Fuck, shit.
“Mm,” Draco says. He looks up at the sky far above them. “I’m sure.”
"I thought I was clear about my rule," says Harry.
Draco looks at Harry with a raised brow. "
When the boy is gone (“good job, darling,” Pansy makes sure to tell him) and an oil lamp is turned on, she takes the strap off and tosses it aside, then pulls her knickers on.
"How the fuck do you sleep," says Draco, running a hand through his mussed hair, "with all that racket?"
Impassively, Draco says, "Ouch." He flicks away a stray leaf, blown in from the old yew at the tower's foot. "Hitting me where it hurts; my metaphorical abilities."
free to piss off? You're the one who insists on interrupting me anytime I find the tiniest sliver of solitude."
“So good for me, Draco— fuck,” Harry hisses, kicking his thighs wider and fucking into him fast and deep. He hears a tinkling smash, and suddenly everything smells like wine, as well as sex and sweat. Ah, fuck. It’s not on the rug, just the floorboards, but still. Dead. When Draco comes out of his haze, he’s so very dead.
When he comes, it feels not like the satisfying climax that comes after a steady build, but instead like something ripped from him when he wasn’t quite ready. Draco feels entirely out of control, his mind gone spacey from overstimulation and catching up to his body with a choked, “Wait, fuck.” It’s almost better, because hadn’t been clenched in anticipation, and the raw shock of it rolls through him with the orgasm itself. Draco comes, moaning in his own pleasure, vaguely aware of Harry’s cock still pounding, harder and faster, inside of him.
“Generous of you. I only got five for doing that troll in.” Harry’s brain has changed course. Less tight-smooth-want and more lips-soft-smokey-please. Which is equally unhelpful.
"You're not evil," Harry says, rolling his eyes half-heartedly. "I was just being a prick, I didn't mean it. You're so prickly, you just — you don't let me take a breath without making it a fight. Believe me, I've seen evil and it's decidedly not you. So you can quit acting like I think you're the scum of the earth because I don't."
“Enjoy your wet dreams about Malfoy!” Ron calls after him.
“Sure,” Granger says. “Take some biscuits with you. Thanks for clearing up, Draco. You didn’t have to do that.”
Blinking first while he processes the question, he finally laughs through a grimace. “Erm — sure,” he shakes his head, “it was Ginny, obviously. It was just a few days after …” He gestures vaguely. “I was. Erm. Having a hard time, you know. So she was staying over with me most nights.” He feels his face redden and laughs. “She was trying to distract me. Turns out it worked pretty well.”
Harry.
, which looks ridiculous between the two of them and would have sent Harry into a fit of laughter had he been in the mood for laughing. “You’re
“Hm? Oh. Well, you asked how we got here,” says Draco. He twists himself around so Harry can see one of his eyes (grey, heavy lidded) and the patrician construction of his profile.
Draco says, "Fuck Granger. We're going."
“Malfoy,” he says in the entrance hall, catching him before he starts descending into the dungeons, back to Slytherin probably. "Wait."
Draco snorts. “You really are very funny, Granger.”
"Not for Seamus, it isn't," Dean says grimly. "Ron, d'you remember that night he kept waking us up having conversations in his sleep? Harry, you were in the hospital wing. He kept —" he starts laughing suddenly, "— he kept saying, 'please, not the pudding, not the pudding!'"
“Don’t care, fuck, Harry."
Harry removes the hand that’s wound delicately around Draco’s neck, but he moans and shakes his head at that, so Harry releases his hip instead.
He drops the broom and sits down beside him again. Softly, he says, "What?"
“Why?” Harry frowns. “I’m sure there’s some kind of charm or something.”
“Harry. And shut up,” Harry advises.
, knowing
seems a bit dramatic, but that's rather to be expected, so.
There’s not a whole lot of distance to cover, but it’s crowded, and Malfoy is frequently interrupted.
Maybe it’s being back here, but when Harry hears footsteps cracking over twigs and dead leaves he goes automatically for his wand and stands up, breathing hard again. Then, through the darkness, he sees blond hair and realises who’s joined him — and who’s now trying to slink away again.
In answer to the question, Harry merely shakes his head. Then he shrugs, and says, "It's complicated." He swallows. "I don't think you've ever met Draco Malfoy, have you? Lucius Malfoy's son?"
“So that’s a no,” he says awkwardly. “Look … Malfoy …” He swallows. “I don’t — erm, what would you want to happen, exactly?”
“Will you just wait a fucking second?” he says quietly and spins him around. There’s noise coming from the Great Hall to their right, still going full swing, light spilling out under the doors. “I’m not finished.”
. It's because he's incredibly horny for Malfoy and had gotten it in his head he might be able to fuck him properly next time they saw each other, on
When they both have their drinks, he says, “Go on, then, who in Slytherin were you secretly being gay with while Parkinson played beard?”
Draco says — holding Draco to him with a hand splayed across his chest.
Harry stares at her, part confused and part horrified. "Pardon?" he says.
In truth, Ginny’s curious about a lot of things. How exactly it happened (because ‘they were stuck in a lift’ really isn’t an adequate explanation, in her opinion), how long Harry’s had a thing for Malfoy, how he can set aside all the stuff that’s happened between them. She doesn’t ask any of that, though. “How you are, I guess. You seemed happier last night but you were in a right mood earlier.”
“I thought we were going again? There was talk of edging you senseless. Et cetera.”
"Mm," Draco offers. "I've always thought so."
“Because. I want to call you Draco. And I like symmetry.”
Draco grunts a little, Harry’s thighs tight on either side of him. Skidding his nails along Potter’s back, he says, “How homosexual of you. What would your fans say if they found out you were a ponce?”
Draco said no when Granger asked him to watch the baby. He said no, and then Granger said please, and Draco said
Draco looks up at him. “Harry, I have no idea what you’re talking about. As per usual.”
And Draco is still thinking about Potter when he says ‘no, nope’, as if it will help in any capacity, and jams his finger into the ‘doors, open’ button about fifteen times.
He takes his cock out finally and huffs out a breath when he gets a hand around it, again using his own spit to ease the slide. It feels completely surreal when he lines up with Malfoy's hole, prodding lightly with the head but not pushing in.
Harry frowns. “Then where are they?”
, and of the two people I’ve slept with you’re the only one I left enough battle scars on to bother.”
Wait,
. Malfoy is, as Harry had accused him of before, gagging for it, and maybe it's a stupid idea for a number of reasons, and maybe he'll make a fool of himself, but he doesn't so much care anymore. Heart racing, he finds the flies of Malfoy's trousers and opens them, then slips his hand inside to find no pants underneath them. Just Malfoy's very hard cock, which Harry grips loosely and tugs. He kisses his jaw, asks, "What do you want?"
When they reach the corridor lined with portraits of food and the one at the end hiding the kitchens behind it, he looks at Malfoy.
Draco says, “
I usually am," Harry says facetiously, though almost out of habit his hand goes to his hair in yet another fruitless attempt to flatten it. He's
Babies are significantly more work when they're outside of you, she's found, even with the several months paternity leave Ron's taken from the shop. Hermione is very, very happy, but she's also tired a lot, and stressed a lot, and no longer wishes to spend the precious little free time she has fretting over Harry, who is now very much a functioning adult.
?" Hermione says, sounding more aggressive than she really meant to because she's still keyed up at Ron. "Did you come over yesterday, Harry?"
Without his glasses Harry can't see Draco's face well enough to assess his expression, so he keeps his own neutral when he asks, "Do you think so?"
, admittedly, been nice. He'd read it at night, in bed, where Hermione couldn't see and harass him about it. "I liked it a lot. I always knew, like — you know, Jekyll and Hyde. But I didn't know the whole story. And I think you're wrong, by the way — it's not about black and white morality, it's about the exact opposite."
, he ignored it. He said fuck off. No thanks.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose, but leans on the sticky table all the same. “Where’ve Weasel and Granger run off to?” he says. “Quicky in the loos?”
“Oh well. Terribly sorry about all that. Et cetera. I think I might’ve been a sociopath in my youth, don’t you?”
"Thank you, dear." She levitates a cup in front of him and fills it with tea, then adds three lumps of sugar and a bit of milk. It's the way he's taken it since he was a child — always a sweet tooth, that one. She smiles fondly to herself as she stirs it and then slides it over to him. "I've taken to gardening as a hobby." She gestures around the conservatory, spacious and open with vines crawling in through artful gaps in the glass ceiling and bursts of colour from strategically-placed flower beds. Sometimes 'hobby' doesn't feel quite the right word.
Harry frowns at him. "What's that got to do with you not being allowed your wand?"
,” Pansy fairly orders him. “Now, Draco. It’s almost one in the morning, I don’t have time for your histrionics. If you’ve done something illegal you can go to Blaise, I’m too busy right now for this.”
And there he is when Harry rounds the corner, sitting against the opposite wall facing the Room of Requirement, just below that bizarre tapestry.
Instead, Draco makes a soft little sound of satisfaction and Harry frays at the seams with wanting him.
," says Draco. He rests an elbow either side of Harry's head so their faces are impossibly close.
Draco studies Potter’s face. His mouth is a hard line, and he looks vexed, still, but not like he’s lying. “I don’t know how to talk to you, though,” he says. “If you don’t hate me.”
“Yes,” Malfoy agrees. “Tousled. Tousled by a herd of wild Hippogriffs.”
“Fuck,” says Draco.
It’s too good to be true that when Harry goes to see Hermione at Mungo’s two days later he doesn’t run into Malfoy. He’s been dreading it, almost asked someone else from the office to go for him, but that would be ridiculous. And also pathetic. He can’t avoid St Mungo’s for the rest of his life, not when seventy-five percent of his arrests land themselves there after putting up a fight.
It's true, of course, she
It's been relatively quiet since the trouble in Kent, which is probably good in terms of him not getting himself into further trouble because he can't fucking focus, but he also despises sitting around and doing nothing. Days like this, he and Terry usually wind up throwing a Quaffle between them with the Wireless on. Harry's got his feet up on the desk, proving highly detrimental when the door opens suddenly and he fumbles Terry's last pass, also resulting in him kicking papers everywhere.
