For some reason, cold clung to the dark chamber. Despite two huge fires blazing at either end of the hall, the walls and floor retained the winter chill. Voldemort smiled as he watched his trusted minions try to conceal their faint shivers, some with more success than others. Only two were truly immune besides himself. They stood front and center with unwavering devout gazes that burned with fanaticism and magic that had been stripped of inane rules and rationalism. Wild and untempered, power beat in their veins ready to be unleashed at his bidding.
"We need to talk to Neville alone," Hermione said firmly. She was too tired and grim to play games. "Go away."
"It's taking too long," Draco spoke suddenly, making Shadow jump. "Severus should have responded by now."
how awful it was - would willingly consider a relationship with another boy. Surely Shadow was just confused! Or it was Seraphim’s doing!
Sudden panic speared through him, making his palms sweat and his lungs to tighten. Rodolphus was the only thing in this place that kept him sane. He'd fall apart without his help. He couldn't count all the times the man had cleaned him up and encouraged him to have hope. He even snuck him food and water instead of the stale bread Lucius fed him.
"What are you doing here?" Ron asked when he found Shadow waiting patiently at the portrait hole before lunch.
Shadow got comfortable in the tree branches. It felt right, being up here. He felt as sturdy as he did on the ground and he allowed his mind to drift. He had felt awkward about his eyes from the beginning. Now it was a hundred times worse. He closed them tight, knowing that even in his lynx state his DNA had affected them. Instead of two golden eyes, one was a deep amber.
"Focus on me," Draco urged. He reached over and placed his hand on his friend's shoulder, the other coming up to gently pull Shadow's chin around so the brunet was looking at him. The blue and green eyes were glazed, lost. Draco blinked slowly, feeling calm and centered. Nothing was wrong. They were safe.
"He found me in the park, upset. The Muggles had seen me coming from the direction of our house and there were rumors about the people who lived there. They acted like I carried the plague. They were short and abrupt, and the children were worse. They called me names and even threw rocks. Anyway, Father found me. He grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me lightly, saying never to run away like that again. Then he grabbed me into a hug and carried me all the way home."
Draco closed his eyes at this simple sentence. "I'm so sorry." He really was. It hurt him to hear that. He took a deep breath. Time for the hard questions. "Are you going to go kill those people who hurt you?"
"It's actually pretty serious. I mean, he said he loved me out loud, and recently I was shown without a doubt how much Draco cares for me."
Umbridge hovered beside him for several minutes, but Shadow wouldn't start until she backed away. She giggled and drifted back into her ornate armchair behind her desk. Sighing a little, he opened the first book. It only took him three seconds to figure out what this detention was about.
"The numbers are against us. Sheer magical strength is against us. But we have cleverness, self-sacrifice, and selflessness on our side. It doesn't matter what they throw at us, we ARE the stronger because our people are that much stronger! Severus has labored to create a potion to even the field a bit and has produced something miraculous. He's made enough Merlin's Brew for all of us to have a single dose. Kingsley."
Tonight would be their fifth; they had been going to Umbridge since they confessed on Tuesday. In response, cold determination, hot defiance, and an earthy sense of stubborn endurance filled his senses, but the twins' faces didn't betray them just as Shadow had predicted. They smiled identical smiles that didn't match the dark conglomeration that flared around them at the mention of their punishment.
"I didn't know where else to put him. I can have Omi bring in another bed…" Remus rushed to explain.
"I made certain to retain your things," Severus said and handed Shadow his jewelry (the portkey ring tuned to his blood, the summoning bracelet, and his piano necklace) and his new wand. "Now come. Follow me quickly."
His brother was a mess. His face was bone white and his eyes flickered rapidly behind his thin eyelids. He was unresponsive and deep burns covered his arms and torso. George realized with a sudden sense of fear that the wounds could prove to be fatal if he didn't get his little brother to help soon, but what about the others?
Seraphim stirred, echoing his cries with devastated whimpers that only he could hear. Then, like mercy, the pain began to fade, the spasms to still. Two normal, light green eyes opened. Harry Potter lay panting, covered in sweat, and trembling with reaction.
Draco stared at his friend. He was worried by the calm manner Shadow had adopted lately. No matter what came up, he took everything in almost apathetically. Was Shadow despairing? Was he giving up? His eyes cut to Severus, the one person who might be able to know what his son was thinking and help him through it.
“You wouldn’t forgive me if I’d killed your parents, Neville!” Shadow accused, voice wrecked with distress and guilt.
Ron knew that the two had fought together in the caves and almost came close to dying. That was sure to bring two people closer, but this seemed like they were more than just friends. Ron’s blue eyes settled on his sister. Ginny really liked Neville. He had been surprised at first, but over the last few weeks he realized just how serious she was about their relationship. She blew up at anyone who teased Neville even a little, and the way she practically doted on him made her feelings clear to the whole House.
Draco smiled and brushed a loose lock of hair off her face. "Go to sleep. You're going to need to be rested if you're going to see Seraphim tonight.” It was only early afternoon, but Draco had a feeling they had a long night ahead of them.
"What happened? How? I saw you fall!" Shadow exclaimed, his voice thick with emotion as he pulled back to stare up at his father.
"I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't understand. You're not messed up, Shadow. Of if you are, I’m messed up in the exact same way. I like it like that, too. It's not weird. I just didn't know if it was okay for you. I think it's obvious that it's perfectly fine for me." He smiled into Shadow's eyes, hoping he would be forgiven.
"Draco Malfoy chose that moment to arrive on the scene," Severus said evenly. He watched Harry's eyes get wider, but there was very little reaction as he described the headmaster's death. Now it was his turn to scowl. "Well? Explain yourself."
He slipped his backpack off his shoulder and reached in for his broom. Unshrinking it, he took a deep breath and Apparated, vividly recalling the mouth of the cave, the rush of wind, and the hungry roar of the ocean.
Severus was confused. Her suddenly relaxed body language and her confiding tone threw him completely. "I'm sorry I have no information. I've been home recovering and planning."
He stood there, as if he were a real spectator, in that graveyard. It was as if he were the one bowing down before the disfigured, grotesque being that was the reborn Dark Lord. Red evil eyes and flickering long tongue, the creature was disgusting. Draco heaved but had nothing in his stomach to vomit.
Shadow came out of the Pensieve, landing on the floor near his father's bed. Severus was sitting at the desk in the corner and he looked up with his usual impassive eyes. Shadow was appalled to discover his own lips were trembling and that he had tears in his eyes. He wanted Amalia to walk through the door and smile, come over with a bright laugh and hug him, as if to say 'What took you so long?'.
Draco staggered from the forceful landing; his grey eyes opened wide as he stared at the being bearing down on him.
. I murdered Moody! I should turn myself in to the Ministry and let them lock me away! But then who's to stop the fucking Dark Lord from capturing and torturing me then? I might as well wrap myself up in a bow and hand myself over to him now!"
Draco took one look at himself in the mirror and asked to excuse himself, voice soft, pained. Shadow shot a look at the frowning Severus and Sirius and went after him. A discrete spell unlocked the bathroom door and Shadow slipped inside. Draco was leaning on the sink, forehead pressed in the mirror, tears dripping down his cheeks.
"He's not stupid. And Madam Longbottom isn't a pushover either. They'll be fine." Shadow ignored him and headed for the stairs. "Where are you going? Aren't you hungry?" Draco called after him.
Severus always had a way to see right through his son, but the Potions Master was getting further details out of Salazar, not even looking in their direction. His face was pale and there were fatigue lines around his eyes and mouth. Draco had no idea what the man had been working on, but he wished it didn't consume so much of his time.
to see him. Viktor opened the door with his usual public scowl. The expression stayed until Hermione stepped inside and they were safe behind his very strong wards.
When Shadow's mood didn't get any better by Friday, Neville decided he had waited long enough. He practically ambushed Shadow after lunch and dragged him to an unused classroom. Shadow stared sullenly out a window while Neville sighed and sat next to him.
"That's ridiculous." She shook her head with exasperation. "But I love you. Don't keep something like that from me again."
Draco grabbed his wrist to better read the long article. It seemed that Broderick Bode, age 49, had been admitted to St. Mungo's at the end of last week and had been strangled by a potted plant last night while recovering at the hospital. They shared a meaningful glance.
Shadow felt a pang in his chest, reminded painfully that Severus had had a daughter, Tabitha. He remembered the precious baby held in Amalia's arms from his father's memories he witnessed in the Pensieve and had to press his face in Marissa's hair for a moment to cover his lapse. He didn't want Marissa to think he was afraid of his father. She would never trust the Potions Master if she thought that.
Next, he had to go back to Hogwarts and have a long talk with Salazar who obviously overlooked some things concerning Seph/Seraphim. To keep them straight in his mind he was going to call the wolf-bird creature Seraphim and the human alter Seph from now on.
Neville watched the portrait hole close before wandering back to the couch. He gently stroked the snowy owl's feathers. Hedwig cooed and gently nipped his fingers. "You did good, Hedwig."
Shadow stood and helped Draco to his feet. He cast a subtle charm to clean Draco’s face of tears, but he was still pale and shaky. “You okay, Draco?"
normal. All types of people find love with others of the same sex. It makes them neither good nor bad. People's actions in the world do that, not their actions in the bedroom," Severus said firmly, holding his son's gaze.
Draco had grabbed some T-shirts, shorts, pants, plain dresses, underwear, and tennis shoes for Marissa, but since they knew the "princess" dress fit, they figured the rest would as well. They moved to the cash register. The woman cooed at Marissa and the teary-eyed girl smiled at her tiredly and offered a little wave. They walked out with four large bags full of clothes for Marissa.
"Oh put a sock in it, Snivellus," Sirius scowled. The only thing keeping him in his seat was Remus' firm grip holding him down.
Seraphim jumped at the noise again and his scowl deepened. Looking at Draco sideways, he said, "We could go now. Go where no one will hurt us."
Shadow took a shaky breath and lowered his wand. "We have bigger things to worry about. The Horcruxes for one. It doesn't matter."
The murmurs grew louder and the tone was not at all pleasant. Accusation and disgust beamed down on him causing Shadow to grind his teeth. Severus couldn't expand on that answer since he was pretending to be dosed with Veritaserum! These bastards were herding him into the most implicating answers possible.
Severus had already taken off at a dead sprint back toward the house. Padfoot barked and raced after him, Draco following behind. The werewolf cast his eyes back to the oak tree. It had definitely not been there before. How could Neville be at the house with Shadow and yet he was here in his Animagus form?
Shadow moved with him, his body falling into step with his own. It was the most incredible feeling, like they were on their brooms and racing side-by-side at insane speeds.
"I'm not sure we want to interrupt them. It might distract them and get them killed. They're dealing with some pretty Dark stuff. Besides, I think we can manage without him for a few days," Shadow added, flicking his fingers in a show of indifference. Both Draco and Neville saw straight through the act and to the worry that really lay under the casual words, but wisely neither remarked on it.
"But that still doesn't justify him keeping the Order in the dark, Neville," Hermione persisted, her eyes pleading with him to understand her point.
Sitting up, arms wrapped around his stomach to keep the joy bubbling underneath his skin from escaping, he looked around the small bare room. Furniture-less, his eyes were immediately drawn to the people occupying the small space. First under his scrutiny was Longbottom, who lay as still as death next to him. It was immediately apparent that the Gryffindor wasn't fairing well. He was ghastly pale and thinner than Severus remembered.
"All here have witnessed the pledges these couples have made to each other to be faithful in mind and body and to support each other materially and spiritually for as long as they have beating hearts. Do any present doubt the ability of these four to adhere to these vows?" Minerva asked with sharp eyes as she took in the group.
"If a person with such qualities, the qualities that you just described, came into your life and offered you a chance at the type of happiness you
Neville stopped breathing. He stood frozen, his eyes wide and wild, but nothing moved; no demonic murderer jumped out and grabbed him. Releasing his breath in a sobbing hiss, he stepped away from the wall and cringingly looked into the room.
Draco nodded and went to his friend's side. Shadow looked up at him, panting for breath, tears still spilling freely down his face as Draco knelt. He pulled his friend up into a sitting position and into a hug. Putting his mouth near his ear, he whispered fiercely, "It's going to be okay, Shadow. We'll figure this out. I'm not going anywhere. You hear me?"
"But they don't… naturally fit…" Shadow desperately didn't want to talk about this, but he found the strength somewhere to force himself to sit and listen further.
Severus shifted, breaking the uncomfortable moment, and turned to the cauldron. "Dice the lizard eyes, if you would."
"Thank you." Severus came forward and pulled Shadow into a loose embrace. Shadow took deep, rapid breaths, trying vainly not to cry. "And I'm so proud of you. I suspected things would move in this direction since the end of summer."
"Come on, Ron. We have to spread the word!" Hermione grabbed her friend by the arm and dragged him down the corridor.
Neville looked down the hallway, and seeing no one, he hurried across and knocked on Remus's door. His mentor opened it with a welcome smile and gestured the Gryffindor into his quarters. Neville felt his muscles relax as he settled onto his comfortable couch.
"I don't know, Draco," Shadow drawled with mock concern. "I've heard they've upped their practices and have gotten a lot better. Chang is at the top of her game and the Keeper is tough to get past. Plus the whole school will be cheering for them."
"You haven't come talk to me for a while," she pointed out. In the soft light of her Lumos, she looked almost like a ghost. The only thing colorful about her was her intense blue eyes. "I've missed you."
"I don't know, but you'll warn him, won't you? I can find my own way to Luna's," Neville said as he flung things in his trunk.
"It worked!" Griphook exclaimed excitedly, his grip tightening. "He's going toward the Lestrange vault, not the Black."
"Think on it. I do not require an answer immediately," Severus spoke, breaking the tense silence. He inclined his head again and left the room as quietly as he entered.
Draco felt like his heart was breaking as Shadow's voice tightened with tears and broke off, the piano continuing for him. The music became relentless and the captivating melody filled Draco's head. Backing away, he shut the door, cutting off the sound of his friend's pain.
"Hey, Marissa. After breakfast, I was wondering if you wanted to play with me," Sirius asked, hoping the invitation would be accepted. He didn't really have any other ideas for the kid. "I'm kinda bored and these guys plan on getting some work done. How about we have some fun instead?"
He'd attacked Draco as a cat and the blond had chased him all over the house until he'd cornered him in the sitting room. Shadow had pounced and torn his shirt. Furious, Draco had drenched him with cold water and taken one look at him before bursting into laughter. Shadow had rumbled a growl as he shook himself, flinging water everywhere.
He suspected that somehow the spirit portkey had invoked both Demon's and Boy's Animagus at the same time. No wonder the creature was so confused. A werewolf and an injured dove weren't exactly compatible. If he released the Animagus transformation, would Demon be back? Or would the two alters still be combined? Or would it be Shadow? Draco didn't think he could handle facing Demon again, but he couldn't just sit like this forever. He was beginning to freeze. His feet and hands were already numb. He moved, lifting his wand to cast a warming charm. The creature snarled and lashed its wounded wing forward to knock Draco's arm down. The dark avian eyes stared unblinkingly.
Draco shuddered, remembering what he'd witnessed from his father's Pensieve. It wasn't Neville he was visualizing, though. It was Shadow; it was always Shadow. The fact that his lover now looked like Harry didn't help, since that was the face he'd had then.
Her morning tea slid down her throat and she sighed with pleasure. There was nothing like tea first thing in the morning. She wasn't aware that the twins were staring at her avidly. She wasn't aware that a talk with the house elves that morning guaranteed that their potion would be slipped into her drink, the drink she had just finished.
They played like this for over an hour before Boy wore himself out. He curled up in a tight, protective ball and fell asleep while Draco continued to make the firework animals for him. As soon as he was asleep, Severus transformed and spelled him to make sure Shadow would remain unconscious for a while. Draco covered his face and wept. Severus crouched and held him, feeling the same grief-stricken burn in his own chest.
"It was my understanding that the room did such things for you," Draco drawled, eyes still burning angrily at her.
"I can be disguised. And it's not like you're not wanted by those fools, either!" Sirius protested, scowling at them.
Finally, the man cleared his throat and glared semi-menacingly at the smirking teen. "My care for your wellbeing is more personal than a mere wish to help you. When I said I'd be honored to have you as my son, I meant every word."
Sirius muttered but obediently turned his attention to Shadow like everyone else. What he heard blew him away. He was so shocked he couldn't even react for a second. Finally, he jumped to his feet. "WHAT? How could he… His
"You got a D?" Ron was baffled. He had gotten a P, one grade up from a D. How had he done better than Hermione? It was impossible! "You must have read it wrong." He grabbed her paper from her limp hands and saw the big, black, spiky D on top. She had detention for the following three nights. "Dear Merlin…" Ron literally felt like the world was tilting under his feet. He couldn't comprehend the situation. He felt further confused when a small smile spread across Hermione's face.
The owl obediently flew to the end of the table, making Shadow jump back with a startled hiss. There was a blurring of the creature's edges and, within seconds, Luna sat on the table, kicking her feet and smiling brightly.
Severus sighed. Closing his eyes, he pinched the bridge of his nose. "Considering how thin he is spreading himself this year, it is no wonder that he had a breakdown." He looked at the blond and allowed disappointment to fill his eyes. "You may return to the dorm. Shadow will be staying here for the night. He'll see you at breakfast."
"We're at war," Shadow said softly. He wished he hadn't said anything. He hadn't meant for them to get upset like this. "In a war, you are forced to do extreme things to protect yourself and your people."
"There's only one thing left," she protested. "He killed his grandmother. Put the piece of his soul that broke off into his familiar. A big snake, a constrictor, I think. Because S-Slytherin was the best of the four Founders, and snakes should be h-honored above all other animals. He got the idea to make Slytherin House royalty almost. He'd find relics of the three other Founders and make them Horcruxes, too, to show his mastery over them. But not Gryffindor. That House, the House of Dumbledore, would be e-erased. After finding out his future self was destroyed, he hated Gryffindor even more because Harry Potter was in it… That's all I remember."
"They see my coming here as a betrayal of our beliefs." Firenze reached out his hands, palm up, and held them to the sky. "We see the events of the world play out above us. It is a pattern that cannot be altered by mortal hands. And yet… There is a time of divergence in the stars, where two paths can be taken."
Harry woke abruptly. He wasn't panicked, but there was no fading up from sleep, either. One minute his eyes were closed, the next he was staring at his ceiling. The curtains on his window were cracked and he could see the night sky. He doubted it was the same night as the ritual and hoped not too many days had passed since his birthday.
"A baby…" he repeated faintly. Shaking his head, he buried his face in her soft, spiky yellow hair. "I don't deserve you."
With a shock, he realized he was holding Draco just as tightly as the blond was holding him. His body was pressed against Draco's, and for one brief moment, he wished he could melt into him and disappear for awhile where it was safe. Blushing bright red, he pulled out of the embrace and hooked a few curls behind his ear nervously.
"Hermione, you're helping with this, so why don't you sit up here with me?" Shadow asked, pleased things were going well so far.
Neville and Draco waited for Shadow. First Sirius and Remus came out. By their expressions Shadow's dressing-down had cut right to the bone. Neville bit his lip unhappily, but Draco had a slight smirk on his face. In his opinion, Shadow was completely in the right and the others should feel horrible about what they had kept from him.
After that, breakfast was an unusually silent affair. Neville couldn't help but think it was an improvement. This was his second day being home, and he wondered when his grandmother was going to realize he wasn't going to let her beat him down anymore. He hoped she figured it out soon because it was getting harder to stay calm in the face of her non-ceasing jabs. Maybe he would write Ginny while he was outside. That always made him feel better.
"I don't want to be Harry Potter," Shadow said firmly, glaring at the opposite wall, but that slowly melted into a crafty expression. "Maybe… Maybe I don't have to be him…"
Severus didn't argue. He pulled out his money purse and deposited the right amount into the old man's hand. They ignored the old man glaring at their backs as they swiftly left the store.
Not ten minutes later, Severus left the pub and called out for Shadow. Getting no response, Severus hurried over to the nearest shadowed corner, figuring that was where his son would have gone to answer the call. His boot crunched on something. "Lumos," he whispered. Soft light gently revealed the shattered compact. Severus jumped to his feet, quickly scanning the street, but his son was nowhere to be seen.
Now the Aurors were reporting directly to him and he had a reports by the stacks of people saying their young adult children, nieces, and nephews were missing. Business owners were complaining that Death Eaters were marching into their shops and demanding money or else their shops would be destroyed. Everyone was clambering for protection. The papers were beginning to demand Harry Potter. Fudge had said he had him hiding away in training, but that wasn't going to hold much longer.
"Feast, my beauties," Voldemort whispered, desire and anticipation silkening his voice. "Leave no one alive. Destroy them all."
The second was none other than Neville Longbottom. The teen seemed to have grown another half-inch and had lost even more weight as his extra baby-fat was finally being put to use during a rapid growth spurt. Now he stood at least five feet and ten inches tall; four whole inches taller than Shadow.
"I wouldn't want to be a part of any group that would order me to hurt a kid who could be helped," Tonks said seriously.
"I'll take Neville up to see his family," Tonks offered. "Arthur won't want too many visitors at once. It ought to be just the family first."
are going to do nothing. You are going to stay here and out of trouble; you've caused enough as it is.
"That is my opinion as well." Severus gestured briefly with his hand toward the door. "Let's get some sleep. We'll start again when the sun sets."
It was tedious, but they scoffed at the task, amused that she would think it would make any impact on them whatsoever except to make them annoyed. Tonight was their last detention and they expected it to be the same as all the ones before. It wasn't. Umbridge cast a Dark Arts spell of some kind. It transferred their almost eleven hundred lines total onto their backs, the hated words etching themselves into their skin.
But Shadow was lost. He was rocking, silent tears drenching his face. "He'd do that. He'd suck and kiss, and it felt so good. I just let him do it as long as it was good. Just laid there and begged him not to stop. It felt good, so good. But I didn't want it. I didn't WANT IT. But I couldn't move, couldn't think past the pleasure. I couldn't
"Oh, yes!" She took off running toward the statue but then froze, her eyes wide and worried. "But what about my pretty dress?"
Draco looked back at Demon. The dark being stood, bloody up to the elbows; the ruby liquid dripped from his soaked curls and spattered his face. He was still smiling, his eyes blazing with a hateful rage that would never be satisfied….
"I'm sorry, Neville. I should have listened to you," Ginny said softly. "I just don't seem to be able to do the right thing by you. I'm so sorry."
Viktor pushed her away so he could looked down into her face, his dark eyes worried. "What is the matter, Herm-inny."
Draco took it gently and removed the charm, returning it to its rightful size. Needing to move, he walked slowly as he read the message:
"I hardly think seeing you lounge in a bed three times too big will teach him anything about Dragon pox." Neville was panting, he was so angry. His face was red and his fists were clenched at his sides. "It's no wonder your sense of reality is so distorted if you actually think
Severus sat silently as he considered how to address his son's concerns. Shadow was staring intently at the wall, his cheeks red and his hands clenched together so forcefully that his knuckles were white. "The situation you are both in is complicated, and I am certain that Draco is equally confused. I suggest that when you are more comfortable, you talk to him about it. He's the only one who can help you come to a mutually acceptable resolution."
Hermione was looking at him with a huge smile that lit up her whole face. Ron blushed. Whenever Hermione looked at him like that - and trust me, it was very rare - he was forcibly reminded of why he loved her.
Shadow cleared his throat. "I… ah, couldn't sleep…" he gestured at the rows of books behind them. "I thought reading might help me relax."
Fred stood up next to his twin. "Are you saying that there's no chance of being attacked or wounded? That each and every one of us will have our own Auror bodyguards to defend us?"
"Leave him. I don't think he'll be coherent for a while even if he wakes up," Shadow answered with a shrug and moved forward, turning down the right hand corridor.
Neville wasn't nearly as sick as he was when Demon woke to go after Lockhart. It seemed Boy's magic softened the effect of Demon’s. He still wasn't well when he was taken to an emptied sitting room and seated on a couch. Charlie, Shacklebolt, and a pale-faced McGonagall stood in front of him and made it clear he wasn't leaving the room without giving them answers.
Severus felt his expression harden. He remembered the Carrows very well; they were both sadistic and malicious. Apprehension and cold anger for his Slytherins rose into his eyes and Minerva smiled at seeing it.
Seraphim wrapped his arms around his chest, immediately missing his jacket, as his breath came in quick gasps. Seraphim couldn't take his eyes off the pale, exposed throat. With no outlet for his anger, no source to feed it and keep it growing, he swung straight back into fear. Severus was part of the pack; he had submitted. He couldn't hurt him. It was his job to protect him, but how could he do that when he didn't understand? This place that was safe, wasn't safe? The place filled with humans and where Neville was stolen away to be hurt, that place
, but you don't see what's right in front of you! All you see is a lightning-shaped scar and the supposed obligations he should have to bear because of a prophecy! A prophecy I know, by the way, and let me tell you, it doesn't say anywhere in it that he has to enslave himself to the Wizarding world. He doesn't owe us his life or sanity!"
different from the norm. Most people would be dead in your shoes and you know it. You're special…" Shadow winced at the term. "You
Charlie lifted an eyebrow at the silent Potions Master, but Severus merely shook his head and asked, "What are your plans?"
Severus understood. In fact, Draco had rescued him and played interference with Seraphim more than enough. It was time for him to stand on his own. He met the alter's eyes, keeping his expression calm and non-threatening. "Seraphim. If you wish to stay here, I will do everything in my power to help you. I will search for food and help install protections around the house. However, I feel that it is my duty to keep the pack safe. This place is vulnerable because it is where you brought us after freeing me from the other pack. That pack will be looking for me and might follow us here."
The voice, thick with emotion, drew him over to a small sitting room. Harry looked around the door and saw Remus sitting in a chair, his head in his hands, his shoulders shaking. Tonks was crouched before him, her hair dark brown with stress and worry, as she stroked his head in an attempt to sooth him.
"Here you are." Mr. Lovegood opened a door onto the workroom. Luna and Neville's laughter drifted out to her. "I'll go make up your bedroom. Have fun."
Shadow grinned down at the letter. He was beginning to become quite fond of the twins. He passed the letter over to his father and just sat there quietly thinking and watching the expressions of those around him.
Narcissa and Draco tiptoed around the house. When called on, they obediently helped Lucius put up protective wards and tighten the Manor's defenses. Anything to keep away one of his rages. They just had to get through the summer. Once Draco was back at school, Narcissa would leave to visit family. They just had to survive two months. Of course, Draco had learned long ago that nothing that had to do with his father was easy. Four days ago everything had changed…
"Just out of curiosity," Shadow asked carefully, his sweaty hands clamped on his thighs as he braced himself for the rejection and confirmation of his illness that he
Noting this, Severus continued down the street. Most people didn't glance at them. Those that did, noted them and continued on. Only two people lingered to watch them pass. One of these was Cassandra Pucey, a soon to be 6th year Slytherin.
Seraphim didn't answer, he just smiled contentedly, feeling warm and happy knowing he was taking good care of Draco.
Narcissa stood rigidly, her eyes wide as she tried to contain her joyful triumph. Draco had survived. Her baby boy would live.
He rubbed at his chest absently before entering the room where they were having the meeting. Charlie stood at the head of the table. Sixteen chairs sat around it, only half occupied. The men and women took one look at him and gaped.
"No problem, my dear boy.” Flitwick grinned. "Hopefully we'll knock some sense into the rest of the school."
"That's better," Umbridge practically cooed. "I want you to sit still for what I have in mind. Wouldn't want you to leave before the show was over."
He feels the weakness of his body. His skin pulls taunt against still healing scars as he regulates his breathing. Fingers and limbs tremble with exhaustion, but the magic… Oh, the magic is still there, burning to be used, to
"Actually," Fred sneered hatefully, an expression no one had seen on him before. "I think my brother and I have decided that this class is unproductive, overall. We're dropping Defense."
Everything went black and Blaise froze, his knuckles white around his wand. He was completely blind. Terrified, he waited to be finished off, his lungs constricted, his pulse pounding against his throat. What he didn't expected was a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"Then what is it like?" Draco interrupted icily. "It sounds like you want Shadow to feel guilty about stopping Death Eaters."
Furiously, Augusta marched over to her grandson and stared him down. "I am the Head of this family, Neville Longbottom. You will tell me all you know!"
Cursing, Draco hesitated, but then he was sprinting after his friend… his crush. It had happened slowly. So slowly Draco never saw it coming until one morning he just knew he was deeply in love and felt like he had always felt that way. Even as Harry Potter, the brunet had been the only one to really engage him; the only one who could invoke such strong feelings in him.
"I don't know how you can," Blaise admitted. He moved toward the window and took a deep breath. Turning back, his expression was very familiar. Draco felt his shoulders relax as he took in Blaise's mischievous grin. "I don't know how you can," he repeated, "but I believe you. And it's not like we're helpless or anything."
"And I saw it in a memory Lucius showed me," Draco added. There was such a cold dread to his whispered voice that Ginny shivered, her hand spasming around Neville's, her nails cutting into his skin. "I still have nightmares."
Shadow met with the twins that weekend to plan the next prank. It was going to be great! He even invited Luna to help. He hadn't forgotten that she had helped him last Saturday. To thank her, he fetched a pebble from the lake and wrapped it up in shiny paper. She took the gift gratefully and treated it as if it were a diamond, making the twins laugh hysterically, but for Luna, the simple gift was as precious as a jewel because it was the first one she had received from anyone except her father in a long time.
"Thank you, Headmistress, for your kind words.” She smiled at the students, her back to McGonagall whom she supposedly addressed. "It is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say! And to see such happy little faces looking back at me! I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and I'm sure we'll be very good friends!"
"We went farther than ever before…" Harry bit his lip hard, his hands fisting on his thighs. "I hate that I feel like this afterward. This fear. It's not normal. I should be able to be with him without having mental convulsions afterward."
"Why do you think?" Neville snapped, clearly agitated. He stomped over to the other side of the room and stared at the painting that hung there. "Shadow would never be that way. Not after…
"Why haven't you told him to trust me?" she countered, taking a predatory step forward. "Why would you agree to be the middle man in such an arrangement?"
Severus didn't look back at the wall. He needed to see Harry's expression as he detailed the condition Boy was in and the following actions of Demon. Harry stared at him, eyes wide. His mouth parted with surprise when he heard how Demon actually spoke. He was less surprised that he had killed the Dark Lord. When it was over, he closed his eyes and Severus could only see pain on his face.
The sitting room looked much bigger when all the furniture was removed from it. The fireplace was blazing and cast the only light in the room. The curtains were drawn tightly across the windows, but even if they weren't the quarter moon was covered by thick clouds. In the center of the room, a circle almost seven feet wide had been drawn with soil that had been sprinkled with rainwater. The door to the room was barred with powerful magic.
A few minutes passed before he noticed the faint tremors running through the smaller male. He sniffed and realized the temperature in the room was rather chill. His feathers ruffled in annoyance. He didn't want to move so soon, but taking care of his mate took precedent over his desires.
Neville smiled back and reached into his bag. He pulled out a book and some scrolls. "Umbridge is stalking the twins, looking for any excuse to get rid of them, so they haven't been able to go to DA, either. We meet in different classrooms to plan pranks and think of things that could help the Order members. We have a couple ideas we're working on right now."
Remus was too tired to make conversation or even ask the source of the ex-convict's dark mood. Hopefully, things would get better soon. For all of them.
Draco was desperately glad that he didn't have to give any more detail than that. He quickly moved on. "After the transformation, you were out of it, so I went to get us some clothes. That's when I saw the Emergency Bulletin. They're posted on every main street corner throughout Britain, but only those with magical abilities can read them. I knocked out two Muggles and stole their clothes before returning here. Marissa is in the kitchen eating breakfast."
A white hand snapped out and grabbed Lucius by the throat. Lucius froze as he was cut off from oxygen and his brain denied blood. Within seconds black began crowding in his vision, but still he didn't try and remove his Lord's grip. The last thing he saw before he passed out was Voldemort's malevolent red eyes.
Draco convulsed as a wretched yell of pain was pulled from his tight throat. Distantly he could hear Shadow demanding Severus do something, but he knew the Potions Master could do nothing. There was nothing anyone could do. Suddenly, he gasped as the pain was smothered and pushed out of him. He opened his eyes and saw red. Blinking cleared them somewhat and he saw Shadow leaning rigidly over him, pinning his shoulders down with his hands. His head hung inches from Draco's forehead. Warm, it was so warm.
Looking in the mirror, he decided he looked presentable. After one last run through with the comb, he went in search of his friend. It didn't take him long to look throughout the house and discover that Shadow was missing.
Ginny's eyes popped open and an awful scream tore from her throat as she thrashed in the grip of the Death Eater holding her.
"Whenever I used to complain about chores or doing stuff I didn't want to do, Mum would tell me growing up's painful." Ron laughed softly. "She wasn't kidding."
Shadow shrugged. They hadn't been caught so it was a moot point. Marissa went running past the basilisk. She was calling excitedly for Sirius. She wanted to tell him all about the lion's den. It had been
Severus stood, staring at all of them. His hands were clasped behind his back, lank hair framing his formidable features, dark eyes holding deadly intent. "Outside this school," he began, voice dark and soft, compelling and dangerous, "things are rapidly occurring in certain political circles. We are all Slytherins here. It would be foolish to ignore the situation. Some of you, I am well aware, are being compelled by family or personal beliefs, perhaps both, to follow the Dark Lord. I know the position you are in. I once faced the same.
"Two weeks more until the moon is full," Luna said dreamily, her eyes on the sky. "You know… In some places, the moon always shines bright. It is a dark place that cannot afford to lose even a little light, so the moon remains always full."
Shadow had gone rigid. Severus could clearly see the aggravation and disappointment in the way he held his shoulders and the stiffness of his face. "I have no evil intent, sir. I just want to get my wand… Please," he added as an after thought.
The naked body lay twisted at the waist, arms spasming to the right, his legs broken almost in half in three different places; still… so still… so covered in blood and bone chips…
The ground heaved violently under their feet; rock and earth rose around them in a small four foot wall that they could crouch behind safely. Shadow peered over the edge and laughed a bit as he watched his father round up the surprised, wounded, and tired Death Eaters by the veil. Two Apparated away to who knew where, but the four remaining Death Eaters were viciously bound, gagged, and rendered unconscious. Severus snapped all of their wands carelessly under his boot.
He was too tense to go back to Gryffindor Tower, so he decided to wander the halls aimlessly to hopefully burn off his anxiety. His fingers twitched for his razor, but in a different way than before. Instead of intense emotional pain and despair, he felt frustrated and angry. It didn't help that winter was still gripping the earth, muting his magical senses and making him feel tired and edgy.
"Because…" Shadow looked back at his father. The debate of whether to talk about it or shut down was warring clearly in his troubled eyes. "I don't think anyone will know how to deal with how hard a relationship would be for me. How could they?"
Draco frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?" He crossed his arms over his chest. His annoyance skyrocketed at the silent treatment he was getting. Shadow wasn't explaining himself at all. Not where he went yesterday, not why he'd been in such a funky mood. Nothing. It was really starting to piss him off.
Ginny was smart and powerful. She commanded respect and was mischievously clever like the twins. He really did love her; for her goodness and strength among a hundred other reasons, and that was why he didn't want to explain. He didn't want to taint her view of him. He needed her to look at him like they were equals, and he wouldn't be when she knew how damaged he was.
Snarling, the alter got to his feet, still panting and sweating from pain and the physical stress the change had caused. He glared at the blond wizard before him. Black magic lashed out, flinging the wand the teen held far away. Then he leapt, knocking Draco down. He reached, planning to strangle the
"It's completely non-magical." Shadow grinned at her. "We went to a Muggle spa and salon. You should see Severus!"
"How long have you known you were an Earth Elemental?" Charlie asked more gently. "That must have been an incredibly difficult time for you."
"I've been looking everywhere for you. When you missed dinner after your hearing, McGonagall knew something was wrong. She deployed everyone to find you two. Of course Lupin came back to the house to tell me. He knew it had to have been the Death Eaters, and who better to infiltrate?"
Hermione walked into the guest bedroom at home. Ron was awake and sitting in the window. He still had white bandages wrapped around his arms, but he was functional and aware again. He tired easily, but that was okay. Hermione didn't mind the break. So much had happened, so much was still happening. It was scary.
he had released Severus's brat, but McNair assured him he hadn't. The brat had been in the room the whole time. At least until the wretched boy had escaped. And Draco had helped him!
Taking that as permission, Draco continued in a soft voice. Seraphim had fallen asleep in the chair, his cheek resting on his knees, and he didn't want to wake him. "May I ask about the jacket?"
"Draco is not his father. And besides, I'm sure the Order is taking precautions if that is the case. I don't see how it concerns us. What could spying on us accomplish?" Shadow shrugged, but his eyes had gone hard.
After breakfast, Shadow met Draco in the sitting room. The blond stood with a casual expression and a lifted eyebrow, but Shadow had his empathy wide open and he could feel his friend's dissatisfaction, disappointment, and annoyance. Shadow felt a bit annoyed as well. He wanted the blond to go with him. He didn't want to just leave him behind, but there wasn't anything he could do about it.
Shadow trusted him with his secrets. He had trusted Draco with his safety, first with Dumbledore and then with Lockhart. He had invited Draco into his home, a home that Shadow protected and cherished passionately. Most remarkably, Shadow let Draco into his zealously guarded and severely scarred heart. That kind of courage and selflessness deserved and answer in kind.
They entered the kitchen to find Marissa almost done with her bowl of soup and chatting happily at Severus about her games with Sirius. Neville blinked dully as he slowly spooned liquid into his mouth, and Severus watched him out of the corner of his eye while pretending to listen to the hyper four-year-old.
"Our opinions about students are not enough to expel them. There must be a recordable offense," McGonagall responded, voice tight, her back rigidly straight.
that feeling, so he pushed it all to the back of his mind, determined not to think about it. After all, nothing had changed. He and Draco were just friends. It was just better,
Hillary Redwing was forced to marry a Leonardo MacKillen in 1924. He was supposed to supervise her and make sure she didn't break the law again - she had stolen some jewels from a jewelry store. He was a fine upstanding gentlemen of power. She had only been seventeen. He was forty-eight. Two years later, Hillary killed her husband and was sentenced to a slow hanging. The medical examiner recorded the condition of her body afterwards for records. There was severe scarring on her back, evidence of at least four miscarriages, several broken bones that had not healed correctly, and severe bruising. She had been terribly abused, but it had been legal because he had owned her.
"Me?" Neville gasped, wide-eyed. All he could think about were his failures during the first seizure.
Shadow relaxed his shoulders. He hadn't known what Severus was going to name him and was very glad to be keeping a name he felt comfortable with. But still… "Don't you think its risky for my middle names to be so connected to Harry’s life?"
"You can't go by yourself. That's just stupid. No one will know you're even there. What if something happens? You won't have any way to get help."
"Carrow," he answered simply. "The spell wasn't supposed to cause so much damage, but with my condition my bones break so easily. She was so surprised when I screamed. I don't think she'll pick on me for a while."
Cloaked pedestrians walked purposefully down the street, some stopping to examine the products on display. A few boarded up buildings throbbed with music; others had colorful smoke seeping out cracks in the wood. Severus had explained that those were drug houses. It was amazing that the Wizarding world reflected the Muggle one so closely, but on the other hand, Shadow wasn't really that surprised. People were people. Magic wouldn't prevent the indulgence of human vices.
He looked completely different, but at the same time… He could recognize himself. His nose was the same, long and straight – not too big, not too small. So was his mouth, lips even and full – not thin and long like Severus’s - but his chin was pointier and his eyebrows were now thinner and gently arched. His hair was still black, but now it fell in curls. He remembered seeing a picture of his mother's mother at the Dursley's. She’d had curly hair just like this, but it had been red like his mother's. He was glad his hair was still black. His new curls spilled over his forehead and over his ears, he looked younger now; maybe thirteen. Then again, considering his slightly deeper voice and the fact he was a little taller, maybe he could be a believable fifteen.
Draco was talking to Blaise while Pansy shot them strange looks, so he sat by himself and read from a DADA text that wasn't in Umbridge's curriculum. That woman wouldn't know good defense if it hit her in the face. After the meal, he hurried back to the empty classroom. He had another free period and was taking his DADA OWL.
Augusta waved her hand toward the stairs in permission and turned back to the sitting room where she had been doing some reading. Remus moved up the stairs, trying to gather his thoughts. Bracing himself, he knocked on the door. Not hearing an answer, he pushed it open.
Hermione stood and hurried after the distraught teen. She gasped as soon as she saw her best friend. She fell to her knees and began casting the only healing charm she knew. It was very weak, but it caused his gasping breaths to deepen and his eyes to stop rolling quite so violently.
Harry took it, feeling the warm rush of magic that belonged only to him. He smiled and bowed his head. "Thank you."
Not everyone was thrilled to have Severus join the Order's ranks, but they were all loyal to Minerva and they tolerated his presence at her insistence. He let his eyes drift around the table. There was Mad-Eye Moody, Emmeline Vance, Dedalus Diggle, Elphias Doge, Arthur and Molly Weasley, Bill and Charlie Weasley, Kingsley Shacklebolt and his Auror Apprentice, Nymphadora Tonks, and finally there was Minerva and himself. The only Order members absent that he could name was the Lupin and Hagrid. That made fourteen, which meant there were at least six more agents in the Order, according to the twins' count, that he did not know. That would have to change.
Remus felt a cold murderous intent grip him. "What do you think?" he asked softly, keeping his eyes averted, knowing she'd see the monster within him if he let her see his face now.
"Seraphim! Wait!" Severus called, frantic. He watched his son disappear into the woods and panic overwhelmed him. He stumbled forward, the leg that was injured by Dumbledore almost giving out under his weight.
Determined to help his brother, he had gone outside as soon as Shadow left and went into a trance. It wasn't like searching for Demon. That monster had a distinct aura that repelled his Earth sense. Trying to find Professor Snape and Draco wouldn't be that easy at all.
Shadow's eyes snapped open and to the side, seeing her. He instantly paled and shoved Draco hard in the chest. Panting, Draco took a few steps back. His grey eyes flashed over to her furiously. She swallowed and felt her heart rate quicken in fear.
"I had to look twice to recognize you," Hermione admitted. "You did a good job. I don't sense magic, though."
"Yes, but not at that cost," Neville argued. He suddenly remembered the caves and the Death Eater his brother had torn into to get information. A lot of horrible things had happened, but he was worried his brother wouldn't come back from the edge if he jumped off too many times.
"Stop it!" Shadow yelled, pulling against his father desperately. "Why doesn't he just spell it into him?"
Charlie nodded and began to look feverishly through his notes. "I'll call together all the team leaders. We'll be ready."
Severus immediately looked for Bogrod. The goblin and his Clankers were the only way out of this death trap. To his horror, he realized the goblin was nowhere in sight, buried for who knew how long under the burning swell of gold. "LIBERACORPUS!" he bellowed, wand snapping like a whip.
There were chess games and duels at home, at the DA, in the Chamber of Secrets. There were clumsy piano lessons and glorious broom races and flying. There was laughter over homework and camaraderie while planning the DA. And there'd been that kiss in the Department of Mysteries and that episode in the dueling room just yesterday, the heat and taste of Draco now seared in his mind forever.
Severus watched his godson interact with Shadow for several minutes before stepping outside. His mind had been calmed and revitalized by the tender scene. He was ready to get back to work. Shadow
"I guess. I've just been so busy with everything and I didn't really want to add another thing to deal with. You see, when we got back to school, a Pensieve was waiting for me. Dumbledore left it, explaining that he thinks the Dark Lord created six Horcruxes. Basically that means he…"
Lucius sat in a small rocking rowboat. He hated the damn thing. Every wave threatened to be the one to tip him into the frigid sea. A soft whirl and he was no longer alone. His son sat across from him, straight and tall. His short blond hair was slicked back and his eyes were sneering as soon as he took in what exactly they were sitting in.
"They're already awake. We went to bed when you did and woke up about two this morning, unable to go back to sleep." He disappeared out the door before Shadow could respond.
"He… It was sexual, okay?" Draco bit his lip, eyes wide with apprehension. "I think he thinks I'm his mate or something."
Severus sneered and spun. He limped down the hallway, his old injury acting up. He didn't look back once, so he never saw the deeply pained expression on his adopted son's face.
Coming back to school wasn't everything Neville had hoped it would be. He'd wanted things to go back to normal, as if his kidnapping hadn't happened. Now he saw how naïve that hope really was. He'd been back at Hogwarts since Thursday. It was only Sunday afternoon and already he knew nothing would be the same
Lockhart had the first bed by the ward door while the Longbottoms were in the furthest bed in the long room by a small window which let in winter sunlight. Neville passed the ill celebrity, his eyes darting sideways to make sure the man wasn't going to come after them. Draco stared unabashedly, his eyes predatory as he recognized that he would kill this man within nine months. Shadow looked straight ahead. He didn't want to see him if he didn't have to.
"I am aware." Severus leaned back as well, giving Shadow space. "I was planning on discussing it with you before hand, but circumstances forced me to move quickly. I had to take the opening the Headmistress gave me before it disappeared. Had I waited, the story would have lost credibility and her agreement was vital for the plan to work. She must testify that at Albus's death she received notice that you were under the school's protection and received all your files."
that Shadow found it so hard to accept comfort. That he had been hurt so badly that he didn't know what to do with love. Draco used the hand still entwined in Shadow's hair to pull him forward and crush their mouths together almost violently.
"She can stay here with Sirius. He's still playing Remus, but you can sneak her up to Remus's quarters under the invisibility cloak while I take the potion."
"Thank you," Shadow answered respectfully. He carefully took the book and placed it next to him. Felling the weight of everyone's stares, he turned to Draco. "I believe you're next."
Sirius's eyes widened. He knew where this was going. He went rigid next to his friend and had he not been so full of grief and shock he would have howled and screamed his denial. Remus's hand gripped his forearm tightly - whether to support him or to keep him silent, Sirius didn't know. Either way, he couldn't move. He could hardly breathe.
"What about me?" Sirius asked faintly. He was still staring at his godson. Twelve years in prison had given him a healthy dose of claustrophobia and the binding jacket horrified him.
Draco knew McGonagall had been informed that the creature had been Shadow Snape/Harry Potter, but Severus convinced her it was a temporary spell cast by the Dark Lord. How was he going to explain this? Almost desperately, he wished Severus had not abandoned them, even though he knew the man was only doing what he must to protect his son. Gathering his will and resolve, Draco knew he'd have to handle this himself. He wasn't a child to always need his mentor there to guide him.
Severus eyed the parchment in between stirring the large, twenty gallon cauldron bubbling away in front of him. Shadow had yet to respond to his inquiry on his status. He had to assume his son was busy. Surly he would have heard if Shadow had run into trouble. If not from Draco, then from the mangy wolf and the mutt. He scowled down at the progressing potion when the worry refused to be diminished by logic.
The gorgeous owl cut silently through the canopy and came gliding down toward him. Draco beamed, his heart rocketing in his chest with hope and excitement. The owl hooted sternly, nipping him on the ear as she settled on his shoulder. She almost couldn't fit, she was so large now.
"You Apparated?" Neville gasped while Draco stared in silent shock. "That's powerful magic, Harry! And so young, too!" Then he realized what name he called his brother and paled. A mistake like that in public would destroy everything they were working so hard to do, but Shadow didn't seem to notice the slip.
Shadow sat heavily, returning to his place on the couch. He knew how deep the animosity between his godfather and Severus was. For his father to even hint that Sirius had been useful, or even necessary, showed just how badly things had gone.
Shock rippled over Molly's face as she realized she was missing a child under her care. She spun around to count for herself.
Draco shook his head with a doubtful smirk. Before Shadow could retaliate, the blond pulled him into the corridor again. The two teens made their way through the dimly lit passages. More aware, Shadow was amazed at the complexity of the caverns. It took a good fifteen minutes before they reached a cave opening.
Shadow barely kept from rolling his eyes as he followed the redhead into the Gryffindor common room. The sight made his steps falter as memories blindsided him. For a long time, Gryffindor House was the closest thing he had to a home. He looked around at the plush and worn couches, the warm red and yellow colors, and smiled.
If Lucius guessed - if he even suspected - that Shadow was really Harry Potter. His son was dead. There would be no delays, no dramatic speeches, no games. Lucius would kill him. Because he had never been as afraid of anything as he was of Demon. Boy's distinct mannerisms were unforgettable. Lucius would know who Shadow was within seconds.
"I believe that your hate and anger built on the faint personality imprint already placed on the energy of the Killing Curse," Salazar continued, uncaring about the distress his information was creating. "In essence, I now believe that Demon was always a foreign spirit possessing you, but by linking to Boy - his opposite - Demon became attached to you."
Draco hadn't expected to be drawn so quickly into the conversation and hesitated for a moment. He winced when Shadow's eyes narrowed suspiciously as he said, "I haven't mastered the form yet."
It seemed amazing that old Voldie, the powerful megalomaniac out to destroy the world was third on his list, but it was true. He had to get moving on that. He was sick of this needle in a haystack routine. He needed better intel or the Light was screwed and the Dark Ages were going to come. An image of Firenze came to mind. He'd ask there first. The centaur did say he was trying to prevent the Dark from winning.
The potion threatened to boil over and billowing acid green smoke rose like volcanic ash, filling the air. Severus was wearing protective gloves and facial mask and he could
Seraphim clenched his fists, his heart pounding hard against his ribs as he ran forward. The strange man that stood in his way lifted one of those deadly little sticks, his face twisted with a wide smile that brought back flashes of the graveyard, being circled and tortured. The man’s laughter echoed just the same as the laughter then, and with a scream of rage, he flung his right fist forward, releasing a blast of Black.
Despair slid through Harry’s veins until it pushed everything else out. They sat there, numb to the world, lost in their pain, until a hand descended on Harry’s shoulder. Bleakly, his dull green eyes lifted to find Draco standing above him, a frown on his face. He said something, but Harry didn't care. Nothing mattered anymore. Pliant, apathetic, he let Draco maneuver him to his feet and out of the room. Lips descended on his and his eyes widened as Neville's emotions cracked and shattered under Draco's hot passion.
"Remus, Sirius.” Harry smiled and gestured to Draco. "This is my friend, Draco Malfoy. Draco, you've met Remus Lupin. He's currently acting as my doctor. This is Sirius Black. My godfather. They stay here with Severus and me."
Under the ominous headline, a gruesome picture of a white, blood-spattered wall filled half the page. A corpse sat slumped against the wall in the right corner and, if you looked closely, you could see its dead lips moving. Feeling cold, Shadow quickly read the article. It seemed that Igor Karkaroff walked into the Minister's office claiming he wanted to turn on the Dark Lord only to explode all over the Minister. A dormant spell then activated, animating his corpse to pass along the Dark Lord's message:
"You don't understand because you've never faced your darkness. You push it away and expect him to do the same. He needs to face it to truly heal."
"She was," Severus agreed with a deep bow of his head. He still missed her so much. It hurt to talk about her, but he knew she would approve the little lies he was seeding here. She would have adored Shadow and done anything for him. "I proposed to her two months after I was released from Azkaban. It was the best thing I could have done for myself, but I wish… I wish it hadn’t cost her so much."
Shadow shook his head. Sweat slid down the side of his face and he felt about ready to bolt. Severus must have recognized the signs because he said nothing for a long minute while Shadow sat quietly, gulping in discreet mouthfuls of air and trying to ease the tension constricting his lungs. Severus called Omi and asked for tea for two. The elf reappeared a moment later with the asked for drinks. They prepared their cups with careful deliberation and sipped at the scalding liquid.
McGonagall's graying hair hung freely down her back. She was wrapped in a sleeping robe, but she was awake and her face was lined with worry. Professor Snape stood in the shadows by her desk. He was dressed and he had his arms crossed over his chest in a very foreboding manner. His dark eyes seemed like holes in his head. The teens froze in the doorway, knowing bad news was coming.
Severus moved reluctantly into the room, but he would not sit. "I am troubled to hear of your difficulty with the Order. I was not aware my son's circumstances had so negatively affected you."
"It is a combination of an advanced Runeology and time magic," Severus revealed. "I have my notes and sources in my office."
His soon-mate called after him in that strange way he had and Seraphim obligingly looked over his shoulder to see what the smaller male wanted.
"I'm certain Draco would not want you to push yourself. He would understand if you wanted to slow down the physical aspect of your relationship," Severus ventured cautiously.
"I have something for you. It is the last thing left by Headmaster Dumbledore. I was to give it to you when I sensed the destruction of a Horcrux within these walls." The serious teen reached out expectantly.
Demon strode past his Boy and approached Lockhart once more. He hadn't expected Boy to come and watch. Hot sizzling pleasure filled him, making him laugh. He would finally get to show Boy, show him he would destroy the world that had hurt him. It would all be gone and then they could sleep in peace. Boy would be able to rest without screaming,
Severus was still cloistered away working on his mysterious potions project. Sirius and Marissa entertained themselves and worked on the snitch. Shadow and Draco were assigned the task of trying to find out where the other Horcruxes were.
Draco swallowed almost desperately. Anything to stop the pain. The potion's bitter taste filled his mouth, but the copper taste of blood wasn't so easily washed away. He opened his eyes, unaware he had shut them again, and stared at Lupin. "What happened?" He blinked when he heard his own voice, hoarse and weak.
to let himself sink back into sweet dreams of delicious death and destruction. He couldn't sleep, couldn't
Draco watched enraptured as the piano grew louder, more demanding. Shadow tipped his head back, his eyes closed as he was swept up in emotion. Draco leaned his forehead against the doorjamb, his chest tight with emotion, wanting more than anything to go to Shadow and tell him he didn't have to be alone, but he couldn't move.
Draco turned around and faced his friend. "This is going to be a lot harder than we though it would be."
"I was a prat. I know it. I shouldn't blame you for not telling us, but it's hard. We were scared, man. Really scared for you," Ron said thickly, letting go. "It hurts that Gin made you tell us. We'd still not know if it were up to you. But I'm glad you're okay. That makes up for a lot of it, I think."
Narcissa took the vial from the bedside table and brought it to her husband's lips. She wished it was poison, but the Dark Lord would be aware if any of his slaves died of unnatural causes, thus it was just a pain-relieving potion. Lucius drank it clumsily, spilling some down his chin. Disgusted, Narcissa pulled her wand from her robe and cleaned him. Lucius was too far gone to really notice.
"We know for sure there are at least twenty-seven Death Eaters missing, but we cannot be certain they haven't been recruiting all this time," Minerva said solemnly as she looked around the room. "We will most likely be outnumbered, but we have the element of surprise. I want you to capture as many Death Eaters as you can. If you can't capture them, kill them. The first priority is to rescue Severus Snape and any other prisoners we may come across. Our second priority is to look for any information pertaining to Harry Potter. Retreat if things get too hot. I don't want any casualties. Understood?"
"Clever child.” Severus nodded. "That is exactly what I'm trying to tell you. If I thought this would affect your mental barriers or bring out Demon or Boy, I would not have suggested it in the first place."
Shadow laughed weakly, still feeling shaky but bolstered by his father's conviction. "You sound like a Gryffindor."
The woman nodded to herself, her eyes lingering on Shadow, and said, "They're holding your hearing in Courtroom Ten."
Shadow had been gone for only three days and Draco already felt like he was going to go mad with boredom. He could only spend so many hours over books and in studies.
"Merlin," Neville gasped, shaking. Bile rose up the back of his throat and he wanted to deny everything his brother had just done and said. It couldn't be true. Lockhart flashed through his mind. The old disgust and utter humiliation, the fear and self-hate, came roaring back and he could almost feel the man's hands on him and
Trembling in fear at his teacher's very real anger, the blond allowed himself to be thrown from the room. Severus slammed the door shut in his face with a final hateful snarl. Shaken and confused, Draco sank to the cold stone floor of the corridor. It took several minutes before he could pull himself to his feet. He ran as fast as he could, pushing his body as hard as it could go. He sprinted, gasping for breath, through the Slytherin common room and up to his dorm. Draco slammed the door shut and applied every locking spell he knew before allowing the breakdown to come.
Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Draco with his great, bloodshot eyes. "Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back."
"Whoa." Draco stared down at his friend. "Blaise, it's really me. I wanted to make sure you guys were okay here. Guess I can take this as a no."
Neville opened his door with a relieved smile, but one look at Severus's face and he felt his stomach drop queasily. The Potions Master breezed past the terrified Gryffindor without a word of greeting or question. He came to an abrupt halt, however, within the threshold to the living room. Seraphim met his gaze from across the room and grinned madly when he saw the intimidating man's shock and apprehension. The jacket had worked again, further cementing his acceptance of the garment.
"Stay with me, Nev. You're safe. You're not back there," Remus promised, pressing their foreheads together.
"No. You have to tell him. You're in danger. If the Dark Lord figures out who Demon is, how he relates to you, then you're finished. Worse, he wants to possess Demon instead of just wanting to kill him! … No. You have to tell him. This is serious."
Charlie walked through Grimmauld Place, his hands behind his back and his face set in haggard lines. It was Christmas and all the sitting rooms were filled with groaning, injured people. Ron was upstairs, also gravely injured, but luckily Fred and Hermione were easily set to rights, although it would be a few days before they recovered fully.
Seraphim sniffed and moved toward the corridor, obviously intending to go to Marissa, when food appeared on the dinning room table. Seraphim spun around, eyes wide and wings spread with surprise as he took in the feast. He growled and stalked forward, obviously wary, but Draco made soothing sounds and even offered to have some. Seraphim took exception to that and his wing knocked the apple he'd plucked from the table out of his hand. Draco didn't let it bother him. He knew Seraphim was just trying to protect him.
The teen smiled happily at the compliment, reminding Draco of Boy, but his expression slowly turned haunted, the smile falling away as if it never was. "My skin breaks," the alter whispered, talking mostly to himself. "Whips and belts and knives and hands and spells. It hurts so much.” He moaned, rocking backward and forward. "I try to be good. I even bring the belt when Uncle says. He makes me sharpen the knife and heat the stove, presses my skin onto the hot coils. I want to be good, so I do it, and then it
Shadow narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth to protest, but Neville raised a hand and stopped him.
Shadow looked away, tears burning his eyes. "How can you still say that? After all you saw. After what you saw me do."
Ron could only stand with mouth agape at what Hagrid had done. Hermione grabbed onto her friend, almost fainting dead away.
Shadow stared at the little girl, his happiness dimming. What were they going to do with her? If he had any say in the matter, things with the Dark Lord and the Horcruxes were going to be picking up. He didn't want Marissa anywhere near them when the war started getting heated.
Draco bit his lip. He hated this, hated hearing what had been done to the one he loved. Worse, he knew Boy had been tortured for years without any help or relief. Six bloody years Vernon Dursley had his hands on Boy. The damnable Muggle knew the child would heal, so he became more and more violent. It gave him room to hurt he child without fear of discovery.
Voldemort was dead, yes, but the majority of his followers weren’t, and they were a problem. Word had to have spread in those circles of Voldemort's demise. Some would want to take his place, some would be after Harry for revenge or just because he was a potential threat to them. Especially since they tortured him. They would fear retribution.
The next day just so happened to be a very special day. It marked the three month anniversary of when the Weasley brothers had begun the arduous Animagus Revealing Potion back at Grimmauld Place. They had managed to squeeze in time to work on it in-between their studies and the DA, and it was now ready.
"You keep emphasizing the physical part. Am I to take it you are reassuring me that my personality, mind, and soul will not be altered or touched in any way?" Harry smiled.
"The Dursleys?" Neville gasped. He began to understand what must have happened. Demon came for revenge. Still, he shuddered. What had happened in that house… It was so far beyond revenge that Neville didn't have a word for it… He shook his head hard. What did it matter? They had to get out of here. "Do you know how to get back to the house?" Harry said nothing and Neville shook his shoulders. "Harry!" Still nothing. "Shadow!"
He whispered along the roots and trees, pushing into his mind the remembrance of the residue Demon had left behind at Hogwarts at the end of their third year. To this day, there was a round circle about seven feet in diameter near the lake where nothing grew. He looked for the same poisonous energies, a mate to the same dissonance Demon left at Hogwarts.
Draco frowned. "I think it's all superstitious crap to be honest. I mean, there are a lot of Seers who don't have eyes like that. And there are a lot of people with bad luck who have normal eyes, too. I think it's a coincidence. After all, you didn't always have eyes like that."
"You do?" Shadow asked, hope lighting his eyes. "Ginny, anything you can tell me would really, really help. Sirius has been looking, but there are so many things they could be and we're running out of time."
Shadow was the window that allowed him to see these things. He distrusted the Light fanatics like Dumbledore and McGonagall. They would never have been able to show him the truth. Only Shadow, standing not for the Light or Dark, but for his own perceptions and beliefs could have shown and taught Draco to do the same. Thinking for oneself was not always an easy concept, especially for a Pureblood Heir like Draco.
The Gryffindor frowned, but then he sat bolt upright. The sudden move to vertical had him vomiting over the side of the couch. Remus seemed to have predicted the move because he already had a bucket. He gently stroked Neville's shoulders and back until the spasms stopped and Neville lay back again with a groan.
"What?" Harry pushed when Severus just looked at him intensely, his dark eyes watching him carefully.
Instinctively, he flailed, looking for a way to make it stop, to escape. Strangely, it was the Dark Lord who saved him.
Charlie climbed over to where Harry, naked, was trying to physically lift the rubble away. They had to be careful. Shifting the debris could injure Draco further, but he needed to get closer before he could use his wand. He was unprepared however when Harry turned, his eyes narrowed dangerously, a look of hate twisting his face.
"He must have thought you needed to know something quick," Draco murmured and reached to help massage Sirius's temples. The Animagus sighed in pleasure and his shoulders relaxed.
Shadow watched as Draco grabbed his hands and stared into his face. He couldn't help laughing at his best friend's awed look. The fall had been awesome! He almost wanted to try it himself, but then Draco was launching himself out of the snow and tackling him. They were rolling and the snow was everywhere… in their eyes, clothes, mouths, hair. Shadow was pushing and elbowing, gasping and shrieking with laughter as the blond tickled and wrestled with him.
"I have something else I need to tell you.” Shadow shook his head and changed the subject. "Dumbledore left me something last night."
Remus instantly moved forward and began casting diagnostic spells. Severus let him as he lifted Shadow into his arms and walked him around the bed. Gently, he laid Shadow down next to Draco and tucked him in.
Severus watched all this from across the street, spelled to be unnoticeable. The dour Potions Master considered he may owe his son an apology. He had persistently tried to convince Shadow that the jacket wasn't necessary, afraid it would make Shadow doubt his self-worth and sanity, but the bracelet he wore that was connected to the jacket had worked perfectly, allowing him to keep track of Seraphim. Confident that his son would stay put, Severus walked far enough away not to be overheard by Muggles and Apparated to London.
"Ah, yes.” Flitwick smiled again. "I suppose we can discuss this for today, but expect to begin your lessons next class. So, heterochromia… It is when the eyes have different levels of a chemical called melanin…"
Draco turned to face his friend and walked across to him without hesitation. "It's nothing. Severus was just chewing me out because I didn't contact him sooner. I overrated. It's my fault."
"That does make it difficult to believe a word that comes out of your mouth," Lucius agreed and tapped his chin thoughtfully. "But someone killed that meddlesome, senile, old man. Perhaps your wand can tell us if it was you? Of course, it will take time to examine."
They spent an hour together, just talking about books and other interesting things. Viktor asked if she thought he was a good teacher. His review came back from Umbridge and it had not been positive. Hermione reassured him that everyone enjoyed his classes and were learning the lessons as well as they had with McGonagall. In the end, they both felt much better for the visit and wished it could happen more often.
Draco darted his eyes to the side and took in Fred's hard, pale features. He looked back to his father. "If you do anything hasty, I'll simply break it. I doubt your boss would appreciate that."
Draco felt his vision tunnel in - the rest of the world collapsing inward around him - as he watched Demon slowly, masterfully torture Lockhart. As if from a long distance, he watched blood spray through the air, saw it mist and steam slightly in the chill of the hospital ward. He saw it run in rivulets past Demon's crouched form and toward Draco's bare feet. The screams seemed like the wind, completely unfathomable, distant as Draco's mind dulled, trying to escape the scene before him.
! She didn't know who was responsible, so they were all going to pay for it. Heels clicking ominously on the stone floor, robes gently rippling, fake curls bouncing, Dolores Umbridge walked through the Great Hall doors and regally made her way to her seat. The students grew hushed as they watched her pass.
"Your eyes…" Severus whispered. His hand came up and gently turned his son's chin so he could see better. "They are like my mother's."
His cravings for his knife was lessening everyday. He still felt like slipping back into the old pattern of thinking and indulge in the old comfort, but every time he resisted, it got easier. Sometimes he fell and cut again, despaired again, but he finally trusted that his new family would be there to help him get up again. Remus and Harry would be there for him, no matter what. That alone made him feel just a tiny bit stronger. He had never known that kind of support before. He could never count on his grandmother or his family to be there for him. They would watch him fall and lecture him about his weaknesses, never reaching out to give him a hand up.
"Very well." Draco patted the corner of his mouth with his napkin and rose to go to the register near the front.
At first, the battle at Azkaban had gone well. They were turning back the Death Eaters and managed to re-secure all the prisoners, but then the Dark Lord had arrived and all hell had broken loose. Six Order members and nine Aurors died. This all happened ten minutes after Mrs. Longbottom arrived unexpectedly on the scene and informed Remus that she feared Neville was in trouble. Things were well in hand, so Charlie had agreed that he could go help the teen, sending Kingsley, Tonks, and Moody with him just in case.
He hadn't ever tried to access his Earth magic without his teacher there, but this was an emergency. He knew better than anyone the lengths one could go to in a fit of emotional distress. He had to find Shadow before anything like that happened.
"I don't want to have to go through this at all." Shadow shook his head. "Can you hand me that robe? I'm beginning to feel a little naked."
"I'm not lying, my dear.” Draco laughed. "If it weren't true, why would I be doing all this? Professor Snape is right. The Dark Lord has turned his followers into slaves in his madness, changing them from the proud advocates they once were. I refuse to be a slave. True Malfoys grovel to
"I do not care," Severus bit out, cutting him off. "You do not need to understand it. All you need to understand is that I will not allow you to tear my son apart." Neville whimpered as the wand dug into his jaw. "If you spoil this for Shadow, I will devote myself to ensuring you suffer equally. Do you understand
"He had a nightmare the night before last night, too." Neville bit his lip and wondered how much he could say. He settled for, "I'm just worried he's not getting enough sleep."
Getting through his Monday classes had been nearly impossible as he stared at the clock, waiting impatiently for the meeting that night with Sirius. Finally, Shadow was sitting on the couch next to Draco and Neville, staring at the door and wondering why it was taking Sirius so long to arrive. Severus sat across from them, and though he was still, Shadow could feel his agitation. The Potions Master hadn't been informed of the news yet, either, and he wasn't happy about it.
The Death Eaters shifted angrily at the blond's tone, but Lucius slashed out with his hand and they stilled again. "Fine, Dragon. Fine."
"Be fair," Remus scolded the others. "Neville wasn't expecting Harry to look different, let alone for him to have heterochromia. It is a bit… startling at first."
"I'm sorry," Emmeline said regretfully. "China won't cooperate. We've tried every angle. I even requested permission to send someone to look physically. Unless Harry tells us specifically where he is or comes back on his own, we can't reach him."
"This is Firenze," McGonagall introduced to everyone. "Centaurs are known for their Divination skills that no human has been able to match. He has graciously agreed to teach here." She turned her eyes to Umbridge. "I think you'll find him suitable."
Severus trailed behind the two teens, still examining the snitch. Now he was muttering at it, his wand circling and poking the metal surface.
"Because you can't stop someone from loving you. By shutting them out, you hurt them more than if you let them share your burden. You have the power of granting yourself and someone else great happiness by opening your heart to someone," Severus answered easily. He would never have had that wisdom to share with his son if it weren't for Amalia. With a pang, he wished she were here. She would know what to say to Shadow.
The white ocean underneath them was all they could see. Draco began to lose sense of direction, his stomach was light, lifting away, his blood was sizzling, and Shadow was laughing, laughing… Draco closed his eyes, following that sound in the darkness, always following… Blind, deaf, dumb; it didn't matter. He would always follow Shadow… into Hell… into infinity…
Draco pulled away, his hair mussed and his eyes red-rimmed. He looked old, and it pained Severus to see it. "I wish there was something more we could do for him."
Sirius waited for the door to shut before transforming. He grinned at his old friend. "How are you holding up, Moony?"
"Yeah," she promised. Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek. She loved the way he blushed. "I knew Percy was bad news a long time ago. Don't really know why, but I kind of erased him from my heart long before now. Percy always has pandered to authority and not in a good way. He has no internal sense of right and wrong, so he relies on others to tell him. I'm not surprised he's trailing along in Fudge's wake."
"Professor? Are you here?" He carefully pushed open the door to classroom eleven and stepped inside. He pulled off his Invisibility Cloak and called again. "Professor Firenze?"
In each corner and along the ceiling, woven among the pictures and blood-covered wall were huge, intricate spider webs. The small insects crawled - some rapidly, others with slow grace - along the sparkling strands. The spiders represented the thought processes and behavioral patterns of Boy. There were no layers - no subconscious or unconscious - just spiders moving along one geometrical plane indicating a mind that was purely made up of the conscious.
"These young people just brought to my attention a despicable thing." Carrow turned her eyes on the teenagers. "Tell her what you've discovered about the Headmistress's plot."
In the end, Draco, Blaise, and Pansy won. They made the bathroom mirror bleed with the image of a decaying hag flickering in the mirror's depths, reaching for them. The four second-year girls screamed and fled, leaving one who fainted dead-away. Triumphant, the three fifth-years got to preside over the rest of the Halloween festivities. This included ghost stories, the Halloween Feast, and the making of jack-o-lanterns.
Shadow took a deep breath and leaned his head back on the seat with his eyes closed. Black curls fell messily around his head and the flames of the fire gently illuminated his tired expression.
Heart pounding, Draco scuttled backward, hardly thinking clearly. He was at the door, about to fling it open, when he the realization that Demon wasn't moving sank in. He looked back and, sure enough, Demon lay still as death, staring up at the ceiling almost passively with his blazing eyes. His magic wasn't lashing out wildly and destroying the room. He wasn't screaming or roaring or, heaven forbid, laughing.
"I want to know how you became such close friends with Draco." Severus eyed the teen. Harry offered an innocent smile and he snorted. “But, first, I will continue my story."
"I'm going to get something for her. I'll be right back," Draco told him. He glanced at Shadow, checking to be sure he was okay, before pulling the Invisibility Cloak around him.
Draco stood up. His senses screaming as the wards practically shrieked in alarm. The Dark creatures turned tail and ran as fast as they could. They had to get out. They had to get away from the death ready to crash upon all their heads. The students cheered tiredly. Some breaking into tears of utter relief and joy.
"Rest. It should only be a few more hours," Severus murmured gently as his fingers carded through his son's dirty hair. He smiled when he felt Harry's weight grow heavier against his side and the teen's breathing even out in sleep.
"SHUT UP, DAMN YOU!" Draco bellowed, just as Severus jerked and took a deep breath, his bloodshot eyes popping open.
"Thank you for coming, Severus." Her voice was even, but it vibrated with tension. "Emmeline Vance was compromised and murdered. Charlie autopsied her corpse and discovered they interrogated her before they made the killing blow. They asked about the Order and other members, but of course she was prevented from speaking. Then they questioned her hard on Harry Potter's location. She revealed that we believe he is in training in China. We believe they were rather desperate for this information, that Harry is their true concern, more so than the Order. Be careful, Severus. Make sure Shadow doesn't risk himself unnecessarily. The Dark Lord is ready to make his move on the Chosen One."
Severus dropped his hand and forced calm and patience over his emotions. He had to let the alter decide on his own to trust him. A few minutes went by with Seraphim leaning on the filthy wall, shivering in his too-large coat. His head lowered to his chin with exhaustion and Severus could just make out the weak sound of the teen's teeth chattering. Severus forced himself to hold still.
"There must be billions," Hermione breathed, wide-eyed as she and the others followed George into the room.
"I can't believe Sirius hasn't told us what you change into,” he said, trying to keep a straight face.
Ignoring that, Salazar continued. "I've been observing Boy for about thirty hours. I think I can help heal his psyche somewhat. I'm not saying I can cure him, but I can at least get Boy to how he was before the torture in the graveyard, if not slightly more functional."
Neville nodded and flooed away without another word. Shadow shook his head. Neville could still surprise him; he had never felt so grateful to have the shy, brave Gryffindor as his brother.
"We are trying to win a war," McGonagall added. All her tolerance and compassion had been stripped from her over the past weeks. "Hogwarts is besieged by darkness. Death Eater raids still continue unchecked. The populace is desperate and afraid. Riots and mass evacuations have taken place. The death tolls are in the hundreds."
Tonks grinned and flung herself at her love. Laughing, crying, she kissed his face over and over again until Remus finally relaxed and returned her embrace.
"Thanks for this. I'll try to make as many sessions as I can." Shadow slipped the coin into his pocket.
Shadow moved his chair closer and read over Draco's shoulder as the Slytherin carefully opened the letter.
"There's no cure," Draco explained hoarsely. "He has sentenced me as the Head of my family and as my father."
"The monitoring spells did render some important information, my Lord," Lucius said softly, shivering in anticipation and dread as that cold power brushed along his senses.
Demon fell to his knees, his back bowing forward, stretching, the skin tearing, the howl of rage turning into a wail of pain. His blood-soaked curls looked like they were unraveling, spilling to the floor, curtaining off his face. Bones snapped and popped, cloth tore. The agonized howl went on and on.
"Why would he tell you?" Hermione cried, eyes teary again. "You can't keep a secret to save your lives."
Shadow morphed into his human form, still very wet. He scowled at the blond as he began to cast drying charms. "Was that necessary?"
Piano music reached his ears and he slumped gratefully. He didn't want to be alone, but he didn't want to disturb anyone either. He hurried down the hallway and entered the music room. Music swelled around him. Shadow sat at the bench, head bowed, pounding on the keys. The relentless beat snapped and eddied around more melodious notes. There was nothing gentle in it, angry and loud and barely in control. The deep bass notes vibrated in his chest. Draco wrapped his arms around his chest and leaned against the door, giggling, hysteria creeping in at the edges.
"Is escaping and likely to think those in the dungeon are here to keep him locked up. We should clear the way for him." Draco didn't know what was going on, but the look on the disgusting goblin’s face and his instincts told him that something very bad was coming. Meeting it here in these close confines didn't set well with him. "Come on, Harry." He moved forward and grabbed his love’s arm.
He slid down, so Harry was thrusting desperately against his stomach as his arm slid between them, his finger brushing against Harry's entrance, then pressing inside. Harry gasped, eyes thrown open wide and he pulled away instinctively. Draco stopped, his hand stilling, waiting for permission.
"He's not a creature," he shouted over the thunder, screams, and cold delighted laughter. “He's Demon."
That didn't make sense, Neville thought. He approached the tree and touched it, briefly closing his eyes. The young oak was strong, healthy. It was a tree with no sense of magic about it, but… Trees always had a sense of time about them. They were witnesses to a lot of it, but Neville couldn't sense the patient memories that it should possess. It was as if…
Shadow quickly sat and wrote a letter. He still didn't want to face McGonagall in person yet. In the letter, he didn't give too many details about why he wanted the special warding around Carrow. It would only upset her when she had other things to think about. It wasn't like she could do anything about Carrow. Umbridge still had an unfortunate amount of influence, but he hinted enough for her to get the picture that the Slytherins needed support.
Neville jumped and spun around, terror clear in his eyes. When he saw it was only Draco, he relaxed and flushed with embarrassment. "I'm sorry for running out like that," he said hoarsely, eyes on the floor with shame.
"He's fine, poppet," Sirius murmured to her, holding her tight. Her arms squeezed his neck tightly. "He's sleeping and is about to wake up real soon."
Rough, muffled sobbing could be heard behind him. Severus was hissing with every inhale in. Remus was growling, the cooling charms slowing as he lost concentration.
Shadow shook his head, pulling out of his dark thoughts. "I like Rogan. He's a natural leader and he's smart, you know? Miles is very shy. Like you were, I guess, but Rogan looks out for him. Lillian is all spitfire. She loves to argue and she's incredibly quick to anger and equally quick to laugh. You never know which you're going to get with her."
Seraphim leapt as soon as the smaller man lowered his weapon, his attention turned sideways to his larger partner. The man screamed as the knife stabbed down into his chest and they both toppled over. Seraphim grinned as hot blood welled and speckled his face as he yanked the knife free. Elated, he laughed. He was no longer defenseless. Even without magic he could protect himself. The officer gurgled under him, his arms and hands spasming.
Shadow hurried back upstairs to his things. He grabbed a backpack and started stuffing it with things he thought he might need, like healing potions and his invisibility cloak. Then he quickly got dressed in in tight black pants and a long-sleeved black shirt, hoping it would grant him some measure of camouflage. He grabbed his daggers and was strapping one to each hip when a knock sounded on the door. He impatiently threw it open.
"Where is he?" Ginny hissed. "Did he hear me coming? Did you hide him? Don't bother. I know he's here."
"Charlie was telling me about that. Neville is my best friend. I think of him like a brother and his rescue is definitely on the top of my list. Are you paying attention to nature while you search? Neville is an Earth Elemental, and if he's unhappy or hurt, plant-life is affected around him. It could give us a clue as to where he is."
Shadow gasped. He had been talking out loud! How much had Draco heard? "N-Nothing," he stammered and yanked away from his friend.
Draco pulled his hand out of his pocket, leaving his wand hidden. "He appreciates it, I'm sure," he drawled. "Sorry, but we're running late. Come on, Seph."
The twins were shocked at how accurate their Animagus forms described them in relation to the world and each other. Not a lot of people realized there was a constant interchange going on between them. Fred was the one who had an obsession with pranks, but on his own he would prank just for the humor of it. It was George who guided those pranks with his need to teach others a more personal and immediate lesson, and it was his ability to look at things in a new light that generated their most original ideas.
Neville looked to Harry who nodded. "Yes," Neville agreed. "But only if you agree to work with everyone in this room."
Shadow was hardly listening. His heart hammered in his chest and he stared at Draco avidly, looking for the smallest sign that the blood curse had been stopped, and slowly Draco's breathing evened out, the creases in his face lessened as his eyes fluttered closed with exhaustion. The blood flowing from his nose, eyes, and ears came to a stop. Shaking, Shadow dipped a towel in water and gently washed his face clean once more.
he could get stronger and actually contribute to protecting Harry and stopping Voldemort, he felt ready to start letting go of the past and who he once was. He was ready to break out of the self-destructive pattern, and the first step was going home and facing his grandmother. If he could face her and not lose this newfound enlightenment and conviction, then Neville felt he might actually stand a chance. He might actually have the courage to be in Gryffindor. He might actually be worth Ginny's love. He might be strong enough to be Harry's brother.
"I spent three months in Azkaban during the trials and was finally released in January of '82. I was a wreck and Amalia took it upon herself to help me get back on my feet. Two months later, when I was stable again, I proposed to her. She accepted and revealed that she had a son, named Shadow, conceived the night of the raid. She would have told me before, but was afraid our son would be in danger while the Dark Lord still lived. When the Dark Lord fell, I was a wreck, so she continued to keep it secret until she felt I could handle the news.
One second he was on the ground, the next he was flinging himself mindlessly against the barrier holding him in. Magic cackled around him. It poured through his veins until he thought he would burst into flames… No! He was fire, and he was burning… burning…
Severus stood in the hallway for a moment more. He pulled the black silk robe closer around his body. He could feel the thin scar over his chest where he had made the cut. His limbs still trembled faintly, though the potion he had consumed after the ritual had helped greatly. It was done. Shadow was his in blood and name. He had a son.
"How many books? Is there light in the room? What type of wood are the shelves made from? Is there carpet? Can you see the walls at all? Can you see the ceiling?"
"Son, eh?" Olivander glided forward, his eyes glowing eerily. He put on his most ominous and knowing face. He loved impressing the children. Most of the year he was alone and lonely. Only the few months before school did he get to play, and he went out of his way to make a lasting impression.
Harry frowned when Bogrod unlocked the golden doors and led them to a four person cart, but he'd have to make do. Waiting until Bogrod and Draco were settled in the front and Remus and Severus in the back, he climbed into his father's lap, pinning Griphook between his back and Severus's chest. The goblin wasn't happy about that and muttered lowly in his language, his spindly fingers almost choking him.
Severus seemed to accept that. He straightened and turned to one of his bookcases. He drew his finger along their spines and took down two: a small blue one and a large but thin red one. "These may help you with Longbottom."
Remus's eyes darkened with pity. "He's dead, Neville. He attacked us and made you think we were your enemies. He was using you."
"We want to go back to that place with the dead snake. Do you remember? Food is there and it is hidden underground away from people," Draco explained, trying to gauge how much of the conversation Seraphim had actually followed.
"I don't know about you, but I'm ready for bed," Shadow said with a tired sigh. He got to his feet like an old man and walked stiffly to the door.
"I'll go out and get some," Sirius offered. When no one objected he made his way quickly from the room.
The rage came then. It struck him so hard that he was flung onto his back. His body arched as he clawed at the ground with a mindless roar of fury. The anger was as strong as the fear. It overpowered him. Prevented him from thinking, but it was better because now he could
"Right," Shadow called, gesturing for everyone to quiet down. "Shall we get practicing then?" He looked at the suggestions scrawled on scroll. "You all want to learn Disarming Spells. Okay. Everyone split up into pairs. We'll do Expelliarmus first. Anyone who already knows how to do this spell come here, you'll help with the others."
"Within our rooms," Rogan agreed but then shook his head. "Not outside them. Things are getting pretty desperate."
"I mean it." Neville met Draco’s eyes boldly. "I never thought you'd hurt him or that you'd be bad for him. You're a good friend to Shadow and I've always been glad for that. I just couldn't…" He took a deep breath. "I just couldn't see past what happened to me."
Harry smiled softly. Remus was right. As much therapy as he still needed, Severus obviously had issues of his own that needed to be worked out. His inability to hear compliments or gratitude wasn't healthy, and Harry suspected the root of that problem was very ugly and painful, something he hoped he could help Severus make some kind of peace with.
Luna laughed and squeezed him back before spinning away and firing off a mild Cutting Curse. Neville barely managed to dodge it in time. He fell with his wand in hand and fired back a Stinging Hex. Blood rushing with purpose, magic beating through his veins, Neville felt the build up of tension slowly wane and he laughed happily, despite Luna shredding his robes with a well-aimed curse.
Shadow as in Draco’s lap, his curly head of hair resting in the crook between neck and shoulder, his arms tucked in close to Draco’s chest. Draco had one arm curled around Shadow’s butt, the other hung limp over the chair’s arm. Marissa was still in her pretty dress and she swished it back and forth just to feel the material move around her as she stared at the two sleeping teens.
Severus sneered, his dark eyes reflecting the threat back at him. "I did not want to come in the first place. Let's go."
In answer, Shadow trotted over to a door and looked pointedly back at Neville. The Gryffindor opened the door and followed him inside.
"We will figure something out," Severus murmured, catching his son's eyes. "We will keep Marissa safe."
"So are you going to talk to me?" Draco asked quietly while the little girl was plastered to the window, looking for mermaids.
Shadow nodded once, firmly. "Good." He ran a hand through his messy curls and straightened his shoulders.
Shadow closed his eyes, feeling like Draco had just hit him. Here Draco was, in obvious pain, left for dead by his own bloody father, and all Draco cared about was protecting him; all Draco was worried about was making sure Shadow knew the prophecy was safe.
Shadow covered his face, as if he could block out the powerful emotions with the thin barrier, and pushed his back into the cushions behind him. He trembled, beginning to hyperventilate.
"You're blaming me for something I had NO CONTROL over! I didn't ask Seraphim to do what he did! I couldn't stop him! His Black magic was too powerful! You bloody well know I had nothing to do with it! It's not MY FAULT that he loves me, because
"Draco was just telling us about your new family addition." Remus smiled at the ruffled and sleepy teen.
Draco paled a little bit, attesting to his true state of nerves, but his expression never wavered. "Don't worry about a thing, Shadow. We have this in the bag."
Shadow finally saw his friend's distress and he opened his empathy a crack, immediately wincing at the sharp emotions spiraling within the Slytherin. Severus gave him nothing, he was doing his still pond routine. Shadow shut it down and turned to his father, hoping to put Draco more at ease.
Shadow nodded. "Thanks, Remus." He stood still as Remus pointed his wand at his eyes. The test took only a few seconds before he was released. He looked to his father. "So how long until I change back?"
"I'm a Prefect as well as you," Hermione huffed, rolling her eyes. "And we don't have duties tonight. It's the Slytherin's turn to patrol for students breaking curfew."
Severus merely nodded, but Shadow spoke up, politely, saying, ”Thank you.” The teen's voice was like his father's, rich and smooth, a good singing voice, but it was a bit higher than Severus'.
Harry winced and opened his eyes. Silver filled his vision as Draco stared down into his face, their lips almost touching they were so close. "It was that great, huh?" he sneered weakly, exhausted.
Shadow looked back at him, a wry smile twisting his lips, and then he looked off to the side. "Omi!"
"He's also a murderous, highly dangerous, Dark creature." The sound of him stomping across the room echoed through the speaker. "Look at this magic output! All of it the blackest magic we've ever seen."
Harry put aside the parchment and yawned. He hadn't been joking when he said he slept most of the day. At least he was down to only one nap instead of three. Remus projected he would be able to start taking long walks in a week or so. Harry couldn't wait. The bedside service had only been amusing the first six hours or so.
Shadow nodded in answer, unable to speak around the lump in his throat. His eyes were still burning. The streamers in the room were no longer red and gold. Instead, they were purple and white, colors carefully divorced from any association to Hogwarts. He was no longer Harry Potter, no longer a Gryffindor.
Eventually, Shadow could breathe normally again and his tears dried up. He still felt shaken, but he didn't feel like he’d been shattered into a hundred pieces, either. He was still such a fucking mess. He laughed bitterly and Neville smiled in perfect understanding. Neville didn't know what had driven Harry from bed in such a state, but he knew the feeling. He had woken up like this a million times in the past.
"I'm curious, Severus," Remus said, leaning toward the man. His amber eyes were wide and watchful. "What do you think we can do about the curse scar he does have? You said yourself that it can't be removed."
"I was walking and the windows told me something," she explained as she took his hand and tugged him toward the door. She was grinning. "I think there'll be Crumple-Horned Snorkacks running on the grounds today. Help me look for them? A picture would be worth a lot. No one has been able to catch them on film before. I brought my camera."
The ground was shaking so badly that they were all having a hard time now. Their footing was so bad their spells were going astray. Pritchard had almost hit Bill. Cracks were appearing in the walls and floor, dust was raining ominously down on them from the ceiling. Rodolphus was laughing, hands clamped on the teen's shoulders.
"What are you going on about?" Shadow demanded, fists clenched, thinking Severus had lost his mind. "You're
He smiled as he saw that Neville had erected a strong Tectussitum shield and rooted it into the stone under their feet, freeing him to continue casting offensive spells behind the shield's protection. Very clever. Neville may have weaker than average attack power, but his talent for defense was extraordinary. The ability to root shields in the earth gave him a huge advantage.
Fudge slammed the folders he was holding down on his desk with such violence that papers exploded everywhere. "I don't understand how they could just disappear!" he raged. "It's only one man, for Merlin's sake!"
Demon screamed at the heavens, head tilted back, oblivious to the cold rain pelting his face. He screamed and wrapped his arms around his chest - straight-jacket tight. A naked, repulsive face - a whisper-memory from Boy… and Demon opened hungry, inhumane eyes, looked into the distance and
"Miss Cissy!" the elf exclaimed delighted. "Oh, Miss Cissy a marvelous witch, she is. Mistress always approved of Miss Cissy and Miss Bella! Not that horrid Mudblood lover, Master Sirius! Banished him from the Family, Mistress did! Letting the filthy blood-traitors and filth into Mistress's old house…"
It was now almost midnight. Draco was about ready to throw in the towel. Seraphim held his sympathies, but he was very boring company. Right now, Seraphim was staring out the window at the night. If he wasn't doing that, he was wandering around the house, making sure the windows and doors were shut and locked, or humoring Draco by playing hide and seek. Not that that wasn't hard considering they didn't have furniture or anything to hide behind. Basically, they just looked in rooms and closets until they found the right one.
"I am sorry I put this pack in danger. I am dangerous, but if you let me, I can be dangerous to the pack's enemies as well."
Draco and Marissa lay sleeping amongst a pile of blankets on the other side of the room, whereas Neville and he rated only a single blanket each. In the middle, with Draco and Marissa on one side and Severus and Longbottom on the other, lay his son, curled into a defensive ball, his hands twitching and a frown disturbing his features. Severus knew the boy wasn't sleeping nearly as peacefully as Draco and Marissa, and he felt a pang, wishing his son could find rest without his past haunting him.
"And that allegation upsets you," Remus said carefully, trying to feel his way through this obviously sensitive subject.
"I know." Remus stood. "I should go. The Tonkses are coming over to Grimmauld Place for dinner. Marissa is helping cook, I believe."
Getting up, he began doing stretches to get his blood flowing and loosen his muscles, all under the guise of seemingly innocent restless pacing. He could almost smile. The Death Eaters were dangerous, yes, but they had no idea who they were dealing with. In that way, they could almost be pitied.
This time it was Sirius who transformed back to his human self and slammed the curtains closed with a snarl on his human lips. Hermione came running downstairs, flushed and frazzled, books almost overflowing from her arms. Ron was running after her, dragging both their trunks, his shoes untied. Shadow wanted to look away, but it was like a car crash: horrifyingly mesmerizing.
Draco and Harry spun to see three lackeys come barreling toward them. Harry slashed out with his wand reflexively and their Dark spell splashed harmlessly against his shield and ricocheted into the wall. The wallpaper curled up and disintegrated, revealing smooth white stone underneath. Draco had a return curse on his lips, but he never uttered it. He watched in morbid fascination as the last guy went rigid, his mouth falling open as he screamed in agony.
"Boggarts feed on fear so when she released one it pulled Boy front and center," Salazar growled, but his grimace slowly relaxed into an evil smirk. "She got more than she bargained for at least. She about fainted when the Dark Lord, Vernon Dursley, and Lockhart appeared in her office! You should have seen her face when she saw the way the pervert was fondling himself! She ran out of there so fast, I felt a breeze!"
Jack-o-lanterns, Miles explained, were actually used to ward off evil spirits. Spirits were different from ghosts. They were souls that didn't have enough energy or magic to make themselves true ghosts, but they weren't ready to pass on, either. So they were especially restless and angry when they could affect the material plane, which they could on this one night of the year when the barrier between the spirit realm and the material realm was thinnest. That was why you made the pumpkin face scary. It had to frighten away the evil spirits.
"Well, these two energies are considered dark and light. The dark magic is pure chaos energy and can be used to destroy, unravel, or completely muck up physical matter. Light magic is pure creative energy. It can stabilize, support, and re-create physical matter. These energies were the original source of the terms Light and Dark magic. By deciding if a spell was closer to chaotic energy or creative energy, it was classified as either Light or Dark, but really all spells are neutral magic because we cannot manipulate or access the chaotic or creative energies. Then slowly over time as fewer and fewer wizards and witches could access these two planes, the terms lost their original meaning and began to have moral connotations; Light meaning good and Dark bad.
They are the masters of secrets; always having their own, but never allowing their secrets to rule their lives. They never forget the truth of things even if they actively allow the truth to be hidden. This makes a Lynx-type person a good person to go to for advice. In addition to knowing when to be silent, the Lynx also knows when to speak and gives wise council.
The whole fucking building was falling on their heads, a dead Auror was sprawled across from them, Severus wasn’t breathing, and they only had seconds before Kingsley came back for them.
The first Shadow and Draco heard of the Heritage Registry was when they went to DA at nine-thirty to find Ron holding a sobbing Hermione. Sharing a worried glance, the two Slytherins hurried over.
He wasn't sure he liked this new nest his pack had seemingly claimed. He could smell the fledging strong in this room, it obviously belonged to the little female, and he could scent his soon-mate's space from here, not to much deeper in the warren. He could also smell his own scent, though it smelled a little strange, in the space next to the smaller male's. This warren was obviously their new nest, but the scent of two other humans disturbed him. Before he explored and made a decision about whether he'd allow this to become their nest, he wanted to feed his pack.
"I'd say that's the first good news we've gotten in days," Charlie answered. "We have no way to contact Severus ourselves, and when you proved not to be able to contact him either, we were really disappointed. The war has begun and we're all on the same side. Tell Severus that he is welcome to come back and we will do our best to protect his son, the Boy-Who-Lived."
Harry Potter lay on his back, his arms straight and loose at his sides. There was no mistaking the figure. The teen had messy dark brown - practically black - hair, golden skin, a round face, and thicker eyebrows. Shadow's robes looked too big on him, attesting to the fact that he'd lost some height. The only thing missing was the lightning bolt scar on the unmarred forehead. Draco knew it would still be over his heart where they had moved it.
"My loyalty is being questioned by my old comrades. They've gone to check my wand for the curse that felled the old man."
Shadow laughed and led them into, what they now called, the strategy room. In front of the statue was a large round table with papers and plans spread out on it. The two green sofa chairs were set over to the side, ready when needed. A pot of tea also sat at the table and Draco poured the twins a cup as Shadow explained his plan.
"Fine," Shadow gave in reluctantly, glowering at the compact. "But I want you to contact us as often as you can."
Climbing into his small tent, he stood up in wizard-space. A small living room, kitchenette, bathroom, and bedroom; everything he would need. Calm, deliberate, Severus began to prepare a special brand of tea. It would relax his mind and boost his mental talents. When he was ready, he retired to his bedroom, preparing himself for this unpleasant task. He briefly considered leaving, running and saving his own life, but the memory of Lily stopped him. For her, he had to go on.
Shadow understood that and was impressed. "All right. We're meeting at the Hog's Head. You can invite others you think would really want to do this and who will keep quiet about it. It's just a meeting to iron out the details."
Sighing, Seraphim stepped up toward the blond and leaned his shoulder against the Slytherin's. Draco very carefully put his arm around the thin shoulders and closed his eyes, trying to ignore Seraphim's flinch. He pictured the Forbidden Forest as clearly as he could and
"Well," Rowena began when Salazar merely crossed his arms and sulked. "His magical core was severely drained performing some great magic. His body shut down that area of his brain that controls magical energy because stressing it much more would have killed him from magical shock. This means that he had no access to his magic while his magical channels healed. When he was no longer in danger of killing himself, that part of the brain switched back on. He's still recovering, however, and it may be a few weeks before he's back to full strength."
Harry knew he was being a prat. Every morning, Draco would hold him and get him through the aftereffects of his dreams, but as soon as they left their bedroom, Harry ignored him completely. Draco hadn't even been allowed to go with him on the raids. He knew the blond was about to reach the edge of his patience, but Harry still couldn't find it in himself to face him. He felt desperately ashamed and guilty, but he also couldn't banish the jealousy or the sense of betrayal.
"There is no easy fix, Shadow," Severus said softly. He reached over and gently patted his son's clenched fist. "You know that."
"Oh, Paddy," Remus sighed, noticing the scratch marks on the dog's nose and mussel. "You have to learn not to push people."
"What?" Severus asked shrewdly. He uncrossed his legs and leaned forward, forearms on his thighs. "What are you thinking?"
The teen shook his head, making his curls bounce. "I wasn't hurt. They left me in a room and just forgot about me, believe it or not."
"Hey," Draco murmured and pulled Shadow in with a one-armed hug. The brunet was so upset that he allowed it and leaned against Draco's side. "You would never free Demon. Not because you shouldn't, but because you don't need to. You're strong enough to stop the Death Eaters alone, but you also have me and Severus to help you. Demon is unnecessary."
"Not at all. Learning what they know will be a great benefit to us, and between Black and I, they won't be able to hold us long. Meet me down the street, Black. We'll go in together."
"So tell me… How are you feeling about the adoption?" Severus inquired. "We haven't had a session in a long time. I believe we are over due."
"Malfoy's pretty good," Miles continued, picking up where the conversation had trailed off. "At first, he was only let on the team because his father bought really top-of-the-line brooms for everyone, but he practiced hard and got pretty good. I think he could have beaten Potter, but their rivalry distracted him. He focused more on Potter and less on the Snitch."
"Everything is crazy here! We're swamped with letters and panicked demands due to that blasted article! I can't handle your situation as well!" Fudge bellowed.
for forgiveness, and only then would Voldemort end his pathetic life. As for Snape's brat, the boy must have arrived with Snape and gotten Potter away before joining the others. But now that Voldemort had an image of Snape's spawn, he'd be sure to slaughter him alongside his faithless father.
Shadow thrashed and kneed Draco in the stomach. "Get over… yourself! Just because we're… friends doesn't mean… I have to tell you… everything!"
Those who went on the raid shared an uneasy glance, remembering what Neville’s magic had done, but they knew better than to say anything. Charlie had already made it clear that Neville's abilities were classified.
Ron was standing a few feet away, watching them suspiciously, and when he saw Shadow take Neville's hand and the shy Gryffindor blush, his eyebrows shot up almost into his hairline.
At first, she attributed it to him not knowing her very well. They were still new. But she had been dating Neville longer than anyone else, so why wouldn't he go further than a single kiss? Neville pulled her firmly aside as three second years ran passed yelling and pushing each other. He laughed, his eyes sparkling down at her.
Shadow's eyes widened and he stood tense as he felt Draco's nails scrap gently along his scalp and then the long fingers cupped the back of his head. He could hardly breathe. Conflicting impulses warred viciously behind his eyes as Draco took a bold step forward, then another. They were standing in front of each other now, only inches apart.
, did he ever think this would be possible. He had accepted that he'd die as the Dark Lord's servant, although an unfaithful one, just as he accepted that the sun would rise every morning.
"As long as sticks to simple spells, it should not matter," Rowena reassured. "Though I'd stay away from larger workings if I were him. Sustained stress on an already bruised and sensitive brain can lead to breaking that area completely and render him unable to use magic or possibly dead if he goes into shock."
He was so confused! His arms itched like mad, and as Severus walked away, taking the light with him, he summoned his razor. Tears burned down his cheeks and his hands shook so badly that he didn't dare make a cut yet. He almost severed a finger when Luna put a hand on his shoulder and he jumped.
"I wasn't aware he knew the truth, is all, Madam Longbottom," Shadow responded and, to forestall more questions or conversation, he dug into the food. It tasted heavenly.
He led them out into Muggle Italy for disguises. The first place he stopped was a hair salon. The wizards with him looked doubtful that Muggles could actually help and Shadow just smiled knowingly. Everyone spoke in Italian of course, but Severus had cast a temporary language spell on them before they'd left the house. All they could hear was English and all the Muggles heard when they spoke was Italian.
The man's arm tensed, his wand was coming around again, and Shadow struck. Once. Twice. Three times. His fangs plunged into warm flesh, screams vibrated along his scales as delicious tangy blood flooded his mouth. Ribs splintered beneath his jaws and he released, worried bone would pierce his soft mouth.
Draco yelled something. No, maybe. Everything was happening too fast. The hairy woman, mad with fear, leaped at Draco. She was probably begging for help, but in her panic she was clawing at him, scratching his skin, drawing blood. Draco cried out in pain and tried to push her off. Then Demon was there.
"Needless to say, that's none of your business really," Shadow interrupted. He cast his strange eyes among all of them, collecting their complete attention with that simple gaze. There was an intensity about him that drew them in. "There are Gryffindor Death Eaters, cruel Hufflepuffs, and sadistic Ravenclaws. None of this matters. I'm not asking you where your loyalty lie's, so we don't need to ask the Slytherins, either. We're here because we want to form a group to learn defense. This isn't about politics or family history. This is about protecting ourselves."
Umbridge said nothing to this. Her blue eyes were bright with some unnamed emotion. McGonagall waited for her to say something more, but the woman merely turned and left.
"Well, that's true…" She trailed off, not sure what she should say. She glanced at Shadow for help and was surprised to see him looking distinctly upset. He turned his back to her when he saw her looking and walked away toward a table where he'd placed his robe.
Shadow's fingers tightened in Draco's silk pajama shirt. "Nev… He was in the graveyard," he croaked, his teeth beginning to chatter as he descended into shock. "They were circling him… Pined him down with wooden stakes, impaling him… He was sc-screaming…"
Harry didn't answer right away, instead he sat at the small desk in one corner and pulled out some parchment and a quill. "I'm fine."
"Do they teach you nothing about magic anymore?" Rowena grumbled. She sighed. "Magic is energy. Wizards and witches have the ability to access this ambient energy and direct it. It's like the brain's ability to hear sound and then translate it into words with meaning. There is a sixth sense, and the brain either translates this sense or it doesn't. And the finer control one has - like motor control, some people naturally have better aim or balance than others, while some must put forth effort and practice - the more magic they can direct without causing strain and injuring that area of the brain."
Shadow sighed. He wasn't going to tell them about his DID, so instead he said the Hat had originally wanted him in Slytherin and that he went with it this time because he thought he could make a difference there. Plus, being in Gryffindor might make people suspicious of his past identity. He didn't say anything about Draco. He didn't feel it was any of their business. Hermione wisely didn't push it, but Ron couldn't let it go.
Severus levitated the woman's unconscious body back up to her office, planning on arranging her there as if she had fallen asleep at her desk after the detention. He propped her upright outside the door before cracking it open. It was pitch black. Casting a temporary night-sight spell, Severus glanced around the room. He was utterly shocked at what he saw.
"Are you okay?" Shadow asked quietly, coming up behind his father. He noticed that his limp was even more pronounced than normal and his voice deeper with exhaustion.
"Look," he said roughly, throwing a lone shoe away from him in frustration and simmering humiliation. "I didn't tell you because… Shit, I just don't want to talk about it. Ever. But I guess I'm glad you came when you did.”
Severus kept his eyes on Seraphim while he listened. The alter looked like a cornered animal, but he was still coherent and rational. His intelligence grew every time he came out, it seemed. From Draco's description, the Demon-Boy combined alter could hardly speak in whole sentences after the incident at St Mungo's. He was unsure why Seraphim was growing more intelligent, but he was certain that the jacket would prove to be a disaster. From his studies in Muggle psychology, he had read of something disturbingly similar: the straight jacket. He didn't want his son to feel he was irredeemably insane. That was not a self-image from which one could easily recover.
"Neville, please, you have no idea what's going on. It might even be too late," Charlie cried urgently. "He could be under attack right now! You need to tell us where they are."
McGonagall had her bloodless lips pressed together, looking grim indeed, while Charlie solemnly canceled the alarms. Moody, his eye spinning wildly, growled, "Kid's been abducted." Tonks gasped and just now realized that Shadow was supposed to be in this room, too.
Severus knew that was as much regret as he was going to get from the boy and let it go for now. To be honest, he understood Harry's position. The power Dumbledore had over him had been great, should the headmaster choose to use it. As he had chosen the night Harry was taken to the graveyard, refusing Harry the help he needed. Severus, himself, had been trying to kill the headmaster while they dueled. He couldn't exactly reprimand Harry for making the same choice.
The DA had three meetings over this time. Umbridge was so distracted dealing with the staff and faculty that she wasn't paying as close attention to the student body. Hermione also thought of a way they could communicate the date and time of the DA meetings since they rarely knew when they could safely get together in advance. So far it had worked, but it wouldn't much longer as more people were coming. They had five new members so far and expected that number to grow.
Umbridge made her way to breakfast Wednesday morning feeling gleeful. She had a perfect way to trap little Snape Jr. into a detention. The little brat was behind her potential Slytherin spies turning silent, she just knew it! Well, she wouldn't let that evil Death Eater child get away with this. She'd punish him and make him realize what going against the Ministry meant!
Draco jumped as the elf screamed the last and then his eyes went wide. His heart pumped in his chest hard. The locket! Shadow was right! There was a clue here that Sirius had overlooked! Fingers trembling slightly as adrenaline dumped through his veins, Draco forced his voice level. "Kreacher. Stop."
"Not really.” Draco shrugged and turned to face the keys. He lifted a hand and pushed a few down. The notes filled the room. "He's powerful and terrifying, and I'd hate to be the Dursleys, but… He only comes Out when you're broken. And I'm grateful for that. In any case, I don't plan on seeing you like that again. So… What's there to be scared of?"
"That was Wednesday. Today's Sunday." Draco ignored his friend's open-mouthed shock and moved toward the kitchen. To busy his hands, he began making sandwiches. They were running out of bread and tomatoes. "We stayed inside mostly. Took a few walks, went to the gas station to buy food. Nothing went wrong. But last night was the full moon. Seph's Animagus form is half-werewolf. He transformed. I managed to spell the jacket off before it was ruined, but I couldn't save the rest of your clothes, sorry."
"No one got in. We're safe for now," she told the older woman, very glad she wouldn't ever have to face this ferocious mother on the battlefield. Then she paused and looked the group over again. "Where's Draco?"
"I wasn't in any shape to be grabbing anything," Draco admitted reluctantly, his voice hard. He was still ashamed of his inability to help at the manor. Harry would have died if Seraphim hadn't come Out. "Last thing I remember is Seraphim launching himself at Neville, then the whole manor fell on our heads. I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was in the Muggle house that Seraphim has claimed, the one where he found Marissa."
"People with eyes like that are either Seers or Cursed, and not in a spell sense," the girl argued. "If you're a Cursed One, then I don't think you should hang out with us."
"Of course I want to 'shut them off', as you so eloquently put it!" Severus finally exploded. "Have you considered the fact that connections go
They were almost to the nearby snogging room when the twins happened upon them on their way back to the dorms from their late night wanderings. They were up to something, but no one knew what. Neville made a mental note to ask Shadow if he knew before the next DA meeting.
"I'm glad you approve.” Harry laughed. "Why don't you get unpacked and settled in. I've been ordered to take an hour nap."
Severus smiled grimly. When he had woken the teen from a fitful sleep, Rogan had screamed. Severus had forgotten about his changed appearance until that moment and had been taken aback. Thankfully, Rogan seemed to be adjusting to Draco's presence much better.
So hard to think through the rage and fear while dodging the deadly, powerful curse. The rune… something about the rune… A snarl slipped past his lips, hate almost a living thing inside him. He wrestled it into submission. Understanding dawned and he laughed madly.
"If you're not on the Ministry wanted list, why don't you come back to classes, mate?" Ron asked with a frown.
"It could be imparting another clue as to the Dark Lord's Horcruxes," Severus speculated, his features going still as he found his calm center.
Draco had snuck past his barriers when he was still fractured, when all Draco had known was Silas through letters and from working together over a basilisk corpse. It had been during one of those sessions that Draco had insisted they move their association toward something more personal and not just business.
Shadow whimpered, his head bowed, sweat dripping from his curls. He was running out of strength. A fine tremor took up in his arms and shoulders. Black dots danced in his vision, but he refused to let go. His heart beat a rapid pace and coldness was seeping back in his veins. Demon was practically salivating at the prospect of Shadow falling and letting him Out.
"Good idea," Shadow approved, very pleased she had come up with this so fast. He had expected to have to hint more. None of the other Houses would let a Slytherin bind them, but they would trust Hermione. "Do you think you will have something by Saturday?"
The boy's eyes fluttered open despite her gentle charm when she spread his curtains. He let out an uncomfortable moan, his eyes glassy. She smiled and allowed herself to trail her fingers over his soft cheek, down his tender neck. Such beautiful unblemished skin, such strong muscles. She bet his blood would be extra rich. She wondered if it would taste like the forest.
"So what do we do?" Draco asked, biting his lip in an uncharacteristic display of fear. What if Shadow never forgave him for not telling him about his eyes? What if Shadow used this stupid fight to push him away?
"Where?" Sirius demanded, all his attention focused on his friend. "I have to get to Malfoy quick, Moony."
Boy flinched, his arms coming up to protect his head as he cried out, "I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I'm sorry, so sorry! Please don't hurt me! Please!"
Months later, in the middle of the summer after their fourth year, Shadow had again sat and listened to Draco recount a horrifying summer. They had sat at his piano and Draco next to him, telling him how Lucius had gone crazy after the graveyard, sometimes even physically attacking him and his mother. Worse, Lucius had forced Draco to witness Shadow's torture first hand with him in a Pensieve.
Draco's humor crumbled to dust as everything came rushing back. He turned his face to the piano. Shadows danced on the walls as the single spark of light shifted. "Why do you do it?"
"Draco must drink it willingly and unaided or it won't work," Remus answered, voice intense, his eyes pinned to the two on the bed.
Because of this, Bats often represent fertility. They are sometimes used as ingredients of aphrodisiac Potions. Historically, women placed drops of Bat blood under their pillow, hoping it would bring her children. Another superstition of long ago was that the Bat had a very heavy brain, forcing it to roost upside down. This may explain why those with a Bat Animagus possess above average intelligence.
"What are you two doing?" Neville smiled, coming to stand beside Shadow. "I didn't know you wanted to learn, Draco."
"I'm sure." Shadow looked around the room, avoiding the tired and lost expression on the blond's face. He couldn't even imagine how hard everything was for Draco right now. He'd rebelled against his family, defied his father, abandoned his mother, placed himself against a madman and his army, and had just learned that what he knew about magic and bloodlines was wrong. Shadow wasn't the only one with issues.
Shadow looked at Neville, shocked. His brother flushed, but he shook his head slightly to reassure Shadow they didn't know everything.
Remus turned to him with a smile. "Yes. In fact, he's the youngest ever Animagus. He mastered the transformation several months before Shadow."
He was further pleased when McGonagall seemed to immediately take his advice and move several feet backward. Seraphim relaxed marginally and edged backward as well, his wing still extended to force Draco backward. Since this was what he wanted, he moved readily. Seraphim didn't turn his back on McGonagall once. In fact, he didn't turn around until they were down the stairs and back on the second floor. Seraphim then turned and hurried back toward the entrance of the Chamber.
Shadow straightened and met his father's stare. He nodded, promising silently to do as he was asked.
"No." Severus shook his head. "You know that is not what I am saying. I'm saying that it is a psychological and biological need for humans to search for a companion. Loving relationships are essential for our wellbeing. Even if such relationships were to end badly, they are worth it. Of course, unhealthy or abusive relationships are not good, but that is not what we are talking about here."
As he began to get dressed, a quick wave of his hand had the date and time appearing before him: Tuesday, July 31st, 1995; 10:43pm. So he only slept through one day. That was good. He was tired of spending most of his life unconscious. He had a sudden urge to play piano, so he made his way to the music room.
