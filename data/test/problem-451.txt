He took off the sorting had and placed it on top of the stool. Sidereum suddenly reared up as if expressing just how elated he was to be in Slytherin.
The entire class heard and most of them burst into laughter but Malfoy just turned crimson red and gave Harry a look that told him he knew exactly what Harry was doing. Harry decided to act like nothing out of the ordinary had happened though and just fixed the spill and finished up his essay, trying ridiculously hard not to stare at Malfoy. Not that that was something he had to prevent himself from doing often.Satisfied with the amount of embarrassment he had caused Malfoy, he just left class intending on going up to his dorm and get a head start on his homework so that Hermione wouldn't pester him after arithmancy. However, Draco had different plans.
He immediately started scribbling down the events of what happened out of order but very detailed and at one point he said something about it being 'unsettlingly slytherin of him' and Sidereum interjected evidently upset.
"Congrats mate! Do you like the new kiss cam Fred and George convinced Mcgonagall to let them put up? Personally, I think it's fascinating, it focuses on the single people who have the most chemistry. There are going to be so many new couples at Hogwarts this year." Ron said while looking very excited at the prospect of embarrassing outings and unintentionally revealed feelings.
They were reviewing the process for a particularly complicated spell and Draco had attempted it too early and his goblet turned into a meowing bowl instead of a kneazle.
"Let the feast begin!" Mcgonagall yelled above the pandemonium and all hope at regaining the crowds attention was gone after that.
Malfoy was standing in the middle of the shop examining a light leaf. Harry couldn't really remember but that one was a product to help with nightmares for war survivors, he should really look into getting one of those. But more surprising than that, Malfoy's hair was electric blue and he was wearing jeans and a muggle band t-shirt. He was staring at him for what was definitely too long because his friends had left to explore the new products and Malfoy had started walking over to him.
"You might want to check that coffee for poison Harry-" Jared was smirking at him of all things like he just got Potter to turn on him with a single comment and he thought it had worked because Potter looked like he'd just stepped in something awful but he was utterly shell-shocked at what he said.
He was dragged out of his thoughts by Hermione and Ron arriving. They had brought Fred and Lavender with them and seemed very happy. Although he was curious about the new additions to the shopping group he decided to file it in his memory for later. Hermione and Fred didn't seem phased by the snake but Ron and Lavender were rather startled and it took some convincing to get them to sit down.
"Ah, I see yes, you seem to have an unsealed First Degree bond with this snake. The best course of action at this moment will be to seal the bond as it will help you to better understand exactly what it is that -don't interrupt me-Â  you have been so lucky as to have. And before you ask, the way to seal the bond is to name your new friend over here"
Sidereum hadn't left his side for anything other than food since he came out of his shell and to let Harry shower, which had to take several hours of convincing every time and it was a bit annoying but surprisingly he was fine with it. He was going to meet Hermione, Ron and Lavender at King's cross, Fred was already at Hogwarts because he had been making lesson plans. Harry apparated to a place near King's Cross and walked the rest of the way, he always liked walking, or running. He spent most of his time like that after the war, it always calmed him but his absolute favourite thing to do was to stargaze. No matter how many things changed in his life, he always loved to stargaze, they were always there, and he would look at them for hours on end at the Dursley's even as a kid. They were the only thing that ever gave him real hope during the war and he liked to think that all the people he had lost were up there.
Harry hadn't played Quidditch in front of other people for a while but as soon as he walked out he missed it. He heard the screams coming from all sides of the stadium and the cheers and saw all the banners the houses had made last minute. After some seriously ridiculous tryouts, Blaise had accepted Harry as a suitable replacement for Draco, who had quit earlier in the year because he had lost interest in the sport. He saw all of the players lined up for their starting plays and for the first time in a very long time, Harry felt like he had made it home because even if everything else changed, Quidditch was always there for him at the end of the day.
"Yes Potter, it's fine if we sit together so long as you help me because I am absolutely rubbish at this class and somehow you managed to be top in the subject." Draco smirked at how nervous Harry had been to ask such a simple question, it was almost
Harry sat in his room for a couple hours bringing up random conversation topics and exploring the mental bond between the two and Sidereum refused to detangle himself from Harry. He had tried to convince him to for a couple hours but gave up eventually seeing that he wasn't going to change his mind. A thought crossed his mind and he immediately shot up frustrated at himself for not doing this earlier.
Although he was confused as to how she knew about his tattoo he happily obliged, accidentally conjuring a couch for her to sit on while he was looking for a place to put her down. She looked a bit startled but not very surprised which was odd because not many wizards could wandlessly and wordlessly conjure even the smallest of objects. He sat across from her on his bed and began to roll his sleeve up, still awestruck by the intricate colors and patterns of the design on his arm that hadn't been there mere minutes ago.
"Let's go then Gryffindorks!" With Ginny's rather offensive remark, Harry led them out onto the pitch.
They headed to Professor Binns' class right after lunch and just as Harry had suspected, Ron fell asleep immediately and Hermione was just looking rather suspicious of Harry's antics. Harry was taking his notes, rather grudgingly and only for his not so devious plan. Once they had been assigned the homework and they were all working on it quietly Harry decided he would, in his words 'take action'. He pretended to accidentally knock over his ink and mumble his own surname a little bit too loudly.
"Honestly mate, just snog him already it's obvious you're in love with him, the only person that hasn't figured it out yet is the ferret himself."
"While I would advise against using your wand Harry, you will be free to explore the capabilities you now have when you arrive at Hogwarts. While I evidently cannot stop you, I strongly advise not using your magic until then as it will not only be in an uncontrolled environment but will likely make your ever so unpleasant house mates livid. I will be casting a protective charm around your room and I advise you not to leave unless you are travelling to Kings Cross Station for the train to Hogwarts or going to Diagon Alley for school supplies. The Dursely's are furious and I imagine they will not hesitate to abuse you on sight for having a snake in your bedroom."
"That's when a wizard and a magical creature share a special sort of bond, I don't remember much of it, Hermione hasn't made me read on them since third year when we thought Sirius Black was a murderer and he was controlling a giant black dog."
Sidereum handed over the wand from where he had coiled his tail around it and Harry held it out to Malfoy.
"Yeah, right well just don't get too drunk. Nothing good ever happens when you're that drunk." Ron said with a smirk.
"I do not know what you're talking about! I am perfectly fine when I'm drunk." Harry basically shouted at Ron feeling very offended.
It was a very nice day in Diagon Alley, there were only a couple clouds and the sky was bright with the suns rays that seemed to slash through the atmosphere of mourning everyone seemed so adamant in upholding. The only thing out of the ordinary was Harry Potter walking through Wizarding London with a frighteningly large Venenata snake.
"I got your coffee Harry, we should leave for class in the next couple minutes though if you don't want to be- ah, I see you've met Jared." he tried to sound surprised and like he hadn't been listening to their conversation and luckily Potter was dense enough to take the bait.
wand reconnect with his magic and welcome him back. They didn't say anything else until they got to the Transfiguration classroom.
They sat in a comfortable silence for a while just eating and enjoying each other's company. Eventually, they started talking about how Fred had gotten a position as the new charms professor because Flitwick had retired and that George would now be running Weasley's Wizard Wheezes most of the time and Fred would just be helping him create new pranks and run the store on weekends. He claimed that he took the job because 'we just have to find a way to prank Minnie and we didn't get to do it at school'. They all knew that it was simply because he really did love Charms and was so excited to be able to help smaller children with it. It really was sweet.
"Merlin 'Mione, let the man breathe for a minute he's obviously exhausted." This infuriated Hermione even more than before and she turned to Ron and started yelling at him. Harry had nearly gotten to the dormitory hallway but they caught him before he could.
Harry finally got to his dorm which to his delight had a perfect view of the sky and a bay window to star gaze in. He was sharing a room with what seemed like a Ravenclaw a Hufflepuff and another Slytherin. He didn't recognize the other two but he did recognize that he was going to be rooming with
"PARTY TIME BITCHES!" Blaise was running down the stands screaming, it had been quite a long time since they had won a match by that much and he was always looking for an excuse to throw a party, this just seemed like a good reason.
name. There were audible gasps from everyone in the room including Ron and Hermione. Hesitantly, Harry made his way up to the stool where the sorting hat was resting. He gave Minerva a bit of a panicked look and put the hat on his head.
Sighing, Harry sat himself down on a couch near the common room preparing himself for a conversation that he knew would turn into a one-sided lecture when he refused to talk about his feelings. He knew it was unreasonable that he never told his friends how he was feeling but it was just too hard to say out loud and he was scared he wouldn't stop until he'd told them everything and he wasn't ready to be that vulnerable with anyone for that matter.
As soon as he rounded the corner into the hallway he needed to take to get to the kitchens he was cut off by a group of Hufflepuff sixth years. A teacher had shown up and prevented him from being hexed but he knew if the Hufflepuffs would be so dramatic, it would get a lot worse. He was greeted by some very unwelcoming house elves when he entered the kitchen until he told them he was there to get Harry's coffee because he had slept in. After that, the house elves were plently happy to get Draco whatever he wanted.
"Profe- Minerva, what are the differences between these 'Degree bond' things and how can you tell and why can't I use my wand and-"
"What's? Oh yeah of course wait but whats the... hair?" Harry was far too surprised by this new side of Malfoy than reasonable and he was having trouble forming a real sentence.
"I have successfully raided the candy supply off of the trolley! Who wants some? I got way more than I need."
They neared the end of the sorting and the new students between houses was split pretty evenly, Hufflepuff had gotten the most though. Hagrid had finished calling all the names of the first years and Harry hadn't even noticed, he was only snapped out of his numb trance when the sorting hat itself called
"I am NOT in love with him Ron I am just uh... I don't know what but I'm not in love with him no I couldn't be."
He finally arrived at home, back at the Dursley's once more. He had thought that he was free of them after the war but he couldn't bear to be at number 12 Grimmauld Place after Sirius' death and the only place for him to go was right back with his retched muggle family. Harry had -of course- been locked in his room and barely fed, as usual but today was particularly bad, he couldn't stop the voices in his head telling him that it was all his fault that Teddy would grow up without his parents, that Dennis would have to grow up without his older brother. He pulled out his transfiguration textbook and started reading up on a new type of transformations that Mcgonagall had discovered during the war, something about manifesting abnormally potent emotions into actual objects.
"Petunia! That retched boy has snuck a snake into this house!" Vernon had started screaming once again and although it rattled Harry, he felt oddly comforted by the snake that had coiled itself all around his figure surprisingly quickly. He had read up on this snake when the trio was in the library after they had figured out that the voices Harry was hearing was hissing from the pipes. He didn't remember much but he knew they could grow up to 10 meters and this one had hatched at about 3 meters long which was impressive even for this breed. He also remembered that it was very rare and super venomous but he couldn't recall any specifics.
"Well, now that spot of trouble has been fixed I can try my best to explain this situation to you."Â  She just sat for a moment and Harry could see the wheels spinning in her brain trying to figure out where to begin. "First I must ask you Harry, if you know what a familiar bond is?"
"'Mione if anything, he'll get less homework done because he'll be constantly snogging the ferret. But it's cool with us Harry, as long as you don't go getting your heart broken, we will leave the fe- Draco, along."
Draco had managed to keep away the fact that his signature phrases were a school wide joke but that didn't stop Harry constantly spying on Draco and picking up on it all by himself.
Turns out, Harry can't even seem to have dinner without causing a scene. This one however was quite welcome to him.
He started walking over a little exasperated at Potter's antics and was about to start telling him off when he heard him. Potter was singing. Of all the things he could be doing at such an hour, he was off dancing and singing and sounding rather amazing. Draco had never heard the song before but he was sure that even for muggle standards, Potter was undeniably amazing at singing. He also looked really really okay, Malfoy hadn't seen so much of a smirk from Harry since the war but he was positively beaming right now. Draco was stunned into silence at such an odd and didn't move for quite a while.
He came back through the portrait hole and was greeted by a frustrated Pansy and he had to assure her that he would explain everything later that night before she would let him go up to him dorm. He got to his room and he saw Jared and Potter having a conversation which he presumed was about Harry's snake, that's really the only thing that would interest Jared, a chance to flaunt his intelligence about some obscure animal. He decided to walk into the room before Jared got the chance to tell him just how awful Draco was while he watched.
"Take a breath 'Mione Harry doesn't even know most of what's going on at the moment give him a minute. It would be cool to see that tattoo though" Fred finished with a wink.
"You mean me Ron, we both know even if you don't get blackout drunk by some miracle you're still going to be hammered thirty minutes in."
"You're still going to get blackout drunk aren't you?" Ron questioned with a concerned and slightly disgusted grimace.
He noticed Potter's snake handing him something he figured it had been holding in it's tail and then he held it out to Draco. They didn't stop walking but Potter said something Draco didn't actually hear most of and he could only manage a nod because he was too busy choking back the tears in his eyes. He held his hand and he could feel the wand,
of all people. They were being civil sure, but living together was going to be a lot harder than tolerating one another during classes. Luckily though, Mcgonagall had added a fifth table for the eighth years and he would still be able to eat meals with his friends. That was probably the only thing from Hermione's lecture that had stuck out to Harry though, he had zoned out through most of it.
They had decided to get their books for the school year first and then get quills and an unreasonable amount of sweets to stash in their dormitories for the year. Harry had brought up going to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and all of a sudden they were in front of the shop. There seemed to be more decorations than they had ever seen before but Harry figured it was to cheer up as many people as possible from after the war and it also seemed to have worked. Harry walked in and there were more people than he had ever seen in any shop. He was baffled to say the least, this was probably everyone who was going to Hogwarts next year and more including
"What about you Harry? I know you decided against being an auror but you haven't really said what you want to do instead." he knew that Ron was trying to convince him he should be an auror with him since he didn't have another plan but Harry was just done fighting.
"With this Sidereum fellow, is a First Degree familiar bond, the last known bond of this sort belonged to Salazar Slytherin and their basilisk. I must warn you against using your wand from now on as your magic has been amplified a great deal and would now do very unexpected things as you are already a very powerful wizard and have still not figured out the expanse of your power since we removed the magic restrictors Dumbledore has kept on you for many years. While bonds above a third degree are very rare we do not know the extent of what you may now be able to do."
Although he was a bit uncomfortable with all the stares, he was doing alright. Hermione and Ron had agreed to meet up with him and he was waiting at the Leaky Cauldron for them. He had already gone to the owl shop in hopes of getting mice for Sidereum. He had managed to get plenty enough for Sidereum and a couple for Hedwig to eat when he returned home. The shopkeeper was a bit peeved with him for bringing such a dangerous animal inside his store but didn't turn him away as he was Harry Potter. This normally bothered harry but he supposed that it was all for the better this time otherwise there would be a lot of people lining up to kill his familiar.
Harry hadn't realized just how long he had been wandering until Hermione's patronus came and found him. Startled at the thought of how furious Mcgonagall would be if he was out this late the first night of school, he vanished the muggle radio with a wave of his hand and was about to run up to the castle when he had the thought that he should at least try to sell the illusion that he needed a wand. He picked up a broad branch that we could whittle into a wand and called out to Sidereum.
Harry returned to the common room positively beaming, while he recounted exactly what happened to his two best mates.
"I swear mate, you know your never going to eat that much candy but you get it anyway, you've done it since first year!" Ron laughed at how clueless Harry was even to his own appetite.
"Yes, Harry" he liked it when she called him Harry, it made him feel like just a normal person. "Of course I can explain this all to you, but first, I will need some help up and for you to show me the tattoo i'm sure you've already noticed"
"Let's go to the party now mate, I want to be blackout drunk as soon as possible" Harry said turning to Ron and adding a laugh at the end to try to play it off less serious.
"Uh, well his name is Sidereum and he's my familiar I guess." Harry was really hoping that Malfoy would turn up soon and he could escape the whole conversation under the pretense of class. And to his relief, that is exactly what happened.
"What do you reckon you'll do 'Mione, after you get your NEWT's, I think I'm still going to be an auror."
Draco had initially thought that Harry had only left for a minute but he hadn't returned even after Mcgonagall had announced that there was a new wing in the castle for the eight years and houses would be mixed to promote inter-house unity. After he didn't show up within the first couple hours that everyone had settled into the dormitories and Harry still hadn't shown up Draco decided to go looking for him. He wasn't sure why but he convinced himself it was just because he didn't want to loose house points on the first day because Potter was out of bed but in reality, he just had so many questions for Harry and he hoped he might just answer them without him having to ask. The first of which being why the hell Potter was in Slytherin all of a sudden, this sort of thing had never happened but of course the git couldn't go one year at Hogwarts without causing a scene. Rather grudgingly he started walking through the castle checking classrooms and empty hallways to no avail. After an hour of searching, Draco sat down at the lake waiting for a reply from Pansy as to whether or not Potter had shown up. When the reply came and Harry was still no where to be seen, Draco decided to cast a tracking spell but while he was trying to remember what the wand movement was, he heard
He panicked again when his arm brushed against something scaly he had forgotten was there. He tried to push it off, but to no avail.
Sorry I haven't gotten the third chapter up yet, its been a rough week and we have to put my dog down soon so i'm a bit distracted. I promise I am working on it but it's probably going to be another day or two. Im so super sorry and I really hope you guys still want to read this.
"Harry? have you picked out a name? You have been sitting there quietly for some time." Minerva was a bit concerned but hid it well.
They decided to go straight to the Great Hall and avoid as many people and memories as possible. They were the first students there, of course most of the teachers were already there and chatting away, they all sat down at the Gryffindor table and waited for people to start arriving. Harry cast some protection charms around him and Sidereum to avoid being hexed by startled peers at the fact that there was a giant snake perched on one of their classmates. Soon enough, people started pouring into the Great Hall and now all they were waiting for was the first years so that they could begin the sorting. Once Headmaster Mcgonagall had calmed everyone down and it was finally silent, Hagrid started to lead the first years inside. They were in the same line as always but there were a lot less than usual.
"What a beautiful feint Potter, you had Jared barreling into the ground face first, he hadn't even managed to get back on his broom by the time you caught the snitch." Draco had an arrogance in his tone but his eyes showed thankfulness to Harry for embarrassing the backstabbing prick much more than necessary.
"Harry! Stay very still, you have a Venenata snake coiled around you, i'm going to blast it off but you must remain calm!" Mcgonagall tried to cast an inferno charm but before she could, she was blasted backward in a wave of magic.
Harry loved that about the twins, either of them could take the most ridiculous or upsetting situation and make jokes about it. It helped a lot with everyone's recovery after the war. He wasn't sure where to begin, the surge of magic collapsing back in on him, maybe how Sidereum acted a lot like Draco. Draco, he thought about him a lot and it frustrated him to no end. Pushing all thoughts of Draco back into a box and burying it somewhere inside his mind he decided to start with the tattoo because everyone seemed to be so fascinated by it. He had worn a short sleeved muggle shirt under his robes for this exact reason. His friends were so predictable with what fascinated them. He chuckled to himself and shrugged off his robes to reveal the tattoo, still as vibrant and full of life as it had been when it first appeared. After a few very long seconds and some audible gasps from his friends and people watching near them, Harry put his robes back on and explained what the different tattoo's signified. Hermione already knew all of this of course but she pretended to be fascinated for the sake of the others.
He stared at the egg bewildered and albeit a little curious and he started to crawl toward it. He started hissing back at the egg and the words felt wrong in his mouth. 'Parseltongue, of course this had to be a snake'
"Merlin you have no idea how long I've wanted to- I mean... gods Draco you're just and it was so- Hogsmeade?"
"I got your coffee Harry, we should leave for class in the next couple minutes though if you don't want to be- ah, I see you've met Jared." Malfoy's faced had twisted into a disgusted grimace.
"Okay okay 'Mione, I get it I shouldn't get that drunk." Harry was laughing at the realization of just how awful he could be while intoxicated.
"WAIT! You have a mental bond with him? Harry this is crazy hold on give me one second I have to write all of this down, this means you must have a First Degree bond, oh I must get pictures of your tattoo Harry. I wonder if you can-"
Many things have changed at Hogwarts, however Quidditch games and Gryffindor spirit are not among those.
He had been hovering for a while and Slytherin was up 70 to 20. His eyes had been scanning the pitch for thirty minutes and he was beginning to get a bit bored, he decided he was going to spice things up a bit. He shot straight into a nose dive going headfirst into the ground as fast as he could and made sure Jared was following him closely, he then leveled out his broom at the last second while Jared rammed into the ground. The Wronski Feint as many people called it, he had been doing it since he first got on a broom though and while many people considered it to be one of the most difficult moves in Quidditch history, it was Harry's favourite and most used move as it was easiest for him.
"What in the bloody hell are you doing in my room Potter?!" Harry was still looking out the window and thinking about the time he rode Buckbeak over the lake past the mountains, he was so happy then.
The snake seemed to say this in an irritated tone, but wouldn't Harry be able to tell? It was speaking out loud wasn't it?
"For today's match, Slytherin versus Ravenclaw!" There was a new commentator this year that Harry didn't know the name of but he thought it was something like Theseus.
I'm super sorry this chapter took so long to get out, I've been dealing with a lot and my school it starting up soon. Kudos and Comments are still open though! I should be updating more regularly though and I hope some of you are still interested in reading. Thank you so much for your patience and I hope you all liked this chapter.<3 We had to put my dog down and this isn't very long but I figured I'd give you something to read, a full length chapter should be up tomorrow.
He walked directly over to Harry after seeing him walk in. He was fascinated by the fact that there was a large snake curled around his figure and Harry was acting like it was the most normal thing in the world. Putting that aside for the moment however, he held his hand out and hoped for the best.
"Oh, you have the same schedule as me, I can just go with you to classes so you aren't berated by your adoring fans. And before you ask, no Mcgongall does not know why you switched houses and I know your classes because she told me we had identical schedules when you failed to be present at the end of dinner."
With that, Draco left with his light leaves. Leaving a very confused but happy Harry behind him. He was standing in the same spot when his friends returned saying they would see him at King's Cross in a week.
"I don't know why you're helping me but thank you. Also uh, I don't know my schedule, do you know where I could find that?"
They snuck some treacle tart from the kitchens after that to celebrate and then started on their homework after very persistent nagging from Hermione. That night, Harry and Draco met up in the Room of Requirement and talked for hours until they had to get changed for breakfast, they had never been more happy with anything they had ever done since they started coming to Hogwarts.
Harry, Hermione and Ron went to lunch and he decided to let them in on his plan while they were eating.
"OH!, oh yes of course he must have been talking about you, your the one who's going to explain this I reckon." Harry was talking very fast while his face flushed at the rather obvious conclusion he had just come to.
"Harry Potter you get you're arse up to the dormitories this very moment! Ron and I can't find you and we are freaking out! If you aren't here in ten minutes we are going to get Mcgonagall to help track you down!"
She was stunned into silence when she had walked into Harry's room to find him sitting on his bed, completely calm with one of the deadliest snakes known to wizard kind.
"But 'Mione, we've got it with the Slytherin's and I can't listen to Draco mumbling my name under his breath every time he messes something up! It's just too damn attractive. It makes me want to snog th-"
Eventually, he realized he had been staring for far longer than necessary and he hid behind a bush thinking of how to let Harry know where the dorms were without ruining this one place he had found that gave him peace, they had been arch enemies for years but Draco wasn't a monster. Luckily, an otter patronus showed up and started speaking in Granger's voice.
He thought about it a lot as he finished his letters to his friends. Once he had finished with his atrocious writing, he turned to Hedwig, she had been injured when they left for the Burrow but had recovered quickly thankfully. He gave her some treats so she would take the letters because she had been upset when Harry didn't tend to her all day as he usually did in lieu of having anything else to do.
told him that he shrieks which in itself was embarassing. After that Harry had said he was going to go to breakfast and in his panic he had said something about Potter being a slob but rather than retaliating with a bitter remark like he thought Harry would, but instead he just said something about nobody caring and he just sounded so
"Alright lads, I think it's Blaise's turn to give the pep talk" Harry said adding a dramatic sigh at the end.
"Mate I know you probably don't want to go but just in case, I figured I'd let you know that Blaise is sneaking in fire whiskey." Ron looked like he was trying to be supportive but Harry didn't care, alcohol was all he needed to hear, forgetting about everything for at least one night was exactly what he wanted right now.
Harry was a bit nervous about not having classes with Ron and Hermione anymore so he asked, well more accurately, stumbled over words for what felt like forever before Malfoy put him out of his misery and laughed while he told him it was fine if Harry sat with him so long as he helped him because Draco was absolute rubbish at the subject.
"Harry, sometimes you really do baffle me. I only made you read about the entire library at Hogwarts and you still haven't figured it out. These specific snakes are not black, once they bond with you they turn the color of whatever you love most in the world, and I'm assuming you can't see because you're blind as a bat even with your glasses but he has white dots all over his scales. I couldn't tell you for sure but it looks a bit like the night sky." Hermione managed to get through her whole speech with no real insults but of course Harry still acted mock offended.
There was a deafening pop right as he was about to fall asleep and Harry dropped the book on his own face. "Ow!" he started rubbing his forehead a little too vigorously and it left a red mark. He got up from his bed after adequate over exaggerated huffing and stumbled backwards when he was greeted by a rather large midnight blue egg hissing at him. He panicked and scrambled back into the re-barred window hitting his head for the second time which made him very frustrated.
"Oh yeah definitely, unless Blaise cancels the entire party there's no way you can keep me from drinking my weight in firewhiskey."
"Malfoy, I just became the first person in the history of ever to be transferred out of their house, I sincerely doubt that anyone will care what I'm wearing."
This didn't have to be Draco's problem after all, he did find it a bit odd that Granger's patronus was an otter of all things though. Draco accio-ed his broom after trying to walk and remembering just how much he had walked in the last hour and flew back up to his dormitory. Pansy started questioning him the moment he walked through the portrait hole and he settled on just telling her that he had seen Granger and Weasley looking and figured they would find him faster. He announced that he was tired and going to head to bed to avoid the rest of the questions he knew Pansy would have. Having no where else he could really disappear he settled for actually looking for his luggage with was supposed to be outside of his room. It took a while to find because it was pretty high up in the dorms but he was happy, it meant that he could look down on the grounds if he ever wanted to, which he did pretty frequently. It looked like he would be rooming with a Ravenclaw a Hufflepuff and another Slytherin, he wasn't sure who though because he didn't recognize the luggage. He changed into his emerald green silk pajamas and hopped into his bed, he fell asleep pretty quickly nestled under his silver and green covers.
Something in Harry didn't feel quite as alone anymore, he felt safe and he thought that even though so many things had gone wrong, this one could go right for him.
After the incident of last years 'Potter Stinks' badges, Draco had become a school wide joke. Everyone had started teasing him about it once Cedric had spoken out against them himself. It was all in good fun and after the first couple weeks even Draco had started laughing along with the joke however, it was his sole purpose after that to make sure that Harry didn't ever find out about it. He had managed to do so well, or so he thought.
Lavender cut through his thoughts like a knife "we've been here for some time and" yup, her voice still unsettled him relentlessly "it seems we've finished with our food, what do you say we get to shopping?" A chorus of yeses erupted from the table so they left a hefty sum of money and left the shop.
"Wow just, bloody hell that's a lot, um am I supposed to be doing something? I feel like I should be freaking out but I'm just very overwhelmed I guess." he sat there for a moment stunned and a bit eager to see just how powerful he was, but also a but afraid that he might not be able to handle it all.
"Oh! Yes of course sorry professor i was talking to Sidereum, yes, that sounds right I think that will be his name" his smile was so genuine it made Minerva's heart ache a little, she hadn't seen him happy in so long.
"I'm sorry, for everything. For bullying you and your friends for years. For being too much of a coward to leave my good for nothing father to deal with his own mistakes and for being on the wrong side of the war. While I'm not saying what I did was right, I hope that you can understand that I only acted out of fear for my own and my mother's life and even though that is the case, I do still regret my decisions. I also never got the chance to thank you for speaking up at my mother's and my own trial, it meant a lot that even after everything I did, you still defended me," That was probably the most heartfelt apology he had ever heard and he was a bit confused. Draco had been running his fingers through his hair the whole time looking very nervous about it all but his voice was as steady as ever.
He immediately felt bad for Potter and told him to just shower and get dressed or something like that. He had been panicking most of the conversation at the fact that he was going to be living in the same room and bloody Harry Potter for the rest of the year. It did however have one benefit, the two were taking the same classes and if since Draco managed to convince Harry to walk with him to classes, he wouldn't be so constantly hexed in the hallways for his part in the war. He was extremely grateful for his planning ahead when he realized just
"Okay okay! Just walk faster you arse." Hermione was mad enough at this point that Harry complied and started walking uncomfortably fast down the hall to class.
He went to get back to surveillance height when he spotted it, he saw the actual snitch. He darted after it and started to do intricate twists and turns to keep Jared from following him just in case he had recovered from his face-five with the ground. After a couple of minutes, he managed to snatch it out of the air but not before Ginny had scored several more goals with the help of their teammates.
"There are WHAT? You mean to tell me that I have been desperately trying to burn all of these things into my mind permanently since First year and there was a spell I could use to help?!" Draco looked positively livid that he had been deprived of this for so many years.
"The only thing I can't figure out is why he's indigo, I thought they were normally black" Harry had consulted as many books as he could, he even asked Sidereum about it but he hadn't managed to find an answer. He had hoped it was in one of his past memories which Sidereum could view and see exactly what it was Harry had read which had made harry ecstatic because he would never have to fail tests again, but there were still no answers to be found.
"Oh, yeah sorry about that, he kinds refuses to leave my side." He was surprised the boy didn't remember the snake from last night.
"Harry! What have I told you about those, it scared me for you they really are dangerous no matter how many times you do them. Please do be more careful next time but congratulations on winning the match!" Hermione tried her best to look upset but even Harry could tell how excited she was that he had something to be happy about again even if she was disappointed that Gryffindor had lost the best seeker in a century.
"Calm down Harry I have as much time as you need to answer your questions, for starters, a third Degree bond with a familiar is represented by a non-moving black tattoo that stays around the area of your wrist, the specific bond is quite common and while they don't share a mental bond, it does boost the magic of the wizard a little. A Second Degree bond is what Voldemort and Nagini had, it is signified by a black non-moving elbow length tattoo, they can speak telepathically and the bond exponentially increases their capacity for magic, those are less common but tend to be quite predictable. First Degree bonds however are exceedingly rare and often differ in what effects they may have on the wizard and animal, their tattoos are arm length very colourful and they tend to appear as if they are moving. Yours appears to be a particularly strong one Harry. While we do not know the full effects this may have on you I can say for sure that you share a full mental bond with Sidereum here and you can not only communicate telepathically but you both have complete access to the other's mind."
"September 1st! A beautiful day, I hope to never see you again boy! Pack up your things, you better be gone in the next hour." Vernon screamed from the kitchen. He always got excited on the day Harry left.
"Harry! You really must hurry up we're going to be late for Transfiguration again, Mcgonagall will give you detention if you show up late."
"Well I mean, you will still have to at least try to retain the information but it will help you recall it and it will make you memorize it faster. You aren't permitted to use the charm during exams and stuff but it helps you get the information stuck up in your brain much faster."
Draco woke up and got changed not bothering to look at who the rest of his roommates after he spotted Jared. Jared had been one of the people who had hated Draco from the very beginning. Even before he was a death eater, Jared would bully and hex him on sight and with how often he got out of it, Draco was personally surprised he wasn't in Slytherin. He took his time in the shower and spent a good hour on his hair. He was about to head down to breakfast when he spotted Potter. 'What in the bloody hell is Potter doing in my room'. He didn't think he had said anything but apparently he had because Potter had responded,
"I understand Minnie and I'm perfectly fine to hold out on testing my abilities until the consequences can be controlled" he chuckled at himself when he imitated her tone of voice and absurdly sophisticated wording.
"Can you teach it to me? I know it isn't Transfiguration and that wasn't part of the deal but it would really help if you did." Malfoy looked so desperate to get any edge that he could on this subject and it made Harry just a little bit sad for him.
"Uh, well it definitely isn't- alright fine Potter you win, don't think I won't get you back though."
Harry took the trains all the way back home and he felt surprisingly okay for the first time since the war and he was very excited about his last year at Hogwarts.
"Regardless I'm not having a fellow Slytherin wearing that to the Great Hall, I'll get you your coffee and something to eat but I insist you shower and change before classes." Harry was very surprised at Malfoy's willingness to help him but he also didn't want to deal with all the stares and Hermione and Ron's concerned faces when he turned up to breakfast with bags under his eyes.
"You cannot be doing that in class Potter, it's already hard enough restrain myself from snogging you to begin with, Merlin!" Draco's face was bright red and his eyes were full of want and Harry hadn't found a single thing more attractive than that in his life.
They had arrived at Hogwarts pretty soon and got off the train as quickly as possible so they could feed the Thestrals. They technically weren't supposed to but they couldn't help it, all of them could see the fascinating creatures now and Hermione had been researching the best food for the Thestrals and she wanted to see how they liked her odd bunches of herbs and spiced raw meat. Harry was always hesitant to see the creatures but he was glad to have escaped the stares from his classmates.
"Harry Potter has caught the snitch! Slytherin has won 240 to 50" Theseus bellowed, sounding very excited but you could tell it was at least a little bit forced.
Without thinking it through at all, he swung Draco around against the wall and smashed his lips on the blond's. He started panicking and started to pull away but then, Draco deepened the kiss and pulled him back in by the waist. After what seemed like forever and no time at all, they finally broke apart for air. They both just stared at each other with awe for a while not quite knowing what to say.
"Yeah, it would be nice to stop going at each other's throats constantly eh?" Draco chuckled at his own remark and gave Harry a half-hearted smile. While Harry was looking at Draco he saw the clock.
"I think we missed the trolley witch, I'm going to go see if I can find her." Ron looked a bit confused but Hermione gave him an understanding nod. He had decided to just walk through the compartments for a bit to cool down because he really didn't have anywhere he could really go. It was pretty uneventful and people mostly left him alone but the stares were still awful so he decided to really go looking for the trolley witch. He found her pretty quickly and he got some pumpkin pasties and Bertie Botts every flavor beans. He got back to his compartment to find Ron and Lavender deep in a conversation he wish he could unhear and Hermione was reading a book looking very uncomfortable by the window.
"He's your... I'm sorry but what in the bloody hell is going on?" They seemed to have connected the dots that it was the same snake from last night and know they just looked exasperated.
Harry gave a nod to Draco and thanked them both right as both Ginny and Ron came up beside them. Ron sneered at Draco decided to leave it be for now.
Potter grabbed his wand and let his snake climb onto his shoulders and then stormed out of the room looking just about as furious as Draco had seen him when he was literally facing against Voldemort. He would be lying if he said it didn't scare him a bit. Harry visibly stopped looking so mad though once they had started walking and that comforted Draco a bit.
"Yes Harry, but I do insist that we work on your grammar, I mean of course it won't matter around me because I'm stunning but-"
"Sorry about how I acted at the twin's shop, I was a bit surprised and I've never been any good with confrontation."
"I think I want to become the DADA professor, I really enjoyed teaching the DA and I don't want to be an auror but it's still my favourite subject in school." Harry hadn't even thought that was a possibility and was surprised by his own sudden decisiveness.
"Hey! I do not get that flustered!" Harry protested but it only made his face go multiple shades of red darker.
Harry started to push on the outside until he remembered that this specific egg belonged to the Venenata snake which is the second deadly magical snake in the world, after the basilisk of course. But then again, he was talking to the egg so in one fell swoop of recklessness, he punched the egg open and was immediately thrown into his wall by a powerful burst of magic. His head was pounding and his vision was fuzzy because his glasses had been blown off, and they broke yet again. The snake was slithering toward him and he started to panic, he kept screaming to himself in his head, the snake started slithering around harry, working its way up his body to rest on his shoulders. Once the snake had settled there was a burst of magic that exploded outwards in a wave that immediately surged back into his own body, his face felt like it was on fire and he was momentarily unaware of the snake that had perched itself on his shoulders. His attention was currently held by the tattoo that had suddenly appeared all the way down the length of his right arm. It was vibrant and full of colours and seemed to be,
of trying to create an army of inferies and kidnapping muggle children. One of the worst missions Rose had ever done in her life to this day. The few good thing coming out of this whole ordeal had been the arrest of the fool, the eradication of what could possibly have been the start of a zombie apocalypse and the friendship between Rose and Alexander. Inferieâs bites were not contagious; however, the idiot had managed to make his corpseâs bites infectious and had botched up the control matrix that allowed him to control his creations. It was stuff of nightmares.
. Here is the paperwork and the contract to take care of young Hadrian. Like I said, I will need a report every fortnight to make sure of the state of Hadrian's developement and well-bieng. I will come once a month, randomly unannounced, to see for myself the progress going on. I will speak privately with youg Hadrian and what he tells me will be confidential. I want to make sure that there is no loopholes or possibilities for the Brittish Ministry of Magic to take young Hadrian from us. ''
âHonestly, Ron! We are here to welcome the BeauxbÃ¢tons and Durmstrang delegations! Didn't you here what Professor McGonagall said? Now, stop whinning and stand up straight, we are Head Boy and Head Girl. We need to give a good example for the younger years!â snapped Hermione Granger, never realising that no one was looking at the two of them as models.
Rose refused to pay for the entirety of the funeral and wanted to have a smaller, more intimate ceremony. This was a funeral of their common nephew's parents, not a Las Vegas show! In the end, everything was settled by Grunnings company policy that provided funds for the funeral.
Petunia believed that Rose should found herself a husband a quit this silly business of a job; the bitter older sister thought that women should be satisfied with a house, a husband and kids. She honestly could not understand her sister's ambitions to be more than housewives and mothers. Rose could not understand why, with all the brain that Petunia had, she would settle with less than what she could be.
The rest of the room just looked incredulously at the old man. They could not believe how rude and improper he was being towards the visiting school. He was putting their international reputation is danger. It was already in the crap-hole with Bagnold and Fudge screw-ups; they did not need more bad press. If any of the international newspapers even catch wind of what had happened here tonight, they would be lynching the Ministry.
The boys kept in contact through letters and photos throughtout the years, much to Marjorie's dispair. Despite the fat woman's nasty comments and sneers, Rose always received Dudley and Marjorie two weeks every summers and one week during Christmast to see her only other nephew. Just like Harry, Rose wrote letters, called on the phone and sent gifts and photos to Dudley throughout the year. They were not as close as they could have been, but Dudley never felt abandonned by his mother's family; after all, if Vernon and Petunia hadn't already stated that their son's guardianship was to go to Vernon's sister in case of their demise, Rose would have taken Dudley in no matter what. So Rose and Harry kept in touch with Dudley and grew a small relationship together.
If Granger's nagging and condescending attitudes or Weasley's laziness and poor manners didn't alienate them from everyone in school, then their bigotry, their bullying ways and their loud screeching did the trick. The professors were actually counting down the days where they would no longer have to deal with thoses two. Snape had promised himself to get smashing drunk and visit the most high-end brothel in Knockturn Alley to celebrate. Flitwick had swore to take up a sword and enter the Pit (an colleseum-like arena where goblins duelled and settled dispute) to finally release the pent-up fury and anger that stewed and was rotting inside of him. Sprout had declared that she was going to Hawaii as she always had dreamed of; she figured that she had deserved it, just for putting up with the meltdown and tears of her badgers for seven years due to the redhead's constant bullying and never being able to do anything about it. McGonagall... She did not care what people say, what people thought or about anyone else... She was going to retire, period! She had had enough of this! No more!
The blond was rounding the corner by the time she caught sight of him, and Hermione broke into a run. She caught up with Malfoy half way to the dungeons. Out of breath and irritated, she grabbed his arm and yanked, effectively halting him in place. He rounded on her, knowing full well who'd been following him, that hateful sneer he'd obviously perfected on his face.
"âknow what she told me? Said she can't tell the difference, people treat her just the same. I'm just one more example of how mad she is, according to them all. Simply because she believes a few strange things, honestly."
Harry gave a somewhat reluctant nod, while Malfoy did nothing. His grey eyes were careful, assessing.
Harry went completely still. In his mind, Harimâs low whistle echoed, and went determinedly unacknowledged.
âHermione,â he said. âThatâs the last thing that matters and you know it. I mean, gods, they thought Harry and I were crazy; we were
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Your House changes its collective mind at the drop of a dime. Give it a couple days and it'll be fine."
It turned out he wasnât hard to find. As suspected, he still looked a lot like Harry himself. He was probably fifteen or so now, and looked it. He was smiling widely, confidently. And he was very obviously imparting his team with one last pep talk. Probably captain, then. Harry felt a surge of prideâas if he was at all involved in that, he chided himself.
thing to do, and Draco clearly thought so too if the amusement in his slate eyes was any indication. He didnât comment, though, only waited.
Malfoy made a pleased sound that seemed involuntary and Harry nearly shivered. He discovered that Malfoy smelled like peppermint and vanilla and iceâif ice were to have a smell. It was a strange combination that Harry would never have thought pleasant before then. As it was, he was currently resisting the ridiculous urge to nuzzle Malfoy's neck and breathe in deeply.
Hey guys! Weâre almost done! I have to admit at this point that there was actually a lot more memory scenes I really wanted to includeâin this chapter but also just in the fic overall. I had so so many in mind and so I had to decide what to and what to not include to prevent it all from being overstuffed with them.
Neville swallowed. âWhat can I really do, though?â he eventually asked. âYou lotâ er I mean, Skeeterâs people are vultures. I canât just stop seeing him. Do you reckon I ought to get out in front of it?â
âMiss Granger is right, Albus,â said McGonagall. âWe have no means of knowing the nature of Voldemortâs plan. I have to insist that Potter be kept as far away as possible.â
"Fantastic," Draco bit out once he recovered. "Now I'll have to show up alone while Potter'll have a date."
Harry made a noncommittal noise, hoping that Draco would let the topic drop. But he had no such luck.
Draco looked at him, surely unimpressed by his reaction. âHardly. She got revenge for the potential blood heirs she lost. She punished him for daring to think his children were his own pawns instead of hers.â
He was in the hall a few minutes later when the statue moved aside again to let someone else out. There wasnât time to even guess who it would be before his father was looking down at him.
the nature of your original relationship with Draco Malfoy,â sheâd asked bluntly, âin your past life?â
"Regardless," said Severus. "Draco is old enough to make his own decisions and live with the consequences."
Harry smiled gratefully. Parvati seemed like she was a good friend. Harry felt a pang of regret about his sort of writing her off.
Harry took a breath. He recognised that even if he didnât understand, there was really only one way this could go. All he could do was be honest about his intentions, even if he couldnât be honest about anything else. âIâm not going to hurt him,â he promised solemnly. âI meant what I told him and I plan to keep my word. Things are going to be different from now on, alright? Iâm going to quit my job at the
Harryâs eyes widened of their own volition, and Malfoy looked triumphant. âWe hardly exist in comparison to them. If we are discovered again, and itâs not caught in time, do you realise how fast we could die off? All it takes is a few failures in quick succession, and itâs the end times. We canât
âHere you are,â said the now triumphant voice a moment later, followed by the sound of dragging feet and protest. Draco did not need to have seen to understand that Not Harry had given his position away on purpose, just as the woman to Dracoâs right had wanted, and was now playing the part of the trapped victim.
She turned to face him again slowly, eyes slitted. âWhat does that have to do withââ she broke off. Her eyes widened at the same moment comprehension occurred. â
, Harry thought. Snape made his way over to Neville and began his usual tirade, made that much more severe by the horribly destroyed potion in front of the boy. "You are an embarrassment, Longbottom," Harry heard the greasy man say at one point, just after he'd taken another twenty five points from Gryffindor House, and Neville just accepted the complete tongue-lashing stoically. Or more like he was used to it. Harry gritted his teeth and, just when Snape had
Itâs actually finished. Weâre at the end. Honestly guys, I debated about this epilogue. I could have wrote like 10, 15 years in the future and talked about Drarryâs gaggle of adopted kids and Pansy+Reg and Ophelia being a Weasley and Amjad being a mind healer and Ayesha being, like, Minister and Neville, man you guys know heâs gonna be a superstar and Harry is gonna have to learn social media when 2009 rolls around and like God just so many things in my mind. But thatâs what it comes down to is that I really could honestly keep writing in this little AU I made forever and ever. I could write endless chapters about my precious OCs and altered!characters and odd pairings (we all know theyâre odd, itâs part of the fun lol) and everything else. It could be endless. Which is why it had to end. Because this story was for Harryâwho I deeply love and this whole fic was almost like my ode to that love if Iâm being honestâand this particular segment of his life, and it had come to its natural close. I have had so, so much fun in the year and a half Iâve been working on and the 13 months Iâve been writing and posting this fic. I canât even wrap my mind around the fact that itâs over. So first and foremost thank you to H, who dutifully read every chapter of this HUGELY LONG ficâit was never supposed to be this long. Iâm sorry. I love you. Also to S, thank you so much for your boundless patience with me texting you incessantly like âwhat does this mean?â âHow do you say [insert thing I want said]â âwhatâs a good name for someone [insert age]â and so on and so forth. Lord, so sorry. Thank you. And thank you of course to every single person who read this ficâespecially the ones who commented and/or subscribed to it or to me. The fact that this is marked as complete now is because of you guys. I hope all of you who read and who will read this had as much of an absolute blast as I did. I really set out to write something I wanted to read and it means so much to me that all you guys wanted to read it, too. Also side note real quick: please feel free to let me know in the comments if:  I should add any applicable tags to this fic (Iâm terrible at tagging, truly) or you notice any (easily fixable) mistakes. Phew, I think thatâs everything. I want to post another fic in the future really a lot. I so hope that reading more Drarry from me is something some of you guys would want because, well, letâs just say I already have a few plans. <3 - B
Harry released a breath and propped himself up awkwardly so he could meet Dracoâs eyes. âNo, tell me what you were going to say.â
Polyjuice tasted awful, just as it had the one other time Harry had taken it. He watched in fascination as the Auror in front of him slowly took on his features, shrinking while Harry himself gained several inches.
That night, Harry returned to his flat. He sat on his plush lounge chair, staring off into the middle distance for a long while, before he stood and exited through the floo.
She broke off, seeming to register for the first time that Draco wasnât by himself. Jacqueline tapped her foot impatiently behind her.
Hermione broke off, staring down at the hand she could of sworn had just squeezed hers. For a moment, she held her breath. Then Dracoâs hand moved again, and her eyes snapped back to his face.
Harry blinked at his Headmaster. âAnd Crouch Sr. knew didnât he? That was why heâd been acting so strange ever since the World Cup, isnât it?â
âLook,â she went on patiently, âwhat say we go back to yours and talk things out. I could go for some tea about now.â
âYou know, we used to be friends,â Neville said wistfully. âMe and the guys. They welcomed me right in, just after Iâd finished Hogwarts. Said with me at the mic, theyâd finally make it big.â
Draco stood for a moment in something like awe. Yes, he believed he was friends with Weasley. Ron Weasley. When had that happened? But then the ginger haired boy came back out, a shimmering ball of fabric in his grasp, and Draco refocused on what was at hand.
The carpet was comfortable, Harry thought, fingers brushing minutely through the coloured wool. He was currently lying on Nevilleâs carpet, languid, eyes fixed on just one of the framed vinyl records hung high on the singerâs bedroom walls.
Harry thought, unbidden, and then nearly stumbled over his own feet because he had no idea where thatâd come from. Draco Malfoy certainly was not
At that, she was abruptly shushed by Madam Pince, but for once the chastisement hardly mattered. "That's genius!" She exclaimed in a whisper this time. "Neville helped I take it?"
The woman shook her just so, enough to show that she was at just as much of a loss. âI havenât the faintest. I thought one of us would have been attacked by now.â
âIt... none of that matters now. I forgive you, youâve been through enough,â he said. âWe both have, yeah?â
âMy jobâs done,â Harry answered back, perhaps a bit shaky. âIâm gonna watch with you if thatâs alright.â
In the morning, Harry would put aside his nerves and write to Sirius. He would tell Draco about everything that had happened, likely endure his boyfriend chastising him about attempting to investigate in the first place, and then theyâd both work out what to do from there. But for tonight, Harry would put everything out of his mind and fall asleep in Dracoâs arms.
Dracoâs eyes sharpened, and Harry was filled with the disconcerting notion that Draco could see right through him. That the blond somehow, inconceivably, would have a sense what those words meant to Harry.
in his head. And they were talking to him. Threatening him. It was like a long-ago nightmare had resurfaced and then come to life in its vengeance.
Draco stood silently, not so much as flinching. Severus suspected he might not be listening at all. He also strongly doubted Draco had need to experiment. Despite his anger the previous night, Severus had not been the least bit surprised when Draco's homosexuality was confirmed. It was only that Draco's affections belonged to Potter of all people that turned Severus's stomach. Though even that perhaps should not of been a surprise. Lucius, though, had yet to even address Potter's involvement.
The next minute, Dracoâs parents were stepping out of the fireplace. There was a silent, stretched out moment in which everyone eyed each other. Or, a moment in which Draco looked at anyone besides his father.
Those green eyes rolled, but immediately softened. "I'm sorry, about what he said I mean. It isn't true, you know."
Harry groused, mimicking the old directorâs overly stressed accent. âI canât even begin to imagine the reaction thatâs going to get. Alfie came up with Catatonic Howlers back in the day, heâs going to be upset and probably blame me. I can already hear it now. âEverything was fine until
"CLOSE IT CLOSE IT BLOODY CLOSE IT!!" Draco hollered, his voice barely carrying over the gods awful screeching emanating from the egg.
"Wouldn't say that," Neville replied. "We did lose quite a lot of points for Gryffindor. No one's all that happy with us right now."
All Harry really wanted now was for Draco to look at him again. Not just a glance or anything like he did when required. No, Harry wanted Draco to look at
something more to learn.â She paused, shrugged. âBut Time had called to me as much as the Mind had those years before, and so I simply made the transition. For years, I was renewed. No longer bored; there was a world of knowledge at my feet all over again. Somewhat recently, though, Iâd begun to feel that perhaps Iâd exhausted myself with Time, also. Except thatâ¦ well. There was a puzzle piece that was missing, is the only way I can explain it. There was something I didnât know, so I stayed. To be frank, I was not even certain how to approach leaving, either. Itâs virtually unheard of to retire so young as I am.â
âYou said weâre gods compared to them,â Harry said. âWhy? Why are we so much more deserving of life than them?â
Harry stood completely still, cheeks flooding red with the mortification of immediate understanding.
Draco likely had his evening planned already, with an abundance of friends and acquaintances who were unlikely to think very highly of Harryâfor various reasons.
He couldn't quite keep up with the range of emotion on Harry's face. But then the brunet said, "That's a really good thing, because I love you too. I would have said it earlier, but I thought it deserved a bit more privacy than we had at that moment, not to mention time for me to snog you properly."
Neville sighed, but didnât back down. In the past, Hermione thought he would haveâor likely would have never said what he had in the first place. But Nevilleâs confidence had increased ever since Blaise snapped his wand in half accidentally (on purpose). Hermione had her theories, but they werenât important just then.
âGlad to hear it,â the man said, setting his things on his desk and turning to the rest of the class with a smile of his own. âGood morning students. I figured we could use a more laid back day, today, so Iâm sure everyone can guess what weâre talking about?â
Harry gave her a grateful look. âIâve got Transfiguration first, with professor Siskin. History with Hanson, second. Then Magical Creatures with Clark right before lunch.â
Luciusâs eyebrows crinkled in anger and confusion. âOf course the boy will have to die, you must see that the Dark Lord will not stand for him to live.â
Pansy sighed. "You just need to go about it the right way, love. Despite what you believe, Potter looks at you the same as you look at him."
âAnd I imagine you, specifically, were at least somewhat looked after by Dumbledore. But thatâs just it. Take Granger, for instance. What if her parents had been god-fearing preachers or some such nonsense, and she started presenting magic. What if they didnât love her enough, didnât love her more than they were afraid of her âdevilâs gift.â If our kind is lucky, they catch these people in time. If not, more muggles find out. Whoops, itâs made the town paper. This day and age? Soon news stations are talking. You can only obliviate so many people before itâs a lost cause, after all. Have you ever thought about how few wizards there are in comparison to them? Let me give you an idea. The pamphlet says that about twenty-five hundred students come here annually, right?â
son,â she hissed. âAnd he has loved Harry Potter in some way or the other since he stepped foot in that robe shop, you cannot act as though you donât know it as well as I with how he spoke. If you gave a damn about your son, Lucius, your
Weird time to post, maybe. But honestly as soon as I got the go-ahead from my beta I just wanted this up. So here it is! *hides*
This time Malfoy rolled his eyes at him. âYes, a mudblood with no magic,â he said bluntly. âIâm almost certain thereâs a word for that, must be escaping my mind.â
After so much silence, Lavender spoke quietly. âI canât remember the last time you kept secrets from me.â
Maria made a noise like a bomb going off, complete with hand gesture. âMass panic. If you think itâs strict around here now, you got no idea. Shit was like a prison back then.â
Harry nodded mutely, his heart was beating almost uncomfortably fast now. His mind was struggling to keep up with everything Malfoy had just told him.
Hermione cocked her head to the side, it looked a bit bird-like in Harry's opinion. "Then what was the point?"
âDefinitely not worth it,â agreed Cosima, joining the conversation without missing a beat as she slid through to sit on the other side of Malfoy. âDamn, even more of a turn out than last year.â
There was a short silence, and Lavender set her jaw. âThatâs it?â she demanded. At his blank look, she let out a sharp, exasperated breath. âIâm gonna need a little more than your half-cocked, vague as hell apology, Harry. What are you even sorry for, huh?â
She startled, whirling around to face him. Her wand in her hand and pointed at him almost as fast as any Auror heâd seen. âBloody hell!â
And despite the storm this would mean, Harry smiled, even as it occurred to him how much easier it was to know what to do regarding someone elseâs issues.
the cutting spell. Now this spell can cut through many things, from tissues for the seamstress to a tree for the lumberjack; and that is it. At Durmstrang, you will learn it's darker cousin
Distraught at their son's pain and sorrow, Lucius and Narcissa, despite not caring much for their son's friends (and that's putting it midly), had called them forth and asked for their help in getting their Dragon out of his depression. It took all summer to cheer him up and it was only the thought of facing the entire school once September arrived that forced Draco to put on his Pureblood mask. The Malfoy family was strong and cowered under no pressure; he would not allow himself to be seen as a poor, weak and broken soul over some stupid cad who sucked in bed.
Yet, all this animosity between the two of the sisters was thrown out of the window on the morning of the
'' attitude, there is war between their houses, muggleborns are insulted and bullied with little to no help at all from the staff and the student's NEWTs results are abysmal compared to any other school in the ICW. Hogwarts may have been the greatest school in the world at one point, but now it is a joke. They rank 11
His uncle Alexander had started to get involved in the school when a very unaccetable candidate for the Headmistress post (Beauxbaton always had a woman at the helm of the school); a known creature and being hater! Of all things! It was rumored that her husband had secretely been financing Lord Voldemort during his reign of terror. The woman had such horrid plans for the school; starting by limiting the number of students with veela blood into the school and segregating them along with the half-bloods and the muggleborns from the ''pure'' students. Alexander Vaux De Villiers never could stand the couple in high society, but the very idea of letting such a vile woman in the school or on the Board of Governers..? Not a chance in Hell! He had backed up Madam Maxime, stating her numerous years dedicaded to helping all students no matter what; from failling grades to bullying problems, from pregnant students to abused children (from parents or teachers)... Madam Maxime was there and ready to fight for those who needed. She took care of the school for half of her predecessor's tenure. Who better than this fine woman could watch over the next generation of witches and wizards of France? Madam Maxime won unanimously and the school has never been better because of it. Yet, Harry did not feel like going to Beauxbaton; it was too genteel for his tastes. He needed a school with a good duelling and runes program.
Her door bell rang to announce a visitor. Expecting to see Petunia at her door to welcome her into the neighborhood, however, it wasn't. Instead, it was Miss number 5 Privet Drive. She brought a casserole and offered her the last new gossip on the street. According to her, Petunia and her family left for America after her husband received a promotion and the family left in less than three days later. It was all strange and rather suspicious as everyone knew that Vernon was an asbismal employee at his job and there was no way that he could have a promotion. So it was everyone's guess as to why the Dursleys left so fast. Obviously something scandalous.
The old man tried to leave but the Hogwart champion, who had been all but forgotten by his own headmaster called out to him. Telling him that if he dared to disobey the orders of the Minister and ruin Great Britainâs reputation any further, then the Light Party was going to lose the Longbottom seat and Great Britain one of his oldest and most noble House. For Neville Franklin Longbottom will not have his House allied or associated with a man who would gladly destroy his own country. Speechless, the old man could do nothing as his own champion, his own student; his pawn passed by him and refused to look at him.
Only three hours in and Hogwarts as a whole did not give off the best of image of themselves. Between the stares, whispers, the undiscipline of the students and the way the teachers were acting towards the students was not endearing Harry at all to the British.
''I think I made my choice. I'll go to Durmstrang! I'll learn what I need to know and do my best. Thanks for being there for me!'' said the little boy as he hugged his uncle almost to death.
Draco hoped that his voice never betrayed just how startled the other man made him when he asked about his friend dancing with Lilianne. Judging by his smirk, however, it was clear that Draco was doing a piss poor job at keep his cool. Damn it! He was better than this! Why was this really good looking guy with his damable smile and his... Why the hell was he so good at making a fool out of him? He had the best pureblood-mask in all of BeauxbÃ¢tons Academy, so why was he getting all flustered by the man? Sure he was THE Harry Potter, but still...
Pushed under the spot light, Draco faced the hall of spectators with dread in his stomach. The blonde teenager startled once he started to hear whistles and cat-calls from the audience; he was quite a sight for all the men to see.
It was during the exchange of vows that Sirius finally realised that Remus John Lupin was the man with whom he wished to spent the rest of his life with. So, he made his way through the city of Bucharest and found a jewelery shop; it was there that he found the perfect ring for his darling. A beautiful platinum ring shaped like a howling wolf with blue diamond for the eye of the wolf, just like his. It had a twin with a yellow diamond for the other wolf's eye, just like Remus's. It was perfect for Remus! Sirius invited his lover to the fanciest and most expensive restaurant in Romania to have all of the restaurant to themselves. After dining by candlelights, Sirius got down on one knee and asked his love if he would do him the honor of being his husband. Next morning, Remus and Sirius announced the news to the Vaux de Villiers and to Harry.
snake that he was, he had bypass the Headmaster (fully knowing the man would have obliviated the girl and make the whole thing seem like a small spat instead for what it was) and spoken directly with Minerva, Madam Bones and had contacted the girl's parents. Before he even knew what was going on, the Board of Governers had been made aware and had forced him to expel the three kind, if misguided, boys since they were going to Azkaban.
''Neither is Dudley! I am taking care of Harry, because no one fed him, changed him or comfort him after he JUST lost his parents! I didn't pay attention to Dudley because he was throwing a temper tantrum just because he wants to be the center of attention.'' snapped back Rose, insulted that her sister would dare scowl her for for not indulging her stupid kid. ''I said that I would going to take care of Harry and that is what I am going to do. Since, you are clearly too incompetent to take care or notice of anyone else than your own child. I will take care and notice this child and no other.''
The two young men talked for a while, ignoring the looks of amusement from their friends and the looks of shock from the British. To be fair to the poor, prudish and sexually-repressed British, the two young men were more flirting than actually talking. If they had not been in the middle of a hallway with many people watching them, Harry would have tried to steal a kiss from the blonde.
Ragnok and aunt Rose were deeply agaisnt him learning the Dark Arts as this could give a reason to the British Ministry of Magic to take him away from his aunt, uncle Alexander and uncle Ragnok. However, if he went to Durmstrang he would have to learn them. He didn't know if it was worth it; maybe Ilvermorny wouldn't be so bad...
''You will tell Vernon to accept that promotion in America. You will tell him that it will be good for his reputation and for your son if you all moved to America. You will write a letter saying that you grant ME sole custody of our nephew Harry James Potter and have one of your neighbors sign as a witness. You will move as soon as possible and you will never come back. Do not tell anyone where exactly you are going and do not give them a forwarding address. You will dissapear and never come back to England. Am I clear?'' demanded the youngest woman as she looked straight in her sister's eyes.
Third, Sirius Black... The man had been freed by the Weasley twins for over seven months now and had refuse any summons, letters or requests to meet with him. He knew that Sirius was with Harry Potter and could convince him to come to Hogwarts, but Albus couldn't reach him and place compulsion spells or manipulate him. He had though that with Lord Voldemort's return (even if no activity was observed. The dark wizard had been quite peaceful and silent in the last years since he stole the Philosopher's stone.) and the reformation of the Order of the Pheonix that Sirius would come running back to avenge his bestfriend and his wife's deaths, but no. Sirius had just written him a letter explaining that he was taking his time at knowing Harry and making sure the boy had a good life and was safe. So long as Harry was alive and safe, the man considered that he was sticking it up to Lord Voldefarts.
This had infuriated James and Albus. They had thought that with the vast wealth of the Potter family, they could do so much good for the future. They could sway the werewolves to their side, they could help muggleborns and their families move into new safehouses, they could arm themselves, they could build-up influence and combat that of the Death Eaters in the Wizengamot without having to sit to boring and long sessions. Yet, Charlus Potter's will was absolute. The man had declared his son inapt at the role of Lord of House Potter and left everything to his grand-child for it's 21
That was quite a relief for the goblin; he was so sure that Vaux De Villiers would have been insulted with his request. The Vaux De Villiers family prided themselves in their abilities with the dark arts. They were an institution in the French Wizarding World. They fought in the Hundred Year War, fought in every single civil war, fought for Kings and Country, fought against Kings and Country. They saved and betrayed and liberated France so many times that NEWT students at Beauxbatons Academy tried for years to dissifer if the Vaux De Villiers were considered traitors or heroes at the moment (they were neither, as half had supported Grindelwald and the Germans during World War Two and the other half fought against the invaders and with the Resistance).
âIs Durmstrange Institute more like Hogwarts or more like BeauxbÃ¢tons?â asked Sue Li, intrigued by the students in red.
Once more, the cup burst into blue flames and spew out another piece of parchment. This time it was Madame Maxime who deftly caught the name, much to Dumbledoreâs ire at being upstaged.
âIf I could have a moment of your time, the cup will soon be announcing the names of the champions. Again, I must warn all students that should your name be chosen as a champion, you will have to compete or face dire consequences. However, should the chosen champion be under the age of seventeen, the Ministry and the organisers of the Tournament would be declaring this Triwizard Tournament of 1997 officially cancelled and the student shall be expelled for ruining the competition.Â  There is a reason we made sure that only those in their seventh year and were of age could participate. The tasks are extremely dangerous and deadly. They are not unsurmountable, but they were made in mind for those who have already pass their sixth year. Now, ladies and gentlewizardsâ¦ The first champion of the Triwizard Tournament of 1997 isâ¦â
The two rivals met on a cold weekend of May, on the planes of Tuscany and, with Alcazar as his second, Harry fought the duel of his life. No rules, no hold-backs, no limitations aside from the Unforgivables; anything else was permitted. Half-way through, however, Ricardo cheated and had four of his friends, plus his second, attack his opponents. Alcazar and Igor wasted no time in coming to their friend's aid, taking each two opponents. The duel took less than fifteen minutes and resulted in Harry's camp victory. Despite ruining his reputation and his family's good name, Ricardo refuse to honor his end of the deal and fled the field, only to be stopped by Blaise who handed over the promised prize to the victor.
''This came for you a few minutes ago. It's up to you. Do you want to send the letter yourself or do you want Ragnok to deal with this?â asked the older man.
This, of course, was quite painful to Dumbledoor's ego as he had thought that he had manipulated the Potter prat into giving him his fortune, but now he had nothing. However, the worse had yet to come. Filling to become Harry's only magical guardian, Albus learned that Charlus Potter had once again beaten him to it. Before his death, the man made his son relenquish to him his right to choose a magical guardian other than the child's godparents. In other words, since Sirius Black was now in Azkaban (unfornate, but necessary to his plans) and Alica Longbottom, nÃ©e MacMillan, in St-Mungoes, it was Charlus Fleamont Potter that decided who would be the Boy-Who-Lived's magical guardian. And boy did Albus get the shock of his life! As it turns out, no one but the goblin Ragnok could choose where could Harry live, where he could persue his magical education, how he was raised and what rituals he could perform or have perform on him.
Now Albus was truly screwed. He had to give up the books, the Invisibility cloak and Harry to Ragnok or face a cell in Azkaban. No amount of manipulation, of sweet talk or grand-fatherly wisdom would save him now. However, if he could place a few more blocks and tracking spells on the boy before handling him over to the goblins... Ah! No. That would not due. Ragnok must have thought of that possibility and demanded to know the location, but forbide Dumbledoor to ever see or retrieve Harry. He could not be in the same room, he could not communicate with the child's guardians, he could not send one of his friends to see the child or communicate with the child or it's current guardians. Dumbledoor could only give the adress and that was it.
Today was the day that he was to announce which school he wished to attend. He had many different options to choose from. Almost all of the Great Eleven Magical Schools in the world had accepted him; only Mahoutokoro and Koldovstoretz had refused his guardians requests. The honorable Japanese school had refused his acceptance due to the fact that despite the soul leech was gone, his magical core was grey from birth and Harry did not speak one word Japanese; therefore, inilligible for the mandatory interview with the school's headmaster. The Russian school reason for Harry's refusal was not something anyone could have planned for.
Since the incident, Lord and Lady Malfoy have become almost paranoid at the idea that their son could one day fall into such a trap by a more skilled manipulator, so they made sure to be as vicious and as protective as possible whenever someone approached them about Draco's future. Draco was always warned in advance to beware of certain people; thus saving him from many gold-diggers and their families.
Now, why does of all this matter? Well, Rose was a woman who knew how to fight, survive and kill without ever being caught. Add on to this, her protectiveness and her vindictiveness, you have a powerful and dangerous enemy. She was not going to stand around and let her nephew be used and manipulated by gold-digging, wand-waving, entitled, arrogant and delusional fools like Dumbledore and his sycophants.
They made it out to the cabaret club just in time and ran back to the Malfoy's townhouse. Once there, the three teenagers bid each others goodnight and the two french teenagers left in a Taxie Magic to their home. Not sparing another moment, Draco ran to the Floo, vanished to Malfoy Manor, ran up the stairs to his room, jumped into bed, realised he still wore his wig, threw his wig in his dirty clothes basket and threw the covers over his head just as his mother poked her head through the door.
The Ministry officials left as well, passing him by and almost turning their noses at him. They were not happy and had no problem showing it. In the end, he was left alone and in the cold. How long had it been since he had felt like this? Too long and it was frightening for the old wizard. He needed to speak with Harry about the prophecy and his role in the upcoming war. He needed to warn the boy about the Minister being Lord Voldemort and push him towards a proper light family. Yet, the boy refused to speak with him, refused to be deferential to him as his parents were, snapped at him and walked out on him. That little brat!
It was during third year that Draco really started to come out of his shell. With the chance of studying Enchantement and new languages such as Russian, German and Chinese, Draco started meeting new people and started to make a name for himself. Slowly but surely, with his ease in Chinese and Russian, Draco became a very dedicated and appreciated student and sometimes tutor for other students. He even offered English turoring lessons and became the English teacher's assistant, earning him a bit of cash for his help (Lucius Malfoy often bragged to his Death Eater friends about his son's accomplishements) and some good impression from his teachers that will be getting him far in his future.
It was also that year that Draco felt for the first time attraction to someone. He began to have a crush on BÃ©atrice Montpellier, a pureblood with long blond hair and pale blue eyes. They played around each other for awhile before they, shyly, became a couple. It was Draco's first love and he was the perfect gentleman. He was attentive, kind, sweet and always willing to help her whenever she needed help... If only she had been the same. You see, BÃ©atrice would betrothed to an old and foul smelling man once she graduated and she absolutely hated the very idea of such an union; so she decided to look for a younger and more malleable target. And hold and behold, the perfect chump fell unto her lap in the form of the Malfoy heir. She stringed him along and used emotional manipulations to have Draco write to his father to have a betrothal contract made with her parents. Now, Draconis Lucius Malfoy may be thirteen, may be in love for the first time and may not be as experienced as older boys, but he was no fool. The second BÃ©atrice asked that he write to his father for a betrothal contract if he really loved her was the moment alarms began to ring in his head. He was raised by a Slytherin family to become a Slytherin; he knew what manipulation was when he saw it. And so, he wrote to his father to explain his situation. Two days later, BÃ©atrice broke up with Draco before the entire schooll when she learned that her parents had decided to remove her from schooll and have her privately tutored since she was clearly incapable of being faithful to her betrothed and respectful of her family's honor by trying so pathetically to trap a great and noble family like the Malfoy. Plus, they were English. What was the girl even thinking?
Once seated, she noticed that the BeauxbÃ¢tons delegation was sitting with the Ravenclaws, while the Durmstrang delegation with the Slytherins. Looking down the table, she spotted Zabini with his best-friend Theodore Nott and one Durmstrang student. She couldn't believe her eyes as she paled. There sitting next to Zabini and greeting everyone of the snakes warmly and with a million watt smile was the one, the only... Harry James Potter.
Narcissa and Lucius had made it clear to their son that they cared not if he prefered men or women; there were potions for heirs if need be. It warmed the young Malfoy's heart to know that his friends would always be there for him when in need and that his parents would always love him, no matter what path he chosed. That summer would always be one of the most memorable ones in his life.
Here is the next chapter, please let me know what you think in the comments. Next chapter, Harry starts to attends Hogwart's classes, meets up with Draco and shocks the Hogwarts population. Rose and Alexander meet up with Voldemort, Sirius talks with Narcissa and we get to see where is Dudley.
Dudley was currently living with his father's sister, Marjorie Dursley; she took her nephew in after the death of his parents. Vernon and Petunia had left England a few days after the death of Harry's parents to New Jersey for Vernon's job. Things were going well and the family was prospering: Vernon had a promotion, Petunia was the neighborhood's queen bee, Dudley was going to daycare and made many friends... All came crashing down one day when Vernon and Petunia decided to spend the day together and stayed home; they had sent their son to daycare to make sure that they were alone. They wanted to reconnect and have another child... Unfortunately, at the same time, a Mafia hitman had been tasked to take out Vernon after the man had turn back on his end of a deal. His name was Richard Kuklinski and was known as the IceMan. His aunt and uncle were his newest victims and Dudley only survived for being at daycare. Their bodies were found in the overly large freezer in their home as the man didn't have time to take away their corpses. They were only discovered three days later when the police decided to investiguate the Dursleys disapperance.
The Goblet burst into blue flames and spew out a piece of parchment. It shot through the air and was swiftly caught by Dumbledore. Taking a moment to read the name, the man then gave a wide grandfatherly smile towards the students and called out:
During that time, Rose had travelled throughout Europe and had gotten many contacts as part of her job, one of which was Alexander Vaux-De-Villiers. They had met in the French town of Lyon, when an imbecile had had the
The word had to be air-quoted because Albus Dumbledore had replied that the entire event was pointless since they would all meet at his school for the tournament. He added that if such an event was to take place, then the trip and stay of the students attending the event should be payed by the host as it would be unfair to FORCE his students to go to another country just for some party, especially as some students didn't have the money for it. Oh, yes! Because, requesting a portkey for France that lasted for 18 hours and that was freely given to any Brittish citizens as part of the economical trades the two countries had together, was such a hardship! Because, it was an affront to invite students to attend a party! A party that many of both school had declined to attend for various reasons without ever facing reprecussions for it! Because, it was horrible of them to host an event that promoted international cooperation and friendship in a non-competitive atmosphere... Please, could someone read the objectives of the Triwizard Tournament to Harry again!
Thankfully, the Durmstrang delegation had agreed to a few class shared with the Hogwarts students. Albus knew that Harry had taken Defense, Ancient Runes and Potions. All classes that had either Hermione Granger or Ronald Weasley in them; they could interact and befriend Harry, leading him to the Light. Through young Ronald, Harry would meet young Ginevra and she could seduce him. He would have to send Granger and the Weasleys to investigate this relationship between the Malfoy brat and Harry.
After this came the discussion about Harry's health. It was decided that a french healer would be looking over the little boy. St-Mungoes healer's were... abysmal at best. They still practiced medical procedures that had been proven as ineffective and outright banned by the whole of Europe before the Second World War. They didn't believe in the new developments in medicine and barely had any ideas of the necessary vaccines for children. Dragon Pox was still a mortal disease for children and adults in England, when for the rest of the world it was a mild inconvenient. The Vaux De Villiers family healer would be looking over Harry and would recommend any change necessary to Harry's well-being to Ragnok before anything was done.
Once the meal was over, the Hogwart Headmaster asked some kind of surly, bitter and old man to bring in the âimpartial judgeâ. Once the âjudgeâ was near the head table, after a small dramatic and unnecessary pause, the old man pulled a ratty sheet off the âjudgeâ to show off a intricately ornated silver and glass trophy that spouted blue flames, coating the Great Hall in a ominous blue tint.
(At minight in the streets of Paris), a very innoncent and beautiful song... So long as you were too young or too stupid of understand the very strong sexual innuendo behind the words. Thankfully, Draco was neither and began to sing; he swayed his hips and purred his words out with a breathless voice.
It could have been the perfect ending to tumultous year, had Harry had no adults who cared for him. As such, the second he stepped foot in his uncle's house, he was grounded and forbidden to to leave the house for the whole summer. No one was cutting him some slack, not even uncle Padfoot or uncle Moony. Damn!
Petunia Dursley, nÃ©e Evans, was perfectly normal, living in a perfectly normal house, in a normal neighborhood with her perfectly normal husband and their perfectly normal son. Thank you very much! Petunia Dursley, nÃ©e Evans, was the vice-president of her neighborhood's book club, the thrice time winner of the best garden of Little Whingning and was the street gossip queen. Her husband, Vernon Dursley, was the important Vice-president of the sale department at Grunning Drill Company and was a man who always remember to put down the toilet seat after he was done. Her son, Dudley Dursley, one year and a few months old, was a little angel who was a bit fussy about certain things, but always deserved the very best and always made her proud.
âOf course, the first years are shadowed by the seventh years to show them how it's done and help them understand the responsibilities and duties that come with being a student of BeauxbÃ¢tons Academy. The French believe deeply in a sense of community and doing one's civil service. Everyone has to pitch in when it comes to raising funds, keeping the dormrooms clean, keeping up the various projects and activities that they participate in.â
Ricardo Zabini needed to get Draco Malfoy's hand or he would be disowned by his family. After the humiliation of the Potter incident, as the elders of the family called it, Ricardo's hold on the family was weaker than a newborn babe. There was talk about putting his second cousin, Blaise, at the head of the family and it was something that almost everyone wanted. Ricardo had lost a major financial deal in with the most powerful and important Eastern European potion ingredient company in a bid to black-mail Potter after his little prank at the European Duelling Tournament. Then, he lost the company and a chance to get Ricardo's sister, the ugly Annamaria, into a respectable and profitable mariage with his little duel on the planes of Tuscany. His refusal to honor the deal made cast a reputation of faithlessness and back-stabbing onto the family. If he could bring Draco into the family, the third richest and influencial heir of all of Europe, he could keep his âcrownâ and get even with Potter once and for all. He would seduce both parents (he was a master at it), then would make himself the official suitor of Draco and have some âalone timeâ with him. It would be easy then to make sure that the boy obeyed him and married him; pretty and sheltered boys like him didn't have what it took to stand up to someone who had the audacity to physically strike them (Oh, how wrong he was). He would intimidate the boy into marrying him and would then gain complete control of the Malfoy fortune; he would have to get rid of the parents, of course, but that was child's play for him.
Mrs Figgs was rightfully shocked. Petunia Dursley left for America with Harry Potter! She had to tell Dumbledoor and make sure that they could find the boy before the Death Eaters did. They had to make sure that the muggles would never again leave their home like this. How was the Order supposed to protect and train Harry to his destiny if the Dursley family kept moving from one place to another? This was awful! Just awful!
Not many country could say that they were proud of their Dark Lords; Germany had all but kicked out the Grindelwald family after their black sheep had started the war and Spain still refused to acknowledge that they had the most Dark Lords than any other country in all of Europe (more than two per centuries in the last millenia; far more than all the Eastern countries put together during the same lapse of time). France, however, made sure that everyone knew that they had their very own Official Dark Lord whom they could consult and work with if a situation arised that had any connection to the dark. For every consultation, the Head of the Vaux De Villiers would receive compensation for disturbing his precious time. They were the closest thing to royalty since the French Revolution (Surprinsingly, the only conflict that the Vaux De Villiers have never engaged in).
The woman did not take this lightly and strucked her son for his disrespect. Instead of folding in and be shocked by such a gesture from his own mother as Narcissa had hoped, Draco kept his head held high and sneered down his nose to the woman who gave birth to him. All respect, all admiration and all love he had for her was gone from his eyes; only disdain, anger and disgust remained. Narcissa Ophelia Malfoy, nÃ©e Black, no longer was the mother of Draconis Lucius Malfoy. She felt it in her bones, in her magic and, most importantly, in her heart. She had crossed a line and there was no going back. By refusing to listen to her son's plea, by insulting him, by trying to emotionally manipulate him and by striking him, she had broken all ties to her son.
Love potions, compulsion spells and even sabotaging, bullying and threatening anyone that you may like. The Headmaster gave them the task to become your friend and turn you against your family. You have to be careful! Ron is average and isnât much of a threat, especially if you get him angry. Heâs easy to rile up and his arrogance will give you half of the win in a duel. Hermione is the real problem. That girl is the best student of her year and is very powerful. She knows a lot and has huge ego. She isnât above using complicated and dangerous magic if it helps her get her way.â Explained the redhead as tears began to well up in her eyes and her limbs started to shake from the terror of the situation.
âI see... Marco and I were simply curious and wanted to make sure. Our friend has been sexually harassed before and men have tried to have her in their bed by force when she rejected them. With her being a muggleborn, they assumed that either she would be grateful to have the dubious
! I must say that I admire your work. The Rougemont family had been out of control for years. Believing themselves above the law and the Ancient Laws of our world. With the patriarch's friendship with the previous gouvernement, it was impossible to do anything without commiting political suicide. Yet, you came and defeated their younguest and most powerful heir in single combat and was able to get out of it glorified. The Malfoy family was perhaps the only one who could do it. Not even the Vaux-De-Villiers wanted to get into that mess, we didn't have the political capital or strengh to do so. I am disapointed, however, that I was not able to see the duel. I heard it was spectacularly bloody... What a shame!â complimented Harry with a quick glance towards the blushing angel at his side, before turning his gaze to the dancefloor and hiding his smirk with a sip of his drink.
â. Even Harry, someone who didn't take pleasure out of other people suffering, had laught and enjoyed the torment of the old man. Some would say that it was petty and juvenile, but after spending seventeen whole years away from his homeland in exile, out of fear of being kidnapped or harmed or bewitched by the man and his sycophants, Harry had no remorse. It didn't help that uncle Alexander had confess to the slandering of his family by Dumbledore shortly after the boy had entered Durmstrang.
The teacher got up from her desk and went to the other Head of Houses; if anyone could help her it was them. Pomona Sprout, her old friend for her schoolgirl days and fellow professor, would help her keep this letter from the Headmaster. Pomona never agreed with the idea of stereotypes and the pressure children had when they came to Hogwarts and into one of the Houses, like the Headmaster was. Everyone knew for a fact that if Harry Potter were to be in any other house than Gryffindor, then the Headmaster would re-sort him into the house of HIS choice; everyone in school and in England would be disappointed and hostile to the poor child, putting all their expectations on him and freaking out when he didn't achieve them. Pomona loved and encouraged any child who wanted to work hard and do what was needed to get to their goals instead of taking the easy road or abandoning the effort all completely. So she would help the boy with his efforts to improve.
âExcuse you? Who or what gives you the idea that you can call me with such familiarity without my permission? We are not friends! Do not presume that simply because my parents were friends with you that this extends to me! I do not give a flying hippogryphâs shite about what you have to say! I do not give you permission to call me by my first name and I am not your boy! Now, my headmaster and I will be returning to our schoolâs ship, regardless of what YOU say or want, Headmaster Dumbledore.â Snapped Harry as he walked out the door without a second glance backward.
The conversation was cut short when the door opened once more to allow the three Heads and the Ministry officials to enter. First, you had Ludlow Bagman, unrepentant gambler and washed-up has-been from an average Quidditch team with an average career who used his somewhat fame to get to the top of the International Cooperation and Game Department of the Ministry. The man was completely incompetent and unfit to hold his position, butâ¦ nepotism.
As the goblin prepared the paperwork, Rose went to get her fiancÃ©. It took less than five minutes for Rose and Alexandre entered the living room. Ragnok was quite surprised at the young german man. Alexandre Balthazar Vaux De Villiers, next Monsieur Vaux De Villiers, was a 6 foot 8 tall man with large shoulders, muscular frame and golden eyes. His hair, rich and dark cupper, so distinct of his family, was pulled back into a spiky mess. Dressed in a completely black three piece suit with black gloves and only a snow white tie, Alexander Vaux De Villiers cut an impressive figure; one that reminded of his late father, Simon Vaux De Villiers .
Many witches, young and old, requested dances and Harry always danced with grace and without complaints. Even when his partner was a bold eleven year old who asked to dance. Harry could be seen either on the dancefloor or at a table discussing with various people. However, even the best gentlemen need to take a breather and so the young wizard made his way to the buffet with his friend Igor. He was parched and needed a glass of water before he collapsed.
Even after her marriage and adoption of Harry, Rose had kept her position and continued her work. MI-7 was ecstatic over the news. Having Rose in France as the wife of one of the most powerful Dark wizard in France was more than enough to pacify the worried Secret Services. Having Rose raise Harry Potter, the saviour of the Wizarding World, meant that they could insure that the Muggle Government could have better news and Intel on the Magicals than what pitiful and useless information or reports Fudge rarely sent. Having Rose keep her job meant that MI-7 kept their most promising agent active and didnât have to train someone else. The best part of the arrangement was that Harry was never going to be Dumbledoreâs puppet (Muggleborns might love him, but the muggles knew better) and if Lord Voldemort ever did come back, having Rose as an aunt, the boy would be safe and would be trained to fight and survive. In sixteen years, no one in the British Government ever regretted the arrangement.
Once done, Harry made sure that the ink was dry before heading to the owlery. Harry instructed the owl not to stop and simply drop the letter before leaving as soon as possible. The owl had to be careful as it could have a few charms placed on him, something Dumbledore would not hesitate to do. He watched as the majestic bird made it's way to Scotland and wondered if he should have sent a letter to his cousin Dudley.
âIâm glad you were chosen. No offense to Draco or his skills, but had he been a competitor, I would be too distracted by him to give a proper performance.â Said Harry with a smirk while leaning against the wall. âIâd constantly be trying to flirt with him and in turn give the win to Hogwarts. I just couldnât keep my hands off of himâ¦ or my lips.â
Ragnok was still not convinced that Durmstrang was such a good idea. After all, he did not want Hadrian to be exposed to the dark arts. The Brittish Ministry of Magic and Dumbledoor would risk another war with the Goblin Nation if they heard so much as a whisper of Hadrian learning the dark arts.
Draco left the room and went to his bed. Meanwhile, Lucius explained very carefully and through gritted teeth just how disgusted he was with her and this was the last straw. How dare she forced the heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy into a courting he did not want to or with a man she barely even knew? Lucius was going to make inquires about the man to make sure he was the type of man who presented himself to be, as all head of houses and fathers should do. What gave her the idea that she could invite people into his family's house without his approval? What made her think that she had the right to choose who court HIS heir? He would not allow such disrespect fly by.
Hogwarts was in not bringing up his âvictoryâ against the Dark Lord as it was the day his parents died. The majority of the student body had the decency to blush and leave him be after that; those that did not get the message were sharply and quickly told to leave him the fuck alone by the others.
âElite Potter. I called you in with the rest of the staff because I want you and everyone here to be cautious. I'm sure you are already aware of Herr Dumbledore's... Less than healthy interest in you and your family. Given that we are on enemy territory, I want everyone to know that should Herr Dumbledore try to have a discussion alone with Elite Potter, you are to send me a patronus and stay put where you are. Do not allow the man to have any time alone with Elite Potter! I do not care if he is the Headmaster of the hosting school, if he is the Supreme Mugwump or if he is Merlin's reincarnation! Elite Potter is MY student, he obeys MY rules, he will not be speaking to the press or the government or anyone else without atleast one of us there or if his uncle is present. Do I make myself clear?â asked the man as he pinned with his stare all of his subordinates.
''Ah! I see! Harry, I know you don't want to get anyone in trouble with the Ministry over in Britain and that you think the safer route is the best. Sometimes, it is, but this is YOUR life. No one else's. This is your future! No matter where you go to study, so long as you do your very best, no one that matters will be disappointed. The second you choose to lead your life in a certain way just to please someone else or in fear of what others will think, then you have forfeited your life.'' said the man with a soft and wise voice. ''Besides, Durmstrang's dark arts program is very mild compared to it's reputation. They first teach you the difference between light and dark spells and then, they teach you the consequences of the spells and jinxs you learn. In fact, the first year, all you learn is how dangerous the dark arts are and a few spells. They teach you that even if the magic is dark that it isn't evil. And if, at the end of your fifth year, you don't want to continue, then you can drop the course completely.''
The authorities tracked Rose and Marjorie to see which one could take in Dudley. Rose couldn't as she was living with magicals and Dudley was a muggle who knew nothing of magic. Marjorie could and wanted to take in Dudley; she was rather adamant about it and proclaimed that only a Dursley woman could raise Dudley properly. The two women agreed on Dudley's placement, however, they argued tooth and nails on who was going to pay the funeral. Marjorie believed that since Rose was so rich and that she had to raise Dudley that the new Madame Vaux De Villiers should pay for the ceremony and the price wasn't cheap!
Immediately, Harry started on his letter of refusal. The faster he wrote this letter, the faster they could leave Rennes for Berlin. It did not take too long as it did not need too much explanations.
And so, on the Christmas break, pretending to be so very ill as to not go to the, Merlin-awfull, Parkinson's Ball; he then, once his parents were gone, he used the Floo to get to his family's townhouse in Paris. He met up with his friends and left for downtown Paris where Lilianne presented one of her many cousins who was a bouncer for a rather sketchy club. Unbeknown to any of the fifteen year olds, they had just walked in a bar where a fist fight ring was put in place for the night's fight. Once the fights started, Draco used his allowance (50 galleons a month; or, 375$ in Muggle currency) to make bets. Somehow, someway, Draco managed to turned his small pittance (his words concerning his allowance) into a small fortune of 2087. 35$. Where did those 0.35 pence come from? He had no idea, but he had won them. After two hours of betting, drinking and the occasional dancing with very dangerous and muscular men, Draco and his friends were the life of the party. Until the police decided to raid the place, forcing the teenagers to flee by the back door.
was one of them! So the spell that had been held a god-send only a few decades before was now a dangerous and illegal spell. It was used ONCE as a method of defense by a scared man trying to save his family and it became a spell of war. This is what you will learn in the dark arts class.''
plaque for his bravery and his leadership; which gave him entry to a higher position into the Ministry than he could have ever hoped for. Which reflected well on Arthur to have three brave and heroic sons who were far more clever than they appeared; he even managed to have a special internship in the Departement of Mysteries for the twins. Ronald and Molly were the only ones that didn't profit from this whole situation. Ronald never had a single friend aside from Hermione Granger (she was the type of girl who needed to feel superior and better than others at all time and chosed a stupid and lazy boy as her friend and later on her boyfriend to feel better about herself), his grades were abysmal at best, he constantly got into fights and was generally a bully. Molly never got any money to take in and seduce Harry, she never got to trick the boy into liking her and her precious daughter, Ginny.
The old wizard had dug up all sort of things on his aunt and painted her as a loose, immoral, dangerous, unhinged and gold-digging bitch who abused and neglected Harry. Just because the woman went to military school and later on into the army did not make her a vicious killer that would make Bellatrix Lestrange jealous in terms of cruelty. Just because she married a rich pureblood man didn't mean that Harry was raised to be a spoild, ignorant and arrogant child. His aunt never showed any emotions from the slandering or the Howlers she received because of Dumbledore, but that's how you knew she was hurt. Rose was the type to keep her pain bottled up and only release it when she felt safe enough. It had been hard on her to have her good name dragged through the mud. Especially as it splashed onto the Vaux-De-Villier family; many had demanded that Alexander divorced Rose and just hand over Harry to the English. Thankfully, the man never did, stating that while he may not love Rose as a wife and more as a best-friend, he did love Harry as a son.
Petunia's heart shattered at the news that her sister's death and at the thought that her nephew now being an orphan. However, all the hearbreak, all the sadness she felt and all the love she could possibly have felt for her nephew and estrange sister all vanished when she realised that her nephew was a freak just like his parents!
Harry didn't know what to think. This was something he had never thought of; this certainly put things into perspective. If this is what he was going to learn at Durmstrang and no where else, than it changed to game. Besides, his uncle was right, he couldn't just take on a school where he would be miserable and might not be treated right just because of the Ministry and Dumbledore's need to control everything! The people around him hadn't work and scheme just for him to bend to the old man's will! This was his life! He would call the shots and screw to hell anyone who disagree with it!
Draco had met the man before and had not been impressed; the man gave off a perverted and predatory feeling. Not the good kind either, the kind that told the blond that Zabini was not a man who would hesitate to raise a hand on his lovers and would not understand the meaning of the word no. Fortunately, Marco was there to save Draco as he grabbed him by the waist, pulled him close to him and began laughing loudly, before pulling him towards the exit with a bouquet of rose in one hand and a loud proclamation that he was the one going home tonight with the most beautiful âgirlâ in all of France.
Petunia didn't waste any time to make sure her sister's advices were followed and she waited in the kitchen; it took less than 40 minutes before she heard the tale tell sound of the Evan sister's old code. Carefully, Petunia opened the front door and led eyes upon her youngest sister. Rose walked right in without a word and made her way to the kitchen. There she saw her two nephews; one in a highchair with chocolate milk, the other on the floor chewing on his blanket.
Of course, being raised to be a man by his aunt and uncle meant that Harry kept his mouth shut and his opinion to himself. It was not easy in the least, not with the English hounding him everywhere. After a while, Harry got fed up and simply pulled out a sob story about how hard Halloween was for him because of his parentâs deaths and that he was very emotional during this day. He also thanked the English for
The cousins met during those three days in England and were actually in good terms. As it turns out, without Petunia's hatred of her sister, Vernon never hated Harry and Dudley never emulated his parents in his treatement of his cousin. Since Petunia never had to spoil Dudldey and hurt Harry to make sure her own son never felt overshadowed or inferior to his cousin, Dudley never grew up as a bully. He had a temper like both his parents, was prone to fights when angry, but he never hurt others for the sake of it. He also never became the size of a baby beach whale; sure, he was chubby, but not morbidally obese!
âOf course! I like you Harry, but I love Blaise and I want nothing to do with that stupid plan of theirs. Itâs so wrong and creepy that they would do this! I just need a few moments to center myself. You should leave first, and then Iâll leave in a few minutes. No need to make people gossip. I know the Disillusion spell.â
It got bad and it got worse. It got so bad that Igor and Alcazar refused to speak to each other for three whole months. It was after Yule that the whole affair came to a head. It was discovered that the victim was consuming drugs during the caravan trip and had had mistaken the aurors for monsters, thus resisting arrest; it was also discovered that the young auror had been told horribly racist and false stories by his mentor, a man with a deep seated mistrust and hatred for the Gypsie community, and had thought that the man he had killed was going to use some dark curse on them. His behavior was strange and he was speaking in giberish.
''Of course! Nobody will force you to take classes you don't like after your OWLS! The reason why Durmstrang kept on his dark arts program when all other schools dropped it was because the school believed that children need to know both the good, the bad and the ugly of magic and what happens when someone abuses any side of it. The dark arts classe also teaches the appropriate way of using spells and the dangers link to it.''
Here is the next chapter. Please tell me what you think. Should I simply jump directly to Harry's seventh year and the tournament or show snippets of his education and life during his time at Durmstrang. Again I am open to suggestions and ideas. A special thanks to Fuckoff12 for their great suggestion! :)
âWhy didnât you believe that you would be chosen? You managed to summon the chair from the other side of the room without word or wand. I doubt it was just excitement or accidental. To be able to do this, you have to have power and skills. You shouldnât doubt yourself like this!â said Harry, gently.
. It never went further, but it helped her narrow what she was looking for in a man. Now, just because some of them acted proper and charming did not mean that once they were refused something for the first time in their life that they would take it calmly... They tried to force the young woman to comply to THEIR wishes, only to be visited by an enraged English Dragon. They never did managed to find the left testicule of Nathaniel Rougemont...
''Rose? It's me. Petunia. We... we need... we need to speak face to face! It's Lily! She... Her... Lily's dead, Rose... She was killed by some madman from her freak world and... and... her son is here and... I don't know what to do. There's this letter and it's... Please! Please, come and help me! I'm scared! Please Rose!'' cried Petunia as she finally allowed herself to feel her emotions.
''Now, I understand that since young Hadrian is under the protection of the Vaux De Villiers House, you will have to teach him certain... Let's say, less than savory spells that are not quite illegal, yet still frown upon. It is tradition in your family. However, I will have to ask you not to teach him any dark art. It would be too dangerous.'' requested the goblin with a pointed look towards the man.
Edward and Iris Evans sent all their daughters to private and specialised schools; Petunia went to a private school for young women that taught an amazing science programs, Lily went to Hogwarts to learn magic and Rose to her military school. Each girls went to the best school their parents could afford. To Rose, when Petunia decided to drop her chances at Oxford to marry that walrus of a man, she had disgraced and disrespected her parents sacrifices to give them the best futures possible. They have not spoken in six months after their last fight.
The preparations were made quickly and efficiently to arrive as soon as possible. And while each of them were excited for various reasons, they all knew that the battles coming ahead would be daunting and very difficult. They would face the challenges ahead and the ugliness of the British with their heads held high and show the English just what they were made of.
Despite everyone acclaiming him as a hero (for something he actually did this time), Harry felt no joy. He had killed a man. Granted the man wanted to rape his friend and kill him, but still. He had taken a life! What thirteen year old would not have some sort of guilt or problem with this? Thankfully, his family was there and got him counselling, along with Alcazar who desperately needed it.
''Yes, I am. I am aware that I am not a magical like my nephew, but I am marrying a wizard who will help me take care of my nephew. In exchange, I help him obtain his heritage by marrying him. Alexander will teach Harry how to managed his estates and his heritage and make sure that Harry has all the necessary shots and medical treatments. He does not have children and he would love to raise Harry.''
Lilianne got up and walked to her Headmistress with her head held high and a large smile on her lips. She shook her Headmistressâs hand and made her way to the small office door hidden in an alcove near the Head table. To the purebloods and wizard-raised half-bloods, this elevated her in their eyes. It was only proper to shake hands with oneâs Headmaster as a sign of accepting the responsibility of representing their school in such a function. It was also a sign of gratitude to be given the trust and honor of competing in their schoolâs name. Should the Headmaster refuse to shake the hand offered, it would have been a large signal that said Head was against the decision and was a grave insult. Thankfully, Madame Maxime was beyond please and shook vigorously her studentâs hand with a proud smile.
So a compromise was proposed. Harry will attend the french magical elementary school and not learn any dark arts spell, curse or jinx from Alexander; once he turned eleven, they would leave the choice to Harry to decide which school he wished to attend. They would afford all the documentation to the child on his tenth birthday and allow him an entire year to make his choice. That way, no one could say that they forced or pressured the boy into a school unfit for him. The choice would be made by Harry himself and that was it. Of course, not a damn word would be said to anyone in Britain about this project. Everyone would try to take Harry from them and send him in Dumbledoor's clutches.
''I will take custody of Harry and leave the country as soon as I can reach a certain friend of mine. I will be taking Harry with me as I leave. Now write the letter and fetch one of your friends. I need to make a few phones calls.'' said Rose as she pulled out two pieces of papers and making her way to the toddler on the floor.
âBloody hell! What are we freezing our asses out? I could be in the Great Hall and be eating! Damn, I'm so hungry!â whined the troll in a garish wig that goes by the name of Ronald Weasley.
And so, the two battled it out in a fight of wits and charms. Pansy fought viciously and simperly, but Ricardo was simply more apt, more experience and had more talent than her. Narcissa favored Ricardo and gave her blessing to the man to court her baby boy. Lucius was more cautious than his wife and did not allow the man to simply walk in the gardens at night with Draco, to Narcissa's frustration.
âI couldnât believe it,â Harry was saying to Neville later that evening. âThe way Lav dove, the poor bouquet didnât stand a chance.â
âI havenât the slightest clue why weâre mates,â Pansy stated haughtily. Luna smiled, her cheeks turning just a bit pink. âOther than being the prettiest girl Iâve ever seen? It wasnât any one thing, everything about her is simply enchanting,â Luna informed everyone, eyeing the Slytherin girl almost dreamily. Pansy, who had grown quite red, seemed unable to say a thing.
âYou know I switched subdivisions,â she explained. âThat alone makes me stand outâitâs expected that Unspeakables remain in the Chamber they initially select upon entry to the Department. Thereâs never been a rule made that you
"Iâwhat?" Harry couldn't work out what sort of conversation this was, all he knew was that he was painfully embarrassed, and when no one was even around to see it no less. "Bugger off Malfoy! Why do you even care?"
Not for the first time, though, Harry wondered how Ron felt about this. It was often that he found himself wondering about how Ron felt regarding something. Harry knew, of course, what Ron thought of himself and Draco. But did Ron miss Harry? Did he possibly get worked up sometimes, and go searching for Harry on impulse, only to spot him and remember that he shouldn't of gone looking at all? Because Harry did, quite a lot actually. And Harry was tired of it. With a sigh, he let himself fall backwards until his back hit Draco's mattress. He didn't bother to say anything a few minutes later as Theo came in, climbed into his own bed, and promptly fell asleep. Harry decided he may as well nap too, and closed his eyes, taking comfort in the smell of Draco that clung to the bedsheets and appreciating very much the fact that he had nowhere he needed to be.
âAre you staying?â Draco asked into his ear. Harry almost shivered, but thankfully caught himself. âOr do you have to go back there?â
Harry stared at the dot in confusion. Mr. Crouch, as far as Harry had last heard, had been too ill to go to work. Crouch hadnât even attended the Yule Ballâso what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one oâclock in the morning? Harry hesitated briefly, a warning voice in his head that sounded an awful lot like Draco telling him to rethink what he wanted to do. In the end, though, Harryâs curiosity won out. He moved toward the nearest staircase, planning to find out just what Crouch was up to.
The five of them all looked around. She was right, obviously. They mustâve come milesâperhaps hundreds of milesâto get here. There was no telling how long it would take the rest of the Aurors back at Hogwarts to track them and apparate here. After all, Draco had no idea how closely they were being monitored. What if the rest of the Auror force hadnât yet noticed they were gone?
Here we are at the finish. Thank you so much for reading! I hope you guys had a bit of fun with this and I'd love if you'd come chat with me in the comments c:
Lavender had patched her ideas together through blatant guesswork, and Dumbledore had always been a cryptic old tosser who pretended to know far more than he actually did. The only person Harry had ever entirely trusted with the truth in all his life had been Hermione.
Draco gave a half smile at that. âIâm still not totally convinced you arenât dangerous,â admitted the blond.
âThanks,â Harry said, trying not to show the full force of his relief. He would have felt like a right bastard if sheâd been serious. Especially since he hadnât given her specifically much thought.
Harry's vision was clouding over red, especially because Draco still had not said a single word. "Disgusting? Really? Well I think there are loads of things that are disgusting, Ron. Like homophobia for example. Oh and dishing out ultimatums. Abandoning your best mate multiple times, thatâs also a good one. You know what mate? Me snogging my boyfriend isn't whatâs disgusting here, you are."
They were in the middle of deciding what exactly Neville should tell Blaise Zabini in the coming days when an awareness came over Harry, and he glanced over to see Malfoy had finally taken notice of his presence. The blond gave him a dark look as he excused himself from his group of companions.
Things continued on much the way Maria said they would. Someone seemed to exit the field no less than every five minutes. Thankfully, for first tryouts, nothing actually exploded. Harry mightâve gone deaf if there had been. Of the original roughly two hundred plus players that had come to try out, only about fifteen or so from each House were left. He could only imagine how intense things were going to become the following day, and certainly understood why Maria was so anxious for Wednesday.
"I wish you lot had been able to appreciate his face when Harry's cauldron went up, it was priceless!" He exclaimed, laughing some more.
Harry gaped. "Are you daft?" he demanded at last. "You were the reason the whole school hated me for months!"
There were no similarities here, he told himself as he fiercely pushed the image from his thoughts and locked it away.
Hermione now appreciated her seat because if she were not in this exact spot, she would not have been able toânow that she had cause toânote just how often Malfoy
"How was I supposed to know if you didn't tell me?" Harry moved then, coming around and sitting down next to Draco. "What did he say?"
Harry stood his ground. âI wish I had a better reason for you. But you would have tried to trap him into telling you something and then you would have gone right to Skeeter.â
"You really are mental," said the blond, but Hermione could tell he had deflated. Â "Have you ever met Potter? I must have been mad to ask the first time."
took charge of our lives,â heâll say. Which will set Nevilleâs nerves. I canât have them like this when weâre trying to brand towards the Mugglesâespecially with Rita still after me for what happened with the whole scandal. Sheâllââ
"Probably not. Well, maybe Vince. Go on and find out, I'm going to get back to what I was reading before you decided to grace me with a heart attack."
Sheila blinked at him. Harry saw the exact moment she realised he was completely serious, and the gravity sunk in. She sat up straighter, crossed her legs. âI think, Harry,â she said carefully, âthat the best thing I can do to help you today is listen.â
âDark Lord called him Wormtail. I was wondering where Iâd heard the name before and then I remembered. Harryâs godfather went to Azkaban for killing him.â
"Being around you," Malfoy said simply. Harry made a note that Draco Malfoy was honest when he had a few drinks in him.
But Harry couldnât just walk out. This wasnât what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to make it
âDo you think Ron will propose?â Harry asked his husband later that night. Theyâd returned to their flat in London about an hour ago. It was the early hours, and Harry lay on their sofa with his legs across the blondâs lap.
Harry sunk downwards, back once again resting against the mattress. Draco laid down next to him on his side, rather like how theyâd been before Harry had dumbly brought up his first and only trip to the zoo. Only now Draco laid a hand on Harryâs cheek and turned his head to the side, their eyes forced to meet.
âAll right Iâll give it to you two,â Joshua said when the group caught up with them, âyouâre pretty good.â
Somehow, Lucius stood over them in the next minute. The man dropped to his knees, placed his wand against Dracoâs temple and murmured another spell Harry had never heard. But it hardly mattered, because Draco did not stir.
Luna's head snapped toward the Slytherin girl in an almost comical manner. Hermione swallowed another cackle.
Hermione didn't get the chance until the following Wednesday. Malfoy always seemed to be accompanied by someone or another, and he would avoid Harryâand Hermione and Ron by consequenceâat seemingly any cost. Ron often said he was glad the git was minding his own business for once, and Harry would absently agree. More than once, however, Hermione would look up during meals to find Harry staring intently in Malfoy's direction, as if he were willing the Slytherin to look at him. Little did Harry know that Malfoy did look, only just as soon as Harry would give up and look away. Malfoy never noticed that Hermione noted this each and every time. That was, until Wednesday evening.
He knew her, ergo she must be meant to know him. The assumption suited Harry perfectly, and he might have pressed the advantage and questioned her about where to find someone more useful, but it was only a few seconds later that someone joined them. An intensely familiar voice had called out after the little girl, and then Ginny was standing behind Victoire, just inside the door, saying âoh, can I help you?â
"The meaning of what Professor?" Draco asked sweetly, his rebellious side returning in response to his godfatherâs tone.
âSomething like that,â replied the blond, sounding oddly hesitant. âThough usually I just help them practice their english.â
"Stop looking so nervous," Draco chided quietly as he sat down next to Harry at the start of class. They had nearly always been partners in potions, difference was now they were each quite happy about it. Only today it could potentially make things more difficult.
Hermione rolled her eyes. She recalled quite well the day Draco and Harry had come through her fireplace and announced that theyâd just tied the knot. She was still holding a, admittedly very minor, grudge that she hadnât been there to see it. They hadnât had much choice, after all, what with the way they were constantly hounded by Skeeter and the rest of the media in those days.
but now people were beginning to talk to him again. At first he'd felt like he'd had some sort of disease, and only the Slytherins were immune. Now it was like the other Houses were suddenly recalling the fact that he and Draco were, in fact, still human beings.
It wasnât that he thought Sheila would ever share what he told her. Harry was actually fairly sure she would understand what heâd chosen to do about Bellatrix. But that wasnât what mattered.
The girl looked at him for a long time. âWow. Youâre serious about this arenât you,â she said. âYouâre really just going to throw away four years of hard work and dedication, when youâre a few big name stories from the top, just because what? Some sanctimonious Sally got in your head?â
The (even sappier, because thatâs how I roll) epilogue is written and will be posted tomorrow. Iâm emotional.
should hear it for once. And since you wonât say it, it sorta looks like I gotta do it for you. Since Iâm a good friend that way.â
âThe first day is mostly just about knocking off people who are just trying out for shits and giggles, kids that are too young to play but show up anyway, the ones who are just here for the cred of getting to say âI tried out,â posers basically. The real magic doesnât happen until tomorrow, thatâs when things get interesting. And then Wednesday is a bloodbath, youâll
"Take a bath andâerâtake the egg with you, andâerâjust mull things over in the hot water. It'll help you think... trust me."
Lavender obviously thought along the same lines. She let out a sigh through her nose, weary. âHarry,â she said gently, âI really donât think you should keep ignoring what I said like this. Even Dumbledââ
And Harry remembered how it felt to be there, at that moment in timeâhelplessly, righteously angry and so very stupid.
âI would offer my advice,â she eventually said, a sight colder than sheâd ever spoken to him before, âbut I think thatâs become rather a lost cause. You might as well just leave.â
Today, however, Hermione had brought different news. Peter, who had been until now unconscious and recovering from his brush with death, had woken up. According to Hermione, heâd been immediately dosed with Veritaserum and questioned extensively. The ministry, as a result, was now working to locate Sirius, encouraging him to come out of hiding with the promise of being absolved of all charges. It had only been a few hours, however, so he hadnât yet shown up. Harry didnât know how long it would be before he would.
Harry knew that in a few minutes heâd join them and Harry would have to choke out a thank you before doing what he really wanted to do and hitting him upside the head.
âMy new friends call me Lev,â he told the crowd conversationally. âThink you can all do that for me?â
Harry had not considered how his interactions with the Department of Mysteries might become more difficult once he had to monitor his level of transperency.
That night in the Slytherin common room found one Harry Potter laying atop a quiet, contemplative Draco Malfoy on the sofa, watching the fire in front of them burn.
It was true that his flat was chic, thoughtfully decorated, and something that was entirely his own. That had been the point after all: somewhere to seclude himself, to be his own manâwhich was really just a prettier way of saying that it was somewhere he could best avoid his family.
The lights in the dorm were still on, as it wasnât late; Harry was certain that Malfoy was still awake.
She'd thought Professor Snape even more mad than was usual when he paired the two boys up, or that perhaps he wanted to make Harry as miserable as possible while in his classâeven if that meant a sacrifice on the part of his star pupil. And, usually, the two boys acted just as to be expected. Furious whispering and scathing insults could normally be heard, and thus ignored, by everyone all throughout class. It was not uncommon for this to escalate into a full out row, ending with a borderline gleeful Snape swiftly taking points from Gryffindor House. But today, more than halfway through the period, Harry nor Malfoy had traded even a single word.
There was a smattering of boos and Neville just nodded. âExactly, I feel the same!â he assured them. âBut I love music, so Iâve gotten permission to play some hits most of youâll be familiar with! That sound good to everyone?!â
It turned out that Joshua really was quite good at Quodpot. He and Matt were the last survivors of the initial match, playing with forty-four, double than what was normalâthough being co-captains, neither of their spots were actually at risk. They were apparently meant to be supervising, but getting carried away. âLike always,â Cosima informed them.
Hermione barely knew him in this world, and she had still done what she could for him. Andâregardless of the reasonâSheila was doing what she could, even despite his not making it easy.
He cut off abruptly, the whole table going completely silent when Malfoy appeared and sat down right beside Harry.
He got up, careful not to jostle Harry, and went to wake the poor sods. Mostly it earned him grumbles and groans and sometimes protests, but they all eventually cleared out. All except for Weasley, who was slumped against the far wall and snoring. Harry had informed Draco around two in the morning that he and his once best friend had indeed begun to reconcile, and Draco had told himself to smile and be glad about it. But, in truth, he was still worried. Weasley had been the cause of Harryâs misery when heâd abandoned him not once, but twice this year. And Draco didnât completely trust the boy not to do it again, no matter how much he wanted Harry to be happy.
The man, or minion as thatâs what he clearly was, spoke then. Though it was less speaking and more chanting, as though the words were some kind of incantation. â
âThe pair thing stuck, though, like it gave everyone some kinda comfort that the staff was at least doing
âDonât say anything to her, Neville, ever,â Harry warned, and Nevilleâs back straightened. He nodded.
They were about a quarter into the gameâRavenclaw up by 20âwhen Harryâs eyes began to wander. He could see a figure a ways down with long white hair and colorful robes who could only be Dumbledore. It had taken him about five minutes solid to look away from the manâs back. Also from where he sat, he could see Madam Hooch, standing next to a slightly-older looking professor Flitwick and a dark haired, tall woman. It hit him, then, that there was no sign of Snape.
Unfortunately, his Death Eaters still were. Aurors surrounded Harry, firing off spell after spell and taking some bad hits in return. Harry finally caught sight of the Auror who looked like him, but his attention was stolen in the next moment by blond hair in his peripheral vision.
âNo oneâs tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a few grindylows,â Harry said. That earned him a scowl from both Sirius and Draco.
Harryâs brows furrowed. He hadnât known that. Sheila didnât give an odd impression at all. She was maybe more relaxed than the others, but just as tidy. Just as sharp. His doubt must have been obvious, because she chuckled.
Not minutes later, they were pulled back. âHarry whatâsââ Hermione broke off when she caught his expression. âOh.â
At noon the next day, the group of four left the castle with plenty of food. They walked through Hogsmeade for a while before they set off on the path Sirius had directed. Finally, they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, carrying newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar.
"Actually yes," Draco said, proud that Harry at least knew something from the past three and a half years of potions courses.
and startâ¦ sorting myself out. It might take me awhile to do that, but I want to. I want to go to Amjadâs matches sometimes and I want to visit Remus, and Sirius too. I want to go home more often. Iâm tired of being this person that everyone hates, so Iâm going to tryâ
exactly. It was more that sharing each otherâs lives had just become a natural sort of thing during the past few months, even amidst all the fear and worrisome goings on. So if, say, someone came into Dracoâs dorm room and was met with the two of them cuddled together in the same bed, it was doubtful there was anyone left who would even so much as blink.
who youâve just informed me has agreed to speak to you again. Regularly. And youâve not done anything since!â
âYes, well.â The older man looked around awkwardly before standing. âIâll go inform your mother and Potter that youâve woken.â
Harry forced himself to shift his focus, taking in the rest of the room. The whole family was here; Bill and Fluer were sharing a centre loveseatâand Harry spared a moment to feel almost warm at seeing Billâs face unmarred for the first time in so many years. Charlie was on a stool nearest where Harry stood at the edge between what was considered the kitchen, a half-eaten slice of pie on the counter behind him.
Hermione sighed. Harry had missed two weeks of classes so far, and refused to even entertain the subject with anyoneâhis godfather included. Sirius wasnât much for applying force, even after becoming Harryâs legal guardian. Narcissa had also tried to convince Harry this wasnât what Draco would have wanted, but she couldnât exactly hold up against his retorts. The older woman had abandoned her life just as much as Harry hadâmore so, even.
Harry nodded, Draco hadnât exactly left him room to argue, and relaxed back down against him. âThank you,â he said after a moment in silence.
Harry sighed as he folded up the letter, bending down to put it with the others in his trunk. His gaze wandered to Malfoyâs bed curtains. They were shut, as they always were around this time. Kyle had fallen asleep on his Care of Magical Creatures book on the bed across from Harry; William was scrawling something in his spiral notebook four beds over, pencil moving rapidly while his brows furrowed in concentration. The sight of the yellow stick and white paper was still an oddity to Harry, but heâd had no shortage of people quick to assure him that they were far more sensible for useâthe very idea of using parchment and quill had mystified his fellow students, leave alone the professors.
Now said blond was staring at him, hands still over his ears and grey eyes wide. Slowly, he dropped his arms.
Harry cringed a bit. âI- youâre right,â he admitted. âI wasnât trying toâ¦â he cut himself off, fumbling awkwardly. âIâm sorry. Thatâs, er, thatâs all I came to do is say that, actually.â
"Here I was thinking you'd chosen your own bed tonight," Blaise said, smirking but not looking away from his vandalism.
âIn the meantime there were actual search parties,â said Maria, recalling it all. âBy that October, everyone was pretty sure they were looking for a couple of bodies. When they showed up in the castle and seemed perfectly fine, the staff actually got mad, like they thought Cel and her just played them all or something. Wasnât âtil later that they realizedâ¦â
The blond blinked for a moment, an uncomfortable look crossing his face. âI was in Potions. Snape was... then you leaned over and told me I missed Harryâs birthday. I was, er, surprised that youâd speak to me.â He shook his head like he was clearing it. âThen nothing... I was just suddenly here.â
Joshua glared at him. âYou think Iâm bad? That bastard Stevenson would take all the credit, and does. Thinks heâs a gift to mankind.â
Draco nodded seriously, but his relief still shone in his bright grey eyes. "Yeah, good thing. Anyway I knew you'd be here and you were closer so I thought I'd come share, but I really should go tell Harry."
Harry tried to speak, but no words would come. His throat closed, a damnable heat building behind his eyes.
"I regret that," Draco said quickly. "I regret a lot of things. I'm all but sure you don't believe it though. Still, being awful to you and your lot just made it easier."
Most everyone came and went, but Harry and Dracoâs mum were practically permanent fixtures here since Draco was brought in. Hermione showed up often enough to bring news and make sure theyâd both eaten, occasionally bringing Viktor in tow while he was still in England. Having the most points had indeed left him with the Triwizard cup, and now the Durmstrang student had enough money to travel on his own, allowing him to remain with Hermione for a few extra weeks. He never showed any less concern than Hermione when it came to any of her friends, always asking after Dracoâs current status and how everyone was holding up.
After all the information they had to share was exhausted, Sirius rubbed his eyes. âWhatâs the time?â
that it hadnât been difficult, given Voldemortâs attempt at reincarnation via Dark Magic had gone wrong, leaving him weak and apparently powerless.
Harry couldnât help his smile and walked forward. âHello, Sirius,â he said when they had all reached the large dog. The dog then turned, and the four of them followed it up, towards and into a dimly lit cave near the very foot of the mountain. Sirius had turned into a man again by the time the four had greeted BuckbeakâDraco with fear and shame, but without injuryâand then entered.
Malfoy didnât get a chance to say anything back before the Headmaster interrupted with a stern âBoys.â
Sheâd merely ignored his tone. âNot that there is a precedent to go by, but Iâd imagine anyone who proves capable of performing occlumency against a second occupant of their very own mind would be considered talented indeed.â
. Draco could remember everything now, everything that been scratching at the back of his mind for Merlin only knew how long. Heâd spent what felt like ages firmly believing that the hell he had dropped into was reality before heâd begun to sense something was truly off. After heâd realised that, it had become a challenge of endurance, seeing how long it would go on beforeâwell, heâd assumed heâd die at some point. He never imagined that he would come out of it alive. He hadnât even been able to remember what
It was all too tied up in Harim and everything else, somehow; Harry never quite knew what to feel or what was acceptable to feel, really.
Apparently not, if the look on Not Fleurâs face was any indication. Draco did as told and remained absolutely quiet, sweat gathering on his forehead. Moments later, a horrible voiceâif it could even be referred to as suchâinterrupted the silence.
He had no real expertise with mediaâ discounting years of harassment. And he couldnât owl Lavender and ask, becauseâagreement to help Harry or noâhe still couldnât be sure where she stood when it came to Skeeter and the
But his mindâ¦ it was too disasterly a place with Harim in it. Every time Reid went in, Harim locked down even harder. Gone, inaccessible.
Vaguely, Draco knew Weasley was gaping at him, but he found he couldn't care less. The indecision in Potter's eyes was enough to make it worth it.
Draco glanced at Dumbledore, praying that the old wizard wouldnât actually consider the question. It seemed the opposite was true, as he actually looked somewhat angered. But Harry had already latched on.
Harry had given a slow blink. âHeâs occluding against me.â It had been a revelation accompanied by almost no shock. Of course thatâs what the prat had been doing! How many mental walls had Harry tried and failed to construct against Snape, back in sixth year? And yet Harim could throw a wall up between himself and Harry, shoving him out like it was nothing, retreating behind it like it was an iron shield. Vanished, Harry had assumed.
It was incredibly slow and taxing, and Harry felt he was barely making progress. His hands, he knew, were no longer webbed, meaning that the gillyweed had lasted nearly as long as it was going to. He kicked harder, feeling the webbing of his feet begin to disappear as well.
"Erâright," said Harry, at a loss and suddenly exhausted by the exchange. "So I'm gonna be going now."
He couldnât see any way for him to help his new friends, and no one believed Cordelia would be found before it was too late for her as well.
Harry stood rather abruptly then. "I think I'll just get a head start to class," he said. Draco was still too stunned by how the conversation had turned to follow, only snapping out of his stupor when he noticed Diggory standing and chasing Harry out of the hall.
then?!â he demanded, causing Harry to flinch. âHow dare you! You bloody know how much I love you! I donât matter to you more than random Aurors youâve not even met?! I canâtâI mean how am I supposed toâyou promised me!â
She nodded. âVery well. You and Harimâas you and now I refer to himâare, in many ways, separate entities. When you visit him in your mindspace, you are each a manifestation of your respective experiences and thus the memories of those experiences.
âYes you have! How dare you?! Youâd like to get me fired too, is that it?! What the hell am I supposed to give Skeeter?!â
This was followed by the sound of a sharp crack, like rock being split apart. Dracoâs breath was coming in shallow pants, and a glance at the Auror next to him revealed an upper lip pulled back in some mix of awe and disgust. He couldnât understand why in Merlinâs name they werenât stopping this right now. As soon as the thought crossed his mind, Not Fleur held up her index finger.
âIâm not trying to mark my territory or anything like that, so donât give me that look. But you need to understand something. I love him, and if you start up toying with his loyalties one more time, I will slice you from your neck to your bits and feed your innards to Mrs. Norris. Got it?â
Harry met his eyes again in surprise, and there was that look again. Harry was starting to think he knew what it was, but this was
Neville was doing his best to vanish. The rest of Gryffindor tower was being as quiet as possible, trying to pretend they all weren't hiding in corners or listening just outside their dorms, but Harry could hear the collective breathing in the too-hushed silence.
It was not even a full minute later that Harryâs luck abandoned him, and he was, quite literally, stuck regretting his decision. He had forgotten about the trick step, and his leg had sunk right through, trapping him. Worse, his golden egg had slipped out from under his arm and, in an attempt to catch it, heâd dropped the Marauderâs Map. Heâd managed to re-secure the invisibility cloak, but it hardly mattered. The egg had burst open on impact and was now wailing loudly in the corridor below him.
If he was honest, heâd assumed that Harimâs other friends werenât worth knowing, if based only on the limited memory and minimal interaction heâd had with them.
âOf course we did. You won didnât you?â she teased. Amjad rolled his eyes, but he didnât stop beaming until Harry and Ayesha had to leave.
"No! Iâwait. Huh?" Ron turned and scanned the area around them. Most had returned to their fun after Harry and Malfoy had left, but then there they were. A young blonde was twirling in the arms of the female Slytherin in a way that was decidedly non-platonic. As he watched, the blonde suddenly went up on her tiptoes and planted a brief kiss on the Slytherin girlâs lips, afterwhich they both blushed. Ron, once again, was gobsmacked.
A stab of fear hit Draco when he thought of the Mark on Severusâs arm, on his fatherâs arm. What was the last thing he had said to his father?
"Save it, Malfoy," interrupted Hermione. "I know you don't really believe any of that rubbish about blood."
Harry looked at him for a moment before a grin finally spread across his face. âYeah,â he said, and pressed his lips to Dracoâs again.
âI donât know how much good itâs actually doing,â he admitted afterwards. âBut yesterdayâ¦ I feel like maybe the more she understands the more we can see eye-to-eye, or something. Itâs justâ I hate drugging up everything from my past.â
âNothing much,â he answered truthfully. Heâd seen the blondâs place of work, and theyâd had that moment at Hogwartsâbut that felt too private to gossip about, really. Not to mention wrapped in things heâd rather not discuss. He gave her something else instead, taking the opportunity to seek friendly advice. âI wasâ¦ considering inviting him to Hermioneâs wedding, actually. She said it came with a plus-one, but I donât know if thatâs tooâ¦ you donât really invite your mates as a wedding date, I mean.â
Harry's mind seemed to go blank for a moment, his jaw was somewhere beneath him. What on earth kind of scheme was Malfoy playing at? Perhaps there was someone hiding with a camera somewhere, and Malfoy was trying to make Harry look bad now that people were no longer insulting him on his way to class. Well, Harry wouldn't have it. And he was tired of being mocked.
Draco had been waiting as close to the maze as possible, so he could immediately follow after the first polyjuiced Champion that came by. As it happened, it ended up being Fleur. He trailed herâat least he was assuming the Auror was actually a herâall the way to her position, and waited anxiously for the task to begin.
"Right." Harry sounded far more sure than he actually was, and, while Hermione's jaw tightened, she let the conversation drop with little more than a roll of her eyes.
She stared hard at him, as if searching his face for something. A moment later, she seemed to have found it, because her face smoothed deliberately. âWhat did you do with the story, Harry.â
A knot of apprehension formed in his gut as he swam, passing the underwater dwellings and faces of the merfolk that bore little resemblance to the beautiful depictions of mermaids Harry had ever seen. These, instead, were broken-toothed and wild looking, many clutching crude weapons. Harry continued swimming, doing his best not to look at them. That was when he came upon a sort of underwater village square, clusters of merfolk surrounding a giant statue in the middle. And tied to the statue were four people.
âDo youââ she started, but was interrupted by Cosimaâs sudden appearance. âDid you hear?â she asked Maria. Harryâs back straightened; she looked absolutely dejected.
. Which he had known. He stood, ignoring the looks his Housemates gave him along with those of the entire Great Hall. The only person who's eyes he met was Harry. There was a question there, of course, but he couldn't answer it just now. Merlin only knew what was about to happen.
Pansy looked slightly put out at this. "Oh fine," she said. "I dare you to... hmm. Go fetch my dearest."
Edgar bit his lip. âOh, uh, no, not really. I was only saying that because my big sister is one. Sheâsââ
Happy Monday you guys! Iâll be completely honest: I have been so nervous about posting this particular chapter. It has undergone more revising at than I think any previous chapter, because I just havenât been able to stop anxiously picking at it for some strange reason. (Also, itâs quite long, fair warning.) So Iâm almost relieved to finally be posting!
âShhhhhh,â Hermione and Harry both hissed at the same time. They each instinctively looked around then, double checking that no one was in the common room to overhear.
Harry and Ron were having a discussion with Neville about something, and Malfoy took his eyes off of Harry for a moment, long enough to notice that Hermione's eyes were on him. Her eyes met those of steel grey and she took the opportunity to attempt an encouraging smile. It had the opposite effect, and she watched as Malfoyâs eyes widened just slightly, seeming to say
this was actually the most emotional chapter for me to write so far and Iâm really happy with it. Harry Potter deserves nice things because I said so
âTheyâre making me Polyjuice as some Auror, the one whoâll be Polyjuiced as me,â Harry finally answered for himself. âI only get to show up after Voldemort makes a move.â
After a few sighs and halfhearted protests, the five of them were all sat down on the floor, crossed legged.
Harry ignored the way Ron's shoulders stiffened when Harry said Draco's given name, just as he had been ignoring him all through breakfast. Hermione placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. "It'll be alright," she said.
Hermione laughed, but immediately sobered. It didnât seem right to laugh in St. Mungos. She looked back down at her unconscious friend.
âSheâs got a point Nev,â Harry said. He and Draco knew perfectly well why Neville was still single, and it had nothing to do with choice.
The Slytherinâs smile lessened. âYou never talk about your family,â he said as though itâd only just then occurred to him.
To everyone who has left a comment or a kudos on this story I appreciate every single one of you, thank you so much for giving me motivation when I had almost none left. Much love.
âI think Iâll do truth,â Luna decided happily. Pansy sent a warning look in Blaiseâs direction that he ignored.
âThatâs different,â Draco insisted. Heâd dropped Harryâs hand, and his fingers felt cold at the loss. âYou know everything about my parents. All I know for certain about your family is that theyâre muggles.â
âNo,â he insisted. âBecause now I... Iâve had a lot of time to understand Draco. Thisâweek after week of just sitting here. Thatâs what you were afraid of, and
Maria grimaced. âUh, itâs more complicated than that. They both like each other still, donât let them fool you. But Josh doesnâtâ¦ do sex. Like, heâs just not into it? Heâd explain it better than I can, heâs very clear and open about it, so Iâm not telling you anything he wonât tell you himself. Except itâs a sore spot âcause he gets sort of shunned for it. So when Matt actually came onto him, well, the idiot convinced himself it was about the challenge or something, and you can see how that went.â
The Gryffindor glanced at the heavens for a moment before meeting his boyfriendâs eyes again. âIâve survived the summers so far.â
They found themselves on the ground within seconds, Harry mustâve followed Malfoy down, now rolling and kicking and hitting everywhere that could be reached. Magical means had been entirely set aside in favour of baser instincts. This made sense, Harry thought even through his haze of dark anger. This was familiar territory, fighting with Malfoy instead of playing nice with him. The violence almost felt like being back home, Malfoy hollering obscenities and trying to throw Harry off where he had him pinned, throwing punch after punch. Â It wasnât all that long before they were roughly pried apart by an invisible force and held there, an absolutely livid Professor Clark pointing her wand at them.
"Oh," said Draco eloquently. "Well, in that case, um, thank you. IâI'm glad that we're friends. Merlin knows I could use someone to talk to that actually pays attention in classes."
âOr not,â she was swift to add. âWe could just visit Remus here more. Amjad would be happy, and Iâm sure Dumbledore doesnât mind.â
She groaned at the sudden ache in her bones. When she opened her eyes, Draco gave her an apologetic look. "I'm sorry to tell you, you slept on the floor."
It was extremely lucky, Harry thought to himself, that heâd spent significant time in muggle London. All the entrances to the wizarding world were the same, so once heâd pinpointed exactly where his flat was, it had been simple to find the nearest one to it. And from there, the information about Neville had held up.
âOh Neville,â said Hermione as she reached over to hug him, heartbroken for her friend. âIâm so sorry I never knew.â
Because, Harry, all people are who they are due to their knowledge base and formative occurrences. What we perceive and go through build our preferences, solidify our fears, desires, intentions, aspirations, you name it. This, as well as all the many reasons why we behave as we do in accordance to certain positive or negative stimuli.
Harry put the paper down and sighed, pocketing the rest of his mail to put off reading any more negativity and resting his head in his hands for a second before looking back up at his friends. Ron hadn't spoken to him since before the Ball, and Harry doubted he'd start now. Hermione, though, was eyeing him with deep concern.
"Butâyeah okay." He apparently didn't have the energy to protest, as he laid back down in the next second and slid over some to give Harry space. Usually, if he slept here, Harry would transfigure a bed for himself or borrow a space from one of the handful of Slytherins who nodded off in the common room or elsewhere, but tonight he didn't want to.
It took a while to get away from all of his relieved, rowdy visitors, but finally his mother got all of them to leave. Harry didnât even have to ask, Dracoâs mum simply apparated all three of them to the Manor.
Oh by the way, I forgot to say thank you guys so much when I passed the 500 kudos mark. This story is almost at 550 now, and it really means so much to me. Thank you to everyone following this story and being so endlessly patient with me all this time. And, as always, I love reading your comments and appreciate those of you that do so very much. This story has been such a blast for me to write because of all of you and I hope you enjoy whatâs to come!
Draco reached up to touch his beloved hair, staring at one of his best mates in horror. âYou canât be serious.â
Miss Granger! Thirty more points from Gryffindor House! There is no fixing such a disgraceful muck up. Now be quiet and do as you are told!â
While they had been talking, Neville had introduced the headlinerâa band of boys led by a female singer with coloured hair, who were welcomed with a healthy level of enthusiasmâand then exited just as planned.
âConsider Harim. One has to wonder if he, however unintendedly, assumes he lacks the coping skills to abide your particular traumas. So perhaps he occludes not only to keep his memories in his sole possession, but so that he can avoid confronting yours any further than he has already. All the while telling himself his change in tactic is to spite youâ¦ Itâs speculation, of course this is all speculation, but it is undoubtedly sensical.â
