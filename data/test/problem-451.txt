Her brows drew together in confusion. “Why?”
“Thanks,” said Draco, breathless.
“Fine by me.” Harry didn’t miss the look she shared with Draco.
“Dobby, could you please take these and buy us a friendship making kit?”
I’m writing to share some news. I wish the following contents of this letter could be shared in person, however, I thought about waiting until the summer but decided I couldn’t wait any longer.
The house elf looked just about to burst into tears at Harry’s gratitude and bounded away with renewed enthusiasm as it was. What a peculiar creature, Harry thought as he followed Draco.
“You helped Black get into Hogwarts. You want Harry dead. You’ve been helping Black this whole time.” Harry had never heard Draco’s voice so dead and cold.
"You suck Parkinson," He sighed, letting his head fall back against the arm of the sofa. "Honestly Blaise, thank you. I might pass now." He said, yawning.
“So that’s it? He’s going to Durmstrang?” Draco asked.
“She has a point,” Ron said.
“You were,” she insisted. “ What did she ever do to you?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall. She didn’t look too happy though Harry suspected it was because Gryffindor was out of the running for the cup for the eighth year in a row. Slytherin had a great chance of winning if they won, which Harry was determined to do.
Harry’s knees grew wobbly. The story made no sense at all. How could Scabbers be Pettigrew? But twelve years was a very long life for a rat, even a magic one. And Scabbers was missing a toe on his front paw. Just the way the only thing they’d been able to find of Peter had been a finger. Harry’s blood ran cold as everything Lupin and Black told them started to add up. Draco, Pansy, Hermione, Ron and Harry all exchanged looks of distrust and unease as Black explained how he’d tracked down Pettigrew, how he’d seen the picture of the Weasley’s in the Daily Prophet, how there, on Ron’s shoulder, had been Scabbers.
“Then they don’t like you.”
“Mother is that you?” called out Draco’s familiar voice. He appeared at the top of the staircase, one hand on the banister. “You look green, Potter. First time apparating?”
Harry and Draco sat at the Slytherin table the next morning whispering between each other.
Draco, unashamed, took a shot.
Hoping maybe he was just sleepy, Harry took a shower. When he got out he changed into a pair of fresh boxers and the same sweater Draco had let him borrow from the evening of truth or dare. He’d kind of stolen it and made it his own. He didn’t usually wear a top to bed anymore, choosing to sleep without one, but he didn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable since they shared a bed. He’d taken the cue of wearing a top from Draco who slept in boxers and a baggy tshirt.
Draco growled. “Oh you are so dead, Potter.”
Harry scoffed. "No."
“I’m trying to make a profit.”
Harry was about to pull Draco in for a kiss to tease Blaise when he caught sight of Pansy and a boy who must’ve been Adam descending the stairs. He had broad shoulders and straight black hair. He moved with a lithe grace that reminded Harry of the way Draco moved.
Things started out fairly tame.
Harry knew how hard Draco was on himself, how deeply he loved and cared for his friends, how much he doubted their love in return. His chest filled with determination to show the other boy how worthy he was.
“Piss off,” he said, glaring harder.
A heavy feeling settled in Harry’s stomach and he swallowed hard. “Oh.”
The first encounter Harry has with Dobby he almost wets his pants. Draco had just finished showing Harry the rest of the manor when they walked into a fourth living room (“Draco, under what circumstances is having four bloody living rooms necessary?”), this one had green, silver and earth toned colour scheme.
“Muggles are so funny,” Draco said to Harry. “They strap these pieces of wood to their feet and launch themselves down snow-covered mountains because they claim that it’s fun. You know, some strap both feet to one piece of wood. What’s the name for that again?”
The next thing Draco knew he was closing his eyes and leaning in. The kiss was hot and fast and desperate. Griffin pushed Draco’s back up against the shelf and Draco thought his heart might burst from his chest. He, Draco Lucius Malfoy, was kissing a boy. A boy was kissing him.
Theo cackled. “She might actually kill you, Zabini.”
Harry voiced Draco's thoughts. "They're dead." So were Harry's eyes. The other boy was looking away from him now and out the window. They were flying through the country.
Pansy averted her eyes and looked down at his hand in hers. She pressed down on the last nail on his right hand and started on his left. “I knew it was going to happen. They stopped living together like a year ago.”
“I found it,” Harry whispered to Ron.
“Might as well.”
“How do you know?’
(See the end of the chapter for
“Like a week ago?” Harry shrugged casually, fiddling with his quill.
“What’s wrong?”
“You seem eager.” She wasn’t really in the mood to do nails right now. She mostly just wanted to have to evening to wallow in self pity. Maybe a distraction was what she needed right now though? Not only that but despite his pot habits Pansy found that for some irrational reason she had a soft spot for Theodore. He often got on her nerves but he was rather charismatic and they’d known each other for ages.
Theo’s eyes narrowed at the possessiveness of the gesture. “Yes, delightful,” he said, forcing a smile.
The other boys frown deepened. "I don't know what you mean."
“We should have said something.” Harry sat down hard in a chair in the library, across from Ron.
“Why are you upset?” Draco kept his eyes forward and lips pressed together, picking up his pace. “Draco, talk to me!”
There was that name again. Theo voiced Harry’s thoughts, “Who’s Adam?” He asked, brows furrowed.
Draco’s whole body was rigid. “I’m not.”
“Who could perform that, and why?”
"She's a mudblood."
She gave him a watery smile. “I’d love to go to the Ball with you, Harry.”
“You barely wrote to me all summer!” Draco heard Pansy exclaim as he got closer with his mother.
The moment he pushed open the dormitory door Harry snatched his coat up from the back of his desk chair and struggled to put his arms through before he realized it was inside out. As Harry turned it right side out he rummaged through Draco’s things trying to find his green and grey striped scarf. It wasn’t on his desk so maybe it was in his trunk. Pulling the thing out from under Draco’s four poster bed Harry tossed back the lid and dug around. Spotting the scarf, Harry grabbed it and pulled as he stood. He was in quite a hurry to not hold up his friends any later than he already had.
Theo scoffed. “No, not me-”
When he came to the top of the landing he saw them. Griffin moved from kissing the other boy to sucking at Draco’s neck and all Harry could do was stare at Draco’s blushing face. His eyes were closed but they flashed open the moment Harry stepped on a creaky floor board. The second their eyes met Draco pushed Griffin away. But it was too late, Harry had seen.
“She gave another guy a blowey?”
They sat quietly as she did another one.
“Can you ask your father?” Harry asked Draco.
“WHAT?” Merlin, was Draco ever confused right now. He felt like there was something lost on him.
"Snape says we get to test it at the end of the class." Draco seemed genuinely encompassed and interested in this. The other boys definitely had more motivation academically, particularly in potions, than Harry felt he himself had.
“Course he does,” Harry said, smirking.
“Look, I really do appreciate your concern but-”
So he stared out the window and thought about other things, desperately trying to think of anything other than the voice in his head insisting that Harry would be happier with him.
“I think my poor mother nearly had a heart attack when both of you came down in your boxers,” Draco told them, looking at Harry, an affectionate glint in his eyes.
“I’ll go tell her brothers now,” Minerva McGonagall was saying, solemnly. “They’re all in Gryffindor.”
“Where are you going?”
Theo smirked, winking at the woman when he kissed the hand she’d extended to him. “That would be me.”
“You’re Harry Potter. You’ll figure it out.”
“Well, try it on then?”
Harry sat as still as he could as Pansy stared at his face, tongue between her lips in concentration. He felt creams and powers go on. Then there was the section he had to close his eyes for which wasn’t much fun. The whole time the truth or dare was still going on.
“That boy is going to ruin his lungs,” Pansy said, disapprovingly, shaking her head when he was out of hearing range.
I'll write again soon. Sirius
Lockhart went, if possible, even paler, all blood draining from his face. “There we have it then,” said McGonagall. “Your skills, after all, are legend.”
“But I didn’t get you anything,” Draco mumbled as he stared in awe at the parcel Harry handed to him.
Harry hummed. “I’ll be fast.”
“I’m not letting you anywhere near him you lunatic,” Draco spat, holding Harry close to him, shielding him from Lockhart protectively.
He hears the door open and violently startles. Draco wipes at his face fast, but he knows it’s no use. His eyes are probably red from crying. He looks up to see Pansy’s worried face. At least it isn’t any of the boys.
“Whatever you want.” Harry shrugged.
Not wanting to face that right now he tried to distract himself with the casual conversation being passed around in the compartment between the rest of his friends. Unable to focus on that he instead thought of the expression he imagined would come to his aunt and uncles faces when he told them he had a godfather, a convicted murderer at large, who liked to check in on him to make sure he was happy.
Harry leaned to see out the window. Theo was pointing at a rather beautiful woman with smooth dark skin and deep brown hair that fell in tight curls around her face. She was tall and willowy with small breasts and an hourglass figure. She rich blue robes that fell from her shoulders and hung from her frame in glittering swafts of fabric.
They continued the truth or dare until Pansy got back and she sat herself on the low wooden table in the middle of all the sofas and chairs, facing Harry. “What kind of look should I do?”
“How would that have helped?” Draco demanded, passing back and forth.
"Harry, darling, a boy who is both smart and good in the sheets shouldn't be that hard to come by."
Draco was distracted from Theo’s pouting when Harry came up beside him, and said in a voice that only he could hear, “Sirius wrote to me.”
Draco stared at him, eyes round. The other boy was suddenly speechless. They stood in silence. Harry expected any reaction except the way he actually did.
“And? And, what?” he demanded.
“I don’t know. But we should have. The teachers could have done something.”
"Her Skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever."
“Maybe it doesn’t matter if you don’t do well?” Theo asked. “I mean, what do you want to do after Hogwarts?”
Draco slipped onto a staircase just as it detached and Harry blew a kiss and watched the other boy roll his eyes. A smile on his face. Harry fell back to walk with Blaise and watched Theo give Pansy a long languid kiss on the mouth in front of her class.
“You have to, unless you want to fail,” Blaise said.
“It was pretty alright,” Blaise said, sinking into his seat and opening a thick, leather bound book.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m tired and freezing,” whined Harry.
For the rest of lunch Flint would throw the apple and Harry would race after it and bring it back. It was Flint who tired first. "Merlin's hairy balls Potter how are you still going? My arm is aching." But the other boy was giving him an appreciative look. "Do you know much about quidditch Potter?"
“I don’t know what you’re ask-”
Pansy snorted and Harry shook his head, lips pressed together tightly. "Thanks Malfoy I'm honoured," he scoffed.
“Er- because the french have that greeting where you kiss each others cheeks? And just about all the girls I’ve met from Beauxbatons wore lipstick?”
Harry blinked in the dark. “Wait, isn’t this your room?”
“Yes, Griffin’s been studying the subject, he thinks he’ll go into a related field when he gets out of school. The issue is that there’s limited resources on the finer details.”
The night ended up being great fun because they had a few cups of eggnog, as they were making their rounds and talking to all the guests who’d come to the party, before they realised it contained alcohol. At this point they wandered up to Draco’s room to crash because they were feeling a mixture of tipsy and sleepy.
By the end of the evening Harry could barely hear the music had been so loud, his feet were sore from standing so long and he was two seconds away from losing it with Theo and Adam. The whole night had been a testosterone battle between the two boys. It was exasperating to watch them go at it. Harry had just wanted a fun night with his best mates before the start of a new school year but so far he’d hardly been able to focus on anything else over Theo and Adam’s passive aggressive bickering.
“Because you’re all sweaty, Potter, and the silk pyjamas are expensive. Besides, you’ll be less hot in these.” Harry knew Draco was trying to tease him but he could still hear the worried note in his voice. “Come on, get in bed already,” Draco said, yawning.
Harry felt caught off guard and popped a sherbert lemon into his mouth to give himself more time to think of an answer. He hadn't honestly thought of that too much. Sure, he thought some of the girls at Hogwarts were pretty he just didn’t have an automatic answer . “Er- I don’t know. I suppose Mandy Brockelhurst is rather fit?”
At arms length he held what he’d believed to be Ron’s rat, Scabbers, for the last three years by the tail. He squirmed furiously, trying to escape. Harry held tight and listened as Lupin stood in front of Sirius Black, defending the man, and explained that the rat between his fingers was not a rat at all but a wizard by the name of Peter Pettigrew.
She glared at Theodore accusingly. “You startled me.”
But this is just Harry, why does Draco feel this way. A feeling of heavy dread settles over Draco as realization hits him over the head. No no no no no. Harry’s his best friend, just his best friend. They’re close, sure, like friends are. His heart is pounding. Merlin, why did Harry have to go and get buff. Then Harry’s eyes meet his and Draco knows with sinking certainty.  Nope. No way. He’s just a closeted gay harmonal teenager. That’s what this is. He’ll just hook up with some random guy in a bathroom. That’s all he needs. There’s no way he has feelings for Harry.
Pansy pressed her lips together in obvious discomfort. “He doesn’t mean it. He’s just scared.”
“Sorry, my Aunt and Uncle made me lock up Hedwig,” Harry said apologetically.
“I really just wanted to thank you Mrs Malfoy for letting me stay over for Christmas,” Harry said, turning to face her.
“My mother just bought a new house in Poland so I suspect we’ll be spending most of our time there,” Blaise said, yawning. Harry wanted to laugh because of how flippant Blaise was about his mother buying a new house. He wondered if Blaise knew it was usual for most families to only own one house.
Harry hesitated for only a moment before handing over the thrashing rat. Lupin took him and looked to Black. “Together?” Black nodded and stepped forward, holding up the wand he’d taken from Draco in the struggle when they’d first entered the Shrieking Shack.
Draco pulled a face. “You’ve defeated Voldemort, what? three times now? You can handle some Dementors.”
Draco rolled his eyes but gave Harry an affectionate look.
“This is the best vodka any of you will ever have in your life. This is premium stuff, guys.” He took a long sip and passed it to Harry. It burned his throat and made his eyes water. He handed it off to Draco who raised his eyebrows but took a long chug too. They passed the vodka around as Draco showed them the kitchens and dining rooms, all the bedrooms and sitting rooms.
Theo was particularly miserable to be around for the last week of summer. He spent the days by himself instead of with them, wandering aimlessly around the house, sulking, leaving rooms when others came in.
They laughed together. "I'm gay, or bi, I don't know. Either way I have my eyes set on someone else."
“Shut the bleeding door!” Draco moaned, chucking a pillow at Theo.
The door swung open, “You’re here!” She shrieked with happiness, cutting off Theo and knocking him back by the force of Pansy throwing her arms around his neck.
"Harry you looked charming in your robes," said Pansy out of nowhere. "The tie really brings out your eyes."
Then most frightening of all, Sirius Black had attacked the Fat Lady at the entrance of the Gryffindor common room. Hermione and Draco figured he’d thought Harry was in Gryffindor because that’s what James and Lily had been sorted into. After this the school talked of little else besides the attack and Sirius Black’s brilliance at first being able to escape Azkaban and then his ability to get into Hogwarts even with the Dementors stationed outside and Dumbledore’s presence.
“I did! Many times actually!” Draco exclaimed loudly, waving his arms around in the air wildly, startling a group of first years who promptly scurried off to their dorm. “My father will hear about this,” he started muttering under his breath to himself as he stalked toward their dormitory. “I’ll go write them a letter now. The ministry has to listen to reason…”
"Don't even tempt me, Potter. We both know that even if I was seriously serious you wouldn't take me up."
Harry groaned and lay down on the sofa, putting his head in Pansy’s lap. He closed his eyes when she started stroking his hair. It felt particularly good because she had long fake nails. Harry wasn’t sure he was a big fan of them, they were sort of scary, except in moments like these.
“Yeah,” Harry said to them from beside him. He’d had a few conversations with them both before but nothing too lengthy. He’d played wizards chess with Ron before with Harry and studied last year with Hermione a bit. They were both clever. “We’re not going to learn a single thing from him.”
"I was just wondering what your plans were for Christmas."
Harry ran a hand through his hair, he was annoyed about how much he cared for Draco’s well being even now. “Draco, you could get hurt-”
The last presents he had to open were from Draco. There was a small stack of them, all wrapped neatly. He picked up the long narrow on first and riped of the shiny paper.
"Well I wasn't."
“Don’t think about it that way.” Harry poured himself a little more eggnog and whiskey. As disorienting as it was having almost no depth perception or balance anymore the alcohol filled him with a bubbly warmth.
“Well I think we have a few books in our library on the matter. Draco could you take Griffin and show him?” Mrs Malfoy asked her son.
“We’re best friends!”
Claudette put her hands on his shoulders. “Tell him.” It sounded so easy when she said it like that.
He checked the golden ticket Hagrid had given him once again. It hadn't changed since the last time he'd looked, which had been minutes ago. Only what he saw still didn't add up. The ticket told him he should be waiting at a platform 9 and 3/4. Craning his neck Harry spotted a platform 9 and a platform 10, however nothing in between.
After Theodore left the girls dorm, very proud of his long pink sparkly fake nails, Pansy felt calmer. She wasn’t totally okay. It would take some time to accept and come to terms with her parents separation but already the weight that had been sitting on her chest felt a little lighter.
“Hmm, truth.”
“‘We’re?’”
"Come, Draco dearest, we must get you to the platform before the train departs. The Hogwarts Express isn't waiting for anyone."
Of all the people he had to fall for it just had to be his best friend.
“What should I tell the staff?”
Blaise pressed his lips together, his revulsion clear. “So you’re wearing a piss coloured shirt to spite Draco?”
“Fine, fine, I will I just have to- Bloody hell! Get back here, Cupcake!”
“Yeah, but she’s got a nice pair of-” Pansy coughed loudly, interrupting Theo who rolled his eyes and motioned to his chest (as if the other boys hadn’t already caught on to what he was getting at).
Bursting through the common room entrance he almost knocked down a pair of second years. “Sorry!” he blurted, not bothering to so much as slow down on his way to his dorm.
“I would never say that.” He could tell Griffin was about to make another witty retort so he said, “Here we are,” and pushed open the large library double doors.
"Mind if we join you?" A girl with glossy black hair up at the front of the group asked. "Everywhere else is full."
Draco tried to keep his eyes away from Harry but they kept wandering. “This game is boring, let's play something else.” He racked his brain. “Never have I ever?”
“Bloody shut up, Malfoy.”
Dearest Pansy,
“Are you two going to just stand there bickering?” Harry and Draco turned to see Theo smirking as he strolled toward the manor, a familiar glint in his eyes.
Draco nodded approvingly. “Proud of you.”
“Don’t be silly, Potter. You can just use some of mine.” Draco opened the drawer of his vanity table and selected a pair. “Here, these match your eyes.” He reached for Harry’s sleeves and kept his eyes down on the cufflinks, they really were a very pretty emerald, so he wouldn’t look up at Harry even though he could have put them on in his sleep. “I can’t believe you forgot the reason you came to my room in the first place,” he chuckled as he finished.
"Father says they just put a hat on your head-"
“I’ll let them know.” Draco left the room a few moments later and Harry fell into step with him.
“Harry, darling, it’s just too painful. Besides, I have to write the same essay but all my things are up in my rooms.” Pansy stood and pushed in her chair.
"Because a boy named Neville seems to have lost- hold on! You're Harry Potter! I've read all about you. I'm Hermione Granger."
“You know it’s okay to not be good at everythi-” Harry was suddenly blinking cold snow out of his eyes. “What was that for?!”
“You think it’s hoOoOOt,” Draco teased in a sing song voice that was entirely too cute.
Harry tilted his head and bit the inside of his cheek. “How are you so chill about this?”
“Hey!” Draco looked genuinely offended.
"Prick," Harry mumbled under his breath but did as he was told. When Harry got back to the table he pushed all the ingredients in front of Draco. "Your Highness."
"You should go to sleep." Draco gave him a pointed look.
“Okay, so Harry we were just talking. Who do you think the hottest girl in our year is?” Theo asked, tossing him a pack of sherbert lemons.
“What a nice young polite gentleman!” Mrs Clemonte said to his mother who gave her a small smile in return.
Draco nodded. There was a slight sting in his chest but he knew Harry had gone through enough as it was today without having to talk about how he felt for Draco. “Fair enough.” He waited for Harry to crawl back under the covers before he switched back off the light. When Harry snuggled into his arms any of Draco’s remaining tension ebbed away.
Harry spoke over him, “He wants you to come up to his villa in Italy for the summer! Do you know why? Well, that’s a dumb question of course you do. You’ve read the letter. You know he wants to court you. Do you think he’s already sat down for lunch with your father to as for your hand in marriage? Do you think he’s gone to tea with your mother to pick out the-”
“Thanks, Pans.” The words came out uneven and broken. He found he had the urge to cry again, for a different reason this time. He was so grateful to have her as a friend.
"I don't really remember them." Harry shrugged.
“Well, the truth. Tell them that Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, the chamber of secrets has been reopened.”
For all our sakes, Pansy, Harry begged her in his head, please say it would be weird. Theo was staring daggers out the window and Harry worried he might shatter the glass.
Harry kept his eyes down. “What’s your favourite colour?”
“Of course, Pans. You’re wonderful,” he said, smiling down at her as he wiped away the fresh tears on her cheeks. “The only reason anyone might think any of those things about you is because they don’t know you. That’s their loss.”
"Are they magic?"
“I’m wearing shoes.”
“Just because her preference in men is kinda influenced by how many Galleons he’s got in his gringott vault and Harry, even though you dress like you’re homeless we all know you’re loaded.”
Pansy stopped running her fingers through his hair long enough to give him a sharp look. “There’s a difference between getting laced every once and awhile and walking around high most of the time like Theodore does.”
Harry shared a look with Blaise and Draco, silently communicating that they’d stay with Theo while he followed Pansy. Easier said than done. It took him half an hour to find the girl. He found her fuming on the winding steps leading up to a tower. Tears tracked down her cheeks.
She grit her teeth. “You’re right,” she ground out. “I’m not.” With that she sat up, stiff as a rode, and stormed from the room.
"That doesn't mean it didn't happen."
“Bring it, Malfoy,” Harry challenged.
“Come on, Pansy.” They found McGonagall who wanted them to stand at the Great Hall entrance with the rest of the competitors.
But he couldn’t not tell them. He’d always gotten along with his parents and they’d always been able to work out their differences in the past.
“So?”
Harry brushed her long hair back from her face. “I’m so sorry. If there’s anything I can do to make anything easier please promise you’ll let me know ?”
What, you’re seriously contemplating this? I’m surprised. I thought the automatic answer would be Pansy since she’s the girl,” said Theo. “You’d kiss one of us guys?
“Opposed to what?”
“Mon amour. Ma chérie. T’es canon, toi,” (my love, my dear, you’re hot) Draco whispered sweetly.
“You were a total tosser about it!” Draco sniggered. “Every time I brought up Claudette you got prickly and rude!”
“Merlin, what do I do now, Pans?” he asked, looking at her with pleading eyes.
“I- I beg your pardon?” Lockhart sputtered, face gone pale.
Pansy laughed wetly as tears slipped down her cheeks. “You know Theodore I’m here for you too. I know I’m just the uptight bossy bitch who goes off on you about getting high but I care about you being happy too.” She pulled him into a hug and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, firm beneath her touch. He held on to her tightly and Pansy closed her eyes. Theodore was a steady comforting presence and she felt more solidly anchored now, breathing in his weirdly comforting blend of lemony fresh shampoo and cigarette smoke clinging to his clothes, than she had in a long time.
Pansy’s face fell. “Well, fuck.”
The desk he was sitting on in the empty classroom they were using was uncomfortable but not so uncomfortable that he wanted to stop what they were doing.
Now Harry was really intrigued. “Your what now?”
“Evidently.” Mouth pressed into a hard line McGonagall walked away.
Harry shook his head hesitantly. Marcus stared at him a heartbeat longer, seeming to consider him. "You," he pointed at Malfoy. "Come down here and give me your broom. Potter, throw down that apple." Draco looked confused, and a bit ticked off to be told what to do but obliged. Soon Marcus was hovering a few feet away from him. "Go long okay?" The older boy ordered more than asked.
“Neon-”
“Blaise, truth or dare?” Draco asked.
“Nah, Gryffindor’s gonna own your ass.”
Harry was confused. “Then… What’s the problem? Kiss and make up. Easy peasy.”
“Why not?”
Draco watched as Harry rounded the corner, laughing at something Cedric Diggory was telling him. Jealousy flashed through him. He mentally berated himself. Harry was allowed to talk to other people. He had to stop being weird.
Harry snorted. “Definitely. I’d trip over my feet otherwise. It’d be a spectacle, what a nightmare.”
“What’s going on?” Harry wondered.
“Are you going to tell them?”
Draco’s face twisted with anger.  He sneered, “I WILL NOT-”
He leaned against the compartment door frame. Harry didn’t miss the way Theo tensed up. “Blake Westenhaver. I’m in seventh year, Ravenclaw,” the older boy smiled. He was good looking with a sharp jawline and long brown hair that he kept having to push back from his face. Whenever he did this the silver rings on his fingers flashed.
“Yeah, but he’s really powerful,” Nott suggested. “So maybe that makes up for it.”
He spent the rest of the holidays trailing Pansy, unless she was with Draco. When she wasn’t the two of them spent a lot of time cuddling while she read or making out.
“I’m coming. End of discussion. What’s the plan?” Harry sucked on the inside of his cheek. He hadn’t gotten that far. “Of course you don’t have one.” Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed.  “Good thing I already do.”
Harry chuckled. “Fair enough. I will admit though, I like your hair better in the morning. You know, when it isn’t gelled back?”
“Cheer up, Harry,” Pansy told him, throwing her legs up over his. “What’s that?” she asked, pointing out the train window. Draco got up and opened it and a little owl flew in, landing in Harry’s lap. There was a letter addressed to him in the birds talons. Taking it and ripping it open he read:
Pansy laughed coldly. “Yeah,” she nodded, glancing up at Harry. Her eyes were wet again. “He did.” She scoffed. “He’s right. I’m not his girlfriend.”
“You cold over there, Parkinson?”
“It’s not marijuana is it, Theodore?” asked Pansy.
The next thing he knew he was bursting out through the barrier and staring at the gleaming Hogwarts Express. He couldn't help but be impressed. His attention was dragged away from the gleaming scarlet train when his Father clapped a hand across his back.
“He’s clearly in love with you!” Harry exclaimed, sounding half hysterical. “I didn’t think it could get worse. Now things are significantly worse. He’s gone. He’s dead and everything’s falling apart!”
“Put him here,” said Pomfrey in a worried voice. “What happened?”
Blaise nodded. “I’ll see if my Mother can look into it.”
He let out a choked laugh. “Yeah, yeah, I think I might be.”
“The way I look at him, like a best friend?”
He averts his eyes from hers. His eyes catch on a moving photo Harry has beside his bed of the three of them. They’re laughing. What if Pansy tells Harry? What if Harry’s disgusted? But he can’t just not tell them anymore. They’re his best friends.
“Well, was it good?” Draco asked, squirming.
“Heavens, no,” Draco scoffed, wrinkling his nose at the thought in distaste.
“Goodnight Draco.”
"You know you aren't half bad Potter-"
Harry stared at the parchment a bit longer but still didn’t understand. Were they pulling his leg? “I don’t get it. It’s just a bit of old parchment.”
“But what does this mean, Albus?” asked Minerva McGonagall.
Just then new footsteps echoed from the other side of the corridor. “My apologies for my tardiness,” said Lochhart. “What have I missed?”
“People have died in the Triwizard Tournament before, as I’m sure you’ve heard-”
“This is insane,” Griffin said, wide eyed as he moved to the closest shelf and ran his finger along the spines of the books. Draco was fixated by the movement of the other boys finger. They were long and thin, similar to his own, fingers like that were good for playing the piano or violin. Draco blinked, he had to snap out of it. “Which is your favourite?”
“Me? Joke?” he scoffed and waved his hand dismissively. “Never!”
An idea came to him. “Do you want to go with me?”
“Well..I’m actually going with Claudette,” said Draco.
“And also my mother?” Blaise scoffed.
The first brush of their lips was gentle, hesitant. Harry gasped softly, his mouth fell open, lips parting. Draco’s tongue dragged across his lower lip and heat blossomed in Harry’s chest. Their kissing grew deeper and deeper, sending delicious shudders through him. He tasted like rain and salty tears. Goosebumps broke out across his skin. Harry gave himself up to Draco’s hot opening lips. The way he kissed drove every last thought from Harry’s head.
"And when were you going to tell me?"
The Malfoy’s shared a puzzled look but didn’t try to argue with him any further on the matter. Over the rest of the winter break Harry ended up managing to corral a very unwilling and stubborn Draco into helping Dobby prepare a few of their meals.
Harry snorted as he laughed and cried at the same time. “Yeah, who’d have thought?” He said, self deprecating, rolling his eyes at himself.
“I refuse to give you yellow or orange nails. Pick any other colour,” she told him, grimacing.
Reigning his thoughts in he began to reply, "In a way-"
“Yes, of course, mother. I swear if I’d known-”
Pansy wrinkled her nose in disgust. “Where do you even get it?”
“Right, of course. Always my favourite part of the year.”
“He is not!” She squealed.
“I mean, I’d guess so.”
“Serves him right,” Pansy scoffed, “disgusting toad of a boy.” They were all gathered in the Slytherin boys dormitory, listening to Pansy tell them what had happened once she’d gone along with McGonagall to her office. ”I mean, sure, he’s not that bad looking, but Merlin, what a slimy git.”
After that Harry had someone managed to convince Professor Lupin to give him Anti-Dementor lessons starting the next term. With this promise he felt much more reassured, he couldn’t continue fainting because of the Dementors. It was embarrassing and inconvenient because no one else seemed to be as affected by them as he was.
“So what if I am?” challenged the weedy boy, bringing the joint to his lips again.
“What if you’re wrong?”
“Potter, he always gets so moody when I’m around,” she giggled. “I was pleasantly surprised he was even alright with you taking me to the Ball.”
It was incredibly weird having the whole bed to himself, weird to not have to fight for the blankets. He was actually annoyed with himself by how hard he found it to fall asleep with the ringing silence, no deep breathing to lull him to sleep.
“I can’t watch anymore.” Blaise stood, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Anyone else coming?”
“I was not!” Harry exclaimed.
Dumbleore stepped forward to look at the cat. “She is not dead Argus, but petrified. This is dark magic, darker than anything a second year student could manage. Professor Sprout?”
"I don't think you should say stuff like that about people. Or call them rude names."
“They can wait a little longer,” interrupted Draco, feeling more angry. Harry had no good reason to feel hurt right now he didn’t get to be upset. “Why are you avoiding me?” The vulnerability he felt leaked through into his voice when he spoke.
“What are you playing at?” A boy demanded, looking at Harry angrily.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, already missing the feel of Draco wrapped around him. “I just have to get my coat from the dorms.”
Ron shuddered. “I can't believe you-know-who controlled her through a diary.”
Harry made a face. “I’ll leave the Galleons on your bed.”
Blaise slammed down his shot glass. “Fuck astronomy!”
“This is ridiculous. Harry isn’t even a pureblood.” That seemed to stump them a bit.
“How eloquently put, Malfoy,” Harry grunted.
Draco dropped his quill, clenched his hands into fists and squeezed his eyes shut. No. The thought of them being that revolted by him was too painful. He was their son. Their only son. His father bragged about him to family friends and colleagues and teased him with affection in his eyes. They had inside jokes and made faces at each other behind his mother's back when she was going off and not looking at them. His mother gave the best hugs and spoke of him with such pride to guests. She soothingly stroked his hair back from his face when he was stressed or sick and gossiped with him about her pompous self-absorbed ‘friends’. They went out for family dinners and had tea and brunch and cocktail parties together. They played polo and board games and had puzzle nights.
Harry stopped packing long enough to glare at the other boy. “I’m actually serious. What if they decide they don’t want you to be friends with me anymore?”
First Year
“Huh?”
“Was this summer as good for everyone else as it was for me?” Theo asked, cockily.
“What?”
“My father’s probably in his study and my mother’s probably in her sitting room. They don’t really do Christmas. Usually if we want something we just get it, instead of waiting for one day.” Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that. “Want some more eggnog? Last night was a lot more fun with it.” Draco left the room and came back with two glasses, the eggnog and a bottle of pure malt whiskey. They spent the morning slowly getting tipsy, busting into fits of laughter while they opened all the gifts.
Harry turned to his other friends. “How do I look?” he asked, winking jokingly.
Harry tried to keep his eyes down on his cards but the way Draco eating a nectarine was more distracting than it should have been.
“Narcissa,” Dumbledore tried to address her again, “he is not back however-”
Harry thought that was a rather odd opener. "Why are you looking for one?"
Harry nodded and glanced over in Draco's direction. His face was twisted up into a sour expression. Harry wanted to ask what was wrong but not with Blaise still around.
“I didn’t know it was anything out of the ordinary,” Harry confessed, and Draco believed him. “Besides,” Harry went on, “I’ve only done it once before when I set a boa constrictor on my cousin at the zoo.” Draco raised his eyebrows at his best mate. “What? It’s not like I did it on purpose!”
"If you want, I can share my notes?" Blaise offered. "We could go over them and quiz each other?"
Draco stared at Harry. "Us". Draco felt so relieved. Harry still wanted to be his friends. He nodded. The compartment door crashed open for a second time and for a moment Draco thought Hermione had returned. However, this time a small crowd of students came in.
Harry chuckled and leaned back against the rug. Close enough that his leg touched Draco’s. He liked that the other boy didn’t pull away. It was probably just because of the whiskey, Harry reasoned.
“That letter isn’t what you think it is.”
“No no no no no.” Draco buried his head in his hands, between his knees. He couldn’t like Harry and he told Claudette as much.
"I'm not going anywhere Pansy."
“It’s for his own good.” Narcissa watched her boys laughing.  “Surely you want what’s best for Harry.”
“You’ll read it for me first right?” Harry asked Draco. “Because we both love Pansy but we both know she knows fuck all about herbology.”
That seemed to shut him up.
Harry grinned. “Yeah, we are.”
Harry snorted. His eyes flicked up to Draco’s, hopefully. “So you’re not going to Italy with Clemonte this summer?”
"My name is Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
The other boy was very much not naked, instead dressed in deep red dress robes, as he turned back around to face his mirror and lean in very close as he powdered a pimple near his hairline.
Harry nibbled gently at Draco’s neck in that way he knew drove the other boy crazy. Draco swore and dug his fingers into Harry’s skin a little harder. Harry grinned against Draco’s skin at how responsive the other boy was to even the slightest touch. “Would it be so bad if they did?”
Draco had started stirring when Harry muttered, "How are we even supposed to know if it works?"
Draco eyed him apprehensively. “Why?”
“It’s that voice again?” Harry whispered.
Draco decided he wished he hadn’t given it to Harry the moment the other boy pulled it over his head. The feeling of warmth that spread in his chest when he saw Harry wearing his clothing was dangerous. It was too much. Too adorable. But it’s not like he could tell Harry to take it off, that’d raise too many questions that he didn’t feel like answering right now.
“Very much,” he reassured.
“I swear I didn’t mean to.” His eyes widened and his thick dark eyebrows rose. He had rather interesting features, Pansy thought. His brown hair was a rumpled wavy birds nest atop his head, nearly as bad as Harry’s. He had fine bone structure, a sharp jaw and a long, straight nose. His lips were full and plush and for a moment Pansy thought about kissing them. But that was silly.
Draco shook his head as he went to work, cutting up and shredding ingredients. "You don't. It makes you stop hiccuping you idiot."
“With a girl.”
“Not necessarily, follow me.” Harry led Ron down to the dungeons where the Slytherin dorms were. “Wait here,” Harry said, indicating a statue. “I’ll be back in a moment.” He raced to his room and was busy pulling out his invisibility cloak from the bottom of his trunk from under his bed when a voice startled him and he hit his head.
“I promise, Pansy.” Harry shares a look with Draco, this is about the third time they’re having this conversation.
"I know." Draco muttered.
“Clearly you don’t! You can’t clear the pile after matching your five with the five I just played! Four players need to play all four of the same card before the pile is cleared!”
Draco led Griffin up the stairs to the library. His heart pounded in his chest and his palms felt sweaty.
“I just- I guess I thought since we’ve been, you know, well I guess I just thought I meant more to you. Even though we hadn’t talked about it yet, what we were, I assumed we were something,” Harry said, grounding out emphasis on the last word.
Harry smiled humbly. “It’s a pleasure to meet you as well.”
"Do I have to do a test?"
“Fine.”
“Tell him, Harry.”
"Well, I'm going to bed." Draco started to pack up.
“A snake,” Theo answered, reaching for a piece of toast with his other hand.
“Shhh,” Pansy hushed him. “It’s alright. Maybe you’re bi?”
Begrudgingly he stormed off in the direction of the infirmary.
Harry bit his lower lip and leaned forward, planting a kiss on Draco’s unsuspecting lips. He kissed him once more, harder. “You look very handsome.”
"Nice one!" Flint hollered, his voice was raspy in his throat. "Throw it back." Harry did, because as it turned out he didn't mind this sort of catch that resulted in adrenaline pumping through his veins. What with the wind in his hair, tears streaming out of the corners of his eyes he went so fast, his heart hammering in his chest and making him feel more alive than ever before.
He turned his face to the side, breaking the connection. “Nothing. I’m fine.”
Second Year
A million emotions had overwhelmed him all at once. His shock quickly turning to guilt and frustration when Draco had tried to confront him about why he’d had been avoiding him the last two months. He’d tried to leave the change room but Draco had grabbed his wrist so he couldn’t walk away. The warmth of his skin sent shivers down Harry’s spine. Harry turned to pull his hand back and was forced to face him. Draco’s face was paler than usual, dark bags beneath his eyes, rain slicked hood pulled up over his head, he looked awful. Harry couldn’t look away. Seeing Draco this miserable made him feel as if there were shards of glass being torn through his gut.
“Dunno,” he chuckled nervously.
"It's going to read my mind?!" Harry demanded with wide eyes, he ran a hand through his messy black hair. Draco wondered if it was as soft as it looked.
“Keep it.”
“You can talk to me about it anytime. Wake me up in the middle of the night if you want.”
“Good luck, mate. It was stellar watching you play last year.”
“Here, take these,” Draco said, tossing an unwrapped box at Harry. He looked down and saw that it was a set of very expensive looking quills.
“We will be looking into that. Of course.”
“There are clips, Theodore,” said Pansy, unimpressed, going back to giving Harry wings. “It isn’t that hard.”
"Whatever Potter." But the sullenness from earlier was gone and Harry wondered if he was imagining the affection in Draco's tone.
Draco snorted and shoved his head away. “Mmmm I d’know. They weren’t surprised. Mother laughed and Father told me we weren’t very subtle.”
“A bit?”
But Harry started back down the way they’d come. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and huffed a sigh before chasing after his apparently mad best friend. They retraced their steps the way they came until Harry made a turn down a corridor on the second floor. The corridor was full of water, from an unused girls bathroom, Draco realised. Not looking where he was going, Draco walked into Harry. He was about to give Harry an earful for stopping so suddenly when he looked up and saw why. On the wall in a dripping red substance that looked an awful lot like blood, a message was written : "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. '' But what was even more terrifying was Mrs Norris, who looked like she was dead, was hanging by her tail from a torch bracket.
“Sure you will.” Harry grinned in response. It was good to have his best friend back.
"Thanks again mate."
“Why?”
“Thanks,” Draco snorted. “It’s just a bunch of plants but-”
“Huh?”
When he was gone he turned to face Draco again. "Draco, why don't we talk to him and the other boys?" Draco finally looked up from his work.
She glanced up at him. “Yeah?”
“I mean, I think you’ll like it-”
Her smile slipped. “No.”
Draco knew the library at the manor was impressive. It was three floors full of row upon row of floor to ceiling bookshelves full of books.
“What are you getting at, Granger?” Pansy asked, impatiently.
Harry sighed. "But I'm meant to be your partner."
If you’re disappointed I suppose I understand. Not about my homosexuality but because your son is not the person you thought he was. The last fifteen years you’ve raised someone who isn’t exactly who you thought him to be.
“I’ve got something to bring so let’s stop by the bedrooms first,” Theo said, a glint in his eyes.
Draco wasn’t sure how to reply. “We’ll get through it. You will. I’m here for you, I’m always here for you.”
She shook her head.
“Cool.”
“Truth,” Harry heard Draco muttered.
“What do you care?” He shot back.
Draco huffed. He’d had too much to drink to filter anything he said right now. He should just go to sleep. “You look handsome, happy?”
“The key to our success over the last few years of pranks,” George told him.
“Harry Potter?” If it was possible, Dobby’s eyes seemed to widen even further. “How long I have wanted to make your acquaintance.”
The stands thundered as the audience roared. Draco wondered at his peers ability to be so lively as rain poured down on them all. A small smile curved his lips as he watched the rest of the slytherin quidditch team tackle Harry the moment his feet touched the ground. The Gryffindors looked miserable. The game had been so close, Draco couldn’t blame them. It had been a tie all the way up until Harry had pulled some impressive moves to catch the snitch.
“There’s no reason for you to sleep on a sofa, it’s big enough for both of us,” he said, stopping in front of the bed. “We’re best friends and as long as you don’t kick or talk in your sleep I don’t mind sharing.”
Harry fell into Draco’s arms and clung to him desperately. They fell asleep curled into each other, the knowledge that something they couldn’t stop, something dark, was coming.
Draco blanked. “My... boyfriend?”
Harry looked down at his paper, then at Draco, then back to his paper and put down his quill. “Cool cool cool. That’s cool. Cool for you.”
Draco chuckled warmly. "Only you, Potter."
“Thanks man, this stuff looks really expensive.”
Draco’s heart fluttered. Harry knew something very few did, what he looked like first thing in the morning. Even the other Slytherin boys didn’t know that. Draco always had a few short moments to compose himself behind the curtains of his four poster bed before facing them and starting his day. However, with him and Harry sharing a bed there was no hiding. He composed himself and was proud of how evenly his voice sounded when he spoke. “Unfortunately enough for you my parents and our guests do not appreciate my bed head.”
Disbelief crashed over him as his heart fell to his feet and time stopped. All the giddy happiness he’d felt earlier was gone, replaced by something much darker.
“Yes.” Harry leaned away and Draco berated himself for wishing he’d stayed there.
“Oh- well- go ahead.” Draco slipped around him. Harry sucked in a lungful of air as he passed and hurried into the bathroom.
Her face shifted from surprised to sympathetic. “Oh, Harry.”
Draco wouldn’t let Harry be taken out of his eyesight even once he was settled in a bed and Madam Pomfrey reassured him Harry would be fine. He was reminded of the end of First Year when Harry had been brought in after defeating the Dark Lord and Draco had spent hours sitting with him until he’d woken up. Now they were back in the infirmary and Harry was unconscious again, Draco in a chair at his bedside. That’s where he fell asleep.
Merlin, he was lucky. Harry wandered back to his side. “Pansy’s turn now isn’t it?”
“Because you like me?” Harry smiled softly.
“Harry,” Pansy cut him off. “Just accept and say thank you, darling”
You’re father and I have news that may not come as a shock to you. We’ve been having problems that we just can’t work out despite our best efforts. As you may have noticed the two of us no longer live together. The last year we’ve taken some time apart and we both agree that it is better that way. Because of all this we feel that it is time that we divorced. We both still love you very much. Your father and I want you to know this is in no way your fault. Please write me back with any questions or concerns.
Draco grimaced and bit his lower lip. “They weren’t the best. He used to be scared of us I think. He’s a lot happier now though. Most house elves enjoy helping their masters, it gives them purpose I think. What I wonder about is if they would still feel that way if it wasn’t what they were born and raised for.”
Draco lay back down. “Imagine all the things we can do now that we have that, until the spell wears off, of course.”
Harry rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands. "Snape started talking about something useless in a monotone voice and I found it an effort to keep my eyes open much less pay attention."
“Really? You don’t think it’s dumb?”
Blake raised an eyebrow. “Is that so? I’m a chaser on the Ravenclaw quidditch team. We almost won against you last year. You must remember me at least a bit from that.”
“Oh, alright,” Hermione sighed. “But we have to do something soon, before there’s another attack.” They all agreed, nodding glumly.
Harry took a sip of water from the cup on his bedside table, ice cold water slid down his throat. When he turned back around Draco was slipping on his eye mask.
“At least we’re doing it in a safe environment with friends,” Draco mused. “Besides, we’re only tipsy, it’s not like we’re drunk.”
“I’m glad to know that’s how you feel about my class, Mister Nott,” McGonagall said from behind Theo, passing off a screech owl to Draco who took the creature and placed it on Harry and Pansy’s desk, in the middle of them all.
“-and because according to Ron you seem like a pretty solid bloke-”
“Yeah, ‘oh yeah.’”
“No,” Draco said miserably. “Harry’s too good a person. He wouldn’t treat me any differently. But it’s so much easier now, when I’m still able to pretend that I have a chance.”
“I only got one fuck for that necklace I bought you! You’re the bore,” Aldrich snapped. And so did Harry, he surged forward but Blaise yanked him back by the collar of his shirt.
Just then the other Slytherin boys burst through the door. “Are you the Heir of Slytherin, Harry?” Theo asked.
“Pans…” She was a mess, dark black hair in her face, nose all pink and runny. Harry squished into the armchair beside her and pulled her into a bone crushing hug.
That made something in him snap. Harry couldn’t hold it in anymore. “Maybe that’s because everytime I see you all I see is Clemonte pressing you up against a bookshelf and sticking his tongue down your throat!”
He showed both to Draco and Pansy. From there, his mood was greatly improved.
It felt like Harry was speaking in riddles. “I don’t understand.”
“Yes.” Draco waited for something to explode or for the world to end. Neither of those things or anything of that scale occurred.
“I did not eavesdrop…” Except he totally had. “ I waited for you and overheard your loud blathering.”
“A hot tub?” Theo asked, chiming in.
“So how does this work?” He asked nervously. Pansy riffled around and took out what she’d need.
Harry stared at the thin, rectangular, wiry frames Draco wore. “When’d you get reading glasses?”
“Breakfast.”
Harry blinked and watched Draco continue to try to cover up the pimple. A few minutes later, tilting his head this way and that in the lighting, he seemed satisfied and started to put away the powder.
Pansy shrugged, nonchalant. “Doesn’t seem weird to me. It’ll give us a chance to get to know each other.”
But he started to squirm in his seat when after some time they still hadn't returned. Unable to listen to Mrs Clemonte any longer he excused himself, saying he felt light headed and wanted to lay down. With that he bid his friends goodnight and ascended the stairs, in the direction of the library instead of his room. He had to check on Draco. There was a part of him that had to know if the other boy was alright.
“You’re both my favourite people,” Harry laughed.
Pansy cut Dumbledore off, speaking over him. “Did you know they bested a giant chess set, Harry flew a broom to catch a flying key, Draco knew which potions not to drink oh! Harry also defeated the Dark Lord! He passed out though. Draco and I had to go back before that though because there wasn’t enough potion for all of us and now Harry is in the hospital wing-”
Then he imagined himself in Clemontes place and his world turned upside down. Oh. Oh no.
“Last year, you promised you weren’t going anywhere.”
Of course actions spoke louder than words so while the letters were a good start Harry was really waiting to see if Draco’s behavior would change. Harry hoped it would. He didn’t want to be angry with his best friend anymore.
Harry’s face twisted in confusion. “Why would someone do that?”
Draco looked at him like he’d grown a second head. “No? Why would that be acceptable?”
“I am not! I’m just excited to have that bad bitch vibe you have!”
“I could have been.” Draco fumed. “Why are you even here?”
Great so now we're playing fetch. Harry internally signed but didn't have much time to think because Marcus had pitched the apple and it was descending quickly. Harry raced after it, but the apple was dropping too fast. Acting before he thought about whether or not what he was doing was a good idea Harry pushed his broom into a dive, steep enough to snatch the apple before it hit the ground. He just managed to pull the broom back up before face planting into the dirt.
Pansy tapped his leg with her foot and he jumped. "Helloooo! Harryyy! Stop staring."
Draco gave him a tired smile. Tired in a sad kind of way. He had looked that way the whole night. Harry hadn’t wanted to say anything before he was sure, however, now he was certain something was wrong.
“Then when?” Draco demanded.
Black laughed and Harry stared. The Daily Prophet was right, he’d gone mad in Azkaban. He looked absolutely unhinged. Lupin was watching Black, not with disgust or fear, but the way Harry knew he looked at Draco or vice versa because of photos. Like the closest of friends.
“Oh I can’t do this anymore-”
“It’s a frightening concept,” Pansy agreed. Harry didn’t miss the look she shared with Draco. What was that about?
She winced but tried to hide it, looking down as she straightened her skirt. “Could you just trust me about this.”
He chuckled. "That's all your asking for?"
One night things were getting more heated than usual. Pansy had helped Harry out of his shirt and her own blouse was unbuttoned and slipping off her shoulder. She sat in his lap, cupping his face with her small delicate hands. Her cheeks were flushed a dark pink and his chest lifted and fell rapidly. But when he felt Pansy’s hands move to unbutton his pants panic like he’d never felt before surged through him.
“For what?”
“When did you figure it out?”
Harry stood alone in a crowd of unfamiliar faces at the train station.
Pansy rolled her eyes but there was a smirk on her lips that told Harry she wasn’t disappointed with the attention.
He sighed. Okay, this was the less chill part he’d been expecting. Harry was still sitting here though instead of storming away and he hadn’t thrown anything or yelled yet so this situation was already better than three fourths of the scenarios he’d imagined would take place. “Why are you being weird, Potter?”
Draco wasn't sure what there was to be confused about. "Well, yeah, at Hogwarts."
“It makes so much sense,” Draco leaned back, annoyed that he hadn’t thought of it before.
“Of course-”
He frowned and tilted his head. "What?"
“No,” said Harry at the exact same time that Draco said yes.
“Suppose he’s our next Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor?” pondered Theo.
The first portion of the train ride the group discussed going to Hogsmeade since they were allowed to go now on designated days since they were in their third year at Hogwarts this year. When Harry revealed that he hadn’t been able to get his Aunt or Uncles signatures, hence he wouldn’t be able to go, they started discussing ways to sneak Harry in. It was around then that a rain started up, thick and fast. Bullets of rain fell in rapid succession against the compartment window. Professor Lupin still hadn’t woken up.
“You think you could?”
“Enough,” grunted Harry. “Stop being such a mother hen.”
“It’s rude to eavesdrop, Potter.”
Dear mother and father,
They all ended up gathered in the same sitting room as the night before. All of them were still in their pyjamas even though it was mid afternoon. Pansy had a blanket wrapped around her shoulders to stay warm and Theo had a duvet pulled over his head.
“Not everything.”
“You can’t buy me you nasty mother fucker! You don’t buy a girl some jewellery, or anything for that matter, and then expect her to kiss your ass.”
“Anytime,” Harry said as they jokingly shook hands. “I’ll stay with Draco here. He’ll make sure I actually write my essay instead of procrastinating.”
Draco sunk further into the pillows he had propped up behind him to support his back while he’d been reading. “I’m not sure,” he confessed, voice barely above a whisper.
“What else can we do, Albus?”
“Because your classes are on opposite ends of Hogwarts.”
Harry crossed his arms across his chest protectively, feeling vulnerable. “It’s ridiculous. I have to get over him.”
“How far have you gone?”
“Late night?” A voice drawled. Whirling around he saw Draco who was sitting up in bed, arms stretched out. A pop came when the boy cracked his back. Harry winced at the sound. Draco’s usually carefully coiffed hair was all over the place and he had the urge to smooth it back.
Draco’s cheeks were flushed pink but Harry figured it was from the alcohol. “Mother would probably be so upset if she knew I took her fancy expensive liquor,” Draco hummed, stroking Harry’s hair back from his forehead. Harry closed his eyes again and sunk further into the mattress. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so relaxed.
“You boys are making such a mess,” his mother shook her head, taking out her wand, she vanished the snow before it melted and ruined the hardware floors.
Pansy stared at him. "You really have no idea?"
“This is actually really cool, Draco,” Harry said so only the other boy could hear.
Harry shoved Theo’s voice out of his head and tried to imagine a naked girl. He’d seen a few busty women in Blaise’s magazines he thought he’d hidden well and tried to imagine them in numerous scenarios but found they did very little. Harry tried a few girls he knew, hoping maybe that would do more but Megan Jones on her knees, Hannah Abbott riding him and Lavender Brown under him did nothing for him. Then it came to him. Pansy. Of course. Why hadn’t he thought of his girlfriend before? He squeezed his eyes tight and tried to imagine her hand jerking him off instead of his own. Imagined her tongue on him. Imagined himself in her. He sighed, frustrated, when that didn’t work either. Maybe masturbation just wasn’t his thing.
Harry buttoned up the shirt to the pair of silk green pyjamas Draco was lending him. “Christmas of course.”
“Who is he?” asked Theo, peering at the mans face. “I’ve never seen an adult on the train, save that dumpy cheerful lady with the sweets trolley.”
“Merlin, I really hated that class.”
Fifth Year
How are you guys doing? I hope you're all still staying connected to friends and family through facetime. I know it's really hard, it's weird not going to school and even weirder being cooped up inside with family for so long. We're all doing our best but it's okay if you're not your best most productive self every day<3
“My cousin gave him to me this summer, only I couldn’t tell my dad. He’d be so angry if he knew. So I had to take him to Hogwarts with me.”
“That’s not his choice,” Harry balks. Draco watches Harry’s features go from upset to happy in a matter of seconds as he sees Blaise walking towards their group. Jealousy twisted in his gut when Blaise got the same hug he had.
Today was the day her little boy was going off to school. Narcissa told herself she would see him at Christmas and that the holiday break wasn't far off. Only four months, she'd only have to spend four months alone at the Manor. Of course there was Lucius, but Draco would be miles away, and it just wouldn't be the same.
Draco thought his tone sounded bitter. "Why do you say that like it's a bad thing?"
“And I did.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to stare in shock. “What?”
“Our feelings are rarely considerate of what is convenient for us.”
The Yule Ball was a splendid affair. Everything was of the theme of a shimmering magical snowfall in the Great Hall. Glittering white crystal icicles hung from the ceiling, sparkling white lights draped around columns, glowing orbs hung in mid air.
Blaise’s laugh was raspy in the morning. “Nah, nevermind, dumb question. None of you poofs were that lucky. I’d be surprised if any of you got further than a kiss.”
"I would."
“I just think Christmas would be nice with all of us.”
“Harry, it’s your turn,” Blaise told him.
"We're making a hiccoughing potion," Draco told him, running his finger down a list of ingredients in his textbook. Harry studied his face. Draco was bitting his lower pale pink lip in concentration. Before Harry could look away Draco glanced over at him with those steely grey eyes.
“I thought you knew that considering I’ve been snogging you at every opportunity possible,” Draco said, blushing.
To his horror when Hermione found out she went to McGonagall who demanded to have the broom stripped down. To Harry’s understanding Ron was already in a foul mood with Hermione since her new cat, Crookshanks, had according to Ron, had it out for Scabbers, his rat since she got him before the school year started. Now Ron was barely talking to her (“How could she go to McGonagall...does she understand… the Firebolt is only the best broom there is!...have it stripped…Is she mad?!)
“How did you know which ones I wanted? They’re for potions outside of class, they wouldn’t have been in the textbook.”
Once she'd closed the compartment door Draco looked over at Harry. "You shouldn't talk to wizards and witches like her." Draco muttered, a sour look twisting his features.
“I got it for Christmas last year,” Harry started to explain as they half sprinted up to the second floor. “At first I had no idea who sent it to me. There was no sender's name attached. But then I found out at the end of last year that it was from Dumbledore-”
“Who would you do?” Harry suggested.
“Tell me about it.” Harry spotted Draco over Pansy’s shoulder and a smile broke out across his face. Draco smirked back but wasn’t prepared for the tight hug Harry gave him. He flushed but hugged Harry in return.
Harry scoffed and turned his face back to the crackling fire, watching the flames dance .
“So you’ve been awfully quiet in there all night,” Griffin commented.
Harry’s brow creased as he rubbed the back of his neck and winced. “Because I’m not pureblood? Because I’m not top of the class like you? I don’t know there are so many reasons.”
“We have no facts yet. Only writing on a wall and a petrified cat.”
Blaise considered then grunted his approval and slid out of bed. “Anyone score last night?”
“Should be fine.”
Draco wanted to argue that it was actually because it was the colour of Harry’s eyes but kept his mouth shut. He didn’t need to go exposing himself like that, even if imagining the looks on his friends faces made him think maybe it would be worth it. “Truth or dare, Zabini?”
Harry chuckled. “Good to see you too, Zabini.”
As they continued their walk to the Slytherin dorms Harry and Draco fell behind the other three. Harry was smirking and running a hand through his hair when he tensed up all of a sudden and froze in his tracks. Draco stopped with him.
“So the most likely scenario is someone, once again, wants to see you dead and is trying to kill you,” she explained.
“This summer is the Quidditch World Cup. I’ll write to you about pick up sooner to the day of, Harry,” Draco told him.
Harry turned to face his best mate. “You don’t even know how good you have it, do you?”
“Of course we did. You don’t think we’d just have you unwrap all your gifts in front of him?”
“You don’t look so bad yourself.”
“Nuh uh. It’s Draco’s turn.”
“Before all the decent ones are gone.” His skin felt uncomfortable, tingly. Why did his skin feel tingly? That wasn’t a normal skin feeling. He reached up and adjusted his tie. Desperate to pertain some image of normalcy he asked, “So, who’d you ask Theo?”
“What, why?” Harry ran a hand through his ever messy hair and Draco promptly tore his eyes away. He hated how whenever Harry ran his hands through his hair it made it look like he’d just had a rough shag.
Harry snorted. “Pansy how much did you have?”
“Pettigrew escaped.”
Harry finished up his letter to his godfather and Remus before dashing down the hallway after Draco to tag along to his room, which was only a few halls from the guest room Harry’s things were in. Even though they’d been sharing a room for most of the Winter Break most of Harry’s clothes were still in a guest room so none of their friends got suspicious.
The second semester of the school year was even crazier than the first. Harry was busy with Dumbledore’s Army, a group of students who actually wanted to learn how to defend themselves against the slowly but surely spreading darkness that was growing in the wizarding world, and trying to avoid all his friends who tended to nag him about studying for his OWLs. His main priority though was avoiding Draco. It filled him with guilt but seeing the other boy just made him feel even worse.
As the Quidditch match got closer and closer Harry knew he should buy a new broom, as it was likely he wouldn’t get his Firebolt back before the match even with Marcus Flint nagging Professor McGonagall. He and Ron would go to her after every Transfiguration class but she still wouldn’t let him have it back, each time saying there was this or that hex or curse that Professor Flitwick suspected.
