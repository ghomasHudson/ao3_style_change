"Good. You know, I'm still not sure how it's all gonna go over or what everyone is going to believe but at least I've said the truth. As much as I didn't want some of that to get out..." Draco could tell by the way Harry said it he was talking about the mental health issues, not their relationship, "at least I don't have to worry about it coming out anymore. It's out there now and there was nothing I could do about that."
Molly replied, "They all have been working so hard I thought it would be nice to have the whole family together again." There was a moment of silence remembering that the whole family wouldn't be there, the whole family would never be there again. Fred.
"Ya."
Al looked up at Harry, they had gotten so close since the time-turner incident. Al was thinking about how he had just gotten through to his father and now they were going to be separated. He decided in that moment if his parents were going to be separated, he wanted to live with his dad in the summer. He would miss Lily, but he would get a break from James.
"DINNER!" Molly yelled from the kitchen. So before anymore could be said on the subject, the six men got up and helped Mrs. Wealsey bring food from the kitchen to the big table set up outside, and they all sat down to eat the feast Mrs. Wealsey had prepared.
After a while, Harry checked his watch and realize he had to head up to the castle. He hugged Hagrid before leaving. He headed to the headmaster's office and found Minerva inside already waiting with his two children.
"What?" Harry says in complete surprise. "I didn't know you were out!"
"Well so can I, Potter, because I don't have to work!" Draco says, reverting back to that entitled voice Harry was more familiar with as they walk out of the office.
Their father said, "Your mother and I need to talk to you in person, and we didn't want to wait until Christmas." The kids all had their suspicions confirmed now that it must be something bad.
When Draco popped out in the Ministry, there was a wall of people between him and Harry who he could see on a platform near the fountain. He could hear reporters yelling out questions, it seemed like Harry was done saying his piece and now he was going to take questions. Draco pushed through the crowd yelling, "Move, scum!"
Then he felt two arms wrap around him and heard Molly's voice, "Shh... its ok dearie. It's alright." Molly held him tight and rocked him a bit, "We understand and we are fine with you being gay. Just a bit of a shock that's all." Harry looked up to see Arthur nodding to him in agreement with Molly's words.
Harry heard Draco say, "Who would have thought," non-chalantly. But Draco was thinking about Dumbledore. Every time he came up, he felt an overwhelming guilt for what he almost did. He still blamed himself for Dumbledore's death, but he never talked to Harry about it. Little did Draco know that Harry knew what happened in the astronomy tower that night, and didn't blame Draco at all.
"He told me at the beginning of the school year, we waited a few weeks before telling you guys we were getting divorced." Ginny said, determined to have everything out in the open.
"As for having once attempted to take my life, I won't deny it. A lot happened that night when he summoned me to the forest that I have never spoken about and will not be speaking about today. I'll just say that I should have died that day. It was by some miracle that I did not."
Harry Potter." he said in a tone mocking how people have referred to him his whole life.
"I know. Neville told me. I'm so happy for you both." Harry smiled at her.
"I can see how you would think it was me. I'm the only person besides your little friends who knew right?" It was more of a rhetorical question. Draco had already figured this is why Harry blamed him. Draco continued on, "I want you to trust me... Harry." Despite the conversation they just had, it was really odd for Harry to hear Draco say his first name to him.
He wasn't sure why he told Draco anyways, "When I was pretending to act dead, your mother was the one Voldemort sent to check if I was still alive. She knew I was alive, but she told Voldemort I wasn't."
"I should go, but thank you again and good luck with everything. I promise I won't tell anyone, at least until it's in 'The Prophet!" Dean and Harry both gave a little chuckle.
Hermione looked taken a back, "What do you mean, Harry? How could it be Draco's fault?
Harry finally lifted his head to look at his children, "You guys don't really see it, but it puts a lot of strain on our relationship." which was true. Harry and Ginny had struggled for years with Harry waking up most nights with nightmares, Harry having days when he could barley get himself out of bed, and occasionally having flashbacks triggered or thinking he saw Voldemort on a corner or down an alley.
Harry was very anxious to see Albus, as he still seemed to be angry with Harry. Albus hadn't spoken to him since he and Ginny went to Hogwarts and Albus screamed at him that everything was Harry's fault. But as Albus's face came into clear view, it didn't seem to be one of anger, actually when he saw his father, Albus started to jog, then sprit towards him.
"Is it true you are dating Draco Malfoy?" one reporter yells over all the rest. Harry had yet avoided bringing up Malfoy; he didn't think it was his place to confirm that Draco was gay. "Uh..." Harry just said and then in the crowd he saw people moving and shoving around. Right in the middle of that, coming towards the stage, he sees Draco. Harry just stares, watching his love coming towards him.
Draco hadn't really spoken to Harry since that day in Hogsmeade. He had the feeling Harry was ignoring him, and he knew it had to be about the kids. Harry had just confessed his love for Draco; there was no other explanation why he would suddenly stop talking to him. Draco loved Harry back, he understood what Harry must be going through, but he couldn't bare to lose him.   Other than his son, Harry was the best thing in Draco's life, but he was worried if he pushed, it would only push Harry away, so he had only written to Harry once and didn't argue when he said he was busy.
But now they were enemies once more.
"So you finally figured it out huh?" Charlie said to Harry nodding his head towards Draco, then he said quieter so the people in the kitchen wouldn't hear, "Mum keeps wanting me to get married but I'm still not sure how to explain to her I'm asexual."
"So Harry," Bill said turning to Harry, "Great job. I got mom's owl in time for us to listen to it on the radio." Then he turned to Draco. Draco got a bit nervous; he knew of, but had never met, this Weasley. But then Bill turned back to Harry before asking, "So how long have you guys been a thing?"
"Neither do I." Harry said, "We had a lot of good times, our three beautiful children. I just wish we could be one big, happy family. It's my fault we can't have that."
"He didn't take it too well did he?" Harry said. Draco didn't say anything. Harry continued, "I didn't want them to find out this way."
"Ya, right!" said Harry laughing along. "I just... wanted to be square. You saved me, I saved you."
Draco's heart did a somersault when he heard this. He had realized he had a thing for Harry Potter a long time ago, but he had also accepted that it was never happening. When he heard of Harry's divorce he had the tightest bit of hope, but still logically he thought, never, ever, would Harry Potter be into him or any man.
A few days later Rita Seeker announced her "retirement" from her job at the Daily Prophet, but Harry heard through Hermione that she was forced into retirement after the Ministry became aware of her animagus status. However, the Ministry didn't want thousands of lawsuits that were to surely come if it got out that she was an unregistered animus and that was how she was getting her stories on people. So it was kept under the radar; she was fined and forced to register as an animagus, but didn't have to do any time in Azkaban.
Lily looked at her father's shocked expression and watched him slow turn to look at Albus, then sigh.
"Oh, Harry." Ginny was a bit annoyed that Harry could be as stupid as to go to Hogsmeade on a Hogwarts weekend, but she also felt bad. She knew Harry wasn't really ready to explain to the kids and when he did, he wanted to do it on his own terms. He'd lost that now; she knew they would have to tell James and Lily now.
money around?" Draco looked appalled. Harry didn't bother to answer.
"They hate me!" Harry cries out, "The kids hate me." he continued to sob.
Harry gave Ginny a look, asking her silently if she wanted to tell the kids or have him tell them. But she took a big breath and said, "Your father and I are getting divorced."
"Are you sure you don't want me up there with you?" Ginny asked.
He couldn't do it, he just couldn't. His eyes now turned to the ground. Telling them their father is gay was going to shatter they're world even more and the divorce was still so fresh. So before he really though it trough, he finished, "...  I have some problems." He looked to Ginny; Ginny looked a bit surprised. She hadn't thought he would bring up this.
"Rock cake?"
"Hmph!" Albus couldn't believe his own best friend wasn't on his side. He stormed away from him and back towards the castle.
"Oh! That." Draco looked bit nervous, "It was nothing, just uh.... dropping something off something for a friend."
"It's alright, don't worry about it." Scorpius smiled at him. Albus smiled back, and just like that he had his best friend back. He needed him right now. As much as he felt closer to his siblings after last night, they were in still in Gryffindor, and Albus felt alone in Slytherin, so he was happy to have his friend to talk to again.
Meanwhile, Draco easily forgave Harry. He was far too happy about the fact that Harry felt the same way for him to hold a grudge. The two men started secretly seeing each other. Neither of them really wanted it all over the news, since the relationship was so new. Not to mention that they didn't want their kids finding out yet.
"Potter!" Draco for a second thought he should blame Harry for this, but there was no point, "I... have to go!"
Harry chuckled a bit, paused and then said, "Did you know... that Dumbledore too was..." for some reason he wasn't quite sure, Harry was having a hard time saying it a loud.
In the long silence, Aberforth had walked away, back to whatever he was doing under the bar. "Draco," Harry started, Draco broke his trance and looked up at Harry. "I love you."
Harry wasn't too surprised. He had never thought of this, but he remembered how unhinged Draco seemed back in 6th year. Him wanting to take his own life wasn't a far stretch since Voldemort would have killed him if he failed anyway.
While the kids were still processing, everyone did all manage to have a good holiday. Christmas morning was full of presents and smiles as always, and for a bit everything felt normal.
"Oh Harry! We wanted to peak in on you before but we couldn't even get through!" Molly rushed over fussing, "But I knew you had Ron and Hermione and Ginny there. You did so well dear, spoke very clearly, told your truth." She looks from Harry to Draco standing behind him, "Come here, you too dear." Draco comes forward, Molly Weasley had almost never spoken to him. "I was a bit worried about this when I first heard," Molly glanced between Harry and Draco. Ginny told her parents prior to the press conference, with Harry's permission, that it was true he was dating Draco, but Harry hadn't spoken to them himself and he didn't know how Mrs. or Mr. Weasley felt about it. "But I can see you two have something special here." Molly smiled at Harry and Draco. Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
"Ya, I will stop by sometime."
Lily just wanted to know why. What was so wrong with her parents that they didn't love each other anymore, but she couldn't bring herself to ask.
"And don't you forget it, Potter!" Draco said jokingly and both men laughed.
That evening, as Harry looked up at the gates at the winged bores, he felt so much like this place was his home again. For so many years, it was hard to visit because of all the bloodshed, but now he was reminded of the good years as he smelled the early summer air and looked over the green grounds.
"I don't know what to do, Ginny." Harry said to his ex-wife one night. He had come over to her house to talk, "They might fire me! Everyone seems to think it's a possibility. What about the kids!?"
"Well you did die before you turned 18." Draco said with a giggle, lightening the mood.
(TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE ATTEMPT - skip down to the next *** if you don't want to read it)
"How do you know?" James asked.
"Yes?" Harry replied more as a statement than a question. He knew they needed to talk, and he had a good idea of what was coming, but he hadn't prepared to have this conversation tonight. He feels like he should be dreading it, but he's not.
Harry rolled his eyes to Draco, seeming jokingly annoyed and not at all surprised by Molly's surprise family invites. Draco on the other hand was starting to sweat. He wasn't prepared to meet everyone tonight. He couldn't believe himself,
Now Harry was surprised. He wanted that to be true, but then again he didn't. Earlier today he had just yelled at and accused Draco.
"Prefect, I have an idea." Harry said grabbing Draco's hand, and together they disaparated.
"I never thought I would get to this point in my life." Draco said seriously.
Ron then had a thought pop into his head. He knew he shouldn't have to ask, but he felt like he just needed to make sure, "Harry... You don't fancy me right?"
"Alright." Harry said thinking about Draco and how happy he made him, and now him gone.
Harry was left standing alone in the hallway again. He wasn't sure what to do with himself. At first he instinctually thought of heading to the Gryffindor common room, but then he realized that even if he knew the password he probably wasn't supposed to be in there. He decided to head to the Headmistress's Office instead, figuring he should pay Professor McGonagall a visit while he was here.
"Dumbledore?!" Draco said looking from Aberforth to Harry for an explanation.
Draco looked into his eyes for a second before replying, "I love you too, Harry."
"Of course I have friends, Potter!" said Draco defensively. "I still speak with Goyle and Blaise." By the way he said that Harry thought it was unlikely they spoke much anymore.
"Yes, thank you."
Albus and Scorpius always liked doing their own thing in Hogsmeade. After the first few trips, they got tried of the busy Honeydukes, Zonkos, and Three Broomsticks. They had gone to the Hogs Head once before and liked how quiet it was. The last person Albus had expected to see there was his father. What was he even doing in Hogsmeade?! And on a Hogwarts weekend?
"Can I say something or are you going to punch me in the arm again, honey?" Ron asked Hermione. Hermione just rolled her eyes; Ron turned to Harry, "I don't understand it, Harry. He was always kind of mean to us at Hogwarts..."
"Alright, I think. She seems to be taking dad being in Azkaban pretty well actually. Like she's finally free of him. We both are, in a way, but I still don't wish he was there."
He was walking through the forbidden forest at night with his wand tip lit. The same path he had taken a year ago, but this time he seemed to reach the clearing must faster. In his pocket, just a small vial of poison.
"So why don't you tell me what happened... um?"
Harry has said 'I love you' to Ginny a million times and he always meant it. He knows the answer should be 'yes, of course' but he also knows what she means; they were never talking about the same type of love. Harry knows whats she's really asking, and can't bring himself to lie to her. He can't bring himself to say anything actually, so he sits there in silence and they both know the answer is no.
"I thought I always loved Ginny–" Harry tried to begin.
"Sometimes I wish I could. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed some of the glory. But at this point in my life, I just want to live. I can't stand the reporters trying to find out things about me and the people wanting to know every detail of my life. I just want to be happy... And you make me really happy, Draco."
Harry looked to Draco next to him to try to see what they should do, but Draco was looking back at his own son. Harry didn't know what to say, but he said "Albus, let me explain." even though he had no idea how he would.
"Harry, I'm so sorry. I still feel like this is my fault. If you didn't have that conversation, you would still be together."
"My own son..." Harry said between sobs, "called me a coward.... and he's right." Harry couldn't stop thinking about what James has said. He was a coward for living a lie all these years. Lily was right that he hid it from himself and Ginny when deep down he always knew. Albus was right that he chose to date Draco, something he predicted Albus wasn't going to be happy about. Harry kept it from him, from all of them, which he always knew was just going to make it worse. But he was too much of a coward to face them. His son was right.
After a long moment of silence to let that sink in, Harry said to his kids, "This is not your fault at all, I really hope none of you think that. And me and your mom don't hate each other, we just don't... feel the same way we used to." Harry was not ready to come out to his kids, and Ginny agreed it was best not to put too much on them at once.
am here on school board business." This wasn't really true. Draco knew Harry was going to be here today because Scorpius had mentioned in a letter home that Albus had gotten a letter that said Harry was coming to Hogwarts today. Draco wanted to see Harry again, but he had wanted it to look like an accident. He couldn't go to Harry, what if Harry just rejected him? Told him there was too much bad history, he could be friends, but never lovers. After all this time, that would be Draco's worst nightmare.
Ron had come back from the kitchen with a fresh tea cup which he placed in front of Harry on the coffee table, and sat himself down in the chair next to the coach. "Why the bloody hell would you tell Draco Malfoy
"Uh..."
"Oh... oh!" Ron said as he realized what that meant. "Really, mate? Draco Malfoy? How long that been a thing?" Hermione gave him a stern look. Hermione was quite surprised and didn't think it was the best idea either, but she thought Harry had been through too much today to also have his two best friends showing their disapproval over who he liked.
"What do ya mea- OW!" said Ron. Harry looked up to see Ron rubbing his shoulder, presumably where Hermione had just jabbed him.
, and started yelling, "MALFOY! MALFOY GET OUT HERE NOW!"
Albus was pissed, he thought his father was actually going to give some explanation when he told him to wait, but no, just "don't tell James and Lily." Albus snorted. His father was just protecting his own ass; never caring about him, the family, his mother. His father was selfish. Albus hated Harry: hated him for being gay, for breaking up their family, for dating his best friend's dad.
"So that's how you did it!? I didn't realize you had it all the way back in third year, Potter."
As Harry led the way to the Hogs Head, Draco said, "Wish we had your invisibility cloak now, Potter."
"Keep your voice down, Malfoy. Muggles aren't used to hearing the word "muggle" yelled in the streets; its bad enough you're in robes." Harry sighed, "We're here becuase I know a great place up this way."
"Good luck, mate." Ron said and then Hermione threw her arms around Harry.
"Can't believe you didn't tell me you were dating Malfoy, Harry!" George said putting his arm around Draco's shoulders.
James interjected, "What? Why? Why can't he stay in my room! It's bigger!"
Dean looked sadden by this, "Harry, I never meant to mess everything up with you guys. Don't leave her over one drunk night flirting with a stupid ex."
Draco opened the door with a surprised look, "What are you doing here?" he didn't sound angry, honestly he sounded a bit sad.
Harry then looks to Draco and Draco looks at him. Harry has a strong urge to kiss him, but he doesn't want to do that right in the middle of his press conference. He settles for grabbing Draco's hand and interlocking their fingers.
Draco looked around again, now everyone was smiling at him, except Granger. She just wore a blank expression. Then, "I'm glad to two nit-wits found each other!" George shouted over the table. "To Harry and Draco!" he said raising a glass.
"Always thought you might be gay." He heard George say with a snort from behind Molly.
Hermione was the first to speak, "How did this come about? You just learned this? Are you sure?" she asked in rapid succession.
"It's alright Dean, I know what happened. I'm not upset with you, but I wanted you to know that Ginny and I are getting divorced."
It wasn't a question, Harry was sleeping here tonight. He followed suit and striped and put on the shirt Draco had given him. When his head popped out of the neck hole, he saw Draco was already getting into the bed.
By the next morning, Albus still hadn't spoken to Scorpius. Scorpius tried to talk to him when he came into the dormitory the prior evening, but Albus pretended to be asleep. Albus got up early and went to breakfast. He was nearly finished eating when he saw his Gryffindor brother and sister come into the hall. An owl swooped down and dropped them a letter. He saw them reading it from across the hall and then they both started coming his way.
"Thanks Ron, but I'm sure." Harry saw Ron smile supportively but nervously at him.
"There's something you should probably see..." Ron said nervously, "It's not good." He handed Harry the morning's Daily Prophet.
"Yes, I took my father's spot when he went to Azkaban." This was true.
"Hermione said she knows Morgan Burke," Ron told Harry after he looked up from the paper, "She's kind of taken up Rita's work, writing about crazy rumors and uncovering secrets. She has a son at Hogwarts, that must have been how she found out." Ron shook his head,  "Can't believe she'd use her own kid."
Ron shrugged, "They like to cook. I'm sure we'll have to do the cleaning." Ron said as Bill sat down next to him and chuckled.
"What are you doing here Albus?" Harry can't believe his son just walked in on him and Draco. Of course, of all the students at Hogwarts, his son would be the kind to hang out in the Hog's Head. Harry felt a bit stupid.
Harry looked around at the three surprised faces staring back at him. Ron was looking to see his family's reaction, and Hermione was just glazing downwards, as if she couldn't bare to look at how the Weasleys were going to take it.
But Harry cut him off, "Save it." He turned away from Draco, unable to look at his face, "Whatever this is, is over." and with that Harry disapparated back to the Ministry.
But the Weasleys seemed to accept even more than he could that he didn't want to split up his young family, since he told them he hadn't really figured it out until after James was born, and still didn't accept it for years after, which was true. Molly apparently had spoken to her older sons, as per Harry's request she didn't mention his sexuality, but she told them they ought to forgive him. Harry hadn't seen any of them since, but he did make his way down to Diagon Alley one day to see George and Ron at Weasley Wizarding Wheezes.
Harry and Draco had been dating on the down low for a few months. Hermione, Ron, and Professor Mcgonagall were still the only people who knew. Harry felt weird telling Ginny because he was the one who ruined their marriage and he wanted her to have someone new too before he told her he had found someone. Therefore, he couldn't tell any of the rest of Weasleys either.
"I told him." Harry said looking down at his feet. He couldn't stand to look at Hermione, what would she think about him trusting Draco?
Despite all of their history, in this moment, Harry felt like he could trust Draco. He definitely wasn't going to tell him everything, but he told him the truth. "I uh.... I didn't love her the way I should have. And after all these years that was really starting to take it's toll, on both of us. Ginny and I finally talked about it and we decided that we both deserved the chance to be truly happy. So we split and I moved out; we told the kids, and then signed the papers."
But he can't take any of it back now, "Al, I'm sorry. Please, lets talk." Harry pleaded with his son.
"I don't have those feelings for him anymore though, Harry. It was just..."
"No, honey, it wasn't like that. I didn't know. It took me a long time to figure it out." Harry said, but he was disappointed in himself.
"I bet it'll be shit." Malfoy said jokingly with a smile.
Harry couldn't bring himself to believe Ron, but he was so grateful for his two best friends.
Harry looks at his young son and he can feel the tears forming in his eyes. His son, his baby, is trying to ask him if he if going to kill himself. "Come here," he says to Albus. Albus walks over and pulls him into a big hug. "I'm fine. I'm not going anywhere, you hear me? I'll always be here for you. All of you."
"Same as always, Harry Potter." Aberforth smiled a bit before letting his face fall back to its usual dull expression.
"Unbelievable." Lily said still just looking at her father, "You were married for how long? 20 years? And you kept it from her?!" Lily was starting to show her anger.
Harry didn't see Draco in these days. He still felt conflicted about being with him now that he knew all of his kids didn't approve. Now they would also have to deal with the article too. How was Draco going to feel about being with him now? That article didn't just out Harry, it had outed Draco too. Would Draco ever want to be with him publicly? Harry had always avoided that conversation with him, but now he wished he hadn't.
Ron ignored her, "But if you care for him, we support you." Ron gave Hermione a look now and she let the angry look leave her face.
"Why are we in the muggle world?" Asks Draco loudly as they walk down the streets of London.
"Dad?" Albus and Scorpius both say in surprise in unison. Albus is frozen where he was standing by the door, Scorpius right behind him.
Ginny finally spoke up, "You all must be upset. Your father and I were just trying to do what's best for you. We didn't want you to have to deal with this right after the divorce."
Draco stayed close to Harry as everyone settled into the house. He still didn't know what to do with himself. He followed Harry to sit on the couch in the living room where George, Ron and Mr. Weasley were. Luna and Ginny were both helping in the kitchen. Draco silently listened in to the men's conversations.
"Good. Good." said Harry without making full eye contact.
"Oh really," Draco said as Harry gestured to Draco to move towards the living room. "Then what was it?" He asks, plopping himself on the couch, easily making himself at home.
"They both told me before she pasted that their marriage was more of an arrangement that worked well for both of them. They cared for each other; they just weren't in love, but they loved me. I guess it's weird, but I don't really remember a time when I thought they were in love." Scorpius just shrugs.
"Will you give it a chance, Malfoy?" says Harry and they catch each other's glaze before Malfoy looks down at the menu.
"You don't need to explain anything! You're with Mr. Malfoy!" He yelled angrily, then quieter he said, "You're.... gay." in shock. He finally processed what he had just seen. His father was gay. And he must be dating his best friend's dad.
"Do you veed velp in ve kitchen?" Fleur asked and followed Molly back into the kitchen as Bill headed to the living room.
"How is it not fair? What isn't fair is you freaking out like this." Scorpius said, remaining calm, "Your dad probably feels horrible right now. I just want my dad to be happy, don't you want the same for yours?"
"Aberforth Dumbledore, how have you been?" Harry called out.
"This is the end of us, isn't it?" Ginny said sadly but definitely.
"The other thing I would like to address is the rumors about my sexuality." Harry paused before saying, "I am gay."
"You'll have to stop making a habit of using my office as your own, Harry."
They showed him lots of new pranks and candies they had been working on: Gummy Balloons that you ate and then they blew you up so you started to fly into the air, they reminded Harry of the time he had blown up his Aunt Marge; Tik Tok Ticks that bit onto someone and make them hear a ticking in their ears that would drive them mad; Karaoke Bombs, a new type of fireworks that broke into song as they exploded and the sparks would spell out the lyrics; and much more.
"James!" Harry scolded, "Draco is not a Deatheater anymore, and he never wanted to be. What is wrong with you, James? You never had a problem with him or his son being friends with our family before." After he said it, Harry immediately realized he had been too stern.
"Why not?" Harry said, he was kind of sick of them using last names. It seemed a bit ridiculous now that they were friends and well... maybe something more.
The door opens, "Hello, Potter."
"Ya–" Harry quickly said instinctually. But then he thought for a second, "I... I don't know."
Together they sneak out of the castle, as to not be seen by their kids, and down to the gates.
James just scoffed. He didn't even know what he was most angry about; he just felt like he was going to explode.
Before Draco had even finished that sentence, Harry spit his drink across the bar. "What?" Malfoy asked. Harry dabbed his mouth with his sleeve and looked up at him.
"Oh, ok." Hagrid said a bit worried.
"Well, come now, everyone." Molly said,  "Let's head to the Burrow for supper."
"Thanks," Harry said, still sleepy. He wished last night was all a dream, but he knew it was real.
Draco had always exceeded ing Charms, in his years at Hogwarts he even rivaled Hermione's skill in the subject. In sixth year, he was the only student other than Hermione to cast the extremely difficult Protean charm.
"Yes, she came to me. Told me how she felt like I've been neglecting her. With all the kids out of the house, it's just been the two of us, nothing to distract us anymore. Since Lily started school last year we both started to really notice there was a problem. Only recently have I finally been able to admit to myself that I'm just not attracted to her... in that way. I tried, I did. I wanted to make her happy. I love her and care about her... just not in the same way you two feel about each other." Harry glanced up at his best friends, they didn't seem to know what to do with the information they were being given.
"Potter!" Professor McGonagall.
"I always knew there was more to you than that tough guy mask you wore at school." Luna said in her usual odd way.
"Only by a few inches!" said Albus. "Plus I don't want to stay in your room, and I don't want you in mine either!"
She felt bad for Harry. She knew exactly what he was talking about and why it was so urgent. She wrote back immediately:
"Oh course I came, Potter. I figured you were all sad and alone now that the kids have gone off; someone had to come to pick you up off the floor." Draco said sarcastically with a laugh.
"Hey..... Neville? It is a Hogwarts Hogsmade weekend?"
"Ok. Good, 'cuz that would be weird." They all laughed as if they were still just three kids in their first year of Hogwarts again; but they had always been different, they never had normal lives... and it was looking like they never would.
Ron was still a bit mad, but less so at Harry. He couldn't help but feel bad for him; Harry had been through so much and it seemed like he could never just be happy.
Scorpius was also excited to change his name to Potter and officially become one of the Potter children. Harry, of course, treated him as his own son, and Draco did the same with Al, James, and Lily. Neville also became a like a father to all of the children.
"Guys, I think I'm gay."
Harry ignored the first part, "We went to Hogsmeade and we didn't realize it was a Hogwarts weekend. Al caught us together."
"No, I have to do this on my own," Harry said and then he added, "and I don't want the kids mad at you." He looked down at his watch and then back up to his friends. "Alright, go time."
"Fine. Bloody fine, he says." Ron says to himself, "Hermione! Harry's here." he called out behind him.
But he didn't have to, "I care for you, Draco." Harry said, looking at him.
"It's ok sis, we understand." George said, "We just want to be here for you. I thought Harry was right for you, what did the brat do?"
"I told you!"
"Do you live near a muggle town?"
Albus was relieved to hear that. At least he wasn't the only one surprised today, "I can't believe them! What makes them think they can do that! We're best friends, that's not right!" Albus was so angry about his father dating his best friend's dad, maybe even more so than the fact that he was gay and hid it from him.
He removed the small vial. He had been planning this for a while. He hadn't told anyone. Everyone expected him to be happy. Voldemort was gone. The war was over. But not for Harry; he relived it every night in his dreams. He jumped and drew his wand at every sound. He saw Voldemort everywhere. How could he live a life like this? It was a life he wasn't supposed to be living anyway.
"I'm not leaving her, be both decided to split. I'm sure it'll get out sooner or later, and I wanted you to hear it from me. And I kind of should say thank you." Dean looked puzzled but said nothing, "It started a conversation that Ginny and I should have had ages ago. Ginny and I have been having problems for awhile; this isn't your fault."
Lily and Albus just remained silent, but James angrily spoke up, "Tell us what dad? That your gay? Or that you're dating a Deatheater!?"
"But you had already saved me from that fire during the battle of Hogwarts." Draco pointed out.
"YES!" Draco shouted, cutting him off. Harry had opened the box to show Draco an emerald and ruby entwined on a white gold ring. People now were looking to the couple, trying to figure out what was going on.
"Always do." She said with a smile, "It was so good seeing you, Harry."
Everyone was surprised by Draco's announcement but none as much as Harry. As far as he knew, Draco had never even had a real job - he didn't need to. And now he would be a Hogwarts professor, they both would be - and that thought made Harry so happy. He looked to Draco and Draco turned to look at him with a sly smile, obviously quite proud of himself. Harry grabbed the side of his face and pulled Draco into a deep kiss in front of the cheering crowd.
So Harry decided he better go out to buy food, even if Malfoy wasn't coming, he had nothing in the house. By 6 o'clock Harry had started cooking, just in case Draco was coming, but with Kreacher having passed years ago and no Ginny, he made quite the mess. Knives missing their mark and flying into walls, trash landing a foot away from the garbage, and spoons stirring so fast they were spraying stuff everywhere. One of the pots started to smoke profusely, and Harry had to open a window to clear the air.
About two weeks later, Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Draco were all waiting on Platform 9 3/4 together. The train pulled up in a puff of steam and through the crowd they saw their six kids coming towards them, all together as if they had rode in the same compartment.
"Al, I'm sorry. Please, lets talk." Harry pleaded with his son.
Ginny looked from Neville to the ring, she was blushing hard with a huge smile on her face. Then it fell slightly for a second as she looked to her children.
Molly didn't want to hurt her daughter anymore than she had been, "Ok Ginny, it's alright. You don't have to say anything more." She silently eyed George telling him that that was enough.
"Trust me."
"Jealous of me? My life hasn't been all glory, you know." Harry scoffed.
TRIGGER WARNING: mention of PTSD, depression and suicide
"Oh I hope it works, Harry." Hermione said pulling back.
Harry felt Ron's arms wrap around him too. "No, he's not. You are the bravest man I have ever known." Ron said.
"No, it's ok Lily, both of you," Harry looked from his daughter to his son,  "You were right. I should have been brave a long time ago, but I have to say I'm glad I wasn't. Otherwise I wouldn't have either of you." He kissed both his kids and neither protested.
"Ya? I knew it's been a few months but still. 'Ur marriage ended. You guys were together for a long time." Right, Harry thought, of course Hagrid was talking about Ginny, not Draco.
Draco looked to Harry, silently asking him with his eyes if he would take the question for him, but Harry just gave him a look of "no, you," so Draco sighed, "Uhhh..." all thirteen pairs of eyes on him, "We met up by chance at the Leaky Coudern one day." Draco began, and he told the story of their love from that day to the Hogwarts visit (skipping a few details) to the day they were caught by their sons. Not much time had past since then but still everyone laughed and chuckled except Harry. When Draco saw Harry's eyes down towards his plate, he regretted saying it, but as Harry turned back to Draco, he smiled again.
Harry and Draco taught at Hogwarts for decades until they were very old and retired, and finally bought a house for themselves.
Harry quickly explained to them how they had already been engaged before other people started coming over trying to get in their hugs and 'congratulations.' Molly came over once she was done with Ginny to grab Harry's face and then hug him, then she grabbed Draco into a big hug before insisting on a photo, gesturing to Arthur with a camera. "Molly wouldn't let me use the muggle camera. She said you'll all want moving pictures to remember this time." Arthur said before giving Harry and then Draco a hug. Then he snapped a photo of the two of them, Draco proudly showing his ring.
As Harry walked through the lobby of the Ministry of Magic on his way to his office, his mind was so wrapped up in his thoughts about yesterday with Draco, that he almost didn't notice the
Ginny looked back down at her feet as she started the story, "I went to a bar one night, while you said you were working late, I thought you might be doing something else. I wanted to... you know, forget for a little while. After quite a few drinks, an old friend came by and was trying to help me get home. I knew that he liked me so I flirted with him. He knew I was drunk so he didn't engage. When he got me back here I convinced him to take me to the bedroom. I don't remember exactly what happened but I just remembering wanting to kiss him and then doing it."
"It's the Room of Requirement. It appears when the seeker–"
"See? I told ya it'd be alright." Draco said taking the coffee Harry was handing him. Draco had been comforting Harry recently as he was still constantly worried about his relationship with his kids now that everything was out.
Those three kids were always the odd ones out– being the children of 'the chosen one,' the famous Harry Potter. Only each other knew how it felt, and now more than ever they were the only ones who understood what each other was going through.
"Can I speak with you?"
"The truth is that I care for your mom very much, but I don't.. love her." He could barley stand to look at their faces, but he resisted the urge to lower his eyes to the ground and looked at the three of them when he said, "I realized that couldn't really love her, the way she deserves to be loved," he glances back at Ginny before turning back to the kids, "because..."
"I'll start using your first name when
"But we aren't happy together, Dean. It's good that we are finally doing this." Harry was uncertain about the future but he wanted to be able to love freely, and more importantly, he wanted Ginny to be truly loved.
"Will you marry me, Draco Malfoy?" Harry asked.
"Dean." Ginny confirmed Harry's suspicions. Harry always thought that Dean never got over Ginny; Dean hadn't been in a serious relationship since he with with Ginny in school, and he was currently very single. But the way Ginny described it, he hadn't done anything wrong.
"You still can," Harry said, " We can move around, we're all going to be seeing each other during the holiday." Harry smiled looking around at his family that now included Draco and Scorpius.
Afterwards, he leisurely walked around Diagon Alley, which he hadn't done in quite a long time, in fact he couldn't remember that last time he'd done it besides when he stayed in The Leaky Cauldron prior to third year at Hogwarts.  When he saw the sign for the bar/motel, he decided to head in for a drink.
Everyone giggled and Harry shouted, "You got this Neville! Whoo!" Harry might have been the slightest bit drunk.
Time passed quickly, and sooner than they thought, Professor McGonagall came back in saying it was time to head back to their dormitory. The kids left with a wave and smiles, leaving Harry and Minvera alone.
"I don't feel like being blamed and yelled at again, Potter." Draco masked the sadness in his voice now; he was trying to sound angry. He felt torn about Harry being here. He still fancied Harry. The day they shared at Hogwarts was one of the best of his life. But it seemed like that was all over because Harry believed that he was the one to tell Rita Seeker about his
Luna offered, "I'll help you cook, Mrs. Weasley."
"Just tell us, Harry." Hermione said calmly, "Did your issues affect something?" She asked concernedly.
?" Harry said in shock. This bothered Harry, how had Dumbledore never have told him?
"Oh, prefect, did I come at your lunch break?"
"I'd rather have somewhere with a bit more privacy. I don't have much to eat at home though."
"Well, I went right to the minister anyways after she told me." Hermione continued, "I'm so sorry Harry. I should have told on her
"I know bloody well what the room of requirement is. Used it for a whole year, remember, Potter?"
But that wasn't enough for Lily, James or Albus.
"I told you!" Harry said watching Draco eat the last bite from his plate.
Headmistress McGonagall was sitting in her office one Saturday evening when an owl swooped in. She untied the letter from it's leg; she recognized the rushed scrawl:
"But all of that was nearly 25 year ago now, and I have not considered suicide since." That wasn't completely true, Harry had thought about it again, but he never planned on trying it again after that day.
Albus said nothing.
"We love you just the same. You know that, right Harry?" Hermione said to Harry in seriousness.
"I don't know." As much as Draco was comforting to Harry, he felt guilty confiding in him about all this because this relationship was exactly what his son was mad about at this very moment. "Maybe tomorrow." He said giving Draco a forced smile after seeing the sad look on his face.
"Well, we saw each other at The Leaky Cauldron one day and then we started becoming friends. Once I told him I was gay, he.... admitted he had feelings for me, and I realized I felt the same way about him."
Ron disliked saying that Harry tried to killed himself aloud almost as much as Harry did.
"Why?" A reporter immediately yelled even though they were no longer taking questions.
Harry legs gave in and he collapsed into the dirt ground. Everything was numb. He knew what he had to do. He turned the vial over in his hand, watching the little air bubble move around the side of the glass. It was a very fast acting poison, he would likely be dead before he swallowed. He unplugged the cork.
At that moment Neville walked up to the family. "Hello, everyone." he said with a smile, then turned to Ginny and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
"No, it had to be when I told Draco. We didn't tell the kids about the... we didn't tell the kids all of it, remember?" Harry said. He was still in a bit of shock. He blamed Draco. He blamed Draco and now he had fucked everything up. Draco wouldn't want to be his friend anymore, or anything more.
"Fine!" Albus says before storming out with Scorpius on his heals. The door slams behind them.
Hermione was the one to finally break the silence, "So, Malfoy and you can still..." she trailed off, unsure of what to say to make Harry feel better. She could tell he was eating himself up.
"You can have the office," Professor McGonagall said heading towards the door, "Just tell Dumbledore when your done." She looked at Harry and pointed to Dumbledore's portrait. Looking at it was still a bit hard for Harry, so he quickly glanced away. Professor McGonagall left and closed the door behind her; it was just Harry, Ginny and their children.
ago. It's all my fault." Hermione had never told on Rita because in some ways it was better to hold leverage over her then to tell and see what the ministry did about it, but if she was back up to her old tricks, she needed to be stopped for good.
Harry wanted them to completely understand, "I never really had the time to think about it. By the time our lives finally started to slow down, Ginny and I were already married; James was born. I didn't want to believe it, that I was attracted to men. So I just ignored it; we were a family, and I didn't want to ruin that. I care for Ginny, I really do. But at this point neither of us are happy being together anymore."
Harry looks up and sees a smile on Draco's face, "Hey, Malfoy." Harry said hopping up, "Let's go."
Harry looked directly into his partner's silver eyes, "I want this to be my life- our life. Forever. I never thought the way I feel towards you was even possible. The journey we went on to get here... was so much harder than it should have been. But now that I have it, I don't think I could live without it. I don't think I could live without you..."
"What? Why?" Said Harry, puzzled.
"Room of Requirement, huh? Wish we had gotten the chance- OW! Stop doing that!" Ron said as Hermione jabbed his shoulder again.
James, Lily and Albus had heard growing up that their father must be crazy or even dangerous: "Harry Potter must be fucked in the head after all he's been through!" "He was only a boy when he killed the Dark Lord, that must mess you up." "Harry Potter is good but he's still a murderer. He killed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!" Most people adored Harry for what he had done, but even those who loved him many still questioned his sanity.
This surprised all three of them. Albus didn't want to ask. James did, but after his outburst his couldn't bring himself to, so it was Lily who asked, "Who?"
"Told Albus, James and Lily they had to come home this year though. Ginny and I wanted to have some family time with everything that's been going on."
Minvera gets up and goes over to Harry with outstretched arms, "It's been far too long." she says hugging him.
"No it's not! This isn't ok and it isn't fair!" Albus was mad at Scorpius now. How could he think this? How could he be alright with all of this?
Draco continued, "But, you know, you make it through one day, then another. Then you went ahead and saved the bloody world and things got a lot easier."
Ginny turned to Harry to see if she should go on, Harry was glad to have her do so. This was harder for him to say to aloud; he never could really say the words. "Your father suffers from depression and PTSD." Ginny said as she started rubbing Harry's back. Harry was full on head in between his knees now.
"Thanks. I'll need it. We're telling the kids tonight."
"Gay?" Minerva guessed, "No, I didn't. Not for sure at least; he never told me." That made Harry feel a bit better, at least he wasn't the only one that didn't know. "But I had my suspicions." Minerva continued, "Never had much interest in women, Albus."
"We deciding to come back a little early when we saw the papers." Luna said. She looked sad; she felt bad that she and George were so in love when Ginny wasn't with Harry. For some reason, Luna had thought there was something wrong between Ginny and Harry for a while but didn't think it wasn't her place to say anything. Luna could just always tell.
When Albus saw the headline, he was filled with guilt.
It had been two months since the divorce and people were still talking about that. Rita Seeker had been publishing articles every week or so with interviews from people who supposedly knew "the real reason why" Harry and Ginny divorced, but Harry didn't care. Most of the articles blamed Harry, which Harry could live with. He had been slandered in the news quite a few times before, and he didn't want people blaming Ginny. Thankfully Ginny's drunken night hadn't gotten out either so he knew it was all nonsense.
"No you didn't!" yelled Ron, "You were just as surprised as I was!"
It was the a beautiful spring Saturday; Harry and Draco decided to go to Hogsmeade for the day. They didn't mind getting seen together, most people didn't know they were gay so everyone just assumed they had some business together or had now become friends.
Harry put his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees. Ron still looked angry but stayed silent. He was still worried about his best friend.
"Harry?"
"Oh no-" and then a look from Ginny stopped him.
Right before the school year started again, Harry and Draco had a small wedding ceremony on the grounds. Only about 30 people were there, including all the Weasleys and Narcissa and Harry and Draco's other close friends and family like Blaze and Goyle (who were quite surprised to find out Draco was gay but did not seem to take issue with it).
"And if they do Harry, we'll be fine. We have more than enough saved up for you not to work. That's never why you worked, you worked because you loved your job. But you don't seem to anymore."
"She also saved my life."
"What? How is it your fault? You know already who did it?"
He got an owl from Hermione telling him to come by her and Ron's place that night for dinner. That she needed to talk to him.
Draco said nothing, then he leaned in and kissed Harry. They held the kiss, forgetting their kids could see them (though they doubted they were watching anyway). When they finally pulled apart, "Can I take that as a 'yes'?" Harry asked softly.
"You mean... taking up the Defense Aginst the Dark Arts position?"
They reach the old, broken-down inn, "Where have you taken me, Potter?"
"I did something stupid. See.... I'm seeing someone."
Harry had told him so much already, why not tell him the truth? He felt so comfortable with Draco. "The real reason," He said sitting on a opposite end of the couch as Draco, but facing him,  "is that I'm gay."
"Why did you have to bring us home this weekend? I had plans to go the Hogsmeade with my friends." James asked his father in an annoyed tone. James, Al and Lily were all wondering the same thing - why did their parents have them sent home for the weekend?  They were all confused and slightly scared, even James, though he was trying the most out of the three to hide it.
"Long as you become a 'Malfoy' Potter!" Draco said sarcastically.
But it had been so long, and part of Harry had missed the Black Lake, the edge of the forest, and the view of the castle. He missed the stone hallways and classrooms as well, so Harry decided to head inside the castle. As he enters the large doors, he could hear a large clamor coming from the Great Hall: lunch must still be going on.
"No, I mean being alone all the time. What do you do all day?"
"Hey, is Neville free?" Harry asked, "I saw him earlier but we didn't get to speak much. He had to prepare for his lessons."
Malfoy."
Draco looked to the man he loved. It couldn't imagine spending his life with anyone else. Draco realized what that meant though; he would have to do more than make nice with the Weasleys. He would need to gain more than their acceptance, he would need their trust. And that had to start with apologizing for some of his past deeds. As much as Draco hated the idea of apologizing for anything, he knew he had done wrong and they deserved to hear him say it.
He didn't want to run into any of his kids though, it felt like a breach of privacy to do so, so Harry didn't want to go walk by the doors of the Great Hall. Just as he was about to turn away from the them, he saw a familiar face coming out towards him.
"I had a feeling you'd be fucked up by now." Draco said with a little silly smile. It lighted the mood and Harry chuckled.
"Don't tell your brother and sister, please, let me tell them." Harry needed to tell them himself. They should have all heard it from him, but James and Lily at least should now.
"Scorpius, I'm sorry." Albus said to his friend the next day at breakfast.
Harry nodded and Minvera nearly jumped for joy, "Well the current professor said he would stay one more year but if you'd like to come sooner-"
"Ya. Pretty fucked. And that's not even all of it." The words were just slipping out,  "I tried to kill myself back then, about a year after the Battle of Hogwarts. Didn't tell the kids that though." Harry couldn't believe he had just told Draco that, he wasn't even sure why.
When they got to the town, Harry found what he was looking for: Chinese food. He took Draco inside and ordered to go for the both of them as Draco looked around.
"Well we hated each other."
At this Harry just shrugged. "And what about my mother? You vouched for her too - why?"
Draco chuckled too, "Well there's no way I'm becoming a 'Potter'!" he said with a smile.
Draco looked to Harry, trying to silently ask him if that really meant he was being invited to the Weasleys'. Harry gave a slight nod, grasped Draco's hand and disapparated with the rest of the group to right outside the Burrow.
"Harry?" Draco said after a a long silence.
"Neville!"
Harry was a bit surprised. Him and Draco had been amicable since after the battle of Hogwarts, and even more so since their boys became best mates, but Harry and Draco never really became friends. Harry cautiously walks over and sits himself down next to Malfoy. There was an awkward silence for a second.
"Yes, with all the Deatheaters put away for a few years now, there hasn't really been any issues."
Harry, however, was blind with rage. "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MALFOY! YOU TOLD! YOU FUCKING TOLD RITA SEEKER! I KNOW IT WAS YOU!"
"I have an idea." Harry said leading them off the beaten path.
Everyone laughed again before Neville continued. He turned to Ginny, "Ginny, as much as I love Harry, I am glad you two divorced," again everyone laughed. Harry was smiling to himself, knowing what was coming. He thought Neville was doing a great job. "...because I am so glad I found you again. I am so glad we found what we have now. I know its been a crazy ride, for all of us," Neville glanced at Harry and Draco for a quick moment before looking back at Ginny, "but I think this is how it was meant to be. I am so happy with you. I love you." Harry looked at his kids to see them all smiling as they looked back and forth between Neville and their mom. "And I-I know it's soon, but I am more than ready to start my life with you. I don't want to waste a moment. So," Neville paused to get down on one knee in front of Ginny pulled out a ring box and opened it, "Ginny, will you marry me?"
"Oh hush hush, I was only joking, boy." They both lightly chuckled.
Harry ignored him for a second, putting up two fingers, "Two meads please, Aberforth." and led Draco to a table before answering, "Dumbledore's brother."
"Enough!" Lily finally yelled over her brothers, "I can't take this anymore!" Lily still wasn't happy with her dad for keeping such a big secret from them that he was gay, but she couldn't stand the way her brothers were acting. "Why are you two so angry with mom and dad being happy!?" she said looked back and froth between the two brothers on either side of her. Although she was the youngest, she was usually the voice of reason.
Draco was sitting in his house when he turned on the radio and heard Harry's voice, "...other thing I would like to address is the rumors about my sexuality."
It would be nice to have Draco as a friend. The past was behind them, and their kids were best friends after all. Plus, Harry needed someone new to talk to. Ron and Hermione were still his only good friends because Harry was still seen as quite the celebrity. He wished he could just be like anyone else, but people don't forget when you kill the Darkest Wizard of all time and end two wars.
"I..." Harry started to defend himself but stopped, "I'm sorry." he just said, defeatedly.
Harry asked, "Who?" But he already had a guess.
After they had both gained control of themselves again, "Shall we get dinner then?" Draco asked.
"No." Harry cut her off, "Another year is prefect. I think I need some time off." Harry said glazing out the window to the lake shimmering with the day's last rays of sunshine.
"Draco! We have to go; it's a Hogwarts weekend!" Draco jumped up, he didn't want to surprise run into his son either. They left the rest of their butterbeer and headed towards the door, "Bye Neville!" Harry yelled on his way out.
"I'm afraid it's not that simple. I have been getting better, and I've been doing a lot better. But it's just been too many years of strain. We don't love each other the way we used to." That last part was a lie, he loved Ginny just as much as he did the day he married her. It was just never the right type of love.
Harry thought about Albus' reaction and knew Ginny was right. "Alright then," Harry said standing up, "I'll write to Minerva."
." Draco had only been using Harry's first name very occionsally. Usually when they were being serious.
"Well I spend most of my days at home by myself and don't bother to cook. Mother never bothered to learn to cook after the house-elf left." Hearing Dobby being referenced pulled at Harry's heartstrings a bit, but Draco just continued on. "So I just make up whatever is around the house, usually its cold."
Ginny started to cry, she so was ashamed of what she had done. "I was touching him, Harry! After I second he pushed me off, but still... I wanted to..." Ginny knows that if he hadn't stopped her, she would have slept with him, which was bad as cheating in her eyes. Harry had kept secrets from her, but he hadn't acted on anything.
"No, I haven't heard much from the kids since the divorce, neither has Ginny. Her and I still talk and we're on good terms, despite what the Daily Prophet writes."
This was how sex was supposed to be: fun, enjoyable, freeing. Harry was used to thinking and stressing during sex, but now his mind was consumed with one thought: Draco.
Trigger warning: talk of suicide/mental health
"No way!" Harry joked back, chuckling, "I'm
Ron looked star-struck. He was at a loss for words. Hermione looked surprised as well. Neither of them were expecting this.
Harry pulled back and looked at the man he loves, but now in a completely different way. When he looked at Draco, he saw his own selfishness. "I have to go. I need to speak to Ginny. We're gonna have to tell James and Lily now."
"Alright." Draco leaned in and gave Harry a peck on the lips before Harry disaparated.
"Guys... I don't know how to tell you this..."
"It's been awhile since I've had someone to call mother." Luna said with a smile.
"If they find out we've been keeping it from them later, they'll just be more mad."
"You got all the attention." Draco continued in earnest, "I was used to the center of attention back then, and I liked it. Everyone loved you, still do."
"Ginny, what a nice surprise! How are you honey?"
"It's not your fault Hermione. It's mine."
"What? How?" Ginny asked wide-eyed.
Then there was a moment of silence. Harry was quiet now. He didn't know what more to say.
Aberforth looks from Harry to Draco, "I see." he says and then pauses, but he doesn't turn to leave, "My brother was gay too, you know."
Harry grabbed a quill and wrote on the back of the same parchment,
"What?!" Albus doesn't want to hear anything from his father right now. He just needed to get away.
"I've uhh... got to go! Sorry. Got to prep for lessons!" Neville waved as he headed towards the stairs that led down to the dungeons.
"Well, I doubt anything will happen now." Harry told them, "I yelled at him, told him we were done. I don't know if he'll forgive me." he said sadly, looking back down to the ground.
"You love who you love Harry, you can't change that. There is nothing perfect about this world; you of all people know that best." She said looking into his green eyes that were now on the brink of tears. "How are we going to tell them?" Ginny asked sadly.
, Potter." He said, still smiling.
"Oh Potter, glad I ran into you again." She said, either not noticing or at least not acknowledging Harry's disheveled appearance, just continuing quickly,  "The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is retiring soon already - lasted four years this one - and I was wondering if you would reconsider taking up the position. I know the last time I asked you said you didn't want to work here while the kids are still here, but you really are the best man for the job. And the ministry must be getting boring with nothing going on. You know its never a dull year at Hogwarts, and you would have so much to teach the students..."
Then Molly insisted on a photo with Ginny and Neville and Draco and Harry. Then more with other people, all the while people were still trying to give Harry hugs, pats on the back, and handshakes. It was chaos for a while, but finally it came to a end and it was time for 'Happy Birthday' and cake.
"This is delicious!" Draco said, "I might have to start picking up this muggle food for myself."
Draco again was in shock, "Why though?"
The prefect led James and Lily to the gargoyle and told them to wait there. They were soon joined by Albus and the head of Slytherin house, who gave the password, "British Short-hair" (Professor McGonagall had made the passwords to her office different breeds of cats).
Albus finally turned back to see the mixed expressions on his brother and sister: they looked worried and confused. "Because I know." Albus wanted to keep his promise to his dad, despite his father lying to him.
"Oh baby, it's ok. You can tell us. Get it out. We won't do anything irrational to Harry. We just want to help you."
"Let's not let this tear us all apart." Luna said, "Ginny, do you think we can all still be friends, be family? Harry was family to you guys long before you two were married, right? Can we all still get along? I know it will be a bit weird, but let's not turn against Harry." said Luna. She was trying to be kind to Ginny and didn't want to lose her or Harry as friends or now, family. She loved them both and was really hoping that sides weren't forming.
"Oh, right." said Harry quietly.
Harry giggled a bit to himself but said, "Ya, it is nice," with a smile.
Harry had stepped into that. Harry and Ginny looked at each other and silently communicated what they were about to tell the kids. It wasn't the reason they divorced, but it was true. And it was going to be almost as hard as telling them his sexuality.
The faces saddened. "He didn't want to come." James replied, then he rushed into saying, "Dad, I'm so sorry I called you a coward. You're the bravest man I know. I can't believe you stood up and told everyone. That was incredible and I know that took a lot of strength." he said without stopping for air.
James and Lily come over and all have a group hug. Then they each hug their mom.
"Ya..." Harry didn't know what he could do to make this right. He felt so ashamed for the way he blamed and treated Malfoy. He hadn't even given him a chance to defend himself.
After living with Ginny and all the kids for a while again, his apartment felt very empty. Harry suddenly realized he hadn't written a letter to Draco since before Christmas. He took out a quill, ink and piece of parchment.
"Accio Resurrection Stone." Harry wasn't sure if it would work, but from out of the darkness flew a small stone right into his hand. He stuck it in his pocket without turning it over. He didn't need to see his family right now. He would be with them in a few short moments. This way, Hermione and Ron could talk to him one last time when they found him, and then hopefully, destroy the stone for good.
She was sobbing quite loudly now. Everything was just flooding out of her: the guilt of that night, all the feelings she had been bottling up about not feeling loved by Harry, the grief this would mean for her family. Harry put his arm around her shoulder and was rubbing it and saying "Shhh... It's ok honey, it'll be ok." When she had pulled herself together a bit, she finished, "After that he apologized and left, and I went to bed. "
For the first time, James, Albus, and Lily all decided to stay at Hogwarts for the Easter holiday. Harry and Ginny were both a bit worried about their kids; they knew they had gone through a lot this year. Which was the other reason Harry was keeping his relationship secret, he still hadn't even gotten to telling the kids he was gay.
The man looked up at him. "Potter! What are you doing here?" Draco asked without the sarcastic tone Harry was used to hearing from his Hogwarts days.
"Ronald, please, that's enough. Let Harry explain." Hermione said, always the voice of reason, sitting herself on the couch.
"Sure." Harry sits on the coach. Hermione sits next to him.
After work Harry took the floo network to Ron and Hermione's. Ron was waiting for him on the couch, "Harry!" he said with a smile and gave Harry a hug. "How are you doing?"
But Harry was starting to feel very alone again, feeling separated from everyone besides Ron and Hermione. He still hadn't told anyone else he was gay, not even the Weasleys. He hadn't seen Molly since the divorce. She even invited him over one night, probably to yell at him, maybe not, but Harry didn't want to take that chance, so he put it off, telling her he had to work late that night.
All of the kids were having so many thoughts race through their heads:
"I wanna go to then!" Albus said. He looked from his father to his mother.
In the end, Draco "caved" and took the last name 'Potter'. He said he wanted to share the same last name as the person he loved, which was true, but he also wanted to get away from everything his last name meant: the pureblood elitism, connections to Voldemort, and so on. Draco had lost much of his pureblood mentality during his first marriage, since Astoria did not feel that way and the last of that thinking died off after dating a halfblooded and spending time with his muggle-born and muggle-loving friends.
After thinking that, it was almost painful for Harry to tell Ron and Hermione the next bit, "A few days later I went to go visit Hagrid. Malfoy was at Hogwarts for the school board... something. We uh...." this last part felt really weird to talk to his friends about. It felt like he had come out to them only yesterday. "We slept together," Harry finally said, "in the Room of Requirement."
"I have something to tell you all too." Ginny said calmly, but apprehensively. She was worried about telling the kids right now, but she didn't want them to take everything out on Harry. "I have been seeing someone else too."
Then Harry felt Draco's arms wrap around him. It was so conforming. Harry was in love with Draco; that was so clear to him now. He had just told Draco that. And Draco said it back. He thought back to what was only minutes ago, before their sons walked in on them.
"HARRY!" Ron's voice rang through the night, "HARRY! WAIT!"
"You didn't tell us this was a whole family affair!" Harry called out to Mrs. Weasley who came bustling in for a second time to kiss her son and daughter-in-law.
After that all the kids when back to the Malfoy's with Harry and Ginny and Neville got some time to themselves. Even though they were seeing each other for months, they hadn't got to spend a lot of time together while Neville was teaching. So Draco and Harry, who would soon have an entire year to themselves, took the kids for a week.
Overlapping timelines for chapters 16 & 17
James meanwhile, having graduated from Hogwarts, got a position on the Appleby Arrows quittach team as a beater. George and Luna had their child, a baby boy named Fred. Then they had a baby girl named Pandora, named after Luna's mother. The children each followed in the footsteps of their parents, Fred becoming a Gryffindor and Pandora a Ravenclaw, the first Weasley in generations to not be in Gryffindor.
It was true, Harry had stayed at Draco's nearly every night of the past few weeks. It was starting to feel more like home than his apartment. Draco had set up a whole closet for Harry to keep stuff there. "Uhh...." Harry had no idea what to say to the boy. Draco just gave him a look that said 'well I'm good with that.'
"You carry mugg.... I mean...
read the message he had left for Ron to find back in the house they shared together; they worked together at the Ministry now. Harry wanted to leave one for his girlfriend, Ginny, but he couldn't find the words for her. Hermione was behind him, up the hill in the Hogwarts castle, finishing her 7th year.
"Albus?" said Harry.
"Thats ridiculous! I have friend in my year who knows he's gay. How could it possibly have taken you most of your adult life!?" She didn't stop to consider her father's past with the war, his issues– she didn't understand.
In the United States, they met up with American wizards, which was the first non-european wizards either Harry or Draco had met. They took a tour of Ilvermorny and were quite impressed even though neither would admit it, constantly whispering to each other how Hogwarts was far superior.
Ron spoke up before Hermione even got the chance to answer, "Whatever you have to say you can say in front of me." Draco saw Hermione give her husband a look that blatantly read "I can take care of myself," but she turned back to Draco and said nothing.
Draco didn't mind sneaking around. He was much more conformable with his sexality at this point than Harry was, and he didn't really care if people found out he was gay. It might cause a bit of trouble with his mother. They had never really spoken about it, but Draco had his suspicions that she knew, or at least had her own suspicions about it. Draco was just so happy to finally have Harry as his.
"Ya, quite the bond they have. Reminds me of you and your buddies, never one without the others." He giggles and smiles.
"Hey, Harry." He looked to Draco and then back to Harry, "Harry, could I speak to you for a moment?"
At 7 on the dot, the fire place burned green and out stepped Malfoy. "You came." said Harry slightly surprised, even though he had just spent the last hour cooking for his arrival.
"Sorry." Malfoy said.
"I've got a pretty good guess ya, the only person it could be. Draco Malfoy."
James, quite the opposite, was still internally freaking out about everything that was going to change. He felt like someone just turned his whole life upside-down.
Draco froze where he stood about ten feet away from Harry. He looked as if he had been stunned. "I–" he started to say.
"Yes... and no. You hated each other too much to truly be enemies. You blamed him for everything. Well, he was always looking to get you in trouble as well. But you seemed to go out of your way to pick fights with him and you were always talking about him– heard you in the hallways constantly. And I would catch Malfoy talking about you too to his friends. Even though it was about how much you each hated the other, you two were just too...
"This is so nice," Harry said, petting Draco's snowy owl who he had taken a liking to as it reminded him of Hedwig. Draco had recently admitted to Harry that he had gotten the bird for that very reason; it reminded Draco's of Harry's old pet, which reminded Draco of Harry. He had been quite embarrassed to admit this since it was before they were even together, but Harry found it endearing.
Ginny doesn't cry, and not because of she's in shock, she's not; she already knew the answer.  Harry finally just says,"I'm so sorry, Ginny."
"Yes, it was about time." Minerva responded.
Harry wasn't going to be put the blame on anyone else anymore. This was entirely his fault now, "No, Hermione, it's not. It's mine I should have been more careful."
"Isn't it a bit sexist that we're all loundging around while the women are in the kitchen?" Bill asked turning to the rest of the men.
"Oh yes!" She replied to Harry, "I told Charlie too but I'm not sure if he's going to make it."
"That I do not know, Harry. I am merely paint, a figment of the man you knew - well maybe more of a
Harry thought of writing him a letter asking to talk but he had a feeling Draco would just rip it up before reading it. So, the day after his talk with Ron and Hermione, Harry apparated to Draco's house again. This time he rang the bell and waited at the door.
"It's weird name. Your not hairy at all. I would know." Draco said with a smirk.
"That's kind of sad."
James told his siblings about this when he remembered it. The three of them got much closer over that break. They felt separated from their parents, and that pushed them more towards each other. They had long talks about what they had learned about their father and what life was going to be like with their parents now divorced.
"Yes, Harry and I are on good terms. He's still family."
The two men make their way to a small restaurant on the corner and get seated at a small table across from each other.
Harry and Ginny felt terrible. For a second, both of them wished they could take it back. Wait until the children were older. But they knew it wouldn't do any good. If they tried to stay together longer just for the kids, it would just put a lot of strain on the family. Both Harry and Ginny believed this was for the best.
"Well stop saying stupid shit!" Hermione said to Ron. Then she turned back to Harry. "Harry, it's not Malfoy's fault."
Harry couldn't wait until after work. He let himself on break and apparated straight to Draco's front door. He let himself in using
Draco looked up at the teetering house before following everyone inside. It looked exactly how he had always expected the Weasley house to look, but it was like he was seeing it through different eyes. The features of it  he would have made fun of in the past, now seemed fun and cosy. He realized how much he changed since Hogwarts, and also since he started dating Harry.
Unbenonced to Harry, Draco gave a small nod to Minvera, and Minvera nodded back. Then Draco rose, standing next to Harry. "The same year I..." Draco started to speak, everyone else looked as if this was proceeding as plan, but Harry had no idea what was about to come out of Draco's mouth, "...will be filling the Charms position as Professor Filtwick will, alas, be retiring."
The second day after the press conference and family dinner, Draco was still staying at Harry's apartment. I was weird for Harry not to have to go to work in the mornings now that he had officially left his job, but it was really nice just being able to spend time with Draco.
"Haven't stopped by the store in a while, Harry." said George, "You should come by sometime and see all the new stuff me and Ron have been working on."
"To Harry and Draco!" everyone chanted in unison.
"Harry... I've been seeing someone too." Ginny said nervously. She wasn't sure how he was going to take to her dating their friend.
Harry sighed, he hadn't really thought about the Daily Prophet getting to Hogwarts but of course it would. "No, Lily. I did not cheat on your mom. Everything that has been written in the paper was made up."
He tied it to his son's owl's leg and with a little hoot it was off back through the bedroom and out the window. This must have woken Draco because Harry started to hear a stir from his bedroom.
and last one wasn't signed but he recognized his ex-wife's rushed handwriting,
After that the waiter came by and took their orders. When it came Draco actually enjoyed the food, though he didn't want to admit it to Harry.
Harry was barley paying attention to what she was saying; his mind hadn't fully left Draco yet. Then from behind him he heard a door open. He looked behind him and out stepped Draco, who was holding his robes in his arms and hadn't bothered to fix his hair either.
"Ya.. well that's why I did it. I owed her, I owed you. Not just for my own life, but for the defeat of Voldemort. Otherwise I would have been dead before I got to kill him. So I figured I could at least keep you out of Azkaban." Harry also didn't believe that Draco or Narcissa were truly bad people, but he wasn't about to admit this is Draco. They were both forced into service with Voldemort by Lucius. They didn't really deserve Azkaban in Harry's mind.
Harry actually felt relieved. Ginny was happy. And Neville was a great guy, a great friend, and he had never found anyone. Neville looked at Harry nervously, as if he was afraid Harry was going to say he hated that or that they couldn't be friends anymore. Harry smiled at him and he relaxed. "I'm really happy for you guys, I mean it."
The two sit and talk for a while. Mostly about James, Albus, and Lily. Also reminiscing about Harry's times at Hogwarts. She does him curtesy of not asking Harry the reason for the divorce, and so the topic of Harry's sexuality doesn't come up. He's not even thinking about it when he gets up to go, hugging her again.
"This, of course," Ginny said, "stays in the family. Don't go telling
on himself  and says, "Yes. Yes he is."
Harry continued, "And for some reason, I don't know why, I told him. I really trusted him. He opened up to me too, and then I told him I was gay." As Harry relived this, he realized maybe he made a mistake. If Draco had been the one to tell Rita Seeker, why didn't he also tell Seeker he was gay? Surely that would have made an even better story. And why would Draco have told him about his own struggles? And why would he have... "Then he kissed me, and suddenly left in a hurry." But surely thats why he rushed away, to go tell Rita the story. It had to be Draco.
Harry set the letter off with his owl. He hoped it would get to him in time. When he wrote a letters to Draco, he usually didn't get a response until the next day. Harry realized he didn't know where Draco lived anymore. Scorpius usually came to visit the Potters; Harry couldn't remember Albus ever going to the Malfoys'. So Harry had no clue how far the letter who have to go, and surely even if it did make it, their wouldn't be enough time for a return owl.
Harry woke up on Ron's couch the next morning to the smell of coffee. He found Ron in the kitchen.
Draco smiled in a way Harry had never seen Draco smile before. It was a real, happy smile, before he turned and walked out the door.
Right after Harry's birthday, which they spent in L.A., they headed back home, which was now Hogwarts. Harry's lease in his apartment had ended and he had moved out before they left on their trip. He still had Grimland place. Draco even sold his house, saying their was too many memories of Astoria there. All of their things were currently at Malfoy Manor. Scorpius now had a room set up there, but Harry and Draco's things were still in boxes waiting to be moved to their new room at Hogwarts.
"We uh... George!"
Ginny looked concerned, "Come in." she said, "What is it?" she asked once Harry was inside and she had closed the door behind him.
Ginny stopped by his office in the afternoon and gave him a hug. She still wanted to comfort Harry. He had always been family and he always would be to her. Harry felt the same way about her.
Minerva smiled, "I think that would do you good, Potter."
"It's Draco Malfoy."
Harry had written Ron and Hermione a letter the day before telling them he and Ginny were splitting up. Hermione wrote back telling Harry he better come over to talk about it.
"I knew it." She said looking at them, "After you both were married, I thought I had lost." she said to herself and then looked back up at the two men, "Excuse me while I write to Sprout, she owes me 10 gallons." she smiled in a giddy way and then hurried down the hall.
He knocked on the door, and Hermione answered. "Harry? What's wrong?" she asked seeing the sad look on his face.
Draco smiled wide, then he joked, "Since when do you use my first name, Potter?"
The two men talked and laughed and smiled and stuffed their faces.
"It's the sex isn't it?" George asked jokingly with a smirk. But then he looked over at Luna for a quick glance and Ginny could tell he was thinking about something dirty. Even though she knew it was just a joke, she felt weird that he said that in front of their mother because it was partly true.
"Ya, well they were right. They shouldn't be learning stuff from the papers, they should be hearing it from me." Harry said sounding disappointed. He knew this wasn't going to change anything with his kids, that wasn't why he was doing it, but he was still upset about how bad his relationship with his children had gotten.
People he worked with were a bit awkward, some trying to get him to tell them why he divorced Ginny, some believed the papers. However, Harry was the boss so they had to listen to him no matter what they thought.
"Don't say that, you are not! You're a great dad, Harry!" Ron said defensively.
"Dean, one more thing:" Harry said before Dean left, "Ginny really isn't into you. I just thought you should know, time to move on man." Harry wasn't trying to be mean, he was trying to do him a favor.
"Fine." he lied.
Draco watched Harry turn to look at him before he answered, "It's been almost 5 months now."
Ron was steaming mad when Harry got there and almost immediately started yelling. His face was so red he looked as if he was about to explode, and he was screaming so loud that Hermione had to put a silencing charm on the room so they didn't wake up the neighbors.
"Don't mock my mother, Potter!" said Draco, be he didn't really seem too angry about it. "Now tell me what you're going on about."
"You didn't know as much about my brother as you thought you did." Aberforth said, addressing Harry. "You never thought about how close he and Grindelwald were? I'm sure you know about what happened between them with the Deathly Hallows."
Dinner talk was about Harry's speech and how brave he was to hold the press conference. Some people asked about their relationship but directed the questions mostly to Harry. Everyone seemed a bit apprehensive to address Draco directly. The Wealseys were also all catching up on how they've each been since they'd seen each other last.
becomes Malfoy!" They both laughed.
?" Harry said sarcastically.
, he thought,
"No matter what people say about you, you will always be the boy who is defeated... Voldemort." Draco was not used to saying the name, but there was no point in fearing it any longer. Draco had watched him die - watched Harry Potter kill him - and he was never coming back. "And there will always be people who love you for that. You ended a war, Harry Potter, nothing will change that."
"Ya, seriously what's up with you?" James said in an annoyed tone.  "Do you know what's going on?"
It was a sunny afternoon when all the kids were practicing flying on brooms over the backyard as Harry and Draco watched from the porch with a pitcher of ice-cold spiked lemonade. The couple looked out at their little family.
"Thanks, Hermione."
Harry was disappointed but he understood. He still missed Dumbledore nearly every day.
"How's the food dear? Good?" asked Molly.
"Listen, Ginny. This is not your fault." Harry didn't think Ginny had cheated. Even she really had, he was the one that pushed her into the arms of another man. "Even if you weren't drunk, I wouldn't blame you. You've been living with me for years and I've never been able to love you the way I should have. Then here comes someone you used to love who still has those feelings for you."
"I love you too." Draco said, "But what about the kids?"
"Well... it's not completely new to him. He already knew I'm gay." Draco says.
"I've moved out." Harry told all of them, "Your mother is staying here. During summer you'll stay here with you're mom but I'll be around or you can come sleep by me sometimes. We'll all stay here together for the holidays still. How does that sound?"
"Yes, I got a letter from James." Harry said pouring two cups of coffee.
"Not your fault," Draco said to Harry's surprise, "They would have locked him away with or without your help. After the Dark Lord fell, it was inevitable. I'm still surprised mother got off and I didn't even have to go to trial."
"Yes, there's one within walking distance from my house. But–"
"Fine!" Albus says before storming out with Scorpius on his heals, letting the door slam behind them.
Harry then looked to Dumbledore's portrait, who had been quietly listening in. Then he spoke to it, something, despite his frequent trips to Hogwarts this year, he hadn't done in years. "Why didn't you tell me?"
