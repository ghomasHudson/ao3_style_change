“Yeah, that would be cool. I can always chat to him and see where it goes.” The other men nodded, and Dean wrote the address down for him. Harry folded it up and put in the pockets of his shorts, thanking them.
Fleur let me know that you had the flu. You really shouldn’t have made yourself more ill just to attend the meeting. I would have understood if you had postponed our meeting for a different date.
“Mr Potter. What a pleasure.” Harry tried to hide his own surprise and held out a hand. He shook the other man’s hand, taking in how soft the skin was. They stepped away from one another and Malfoy’s lips looked as though they wanted to form themselves into the smirk that he usually had reserved specifically for Harry.
“I want you to cut my hair short. You’ve cut everyone’s hair in this house and it always looks awesome. Even Hermione’s, and you know she’s very particular about her hair, especially after the hairdresser that ‘specialised in black people’s hair’ messed it up so bad. I never thought she’d let anyone touch it ever again.”
He sent Luna and Fleur off while he finished Hermione’s hair and did Ginny’s. He tasked Luna with getting him another cup of tea and asked Fleur to check with Bill to see how Ron was doing. Ginny’s hair didn’t need a lot doing to it, just wetting, some mousse, a quick blow dry and some styling product. Hermione’s just needed the curls stretching slightly and finishing off with the hair dryer. Cho had done Hermione’s makeup while her hair had been fixing and she looked stunning. She had a slight shimmer on her eyelids with eyeliner and mascara that made her long, thick lashes frame her eyes beautifully. They’d chosen a nude lip and her skin looked like it was bathed in sunlight. Harry and Cho made a good team. It was coming up to twelve thirty by the time they’d finished and that gave them all an hour and a half before the ceremony started, plenty of time for the Bridal party to get themselves into their outfits and for Harry to get himself ready. He sat and sipped his cup of tea, soaking in the moments of silence before everything started back up again. He chatted with Cho about her makeup business as he said he would, and her answers just made him more certain that his salon was something he wanted to set up. She made the point that her mobile business would have different pros and cons to a stationary shop, but that she thought Harry should go for it. It was clearly something that he enjoyed and something that he was good at. He blushed slightly at the complements, but he felt pride swell inside him. He finished his cup of tea and went to get ready and find Ron.
Draco Malfoy was near the back of the congregation with Pansy. He was wearing black dress robes with silver detailing that contrasted starkly with his pale skin. His hair was slicked back and plaited, secured with what looked like a black ribbon. Harry wondered what the other man’s hair would look like when it wasn’t tied back. Draco was still pointy, but it suited him. It made him look aristocratic and refined. Harry had to admit to himself that he carried the look well, and he was undoubtably attractive. Harry bet he was still a prat though. It was as though Malfoy could sense Harry’s gaze on him and he fixed his own grey eyes, almost like molten silver, directly on Harry. Malfoy smirked and Harry turned his attention back to the ceremony. He could still feel Malfoy’s eyes burning into him and it made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“You’re meant to be nocturnal you silly bird.” Harry said fondly, stroking the small owl’s feathers before tying the note to him and sending him off. He’d never bought a new owl after losing Hedwig, but he guessed that he would probably have to get one at some point. He couldn’t borrow Pig forever, especially if he was going to move out to Gimmauld. He couldn’t believe that he was actually considering moving there, or setting up a salon, but when he thought about it, it seemed to make sense to him somehow. He sat at the kitchen table with a cup of tea and watched the sun come up. Ginny was the first person up, as they usually were. They liked to train early in the day because it wasn’t as warm.
The door closed and Harry startled, mostly awake. A toad-like woman in a hideous shade of pink walked through the classroom, using her wand to write on the chalkboard about O.W.L's. She was muttering something that sounded a lot like gibberish until Ron snapped that Cedric hadn't just died of his own accord.
She-weasel rolled her eyes, before grabbing what looked like a spare-rib from one of the containers. Harry sat up and looked at him.
Potter shrugged. "He's a decent guy. He'd probably give you the time of day if you didn't act like a prat. Though he rarely leaves Hogwarts grounds these days. Herbology professor."
Forty-eight hours later and Draco recieved a letter during breakfast. It had the ministry official stamp on it. He forced himself not to get his hopes up. For all he knew, it was a rejection letter. Pansy glanced at him with a raised eyebrow but he just shook his head. She didn't need to know anything. He cracked the seal and read through before getting up. He headed straight to the gryffindor table and tapped Harry on the shoulder. His soulmate looked up with a frown.
Draco felt as if he'd been punched in the gut. The air rushed out of his lungs and he fell sideways. His eyes closed to an endless, terrifying white.
Draco couldn't tell whether it was mindless babble or an order, but either way, his body responded and he felt himself drift off.
"Padfoot, you're not supposed to be here," Harry sighed, flopping back down. "You're gonna get caught."
As she took his hand to prove a point, she felt something in his skin. Before he could stop her, she pulled his hand closer and stared at the writing carved into his flesh. He yanked his hand back and started to walk away. She followed him and pulled him to a stop just outside the portrait hole.
A chill ran down his spine. Harry had seen so much. He'd been exposed to adult problems way before his time. His eyes dropped to the floor. His father was a faithful servant to a madman. He'd probably done some of the exposing. Harry was suddenly beside him and put a hand on his shoulder, the soulmates connection providing a low level comfort.
The pureblooded prick couldn't keep the sneer out of his voice. Harry shook his head and packed up his stuff. How was he bound to such an unbelievable git? Why did the universe or fate or anyone with half a braincell think that they'd ever be good together? They hadn't had a single good interaction. At least none with words involved. He headed outside, not caring that it was cold, and aimed to find somewhere else to hide.
"When I say he was off, I mean he didn't insult me or act like a prat in any regard. Almost like he was scared."
Instantly there was a wand pointed at his throat. At least there was for all of five seconds before Harry was in possession of it. Weasley didn't stop glaring.
A while later he was woken up by the dorm room slamming shut and his curtains being yanked open. Hermione looked enraged.
Apparently being close to Malfoy was enough to wake him up just a little. He opened his eyes only to see Malfoy passed out, not breathing beside him. His heart seized. He didn't care about Malfoy, wanted nothing to do with the soulmates rubbish, but seeing the other boy dead was too stark of a reminder. Pain surged through him and tears welled in his eyes. The exhaustion tried to take over, to drag him into permanent unconsciousness, but he fought against it.
Draco didn't seem reassured as he sat up. He rolled his eyes and held his hand out, offering the pureblood physical reassurance despite there being no danger. Draco had a lot to unlearn and Harry would just have to learn patience with him. Now that he'd accepted the soulmates connection, it didn't feel like quite so much of a task. He looked at Remus then around the room.
"You didn't kill anyone, Draco. That's less than me. Even if the person I killed was a megalomaniac, I still killed someone. You couldn't kill Dumbledore, even though you were ordered to. You didn't do the worst crime, but you are punished like a deatheater. I killed someone and I'm praised like the second coming of Jesus."
Harry nodded. "Can get shot glasses if you prefer but tis alcohol and kills germs. Join me in drowning your problems, Malfoy. Works a charm."
Draco looked up at him, straight in the eye. "Given that we spent hours on it earlier, I'd say that suggestion was ridiculous. I'm just wondering how much of a difference it would make if we had our own ones."
It didn't take long before they heard loud barking followed by Lupin's laughter. Harry whistled and the black dog from before ran up to him, knocking him over. Draco looked down at them as Harry wrestled to get the dog off of him. Lupin walked over and he forced himself to stay still. It wasn't a full moon. Werewolves were no more of a threat than anyone else every other day of the month.
They'd been on the train for hours when the journey came to a dramatic halt. The air chilled and a bitter pulse formed in his gut, spurring him out of his seat. Whatever was happening wasn't normal and they were nowhere near Hogwarts yet. He told his friends to stay put while he slowly walked down the train towards Malfoy. It wasn't something he wanted to do. It wasn't something he would have done by choice, but whatever was happening, posed a threat to the one he had to protect. He didn't bother entering the slytherin compartment. He stood guard in the corridor as a cloaked ghostly thing entered the train. Harry felt the coldness seep into his bones but didn't allow the subsequent fear to consume him. Instead, he raised his chin and released his wings.
Draco was on the edge of a panic attack. His last hour of work was hideously grating on his nerves and was temporarily glad that he wasn't in possession of a wand. Otherwise the potions master would have been hexed within an inch of his life. There were only so many snarky comments he could take in one day and the limit was being reached. When five o'clock hit, he was out of there. Harry had informed him that the floo only worked in one direction from Grimmauld Place unless it had been permitted into the closed network. While it made sense, Draco was not looking forward to the short walk to the Leaky Cauldron. It was the closest floo network linked and, even though the walk would take him all of ten minutes at most, there were any number of eventualities that could occur. Somehow he knew that it wouldn't be as simple as walking in a straight line.
Draco snorted. "Nobody forced me but you're not far off on the panic side. It's got nothing to do with them being muggles though. Just too many people. Don't even know why I went."
Ron sighed, crossing his arms. "You know, mum will only wait so long before she comes over here. You know that as well as I do. Same goes for 'Mione."
Obviously, the house didn't offer a response aside from pushing back against his attempt at rearranging the wards. He grunted with the effort but after half an hour, the house conceded to his will. He changed into comfortable clothes before tentatively knocking on the guest bedroom door.
Hermione nodded and the two slytherins did the same. Whatever the outcome... she prayed to all the gods she didn't believe in for fate to come to only one.
Hermione sighed. "Harry was rejecting his soulmate. We don't know if it happened completely yet or not."
Harry burst out laughing. "Not that kind of coming, Draco. Muggles think Jesus was the son of a magic being in the sky that they worship. Or some do anyway. Never really understood it but Petunia was right uppity about him. Then again, anything that bitch believes in is likely a whole bunch of bollocks."
Harry shrugged and got up. He led them out of the great hall and into an empty classroom. Once there, Draco braced himself for an argument.
Harry frowned while Hermione lifted her wand and cast a muffling charm around the bed. Hopefully that meant Pomfrey wouldn't come storming over in the space of a heartbeat. The two girls glanced between him and Draco with very intense looks.
He nodded. "I know. I'd like to say goodbye to my mother but I don't really know how to go about that without alerting my father. I'm essentially becoming a blood traitor, after all."
He finished the letters and gave them to Hedwig, telling her to deliver Hermione's first because Ron was on holiday for a few more days. Once she was out the window, he sat down on the squeaky bed and wondered if he should have sent a letter to Malfoy too. That idea was quickly shut down because he knew for a fact that the slytherin git wouldn't believe him. He'd have to show him the dream. Vision was probably the better word for it.
He entered the bank and even the goblins looked up at him. They all appeared rather stunned. To his utter surprise, Griphook rounded the desk and walked up to him.
"No. Just curious. Didn't ever expect to see you in a muggle club. Trying to work out if someone forced you too and the sheer number of muggles made you panic."
conversation just yet. He wanted to delay the reality for as long as possible. He quickly collected the things he needed for broom maintanance and paid, barely avoiding being caught by the blond he was bound to protect. He resented his inheritance for a brief minute. He just had to get bound to an idiot who thought the world revolved around him. He sighed. Of course he did. The Malfoy's he'd met were convinced the world did revolve around them. They expected everything to be done to their standard and sneered at anything that didn't fit. Of course Malfoy behaved the way he did when he had Lucius as a role model. Once safely away from the Quidditch shop, he released his wings again and finished shopping.
He sighed. "When my inheritance came through, I saw a vision. It's my duty as an angel to protect. I'm bound to it. Unfortunately, I'm bound to protect Malfoy. I showed him my wings on the train as well as the vision. He's apparently acting as if it's all some kind of hoax. I think after this, he'll know that it's not. Whether he acts less like a git, I don't think so. It wouldn't really be in his nature."
Harry shuddered and momentarily closed his eyes. "Yeah, really didn't want to know. Really glad that bloody snake is dead."
The owl stared at him then tried to snatch the letter out of his hand. He held it out of her reach and scowled at the bird.
"Okay, I believe you. Weirder things have happened. You should go somewhere safer. I won't be leaving the inn until term starts again. Just wish I had a permission slip to go to Hogsmeade. Might've gotten to see you again. I have no doubt you'll make it to Scotland given how eager you were to follow me across from Surrey."
"Dunno. Closest I could get to waking him up after history. You were right, 'Mione. There's something wrong with him," Ron replied.
Harry frowned. "Draco, I know you were part of something horrific but I know you had no choice in it. This house is plenty big enough for you and I to coexist without clashing. I meant what I said. You can stay as long as you need. You-"
The slytherin eyed him warily before giving him a half nod. Moving too fast for him to rescind the consent, Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy's wrist, keeping eye contact as the vision was shown. Sensing a lack of other people, he released his wings and allowed Malfoy to see them. Once the vision was over, Harry released his grip and left his wings out for a few more moments. He could see the myriad of emotions cross the blond's face. Fear, disbelief, panic, irritation, confusion. He said nothing, waiting for the blond to decide how he was going to react. Mostly, how difficult the blond would make his job. After a few minutes, Malfoy shook his head and sneered.
Everyone stared as Harry and Draco entered the great hall. Hermione waved to them. Harry looked down and quickly hurried over to their table while Draco held his head up and walked normally towards the slytherin table. Hermione frowned at Harry before scowling at the staring students. Why they thought it was such a big deal was beyond her.
She and Parkinson both stared at each other with a mixture of resignation and sadness. They knew what was happening, both understood why but had no way of fixing it. Harry was never going to accept Malfoy as his soulmate. Malfoy had no way of making it happen. She tried to think back on everything she'd read about soulmates. There had to be a solution. She needed-
Weasley glanced at Harry. "You wouldn't need my wand to do that, you bloody show off. Why's the ferret here?"
"I've heard talking about it can help. I mean, I've never done it but then, I've hardly been able to talk to anyone who experienced half of what I did. None of them were personally exposed to the Dark Lord until the end."
Harry followed the banker around the desks and into a smaller room with a single table, atop of which sat two sheets of parchment, sealed with wax. He frowned as he neared and read the words on them.
Harry raised an eyebrow and looked up at him. "In sixth year. We broke up after Dumbledore's funeral. Got back together for like six months after the battle of Hogwarts but we realized it just wasn't going to work. She had plans and I had plans. We both realized we were bisexual. She moved on. We're friends."
"Didn't expect to see you up this morning," Harry said quietly. "Usually you're not up until at least midday."
Harry twisted out of his uncomfortable position and looked him in the eye. "I'd never settle for anyone, regardless of their magical ability or not, but also, as I said earlier, magical folk fawn over me. It's infuriating and they'd never be with me for me. They'd be with me for the notoriety, fame or the dream of being with
As if thrown off by the lack of reaction, Malfoy stood and joined him in the corridor. Harry sighed, knowing that the only way to show Malfoy the truth and have him believe it would be to show him.
Harry didn't offer a verbal response. He trusted very few people anymore, and while Draco wasn't one of them, he also posed no threat. Ron rolled his eyes.
"I honestly can't believe Ron and Hermione went from bickering constantly to sucking each other's tongues out in the space of a few months," Harry grumbled.
"Yes. It was his choice to make. We decided that we didn't want to lose our friends. Shoved them into the room of requirement and the room locked us out. Something clearly happened because they went from avoiding each other to, well that. Both of them said something about having already died, but they weren't particularly coherant."
She sauntered off and Harry growled in irritation. Stupid toad woman. He could hear Padfoot gnashing his jaws beneath the bed, clearly expressing his distain with what he could only imagine were expletives.
Draco leant on the kitchen sink, trying to stop his mind from going down the traitorous path it was attempting. He did not want to think about sixth year. He did not want to think about the mark on his arm. He did not want to replay Albus Dumbledore's death any more. He wanted it to have never happened. He wanted to have become quidditch captain and thrashed Gryffindor so hard that even with the bias against his house, they'd have won the cup.
He choked on air, his lungs refusing to cooperate. He felt arms go around him, holding him. Harry quietly urged him to take deep breaths while sounding breathless himself. After a few moments, his lungs regained full function and he sagged against Harry's chest. He was so tired. His body felt heavy and useless.
Downing another three mouthfuls, Draco nodded his head in silent agreement. What was the point indeed? His head got a bit fuzzy rather quickly after that.
"I is a house elf, Master Harry, sir. I work until I die or am freed and Kreacher will not take no clothing from you sir."
He was eventually woken up by his stomach. It snarled angrily and Draco didn't bother attempting to go back to sleep. He knew it would be futile. He was also pleasantly surprised that he no longer felt the urge to run away. Harry had fixed the wards. He wished he had a wand to check the time as the room did not have a clock in. He'd been a little distracted in his sixth year to master wandless magic, so didn't even attempt it. Instead, he slipped out of bed and quietly made his way out into the hallway. Kreacher shuffled past and headed up the stairs to the fourth floor. Draco walked as quietly as he could downstairs. He couldn't hear anyone else, but with Potter's friends, he couldn't be too careful. He might be willing to let bygones be, but they clearly weren't.
"My grandfather invented the fucking thing. I'm the heir of the Potter fortune. These clothes won't make a dent in it and having that much money annoys the shit out of me. Please, just buy whatever you need or, fuck it, whatever you want. I honestly do not care."
"If it's because you have the urge to run away, it's because the wards on the house are fighting you. I can reconfigure them in the morning so they'll leave you alone."
He couldn't help but stare. Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world... wasn't straight. What had happened to the she-weasel? Where were his friends? Why was he single? In fairness, the last question he had was a presumption, but he couldn't bring himself to ask any of them anyway. Harry owed him nothing. If anything, he owed Harry.
It was neither. Mad-Eye and some other unknown people were stood outside his door. They explained nothing but insisted he pack up his trunk. While not particularly interested, he did as he was told and followed them outside. Hedwig took off into the night sky while one of the strangers took his trunk and disapperated.
"Our souls did some freaky whatever earlier. I still feel awful, so I can only imagine you're in a similar way. Pretty sure the contact is supposed to make sure the connection is secure or something."
Draco looked mildly defeated and gestured for him to lead the way. Harry wanted to ask a whole bunch of questions but refrained from doing so. The pureblood looked exhausted as it was.
"Mr Potter, I see you are awake," she said haughtily. "I came to inform you that your outburst in the last lesson you attended will result in detention in my office tomorrow evening. As will skipping today. Mr Malfoy, I do hope you feel better soon."
Draco smirked. "Pansy and Blaise were always... touchy people, but now it's just atrocious. I put a charm on the dorm door to stop girls coming in after I caught them going at it. There's literally nowhere safe from them."
"How are you, Malfoy?" he asked. "Generally speaking. You know, when you're not having public breakdowns."
Draco had sat on the floor where they'd landed and- after giving the shopping bags to Kreacher to put away- he sat beside him, offering quiet reassurance that he was safe. Harry didn't fully understand what the hoarde reminded Draco of to cause a panic reaction, but he also wasn't going to judge him for it. Trauma made people react differently.
"You can walk together but we are in fact going to the hospital wing," he said firmly, his teacher voice emerging.
Ron swore under his breath. Over at the slytherin table, Malfoy seemed to stir slightly and Zabini hauled him to his feet, trying to evacuate him as discreetly as possible. When Parkinson got up a couple of minutes after, Hermione followed her out of the hall.
Harry knew he should have pulled his hand away but while the soulmate connection was buzzing, he knew they also wouldn't get into a massive argument over the topic.
"Still passed out, Pads," Lupin said gently. "Alive, but not waking up. Pomfrey says there's nothing inherantly wrong with either of them right now. Soulmates connection is clearly doing something to them though."
Harry smirked. "Such a pureblood. It's a mechanical implement used inside clocks, watches and robots. It's a muggle phrase, I guess, that when you're thinking hard about something, the cogs start whirring."
He rolled his eyes, burying his face into his pillow. Why did she think it had anything to do with the summer or the Order? She was supposed to be the smart one of the group. She shoved him over and scowled at him.
Something intrinsic set off inside him. He leaned over and the instant he touched Malfoy, the air was sucked from his lungs and he fell forwards into total whiteness.
The next day, he headed to Gringotts to withdraw some money for new robes. With the new developments, he'd grown four inches. Even the oversized, baggy clothes he'd gotten from Dudley were only just big enough on him. Even though, Diagon Alley was relatively quiet in the early morning, those that were there, stared at him. More so than was usual. He wished he had a way of hiding the wings but, since they had no tangible form, they went through his clothing.
"Well that's easy. We just tell him that we're going to get Sirius a trial. We'll use your memories as evidence to the fact that Pettigrew is alive, in which case, they'll be sufficient evidence to allow for a retrial where he can plead his case under veritaserum. Two birds, one stone."
He jerked awake, sweat covering every inch of his skin. Hands pressed against his shoulders but he couldn't move away. Couldn't separate dream from reality.
Regulus's room had been deemed the guest bedroom after he'd moved into Grimmauld Place and he slept in Sirius's. Both the rooms were pretty bog standard. Just four poster bed with black canopy, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. There was a desk too and all furnishings were made of some dark wood. Draco looked around the room with a carefully controlled expression. It was one he'd seen far too many times with purebloods in questioning. Likely due to his upbringing but he couldn't help but be annoyed by it. It reminded him of the Dursley's.
Happy valentine's day, folks. May your love be strong and your singleness chill. Personally, I opted to be my own Valentine. The chocolate was great.
"I don't imagine that there's much I can tell you that Hermione hasn't already said. It's a complicated situation."
He pulled the hood of Harry's robes up and desperately hoped that nobody would pay him enough attention to recognize who he was. He just wanted to get back to Grimmauld Place and either sleep or possibly get utterly wasted. Either way, he wanted out of the day. He wanted a different reality whether he found one in a dream or at the bottom of the bottle made no difference to him. He was halfway down the alley when he sensed that he was being followed. Trying to control his anxiety while continuing to move forward felt like a marathon in itself, never mind getting to the Leaky Cauldron in one piece. His body wanted to freeze, his mind wanted to disarm whoever was stalking him but his brain, still somewhat rational, knew that neither of those options was viable. A moving target was far harder to hit and he had no wand, nor a decent control of wandless magic, to disarm his stalker with.
She-weasel looked mildly offended but didn't comment. Despite the urge to leave them to it, Draco could not deny his hunger any longer. He slowly entered the room and sat beside Harry. When he hesitated about taking any of the food, she-weasel rolled her eyes before she shoved a tray of fried rice and lemon chicken in his direction.
Harry shrugged and exited the room, closing the door as quietly as he could. It didn't bother him if Draco wanted to sleep the day away.
Draco wasn't about to disagree. He loved getting attention, but the rumours were proving to be too much. He'd started feeling guilty about doing exactly that about Harry for the last four years. When they got to Hogsmeade, they took a trip into Zonko's, Honeydukes and a couple other places before stopping by the Hog's Head.
her constant adoration, but he wanted it. He wanted it almost as much as he wanted to live. He felt rather than saw Harry arrive.
"Harry, come on!" Ron complained. "We're gonna be late for defence. When did you become such a heavy bloody sleeper?"
Malfoy lowered his gaze and Harry felt a sigh of relief crawl its way up his body. He looked at Hagrid who was both appalled and concerned.
"Unfortunately, none of your blood relatives came to claim them, Mr Potter," Griphook replied. "You were not of age and, from what I'm aware, none of your father's family were alive. Your mother's family could have opted to send an envoy in their stead, given their lack of magical blood, but none came."
Within a minute, the woman had stopped yelling and Harry walked through the house. Draco followed, feeling a little uncertain.
Harry shrugged. "Probably keeping it until he can use it to his advantage. Maybe nobody believes him. Our entire class is definitely going to know something's up though. It's going to be weird that I'm walking around perfectly fine after how deep I got clawed. I probably should have been in the hospital wing at least for a day or so."
Footsteps marched towards them and Hermione stepped away from Ron. McGonagall, Snape and Dumbledore all appeared somewhere between cross and concerned. She glanced over at the slytherins. McGonagall cleared her throat.
"Probably. My acceptance letter was addressed to the cupboard under the stairs. They didn't really have any other option. My godfather was imprisoned and my father was an only child. Both sets of grandparents are dead. That left my aunt."
Draco frowned. He hadn't ever really considered the implications of lycanthropy. To be fair, he hadn't really thought much about werewolves beyond what his father had said. Which was that they were deadly, vicious beasts. Lupin had never appeared dangerous. If anything, he seemed to try and come across as anything but predatory. He sighed. Unlearning his father's lessons were going to take a while.
"I've got an aunt but she's an abusive bitch. She definitely wouldn't care that Sirius died. She'd probably celebrate that another freak was gone."
He shrugged. "Never does where I'm involved. Just seems to get harder and harder. People want more and more. I'm surprised I still have any of myself left. Oh and, we've been invited to Hogsmeade by Lupin and my godfather."
"But Potter's a gryffindor. He'd never reject Draco, and Draco is too slytherin to die, regardless of who he matched with."
Warmth flooded his system and he sighed with relief as the pain subsided. Buckbeak nudged him on the shoulder and he casually reached up to stroke the creature, his eyes still on Malfoy's.
"That would suggest I'm allowed to let fear take control, sir. I have another I'm supposed to protect. Being consumed by fear won't allow me to do that," Harry replied carefully before absorbing his wings. "I also think you know who I am and not because I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."
He shook his head and allowed the goblin to break the seals. He read out the wills and balked at the idea of being Lord Potter, Peverall and Gryffindor. He also couldn't even picture the amount of gold in his vault and asked for a fifth to be transferred anonymously to the Weasley and Granger vaults. He also learned that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin were his godfathers, though the later only by honourary title. He was accompanied to his vault (the main Potter vault, not his inheritance fund) and Griphook retrieved the Lordship rings. He put them on and stared as they shrunk to fit his fingers, given the assurance that they would resize with any further growth.
He raised an eyebrow. "He saw You-Know-Who get brought back at the end of the tournament and watched Diggory get killed in front of him. Wouldn't you be a bit off?"
His days were rather boring as he waited for his Hogwarts letter to arrive. Without it, he wasn't entirely sure what books he'd need for the coming year. He also really hoped that Voldemort didn't have any plans to kill him either. Not when he now had to keep a big mouthed moron alive as well. If the creepy weirdo discovered his inheritance and that Malfoy was his ward, the blond would, without a doubt, become shark bait. With nothing better to do, he stood in front of the mirror and worked on hiding the wings. His magic revolted against it, all but begging to not be forced into it, but eventually, his magic obeyed and the wings flitted out of reality. He smiled at his reflection before realising just how taxing it was to keep them hidden. His magic felt weak and he knew that if he attempted magic, the result would be pitiful. He sighed, releasing his wings again. In private, they were most definitely staying out.
Malfoy sat across from him and crossed his arms. "The other deatheater sons suggested that they were going to tell their fathers what had happened. Snape made them all swear to secrecy. Doesn't mean life's going to be any easier though."
He frowned at the remainder of his fry-up. It was disgustingly greasy yet somehow had made him feel better. Maybe it was some kind of muggle magic. He looked up at Harry to find him looking distant, almost absent. Draco shot a glance around the cafe. The homophobic muggle was scowling in their direction and what was likely a vagrant was curled up in the corner asleep. Other than that, it was just the cafe worker. Draco turned back to Harry, who was still lost somewhere in his own thoughts, and frowned.
Malfoy didn't even complain. He simply walked away quickly, as if remembering that the rest of his classmates had gone. Ron and Hermione surged forwards, the panic tumbling out of their mouths alongside the outrage.
Without waiting for a reply, Harry vanished. Draco gripped the sink. He'd had the worst possible scenario confirmed and he had nothing to hold over Harry's head to force compliance. The professors weren't allowed to intervene with soulmate problems. He was going to die.
"Probably to ask whether your parents know and to work out whether you're actually willing to fight on our side. Or at the very least, hide with our side so that you don't threaten my life."
He didn't manage to get any other words out before his vision went black and he lost control of his limbs. His mind faded away and thoughts evaded him. It was not how he wanted a different reality at all.
"Tell who? She was appointed by the ministry. Dumbledore can't do anything about her or she wouldn't be here in the first place. She's here as punishment for claiming that Voldemort is back. The ministry have set their attack dog on us. Who am I supposed to tell?"
"Around the middle of third year. I saw one of the seventh year Slytherins after quidditch practice. It was an eye opener. Also made the locker room so awkward."
"This can't be right," he said. "Surely the wills of my parents should have been read when they died."
"Because it shouldn't be dropped! Harry, she's literally scarring you because you're saying something the ministry doesn't like."
Ginny went home just after one a.m, citing that Luna would be unimpressed if she got woken up in the middle of the night. It was no surprise to him that Luna had a wonky sleep pattern. Draco had eaten a second round of dinner and played two, evenly matched games, of chess with Ginny, and Harry had been intrigued enough to watch without complaint. While Ginny wasn't as good as Ron, she was most definitely a far better player than he was.
Madam Pince looked at them from her desk and frowned. "I won't be having any funny business going on in my library. I hope you understand me."
"His father's a deatheater, Hermione," Harry said gruffly. "Maybe Voldemort moved into the manor. Maybe Malfoy's a deatheater now too. Who cares? The git deserves whatever's coming his way."
He braced his arms on the sink, swallowed hard before turning to face the she-weasel. He'd expected her to look judgemental or at the least grossed out by his current disposition, but she just looked understanding.
A giant black dog emerged from the shadows, looking somehow both curious and menacing all at once. He lowered his wand.
Harry looked up at him with an eyebrow raised. "I don't, though technically the one prediction made about me in class did happen to be true. Sirius's animagus form looked like the grim. However, that wasn't what I was thinking about. You don't have any robes, Draco. Does the potion's master provide them for you?"
Hermione sighed and leaned on Ron's shoulder. She didn't know quite what she'd expected Lupin to be able to do. He wasn't a professor anymore and wasn't at Hogwarts. He couldn't really help Harry from a distance. Honestly it didn't seem like anything could help Harry. She looked over at the Slytherin table just as Malfoy seemed to faint. Parkinson and Zabini managed to discreetly prop him up but even from a distance it was obvious that he was very unwell. Possibly even dying. Hermione's heart skipped a beat. If Harry was soulmates with Malfoy, it would definitely explain why he was rejecting him. She nudged Ron.
The first stunner hit him and he staggered to keep himself upright. It stung a little but he'd had worse. He kept moving. Stopping would ensure problems that he was unequipped to handle. When the second hit him, directly in the calf, he couldn't avoid falling. He rolled to his side and looked upon his attacker for the first time. Unsurprisingly, it was a middle aged man with brown hair, eyes and indistinguishable features. Even if he tried reporting him, there was nothing notifiable enough to get a useful description.
"Whatever you are, you're not welcome here," he stated. "None of us are a threat to you and you do not scare me. Leave now before I force you to."
While Harry was in detention, Draco tried to work out some semblance of a plan to get Umbridge ousted. There had to be a way. Dumbledore had no power over her and as far as he knew, the only one above her in the ministry was the minister himself. He paced the corridor outside the slytherin common room. His father was "friends" with the minister and he'd met the man back at the Quidditch World Cup. He stopped moving and leant against the wall. The minister was the only one with the power to remove Umbridge but, presuming the minister was the one behind her "righting the wrong" that Harry had done, he wouldn't be interested in listening. He sighed. It was the only way. He headed into the common room and into his dorm. The letter was a long shot, but it was the best chance he had.
She nodded. "Only students in the school. Too much of a coincidence for it not to be connected, don't you think?"
"Minerva, alert Remus. Have him come, just in case. Harry's godfather will have to wait until we have confirmation either way. Severus, I would suggest waiting for a verdict before alerting Mr Malfoy's guardians. They will no doubt make a fuss otherwise." Dumbledore turned towards them again. "The four of you, wait here. Whatever the outcome, you must seek out a member of staff as soon as you know it. Understood?"
"Hang on, if Malfoy knew on the train what you were, how come the news hasn't spread around the entire school?" he asked.
Draco looked shocked at his mild outburst but no longer made any suggestions to pay him back. In the end, it was a panic attack on the pureblood's end that forced them to leave. They'd gotten trapped in a shop by a large hoarde of teenage girls- none of which had paid them any attention but blocked several of the aisles causing Draco to panic. Harry had apparated them back to Grimmauld Place from the men's toilets, which had technically been a secrecy violation but he didn't particularly care at that point.
Hermione chewed her lip and paced. The doors had locked and none of them had any idea whether it would work. Her stomach was in knots. After a few laps, Ron pulled her to a stop and held her in his arms. The soulmate connection washed over her, soothing the vast majority of her anxiety.
They looked at each other and Draco forced himself to not wallow in self-pity. He blinked quickly as tears tried to escape. He looked up at the roosting owls, trying to not act like a child. Harry touched his arm and a reassuring wave rushed through the soulmate connection. It destroyed whatever barriers he still had and was pulled into a hug as the tears began to fall. Harry didn't say anything. He didn't need to. Him being there, allowing the soulmate connection to do it's thing was evidence enough. They couldn't hate each other anymore, even if they wanted to.
Draco huffed but didn't try to further his point. Harry dropped his head back and closed his eyes. The evening had been strangely nice. He'd never expected Ginny to be as civil as she was, though he definitely appreciated it. He didn't appreciate having his choices questioned and housing Draco was apparently a dramatic choice. One that no doubt, he'd be fighting tooth and nail about to everyone who found out.
"Generally why I spend my free time in here unless I'm going to bed. I also perfected silencing charms because Dean and Seamus refuse to learn."
"I was using the bathroom and heard you on my way back," Harry explained quietly. "I'm sure I don't want to know but I'll ask anyway. What was it about?"
The headmaster clasped his hands, an odd frown between his eyebrows. Snape eyed her and Ron with distaste but didn't comment. McGonagall looked concerned, but waited for Dumbledore to decide what would happen. After several tense minutes, the headmaster turned towards the professors.
Padfoot whined and Lupin rolled his eyes before casting a Notice-Me-Not around the bed. Sirius stood up and leaned against his soulmate, frowning at his godson.
"There's a calming drought I was given after my first year. Helped keep my mind from wandering too far down the rabbit hole. I can find out what it was called, if you want. It's specifically created not to be addictive or mind numbing."
Draco folded the letter and crossed his arms. Harry had said he'd been abused in the half-alive place. Why would Dumbledore allow the golden boy to live with abusive muggles? Why did he have to live amongst muggles at all? Harry looked over at him.
Both Ron and Hermione frowned at him but didn't push him for details. That would happen once he got back.
He expected the portrait to send him away, to insist he needed the password, but she gave him an odd look before opening up. He thanked her and stalked up to his dorm, lying on his bed and dragging the curtains closed. Stupid soulmates. What kind of rubbish was that anyway?
Sirius hissed something about pureblood society that Remus rolled his eyes at before making eye contact with him.
They somehow managed to drag Harry into the great hall for lunch but he really wasn't very conscious. He looked pale and kind of clammy. The food on his plate was mostly just pushed around in circles. Hermione exchanged a glance with Ron and frowned. She took a forkful of the chicken and bacon pie, catching a glimpse of her soulmate mark.
His godfather made a very indignant noise. He heard the clicking of claws on the floor before a snout was pressed against his arm. Harry turned his head and raised an eyebrow.
Harry knew it was rude to call someone by their name when they were an adult but he also didn't care. He slipped past his "honorary" godfather and back to his compartment. The train began moving again and Harry skirted the subject of where he'd been. He really didn't want to explain that he was Malfoy's guardian.
He was about to comment when Hermione and Ron rushed into the library. Harry jerked his hand away, hiding the evidence. Draco narrowed his eyes but didn't comment. Hermione frowned.
"Understatement of the century," Harry cut in. "There are so many reasons why death is preferable to an infinite reality with you."
Harry couldn't help but smirk at the batty woman teaching Divination, especially when she "saw" the Grim in his tea leaves. It looked remarkably like the dog that'd followed him. When they headed down to Care of Magical Creatures, Harry was pleased that Hagrid was doing something he clearly enjoyed. They followed him away from his hut and Harry's grin appeared. The creature, apparently a Hippogriff, stood proudly before them. He was a beautiful creature. Harry didn't pay attention to what Hagrid was saying before he was abruptly shoved forwards. He glanced behind him to see everyone else having backed up. He looked at the half-giant to figure out what was happening.
"He wants nothing to do with me and will therefore rather die. I cannot use you, alright? Move over so that I can call one of the school birds."
Hermione freed her cat from it's crate and the ginger feline pounced across the compartment to sit on his lap. He smiled at Crookshanks and petted it between the ears. He wasn't exactly fond of furry animals but he had no issue with them either. They were simple creatures that required basic requirements. Unlike a certain someone he had yet to inform. He sighed.
Silence fell and none of them knew what else to do. She felt exhausted from doing nothing. If Sirius was aware of any part of the situation, he'd be going stir crazy back at headquarters. She couldn't imagine how stressed he would be not being able to protect his godson. The doors clicked and, despite her tiredness, Hermione jumped to her feet and pulled Ron with her. The five of them slowly entered the room. Frost covered the floor and the walls. Their breath made clouds. Harry and Draco were wrapped around each other. For a moment, she thought they were dead. But then she caught sight of the tiny clouds coming off them. She rushed to Harry's side.
He didn't rise to the bait. Felt no need to. In fact, he felt the calmest he'd ever been in the presence of slytherins. He gestured for the blond to join him.
Remus and Sirius had to leave as night fell, but assured him that they'd be back in the morning for a very important discussion. Harry was not looking forward to it. Not even a little bit. Pomfrey insisted that he and Draco stay overnight, just to be on the safe side. Neither of them tried to argue. Too little was known about soulmate rejection. In theory, they should both have died. They sort of did. Draco sat at one end of the bed, cross-legged and quiet. It was strange, but Harry didn't miss the snarky comments. The truce between them was flimsy at best and he really didn't expect Draco to follow through with what he'd said. He would have to side against his parents in the war that was coming and they weren't going to be persuaded to switch teams. Lucius was too attached to Voldemort for that to happen.
He groaned. He didn't want to wake up. Sleep was all he wanted. Ron shook his shoulders again before dragging him to his feet. He leaned heavily on his friend as they walked (stumbled) through the hallways. He was a lead balloon and each step felt like absolute exhaustion.
He shook his head, blinking rapidly. Harry Potter wasn't at the table. He was the enemy then. The saviour's words washed over him and the nightmare slipped away. His eyes focused on Harry's concerned but entirely non-judgemental face. The hands on his shoulders vanished and he couldn't help but feel a certain loss of security.
Draco crept down the stairs once he was sure Weasley had gone. He definitely did not like being alone in the house. It was like some survival instinct had been set off and was telling him to leave immediately. When he entered the living room and saw Harry in a very concerning position, he frowned. He walked around the sofa until he could see Harry's head.
He looked up. Harry Potter was stood beside him, some sort of martini in hand. He looked hot. He was wearing skinny jeans and a tight fitting top.
"I'm thinking, I have plenty of spare rooms and he needed a place to stay, Ronald," Harry replied, "I'm thinking you need to get over your petty feud with him because we are not children anymore and for Godric's sake, he's no threat to anybody. He was vindicated of all charges but they still broke his wand. Let's be real, nobody is going to sell him a new one. Now, would you like to reconsider shouting at me in my own house? I get enough of that from the bloody portrait."
"Fuck it, Harry, if the ministry are the ones who sent her then you should go straight to the bloody minister!"
The pureblood frowned before dropping his head back to his knees. "Thank you, Harry. For so many things."
He shrugged. "I'm fine, Hermione. The bleeding's stopped but I'm pretty sure there's scarring. Don't suppose you know how to mend clothes?"
Harry didn't get out of bed the next day. Both she and Ron had tried to wake him up but he'd barely roused beyond a grunt in their direction. The two of them sat in the great hall, barely touching their breakfasts. If she was right, then Harry was dying and likely wouldn't survive the next couple of days at most. The owls flew in and her letter from Lupin dropped in front of her.
and frowned at the time. How had he slept in until midday? Usually he was up with the daylight no matter what time he'd gone to bed. He shrugged. He'd been told on multiple occasions that he didn't sleep enough anyway.
He chuckled. "Yeah. This stuff's all the original that belonged to Walburga. Only things that are different is that no cursed objects exist anymore."
Harry conjured a fork from somewhere and handed it to him before continuing his conversation with she-weasel.
Draco nodded, stepping further into the room, while Harry silently walked out. Kreacher shuffled about on the floor above, grumbling about blood traitors. He couldn't help but roll his eyes at the elf. Despite being relatively decent towards him, Kreacher still couldn't stand anyone other than blood purist Purebloods- though Harry made sure he kept his mouth to himself when he had guests around. He'd barely reached the stairs when Draco emerged from his room, a glimpse of concern flashing across his face before he controlled it again. He really didn't seem to want to be by himself. He was about to question it when he remembered the house was tempramental about who it allowed inside.
To say he struggled to keep the wings hidden on platform 9 3/4 was an understatement. It took a lot of concentration to sustain it and fighting through the crowds to get onto the Hogwarts express battled for it. Ron was all but steering him through towards the train and he was grateful. He was also grateful to not have to worry about having enough strength to drag his stuff with him. Once in the train carriage, he desperately hoped for an empty compartment. He desperately wanted to free his wings. Of course, being Harry Potter, meant that luck was against him. The closest they got to an empty space was one with an adult man curled up in the corner, face hidden by his cloak.
Hermione pressed against Ron's chest as they sat on the floor outside the room of requirement. She felt emotionally drained, despite the soulmate connection feeding her a constant state of calm. Blaise had conjured a chair for him to sit on and Pansy alternated between sitting on his lap and pacing in a circle. The four of them just wanted an answer. Even if the answer was death. Footsteps approached and Hermione glanced up. Lupin was walking towards them, hands clenching and unclenching by his sides, and eyes fixed on the door.
Draco regretted coming. He didn't entirely know why he thought it would be a good idea to come alone. There were too many people. Too many muggles. He couldn't breathe.
Padfoot made a noise of deep protest as he scrabbled out from under the bed. He leapt up so that his front paws were on the bed. He gave his best impression of a scowl without the use of eyebrows.
"It's not pity. I'm just apologizing for the fact that, in this instance, I got the long straw. I had no choice in whether my parents died. I was too young to ever have to make it. You're having to abandon your family in order to live. It's not right. It's not how it should be. Fate is truly fucked up to make this a path. I'm sorry you have to give up your mother, Draco."
Ron looked flummoxed, his mouth opening and closing like a goldfish as he tried to work out what to say. Harry was not in a good mood. His earlier reasoning for going to the club resurfacing without hesitation. He didn't want to think about it. He didn't want to remember. He glared at his best mate.
It took several minutes for Draco to calm down and Harry was definitely concerned. He knew what panic attacks felt like, he'd had a fair few himself, but for it to happen in public... it was so much worse due to humiliation. Even once his breathing was under control, Draco didn't lift his head or try to move away.
All three of them stared at him. Despite what he'd said, Harry wasn't fully convinced he was still sane. Perhaps dying had messed with his head. Draco shrugged, though he looked down with a somewhat uncomfortable expression. Nobody had the chance to say anything else though as Pomfrey marched into view and escorted the girls out. Harry yawned. How could he be tired after sleeping for hours? Draco looked at him, then at the bed.
Hermione looked stunned. He drew the curtains again and cast a silencing charm. He wanted no part in whatever arguments occured. They meant little to his shortened timeline anyway. He wasn't entirely certain how long he had left. Most people avoided the rejection process so there was very little written about it and even less discussed. All he knew was that it wouldn't be long. Once the soul realized it's mate wasn't going to stay connected they didn't stick around for very long.
"First of all, how did you even get in here without a password?" she demanded. "Second of all, why are you still sulking? We apologized for the letters, or lack thereof, but this is out of hand, Harry. Just how many meals have you skipped?"
He could tell the pureblood was uncomfortable. He also knew that he was lashing out at him to get away from his demon of the day. It wasn't healthy and it wasn't right but he couldn't seem to stop it. Especially knowing that Draco would likely put up with a lot of crap before walking away because he had nowhere else to go. Harry took a deep breath and rubbed his face. He was not supposed to be such  a dick.
She resisted the urge to stamp her foot in frustration. Harry had been off ever since the Order brought him to Grimmauld Place. At first she just thought it was because he was mad about the lack of letters from her or Ron but it was definitely more than that. She ducked back into the common room and sat down beside Ron on the sofa. Her soulmate connection made her feel slightly lighter but she couldn't ignore that there was something wrong with Harry. Maybe she could send a letter to Professor Lupin. Maybe he'd have a better idea. Ron nudged her.
When he recieved no response, Draco came to the conclusion that Harry was most definitely in denial. Or perhaps that his muggle relatives didn't allow him to receive owls. He convinced himself that one of those was the reasons because otherwise he'd have to listen to the sinking feeling in his gut. The sinking feeling that traitorously suggested that Harry wanted him dead. He couldn't allow himself to believe that the gryffindor had drifted so far away from his typical character. He kept his soulmate a secret from his parents, insisting that it was some hufflepuff girl he'd never spoken to before. Didn't even know her name. His father was too preoccupied to care but his mother looked at him with a knowing frown. For once in his life, he couldn't wait for the pressured environment of Hogwarts to take him away. Being in the manor allowed him way too much time to think about his soulmate and the possibility that he was being rejected. It hurt too much to contemplate.
Harry rolled his eyes before turning to stroke his owl and not-so-subtley check her over for any injuries. Draco opened his letter.
"You can't tell them, Draco. Whether you like it or not, our main focus is protecting Harry, which means you can't see them again. It's too much of a risk."
"Harry, you were screaming," he said calmly, trying to pretend that the wand couldn't maim or kill him in an instant.
Snape marched towards the slytherin table. With a single glance, all of the fifth years and a couple of the other slytherin students were on their feet and following him out of the great hall. There was a strange silence in the room which then broke by a whole lot of whispering. Harry clenched his fists beside his plate.
Draco shrugged, glancing in Harry's direction. "He wasn't a brilliant captain and therefore doesn't see things that way. Had things gone differently, Slytherin would have thrashed Gryffindor in sixth year."
Draco couldn't hide his flinch. He and Ron Weasley had never gotten along even slightly. It was an entire family feud alongside the childish bickering. Harry sighed, putting his tea down on the counter just as Weasley entered the room.
Harry just offered him his wand back. Ron said his goodbyes before heading back into the floo. Harry fell backwards over the sofa and, despite the discomfort, refused to move. It was this or smashing something.
History of magic was quite possibly the most boring subject at the best of times. But given the migraine and total body ache he had, Professor Binns was all but singing him a lullaby. Hermione kept shooting strange glances in his direction but he ignored them for the most part. All he wanted to do was go back to bed and sleep. That way he had half a chance at dying in his sleep. Also left no room to run into Malfoy. Harry had already decided that he would skip herbology and potions, purely for the fact that they were shared classes with slytherin. He knew Hermione would try and rip into him over it, but he couldn't summon the energy to care. He put his head down on the desk and let his eyes fall shut. Who needed history of magic when you'd be dead in a few days?
"You okay?" Draco asked frantically as he immediately rushed to his fiancé's side, crouching down next to him. One of his hands stroked over the dark locks, carefully feeling for a possible head injury. He felt endlessly relieved as he found nothing aside from a small swelling that would soon become a respectable bump.
But once he stepped onto the terrace where they had had lunch the day before and met the two Slytherins in their tight, square cut bathing suits, his mind went too blank to be self-conscious at all.
His feet constantly tangled with themselves and with those of his dance partners when Harry just reacted too slowly again and he
"Whoever said that the public would have to learn of it?" Amalyne spoke up calmly from her chair at the side, her dark eyes resting idly on the folded hands in her lap.
"Of course I wasn't. I told Draco I wouldn't be there. If I had been, I'm sure the evening would have ended with some corpses, and not mine!" He hated such gatherings where everyone present would sneer at him as if he were some stray that Lucius had graciously decided to take home and shelter. The last time he had nearly hexed Druella Rosier, Narcissa's mother, into oblivion.
"I came here willingly, didn't I?" He murmured quietly, licking his dry lips to win a few seconds. His nails lengthened slightly, scratching at the crystal glass that was still warm from the old wizard's hands, leaving behind a tiny, white scrape.
"Draco!" Adler called out, passing through the painting with the study into the library to follow his descendant's retreating figure. "What will you do?"
"I like my glasses." Harry shrugged uncomfortably. And really, he had enough for now of the freakishness of his inheritance. Even his blurred sight was somewhat of a relief, a bit of normality and familiarity where his world had seemed too instable otherwise.
Reflexively, Severus grabbed the recalcitrant thought that reeked of regret and anger, oozed grief and pain and he maliciously squished it, the way he had so often done during the past sixteen years; silently infuriated when it took more effort than it used to.
He did not look back at his son, or urge him to follow. And Taide didn’t even notice, too engrossed with the sight of the as of yet formless darkness that the British Vykélari had heaved up like something vicious that his body couldn’t cope with.
With the memory of his hopefully small transgression heavy on his mind, Harry didn't object even at the mention of the back-rub he had just refused. He felt positively horrible when, while they were waiting for the House Elves to bring them their meal and then while eating, both Blaise and Draco attempted to draw him into light conversations about all kinds of things, like what he had done during the past two months or what he planned on becoming job-wise. Draco even asked about his cousin Nymphadora, much to Harry's surprise, whom he had never met. Yet he was too distracted for small-talk and didn't feel able at all to come up with astute or witty remarks or even remotely sophisticated answers.
Quite frankly, Blaise felt a bit vengeful after Lucius had hurt his Dragon, after Amalyne had held her derogatory speech about Harry.
He opened his arms, lifted his hands palms up in a gesture that might have been misunderstood as a surrender.
"Of course." Draco nodded. "More than once in fact, I assure you. So don't take it to heart if you don't get it right the first few times or even today at all. We'll simply try again and practice with you until we can hunt for the snitch together."
And his cold gaze turned away from Harry, sweeping over Hermione's and Ron's forms on the ground of the plane towards something hidden from the Gryffindor's view outside of the mirror's frame behind his friends.
"Actually the two of us already had something similar in the hospital." Blaise pointed out with an amused smile, folding his arms in front of his chest. "I allowed your magic into my own body so that it could explore the structure of a Vykélari's sensory system."
Thus, with a huge exertion of time, magic and money, the government had taken everything along and carefully deconstructed and rebuild the entire palazzo within the Monte Faito. And though it was now situated beneath thousands of tons of rock and earth, the entire construction held the fragile and carefully planned illusion of still being on the surface.
Instead, the vulture like man stood behind the strung out bodies of Ron and Hermione with his head held high, a cruel smirk tugging at his thin lips. His eyes that were half hidden behind a curtain of long, dark hair, gleamed as they beheld the sight of Harry's friends with malicious glee, his friends that were pressed flat against the mirror, their hands tied behind them. With barely half a metre between their bodies, they were forced to look at each other, their cheeks pressed closely to the glass of the mirror, distorting their expressions grotesquely. But it didn't take away from the look of desperation, fear and pain that seemed to have been permanently burned into the faces that he knew so well, like the brand mark of a nightmare.
Burning, black eyes met molten mercury over a dark skinned shoulder and Blaise quickly turned around; Draco let him, because even though sex between them sometimes became a violent battle for dominance, there was still an unvoiced line never to be crossed. Choice.
When Taide had released the submissive from the magical block that had contained his powers only for the boy to lay waste to what had been a beautiful courtyard and his mother’s pride; when his grandfather was thrashed to the ground and screamed out his last breath in fear and terror; when the boy crouched over him, shocked and aghast at his own brutality and trembling with the turmoil of his emotions and the effort it took to hold his magic beneath the frail barrier of his skin… that was when Taide had known that he was looking at his own death.
Draco and Blaise stood together with both of their mothers, perfect. He couldn’t wait to break the news and it was actually a pity that they had guests because he wouldn’t be able to witness their more unguarded, open reactions. Whatever he told them would not shake the masks of indifference on their faces; that perfect emotional control. They were Malfoys, after all, and Zabinis of course. Nevertheless that couldn’t be helped as time was of the essence right now. After all, he didn't want the submissive fledgling to take any actual harm.
With a rare, genuinely grave expression, Draco turned to him. "I don't think I could have watched you head for your own ruin either. I never blamed you for doing what you did."
Insistently he tugged at the hands holding his ankles apart and they released him, gripping his hips tightly instead, leaving Draco free to wrap them around his lover's chest.
"I don't think that is of any importance right now." He said, the fingers of his right hand rubbing against another as if they missed the feeling of his hawthorn wand. "Ives should be mindful of what he says to whom. This is his family, also."
Narcissa smiled at them gently. "I think you are doing the right thing. In the long run it will be better for all of you if he entered a mateship of his own accord."
Harry was still unsettled, and he felt disturbingly trapped in the tight hold the other Vykélari had on him. And he was wary … and the way his skin still tingled from the magic that had been all around him didn't make it any better. Now that it was gone, the impact it had had on him left him shaken to the core. It had played and rippled over the Italian's skin like the reflections of water, as if it wanted him to believe that its source, Blaise's inner core, was just as deep and wide and resourceful as an ocean. And he hadn't been able to think. Indeed when Blaise had taken away the distracting swirls of gold and copper and red, it was like awaking from a wonderful dream that he was desperately trying to hold on to. He would have gone with whatever had happened around him, he knew, just like a dreamer never questioning his dreamscape. And that was more than just troubling, it was frightening.
Harry gaped, couldn't do anything but. He had almost never experienced them as anything else than overbearing, obnoxious, smug and conceited, vain and utterly egoistical idiots. This amount of consideration - and even though Draco tried to be nonchalant about it and trivialize his efforts, Harry knew better after Blaise's remark - it was just so …
Unperturbed by his startled expression, the portrait continued. "Oh, hush, Prince! The young one will be quite an addition to our noble house. He'll…"
“Severus. He’ll know.” With that he threw the emergency portkey at Blaise who caught the silver chain in one hand.
Blaise squared his shoulders, letting all the visible emotions drain from his expression, his voice and his posture, and willed himself to calm. Magic and intelligence – these were the powers he believed in; and without Harry willingly fighting on their side, he only had the latter to lean on.
Regardless of the reason, his attention was caught by the hungry look on Malfoy's face as he stared at Zabini, who had his back turned to Harry. It was the same fierce and yet lewd look that had been directed at him, not so long ago, Harry remembered, worrying his lower lip at the queasy feeling in his stomach.
Grimly, Severus shook his head. “Were it any other submissive, any other point in time even, I might agree. But you are dealing with a war hero, Narcissa, only two months after he won a civil war! Whether it is justified or not, the boy has become more than a mere human being.”
Maybe his mind had been weakened and held under the control of another, that might explain… Slowly Severus shook his head. If Potter had been under his kidnapper's control so entirely as to leave him unable to heal himself from a life-threatening injury, there would hardly have been any need at all to hurt him in the first place.
“Healer McAuley, I presume?” he asked, forcing indifference into his voice, lest it might drip with disgust. He inclined his head slightly as he crossed the room and sat down in the leather-upholstered armchair in front of the fireplace.
The two-way-mirror connecting Lanai and Malfoy Manor was also still hovering in the air at the far wall, showing the same parlour of Draco's home where their parents and Severus had last met them and as if they had never left it, all of them sat there enthroned in their respective arm chairs and the only differences indeed were the two missing portraits among the ranks of Malfoy Vykélari as well as the robes that those gathered in the parlour wore.
Hungrily Draco took in the sight of the slightly curly, dark shock of hair falling forward with a groan, finding comfort in the coolness of the wall; he drunk in the quiet moans, relished in the movements of Blaise's hip that the Italian fought so much to suppress but couldn't, helpless to keep still, his hip moving forward into Draco's fist and back again onto the fingers scraping over his prostrate.
"Besides," Harry added nonchalantly, noticing that both Slytherins seemed relieved by his yielding, "I want to know if I can beat Draco without a broom."
Slowly, with a relieved sigh, Harry seated himself again on the comfortable office chair. He knew it was but a little victory, but he couldn't stop himself from grinning. He had lost a battle yesterday with the floo debacle, but that didn't mean he would lose the war.
Whatever they would find down there, one of them would need the other's support and help and… almost more than she was afraid of what they would find, Narcissa was terrified of doing it alone.
Blaise nodded slowly, refusing to clench his jaw and instead balling one hand to a fist behind his back, his lengthening nails leaving sharp, angry indents in his dark skin. Of course Daphne had to have read that defaming article in the Daily Prophet, he'd expected that; but he had hoped for a little bit more sympathy, some sign that she – as a Slytherin and the heiress of one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight Families – had at least regarded the words printed by that paper with the proper amount of scepticism. Or maybe the core of her grievances rather lied in the problems the pureblood society as a whole now faced as a direct result of their alleged mistreating of the Golden Boy, Britain's very own darling hero, in which case he would find himself fighting a losing battle with Daphne.
It didn't take a genius to recognize that this was the wrong time for hesitancy or guilt, the wrong time for compassion. Already his captors were picking themselves up, some searching for their wands; Harry could hear groans and healing charms being cast…
was more powerful than him, the part that had taken guilty pleasure in the challenge of repairing those vanishing cabinets - at least while he had still been naïve enough to not be overly afraid; the part that had made him stupidly join the Battle of Hogwarts. And what a wonderful idea that had been!
She rolled her eyes. "Yes, darling, but it's possible that forced proximity might change his mind. It's our last chance as you really don't appear to be surviving the day otherwise."
The dog stared back at him as if he were deluded. Of course he couldn't answer a complex question. He sighed.
Draco stared at the letter he'd written and sighed. He didn't want to send it. He didn't want to make it all true. Hedwig hooted at him from the perch, waiting patiently for him to hand it over. With a sigh, he sealed it and gave it to the bird. She took off immediately and he felt a crushing weight on his chest. He would do what was necessary to live, but he didn't know if he could cope with the pain that it would bring. His mother was his world. He wasn't a child anymore, he didn't
"It was about Sirius. I was watching him die over and over again. Everytime he disappeared into the veil, he'd reappear again only to die. I was being held back so all I could do was scream," Harry replied.
He staggered out of the floo network and just about managed to grab the desk of a stunned healer before falling over.
"Mr Potter, in the eyes of the olde laws, the laws in which goblins follow, you are entitled to your full inheritance. If you'd like to follow me," the goblin said.
Draco smiled and pressed himself against his soulmate, allowing the warm bubble to soothe him back into unconsciousness.
Once Draco had disappeared into the floo, Harry tried to decide on what to do. He had absolutely zero motivations to do anything. Ginny was busy for the rest of the week, he didn't particularly feel like getting a lecture from Hermione and Ron, well they'd been at arms length for a while. Mostly his doing honestly. Ron kept suggesting he go see a mind healer at St Mungo's to treat his trauma and subsequent depression. He was not in the mood for some witch or wizard to stand in front of him and tell him what he already knew. He'd been through seriously fucked up shit. His parents had been murdered, his guardians had been abusive motherfuckers, his godfather forced into hiding then soon dying, watching a friend die at the hands of a resurrected madman then being informed he was a liar for a year afterward. Not to mention anything of the horcrux hunt, being raised for slaughter and fighting a war he wanted no part in. He'd suffered a bunch. He didn't need a doctor to tell him that.
Draco felt as if he was walking through water. His muscles worked furiously, tensing and flexing as he ran down the long corridors spreading out in front of him like endless tunnels in which only his rugged breathing and the echoing drumming of his feet reverberated back and forth but however much he pushed himself he didn't seem to be moving fast enough, his body caught in a distortion of the time continuum while his mind raced.
For Ron and for Hermione, though, he'd go through much worse. Still, something fluttered in his chest like a sickly, dying bird, aching and cold. What was left, was solely driven by the single-minded determination of saving his friends and attaining justice… or revenge. Harry wasn't quite sure whether he could differentiate between the two anymore.
With clenched teeth and ducked close to the ground Draco crept forward, slowly reaching out with an open palm, sparks of magic on his skin.
Around a sudden corner, along another corridor, the artful wallpaper rushing past him in an endless blur of shadowed beiges and thank god that Blaise's manor was spacious enough to allow for wide, wide hallways where he didn't need to dodge any furniture! He was almost at the stairs.
Harry had no eyes for the beauty around him, though, he was too much aware of the two pairs of eyes that hadn't left his body at all (more like his backside), of that he was sure. He was still hugging himself as he tried to ignore the two Slytherins to the best of his ability - which was a futile endeavour at best - because if he didn't do it, he would have no idea whatsoever about what to do with his arms and hands; and he kept his eyes trained on the narrow but well-kept path of pale stone slabs, because he knew he might stumble and fall otherwise and he really didn't need or want one of his captors to rush to his
The boy was Pandora’s box. And Taide had opened it and released something he had no hope of ruling in or escaping from.
The protection certainly hadn’t been in place the last time Blaise had been there with Draco at his side. His uncle must have installed it specifically for this occasion – no one guarded against House Elf magic, it would hinder the servants in their daily tasks and especially old and noble bloodlines depended on their Elves, couldn’t function without them.
Suppressing a sigh, Draco turned just to find his boyfriend smirking at him with barely concealed amusement. No, his fiancé, he reminded himself with a smile. After three years of calling him the former, that would take some readjusting.
Nothing. The stony eyes regarded him with the same cool, calculative interest that one might show an enemy during negotiations, and the crossed arms didn't seem so much defensive, but rather unapproachable, only creating an emotional distance between them that was even more chilling now that Harry knew that this was his intended mate.
Severus grimaced at the sight. He would have liked to start on closing the wound immediately but without the blood replenishing potion in his system Potter's organs might fail before he had finished; and the healing potion would hopefully do its part to make sure the new blood would stay within Potter.
“Fine,” he muttered, looking up from his now empty plate with what he hoped was an indifferent expression. “Really I…” but then his voice died away and he gasped for air in surprise and shock: a weird, tugging sensation overcame him like a shockwave that made him flinch. His fingers started to tingle and prick before they went painfully cold, the feeling spreading through his stiffening knuckles like frost and ice.
In the ensuing silence Ron almost heard his heart echoing in his throat. He knew that both purebloods would recognize the rune he had used, and also the ritual. If he should break the promise made with the Tiwaz rune, the arrow would break open again and turn its direction, doubling back on itself. The wound would not stop bleeding again until some atonement was made; it wouldn't bleed much, not enough to become dangerous in any case, but it would seep through every piece of clothing of whatever fabric one might wear and thus inform everyone of the bearer's status as an oath-breaker.
To that end he whipped his head left and right with a furiously beating heart, searching for the main culprit, his main target, but Valerio wasn't to be detected anywhere in the wreckage that had once been a doubtlessly beautiful garden. Where he had stood close to the two-way-mirror – the one exception to the circle of destruction Harry had drawn around him – was no one but the old wizard who was fighting with desperation and failing strength against the magical storm that the young, cornered submissive had whipped up. It was a futile endeavour from the start and suddenly what little weight the elderly wizard had to help him breast the furious wind was not enough anymore and he was thrown down with the terrible force of Harry's magic. The old, wrinkled eyes widened in fear as he fell for two endless seconds with a rough shout, before impacting hard with the ground haplessly so that his head hit the cobbled terrace.
Blaise could feel the need to counter it but with a minor mental struggle he resisted. There was nothing to be gained by provoking his lover even further.
With another spell the mirror was enlarged until it measured several metres in length and was at least two metres tall, hanging in the air before them. A mirror. Well, Harry pondered with a half-smirk, that might explain why the vain Slytherin seemed so familiar with that particular charm.
"I am not." Draco's voice was cold and his eyes murderous, and Pansy couldn't help but wish she would stand directly in front of him. He was always so difficult to read, but with him appearing so small in the two-way-mirror, it was well-nigh impossible and she would rather like to know if another comment of hers might have dire consequences.
"What he means to say is: well done." Blaise translated with a smile as he, too sat down next to his fiancé and the young Gryffindor. "But you really shouldn't depend so much on your magic, Harry. You should train those muscles."
?" He asked, his voice humming with a gradually blossoming, incredulous excitement. Where had they gotten these creatures from on such short notice?
"We would have hung up the portrait in your living area as you'd be certainly more comfortable there but Draco thought you might not appreciate the loss of privacy." Blaise said not without a sparkle of amusement tingeing the timbre of his voice.
Draco frowned at that for a moment before he managed to convince his lips into a smile. He would hopefully not wear them for long anyway. "You know, Harry, you really should have stayed to talk about this further. You, sweet, have no idea about the mess your inheritance has gotten you into."
And with that a ripple went through the silvery surface, the colours it showed mixed and swirled together. They rearranged themselves and then, moments later a new room took form, or rather one side of another room in Malfoy Manor. It was a kind of two-way mirror that formed a visual and acoustic connection between Malfoy and Lanai Manor. The set-up had been expensive, but it was a much more comfortable and
It rushed into Blaise's body before he had the chance to close himself off, streaming into his hands, along the muscles of his arms and into his chest, flooding his lungs until he felt he couldn't breathe, piercing his heart until it ached, making his stomach lurch and his legs cramp and he was jerked off Harry's body as if he had been caught by a tornado that had carried him for a few twirls only to spit him out again, throwing him away.
"The hero who tragically fell in love with his enemy, without any hope of ever having his love returned, holding on to the only means of getting the attention of what his heart desired: by antagonizing him. But he comes to his love's rescue when he is needed and only a couple of weeks later the favour is returned when the boy comes into an inheritance that allows him to be with his love." Her lips curled into a tiny smile. "As if you were fated to be together."
“I’ve always thought that would be a good career for you, mate.” Ron commented as he passed Harry a bacon sandwich.
“Look mate, please don’t let anyone else know because I don’t want to take anything away from Bill and Fleur’s big day but me and Hermione have some news and we wanted you to be the first to know.” Ron was smiling so wide Harry was worried that his face would break. “We’re having a baby! Well, Hermione is having a baby. We found out the day before the wedding, she’s about seven weeks gone.”
“Would you like a coffee, Mr Potter? Their dark roast is simply delectable.” Malfoy motioned toward a seat, offering it to Harry, but before he could properly register what was happening the floor was racing towards his face and the whole world turned to black. Grey eyes and the feeling of floating tugged at the edges of Harry’s consciousness, but he couldn’t drag himself back from the warm darkness.
“I’m so sorry.” Audrey said after a while. She got up and left the room too. Harry looked around at the others before getting up to go and check on Ginny.
“Sounds like a good base idea, Mr Potter. I’ll have a look at it in more depth and make some notes on what might need to change, or how certain things might be achieved. I’ll write it all up and we can have another meeting. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of days. That should be-“ He checked his diary “- the seventeenth of July. I have one thirty free, if that’s good for you?” Harry nodded. “Would you like to meet here again?” Harry nodded again. “Then that should be all, unless you would like another drink?” Harry was slightly taken aback by the offer.
He usually conducts his initial meetings at a coffee shop called ‘Fernandez & Wells’. The location is Fernandez & Wells, 1-3 Denmark St, West End, London, WC2H 8LP. I can arrange a meeting between the two of you to discuss your proposal if you wish. I believe he is free at two thirty tomorrow. If you are happy with this arrangement, please reply in the affirmative and I’ll get it all set up for you.
Dean and Seamus had put up temporary huts in the garden. Each one contained a bed, a sofa, a coffee table, coffee and tea making facilities, a mini fridge and a separate room with a toilet, sink and shower. As more and more guests arrived, they were assigned a hut each. When they’d settled themselves into the huts, they all threw themselves into helping or socialising. A lot of them were friends from Hogwarts and it was amazing to be able to catch up with them and see how they’d been doing and what they’d been getting up to since their school days. Harry admitted that he’d been a bit rubbish at keeping in contact with people and vowed to make he saw them more often after the wedding. The huge gardens at The Burrow had almost turned into a temporary village and it was busier than Harry had ever seen it. Molly looked frantically busy, but she also looked delighted. The place was running like a well-oiled machine; albeit a very noisy one, under Molly’s direction. Arthur, Ginny, Charlie and Harry took it upon themselves to keep everyone supplied with refreshments as the day went on.
“Luna has been looking for somewhere to stay in London. She’s opening a new office up in Diagon Alley and Tomas will be taking over the branch in Hogsmeade. If you’re looking for a housemate then I’m sure she’d be happy to muck in with the renovations. I’m sure she’d be glad of not having to floo or apparate, she says both make her feel sick. I doubt she’d want to stay forever though. She’s nearly got enough saved to buy a nice little flat somewhere.” Ginny had begun rambling a little, trying to justify their suggestion. They only ever seemed to get flustered when talking about Luna.
“I can’t wait to see your dress, I bet you’re going to look stunning.” Charlie grinned at her. Harry agreed. He wondered what kind of style she’d gone with. For her job at the ministry she usually just wore smart trousers and a blouse and comfy shoes that allowed her to be on her feet as much as she needed to, and around the house she either wore cropped capris and a tank top and cardigan or maxi dresses. She usually either had her hair braided to keep it away from her face or left it natural and wore a thick fabric headband. Comfort and practicality were Hermione’s style, but she always looked effortlessly wonderful.  She smiled back at them and tapped the side of her nose. Ron looked at her adoringly.
“Well, I’ve had a fantastic little helper.” He grinned, ruffling Lucy’s hair. She giggled, swatting his hand away.
Back at The Burrow a great Eagle Owl flew in through the open window and dropped a letter on the kitchen table. It was addressed to ‘Mr Potter’ in elegant handwriting.
“I look forward to seeing you then.” Harry said after he’d recovered. “Do you want some help with those documents. You look like you’ve got your hands full.”
He padded across the landing into the bathroom that he shared with Ginny. His bedroom was at the top of the house and the only other bedroom up there was Ginny’s. His room had been added on when he’d accepted Molly’s invitation to live there and the only place there had been enough room to put it was right at the top of the house. The bathroom consisted of a tub, shower, sink and toilet and was decorated in aggressive salmon and teal colours. The shower sputtered for a while as Harry turned it on, then came out in a steady stream. Harry turned the temperature right down and waited while the water adjusted. He liked having cool showers; it was much better for his hair and skin than hot ones. He looked at himself in the mirror while he waited for the shower. His hair was still unruly, but in a more stylised way. He still wore circular glasses, but he had them set into a pearlescent tortoiseshell frame. He’d let some facial hair grow since Hogwarts too. It was more thick stubble than a beard. He rubbed his hands over his face. He loved the way the green eyes that he’d inherited from his mother stood out so starkly against the dark skin he’d inherited from his father. He loved to see reminders of them both displayed so clearly in himself.
Surprised, Harry turned, but before any further inquiry could have made it past his lips, Draco had already clapped his hands and stepped forward. "Well then,
“We will bring Potter back to the hospital once he is more stable,” he said, slowly and firmly, ”we will tell everyone that Blaise, Draco and Lucius only followed the standard procedure where the unexpected coming-of-age of a submissive is concerned. After all, we just saw what can happen when they are left susceptible for blackmail. They never meant to mate him, they only intended to keep him save and teach him during the holidays until Hogwarts would be reopened. Out of gratitude for ridding the world of the Dark Lord and for helping during the trials. You only hushed it up to keep Potter save.”
Coming to stand before the socle, the dark witch grasped onto the gargoyle's massive paw to pull herself up on her tiptoes and steady her stance. Quickly she reached for the beast's enormous jaws and pricked the tip of one long finger on a sharp fang, sharper than stone had any right to be.
Harry knew he must look like a complete idiot, staring open-mouthed at the two Slytherins like that, but damn it, they were so freaking handsome and
"Of course." Draco said amicably, as if that was a perfectly well reason and the little smile in his voice made Blaise look up at him. His blond lover countered his gaze calmly, waiting for him to elaborate.
"There is no need to uselessly repeat yourself," Valerio interrupted him coldly, "I heard you the first time. You will learn…
He turned away from the gruesome display with only a hint of hesitancy and regret, trying instead to catch the sight of his wayward lover anywhere in the courtyard beneath him. Oh, how he was going to have a talk with Draco about his sudden penchant for rushing into suicidal situations like some moronic Gryffindor!
"Don't worry, it's not important to understand that." Blaise continued, throwing a stern glance towards Draco who was pressing his lips together firmly to keep silent and had crossed his arms over his chest. He obviously didn't feel comfortable with the 'grit-your-teeth-and-get-to-it'-approach, Harry thought, not really surprised.
"I will make the same vow." Zabini said and then repeated Malfoy's words before carving the Tiwaz into his own flesh.
"You kidnapped me!" He all but shouted and took an aggressive step forward before stopping himself. God, how he wanted to smash that bastard's face in, but he didn't have a wand and they did and he suffered from magical exhaustion whereas they looked as well rested as one could possibly get. Therefore, he restrained himself, balling his hands into fists and concentrated on the distractingly painful feeling of his nails cutting into his palms.
"Well, I am not!" he spat, turning towards the round glass table in the middle of the room, that had an oversized black amphora as a base.
It was a grave mistake and Draco realised it as soon as he heard the aggressive snort to his right. He froze, seeing from the corner of his eye the steely gleam of the stag’s antlers, poised to spear him. A thousand half-formed thoughts rushed through his mind, vague images and notions and the one certain knowledge that he could neither outrun nor dodge the impersonation of Harry’s rage.
Of course neither Lucius nor Amalyne could have suspected that the decision to include him might come back to haunt them later on. But thanks to their trust, Severus found it neither strenuous nor terribly time consuming to add a few surprises of his own to the tower's strong defences – small tricks and traps that would not harm, but hopefully detain Amalyne and Narcissa for a while once they arrived; and they would, of that there was no doubt.
If Harry's mood was suspiciously improved in comparison to the day before or if he seemed a little bit excited and nervous at the same time, when Blaise and Draco met him this morning, they didn't notice it, too busy to assess his lithe frame and his somewhat short stature. How much of that came from the mistreatment he had endured and how much was natural? Were his eyes so bad because he had been forced to spend much of his time in a small, ill-lit cupboard from such a tender age on?
Draco was barely awake with almost as little bodily control. It was like he was on the brink of sleep permanently. Blaise had sat them down in the courtyard, waiting for Pansy, wherever she'd gone. He was less sitting, more leaning, but at least he wasn't in the dungeons. He liked being in slytherin, but he really didn't want to die underground. Someone rushed towards them but he couldn't muster any survival response.
He felt sick. He darted into the nearest toilet and threw up bile, having not eaten anything since early in the morning. He walked over to the sinks and paused when he saw the reflection behind him. Harry was stood, arms crossed and glaring.
Parkinson rolled her eyes. "Force them together how? Draco can barely walk and I'm guessing that Potter hasn't even left his dorm room. We'd need to lock them in together where they'd have no choice but to- the room of requirement! It'll cater to the needs of those inside. It would force them together."
Harry felt as if he'd been hit by a ton of bricks. He released his hold on Draco, rolling onto his back and nearly falling off the bed. Draco grabbed him and shuffled over, allowing him the space to lay flat. He didn't entirely know how he knew he wasn't truly dead. He had an inkling it was because his parents were absent but there was no real way to tell. He only remembered the conversation with Draco. The visuals of the not-really-dead place were fuzzy in his head and would likely fade with time. Draco shifted then made a strange sound.
In the kitchen, Draco leant against the counter, sipping his tea and looking somehow less alive than when he'd found him. Given that he'd been about to have a breakdown, it didn't seem good.
"Same as it was the last few times. I don't want to go. They ask me questions I have no answers to. Your mother, Hermione and Andy are all the same and they never let it go. I'm not in the mood. So, no, I will not be attending."
"I think there should be some sort of law," Harry mumbled, passing the bottle back. "Stating that anyone given a full pardon gets to live a free life until they do something illegal and get caught doing it. Otherwise, what's the point in a pardon?"
When he woke up the next morning, Draco slid off the bed and into the still transfigured armchair. He pulled his knees to his chest and stared at the wall. He couldn't quite grasp the reality he faced. Being soulmates with Potter ensured that life would be anything but ordinary. He would have to somehow say goodbye to his mother without his father knowing. She would protect him, but since she was also bound to his father, she'd never leave him. Couldn't leave him. His father... Harry was right in that Lucius would choose to serve Voldemort over protecting his heir. They could always produce another child. Where was he supposed to go over the holidays? He knew he'd never be able to go to the muggle relatives Potter lived with. Didn't particularly want to either. A sharp tapping on the window brought him out of his musings. Harry's owl was sat on the window ledge, letter firmly tied to her foot. The noise woke Harry who frowned at his bird.
"If I could, I would," Harry replied. "Like it or not, I'll be around more than I would like to be. Goodbye Malfoy."
The wand dropped onto the bed and Harry reached for his glasses. Draco took a step back from the bed and crossed his arms tightly. Stopping the screaming was the part he understood. The rest was kind of a mystery. Was he supposed to leave Harry to it or stay with him? Blaise had never bothered to even wake him up. He'd just placed a silencing charm on the flat whereas Pansy had slapped him awake and warned him not to wake her again.
Draco shook his head at the mild intoxication before reaching over and taking the bottle. He choked down a burning mouthful followed by three more. He didn't like the taste at all, but he also couldn't agree more to the sentiment of drowning his problems. Harry smirked before sitting down on the bed, leaning on the bedpost. Draco passed the bottle back and Harry slung it back. Somehow it felt like they were teenagers, sneaking alcohol in the dorms, which was curious given that they'd never shared one.
A couple days passed and Draco never left the house. It was as though he couldn't bear the thought of it. Harry wasn't particularly bothered as neither of them appeared to hold any animosity toward the other anymore, but it was strange. Surely he'd done something with his life following the trial. Ginny showed up a couple times, usually for dinner, and she most definitely had no bitter feelings towards the former Slytherin. She informed him that his comment about the beaters earnt him the right to show up at the next match. She never specified if it was to prove him wrong or thank him for it. Not that Draco asked. If anything, the pureblood looked almost as green as his former house at the thought of going.
Harry's head turned and he immediately hid his wings. It wasn't a very gryffindor move but he wasn't ready to have
Pansy suddenly glowered at him and within a second, had her wand in hand and shot a mild stinging jinx at him. He jerked back, reaching for his own wand which he didn't have and glared at her. Hermione was too, though she didn't look all that surprised. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Of course I knew you had one," Pansy said with an eye roll. "There was no way you got away with so much using disillusionment charms. It was the obvious alternative."
"I can see what he means, Gin," Harry said quietly, shifting the topic away from the past. "Now that he's pointed it out... it's kinda hard to miss."
The thing attempted to rush him but his wings flapped instinctively, forcing it backwards. A glow began to emit from him- he couldn't have pinpointed where from if he tried- but the thing backed off quickly, fleeing out of the train in a hurry. The glow faded and he turned to walk back to his compartment. The pulse in his gut faded but he didn't allow his wings to go anywhere. He had no idea what the other creature was but he wasn't about to let it get an advantage over him if it came back. All the windows had frosted over and the air was still chilly. He didn't like those creatures, whatever they were. He was almost back to his friends when R.J. Lupin stopped in front of him, a conjured flame in hand.
"Hardly, though I am now considered an adult in the eyes of the olde laws. Or so the goblins say. Hasn't really changed much honestly."
Hedwig delivered a letter that he immediately recognized as Remus's. He left the great hall, abandoning his breakfast, and wandered out to the courtyard. Hedwig flew down and perched beside him on the bench. He stroked her absently as he opened it.
"Well... they broke my wand. Forced us to sell the manor, give over everything associated with the Malfoy name and left us dry. Mother moved to her French villa, unassociated with any house but Black, and I've been drifting between Blaise and Pansy's house. They're sick of me being around now though. Kind of why I went to the club. Just so I could lose myself for a while. Forgot I can't even do that anymore."
He grinned. If Sirius was freed, he'd never have to go back to the Dursley's. Sirius would get to live his life again. He jumped to his feet, spooking Hedwig, and hugged Draco as hard as he could. Draco laughed, hugging him back.
He stood up and the toad professor looked both furious yet somehow shocked. He walked out of the classroom without a second glance, heading for the common room. He'd have a nap that Ron or Hermione would wake him up from. Maybe. If they didn't then who really cared anyway?
Harry scowled. "Unless there's something you'd like to tell me, I wasn't aware that a deatheater would be attending."
He stared at Draco who seemed fascinated by his bird. When he looked as if he'd become a statue, Harry poked him in the arm. Draco looked at him and shrugged.
He didn't talk more. In fact, he decidedly avoided everyone except for mealtimes. By the time school came around again, he was half-convinced his voice no longer worked, he'd spoken so little. Ginny had appeared rather rejected, but Harry wasn't entirely sure why. Ron and Hermione were clearly soulmates, even if neither of them confirmed it out right. Harry was actually rather glad when they were all taken to King's Cross. Being around so many happy soulmates just frustrated him and made his decision that much easier. He could never have what they all clearly had. No, he would avoid his soulmate until it killed them both. After all,
"You're the child of a deatheater. You're easy leverage. Voldemort has loyalty to himself and only him. Probably doens't even have a soulmate. It would be too much of a risk to his conquest for eternal life."
"We need to force them together," she said quickly. "Harry's been doing everything possible to avoid Malfoy. We need to force them together otherwise the souls will decide it's time to leave. They'll find euphoria elsewhere."
Hermione smiled as Sirius unwillingly obeyed the logic and returned to Padfoot form. She pressed into Ron, causing him to wrap his arms around her, and she felt her own exhaustion pull her down.
"You realize that werewolves can almost never hold down a job right? Even if they miraculously get hired, which is almost never, they are out of commisson for the full moons and at least the day before and after. How would they have a house?"
He walked along the path, pulling his trunk along when he noticed the eyes across the road. He stopped, drawing his wand cautiously.
Draco nodded. "My father's education wasn't all bigoted, you know. I was taught how to deal with the wizengamot from a very early age."
his priorities list. The pureblood seemingly agreed as he leaned on his elbow the opposite direction from him.
He didn't offer her a response. He was definitely going to need to enlist Pansy in glamouring his blatant sickness. Hopefully she wouldn't ask too many questions about it.
"Nope. They didn't say," Harry replied. "But, I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. We get to spend a whole day away from the bloody rumour mill. Don't know about you, but I've had it up to my hair with it."
It wasn't difficult to find the polished and pressed slytherin compartment containing Malfoy. He opened their door without knocking.
He dug into his unwanted breakfast and at once remembered what having food cooked by an elf felt like. The house elves from the manor, the ones that had survived Voldemort's inhabitance, had been shipped off to Hogwarts or the Ministry and they hadn't provided food for weeks prior to the battle of Hogwarts. Harry sat down across from him and frowned into his teacup.
"Kreacher, you deserve to retire and you should. I've seen how tired you get keeping the few rooms that are lived in clean. You're getting old," Harry replied.
"I'm appalled by your skills in illusion. Nobody in their right mind would believe that," he snapped. "Return to your blood traitor friends, Potter and stay away from me."
Parkinson raised an eyebrow. "Never thought I'd ever hear those words come out of your mouth." She sighed. "But if you must know, he's going through soulmate rejection."
When Harry was missing from the welcome feast, he knew every other possibilty was false. Harry was definitely avoiding him which could only mean he was getting rejected. He forced his panic to stay locked up inside but left shortly after the food was appeared. He started walking through the castle, too anxious to go to the common room yet. How was he supposed to stop the rejection? How could he keep himself alive if Harry had decided that they were both going to die? Why would the gryffindor act so irrationally?
When Ginny left just before midnight, Draco was still reeling from the idea of going to the match and curiosity finally got the better of Harry.
The pureblood looked down. "I'm fine, Harry. Just confused about why you're giving a shit about me and wondering how long it'll take for you to want me gone too. It always happens."
"Can I ask, what's going on with you and Weaselbee?" Draco asked. "You're more than able to say no but, you seemed tense earlier."
Draco looked down, feeling his cheeks heat up. Before he could answer, however, black robes appeared on the chair beside him, curtesy of Kreacher. He couldn't bear the embarrassment of looking at Harry. He really was a charity case.
Harry tore the paper to shreds. Had he been at school, he would have burnt it to ash. There was nothing to discuss. Death would be preferable to being bound to that prick for the rest of eternity. Fate was clearly an idiot. He could have worked that out before. His entire past was just repeated reminders that fate was cruel and unkind. This soulmate pairing was just another example. He laid back down and decided that he would do everything possible to avoid any kind of interaction with his
Madam Pince shushed them and they silently worked on their DADA essay. It was a miracle they knew anything about it because toad professor was an absolute nightmare. She never taught practical defence. Everything was theoretical which led to so much guesswork in the essay writing. Some giggling behind the bookshelves attracted the librarian's attention and thirty seconds later, a hufflepuff couple were kicked out of the room, their belongings charmed to chase them far away. Harry barely suppressed a snicker. Draco smiled at his essay, managing to maintain some form of composure.
The dog, obviously, didn't respond, though it did cock it's head to one side. Perhaps it noticed the wings and couldn't work out whether he was a threat or not. A bus whooshed into view, nearly knocking him over with the abrupt speed. He stared up at the triple decker purple bus and frowned. Clearly it was magic, but he wasn't entirely sure how it found him. The conductor read off some speech and Harry made the decision to go to the Leaky Cauldron. It was the only place he could think of to house him until the start of term. He'd send a letter off from there. He deliberately avoiding small talk and borrowed the Prophet from Stan Turnpike. A man was on the front cover. Sirius Black. He'd escaped from Azkaban. Despite the fact that he was supposedly a mass murderer, Harry wasn't all that concerned. He knew that he could protect himself. Had another to protect too.
Harry looked down at his plate, leaving the toast untouched. He didn't look unwell but he clearly wasn't comfortable with everyone knowing. He absently rubbed at the soulmate mark. A loud crash came from the slytherin table. All eyes turned towards it. Malfoy was stood up, wand aimed at Crabbe. He looked furious with a hint of fear. Ron grabbed Harry's arm, forcing him to sit back down.
"Shadowing a potions master. Little shop in Diagon Alley just past Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Doesn't sell as much as most of the potions shops or apocatharies."
When he and Ginny got onto the topic of Quidditch (and especially the upcoming Harpies game), it became impossible not to notice Draco's interest. Without hesitating, Ginny included him in the conversation. He was greatful that she was playing nice. Since the war, her response to people had, without a doubt, been hit or miss. It had also been impossible to gauge which option she'd choose until after the choice had been made either.
He desperately wanted to spit insults at the man who'd broken his limb but used sheer force of will to remain silent. Somehow that atagonized the bastard more. His face contorted in rage and he shot several different curses in his direction. He allowed the pain to overcome him, mostly because he had no other choice, and blacked out momentarily. He woke up to the feral man yelling profanities while someone else was ranting about how little ettiquette there was to attacking an unarmed opponent. Draco was not about to look a gift horse in the mouth and took the distraction, no matter how temporary, to force himself upright. Every inch of his body protested. He could feel the agony of several broken bones and he was most definitely bleeding somewhere.
"I didn't know it was bothering you that much and usually, the wards let up after a while. You should have said something."
He got all the way downstairs, still having heard no one, and turned the corner on the living room. Harry was lounging on the nasty sofa while the she-weasel was sat on the floor beside the coffee table, that was covered in takeaway containers. He sensed the magical barrier between him and them. Neither of them noticed him for a few seconds before the she-weasel aimed her wand in his direction. Harry lifted his hand and the barrier vanished.
Draco forced his feet to keep moving. He couldn't stop. Not yet. He caught sight of the tavern he needed. It was still so far away.
"Alright, I concede. Your house, your choice. Whatever. What I came round to say was, Mum's doing a family dinner on Sunday. Are you coming?"
To her surprise, Pansy stepped up. "Professors, Headmaster, we are trying to stop two students from dying. They were rejecting their soulmates."
Sirius crossed the threshold, shutting the door behind him, and sat on the edge of the bed. He patted Harry's shoulder gently.
Draco sat on his bed and glared at the duvet. He wanted to be greatful about the invite to a proper Quidditch game. He hadn't been since the world cup before their fourth year. He wanted to relish in being invited somewhere decent, yet he couldn't. He knew it would end badly. Someone would throw a hex or a curse or a series of jinxes in his direction. He would end up at St. Mungo's or whichever magical hospital was closest to the arena. He wasn't safe in public. He only frequented muggle establishments when he had the rare desire to go outside. He couldn't go to a Quidditch match anymore than he could go to Diagon Alley. Magical folk hated him for what he'd been forced into, taking no consideration of the fact that he was sixteen when the mark had been branded onto him. He'd not even been of age by wizarding standards. There was a knock on his door followed by a slightly tipsy saviour entering the room, a bottle of firewhiskey in hand.
He stood in the alleyway, half hidden behind a bin and half, not particularly caring if he was seen. Hopefully, muggles would just think they were seeing things. The dog stood on the other side of the alley, behind a bin.
Draco kept his mouth shut, partly out of anxiety, partly because antagonizing the volitile little man would result in far worse than a couple of stunning spells. His heart pounded in his chest. He wanted to go home. It didn't matter that he no longer had one. It was the only place he wanted to be. Though in the moment he would have taken literally any other location. Anywhere would have been better. A bone-breaking curse was shot at his arm and he hissed in pain. He couldn't avoid the glare towards his attacker.
The napkin turned into a dove and Draco set it down in the middle of the table. He looked miserable and kind of broken. His words were out of his mouth before he'd fully processed the idea.
"No! That can't be- how the hell did you work that out from wireless when Harry didn't notice in person?"
The bottle swayed in his direction, empty enough not to slosh over the floor. Draco raised an eyebrow.
His eyes flicked over to Harry who nodded. "Peter Pettigrew is the murderer. He's also the traitor who sold my parents out and is the moron who resurrected Voldemort."
The owl remained indignant, hooting softly at him. He groaned. She was clearly not moving anytime soon. He rolled his eyes and offered her the letter.
Harry stopped and looked at him with a frown. "We were rivals for four years. You caused a lot of damage. Perhaps you might want to try a different approach rather than just not saying what you're thinking out loud. You've still got apologies to make. As far as I'm aware, I've never done anything to you that wasn't justified. There's a reason I'm only tolerating you. I gave you the chance to be better. That's why I accepted the soulmate situation. I still want out of the war. I still want to make choices for myself rather than allow fate to decide. I stopped rejecting you so that you had a chance to not be a prick. So that you could make amends."
He and Harry walked out of the cafe and into the alleyway beside it. Harry looked around before holding his arm out. Side along apparition was so much worse than solo and he definitely leaned on Harry's arm when they landed in what looked like a very tiny park. Draco looked around. They were definitely in a muggle area.
"Really? Hadn't noticed!" he replied tossing a sweet into his mouth. "Wouldn't be why I asked about drastic changes in appearance at all."
"Pretty sure that's a lot to do with me deliberately not antagonizing the situation," he said quietly.
Harry sat up slowly and looked down at his soulmate. Draco looked incredibly uncomfortable, despite the cool facade he had plastered onto his face. They locked eyes and Draco's mask slipped. He was terrified. Harry rolled his eyes.
The pureblood looked astonished. He didn't blame him for that. They weren't exactly friends. Hell, since the trial, it was the first time they'd seen one another. Harry fully expected a refusal but after several minutes, Draco hadn't said anything. The pureblood looked down at his plate again.
Usually the mark's were the initials of the soulmates and whatever children they were destined to have. Only one of Harry's letter's was in his name. Hermione looked back at Ron then caught a glimpse of Malfoy leaning against Parkinson. He looked worse than he had that morning. She looked back at Ron.
Draco looked up and roughly shoved his sleeve up. "That is all people ever see when I walk past, Harry. It doesn't matter that I was aquitted or that I'm wandless. They will never see me as anything but a deatheater."
"Yes, love, but the ministry doesn't want to pay attention and rumour has it, the Umbridge hag is in the building. I'd rather not lose you again."
"In a sense, yeah. I presume the two of you know my father well enough to know that he's not exactly the sentimental type. Harry pointed out that I'm hardly a barrier between handing him over to Voldemort."
They walked for several minutes until they came across a muggle all-hours cafe, which Draco did not hesitate to enter. Clearly he had changed since Hogwarts. Not that that was a surprise. Everyone had changed since Hogwarts. Harry told Draco to take a seat while he ordered. When he joined the pureblood at the mildly sticky table, they ate in silence for a few minutes. When another patron came in, took at glance at them and mumbled some homophobic slur, Harry didn't hesitate to wordlessly hit him with a stinging jinx. Draco definitely noticed and stared at him with wide eyes.
"You're as bad as Draco. Learn to drop what doesn't involve you! He's sorting it out, all right. Despite my arguments, he is dealing with it. Don't tell anyone. Not even Ron."
"Honestly, Draco, I didn't know it was causing you that much of a problem," Harry said gently. "Do you want a sleeping potion?"
Draco raised an eyebrow. "I'm still in possession of my faculties darling. His reasoning just made sense and, were I not possessing a strong sense of self-preservation, I'd probably have done the same in his position."
Harry was most definitely not the same golden boy he once was. He seemed almost slytherin in his behaviour. Well aside from saving him from public humiliation at the club and bringing him to a cafe to eat. That was still very much in the gryffindor spirit. Why he was helping him, he couldn't quite work out.
Harry flopped down on the rigid leather armchair and closed his eyes. Stupid portrait. He needed to find a way to get rid of her, even if only to Kreacher's quarters. She needed to not know when people entered the house. He listened as Draco slowly entered the room.
The blond sneered and raised an eyebrow. "What is it Potter? We were having a civilized conversation before you so rudely interrupted."
"Given that I'm pretty sure we're hiding from the same thing, I disagree," Draco replied, opening a DADA textbook to the exact same page he was on.
"Probably because he's not the one stupid enough to reject his soulmate," Blaise replied, sounding pissed.
That didn't surprise him. He'd paid little attention to the somewhat closed off Gryffindor but even he couldn't deny that the boy had had a glowing green thumb. He couldn't imagine how good he'd have to be to compete against Sprout. Perhaps she'd even mentored him. Such was the luck of war heroes.
"Well no. I contacted the minister and asked if I could discuss an urgent matter. He's friends with my father, Harry. A man who has a lot of connections within the ministry. He was hardly going to deny meeting with me."
Lupin stepped in front of the convict, blocking their view of him. Draco looked up at Harry. He was getting angry very quickly. Draco covered the hand on his shoulder with his own and Harry looked down at him. As they stared into each other's eyes, the anger slowly faded and Harry exhaled, seemingly defeated. They looked back at the men and watched as Sirius sat down on the bed with his arms crossed.
He slumped back against the sofa, still sat on the floor, while Draco stretched his legs out in front of him.
He didn't get a response but quietly pushed the door open anyway. Draco was flopped on the bed, barely covered by his duvet. At rest, he looked peaceful. Younger. Harry envied him slightly which he knew was logically unfounded. Sleeping potions could make a maniac look innocent.
Draco sat, causing the couch to squeak, and the room fell into a strange silence. It wasn't tense, per say, but it wasn't calm either. It was just... odd. Probably because neither of them really knew what to say to one another. They lacked common ground, or the knowledge of common ground if it existed.
Hermione was rather shocked at his logic. "Well, because everytime I run into you, you're with him. You pulled your hand away the last time I saw you in the library."
Draco smiled. His mother always had been more perceptive than she ever let on. He glanced at Hedwig. Of course the stubborn bird had worked her way into his mother's heart. She was clearly a very loyal animal. Harry looked at him.
"I'm not sure, Harry. Maybe they worked it out when neither of you, nor us were around yesterday. Draco fainted at their table at breakfast. You literally didn't leave your bed, though I'm pretty sure none of your dormmates said anything."
In case it wasn't already obvious, this is kinda slowburn, but that'll only last as long as my patience
He rolled his eyes. Of course Sirius wanted him to bring Malfoy. He'd have a blast antagonizing the son of a deatheater. He hit his head on the stone wall behind him. The Hogwarts rumour mill didn't help with being the centre of attention. As if he needed the help in the first place. Stupid people had nothing better to do. He was just a boy who didn't die as a baby. He had no say in it. Random fluke of nature. Or magic. Now he was soulmates with the enemy. He hit his head again. Could he ever have a quiet year at Hogwarts? Would everything always be so bloody dramatic? He bashed his head for a third time. It only sort of hurt.
Of course he was having a breakdown in front of Potter. He tried to breathe but the air got stuck in his throat. His vision blurred and he could feel his entire body shaking. His knees buckled and he felt arms brace him, stopping him from falling. His head fell forward, flopping onto Harry's shoulder.
Harry squeezed his shoulder gently and Sirius looked oddly disturbed. Lupin had a mask of neutrality on his face. They definitely knew his father.
Draco woke up in agony. His lungs hurt and his muscles felt tormented. The rejection was definitely happening and he hated it already. It was only day one of however many. He sat up and checked the time. Five thirty. Much too early to get ready for the day. He summoned some parchment and a self-filling quill then wrote a letter to his mother. She was the only one who would genuinely mourn his death. His slytherin friends might be sad for a bit but they'd get over it. His father... he'd been distant since the Quidditch World Cup. He charmed the letter to only be opened upon his death, before, begrudgingly, getting dressed and heading to the owlery. He frowned as Harry's snowy owl glided down to the perch.
"That is where you come in," Draco replied. "You're going to need to ask Lupin to escort us. Technically, we require an adult to enter the ministry anyway. Meeting is in a week."
"Is my existence really worth dying for, Potter?" he asked, not expecting a response. "I know we haven't exactly been friendly-"
"Harry went through a lot in the tournament. I think he wants out of the war. If he lets this kill him, he gets his wish. Plus, I don't think you understand how much Harry despises Malfoy. They've been at each other's throats since first year."
Draco looked up to see the looks of absolute revulsion in both men's eyes. They clearly didn't have a great relationship with their potions professor. Sirius shook his head.
"Sorry for yelling," Ron said, much calmer. "It just caught me by surprise. You sure you can trust him?"
"I can't tell my parents about this. Can't let it slip at all. What the hell was fate thinking matching us?"
"She knew I was lying about having a female soulmate. She also loves your owl," Draco replied. "Which isn't surprising. Hedwig seems delightful."
"We can work something out. I'll send an owl to Narcissa, though you should send one first telling her to look out for an unmarked letter arriving," Sirius replied.
Harry shrugged. "It's not like I have anywhere else to be and panic attacks are no fun to come down from alone."
The snowy owl took flight and Draco shook his head. He had no idea if the bird had any idea about the concept of soulmates or her owner's imminent death, but he also got a small amount of satisfaction in using her without Harry's agreement. It didn't even come close to the choice Draco was being denied, but it was the best he could get. He headed out of the owlery to run into Granger, who looked slightly frazzled. She frowned at him.
The half-giant offered a hesitant smile in return. "They're beautiful, 'Arry. I can see why Buckbeak likes you. As for you Mr Malfoy, that'll be ten points from slytherin for ignoring instructions and endangering the life of your fellow student."
She shrugged. "Harry thinks you deserve a second chance. You're not a threat to me. Nobody should have to throw up on a regular basis. You choose the option that helps you sleep at night, ferret. Doesn't bother me either way."
An owl dropped a letter in front of him then flew off out of the courtyard. He sat down on one of the walls and opened it.
He and she-weasel returned to the living room, where Harry had shuffled the food containers to one end of the table and produced a chess board on the other. She-weasel laughed, claiming that he had to be a masochist to believe he could win against her. He shrugged and informed her the game was on.
He fisted his hands. Talking was not helping. He wanted to throw things. He wanted to destroy the whole house. He also didn't want to freak Draco out.
Harry looked confused. "I know I don't have to. If you're referring to what you did in Hogwarts, then I would happily remind you that we were children and you were heavily influenced by your bastard of a father. If you're referring to the actions you didn't do once that mark was put on your arm, then I hate to break it to you but if there was a lick of evidence against you, you'd be rotting beside your father in Azkaban. Everyone deserves kindness, Draco, otherwise the world would be an incredibly dark place, and frankly, that was Voldemort's ideal reality, not mine."
He looked up and cut Harry off. "Thank you. I don't know why you're helping me so much, but thank you. I honestly don't deserve it after the way I treated you. After what I did. You really don't have to bother."
Back at the Hog's Head, up in one of the guest rooms, Draco sat on the wooden desk chair while Harry flopped back on the bed. Lupin placed silencing spells on the room and locked the door. When he was done, the dog hopped up onto it's back legs at the same time as morphing into a man. Draco's eyes widened when he saw who it was. Sirius Black. The convict smirked at him.
He didn't want to get out of bed. It was going to be a bad day, he could feel it in his bones. Despite knowing it and not wanting to, he hauled himself to his feet. He took a new set of clothes into the bathroom and showered before getting dressed. He needed to look somewhat presentable in the wizarding world, even though it didn't make the slightest bit of difference. He guessed it was remnants of his upbringing, the last fragments of his former grace. Draco scowled at his reflection. He did not want to go into the wizarding world. He wanted to stay firmly locked inside the strange bubble of security that Harry offered. He threw his clothes on his bed before heading downstairs.
"I can imagine. Would you like me to show you your room? Unfortunately none of them are much better than this."
He didn't hesitate to take up the offer. He needed to sleep. He caught the potion that Harry threw and twisted the vial between his fingers. He really had sunk low if he was desperate for dreamless sleep.
"They said you'd be by," the barkeep replied. "Went on a walk down by the shrieking shack ten minutes ago."
Draco slowly approached the kitchen, peering into the room through the slightly ajar door. Kreacher was stood on a stool so that he was at the same height as Harry. Both of them had their arms crossed tightly.
"Draco," Harry Potter's voice said gently, "You're alright. You're safe. It's not happening anymore. The war is over and Voldemort is dead.  You're safe."
"Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, sir," Ron said carefully. "They were rejecting one another incredibly fast. Our last shot at saving them was to put them together. We're waiting for them to come out, or for the doors to unlock, proving that they didn't make it."
He poured his unfinished tea down the sink before heading out the front door. He had no location in mind. He just walked. He continued moving until his legs hurt and he felt mildly hungry. He stood in the middle of the path, debating on whether to find an alleyway to apparate home in, or find a cafe. He opted for the latter and, after another twenty minutes of walking, found one. He slumped in a seat and read the muggle newspaper that someone had left behind. He didn't look up even when he sensed the chair opposite him get taken.
He shrugged, focusing his magic towards them and aiming to make them move. He felt the air move slightly as they fluttered. Hermione gasped but he didn't know what else to say. They spent the afternoon discussing what she'd read at some point in the last two years. In the end, he didn't really learn much beyond that he could possibly learn to hide the wings but it would put strain on his magic to do so. He pointedly left out the part where he was supposed to protect Malfoy because he really didn't want to admit that it was true before having spoken to the boy himself.
"They're mine. I only ever use them when I go to the ministry, which is almost never. They're probably slightly big on you but-"
Harry was acting weirdly. He was avoiding everyone (though in his defence, the fifth years were snogging or hooking up non stop) but he was cagey about where he was going every time she asked. She'd ran into him a few times and, more often than not, he was with Draco. She couldn't help but think it was because he'd never come out to them.
"Sure am and plan on keeping it that way," he replied, not dropping the newspaper. "Off you go love."
"Everything associated with me is," Harry said bitterly. "I've got to get back to my friends. Goodbye Remus."
Harry stood up and walked out of the room. The owls flew in with the morning post and a single owl flew out of the doors, likely to deliver something for Harry.
"I'm sorry for your loss, Harry," the pureblood said. "I... I'm not entirely sure how you feel. I don't mourn the loss of my aunt and my father deserves exactly what he's got. The closest comparison I have is my mother leaving the country and being unable to see her. If the pain is anything like that, I really am sorry you're going through it. Nobody should have to."
They went up so many stairs Draco got lost trying to work out where they were going. It wasn't until he heard Weaslebee string a very impolite sentence together that he even knew they'd found the others. Draco opened his eyes. Harry was very much being carried by the ginger and Granger was walking backwards and forwards with her eyes shut.
His Hogwarts letter arrived and he immediately headed into Diagon Alley to seek out his books and other supplies. He left his wings on display because he had no desire to be tired and was only slightly amazed that, even with all his books in hand, he didn't feel weighed down by them. He even asked the shopkeeper at Flourish and Blotts to add an extension charm to his bag so that he could carry everything more easily. She agreed after being paid a few galleons. He headed into the Quidditch shop and eyed up the Firebolt, knowing he could easily afford it but knew it was frivolous. He was looking at it with such intensity that he barely registered the door tinkling open until he heard who came in.
He felt a stick touch his leg below the table. A subtle glance down informed him that it was in fact a wand.
Harry closed his eyes. He wasn't going to try and make Draco come with him to Hogsmeade. Certainly wasn't going to force him to switch sides in the war. He was still ready to die if that was what was coming for him. If it was at the hands of Voldemort... well that was what he was destined for anyway. Draco sighed.
"I came into my inheritance this summer, Malfoy. It appears angel blood runs in my family and as my luck would have it, I am now bound to protect you from yourself."
Sirius made an odd huffing noise similar to that of a dog and Lupin rolled his eyes. He conjured a chair and sat down. Sirius stood behind him, arms loosely looped around his neck.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm hardly a pureblood these days, Potter. I spend the majority of my free time amongst muggles. They're more interesting than I used to give them credit for. I'm just not a particular fan of censuring myself for them."
It was three a.m. when the moaning started. It was quiet at first, barely audible, but it got increasing louder until it became clear that it was a scream. Hesitantly, Draco slipped out into the hallway. The sound was definitely coming from Harry's room. He padded over and knocked on the door. There was no response, but the scream got louder. He twisted the door handle and pushed it open. Harry was face up on his bed, wrapped in his duvet with sweat clinging to his face. Draco walked over and gently shook Harry's shoulders, waking him up from whatever nightmare he was having. It took several minutes before Harry responded and his first instinct was to grab his wand, aiming it at Draco's face.
He observed the pureblood for a few minutes before flopping back in his chair. He wasn't entirely sure what had happened to Draco in the years since since trial, but it clearly hadn't been good. There was no arrogance in him. No self-assurance. No... fight. He'd given up fighting. Harry couldn't blame him for it. He most definitely had given up fighting too. He would never get to be normal.
"How am I supposed to know who Hedwig is? It was the bird that took my letter. That's all that matters."
"It's Sirius's birthday," he said at a whisper. "It's his birthday and he's not around to celebrate it even though he should be. He was victim to the second war of his lifetime and it's not fair. It pisses me off. Ron doesn't get it, even though he should because he lost Fred, but it's not the same for him. He has a whole family to fall back on. I've got no one."
"Where's all that pureblood fight, huh? Was it all just an act to pretend you were better than the rest of us? A facade so that you could sit upon your throne while the rest of us obediently served you? Cat got your tongue boy?"
"Why would you do that?" he asked quietly. "You... we hated each other. I was a miserable git to you and your friends. I... why would you want to help me out?"
Draco shook his head. "Murder of Charity Burbage. The former muggle studies professor. She became Nagini's lunch and severral of the deatheaters were forced to watch. Somehow I doubt even the most loyal enjoyed that particular viewing."
Thank you for your letter. Unfortunately, I don’t have any openings right now, but one of my partners has a slot that you can take if you’re happy to work with someone else?
“Nothing. We’ll split bills and things, but I already own the house so it’s not like I’ll be paying a mortgage or anything. All I ask is that you give me a hand with the renovations.” Luna nodded enthusiastically.
The rest of the day saw Harry helping when and where he could and there was another buffet put out in the evening for all of the guests. All of the work that could be done that day had been done by then and everyone say around outside, talking and unwinding after the long day. Harry was reminded once again how lucky he was to have such an amazing adoptive family and group of friends. They’d all worked tirelessly throughout the day to make sure that Ron and Hermione’s wedding the day after would be perfect. He looked around at everyone laughing and nattering about anything and everything and felt like he well and truly belonged. He was safe and happy here, but he also couldn’t wait to see what came next. He was looking forward to the wedding the day after, he was looking forward to the birth of Bill and Fleur’s baby, he was looking forward to seeing what the tiny seed of an idea about the salon would grow into with his friends’ and family’s help.
After they’d eaten, they spent time taking the official photographs. When they’d been done Ron and Hermione had their first dance. Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes again as he watched them sway softly to the slow melody that was being played. He spent the afternoon dancing and talking and actively avoiding Malfoy. He didn’t get to talk to Ron or Hermione much. They were the centre of everyone’s attention and he wondered how exhausted they must be already. Everyone looked like they were having an amazing time, chatting to people they hadn’t seen in months or even years. As the sun went down the flowers that Neville had prepared bloomed, revealing the twinkling lights. A buffet of food that rivalled Hogwarts’ feasts appeared on long tables and everyone ate hungrily again, almost forgetting how much food they’d eaten before. Harry grinned as he saw Ginny and Luna sat off to one side, their hands entwined. He caught Ginny’s eye and winked, making them blush and turn back to Luna. He made a mental note to talk to Ginny about it the next day and ask how it had happened. His heart was full of love and joy. He turned around to grab some more food.
“Sorry, Charles.” Ginny retorted, earning a hair ruffle from the older Weasley. The three of them sat drinking and chatting for a while. Harry had never spent much time around Charlie when he was younger, but the more he got to know him, the more he realised what a down to earth, pleasant person he was. He showed Harry and Ginny his new tattoo. It was of an origami dragon that slowly folded its wings in and out. The lines were so precise that it amazed Harry, and Ginny asked where he’d had it done.
“Right. Well, I guess I do look a bit out of place, don’t I? I’ve just come from the office, you see. I suppose I don’t really fit in with the décor around here.” Harry expected to see a smirk on her face when she was talking about The Burrow, but it wasn’t there. Instead she had an almost wistful look in her eyes. “It looks wonderful. I can’t wait to see what it looks like tomorrow at the actual wedding when everything’s finished.” Harry felt shock run through him again. He hadn’t expected Pansy to be invited to the wedding, but he didn’t really know why. He supposed that he’d never really thought of Pansy and Hermione as friends, but simply as work colleagues. Though, when he thought back he realised that Hermione talked about Pansy a lot, and she’d often spent time with her after work; either finishing things off that they’d not gotten done during working hours, or simply going out for a glass of wine with her.
He was helping Ginny train when the rain came. He felt one drop at first, then another, and another. Then there was a torrential downpour and both him and Ginny stood where them were, shocked. The ground soon turned slippery with sludge and they both took the rare opportunity to let their inner child take over and they began pushing each other into the mud. When their sides ached from laughing and Ginny’s hair was brown from the mud, they went back inside. Harry had gratefully accepted a cup of tea and small plate of biscuits off Molly after a quick shower and Ginny had gone for a long soak in the bath that Harry had put on to run.
“That’s not true. I only took an interest because the git was always up to something.” Ginny laughed again.
After dinner Harry made himself another tea and went and sat outside. He was happy. He was at peace. But he knew that he would have to do something soon. He was growing bored of his nice existence. He knew he would have to get a job at some point and decide where he wanted to live. He had the choice of two inherited houses, or he could easily afford a flat, or even get Ron to draw up some plans for Dean and Seamus to build him a house. It was something to consider in the future. He knew that he couldn’t live off his inheritance and Molly’s kindness his whole life. He sighed and leaned back, cradling his tea between his hands. Ginny’s voice came from behind a nearby tree.
Harry almost dropped the tray he was holding when he ran into, almost literally, someone he didn’t expect to see there. Pansy Parkinson was carrying arms full of what looked to be documents towards the house. Her hair was cut into the bob that she’d always had it styled in while they were at Hogwarts and she was wearing a simple but expensive looking while blouse and black pencil skirt. She was wearing an almost burgundy lipstick that contrasted wonderfully with her pale skin and her lips were drawn into an easy, amused smile.
“People only really found out today Hermione. I went for a meeting and collapsed. But it’s fine, Fleur says it’s just the flu. I should be over it in a few days. Hopefully before she has the baby.” Harry told Hermione about what had happened that day and all about his plans for opening the salon. She told him that she thought it was a fantastic idea and offered her help for when he needed to decorate or help in coordinating things. She was back at work soon, but her and Ron were always happy to help. He thanked her and they chatted more about what had been happening since the wedding.
“Harry, wake up.” He recognised the soft voice and as his eyes opened a gentle face and blonde hair came into view. Luna was smiling down at him. She sat next to him and offered him a cup of tea, which he gladly accepted.
“I’ve never been so excited about anything in my whole life, even the Quidditch world cup. I mean, have you met that woman? She’s amazing. And, of course I’m nervous, but not about if I’m making the right choice or not. I just want everything to go right.” Harry set down his plate and cup and embraced his friend.
When Harry got back to the kitchen, Arthur and Lucy were carrying baskets of vegetables into the kitchen from the garden.
“It’s eleven thirty and you’re still in bed.” They said accusingly. “What were me meant to be doing this morning?”
“Sure Gin, I’ll ask her when she comes over today. I’ll have a the floo connected to here at some point too, so it’ll be easier for you guys to see each other.” Ginny smiled and gratefully took the mug of tea that Harry handed them as he sat down.
“Good, thought we’ve barely seen anything of one another with all the drama of you being ill, Ron and Hermione moving and the new baby. I’ve also been training a lot, and Luna has the quibbler to run. It’s been pretty mental to be honest.” Harry nodded his head then stood up, heading over to the kettle.
“I will never get tired of magic.” Christopher sighed. We were so proud of our Hermione when she got her Hogwarts letter. McGonagall came to visit us to explain it all and I just couldn’t believe it. Our girl, going away to train to be a witch. Of course we never imagined what she’d go through, but she’s strong, stronger than we ever could’ve imagined. I can’t believe what a beautiful, smart, caring, strong, independent young woman our little girl has become. Well, that’s a lie, I can; just look at her mother.’ He looked at Jenny and Hermione in turn, his eyes misting with pride. A lump rose in Harry’s throat and he had to look away. The conversation soon turned to memories and achievements. Harry was thankful that no-one mentioned anything to do with Voldemort, but instead spoke about the more mundane, yet still amazing, things that everyone had been working on since the war had ended. While the adults were talking, Lucy was running around the garden playing with the dogs. Percy had come down for food before leaving again, insisting that he had lots of work to do. Ginny sat as far away from him and they could, purposefully not talking to them but instead conversing with others around the table. Harry didn’t blame them.
“I don’t think I can face him after what happened. He’ll never let me live it down. And I don’t know if I’d be able to work with Malfoy even if I hadn’t fallen onto my face in front of him and had him carry me in his bloody arms back to The Burrow.”
Malfoy didn’t say much while Harry spoke, bar making small sounds of acknowledgement, or asking for clarification when needed. He bit the inside of his cheek while concentrating. Harry had never noticed he did that before.
The rest of Harry’s day was spent lounging. While he didn’t feel particularly ill anymore, his energy levels weren’t very high, so he took the opportunity to rest, eat and drink tea. He spent a lot of time in the reading nook in the front room. It was one of his favourite places to be because he could alternate between reading, napping and watching the chickens out in the garden. It rained in the evening and he went out to a sheltered place and relished the feel and smell of freshness in the air. He hoped it was a sign of good change coming to him, even though he’d never really believed in omens or divination. When he went to bed, he slept much better. He couldn’t remember his dreams but they weren’t nightmares, and for that he was thankful.
“Yeah, I’m just tired. It feels like I’ve done a marathon.” Harry’s muscles felt tangled into knots and he had a headache that was niggling at the back of his skull.
Ron and Hermione appeared not long after, and then they all sat down to eat on the tables outside. As always, the conversation flowed easily. Harry sat back and watched his friends and family talking and laughing. He drank in the joy and happiness that surrounded him, knowing that he would miss it when he moved out, but finding himself excited for what the future held in store for him. He knew that he would appreciate his easy comfort more when he wasn’t constantly surrounded by it, and he promised himself that he would try and visit The Burrow as often as possible after he moved. He also knew that he would have to tell Mrs Weasley as soon as possible. Hopefully she would be distracted by the happiness of the new baby and that would soften the blow of him leaving, but he knew she would still be upset. After all, he was like a son to her. Affection for the woman spread throughout him, but he was soon distracted as Ron placed a huge slab of chocolate fudge cake down in front of him and Arthur topped up his cider. He smothered his cake in cream and was enveloped back into the conversation, a smile on his face and in his heart.
Neville, Dean and Seamus arrived later on that day. They were going to spend the couple of days before the wedding putting together gazebos and marquees to give people places to shelter from the heat. Neville was in charge of living flower arrangements, including flowers that glowed with soft light when it went dark that would provide lighting in the evening. The next couple of days were bound to be full of stress, work and excitement. None of them minded, however, as they’d been promised Molly and Ron’s cooking. Harry was looking forward to watching everyone creating and working with the things they loved. It was fascinating to him to see people so passionate about things. He was charged with odd jobs and then styling the hair of the bridal party, which included Hermione the bride, Ginny as the maid of honour and Fleur and Luna as the bridesmaids. He couldn’t wait to see what they all looked like after he’d finished, especially when they were all in their beautiful clothes.
“Gin’s been getting a lot of letters recently,” Ron remarked, looking up from the sketch book in front of him and tucking a pencil behind his ear. “I wonder who they’re from.”
“Yeah.” They sighed. “Or maybe I’m destined to always have something that I’m confused or panicking about for the rest of my entire life.” They flopped backwards into a laying position on the bed.
“Don’t look so startled, Potter. I’m just here to drop these papers off for Hermione and pick some other ones up off her. You do remember that we work together, right?” Harry nodded and pulled himself back together.
People split off and went to their respective rooms or hung out in the kitchen or living room when the sun had finally gone in completely. Harry went up to his room to read for a while. He enjoyed reading so much more than when he was in school. He was in the middle of a book called ‘The Magic Cottage’ by James Herbert at that point and he looked forward to reading it each night before bed. He found it to be a brilliant way to relax his mind and therefore fall to sleep easier. He also usually didn’t have nightmares if he read before bed. It was something that the mind healer that he’d seen after the war had suggested. That wasn’t to say that he didn’t still have nightmares; he often woke up in a cold sweat, shaking. Sometimes he could calm himself down, but usually he got out of bed and sat in his desk chair, looking out of his window and the moon and stars. A lot of the time he thought about Sirius. He sometimes wrote letters to him, trying to put his thoughts, feelings, confusions and worries down into words. It made him feel like someone was looking over him. Of course, he missed his mum and dad, but he’d never really known them. Sirius and Remus had been tangible. He’d known them and loved them and learned from them.
“It’s going to be awesome. You both deserve it.” Ron hugged him back and when they pulled away from one another, they were both misty eyed. The rest of their breakfast they spent talking about what else needed doing for the wedding and talking to other people as they went in and out of the kitchen for breakfast or more caffeine.
“Harry cut it for me. I think it suits me.” They crossed their arms firmly. Eyes flashing daringly at Percy.
“Damn right you’re going to. Now, we should probably actually unpack while we’re up here.” Harry realised that he was eaves dropping and carried on to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could. He’d just discovered a newfound respect for Audrey.
“Percy’s sulking upstairs at the minute, but he’ll come round.” She whispered into Ginny’s ear, before picking up a drowsy, heavy eyed Lucy and taking her into the living room to put her down for a nap.  They could hear Audrey singing softly to the little girl. When Lucy had fallen to sleep, Audrey went back into the kitchen to see if anyone needed any help with anything. They gratefully accepted her help and she got stuck in.
Bill and Fleur arrived just after all the breakfast things had been cleared away. The heat had come back with a vengeance and Fleur looked like she was melting with her huge baby bump. A gigantic smile kept breaking out on Bill’s face every time he looked at her. Fleur was on Maternity Leave from her position as a healer at St Mungo’s and she was due to give birth a couple of weeks after Ron and Hermione’s wedding. When they’d told the family, Molly could barely contain her excitement. She’d already knitted the baby enough clothes for the first year of its existence. Harry chatted with the family for a while, enjoying the busy hustle and bustle of people having several different conversations at once, people flitting in and out of the kitchen doing jobs and Bill and Fleur’s Basset Hound Philippe playing with Charlie’s Central Asian Shepherd Hound Lara.
“Only if you never make me picture any of my brothers having sex ever again. Or my parents, before you say anything” They added, pre-empting Harry’s next words. He shut his mouth again, fearing for his poor arms. They stayed in silence for a little while and Harry looked around the rooms. He noticed a stack of letters; each one dyed a different pastel colour and carefully folded. They were being weighted down with a pretty conch shell.
“This cider is to die for, Arthur.” Hermione’s dad, Christopher, wrapped a large, muscular arm around Arthur’s shoulders. Christopher towered over Arthur, but he was one of the sweetest, jovial people that Harry knew. Jenny, Hermione’s mother, rolled her eyes at her husband.
Harry loved the outfit that he was wearing for the wedding. It consisted of charcoal grey dress robes with a white shirt, lilac tie and shiny black brogues. He took a last look in the mirror and smoothed his hair down before going to find Ron. When he did, Ron was sat with Bill, Charlie, George and Percy. He looked as excited as Hermione had been. It was 45 minutes before the wedding; fifteen minutes before they had to go and meet McGonagall who would be officiating the wedding. She’d cried when Ron and Hermione had asked her, saying that she would be honoured. When they went into the garden it was jam packed full of people; family and friends were everywhere they looked. They were all congratulating Ron as he walked towards the bandstand like gazebo where McGonagall stood, reading through some documents. Chairs were set out on the large lawn with a lilac carpet running down the middle of them leading towards the gazebo. Each chair had a Lilac or silver sash hung over it and they shimmered in the sun. Harry patted his pocket absentmindedly for what felt like the hundredth time since Ron had handed him the rings, making sure they were still there. Ron was busy signing documents and talking to McGonagall.
“I don’t think you have anything to worry about, Gin. I can almost feel her feelings for you coming off this piece of paper. Ginny smiled.
“It went well. We’re meeting again in a couple of days when Malfoy has had a chance to look over the plans.” Harry poured the hot water into the mug and stirred thoughtfully. “I’m going to move into Grimmauld. I’m going to renovate it a bit at a time- starting with the rooms I need to live in- and live there. It’ll be easier for me if I’m going to work in London. It’s going to feel pretty empty there though.” Ginny made a small noise in the back of their throat and leaned forward in their chair.
I am so sorry I have been away for so long- I got really sick and then work has been manic. IF you're still here, thank you! If not, I understand.
“Calm down Harry, you’re alright.” The soft French accent calmed him somewhat, and Fleur laid a cool cloth on his forehead.
Harry felt much better that day, but he still took his potion as instructed by Fleur. She would be staying in the hospital for a few days for observations as a precaution because the baby had been born just over a week early, but they both seemed fine. His appetite was fully back, and he ate his breakfast outside while he watched Ginny train, giving them pointers here and there. Their try-outs were getting closer by the day and they’d taken some time off for the wedding and the birth of the baby, so they were on a very strict routine. It was still warm, and Harry lounged in the sun, enjoying the rays on his face. He watched the members of the Weasley household coming to and fro and decided that he should reply to Malfoy’s letter. He said goodbye to Ginny and went up to his room.
“Who wants to help me pod some peas?” He asked, distributing the buckets between people as they all agreed. He pulled Lucy onto his knee when he’d done giving the buckets out and carefully showed her how to pod the delicious peas. Dean watched carefully too, smiling proudly to himself as the small green spheres popped out and fell into his bucket.
The next day people emerged slowly throughout the day. Harry woke up earlier than he thought he would and set about helping with the great tidy up operation. They all worked hard, wanting to have everything sorted as soon as possible. By five everything was spotless and by six everyone was sat around eating. A lot of people had gone home but the dismantling of the huts was a job for the day after. Harry’s body ached and he was exhausted, but the day before had been worth it. Ron and Hermione were still at their bungalow and he didn’t expect to see them for a few days. He found a spot under a shaded tree with a cold drink and closed his eyes for a second.
It was this picture that Harry was looking at when he heard his door creak open. He lifted his head to see Ginny poking her head around the door.
“Yeah, just thinking I guess.” Harry smiled reassuringly at Ron and began to eat the omelette that had just been placed down in front of him. It was delicious.
Hermione joined them not long after and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen her so excited. The usually perfectly calm and put together woman was a ball of eager energy and Harry was delighted to see her glowing like she was. She was wearing a simple sun dress in a Lilac that complemented her rich skin perfectly. Her dress was hung up in Ginny’s room where she’d stayed the night before. Molly had insisted that it was bad luck for the bride and groom to stay together the night before the wedding, so Ron and Hermione had humoured her. Harry hugged Hermione and they set about discussing her hair. They’d already decided that they would relax it slightly, so it dropped in smoother ringlets, but that was just a case of adding some products and potions to it. She was adamant that she didn’t want it straight like she’d had it at the Yule Ball, and Harry had agreed. He loved Hermione’s hair and didn’t want to take away the natural beauty of it. She’d already washed her hair and used a leave in conditioner, so her hair was still damp. Harry set about splitting her hair into half inch sections and applying a product that would help the hair to hang in tight ringlets, occasionally spraying the hair to keep it wet. This process took quite a while and it was nearing ten when they’d finished. It would take another hour or so for it to dry and fix under the slow drying spell before they could move on to the next step. Cho arrived not long after they’d finished, and she set her gear up in the space that Harry had set aside for her.
All hustle and bustle stopped and the pair of them walked into the kitchen. All eyes turned on Ginny.
“I should, um, get back to the Burrow. I’d like to go and see Bill and Fleur and the baby.” He felt like he was making excuses. “Sorry.” He added quickly.
Lunch was laid out in a similar way to breakfast, but instead of being served in the kitchen, it was laid out on tables outside. The tables were almost bowing under the weight of twenty different kinds of sandwiches, pork pies, sausage rolls, quiches, more cuts of cold meats, a huge salad that had been prepared fresh from the garden, dips, crisps, more fruit, cakes and biscuits. Arthur had also prepared a variety of different juices. While they were eating, Harry decided to speak to Dean and Seamus about their business. The idea that Ginny had planted in his head the day before had been growing, and he’d been thinking more and more about it. When he asked how they’d known how to run a business, they laughed.
“Your 2:30 is here, Sir.’ The barista told the man. He looked up to where Harry was stood, and his grey eyes widened in surprise. Blaise clearly hadn’t told him who his 2:30 appointment would be. He stood up and extended a hand as Harry walked towards him, taking in his dark grey suit and plum coloured shirt, which he wore open slightly with no tie.
I am free at one in the afternoon tomorrow. If you’re feeling up to it then we will meet then at the same coffee shop as last time. If you aren’t feeling up to it, please send an owl on the day and we can re arrange the meeting for a more suitable time and date. I’m sure you’re anxious to get the ball rolling with your idea and the sooner we can meet to discuss the basics, the sooner I can formulate some plans for you.
“Yeah. I told her. I nearly passed out I was so nervous. She just laughed in that way that she does and hugged me.”
“I’ll sleep on it. I want something edgy and awesome. Maybe some kind of quiff.” As they said that, they laid their head on Harry’s shoulder, contemplating different hair styles. He wrapped his arm around their waist and sipped at his tea. It was cold.
Harry read over the letter a few more times before he sent it off with Pig. He made himself another cup of tea and settled down in the reading nook to half read-half nap and enjoy the sun coming through the window. He kept checking the sky, looking for signs of Pig. He was worried about the meeting with Malfoy, but he supposed Ginny was right. If Malfoy could be professional, so could he. He wondered who else Malfoy had worked with and what their experience of working with him was like. Ginny seemed to know a little bit about Malfoy’s work so he decided to ask them after they’d finished training. When the letter from Malfoy arrived, Harry’s stomach flipped a little. He read it quickly.
Ginny came up not long after with some chicken soup made by Molly and some bread. He managed some of it, but he still had a very small appetite. He placed the bowl on the side and turned to Ginny.
“We all love you Gin. Percy is just being a twat. I think Audrey is going to kick his arse for him. Let’s hope he doesn’t enjoy it too much.” Ginny groaned and pushed Harry away.
“What the hell, Ginny?” Percy’s voice was low. “What have you done to your hair? You look like a boy.”
“You going to drink that, Potter, or just cradle it until it goes cold like you usually do?” She smirked and sat next to him. “Harry?” He looked up into her face. She looked apprehensive and took a deep breath. “I need you to do me a favour.”
Ron and Hermione got together at the end of the war. There was something about them that just fit. Hermione was strong and independent, and Ron loved that about her. He knew that she could look after herself and he admired her passion and drive. She’d gone back to Hogwarts to study and get the qualifications she needed to get the job she wanted at the Ministry. She threw herself into her studies as a way of dealing with her grief and as a way of proving herself to others. Ron stayed at The Burrow and looked after his mum. He cooked and cleaned on the days that she couldn’t get out of bed and he drew a lot. He would go out for hours walking and drawing landscapes. He drew a portrait of Hermione for their first anniversary and it was one of the most beautiful things that Harry had ever seen. He’d managed to catch her power, calm confidence and wicked mischief whilst also perfectly portraying her soft curves, perfect skin and gorgeous bouncy hair. It really was a masterpiece. After a while he started drawing up plans for buildings that Dean and Seamus were working on. They offered him a position in their business as a partner. He declined, saying he’d rather work freelance, but they would have first dibs on him if they ever needed him. It was tough for the couple at the start of their relationship. They were apart for a lot of it, only seeing each other at weekends and during the holidays, and they were both broken and grieving. They made it work though. The three of them spent the weekends and holidays that Hermione was back from Hogwarts looking for ways to fid her parents and restore their memories. It took them seven and a half months, but they managed it with the help of the rest of the family and the teachers at Hogwarts. Harry blinked a couple of times, picking up a handful of blueberries and anchoring himself back in the present. Ginny squeezed his shoulder supportively and left to go and find more cider for the rest of the group and gooseberryade for themselves.
Ginny was the last person to enter the kitchen. She was wearing A tank top and shorts; her muscles twisting and tensing as she moved. Her waist length red hair was scraped back into a messy bun that flopped as she plopped herself down onto the bench next to Harry.
“Are you excited Hermione?” Fleur asked, resting her glass on her bump and shifting to try and get comfortable again.
Ginny was buzzing with nervous energy next to Harry. They’d decided that Harry was going to cut their hair the next day. They were going for a style that was short at the sides with some length at the top so they could style it if they wanted to. It was currently tied up in its usual messy bun and Harry couldn’t wait to get his hands on it. Ginny had spoken to Hermione about it, worried that the drastic change would detract attention from her at the wedding and put it on Ginny instead. Hermione had just smiled and wrapped Ginny in a hug, assuring them that they should do whatever made them comfortable. Harry could tell that Ginny was worried about how her family would react. Harry knew that they had no reason to be. They’d all been perfectly accepting when Charlie had come out as gay and then later on as asexual, but he could also understand Ginny’s fears. They’d also been the only little girl of the family for a long time. Ginny was also super nervous about the upcoming trials for the Holyhead Harpies. They’d been training non-stop since they’d been asked to try out the previous month. The try-outs were still a month off, but Ginny wanted to position of Chaser so badly that all of their fiery determination had been poured into practicing and training. Harry reached under the table and squeezed their hand, shooting them a small smile, and they seemed to calm down a fraction. Ginny jumped slightly as an owl tapped frantically on the kitchen window. It was Pig with a letter. They ran over to the window to let the frantic owl in and carefully untied the letter before giving the tiny owl a treat and rushing upstairs.
“Erm, Hermione’s, Fleur’s, yours, your mums, Audrey’s, Lucy’s and Luna’s, when she gets here.” Ginny nodded, glancing up at the clock on the wall. It was just gone nine.
For the next couple of hours people popped in and out to get their hair and makeup done and Harry was thriving. He adored seeing the finished product and knowing that he’d created it. Molly couldn’t get over how shiny he’d managed to get her hair and Audrey was astounded with the victory rolls that Harry had produces. The vintage style suited her down to the ground. He’d given Lucy soft, beachy waves and affixed an ever-lasting daisy into her hair. It was nearing twelve and he’d just started working on Fleur when Luna arrived. Luna and Fleur were going to be bridesmaids and Ginny was the Maid of Honour. They’d decided to go with soft curls with the front part taken back and braided down the back of the hair. Fleur was as breath-taking as ever when Harry had finished with her and Cho revelled in doing her makeup while he did Luna’s hair. He noticed that Ginny was struggling to take their eyes off the grinning woman sat in the chair in front of him. She was chatting about what stories she’d been working on at work and Ginny hung off every word she said. Harry new they’d be perfect for one another if they did decide to pursue a relationship and a feeling nagged at the pit of Harry’s stomach. It wasn’t jealousy or envy. He was incredibly happy for Ginny at the prospect of them finding love. He couldn’t figure out what it was, but it felt something like longing.
"What the hell did you do to me?" It was barely above a whisper, half furious and half afraid and somehow, Blaise felt it was even worse than the growling accusation from before. He lowered his head deeply and turned it to the side so that Harry would be able to see and reach his neck.
That particular parlour was one of Narcissa’s masterpieces, one she had completely redesigned in a neoclassical style after she had wedded into the Malfoy family. Richly decorated, white pillars separated the tall windows that reached up to the high ceiling that in itself was covered by delicately chiselled mouldings. The aesthetic wallpaper, the curtains and the furniture’s upholstery were of different soft shades of green, blending beautifully and the settees, arm chairs, tea tables and other more decorative pieces of furniture were made of a pale wood with intricate carvings.
Immediately Harry knew that this was not planned: next to him both of his hosts stiffened, their faces hardening into cold, unreadable marble. Curiously Harry watched from them to the portrait and back, and it made him intrigued: this Ives, this ancestor of Draco's seemed so unorthodox for a Malfoy, open and yet guarded, confident without being conceited and even though he was nothing more than a painting, it seemed he knew how to play them.
Ricarda glanced towards him then, her eyes gleaming with a cruel malicious spark, too hard to be called gleeful, too intense to be called cold. "And will you, should Mr Potter not have mated with Taide by midday today, do whatever necessary to kill these, your captives," Curtly, she nodded towards the mirror, "as long as it won't endanger you, your family or your allies?"
Draco hissed and threw his head back, bucking against his lover, before falling down onto the soft mattress again. "Fuck, Blaaaaiise!" He moaned and bit his lower lip sharply.
He had promised to help protect Lily Potter's son, her only legacy to the world, and as long as the brat would not stop getting into problems too big to crawl away from on his own clumsy hands and feet, he would do just that.
A bit of the tenseness that Blaise had felt piercing his body during the last two hours faded away gently like spears turned to nothingness. Granger, Weasley and that girl that had been so close to binding their Harry to her would be safe and as such, Harry would be, too. Because, while the Boy-Who-Lived had an undeniable hero complex and would never leave a friend in danger, there were only a few people that Blaise knew had that kind of value that would make Harry rush into danger for them mindlessly, thoughtlessly, unable to see reason.
Sometimes, Ron thought, it might have been easier for his conscience if Harry hadn't forgiven him so casually, hadn't acted as if it wasn't a huge matter for his best friend to betray him.
"I'm sorry to disturb you so early." Blaise said as diplomatically as he could, pressed for time as he was, and forgoing a direct answer, with a narrow inclination of his head as the only concession to this act of discourtesy. "I wouldn't have if time wasn't of so fundamental importance."
Firming his resolve Draco whispered to Giallina not to interfere in any way and pushed himself forward with a few powerful beats of his wings, before pulling them closer to his body, plummeting towards the very heart of that flickering bluish column.
Well, it was true that no one could honestly contest Lucius having been a follower of the Dark Lord, but to say it like that was going a bit far, wasn't it?
