“Thank you, Granger,” he said sincerely. He couldn’t believe his good fortune in meeting someone like her. Someone who wasn’t willing to let him work through everything by himself.
“Why not? I’m sure Harry would be thrilled.” She smirked and it actually scared Draco quite a bit.
“Er...I know that you and Harry used to be together. For a bit, before...Oh that’s enough right? I can’t think of anything else!” Her voice was high and panicked. Draco could imagine her wringing her hands in worry.
“I’m here. Just thought I saw something.” The two of them appeared and Potter slipped out from the alcove to join them.
“Yay! See told you he’d say yes.” Pansy stuck her tongue out at Theo and smirked. Draco sighed, but smiled as well. At least they were happy. The day for the match between Slytherin and Gryffindor arrived and Draco was so nervous his stomach hurt. He wasn’t nervous for the actual match, he didn’t actually care about that. No he was nervous for when all of the Slytherins would burst into song and humiliate Weasley. And everyone knew no one insulted Potter’s best mate. There was a good chance Potter would curse you after that.
“We already know the truth! Harry Potter is a liar and Cedric Diggory is dead from a misunderstanding!”
“Malfoy, wait.” She said, hurrying over to him.
“He has a habit of pushing people away.” she had said sadly.
“Yeah, who wouldn’t like you?” And he meant it.
“I assumed so.” She bit her lip and gave a long sigh. “Can we go somewhere else? I want to tell you everything, but not here. It’s too depressing.” He tried not to feel too insulted. The corner of her mouth quirked up. “No offense.”
“Shhh. I need to think.” Luna muttered. She clamped her lips together firmly, though Draco didn’t miss the fact that she was shaking like mad. He wiped at his eyes, now was really not the time for him to fall apart. But fuck it. He hated feeling so helpless.
And for some reason that broke something in him. He supposed it was nice to know that other people cared when he was sad.
Merlin. This was going to be an awkward journey.
Draco waited but Snape didn’t say anything.
Harry placed his hands on the table next to Draco’s and smiled. Draco had never noticed Harry had a dimple on his right cheek. Without thinking Draco entwined their fingers together, grinning.
“I don’t know if you want me to talk about him.” She shrugged. Oh. Oh…
“And he assigned me a task, to kill Dumbledore. I couldn’t refuse, I knew he’d go after my mother, so I agreed. Obviously I’m not actually going to kill him.” He reassured her, after her expression had grown more and more panicked. She nodded,
“There was no misunderstanding!” Finch Fletchley yelled.
He sat there for so long that early morning light finally soaked through the curtains and into the dim hallway.
And maybe I'll write another oneshot we'll see.
“Oh. How long have you been here?” he asked. Had she witnessed him on the verge of a mental breakdown? He’d probably been muttering nonsense while walking back and forth.
“I was at a meeting earlier today.” he said quietly. “And they told me the best student in Hogwarts was Hermione Granger. A muggleborn.” Draco’s heart dropped to his stomach. He was…
“What are you doing Malfoy?” The Weasel spat, breaking the silence between him and Potter.
“Fine.” Draco turned away angrily and stormed the other direction. That wasn’t the end of it though. Moments later he saw Potter, dancing with Cho Chang. That turned his stomach more than anything that happened in the past hour. Hadn’t she come with Diggory? Diggory was nowhere in sight. Fuming Draco stormed out of the ball, looking forward to throwing himself on his bed and screaming. And maybe crying a tad as well. He was about to head up the stairs when Granger came running out of the ball as well. Her eyes were red and she looked livid.
“Detention! All of you!” Umbridge said, now turning very red in the face.
Dear Harry,
“Confronting Malfoy mate.”
Sincerely,
“No.” he shook his head even as he felt wet tracks down his cheeks. “I don’t care.”
Sincerely,
Draco nodded, wondering how it was possible to feel so happy.
I hate you. I absolutely despise you. And do you want to know something? You’re never going to read any of my letters. Ever. I hope you have a horrible friendship with Weasel and he stabs you in the back. I’m not going to do anything about it. Because we are never going to be friends. I will hate you for all eternity and spend the rest of my days making you miserable. And to think I was going to go behind my fathers back for the likes of you. You can have your Weasel and you’re stupid Gryffindor pride. I have Slytherin so I don’t bloody need you. Have a terrible rest of your life.
“I know, baby. But you have to obliviate me, I need you to be safe.” Draco’s chest ached, he couldn’t speak, he was sure. His throat was filled to the brim with angry tears and it felt like someone was punching him in the stomach over and over and over-
Sincerely,
“Marriage.” Harry finally blurted out, turning red as a tomato. Draco took a step back, hand covering his mouth. He felt tears come to his eyes, and his throat got all thick and choked up, but he managed to convey the message that yes. He absolutely adored the idea of marriage if Harry was also willing.
“Oh, yes I believe he told me that.” Draco wasn’t paying much attention to the conversation, Harry was nowhere to be seen. How odd.
“I can’t tell you everything anymore Luna.” He said softly, trying to say it as gently as possible. She sighed and suddenly she no longer looked 15.
Hermione’s eyes widened, and a smile began to spread across her face. “The wards, I know how to take down the wards in your house Draco.” Well that surely wasn’t what Draco had been expecting.
He blinked. “Really? That’s a thing?”
“Why’d you come in here?” Draco fiddled with his robes to give his hands to something to do.
“Holy shite.” Draco heard Theo mutter.
It was that same day Draco discovered Harry. It was much easier than he had thought it would be. The house had gone quiet and his mother had come to tell him that they were going to a Muggle village to investigate something or other, she had pressed a brief kiss to his hair before shutting his door with a quiet click. The second he sensed everyone had left he flung open every single door he could think of. He went quiet as he heard a quiet rattling from the dungeons. Damn he was stupid. Of course they would keep him in the dungeons. All of a sudden feeling much less sure of himself he crept down the cool stairs, wand aloft.
A few lonely weeks had passed, in which Draco had spent most of the time writing letters to Luna and practicing piano. He should probably have studied more for his Hogwarts classes, but he couldn’t bring himself to open his textbooks in the middle of summer. All of his necessary homework had been finished long ago after all. The only remotely interesting thing that had happened was when his Monster Book of Monsters had tried to eat him, and then his bedroom. Now he was finally going back to Hogwarts where he could see all of the Slytherins, Luna, and no-not Potter. He didn’t want to see Potter. He did not want to see Potter. He merely wanted to spend a Potter free year in which he could enjoy the company of the Slytherins plus one Ravenclaw.
There was someone else in the car. He’d heard thumping above them and nearly sprinted out of the car. He was always easily scared these days. He had been about to leave with the others but then glimpsed a flash of a shoe. Potter’s shoe. Damn it. How did he know what Potter’s shoes looked like?
“Are you mental! We can’t leave him outside!” Ginny yelled. Draco could picture her with her hands on her hips, glaring at Harry. He was glad he wasn’t on the receiving end of that glare.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter.” Draco said, shrugging casually.
Draco Malfoy
“True, I think we’re one step closer to defeating Voldemort now.” Draco flinched at the name. He couldn’t understand how Harry could use it so carelessly, especially considering everything. Then he straightened a little.
Harry stood there. With his box of letters in his hands. His box, filled with letters from over six years, was in Harry Potter’s hands. Except the letters weren’t in the box anymore. They were strewn all over the floor and the couch. Harry was staring at him, eyes wide and mouth parted.
Dear Potter,
Draco smiled and nodded. “Yeah, yeah I bet he will.”
He tried the back door. It swung open easily. He resisted the urge to laugh hysterically.
A couple weeks later the best and worst thing happened to Draco. He ended up in a screaming match with Potter. That wasn’t the best part, although it always made Draco’s blood sing to be
“Thanks.” she said quietly, not sounding at all like her usual self.
“Draco.” He motioned for him to come closer. Harry brought his hands to Draco’s face and pressed a kiss to the top of his head through the bars. Draco shivered and grasped his arm.
Your worst enemy who feels nauseous when they think of you
Sincerely,
She looked at him and smiled a little. “Yeah, we have each other.”
Draco stayed standing, not knowing if it would be appropriate for him to follow.
These days you’re in an even worse mood than I am. You stomp about the whole castle and I fantasize about kissing you until you smile. I arrived at school lonely and angry at my parents, but the time away from them has been helpful actually. But you seem to be determined to stay pissed at the whole entire world. Usually you’re the happiness in my day, so I hope I can become the happiness in yours. Dear Merlin. I’m such a sap. I don’t know what to do with myself but try and get you to smile again. I want you to be happy Potter. And I do think I can make you happy. What am I saying? You hate me, you always have and there’s a good chance you always will. When have I ever given you the idea that I don’t hate your guts? I wish I could give up and find someone else but I don’t know how. You have always been the person who I wish to be with and cherish, I can’t imagine doing that with anyone else. Does that make me a creep? I really hope it doesn’t, I’m not trying to be creepy. I’m no good at this. I suppose I’ll go do homework or something productive now. I hope you feel better soon.
“Draco?” Harry asked, coming into the kitchen of their apartment. They had moved in together a few years back now, and Draco honestly couldn’t have been happier.
It was very quiet for the rest of class.
“Well, Luna er, Potter and I hate each other.” he said slowly. He hadn’t expected her to be happy, in his mind this was an absolute disaster.
Harry said something he didn’t catch, then turned away and ran up the stairs. Ginny inhaled sharply and fell back onto the couch. She landed on top of some letters and grabbed them, then flung them out from under her. Draco sat on an armchair, feeling hollow inside all of a sudden.
“Yeah, I’ll come inside in a second.” he replied, too tired to be embarrassed by the roughness in his voice.
“Well that’s a load of bullshit.” Draco said, thinking about how his father would’ve loved that rule. Wait a minute. Had he actually said that to her face? That was a terrible idea.
Okay perhaps he was being a tad dramatic. Harry was still his boyfriend after all, and being near him made Draco so bubbly he didn’t know how to contain himself. However hiding things from one’s significant other was never an easy task. Draco simply did not want to hide things from Harry. He wished he could share every single detail of his life with him, and he wished Harry to do the same. But he was a death eater. Who would probably be dead quite soon.
“He deserves it. What are you doing here Malfoy? Waiting to see your favorite hippogriff be killed?” He shook his head in disgust. Oh. So it seemed his father hadn’t listened to him. Draco began to shake his head but stopped when he heard the fall of an axe. It felt like a stone had been dropped in the pit of his stomach. Granger clapped a hand to her mouth in horror.
“No, no er-your father wanted me to give you some books.” Snape said quickly, standing and pulling some books from his robes. Snape was always pulling odd things out of his voluminous robes.  He handed Draco the books before nodding at him.
He awoke to a loud banging on the door. He fumbled for his wand and rolled out of bed as fast as he could. He swallowed down a yawn and took a trembling step forward.
With that he swung open the door to the Leaky Cauldron, and stepped out into the Muggle world.
“I’m glad.” she said, pulling him into a hug. He hugged her back, breathing in the scent of her lavender shampoo. All too soon she was gone and Draco was alone again with nothing but an undelivered letter under his pillow, and a lonely feeling in his chest. Draco didn’t write again for months.
“How could you not tell me!” She yelled, gripping her hair in frustration. “I had to think you two were still kidding yourselves, coming to me for advice about the other person, it's been driving me insane!”
“Everything alright with them?” he questioned, hoping he didn’t come off as bloody nosy.
I think you’ve broken a record for the most detentions you’ve managed to collect in the time since we’ve started school. It’s incredible really. I’ve been trying to catch you after class (to say what I have no idea) but you’re always in detention. And whenever you’re not in detention, you’re with her. Cho Chang. I can’t tell if you’re in love with her or if you feel sorry for her. I feel terrible. Cedric cheated on her and then died. Although maybe she didn’t know that he cheated on her. Who knows honestly. But still. And no one is helping this poor girl. She cries all the time for goodness sake! Which makes sense. I wasn’t planning on talking about Cho. I don’t know what the purpose of these letters is. My box is starting to get quite full. I don’t know why I can’t bring myself to throw them away. The old ones are of no use to me after all. They’re merely reminders of everything I wanted and desperately hoped for, that will never come to be. Being in love with your worst enemy is terribly painful. I would say I hope you never have to feel this pain, but I hope you feel just like this every time you look at me.
“WHAT?” He screamed, his voice cracking. His heart began beating even faster and time seemed to slow as Harry began to fall slower. He was eventually lowered to the ground by Dumbledore, who began yelling at the Dementors. Draco couldn’t hear anything as he stared at the motionless figure on the ground. As the dementors started retreating he felt Luna tug on his sleeve.
“What are you doing?” He asked sharply. Draco didn’t reply. He was too busy scanning Harry to make sure he was unhurt. At least visibly. There was a bruise on his face, and he was rather dirty, but other than that he seemed unharmed. Draco blew out a breath.
Draco stuffed the letter into his box as he heard the door knob begin to turn. It must be his father. His mother always knocked. Sure enough his father entered his room, closing the door behind him.
“What’s wrong?” he asked before she could continue.
“Wait by the door. Don’t make a sound.” Severus said in a quiet voice before pulling Draco aside. In a voice so low Draco almost could not hear he said,
“I’m sorry.” she said quietly, looking ashamed. “But I-”
“It’s just me. Luna. Lovegood. The ravenclaw.” Draco heard her draw in a breath.
“Bye Harry.” he whispered back. It was the first time he had called him that to his face. Harry blinked, before a slow smile spread over his face.
Dear Harry
“Right then. Miss?” he asked, trying to wake the sleeping girl. She started and brushed the hair out of her eyes hastily.
Oh. Well he supposed it wouldn’t hurt to tell her. Or maybe it would. Perhaps it wasn’t such a good-
“His aura?”
-G <3
“What’s up with the last part? And bully for him, he’s still an asshole.”
“What-what Severus, why-I’m sorry I don’t really know what you're referring to.”
“Why would you want a…” Potter swallowed.
“So was that all?” Draco asked, scratching behind his ear to give himself something to do.
“Ah well, worth a try but you were a bit obvious-” Weasley said. Granger and Weasley broke into an argument and Draco was puzzled when he heard nothing of Potter. Where had he gone? Surely he was still with them.
“You see when people reach a certain age...they they-”
“Ah, yes.” Came his father’s cool voice. “Someone indeed.”  A bead of cold sweat trickled down his back. He felt nauseated. He had never realized how much he hated his father’s voice. How much he hated his father in general actually.
“I’ll catch up guys, I have to go check something.” Potter muttered.
“Did I just see what I thought I saw?” she asked, shaking her head back and forth. Harry cleared his throat but said nothing. There wasn’t really anything they could say at this point. She had seen them- Draco felt light headed all of a sudden. She had seen them holding each other close and smiling, like lovers. Except that wasn’t what they were. At least not right now because she had interrupted them.
Footsteps sounded up the stairs and Draco stuffed the letter under his pillow. A knock sounded on his door.
“You really think so?” Even in the dark Draco could see a blush rising to her cheeks.
“You can’t attack him, you'll get detention!” Granger yelled worriedly. She glanced at Draco and an odd expression came over her face before she turned back to Weasley.
“I am.” Draco said.
Dear Potter,
Sincerely,
“Mate I bet we won the cup again!” Weasley was saying, nudging Harry.
“Luna, is she okay? Have you found everyone?”
“Right, probably best. Lead the way.” He motioned stiffly towards the door. The pair of them made to leave but stopped when a figure barrowled past. Draco’s heart faltered in his chest. That had looked a lot like-
I didn’t see you in Diagon alley as I had hoped. But I did meet this boy who I think we should be friends with. He was all alone, besides from the gamekeeper I believe, and I’m sure we would make a rather good trio. I hope I’m not getting ahead of myself but I really do think you two would get on nicely. Sadly I must end this letter early, father wants to tell me something. But I will definitely see you soon. I hope you are as excited as I am.
Ginny and Luna were the first to get married, the both of them only 20 years of age. Molly was apprehensive at first, but after a gorgeous wedding on the beach (with lots of crying mind you) she hugged both of them and gave them a very large pile of sweaters. Draco gave them a seashell bookshelf which the two of them absolutely adored. Harry, Ron, and Hermione gave them a huge tapestry of all of them, arms around each other, with huge smiles on their faces. Ginny burst into tears when she saw it.
Draco placed the letter with the others and hurriedly slid it under his bed. He glared at Severus’s owl as it continued to fix him with it’s intense stare.
Lucius surveyed his son before saying, “Thank you Draco.”
“Draco…” Pansy groaned and flung herself into the seat next to Theo.
“So, I think I like you.” It took a shit ton of self control for Draco to not scream and jump up and down. He wanted to fling himself into Potter’s arms and cry. Harry Potter liked him.
“Right, yes. Anyway.” He gripped the coin in his pocket and rubbed it like Hermione had taught him to.
“What?” In a sharp tone. Draco held back a flinch. The idea of embracing seemed very far away now.
“I can help you, we’ll make it work.”
“Guys!” He called, his voice high and panicked. Normally he would’ve tried to be the calm one in this situation, but the fact that Hermione was bleeding out on the couch and he had no idea how to help her was scaring the shite out of him.
“Wha-No, Luna. I can’t ask Harry Potter to dance with me!” He said, his eyes widening.
“Nothing.” Draco nodded sarcastically.
Draco blinked. This was the most upset he had ever seen Luna. He took a slow breath.
“This way.” Draco said roughly, pushing aside Bellatrix to lead them out of the corridor. Now what should he do? Severus wasn’t here, Hermione hadn’t given him any sort of sign she had alerted Dumbledore, and now he was leading a horde of Death Eaters through Hogwarts. Draco’s insides felt frozen, this really had been a bullshit idea. He decided to take them out to the grounds, through a back door not many people often went by.
Draco <3
“Something wrong?” asked Theo, who was watching him read the letter. Draco threw down the letter in frustration.
“You’re crying.” she repeated, her mouth open slightly as she looked from him to Harry and Weasley retreating down the corridor.
“You can’t do this Draco, the dark lord-”
Draco (Your maybe boyfriend?)
Luna frowned and followed her gaze. “I guess not...She should be up by now it’s past eight.”
“That’s great Harry!” Granger said enthusiastically. She already had a stack of pillows on her desk. Potter gave him a sideways glance.
“And?” His heart was pounding and his stomach swirled in excitement.
“Harry! Harry stop, we're right here!” Hermione ran after him, giving up completely on the pretense of being quiet. He hurried after her, feeling his insides already begin to heat up. Now was the worst possible moment for him to feel all tingly and mushy inside. He nearly crashed into Granger as he left the room, she was gripping Harry’s shoulders and shaking him slightly.
“Okay...you’re sure everything is fine?”
“Are you okay Draco?” Pansy asked, a tinge of worry in her voice.
Okay. So maybe that was fair. He didn’t know much about the dark lord because his parents had always tried to shield him from that part of their lives. And Draco was very glad for that. But now...he was back and there would be no shielding Draco from any of that. He wasn’t stupid. He knew soon enough he would see the dark lord.
Dear Harry,
Er-not quite. He was a very bizarre mix of devastated, worried, and blissfully happy. He settled for a nod, not really trusting himself to speak. Her brows furrowed together, as if she was thinking very hard.
Severus blinked, the only surprise he ever showed.
“Yeah well, he’s also the reason I was there in the first place.” Harry replied darkly, curling his hands into fists. Draco couldn’t breathe. He was right after all.
“Sorry.” he said in such a low tone Draco almost didn’t hear him.
“Er.” Draco glanced down at the titles. “Right.”
He did his best to carry her over to the couch without jostling her further. She was muttering something, but he couldn’t understand a word she was saying. Okay, okay, okay. Draco didn’t know what to do. He was shite at healing spells. And his hands were shaking so hard he didn’t trust himself to do it. He turned to go get Ginny or Luna but a hand on his arm stopped him.
“Harry-no, no Potter.” he blurted. He could feel himself flush, despite the cold.
“Grimmauld place.” Draco leaned back in his chair, trying to ignore the panic rising in his chest. He wasn’t sure what about the place made him quite so apprehensive. Perhaps the memory of his mother going there every year and coming back dejected, telling him about how the house hadn’t let her in, had tainted his feelings towards the place. He never understood why she kept going back there. She had hated Sirius, he thought. His mother had always wrinkled her nose at the mention of him. Yet every fall she had gone back, eyes bright when she returned. Once his father had told him about Walburga Black. The mother of Sirius and Regulus Black. Draco did not wish to relive that conversation. He had a vivid memory of feeling sick afterward. The story had left an awful aftertaste in his mouth. Thankfully his father had never repeated the story, or told anymore details of it. Draco was fairly sure his father admired their mother just a smidge.
“Sorry, I’ve just been doing a lot of thinking lately.” She frowned and tilted her head.
“What if…” She trailed off, the words too terrible to leave her lips.
“Ron! Ron, stop it, we’re going to get in trouble!” The laughter subsided and Draco snapped his wand out and was prepared to jinx Weasley with the same curse when Professor Moody came running, his wand raised as well.
Omg look how fast I wrote this. This isn't really anything just a bunch of fluff I stuck at the end but I hope you enjoy anyway LOL.
“Er, yes...that’s Ginevra.”
“It means, your friends, don’t like me and find ways to drive me insane.”
“Care for a dance?” Draco held his hand out to Luna.
“Really, do you think he’ll be gone soon?” Harry shrugged and sighed.
“Worse?” Severus raised his eyebrows at him.
“He wouldn’t have gone with you willingly.” Severus said tonelessly.
Draco leaned in, not even thinking anymore, only knowing that Potter’s lips were mere inches away from his now and with a single second he could part them.
“No, no I don’t want to intrude.”
“Is that the…” Harry trailed off in horror, head shaking quickly. “No, no it’s fake right. You're not actually one of them?” Draco didn’t know what to say, he yanked his arm out of Harry’s grasp and pushed his sleeve down. Tears were already springing to his eyes, and his heart was cold with horror.
“Why not?” she asked, rolling her eyes.
Dear Potter,
“No.”
It hadn’t been his idea. He had just been trying to keep his head down and get on with his studies for the first few months of school. And he’d been doing a fairly good job of it as well in his opinion. But then one day Blaise heard that Weasley was on the Gryffindor team. So he wrote a song. Pansy had actually cried with laughter the first time she had heard it. The song was hilarious, he had to admit it. Though he knew the second Potter heard the song he would blame him. Because everyone thought that he was the one who came up with all the terrible schemes the Slytherins pulled half the time. It was getting rather annoying.
She smiled shyly. “Have a nice time.”
“Give it a few minutes, then we can talk.” Leaning back in her seat she began to chatter on about random meaningless things. Some fake job (he assumed), getting her drivers license finally, classes she was going to register for this coming fall. Draco could hardly follow a word of what she was saying. He really should’ve taken Muggle studies. After a waitress came for their orders, the pair of them ordered cappuccinos, and Draco raised the steaming liquid to his lips. He nearly choked as the piping hot coffee ran down his throat and through his chest.
“It’s not me, it’s you.”
“My fault, Madam.” Luna piped up after a moment. “I thought I saw a rat, they scare me quite a bit you see. But it was just Draco’s shoe.” She blinked a few times and tried a smile.
“I have not!’ He gasped, but he was smiling. Then his smile faltered a little. “What do you mean you think Theo likes me?”
“I don’t think anyone really thought about how hard it was. She was only 11, she didn’t know what was happening.” Luna shook her head, and to Draco’s surprise anger flashed in her eyes. “I can’t believe no one noticed. An adult I mean.”
“Fuck.”
“No, no I don’t think so.” he said stiffly, doing his best not to give anything away. Luna gave him a suspicious look but the champions began entering the room and the other students were herded to the sides. Draco did his best to breathe properly as he watched Potter walk with Patil. Luna looked equally flustered beside him. She was gazing at Ginny who was directly across from them. When the music began Draco realized something. Potter was an absolutely terrible dancer. It was shockingly embarrassing just how terrible he was at dancing. Had he even practiced at all?
“You can’t?” Was the only thing that came out of his mouth. And damn him. He sounded hopeful. Because he was damnit. He was so hopeful that Potter had actually enjoyed the kiss.
I hope you’re having a dreadful summer. Mine has been incredibly boring. I’ve been sending letters back and forth with Luna over the summer, and honestly she’s much nicer to talk to than you. I mean you don’t even write back. To be fair I haven’t sent any of my letters, but I’m sure even if I did send them you still wouldn’t reply. We hate each other, as you are well aware. So there is no reason for us to talk to each other outside of our extreme hatred induced battles. It’s not like I’m actually talking to you right now. I’m basically talking to myself but pretending to talk to you if that makes any sort of sense. Not that I care if it makes sense to you. In fact I hope this letter properly confuses you beyond belief and you can make no sense of it whatsoever. I hope you’re so bloody confused you miss the train and end up getting run over by a muggle car on the way back to your aunt and uncle's house. Anyway, I’ve been so bored this summer that I have no other options but to write to you, as has become tradition. My father seems to be on the edge lately. More so than usual. And he and my mother are always whispering about something or other. Oh, and didn’t you hear? Sirius Black broke out of Azkaban! That’s bloody brilliant if you ask me. Although my mother doesn’t seem to think so. She’s related to him you see. Not that you care, but she has been very troubled by his escape. Can’t imagine why. Well I suppose I should stop writing now as it is time for tea. Goodbye Potter.
“I believe I am, whether you want me to or not.”
Sincerely
Hermione turned red but continued hastily. “You say Voldemort was awfully fond of storing his soul in things of old value. Like pureblood relics and such.” She nodded at Harry eagerly.
Draco
“Don’t say that.” She shook her head. “It wasn’t a mistake and you know it.” Draco didn’t know what to say to that so he didn’t say anything. After a beat she placed her head gently on his shoulder.
It is my assumption that one of you will end up reading this, as both of you are my two most clever students. I am taking a huge risk in giving you this letter, so please do me the courtesy of reading it quite thoroughly and disposing of it properly. I understand that what I have done paints me in the worst of the light, however I ask that you listen fully to what I have to say. I am still a spy, and I intend to play my part till the very end. Albus Dumbledore was already dying when he asked me to kill him, he wanted me to take the part of Draco, who was intended to go through with the deed. I did as he asked and fled with the other death eaters. I will soon be the new Headmaster of Hogwarts, and I shall do my best to protect what students I can. Do not return, although I know you aren’t stupid enough to even consider it. Help Potter escape is all I can ask of you two. And whomever else you have happened to drag along. I cannot give too much away in this letter, save it be taken by the wrong people. However I can tell you that I Will not Ask much moRe of you than this. You are Decidedly Still children, after all. Take care of yourselves.
Dear Potter,
This summer has been the worst of my 15 years. My birthday was a few days ago and my father wasn’t even around. My mother and I sat quietly in the dining room and had a conversation about the dark lord. Sure brought down the mood quite a bit. She told me the responsibilities my father now held, and that he wouldn’t be around much anymore. I easily could’ve imagined it, but I thought she seemed rather angry during the majority of our conversation. Not that I blame her. I’m quite angry with my father as well. I don’t understand why he had to return to the service of the dark lord. Our lives certainly would’ve been much better if we no longer had to associate with him. Perhaps if the dark lord had never rose to power in the first place, you and I could’ve been friends. We could’ve been friends and eventually maybe more. I’m well aware I’m a lovestruck idiot, I can’t even focus on the dark lord for Merlin’s sake. Somehow my mind always seems to wander back to you. To be honest you’re the only thing that’s been keeping me sane most days. You’re not even here but it’s comforting knowing that once we go back to school we can argue once more. While we’re apart it’s nice to imagine that when we see each other we will greet each other with an embrace and then a kiss. I know it’s far more likely you or one of your friends will punch me in the face, but I like to dream. I should probably go. I’ve been in my room for several hours now hiding from my father. I guess I’ll see or write to you later Potter.
“Yeah, I suppose I’ll come.”
“You’re supposed to be the positive one.” he protested. She stared at him with a grim expression on her face.
It’s risky of me to send this. But when haven’t I been doing insanely risky things in the past couple weeks? I’m sorry I chastised you for sending me a letter. I understand now that you were desperate, as I am now. It’s not so much that I am in need of your help, actually I think we’re making excellent progress at the moment. It’s that, well, I need someone to talk to. I used to think we had nothing in common, though clearly I was sorely mistaken. I realized how much you were keeping to yourself for years, and I wish I had been there for you to confide in. I know you haven’t agreed to be my listening ear, but I am going to ask you too anyway. I’m so fucking lonely Draco. I don’t know what’s happening to me. I didn’t tell you this, but I obliviated my parents, so they would be safe. Very similar to what happened with you and Harry. I can’t really tell anyone else this because they won’t understand. They can be sympathetic of course, yet no one will really know the agony that everyday life has become. I tried to be a good daughter. However something says I just messed up everything even more. If my parents ever do get their memories back, will they even love me anymore? I took everything from them, how could they ever forgive me? This, this is the reason I can’t stop doing dangerous things. Because what does all of it matter anymore? Some days I feel so much I can’t breathe, and most days I feel nothing at all. I feel nothing, and then I feel everything. I don’t think I’m doing well, Draco. But I don’t get to complain. My parents are safe, and at the moment so am I. That’s enough feeling sorry for myself for now. How are you faring? You lot are safe right? Don’t try to meet up with us, I think we’ve decided it’s best to split up so we can get horcruxes killed faster. I believe Ron is going to meet up with us soon. I’m rather excited about that. Even though you haven’t replied yet I do feel a bit better. Just knowing you’re reading this brings me quite a bit of comfort. You’re a good friend Draco, and for what it’s worth, you were a really good boyfriend to Harry too. Take care of yourself.
“And don’t forget to finish your potions essay.” Snape reminded him, snapping back into his usual self.
“Hey at least we’re in this together.” Theo said, not quite looking at him. Draco had a feeling they weren’t quite in this together, as they had barely spoken in months since that kiss.
“What are you doing?” You asked, shaking your head wildly back and forth. I woke up after that. I hate myself. I thought I said we were going to move on. Why do I keep forcing myself to relieve these moments? I don’t want to remember. Actually moving on now, my apologies. I have a better plan now. Last night my owl, Ulysses, flew into the room I’m staying in. I sent a letter with him, one addressed to Hermione Granger. I know how incredibly risky it is to send letters nowadays, but he’s the smartest owl out there. He knows to keep to the skies until he gets there. I asked Hermione if she could give me some clues to the Order location, or hell, just somewhere we can meet up. So that I can tell her everything and we can formulate some kind of plan to break you out. This has to work. It is going to work. While I wait for her response I’m going to be staying in Muggle London. Some absurd part of me is rather excited. Father never let me go to Muggle London. Said it was dirty. Obviously now I know that’s not true, he was being stupid and closed minded as usual. Yet this small act of defiance he will never witness has my heart pounding. I can’t wait to go walk the streets and shite Potter, maybe I’ll even eat in one of those cafes. Oops. I’ve been writing for nearly half an hour. I meant to leave 15 minutes ago. Damn. I better be off now then. I wish you all the best.
“Draco, sir. My name is Draco.” He left out the Malfoy part, save someone decided to kidnap him by recognition of it.
“Well, just focus on getting better.” He almost said that it was fine, but it wasn’t. Not in the slightest.
“Alright then, tell me about the wards.”
“That must’ve been fucking scary.” He replied. Not for the first time Draco wished he was better at comforting people.
The barkeeper startled at the loud thump the door made as it shut. Draco held in a flinch.
“Hello Draco.” Snape said grimly. He looked so solemn Draco worried for a moment if someone had died.
“Hi.” Draco replied, placing his hand on the back of Harry’s neck. He shivered a little and leaned closer. Their lips brushed softly, Draco opened his mouth to allow their tongues to sweep together delightfully. All the worry in his stomach vanished as Harry pulled back, grinned, and took his hand.
“Lies!” Draco attempted to wrangle himself out of Filch's grasp but he held on tight.
“Er-is everything all right?” Draco asked slowly.
“Don’t think about that.” Harry said hastily with a shake of his head. “We can’t get through this if we’re worrying about-that.”
“Nothing really. I was just thinking about…” He trailed off and there was silence once more.
Hello there! This chapter is very very VERY long. I was actually thinking about splitting it into two but by then I was almost done so I was like whatever it's fine. Anyway that's not relevant because we're almost at the end of this story. After this chapter there's going to be an epilogue which will probably be out in a week or less. I've had sooon much fun writing this story and I definitely have plans for new fics in the new future. Okay have fun reading!
“Er-”
“Hello?” Came a shaky voice. Draco nearly fell to his knees. In hindsight it shouldn’t have shaken him so much. He hadn’t been gone that long. Yet something in Harry’s voice caused something in Draco to unravel.
“Well my grades are lower than Granger’s and my father is upset so I thought-”
“QUIET!” Madam Pince yelled from somewhere. Oops.
“Of course.” She put her hand in his and together they walked onto the dance floor. The rest of the night was nice. Until Luna left to go dance with Ginny. That wasn’t what made the night turn sour. In fact the two of them were adorable, giggling on the dance floor. Things really started to go wrong when Weasley came out of nowhere and yanked Draco behind a pillar.
“I don’t know. Luna must be rubbing off on me. Fuck I miss her.” Ginny set down her mug with a clack and sighed dramatically.
She wet her lips. “That’s interesting. I was so sure he was on our side before he killed Dumbledore...It just doesn’t make sense how he could possibly play both sides like that.” She groaned and buried her face in her hands. “Nevermind him. We can discuss Snape later, he’s much too confusing.” She raised her head and stared him right in the eye. Draco was the smallest bit afraid. Something about the look in her eyes made him want to run the other direction.
“He’s complicated.” Draco finally said. Harry shrugged,
“Er, yeah.” Potter said sheepishly. He was turning red and Draco found that extremely adorable. Shite. He was losing it again.
“Because you have to be careful, you don’t know what the dark lord is capable of.”
Draco swept his eyes over the shop and his eyes settled over the old magic wardrobe. This was the same one Montague had disappeared through, right?
“Thank you. You too.” He swallowed hard and hoped he didn’t look half as terrified as he felt.
“Sit, both of you.” Severus said in a low tone. Heart beating wildly he took a seat next to Harry.
“Oh Draco, I’m sure he likes you too. I see the way he’s always watching you. Ginevra was telling me he’s practically obsessed with you and this is just so perfect there are no other words for me to say!” To Draco’s dismay her eyes were shining with tears of what he could only assume was happiness.
Despite all of Harry’s reassurances, Draco’s stomach was twisted into fierce knots when it was time to return to school. He awoke much too early with a feeling of dread buried in the pit of his stomach. Harry was with the Weasley’s at the moment, so he was alone with his mother in the Mansion. Miraculously, she had escaped with only a house arrest for a couple months, and Draco had only been put on a two years probation. His father however, was in Azkaban for life. Draco couldn’t be happier about that. In the months since the war had ended life had been a blur for everyone. Draco had been to trial after trial, always with Harry at his side. He had met Teddy, who was still an adorable little bundle that only spoke in small whimpers and loud cries, but he loved him nonetheless.
Harry blinked a few times. “No offense or anything, Malfoy, but I really don’t trust you.”
“Draco.” He said softly, not even bothering to look up.
“Good job Hermione.” Luna said softly, playing with a strand of her hair. “But why didn’t you wait for us to get up?” Draco turned to look at Hermione. He wanted to know the same thing. She had scared them all to death for Merlin’s sake.
“Yes, yes she’s doing alright. She’s in the hospital wing, you can go see her.” He frowned.
“What do you want?” Draco asked. His voice shook and his father laughed, shaking his head.
“No, no I’m perfectly well.” he shook himself. “Want to go to breakfast?”
“Hey.” she said darkly, and crossed her arms.
Draco nearly spit out his coffee and proceeded to spend the next two minutes choking on it. “How-how-” he sputtered.
“Flying I guess.” Harry closed his eyes again and took another breath. Draco tried to breathe normally as well.
I'm back! Thank you so much to everyone who left kudos it made me so happy! The first couple chapters are probably going to be pretty short, but starting at year 4 I think they're going to get rather long. Just a heads up. Anyway, thank you so much for reading ;)
“Alright. Yes, that’s enough I believe you. Here.” He unlocked the door with a wave of his wand and he faced Hermione Granger. It hadn’t been long since he had last seen her, yet she looked incredibly different. Her eyes had dark circles under them, almost like they were bruised, and her face had that hollow, sunken look of someone who had not been eating. Draco blinked.
After a few very long and boring weeks Draco’s father barged into his room with a scarily excited expression on his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had seen his father this excited. Or excited at all really. It was very concerning.
You truly are a complete disturbance to this entire school. A flying car? The train isn’t good enough for you and your bloody sidekick? Ugh. I was disgusted when Theo told me all about your adventure. I have to admit, I was rather worried when you didn’t come to the feast. As you are well aware, I hate you, but I do need you to be my enemy. Sorry, I’m getting off topic. You’re an idiot. It amazes me that school has barely even begun and you have already injured a magnificent piece of school property. Okay the whomping willow isn’t that magnificent, it scares me to be perfectly truthful, but still. You damaged school property before your first class. That has to be a record. Well I only needed to tell you that I loathe you and you are a danger to this entire institution.
A couple weeks later Mcgonagall announced in Transfiguration that there was going to be a ball at Hogwarts. The Yule Ball apparently. Draco wasn’t really looking forward to this. His father had already owled him and told him to go with Pansy or Millicent, as they had been bred from “good” families. However Draco had no intention of going with either of them. Pansy and Millicent were like sisters to him. He knew who he actually wanted to go with. But that was certainly not an option. So he did his best to shake the ludicrous idea out of his head.
“Oh, er-yes of course.” Draco didn’t mention that he had no bloody idea how to make coffee. He’d never even watched someone do it. The two girls left the room and Draco wandered into the kitchen, feeling discouraged. He was useless. Merlin he couldn’t even make coffee. How was he going to help rescue Harry when he couldn’t even get them energized to do so? Draco began opening random drawers, hoping he would find coffee beans. Or grounds. Did one have to ground coffee beans before they made them into coffee? Could he perhaps get away with transfigurating water into coffee? Draco was contemplating doing just that when Ginny and Luna sprinted back into the room, their eyes wide with fear.
“To bring back favor, for our family. And you need to take the dark mark, so the dark lord knows he can trust you.” Draco thought he had known terror before, but nothing compared to the way his stomach plummeted in this instance. His chest grew tight at the look on his mother’s face. What would happen to her if he didn’t take it and carry out the dark lord’s plan?
“Whose dead Harry?” Hermione tried to get him to come into the classroom they had just left, but he tugged his arm out of her grip. He was shaking, Draco realized. His hands were clenching and unclenching and he continued to rub his nails against the skin of his thumbs.
“I’ll get her some water for when she wakes up.” Ginny said, turning on her heel and practically sprinting out of the room. Draco pressed the towel to Hermione’s side as gently as he could.
Draco Malfoy
“This has been the most boring ride ever and the train hasn’t even started moving.” She glared at Granger and Weasley, and he had a feeling there was more to it than that. No one said anything for the majority of the ride, only to decide which pair would go next to patrol the corridors. After a very long two hours the head boy and girl came in to tell them that they could go find their friends now. Immediately Granger and Weasley practically sprinted out of the car. Draco and Pansy raised their eyebrows at each other. That was odd. Odder than usual anyway. They wandered out of the car and looked around for the rest of their friends. They found the car with Theo and Blaise, but Luna was nowhere in sight.
“Spare me, come on then.” He dragged Draco towards a lighted room down the corridor, and all too late Draco realized they were headed straight into Slughorn's party. Where Harry was, where Luna was, and Merlin knew who else was there. He blinked as he was pushed into the loud and brightly lit room. His eyes immediately began searching for Harry’s, he found Granger’s instead. Her eyes widened when she saw him, and she ducked away immediately.
Everyone stared at her for a beat before Harry began nodding, a smile gracing his features.
Smiling and blushing a faint pink, Draco set down the letter and picked up the one from Theo. His insides squirmed with worry, he hoped Theo wasn’t writing because something was wrong.
“Don’t worry though.” For a moment Draco thought Harry was going to say something else. He was biting his lip, not meeting Draco’s eyes. Instead they settled into a silence and Draco moved even closer so that he could rest his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry laughed a little and put his arm around Draco, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. Draco smiled into Harry’s shoulder and rubbed his nose lightly against it. He was going to say something about how blissfully happy he was, but his eyes were drooping and the words grew heavy on his tongue. Before he knew it he had faded away into sleep and so had Harry.
A few days after school started Draco had his first class of Umbridge. It was an absolute nightmare. By then the tale had already spread through the school about Potter’s showdown with Umbridge in the middle of class. Draco wished he had been there to see it. Although from the rumors he hadn’t quite grasped how terrible she was. No one had mentioned her large bulging eyes that never seemed to blink. Draco sat with Pansy, Theo, and Blaise as usual. The first half of class she told them to read from the textbooks, which they did. Until one of the Hufflepuffs asked a question about defending themselves. It was Hannah Abott.
Her face softened slightly. “He’s a bit stupid at times, I will admit. He’s not really ready to accept that you hid all this for a good reason I’m sure. For a while I thought you were actually loyal to Voldemort, but after I did some thinking I realized that couldn’t be right.” She shook her head and began pacing.
“I-Yeah, alright.” Maybe if he was lucky he wouldn’t get sent to Azkaban. But perhaps he deserved it for causing this mess.
“Exactly what don’t I understand Mr. Potter.” said Snape in a low voice.
“Go on then.” She nodded upstairs. The shower was off now, and he could hear Harry moving around in the room upstairs.
“Oh bloody hell, come on you two.” Luna swung her book bag over her shoulder and dragged Draco by the hand, motioning Harry to follow them out of the library. She tugged Draco into an abandoned classroom and waited impatiently for Harry to enter. She kicked the door shut and turned to face them.
“Single handed, right?” Wait, oh shit. That hadn’t come out right.
Your friend Draco
Draco
She waited for a moment before responding. “I knew you would say that.”
“Fucking Ron.” She muttered under her breath. Damn. She must be really pissed at the Weasel. Draco shared her sentiment. She yanked her shoes off angrily and rubbed at her eyes with her forearm. Draco turned to leave but Granger stopped him.
Luna was silent for a little while before she responded. She had finally worked Hermione’s shirt off and crumpled it into a ball, tossing it aside. It wasn’t until the blood flow had finally slowed down that she spoke again. She muttered an incantation and bandages sprung from her wand and wrapped themselves gently around the wound. She sat back on her heels and sighed.
Frown lines gathered on her forehead and she didn’t respond for several seconds.
Sincerely,
“Oh dear Merlin.” Tonks rolled her eyes and stormed the other way. Draco bit back another smile and followed them out of the train. As they were walking Draco wondered if he could hold Potter’s hand. Was that okay? Why did Tonks have to come right when they had been about to figure things out? And, what was going to happen to them now?
She swallowed and turned to go into the kitchen. “I just thought it would be better to get a head start on things.”
“I love you too.” He laid his head against the bars and let Harry brush the hair gently out of his eyes. He let himself feel Harry’s cold hand against his sweaty one, and their foreheads now pressed together. His heart rate began to slow as Harry rubbed slow circles across the back of his thumb. Draco stepped back and raised his wand. He closed his eyes, thought about running back up the stairs and out the door. But that wouldn’t do anyone any favors. The incantation left his lips and he opened his eyes to find Harry’s confused ones staring back at him. He bolted up the stairs and to his room. He grabbed a vase from his bedside table and threw it at the wall. He watched as the glass shattered and the tiny broken pieces were flung all over the room. He screamed along with it.
“Fine. Whatever, come along then. You can carry him, I have this.” He held up the bag of potions. Severus raised an eyebrow.
“But-”
Hermione Granger
“Er-sorry, about that.” He shrugged and went to take another cup out of the cabinet.
“I know.” she said lightly. “And I think you will be.”
Dear Potter,
“Now, if that’s alright.” She said quietly, not meeting his eyes. Draco guessed he didn’t have much of a choice.
“It’s fine, I’ll get over it. See you around I guess.” Theo pushed past him about to leave but Draco quickly said,
“Yeah but it was probably a mistake.” he shrugged and blinked very quickly.
Sincerely,
Draco Malfoy who is slightly panicking but also very happy
I don’t know what to do. You haven’t looked at me in eight very long days. We haven’t spoken a single word to each other and I don’t know if that’s good or bad. My emotions are a wreck these days and it’s all your fault. Some moments I’m practically giddy because, well, you know. And other days I cry and scream into my pillow because I want to be your boyfriend so badly. And we both know that can never happen. We’re supposed to be worst enemies. And here I am, completely and utterly in love with someone who is incredibly confusing and clearly doesn’t know how to communicate very well. I don’t want to wallow anymore, so I’m going to go and try to do some homework.
“Fine.” Draco snapped, turning around and walking down the hall. He knew he shouldn’t be annoyed with Luna. He should be happy that she was getting along with Ginevra. He wanted her to be happy but he had always assumed that he was enough of a friend to make her happy. It was absurd, he knew it. Luna could have as many friends as she wanted. But what if he was no longer the friend she went to for advice? What if she no longer wanted to spend time listening to him drone on about Potter? Stopping suddenly he drew in a sharp breath. There in the train car was Potter, Granger, Weasley, Longbottom, Ginevra, and...Luna. She was laughing at something, and showing Ginevra the Quibbler with a brilliant smile on her face. And Potter was there, laughing along with her. It felt as though he had been punched in the stomach. Without thinking Draco flung open the door. Everyone stopped talking and turned to look at him. Potter blinked, and Luna looked horrified. She opened her mouth as if to say something but Potter said,
“Is it true? Is he really staying at your house?” she asked in a hoarse whisper. Draco stiffened, then nodded quickly.
Draco
“No, no, it’s fine. It will just make things worse.” He shut his mouth in horror. He hadn’t meant to say that.
Dear Potter,
“GONE!” Draco yelled, in the chaos no one heard him. There was so much screaming around him it caused Draco’s head to feel distant. He felt as if he was watching the scene from another body. There was a ripple going through the crowd. The words he’s back passed from person to person.
All the Death Eaters began laughing to themselves before Severus hissed at them to be quiet, they were nearing the castle once more.
You have officially driven me to the brink of insanity. Every time I pass by you my heart nearly shoots out of my chest. Even thinking of you makes my stomach swirl. It’s getting ridiculous. I do not understand why I cannot get you out of my head. I did not expect this to stay with me, I thought over the summer it would fade. Clearly, it hasn’t. I was watching you in Potions today (not in a creepy way I swear), and I couldn’t help but notice that you kept pressing a hand to your scar. I was wondering what that was about? Do you think it has something to do with Voldemort? I hope not but I don’t really know anything anymore. I better finish my Potions essay, it’s due in a few hours.
“No! Stay there.” Luna shook her head frantically and grabbed her hand. “You can’t move, you’ll start bleeding again.”
“Thanks for the room.” he said awkwardly, standing by the door. Tom nodded at him, pinching his brows together.
He smiled back at her. “You haven’t made any friends in Ravenclaw?”
“Now Severus,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Don’t be too hard-”
“We’ll see each other after.” Draco prayed his tone was reassuring. And that it wasn’t a lie.
Sincerely,
Most days I can pretend I didn't obliviate you. Then Luna and Ginny start making out. Every damn time I see them it reminds me of you and I. All the kisses, the hugs, even though there weren’t that many to begin with. Every single one was special to me. I don’t think I can ever forget any of them. I thought that I would be able to let you go. And now that I’m actually thinking it through, I don’t know how that’s even a possibility. I mean fuck, I’ve basically been in love with you since third year. And two years before that I was already obsessed with you. You’ve been such a large part of my life for so long, I literally can’t imagine what it would be like for you to be gone. Well, I can. But then I experience chest pain, I can’t breathe anymore, I start wheezing, I’m sure it’s terrifying to watch. Although this doesn’t just happen when I think about you, so I don’t really know what is causing this strange experience. It’s not that important right now. What I mean to say is, I don’t know how I’m supposed to act when we rescue you. (That’s right, I said it. When.) I don’t know how well a job I did obliviating you, I can only guess that I did well enough to erase all your memories of me. But how am I supposed to pretend nothing happened? How am I supposed to act like another one of your friends? I don’t know what to do. I’m half terrified I’ll start bawling the moment we break you out. Merlin, just thinking about seeing you alive has my eyes welling with tears. I best go before I start crying and Luna comes in. She’s always very keen to talk about feelings for some reason. I hope I see you soon, even though I don’t know how I’ll react quite yet.
“I should go. And so should you.” Potter said quietly, nodding at Ms. Norris. Draco blinked quickly.
There’s not much for me to write here anymore. Now I can talk to you whenever I like and I know you’re always going to listen. I suppose this is going to be the end of my letters. I thought I would be more sad but I’m not really. We’re going to spend the next year at Hogwarts together, and honestly, I couldn’t want anything more than that. So I’m going to leave it here. I love you. A fucking ton.
“I’m so sorry Theo.” Draco said. What else could he say?
“What can I get you?” she asked them.
“Alright then. Draco.” He stuck out his hand before he could think twice about it. She grinned and huffed a short laugh before shaking his hand.
He rapidly blinked back tears of his own. “It’s a long story, but our mail was being watched.”
“Did you see what’s out there?” Pansy asked.
“Merlin.” She groaned, burying her head in her arms and laying her head down on the table. “Spare me, it’s too early for this conversation.”
“It’s okay. You can sit with us.” Draco said, sliding over to make room for her.
“Hey I know. I know this is real.” He said quickly, not wanting her to start going off on a louder tangent and attract more people’s attention.
“Keep your voice down, do you want someone to hear?” Severus said, looking very annoyed now.
“Draco?” his godfather’s voice asked. Draco started. He had fallen asleep draped over this chair. He opened his eyes, blinking the sleepiness out of them.
Sincerely,
“...I don’t bloody care, help me! I’m not equipped for this sort of thing!” Ginny’s voice came through the pool of his own thoughts.
“I’m not. Down. Not at all. This is me being happy.” He tried a smile but was sure he only succeeded in looking constipated.
“Well…” Draco placed his free hand on Potter’s face, feeling brave. “I think so as well.”
“Okay, think of something calm.”
“Of course.” he said, wondering, not for the first time, what exactly was going on with his parents.
“Bloody prick, insulting us.”
“I am sorry. Really Theo, I didn’t want to hurt you.” Draco glanced at Theo who was determinedly not looking at him.
Dear Potter,
“Do you hear that?” he asked her slowly.
He came across Harry sitting by the lake by himself. The sun was setting and dinner was already over. Draco didn’t say anything. He just sat next to Harry while he cried. It was dark when his shoulders finally stopped shaking. The night was clear and all the stars were bright, it felt like they were mocking him. It would probably be terribly inappropriate to kiss him after he had been crying. So Draco wiped the last tears from his cheeks and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. And that was enough.
Dear Potter,
“It will be, we’ll make sure of it. We’ll be so careful no one will know I swear.” Draco said, nodding his head.
“You look worried. And I’m fine, I found my shoes but they don’t seem to fit anymore.” she replied.
“I was able to place a tracking spell on your owl. That was stupid what you did, sending me a letter. You’re lucky I’m the one who found it.” She shook her head and brushed past him.
“What?” Draco looked at her in alarm.
“You shouldn’t change the subject.” she said sadly. Great. Now he felt guilty.
“Over here is good.” She pointed a finger towards a booth in the back. The cafe was empty, with only a few people scattered about here and there. They sat and Hermione leaned forward to whisper,
Sincerely,
Draco perked up. “Oh...he is?”
“We’re not there yet, are we?” Pansy asked, her voice shaking slightly.
“You walked!” Ginny was turning a bright angry red now.
Draco
“Nevermind.” She said, probably noticing his pained expression. “It doesn’t matter right now. We shouldn’t be standing in the middle of the street.” She jerked her head and pointed towards a small building, with fading bricks. “We’re here.”
“Why’d you do that Malfoy?” Potter asked angrily. Oh. So Potter wanted to fight with him. How nice.
Sincerely,
“Yes, yes I believe we both know that.” she said. Draco heard her stifle a laugh.
“Here’s what we’re going to do.” He blinked in surprise, a small kernel of hope growing in his chest.
The rest of the story came tumbling from his lips after. Every last bit of it. He knew he was putting her in danger by telling her nearly everything. But once he began talking he couldn’t stop. The words were flowing out of him, he hadn’t realized how desperately he needed to talk about this.
“What does it matter now?”
“Er-I was studying late, lost track of time I needed an excuse-”
He gave the letter to a school owl and drew in a long breath. Hopefully his father listened to him for once. He was going to head to dinner but three sprinting figures distracted him. Potter, Weasley, and Granger were all running out of the great hall and burst out the door. No one else seemed to notice but Draco. He thought for one second and then took off running after them. He trailed them down to the school grounds where they ran into Hagrid’s hut. Draco stood on the hill overlooking the grounds, not knowing what to do. He stood there, and then decided he might as well wait to see what would happen.
Dear Potter,
“Morning.” Luna said dreamily, tilting her head up and smiling at the ceiling.
Draco
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed several people creeping towards him, wands already poised to attack. Then he glimpsed someone shake their head slightly. He gave his silent thanks to that person.
Draco ran after that. And he barely made it to the Slytherin common room before he started crying.
“Hi.” Draco said, feeling warmth spread all over him.
“Alright…”
“We’ll apparate out if necessary.” Harry said in a low voice. Draco shivered. He could feel his warm breath on his ear.
“Yes Ms. Parkinson.” Flitwick said stiffly. She flushed and looked down at her shoes. He began pairing off people and to Draco’s great dismay and greater excitement Potter was paired with him. Being paired with Potter was always...interesting. Draco drew in a deep breath and resolved to act normal. Like enemies normally acted. He tried to draw his face into a scowl. Potter came to his desk and stiffly sat with him. Act normal, act normal.
He looked up. “How could we possibly ever be together?”
“Ron, your dress robes.” A girl’s voice was saying. Potter, Granger, and Weasley were walking past their car. Draco sucked in a breath. A frilly dress looking thing had just fallen out of Weasley’s trunk.
“What were you doing?” Severus asked Draco, looking confused.
“Right well-Luna, can you come out?” he asked.
Ginny murmured something into her hands that sounded like I don’t wanna know. Draco swallowed, he wasn’t sure he wanted to know either.
“Don’t care about what?” she asked slowly.
“Don’t be sorry.” his father said. “Be better.” Draco stiffened. Be better. He had done his best...He thought he was doing everything right. But...but Granger had gotten the better of him. No, not Granger. It was Potter’s fault. Potter was distracting him. He was probably doing that on purpose. Of course. Potter wanted him to fail. He wanted to bring ruin to the Malfoy name.
“Just breathe through only your mouth.” Draco suggested after several fruitless attempts.
Your worst enemy who likes you but also hates your guts
Neither of them said anything. Draco was fairly sure Severus thought he was incredibly stupid for letting his heart get the best of him.
After that everything happened very fast. The three of them were thrown to the floor by a big blast and students and teachers began pouring out of the walls.
Dear Bloody Potter,
“Is dead.” Ginny said flatly, finishing Harry’s sentence for him.
Dear Potter,
She gave Draco a worried look. “I can bandage her wounds after we staunch the blood flow. After that though...we’re going to need potions. And I don’t think the mending charm is supposed to be used on wounds like this.” Her eyes filled with tears and she moved closer to Draco so Hermione couldn’t hear. “We’re really going to need to get potions Draco. She might-she might die if we don’t.” She pressed a hand to her mouth and let the tills spill over.
“Sorry, you can seat yourselves. Be with you in a moment.” She smiled and shook herself a little.
“Where were you?” Luna asked softly, she sat on Ginny’s leg and ran a finger along her calf. Draco bit back the jealousy rising in his throat.
“Go on, go on. I’ll be just fine here.” She said impatiently, motioning them towards the door. Draco cast her a suspicious glance but she just smiled sweetly.
Snape was silent for a moment, he had turned away and was studying the wall, hands clasped together behind his back.
“I kept thinking about it, you could’ve easily kidnapped him, or let the Death Eaters in but you didn’t. Voldemort wanted you to do something but none of us knew what it was, he sent you on some sort of quest and Harry trusted you enough never to pry. He assumed you were just going to ignore Voldemort and then go into hiding with Snape or the order eventually. But I don’t think that’s true either.” She said everything in a rush, making broad gestures with her hands all the while. Now Draco knew why Granger had continued to beat him year after year in every single class. She was a bloody genius.
“Umbridge.” Luna shook her head. “The things she says in that class. You should see-” She broke off abruptly, flushing.
“You alright Draco?” Theo asked. Draco’s head snapped up, alarmed. When had he come in?
“Well then what else are we supposed to do!” Harry fired back, removing his hand from Draco’s shoulder to stalk over to where Hermione was standing worriedly.
“I am his head of house.” Severus spoke in a familiar low and dangerous tone. “Come along Draco.” He drew up his mental shields and followed Severus out warily.
“I want to help you, I made the unbreakable vow to your mother and swore I would protect you. The Unbreakable vow Draco.” Draco’s heart sank. Why on earth would he make the Unbreakable vow? That was a bloody terrible idea. And what exactly had he made the unbreakable vow to do? He opted to say nothing, merely staring at the ceiling in silence.
“No, no, nothing’s wrong. I was merely lonely.” she met his eyes and grinned. “But I’m not anymore.”
“Alright, alright. I know you like him, but he sucks. Anyway, what were you saying about wards Draco?”
“I think the song is brilliant.” Theo said from a chair, waving his arm in the air.
“Yes! Yes, she’s so sweet and she doesn’t call me names, and she’s pretty and smart and helps me find my shoes.” Luna gushed her eyes bright.
“It’s Diggory!” Theo said, his eyes wide in terror. “And-and Potter.” Draco craned his neck in alarm, doing his best to see what was going on in all of the chaos.
“You okay?” she asked, looking concerned.
“Right.” She didn’t say anything, she sat down on the edge of his bed and ran her hands down her face. He sat next to her cautiously.
“Okay, towels.” He turned and went to go get Luna. He felt like he was going to be sick. What if she died? No. No she wasn’t going to die. Draco would not allow that. He knocked on the door where Luna and Ginny had gone to sleep.
“I’m teaching you occlumency.” Severus repeated.
“You didn’t!” Ginny squawked, rising to her feet. “You went to the address didn’t you? Are you insane? You could’ve been fucking kidnapped!”
“Towels…” Her eyelids were fluttering shut and she seemed to be getting paler by the second.
“Uh, me too please.” Draco replied, feeling his face burn. She nodded and scribbled it down quickly, before seemingly skipping off in the other direction. Draco wondered if she was feeling alright.
“Is it though? He’s really back, I know he is. And-and what’s going to happen Draco?” Her voice shook as she spoke. “We’re not learning anything about how to defend ourselves, I’m scared.”
“Nah we know it was you.” One of them nodded, they’re eyes bright. Draco was starting to feel queasy.
“Yeah they can’t just-” Oh shit. This was his father’s doing. Of course it was. Who else would sentence a magical beast to death for a simple misunderstanding.
Dear Potter,
She nodded. “And Remus is going to go with him, the two of them are going to try and find any horcruxes while they’re at it.” She rubbed at her eyes and Draco wondered when she had last gotten a full night of sleep. And he still had no idea what the bloody hell a horcrux was. Hermione’s explanation had been so confusing he had given up on trying to follow after the first several minutes of what sounded like a class lecture.
Draco rose to his feet and crept up the stairs. He didn’t want to wake anyone with the terrible creaking noise they always seemed to make. It was so early in the morning it was basically still night. He was very sure Ginny would have his head if he woke her up at this hour. She was by no means a morning person. His heart stuttered a bit as he stopped in front of Harry’s bedroom. He could still destroy this letter. Half of him wanted to rip it to shreds and never think about it again. However the other half of him, the lovesick half, was filled with so much hope at what would happen if he gave this letter to Harry. He leaned his forehead against the door and took in a quiet breath. Slowly, he slipped the letter under the door and sat down on the stairs. He was surprised to find that he felt no sense of dread. Only excitement. Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face. He didn’t even know what Harry would think of it. Yet he was already so blissfully happy, any sense of dread was banished to a faraway place in his mind.
“We ought to set a good example for Durmstrang and Beuaxbotons.” He nodded at the class enthusiastically.
He searched for the right words but found there wasn’t really anything to say. She was right after all. They weren’t learning anything, the dark lord was back, and they couldn’t do anything about it.
Draco nodded at him swiftly and turned to go.
If it had been at any other moment Draco would’ve spent a good 20 minutes taking in the basilisk skeleton. However it was not any other moment and Draco was sprawled on the floor while everyone else was shouting.
“I know, I know. ‘Potter’.” she rolled her eyes. “It’s always him.”
“You good mate? You looked a little spacy there for a second.”
“Hello!” Luna said brightly, looking around at everyone.
“Nothing, nothings wrong. It’s just that your father and I aren’t going to be here for a few days and I wanted to make sure you'd be okay staying by yourself.”
You truly are insufferable. I still hate you. But a part of me wants to be you. Everyone loves you. I don’t, obviously. But you’re...something I suppose. I guess Gryffindor is a good fit for you. You’re always playing the hero and you clearly won’t back down from a challenge. I don’t even know why I’m still writing to you. We’re enemies and I am going to hate you until the day I die. But you can admire your enemies, right? You can admire them and steal all of their skills and use them against them and ultimately that will be their demise. And how bloody satisfying will that be to be the one who bests Harry Potter by watching him closely? Nothing’s changed. So have a terrible day and an even worse life.
“Obviously.” Draco said much more stiffly than he meant to.
He had been reading the paper as he went down to lunch when Weasley bumped into him and sent the paper flying to the floor. On the cover was Weasley’s family. He hadn’t had the chance to read the article quite yet, mostly he was looking at the paper so he would not have to see Potter.
Draco put a finger to his lips and thought quickly. He couldn’t bring a wardrobe all the way from Hogwarts, that would be extremely suspicious.
“Don’t lie to me.” That was enough for Draco to turn and leave the room. He practically broke into a sprint as he flung the door open, and ran down the corridor. Some part of him expected Severus to come chasing after him and curse him. Then force him to listen to everything he had to say. What Severus didn’t understand was that they no longer wanted the same thing. Draco wanted to be free of this burden, to live a normal life with Harry. He wasn’t going to kill Dumbledore if he could help it.
“No. It’s not enough. Go.” He motioned for Harry to get out of his office. Harry jumped up, practically shaking with fury, and for a second there Draco thought Harry was going to scream at the man. But instead he walked out in silence and slammed the door behind them.
“I…” Hermione began, then shook her head and sat on a stool. “Okay so I know it’s going to sound insane.”
At the moment he didn’t have it in him to be feeling sorry for Harry. Even though a small part of his brain was telling him that he would end up forgiving him sooner or later.
The dark lord wouldn’t just go running around Muggle London looking for him right? That would be ridiculous. Awkwardly Draco half stepped, half fell off his broom and swung it over his shoulder, getting a better grip on the bag as well. Thankfully, he had landed in a backalleway and there was no one around to wonder what the hell was doing. Draco didn’t really know himself so it would’ve been a painful hassle to explain. He jingled the money in his bag, he would need to go to Gringotts if he wanted to exchange it for Muggle money. Draco chewed his lower lip. Gringotts was open most hours of the day, would it be best if he went extremely early in the morning so there was less of a chance for someone to recognize him? Damn. He really hadn’t thought this through. Fuck it. There was nothing else for him to do. If someone recognized him, well he would just run in the other direction and hope they didn’t catch him. He swung open the door to the Leaky Cauldron and strode inside, doing his best to look like he had any place being in there.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Word has just spread through Slytherin that you’re missing. Theo told me a few moments ago and I had to sprint to the bathroom so I could write this. Theo has a bad habit of sneaking out after hours. He helped me find you a few weeks ago so I could report you to Mcgonagall. Although none of that matters anymore. I take everything I said back. I’m sorry. I don’t want you to die. I don’t. We were all playing a game of gobstones when Theo burst in and said the golden trio was missing. I have no idea where you went but you have to come back. You can’t just leave like this. I don’t know if you left on purpose or if someone took you but please come back. Hogwarts isn’t the same without you. I’m not the same without you. Even though we’re just enemies it doesn’t feel like that to me. You might not consider me a friend but I do. You’re my friend Harry, you don’t know it but you are. Come back. That’s all I can ask. Come back and maybe we can start over.
“Today you will be practicing the summoning charm.” Flitwick said brightly. Everyone in the class nodded and began muttering among themselves. Flitwick began the lesson and Draco did his best to pay attention. He was doing an okay job of it too until he felt a hand come to rest on his leg. Harry’s hand. On his leg. It took a lot of self control not to turn and kiss him right there in front of everyone. Should he do the same? It wouldn’t be weird, right? Potter’s hand was on his leg after all. Every part of him was warm and a sleepy, happy filling had begun filling his head. He tried to shake himself a little to try and bring himself back to reality. Very slowly he placed his hand on top of Potter’s thigh. Potter stiffened and then relaxed under his touch. His heart began pounding harder. He was so happy, even though he knew this wasn’t something that was supposed to make him happy. They were mortal enemies. But right now...they were something else. All too soon they had to move apart as they began to practice the spell. Draco noticed quickly that Potter was doing it wrong. Without thinking he placed a hand on Potter’s arm and traced it in the proper movement. He was warm to touch and Draco heard him draw in a sharp breath as he grabbed his arm as gently as he could.
“Right, okay.” He wondered if he could kiss Potter goodbye. Maybe they would never talk to each other again after this so he should just throw everything to the wind and kiss him? So he did. Draco Malfoy kissed Harry Potter and wondered if it was their last.
“No, sir, you don’t understand-”
“Me?” Draco asked, but knowing she was right. He’d barely spoken to any of them on the rest of the ride.
“Don’t do that to me.” Snape shook his head. Draco waited for him to continue.
“No.” he shook his head. Even though this was something he had known might happen for years now, he still did not want to believe it. “No, he can’t be back.” Draco, Pansy, and Theo stared at each other in pure terror. They all knew what this meant. They’re families would soon be recruited once again to the dark lord, if they were not already in service.
August 28th: A Good Hippogriff (oneshot)
“She’s sad, give her a break.”
I don’t really know what to say anymore. One of our classmates is dead. And the dark lord has returned. The tale going around is that you saw him. I’m not sure I want to know what it means that you saw him come back. I keep thinking about how it could’ve been you who had died, so easily you could’ve been the one the dark lord decided to kill. You’re still alive but you seem to have a death sentence Potter. How do you always manage to get yourself into these life or death situations at the drop of a hat? I’m glad you’re alive but I am unable to comfort you in any of the ways I want. I want to hug you and hold you close while you tell me everything horrible that you had to bear witness too. I don’t know how much longer I can keep silent and keep these things to myself. It’s overwhelming and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I suppose I will pack up my things and hope everything is not absolute shite at home. Goodbye for now Potter. I’m thankful that you made it out alive again.
“Why don’t you go to the hospital wing then?” Theo suggested. Luna was shaking her head next to him. How did she know so much? She probably knew things he didn’t know himself.
A few weeks later they found themselves breaking into the ministry. Of course it fell upon Draco to be the distraction. He wasn’t even polyjuiced, just to ensure that every single eye in the room would be drawn to him. Hermione had come up with this idea actually. Once again, she was correct. While the rest of them snuck into the Ministry, intending to go steal the horcrux that they didn’t know where it was, he was to walk into the middle of the Ministry. Where the most employees would be, and yell that he had seen Harry Potter. Draco was a wanted man himself, and Hermione’s idea had been for him to pretend to sell Harry out. Which actually, worked out quite brilliantly.
The next morning Draco woke to soft giggles. Sleeping on the couch had been a bad idea. With his eyes still squeezed shut he sat up and wondered if he could leave the room without Luna and Ginny noticing. He did not want to know what they were doing. He stood up shakily and tried to take a step in what he hoped was the opposite direction.
“I don’t fucking care what the dark lord thinks about who I choose to kiss!” Draco yelled.
“Guys…” Hermione said, but he could hear the smile in her voice. Shakily he gave her a kiss on the cheek too.
“What? No you don’t.” He shook his head about to say something else but Draco quickly said,
Dear Harry,
Love,
Sincerely,
“I love you.” Draco sobbed and grabbed Harry’s hand to keep himself upright. He pressed his lips together as they shook. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Love shouldn’t have to hurt this terribly.
“You can’t Harry! Voldemort has no mercy, he'll kill all of us anyway!” Hermione shrieked.
“I don’t know, I hope so but it might take a little while.”
“Gone soft that one.” Amycus nodded somberly at Draco. “Bet he doesn’t want to kill Dumbledore.” Draco tried to make a sound of annoyance, though it came out as more of a squeak.
“How was your Christmas Draco?”
“You will take the mark.” It was not a question, and every word was drawn out extremely slowly, as if he was daring Draco to say no.
“Draco.” Severus warned, his voice low.
“Oh.” He set his jaw. “I probably botched it, I was kind of distracted when I did the spell.”
I’d like to blame you for nearly having my arm chopped off by a Hippogriff. I mean I was just copying what you did after all. I followed all the instructions and in return my arm nearly got taken off. I’m not writing because I haven’t seen you in days, I’m bored. That’s really all. It’s not like I expected you to come visit so that we could-nevermind. Anyway the Hippogriff lesson was rather interesting wasn’t it? Crabbe and Goyle didn’t really think so, but I did. And I’m not jealous that you got to ride the Hippogriff (look at the state of me I probably would’ve died on the bloody thing), but that did look rather fun. Well I suppose the whole Sirius Black ordeal is not such a big deal after all if they’re letting us go into the Forbidden Forest for lessons. I do wonder why they’ve brought the dementors on though. They seem to be bothering most. Poor Luna, she gets in the right state whenever we walk past them. Won’t tell me what’s up though. Not that I blame her. They make you hear some downright awful stuff. I better go, Madam Pomfrey is giving me dirty looks for not resting.
Point being they ended up inside Hogwarts two days later with little to no trouble. Severus had seemed a bit confused as to why they would possibly want to be in there, but Harry had assured him that it was necessary. Everything had seemed to be going fine as they were all under invisibility spells, until they had heard Voldemort’s voice rocket through the entire castle. And Draco’s mark started burning so badly he thought he was going to die. Ginny and Luna had left to go search Ravenclaw tower, and he and the others were down in the Chamber of Secrets gathering basilisk fangs.
She snorted into her mug, shoulders shaking.
Draco Malfoy
“Thanks.” She grumbled, taking the mug of coffee from him and dumping what looked like a cup of sugar into it.
Malfoy
“Yes, yes everything is going brilliantly!” Lucius said, with a glint in his eye.
Harry nodded, although he said nothing. Nearly all of the air rushed out of Draco’s lungs. They were safe. It wasn’t his fault.
“Me and Granger?” Draco laughed. “No way.”
Draco actually did pass out when Harry practically leaped out of Hagrid’s arms and sprinted into the castle. Draco didn’t see Molly kill Bellatrix, he didn’t see Fred die, and he didn’t see Lavender get bitten by a werewolf. When he awoke he realized that Harry and the dark lord were dueling. Feeling sick he dragged himself into a sitting position and crept towards the large crowd of people uncertainly. Somehow Hermione found him, and grabbed his wrist so tightly he was sure his circulation was cut off. He cried when the dark lord fell to the ground and his wand went spinning into Harry’s hand. Everyone began screaming and tried to surround Harry. But Harry gently pushed everyone aside until he had gotten to Draco. He didn’t have a chance to say anything before Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and kissed him. Draco started crying and so did Harry. There was silence for a moment before Ginny let out a whooping sound and soon after many more joined in. He wasn’t really paying attention to anything else in the moment as he kissed the person he loved most in the world.
Dear Potter,
“Right! And Hermione will be back to celebrate.” Harry grinned, not noticing Draco and Luna a little ways away. Draco’s heart squeezed and released, and felt himself let out the first real breath he had since he’d heard Harry was missing. It was as if he was watching from above as Harry and Weasley walked away, very much alive.
Draco had vomited on his own shoes at those words. Amycus had rolled his eyes and half dragged, half carried him off the grounds. Draco didn’t care. Harry was captured. And it was all his fault.
“Oh? Been stealing from me?”
“I think so, it’s mostly because of the chamber back in first year. It’s not really my place to tell you, but you can ask her later. She’s pretty open about it now.” Luna said quietly, as she peeled Hermione’s shirt off as gently as she could.
“Wait! We’re still friends right?”
You’re a bloody idiot. I can’t believe I wanted to be friends with you, you’re so bloody stupid. You actually fell for the duel. Do you want to get expelled? It’s annoying how many rules you can break without getting expelled. You should’ve been expelled by now, I hope you know that. Even though we’re enemies I don’t want you to be expelled. You’re my worst enemy. Who am I going to compete with once you're gone? I couldn’t stand it if I actually had to talk to Granger, or Merlin forbid...Weasel. So you have to stick around, and don’t get expelled. Please. Anyway I hate you. A ton.
“They didn’t-did they just?” She blinked furiously. “How could they?”
“Er-We can’t really tell you, Dumbledore-”
“My father.” was all he said. Lucius told him some shite about Sirius Black being Potter’s godfather, and apparently he wanted Draco to use this information wisely. Whatever the hell that meant.
He didn’t know what to do now. Everything seemed so fucking hopeless. Draco must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew was Severus shaking him softly.
He shrugged, not wanting to tell her that he didn’t have much hope for anything anymore.
“Hello Ulysses.” he muttered as he untied the letter from it’s leg. The other owl waited patiently and stuck out it’s leg in excitement.
She rolled her eyes. “He’s been talking about you for like half the train ride you know.”
“...a disappointment to the Malfoy name.” his father was saying. Draco realized he had spaced out in his utter horror. “Do you know what it was like to hear that a mudblood of all people had bested my own son?”
He nodded, not trusting himself to speak. A tear traced itself down her cheek.
You think I’m bloody brilliant. I’m going to pretend I didn’t spend a couple minutes staring at my ceiling in blissful happiness because of what you said. I told you of my plan to hide our relationship (YOU CALLED IT A RELATIONSHIP). And you grabbed my hands and said it was brilliant, that I was bloody brilliant. You also asked me about my blood prejudices. So I told you the truth. They are not mine, they are my fathers. I don’t share the same sentiment and I very much wish to unlearn what my father attempted to teach me. You kissed me after I said that, and told me how proud you were of me. I almost passed out on top of you. Harry I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy in my entire life. Yes, many things have brought me happiness. But nothing feels the same as when I am with you. I know we have been together for only a matter of days. So what could I possibly know about relationships? I will admit although I do not know much, I know that you make me so happy I could cry. And maybe I did cry a little when you called me your boyfriend. So what if we’re a secret. You’re my precious secret to keep. At least until the war is over.
“Let go of me!” Draco did his best to shake his arm out of Weasley’s grip.
Severus raised his eyebrows at him but said nothing. Draco crossed his arms and looked away.
“I had it under control.” Draco snapped, crossing his arms. Why was it that Severus always deemed to show up at the most dramatic of moments?
“You can say that again.” Theo said, glancing sideways at her. Draco and Luna were wrapped together in their cloaks, huddling together for warmth. Hardly any of the players were visible during the match, except for brief glimpses when they came close to the stands.
He started a pot of coffee and hummed lightly to himself. He heard the shower turn on upstairs and stiffened. Wait. Did that mean that Harry had read the letter by now? What if he hadn’t read the letter at all and decided to fling it in the trash? He sucked in a breath and stood, not knowing what he intended to do.
“We have good reason to believe Harry Potter might be expelled.” he said, and then gave Draco a smile. “I wanted to tell you, I know how much you despise him.”
Your Worst Enemy
“Prat.”
“No one’s trying to drive you insane!” Potter yelled. They were basically screaming at each other now, and Draco was thankful no one had come running to see what all the commotion was about.
“Harry? It’s okay with me that you guys are friends Luna.” he said, doing his best to sound nonchalant.
“Is she okay?” he asked Luna, motioning his head to where Ginny had run to. Mostly just to get his mind off the blood covering his hands.
Quite a lot has happened since I have last written you. Let’s start here. It’s always startling when you look at me with such a mixed look on your face. I spotted you during the World Cup and ensured that my parents and I walked in that exact direction. For some reason I didn’t notice the Weasel family and Granger with you. I was planning to merely walk past and pretend to not look at you, when in reality I would be studying you because, as I have mentioned previously, you are quite lovely. But that’s really besides the point. I always seem to get on this topic. It’s driving me insane. Moving on I would like to believe that your eyes brightened when they saw me. However within seconds they darkened again. And I’m sincerely hoping that was because of my parents and not me. I hold onto a hope that you don’t always think about me in regards to hate, but instead someone who you can tolerate and doesn’t drive you to near madness. I’m doing it again, aren't I? Terribly sorry about that. My first point here is that we saw each other at the World Cup before the later chaos and you did not look completely disgusted at the sight of me. I would give anything to know what you thought when you saw me.
“No, we haven’t even been on the train that long, we still have half the ride left.” Blaise replied, looking around. No one said anything else and Draco wondered if perhaps some type of serial killer had broken onto the train when the car door slid open quietly. Pansy let out a squeak and the rest of the Slytherins drew their wands but Luna quickly said,
“Er, yes?” he asked hesitantly. He really didn’t want to repeat another Weasley incident. Although Granger was certainly much smarter than Weasley.
Draco nearly fell down the stairs on his way out of the Leaky Cauldron. His entire body was practically vibrating with excitement. He, Draco Malfoy, was going to Muggle London. Although he was excited it felt terribly inappropriate to be so. After all, everyone else in the Wizarding World was busy fighting a war, and what was he doing? He was completely useless. So far he had only managed to escape his own home, and even then Severus had caught him leaving! He would make a bloody terrible spy. He had no idea how Severus managed. Sneaking around was quite the hassle.
Draco
Draco folded the letter carefully and placed it among the ever growing stack in his box. Shaking slightly he took out his wand and whispered “Diminuendo.”
Draco wracked his brains to see if he remembered ever hearing anything about Regulus.
Love,
“Have you already killed him?” Alecto asked eagerly, even in the dark Draco could see that her eyes were glistening with excitement.
The edge of her mouth tilted upwards. “Yeah, us Malfoy. I’m going to help you so we can all make it out together.”
She gave them some spoons and sugar, before hurrying off in the opposite direction. There was a definite spring in her step.
“How-how.” Draco stuttered, his stomach tightening in panic and his mind whirling desperately. He couldn’t even deny it, he was so stunned.
She waved her hand in the air. “Yes, Draco. His aura. It gets stronger when someone is experiencing strong emotions.”
“Okay here.” Ginny ran back into the room with a bunch of towels in her arms. She shoved them at Luna and quickly backed away.
It was just him and Potter now. Draco felt like he was going to pass on. Every part of him was sweating and his knees were shaking. Potter was still bright red and Draco tried, he really did, not to look at Potter’s lips. But they were parted, and Draco wanted nothing more than to run his fingers through his hair and kiss him until he couldn’t remember anything else, until- And then he realized his face was impossibly close next to Potter’s. Potter had grabbed the front of his quidditch robes and pulled him closer so that he could see the gorgeous color of his eyes and he could hear Potter breathing unevenly. What was going on, what was happening, Draco was going to pass out from the stress and excitement of all of this because this was way too much to believe was actually happening. It would be so so easy to lean in and part Harry’s lips with his own. All he had to do now was lean in a little. And he almost did. But reality came crashing back into him when he glimpsed Umbridge storming towards them from over Potter’s shoulder. Without thinking he quickly shoved Potter away. He wished he hadn’t seen the hurt and confusion that passed over his face as he stared in horror at Umbridge storming towards them.
“Who?” Draco asked, glancing around. Madam Pince was nowhere in sight.
“He’s dead.” Harry croaked, his eyes glassed over, not looking at either of them. His expression was vacant, haunted.
For a couple days Draco had forgotten about the problem that should’ve been in the forefront of his mind. He was a death eater. A death eater who was supposed to kill Dumbledore as soon as humanly possible. And so far he had one very flimsy pretend lead on the wardrobe in the room of requirement. So he was kind of screwed. How was he going to get out of this situation without ending up dead or accidentally killing someone else in the process. For a little while he thought about asking Harry for his opinion on the situation, then realized it was not a good idea to tell Harry that he was a death eater. For one Harry might never talk to him again, and two if someone tried to read Harry’s mind that thought would most likely be in the front. Currently Draco was attempting to teach Harry to clear his mind. And…
“Wh-” He shut his mouth in horror. Luna let out a small scream and covered her hands with her eyes. Hooded figures were flying together in the hundreds to the quidditch field. It was the most terrifying thing he had ever seen. Their black cloaks flapped in the wind as they eagerly swarmed towards the stadium. Students began screaming in terror as the teachers jumped up and began sending silvery spells the dementors way. Luna sobbed and turned her face into Draco’s chest.
“You idiot.” Ginny groaned, falling onto the couch. “You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack.” She covered her eyes with her hands. Draco shared in the sentiment.
“Shite, are you hurt? Hang on.” Her footsteps retreated hastily. She was going to leave him out here, she didn’t want him coming back inside because he was a miserable excuse for a human. Honestly he didn’t really deserve to be let back in.
Dear Potter,
“Exactly, and that brings us one step closer to getting Harry.” Hermione said with a grim smile.
“Weasley is going to pretend to be Harry, and go into hiding. Then me, you, Luna, and Ginny, we’re going to figure out a way to break Harry out while Weasley misleads everyone.” Hermione seemed to be the master of complicated plans.
Dear Potter,
You have riddled me with some sort of illness. You must have cursed me while I wasn’t looking. I feel ill. I feel as if I am dying whenever I am around you. This must be your plan, to make me feel sick so that we cannot fight. Am I no longer a worthy enemy of you? Is that why you have done this to me? I don’t understand what is happening. Even the thought of you sends this feeling to the pit of my stomach and this warmth spreads all over me. I hate you. This is all your fault Potter.
“Yeah, I suppose.” he said, a small smile on his face.
“There’s another one like this, do you know how to fix it?” He asked, turning to face Borgin. He didn’t look very happy.
“I have to tell you guys something, and I need you to believe me.”
Your worst enemy who is terribly bored and wants to pick a fight with you
“It’s not that type of illness.” Luna murmured, so quietly that no one heard.
“You can tell me.” He wanted to. Truly, he wanted to tell Luna everything that had been weighing on him all summer. But that might put her in danger. She shouldn’t have to suffer the consequences of knowing his burdens.
“Yes, we’ll do anything.”
“CATCH HIM!” Draco recognized the voice of Dolores Umbridge as she chased after them, her wand raised, face twisted in fury.
Your worst enemy who is stuck in the pit of life and wishes he weren’t
Draco cleared his throat. Where on earth was Hermione? And where the fuck was Severus? Surely he didn’t expect Draco to deal with all these people alone, hell they could all murder him in a heartbeat.
“Er-” he began, not knowing what he was actually planning to say. But he was cut off as Granger stormed to him and slapped him across the face.
Draco bit back hysterical giggles.
“Yes.” His voice was hoarse and to Draco’s horror he realized his eyes were glistening. Oh dear. Emotions. Now was when he was going to show emotions? Was he supposed to hug him? What-
“Why did you bring me here?” he asked, but was ignored.
“Right, I better go patrol. Or whatever I’m supposed to be doing.”
Ginny laughed and shook her head. “You have no idea.” She sat up suddenly, looking Draco dead in the eye.
“Er-, because Professor, someone was killed and if we knew how to defend our-”
“So they sent you?”
Sincerely,
“Proof please.” He responded uneasily, still gripping his wand firmly.
“I’m sorry.” Draco knew he didn’t regret it though, they were already taking enough chances as it was. The last thing he wanted was for Luna to be put into danger because of them. She had been the person who was always trying to help him, for once he wanted to make sure he was able to help her.
“I guess it’s a good start.” Another person muttered.
His hands crept into Potter’s hair and he ran his fingers through it, loving the softness of it. There was no such thing as time anymore, they kissed for so long they didn’t even know the darkening shadows outside. They stopped when they heard a meowing noise nearby.
“I’m-I’m, really sorry father.” Draco said softly, looking down at his hands.
Draco Malfoy
“How did you-how?” Harry stared at him unbelievingly. “Snape tried that a couple days ago.” He said in such a low tone Draco almost didn’t hear.
Sincerely,
Dear Potter,
“It was lovely.” he smiled at her, unable to help himself.
“Great.” Draco almost smiled, then realized that was probably a bad idea. “I have to be off, and keep this safe for me please?”
“I knew it! I was right, I knew I knew I knew you liked Harry!”
“I can go out and check-” Draco started but was interrupted by the bang of the front door. The three of them pulled their wands out and pointed them at the intruder. Hermione walked in, yanking a slippery, silver cloak off her.
I don’t remember much of what happened at the feast. Only that Severus was glaring at me most of the time. Not that I blame him too badly. I know deep down he only does these things because he cares. Even though he often pretends he doesn’t, he does. Anyway I hope we get a chance to meet again soon. I wonder what you’re thinking right now. I’m scared that you thought it was all a mistake, but then again, why would you keep seeking me out? It doesn’t make any sense. You’re a very confusing person Potter (Harry? Can I call you that now?) And I want to know what’s going to happen with us. I have so many things I should tell you. Like that I’m a death eater. And that I’ve fallen hopelessly in love with you and I believe you might actually feel some sort of affection for me. Oh I had something to tell you. Severus is very very very veryyyy pissed at the both of us. He made me come to his office to yell at me. I thought he was going to start crying. He was so angry. I mean he didn’t look like he was going to cry but I just had this feeling that he was scared and angry and sad. He doesn’t want either of us to die I suppose. And he seems extremely worried that this will put the both of us in danger. And he’s right. But both of us already have targets on our backs. So what’s the point of making it through this whole thing without even living? The whole point is, we feel this way for each other and there’s a good chance we both will be dead soon. Why not try then?
“Oh.” Draco said, his shoulders sagging a little bit. He had been looking forward to seeing Luna on the train. It had become somewhat of a tradition over the years.
Well hopefully Hermione knew what she was talking about. Apparently she had gone back to her own home to experiment with wards, and in doing so she had discovered the trick to getting them to fall from the outside. In her haste to get back to Grimmauld place before the rest of them woke up, she hadn’t been paying attention. And a snatcher had cursed her. She managed to apparate to the front doorstep, practically bleeding out. Since then she had regained some of her color, but without a blood replenishing potion she was still extremely weak.
Draco
“Draco, Draco, your head is practically buzzing, it's distracting.” Oops. He was supposed to be helping her finalize a potions essay. Not that he’d been much help so far. He was way too excited.
I simply want to clear something up. I did not want Buckbeak to be murdered. He was a truly lovely creature and he did not deserve to die. I am sorry that he was killed but it wasn’t my fault. I asked my father not to go through with it. I don’t understand why he still did. I didn’t even tell my father about the whole incident, I told my mother. I suppose she told him, I guess she tells him most everything. But that’s not the point. The point is that I’m sorry. I really am. Buckbeak deserved to have a long happy life. Well, I best be going now it’s getting late.
“You obliviated them.” He said plainly.
“Come on mate, let’s go.” Granger was looking at him with disappointment traced all over her face.
“Still.”
Draco Malfoy
The only conceivable solution to not dying is to actually go along with the dark lord’s plan. It would also require Severus’s help, which is quite unfortunate. The wardrobe is nearly fixed, and what I would need to do is send a message to the death eaters to let them know when they can come through. I would then need to tell Severus I can’t kill Dumbledore and ask him to do it instead. And after that I would somehow need to get a message to you to tell you about Severus’s plan. Following that you would have to go alert Dumbledore to Severus’s intent. Assuming all of this somehow works out, all the death eaters would then be inside Hogwarts, probably trying to murder you, or kidnapp you. So then all of us would have to get them out somehow. And that’s the extent of my plan. I could tell Dumbledore of all of this right now I suppose, but I’m not really sure that would work. For one I don’t think he likes me very much so maybe he would assume that I’m lying. And then you would probably hate me, and so would Severus, and how do I know Dumbledore won’t give me up to the dark lord anyway? See this is all very complicated and it’s late and I’m getting very tired. I’ll see you tomorrow Harry.
When school finally rolled around again, Draco could not have been more glad. He was even excited to see Weasley for goodness sake. The whole summer had been the worst and most boring one yet. Even when he had gotten his prefect badge he couldn’t feel happy. His mother had looked extremely excited but to him it hadn’t really mattered. It also meant that he could not sit with Luna and Theo for the first part of the train ride. He walked with Pansy to the prefect train car, trying to guess who the other prefects would be. Together they walked in and saw Hannah Abott, Ernie Macmillan, Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, and-
“You’re a really great friend Draco.” She grinned at him. “But I hope you know that I didn’t mean to sit with Harry and his friends. I couldn’t find everyone else so I sat by myself, because I knew you’d come find me later, and then all of a sudden all of them were walking in and Ginevra was there…” she trailed off with a small shrug.
Your worst enemy
Draco Malfoy
Draco huffed a small laugh but quickly grew sober. “He doesn’t feel the same way, I know-”
“Nothing.” Draco spat. He couldn’t get any peace around this damn castle. Couldn’t even read the bloody paper without being interrupted.
When they approached the gate Severus looked angrily between the three of them. Uh oh. Draco knew he was going to get another lecture about this sometime soon.
“You have to. You know what they’ll do to you once they find out.” Despite practically having been sentenced to death Harry didn’t look scared.
“He’s gone.” Luna replied distantly.
We don’t have to be enemies on Christmas right? I’m fairly certain that’s the rule. On Christmas there is no such thing as enemies. Because, it’s Christmas, duh. There’s not any particular reason I’m writing this time. Father and Mother love me I know, but they don’t have time for me sometimes. And I understand. But I would like to have a friend. Or enemy. To talk to when they’re doing, whatever it is they do. Honestly, adults are rather strange. Though that’s not the point. The point is, I’m grateful for you Potter. Even though we are enemies instead of friends you never ignore me. And...well that has to count for something? So have a happy Christmas Harry.
“Come.” Severus said in a low voice.
I’m going to leave my house today. I’ve been thinking furiously about when was the best time to make a break for it and I couldn’t see how one was better than the other. I’m usually alone most days. The dark lord has seemed to lose all interest in me. Actually I think he forgot I even existed. My father has returned, you see, and now he can punish him instead. I’ve had to go to a few meetings, the mark burns like mad whenever he summons us, but that’s all mostly. I’ve had some of the house elves bring you extra food, as I assume they’re not feeding you enough. I’m extremely grateful you haven’t been murdered yet, though I do not understand what is the point in holding you hostage. The dark lord has droned on for so very long about finally killing you, I would’ve thought he would’ve done it the first chance he got. Clearly I was wrong. Don’t tell anyone I said this but I don’t think the dark lord is quite as smart as he leads others on to believe. He’s a bit full of himself really. More than a bit actually. Sorry, off topic, again. Point is I’m leaving, and I’m going to find the Order. Don’t know how. I have no idea where their headquarters would be, as you never told me. Which makes sense, I would’ve put all of them in danger most likely. So I am going to leave my house and wander around for a while, whilst praying I do not get caught. I hope you know that I would take you with me if I could open the cell door. But I tried, multiple times, and it came to no fruition. The dark lord clearly placed heavy charms on the door, that I have no way of opening. So the only thing to do is find someone who can. I have only seen Severus once, and he barely even looked at me. I don’t know what to think about him anymore. At first it was oh so easy to believe he was a death eater like the rest of them, but now I’m not so sure. I don’t think he wanted to go through with it, even if it had been his plan all along. Just the way he looked, afterwards. Something about it wasn’t very Severus-like. Doesn’t matter much now though. I’ll be gone without a trace soon enough. I best be going, I want to get a good head start so that no one catches me. Well, bye then Potter. I will do my damn best to save you. Please do not die while I am gone.
“Yeah, best we leave him alone though, Umbridge is watching.”
I wonder what you heard to make you pass out. I don’t care that you passed out. Obviously I could care less what you were doing on the train ride over, I was just wondering why you passed out and none of the rest of us did. We were all terrified out of our minds to be sure, but we didn’t pass out. I’m not quite sure why Sirius Black’s breakout requires all the extra precautions. I mean if it’s really such a big deal why not have us stay home with our parents? See, I can add this to the list of reasons why I despise Dumbledore. Anyway, you're no fun to fight with when you’re pale and moody. So feel better soon please. I hate you.
“Tell me the truth! I’m going insane over here trying to figure this all out and I can’t, and I want to help you but I can’t if I don’t even know what’s going on!”
“No, no no no. Snape was-he was supposed to be-shite. We need to find Mcgonagall he’s going to let the Death Eaters in, Draco.” She made to face him, even though he could not see her expression clearly in the dim light he could tell that she was bloody terrified.
“I have something for you.” He brought his eyes back down to look at him, carefully he took a thick envelope out of his robes and handed it to Draco. He took it, raising his eyebrows and bringing his fingers to the seal to open it. However Severus shook his head sharply.
Sincerely,
“My mind? Luna what-?”
“Yes, I didn’t want to. But it made sense. I guess.” She turned back to study him.
“Why of course! I knew your grandfather after all!” Slughorn seemed to always speak in a disgustingly happy tone.
“Oh.”
“Look.” He started, fumbling for a good reason. He was about to continue when there was a flash of light and Harry collapsed. For a second Draco thought he was dead, and he raised his wand to kill whoever had done so, but it was only Severus. Of course it was.
Sincerely,
“Er-yes? I am quite alright thanks for asking. And you?” he said awkwardly.
Dear Potter,
“I know you don’t mean that.” Potter said, his voice rising.
Draco practically flung himself into the barrier after waving goodbye to his mother. He was free. Not forever. And for who knew how long, but he was free for now.
“I’m gonna take that as a yes then.” she sighed and looked tired all of a sudden. “Look, I won’t tell anyone, alright? Just please, please be careful.” She massaged her temples and groaned. “Come on Harry, everyone’s been wondering where you went. And Draco too, Snape was looking for you.” Tonks turned her eyes upwards and heaved a great sigh.
Sincerely,
Draco
“Well I do.” Draco said hotly. “So just go, go on with your life and leave me out of it.”
“Really?” Potter was grinning like an idiot and so was Draco. What was happening. He was so happy, so happy, so happy he couldn’t think. Draco nodded and was fully intending to lean in when a gasp broke them apart. It was his cousin. Tonks.
Draco tried to take a breath, however he ended up choking on air and hacking.
“You scared me.” Draco said flatly, brushing himself off and turning to face his godfather.
He felt a jolt of anger and annoyance. Why did his godfather always have to intrude on everything he did?
Voices pulled them apart and both of them glanced at each other, embarrassed.
“I see. What exactly-”
I have to inform you of something extremely important. It seems I have developed some sort of liking for you. Now I have no idea how, or why this has happened to me. But it changes nothing. I can like you and hate you at the same time, trust me. I’m Draco Malfoy after all, if anyone can like and hate someone at the same time I can. Well that was all I had to tell you. I hate you and like you. Lucky me.
“Er, coffee for me.” Harry said.
“Yes, they’ll be safer now.” Safer...Draco stopped walking, his mouth opening in shock.
“Why are you so stressed Draco?” Luna had asked him, her eyes wide with worry.
“I already told you, sleeping.” He shook himself a little.
“Oh I didn’t mean anything by it, just-”
“What?” Weasley snarled.
“Ay, student out of bed.” Flich said in a low voice. Draco could practically feel his smirk. Honestly, didn’t he have anything better to do?
“Look if you really do love Harry then don’t give up. He’s being stupid right now but when isn’t he?”
Sincerely,
Sincerely,
“Er, right, I would. But the thing is-”
“Draco…” she began.
“It’s not always my fault, I’m not going to let people walk all over me!”
“I trust Draco.” Luna said firmly, without the usual airiness to her voice.
Sincerely,
“Okay okay! I will. So I still had one of these in my bag.” Hermione reached inside her pocket and pulled out the little gold coins they had used to communicate. Ginny opened her mouth but Luna nudged her, more firmly this time.
“I know you found the answer! Okay, but that doesn't matter now because what if-” A sob escaped her and she left the room. A door slammed upstairs. What if you die?
“Yes, no, not worse. He just won’t be happy with me for letting Granger get so far ahead and all.” Draco shrugged like it was no big deal, even though it actually was.
“Let me get this straight.” He drained the last of his coffee and grimaced at the coldness of it. Coffee was rather disgusting when it had been left out for too long. They had been here for over an hour, however no one seemed to be paying them any mind.
That’s what the message said. Shite. The only thing Granger had to say about this whole situation was shite. Which was true, clearly, but bloody unhelpful. He ignored the stitch in his side as he flung himself down the stairs. Honestly he was surprised Filch hadn’t come running by now. His heart nearly stopped when he saw a hand stick itself out of a classroom and wave furiously.
“Get out of here Malfoy!” Weasley yelled. Draco wasn’t sure why he was yelling. He hadn’t even done anything this time. Potter met his eyes briefly, Draco could not read the expression on his face. An overwhelming desire came over him to run his hands through Potter’s hair and kiss him. His face grew even redder and he quickly ran the other direction, for he feared if he was there a moment longer desire would overcome him and he would do exactly what he wanted.
After settling in, he realized that he had nothing to do but wait. And soon after that, he realized that he was much too chicken to go wandering about Muggle London by himself. No matter how much he was excited about the prospect of sitting in a cafe and drinking the strongest cup of coffee possible. But no, that was not in the cards for Draco. He flopped on top of his creaky bed and stared at the ceiling mournfully. He was turning out to be a complete failure at all of this war rubbish. He shut his eyes firmly, and fell into a fitful sleep.
“Okay, yes. That makes sense. How are we going to go about breaking him out?” Draco couldn’t help but feel slightly hopeful. Even though Harry would no longer remember him, he could be safe. Key word could. No news had gotten out yet about Harry being held prisoner, or if he was dead or alive, so that was good he supposed.
“We know things about the real world!” Susan Bones said angrily.
“No.” Draco crossed his arms and glared at him. “You’re the one who brought it up.”
“Would you...go to the ball with me?” he asked. Immediately her face brightened and she grinned,
Malfoy
“Run.” Severus placed his hands on both sides of Draco’s face and nodded solemnly. It was the most affection Severus had ever shown him. Hell it was more affection than his own father had ever shown him. He didn’t know what to think anymore. Who was this man? Why did he kill Dumbledore but continue to show Draco tenderness?
Dear Potter,
“No you don’t know. He kissed you Draco, remember?”
Color rose to her cheeks and Hermione stood as well, crossing her arms angrily.
“And I brought the invisibility cloak and waited outside.” Hermione continued, ignoring Ginny. Well that was sort of smart. At least she hadn’t broken in.
Tom opened his mouth, and Draco sensed that he was about to ask what his last name was, however he abruptly shut it and shook his head.
“What?”
Madam Pince glowered at them for several seconds before sweeping away with one nasty look back. Harry was standing stiffly, rocking back and forth.
“Yeah, yeah of course. That sounds good.” He tried to smile, except his mouth ended up turning down instead of up. She frowned but made no comment of it.
Dear Potter,
“Anyways, that doesn’t matter now. I made a new friend.” she said happily.
“Hey.” Potter whispered, his breath pleasantly brushing Draco’s face.
“Told. You.” Hermione gasped, raising a finger at Draco.
“Yes, yes here. How much?” After paying Tom, he showed Draco a small, dingy room upstairs. It smelled like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages, and there was an odd heaviness in the air that clung to his skin. He was a tad worried that a rat would come and gnaw at his toes in the middle of the night, but he tried to shove his thoughts to other places. He could just stay here until morning. And then at the crack of dawn he would go to Gringotts and take some money out of account and exchange it for Muggle money. After that he supposed he would just have to wander all over Muggle Britain and pray that he somehow picked up some clues on the Order along the way. Because that was most definitely a brilliant plan.
Luna just told me about the D.A. I understand why she didn’t tell me about it earlier. Because she gets to go nearly every single week to see you, and I know I will never be able to. My fathers weekly letters hang over my head as reminders of what I’m supposed to be. Honestly I’ve given up on hating you. Pretending is enough work as it is. But I think it’s great what you're doing. Luna told me that she would teach me some of the things you’re teaching everyone. That’s nice of her, although I can’t help but wonder if my father wasn’t completely terrible if I would have the courage to show my face at one of the meetings. I can almost imagine what it would be like to go, and see you, and learn from you. I can feel your gentle hand on your arm, guiding me the right way. Good grief. These letters always tend to get very rambly. The whole point of this letter was to tell you that Severus knows about the D.A. And so does Dumbledore. Severus told him, obviously. But they’re not going to say anything. When Severus spoke to me about it, he almost seemed impressed. Which was actually pretty funny. These days I suppose I can day dream about what it would be like if you actually managed to kill the dark lord and all of us would be free from this trap. I should probably do something normal now. I just watched you bite your really really nice lower lip, and fuck. I’m done. I can’t. This is a torture. Actual torture. I’m having chest pain. And my stomach is going all warm and fuzzy. Please help me. Anyone. Someone. Oh no. You’re looking at me. And you look so cute. Why are you so cute Potter? Why does the sight of you send a fizzy feeling from my head to my stomach and then my toes. You’re looking at me and I’m furiously scribbling like a lunatic. I think I’m going to vomit. Oh good. Severus just took some points. Class must almost be over. Finally. Bye Potter. You’re terribly beautiful.
“NO!” A shrill voice shot through the collected voices. “HE’S RIGHT THERE!” Screams began as people surged towards where Harry and Ginny had begun sprinting towards the fire places.
“You’re going to kill him?” His voice shook even as he tried to keep it steady. Severus looked pained for a moment so briefly Draco almost didn’t catch it. But it was there nonetheless.
“You go on, I’ve got to check something.” he muttered to his friends.
“Stand back please.” He said in a low voice, raising his wand. Harry narrowed his eyes but did as he said.
“Draco?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. Then she saw the look on her face and she paled. “What is it? What happened?”
Your worst enemy
Dear Potter,
Dear Potter,
“Dear Merlin.” muttered Blaise, looking upward. Pansy shook her head and sighed,
The twins glared at him for a moment longer before clapping Harry on the back and leaving.
Hermione’s smile fell and she shook her head hastily. “No, we can’t just up and leave! We need a plan to make sure everything goes smoothly. I mean none of us can go waltzing into Hogwarts.”
The tightness in his chest eased a little but not completely. “Okay then. And you can ask me anything.”
“Please…” Draco began, and then it hit him. He did not have to do what Severus said. He was good enough at occlumency to hide this from the dark lord. And he would teach Harry to do the same. They could occlude from Severus and the dark lord. If they truly were careful, neither of them would ever know. He didn’t say anything else, only waited in what he hoped resembled resolute silence.
It didn’t take long for Draco to realize that he knew absolutely nothing about Muggles. Shite. He should've taken Muggle studies. Their currency was bloody confusing. Pounds and pence. He couldn’t understand any of it. After nearly an hour of talking with a more and more confused innkeeper, he managed to get a room inside the Motel Mirth. Draco was quite surprised to find that it looked much like his room inside the Leaky Cauldron.
Dear Draco,
“Legilimens.” He was immediately flung into Harry’s mind and memories zoomed past. Damn. His mind was the furthest thing from clear. Then he felt himself come up on a wall. And the memories stopped. He was pushed back into the presence and he immediately grinned.
“I didn’t mean for this to happen.” he whispered, unsure his voice could go any louder than this.
Love,
She wasn’t exactly wrong. Draco was still very stupid for getting himself into this situation in the first place.
“Good. That way you’re out of danger and you can help us. Anything else you have to tell me? Anything that could help us?” She folded her hands together and leaned forward once more, her eyes now shining not with tears, but with anticipation.
A knock sounded on his door and he quickly brushed thoughts of Potter from his mind.
“Shite.” Potter stepped away abruptly and Draco nearly fell over. He was sure he looked exactly like a tomato. Ms. Norris was watching them with her head tilted. Flich must be nearby.
“Hello.” Draco said with a grin.
Draco flushed, his father would be furious. Severus studied him for a minute before continuing.
Sincerely,
He swallowed. “I’m not mad at you Luna.” He was a bit angry, sure, but not at her. He was annoyed that she had left him for Ginevra and Potter, but he could understand.
Draco and Harry stared at each for an odd moment before bursting into laughter.
“No, Draco. You are a Malfoy, you cannot be friends with Harry Potter. You’re too young to understand but promise me you will not befriend him.”
“Does that actually work?” Harry asked curiously, tilting his head.
“You...okay?” Theo asked slowly. Why was everyone asking him that today?
“Not yet. You’ll know when.”
Draco folded his arms and turned to her sullenly. “Yes.” He said stiffly.
“Oh I’m sorry I’m acting like a bloody idiot. I just really love love.” She covered her mouth with her hands to try and contain giggles, but they spilled through her fingers.
“What-what, no!” He said. “You’re not coming with me!”
“What do you want, Weasley?” he snapped.
“I’m sorry, hey it’s okay.” Tears had started to pool from her eyes and she wrapped her arms around herself.
Dear Potter,
“Silence Mr. Potter! Children do not speak unless spoken to.”
“Hide. He wanted you to hide. From what? Oh this is terrible, we have to tell a Professor.” Her face was tight, he had never seen her like this before. It was scaring Draco to pieces.
“We?”
“It won’t be.” she said darkly.
“I know you guys do, but after everything I have a hard time believing he’s really on our side.”
The song came to an abrupt end and Potter practically sprinted away from Patil. He joined Weasley over in the corner and both of them leaned their heads together in conversation.
He was only unnoticed for a few seconds, because when he realized Hagrid was holding Harry’s body, an animal-like sound shot out of him and he fell to his knees. He didn’t recognize the sound that was coming out of his mouth. It was painful for his own ears to hear.
“Blinky will be here the whole time of course, and we’ll firecall every couple hours-”
“I don’t.” Draco said, trying to think of a way out of this. “Obviously, not.” Granger was looking from Weasley to Potter and then to him and back again. She seemed worried, her eyes bright and hair a little more frizzy than normal.
Dear Potter,
“About what?” Draco snapped, not really understanding why he was feeling annoyed. He didn’t say anything for a while and Draco started to wonder if he had left.
“Muggle London is huge, how the bloody hell is that supposed to help us!” Someone in the crowd yelled.
“I know nothing excuses what he just did.” Ginny began.
“I can’t believe her! She knows people who died in the first war for goodness sake! More people are going to die no matter what, and-and-”
“Er-yeah. He’s come almost every day actually, he doesn’t talk though. It’s kind of creepy.” He shrugged and came to stand next to Draco. He was shaking, his left hand kept twitching oddly.
“I was just-just-”
“Well, want to come study with me so you can talk to it more?” he asked, not really sure why.
“My father sent it to me so he could prove to me just how small Weasley’s house was.” Draco said suddenly. It was an awful thing to say, he was well aware. And his father had sent a note making fun of the Weasley family, but Draco had never intended to bring that to light.
“About what?” he demanded.
After a long slurp Ginny said, “You wrote him another letter didn’t you.”
You owe me. I saw you in Borgin and Burkes. I saw you inside that cabinet. You make as much as a racoon, Merlin. I’m surprised Mr. Burkes didn’t open the door to make sure the cabinet wasn’t possessed. That’s besides the point. I saved your skin today. And you might not know that, but I saved you. I thought about saying something. I could make your day bloody miserable. But I didn’t. Why? I don’t really know. You just looked so...scared. And, well, it wouldn’t have been right to give myself the upper hand. We need to be on equal footing. That’s all. Anyway, we conversed later on in the bookshop. Don’t you think Lockhart is a self absorbed prick? Not that I care what you think. It’s simply that I found him to be rather annoying, forcing you to stand there and take pictures for the press. You looked uncomfortable there. Once again, not that I care. I do want to apologize for my father’s behavior though. It bothers me when my father drones on and on about Malfoy manners and such, but he can’t even be bothered to have a civil conversation whenever I’m around. My father was very rude today, and I’m not sorry exactly. Merely troubled I suppose. I know I should want to be like him but I really don’t. He has no manners, and he pretends he does. Which in my opinion is even worse. Now I don’t know why I’m telling you this. It appears I don’t know many things after all. Probably why Granger is beating me in all of my classes. I better go study now. Bye Potter.
Around Christmas time they managed to reunite with the others, only to have Harry’s wand get broken by a snake (or a spell Draco honestly had no bloody idea). Once Harry realized that they had the sword he had yanked a locket off from around his neck and killed it. Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to know what that was about. All too soon after that Luna had gone to visit her father, only to discover that he was dead. He had been killed by Death Eaters for writing the truth in the Quibbler. All of them felt stung by her loss.
“Er-I don’t know what you want me to say to all that.” Draco said haltingly.
He recognized his own owl, and one who he did not know right behind it.
“I’ll go find them and we’ll tell everyone we can that you’re back, you and Draco look for the snake.” Her gaze focused on Draco. “Are you going to be alright?”
“It doesn’t matter how I know, what matters is-”
Malfoy
Draco let go, and Potter performed the spell once more. The pillow they were supposed to be summoning flew towards them and landed softly on the desk.
Dear Potter,
“Shite, were all of these letters to him?” Ginny addressed Draco, regaining some of her composure.
I’ve just been scarred for life. I heard a broom closet rattling and I thought there was a boggart in there. But oh no, there was no boggart. There was one Ginny Weasley and one Luna Lovegood making out like the world was about to end. I got scared. I started having these feelings. Because Luna is like my little sister who is much much much smarter than me. And she’s all grown up now. Making out with someone in a broom closet. I don’t know why but I was so happy for her I almost started crying when I saw them. Ginny slammed the door in my face and I could only assume they continued to make out. Wow. I feel a lot of things right now Potter. And I just wanted to tell you because my last letter was oh so dreary. I think my best friend has a girlfriend. AHHHHHHHHH.
“Your body.” That certainly had not been what Draco was expecting.
“I thought you might be dead. I heard-I heard things over the summer, and I worried for you and when you didn’t respond…” She choked off and pushed him weakly. “Why didn’t you respond?”
Draco could not believe that Potter had run away from the duel with him. They had been about to fight, but he had run off with his singing Valentine chasing him. It was unbelievable. Potter had to be aching for a fight as much as he was. They hadn’t fought since the slug incident, and that wasn’t something that Draco cared to remember. Even though it had been months ago now. Draco had forgotten how good it felt to fight with Potter. How it made him feel awake, how his very blood sang whenever Potter was near him. It was unfortunate that they hadn’t gotten a chance to duel.
Her mouth formed a small “o” before she spoke. “He doesn’t seem like a very good man your father.”
Draco’s heart began to fly. Was Potter going to talk to him?
“I suppose.” she slipped out from a suit of armor, making quite a lot of noise as all of it crashed to the floor.
She took a shuddering breath and squared her shoulders. “Okay then. Be careful.” He was about to tell her to do the same but she took off at a sprint before the words had even formed on his lips. He was left alone in the corridor, waiting for the door to the room of requirement to appear. His stomach hurt terribly as the seconds dragged on for hours. This really hadn’t been a very good idea. Abruptly a door appeared in the empty corridor and Draco sucked in a shallow breath, waiting for them to appear. Slowly, it creaked open, making a long whining sound as several Death Eaters emerged from behind it. His Aunt Bellatrix among them. Her hair was as wild as ever, and her eyes held the same bloody thirsty glint they usually did.
“When?” he asked, after a long silence.
Dear Potter,
“Lumos.” He murmured, holding his wand aloft.
“Of course I do.” she said airly, hopping down from the table. “You and your wrackspurts are splendid friends Draco.” She smiled at him and he couldn’t help but smile back.
Draco set the letter down gently, then wiped at his eyes with one hand. That certainly had not been what he was expecting when he had received a letter from Granger. It was still a shock to him that she had chosen him to confide in, rather than Ginny or Harry. She probably didn’t know how rubbish he was at comforting people. He blew out a breath and lay down on the floor. Suddenly, he felt very tired. He heard the distant murmuring of Harry and Ginny speaking, the sound soothed him into a fitful sleep. The last thing he saw before his eyes fell shut was his box of letters. That really shouldn’t be in the open for anyone to see. Draco reached a hand to grab it and hold it safe, however his eyes seemed to be like weights now and he knew nothing more.
“I won’t until you admit the truth!”
“Okay…”
“We can argue about this later.” Draco broke in, it suddenly hit him what this might mean. “What happened when you went to the address?”
“You alright?” Hermione asked, brows pinching in concern as she observed Draco’s pinched face. He did his best to smooth out his features and school them into nochancalance.
“Nevermind!” She was already skipping away, swinging her arms in the air.
“I was working on my task for the dark lord.” Draco said coldly, clenching his hands into fists.
Dear Potter,
“I know. I bet she likes you an awful lot.”
“We all are.” Ginny replied quietly, not sounding like herself anymore.
“Come in.” He swallowed. His mother opened the door softly. She smiled at him,
Dear Potter,
“That was mine.” he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. He too took out his wand and pointed it at Weasley.
He nodded, “Yeah, hopefully all of this is over soon.”
“Oh?” Draco situated himself closer to Harry and drew infinity symbols on his right arm. Harry shivered a little then said,
What the fuck? “I’m not up to anything. Weasley.” They stared at each other for several seconds.
“Come on, tell us! You worried us sick, we wanna know where the hell you went!” Ginny said, sitting up, nearly knocking Luna off her. Luna tapped lightly on Ginny’s leg, as if asking her to calm down.
“Yes my lord?” he asked. He clenched his hands into fists to stop himself from making a beeline out of the room.
“Sorry,” he called back. “Couldn’t sleep.” He dragged a hand over his face. This was ridiculous. He wasn’t dying. Yes. He was dying actually. Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Harry bloody Potter.
I think Snape might be trying to murder you. He’s very angry about something that couldn’t possibly be your fault. Actually, I take that back. It probably is your fault. Only you would help a criminal escape. Because you're just like that. Since it’s the end of the school year and I will not see you again for a very long time, I am writing this while staring at you. We’re in transfiguration and you're playing hangman with Weasley instead of paying attention. Although I cannot talk. I’m writing a letter to my worst enemy and crush instead of paying attention. I wanted to study you one last time before we get on that train. I know this is probably weird but you’re never going to read this. So it’s okay for me to say I think you’re rather beautiful. I like every single thing about you, Harry Potter. And hopefully the summer will change that. You’re not supposed to like your worst enemy after all.
“Right now?” he asked, suddenly feeling his pulse begin to race.
Severus studied him for a moment before saying, “I’m teaching you occlumency.”
“It’s just me. I’m not gonna-”
“Er-yeah. A lot on my mind is all.” He sighed.
“Goodbye.” Harry whispered. Draco swallowed,
“What’s up with you?” he asked.
“Fine, sing the song.” he rolled his eyes, his stomach tightening slightly with guilt.
“I’ve got it under control.” he snapped, temper flaring. Could he get away with just leaving the room?
“I need you to make an enemy of Harry Potter.”
Once all the students had gotten back, Draco was trying not to look too eager as he sat with Luna in the library. It was taking nearly all of his self control not to run outside and snog Harry in front of everyone. Which was a terrible idea, he knew this very well, but he could certainly dream.
Normally I make it a lot longer without writing to you. But unfortunately this summer was different. However hard I may try I cannot seem to think of anything else besides you. I am still half convinced that I am dying from some sort of illness you have cursed me with. I mean as you are well aware we have been enemies since as long as we have known each other. And I obviously still despise you. It’s simply that now this strange fluttering feeling arises inside of me when I think of you. It’s rather terrifying if I’m being perfectly honest. I can’t stop thinking about you and some absolutely insane part of me wants to believe that wherever you are, you’re thinking of me too. However on the other hand I absolutely loathe you and the very ground you walk on. You must have cursed me to this terrible fate because it brings you joy to watch me suffer so. And this truly is suffering believe me. Can you even begin to fathom what it is like to think about someone all damn day and have this stupid sickening feeling always swirling in your stomach? And worst of all this weird warmth that creeps into every part of you and spreads to your face by mention of your name. You have done this to me Potter. This is all your fault. Even though for some deranged reason I find you attractive, I shall forever feel nauseous by the very mention of your name.
“I can’t.”
Shite. He supposed that made sense but they really shouldn’t stay here much longer.
The invisibility cloak was thrown over them and Draco marveled in the sensation.
I should have expected this from you. You truly do have the most insane hero complex. You’re the bloodiest Gryffindor in the history of Gryffindor. I don’t really know what to say here anymore. Everytime I think you’re going to die I get all panicked and it fucking sucks. I don’t want to care about you Potter. I want to be able to live my Potter free life. Instead I have to worry about you and whether or not you’re finally going to die. I wish more than anything that this world could be normal and I could wrap my arms around you. I wish that you weren’t Harry Potter and I wasn’t Draco Malfoy. I wish we were just too normal boys and we could fall in love without having to worry about tournaments and blood purity, and the stupid dark lord. Screw all of this. I want to be your boyfriend. What has befallen me? Why have I been cursed to think about you all day long. Why? I don’t have anything else to say. I guess I’m glad you didn’t die.
“It’s...Draco. Malfoy.” He sputtered, trying to get a grip on himself.
“Well don’t expect any of us to go with you.” Blaise said, rolling his eyes.
Potter had officially ruined Draco’s Christmas. And he wasn’t even at Hogwarts. Draco had chosen to stay at Hogwarts due to his father’s very annoyed letter about his terrible grades. Which were not actually terrible just still behind Granger’s, as they had always been. And beg Severus to tutor him. Even though he knew he didn’t actually need it. Merlin knew if he could stop staring at Potter during class he might be able to pull ahead. But he no longer knew how to keep his eyes off of Potter. Even when he wasn’t looking at him he was constantly in his head. Which was absolutely awful. Draco drew in a frustrated breath and flopped over a chair.
“Malfoy.” said a voice in his ear. He screamed, not bothering to hide his shock and terror.
“We can fight for fucks sake!” She yelled frantically. Even through the pain Draco could hear that her voice was thick with tears.
“And our whole team!”
“Oh, alright. Thanks?” He coughed into his hand. “I'd better be going now.”
“About what?”
“You mean to tell me that you couldn’t wait for one of us before leaving?” Ginny stormed back into the room and pushed a glass of water into Luna’s hands. She placed her hands on her hips and glared at Hermione angrily. “Look what happened to you! Why are you doing this to us Hermione? Why are you doing this to yourself?” Furious tears were welling in her eyes as she gestured at Hermione.
Draco whipped his head to look at Harry. “Are you mental? What if someone recognizes us?”
“Wait, Malfoy.” Granger stopped him as he made to get up from his seat in arithmancy. He froze, slightly scared for his life.
Sincerely,
“Fuck you.” He said, surprised at the amount of venom in his voice. Harry flinched and dropped the box. It fell to the floor with a soft clack.
“I’m sorry Draco, I know you didn’t want to tell anyone because well...You know. But we don’t have any other options! There are literal Death Eaters in the castle!” She buried her face in her hands and grabbed at her hair. “Okay.” She muttered to herself. “Okay. Let’s go, we should go to Mcgonagall I think.”
He opened his mouth to ask when he would see him again, but Harry had already left him standing alone, hidden behind the curtain. He blew out a slightly frustrated breath and left the curtains after counting to ten.
“That’s fine mum.” he said, suppressing a sigh. What were his parents doing all of the time? His father barely talked to him anymore, except to nag him about his grades. And his mother...his mother loved him, he knew that much. But nowadays she was always looking over her shoulder and staring at Draco as if he might disappear any second. It was quite a bit frightening to be perfectly honest. He missed the days when she was carefree and would laugh when he made a silly face of some sort.
“Yeah, yeah I’m alright. Finishing chopping these roots will you.”
“I don’t know, I don’t know! I was talking to Ginevra and she told me all about it. Apparently her brother and his friends from Gryinffdor are very upset about it.” Luna shook her head furiously. “I don’t understand why they would do such a thing! It’s not like Buckbeak did anything wrong.” A tear fell from her lashes.
Luna crossed her arms and rolled her eyes. “Okay, whatever. I think wrackspurts are crowding your brain at the moment. Go clear your mind.”
“WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?” Madam Pince bellowed, coming into view. All three of them immediately stiffened.
“I know…” Her voice was weak, and he could tell her breathing was heavy. “I know about you and-and Harry.” He swung the door open and there on the doorstep was Hermione. Bleeding all over it. There was a gash on her side that was rapidly leaking blood. The fuck?
“What happened? Where were you? I tried to come after you, I thought you were with Dumbledore and you were gone-”
“I don’t know, but I do know that both of you feel very strong things for each other and that you cannot be kept apart forever.” Oh but Luna. There’s someone called the dark lord who wants me to be a death eater. And we all know Potter is the hero of the wizarding world.
He heard the creak of a bed and hurried down the stairs, not wanting to be caught sitting there.
“Wow, that’s brilliant.” he choked out. “I’m really really glad.” His father clapped him on his back and said,
“Thanks.” she smiled. “I better get back, do you wanna come sit with us?” And for a moment Draco thought about saying yes. He imagined that he was Potter’s boyfriend and he would be reuniting with him after a long summer apart. They would kiss and then he would hold Potter’s hand and smile like an idiot for the rest of the train ride.
“About what exactly?” he asked, trying to remain cool and not completely lose it in front of him.
She blinked and turned her head a little. “Figure out what?” He winced, he would need to be more careful with his words.
Severus gathered Harry in his arms and inclined his head towards the stairs. “Lead the way then.”
“Okay.” Hermione whispered to herself and broke into a run down the corridor. Draco gave Harry a glance before following after her, even now his heart was pounding softly in his chest, the way it always did whenever Harry was around. They were nearing Gryffindor tower when a huge crash echoed through the castle and bone chilling screaming began.
“Course, course. And who are you my boy?”
Sincerely,
“Oh my...This is quite the predicament.” Granger shook her head and resumed pacing. “Okay, okay.” She began muttering to herself then stopped to turn and face him.
Draco Malfoy
He was a traitor, did you know that cissy? Bellatrix’s voice came back to him. Last summer he remembered the hushed (on his mother’s part) conversation, where Regulus came up. He frowned and sat on the edge of the dusty bed, having nothing better to do than to sit there and try to distract himself. He picked up an old picture sitting on the nightstand. In it a young Sirius had his arm thrown around his brother, squeezing him close. Draco blinked. Odd. He wouldn’t have thought the Black brothers would’ve been close.
Borgin was silent for a moment before sighing. “I suppose, but it won’t be easy.” All the better, hopefully it was so complicated it would take most of the year.
“I cannot believe what I am witnessing!” She said in that high pitched awful voice of hers.
Sincerely,
“But-”
Pansy smirked at him. “Come on Draco, you’ve been pining for him.”
A couple days later something extraordinary, and puzzling, happened to him. He was in charms and Flitwick decided that now was a good time for some interhouse bonding.
“Harry?” Granger called. The warmth of his hands vanished, but not before giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze.
Draco froze, unsure of what he should say. After clearing his throat several times he choked out,
“The chamber…” He started, not knowing fully what he wanted to say.
Draco Malfoy
Sincerely,
Draco felt his heart rate pick up. He still cared about him? After everything?
Sincerely your soon to be friend,
I know I haven’t written in a while. But I am so angry at I'm not even sure who, and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t write in a diary. That seems like a bad idea. Anyway that’s not the point. Today Ginvera Weasley wrote you a Valentine. And I had to watch that dwarf come and sing to you. Now don’t think I’m mad because I care about you or something like that. We were going to have a proper duel finally. I was thrilled to at last get to fight with you in front of everyone. Or to fight you in general. It had been much too long since we had last stood mere feet apart, screaming at each other. I didn’t realize how much I missed the excitement of fighting with you until I stood there, facing you. I couldn’t resist the urge to make a snide remark, for I knew that would make you stay. Make you fight with me and ignore everyone around us. Hence the reason I am now pissed beyond belief. Ginny Weasley, the little brat, had to go and ruin it all with her dreadful Valentine. We never got a chance to finish Potter. We will one day though.
“Yes, okay. Harry Potter is-” He broke off, horrified to actually see Harry and Ginny creeping slowly behind the crowd of people. The bloody hell were they doing? They couldn’t find another exit?
“Okay. I’ll come back for you.” He choked out, doing his best to pretend he wasn’t falling apart.
“Yeah Cedric was our friend and You-Know-Who killed him!” Justin Finch Fletchley said, his eyes bright and glistening.
“Shall we call the dark lord then?” Bellatrix asked, already clasping her forearm eagerly. Draco could feel his heart pounding in his throat. What had he done?
“Alright...You owled me earlier?” he asked.
Draco had to admit, Potter was rather good on a broom. Which he would’ve expected before...Well that didn’t matter now. What mattered now was that he and Potter were enemies. And Potter actually appeared to be a worthy opponent, unlike everyone else. Enemies, friends. There wasn’t really such a big difference. At least Harry Potter wasn’t out of his life entirely. That was all he could really ask for. He held the letter for a moment more before slipping it amongst the rest of the letters. He should really stop writing these.
Draco soon gave up trying to eat and perched on a chair, knee bouncing up and down in a steady rhythm. His mother was sitting next to him, humming softly. She seemed much happier with his father gone as well. Nowadays she actually smiled every once and a while.
Dear Potter,
Draco Malfoy is not in love with Harry Potter. Bloody prat that he is. He only writes letters to him as his own special therapy and coping mechanism for these weird feelings that seem to pop up whenever Potter is around. This odd warm (kinda nice actually) feeling is completely normal. Right? A story about letters, love, and the power of believing in each other.
Sincerely,
“Alright then. Do you want to go first, or should I?”
He was considering giving up and going back to have some dinner when Dumbledore, the minister of magic, and another ministry official walked down to Hagrid’s hut. None of them noticed him, as he was sitting behind a large rock to avoid being seen by anyone. He inhaled sharply, realizing that the three Gryffindors were still inside Hagrid’s hut. Right as they entered, the three of them tumbled out the other side of Hagrid’s hut and ran up the hill right to where Draco was. Draco stiffened and prayed that none of them would see him, but to his utter horror they stopped as they reached the top of the hill, and turned. They stared at each other in shock. He immediately felt himself flush as he stared at Potter. He scrambled to his feet.
Draco Malfoy
Dear Harry,
Immediately proceeding this he heard the dark lord’s voice once more and his mark hurt so badly he was certain he was going to die. Everyone else ran out of the castle, and he thought he heard screams, though he was in too much pain to really focus on anything else. He considered asking someone to run the sword of Gryffindor through him when the pain suddenly stopped and he scrambled to his feet. Outside he heard people yelling, their voices indistinct. His stomach knotted in worry and he slipped outside, glad to go unnoticed.
“Course you did.” Draco said with a fond smile.
Dear Draco,
“It just said Severus on it.” Draco cocked his head, confused. Severus...why would his name be on a coin?
“FIND HIM!” Bellatrix was screaming from atop the Slytherin table. Him. She had to be talking about him. Harry and Hermione had disappeared in the chaos, and he wanted to search for them...yet the thought of Bellatrix finding him and pressing her wand to his throat had already burned itself into his brain. And he was too fucking scared to go looking for them with her right there. So he ran. Again. Intending to find Luna and take her with him. Where, he did not know. Just away. Away from whatever was going to happen. He didn’t find her. He was searching the library when Amycus found him and told them they were going home. That the dark lord wasn’t going to be happy with him but he would still have earned glory. At first Draco hadn’t understood. Glory? Amycus had scoffed and looked at him like he was an idiot. Yes, glory. You’re the reason we were able to take over Hogwarts. And fuck, while we were at it we captured Harry Potter.
Draco sniffed. “Fine.”
“Bloody hell how did you do that?” Weasley demanded from across the room. Potter shrugged sheepishly, a blush rising to his cheeks.
Sincerely,
Luna’s eyes filled with tears of worry. “What if someone broke in? That’s not...not possible right? We put up wards…”
“I was-” He swallowed thickly. “I was forced to take the dark mark, as a punishment for my father’s failures.” Granger’s eyes grew wide but she said nothing.
“Oh, hi Draco.” she sighed.
Hey everyone! So just a heads up this chapter is like almost completely AU. And sorry this took so long to get out but it took foreverrr to write. And beware of angst. Lol. Okay anyway the next chapter should be up in like 2-3 weeks or so because I expect it to be very long. Sooooooo, yeah. Hope you enjoy this chapter because it was a headache to write. Thanks for reading! <3
“I know, I’m sorry.” She repeated, eyes still closed. Vaguely, Draco heard a door creak open and he realized Luna and Ginny were probably listening to their conversation.
The dark lord came to my house again to remind me of my task. As if I could forget. I don’t know how you’re able to say his name. I can hardly talk in his presence. I’m actually rather surprised he didn’t kill me after how much I stuttered. It was just him and I this time, and that made the whole thing much more terrifying. Aunt Bellatrix practically leaped into the room after he had left and gave me a hug. Which was extremely disturbing. She’s over the moon that I’ve gotten the “opportunity” to do this task. It’s as if she’s pretending she doesn’t know the whole thing is a punishment for my father’s failure. She kept giving me tips on how to slyly murder people and Potter, she had this excited look in her eye that made me realize just how many people she has killed. I’m living in a house with two murders. I’m guessing it would’ve been three if my father was still around. Well at least I can go to Hogwarts now. I have never been more thrilled in my entire existence to get away from this place. I cannot wait to be out of his presence and free to actually talk to my friends again. I know I could still talk to you, but you don’t count. We’re not friends. We’re worst enemies (who kind of sort of are in love with each other maybe?). Oh, my mother’s calling. She sounds sad. I am leaving her alone with the dark lord and her...sister. I better go.
“No, no I’m-I’m ill.” he groaned and sat up.
“Bombarda will probably work the best for breaking the cell. I’m not sure alohamora will work this time.”
He had thought they would’ve left him alone after that, but he soon learned he was mistaken when soon after he had entered Borgin and Burkes. Out of the corner of his eye he glimpsed three unmistakable shadows. Damn. Of course the golden trio had followed them. No matter, they had no way of finding out what he was doing.
“Who’s there?” he hissed back. “I can take points you know.”
“Ready?”
Sincerely,
“Yeah. My letters.” He gritted his teeth and glared at Harry. How could he? How could he read every single one of those letters? He must’ve been asleep for a while, if he had had time to read all of them. Harry had grown so pale his lips had started to go white.
Hermione Granger truly is the brightest witch of her age. I can’t believe she hangs around with you and Weasley all the time (no offense). All this time she was here and we never even talked! Save for the times I would insult her because I was a senseless prat, those don’t count alright? Anyway I meant to say that she comes up with the most ingenious plans. Honestly if you and Weasley listened to her more often you wouldn’t have ended up in half those deadly scenarios. She told me quite a bit about him, I think she’s in love with Weasley. Don’t tell her I said that though, I nearly asked her about it but it seems she knew what I was thinking and shot me a deadly look. That’s really besides the point though. We might all actually make it out of this alive Potter, how incredible is that! Here’s our new and improved plan;
You’ve gone back to pretending I don’t exist. This feels like last year after that kiss, except so much worse. I’m sorry, okay? But I had my reasons, I know that fact doesn’t excuse me from hiding this from you, believe me I know. I just didn’t know what to do. More like I didn’t know how to tell you, I was scared you would never look at me the same way again. Though I don’t have to worry about that now, you’ll probably never look at me for as long as you live. It doesn’t feel good to be invisible. Luna doesn’t understand what’s going on and I don’t know what to tell her. She deserves the truth but it will just put her in danger as well. I know you didn’t tell her about what I am, or else she would’ve confronted me by now most definitely. I wonder if you ever will. A part of me wants to tell her, because I know that she will be sympathetic and understanding as she nevers fails to be. I don’t like this feeling of loneliness. How could everything go from being so great to being so lonely and terrible? I can’t talk to my best friend about what’s going on and my (ex) boyfriend won’t even glance my way. Not to mention that all of this screws with the extremely flimsy plan that I had come up with. Well I’m not going to think of anything else because really, there is nothing else I can do short of killing Dumbledore myself. I’m just hoping that you don’t have me enough to dismiss the truth.
Sorry about my last letter. I was interrupted by my mother and the dark lord asking me to take the mark. No, I’m not joking. That was actually what happened. I’m a fucking death eater. I hate everything. At least he’s gone for now, I have no idea where he went and I couldn't care less. I have the house to myself right now actually. Mother and my Aunt have gone somewhere, Aunt Bellatrix looked like she was trying to stop my mother from doing something but I couldn’t imagine what. My Aunt was terrifyingly thrilled that I had “finally” accepted the dark mark. You should’ve seen the way her eyes gleamed when I showed her the new mark on my arm. I could hear my mother crying half the night after I was branded. I sat here and pondered my new task. I have to kill Dumbledore. The headmaster. The dark lord wants me (ME) to kill the most powerful wizard in the world. I am fairly sure he has given me this task so that I can fail. There is no way in the entire wizarding world that I could kill him. First of all, I don’t want to. And secondly, even if I did, there is literally no way I could. I mean, he’s Dumbledore. He’s on chocolate frogs and has entire volumes written about him and his achievements. I, a 16 year old boy, am somehow supposed to murder him? No, no of course not. This is a punishment for my father’s failure in getting something done for him. So naturally I am the one who faces the consequences. I wonder how my family got involved with the dark lord in the first place. Not that it matters now. I’m already stuck in this fate so there’s no use thinking about everything that could’ve been. Well this has been depressing. I think I will mope around and try not to think too hard.
