“How magnanimous of you.”
, for Merlin’s sake. But he had to admit that there was something enchanting about the twirl of Malfoy’s hand as he applied the topping.
“Yeah. Just, the hearing tomorrow. This was brilliant, Hermione, it was. But I’m worried it’s too late, and not enough.”
Malfoy smiled. “And to think: I haven’t even started.” His hot hands smoothed down Harry’s thighs, squeezing, thumbs grazing the most sensitive skin of the inner thighs.
Hermione is waiting for Harry at the entrance to the courtroom.
“Exactly.” Robards’ mouth is set in a hard line.
Harry felt a creeping nervousness as they turned down a two-lane road flanked by thick forest, though he didn’t know what he had to be nervous about.
, Hermione’s voice says in his mind.
“He owns it,” Harry said faintly. Then, “You’re really not kidding.”
“Hermione, you’re the one who suggested I take the occlumency training,” he’d joked.
One day, while he sat there, the floo burst to life and he jumped half out of his skin.
“Please. Harry. I saw the way you looked at Oliver’s ass.”
remedies to the muggles, but that was hardly Potter’s business, anyway. He finished with a grand, “I always knew you were dense.”
“If Mrs. Malfoy had just waited for this announcement, she wouldn’t be in her… predicament,” he says, his ‘but what can I do?’ attitude spurring the courtroom to snickers. Draco asks himself, for a brief, horrid moment, if Fiendfyre can be called forth without a wand.
“I, no,” Potter says, “why?”
Potter comes in any time from six to eight PM every other day, avoiding rush hour and choosing the table with the best vantage point in La Villa (near the entrance, back against the wall, easy view of the entire restaurant and out the windows). He rarely ever summons Tessa and only sips on wine when Draco cleans the tables. The hype has died down about his patronage and Draco’s existence, Ms. Remington has stopped running her mouth, so generally, it’s been peaceful.
“Ron, shut up, that’s so—”
People’s hearts twinge sometimes. For Draco, he can barely remember the last time he doesn’t have these twinges. It’s pretty normal at this point.
Edmund shakes his head, then blinks. He looks up at Draco, mischief in his eyes.
“I don’t think you’re in the position to be worrying about my clothes, Harry,” Draco says. He glances at the bits of Floo powder fluttering to the floor and continues.
They actually don’t take anything from the safe house if they can help it. The ingredients and potions stored there are expensive to replace, thus they are used exclusively for dire situations, like the new batch of weres. Plus, Voldemort has tightened security these days. Frequent trips to Draco's fellow spy’s cabin are the only way to access Death Eater information anymore without the riskiness of owling and Flooing, or the hassle of one-way Protean charms.
Draco lifts a brow. Grammedion walks to where Draco was standing earlier and plucks his wand off the ground. He tosses it from side to side, getting used to its weight. Then he returns to his place by the window, tapping Draco’s wand against the glass.
“You said there’s something we have to discuss.”
“Sisters,” Edmund says. The hand on Draco’s jaw edges to his neck, thick fingers adding a slight squeeze to the vulnerable valley on either side of his Adam’s apple. Draco sighs into Edmund’s mouth. “Surely you don’t think there’s only one of us out there?”
Closing the window, Draco lowers the heat and ladles the soup out into a wooden bowl. The Griffiths don’t accept any kind of monetary payment for this bowl, which is egregious considering how small their woodworking business is, so he’ll have to think of a thank-you gift for them. Do woodworkers have dry hands? Most likely, with all that sawdust. A lasting, high-quality tub of hand cream should do the trick.
Draco spreads his hands and purses his lips, brows high on his forehead. “What more do you want me to say?”
“You—you,” Potter gestures at poor, innocent Billy, “you can’t stay here just to play with some fucking flying squirrels. What about the Draco Malfoy of this universe? What if the War is still going on and they find you?”
The band that’s resting on the counter is different. Rustic gold and a fissure in the middle, the fertile earth splitting open to reveal a stream of diamonds, a sparkling river. Draco sets his mug to the side and holds the ring up close, his finger smoothing over the grooves of its texture.
“Doll.”
The man paces and looks out the window instead of answering, the moonlight deepening his eye bags. His normally lush beard has grown unkempt, muscles replaced by tired hollows and bony wrists, the form of his skull emphasized by liver-spotted wizened skin. He’s always seemed so steady, immortal, even, that to see him so worn down is frankly disturbing.
Harry sighs inwardly. When he first started this career, he had expected his Master of Death status to be enough for clients to believe him. As it turns out, it usually takes about ten sessions and an expensive investment in the Scale of Truth for them to even start looking at him with something other than polite indulgence. His work has spoken for itself, though, and to his contentment, the number of skeptics is dwindling by the day.
“Wait, you,” Potter’s eyes narrow, “you’re doing well, then. Here.”
“Do what she says,” a voice whispers in his ear. Tessa’s. “Come on, just humor her. Me and Jeremiah will finish up.”
“We have history. Shouldn’t that be enough?”
“Yes, but I’m French.”
"Quite the understatement."
“Wait.”
“What—”
Across the street, a couple strolls through a gushing crowd. Fiery red hair, airy laughter, a pale arm wrapped around her fiancé’s waist. Curls of black, sleek spectacles, a protective palm on his fiancee’s shoulder. They make the perfect picture, a vibrant oil painting. Their existence is formed from bold strokes of sunlight and starburst kisses, with the focal point being a shock of phthalo green and cadmium lemon, two minute specks that make all the difference. As all good paintings do, they pin the viewer on the spot, as if the viewer himself is a thing to behold. Then they shift away.
“Ma’am,” he tries again, “yes, we are near closing time. Therefore, if you order a quick meal as you wait for us to close up, then we shall have our conversation soon after eight. Do you know what you want to order yet?”
Potter’s presence covers up the especially orange tile, and now Draco can look nowhere else but at the many pockets of the man's olive green jacket. Lifting his head remains a horrible idea.
Potter swings his knife with a tad bit more hostility this time but has the sense to not escalate matters. Draco doesn’t mind it; he knows giving Potter something productive to do instead of stewing in thick-headed frustration the entire evening will only benefit the both of them.
“I hate to do this to you, for I have come to value your presence and worldview. But Mr. Malfoy,” Grammedion squats down, elbows on his knees, his face right in front of Draco’s, “it’s not about reputation; it’s about trust. If the head of a team critical to the cause disappoints, who will everyone else turn to? Who can they blame? Who can they trust after that? And by then, your recollection of this discussion would have been wiped, and I’d be long gone.”
“So he did,” Narcissa peers at the yellowed windows as if she can clearly watch the overgrown garden. “How do we know if a spirit is at peace?”
“Healer Yamamoto will tell Potioneers Jensen and Reyes what to bring for werewolf-inflicted wounds,” Draco’s Thestral paws the floorboard; his message is getting rather long. “Other than them, get whomever you deem fit to handle a traitorous spy. Don't ask. You’ll know when you're here.”
He doesn’t know how long his eyes have been closed, so he opens them once more. It’s like… it’s like he’s been floating on thick water and is only recently dragged into shore. Rubbing the creak out of his neck, Draco squints.
"What? No,” he frowns, staring at the steaming bowl of soup on the table, then at the throw draped over his lap. “What the hell’s all this?”
“I’m sorry, that was a shitty thing to say,” Potter says immediately, sweat dotting his temples.
“There you are. I was wondering how much longer drinking water could take.”
Once his thumbprint has been collected, the last step of the process, he Vanishes the ink on his finger. Dr. Stewart raises a brow but says nothing more. She stands up, holding out a hand.
Harry glances at the crown of his head. The man doesn’t sound surprised; Harry wagers that he already knows and decided to make one for the both of them today.
Something leaps in Draco’s chest and splatters on the floor of his stomach. Placing her hand over his heart, Pansy frowns at him. She doesn’t ask why Potter stared at someone who looked like a stranger to him. Only tells him to start finding answers.
“Potter,” Draco gasps, leaning up to try and see. About a hundred meters from the cabin, lurking behind the trees and bushes is a hulking shape, hidden in the dark, but Draco can’t mistake the gold in those gleaming eyes.
“When will you accept that I’m not drugged?” Harry says.
Potter steps closer. A respectable distance away, but closer.
Draco is thankful for having the… opportunity to put on his headlamp, because true to his words, the forest only gets darker. Branches close in on them, humidity clinging to his very being. If his heart stops thundering in his temple, he might let himself hear the sack thudding against Potter’s thigh.
“Yes, those especially.”
“Hmm? Jealous?” Draco presses, “Of what, pray tell? His muscles?”
“I,” Potter raises his brows, “a little. Why?”
“Did you clean yourself in the stream?” Draco crouches and massages the wolf’s head. The wolf replies by panting and licking Draco's healed wrists. “Hmm? How lovely of you, Potter. Dried blood is a bitch to
“Do you really think so?” Potter’s jaw clenches. From here, Draco can see a vein trailing down his arm, his fist tight. “What about me?”
“Fenrir’s attack last month wasn’t accidental.”
Sending the objects back to their original places, Draco takes his seat, brows furrowed. He toys with his wand, a tick he hasn’t been able to be rid of ever since Potter’s returned his wand after years of what seemed to be perpetual emptiness without it.
Potter nods, slowly. Deliberately. “Right.”
“My,” Edmund adjusts without trouble, interlacing his hands behind Draco’s waist, just above his bum. “Must you hurt me so? After all we’ve been through in the past three dates, you want to cast me aside?”
Draco takes it in, then, unable to help himself, curls his lips at Potter and his attire. At his artfully gelled hair, his hanging bow tie, the elegant boutonniere on the lapel of his dark blue suit. His empty ring finger.
Potter does, patting away the dirt at his pants. He Conjures a small sack from a fallen leaf (no words, no
“That was stupid.”
And suddenly he’s the most dumbstruck bastard to ever live.
Light, clean air, silence, and Merlin knows what else, are lacking in abundance in the Malfoy Manor these days. However, with owl posts too easily intercepted and words too eagerly etched on skin rather than blank pages, paper is readily available. Draco has a lot of free time, being ‘Lucius’s worthless son’ and all. Thus, he writes.
Potter opens his mouth. “Is it because I couldn’t get you out of Azkaban?”
Perhaps it’s not even cologne, perhaps it’s all Edmund.
“They have my kids and wands. It’s either this or gutted children, broken wands, a diet of
“Apologies, I can’t stay for long,” Draco says, “It’s the Full Moon, and we’ve got a rogue werewolf on our hands.”
Harry and Ron eye each other, then back at the two.
As if on cue, the person straightens from their position against the wall. They step forward, one foot after the other, slack and loose, into the buzzing light. Draco can’t observe intricate details from this far away—has to wait until tomorrow, apparently—but he still has eyes.
“Good evening, welcome to La Villa,” Draco blows on the paper butterfly. In gentle loops, it flaps to the table as it increases in size, eventually becoming a proper menu. Lovegood catches it mid-air and a giggle bursts from her throat.
Draco leans his head back against the wall. “I take it I won’t be getting out of here any time soon,” he might as well make himself comfortable. “Well, what’s your so-called plan, then? Keep me entertained.”
“For fuck’s sake, boy,” Grammedion fires a hex at Draco’s legs with one hand while he pulls the cloak hood. Freezing static runs up his legs, automatically straightening them and forcing a pained groan out of Draco’s mouth. He lugs Draco’s writhing form to the end of the porch and kicks him down the steps.
He’s not certain about the windows, but there’s no harm in trying. Pulling out the Indicator, Draco wills it to weigh more and swings, brushing aside the ominous creak his shoulder makes. With an ear-splitting crash, the Indicator plunges a decently sized hole in the glass, spidery cracks spanning a portion of the window. Panicked hexes are hurled from the inside, and Draco ducks out of the way. Silver eyes meet gold; in an instant, Potter leaps straight through the window.
“Huh,” he says, sitting down with an ‘oof’, “isn’t this for kids?”
“Oh, of fucking course you still see me like that,” Harry can’t stop himself from snarling. “Have I ever been anything but The Fucking Boy Who Lived to you?”
The judge doesn’t even let Draco finish taking a breath and continues, “Alright. Draco Malfoy, you—”
“Yeah, that took a while, sorry."
“My, oh my,” she gushes, flipping through the menu. “What fun! No wonder Harry always comes here.”
“My mother,” he says, watching Potter’s irises get swallowed up by pure black. “Remember what she did for you, Potter, please. She can’t stay here…”
The Scale of Truth tips heavily to one side, the peacock feather apparently way heavier than the obsidian orb on the other side. The spirit has lied. A lot. Harry frowns and prepares himself for the oncoming fit of jealousy.
Draco’s eyes haven’t left Harry’s face throughout the explanation, and he doesn’t open his mouth once. Harry wishes he’d say something, do something other than bouncing his heel ever so often.
“No,” Grammedion says, “I am a father.”
Draco doesn’t have a reply to that. Potter seems to know this. His eyes close with force, his serious expression distorted with emotion. The hand not being held falls back to Draco’s side as he watches Potter’s head bow, face twisted. Contrary to his expectations—he doesn’t quite know what to expect anyway—Potter rolls Draco’s glove off and turns his hand over. Softly, a kiss is placed upon Draco’s bare palm.
Walking into the kitchen, Harry grabs a glass from the drying rack and pours himself water from the pitcher in the fridge. It’s ridiculous how a simple act like this can drain his energy so, but it does. Curse breaking isn’t a walk in the park; even walking hurts, considering the amount of magic he expends on shite like a 500-year-old wailing locket on a day to day basis. Exposure to different kinds of magic - dark, Old Magick, elemental, countlessly and endlessly more- for 8 hours straight more often than not result in a fierce ringing in his temples and pinpricks on his skin.
“Ow.” A grunt. Harry smiles; most likely a cramp from all the leaning.
“Please, darling, just a sip will do—”
Draco has spoken to Weasley C. three times in total, each conversation spanning about fifteen seconds.
He lunges off the path.
“Might I remind you who here has any actual idea of where Gramma’s Cabin is?” Draco checks his pocket watch. Two hours until sundown.
Months later, on the most awaited day in recent Wizarding history, there’s a knock on Draco’s door.
“Grammedion,” Draco sighs, ignoring the little tidbit about Potter which probably never happened, “you never needed redeeming. You were with us from the start. What changed?”
There is not a sliver of sound in their bedroom but Harry’s harsh breathing.
Harry pulls his hand from his cheek to rub his chin, eyes still a bit glazed over. “When they no longer respond to the ritual’s call.”
They stand there for a few moments more nonetheless, clutching each other. Then Draco sees it. Sees him.
“Indeed it is. Have a nice trip, see you never,” he waves, a jovial smile on his lips. He only holds it for a few seconds. His cheeks hurt nonetheless.
“A few rounds of Crucio may shake the typical person up a little, but it’s nothing they can’t get over. As for me, my hands and feet went a bit numb soon after. It’s not very persistent, I think, not like chronic Muggle neuropathy,” he ignores Potter’s horrified look. “I moved out after the War to not get exposed to Dark magic as much as my parents, so the symptoms just flare up every now and then. Sometimes I touch the stovetop and it takes a moment for it to sink in that I’m getting a burn. Nothing I can’t handle.”
After your first night here, though, you’ll have a lot to ask. The janitorial staff is not allowed to speak to any employee, including you, so read this document carefully. I’d say take pictures of it front and back, but taking out your phone to access them on the job might not be a good idea, especially as the night progresses.
“Considering the fiasco that was my 6th Year, I think you might have to revise that thought.”
But, he feels like doing something different tonight. His joints pop, his knuckles grind. He arches his back and feels the knobs of his spine knocking against each other. He curls his feet, blood rushing to his throat. One moment, his head feels overinflated, overstretched, and the next, he is fine. He is taller now, his jaw sharpened, his neck thick. He spreads his fingers then clenches them into fists.
“Listen to me. How can it not be my business when I feel it, too?”
“Merlin and Morgana,” Draco breathes, “that quick?”
“Yes! Just so you know, I built my own dwelling. It’s stunning, if I do say so myself. Marble floors, 5 balconies. Just added a new pool last month. Plenty of space to… christen, unlike your studio apartment.”
For now, until the Order members come, he’ll take all he can get from Potter’s affection.
“Where, then? We have no bed.”
“Or are you cross I set my sight on him first?”
Draco leans a hair closer, so his voice is clear to no one but the two of them.
Potter nods in understanding. Remus’s new recruiting tactics have yielded tremendous success, and numerous werewolves, newly Turned by Fenrir and his followers and heavy with bitterness, seek out the Order for protection. Draco and his team did brew enough Wolfsbane to last this Full Moon, but ingredients are scarce. If they want to prepare for the next few months, Gramma’s Cabin holds the answer.
He turns to the front door. There it is, a knock. More like a thud, really, like a particular beast is once again barreling into it.
He gets back up on his feet, index and middle finger shakily looping the silver chain of the Indicator and flicking his wrist. The orb flies upward and when it lands on his palm, it returns to its state as a brooch. He pins it back on his cloak, peering at the torn corner at the bottom. That could’ve been his leg.
Draco gasps. Nothing makes sense anymore, absolutely nothing at all.
When the public has stopped its rage against war criminals and deflated to resignation, preferring to just ignore and go on with their day, and when Ms. Remington deems it sensible then to give him more work, and by more work, she means actually serving customers.
Uncrossing her legs, Narcissa strolls to the fireplace with an effortless glide that has been startling in its absence. The pouch she retrieves from the mantle is generous, nearly bursting with coins. When the lazily floating candles extinguish themselves with a hush at the wave of her wand, Harry snaps out of the fuzzy fog that's permeated every corner of his head.
A small smile graces Potter’s lips. “I don’t expect anything from you but honesty.”
“Of course, and I meant. Merlin, you’ve done quite enough. Oh, goodness, that’s pungent.”
The moment he sits back down, Draco’s big toe pokes at his spine. Getting the memo, Harry grins and reclines on the pillows. His left side is flushed against Draco’s right, the kinks in his neck eased off from the angle. They, as per usual, gradually get closer to one another, and at some point, Draco lays his head on Harry’s chest and ear on his beating heart. It’s calming to him, Draco had said when Harry asked, on the third night of their honeymoon. With the war long behind them, there was nothing to fear. Only the constellations existed as their witnesses.
“A blanket fort is a blanket fort,” Draco takes the towel from Harry’s arm and puts the throw pillow Ron knitted in his lap. He hits a button on the laptop in front of them, and Harry’s favorite jazz collection plays. He blinks. He thought Draco would play his questionable atmospheric-white-noise-POV-you’re-having-tea-in-a-gothic-vampire-library playlist, the weirdo.
“No, I was, I’m,” Potter rubs his neck, his hand then falling to the table, a finger rocking against the surface, “we knew she would target you. We decided to get there early and catch her in the act.”
Draco watches him through half-lidded eyes, body numb, his head still pounding. Perhaps it’s the pain that makes his brain-to-mouth filter disappear.
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Draco can feel a headache building. “That was a horrible decision. I never imagined you—you!—out of all people, could be this irresponsible. What the fuck.”
Not bothering with stepping stones, Draco stomps straight into the freezing water. The barrier between the rest of the forest and the area around Gramma’s Cabin. He catches his breath for a split second and turns around to see canine eyes glowing in the headlamp’s light. Potter’s back is bent at a severe angle, the protruding knobs of his spine outlined through the thin shirt. His ears sharpened and his brows are gone. Choppy bunches of fur cover parts of his body, bristled and mangled with dirt and leaves. Head low, his eyes follow every twitch Draco makes, low growls ringing from his thickened throat. Though he’s crouching on the earth, the sheer size of him looms over Draco.
Pain bursts from the back of his head.
I know you must be confused. Why are you finding this raggedy piece of paper in your brand new office? Well, first of all, there’s a reason why they keep this office shiny and clean. If it’s not spotless by sunrise, would anyone take the job?
“I was under the impression that I am to be working at Site-91,” he says, “in Yorkshire?”
A paper crane.
“Depends on the situation.”
“And?”
Draco frowns. “I’ve always wondered. How did she—why wasn’t she brought back to the House, then?”
Harry gives the same answer he’s been giving her every time she asks him this question: a nod.
“Oh, I have no worries about you. You never get difficult, unlike your brethren.”
“I guess I did say I hate-”
Harry squints at her, the pieces in his head drudging through quicksand to connect. They’re getting close, a conclusion’s about to be made, but his body aches and his brain has smoothened with fatigue and. Hmm. He hasn’t eaten since yesterday’s lunch. Must be why he’s fucking beat.
Potter stays quiet. His jacket moves a bit with the gentle wind, and if he still has that mane of hair, it would fall into his eyes, unprotected without glasses. Draco’s eyes widen. Potter isn’t wearing his round glasses. He’s not wearing glasses, period. When did he stop? Has it really been that long?
“I was eating dinner when I thought I was going to die of a heart attack at 23,” Potter continues. Draco pulls the drawers out, unable to find a single bag of tea for several excruciating moments. “The next day, I was reading about your mother’s death on the
“Okay.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco reaches for the object, wrists aching from the iron bands that pulsate with heat. To his confusion, Potter covers Draco's hand with both of his. The man is a furnace, his palms possibly even warmer than the iron bands, the sensation sending volatile, feverish streaks of lightning up Draco’s arms. Potter then tucks an item into Draco’s hand, keeping his hands close by as Draco peers at what he is gifted. His eyes widen.
“Don’t say that to me, say that to—oh, you’d do what you want no matter what I say, wouldn’t you?”
He doesn’t know everything, but he knows enough. He knows enough to be aware that the lore Pansy snorted at when he first mentioned them, the creatures Mother dismissed as another of her bored rich son’s new obsessions, are the same ones Unspeakable Granger narrowed her eyes at when she walked past his table in the canteen and caught a glimpse of his notes. He had a feeling then that he shouldn’t even make any indication that he was interested in these things, which was proven to be correct when Ministry personnel started loitering outside his office more after that day.
Lovegood’s lips stretch into a beatific grin. The straw hat on her head slightly tips to the side, blanketing half of her face in shadows.
“Come,” the Boy King tilts his head. “Let’s take a walk.”
The hand holding the flashlight shivers before righting itself. Intruders always wear a uniform, for some reason, and this one is no different. And yet, this one is quite different, indeed.
“Your usual order from the Viet place nearby whenever Pepper-up isn’t sufficient,” Draco murmurs, placing a spoon in Harry’s hand, his words warm against Harry’s temple. Huh, he didn’t think Draco would notice. “You said today you’d deal with those disgusting booby traps you showed me, thus I reckoned I should put the yams on our counter into good use.”
Either way, I’m the one making sure this paper is found by new hires (perks of being a janitor with all the keys). The higher-ups don’t know this building like I do; they know that people can’t work here for even a week, and that’s it. They don’t know enough to solve the problem, they’re too scared to, and no one bothers to ask an ancient janitor.
As if it can understand English, the sugar glider noses at Draco’s apron strap for a second before clambering down his arm, sailing away before it reaches the bowl. Unlike Muggle gliders, this one’s patagia stretch into a perfect circle as it lands straight into the fruit bowl Draco’s laid out. Eyeing the way it shamelessly gathers as many berries and grapes as its tiny body can handle, he knows its brethren are soon to arrive. The kitchen window is open for this purpose, after all.
There’s a pang in Draco’s chest, and judging from the twitch of Potter’s brow, he can feel it too. Not another word is said, the two men merely facing each other from across a tiny kitchen, considering. Draco can feel the warmth of sunlight beaming through the little window and coating his nape as he leans against the sink, earl grey on his tongue. Lovely citric notes of bergamot drift up his nose. He closes his eyes. What to do, what to do.
“I wasn’t just ‘interested’ in you back in ‘99. I’m not just ‘interested’ in you now, either.”
“I made it,” Draco says, his voice faint.
“We decided on one kiss.”
“...let’s go. It’s getting dark,” Draco says.
“‘Depends on the situation,’ he says,” Draco mocks, getting a carton of milk from the fridge to save his bitter, bitter tea. Potter doesn’t reply. Stirring the milk in, Draco lets out a heavy sigh.
Malfoy blanches and whips out his wand from his thigh holster, and Harry does what he does best.
“Perhaps in another universe?” Potter says. His arms are straight by his sides, his face blank.
Draco is genuinely confused.
Pay attention.
with you!” Draco whirls around, teeth bared. Potter recoils. “You’ve been acting so odd for weeks now. Just what is your preoccupation with making me-”
Draco shakes his head.
Grabbing a rag and wetting it, Draco wipes the countertop even as he’s just done so last night.
“And I’m not supposed to come out to the courtyard.”
Draco flicks his hawthorn wand, a hand squeezing Harry’s shoulder as if he could see the prickling running up Harry’s nape.
The Luna Lovegood before him looks like how she’s always looked. Strange, timeless.
He doesn’t, but what Potter doesn’t know won’t hurt him.
“Fort, fort,” the boy had screamed in Draco’s ear, but he hadn’t flinched. He had nodded and gone along with Teddy’s babbled directions, then sat back on his heels and fixed a wide-eyed stare at the monstrosity Teddy had called a fort (his designing skills were, unsurprisingly, underdeveloped at the mere age of two).
Smith clambers to his feet, eyes sparked with fury, “But they tripped me, didn’t you see?”
“What happened!?”
Theo makes a noise of agreement, knowing all too well what Draco went through during sixth year, and shakes his head in disbelief over the situation. They both pause their conversation once they reach the common room. Draco keeps his gaze forward, avoiding the stares he and Theo are receiving. He can sense Theo’s anxiety, hearing his breaths become more shallow, but Draco knows that he can hide it from others well.
Draco had much time to reflect his life during his stay at the Manor as the ministry most likely wanted him to do. He still doesn’t quite understand why some wizards think it is acceptable to mix with the muggles—they are destructive creatures—but he doesn’t believe this justifies murdering them all in cold blood or ruling over them. Draco would just prefer to live separately from them.
The thought makes him want to laugh; never in a million years did Draco ever imagine he would seek to defy everything that his family and the generations of his ancestors stood for. However, he cares more about keeping his family intact than allowing a megalomaniac to seize reign over the world.
Hermione grimaces, “Please don’t revert back to your Malfoy obsession from sixth year, that was exhausting.”
Ron gawks at her, affronted. “For what?”
McGonagall sends him a glare that in all the years he’s been at this school, has never failed to frighten him into obedience. Without hesitation, Draco immediately fixes his features into a neutral expression and faces her attentively.
“He’s just jealous that even in a dishonorable state, my hair is more tame than his could ever be.”
“How do you know I don’t have you as my target?”
Draco enters the expansive bedroom that no longer feels like his own and fixes his sight on a section of the far wall behind the bed. He walks across the room to the unobstructed expanse beside his bed. Patterns of bright flowers spiral wildly across the bedroom wall, enchanting and vibrant. Upon closer inspection, the design is interrupted by tens of small identical lines, carved one after the other in perfect rows and columns.
Draco smacks his leg, which only gets a laugh out of Blaise.
Pansy dismisses him, waving her hand. “Oh, it’s fine, I’m better than Blaise in bed anyway.”
“Yes! That’s how he was able to get them out so quickly… amongst other things,” she says, her tone indecipherable at the last part.
She turns to him and crosses her arms, leaning against the counter. “And I hear you have a rivalry with that Gryffintwurp… Potter?”
Potter huffs a humorless laugh. “I know you weren’t the one who did it. I don’t think you’d be able to get around McGonagall’s spellwork.”
“Over my dead body.” Pansy responds impatiently.
During defense, Draco continuously fails to conjure a patronus, and he can sense that Potter is itching to help him. Every time Draco turns towards him, Potter immediately averts his gaze. After a few more failed attempts, he sees Potter start to approach him, so Draco hastily excuses himself to the bathroom. Thankfully, Potter doesn’t follow him there this time.
“You can thank Millie for scaring me half to death for that. It appears that I’m her target, and Blaise let her into our bathroom to shoot me this morning. Thankfully, I had my hat with me, but I wouldn’t put it past her to tackle me to the ground regardless.”
“This is preposterous. And McGonagall hasn’t put any of those abhorrent scoundrels in grueling detentions yet? Or any other Professor?”
When McGonagall begins passing out the pieces of parchment, Pansy turns to Draco, bursting with excitement, “This is going to be so fun! I have an excuse to attack people!” She beams, grasping his arm.
He enjoys the silence of the castle as he walks, glad to have a bit of respite from harassers during school hours. If anyone attempted to ambush him at this hour he would most likely have the advantage, for he did not survive the Manor without learning how to detect a person’s precise placement based on the slightest movement.
Draco bursts into laughter and falls back onto his pillow, feeling significantly better about the situation.
After the encounter with Potter in the corridor, Draco can feel Potter’s eyes following him constantly as if he’s going to strike at any minute. He feels trapped, a part of him almost wishing for Azkaban only to escape Potter’s scrutiny.
Pansy arches a brow. “I thought I was your brutish child?”
“But Draco listen—”
That’s three whole classes from now. Draco groans in impatience.
“Hey, it was a serious question!” He defends, tossing the pillow back on Draco’s bed.
Draco knows he still needs to apologize to Granger, and now would be the perfect opportunity to do so. He would rather do anything than return to his table right now. But he’s unable to tame his mind, losing the reins as it spirals outward. Granger’s gut-wrenching screams echo in his mind, a sound that has been permanently seared into his memory. She would never forgive him, how could she? Not when he was associated with the person who did that to her.
Pansy nods, returning to her previous position and cuddling closer to Blaise.
Draco wishes he would just learn not to talk so much.
“Well, is your memory like that?” Theo asks.
Draco laughs a humorless laugh. “Yes. I’d be terribly surprised if I wasn’t.”
But Coach Sylvester doesn’t budge, and Longbottom takes a moment to collect himself, narrowing his eyes into a defiant glare, “If I could kill a bloody twelve-foot snake with the Sword of Gryffindor, then I think I can handle myself in this game, Madam Sylvester,” He responds boldly, not breaking her gaze. Draco hears a few giggles come from the table of Hufflepuff girls, and that seems to put the growing smirk on Longbottom’s face.
Draco sighs. “I will have to rearrange my revision schedule to accommodate, as I am quite busy, but yes that should be fine then,” he says.
- Together, Pansy and Draco plan to ambush Smith after Divination, and when they do, he’s pretty aggravated and in retaliation, he tells everyone it was Draco’s fault
Draco runs straight to his room, avoiding any calls from Pansy and Blaise as he passes them in the common room. He’s in no mood to speak with anyone, seeking to brood over Potter in peace. No one would say anything that would make him feel better anyway.
If he can cast a Patronus, maybe he isn’t such a bad person after all.
As per usual, the explosions never fail to make Blaise jump—earning a whack from Pansy and a remark from Draco. In the end, Greg wins, and the proud look on his face is enough to make Draco’s whole week.
Draco stifles a small laugh and composes himself. “Yes, I suppose so,” he says.
Draco hides the shock that courses through him and curls his lip nastily, “You realize the Great Hall is off limits from the game? Unless someone casted a permanent sticking charm on them, in which case please inform me of who, so I can thank them,” Draco taunts.
“You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting to hear that, Draco,” she says, something heavy present behind her guarded eyes. “Those Gryffindors think they have the moral high ground because they don’t condone the deaths and prejudice of Non-Mages, or Muggles you say, and Muggleborns. But you know who they dont give a rat's ass about? Squibs. They hem and haw about the immorality of treating Muggles as inferiors, and yet overlook us like we’re nothing more than ants on the sidewalk that they can step on.”
As he strides off, he can feel the heated glare from behind him. It’s almost too easy to rile up those two; he wants more of a challenge. When he reaches the doors, he stops to place the hat on his head. He turns back to Potter and Weasley with a sly grin and gives them a wink before exiting the Great Hall.
“What are you up to?”
“Waddle away, Happy Feet! But don’t forget to keep your egg warm!” Coach Sylvester shouts.
“—terrifying, she’s bigger than I am!” Weasley whines.
It took a few minutes of arguing for Ron to finally relent, eventually recognizing that Ginny wasn’t willing to budge on this.
“Unfortunately, no, not this time,” Blaise says with an exaggerated sigh. He turns to Pansy, signature grin returning to his face, “Let’s just say I’ve finally had an influence on someone.”
“Well, I’ve been struggling with Potions and you with Defense, so I was thinking we could help each other out?”
“Harry,” Hermione interjects, frowning slightly, “I think you’re looking too far into it. He just happened to be standing there in the stack over and noticed my book fell. I highly doubt that Draco planned for Seamus to storm in here and cause a scene just so he could approach me.”
“Get, get OFF me!” Pansy wheezes.
Draco grins in delight, glad to have regained the upper hand. “Well, that was quite effective, as well as enjoyable. I believe Gr—Hermione would find good use for that as well.” He moves his arm up to do it again. However, Draco’s second attempt is stopped by Potter’s swift grip around his wrist.
Draco can hear Theo’s heavy sigh, slightly muffled by the door. “I can still enter through my own room, you know. I was just trying to be polite.”
“Because if you did you wouldn’t actually dare to go for me. You’d know better than to do that. Especially considering I’m the one who brings you coffee from the kitchens every morning, made perfectly to your liking.”
Draco isn’t sure if he should be laughing or screaming. He always thinks that
“What the fuck do you want, Smith? Come to continue pursuing your violation of my body? Let me help you. If you let me turn around, I can give you a better look at my arse, because isn't that what you want?” His breathing shallows with each step Smith takes in his direction, trapping him against the wall.
Stupid Potter, thinking Draco fell for that pathetic excuse. He knows Potter doesn’t trust him. Not that he should, mind. He’s going to get that bespectacled git out and he’ll no longer have an excuse to be following Draco around the castle. Potter will have no choice but to admit the truth then.
“So, any progress with your Patronus?” Hermione asks, dropping the previous subject like it was never brought up.
“This belonged to your father, though he kept this a secret in fear that—“ She cuts herself off, Draco understanding who she is referring to, “He hoped that if the worst occurred, another chance would be at his disposal. As he is not currently present… it seems the task is left to us. However, between the both of us, I feel as though you would be better suited to take this on, if you so choose,” She finishes, the lines on her forehead more prominent from worry.
“I heard that you ponce,” Blaise says, appearing in the doorway of the bathroom, leaning elegantly against its frame.
As Draco is pulling out his wand to hex her, a spell hits him on his forehead and his head rapidly begins to swell up, causing his hat to slide off. As it enlarges, it becomes too heavy to hold up and he falls back onto his pillow with a grunt. Draco hears a deep, malicious cackle sound from the bathroom, and it hits him that Blaise hadn’t left.
, Draco thinks, disappointed.
“Ah, well it's true, we are in fact lovers, you see, just shagging like bunnies!” Draco declares, throwing his arms up and turning to walk toward the portrait of the kitchens, which is a few steps away.
“By the way,” Professor McGonagall cuts in as Coach Sylvester passes the supplies out, “the water guns have been spelled to automatically refill themselves so, to the muggleborn students, no, you will not have to do it manually each time they empty. To the Purebloods, all you have to do to squirt the water is point it at your target and pull the trigger with your index finger. That will push the water out of the nozzle towards your desired person at about six feet maximum,” She informs.
Hey guys! Longer chapter this time, yay! I really enjoyed writing this chapter, so I hope you all like it! Another lovely thank you to my beta
Draco’s hand shakes as he wills himself to pull the lever of the faucet. He can’t budge, lacking the strength to face the demons scratching through the walls of his mind.
“It is your choice if you want to wear it or risk your own vulnerability. The only time you are not permitted to wear it is past curfew outside the common room. Now, I’d like to set some ground rules to prevent any disruptions or injuries occurring,” She pauses, reassessing whether she still held everyone’s attention.
They remain silent until several minutes later when Greg stumbles into the room, “Draco, did you really use dark magic to get Smith out?”
“No, I haven’t,” Draco pauses, considering, “I suppose I should probably apologize to Granger, though.”
Harry laughs at the image of Malfoy startling the poor healer while Hermione glances up from her book, looking unimpressed at the joke. Harry quickly sobers and clears his throat, “There’s got to be a reason. Why is he being so defensive?”
Harry doesn't know why he feels this way; there could be several reasons. Maybe the war caused them to grow apart, becoming different people than they once were. Maybe it’s too soon for him to continue dating again, and he can’t process his emotions at the moment. In his darker moments, he also wonders if maybe the fatal spell had also killed a part of him, the part that could love.
“Such faith you have in me. What a best friend you are,” Draco grumbles. It’s true he hasn’t been able to beat Potter yet, but that doesn’t mean he’s never caught a snitch in a game. He still has a fighting chance if Potter’s skills have gotten rusty with lack of practice. Anything is possible.
“Draco, how do I use this? When I asked Blaise he just shot water at me,” He says defeatedly, and Draco flashes him a compassionate smile, knowing Greg needs it, and shows him his own water gun.
Draco has been aware of Theo’s feelings for him for quite some time, although it hadn’t affected their friendship back then. He found out during the quidditch game after party in fifth year, their entire house drunk in celebration of Gryffindor’s defeat at the hands of Hufflepuff. Draco was especially inebriated, elated that Potter was unable to play due to his punishment from Umbridge. Draco’s plan to get him removed from the team worked flawlessly; it was quite effortless on his part, as any slights towards the Weasleys causes an instant outburst from Potter and his ginger companions.
Well, fuck.
“I just don’t understand why they’re bothering—“
“Well, you like that don’t you? When he challenges you?”
His thoughts scramble long enough that he realizes he has missed what else Professor Byron has been telling them. He’s pulled out of his thoughts again at the sound of such a repulsive name.
Once they both began Hogwarts, Draco forbade her from using that nickname in front of others, threatening that he would dye her hair bright pink. It didn’t take much for her to comply.
Hermione releases a harsh breath. “Yes, but those were all feeble attempts that—”
“Wait, how do I know who his target was?” Pansy asks.
Yes, as if the game matters in the slightest to Draco. His ego would be thoroughly bruised.
She stalks off, leaving him there looking stunned. The air doesn't feel quite as cold anymore. He quickly squats down and grabs the snitch, not allowing himself time to process what the Weasley girl said. He mounts his broom and casts a good sticking charm on his hat before shooting into the air. Draco heads over to his group resolutely, determined to make these the damn best seekers anyone has ever seen.
Draco turns back to his wardrobe to avoid looking at her terrifying face. “My apologies, I’ve never heard of him. You have the wrong man.”
“Hey! I can’t tell you, it ruins the point of the game you wench,” Draco defends sharply.
“I don’t know. I’m still not up for dating right now, so probably not for a while. I just don’t want to hurt her because of my… stuff,” Harry replies awkwardly, still watching her at the Gryffindor table as she flips her hair back.
“Leave me alone!” Draco calls, his voice muffled by his pillow.
“So? Decided to take on Potter?” Pansy asks.
Some nights, despite the nightmares that follow, he lights a candle on his nightstand and stares at it for hours until he cries, the rekindling of the memory becoming unbearable. The next morning, Draco always asks himself why he does it to himself, and a small voice rationalizes that he deserves it for what he’s done in the war. Draco can never find it in himself to argue against it.
When he’s in the stairwell, out of sight, he chances a glance back at Potter, who looks quite relaxed as he looks down at the name of his target. Draco wonders if the Golden Boy is going to take this game seriously to win and claim the fame once again. It wouldn’t surprise him. He sees Potter glance up at Granger, and Draco presumes she asked him a question.
“Bye, Harry,” she says a bit reluctantly.
“Well, like the tortoise and the hare, slow and steady wins the race,” she says confidently.
“I bet you do, I wouldn’t expect a mediocre plan from either of you. So go make the Slytherins proud.”
“Of course not! The floor is yours, well,
The common room erupts in excited whispering, which is quickly interrupted by Coach Sylvester.
“Another Hufflepuff? That should be a breeze,” Pansy says joyfully.
“Morning Pans, yes, thank you, but the coffee has yet to kick in so if you could lower your voice to a proper level that would be ideal,” Draco responds, resisting the temptation to rub his eyes.
A moment later, Potter comes clattering down the stairs like an animal, chasing after Patil, so Draco decides to send a covert tripping jinx his way. Not for any particular reason other than for his own enjoyment. With a yelp, Potter crashes right on his face, and Draco thinks it's the best sight he’s ever seen—this is going straight into the pensive.
Eventually, once Pansy regains control of her breathing and wipes the tears away, they make their way back to the eighth-year common room. Upon entering through the portrait, they receive a mix of death glares from the Hufflepuffs and conflicted, suspicious expressions from the other houses; most likely due to the fact that everyone thinks Smith is an insufferable git.
His mother wants him to use a Timer-Turner?
Then, Draco gets sent straight into the wall, his body smacking roughly onto the rough stone. Ropes begin to tie his hands behind his back and he’s held there, the magic preventing him from moving his limbs.
“No, I don’t suppose she is.”
Draco awakes to the aroma of coffee, which he discovers to be coming from a steaming cup on his nightstand. He notices a note placed next to it and reaches for it.
“Sod off!”
reason he wouldn’t be able to get her out.
“You’re resilient, you know that?” Theo comments a few minutes later, keeping his tone casual, not daring to look directly at Draco.
“Fine, if I do, you have to admit that I’m the better seeker.”
Draco has never heard of him in his life, though he hardly knows much about the American version of Quidditch, which is a poor alternative in his opinion. He’s also not quite convinced she’s telling the truth, but he doesn’t dispute her. “That’s… wonderful. How does it exactly work…?”
“So, what are you up to?” Theo inquires.
Potter chases him, his loud footsteps close behind as Draco races up the stairs. As soon as Draco reaches the top step, his legs give out on him, and he falls face first on the floor. Jelly-Legs Jinx. Damnit.
. When Draco moves to stand up on his own, he’s suddenly swept off the ground, now held in Potter’s arms. He looks at Potter, alarmed, and sees he looks quite pleased, showing a bright smile.
“Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco and Pansy turn to each other and nod in triumph, smiles gracing both their faces. This reminds him of fifth year when the Slytherins caught all the members of Potter’s stupid defense club. He beams at the memory.
Draco frowns. “So you’re asking me only to spite Potter?” He asks slowly.
Pansy lets out a short, shrill laugh. “No you won’t! You know that.”
Ron chuckles and punches him lightly, “Hey, ‘s not my fault you’re single. Speaking of, when are you gonna get back with Gin?”
Blaise tucks his wand away and chuckles. “It seems you were right. Thank you for the valuable information, Pansy.”
“Probably ‘cause Potter can…”
She walks right up to Longbottom, his eyes widening slightly, looking more frightened by her than by the Dark Lord in the flesh. “You hear me Bucky Beaver? Because no one is gonna go easy on you just because you look helpless.”
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Bugger off.”
“Fortunately, I happen to have the answer to both your questions,” Blaise chimes in, appearing suddenly at Draco’s side and sliding into the seat beside him.
“Let’s go DD!”
Draco startles to see McGonagall holding out the bag, peering down at him with an unimpressed look. He reluctantly reaches into the bag and quickly grabs a name. She continues looking at him for another moment, her face calculating, before continuing on to Pansy. He looks down at the small piece of parchment and unfolds—
“Fair point.”
“But why ever not?” He asks innocently.
“Hey, that doesn’t count! You cheated!” Smith accuses Draco, a look of pure rage on his face.
Draco hums, avoiding her gaze as they walk. “Not necessarily. Perhaps I was feeling more irritated by you that day than normal.”
Though, he thinks, if anyone were to manage it, he supposes it would be Potter.
“Draco,” Pansy whispers, anxiety laced in her words, “Let’s just go.
He snarls and storms off.
“Well, Monroe, I believe that is an unfair assessment. We only got to play three matches out of the six we were supposed to, so we truly don’t have the most accurate information to determine the better seeker. We also haven’t played against each other in three years, so he could have greatly regressed in his skills,” Draco explains. “Besides, being a good player does not guarantee being a competent coach.”
Hermione groans, releasing seven years worth of frustration out of her system. “Oh, don’t get me started, we’ll be here all night! Anyhow, this is getting out of hand! If I had a galleon for every time he mentioned you…”
“Ladies, ladies, you’re all beautiful, no need to fight over the most desirable one present. Everyone knows that would be me,” Blaise cuts in, “Now quiet down and eat your breakfast in peace before Coach Sylvester shows up and breaks you three in half like broomsticks.”
Draco is failing to comprehend the words that are filtering through his ears. He wanted to learn the charm on his own devices, but now he’s going to have to learn it for a grade, which will be virtually impossible. He doesn’t want to do it in front of the entire class; his bedroom, with no one there, was quite sufficient. He rather liked having privacy, without the fear of someone’s judgement. Everyone is going to expect him to fail due to his unfavorable involvements from the year prior. He’s going to be the laughing stock, they’re going to jeer that “A Death Eater could never produce a patronus!” Draco can already envision Potter with his stupid, infuriating smug that makes his blood boil, and Draco won’t be able to leave his bed for the next week, having to fight the urge to hex him into next year.
“Discussing how gorgeous you are,” Pansy drawls.
From the day Draco was sentenced to the empty halls of the Manor for 365 days precisely, the horrors of the past did not escape him. He cannot shake the fear that a Death Eater may barge into his room in the dead of night to do with him as they please. Dark circles developed under his eyes as he could no longer rest properly without feeling the looming terror of his death approaching at a moment’s notice. No individual could shake off that amount of distress after the endurance of such a lifestyle for days upon days that—without notice—stretched into months full of tortured screams resonating from the basement and constant surveillance of his every move.
He is also rather curious what form it would take. He eagerly wants it to be a dragon, as it would be entirely fitting, but he knows the chances are slim.
This wasn’t so bad when he was practicing on his own terms, with no pressure, but having to learn this for class has made it even more difficult. He knows that Potter is going to tease him mercilessly about his inability to cast it, and there won’t be much for Draco to counter with. Nothing that wouldn’t likely put himself in Azkaban.
“As a way to put this into motion, you will each take part in a fun competition that I am confident will be a delight for you all.”
“Yes, perhaps if the next best option was a dung beetle, then I’d say you would be a close second.”
,” She stammers, eyes wide with terror as she glances up at him.
“What was the first present I ever gave you?”
“Sorry Pans,” he cuts her off before squirting her square on the chest. She lets out a startled gasp as she stares down at the droplets of water seeping into her shirt, which is rapidly becoming see-through. A second after, she lunges toward Draco and tackles him onto the sofa.
As he waits for her to return, his eyes focus on the lines of the dark wooden doors that reach up to the high ceiling. He guesses it is composed of walnut due to the rich brown hue and the curves of the lines trailing the wood. He wonders who spent the time carving the door into perfection, and imagined the careful process.  His mother returns to his sight, shutting the door behind her. She clasps something in her hand away from his view, something Draco is almost positive he doesn’t want to see. Nothing good could ever come out of that room. Not after that day.
Ginny shakes her head. “That’s not war related!”
Draco laughs.
Draco scowls. He refuses to discuss Theo’s offer with the others present. The last thing he needs is for Pansy to find out about it.
“Oh don’t make a scene, you baby, I hear you loud and clear. I just often choose not to partake in your dramatics and instead spare myself by feigning deafness.”
Coach Sylvester blinks at him in surprise. “What? No, I understand remaining loyal to your family. I would murder the world for mine,” she says gravely, a heaviness in her tone. “Nothing to be ashamed of. As long as you don’t think you’re somehow superior to me because you flick a narrow piece of wood in the air to make frogs dance, we’re fine. Otherwise, get the hell out of my living room.”
Draco turns over in bed, facing away from her, “Nothing Pan Pan, I’m alright. Just not feeling well.”
As they both walk through the large doors, entering a room full of students, hundreds of eyes lock onto them, faces morphed in bewilderment. It’s a bit refreshing to see them a bit confused at the sight of them rather than with looks of disdain.
He thinks he can distantly hear Hermione protesting behind him, but he’s not sure, nor does he really care at the moment.
“Draco…” Pansy says.
“No.”
After a minute, he had carefully pushed her away, claiming he needed to rest. She simply nodded and walked out to find her family and go back home.
“I was running my group, which seems to be what you are not doing right now,” Draco quips, standing his ground.
Theo looks down at his food and scoffs quietly, “Right.”
“I know,” Draco responds, returning the hug and stroking her hair.
She ruins the fun.
Draco looks away and nods.
Harry turns his focus to Hermione who looks collected but slightly uncertain.
Pansy stares at him for a second, startled, and then breathes out while shaking her head dismissively, “Oh, nevermind.
“But it’s You-know-who related!” He counters.
“You know,” Pansy says, smirking, “Potty couldn’t stop looking at you all day, I’d say from the different hair look.”
“Sorry, I just had to test it out and figured I’d do so on something not worth any value.”
Suddenly a large stag erupts from Potter’s wand, the classroom completely engulfed by the bright blue light of the patronus. It prances elegantly around the room, and Draco can’t look away. He freezes as it starts to approach him, but before it can reach him the patronus dissolves into nothing, leaving Draco with an indescribable void in his chest. Draco scowls at the fading light, feeling inexplicably bitter, before moving his attention back to the front where Potter is standing. He startles when he meets Potter’s eyes, already locked onto his own. Potter looks away quickly, clenching his jaw tightly as he swallows. Draco’s eyes follow the movement of his Adam’s apple unknowingly, and upon the realization of his actions he curses silently.
Who’s been doing this?”
“Yeah, I do.” Greg stares down at his bed, fumbling with the hem of his shirt for a moment, before finally speaking. “I mean, but Hermione was born to muggles right? I don't think she's gross...”
Draco curses inwardly. “No,” he lies.
Draco snaps. “How would you understand that when your mother is—” he cuts himself off, watching in horror as Theo’s face becomes crestfallen. “Theo… I’m so sorry. That was terrible of me.”
Coach Sylvester slams her teacup onto the table. “
The challenge riles Potter up again, “You wish, Malfoy.”
“YOU CAN’T WALK IN FRONT OF ME THINKING YOU’LL GET AWAY WITH IT, TREETOP! I’LL MAKE YOU WISH YOU WERE NEVER BORN!”
“Last I checked it was you who needed coddling from Madam Pomfrey.
Draco chuckles and briefly turns to Hermione with a polite smile. “Good day, Hermione.” He moves towards the doors and knocks into Potter’s shoulder as he walks past him. Draco always prided himself in getting the last word, as well as the last move—or in this case, shove.
“Slimy Slytherins,” A ravenclaw boy spits, knocking his shoulder into Pansy’s with such force she falls against Blaise’s side with a squeal. He immediately catches her, places his arm around her shoulder protectively. In an instant, the three boys whip out their wands, pointing them at the perpetrator. This immediately startles the boy, causing his bravado to falter.
He unlocks the door with a thoughtless flick, and Theo walks in with a strange glint in his eye.
“I think Draco can beat Potter,” Greg speaks up, and Draco is thankful he didn’t mention that he thinks Draco’s only bet at winning is dressing up like a dementor to potentially scare Potter off his broom.
“Yes, that’s exactly what I said! But no, instead, these idiots think that because of the tattoo on my arm, I’m capable of mass destruction despite the fact that I couldn't even complete my only mission assigned to me against my will. It should be apparent that I would be inept in this game for the simple fact that I couldn’t execute a
“No, that's not— I’m just making sure there isn’t a problem.”
Draco nods to her again in affirmation and follows her out into the hall, his feet hesitating as he steps out of the room. His mind whirls as he tries to imagine what she has for him since their world has shrunken down to this confinement for 147 days. By now, he has explored every room, some even more than once. It was the only way to keep his mind occupied, to give himself a purpose. The first 12 days he spent either underneath the comforter or in the dining room with his mother.
Draco snaps his head and sees Potter on his feet, yelling for Coach Sylvester who seems to be ignoring him intently. As soon as Draco reaches the goals, he stops and turns towards the approaching group, holding the snitch out to his side. “Come grab it!”
But unsurprisingly, Potty and the Weasel have no sense of self-decency. They both sit at the other end of the table, hats still present as they begin filling their plates with food. Draco scoffs quietly at the sight of them. Unfortunately, Weasley catches his stare.
“Malfoy, just stop.”
“Not at the cost of his NEWTs, Draco!”
At his words, they appear to be moving faster, each of them trying to outdo the other. Draco swallows nervously as they gain speed and quickly approach him. The sudden overwhelming fear that they’ll all crash into him and knock him off the broom to his death floods over him, and he takes a deep, steadying breath to calm his nerves. It will be fine.
Draco returns to his room, his bones aching with exhaustion. It was only a couple hours in the air, but spending that time with snotty children completely sucked the life out of him, more than a Dementor ever could. When he opens the door, he sees Greg lounging on his bed, frowning down at his homework. Draco kicks off his trainers and stumbles over to his bed, falling face down on it with a thump.
“Like what you see, Potter?”
Before Draco can doze off into an angry slumber, someone tries to open the door, and bangs on it incessantly when it doesn’t open.
Theo frowns slightly. “Since when?” He asks bemusedly.
who is seriously the beta of my dreams. Anyway, enjoy the new chapter! :)
“I understand, and I don’t yet either. We’ll see,” she says softly.
“Find it,
This rule didn’t nearly affect Harry or Hermione as much as it did Ron. Harry always avoids speaking of the war if he can help it, saying as little as he can get away with when it does come up. But Ron got in the habit of rehashing everything, which Hermione had gathered is his way of dealing with the trauma. On nights when his mood was particularly sour, she would pull him outside and allow him to let everything out, holding him tightly and stroking his head as the words and tears spilled out.
Potter’s gaze suddenly slips away, moving downward. His eyes land on the inner part of Draco’s wrist, peering down through the opening of his robe sleeve. Draco’s mind begins racing, words spilling out of his mouth, desperate to shift his attention back up, for more than one reason.
Draco doesn’t bother holding back the eye roll this time. Pansy elbows him without breaking eye contact with McGonagall. After her actions during the battle of Hogwarts, she is determined to get back on everyone’s good side in order to diminish her image as a snobby pureblood. Draco can’t find it in himself to begrudge her for that, but he doesn’t plan to join her. He knows that no matter what he does, he’ll be known as the boy who brought death eaters into Hogwarts for the rest of his life. There’s nothing he could do to repair his image, and he has accepted that. Draco merely plans to get the best NEWT grades possible to have the chance to find a decent job.
think, if you were them?”
“Yeah, you fit the type she targeted, no offense,” Potter crosses his ankle over his other knee, palming his chin, “Kinda lost, no aspirations. Tired, don’t seem fulfilled, basically wanting a better future. Those are the people who’d accept a ticket to a different life.”
A swift turn to the ticking clock on the far wall, and Harry can tell they have but a few minutes left of today’s session.
“During the official trial at the House, he confessed that he spent days working through her wards and broke in. Never expected that McDermott was a fighter. She couldn’t get to her wand, but she did have a knife. She stabbed him 3 times as he was drinking from her. Their blood mixed, and Frangos ran off to lick his wounds before we found him. That was Friday.”
“Who have it the—oh,” Potter straightens, touching his forehead in realization. His hand slides back to his nape. “Fuck, how did I forget?”
Draco checks his Alarm charm on Grammedion, makes sure his cage's bars are sturdy enough. When he looks down, there’s a sleeping wolf in his lap, his body curled into a huge ball. Draco sighs and
“But you haven’t changed yet,” Harry frowns. Pansy loves people she considers hers dearly, but if one doesn’t at least attempt to look put-together, they can’t step a foot into her house without it getting chopped off.
“You can make it easy for yourself and say no,” Edmund says.
think?” Draco’s yell almost drowns out the shower spray. Harry laughs, his stomach hurting for the right reason at last.
The Boy King does not know what it means. Murderous anger subsides for a moment. No intruder has called him that before.
” now he has two wands in one hand, an ankle in another. Malfoy seems to go through every stage of grief at once, with the last stage manifesting itself as being too consumed by exhaustion and disgust to do much else but glare at Harry.
Just keep an eye on the monitor and the clock, will you?
“I could’ve, but I spent most of those days in denial. Then the dots connected and I couldn’t deny it anymore, so I decided to just go through with the wedding regardless, be with the woman I loved. Hoped that maybe the odd emotions I had would go away,” he shrugs, raising his eyes to meet Draco’s. “Saw Ginny at the end of the aisle and, well, I couldn’t stop thinking that it should’ve been someone else. All this time, I’ve thought that she didn’t feel… right in my arms, but I pushed it down. And there she was in that white dress.
“There we go,” Edmund whispers. His hands guide Draco to lean against him, back to chest, sending intermittent shivers to rack through Draco’s body. It’s cold, so cold, but he can’t pull away, just lets Edmund takes whatever he wants to take. “Good boy.”
He’s exhausted, Harry realizes. His shift ended later than Harry’s at the Ministry today, yet he went home just to sit through this.
“You think they’d believe you?”
If it’s not for the flickering of withering candles, the room might as well be completely silent. Narcissa pauses, before:
“Understood,” Draco says.
With a 'pop', Draco appears out of thin air and slams onto the ground. Oxygen burns in his lungs. There’s a reason why Tonks stressed to the Potioneers repeatedly not to test the anti-Apparition wards she’s helped strengthen around Gramma’s cabin. Thank Merlin no one is seeing him right now, heaving and wheezing while dots litter his vision.
Edmund shoots him a wink. If he’s not, well,
“Thought so.”
“I thought you said you were in denial.”
voted for this during the biweekly Order meeting.”
“You love these gears,” Harry says, hanging his harnesses and tool belt in the closet and walking into the bathroom for a quick shower, “you love them against your ba-”
“The Dragon-tamer? Why not? He has that title for a reason,” Draco fans his face, an action he lets himself do for the sole purpose of making Potter uncomfortable.
Molly’s shown him a picture of them on the front page and asked if he was sure. He’s only smiled, said ‘yes,’ and, unfortunately, meant it. Harry’s gone above and beyond for a couple of coins, to the point where he worries about abandoning what he’s worked so hard to cultivate.
“Yeah, I dropped mine.”
“I jest, I jest. It’d be inconvenient if an author doesn’t know what the most basic of terms mean.”
“It’s none of your business. Please leave.”
His hand flies to his mouth. “Oh, sorry. I don’t really speak about this to anyone. That was a tangent, I’m sorry.”
“There’s no need to order one. I would’ve borrowed it from Hermione if you had only asked,” Potter says. “Instead, I got curious and read it for myself. That’s how I connected the dots about the heartache, how I realized we’ve both had it since that day years ago.”
“You bastard, what are you-!”
Instead of shouting or even a hint of biting snark, Narcissa smiles her first smile in the five sessions they’ve had. It doesn’t reach her eyes, but it does make her look a few years younger. Good genes, Harry notes. Wonders that if her last relative was still here, the age-regressing effect would also be noticeable on that pinched face.
Should he keep this one alive?
“Ah, you’re cute. The Sisters will adore you.”
where we
“Cordium nuts? How you even found these is beyond me,” Draco lets go of his spoon to scritch Billy’s head. That familiar snout digs into his cheek like a peck, wet and cold, and he huffs out a laugh.
“Oh, the day you slashed me into ribbons and almost cut through my heart?” Draco clenches his jaw.
After the mixture is all dried, he divides it into glass jars and fills them to the brim with the vinegar solution. He picked up this pickled daikon and carrot, or ‘đồ chua,’ as well as the daikon leave furikake recipes from an old Asian cookbook—many thanks to the city library. Putting everything into the fridge, Draco pulls out his leftover mushroom soup to heat up in a pot.
“Take a seat and cast a Warming charm over yourself. I’ll be out in a tick.”
Between lingering lips and the cradle of Potter’s hand, Draco feels warmer than he’s ever been. Potter shifts his face away, far enough for his other hand to close Draco’s fingers on the kiss, like he’s given Draco a treasure to keep. Cupping the back of Draco’s hand, Potter raises it to his lips once more, the spark of heat now spreading from Draco’s knuckles instead of his palm.
This time, both hands are in the pants pockets. The cigarette has stopped its light bouncing, now lying still between pillowy lips. Like before, the voyeur is a statue amidst a sea of movement.
“And mouths.”
Potter seems to be confused as to why he’s being restrained and wrings Grammedion’s arm even harder as an answer. Defeated groans resound from the floor.
“Why are you looking at me like that? Keep eating,” Draco settles amid the pillows, long hair settled on his satin-clad chest, white against emerald. Harry sneers at him - an unfortunate habit he’s gotten from Draco - and turns to watch the movie.
Edmund sighs and lowers his head until it’s nestled where Draco’s neck joins his shoulders.
“Jaclynn?”
‘What good are outlaws if they don’t bring anything of value into my land.’
“Are you sick?” Potter inquires around a mouthful of mushroom. After a few careful bites, he’s been practically inhaling the soup. “It’s not that cold, though.”
“Mr. Potter? He’s the werewolf?” Grammedion whirls toward Draco, incredulous. “When did he- how in the world was he able to get here?”
“No, you have nothing to worry about,” he concludes, still tapping. “It’s my fault. I’m not used to restaurants, so I’m a bit clumsy. Sorry for troubling you these past few days.”
There one moment, gone the next. Draco sits there and stares at the spot once occupied by a warm body amidst the chill of spring.
Darkness. It pulls at his blouse and hangs to his cape as he weaves through the trees. Ducking under the Yewdoe branches, stepping everywhere but the third honey-coloured stone, casting a wandless
They continue to watch the movie in silence, whites and blues and purples flooding his sight until Draco yawns and Harry blinks his eyes shut for far too long.
Being able to shout this ugly kind of truth into the perpetrator’s face feels oddly liberating. That is, if liberation also comes with a specific kind of agony that makes Draco want to fall to his knees.
Hermione opens her mouth just when a large palm touches her shoulder. The trio looks up to see Viktor Krum, who pulls away and steps a respectful distance back.
“And why do you think it has that name?”
more times than he should have. He knows the marquise droplets of Ginevra’s gems and the chevron curve of her ring, the blankness of Potter’s own band a dream and a question in his mind.
Draco’s breath catches in his throat.
Harry can’t deny that.
wand core is made of?”
“A blanket fort, lover,” Draco says, his gaze tender. Harry’s fingertips tingle with every touch of cotton, linen, silk, as he gets situated. It’s been years and years and years and years, and Harry can never get used to, can never take for granted, the weight of his husband’s undivided attention.
No frost, so the daikon also encountered little trouble. Cutting the leaves away for later, he cleans and dries the white root before peeling the skin off. A pot of vinegar, salt, and sugar boil over the stovetop, then he moves the solution to the counter to cool. Meanwhile, he juliennes the vegetables and places them in a bowl, pouring salt over the mixture. As he squeezes the salt in to absorb, something lands on his shoulder.
[pause]
Draco laughs, a momentary rumble of his chest, then moves forward to click something on the laptop. Harry’s on his fifth spoonful of pure comfort when the jazz music stops, and on the blank wall opposite from their blanket fort is the title card of a movie. Strange, Harry didn’t even notice the mini projector. He squints.
Ms. Remington doesn’t stay in her office that day, preferring to smile and observe by the hostess stand. She likes that he doesn’t look anyone in the eye; it gives her the opportunity to tell curious customers that ‘we encourage change in this establishment’ and ‘he’s shy, the lad, learned a thing or two from his… decisions.’
“When I announced my engagement to her on the Battle of Hogwarts’s 10th Anniversary, you were clapping along with everyone else. But your heart ached.”
“Have you worked with wizards before, Dr. Stewart?” Draco asks as he starts packing the valuables at his work desk into his briefcase. Dr. Steward has come to the Ministry by Floo, and though she seemed a bit disconcerted after stepping out of the Ministry Public Floo #13, she didn’t hesitate to follow him to his office. Thus, seeing her reaction to a simple Vanishing spell has certainly been a bit strange.
Shaking her hand, Draco feels something slide into place at his new title. He smiles politely, heart thundering in his chest.
“You’ll only be at the House of Collective until we get you accustomed to your new life, then you can return home. Or,” Edmund tilts his head to the side, “you can stay. It’s akin to a commune, there’s space for all. It’s in the middle of the woods, too, hidden behind extensive wards and Charms, very private. Don’t you love your privacy?”
"Won’t you look at me?”
Draco stares at her, then at the name in the file, at the picture attached, slack-jawed.
“Oh, it’s,” Potter stares at his wrist. It’s a long, long stretch of time before: “I guess this is it.”
An eyebrow cocks up. “Did you not say you want to run away?” Potter whispers back. His fingers trail to the edge of Draco’s armbands like they’re trying to sneak under and touch bare skin.
“Intelligence, Mr. Malfoy, is your greatest asset,” Grammedion nods, “but it’s also your biggest downfall. It makes you arrogant, inattentive. If it’s not for your dreaded headlamp, neither you nor your colleagues would ever detect the minute changes in those vials until it’s too late. What would the Order think if their prized Potions Master can’t even recognize pure versus contaminated Wolfsbane? Indeed, we were betting on your negligence.”
It’s not his business Potter hasn’t been in the Forbidden Forest enough to know what plants, what creatures to look out for besides centaurs and weeds. It’s not his business. It’s not his concern. It’s not-
“What the hell, why did you switch its spot?”
Ever since the day that ridiculous notion entered his head, he has been haunted by visions. They feel like memories, but the Boy King has no history. No before's and after's, only his kingdom and his subjects. And yet, they come anyway like rats in the night. One, a levitating feather. Two, a cloak nowhere to be seen. Three, pure green. Four, five, six, seven, so on and so forth. The eleventh and twenty-fifth contain a freckled face and a mane of curls respectively. They keep appearing in his head, in bits and hints when he opens his eyes and roams his land, in dreams and nightmares when dawn comes and he sleeps. They persist even after he remembers the word ‘friends.’
Draco’s silhouette crawls to the opening of the cloth… tent-shaped thing. Pewter grey eyes peer at him behind strands of near-platinum blonde, its icy color soothed by the orange tint of- ah, so he’s brought the bug lamp in here. Neat.
“You can thank me by taking off those horrid gears faster and come here,” with that, Draco crawls back to where he was sitting before.
“Oh, pish posh, I hate it too! In fact, I’m doing us both a favor disposing of the entire thing altogether.”
“You forget, Lovegood targeted those with nothing left to lose,” Draco says. “The only problem I had was paying rent, and there’s no loved one to miss me.”
“Right. Luna’s convinced that dumping people into a whole another reality altogether is the solution to unhappiness and whatnot. I mean, it really wasn’t that much of a surprise, to be honest. She means well, but she’s just that ‘mad scientist' type.”
“I made it,” he hisses into Potter’s face, the latter's eyes widen, “I made it to indicate the presence of Dark creatures. If there’s none in my general vicinity, it swings quickly. The closer one is, or- or a few are, the slower it swings. If it stops, then the creature is, hah, incredibly close, and, and,” Draco inhales. He’s overheated, overwrought, “fuck,
Whatever Hermione’s about to say is lost on Harry, because there’s a gasp from McGonagall again. He whips his head to the Black Lake and sees them at the same time the rest of the audience does. Everybody clamors to the edge of the docks, screams and cheers of all kinds of languages filling the air. Three blonde heads, darkened by the water, steadily swimming to shore. Scratch that; a weary little girl is held up by two teenagers on both sides, each panting for air but tense with bull-headed stubbornness.
Draco has a few questions, but from the way she ends with a close-mouthed smile, he reckons any at all would be regarded as idiotic. Well, at least she told him something.
“Well, Silly-Billy,” he muses. Billy perks up at the sound of his name, still eating the nuts stored in his pouch-like patagia, “I’ve truly seen it all. Harry Potter actively seeking me out, what a concept.”
“Draco Malfoy, I love you, you hear? I love you,” Harry’s hands move from Draco’s waist to cup his face. His thumbs are soft as they rub Draco’s cheeks, almost as if they mean it. “Say it back, baby, I know you feel the same. Say it back.”
“He let go of love so easily, that boy of mine. I had hoped for him to let go of what little he had left before he went, at least, to make his journey less full of burdens,” Narcissa sips her tea, pausing for a moment.
Grammedion smiles a rare, paternal smile that used to make Draco flush with pride.
“Lazy arse.”
In another universe, Potter doesn’t come to find him at all.
“Check with a Healer, then. If you can put past grudges aside, I can hand you Pansy Parkinson’s business card,” Draco grits through his teeth, pushing against the door with his entire body, his throw slipping to the ground.
Combine with a bit of you, your dearest memory. Allow it to dissipate.
“That,” Potter gestures at Draco’s chest. “The heartache.”
“What arti—” Draco stops. “That was years ago.”
Past Edmund’s sturdy form and angular lines, out in the main street, the thin crowd of pedestrians pass by in chattering groups and pairs. Opposite to the alley, however, one lone figure stands just out of reach of the street lamp. The yellowish light merely suggests their existence as they lean against the restaurant Draco and Edmund exited from earlier. The bright tell-tale red of a cigarette butt is visible but other than that, no detail to be discerned. Looks like someone who’s just minding their own business.
“Oh come on, what’ll it hurt? It won’t affect who wins anyway,” Ron pushes, looking eager.
Draco hums thoughtfully. It would explain many odd instances the day he got Goldstein and Patil out. Though the question of his charming persona and… the way he carried Draco. He shakes the thought away, wanting to avoid any more Potter-related confusion.
twisted, for your information. They are perfectly unwound.” Draco says haughtily.
,” Weasley snipes, “And you won’t be laughing when you get eliminated because you forgot to put your hat on your pointy head!”
Draco nods awkwardly, taking a long sip of his drink. He still doesn’t see how his presence in her living space at this hour is necessary.
assassination, but instead, it seems that no one has any common sense.”
Draco approaches him once he packs his belongings, his chest out proudly. “Jealous you didn't get picked, Potter? I'm sorry to break the news, but just because you saved the Wizarding World doesn’t mean you’ll get everything you want handed to you on a silver platter. It’s not my fault that Coach Sylvester recognizes my talent.”
“Make sure to get my favorite biscuits. The ones I make sure the houselves keep there for me,” She mumbles before Draco has a chance to even answer.
Pansy ignores him and, in a flash, her face turns furious, “Why did you trip Smith! Now he’s going to tell everyone that we’re cheating Slytherins! That was the
“Yeah, actually who
Hermione holds back a sigh. She had a feeling Draco wouldn’t follow through with asking him about tutoring, but she couldn’t help but hope that he might. “Nothing important.”
Smith freezes on the ladder before jumping off, landing in a sprint, “Get away from me. Death Eater scum!” He yells, sprinting down the hall.
As soon as Flitwick dismisses them, reminding them to practice the ascendio charm before next class, Draco throws on his hat and follows Pansy out the door, still glaring at her with utter disdain.
Pansy chats Draco’s ear off furiously about frivolous matters ranging from the new designer heels she just ordered to describing in disturbing detail why and how—if drunk enough—she wouldn’t mind having a one night stand with Flitwick; The latter of which startled Draco into alertness, and he suspects that perhaps it was her intent.
Draco raises his eyebrows, impressed with the idea. He’s starting to wonder why Coach Sylvester didn’t come here sooner. Another reason to resent Dumbledore. “That sounds like a great idea.”
—of all the terrible things he’s done and causes her to renew her animosity towards him. Draco would be back to square one.
Draco narrows his eyes, not allowing her to shake him. “What proof do you have?” He asks, just to be contrary.
Draco taps his fingers anxiously on the wooden table, eyes glued to the front doors of the library. Every time it opens, he tenses in anticipation only to be let down at the sight of unfamiliar students. He chose a table towards the front, which differs from his usual one. Normally, he prefers a table placed against the wall in the middle of the library, near the bookshelves. It’s far enough back to hide him from most of the other students, but not too far back where someone would get away with sending a covert hex at him. Unfortunately, he had to learn this the hard way when he hid at the back table on the first day of term. He still receives them occasionally at his regular table, but they’re not as frequent. He’s gotten into the habit of casting a silent protego around his table when someone walks by, just in case.
As Draco enters the corridor, he’s already envisioning a glorious post-dinner nap when he almost gets knocked over by a fast-moving force. This is the second time this week, for Merlin’s sake, can he get a break for once? As he composes himself, he sees Thomas booking it down the corridor, running like his life depends on it.
“Did you insist I tag along with you just so you could come onto me?” He stops walking, the last of his minimal patience gone.
But he knows he’s unlikely to find another again.
Draco breathes, he knows he has to at least try. He doesn’t want to grow old and regret that he never attempted to apologize for his mistakes.
“Draco, want to come with me?”
Draco only barely keeps his jaw from dropping onto the table from that information. That potion is almost impossible to acquire as there are only a few competent Potions masters in Wizarding Britain, and it’s extremely difficult to brew; the slightest deviation from the instructions will ruin it completely. This is a bit of a stretch even for him.
Draco winces at the touch, Smith’s hands setting his nerves on fire, and Draco wishes he could apparate. “I want your groping as much as I’d like to be kissed by a Dementor. Now, let go!” Smith seems to ignore his words as he starts grinding on him, letting out soft moans with each movement. Draco panics, and grasps at the first thought he has. “Have you forgotten I’m a filthy Death Eater? You wouldn’t want to defile yourself would you?”
A dangerous look flashes in her eyes and her lips form a callous grin before she speaks. “I asked the Golden Boy himself, obviously. Terribly annoying with his spluttering ‘Er—uh, yes, and?’ You couldn’t have picked anyone more articulate to obsess over?”
“Wait, but do we get anything if we win?” Blaise shouts from the other side of the room. He, Theo, Greg, and Millie are loitering by the portrait in typical Slytherin fashion; standing closest to the nearest exit in case of the need to flee. In this case, with Coach Sylvester present, Draco deems it warranted. Before the meeting, Pansy insisted the two of them stand there with them as well, but he refused to give up the comfort of the couch.
With a burning face, Draco slaps it out of the way. He doesn’t need Potter’s help,
Pansy scowls at him before relenting with a nod.
After reading the documents containing his grandfather’s research, Draco learns that this model of a Time-Turner could only take a person back in time, not forwards. Therefore, Draco only has one shot at success. The Time-Turner would take him back to the age he was at that point in time and replace himself, unlike the ones recently developed where one’s previous self is still present. Additionally, it only allows the traveler to go back 5 years from the first usage, and it cannot be used again until the time has caught up to the original point in time it was used.
“I’m not derailing you. Just eat, I swear you’ve lost weight.” Pansy says, returning to her food.
“No. We’re here to study. Open your textbook.” Draco says firmly.
There’s light, brighter than he’s ever gotten the patronus to be. But it dwindles away as fast as it appears. He opens his eyes slowly to see Theo smiling brightly at him.
McGonagall, who no longer looks very pleased, says “The last student remaining in the game will win 100 galleons and a year long supply of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky, provided generously by Madam Rosemerta.”
“Anthony Goldstein. I’m just glad I didn’t get Malfoy,” he hears Potter respond.
Draco sends her a disgruntled look. “No, Coach.”
Draco clears his throat. “Millie?”
Nothing.
Draco turns back to see them all neck and neck, with the older Slytherin boy slightly ahead of the rest. He jerks upwards causing the rest to follow suit. They chase after him, bumping elbows and heckling one another to get ahead. Draco purposely slows down a bit, enough where they don’t notice. Eventually, they begin to catch up to him, and once they fly high enough into the air, he turns back into the direction of the goal posts on the far side of the field, putting them off track. Purposefully.
“Those words were forming in your head. I could tell.”
He holds in a painful groan, but only just.
“Really?”
Theo’s eyebrows shoot up in interest, and he moves to sit at Draco’s desk. “Oh nice! I finally managed to conjure mine a few nights ago. It’s a hummingbird!” He shares, his eyes lit up with pride.
He stares back at her firmly, aware of her implication. “No,” he says, his voice hard and unwavering. He looks down at his textbook, unable to meet her eyes. “Though that doesn’t mean my actions don’t still haunt me every night. However, that was a choice I made. I wouldn’t have done it any differently. Not with my family at stake.”
“You didn’t expect me to be easy now did you?” Draco arches a brow. “So, I’m curious as to how you were able to intervene so soon. It’s a bit of a coincidence that you appeared quick enough to subdue him before it escalated.”
“Excuse me, where is your loyalty? I’ve been your friend since we were in diapers and you broke my toe by dropping a rock on my foot.”
“Just that he tried to take over the Wizarding World and that little Potter boy somehow managed to completely surmount him. I don’t see how that’s likely considering how scrawny he is, but I’ve learned over the years that anything is possible.”
Pansy pouts her lip, “It’ll make me feel better.”
“He’s definitely up to something,” Harry follows, still squinting at the doors.
Draco rolls his eyes out of fondness and takes a sip of the drink which is, of course, made to his liking. He glances over to the hat, debating if his fifteen year friendship with Pansy is worth humiliating himself. But then he remembers wearing it won’t make much of a difference in his social standing, and promptly places it on his head.
Draco is too close to the piercing green eyes. It’s unbearable.
“What? Who did he have?” He asks nervously.
“No, just don’t target him at all, it’s not like you
Draco takes a seat in front of the fire, Greg placing himself across from him. He hates spending time in the common room—he gets enough stares and glares in class and the Great Hall—but Greg insisted they play a game of Exploding Snap. Draco can never say no to Greg.
Harry tilted his head back and groaned. No, he couldn’t let her down. She was so excited to connect him with different experiences.
“There’s nothing more to say,” Potter said, but followed Draco back into the house and settled across from him at the kitchen table.
He has the biscuit with the rest of his wine. Then he helps Ron levitate all of the dishes into the sink and set the cleaning charms. It’s just a small bit of magic, though it makes Ron furrow his brow. Ron, however, doesn’t say a thing, and Harry pretends he didn’t see the disapproving expression. It’s just another thing he’s got used to over the last year. His friends care for him, that’s all.
Harry let his arm with the Emitter drop limply, and he wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his wand hand.
“That’s a euphemism. The attic, huh? What about the rest of it?”
“It’s not my specialty.”
“Really, Potter?” Malfoy said, but Harry ignored him and stood at the edge, looking in.
Malfoy preened.
He closes the study door softly behind himself.
At Harry’s sharp look, Malfoy lifts his chin. Recalling that he is not here officially, Harry decides not to pursue that line of questioning. Instead, he looks at the document in his hands. “What is it you want me to look at?” Then, when Malfoy grimaces, he says, “
“Good job, team!” Ginny said a few minutes later, when the last of the mounds had been closed and the angry mob of fairies had disappeared over the trees.
They continued driving.
He looked soft and sleep-tousled in the morning light. He and Harry had moved around in the night so that he was on his back and Harry was sort of curled around him, one arm across his chest. His very bare, very warm and gently moving chest.
“Don’t.”
Harry pushed deeper and faster, till he had a rhythm going and Malfoy was whimpering and moving his hips to meet Harry’s hand, taking the finger up to the knuckle. Harry introduced a little twist to his movement, and Malfoy responded by canting his hips.
“You might as well be. Do you know how hard it was to track you down?”
His hands are still shaking when he arrives home. He makes a cup of mint tea and sits with it in the drawing room, not to drink it but to breathe in the steam.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Just stop, Potter. Eat your food. I’m
This is exactly what Robards is trying to avoid: publicity, and for this case to blow up into something bigger. This is the opposite of Harry sweeping the debris under a rug.
Harry’s done this a dozen times. He’s practiced the speech, knows how to word the order so it sounds like a request. But what springs from his mouth is, “You’re to submit for questioning.”
“Potter?”
Heather, at the till, snorted a laugh.
Draco whispered it this time: “
She glances over her shoulder, as if confirming the room is presentable. It’s an action Harry’s got used to since Rose began to crawl. And later, walk. And ride a toy broomstick.
Fact was, after the initial shock of being startled, Draco was relieved out of proportion by Potter’s reappearance. Not that Draco should have been relieved. He
Harry recognized the charm from earlier, when Luna had used it. Where Luna’s casting was unconsciously graceful in a light way—almost as if an afterthought—Malfoy’s own casting was deliberately fluid, like a dancer who had practiced his movements so much they seemed natural. There was a contained power in that one spell. The pages of the book in front of him fluttered and fell open.
opportunity to needle Potter, Draco put on his most airy voice and said, “If the Unspeakables were unable to help you, it’s unlikely my chances will be better. Whether or not I’m successful in my attempt to help you, this will take a significant amount of my time—not to mention supplies.”
“Oh!” Harry said, stopping in the threshold. He’d spotted the big bed against the far wall, and a familiar citrusy smell hung in the air. This was Malfoy’s bedroom.
He putters in his office with the door closed, rearranging files until the canteen has opened for breakfast. A depressing amount of paperwork clutters his desk and shelves. Notes from cases closed years ago, old scraps of parchment with shopping lists and to-do items, inter-office memos he never tossed. He sweeps half of it into the bin. The rest he shuffles into file folders, into the tray to go to Records, and into neat piles at the side of his desk.
For lunch, he chose a place that served curry, hoping he would at least be familiar with the food here, but found that even this menu was foreign to him, so he’d ordered the special and was subjected to more smiles and odd looks from the staff. Feeling self-conscious, he ate his food at one of the little tables. He glanced in the wall-length mirror, wondering if he had something on his face, but he looked like he usually did, and he’d put his shirt on the right way around.
“That’ll be fine, yeah.”
Harry had slipped into a kind of trance, and only came to as Malfoy turned off into a car park.
. We all know they take certain liberties.”
“What?”
Ginny took the teapot and a couple of cups and the cheesecake and Harry out to a little table in the shade of the garden. The flowers looked motionless, but if Harry stared at them for a few seconds, he saw the bees that rose from them and flew around each other to land in the next flower. They reminded him of Ginny and Luna in the kitchen.
Well. If he failed his mastery, he would deserve it for making that fatal error in judgment.
Harry’s heart pounded an uneven beat and then found its rhythm again. He had the urge to look closer, to search the names, but he resisted. He knew the names he’d find.
“I’ll need the chocolate chips.”
Luna leaned forward. “But Harry hasn’t had any of his beer yet.”
“Ah,” he said.
Then the Tempus Charms were going off and Harry had to move the first trays out of the oven, followed by the next, and the next. In between pulling the trays out, Malfoy directed him to tap on the loaves. Harry thought Malfoy was joking at first, but he really did want Harry to Levitate each of the loaves and tap on the bottom. Harry didn’t know what he was listening for, but Malfoy seemed satisfied with what Harry described, and he had Harry move each of the finished loaves onto a rack. Soon, the rack was half-full of cooling loaves, and the kitchen smelled of fresh-baked bread, and Malfoy had several rectangles of dough on the large work table.
Harry’s stomach gave a dip. He nodded at Malfoy. Malfoy nodded in return.
Harry sits back in his chair. He simply doesn’t have the breath to say anything more.
Very familiar face next to his on the pillow.
anonymous.”
Harry sensed a barb but didn’t know how to respond to that. “But—Pansy. In Oregon? What was she doing here?”
think I should do?”
While she cast spells over the field, visually tagging the mounds with bright markers of floating colored light, Harry set up his device and the extra one that Ginny had brought.
Harry rested his forehead against the bed. They had barely got started, and he already felt like he’d been pulled apart.
“All right, Harry?” Hermione asks him later, shortly before she returns home to Ron, and he to a silent Grimmauld Place.
Now, he settled into the ride for the sake of the ride itself. It reminded him a bit of being on the Hogwarts Express, though the scenery and the seats and the smells and the company were all different. He remembered his friends being engrossed in games and books while he looked out the window, content to enjoy watching the world roll by. (He also remembered Malfoy stopping by to sneer at them.)
Malfoy.”
“And…what exactly are we doing with this?” he said, wondering if maybe selling shoes would have been the better choice.
“I— I’m not going to answer that.”
“No offense taken.”
“You’re under veritaserum?”
Malfoy looks honestly startled.
“Your expression is answer enough. Come on.”
“It’s all right, Harry,” Ginny said, at the look on his face. She gave his shoulder a slow, heavy pat. “It happens to the best of us. Look, they even have efectric lights.”
“That’s bullshit,” he says, and shoves them back toward Malfoy. “You obviously made those up.”
When the waiter showed up to take the empty appetizer platter and asked Harry if he would like another beer, Harry wondered why he’d ever disliked the man at all. “
and Harry can only raise his own and shake his head minutely.
Harry didn’t know what else to say. Words tumbled through his mind as he tried to come up with the right combination—the right thing to say to make Malfoy understand—because Malfoy still hadn’t opened the door for him and was looking at Harry like he didn’t recognize him.
“So you see,” Malfoy said, in the tones of someone coming to a grand conclusion.
“Merlin, you’re an insufferable arse.”
In the span of two years, he’d become
“Please.”
. Sure. Yeah. Because I love abuse.”
“Merlin. I like that too much.”
“Oh, fuck off, Malfoy,” Harry said, as he settled onto the floor nearby.
, Harry thought, desperately.
Ron made a face. “I can just imagine. You should. Bill’d probably love that. Old Black family heirlooms.” Ron shuddered. “It’s nice Sirius left you this place. But.”
Shortly after pie, Ron heads home with Rose. Hermione and Draco head up to Draco’s study to go through some letters or draft some rebuttal or other.
“Oh.”
“Look at these ceiling beams,” Potter went on. His gaze raked across the ceiling, over the hooks and the things hanging from them. “Are those embroidered oven gloves?”
Harry is on his feet before the first shockwave has passed, wand in hand. But he is not in his own room. Not, in fact, in his own house.
Later, replaying her words, Harry thinks about Malfoy, about how Malfoy had found himself on the wrong side of the war, about how he responded by becoming this advocate for muggles and muggleborns, this man who donates silently to charities and fights furiously for the rights of muggleborns—about how
“Sure I was,” Harry says, running a hand through his hair. “Hi there, Malfoy.”
Sighing, Harry sat. “How do you think Hermione and Ron manage it? Parenting 24/7.”
“More like the silence makes me nervous. Makes me wonder what you’re up to.”
“Hermione! You nearly gave me a heart attack. What’s going on? What’s wrong?”
The nicest part of being taken upstairs by Malfoy was Malfoy preceding Harry up them. In fact, if Harry hung back a few steps—which he certainly did because he could not allow an opportunity like this to pass, untaken—if he hung back a few steps, his eyes were level with Malfoy’s arse.
“No great damage,” he allowed, having mercy on her. “Just a few branches.”
“Sugar, I guess?”
Draco snorted tea into his nasal passages. He coughed and thumped his chest. He was hysterical, that’s what. Absolutely losing it. “
Malfoy’s fringe fell softly over his keen grey eyes. Harry wanted to comb his fingers through it, cup the angular jaw—but he couldn’t move. He was transfixed.
“I’m fine,” he concedes.
and the peppering of stinging hexes and the transfigurations into a pig, a snake, a chair. They reduced him to splinters.
“Where’s Malfoy?” he asked when he returned to the patio.
in one hand. It slaps him in the face, but Hermione doesn’t seem to notice. She’s too busy saying, “Did you see it? Harry, it was brilliant!”
The flames in the hearth remain small and orange. The morning slides by.
“And yet it tells me nothing I need to know.”
The man looked like anyone else Harry had seen in the shop or on the street. Jeans. Boots. T-shirt. Harry tried to spot anything that made him stand apart from the Muggles, but the problem was, Harry still didn’t have a handle on what
His annoyance mounted as he took the steps and found no sign of Potter on the first floor, either.
Not that he was avoiding Malfoy. He wasn’t
“You’re excused.”
“If you’re done staring, I’d appreciate a cup of tea.”
Once, Malfoy glanced up to find Harry watching. His expression turned unreadable. Then he scrunched his nose and turned away, grabbing a loaf from one of the racks behind the counter.
“Prick.”
“Refreshingly honest as always, I see.”
He knocks.
was coming. Waves of pleasure rippled through him.
“Don’t tell me you’re not sitting there thinking you’d like to suck some cock.”
Besides the roses, the garden lacked much color. Maybe Molly could help him choose something to plant along the paths, now that you could see them. That would be nice.
Then: “Champagne and gin? Really?”
He didn’t have much of an appetite despite his eventful morning—the pastry he’d had earlier had done it for him—so he picked through half the salad and soup and bread that Ginny dished out for him.
“They’re hopping,” Malfoy called. Harry—glancing down at that moment—saw what he meant: the fairies had organized themselves into little flocks and were diving into unattended mounds.
Malfoy meets his questioning gaze levelly. He arches an eyebrow. “Really, Potter?”
“That’s really interesting,” Harry said.
“Funny. Did you soak that carrot in vinegar, too?”
Harry could only stare at her.
“I am,” Harry says.
Harry’s heart pounds. He is still clasping her arms. The smile on his face slips. “So you’re saying— So you’re saying you knew. That the hearing would be postponed because it’s illegal.”
“Me? How should I know? It's your life, not mine.”
“The renovations are done.”
Harry shuddered, remembering the stench of burnt coffee and the din of mouthy hats. “No, thank you.”
Now, having recovered from his initial shock, Harry looked at Malfoy closer and noted the anemic pastiness of his skin, the deep creases under his eyes. A vivid bruise spread over his cheek. Harry would have to ask Williams and Chesterfield about that. Other, older-looking bruises mottled his neck. The hard thing in Harry’s chest dug in deeper.
The air here was cool and slightly stuffy and smelled of books. Harry wondered if Hermione had visited when she’d come. The enchanted ceiling showed a black night sky and ribbons of colored light—an aurora.
“Malfoy. Hey. Hi.” He runs a hand through his hair and blinks the stickiness from his eyes, runs the back of his hand surreptitiously over his mouth to catch any drool.
They worked for a while to the sounds of dough against the tabletop. Then Malfoy spelled the radio on, and the kitchen was filled with a lively violin melody. Harry bit back a comment about “seducing” the bread with romantic music.
Malfoy led him down mostly-empty paths, past car park entrances, the occasional cafe, and office lobbies to a multistory car park. It stood next to a crumbling building marked with “Condemned” signs and colorful graffiti.
When Harry didn’t move or comment, she cautiously continued. “When we apprehended him, he was doing the same thing. Williams thought he was fucking with us, but he looked frustrated.”
“Harry,” she warns.
“Fine,” he says, turning blindly to the kitchen door, hoping he doesn’t sound as breathless as he feels. “I suppose you both have it handled, then.”
“There we go,” Malfoy murmured. “
“Malfoy—hold on.” Before he realizes what he’s doing, he’s out of his chair and has gripped Malfoy’s elbow. Malfoy looks at it, and Harry lets go. Harry shakes his fingers out at his side. Up close, Harry can see the strain around Malfoy’s eyes, the paleness of his skin. It’s nearly translucent, like the skim milk Aunt Petunia had tried to get Dudley to drink, though he refused, and so Harry had been made to drink it.
Harry bristled at the order and at the implication that he didn’t have a working memory—and at the fact that Malfoy expected him to start with the tallest shelves—but once they settled into their search, Harry found that he quite enjoyed going through the stacks with him. Helping Luna earlier had been nice, but she’d left him to do the searching on his own. It was nice having someone nearby, even if it was Malfoy. Malfoy had a way of running his fingers over the spines and muttering. He complained about people putting books back in the wrong places, and swapped titles around a few times. Otherwise he worked quietly, pausing a couple times to ask Harry how he was coming along with his search.
“Same,” Ginny said.
“The dead.”
Are you really— That’s the Ministry seal, you blind git!”
“Potter.” He stood stiffly, arms crossed, and glared.
Malfoy huffed.
“You think you can handle it?”
“May I come in?”
“That’s great! Draco says he might be available, as well.”
“You wouldn’t,” Malfoy says, and Harry can’t decipher the meaning in his tone. The other man’s face is a strange twisted mask, part sneer, part…anger? Desperation? There’s a ferocious gleam in his eyes, different from the condescending hate Harry remembers from school. Harry has seen that gleam before—in Hermione. In Sirius. In his own reflection. It’s the fierce conviction of a lion. And Harry has the sudden unfamiliar feeling of standing on the wrong side of that look. It’s confusing.
Ron came over that night and brought a Chinese takeaway. Harry got the sense that Ron was checking in on him, and he wondered if Hermione had put him up to it. Or maybe Molly, judging from the treacle tart Ron pulled from his robe pocket and un-shrank for him. But Ron maintained a friendly cheerfulness, and Harry went along with it as they unpacked the chow mein and rice and chips and a mound of sweet and sour chicken.
want it.” He met Harry’s eye again, and his pupils were huge in the dimness of the room. Above his head, the chandelier’s little planets orbited slowly.
Once, Ron visits with Rose, and they pull weeds together in the garden.
Malfoy looked at the card as if he didn’t recognize the thing. Then, he accepted it, tapped at the till, and said, “That all?”
it, but close enough that Draco couldn’t help but grind his teeth.
That evening, Luna decided to bake bread.
Harry blinked. Realized something. “You came.”
Harry slung his bag into the back seat and got into the passenger side. He was still vaguely nervous about being in a vehicle, but mostly, he was excited.
Glancing in through the window, Harry didn’t see Luna or Ginny, though he wasn’t surprised by that. He left his bag off the side of the path and walked around to the back of the house.
“A rose bush, is it?” Edward said.
He freezes, hearing the echo of his words with horror. He’s instantly aware of where his wand is located—wedged in the seat, under his thigh—and the tensing of his muscles as they ready to dodge. Because his hazed and spinning mind expects Malfoy to explode in anger.
Malfoy curled over him. “How does it feel?”
“So he cast the shield charm just before he dropped unconscious,” Shacklebolt says. “And you left him in that state?”
“Let us consider you truly believe what you are saying,” Shacklebolt says. “You submit your memories for review. But by your own reasoning, they are suspect. You say Mr. Malfoy has been obliviated. Who is to say the same has not, instead, been done to you?”
“Mm?”
Frowning, he went down the hall to the front door.
“And why not?”
“Good morning, gentlemen,” Malfoy says.
“Now set a Tempus for 25 minutes. And the next trays are there and should be ready to go in.”
They walked deeper into the forest, skirting a drop-off from which drifted the sounds of running water. They emerged into a bright clearing where a number of trees had been felled. Some of the trees had been split and used to create a loose fence around the perimeter of the clearing. Others had been fashioned into tables and benches. The rest had been used to make raised garden beds. At the other side of the clearing stood a greenhouse.
“No Wizard Space?” Harry asked, as they made their way back toward the front of the house.
“What the hell, Malfoy?”
“Is that man having his ass eaten out by the other fine gentleman there? Yes. He is. Why, Potter. You’re
Ginny lifted her glass. “The sky’s the limit.”
Here: the corner of Harry’s memory that still lived in the cupboard under the stairs. Harry lost the energy to fight him, too overwhelmed to push him away. A different horror filled him now. Here was the deepest, smallest part of himself.
The longer Draco hesitated, the deeper Potter glowered.
“There’s nothing wrong with them,” Harry said, his own tone a bit defensive. He scrunched his face up. “I just…don’t want to.”
“Ow! What the fuck, Gin?”
Draco fed the animals and then took his notes into the sitting room. Something was missing from the information Potter had given him. He’d thought that reviewing his notes again would give him an idea of
“Shut up, Mr. Malfoy,” Harry says in a low voice.
Harry’s eyes widened.
Harry lowered the letter, heart pounding. A cold sweat had broken out on his brow. He felt a bit sick, not because he’d apparently stumbled across Sirius’s secret stash of love letters from Lupin—well, not because they were
It’s easy enough for Harry to detach himself from his body. He has had weeks of practice. From a removed perspective, the sound and feel of his breathing is interesting. Almost comforting, in a macabre way.
Malfoy was making this extremely difficult for him.
They had waited till they were in the car to cast the Drying Charms, when no non-magicals were looking. Then they dried the damp seats below them. Neither of them mentioned the charm Malfoy had used to catch Harry from falling onto the rocks. Harry hoped that, in the confusion of water erupting, none of the non-magicals had noticed. There was a chance Malfoy would receive a citation. Harry didn’t know enough about American magical laws. But Malfoy didn’t seem bothered about it. He was too busy spelling the salt from the upholstery.
He nearly Apparated on the spot, but he caught himself and began to stride toward the bathroom to Apparate from there—then thought better of getting Malfoy in trouble by “disappearing” in his coffee shop’s bathroom. So he returned to the alley and went from there to Malfoy’s house. He vaguely remembered the overgrown rose bush at the side of the house and aimed to appear behind it, though he didn’t have a clear picture of that spot in his head and nearly splinched himself.
But Harry shakes his head. “Later.”
“Er—three.”
Harry rises from a deep well of blackness and cracks open his eyes. He recognizes the potion-induced dullness a moment before he recognizes the spells breathing for him. There must also be a body-bind in place because he can’t move, can’t react. Thanks to the potion, he doesn’t panic. He drifts into wakefulness and knows a distant horror as his lungs fill and empty, fill and empty, and he thinks,
“Problem, Potter?”
“What else would I be using it for? I keep all of the cursed heirlooms in my flat.”
Harry went into the kitchen to make himself a sandwich. He had it with a glass of the iced tea. The nervousness he’d felt on his trip here had relaxed, but there was a new tension in him, a feeling like teeth gritting, like a spell waiting to go off but trapped.
Luna squeezed his fingers and continued to hold his hand. He didn’t mind; the contact was nice.
“I’m fine,” he says, voice rough.
Harry snorts and accepts the plate. “Plebeian? So the French are plebeian now?”
The air in the kitchen was motionless and smelled vaguely of recently-Transfigured wood and their meal. It sounded like the clink of forks on porcelain and Ron chewing.
“What? It’s nowhere near as good as yours.”
Draco slid a hand into Harry’s boxers. “You.” Gripped Harry’s erection. “I couldn’t die before you. That’s one game I won’t lose. I have to survive you, because in the end,
Draco stared in astonishment because…was Potter making a joke about one of his precious friends? And including Draco in on it?
Draco snorts. He straightens his shirt. “I’ll leave you to your alone time.”
Ginny grinned. “We thought maybe you’d taken off on your own.”
Harry’s head spins. He still hasn’t fully regained his breath from the walk to the courtroom. He left St. Mungo’s against his healer’s orders. He’s still furious with Hermione. She hadn’t told him about the hearing being held today. He learned about it in that morning’s
Who had pointed a wand at Dumbledore and let Death Eaters into the school.
It was the last Portkey that almost did Harry in.
Ginny bumped her shoulder against his. “Getting a proper goodbye.”
In the same calm, dubious tone, Harry says, “It looks like Malfoy’s gone to the press.”
While Malfoy blinks, apparently processing the insult, Harry stands. “I’ll get that tea.”
Draco met her at the fence. She panted to a stop, flyaway hairs wild around the handkerchief tied over her head.
“Ah…” he said, looking up at the huge menu.
Harry approached. He didn’t have to use force. Just the lightest pressure and he passed inside.
“Uh.” For a brief moment, Harry had no idea what Malfoy was asking. Then he remembered the drink in his own hands. He brought it to his mouth. The beer was fizzy and bitter. “It’s, um. It’s a little stronger than the other one. More of a grapefruit flavor?”
“Okay…”
“Overwhelm me?”
“He’s gone outside,” the Duchess said with a sniff.
The nice thing about living alone was there was no one around to see him.
“Yeah.”
“My—what?”
“It doesn’t smell like coffee.”
“What?”
His hand flops to the bed. “So they’re waiting for my release.”
“Harry. Hey. You’re awake. You’re fine, mate.”
Robards’ face appeared in flames gone green. “Potter,” he said severely, as if reprimanding him for conveniently being there when he called. “They reversed the potion.”
Just as his eyes began to glaze, she said, “You’ll probably want to sleep now. It’s quite late in London. There’s food in the icebox if you should get hungry. And we’re just downstairs if you need some company.” She stepped closer and grasped his hand again. “It’s all right, Harry. The first day is always a little discomfiting, but I promise you’ll feel better after sleeping. I always do.”
This time, when Harry squeezed out more lube, his hands were shaking. He slicked his cock and lifted Malfoy’s legs to set them over his shoulders. Malfoy watched him, eyes hooded. The look on Malfoy’s face made him want to kiss Malfoy again, but he didn’t.
“That’s rather domestic of you.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy make a face and felt a surge of satisfaction from ignoring him.
expect me to spend the night in that box, did you? I told you.”
Harry grasped his wand. Malfoy stared back, unwavering, but Harry paused.
Ginny licked beer from her lips. “Yeah. When’s the last time you went on a date?”
Harry looked, but the Erumpent had not yet begun to make its trip across the far field. Earlier, he’d heard the rattling of the Thunderbird, but it was silent now. The late morning lull had settled over the farm.
Potter took all of it in and said, “Malfoy, you realize I don’t sleep, right?”
“Draco usually sits in the Unicorn Room,” Luna said. “I think it’s sweet.”
“Coming,” Harry said, and hopped up. He wiped crumbs from his mouth and sent the plate back to the kitchen with a quick wand motion.
“The rosemary sounds like a nice addition. Last time you said that something was missing from the flavor profile. Does it feel more complete now?”
Malfoy glanced up. He looked unimpressed. “Honestly, Potter. I won’t bite.”
Harry couldn’t say anything. An ugly feeling filled his chest, and he wrestled with it.
Leave it to Malfoy to make a sandwich fancy.
She laughed.
“Good job,” Malfoy said.
“Uh. Thanks. Yeah. Long trip.”
in any way that Harry Potter had stumbled upon his quiet thinking space. His privacy had been violated.
Draco allowed himself a little smirk and opened the first book. “Now,” he said. “Tell me what you remember about the potion.”
With another furtive glance over his shoulder—the country lane still appears empty—he flicks his wand in his sleeve and tests the house’s wards.
Blast. Seal.
be having him on this time. Then it swung wide, and a wave of ink and parchment smells wafted out, along with the sound of voices.
For the first time, Harry can see the full headline and the large picture beneath it. The photo features Harry looking unblinking and tight-lipped straight into the camera.
At the mention of the house, Malfoy’s expression turned inscrutable.
The upstairs hallway was just as nice as the front and ground floor of the house (but it was different from the “nice” of Malfoy’s arse; that was a whole other category). There were some little paintings and photographs and nature-type things and Muggle—non-magical—things on the walls, but Malfoy didn’t point out any of the rooms or things up here. He took Harry straight past a bathroom (this must have been the “upstairs bathroom”) to a door at the end of the hall.
have an active imagination,” Draco muttered, even as he feverishly surveyed the periphery of his vision.
Harry folded his hands on the table. His wand pressed against his thigh in its holster. Sometimes he’d leave it on the table next to him, a casual threat and a way to mock the offender; fun, to see who paled at the sight of it, who tried to leap across the table in a wild grab. But those kinds of games would be an insult to Malfoy.
It’s Malfoy in his floo, looking simultaneously annoyed and sheepish in the way only Malfoy can, and he’s not insulting him or accusing him of making up stories.
, Malfoy said.
Friday morning finds Harry in his office going through a stack of records he called up from the archive for Malfoy and Hermione, who sent him in with a list. Most of it baffles him—pages and pages of public documents in technical jargon—but along with the list, Hermione provided him with a facsimile spell. He didn’t quite catch her hurried explanation early that morning as the sun was rising, but it sounded as if she’d be able to examine the copied files using a device somewhat like a pensieve. Harry reckoned it wasn’t precisely legal, but he hadn’t wanted to ask. Besides, these are public records. Harry is simply…expediting the process of retrieving them. By about three weeks.
“In Oregon? Five years.”
“And I thought I’d see if we could…chat. You know. Since you’re obviously a part of Ginny and Luna’s life.”
Hermione sinks into the chair at the bedside. Her face looks drawn and worried. “Harry. I need you to promise me— No, hear me out. I need your word that you will stay in hospital until your healer releases you. There’s nothing to be done right now. Do you understand me?”
Harry raises an eyebrow.
“Yeah. I saw him just a little bit ago.” He blinks, groping for his sense of orientation. He casts a look at the clock above the hearth. Cards a hand through his hair. “Buggering hell. It’s eight?”
But these letters were not meant for Harry. They weren’t meant to be lost to time, either. After long thought, Harry had decided that they belonged to Teddy for when he came of age. Let Teddy decide what he wanted to do with them. Harry only wished he had something of his parents.
The image of Malfoy crawling over him short-circuited his brain, and mutely, Harry slid over.
“No. I just expected…”
He thought he might have Teddy over for a week or two, but Andromeda informed him that the boy was visiting their family in France and wouldn’t return till shortly before the Hogwarts Express left for school.
Malfoy gasped. Harry felt a jolt of sensation down to his own cock at the warm squeeze around his finger. He pushed in a little and dragged back out, watching Malfoy’s face as he did so.
Harry smiled. “A night flight.”
A moment later, she’d disappeared through the cupboard door, leaving him alone.
“Elizabeth will love these flowers,” he said, and Draco smiled thinly, resigned, as Edward segued into a story about his wife’s flowerbeds, their small garden as a whole, their cat, the raspberries, and the jams Elizabeth planned to make that year. Draco nodded along, staunchly ignoring the scent rising from his person.
“What? We’re leaving? We didn’t find anything!”
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turn down. In his dangling fingers, the port glass—which he’d been idly swirling—goes still. Harry knows half a minute of confused feelings—his instant anger mixed with a just-as-sudden influx of regret and a heart-pounding emotion akin to fear. Then Malfoy says, “I was courting Astoria Greengrass. She was in the year below ours in school. Daphne’s younger sister. But I stopped when I realized it wouldn’t do for me—that no witch would.”
“I will hit you with this.”
“I try.” Draco sipped his tea. See? Civilized. Calm. Tea, toast, then the day starts. No madness before then.
She smiled. “I was going to bring it over anyway when I saw the girls were gone. I had kind of a feeling I knew where they went, so I brought it along with me.”
The first night after Malfoy’s interrogation, Harry woke to terrible nightmares.
“The hefeweizen is on special,” he drawled in Ginny’s direction.
“Wanker,” Malfoy muttered to Harry under his breath.
“I think it’s rather like a three-toed othelia den, myself. Grimmauld Place is dark, but it’s not smelly enough to be a bat cave.”
The third, he stays up till dawn creating tiny quiches—first mixing the dough by hand, then pressing it into tiny crusts, then filling them with savory custards.
Draco refilled the kettle at the tap deliberately by hand. After the first unexpected visit from Edward and his granddaughter Kara three years ago, Draco had removed anything overtly magical from the kitchen and sitting room, so the biggest risk of breaking the Statute remained forgetting himself and casting a bit of casual magic out of habit.
Harry blinks. “Okay?”
Something brushes against his cheek. A press. Soft and fleeting, then it’s gone.
“Did he do something?” She asks.
"I guess I shouldn’t be too hard on you, Potter, my apologies,” he sips his tea, smoky cardamom making his nose tingle. “I didn’t like her, still don’t,” he raises the hand Billy is hanging on, tapping his temple with his index finger, “but I can say that she’s a different type of intellectual. Because you can’t think like her, from the start, you’ve already lost. I was the perfect candidate, she wouldn’t give up on me just because she had Aurors out her door.”
“Alright. Seems like we’re gonna have to continue this next time," Harry concludes, moving the planchette toward the ‘Goodbye’ carved in the bottom of the board. “Good-”
“Thank you.”
“Pira-
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry’s hands can’t fall from his eyes, lest he imagines the damn thing cracking open and crashing onto the floor, leaving nothing left but millions and millions of tiny pieces. Delicate glass, delicate petals.
“What are
“Then, if you don’t hate me,” Potter lifts his head, peering into Draco’s eyes, “would it be so bad to go back with me?”
“Draco Malfoy, please sit down.”
The clock ticks on.
“And they’re both Romance languages. I can understand certain words and translate them for you.”
"Yes, fairy tales. I’m not famous, but, you know, I wrote them,” Draco smiles, a bit flushed at the thought of his works. He’s not showing his face at the library next week, though his illustrator will. Her art is gorgeous and she’ll teach the kids how to draw the characters.
“Yes,” Draco says, frantic now. He can’t seem to find the crate through his panic, “The seasons are all mixed up, forecasts have never been more wrong, even the lunar cycle is fucked. Muggles blame climate change, I blame Voldemort and his Dark creatures and idiotic rituals. Grammedion, hurry, where’s the Wolfsbane?”
“What about you? Shouldn’t you be collecting these also?”
I don’t believe it,” Draco mumbles, unable to do anything else but that. He hates how Potter’s palm on his cheek both warms and chills his bones, “I don’t believe it… shit, I don’t even have Wolfsbane,
“Who, then? Hermione? Ron? Tonks?
Has to get some drinks to start, then head to a proper club, it’s nearly the weekend. Avoid the crushing disappointment that Luna has no qualm hiding from him. Make it back home after midnight, way after Draco’s returned to pack his bags—he doesn’t like to stay out past 11—and
“Innovative,” Potter rolls his eyes at Draco’s tone. “You made it too easy, only going three, four times a week. She just had to walk in on one of your off-days and what happened? I turned in my notice and was gone a week later. How did your team take it?”
Ultimately, Potter breaks free, legs stretching as he bolts around the table and away from Draco. At least he has the sense to let go of Grammedion first. Before he leaps through the window and disappears into the forest, blood coating his muzzle, he throws Draco one last glance. Then he is gone.
“Dark Magic leaves a mark on both the wizard and their victim, doesn’t it? No need for a book to tell us that,” Potter says, the harsh afternoon glow of him gentled by the soft lamplight in Draco’s hallway. “In certain cases, it even leaves a link. A connection.”
Then, ‘where are they.’
Potter sniffs. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Hermione’s still telling me how stupid I was for volunteering,” he says. “I just, I thought it’d be good to check on you as well. It’s been years. Two birds, one stone.”
“And you did it perfectly.”
“Good,” Edmund whispers. At this point, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if that’s not even his real name, “good.”
“I told you to leave.”
“Oh, that’s, that’s just, I’m just doing my job.”
“That won’t be a problem,” Potter says. “I trust your heart will speak the truth for us both.”
“Yes,” Narcissa stirs her tea absentmindedly. She stares at him. “May I have a question for him in return?”
“Oh, no, never.”
Draco hums. “Mhmm, I say. Another ‘first’ for us.”
I admit this doesn’t sound fun at all. But as someone who’s worked here for longer than she can remember, once you’re used to all the quirks of this place, it’s worth it. High wages, no nosy bosses hovering over your shoulders, great benefits. You can do whatever you want in your office, as long as you follow the rules. Trust me, you’ll like this job.
“I hope you’re proud,” he says, when he’s sure Grammedion is conscious enough to hear him. “Look at you. Fucked with every single thing in this godforsaken cabin, now I can’t even make a simple anesthetic potion for you. I hope you’re lying there, knowing that you’ll be in pain for the next eight hours, knowing that you did this to yourself.”
“I’m not going back,” Draco says. “Look, regardless of her intentions, it’s not like Luna just dropped me off blind without preparation. I mean,” he rolls Billy over on his palm and scritches the soft underbelly, “I certainly didn’t know that the line between the Wizarding and Muggle world is so thin here, to the point where these sugar gliders are living right outside people’s homes. But again, nothing I can’t handle. If I have to rate, it’s five over five for customer service.”
“Yes,” he says, “but since I have to get a great number of ingredients in dark locales like this,” he hopes his nonchalant wave doesn’t tremble, “it’s infinitely safer and less time-consuming if I have both my hands free to work with.”
Draco peers up as he rises, hands around the package. Potter has his maddening Invisibility Cloak slung over his arm, his roguish charm heightened by a perfectly fitted three-piece suit. A tiny posy is pinned on his left lapel, muted green hellebores with a few sprigs of privet berries. He’s dressed like a man in love.
“I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true,” croons a singer in a song Teddy likes these days. Harry wonders if Ron’s also heard of that song, so he could use it to snap Harry out of his delusion.
Potter’s brows furrow as he tries to figure out how to explain the concept, but Draco cuts in.
“Why?” Hermione appears just as stunned as them.
“Jesus Christ, you’re so rash for an academic.”
“I was, but I knew, somewhat, that I wanted someone else,” Harry’s head lowers, slow and careful, until his forehead rests against Draco’s shoulder. “I told myself that I just liked the way it looked, had to get it in case I didn’t want the other ring anymore. But I got it a size smaller. Been carrying it in my pocket ever since.”
out of anything.”
Draco can't help but feel reluctant admiration leak past tendrils of dread. When he risked his life to Apparate here, he was confident that without a clear scent to chase after, Potter would give up.
“Hurry the fuck up.”
“There is an anomalous individual working here,” she says, hard lines etched on her face. “You will act like you’ve not changed your career and continue to ‘work’ in the Ministry. Because of your proximity, we expect you to gather as much information as possible about him. You can use any method, as long as you stay alive and well to report back to us and receive your salary. Not to worry, we will assist you as this individual is, like most of what we deal with, deadly when pushed.”
Draco runs and runs and runs. And soon enough, leaves crunch and rodents scurry from a second pair of feet, quickly gaining speed.
Draco gets on his feet, wincing at the static numbness in his bum and thighs and vowing to bring a sleeping bag everywhere from now on. His throat itches from the hair poking it, his neat bun having spilled out of its elastic some time as he napped. He shuffles to the door and unbolts the two heavy locks above the door handle, opening it to see the giant inky mass that is Potter in his dog form. His tongue lolls out as if he’s a common Crup and not, say, a murderous bear-sized wolf. His eyes have lost the ferocious heat from earlier, and are wide and hopeful as he pants at Draco. Of course, a good hour or two of venting the anger and bloodlust of first transformations in the wilderness probably does that to a werewolf. Makes them tired and docile and scurry back to wherever they came from.
“Yeah.”
Draco’s eyes open with a heavy drag, allowing in but a sliver of light. In the misty blurriness, he sees a smirk. One stark-white canine pulls the bottom lip inward, pierces through papyrus skin.
“Why didn’t you tell anyone?” Draco keeps running his hand through the light grey of his fur. “Why did you let it fester and infect you so? Did you worry you’d burden us? Do I- do we have to stick by your side at all times to make sure you’re safe?”
There is nothing left to say. Draco stares at his bloody wrists, utterly helpless.
. “I think having to choose between that and rotting in a back alley is at least a little bit pressuring.”
Draco pushes away as far as Edmund’s firm grasp allows, which is only a few centimeters away. Whatever his blood did with Draco’s own, it snaps him awake with startling clarity just as swiftly as when it’s reduced him to a little more than a rag doll. Everything is so sharp it’s almost disgusting, like his eyeballs are gouged out, scrubbed clean, then shoved back in again. Draco locks his legs, willing himself not to stumble.
All noises cease, leaving behind the squeaking of trainers against tiles. Draco doesn’t look up even as the sounds get closer to where he stands.
“Another one?”
He lifts his head up, meeting Draco’s unimpressed gaze with a smirk. “Perhaps one last kiss will be the balm I need. Come on, just one more for closure.”
“Perhaps in another universe,” he murmurs, resting an overheated hand over Little Billy’s back.
“No,” Grammedion backs away as if he can’t stand to be near Draco. A part of him breaks. In some ways, he is like the mentor Draco’s never had, his patience and perspective far superior to Severus's (bless his cold, dead heart). “You’re redeemed, aren’t you? Favored by the rest of the Order, especially Harry Potter. He argued for you, didn’t he? Nobody ever did for me.”
“What’s happened to you?” He asks after a moment.
Harry stares at the soup, stunned. Draco must have taken his expression as something else.
“I do,” Draco doesn’t, “just not at you,” but he likes to tease.
Potter clenches his jaw. Merlin, he’s easier to goad than Draco thought.
“I may be a bit absentminded these days, but I remember this,” Potter looks like he’s hearing Draco list out his crimes. “That savior complex of yours, always taking the blame. No, it’s not. There’s nothing that could keep me from serving my sentence. I can barely remember your testimony, let alone resent you for it.”
“The oddity in the mundane, Dr. Malfoy,” Dr. Stewart leans forward, a knowing look on her face. Draco’s legs feel like wooden trunks, sunken into the ground. “Get used to it, and get focused. Because if left unchecked, Harry Potter might very well get powerful enough to become a reality bender.”
“He never let anyone but him enter the fort, remember? Back when he’s still making us build it for him?” Draco’s fingers tap a random rhythm on Harry’s stomach. Harry tightens his arm around him, shifts a bit. “So many forts and I still didn’t know what it’s like to be in one.”
Draco focuses on his breathing.
Draco glances back at Edmund, who is staring at his lips. His hands run tiny circles over the small of Draco’s back.
“What do you,” Draco murmurs, sour notes of alcohol floating back into his nose, “what do you propose I do then? Just stand here and wait for them to get lost?”
Draco’s back straightens, and he moves his wand this way and that, orchestrating a cacophony of tomes and devices to levitate from the heavy bookshelves to the duffle bag he brought along.
One good thing about growing up too quickly is that Potter is mature enough not to argue back. He only narrows his eyes at Draco and makes him uncomfortably aware of the fact that if he steps a centimeter closer, he can feel Potter’s body heat.
Somebody downs a shot in the movie. Harry doesn’t quite register it. “I don’t think I’ve ever been in a proper one either until now. Didn’t have enough space in the cupboard. Plus, the hanging around the beds at Hogwarts felt pretty cozy by themselves.”
“How are you so sure there’s a connection.”
Harry takes a deep breath.
The severe edges on Potter have faded. Left behind is a handsome face, astonishing in its clarity. Taking in laugh lines and crow’s feet at the corner of lush-green eyes, Draco knows it’s the face of joy and love and being loved. That face doesn’t belong in this lonely village and this lonely cottage. Potter belongs in his own world.
“Oh, yes. Cold weather is hell on my nerves, can't let my extremities be exposed to the elements. Can’t drink coffee, either,” Draco pats his mug. “Caffeine-free. Very good brand, this, phenomenal taste. I can recommend it to you,” he tilts his head, “though I’m not sure if they have it there.”
“Sometimes,” Draco says, lowering the speaker volume, “not doing crimes… is worse.”
“Noted. Good luck, Jaclynn.”
Another moronic question, but slightly more intuitive. Draco suppresses his urge to slow-clap.
“Hello?” Harry says into the dark. He’s just gotten home and instead of seeing the familiar orange hue of their beetle-shaped lamp (a gift from Luna, of course), there’s a single sliver of moonlight slipping through the curtains. Nothing else seems to exist in the living room but the echo of Harry’s greeting. Tangerine and sage drift into his nose, followed by the bitter tang of smoke. The scent of Draco’s favorite candle, newly extinguished.
Draco doesn’t need to think; he’s done enough of that in the past two months, since the day he opened his front door to see the strange woman’s sharp smile. But he thinks anyway, one last time before he answers.
[crackling sound]
Potter moves from Draco’s wrists to his cheeks and lips, which is most likely as hygienic as eating a serving of pasta off the floor. But after all the shit Potter has gone through in the past few hours, Draco dare says Potter has gained the right to do whatever he wants at this point. Potter prods his cold nose against the underside of Draco’s jaw and pushes his head against Draco’s neck, nuzzling and licking. It’s a bit odd, but Potter hasn’t bitten a chunk off his face yet, thus he doesn’t move. The wolf gets up from its seat on the floor and walks around Draco, moving in a way that his body would brush up against every square centimeter of Draco’s upper half. His massive figure and weight jostle Draco back and forth. Soon enough, a laugh slips out, unbidden, and Draco’s shoulders shake when Potter sets his front paws on Draco's thighs to rub his face on Draco’s hair.
Harry watches him brush nonexistent dust off his jean-clad knees and stand up.
Levitating Grammedion to a corner, Draco sets him down and Conjures a metal cage with bars gridded all around him. One can never be too careful, even if the son of a bitch they’re dealing with is incapacitated. Sighing, Draco squeezes the area where an awful cramp has the gall to flare up and casts a Patronus charm. A silvery blue Thestral flies into existence, batting its wings and playfully nips Draco’s ear with its skeletal jaw. Draco smiles and asks it to inform Granger of Potter’s transformation and to bring back-up.
“There will be more of Fenrir’s attacks on the next Full Moons.”
“—so uncouth. We have to approach—”
Not very certain of what to say, Draco purses his lips instead. Edmund lets out an amused hum and indulges him, sucking on his bottom lip. It’s good, so good, until it becomes sickening, like raiding the entirety of Fortescue’s stockroom. Being a creature of the night is rapidly losing its novelty.
It takes not even twenty seconds.
“Oh. Okay.”
“Life will be even more interesting when I get to live it, actually.”
Divide from the inside. Begrudgingly, Draco is impressed. He’s even more impressed at himself for somehow pissing off enough people and creatures alike to be in the middle of a conspiracy.
Draco should be running away. He must be running away. But his chest aches at the sight.
“What is Harry Potter doing in this file?”
“A different universe, even,” Draco says.
His husband’s level of theatrics is directly proportional to how slow Harry is at doing what he says, so he nods, fondness overflowing, and obeys.
His glasses have been pushed up without noticing, leaving space for his hands to press against closed eyes. Stars burst behind his eyelids, a squeezing pain. He presses harder like he’s got something to prove.
“Is “somewhere else” the recycling center?”
“You don’t have to apologize,” Draco says. “If you have any questions, Tessa can help you. She’s the one with brass arms and works at your table. Enjoy your meal, sir.”
“Stop zoning out,” Potter’s voice cuts through his assessment. “I mean, no rush. But the sooner we leave, the better.”
Cold ankles pressed against bare calves, Harry is already deep asleep when the credits roll.
“Oh,” Hermione says. Then she does a weird thing where she draws her towel tighter around herself and tilts her head, peering up at Viktor as if she’s seeing him for the first time.
“I don’t know,” Draco lightly bounces Little Billy into the air. He floats down like a parachute, “since I’ll never try.”
The arm Potter had in his mouth earlier has limped to the ground, more meat than skin. Between unfurled fingers lies Draco’s wand. It’s bloodied but not mangled, and Draco does quick work at cleaning it at the sink. Then, kneeling by Grammedion’s broken form, he casts as many healing spells as he can remember. Although, the thing about using spells instead of potions and hands-on equipment is that even though they work, they take a while.
“What’s all this?” He crouches and crawls in, eyeing the collection of pillows and quilts surrounding Draco and what would be Harry’s seat. It seems that he had also lugged in the chairs from their dining room to provide some structural support for the tent.
“Okay, sure, ex-Death Eater face. Who, except you?”
Just as Potter’s huge, black claws snag on his cloak and tear, Draco does the last thing he is supposed to do. He Disapparates.
“Oh.”
Harry looks up from his slippered feet to see Draco. Or, more specifically, Draco’s silhouette. Behind some kind of white cloth. A white cloth that’s conveniently placed where the focus of the bedroom should’ve been.
“Phoenix’s tears,” Draco rasps out the password, and the heavy oak door swings open.
Potter struggles and writhes, determined to escape and go on with his man-eating business. Draco tightens his hold, feeling tendons and muscles strain against his arms. Potter growls and barks, jouncing Grammedion’s body as he jerks his head from side to side. Feet glued to the floorboards, Draco stands his ground.
Sweet, sweet wine.
A shivery sigh. “Yes.”
He is not omnipotent. The Boy King has a king of his own.
It’s a display of affection between packmates, Draco recalls, a way of saying “I like you. I want you to smell like me.” Draco smiles indulgently when Potter's enthusiasm almost knocks him on his ass. Why doesn’t Potter act more like this normally? Sure, Draco doesn’t need to be licked at every turn, but seeing Potter knock back drinks with his friends, get enveloped in Sirius and Remus' arms, even have inside jokes with Order members he's not closed with...
“Let’s discuss.”
The Indicator can lighten or increase in weight at Draco’s will, a fickle little feature that he’s glad Weasley R. reminded him of. Holding the chain with both hands, he swings it in a circle at his side as he sprints, uncaring about its original purpose.
Draco dashes over, hands clammy. The cart there's wheels squeak on the wooden floor, and he grabs a handful of vials.
One Narcissa Malfoy remains unimpressed, however. Strange, considering she’s the one who wrote three letters consecutively to plead for a moment of his time like he wouldn’t readily accept.
However, there are two words he can’t mistake, no matter how sleep-deprived he is or how blind. A name, in fact.
“I said no!”
“Okay, but why are we even going there? Didn’t you and the other Potioneers stock up on all the important potions?”
“Hmm, what, what’s going on?” Harry rubs his eyes as he sits up.
“Seeing that today was the last straw. I had to leave.”
“Are you—um,” he says to Hermione, his accent weighing on each pronunciation and dragging it down, “I’m sorry.”
“Our goals are different; the SCP Foundation wants to keep humanity safe and alive, you want knowledge and just knowledge. But I hope you find yourself in your element while working with us, finally having access to all the information you’ve been working so hard to find out.”
Harry nods, suppressing a shiver. It’s cold out, middle of November, and one touch of Draco’s hand is enough to tell Harry that he’s fresh from the shop, sweaty and too warm. Squeezing the palm on his shoulder, he smiles up at Draco. The man watches at his expression for a second before retrieving his hand from Harry’s grasp.
“Hey, uh, sorry, do you wa-”
3 dried petals of waterlily tulips added every 3 minutes. The solution will weep into a rolling boil.
“Hmm. Are you cold?”
He realizes it now. There has never been any choice.
Harry sighs. Unlaces his boots and hangs up his coat absentmindedly only for it to crumple onto the floor. Another sigh. He bends and retrieves it, deciding instead to throw it in the laundry bin. Might as well; he’s been trudging around in Dayhound mucus for hours and neither his dragonhide boots nor coat was spared.
How strange.
[pause]
Draco stays silent, even as Potter rustles in his innumerable pockets and grumbles when he can’t seem to find what he’s searching for. Before Draco knows it, Potter hums in pleasant surprise.
“Out of all things,” a gravelly whisper pressed against skin, “why can’t I keep you?”
“Okay, enough, enough, thanks,” he says, tapping the muscular arm around him and turning away. Edmund only continues his little ministration below Draco’s jaw.
Draco eyes him like he’s sick in the head. “To cry over being dumped by the Great Savior, why else?”
“What about you?”
The sound of movement stops. “Oh,” Grammedion says, “The Full Moon? A bit early this month, is it not?”
“Know what? No, I don’t care. Leave at once, else I’d alert the Aurors.”
Last month’s Full Moon was Fenrir’s worst attack yet. He and his pack of rabid followers were ordered to venture into Muggle villages and ravage whatever they could get their hands on. Thankfully, the Order had known about this weeks before and worked tirelessly to keep the Muggles safe and unaware in their own homes. However, as the Order has grown in members, Fenrir’s pack has also grown in size, and they did a number on the villages’ infrastructure and resources. It was a difficult few days for the Order to both contain the attack and spin a story that a hurricane had passed by.
trust Lovegood. He leaned against the doorway, staring at his feet so he didn’t have to see anyone looking at him. “You’re in good hands.”
“Consider this a gift. Don’t expect anything fancy for dinner.”
“You and your sweets.” Still, Draco grabbed the jar of honey and set it beside his son. “Not too much. Juice or water to drink?”
Blaise had already pulled out the closest chair for Potter to fall back into. Lovegood ran a hand through Potter’s hair before sliding her fingers down his face. Potter let his eyes close, a ragged breath dragging through his lungs. Blaise pressed a kiss to Lovegood’s cheek before moving to help out with Weasley getting dinner ready.
“Are you like us?” he asked suddenly, causing Draco to tense.
His only answer was Blaise’s laughter as they made their way to the kitchen. Draco followed behind the trio, hoping that they could be at least somewhat subtle about why exactly they were here. There was no telling how Potter would take to learning who he was, what he had gone through. Part of Draco wanted to just let him be, let him start a new life.
“Get inside, you asshole.” He stepped aside to allow Blaise and the two women inside. “He’s in the kitchen.”
But being simply Draco Lucius Malfoy, Assistant Manager of Henderson’s Books and father of Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, made him happy. He would take that happiness over all the gold in Gringotts any day.
house was where I needed to be.”
“We’ll find our way to the door,” Ginny said with a nod to their joined hands. “Enjoy your evenings, boys.”
Criminals didn’t knock, did they? Draco stared at the door, not sure if he should open it. He must have taken too long because the knock came again, a bit louder this time. Broom still in hand, Draco took a deep breath, reached forward, and jerked the front door open.
“I did it!” Scorpius sat up, a wide smile on his face. “I’ve been trying to get him three times now.”
“Of course, I’m sorry. I could even just walk to wherever it is... Hospital? Yes, a hospital. I can walk.”
Potter nodded and reached for the closest mug and a random tea bag. “Sorry if it sounds confusing. I’m not sure... Well, I’m not sure of anything.”
“No need to apologize, I’m sure.”
Potter gave a lame wave as Draco shut the door. He stood in the hallway for a moment or two before pulling out his wand and putting up the wards and charms. Satisfied he would wake if Potter opened his door, he went to his own room to start his letter to the youngest Weasley.
.” Luna’s voice interrupted them both and it was then that Draco realized she had never once turned her attention away from where Harry sat, half-obscured behind the till. “You found him...”
“Then?”
Blaise puffed up his chest a bit, wrapping an arm around the waist of both women. “I got lucky and married them both.”
Lovegood just shrugged as Potter turned to frown at Draco. “She means I’m the same one that disappeared. Same age and everything.”
“What’d I miss?” he asked, trying to ease some of the tension.
Draco watched the three of them leave and Blaise take the dishes to the sink before he finally went upstairs. He knocked once on his son’s door before pushing it open and sticking his head in, smiling when he saw Scorpius on his bed, legs kicking in the air as he lay on his stomach with a game system in his hands.
Draco couldn’t take his eyes off of the flush that came over Potter’s face at the cover description and all he wanted to do was see just how far that red tint went down the man’s shirt. Pulling himself away from the temptation to add to Potter’s apparent embarrassment (or interest?), he just nodded and motioned for Weasley to follow him.
Blaise leaned over Lovegood’s shoulder and added, “And one with big tits on the lead.”
Potter reached across the table, resting his hand over Draco’s own. “It must be hard being a single parent even without that.”
“If our positions were reversed, I’m sure you would do the same thing.” Draco offered him a hesitant smile. “Goodnight. We’ll figure this out in the morning.”
Draco set the broom against the wall before heading to the linen closet down the hall. He grabbed two of the larger towels, still not completely sure that his mind wasn’t playing tricks on him and wondering if he was making the right decision. When he returned to Potter, he held out the first towel and tried to ignore the feeling in his stomach as the other man smiled.
Draco’s eyes snapped to Potter’s face. He looked relaxed, even more so than he had been earlier in the bookstore. Even throughout their school years, the only time he had seen that look on the man’s face had been on a broomstick. Maybe. He had to look away, almost afraid at just how much he liked seeing it.
School sure as hell felt like a prison when he attended.
“Even then,” Draco promised. If the guy was nuts, he could always lock him in a room while he called the police. “What happened?”
“It’s okay,” Weasley said, easing away. “I’ll get dinner plated.”
He motioned between them all. “What exactly...”
Scorpius shook his head and picked his fork back up. “Nope, because magic is a gift and we should be careful with it. Just like you said.”
Weasley wrinkled her nose. “Don’t be a dolt, he came to
Draco opened the front door and immediately had to duck. “Watch it, Blaise!”
“A birthday?” Weasley asked, voice gentle as she rested a hand on Lovegood’s back. “Loud place with a lot of red--”
With a snort, Draco shook his head and shoved lightly at the other man. “He’s too young to be Potter.”
“I know, which is why I don’t think it’s him.”
Draco shook his head. “Not that I can think of.”
, Draco’s mind supplied, but he didn’t say it. Who knew what Potter was actually thinking of. “Don’t try to force memories. Either you’ll remember or you won’t.”
“I’m not-!”
Potter’s hands tightened on Lovegood’s shoulders before he looked right at Draco. “I remember her, but I can’t... Did you call them to the bookstore to see me?”
Who knew all it took for Potter to flirt with him was a loss of all his memories. Draco just smiled, glad he really didn’t need to answer since the wards flared to life. He turned his hand so he could squeeze Potter’s before standing and motioning for him to stay where he was. While he had wished for seven to come faster before, now he wished he had more time to see where this might have gone.
Potter shook his head with a laugh. “They aren’t bothering me. Actually, they’re fun. Ginny here says the four of you went to school together?”
“Just don’t kill each other.” Blaise leaned in to give them each a hug as well. “And remember that sometimes memories are confusing. You might only be remembering half of something and not the whole story.”
“And salad for some reason.” Weasley leaned up to kiss his cheek. “Mind if we use your plates? Thanks.”
Scorpius put his fork down so he could count on his fingers. “The moon has to be closest to Earth, it has to be the second full moon of the month, and it has to be a total lunar eclipse. And it’s because of where the moon and Earth are at that makes this happen.”
Harry licked his lips before letting out a breath. "I think I remember... something. It happened when Luna told me I was a wizard and Ginny took out her wand."
“Dinner in five minutes!” he called out, pulling the pot off the burner. “You can finish watching the Sanderson sisters later, okay?”
“This is perfect, thanks.” Potter shifted to get into a more comfortable position and soon the two of them eased into a comfortable silence of turning pages and Draco’s scratching pencil.
“I’ll get your clothes dry for tomorrow. For now, just rest.” Draco flicked the light on. “Bathroom is connected through that door. If you need anything, just knock on my door. Last one down the hall.”
-Hermione and Ron didn't last after Harry "died." Ron is with a muggle girl and Hermione actually married Krum before going to teach a new version of Muggle Studies (which is now required for Wizards -- a new class for Wizard customs is also required for Muggleborns or those who didn’t grow up in the wizarding world).
"Don't force it," Draco reminded him. "Just let it come naturally."
The television blissfully turned off before Scorpius came into the room. “Macaroni and cheese?”
“Can we just pretend this is a normal night?” Draco asked, trying not to sound like he was begging. “Please?”
Thankfully, the mystery man (and honestly, he was going to keep calling him ‘Potter’ for ease of his own mind) stayed by the fire, arms still wrapped around his chest. Without a word, Draco handed him the extra clothes and left him alone to change. He couldn’t see the living room from the kitchen, so it would give Potter plenty of privacy to change.
Weasley rolled her eyes and nudged him with an elbow. “Damn right you got lucky. Lucky we put up with you and didn’t run away ourselves.”
“Take your time. You said you came to and didn’t recognize anything?”
Lovegood nodded her thanks before slipping her wand out of her sleeve. “What did the castle look like?”
to describe what he had with Potter. Rivalry, for sure at the beginning. When that had blurred into some mutual form of respect and loathing, he couldn’t tell.
“I didn’t send you a message, I sent one to--”
Draco jerked a bit, Potter’s sudden presence by his side a surprise. “What?”
“How did you get here?”
Potter would be this accommodating even if he couldn’t remember his life. It had always just been who he was. “We’ll worry about it in the morning. Let me show you to your room.”
Potter snorted. “It’s barely been a day, give me a break.”
Potter’s shoulders slumped. “I wouldn’t know, would I?”
Something in Draco twisted at the fact that he remembered Granger. “You remember her?”
“Why?”
He hoped.
“Are you comfortable enough for an explanation?”
“You’re a real charmer, Draco Malfoy. Do you use that on just anybody?”
The man standing in front of him now could have stepped out of those photographs, down to what could have been an Auror robe had it not been muddied and torn. His face even looked the same, still slightly young in its appearance, and Draco suddenly felt seventeen all over again, panicked and wondering what the hell his life was about to be like.
“He is a great kid, he’s my kid.” Draco rubbed at his eyes. “Too curious for his own good, sometimes, but he’s great.”
The last thing Draco wanted to do was admit she was right. “I have a son to think of.”
With a whoop of joy, Scorpius all but skipped to the cabinets. Draco kept the plates and such on the lower cabinets so Scorpius could set the table whenever needed. While Draco had responsibility suddenly thrust upon him, he wanted better for his son. He didn’t want his son to grow up a snob, demanding others do the easiest things for him. Raising him in the middle of the Muggle world with little to no contact with his former life had been the best decision of Draco’s life.
Potter’s face twisted in thought and, after a moment, he looked at Blaise. “Hermione... Granger?”
Draco knew he had to give Potter
“Sorry, but no... We weren’t friends.” Not for Draco’s horrible attempt at trying. “I put us off on a bad foot and we were...” Draco waved a hand, not sure how
“You know who I am?”
“That isn’t the
Draco recalled rumors that it was the same spell Pettigrew cast before the traitor went into hiding, but he had also disappeared into the Muggle world not long after the incident. He could still remember the memorial images splattered everywhere -- including the one they used of Potter dressed up in his new Auror robes looking fierce and proud.
She let out a sigh, shoulders deflating. “I know, I get it, but it’s just for a few hours. I’m sure Luna has some books she wants to look through to make sure she’s casting the right charm. Please?”
“Good.” She sighed, looking down the stacks toward where Potter and the others were. “He still looks...”
Lovegood patted Draco’s cheek as they passed. “We brought roast.”
“You did it!”
“This is Harry,” Lovegood said, rubbing Weasley’s back. “The same Harry that disappeared.”
“Yeah!” Scorpius sat up straighter in his chair. “Why can’t the moon always look like that?”
“I’m proud of you.” Draco ruffled his son’s hair before pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “It’s time for bed, now.”
“She wasn’t one for children. Not really.” He shrugged as Potter’s face turned to one of concern. “It’s not a problem, honest. He’s probably the best thing that’s happened to me and I could care less what she does now. I’m just angry that she doesn’t think about him more.”
Draco took a quick detour to make sure Scorpius was still tucked away in bed. Once he made sure his son’s snores could still be heard, he kept going to his own room to grab a pair of sweats and a sweater. He dug around for a moment before taking his wand from its hiding place and sliding it up his sleeve.
Meeting a Muggle woman and not knowing the first thing about sexual protection without a wand led him to have Scorpius in the first place. Nobody wanted to hire a former Death Eater, even one pardoned by
“Yes, of course. If you didn’t defeat the evil troll, your characters would have surely suffered.” Draco stood. “They’re safe now, so time to brush teeth and sleep.”
this to be Potter and the more confirmation he got that this was his past come to haunt him, the more uncomfortable he became.
Draco wanted to say no, to guard that secret from Potter almost on instinct, but he held back that urge. There was no point -- it wasn’t as if his hot-headed best friend would find out and tease him for it. He took a steadying breath, letting it out slowly.
Maybe.
Blaise nodded and leaned forward. “Pretty sure I know what curse this is, then. We’ll look into it when we get home tonight.”
? Why just this one?”
“Let’s just get dinner sorted,” Draco said as they poured into the kitchen. “I’m starving and you’re obviously late and--”
Potter shrugged. “Is Draco Malfoy flirting with me?”
Not that it mattered anymore.
“That sounds like a beautiful castle,” Lovegood said as Weasley rolled up the parchment. “Maybe soon we can find the exact one and ask for a visit?”
Nobody really knew of Potter’s home life before Hogwarts despite the wild set of rumors, so Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to that. But he was good at recommending books and he could do that. “Any thought of what you might like to read?”
This house, the only one on the block with a wizard inside. Draco rubbed at his left arm, wondering if this might instead be some trick the Aurors were trying. Right after the war, they never seemed to need a reason to torment former Death Eaters like Draco who had been nothing but victims of the Dark Lord. It was one of the many reasons he left.
- on her lower back. “Should we bring anything specific?”
“Bushy hair and usually with a book?” Potter smiled a little. “Fierce and determined. I think so?”
“I’m sure I read some of these, not that I remember, so I just thought...”
