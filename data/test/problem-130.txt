Lord only knows when the next chapter will come out. Somewhere in the second half of June from how things look right now. Your comments keep me motivated and boost my energy so keep them coming, they are lovely.
He smiled fondly at the spot Soup had disappeared from before shrinking the board and slipping it into his pocket before heading out to check on the trainees. He should probably get Aadhya as well. Chances were he’d be suspended soon so he needed to catch someone up to Potter’s status in case he had to take his hands off at a moment’s notice.
Harry was back in the exact same room, the same empty pastoral scene mocking him from the wall. He’d sent Draco home after he fell asleep in the chair while they waited for Ron to come round and update them on the case.
"Not much further, Malfoy, don't worry I'm not going to kill you. You were doing a remarkable job of that yourself today," Harry replied, checking the map to make sure they were going in the right direction.
"We can't go up," Harry mentioned. "It's been restricted since a guy jumped off." It was an extremely crass way of putting it but it was satisfying to see Malfoy's cheeks tinge with shame at the indelicate remark. "Do you know what this is?" he asked.
"A lion?" Malfoy commented as his eyes fell on the lion's head tattoo over his left pectoral. "Leaning into the Gryffindor golden boy image, much?" His teasing was gentle, meant to distract him from the cold fingers tracing the lines of curse damage up his arm and crawling over his shoulder. Harry didn't mention the actual meaning of it, it was irrelevant now.
“Healer Malfoy.” Brown called him after wiping off a rune from Harry’s chest “The patch” She pointed at the square of enchanted gauze keeping the hole in his chest stoppered. Malfoy stepped up to take a look at it and hummed.
. A shiver ran down Harry's back; he didn't trust still cave waters, especially when there was Dark Magic running rampant very close to it. He turned to inspect the rest of the room and check for lingering magic in the walls. There was something in the way the rock was striped that niggled him into checking, and when he found isolation wards, he knew something was up.
“Well we don’t have to be friends then, but I’m still not letting you go through whatever this is, on your own,” Harry says, “You can talk to me if you want, or you can completely ignore me, but I’m not going anywhere right now.”
“No you don’t,” Draco interrupts, “because if you did we wouldn’t be having this conversation, I am a vampire, you knew I was a vampire when you agreed to go out with me, and suddenly, seeing me as who I truly am, makes you uncomfortable, therefore I think we’re done here,” Draco says, “You should go, and don’t come back.”
Draco watches Harry’s expression change from one of confusion to one of curiosity, “We’re from two different worlds.”
Harry eyes Draco suspiciously, but takes a seat at the table across from Draco, watching him curiously.
Harry feels shame at that, Draco was right and he was being rude, “I’m sorry,” he says meeting Draco’s eyes.
Draco sighs, “I know it sounds mad, but I left Gargoyle’s Hideout with Oliver, and we went to another pub and had firewhiskey.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “Proud Slytherin,” he mutters sliding down to the floor, keeping his keens close to his chest.
Harry actually scoffed, and Draco can’t say that he blamed Harry for that, he probably would have done the same.
Before Draco could say anything else, he heard an audible click in his ears and quickly moved to cover his mouth with his hand.
that you love someone,” Harry says, “and you don’t have to run from that feeling, because I feel it too Draco,” he says looking back at Draco.
Draco thinks hard, he vaguely remembers making Blaise promise him something, he’s not sure if that was what he made him promise though, “I remember asking you to make sure I went through with it.”
“Potter, I cannot decode whatever it is you’re trying to say right now, you’re going to have to use complete sentences,” Draco says.
Draco nods in agreement while reaching up and taking his earrings off, setting them onto the bedside table.
When Draco’s eyes fly open he’s lying in bed, and his sheets are anything but dry. A mixture of sweat and semen making everything around him sticky, and Draco can’t say he’s not embarrassed. He hasn’t woken up covered in his own semen in about four years. The fact that his wet dream had been about Harry Fucking Potter, only made it that much more embarrassing. Draco slips his hand under his pillow, pulling his wand out, “Tergeo,” he mutters, siphoning away the evidence of his sex dream.
“Bottom fangs should be easy to line up against the muscle in her neck,” Neil says softly, as if not to break Draco’s concentration.
Harry was rather hungry, he lets go of Draco’s hand, “I’m going to make a coffee,” Harry says to him.
Harry smiles, “Goodnight Ginny,” he says, watching as Ron saunters over to him, plopping himself down onto the sofa beside Harry.
After five more minutes of dancing, Draco leans over, “I’m ready for that drink now,” he says into Blaise’s ear.
Draco steps out of the fireplace in his living room and walks into his bedroom. Before Draco can even think about undressing, he hears the fireplace whir.
“Oh nothing, but I think the Moondew tends to be happier when there’s Flitterbloom nearby, and I want the Moondew to be really nice next month, so I can make some Wiggenweld potion for one of my alchemy experiments,” he says.
For some reason, Harry hadn’t expected Draco to be very funny, but he was finding him very amusing right now.
“I don’t bite, I swear,” Draco says, and then smiles when Toby takes his hand, walking them back to an empty booth toward the back of the club. Draco falls into the booth, and Toby slides in next to him.
Draco looks back at Harry, this time he allows himself to push the hair away from Harry’s eyes, “It’s not because you’ve done anything wrong, I just am, quiet that is,” he says, “I would say something if I didn’t like it, but this is me telling you, that I like everything you’re doing, and I want you to continue,” he says.
Five minutes later Draco comes out of the bathroom, walking back to the bedroom, “Potter?” he calls out.
“Use your tongue to feel her pulse, it’ll be strong, and it should flow quickly, but you can slow the flow with some pressure, and you stop before her pulse gets too slow,” he says.
Draco looks at Harry, “because I let you,” he says, “ask anyone else about me, and they’ll tell you I’m an asshole, but I let you see things about me, that I would never let other people see.”
Draco sighs, it was his birthday, and he did want a drink, he’d rather drink from Izzie, if he couldn’t drink from Harry, but he was extremely attracted to Cami, and it couldn’t hurt to just have a little taste.
“I don’t know, I’m not a vampire healer,” Draco says, “I only know what I’ve been told, and I don’t even know any vampires with immunity to ask.”
“Ah,” Harry murmurs, glancing back at his notepad, “Theodore Nott was at Winsworth’s Bridge that evening, and said he saw you outside.”
Harry looks back at Draco, “It sounds like you’re trying to say that you want to be with me,” he says.
Draco returns to his bedroom, having every intention of going right to bed. Draco walks into the bedroom, before tripping and stumbling into the bathroom, “Oh,” he says, he hadn’t even noticed the sound of the shower running.
The bond is created when the victim drinks the blood of the vampire, prior to the vampire draining the blood from their victim. Once the victim has been drained, and their lifeforce drained, the vampire either leaves the victim to rebirth on their own, or the vampire can create a bond. Whilst the human victim is dead, the vampire will feed their blood to the human, and be with them in the dark for twelve hours. The victim will be reborn from the blood of the vampire, and with the vampire in close proximity upon awakening, this process will bond the two vampires together for life.
“Vampires that live in these underground covens are very dangerous, they surface only to feed, kill, and create more vampires.”
Draco and Harry arrive back at Draco’s flat a few hours later, Draco steps out of the fireplace, shrugging off his cloak, and taking his shoes off, “I’m starving,” Draco says, walking into the kitchen, “Are you hungry?” he asks.
A bit of kink negotiation, implied sexual content, a bit of vampire lore I've made up and based off of a combination of Harry Potter, the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead, and the True Blood/Sookie Stackhouse series/ The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris, a tiny bit of a mischievous Ginny Weasley, and some Femslash but blink and you'll miss it.
Draco doesn’t know what to say, so he says nothing, and pulls Harry down for a long kiss letting his tongue meet Harry’s, not fighting for dominance but letting one another occupy the same space as they kiss. When they pull apart Harry looks at Draco for confirmation.
Harry smiles sleepily, “Maybe I don’t want a way back,” he says softly, linking his hand with Draco’s.
It’s nearly four in the morning when the last of Draco’s friends leave his house, Draco was slightly intoxicated and wanted to go to bed. Draco quickly changes into his pajamas, before finishing off the last of the blood wine.
Draco will never admit, even to himself, the fact that he misses the warmth and weight Harry’s arms around his body provides a sort of comfort to him. But Draco would admit that “you know, I’ve never really had sex in a shower before.”
Ginny rolls her eyes, “I’m going to bed because I’m tired not because you told me to” she says, “Goodnight Harry,” she calls over.
Hermione gets up, walking down to the girl's dormitory leaving Harry alone with his thoughts, which on second thought wasn’t the best place for Harry to be right now.
Harry looks at Draco for a moment before he clears his throat, shaking his head free of any previous thoughts he had, “I’ll talk to Oliver, see what he knows,” Harry says.
Draco Malfoy was a gay vampire, no one was going to love him. His own parents didn’t even love him anymore. Harry would never understand what it was like to be Draco. Draco Malfoy had fallen from grace. Draco was at one-point wizarding royalty, Harry Potter lived in the cupboard under the staircase. Draco Malfoy got anything he wanted simply because he asked, Harry Potter had to actually work for something if he wanted it. Draco was the one who suddenly didn’t know who he was, or what he stood for, and Harry had figured out exactly who he was and what he stood for. Harry Potter would never understand what it was like to be Draco Malfoy.
Harry clears his throat, “I wasn’t at that party last week because Luna asked me to be there,” he says.
Harry feels himself visibly blush this time, “er-no,” he says, reaching into his cloak pocket pulling out a notepad, “Uh, have you ever heard of Winsworth’s Bridge?” Harry asks.
“Merlin’s saggy left bollock, what the hell is it now?” Draco exclaims, walking through to the living room, “Potter? What the hell are you doing here?”
Harry can’t say that isn’t true because Draco is right, without blood, he would be a creature who kills to survive.
Draco scoffs, he was sure he was a sight to see right now, “Is this important?” Draco asks, not bothering to retract his fangs.
Harry steps inside the room and Draco closes the door behind him, “sit anywhere I guess,” he says walking back to his glass.
Harry looks back at Draco, “I spent my entire life fighting against the world,” he says softly, “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life fighting against myself.”
Blaise looks at Draco for a moment, before giving in putting his hands on Draco’s waist, letting himself move against Draco with the music.
Blaise cocks an eyebrow at Draco, “I’m not trying to be weird, I’m just asking” he says looking back at Draco.
Harry smiles, “of course,” he says, “next time, I get blackout drunk, you can take care of me,” he smirks.
“I haven’t slept since I found out,” she says, “I stayed for three days by your bedside, I left for the first time this morning, to shower and change my clothes, I was going to come back straight away.”
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco, he was done, he did not have time for this, “Draco,” Harry says warningly.
Harry nods, watching after Draco watching for a minute before sighing heavily, slumping down in his seat. Five minutes later Harry gets up clearing the table. Harry starts to wonder about Draco when he doesn’t see him after two hours.
Draco had heard of Winsworth’s Bridge, it was an upscale wizarding establishment, that catered to the wealthier wizarding community, his parents had his sixteenth birthday party there, invited everyone they knew, and spent a lot of money on it.
Draco takes Harry’s hand, letting him help him up, “Maybe the next time you come over it could be for fun,” Draco says.
Harry looks at Draco, completely confused by this story, “Why would you go to a pub with Oliver Rivers for firewhiskey when you were already at a pub with your friends?”
Harry sighs, letting go of Draco’s hand, “Alright then,” he says deciding he couldn’t push the issue further because that would get him nowhere.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Hermione I can finish that in two minutes considering,” he says, pushing the parchment to the corner of his desk, leaning back in his chair.
“I’m ready,” she says moving her long blonde hair away from her neck, and Draco bites into her neck, piercing her vein before sinking his bottom fangs into her muscle as her blood begins to flow into Draco’s mouth, and he swallows quickly.
“What are you doing?” Draco says looking down at Harry, whose dark hair was lying against his chest.
“It’s okay mate, you didn’t do anything wrong, sometimes things get messy,” he says, “especially when you’re new at it.”
“Take away these stunningly good looks, starve me of blood for a few days, and I am that feral creature, with only the need for sustenance to stay alive, the only thing that separates me from that is simply bloodlust.”
Draco watches him for a minute, was Harry seriously trying to be his friend right now, “Well I’m still not feeding in front of you,” he says, “humans get weird about stuff like that.”
“Well I did, and I’m fine,” Draco says, “and I don’t need you feeling whatever this is right now,” he says.
Draco also thinks that true, at the few parties he’d been to with vampires, they definitely weren’t shy about feeding in front of others.
“Yeah, what’s the point if you can’t even snog him,” Draco says with a sigh falling from his lips, suddenly feeling sad for himself. Astoria was his best friend and he couldn’t even tell her that he fancied Harry Potter. She wouldn’t understand.
“After I came out, everyone was different, girls wanted to be my best friend, or wanted to turn me,” he says with a light laugh, “and guys suddenly thought I wanted to fuck them all.” He says, “the common room is really weird now, I try to avoid it as much as I can now, some seventh-years decided that anything I touched was suddenly contaminated and that they might ‘catch the gay’,” he says rolling his eyes, “You have to be ready for that stuff, and if you’re not then,” Draco looks over at Harry, “you fight yourself along the way, until eventually it breaks down and you can’t fight it anymore.”
Leaning his head back against the shower wall, Harry’s eyes slip shut and Draco’s pale slender body enters his mind, his hand stroking his wanting cock. Draco’s cock in Harry’s mouth and Harry’s hand moves faster, he bites his lower lip.
Draco swallows thickly, pressing his lips together in a fine line, looking back at Harry, “No,” he says fiercely.
“Excuse me?” Draco stares dumbly at his father at the same time, Narcissa grabs onto Draco’s arm, in a grip that certainly should have hurt, but Draco couldn’t care less right now.
“It’s alright Mister Malfoy, you’re safe here,” she says, “Confirm the name of your mother and father please?”
Harry rolls his eyes, “For Merlin’s sake,” he laughs, reaching over, gently tucking a lock of hair behind Draco’s ear.
“Merlin no,” he insists, “I’m not even attracted to him,” he says rolling his eyes, “not that it’s any of your business.”
But here Harry was, wanting Draco to take him after just two minutes, and almost no preparation. It wasn’t like they didn’t have sex often, but not often enough for Draco to feel comfortable doing this without fear of hurting Harry.
Harry stands up straight, looking over at his beautiful lover who was now standing beside him and wore that gorgeous smile. Harry glances back at Kingsley Shacklebolt, and immediately a light pink blush stains his cheeks.
“No Draco,” she says softly after a moment, wiping his tears with her gentle fingers, “I’m only sad you felt you couldn’t say anything sooner.”
“I didn’t know you were coming, Cami,” he says staring back at her, he still thought she was stunningly beautiful.
Draco looks back at Harry, “I don’t know for sure, I still can’t remember what happened after we left the pub, and I still don’t remember the rest of the night,” Draco says, “but I think there was snogging involved.”
“Some vampires live underground, in like covens,” he says, “they’re nearly impossible to find, some never surface again once they’ve gone underground.”
Harry’s not quiet, and Draco is sure that they’re not going to go unnoticed for much longer but fuck if he wasn’t going to have every inch of Harry by the time morning comes.
“Why don’t you come in,” Draco says, walking back into the living room where he had been about to have his breakfast. “Would you like some tea?” he asks.
Harry snaps his head back around staring at Draco, “You’re dating Anthony Goldstein?” he asks curiously.
of the things my boyfriend does or says, doesn’t mean I’m going to stop dating him,” Harry says, “I like you, and I like the way you treat me, and I like spending time with you, and I like the way you make me feel when we’re together, and I don’t expect, nor do I want you to change who you are to fit the person you
Draco nods, “and I hear it’s weird for humans to see a vampire actually drinking from another person.”
“I’m not saying no,” Draco says, “but, I want to be careful the first time with you,” he says, “but right now I probably won’t be able to do that.”
Neil smiles, walking them to an empty spot on one of the sofas, “Cami is great with beginners,” Neil says, “She’s got good veins.”
Draco had only fed from one person, but he felt that way too like he shouldn’t be watching other vampires as they fed.
“I am so proud of you,” Narcissa says and she starts to cry again, “I am so sorry Draco” she whispers.
A low moan escapes Draco’s lips, as Harry takes more of him into his mouth. Harry’s tongue presses against the underside of Draco’s cock, playfully licking at the slit at the tip of his cock, “Oh, fuck,” Draco moans, as his eyes slip shut, “Fuck, Harry.”
“Good morning Mister Potter,” she smiles with a small bow, “may I offer you some hot tea?” she asks.
Harry glares back at Draco with the same daring look, “We don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want to, but we do have to acknowledge it,” he says firmly.
“The younger vampires tend to go through blood a bit quicker, so I’m gonna bring you another bag,” she says, before exiting the room.
“Fuck” Draco breathes, as his hands find their way into Harry’s dark hair, and he stills his hips, as Harry starts to suck taking Draco further into his mouth until he couldn’t anymore.
“Yes,” Harry confirms, “You’re an asshole, who constantly tells me he hates me, and we used to be so violent to each other.”
Tasting Draco’s pre-come on his tongue has Harry desperate to touch himself. He can’t stop himself from reaching down, gently rubbing the swollen head of his cock, causing himself to moan around Draco’s cock in his mouth.
Draco walks back to the living room, and Luna runs up to him, “Thanks for inviting us to your party, we’re having a great time,” Luna smiles.
“If you want out of this relationship, this is your chance before either of us commit emotions to this, emotions that can lead to hurt feelings,” Draco says before, “More hurt feelings.”
Draco lets their hands stay close together as he glances over his shoulder to see Harry, “what’s wrong?” he murmurs, before laying his head back on his pillow.
Draco sighs, but puts the shirt on anyway. Blaise hands him a black vest a moment later, it was soft as silk, and Draco had only worn it one other time, as far as he could remember.
“I know what your name is,” Draco mutters, hating that Harry was starting to figure him out inside and out.
Draco watches Harry for a moment, “Well, I was doing a bit of shopping, and he was trying to give me fashion advice, and I said I didn’t need advice on how to dress myself from someone who dressed like a toadstool, and then he said that my legs in those trousers, reminded him of a bowtruckle, and then he asked me if I wanted to go for a drink.”
“Out here,” Harry calls out, and Draco wanders into the living room, seeing Harry sitting on the sofa, holding a coffee. Harry had drawn all the blinds closed for him.
Harry smiles, “You’re welcome,” he says, leaning over kissing the side of Draco’s head, before leaving him to clean up.
“No,” Harry says firmly, reaching for Draco’s hand, “Just get on the bed,” he says, “and face the other way.”
A moment later, before Draco can become properly bored waiting, Draco can feel the weight shifting on the bed behind him, as Harry crawls up onto the bed.
Draco had decided to come out before he returned to Hogwarts, he told his mother that he was gay, and she cried. Draco immediately wished he could take it back when he saw the tears, he had never wanted to hurt his mother like that he loved her so dearly, and it honestly broke his heart to think that he was disappointing her in any way. Especially after what happened last year, hurting her was the last thing he ever wanted to do. Draco cried.
Draco starts remembering details from his accident and starts to get the hang of this whole vampire thing.
Draco groans, his hips rocking forward, as Harry calls his name, “Yes,” he moans softly, arching his back.
Forcing his eyes back open, Draco looks down at Harry on his knees. Harry’s hand has disappeared into his own trousers, and a visible wet spot has formed on the front of his trousers.
“Well it’s going to be kind of hard to hide the fangs, and the aversion to light,” Draco snaps, “What’s left for people to do or say about us that they haven’t already, huh father? What?” Draco says.
Harry’s brain is buzzing with anticipation, he has to remind himself to breathe as Draco pushes his finger inside his body.
“I’m sorry, I’m just finding it hard to concentrate on this conversation, because I’m so fucking thirsty,” he says.
Blaise opens his mouth to speak, but Draco says, “Trust me,” and Blaise shuts up, “You’re going to have to start acting like you’re having fun.”
Harry stares back at Draco, unsure of why Draco would suddenly be this nice to him, “yeah, alright” he says, “might take you up on that.”
“So… When are you coming back?” Harry asked after catching Draco up with his peace talks with Soup. “Because Blaise told me a few things about you and ropes I would like to have a long in-depth discussion about...” he added suggestively.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's upturned nose and turned into the alley his feet brought him back to, almost without thinking, until they stopped in front of the gurdwara and Harry could breathe more easily.
That was the moment Harry decided to try and keep the shaving to a minimum until he could do it himself. He would miss having Malfoy’s hands on him, but it was for the best of the community at large and the maintaining of whatever shred of professionalism he could cling to at that point.
Harry realised he'd fallen asleep only when he was startled awake by the ground shifting under him. He immediately kicked Malfoy's leg, thinking he'd fallen asleep and let the Stabilisation Charm slip.
“He’s not wrong, you know?” he told him softly. He knew it would fall to deaf ears, but he had to hope one day or the other Draco would be ready to listen.
"I couldn't do what I needed in England, Potter. I had to go somewhere I would be allowed to learn and listen. It's time for you and Granger and Weasley to take the reins of power in England and steer it in the right direction. My place is outside of it now. I've had my chance and I blew it."
Malfoy's eyes flicked between the people gathered around them, the faces peeking out of doors and tent flaps, and he gave a minute shake of his head. "They're too many, and I can't cleanse all this Dark Magic alone. I would need Purifying Potions and then modified Pepper-Up…" He trailed off.
How relatable is Harry, a bisexual man, forgetting bisexuality exists? Heteronormativity is one hell of a drug.
Harry could work with that. It wasn’t a definite no, it was a no for now. He nodded.“Ok,” he agreed easily. It implied there would be a next time; Harry would take that. “Is that the only tattoo you have?”
“That’s incredible, Auror Potter, you must have such a great arrest record, being in the field so much.” He commented with a wide smile, looking at Harry adoringly.
Soup was already back next to him with a small box in his hand, two heavy ornate rings in it. The Black signet ring went on his left hand, covering the silver band on his ring finger, the Malfoy one on the right. And then the pieces were all where they were meant to be. He stood in silence for a moment, looking at himself in the mirror, then he linked the last chain, holding his robes together at his collar and turned away.
Harry had his doubts, but it was undeniable that now they could get all the expert support they would need, and they did sow the seed of education reform.
“I want to be good for you,” Harry whispered, his voice rough as he finally admitted it. He turned his head a little so he could look at Draco under the light of the moon streaming in from the window. He was beautiful as he looked at Harry with all the love a man could hold. The cold light made him seem ethereal and otherworldly, but Harry knew Draco was solid enough that he could ground himself in those clear silver eyes.
“It’s your funeral, Potter,” Draco replied, putting the chart down after writing down the new dosage of painkillers. It wouldn’t be the first time a patient had reservations about taking dreamless sleep or draught of peace, people tended to be cautious around potions that affected their mind. And there was the potential for addiction there too.
“I...” Draco looked at the envelope for a long moment. Too many emotions swirling in his head. Laennec was wonderful, but England was his home. And he could do so much as department head. Did he want to give St Mungo’s one more chance? What could it become under the leadership of Healer Moreschi?
"You don't have to accept it. I will turn this into a gurukul if you don't want it. Taranjit agreed it would be the best way to—"
I feel like I should warn that there's discussion of grief, in particular the loss of a child. It's quick but I feel like fairly intense. I'll put the spoiler in the end notes if anyone needs it.
Harry was still high on the best orgasm he had in recent memory, but the erection tenting Draco’s underwear was impossible to miss, and Harry wasn’t going to leave it be. He needed to get his hands on it, he needed to see Draco come undone under him.
“And still I’m the one treating him, so there’s your answer.” Draco said, getting up to clear up the reports and stick the list to his wall. “Thank you for collaborating, mr Finnigan, you saved us a lot of headaches and paperwork” He mentioned “And I’m sorry about taking up so much of your time.” He added as Finnigan got up to leave. He’d learned some honest show of gratitude went a long way towards cultivating useful connections on the job.
“Of course not. Tell me, why do you need an old man’s help?” He asked, getting comfortable in his armchair, his hands resting on the head of a walking cane.
Draco walked through the busy halls of the hospital with purpose, flanked by Blaise and Pansy. The way people parted to let them through could only mean that Pansy’s work was having its intended effect. Blaise made for a fetching sight next to him, a sharp suit under formal robes that exuded power in the best way possible, power, competence, and all the self-assurance a man could have.
"I'm trying to actually make things better here, Potter, I'm sure you haven't forgotten I have a debt with the world that I can't hope to pay in a lifetime."
Harry insisted they wait until the curse-breaker arrived before leaving, and that meant a lot of idle time for him and a lot of work for Malfoy and Healer Gupta, making their way through the population performing cleansing rituals on everyone still sporting the creeping tendrils of curse damage on their skin, disrupting their tattoos, or anyone whose casting was inconsistent and erratic.
She felt the wash of cooling charms hit her as soon as she stepped inside. Simple metal tables were lined up in the magically expanded space of the tent and a kitchen was set up on the opposite side.
“Oh yes?” Draco asked, slowly walking him backwards towards the bedroom. “How could I possibly sway you?”
“I meant adverse reactions to stasis or painkillers,” he clarified. He was impressed with himself for keeping his voice steady.
As they enjoyed something sweet to close the meal Draco was convinced to tell the tale of his own start as an emergency Healer.
“From what I saw, it wasn’t easy at all,” Harry pointed out. He wasn’t going to forget the image of Draco falling apart, wracked with guilt, over Blaise’s couch.
“Astoria designed it for me when I decided to apply to train as a healer. She was that sure I would make it.” A moment of wistfulness took over Malfoy for the space of a breath, but it was gone as quick as it came, returning to the familiar composed mask that he wore all the time. It left Harry wondering if it was ever there at all
Before he knew it, they were back at the hotel, in the enclosed space of the lift, rocketing up to their floor, still quietly existing next to each other, for once not pitted against each other.
“Good morning, Mr Potter, are you ready for round two?” she asked, lining up the vials on the nightstand once Malfoy pushed the pensieve aside.
“Merlin, he gets better every day, I think not even I learned at that rate.” The pride in Draco’s voice wasn’t lost to Blaise, nor was the mild annoyance at Potter’s ridiculous abilities. “But he’s barely got two months of training, Blaise, and Weasley is this close to closing a case spanning decades, bringing down an organization that’s been poisoning who knows how many people.” Draco threw his arms up, his voice pitched high. He knew it was the right course of action, Draco was a strategist, a planner, and he knew how to tell priorities… except when it came to Potter. His restlessness gave him away easily.
“One last thing to decide. Since Healer Malfoy’s relieved of his duty I believe Auror Potter should go back to Healer Murphy.” Andrews started. That would not do. Draco stepped up immediately. That oaf would find a way to kill Potter before Draco had even left the hospital, or, more accurately, he would let Potter kill himself with unchecked reckless idiocy.
“What in Morgana’s name is a Petri dish?” He asked, running a hand through his hair and taking a slow breath to tamp down the annoyance. Potter pointed to the tray where he’d set up to test his blood for three different reactants.
Harry grumbled something under his breath about it not having been so bad. “Zabini… Are Malfoy and him a thing?” he asked.
“It’s hard to describe but it’s not just dreams. It’s like I am another person, I feel what they feel, on some level know what they know… but not really, it’s just…” Harry struggled to put the feeling into words, it wasn’t something easily explained but he knew the sensation intimately.
"You want to make a stable water mirror for each enclave?" Malfoy was looking at him like he was crazy, but Harry knew it could be done. If they could travel through paintings, a water mirror was a viable mode of communication and travel. And as he stared Malfoy down, he saw his need to prove he could do the impossible kick in, the more he thought about it.
Harry noticed Malfoy's eyes dropping to his forearm and Harry knew he understood how comforting anonymity and lack of judgement could be; in a diametrically opposed way they reached the same understanding. But there was more.
Before Harry could probe deeper and ask about the sustainability of such an arrangement, Hermione and Malfoy stepped out of the elevator with the other three members of the British delegation. Hermione had changed into a light anarkali suit in shades of cream and gold that complimented her dark skin wonderfully. She'd tied her hair back in a bun and looked like she was ready to tackle anything. His fellow Auror, Sabrina Foster, and Professor Chambers were in semi-formal sets of robes that couldn't have been comfortable if not for the Weather-Control Charm running in every room of the hotel. Griffith seemed to be trying his best to look as unassuming as possible.
Draco ended up researching deep into the night, under Soup’s disapproving gaze. It was astounding how he could look down on him from a height of under 3 feet. He could swear the little bugger switched him to decaf around eleven and hummed disapprovingly every time Draco asked for another cup. He needed to find the best way to test for the wide range of possible traumas Potter might have suffered and went unchecked until they surfaced now, messing with his recovery in unforeseen ways.
"I know," Draco sighed, watching Scorpius hold Hugo up as he took a spin on the broom. Once they explained things to Scorpius it would become real, his own son would be burdened with it, would look at him differently. "Just... not yet."
How was one meant to focus on work when there was a beautiful man, who apparently loved him, begging to be tied up, already in his house, waiting for him? Draco had the best and worst friends in the world.
Healer Gupta nodded. "From 1858 when the crown took control after the East India Company, they made the communities"—she glanced at Yuvarani, trying to find the right word—"invisible?"
"I'm guessing their name isn't Harry Potter and they aren't the literal most recognisable face in the entire UK," Parvati shot back with a knowing smile.
Pansy took the robes off their hanger and held them out to Draco with a small smile. He draped them on his shoulders with an expert move, letting them flutter and settle for a moment, their weight grounding and comforting as they wrapped around him, only one thing left to seal him in his armour.
They all stumbled back to the boat that night, aware that there was still a lot of work to be done and they had too few hands to do it… especially if someone blasted their own off into next week. He had a plan for the evening, though, and it involved showering first. But they had a little time off since Hermione and Professor Chambers were going to dinner with the Bengali Minister of Education to plan for the arrival of Thai gurus to restore the gurukul, and Harry managed to convince her he'd done enough standing around and looking pretty in the name of international relations.
Harry's spell ricocheted off the wall, missing its target entirely, so he did the one thing he could think of, tackling Malfoy out of the way, far from the dark pool and blocking the strike with his own body.
The day of the opening turned into a formal occasion. Granger informed them that some Bengali high officials were going to be present, as well as the British Minister of Foreign affairs, while the elder would hold the inaugural speech. That put Draco in a very awkward position, because he had packed zero formal clothing options and he sure wasn't going to attend a party with foreign dignitaries in work clothes.
"What now?" Harry asked, glancing at Malfoy, holding up the cave above them with no more effort than carrying a parasol.
“Yes, you can make a number of idiotic choices, doesn’t mean making every single one of those has to be your ultimate life goal,” he replied, standing up and picking up the notebook. “I’ll see you in the morning,” he told Harry. “Weasley, thank you for the game,” he added with a small nod.
“He attended Mrs Weasley’s birthday,” Draco replied, his voice dripping with disbelief. “He couldn’t be dissuaded, he had to go to dinner at the Burrow, and he insisted on stopping by Godric’s Hollow on the way back to visit his parents because it was the eve of the anniversary!”
“No, no, no, Weasley, you don’t get it. There was a person there that cursed Potter.” Malfoy’s grin, made him look just a little bit mental.
“I’m surprised you’re still alive” Seamus commented, leaning back and watching Harry with an amused glint in his eyes.
Potter didn't even ask him to come along with him to the Golden Temple, as if he knew that Draco would follow him wherever he led, as if he knew how addictive it was to stand under his eyes and have his complete attention. He rinsed his feet in the water basin outside the temple door and covered his head, following in Potter's every step along the decorated corridor. He watched the awe flood his face as he took in the intricate decoration of the ceilings and the strong columns holding the structure up. He felt warmth spread in his chest at the way Potter’s eyes widened and his breath caught at every turn, and with all the art surrounding them, there was nothing Draco wanted to look at more than Potter’s face filled with childlike wonder. He let Potter set the pace, lingering and walking slowly across the wide rooms, he waited quietly when he stopped to pray in the comfortable cool air in the middle of the temple, surrounded by strangers that shared with him more than Draco could hope.
He didn't bother changing before going to the manor, his mother would enjoy seeing him dressed up and they could discuss Pansy's work instead of his own.
"The children are less at risk from themselves, as their magic is small and still developing. Some of the elders received training before the last guru died, but the adults are unstable and unable to ground themselves."
"I was forced to testify under Veritaserum, Hermione, and they twisted my every word," he argued, throwing his arms up at how uncompromisingly stubborn she was being about the issue.
“Potter, I know we have all day but I suspect we have a lot of ground to cover.” Malfoy’s voice pulled him from his reverie and he jumped into action. As soon as the tip of his wand touched his temple, he realized he didn’t know what he wanted to protect. There was too much he wanted out of his mind, and every single instance seemed inconsequential.
By the time a woman in an hotel uniform came to let them know their time was up and they could go shower and head in for a massage if they liked, Hermione had reached the conclusion that they could bring in Thai experts to try and preserve the communities from being further contaminated by western prescriptions on magical practices, and maybe reconstruct the lost traditions leaning on the cultural proximity, so Harry guessed they were done with self-care for the night.
He walked in the break room and grabbed two trainees “Bingley, Brown, by being the first in this morning you won the privilege of working with me today. It’s going to be an incredible teaching opportunity. Now chop chop, we have no time to lose.” He told them before walking back out, trusting they would follow swiftly.
“I already started reading my divination book.” He told Harry after Andromeda served tea. She chuckled at the mention of it shaking her head, and Harry knew there was a story there.
He did not expect his suite to have a little door next to the closet, or Malfoy's head to come poking out of that door not even an hour after he settled in.
“No one has ever complained before, especially those in my bed in the morning.” He told him, the smooth mean edge of his voice finally familiar again. The world was right on its axis now.
“Good morning mr Potter, how are we feeling this fine morning?” she greeted him, checking his IV and then his chart. “New meds, uh? You having fun reactions to the old ones?” she asked with a smile, setting it back down.
"It only has one charge and it's extremely unpleasant for me to wake the phoenix. I only ever used it once before today and it was on myself. I'll have to find someone to re-enchant it if I want to use it again, so try not to get cursed and or poisoned in the foreseeable future."
"I can’t know for certain,” Draco sighed. “Murphy got killed while I was finishing the drain. Ron said one of his curses backfired on him while he tried to destroy evidence. In the end, the bond got broken on his side while Harry leeched off his magic."
He twisted quickly to tip Harry over on his back, more towards the middle of the bed. Harry let out a surprised
Malfoy sighed and the fire died down behind his eyes. "I know you can barely stand to look at me, Potter. There isn't much I can do about it, but I'm here to work and I'd appreciate it if you didn't actively make it harder on me. Right now, these women are serving your country better than you can and I have another long day tomorrow, so could you kindly fuck off?"
Diana Damrau is an actual person and she indeed played the Queen of the night at the Royal Opera House of London wearing truly stunning costumes
For some reason she managed to cut him down during her read even though the topic of the day was the fashion season’s new colour and the most anticipated events of the social season. “You know what should be right here?” She asked, pointing at the first space on the list. “Fundraisers for research, mr Potter.” She shook her head with a tsk “Sure the opening gala for the London fashion week is amazing and coming in September, but you know what’s the one thing better than high design garments? Functioning hospitals!”
“Eh, we’re all kinky fuckers. We were happy to hear our perfect vanilla Saviour is bent just like the rest of us,” he grinned. “Draco more than anyone, but still, it was nice to hear.”
“Of course, thank you for letting me know.” He replied before addressing the trainees “You two are dismissed, go ahead, Andrews doesn’t tolerate tardiness.” He told them, nodding to the door.
"I want it." Harry interrupted him, his heart beating fast against his ribs, trying to jump out and fill every room of the house, breathe in every scent and taste the magic in the air.
"Can I ask you what happened between you and Harry?" she asked in a tone that was less Ambassador and more Granger.
He bent down and pulled Harry up and away from the water. They barely got steady on their feet when the ground shook again and a crack started opening in the ceiling. Malfoy immediately let go of him and started casting, talking too fast for Harry to keep up with. A net quickly formed out of the tip of his wand, and adhered to the unsteady sides of the cave, holding up the ceiling.
"It could work, pricey, but if you get a few artisans together you would have a reliable mode of communication, you wouldn't need more than one for each community to start."
Embarrassingly, Harry fell asleep halfway through a game of chess with Ron, while he was telling him about the hazing of the recruits before they became Aurors proper, another fun thing he was missing out on.
"Children. Die." He hadn't raised his voice above a spa-appropriate quiet tone but those two words were deafening, cutting through the buzz of anger in Harry's ears. "Because your precious England couldn't be bothered to send me adequate support."
Hermione's frustration was far too easy to read in any language, the clenched fists, tapping feet and tugging of curls didn’t need translation. It was worse than she'd originally thought. Harry glanced at the kids gathered a bit away, trying to look inconspicuous as they eavesdropped. They couldn't have been much older than fifteen. In a better world, they would be about to master control of their power, they would have had years to explore the possibilities of magic. Instead, they were cut off from their history by a cruel trick of someone pulling the strings of something infinitely bigger than them and at the same time inconsequential, like the spasmodic desire for more of a man halfway across the world, a hunger that could never be satiated.
Malfoy looked constantly overworked but Harry couldn’t bring himself to point it out, not when he was so close to having his entire limb back. He’d worry about the bags under Malfoy’s eyes once he had five new functioning fingers.
Potter walked with purpose, a clear direction in mind, and made them weave among passersby for almost half an hour until Potter found what he was looking for: an arc sketched in coal on a building that used to be white. As soon as he touched the tip of his wand to it, the grime disappeared from the wall and the lines of it became crisper, opening a passage to what looked like a wide garden. Potter walked through first, and Draco followed, letting the passage close behind him.
"Duly noted." She smiled at him, fully aware that she wasn't going to get much more goodwill from him.
By the time Draco finally drizzled a bit of lube on his fingers they had been warmed up enough by harry’s skin to warm the gel up in turn before he gently traced the furled rim, making it glisten. Harry was
Soup was merciful enough to allow him two fully caffeinated cups of coffee before sending him on his way.
“I actually got a taste of it. Working undercover for Murphy was exhilarating. He might have been slightly deranged but he was a great potionist, he ran a tight ship, his technique...” Draco shrugged drifting off for a moment. “I felt alive brewing side by side with him, like I haven’t in a while, and I want to do it again, run a lab, a legitimate one preferably.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco’s at that. “And I don’t want to go backwards. Here I can excel as much as I want but I will always be a second-generation marked Death Eater. I deluded myself thinking I could escape that brand but what I did during the war casts too long a shadow, and sometimes it’s easy to lean into what people expect me to be.”
He let Draco push the briefs down all the way and reveal himself, completely naked and just as comfortable with it as the first time he stripped in front of Harry. Under the warm sunlight, he was no less perfect than the sculptures decorating the foyer. He was a piece of art, splayed on Harry’s bed, offered up as a buffet for Harry to feast on. He wrapped a hand loosely around Draco’s cock and gave a slow tug, swiping his thumb over the head, spreading the pre-come around.
Hermione nodded and kept her eyes trained forward, trying to come up with the right words. She only had one chance to get him on board and she had no backup listed for this mission. The crunch of gravel under the tires got louder as they left the archaeological site behind, proceeding into a gorge. The smooth stone cliffs on either side of the narrow road gave her respite from the relentless heat of the sun.
Harry couldn't help the suspicion that arose from such an evasive answer, and it must have shown on his face because Malfoy's jaw hardened when he met his eyes.
“Unfortunately, Healer Murphy omitted to properly record the subsequent hospital visits, a mistake neither of you will be repeating if you hope to have a long and prosperous career here.” He fixed both the trainees with a hard look “That leaves us with this fun little exercise. You have the list, and the tools, take it from the top and keep accurate records of the results.” He instructed, stepping back and letting the two of them get to work. He didn’t interfere much, content to hang back and watch them work, offering directions only when asked, mostly to the girl, Brown. Bingley seemed happy to do his own thing, enduring Malfoy’s directions whenever he hesitated over an unfamiliar procedure.
“This is my home, I don’t care if it doesn’t want me anymore,” he murmured, the words sticking together as they tumbled from his mouth, the pain numbed by Ogden’s excellent brew. “It’s where my mother is, and she can’t leave however much she may want to.” He closed his eyes and taking a slow breath. “It’s where Edward and Andromeda are, it’s where you and Pansy are.” He opened his eyes, looking at the silver ring, sitting unassuming on his finger. “It’s where I buried Astoria and all she brought to my life,” he whispered.
Weasley narrowed his eyes at him, at the ease with which he came up with the plan and pushed him to lie again. He could tell he wanted to argue more but Potter’s voice cut through.
“What’s the emergency?” She asked, looking around the room to try and determine what got Malfoy to call her in such a hurry. Draco walked up to her and turned her away from Potter’s bed with a gentle touch on her elbow, they were far enough and spoke quietly so that he couldn’t quite listen in on the exchange.
“Of course. You’ll find the details and documentation in the envelope. Let me know soon, though,” she recommended.
Draco smiled and shook his head, reaching out to touch Harry's arm. "I'm not going back to England, Harry. It's in safe hands, Blaise and Granger have it all figured out. And our work is not done here. If you'll have me, I want to stay, help you track down every last magical person in India and make sure they have the support they need and deserve."
He was going to have breakfast and then take a walk, stretch his legs, maybe sit a while in the tiny lounge, find someone to play chess with that might actually let him win… Probably Paediatrics would be his safest bet for that. He chuckled at the thought, imagining what Malfoy would say about that.
“Those are Mac Gabhann’s capsules, they insulate from ambient magic, we use them to favour some delicate magical interactions.” He explained.
Harry’s eyes followed the slow motion of Malfoy’s long fingers until he started neatly rolling up the sleeve. His mouth went dry as more and more pale translucent skin was revealed. Attached to that elegant wrist was a perfectly formed arm, he could have been carved from marble; the only things betraying his mortal nature were the faint blue lines of his veins and the occasional quickening of muscle under the skin. And his skin, it was perfect. The only thing disturbing the long lines of his arm were the dark leather straps of his wand holster, securely fastened to the inside of his forearm, the wrong one, Harry remembered. Harry forgot to breathe for a moment, drinking in every inch of revealed skin, from the slender wrist to the toned forearm sparsely dusted with pale hair. He very nearly whined when Malfoy stopped as he reached the elbow. As he snapped back to himself, Harry realized where this was going.
Draco cursed his existence when the alarm went off in the morning. At some point during the night Soup had gotten the robes off him and cleaned them so at least he hadn’t slept fully dressed.
“I’m doing very well, Soup is never without work taking care of Master Malfoy,” he replied, his thinly veiled irreverence making Blaise chuckle as he walked in.
After about a minute and a half Draco begins to sense her pulse slowing under his tongue. Draco senses the blood flow slowing as he swallows, somehow, he knew it was okay for him to keep drinking, so he does.
“Yeah that’s not gonna happen,” he says, knowing full well if anyone could understand him right now, it would be Harry, but Draco definitely wasn’t going there.
“It’s nice right?” Harry says, letting his head rest against Draco’s shoulder, pressing a gentle kiss to the nape of his neck.
Draco looks at Harry with a small smile, before leaning down pressing his lips against Harry’s, kissing him gently. Harry kisses Draco back before he smiles breaking the kiss a moment later.
“I just woke up, I haven’t had anything yet today,” he mutters, “and I’m rather thirsty.” Thirsty was an understatement, Draco had wanted blood the moment he woke up, but he wanted a shower more, so he waited, and by the time he allowed himself to indulge his fangs had already been waiting, anticipating, the delicious and somehow nutritious liquid that would get him through the day.
“Yes,” Draco says, “I only use feeders, so I can hone the skill really,” he says, “It’s only partly instinctual, there’s still a skill to it, and I still don’t always get it right.”
Draco hates the way he’s actually scared of his body right now. He watches Harry exit the room, and he can’t help but drag his fingers across the long fang, he gasps, feeling the fang pierce the tip of his finger.
“At least I got to do it on my own terms,” Draco says, before meeting Harry’s eyes, “I’m sorry about that Potter, really.”
“You would think that it would be easier because they would hold into place,” Harry says thinking aloud.
“I know,” Draco says, walking into his closet, “but I don’t like when things don’t go my way,” he says.
Harry nods, “We did, and he told us that you were talking to Astoria and that the two of you went to talk alone, and he said that Astoria came back maybe twenty minutes later, saying that she was going to leave,” Harry explains.
“You don’t need to say anything,” Draco says, “That is unless you don’t want this,” he says pulling his green tie lose, working the buttons on his shirt open.
“If he makes you happy mate then who am I to say anything else about it” Ron says, “thought we would go to the club and pick up girls together, but I guess you’ll be picking up blokes instead,” he teases with a giant grin on his face, and Harry can’t help but smile back at Ron and laugh at him.
Draco hadn’t expected any of those words to leave Harry’s mouth, he would have never expected Harry Potter to be into BDSM play.
Draco isn’t sure how long he’s slept for, but when he wakes up, he’s hyper-aware of another person in the room. He sits up quickly, his eyes adjusting to the darkness of the room, as he looks around the room. If he didn’t know himself, he would have thought that involuntary noise he made was some sort of a growl.
“Harry?” a gentle smile on those red lips, and Harry was so far gone, he doesn’t even remember if his name was Harry.
Draco senses he knows what Harry wants to say, “I didn’t realize you had such a praise kink,” Draco says, but it’s not in a malicious way, more curiosity than anything, but Draco couldn’t say that it didn’t interest him at all.
Harry can’t argue with that, it’s all he’s been thinking about for weeks now. Since Draco’s extremely drunken night at the club. It had taken everything in Harry not to look at Draco’s completely naked body that night, he decided to drunkenly strip down and climb into his bed. Merlin did Harry want that man, and here he was, so willing, so ready, and so hard.
Draco laughs, he had sort of been getting around this year, but he’s just making up for lost time, he should have been fooling around with boys in his earlier years, but that just wasn’t a possibility at the time.
“Not like on purpose,” Harry says, “and it was really weird at first, almost like something you should look away from.”
Draco stares down at the blood bag trying to figure out how it opens, he pulls on the tab on the bottom of the bag, and it made a tiny popping noise. Draco could feel the fangs sprout, and the clicking noise loud in his ears, as the scent of the fresh blood filled his nostrils. Bringing the bag to his lips Draco began to suck, a large amount of blood filling his mouth all at once sent his senses into overdrive. Draco swallows quickly pulling the bag away from his mouth, and blood began to spill from his mouth. Draco quickly swallows the blood, wiping his mouth now covered in blood with the back of his hand.
Was Draco really going to fuck this random bloke in a nightclub? Well, he hadn’t made any decisions on that just yet. When Toby’s lips start kissing at the sides of his mouth, and down his jaw, and his neck, Draco completely lost any previous thought he had.
Draco looks at his mother for a moment, before turning to look back at his father, “Don’t worry father, I will go, and I’ll never come back.”
Harry can’t help it, as he moans softly, working his hand and fingers over Draco’s cock, he wanted it. He always felt like he was being spoiled when Draco allowed Harry to satisfy him sexually. The soft moans Draco would make, the way his body would react to every flick of Harry’s wrist, every swipe of his tongue, every delicate kiss Harry would strategically place simultaneously with every move of his own body.
Draco pulls his dressing gown tighter around himself looking back at Harry, he wants to say something, he wants to say he’s sorry, and he wants Harry to hug him. Draco wants to say he’s feeling vulnerable, but that is clearly written all over his face, and he hates that he knows that.
I want to say thank you for sticking around with this story, those of you who've read this far, It means so much to me! And without further ado I present you with the conclusion of Vampie!Draco :)
Draco had started calling Harry by his first name more often, and Harry knew that when Draco was annoyed at him, not even when he was angry with him, even when Draco was angry, he would call him Harry, but when he was annoyed, even just the tiniest bit Draco
Draco closes the door to his room, pouring the rest of the half-full blood bag into his glass. Draco stands eyeing the glass full of blood, and he starts to wonder about what Harry said, about knowing his limits. Draco picks up the glass, taking a long sip, fully aware of the blood that flows out of the side of his mouth. Draco sets his glass down, wiping at the sides of his mouth, it’s at that very moment he starts to feel sad. Sad for himself. His father was right, he was a vampire now, he was half a wizard now, he was a disgrace to his family name. His parents were right to send him away, he wanted to be away from them, he wanted to be away from everyone. Draco looks down at the blood in the glass, picking it up before finishing the last of its contents.
“I’m fine,” Draco grumbles, pushing Harry back when he tries to help him, “I don’t need help,” he slurs.
Harry exhales deeply, looking at Draco, “So what you’re saying is that this is a serious relationship, and you want to continue this relationship.”
Draco’s need for control at that moment seems to fail him, he thinks it might be okay for just a moment, and so long as no one else sees him drop his control that it might be okay with Harry, but not all the time, and definitely not when anyone else could see it. But Draco thinks he could release his control for Harry.
Harry nods, “It’s alright, something might come to you as you recover, I’ll come back in a few days, and see if you remember anything, yeah?” he says getting up, “If you remember anything before then, just send me an owl.”
“I’m going to go now, and I suggest neither of you follows me home,” Draco says, walking away from the both of them. Draco walks into the next room, making his way to the Floo, and going straight home.
A darkened figure emerges from what he assumed was the doorway, “It’s alright, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Until this moment Draco hadn’t even thought about how he might navigate a romantic relationship with his new condition. He was still figuring out the whole vampire thing, sure he enjoyed dating, but he wasn’t looking for anything serious or long term, but how would that work? Would Draco only ever be compatible with another vampire? How many gay vampires were there out there? Could he sustain a romantic relationship with a human? Draco feels stupid that, that thought never crossed his mind before Anthony pointed it out to him.
to stop simply because it was his favorite blood type and tasted amazing, Harry’s response was to offer himself to Draco at that very moment, and Draco thought Harry was absolutely insane.
Draco spends the next week avoiding Harry in every capacity. Disapparating whenever Harry would arrive via Floo, and purposefully staying away from his house, staying with Blaise for two days, but Harry was determined to see Draco Malfoy.
Draco wakes up the next morning, he’s hungover and wants to vomit. He sits up on his bed, and that’s when he realizes he’s not in his bed. These definitely aren’t his 600 threat count Egyptian cotton bedsheets, and he’s not wearing a single piece of clothing. What the fuck had he done last night, and where the hell was he?
Draco closes his eyes, as he feels his top fangs pierce her skin, Camilla gasps softly as she feels Draco’s fangs find her vein on the first attempt.
Draco rolls his eyes, of course, Harry would be concerned with why he was out of bed, “if you must know, I had a date actually.”
This was true, but Draco didn’t mind as much as he thought he would. As Draco was about to speak, Zella returned with a plate of cakes for Draco. Draco grabbed a slice of cake before Zella could even set the plate down.
Harry had never thought about that before, but he already had an answer, “It’s somewhere in between,” he says, “not like all the time, but I do like subtle hints outside of a sexual context,” he admits.
Harry looks up at Draco, with gentle eyes, and swollen lips and Draco has to refrain from kissing him. Harry looks as if he’s expecting Draco to say something, but Draco couldn’t imagine what else he would say to Harry at this moment.
Luna nods, “Ginny loves to dance,” she smiles, looking over at Ginny who was dancing by herself and attracting a lot of attention.
“Just kiss me, Potter,” Draco says, pressing their lips together once more, and god did it feel amazing. Harry’s lips, Harry’s tongue, Draco is sure he’s lost his damn mind when he pulls his wand from his cloak pocket, and pushes Harry back through the bathroom door, locking the door with magic before putting a silencing charm over the room.
Harry moans as he squeezes his eyes shut, as Draco’s finger enters him. God, it’s so good, the stretch is almost painful, but Draco’s finger moves in a fluid motion, keeping the uncomfortable stretch from burning. Draco slides in another finger, with another lubrication charm, and Harry’s back is arching off the bench, his hips meeting Draco’s hand, and he’s moaning loudly without having any time to register what’s actually happening to him. White hot pleasure flows through Harry’s core as Draco’s fingers find his prostate, and Harry actually screams.
Draco nods, he knew Ansel for reasons he’d rather not say aloud, “I’ve done business with him before,” he says, “A few times,” he says more honestly.
“Um, Friday,” Draco answers, that was the last he remembered, he remembered it being Friday, and he had plans to meet friends for dinner.
Ten minutes later Draco looks down at his shirt, he had managed to spill a bit of blood on his shirt. He gets up, pulling off his shirt, “Wash this for me, Zella,” he says, talking to the elf who had busied herself in the kitchen.
Harry nods, “I know it’s not a giant diamond like you’re probably used to, but I seriously want you to marry me.”
Draco walks over to the bed, crawling up into bed beside Harry, moving to straddle Harry’s chest. Harry grins, and his mouth falls open, as Draco presses the head of his cock against Harry’s lips. Harry leans up, taking Draco’s cock into his mouth. Draco pushes his hips forward slightly, gently running his hands through his hair, pushing his hair out of his face, so he can get a better look at Harry.
Draco reaches up, grabbing a fist full of Harry’s hair, pulling him down, kissing him hard on the mouth, it’s messy, and their teeth, accidentally hit against each other’s, Harry’s tongue licks lightly at the roof of Draco’s mouth, and Draco is moaning beneath Harry.
Draco pulls Harry closer to him, lifting his hips as he lines himself up underneath Harry, “Are you alright?” he asks quietly.
Draco wakes up, and his first immediate thought is that his abdominal muscles are sore. He lets out an exasperated groan as he moves to sit up on his bed. It’s then that he realizes that he’s not in his bed. Draco looks around, he wasn’t at home. If he didn’t know any better he might say he was in hospital but he would have no reason for being in hospital. The next thing Draco wonders is what that horribly pleasant metallic taste in his mouth is.
Harry smiles, “It’s not so bad, besides I’m sure there are plenty of penthouses in London for you to choose from.”
“Now that you’re awake we can assess the severity of your condition,” she says, “do not touch that while I am gone,” Tilly says glaring down at him, “I’ll be back in a moment.”
Harry feels his throat dry up, he doesn’t know how to say what he wants to say, but looking back at Draco, he finds his voice to say, “I want to be your boyfriend.”
Draco thinks back to the last thing he remembered, “I was talking to Blaise, he came to my house, said that I had to come out with them we were going to a pub, and then meeting some others.”
Harry looks at Draco, “I’m not lying,” he says, watching Draco trying to figure out how Draco knew he was lying.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, as he feels the heat pooling in his abdomen, and his stomach muscles contract, signaling his orgasm was close.
It’s only after Draco’s finished his third bowl, and he’s completely satisfied, that he realized his fangs have yet to recede. Draco reaches up, gently touching at his fangs, careful of the points. He wasn’t thirsty anymore, so why did he still have fangs.
“I-I want y-you” Draco stutters, looking down at Harry. Harry doesn’t want to, but he lets Draco pull his cock from his mouth, he undresses quickly with promises of being filled with Draco’s cock in another moment.
“Don’t put that on,” Blaise says, pulling down a pair of dark slacks, putting them back a moment later, “I’m dressing you, so we can go.”
Draco is skeptical, he’s almost inclined to believe Ron, he was Harry’s best friend after all, and Ron clearly had some issues with Harry since they began dating. It didn’t help that Draco knew Ron didn’t like him, like at all.
Neil smiles, helping Camilla up off Draco’s lap, letting her sit back on the sofa, “It’s good right?” he asks looking at Draco.
Camilla relaxes, as Draco moves in again. Draco bites her again, with less hesitation this time, making sure to keep his tongue pressed against her vein until he was ready, slowly letting the blood flow from her neck into his mouth, after a few seconds Draco lets her blood flow more freely and he swallows quickly.
“You’re welcome,” Draco replies, taking a drink from his mug as Harry pours some milk into his coffee.
“Fuck” Harry moans, arching his back.  Draco’s movements are not slow, as he thrusts into Harry, and Harry wants to fucking beg him to make him come. Draco has complete control over his body and the way it moves, and he knows exactly what Harry needs, and he gives Harry exactly what he needs.
Draco’s hand settles on Camilla’s waist, and she leans into him as he drinks from her. Draco lets his tongue ease up on the vein in her neck, letting her blood fill his mouth before swallowing slowly. Draco can feel her pulse against his tongue, and he can feel it slow ever so slightly, as he swallows.
“Yes father, because I fucking wanted this!” Draco says angrily, “I fucking went out looking for a vampire to attack me and turn me into one of them.”
Harry smiles, looking back at Draco, who was looking very pale again, “Are you alright?” he asks, “you look like you’re going to be sick again."
Harry moans, arching into Draco’s touch, as he grinds his hips down against Draco’s, feeling Draco’s cock pressing against his prostate, and Harry wants more.
Draco opens the refrigerator, “a bit of both I suppose,” he says, taking out a blood bag, turning back to Harry, “Do you want something?”
It was only after her son had spilled his own tears that Narcissa hugged her son, so tight Draco thought she might break his ribs.
Ginny stares back at Harry, she could see that this was something that bothered him, the fact that she had so much negativity toward Draco Malfoy, but Ginny just couldn’t help it, Draco was always so mean to her, and her family, and Harry for that matter, she was more willing to at least listen now, but she was still not on board for any of this.
Harry is quiet as he lets that sink in, he doesn’t know what to say or do, he looks at Draco, “it’s not,” he stops.
Draco’s hand is ice cold, and burning hot at the same time, in the place where Harry’s hand left his, “I don’t believe anything they post in there” Draco says simply, straightening himself up, “besides, just because two blokes are snogging doesn’t mean they’re gay.”
“You’ve had an accident,” the matron says, walking into the room, taking a closer look at Draco’s chart.
Harry sighs heavily, crossing his arms over his chest, “You’re going to have to start making nice because Draco isn’t going anywhere Ginny, not if I can help it.”
“I’ve never drunk from someone without their permission, and I’m perfectly content with blood from a blood bag. I’ve never desired to drink from a person, so I doubt it’s something you’ll need to worry about,” Draco says crossing his arms over his chest.
Draco turns over, looking back at Harry. Harry looks back at Draco, and he thinks Draco looks so stunningly beautiful right now. He’s looking at Draco’s beautiful silver eyes, and the tiny red ring around his pupil, a sign of his vampirism, seem to be more prominent today. This could also just be that Harry’s gotten used to seeing Draco, so he barely notices anymore.
Neil’s party was a costume party, and Draco had no idea what wear. What Draco had not expected was to see Harry Potter at this party. Harry has this ridiculous smirk on his face when he saunters across the room over to Draco.
Draco looks back at Harry, there were only a few things he didn’t like, the rest was sort of fair game, “I’ll most likely tell you,” Draco says.
Draco settles back into his bed looking up at the ceiling, “I’m telling you, I don’t remember anything.”
Harry hadn’t quite gotten on a schedule that worked for the both of them, he was back and forth between nights and days, and Draco had given up on trying to keep track. He just went with whatever was happening that day.
The doorbell rings and Draco gently places his crystal vial on the stand, “Zella, can you get that for me,” Draco calls out.
Luna smiles, “I’m a Niffler,” she smiles, turning around showing her Niffler tail, “I made it myself,” she grins.
“Fuck Harry” Draco moans, as his cock twitches inside him, hot come coating his insides, and Harry shudders beneath Draco.
Another minute later Draco pulls back retracting his fangs before licking the excess blood from the corner of his mouth.
Harry looks back at Draco, for some reason feeling like he could tell him something he had been dreading admitting, “Ginny moved out.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says, “it’s possible, it’s also possible that they have nothing to do with your attack, but we should try to find out who you were with, we think that you were attacked around two, so this would have been maybe two hours before, this gives us a place to start.”
“You can’t make your own bed?” Harry asks, watching Draco walk into the bedroom, picking up a catalog from the table, and sit down in a chair.
“I wasn’t,” Harry says, “but you’re tying my hands here Malfoy, I won’t know what he knows until I talk to him.”
“I’m not,” Draco says narrowing his eyes at Harry, “Don’t you ever try and pull some shit like that with me.”
Draco can’t help himself, he pulls Harry close against his body, kissing him hard on the mouth, holding Harry by his waist.
Draco couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be in the middle of the night, than skinny dipping with Harry, and from what he can tell, Harry’s enjoying their time together too. They stay like this for a while, swimming together and splashing each other in the water and for the first time in a long time, possibly ever, Draco is having fun.
Harry rolls his eyes, of course, how could he think that Draco fucking Malfoy wouldn’t tell him exactly how he wanted it. He leans down a second later, taking Draco’s cock back into his mouth, causing Draco to shudder beneath him.
