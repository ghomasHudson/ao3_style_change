"Yeah, but how about you?"
It was odd. Harry knew that she was speaking French. Her words were most definitely not English when she uttered them but he perfectly understood each and every word. Maybe a translation spell was active.
"Well, call me Harry then."
"Of course not. I don't even know if he's alive. If he's dead, we'll find his body. If he's alive, it's unlikely that he will show up anytime soon. Now then," Parkinson said, patting off the non-existent dust from her shoulder. "I trust that you know where to find me."
"I'm here on official Auror business," Harry explained at Parkinson's questioning look. She was sitting on her desk chair with numerous pieces of parchement laid out in front of her. Judging from the color of the parchment and the familiar scent that Harry can faintly smell, they were the letters found in the Manor's rubble that were addressed to her. "I'm the Auror in charge of the Malfoy Manor Case."
Harry stuffed the papers in his bag and stood up to go back to Celeste. His original plan was to figure out where Dr. Laurent's office was and go there using his Invisibility Cloak. A quick Confundus charm would probably loosen the doctor's tongue but now, he thinks that it's better to go to Building B and get the answers that he's looking for without having to sneak around.
"I'm sorry…" He said as he started to step away from him but before he can move back any further, hands gripped his wrists and pulled him back until he's flushed against Draco's firm torso.
"I'm sorry…" He mumbled after downing the beverage in one go. "I…I don't know what happened."

Luna looked over her wife's shoulder while the rest of the group waited.
Finally, Harry flipped to the last document that Parkinson sent him. It was mostly blank with only a single paragraph on it along with the necessary headings, signatures, and stamps that make legal whatever is written on the parchment.
"Okay," She finally said. "You're all set!"
This time, Harry didn't forget about the Masidec. It now hung on his neck, the cool pendant resting against his warm chest. He didn't want it to be exposed too much because it was still quite fragile so he resorted to keeping it inside his shirt. Its usual hollowed crystal was now filled with what little of Draco's magical signature Harry could extract from the box that Luna gave him. It was so faint that he has a theory that its glow might almost be unnoticeable to the naked eye. He would probably have to be a lot closer  for the Masidec to detect the owner of the magic that it has encapsulated.
"How long has it been glowing?" He asked, walking over to the woman while holding up the pendant of the device. Sonya shrugged and went back to sorting the miniscule beetle eyes.
"Well, he is cute. And for that, I'll give you an extra biscuit."
Draco's head snapped to Potter's direction.
A little while later, Harry and Draco sat in front of each other in the latter's kitchen with cups of tea on the table in front of them. The way that they faced each other was quite similar to when Harry first went here but it also felt more intimate.
Harry braced himself and knocked three times.
"The Ministry walls have ears, Potter." Draco said simply after taking a deep breath to calm down after his outburst. "Everyone is basically waiting for the day that you go insane and become the next Dark Lord. They have blackmail material, tons of it, as well as a 'contingency plan' of some sort for the day that you actually become Dark. They even have your fellow Aurors and some Unspeakables to watch you at all times."
"I just want the best for him."
The two of them finally settled on a bench in the middle of the deserted Place Sathonay, just a few metres away from the statue.
"Hey, that was years ago--" Harry objected, suddenly tensing up. "He really was up to something at that time. Besides, this is different!"
"Why are you here?" Ron inquired, his tone only slightly accusing. Harry could see Parkinson roll her eyes as she gestured for the Aurors to leave the albino peacocks alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
The young Potions Master doesn't know what to feel. He's torn between being relieved and being troubled.
Harry sat up and faced Draco before he nodding and mumbling a soft "Yes".
"Of course," The redhead said, already getting up from his seat. "Let me just get some Pepper-Up before I fall asleep on my feet. The thingamajig is with George right now. He's still working on the additional enchantments but he did say that it's safe to use for the most part."
For the first year, Harry tried to look everywhere but to no avail. He couldn't procure a solid enough evidence for Robards to give him permission to investigate in France. He still went there just for the heck of it, in the guise of a 'vacation'. He visited all the cities encircled in the map from the memories. No sign of Draco Malfoy anywhere. He couldn't actually stay in the country just to wait for him to pop up. He was basically just walking around blind without any actual lead to nudge him to the right direction.
"Sir, Head Auror Robards needs you in Conference Room #5 as soon as possible." She said, voice still as professional as ever but it held a tone of urgency. Harry figured that Robards had spoken to her himself. He would never understand why the Head Auror refuses to just send interdepartmental memos instead of terrorizing the junior staff every chance he gets. "He says it's urgent and it's about The Missing Wizards case."
Draco snorted and rolled his eyes.
Harry let out a chuckle but it was really more of a huff.
Wait.
Harry snorted.
Somewhere along the way Malfoy has turned into Draco.
Another silence passed between them. Harry picked up his cup of tea and took a sip from it. His eyes caught something inside the cup. Something was painted on it. He was tempted to down the hot drink at once but he didn't fancy burning his throat so he settled for occasionally drinking it until the tea is gone. Adhil simply stood there, not saying anything. The man finally spoke shortly after Harry finished his tea.
They were joined by Millicent and Daphne just a few minutes after they have started digging into the dishes that both Pansy and Luna worked hard to cook. The evening passed by in a jolly manner with the newlyweds telling them stories about their month long honeymoon – often including too much information courtesy of Luna – and with the rest of the group catching them up on news about Wizarding London. Millicent and Daphne regaled them all with stories about their adopted daughter, Celestine. Neville, as the current Herbology professor, told tales about Hogwarts while Ginny talked about her time as chaser for the Holyhead Harpies. Blaise boasted about his latest sexual conquests and how he now has blackmail material against half of the pureblood circles that he's in. Ron and Hermione, on the other hand, shared their plans to renovate their house to prepare for any future children that they might have. All Harry could do was listen to his friends' tales. He couldn't really share anything with them seeing as Auror matters are confidential and any time spend outside the Ministry is spent on finding clues either about Draco's whereabouts or about the latest case that they have at hand. Harry tells himself that he is perfectly content with hearing about his friends' lives and that he doesn't need to do anything spontaneous or exciting. He just has to focus on his job for the time being.
"I don't need your help," he hissed, pushing himself off the large mattress.
the last of a dying race. The Pureblood race.
Draco blanched. "You...what?"
"Just couldn't leave it alone, could you?" the raven-haired man hissed, jaw clenched and eyes narrowed in a fierce glare.
, he thinks, and himself along with them. He liked to pretend that he wasn't a part of those terrible people, a part of the things they'd done, and the beliefs they held, but the mark on his arm proved otherwise. He, and the rest of the Wizarding World, would never forget that.
"Potter. Potter, stop," he mumbled, batting his free hand against the dark-haired man's chest as he tried to pull away.
None of the curses he knew could cause such an illness, but Death Eaters weren't really the type to try to give their enemy a common cold, either, so he figured it made sense. He briefly considered seeing if Pomfrey might be willing to give him a vial of Pepper Up, but given how she'd refused to treat any of his previous ailments this year, he figured it unlikely. So, it seemed he'd just have to suffer through it. He dealt with worse, after all.
"I'll just, uh..." The raven pointed towards the door, and then quickly scurried away without another word, shutting the door behind him.
"Malfoy?" a voice cut through the otherwise silent air of the bedroom, and Draco jumped, snapping straight up in bed as he whirled to face the intruder. He barely had time to take in the rich, warm colors filling the walls and smooth mahogany accents before true, cold panic began to set in.
care about the selfish, cowardly little Death Eater who couldn't even stand up against his own father? He didn't
Harry, whose hands were dislodged by the movement, hovered nervously beside the weeping boy. What the bloody fuck was he supposed to do now? He had no doubt that Malfoy was half-delirious from the burning fever raging through his thin body, but that still left him no closer to knowing how to comfort the boy. The last time he'd seen Malfoy cry had been in Sixth Year, and that had
not in the way that counts.
exactly he was helping and leave Draco to drown in the aftermath of his mistakes. To his continued shock, though, Potter just began swiping a gentle thumb back and forth across the Slytherin's cheekbone, green eyes open and searching and so different from anything Draco was used to seeing that it made his head spin all over again.
Potter scoffed. "Innocent, yeah," he muttered, and Draco flinched. The action seemed to surprise Potter, who slowly stepped toward him, looking at him as though trying to decipher a particularly confusing code in Arithmancy. Normally, this would have been the part where Draco stood up, dusted off, and stormed away in a swish of black fabric, but at this point he thought he might fall over if he tried to stand, so instead he did the next best thing and curled up tighter into himself, glaring at his knees as he studiously ignored the other boy's presence.
He remembered one time in September when a Fifth Year Hufflepuff had managed to charm his robes to smell like burnt flesh. The blonde had barely had time to stumble into to the nearest bathroom before he was falling to his knees and vomiting up every bit of the meager breakfast he'd choked down that morning. When his body had finally granted him a second to breathe, he'd glanced up only to find the one and only Harry Potter staring down a him with a mix of shock and confusion adorning his face. Needless to say, Draco had meticulously avoided the Gryffindor ever since that incident.
The Slytherin didn't know how long he sat there, carefully measuring each inhale and exhale, but it could have been seconds or hours later that he felt a cool, firm touch suddenly press against his forehead. The Draco's eyes flew open, measured breaths forgotten as he took in the tall, blurred figure crouched before him in hallway, one hand reaching out to lightly trace the crease between the blonde's eyebrows. He flinched back with a strangled cry, eyes clenching shut reflexively the stranger whispered an unfamiliar spell, and braced himself for the onslaught of agony that was sure to follow.
breakable, even
Together, the two boy shuffled through the door, Draco gripping Potter's bicep tightly as he toed of his shoes before stumbling over to the bed and sitting down with a huff. He drew his legs up to the mattress, sitting cross-legged as he gazed bemusedly at the other boy.
Potter said nothing, refusing to meet his gaze as he conjured a glass and filled it with a murmured
what he'd had in mind. Fortunately, though, the fit only lasted a few seconds, leaving the smaller man to slump exhaustedly into Harry's chest. Malfoy was completely limp against him, the only sign he was alive at all being the weak, warm puffs of air against Harry's shoulder and rapid pulse beating where their chests were pressed together.
, of all people. Merlin knows the boy has enough on his plate without adding Draco's whines to the mix.
"Why are you even out of bed? You're in no condition to go to class," the taller boy admonished. The raven had had a few days to think over their encounter earlier that week, and had, after much grumbling, come to the begrudging conclusion that the blonde seemed genuine in his apology, in his regret. Harry had seen enough in Sixth Year and during the war to know that the paler boy had never truly been one of the Death Eaters
"You should go to Pomfrey," he said at last.
Draco took the offering, sipping carefully at the cool liquid. Severus would be appalled at Draco's failure to check it wasn't poisoned, but at this point he couldn't really be bothered to care. He just wanted to sleep.
Harry shifted, glancing uncomfortably around the empty hallway as though it would contain the answers to this suddenly
The blonde's head jerked up at the sound of his first name, eyes wide with shock as he gazed at the Gryffindor. Slowly, his eyes moved to fall back down to the carpet, where he stood solemnly as he contemplated his options. All his instincts screamed at him that he should hightail it out of there, leave Potter and his stupidly green eyes and stupid kindness for someone else to deal with, but...he really didn't want to. Something in him was pulling him towards the other boy, and, just like every other time he felt it, he found himself unable to resist.
Draco sighed, sagging back against the wall and closing his eyes as shivers continued wracking his body as aftereffects of the fading panic attack. He didn't know how long he remained like that, gentle waves of magic continuing to pulse from the touch on his chest and neck, but when he finally gathered the strength to look up again, he found himself face-to-face with one Harry Potter. At least he wasn't surprised, this time.
Everything was too bright. And cold - so very, very cold. Ever since Potter had helped him back to his room the other day, Draco had been feeling exceptionally off-kilter. His fever had spiked, pushing him into a vicious cycle of alternating chills and hot flashes; his head ached constantly, and the prickling shivers that raced through his body were so closely reminiscent of the Cruciatus Curse that he'd had no less than five panic attacks in the past three days. To top it all off, that Seventh Year Ravenclaw wouldn't stop hexing him, the bruises and welts she caused only adding to the pain that raged through his body. He'd taken to cutting through abandoned wings of the castle in an attempt to avoid her between classes. The memories provided by those dusty corridors were harsh, but he was desperate.
"Goddammit Malfoy!" Potter burst, causing the other boy to jerk back in surprise. "Why do always have to be such a fucking arsehole?!"
As they rounded yet another corner in the path, Draco gave a quiet sigh, which his nose apparently took as a signal to make itself known again. The blonde gave a sharp sniff as tickle blossomed in his sinuses, muscles tensing as it began to grow stronger.
Potter returned his gaze solemnly, an unreadable emotion flickering in his eyes. "I don't know."
Harry sighed, adjusting his grip to grab hold of Malfoy's wrist and drape it over his shoulders, wrapping an arm around his waist to steady him. He waited until Malfoy's glazed silver orbs finally blinked open again and, frowning the startling heat radiating from the other man, slowly began down the corridor. Malfoy followed him silently, and Harry didn't know if he should be relieved or worried at the lack of insults from the Slytherin.
"These are, uh, my private rooms. They're closer than the Eighth Year dorms, and I figured it'd be more convenient than me walking back and forth to check on you all the time."
Draco arched a perfectly-tailored brow. "I'm not the one who just ambushed an innocent bystander on their back way to their dorms."
"Well- yes. But it's not like that!" Potter burst, hands waving frantically before him as though to demonstrate his earnestness. "I just..." he paused, brow crinkling. "I'm worried about you, Malfoy," he said at last, emerald eyes lifting to pin Draco with an intense stare.
hadn't been the opposite of what Draco was expecting...
Draco, who was too busy trying to get the world to stop spinning to process anything that was happening, simply stuttered out a stupid, "W-what?"
"Why do you care?" the blonde mumbled dazedly, and then winced as he realized what he'd said. He steeled himself for the moment when the other man would finally remember just
He was fairly certain he had a fever, given the fuzzy, disconnected feeling of everything, and the strange ache in his chest made itself known through vicious coughing fits at least once an hour. He'd had to excuse himself from class several times to hack his lungs out in the bathroom (thank Merlin for Silencing Charms), and was fairly certain that he'd passed out for a few moment after the second fit. He couldn't really be sure, though.
Draco curled himself into a ball, desperately trying to remember how to breathe, but all he could think about were the two red eyes staring at him in his dreams, cold and ruthless and so very much
Malfoy? Harry cringed. He knew the git was attractive, but
Draco pushed weakly against the other boy, mouth opening and closing wordlessly as he tried to figure out what the bloody hell was going on.
Potter was at his side in an instant, strong hands keeping him from crashing face-first to the floor as the taller boy shifted to keep their balance. They ended up standing chest-to-chest with Potter's hands clasped firmly around Draco's forearms, holding him up as he peered down at him.
The things he'd been forced to see, to do during the War weighed heavily upon him as he trudged an stumbled through the shattered remains of his life. Sometimes he was so overwhelmed by the past that he forgot how to breathe, how to think; he would lie there in his room for hours in his room waiting for the tremors and flashbacks to pass.
and it worried the taller boy to no end. Harry didn't know why he suddenly cared so much for the Slytherin, but a voice in the back of his mind that sounded suspiciously like Hermione told him it wasn't exactly the first time he'd been concerned for the other boy. He knew that, if left to his own devices, Malfoy would just wind up in another situation like this, if not worse.
"Don't play with me, Malfoy," the other boy growled, eyes narrowing further as the blonde continued to struggle. "I know you've been hiding something."
uncomfortable situation. A cruel, scheming, hiding-Dark-artifacts-in-the-castle Malfoy, he knew how to deal with. But a sick, vulnerable Malfoy? Merlin.
Five long years.
"I think that's what I want to do now. Travel the world to study magical creatures."
"Oh…right." Harry frowned. He should've known. Every time Malfoy goes to dinner with his family, he always ends up disoriented the following day. As if he's had too much Dreamless Sleep or Calming Draught. The blonde trudged exhaustedly towards his desk. He walked around Harry and sat on the chair with a heavy sigh. He rested his elbows on the arm rest and closed his eyes as he began to massage his temples. "Thank you, Potter… I'll look over it later. I just…I need to rest."
"Not Fiendfyre?"
"It's a letter from Aunt Andromeda." Draco said, singling out an envelope with a purple wax seal.
"What if he used a Vanishing Cabinet?" The former Ravenclaw asked again.
"I am not about to reveal my full identity in broad daylight, Potter."
Potter was looking at him with pleading eyes. It made Draco's resolve crumble until it was no more. Potter said it himself. He just wants to know the truth. If he tells Potter to leave him alone he probably would.
"You persuaded the Wizengamot to not even put any of them on house arrest, which, in my opinion, Malfoy kind of deserved for letting those Death Eaters in during sixth year."
"Do you mind if I…?" He asked, gesturing to the enchanted quill. Parkinson shook her head and motioned for Harry to do what he pleases.
Roughly three years into their relationship and he's still as smitten as the first day he realized that he has a crush on a certain green-eyed specky git. Draco felt like he was floating on clouds when he found out that the feeling was mutual and has been mutual for quite some time before Harry even made his way to France.
Harry set the cup back down on the coffee table.
"Mr…"
"The flowers." Harry said before reaching into his pocket and fishing out a small vial of Headache Relieving Potion. "Sorry, my head is starting to hurt again."
"Where's the arm now?" Harry inquired.
Harry and Adhil spoke at the same time.
They were dismissed after the teams were divided and given more information and instruction.
"Yeah, I'll head outside for a moment and send a patronus." Ron replied, already standing up from his seat. He brandished a mobile phone in his hand to make it look like he was just about to make a call.
"Perhaps I can join you…?" It came out as more of a question than a suggestion.
"What does she mean ancient? She's as radiant as the sun!" Draco argued, already opening the envelope. Aside from the folded parchment, it also held a photograph that the blond gave to Harry.
"You know…"
"I'll help you out with that, Nev." Luna offered with a soft smile. However, before Neville can reply he was cut off by Ron.
"I'm…" Harry started to say but was immediately cut off by Adhil.
Harry knows that it's a bit if a dirty tactic but he's actually genuinely curious about how exactly Adhil Blanchet is involved in the hospital's cancer treatment program, how he's managed to improve the Cell Cleansing Potion, and how he convinced the French Ministry of Magic to let wizards be involved with Muggle medicine.
"That's the thing!" The first one said. "They didn't have to pay as much as they did back in Italy! I'm telling you, Philip, that hospital is a work of art. Six weeks in and my cousin's cancer? Gone! Absolutely gone!"
He ignored the stack of paperwork on his desk – paperwork that he needed to sign to properly close the cases that they solved in the past week – in lieu of heading straight to the cabinets that held the pensieve. Harry then reached into one of his robe pockets and fished out the vial that held the silvery liquid. He popped of the lid and poured the memory into the shallow dish in front of him before bracing himself to go in.
"Well, if you insist." Hermione said, tone laced with amusement before she joined them as well.
"From me?"
"M-Malfoy!"
"I think we should still observe them, just in case." Harry suggested.
Adhil went to look through the peephole. His knees almost gave out when he saw who was behind the door.
He has a lot of time to process his other emotions but for now--
"Thought you'd never ask," Parkinson commented, once again setting down her quill. "Three days ago."
"You lot always underestimated, Draco." Parkinson spat out coldly. "You always believed the worst in him but never in his abilities. You never took him seriously and I bet that you didn't even believe that he was helping you when he tried. Tell me, did the brightest witch of her age realize who gave her the correct information back in second year? Did you assume that the torn page about the basilisk just came from nowhere? And did the Savior of the Wizarding World even stop to think about why in Morgana's balls would Dobby help you in the first place? How the hell did Dobby even knew about Gillyweed in the first place? I bet it meant nothing to the lot of you that he gave Potter his bloody wand at the end right there. You always underestimated him and he let you so you wouldn't feel bad about it. Poor sod always letting you win."
"Then maybe those left over Death Eaters got to him."
This was going to be a long day.
It was another slow and exhausting day for the Auror office. Harry was sat by his desk, reviewing and signing the paperworks of the newly solved cases. He's rushing quite a bit since he would have to be at Queensberry Place by noon for his scheduled patrol with Auror Dillywaddle. He would much rather have Ron as his partner but his bestfriend has been put on a different shift. Something about "not having two of the top Aurors being in the same place while others are in need of assistance" or something like that.
"Harry," she began to say in an understanding tone. "If this is about what Parkinson said the other day--"
"Oh." Draco said, seemingly stuck at finding the next words to say.
"Hmm? What is it? Are you okay?" Harry started to ask a bit frantically, looking over Draco and scanning his body for any sign of injury.
The second thing that Harry became aware of was the alertness that he felt. It was strange since his body would always feel like lead whenever he takes Dreamless Sleep. It was a side-effect that he didn't particularly like but it was favourable to the nightmares that used to plague him on a nightly basis. This time, however, he felt well-rested and as fresh as a daisy. Whatever formula Adhil came up with, it was amazing. Absolutely revolutionary and also quite addicting. It's both better and worse than the original because its lack of side-effects will definitely have witches and wizards scrambling to get it. That is, if they haven't already done that.
"Thanks," He mumbled with a tired yet grateful smile. "I'll see you tomorrow."
"It was a wild guess but it's amusing to know that I am correct." The dark haired man said, briefly looking at his godson before shifting his attention back to the book that he's holding. "So, has he managed to find you yet? I do remember you mentioning in a letter from Ms. Parkinson that Potter is the one in-charge of your case."
Harry just shook his head in disagreement.
"But I don't want to." Harry murmured, growing worried. He really doesn't want to be what the Ministry is expecting him to be.
"Thank you, Janice." Harry said with a smile, already fixing the messy stack of papers on his desk. "I'll head there right away."
"I beg your pardon?"
Next update: September 3 (?)
A day before Parkinson's visit to the Manor, Malfoy visited Gringotts and withdrawn 5000 Galleons in person which further strengthened his belief that the blond git is alive. On the same day, he also made arrangements to transfer all of the Malfoy vaults, properties, and investments to Parkinson. He basically named Parkinson the rightful heir to the Malfoy wealth and has signed himself off as incapable of performing duties expected of a Lord Malfoy thus making the transfer and declaration immediate.
He didn't regret leaving though. At that time, it felt like the wisest choice and it still does. He feels happy here. Relaxed. Calm. He is finally free from other people's expectations, from being the heir that he was raised to be, from being the prejudiced little git that he was molded to be. Not only was his fortune entirely his but it was also the fruits of his labours – having earned every galleon, sickle, and knut all by himself with nothing but his abilities coupled with hard work.
"Yer pullin' me leg, Kevin." Philip said in an exasperated tone.
"I think that you want to be found…" the Auror clarified. "For five years, none of us heard from you but then your gift suddenly appeared out of nowhere."
A week after that, another missing case was reported. This time, it was someone working in the Ministry. Michael Quinn, 22, a trainee Hit Wizard. Several days passed before he was reported missing. He often skipped training for a day or two but when four days passed and he was yet to be heard from, one of his friends decided to visit his flat only to find it empty. He lived alone and mostly kept to himself when he's at home so his neighbours have no idea where he could be. He was last scene at the Leaky Cauldron, after a night out with his fellow trainees. Not a single soul has seen him after that.
Kreacher responded with a grumble while Malfoy merely snorted.
Geneva Gladstone was sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban with no chance of parole. All of the victims' bodies were retrieved and given a proper burial, any traces of Dark Magic were already expelled from them.
The moment Harry stepped out on the front porch, the door closed behind him. It was immediately followed by more clicking sounds as the locks were put back into place. He sighed and walked to a hidden alley where he could apparate to Wizarding Paris to find an inn he can stay at.
"Which is what, exactly?"
It was almost as he remembered it all those years ago but also quite different. Not only did Draco looked more mature but he also looked healthier and happier. Gone were the dark purple circles under his eyes and the sunken cheeks that Harry can still vividly remember from the Pensieve memories. In their place were the features of someone who looked like they were getting adequate sleep and nutrition, someone who has long moved on from the terrors of their past and have chosen to live their new life.
"A house-elf, maybe?" Daphne supplied from beside Millicent.
"Adhil."
Harry laid down on his bed and stared at ceiling for hours. His body might be calm and stationary but his brain was busy connecting things and clues that are there.
"No," He replied, feeling the pendant of his necklace through his shirt. The small trinket usually brought him comfort but now it's just increasing the anxiety that he's feeling. "But he might discover the truth soon."
"I…I am the Auror in charge of his case." Harry said, trying to keep his tone steady. "I have to find him no matter what it takes."
"Right, okay." He began as he thought about where to start. "I'm not here on Auror business but I am here to ask if you've seen someone…or if you know this person."
"It's funny..." He murmured after some time. "It's funny how it took Potter being in France to convince me to finally creep back into friends' lives."
Looking back at the conversation, Harry felt a bit ridiculous. He sighed as he stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, unable to sleep despite having a happy and satisfied stomach. He can count on one hand the number of times he has spoken to Malfoy since the war. It was never a friendly meeting, nor was it an unfriendly one. They merely nod at each other in acknowledgement whenever they meet at the Ministry. The last time Harry had a semblance of a conversation with Malfoy was after he testified for him during the trials.
"It could be less of a creation and more of a modification to an existing spell. Maybe, the vanishing spell…" She trailed off, looking at the amethyst pendant on her necklace before turning to her wife who was currently reading the note Draco left. "Put it on me?"
"He's here," He began. "In France. In Lyon to be exact. He even came here… in this house a few days ago."
"So, a glamour?"
"Ah, Auror Potter." He heard a muffled voice approach him. He looked up to see a junior Auror he rarely saw in the office. But then again, they had a lot of Aurors, both trainees and regulars alike. They shouldn't expect Harry to know all of their names. "I'm Junior Auror Hector Mulligan. If you would follow me please." The lower half of his face was covered with some sort of decorated cloth, probably transfigured from whatever item was available. Harry decided to do the same and pull out a handkerchief to enlarge it a bit before wrapping it around the lower part of his face the same way his colleague did.
However, this erratic behavior stemmed from the harassment that she had to tolerate as a receptionist. Geneva has repeatedly reported those incidents but nothing came out of it until she was sacked. From then on, her frustration and hatred for men increased at a drastic pace. It didn't help that wherever she went, she would either get sexually harassed or see someone else suffer in that situation.
Adhil and Sonya stared at each other over Harry's head, a silent conversation happening between the two of them. This exchange went unnoticed by the Auror who was now rubbing his temples with closed eyes.
Once her blood touched the box, it sizzled and seeped into the wood. A few moments passed before a click was heard and the box opened on its own.
A few moments passed.
She said that to Draco before he disappeared.
"Do you reckon we should ask for backup?" He asked. "This might get nasty especially since we're not a hundred percent sure if Joseph and Julia are innocent."
Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes again. He fished an envelope bearing the Ministry of Magic seal from his inner robe pocket and slid it over the counter, towards the goblin.
"Congratulations to the both of you. These are enchanted necklaces. It will heat up once it senses danger befall the other pair's wearer. It also serves as a portkey that will immediately transport you to your beloved. May the two of you live long and prosper in each other's love."
"Whatever." Harry mumbled, trying his best to school his expression into anything but an amused smile. He reached for his cup and sipped his first serving of tea for the day. "Anything of importance in the Prophet today? You never read that crap unless something catches your eye."
"Your wards can detect insects?" Neville suddenly asked.
"Emilia is very protective over her 'secret recipe'. I asked her about it once, you know what she told me?"
Aside from the one placed on the Manor, the monitoring charms and alarms on everything else that's related to the Malfoys are in tact: Draco Malfoy's wand, all of their properties across Europe, the and their numerous vaults.
"Don't worry! They're not a criminal!" Harry assured them. "It's just…this person has been missing for over five years now and I have reason to believe that he's here in France and that he's either involved in this whole cancer treatment business or you know him."
"You might hate me again."
"I apologize. I wasn't really comfortable having this conversation with so many Muggles nearby," Draco said, arms and legs crossed. He took a deep breath while Harry calmly sat beside him, not saying anything and letting the blond lead the conversation. A fluttering feelung was starting to form inside his chest at the idea of him being correct in his theory that Adhil is indeed Draco. "How do you know? What gave you the idea that I am who you think I am?"
"If you're talking about the weekly dinner that my mother has arranged ever since Father has been let out of Azkaban in order to mend the tattered father-and-son relationship that we have, why yes. That is indeed today and I'm already running late. Draft. Tomorrow. 8AM. Or I'll send your chopped up pieces to Hagrid so that he can feed them to the Thestrals."
"You have the potential to." Was Draco's answer. "You have the power. You can have the following if you want to. You just need a cause."
A melodic tinkle of chimes alerted Adhil to a new customer that has just entered the shop. He was currently standing by the shelves filled with healing potions, a notepad in hand as he jotted down the ones he needs to brew a batch of. He's the only one in the shop for now. His assistant, Sonya, went to have an early lunch so that they would both be prepared for the afternoon rush of customers. Business was always a little slow in the morning to early noon so, the Potions Master always takes this opportunity to make an initial inventory of his stock.
"Eh, we can't rule anything out, mate. Remember the Barkley case?"
That was the first thing Harry Potter got a whiff of once he arrived at the scene. The scent was so thick and heavy, laced with more than just burning wood and metal that Harry had to shield his nose with his arm. The next thing that caught his attention was the burnt down remains of what once was a grand structure. The only other memory he had of this place was dark. It once loomed ominously as Harry walked to what he thought would be his death just a mere five years ago. He tried to imagine the structure in a bright setting. It would've been beautiful. However, that mental image will never see the light of day as he examined what was left of the house. Blackened rubble was all he could see along with the smoke that was still rising from the heap. Something was flickering and it seems like there is still fire to be extinguished although Harry is not a hundred percent sure.
Hermione let out a sigh as she charmed the dishes to wash themselves. Ron, on the other hand, started to put mugs of tea on the table. As the three of them sat down, Hermione reached over the table to hold Harry's hands in hers.
"I thought you knew about it. You often write to Pansy, don't you?"
"Huh," She said, putting down her quill and sitting back on her chair with her arms folded over her chest. She stared at Harry with a calculating gaze. A few moments passed and Harry was just about to ask her what the hell she was staring at when Parkinson shrugged and went back to looking over the pieces of parchment on her desk.
"The Ministry aren't going to stop being bigots just because the Dark Lord is gone." Draco said, matter-of-factly. "There will always be another one that will rise whether it be right now, two years from now, or even a century from today."
"Open ours next!" Daphne squealed, pointing to a box wrapped in glittery silver wrapping paper. After dinner, they all gather in the living room to watch Pansy and Luna open their wedding presents. One by one, they all claimed a spot in the small area, each of them with a glass of sherry in one hand. Harry sat on one of the armrests of the chair that Hermione is sitting on while Ron sat on the floor in front of it, letting Hermione run her hands through her husband's hair.
He is so confused and his head is starting to hurt from all the thoughts swimming inside his head. Harry feels like he knows the blond in front of him. He feels like he has seen him before, maybe even talked to him. However, one part of his brain is also saying that he has never met anyone named Adhil Blanchet.
Malfoy took out his wand and did a small wave. The tea-filled kettle immediately poured him another cuppa. The blonde made a show of sipping the hot tea before giving any sort of response to Harry's question.
Seeing as the investigation of the Manor is still under works, the trio's conversation soon moved into the topic of Parkinson's memory.
"Letters? Potter, I've never sent you letters--"
"Won't be what?"
"See! Wait what?"
"I think so. If it's not one of the staff, it's definitely one of the guests. How's the thing going?"
"Come with me." He said, turning around and heading out the door. His drink and food were left to be forgotten. Harry caught sight of Emilia who was behind the till and glaring at him. The Auror shrugged and smiled apologetically before following the other wizard out the door.
His mouth suddenly became dry that he head to swallow and clear his throat before attempting to speak but even then he doesn't know what to say. He held up the item towards his face to further examine the tag on it. The pouch only had a small brown tag attached to it. It had no name nor signature. It only had an image, a drawing of a flower. It's a flower so familiar to Harry for he spent the last five years staring at a copy of it imprinted on a wax seal.
Harry stared at the face in front of him. His brows furrowed at the platinum blond hair that sparked something in his mind but his logic seemed to have failed in connecting his thought processes to come up with an answer. The stranger's eyes, nose, cheekbones, and lips are all familiar to him. The way those steel grey eyes curiously looked at him is also eerily familiar but he couldn't understand why.
It was by a stroke of luck that Potter just had to be the Auror – the lone one, it seems like – assigned on this particular case, letting him have free reign over the entire investigation along with every decision and evidence.
At this point, the fake sweet look disappeared from the waitress' face and she looked like she was about to use force on this man but before anyone can make a move, the bartender left his station and positioned himself beside his co-workers. He laid a hand on the drunk man's arm.
"Oh, sure! Ms. Parkinson is in her office. Let me just inform her that you're here."
The chimes tinkled again. It seems like the late morning lull is over as customers were starting to file into the shop. Soon enough, Adhil and Sonya's attention were divided between patrons. Harry saw the diversity of the shop's customers. From those in simple work robes to those wearing highly fashionable ones. It looks like "
"Is he a regular here?" Harry asked.
Draco only hummed in response.
"What's she doing here?" Perkins whispered to Ron, who only shrugged in response. Parkinson is breaking a shit ton of protocols by just sauntering into the property but, in all honesty, the trio were far too disturbed with her revelations to care about protocols. Plus, she's Draco's closest friend. If anyone can give them information about his whereabouts, it's her.
There's no name nor signature written on the tag but Harry can recognize that flower anywhere especially in the way that it was drawn; the way the petals blossomed and the stems slightly curved. For the flower that's currently staring at him is the same flower on the wax seal of the letter that Draco wrote to him.
to care about himself, let alone have
Draco - it was hard to think of him as Malfoy now, given that he was sitting in Harry's bed - looked at the clothes in surprise, and then up at him, before tentatively taking them from the darker boy's hand. "Thanks," he mumbled, and Harry shrugged.
ksh! ktsh! kxt! tsh!" By the time he'd finished, his vision swam and the pain in his skull had doubled in intensity. Draco groaned, cheeks flushing at his failure to cover the tiny explosions, despite there having been no one around to witness it. He slowly began making his way down the corridor, praying to every higher being he knew that his attacker hadn't followed him.
The blonde spluttered, face flushing a darkly as he shoved hard against Potter's chest (the arsehole didn't even budge). "I fucking do not," he grumbled, and Potter just chuckled, readjusting his grip around Draco before continuing their walk down the abandoned corridor.
He slipped his shirt from his slim shoulders, shivering as the cool air hit his exposed skin. "Draco Malfoy," he sighed to himself, "you truly are pathetic."
The taller man stilled in his ministrations, jaw tensing at Draco's words. Perhaps he was about to curse Draco for being pathetic enough to allow something like a fever to stop him from serving his legal sentence. Or worse, perhaps he just couldn't take the reminder of who Draco was, of what he'd done, and was about to abandon him there in the dingy corridor floor. The blonde whimpered at the thought, turning away as shivers began to wrack his body again. He didn't even realize he was crying until a single, hot tear slipped down his cheek, pooling in the dip between Potter's thumb and forefinger. It was quickly followed by another, and another, and then soon enough there were two steady rivulets running down the sides of his face as shame burned through his body.
but, as his eyes roamed over the pale, shivering form at his feet, Harry knew he couldn't do it.
He took it back. This is quite possibly the worse he's ever felt short of being Crucio'd by the Dark Lord (but really, that was a whole other category in and of itself). By the time Friday evening rolled around, Draco was just about ready to fall over.
He stepped forward, keeping his face carefully neutral as he wrapped a hand around Malfoy's bicep and hauled the other boy to his feet with a grunt. "Come on," he muttered, ignoring the blonde's squawk of protest but pausing as it quickly turned into a strangled whine as the smaller man swayed suddenly on his feet, eyes squeezing shut and jaw clenched.
"What?" he snapped, cheeks heating.
Draco scowled, opening his mouth to tell the other boy just exactly where he could shove it, but was cut off as the itch in his nose prickled suddenly, and instead found himself twisting away to muffle a series of tiny, wet explosions against his wrist. "hihtchh! hihksh! tsh!"
Potter sighed. "Look, Malfoy, I'm not forcing you to stay here. You're free to go if you really want. But you really aren't well, Draco. I wish you would just let me help you."
They continued like that for a while, stopping every couple of minutes for Draco to muffle another sneezing or coughing fit into his shoulder. By the time they reached the Eighth Year dorms, Draco's head was spinning and the only thing keeping him from sinking to the floor in a heap of frazzled Slytherin was Potter's firm grip around his wrist and side.
, he realized distantly.
. The ache of rejection surged up through Draco and he swallowed harshly, fear and hopelessness clawing at him so strongly that for a moment he feared he might die right then and there. In the end, though, it was fatigue, not Death, that had him leaning back against the softness of the mattress, letting himself fall into the sweet kiss of oblivion.
So when a particularly nasty hex from a Seventh Year Ravenclaw girl nearly bowled him over in the hallway one sunny October morning, he wasn't all that surprised, nor was he when he nearly puked all over the bed that evening from the blinding headache in his skull. He figured it was probably some sort of migraine hex, but when he woke up the following morning and his previous symptoms were joined by stuffed sinuses and a strange, burning ache in his lungs, he realized it was perhaps something else entirely.
Thankfully, it was late enough that no one was there to witness as Harry Potter dragged a half-conscious Draco Malfoy across the common room and down the hallway for the male dorms. Draco's room was all the way at the end, made invisible by a strong series of disillusionment spells (he'd had to do that bit himself, of course; not like the school would actually be
Black spots began to swim across Draco's vision, and he felt his grip on the Saviour's robes slowly slacken before his entire body eventually began to droop in Potter's hold.
The Ministry insisted on his return here for the first months of his parole, likely hoping the students would be kind enough to take his Death Eater arse off their hands. So far, none had managed to permanently maim him, but the constant stream of Stinging Hexes being flung his way served as an excellent reminder of just how many people were out to get him. He couldn't blame them, though.
Draco frowned, glancing around at the rich colors decorating the large room. He still had no idea why he'd been brought here. Or where 'here' even was. He told the other boy as much, and Potter's cheeks darkened, clearing his throat awkwardly as he refused to meet Draco's eyes.
care about him.
The last thing he expected was for Potter to make a small, startled sound in the back of his throat, moving his hands to cup both sides of Draco's face and tilting it back towards him. Callused thumbs swiped slowly across the tear tracks on his cheeks, and Draco choked back a sob at the gentleness of the action. It'd been so long since someone had touched him like this, like they cared about him, and the fact that it was
"...Malfoy?" The soft voice jarred him out of his thoughts, and Draco blinked to realize he'd been glaring a hole into the spot near his feet for some time now.
Malfoy's head jerked up, brow creasing in bemusement as though wondering why the other boy was still there, before settling back into his usual cold sneer. "You think I haven't already tried that, you dolt?" he snapped. "The old bat doesn't give a flying fuck whether I live or die. No one does." The last bit was said quieter, smaller, and Harry doubted he was meant to hear it.
As if summoned, his nose have a sudden twitch, and he found himself pitching forward into cupped hands with a flurry of rapid expulsions.
"Can't jus' skip class," the blonde sighed at last, ignoring Potter's other question. "The Ministry
"I...fine," he muttered begrudgingly, voice coming out quiet and unsteady for reasons entirely unrelated to his sickness. He cleared his throat. "Fine, I'll stay," he said louder, ignoring the way the other boy's face seemed to brighten at his words. "But it's only because it's far too much work to sneak back to the Eight Year dorms," he added with a sniff, fighting to keep his cold expression in place as the other boy positively beamed back at him.
It seems like the woman has lost her finesse as she began to fire more curses in quick succession, not caring at all about her aim. Harry and Ron were too busy casting shield charms to retaliate. Luckily, the Muggles were safely behind the bar at this point along with Julia and the host. Unfortunately, it was at this point that the male cook emerged from the kitchen, confused at what's happening. Seeing as none of them expected him to come out, Harry, Ron, and Joseph failed to cast a shield to protect him. The woman took this opportunity to fire an dark purple curse in his direction. Before anyone knew it, the cook's arm was ripped off out of its socket, blood sprouting everywhere, mixing with the liquor that was already on the floor. The man let out a painful scream, making their ears ring as he writhed on the ground in pain.
"As for the rest of you, I'm dividing you into three teams. One team will patrol South Kensington, either under a Disillusionment charm or a disguise to not arouse suspicion just in case our unsub resides in the area. The second team will further investigate the places in which the victims were last seen. Report back any and all findings that you may have that may help us in figuring out who the next victim will be or who the criminal is. Finally, the third team will focus on the remaining open cases that we have. Let me know if you need assistance on the more classified ones."
"Why don't you?" the raven questioned softly, and Draco swallowed, eyes flitting away from the other boy.
"You're ill." Potter's voice was loud and clear in the quiet hall, tinged with an almost accusatory tone.
Instead, though, the blonde noted a gentle coolness begin to spread through his head, filling the space behind his eyes and dulling the ache that resided there. Draco released a shuddering breath of relief, tension seeping from his shoulders as another hand came up to gently knead at his temple. He unconsciously leaned into the touch, grey eyes blinking open to find a pair of emerald orbs peering worriedly into his.
Why would Potter even ask something like that? Surely he couldn't be that dense. Why would
Ever since that encounter in the bathroom at the beginning of this year, the taller boy had known something was off with Malfoy. He'd been suspicious, at first, and angry, memories of Sixth Year flooding to the forefront of his mind as he watched the other boy sullenly make his way through classes and nibble at his meals. Hermione kept telling him to leave it alone, let the Aurors handle it for once, but Harry just couldn't shake the feeling for the past few weeks that something was wrong. He'd just never considered that the person in danger would be Malfoy himself.
breathing down his neck without succumbing to the roiling waves of fear washing through him. Alas, he supposed Occlumency shields could only get you so far, and the constant glares and hexes flung at him in the halls had him spiraling down into a sobbing, hyperventilating mess more often than he cared to admit.
"France?" Hermione asked as they were clearing the table. "Well, that makes sense. The Malfoys did originally come from France. But the country is huge. For all we know, he can be anywhere in the globe."
"Thanks, Andy."
"I'm fine," the blond assured him. He then took a deep breath and finally said the thing that has always been at the back of his mind. The thing that he purposefully ignored for a long time but he can't do that now because they're going back to Britain and they should really get this thing out of the way. "Are…are you sure you're happy here?"
"But you know him, don't you? You've met him once before? Do you know others that may know him as well?" He asked, tone becoming just slightly frantic as he clutched on every word and reaction that the Potions Master is giving him. Anything. Anything that will give him more information and nudge him to the right track.
Harry doesn't know what this means. Well, maybe he does know what it meant but for some reason his mind is refusing to process things. Its refusing to connect them and make sense of everything that he's known so far. He's the Head of the Investigation Department, for goodness' sake. It's his job to connect evidences and solve crimes.
"Ah, I see you've met my sister." The witch in front of him commented before tapping the name tag on her uniform. "I'm Claudette. How can I help you today?"
"Exactly but when has the usual or the normal ever applied to you?" He said in an exasperated tone. He then gestured to the Masidec still hanging from Harry's neck. "I figured that it has something to do with that trinket of yours."
"Wow…" The couple breathed out. Harry commissioned an artist to make a magical portrait for the newlyweds. While they did pose for their own portraits, Harry wanted to preserve the memory of their wedding day, where the two brides stood face-to-face in front of the wedding arch, holding each other's hands, and looking at the other with genuine expressions of love and happiness. That's what his two friends are looking at, as of the moment. Their wedding in the eyes of the crowd. Their relationship in a way that their friends saw it. Portrait Pansy looked down on their intertwined hands and looked back up to Portrait Luna's eyes. They were glowing. It's like they're enclosed in their own little bubble. A bubble that no one dared to pop.
"I would need a copy of that, Ms. Parkinson. I would also need a copy of Malfoy's latest bank statements and any receipt that you can find."
Although his determination hasn't wavered, Harry couldn't dedicate a hundred percent of his working hours into looking for Draco. Everyday new cases arrive for him and his fellow Aurors to solve. Some of these cases are easy – they could be solved in a day – while others require focus and months of extensive research. Those cases are the most difficult and, usually, the most dangerous. He barely has enough time to juggle his work as the head of his department with going out with his friends and spending time with his family, especially now that there's only a year left before Teddy goes to Hogwarts. It's not helping that he chose to keep the Malfoy Manor case to himself instead of assigning it to some of his best Aurors. Harry blames his change of heart when it comes to why exactly he's still looking for Draco. In any case, he's juggling all of his responsibilities while trying to keep a sane mind.
"Yeah."
Hermione did give him the report on the Malfoy Manor once the investigation concluded. Draco Malfoy's Ministry regulated wand was also included in the examination. It seems like the Killing Curse was only used to break the regulations set on the wand seeing as it was both dark and powerful. Fiendfyre was used for the obvious reason of setting everything in fire. It's silly but Harry almost let out a sigh of relief once he read the hypothesis on why the Unforgiveable was used. He doesn't know if his elated feeling is from the fact that the blond didn't kill anyone or the implication that he wasn't really trying to take his own life as Parkinson suggested when they first talked. Either way, the Malfoy Manor reports only served to motivate him no matter how long it may take given his duties and responsibilities at work.
Roughly five minutes later, Harry stood in a room similar to where he Flooed from. It was also spacious and completely bare save for the several Floos lined up along the walls. The only difference between this room and the room where he came from is a small table by the door that held several pieces of papers: pamphlets, flyers, and even a map of the hospital that includes all its buildings.
Now that it was confirmed that there is indeed magic at play in this hospital, Harry came to an interesting assumption. It seems like wizards and muggles are working together in this establishment in order to treat muggles from ailments that are usually deadly to them. He's still not sure whether or not the operations of this facility is legal but it seems like it is. It's quite difficult to hide illegal facilities in the middle of the city.
The café itself was quite modern, similar to those commercial coffee shops that Muggles seem to love so much. It had floor-to-ceiling windows that let in the morning sunlight to energize the patrons. However, one part of the wall was lined up with numerous bookshelves that customers can either buy or borrow.
Draco remembered that time too. Sixth year. Potter followed him around everywhere. He held back a wince at the memory of him lying on the bathroom floor, bleeding while Moaning Myrtle screamed bloody murder.
Did Harry get flustered at his little rant there? Perhaps. He [feels] flustered, his neck and cheeks a bit too warm for his liking. He quickly picked up his teacup and drank from it in an attempt to hide his fluster behind the porcelain cup.
"What's that?" She asked, nodding in his direction and pointing to her own chest. She had a pair of goggles on. Its lenses were similar to camera lenses that could zoom in and out.
The Auror braced himself and went inside.
"I'm here to see Healer Vartan." He told the wizard behind the desk who seemed to be quite busy writing down things on a piece of paper.
"Who would've thought, right?" Ginny commented, nudging Harry's side. He only let out a chuckle in response, too entranced by the beautiful scene in front of him. The two brides faced each other with joined hands.
"The Killing Curse."
If he's being perfectly honest with himself, nothing much is keeping him from resigning from his position and quitting the Auror force altogether. He's only keeping his job because it's what is expected of him, he doesn't really know what to do with his life otherwise, and he's still as determined as ever to track down Draco Malfoy, wherever that git is.
The raven offered an apologetic smile. "Sorry. I should have thought about how you might react to waking up in a unfamiliar place."
Merlin knows he deserved it
ended well for either party. As the other man continued to sob and whimper before him, though, Harry knew he had to do
The panic attacks had come as a bit of a surprise, if he was honest. After all, he'd managed to go an entire year with
The water tasted sweet and cold, oddly refreshing, and, really, Draco should've figured that Potter would excel even at something as simple as an Aguamenti. "Why're you doing this?" he asked suddenly, eyes wide and startlingly clear as he looked up at the raven-haired man.
Steeling himself, he scooched forward to sit parallel to shuddering blonde and, sending a quick prayer up to Godric that Malfoy wouldn't hex his balls off for what he was about to do, tugged the smaller boy into his lap. Malfoy gasped at the sudden motion, immediately sending him spiraling into a coughing fit, and all Harry could think was
Draco froze, mind whirling as he tried to process what was going on. Potter was...
If possible, the other boy's blush deepened even further, and he brought a hand to sheepishly rub at his neck. "I wanted to make sure you'd be okay," he mumbled, looking uncharacteristically shy.
That bitch from Ravenclaw still wouldn't leave him the fuck alone, either. Every time he stepped out around a corner in the hallways, it was like she was waiting for him, shining stream of new curses lined up at the ready. It was getting bloody annoying, at this point.
He grimaced, lowering his hand with a wordless Scourgify and turned back to find Potter gazing at him with an indistinguishable expression on his face.
"So you brought me to your rooms," the blonde deadpanned.
they're
So lost in his fever-induced haze, he didn't even notice a tall, dark form peel away from the shadows of the one of the alcoves he passed until he was being being slammed back against the wall of the passage, head cracking painfully on the cold stones as he stared into the enraged face of one green-eyed Saviour.
It was during one such trek a few days later that his body finally seemed to decide it'd had enough—a sudden dizzy spell on his way to Herbology had him sagging against the wall of some obscure part of the castle before slowly slumping to the ground, upon which his quivering limbs refused to do anything other than curl into a tight ball. He knew, on some level, that he should probably be concerned for his health, or at the very least the classes he was missing, but he couldn't really bring himself to care. He sighed, thankful at least that some of his other symptoms had backed off a bit since the whole Potter incident.
There was a rustling sound from somewhere to his left, and instantly the pale boy stilled, all traces of sleep vanished from his body as realized he wasn't alone. Slowly, he reached a hand beneath his pillow (which smelled weirdly good, for some reason) for his wand, but his fingers closed around empty air. His pulse spiked.
With that in mind, he carefully gathered the blonde against his chest and pushed to his feet, frowning at the lightness of the other boy. Malfoy groaned at the sudden change in elevation, his head falling against Harry's shoulder as silent tears continued to run down his face. The taller man sighed at the intense heat he felt still pouring from Malfoy's overly-warm body, and quickly began to making his way down the corridor towards his private rooms.
"Dragons can be as harmful as Dark Lords though…" Harry mumbled, earning him a slap on the arm from Draco.
One of the unfamiliar faces, a middle-aged man with a shock of electric blue hair, stood up and addressed the others in the room.
"Very well," Robards said, directing everyone's attention to him. "Obliviator Charles, I would like to assign a couple of my Aurors to your department in preparation for the likely scenario that we find other…parts. For now, we are hoping that the culprit made more than one mistake. I do believe that if – and this is only an 'if' – they did the same to the rest of Mr. Quinn's body, not all of them will be placed near Muggle objects that can interfere its spellwork.
But this right here, being in Draco's arms in their house in France despire being a thousand miles away from their family and friends, this actually feels like home.
The next day found Harry standing in front of The Quibbler's office that stood in the less crowded part of Diagon Alley. After the war, people started to take The Quibbler more seriously seeing as they never swayed from the truth. Published eccentric articles? Yes. But slander? Outright lies? The publication now headed by Luna Lovegood has a clean slate. Not to mention its reputation for not caring about which side of the war their staff fought for. Thus, Harry was only slightly surprised when he found out that Pansy Parkinson worked here, as their publisher nonetheless.
If Malfoy accepts the job he won't be Harry's editor anymore. That's just impossible. Malfoy wouldn't have the time.
"What made you think I was unhappy? Why did you tell me to control my own life?"
Harry knew that he wasn't particularly powerful. His mind flashed back to the final battle between him and Voldemort. He admits that their connection helped in the latter's defeat but it ultimately comes down to Malfoy. Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore in the Astronomy tower back in sixth year, switching the loyalty of the Elder wand to him. Harry took Malfoy's wand in the Manor. Malfoy took it back while they were in the Room of Requirement. Finally, Malfoy tossed his wand to Harry during the final battle, switching back the allegiance of the Elder wand to him which allowed him to survive the duel with Voldemort and to come out triumphant. The Elder wand cannot harm the person to which it is allied to. If Harry had used Hermione's wand, for example, there's no telling what the outcome of the battle could have been.
"Ron said," Angelina spoke as she finally took pity on Harry, letting him in on whatever secret that the Weasley brothers have. "That you have developed an itty-bitty crush on Malfoy. That's why you get all weird and flustered whenever he's mentioned."
"Where's the medicine from?"
"Julia, right?" He suddenly spoke up just as the waitress was about to walk away. Julia eyed him warily but nodded. The light of the pendant remained a faint baby blue which meant the culprit was still in the same position that they were in when the two Aurors first entered. This also meant that the culprit wasn't Julia. George added a rune to the Masidec that will allow it to glow brighter if the person to which the magic belongs to comes nearer. With the presence of the strange woman in the pub, Harry didn't think that the amulet is malfunctioning now but they still had to make sure so he quietly asked Julia about her. "Does that woman come here often? Don't look at her-- She looks quite disturbed, doesn't she?"
"So, you also live here?" Ron asked. "What, like above the pub?"
"Sure, no problem! When will that be?"
"I declined the offer."
"Auror Weasley," Robards spoke still staring at the object on the table. "Do you think the device you're working on can handle Dark Magic?"
In short, Potter looked good and Draco is having a hard time controlling the feelings that he thought he has long buried.
"We have it here with us. Head Auror Robards suspects that the arm belongs to one of the missing wizards." Charles said as one of his co-workers levitated a parcel wrapped in parchment paper to the middle of the table. "We placed it under a stasis charm to control the odour and decay."
It has been so long since Draco uttered his own name. The last time he said it his voice was filled with hatred as he wanted nothing more than to erase his own existence. However, as he sat in the middle of France, five years after he decided to start anew, he found it easier to speak the name his mother gave him out loud and to, once again, claim it as his own.
"Morning. Sorry, I'm late." Harry begrudgingly greeted as he walked into Conference Room #3 of the Auror department, hair still slightly damp from the shower that he took before going to work. Head Auror Robards sent them urgent owls that morning, requesting for their presence at the meeting regarding the "Missing Wizards Case" that has been giving them a headache for the past few weeks
"Sure about what?"
A stranger whose face gave him an odd sense of familiarity, whose voice was also familiar but different at the same time.
"Why are you here?"
The thought is a little disturbing but it nevertheless brought a small smile on his face.
"Yes. I would also need a copy of them for the investigation."
(See the end of the chapter for
"But I had a Firebolt back at Hogwarts too. Teddy will crush every game with it!"
By the end of her tirade, the trio were sporting varying degrees of shock and guilt on their faces. The former Slytherin revelled in their expressions despite knowing that Draco wouldn't have wanted her to spill his secrets in broad daylight but the proud and righteous Gryffindors needed to hear it. They needed to hear that they wouldn't have survived and triumphed over their challenges without Draco's help, without the help of the "evil Slytherin git" that they hate.
"I'm gonna miss that git." Those were Harry's thoughts, a hundred percent sure that Malfoy will accept the offer. Why wouldn't he? Being a Hogwarts professor will bring him closer to what he really wants compared to being Harry's editor and "glorified assistant". He thinks about how much he's going to miss the way Malfoy strides into his house like he owns it, how Malfoy knows exactly what Harry needs whenever he's having a particularly difficult time with a certain chapter (black coffee laced with firewhiskey), how Malfoy will sometimes crash on Harry's couch because he's taking too long to finish his drafts…
Harry looked around and saw a number of restaurants and shops that surrounded the square. He was tempted to grab a quick bite before heading over to where he was supposed to go but, once again, he pushed down the gnawing feeling of hunger and walked towards one of the streets to Adhil Blanchett's house.
Harry feels only slightly uncomfortable in his steel grey dress robes as he walked the unfamiliar path to a spacious garden. He didn't have the time to go to Madam Malkin's for his robe fittings. He has only been there twice and he knows he probably should've tried harder to attend the appointments but he was just too busy so now he has to endure the slight tightness around his neck and chest area. Harry made sure to check himself in the mirror and he didn't that look bad. That's why he just shrugged and apparated to the wedding venue.
"Draco?" He called out from the foyer.
Potter shrugged.
Apparently, Malfoy did more than just take money and transfer the rest to Parkinson. He did so much more than that and, as much as Harry believes that no amount of money can make up for the mistakes of the past, he truly appreciates the thought behind them.
"What's this place called then? Maybe some dodgy place that use voodoo magic or some shit."
The man that Geneva hit with the Entrail-Expelling Curse is the boyfriend of the girl who squealed. They were genuinely just joking around but Geneva saw it differently and thought it necessary to attack.
"Adhil!" A spritely female voice called out. The two wizards turned around to see a petite woman with a pixie cut standing by the entrance while holding a small paper bag. She stopped in her tracks as she realized that there was another person in the shop. "Oh! Bonjour, monsieur! Puis-je vous aider?"
Pansy picked up Daphne and Millicent's gift for them and handed it over for Luna to open. Their gift turned out to be a copy of "McAllister's Legendary Guide to Dragons, Nundus, Chimaeras, and other Deadly Creatures", a rare book on the most dangerous and magnificent of magical creatures. It is rumored that there are only seven copies of the said book in existence. Daphne and Millicent must have paid a fortune for that certain copy.
Last night, Harry sent an owl to Healer Vartan asking if Adhil has an establishment of his own, an apothecary or a potions shop. The Healer responded just this morning with a simple address written on a small piece of paper along with a note that simply says:
"Draco did this with a Ministry regulated wand, in seconds, and then apparated away without one. Imagine what he could have done throughout the war, good or bad, had he actually tried."
"You have Hermione to thank for that," Ron said with a chuckle as he leaned over the work table to further inspect the amulet. "She's the one who proposed the entire thing to the Head of the Department of Mysteries and she also convinced them to let us borrow their research notes on magical signatures."
It was a nice single story house located in Falmouth, just a little further away from Ottery St. Catchpole. After their wedding last year, Ron and Hermione decided to move into a new house. They didn't want to be in the same wizarding village as the rest of the family but they didn't want to be too far away from them either.
"Has the fire been estinguished yet? What about the occupants of the house?" Harry asked, moving towards the open gates. He half-expected to be thrown out or maimed the moment he stepped through but alas, he only felt a weak ripple hit his body. The wards must have been destroyed as well. It makes sense since the aurors wouldn't be able to investigate otherwise. Harry quickly read through the case file before apparating here. Roughly an hour and a half ago, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was alerted to a massive explosion in Wiltshire, specifically in Malfoy Manor. Alarms monitoring the property went off prompting the aurors to rush here.
"Huh? Told him what?" Harry asked, looking between Ron and George in confusion. The two exchanged amused looks as he waited for anyone to answer.
It was a week later when the tables have finally turned.
Her office was simple, something that one would expect an office would be except for the fact that there are definite touches of "Pansy Parkinson" all over the room. There's the emerald green wallpaper and the elegant green and gold carpet laid down in the middle of the wooden floor. Her deep mahogany desk held certain items like an elegant paperweight that held a preserved gladiolus flower inside, and atleast three expensive looking quills next to a glass ink bottle.
Five years.
Joseph and Julia both had shocked looks on their faces but they were sensible enough to take out their own wands and protect their patrons.
"Is that…" Hermione began, cheeks flushed. She coughed as Luna held up the item to inspect it before drinking deeply from her wine glass.
Draco let out a chuckle as he imagined the petite blond woman dragging a hundred pound winged-foal out of its mother.
"Huh…" Harry muttered under his breath. He supposes that only witches and wizards can see that fine print. That must be what the wards were for, detecting if someone is or isn't magical. It was a clever thing really.
Harry took Ron's absence as an opportunity to look around at the patrons in the pub. He picked up the pint of beer that was set in front of him and drank from it, his eyes peering from the rim of the glass as he carefully scanned the place.
Harry was just about to get up and have another dose of the polyjuice potion when it happened.
"Sorry I took so long, mate," He apologized, looking sheepish and a bit out of breath. "The streets are packed with Muggles. I had to find a relatively quiet place to send the patronus."
"Then don't." Draco said, looking at him straight in the eye. "At the end of the day, it all comes down to you and your decision. You have to stop letting expectations dictate your life, Potter. You'll be happier. Start doing whatever the fuck you want to do. At this time, take a page out of MY books."
Severus said nothing but he was surprised enough that he closed his book in favour of listening attentively to what Adhil was about to say.
"Let me guess… American?" Ron teased with a wink making Joseph laugh and shrug.
When the Auror spoke, it was in a pleading tone.
The woman continued to fire curses at them but her actions are starting to falter. They weren't as smooth and as quick as they initially were. She's starting to get worn out. Harry and Ron could clearly see this. Offensive spells, especially if they're dark and have the intent of maiming or killing someone, are much more taxing to cast than defensive ones.
"Why do care about my happiness, anyways?!" Harry's loud voice echoed around the decently sized kitchen. "Why do you care if I'm satisfied with my job or if I'm doing shit just because other people expect me to?
The Auror could feel his head starting to throb. It feels like he's standing in front of a locked door and he's forgotten where he put the key. The answer is right in front of him but something is blocking it.
"Hmm?" His boyfriend said around another mouthful of biscuits, looking up from the stack of papers that he was going through.
"Hmm…" Vartan hummed thoughtfully, finishing the last bites of their lunch. They wiped the corners of their mouth before leaning back on the chair and looking at Harry with a calculating look. "Why now and why here?"
"Besides, the pouch was found on the mantlepiece." Ginny added, speaking for the first time since Harry saw the gift from Draco.
"He didn't have a choice--" Harry continued to argue. He doesn't have any idea what Ron and Hermione are trying to say here. "Voldemort was going to kill his family if he didn't do it. And I told you that he lowered his wand that night. I know for a fact that he doesn't want to kill Dumbledore. I was there."
Thank you so much for reading and I hope you're enjoying this so far! 💖
"Keep the Muggles where they are! Don't let any of them leave for now!" Harry told her, ducking from another stunner. He knows full well that the Obliviators need to handle these Muggles. He didn't plan on having an all out battle in the middle of the pub, amongst these Muggles but the culprit seemed to have lost what little sanity she has left and have foregone any subtlety that was evident from her past actions.
Later that evening, Harry and Ron are back at 'The Crystal' polyjuiced as different Muggles. This time, they sat by the bar and ordered pints of beer from Joseph, the bartender.
"Yeah," Ron agreed. "A witch and a wizard working in a place where two of our victims often go to. Maybe we should do a stakeout, either at The Crystal or at their house."
When Harry arrived home, an intimidating looking owl was waiting for him. It didn't look like a Barn owl, it was too gray to be a Snowy owl, and it lacked the horns of a Great Horned owl. He wasn't that well-versed when it comes to owl species so he just shrugged and took the large, thick-looking envelope that the owl brought him. It did't seem to expect a reply seeing as it flew right out the window, which Harry understood since he has an idea about who the owl is from.
"What?"
There was silence for a few moments. It was then followed by muffled voice and footsteps on a hardwood floor. Another moment of silence. It was longer this time.
"Hey, Georgie." Ron greeted, grabbing two of the spare goggles from the shelf and handing one to Harry, saying that it would protect his eyes from any flying parts or erratic magic. "How's it going?"
"Parkinson." Harry greeted just as formally, taking a seat in front of the former Slytherin's desk.
As if on cue, Ron let out a huge yawn. He has been on night patrols for the past week. That along with making sure the Masidec works is bound to take a toll on him.
Harry let out a huff followed by a sigh. He didn't have the time nor the patience for this.
"I…stopped by to give you my manuscript? At 8AM? Because that's what you said last night?"
Hi! I'm so sorry for ending this chapter on a cliffhanger. I had an outline for this but the chapter got too long so I had to split the outline so this fic will probably be a 5-6 chaptered fic. 😅
"Pansy told me that he just went and filed for a week long leave. Which means, if he does figure who I am, he doesn't have the authority to drag me back to Britain."
"Potter?"
"Same thing," Harry shrugged. "And here I am, following heart and doing what I want."
They were all daffodils.
"I now pronounce you bonded!" The Ministry official waved his wand over the newlyweds. A shower of golden shimmer and what looked to be little twinkling stars fell over the top of their heads and disappeared as if absorbed by their skin. In an act that surprised everyone and no one at the same time, Luna flung herself into the arms of her wife and kissed her. Luckily, Pansy seemed to anticipate it because her firm footing didn't falter as she wrapped her arms around Luna and kissed her back. Everyone rose from their seats and gave the newlyweds an enthusiastic round of applause. Wolf whistles were heard from Blaise, George, and Seamus. Harry clapped his hands in genuine happiness, not just for the lovely  couple standing by the wedding arch but also for the air of camaraderie between their groups of friends that seemed to have flourished from their relationship.
"But how could he?" Hermione broke the awkward silence that was starting to form. "Without a proper wand, the best he could get away with are just cleaning charms."
Adhil, on the other hand, is an enigma. He's a young Potions Master who seems to dedicate his life on potions and the improvement of both Magical and Muggle medicine. Harry doesn't know who he is, where he came from, his family background, or anything else outside the title of "Potions Master". But Harry could tell that he's passionate. The way Adhil's eyes lit up while he was answering all of Harry's potion related questions brought a smile to the Auror's lips. He exudes the energy of a man who is content with his life. Someone who has found his calling and is living every single day doing what he loves.
The Gryffindors and Ravenclaw in question just laughed at her antics before they all pulled away and made their way over to the dining room.
