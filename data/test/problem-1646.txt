Pansy, without taking her eyes off Potter, was first to speak. “Draco. How nice of you to join our little party.”
“I would like to have a drink with you, not at work. I don’t want to keep you a secret, I know people will object. I think – I hope – that the people close to me won’t be among them. And yes, you’re right, the other stuff was brilliant, but it turns out that you’re good at other things too and that, well,” he pauses for breath, “that I like you.”
Harry bit his lip and looked from Draco’s cock to his eyes again, and raised an inquisitive eyebrow.
There was a room with more blobs, and maybe it was his own distraction, or that they seemed so flat compared to the room, but Harry didn’t know how so many artists could be so preoccupied with painting lumps and splatters. There was a room with more blobby statues. The idea of carving the blobs seemed even more absurd to Harry than did the idea of painting them. A room full of pictures that seemed like they were supposed to be visual puns caught his attention for a while, but he couldn’t help feeling a bit furtive about it; he was pretty sure that fine art wasn’t meant to be taken as a dirty joke.
Potter entered with all the hesitation Draco was determined not to show. He half-crept over the threshold and forward on the rug, eventually slinking into one of Draco's chairs.
The boy-turned-man who crawls onto the mattress beside him, pressing a warm palm against his temple to check for injuries.
“Though why you’d expect otherwise when the Ministry still operates with carrier pigeons’ slower, surlier cousins, I don’t know.”
Harry laughed, saw Malfoy cast a sharp glance in his direction, and bit his lip to keep from losing all professionalism. “Can’t disagree with your assessment. Too bad I have to stay until they’ve weaved their way out of the building.”
His meeting with Robards, however, cuts right through his pleasant haze, replaces his memories of early summer mornings with the cold grey Ministry office walls in ways that cut far deeper than the literal.
An echo sounded through the room as he took a tentative step. Harry reached out for another light, and then another, and another, and another, and then another, and startled when his fingers touched icy glass. A split second later he realised he was seeing his own hand reflected back to him. A mirror.
“Okay.” Draco tried to keep his voice even, if only because he didn’t want it to be Harry’s deciding factor. And he had the feeling he’d be free to break down soon enough.
“Fuck off,” Potter said, so low under his breath that Draco could elect to ignore it. Then, louder, “Who knows how you arranged things, with your stupid bespoke security plans? Maybe the door opens out!”
Draco used his wand to lift them, turning them in the air between the two of them. “Monkshood. And petunias?”
Wardwell raised the same inquiring eyebrow at Robards that Draco had felt so acutely moments before.
It is, Draco will concede, an impressive performance. Convincing. So engaging that people have begun to leave before he even realises the night is drawing to a close, and it will hardly be a complete mission if no one is left to see them leave together.
Harry looked up and caught Malfoy's eye and realised, with some relief, that Malfoy felt the strain of staying calm as entirely as Harry did. "Because I want to know if you want to do it again."
“Time, yeah.” He hesitated. “How do you feel about Side-Alonging me to Gare du Nord? Not that familiar yet, and tired, to boot.”
You don’t get it, but you can watch it. He moves with grace, with them, on them. He is in the beat too, but it is not in him. He owns it (like he used to, like he was made to own it all). He makes it his with each turn of a hip, the roll of his neck, the hand on a chest. The way he drags his palms up a strange man’s arse and throws back his head and laughs.
“You’re welcome.” Another few seconds’ silence. Draco felt tension, but suspected it was him alone. “Are you sure you wouldn’t benefit from a drink or something to eat?”
As they turned away from the bar Draco glanced over the crowd, with its smattering of familiar faces and the unmissable sea of ginger at the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes table. But Draco’s eyes were drawn to Harry almost immediately, and he suspected he wasn’t the only one for whom that was true. Harry managed to radiate a calm, charismatic confidence in these situations that drew people toward him in droves. But to someone who knew him, his smile looked a bit worn. He saw Harry’s eyes flit towards him for a split second and then, as Draco watched, Harry itched the side of his neck and pulled on his earlobe.
Harry’s mouth quirks into a smile and his hands move to his waistband. He unbuttons the single button, revealing the laces beneath. He’s done them up properly. Habit. Even in the middle of a snit, Draco thinks he would’ve done the same.
Malfoy is clearly put out. “This huge collection of bizarre household items is exactly in line with the list you provided. Perhaps you’re confused by seeing your things arranged in some semblance of order.”
“Er?” Higsbee furrows his brow. “No, sir. None of us in Fashion and Lifestyle can, and if it’s a private citizen or someone with business interests…” He trails off at Draco’s glare. “I – should we be able to?”
“Excellent. Quidditch begins in fifteen minutes and will minimise the possibility of unwelcome student interruptions. The game may take some time in weather like this – hopefully Bellweather will keep his head on straight regardless, that child… In any event, Miss Granger will cast all the necessary repelling charms just in case. Malfoy, Potter, you are to send me a Patronus
Draco’s fingers itched to touch. He held himself still. “Aren’t you tired of running?” He almost wished he hadn’t spoken. His voice had felt like thunder, roiling the quiet. Inviting the deluge.
“Right.” Potter inhaled and closed his eyes. He opened them again with an exhale, and focused his attention on the tip of his wand. “
estate. The original gift from William the Conqueror. Our ancestral home. It belongs to us more entirely than any of the others, and Pansy knows it. They all know it.
“Yes. They…the work they do, their devotion to it. I had no idea. I’d only ever learned that they were useless and selfish and noxious and violent. I grew up hearing stories about how they’d tried to burn us and hang us and drown us, and how they’d done all those things to each other in the process. I’d…It should have, but it never occurred to me that they could do this, too, or that they’d want to.” He’d said these things, thought these things, often enough that the words organised themselves easily. “After the war—during the war—I started to wonder why anyone would fight to defend them, would be willing to die to defend them, if those stories were true. And I thought—I heard, and it was easiest to believe—that maybe their defenders were just like they were. That the Order, that everyone on that side, was as stupid and violent and selfish as Muggles.
“You, being ever the reckless Gryffindor, kissed me in front of four of the most astute people in the Ministry’s employ. Do you think they would’ve believed it if I said it was an inexplicable, impulsive fluke?”
After upending his life, moving to Paris, and learning to navigate academic politics, Draco had almost thought he could get used to anything. Lacking answers, and being without a firm plan for finding them, was testing that theory. Particularly since everything he’d been able to come up with overnight was proving fruitless.
But of course Potter made that hypothetical adolescent troll look like a gentleman scholar. Maybe that had been Draco’s mistake, to expect that Potter would have even a passing interest in books.
“Physical anatomy. You’re talking physical anatomy as though it exists in a vacuum! What about magical anatomy? Do you know what it would do to put that next to his spine? Align the Elder Wand with a central passage for transmission of magical impulses?”
He turns. Draco’s throat is painfully tight. He’s sure he couldn’t speak even if he had something to say.
The room was massive and, Harry felt, rather too bright. With its cavernous ceilings and glaringly white walls and sparkling floor and rows and rows of lights, there was nowhere to hide. Nowhere to look, even.
“No.” Potter throws his hands up. “Of course not. I get it. You don’t care. You don’t give a Skrewt’s arse what I do. I can fuck anyone at all. I could go fuck Lee Jordan and Luna Lovegood at the same time for all you care, as long as your paper gets the exclusive. Look me in the eye, Draco, and tell me that’s true.”
“Does that mean that you could but would rather not, or that you could but only in an emergency situation?”
“Since Mistress and Master found it after dinner! First we is making up the grey rooms for Master Greg and the red rooms for Mistress Pansy, then we is melting the ices in tiny, tiny pieces.”
It followed him home, too. He didn't stop for a drink. He barely ate. He nearly stubbed a toe pacing in front of the hearth and was moments away from calling Millie and demanding answers when his fireplace leapt to life.
“Want,” he said. Just, “Want.” He took a moment more to catch his breath, and then. “Are you close? I want more, want to feel you.”
The blade scrapes against the shelf. He doesn’t want to let go of it, not in the middle of a job. He has work to do and it makes a hell of a lot more sense than Potter’s strange confessions. “Forged by—”
“Furthermore, I realise the blind was pushing the boundaries of our agreement and, while you didn’t strictly fulfil the terms of our agreement either, inasmuch as the press was rather marred by scandal, it was a dishonourable business practise and one that is inconsistent with the high standards we set here at the
“So I told them we hadn’t wanted to register our intradepartmental relationship with Wizard Resources lest it leak to the press, particularly when we’d never worked together and had had no chance of a conflict of interest until this case. That we’d been weighing how best to tell them and that, in your excitement, you’d likely forgotten that—”
Draco shakes his head to clear it. When he turns around Potter’s still on one knee, looking up at him expectantly, and he almost chokes at the images that come to him, none of which he can afford to entertain. “What?”
Draco runs a hand over Potter’s shoulder and down his arm, to twine their fingers together. “The least I can do is thank you with a drink. And I see Robards is already at the bar. After all the wonderful things you’ve said, I’m simply dying to make his acquaintance.” He turns faux-pleading eyes on Potter. “Does your kindness extend to making introductions?”
It’s bright outside, and getting brighter, the morning dew just beginning to be cut by what promises to be an unusually sunny day. Bright enough that Harry knows it must be time—Draco’s muffled protestations aside—for them to go to work.
really quiet. Like a cat, almost, walking silently everywhere he goes, which has always been a mystery to Harry, not that he’s noticed.
Draco exhales and it practically echoes in the silence. He wonders if this is how Potter breaks suspects, leaving them to stew in the morass of their own thoughts.
“Harry, please.” It was Granger’s turn to interrupt, apparently. “It feels like ages, and we’ve been wanting you to, you know, get out more, and we do worry.”
The smile vanished immediately. Shacklebolt sat in his desk chair, massaging his temples. Croaker and Robards were perched on opposite corners of his desk, clearly awaiting Draco’s arrival.
“Granger,” Draco replied. He turned to Weasley. “Would you please try, or allow me to try, opening the doors manually?”
The wave of nausea that hits him is overwhelming. He doesn’t ask for the fruit, or the cream, or the tea, or anything at all. He doesn’t even—can’t even—ask for words, though he seems to have forgotten all of his. He’s silent even when Blaise claps him on the back and Pansy kisses him on the head and whispers, “Three days. We’re a Floo call away if you need us,” before they step into the hearth and disappear.
Harry doesn’t verbalise his response, just sinks down onto Draco’s cock. The salty tang at the back of his throat may be new but it’s not unwelcome, nor is the thick heat that fills his mouth.
Potter doesn’t answer. He smiles tightly, grabs the Floo powder, throws it into the flames, announces the address, and disappears.
Malfoy’s teeth against his neck. Malfoy’s arms in his hands. The search for Malfoy’s lips. Finding them open, and the thrill of Malfoy’s tongue against his own. The taste of him. The shocking satin of the skin just above his waistband.
“Let them wonder,” Draco replies. “Tell them it’s a mandate from on high and I want it in the early edition.”
Draco walks him through it, surprised by Potter’s enthusiasm for learning something new. Of course, the only bottle he really gets excited about is a cheap, half-empty bottle of Firewhisky of a sort that he claims his godfather had liked to share with Remus Lupin. Still, he seems impressed with Draco’s knowledge, which Draco resolutely refuses to be moved by. Even if Potter’s excitement threatens to be contagious. Even when Potter asks him if there’s anything he’d like to try, which, if he’s entirely honest, when it comes to a 1933 Ogden’s French Oak-Aged Single Malt, he would. Not that he’ll tell Potter that.
Curiosity, perhaps? But what about? Draco is aware that he's reasonably attractive. He has no trouble pulling on the rare occasions when he tries to. His partners are generally far more interested in a repeat performance than he is, and who knows what animates the Golden Boy’s fantasies? But if that is the nature of Potter’s interest, why the vanishing act? The repeated vanishing act? Even by Potter’s standards, it's inexplicable.
By the time he’d arranged the necessary spellwork and made his way around the building, it was exactly as he’d hoped. Potter was kneeling in the hay, watching the kittens and, after a minute, he reached a tentative finger out to trace the line of their ribs. When they stretched into the touch, he smiled and settled back into the hay.
“No. No,” Potter repeated. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you fucking dare. What was your grand plan? Hand me over to Voldemort? Kill me yourself?”
“So you see, Harry, Edgar is quite all right. I’ve seen him, and we only thought of Draco in the first place because he’s the best at what he does. Quite caring with the animals, and very dedicated to the cause of conservation, magical and Muggle. Edgar is in good hands.”
“Mmm,” Harry confirmed. With a shuddering breath he moved his hand onto Draco’s and slid it back to his cock. “Really good.”
The clasp is getting a bit maddening. He turns his back to Potter and squints down to figure out why it won’t catch.
He knows what he wants and it definitely can’t be the hardness of Draco’s body, or the way his jaw smells like aftershave, or the hint of stubble that burned when Harry kissed him so hard their teeth bumped together. It’s not romantic. It’s not nice. It’s not for him and that’s all there is to it and it’s a good thing, a really good thing, that a few days have passed and they can just forget about it.
I nodded. Hooked my fingers into his waistband and pulled it away and down. He was full and flushed a deep pink, and bobbed away from his body and towards my mouth. There was already a strand dripping from the tip, threatening to fall into the nest of unruly dark curls at the base.
“Alright. Though if you’re going to make exceptions, figure I might as well make it worth your while.”
Jealousy crashes over Draco, blood pounding in his ears. He had been right, then. There is someone. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries, silently, to regain his breath. He can’t reveal himself, not now.
It won’t take much imagination to guess how we first fell into something more than a working relationship. Two more nights of painting the town, of confused, longing looks followed by disciplined self-correction. A climactic moment—footsteps approaching, the two of us forced to take cover, pressed together in an alcove, our bodies a hair’s breadth apart, his breath ghosting, sweet and cold, across my lips. The same look he’d been directing my way recreated without the benefit of distance. Our heads leaning in, his bottom lip dragging over mine, finally capturing my mouth in a kiss that left his glasses fogged and my heart racing. His hands, ice cold, pulling an uncharacteristically graceless yelp from my throat as he slipped them into my waistband. We came, gasping silently, in each other’s hands. Then we returned to work.
“Good. As you know, I start from the assumption that you respond to strong emotional stimuli. The most obvious seem to be negative. Frustration, sadness, anger, anxiety—emotions that come easily and create destructive magic.”
“We have several tasks to accomplish today. We’ll start with musical instruments and then knickknacks. Grocery and liquor will follow, then we’ll finish with portraits, photos, and tapestries.”
“You, however, are never without a wand, and an exceptionally powerful and temperamental wand at that. Granger and Croaker thought it would act like an implant. They were wrong. It’s a wand, and it acts like a wand. Implanted in your body, it responds to magical stimuli beyond those you consciously intend to project. But I don’t believe it’s malfunctioning.”
Something welled up in his chest. He could imagine that the room might have been full, once. People might have had merry dinners around the sort of table that could’ve fit inside. They, whoever they were, might’ve filled the room with light and sound and warmth. But all of it was gone; it was a room he couldn’t enter.
“True, but that was the question I had in mind. I assume the answer isn’t ‘peppermints,’ especially if they’re not all they’re cracked up to be.”
“They deserved what they got. They deserved worse; the only reason they didn’t get it was the ban on the Kiss. Then they were in Azkaban, and it was because the same people they’d said all of these terrible things about were merciful in a way that my parents would never have been. Even to me. That I wasn’t in Azkaban for longer than a year, that the Ministry didn’t break my wand or take all of the money, or the only home I’d ever known…” Draco’s throat tightened. He couldn’t go down that road with Potter, even if it felt like cowardice.
“I’ve got new ones.” Harry thinks of the crisp linens upstairs, about which he had, if he’s honest with himself, been secretly optimistic.
“Hmmm.” She took him by the arm and started walking again, down the boardwalk and deeper into the preserve than he’d yet gone. “As best Draco can tell, Edgar was—”
They rounded the corner to Draco’s street. “It wouldn’t have to, depending on how you feel about the train.”
“Oh?” Draco turns his back, focusing all of his attention on the black satin napkin he’s folding and none of it on Potter’s advancing footsteps or the warm hand on his waist or the traces of Potter that linger along his gums.
Prippa nodded seriously, her enormous eyes still threatening to run over. “Master’s guest is in the West Wing, sir. Lobsey is seeing to Master’s guest, even though he must walk many times a day, Master, sir.”
Dean hummed next to her. “Yeah, I reckon so. Drew a few of these down the shore in Norfolk this summer.”
“Both of them,” Draco said, and Potter did look surprised then. Draco could imagine why. He’d read the stories in the press, assuming his father was cold and heartless but his mother was a secretly kind, loving, impartial casualty. He’d wished on more than one occasion that he’d had the mother he read about in the
Not that he’s a vindictive person. He isn’t. Or at least much less of one nowadays. But if you’ve got to be relegated to a sub-sub-Basement and tasked with sorting the detritus of the wizarding world’s tendency to Vanish first and think later, you’ve got to take your pleasures as they come. And your opportunities.
He can feel his own heart pounding, but it’s the increasingly rapid rise and fall of Draco’s chest that gives him hope. He nips at Draco’s earlobe and has to repress a victorious smile when he feels Draco shiver against him.
“I’m sorry,” Draco repeated. “There’s no reason you’d know that. It’s not as though they cover agriculture at Hogwarts. Do they in Muggle school?”
!” Draco was out of his seat, wand in hand, only a second before Granger, who cast the same spell a moment later. Debris hit the shields and scattered to the corners of the room.
It seemed to work. Malfoy turned to him, slowly, his face ashen. “You should know.” He nodded towards the wall. “You did the paperwork.”
In short, it worked. No matter the wand wood or the core, no matter the sourcing, no matter the illness. It worked.
He nods. “Yeah. Do it.” It’s breathy and uneven, but he looks at me with such fire. “Fuck me, Malfoy.”
“You have others.” Potter gestured to the two chairs on the opposite side of Draco’s desk. Uncomfortable by design, for visitors. Which Draco was not.
He stops to consider the wording. He’s got to really sell this in order to do away with the idea of him and Potter. To regain a little peace and order in his life. He starts a draft, crosses it out, starts again, sends it to the bin, starts again. He’s vaguely aware that Higsbee’s doing an uncharacteristically good job of staying still.
It all started to feel so mad so quickly that when an owl did alight on a fencepost in front of him, Harry figured it couldn’t be for him.
I ask you, also, to consider the means by which this law is to be enacted after the initial drive to register. Imagine, if you will, your own Sorting.” He laughed softly and shared a smile with Susan Bones. “Several among your number will remember mine. I certainly do. Sitting on the Great Lake as the castle loomed into view. Entering those doors for the first time—how huge they seemed then!” He laughed again and lowered his voice conspiratorially. “I could hardly imagine them opening or closing at the time.
Draco looked over at Potter. He still had colour from running, tiny beads of sweat were still drying along his hairline. But he didn’t look especially perturbed about the revelation that his doctors might have caused him long-term harm. It was disconcerting, even more deeply than his general, near-compulsive, dedication to amiability. “I’ve said it before, but you can ask questions if you’d like.”
“You don’t know Dupioni silk runners from lace napkins, you have no idea where to look for signs of ownership, and you almost certainly don’t know anything about how these items should be used after their retrieval. There’s really no reason to stay.”
Draco froze. He knew with total certainty that he needed to move. Needed to say something. Needed to put his hand back on Harry’s knee, or remind him that he was leaving in two days’ time, or both. Needed to give him a Hippogriff. He couldn’t. Couldn’t so much as wiggle a toe.
Mondays are a particularly ripe time for it, with all the photographs from the weekends’ events developed and ready for perusal. It doesn’t hurt that Draco has trained the head of Fashion and Lifestyle to bring him only those items that might require special editorial consideration. Which is to say, the really salacious bits.
They stood there, Potter looking at him and Draco looking back. Draco wondered if he should leave. Abandon ship before it took an inevitable turn for the worse. Leave Potter to his private joy.
When I went in there, before I even started speaking, she said Harry had told her to expect me. Had left a Portkey and an address. Had told her I was helping him with a postwar rebuilding project and asked her to give me the necessary clearance. And she did.
“These run the gamut from relatively simple experiments with known charms to more complex and unusual subjects. It is an expansive research programme, bringing together many of the best magical researchers in Britain.”
“But—” Harry spluttered. “But then… If I hurt him, and I hurt him again, and probably if I’ve missed that I’ve hurt other people as well, hurt friends, hurt you, and that…” he trailed off.
” that left them both silent for the long minutes before Draco decided to repurpose it as kindling. The elves made rack of lamb, and mother and son each had a second piece of the bûche de Noël and a third glass of champagne, and when Draco stumbled onto the hearth afterwards, he was especially glad of the tree. It felt warmer, coming home to that. Besides which the fairies seemed to have taken pity on him this year, putting aside their usual quarrelling in favour of keeping to themselves. It made for an unusually symmetrical tree, and meant the one bulb Draco had charmed specially and hung in the back corner was always well-lit, enough so that even in the middle of the night he could see the two figures in it, and the dozens of apples on the ground around them turning from brown to green and red, and back again.
“I’ve told you,” Draco said. He didn’t try to keep the weariness out of his voice. “More than once. It’s clear that nothing I say will convince you.”
Draco Summons the box he’d been carrying, stacks it on top of the one Harry’d first lifted, and holds out a Ministry-standard Portkey. “If you’ll both come with me, we can begin the test right away.”
There were more than a few on my part too, I’ll grant. He fucked me like none other. His world seemed to have disappeared as well; there was nothing in his sights but me, his awe at the feeling of my arse around him was obvious and overwhelming. He thrust into me as though he might die if he had to stop, as if he might let the world burn if it meant another minute inside of me.
He made himself give an approving smile. “More than.” He ran a thumb over Sydney’s lower lip. “Your mouth… better things to do with it than talk, no?”
The feeling of his legs against mine was as thrilling as the meeting of our chests. His skin…I don’t expect to ever have enough of it.
“Yeah,” Harry said. That was an understatement. Malfoy had wanted a Muggle entrance opening on to a Muggle street, charms to block Apparition, unusually heavy security charms on the outside of the building, a long and particular list of charms on specific rooms and stairwells, and all of it while refusing standard Muggle-repelling Charms and requiring specific charm placement to avoid interference with an electronic Muggle security system. His application for a Muggle-accessible magical space was so intricate that Hermione, as head of the Department of Muggle Relations, had had to personally sign off on it twice. Once it came to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Robards had, on Hermione’s advice, required unusually precise Muggle-repelling and Disillusionment Charms for all entrances and exits to magical areas, which had led to several lengthy and increasingly irritable rounds of bureaucratic back and forth, and the ultimate determination that a specialist would have to come out and do it. It had taken two Unspeakables the better part of a day, which struck Harry as a colossal waste of Ministry resources. It had also required an Auror to come out for the opening of the blasted show, to stand by with an
“I don’t have to. I can have you now. Bend you over the desk and fuck you stupid. Bit less civilised than I’d like it, but if you’re not willing to talk…” He trailed off with a shrug. “Less civilised is how you like it anyway, I suppose.”
He was surprised, to say the least. “With all due respect, you know my theory. In its entirety, following your conversation with Millie. I assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that you realised I was, for lack of a more politic phrase, making it up, for the benefit of our larger goal.”
The smell in here is really gross. I wish they would do something about it. Doesn’t it seem like healing potions should smell better? How much good are they doing if they make everyone want to sick up?
“They could have holstered it to you discreetly and put it under concealment charms without putting it
Harry is calling for him, shouts punctuated by quick, heavy footsteps. Everything goes bright when Harry shoves a curtain open, and then Draco is looking up at him, heart still pounding.
His legs felt heavier than they had before. Still, he took to the stairs, climbing storeys and peeking into room after room after room. He made it all the way to the top before tentativeness overtook curiosity. He had to take a deep breath before he could look up to the landing where he and Malfoy had been just an hour or so before.
Draco seized the moment to nip at Potter’s lip again, and this time Potter tried to catch him in a kiss. Pressed forward of his own accord, warm lips moving against Draco’s, almost searching. Draco let him. For a moment. “That’s one way to get out of the question.” Potter reached for him again. He stepped back, hoping that Potter couldn’t tell how hard that step was to take. “Or try to.”
Potter always did have to be the exception. Or Granger always did have to let her overconfidence get the best of her sense. Or maybe, he conceded whilst, very briefly, feeling more charitable, the Elder Wand was too particular to work with an implant. Or there was something else at play that had been mysteriously excluded from the official records even in their unexpurgated form.
Potter whines when Draco withdraws from his jeans. Draco squeezes his arm. “Stop,” he hushes, returning his hand to Potter’s belt buckle. “If you want more.”
“Your resting vitals are fine, but before we proceed further I need to know how your body, the purely physical systems, respond to activity. Please change into your training kit, set it to at least a moderate pace and walk or run, as you prefer, for an hour. I’ll return to check on you then.” He waited for Potter to nod his understanding. “Granger, Millie?”
He looks distraught until I move to catch the tip of his cock between my lips. I give it a kiss. “Tell me now. Would you rather touch yourself?”
And when Harry rolls his hips up against Draco’s thigh, Draco feels him, too, and the noise is there again and he doesn’t care, wouldn’t hold it back for anything, because Harry is hard. Harry is rock fucking hard for him,
“Yes. You do. Dinner was not the right venue, clearly. There were surprises and, frankly, Pansy has made all of us want to blow something up once or twice.”
“No?” Ron sounded more furious than querulous. “Who knows what sort of games he’s been playing? What he could’ve done with you? What he might’ve done tonight, or the next— Fuck, Harry. Did you see the evidence? Are you really giving that ferret—that murderous, Death-Eating ferret—the benefit of the doubt?”
His stomach drops when he sees the handwriting in which it’s been addressed, and turns over completely when he sees what it’s written on.
But then, he couldn’t run the gallery from a state of transcendental nothingness, and it would take far more than Potter’s stubbornness to keep him from that.
Draco shook his head slowly. “Yet every time I see you, it’s with requests for an update on when he can start raising money again.”
“Seriously? Malfoy, seriously? They’re right there.” Harry reaches over and pokes the pile, because the only sane explanation is that he and Malfoy are talking about different forms.
Potter paused. Draco didn’t think he looked at all surprised. “They’re under a lot of pressure, you know.”
Harry tries not to stare. He fails miserably. Draco’s robes have been replaced with a Muggle-style suit that fit him beautifully. His legs look as long and toned as Harry knows they are, and the lines of the jacket leave Harry breathless. He has a new appreciation for Draco’s comments about hand to the fabric, at least inasmuch as he very much wants to put his hands on the fabric.
Blackmailing the Deputy Head Auror once was—well, much riskier than he’d realised at the time, and probably best kept to a one-off.
And it was, in its way, Draco thought, even if he couldn’t shake the weight of uncertain silence. He broke it two blocks in. “I don’t know that we’ve ever spent this much time together without talking. Or some variation thereof.”
She held out the deed to me and asked me if that’s what I’d come for. It was, of course. Among other things. I reached for it. She banished it to her vault.
“Definitely.” He gripped the edge of his desk and met her eye with a smile. “Let me just see to this, and I’ll be right in.”
She didn’t move an inch. I suppose she’s used to giving commands while on her back. Just went on and on.
He knew he couldn't do anything about the heat he felt creeping over his cheeks, but Harry tried desperately to relax his jaw.
Draco nods, and nods again when he repeats the question, and soon Harry’s fingers are lingering on the clasp at Draco’s collar. He leans in until he can taste the peppermint on Draco’s breath. “Please?”
Potter’s jaw tightened and his eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Draco might not even have noticed it if he hadn’t sat through quite so many negotiations. Or so many Death Eater meetings. Though in the end, he thought, Muggle and magical megalomaniacs weren’t so very different. They all clenched their jaws and narrowed their eyes sooner or later.
Draco handed him the thermometer and returned the stethoscope to his bag. When he stood, he saw the source of that warmth: the outer seam on Potter’s left thigh was glowing red. As Draco watched in shock, it began to curl back on itself, issuing a wispy strand of smoke that quickly dissipated into the breeze. Potter was still looking away, and seemed to be unaware.
On the forty-second day after the Battle of Hogwarts, Malfoy lets Harry leave a trail up his inner arm and down his sternum. Harry loves the way the bruises seem to move with Malfoy's heartbeat.
The light shining down on Malfoy was so bright, and everything else in Courtroom Eight so dim by comparison, that Harry found it hard to see anything other than the glare off Malfoy’s white-blond hair and the outlines of the Wizengamot’s murmuring masses. He only recognised Penelope Clearwater when she came close enough to administer Harry’s oath.
The door to the Vanishing Department is ten feet of dull grey metal. There’s nothing remotely inviting about it. Which might, maybe, be why Harry doesn’t want to open it. It just doesn’t look like it wants to be opened and who is he to argue?
Pansy…I should’ve known better. Should’ve seen the bitterness creeping over her. I should be angry at him for distracting me, but it’s always been a talent of his. And it’s my own fault. I should’ve known.
“Okay,” Harry murmurs, stepping up until he’s toe to toe with Draco. He runs a thumb over Draco’s left cheekbone, down his jaw. “Help me, would you?”
My third, of I hope many, mornings waking up at Grimmauld Place. I’d be tempted to suspect the house is charmed to put me in a good mood but, especially given that raging bitch of a portrait downstairs, I think it’s less to do with brick and mortar and more to do with the company.
As soon as Harry realises, he’s done for. Draco feels it, feels Harry’s come land on his cheek, opens his mouth to swallow what he can and hears Harry’s strangled, “Oh, fuck,” when he does.
Draco leans forward, lacing his fingers together so tightly his knuckles ache. But it’s worth it. He’s wholly determined not to rise to Potter’s bait. “And kneeling citizens? Anything to say about them?”
“There was one second where you looked so curious, I thought maybe, you know? Maybe if I told you it was okay, or if you said something, but then you just said something like ‘takes all sorts’ and went back to your pint. I never thought you might—” Harry stopped. Swallowed. Still couldn’t bring himself to say it. “If I said anything I thought that would be the end of it all. If I didn’t say anything at all, at least I could be around you. I was holding my breath, I guess, and if I’d asked and you’d said no—hell, maybe if I’d asked and you’d said yes, and I’d told you I’d rented a one-bedroom five minutes outside of Museum Square and you’d offered to expand the space or transfigure a second bed or any of those things that you’d have been well within your right to do, because we were friends, and of course you would want your own space—then what? Maybe I was holding my breath because it was the only breath I had.”
He summoned his best 'morning crowd' radio presenter voice. Smooth, relaxed, just a bit friendly. "Morning, Lee."
The floor was empty and the hallway was almost dark, save ambient light from the city beyond and a dim rectangle that Harry knew would be from the desk lamp, spilling out from Malfoy's doorway.
“Okay.” Harry looked as flustered as Draco felt, but Draco didn’t find even a hint of relief in that. “It’s about the hearing.”
Draco stops in front of an aisle and turns to face Potter. “You had a proper collection, Potter. This way.”
She narrowed her eyes at him. “Apparently, I must. At least someone in this house has retained a sense of humour. Now, did you come down for food, or could Potter’s bellowing be heard upstairs?”
Harry circles his shaft with his hand and mouth, bobbing down until they meet, and Draco inhales sharply. “Yes.” His voice cracks. “Good.”
Draco felt the affront down to the tips of his toes. “You think I buy it myself? That’s what decorators are for you–” He clenched his jaw and force himself to exhale. “Do you want to make a deal or not?”
Or not. “I really am sorry. Didn’t mean to remind you, especially at work and all. Because, I know that you miss it. Whether you want to admit it or not.”
He injured himself in practice last week and has been moving slowly ever since. I knew he’d be last in the changing room and couldn’t possibly miss the opportunity to find some silver lining in the poor boy’s condition. While he was finishing in the showers – the one furthest from me, of course – I cast a charm on his musical device. The volume increased slowly, until it was blaring from his end of the room, courtesy of the best training in Muggle-bating a Dark Lord can provide. His every attempt to turn it down had the opposite effect. It wasn’t long before he came stumbling over to me, befuddled and half-dressed, looking for either a culprit or a solution.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “What kind of a masochist are you, to enjoy the drunk Weasel’s company for any longer than that?”
No one was, though, and Draco didn’t mind too terribly much, even if Potter’s shirt looked like he’d got it in a 3 pack at M&S. He raised his glass. “Drink?”
A week later they had bloomed. Then the magnolias were leafing, their flowers’ fuzzy green covers given way to pink and white flowers that left the air smelling sweet and fresh, and every breath Draco took felt like spring. The apple trees followed, and the ladybirds returned with enough of a vengeance that when Draco left his office windows open he’d often find their red spotted shells clustered in a corner of the sill or, occasionally, trekking across his notes. They were good luck, he’d once been told, and it felt like it.
“How are you so sure about that?” His eyebrows were drawn as he ran his hand through the purple smoke of a cauldron.
“Reckon so.” Greg spoke to his lap, and so quietly he could barely be heard. “Not good ones, but you don’t always get good ones.” He chanced a look up at Draco. “Thought you thought that too.”
Harry wasn’t sure where to begin. The idea of using Inferi… He could practically feel their cold fingers wrapping around his ankles just for hearing the word. And then, the idea that someone might think that Squibs
Harry's sleepy satisfaction began to ebb as they sat. He sat back in the chair and shifted uncomfortably.
Each cell in Draco’s veins felt like it came to a stop, replaced with a fuzzy numbness that made it hard to speak. To figure out what even to say. “I.” He cleared his throat. “In some ways. I don’t think… It was hard to sort it all out. During a war, you know.” A laugh bubbled up, low in his throat. “Of course you do. That made it hard to think about those things much at all.”
So he follows Robards, down three grim, grey-beige hallways, through a steel door, and into a surprisingly sterile-looking anteroom. Nobody’s at the front desk, but Robards doesn’t hesitate to slam his hand down on the bell.
I bet beating him at Quidditch would get me one step closer. Perhaps we can share a changing room again. No real reason to use more than one set of showers for a friendly Seeker’s game. He’s already seen me in the altogether, so we’re long past due for the reverse.
“Don’t be daft,” Pansy said. “This would’ve been unimaginable five years ago.” She deepened her voice, then, putting on the affect they all recognised as her Draco voice. “Pansy,
By the time he convinces himself to turn, Draco’s back in his pants and bending to retrieve his trousers. He doesn’t try to catch Harry’s eye, focusing instead on rebuttoning his flies.
had gathered dust in his library for years, among the other volumes the Ministry had deigned to leave him, and there was something calming about having found a use for it.
I had believed for many years—it had been true, for many years—that I could detect Harry Potter from across a Quidditch Pitch, blindfolded, in a hailstorm. My sense for him was intuitive, visceral. We called it loathing then, those low sparks firing at the base of our spines, that coiled wrench in the gut. When we shared a classroom or a hallway I never failed to know where he was, how far I'd have to reach to land a jinx or a kick or strategic "accidental" elbow to the ribs.
Draco shook his head and tried to relax back into it. “Yeah, that’s good.” He rocked into the waiting mouth and closed his eyes again. “Yeah.”
He leapt to his feet at the sudden sound of footsteps, and jumped almost out of his skin when a soft voice came from behind him.
Though not wrongly. Trevor is the name of Longbottom’s frog, from first year. I knew that, even. Was there when Longbottom lost him on the train, found him on the steps. Just after I’d held my hand out to Harry.
“Not of the cheap stuff, of course. But this isn’t, is it?” He took the excuse to run his hand back up Potter’s front. “Will wonders never cease? Almost feels like Dragonhide.”
It would be predictable to anyone who’s ever tried to wrangle a bit of straight arse. But, I realise, that’s not Potter. Potter, who is, at least momentarily, visibly perplexed by the question. At last, he mumbles, “Just do.”
“Yes.” Draco smiled. “It is. We do surgeries off-site, at Sainte Jeanne d’Arc, but most of the daily work happens here. Shall we?”
Draco’s not at all certain of what to do with that. Comforting him is out of the question. Potter gets far too upset by inanimate objects and the Vanishing Department is not the sort of place where those sentiments ought to be encouraged. Cleaning saviour snot off his uniform is certainly not in the job description. But the other options aren’t any better. He knows Potter well enough to guess that scolding and yelling will incite a different, louder, sort of unpleasant reaction and really, all Draco wants is to be done with this. To go back to the neat, ordered world he’d almost begun to enjoy before Potter’s arrival.
Would you try something like anger? A different type of emotion, but still a relatively straightforward one.”
But he didn’t feel any of that. He wasn’t repelled. Malfoy was softer than anything Harry thought he’d ever touched, and he didn’t want to stop. He ran his hands over Malfoy’s arms, around to his back to pull him close. He kissed Malfoy’s neck, and when Malfoy ducked his head, Harry arched back, making way for Malfoy’s tongue to trace an electric line down his neck.
He smiled, lust-blown, hazy, and silent. And then his smile grew into a grin. He nodded, bucked his hips, and sent me reeling. My back hit the canvas with a heavy thud.
“Harry…” Hermione sent him her most sympathetic look. “Draco and I have been working on this project together. He’s the one who found the texts –”
Shacklebolt sat up in his chair. “Is there any chance of Auror Potter making a return to public life? We’re entering the height of charity season.”
“The Minister?” Draco asked, still trying to piece together the events of the last hour. “Did you know Potter…. did that? Could do that?”
Draco’s blood surged, a wave of angry heat traveling through his chest with it. “You know, Potter, I think I do.”
“Aside from Scourgification, the Vanishing Department returns every item in the condition in which it arrived.”
Draco perked up and slid back on to the couch. “A hard limit, Potter? Is it possible that the Golden Boy knows the scene?”
He leaned back and folded his napkin neatly in his seat. “Take a moment, Potter. Consider your options. I’ll give you until the cheque comes.”
“Listen to me Potter, and don’t turn around. If you turn around, I’ll stop. Got it?” Harry heard the telltale sound of skin against skin. “Are you listening?”
he was. Which was just a nice convenience, really. Probably just that he’s good at his job, which, if Harry’d gathered anything, that was it. Draco is a good Ministry official, and that’s why he was waiting.
“Draco.” Pansy set her saucer down with enough insistence to rattle the whole set. “Even in your altered state, I can’t imagine it’s escaped your notice that Harry Potter has moved into your ancestral home.”
He doesn’t expect Potter to be so demanding. He doesn’t expect the clash of teeth or the persistence of Potter’s tongue, doesn’t expect Potter to suck at his lower lip. Doesn’t expect the humming moans that escape Potter’s mouth when he pulls Draco’s body against him.
But when I glance down, I see his uncertainty, and his erection, and realise that while I’ve come twice, he’s yet to come at all.
“As you see fit?” An unmistakable note of panic tinged Granger’s voice. “I’m sorry, Dr Malfoy, but that really won’t work.”
“No,” Draco agreed. “Though I don’t know that there are clear answers. About the job, perhaps, though I imagine that’s clearer, and should tell you upfront that the odds of my leaving the University permanently are not high. But more about what there is between us. I can’t say I haven’t thought about it, or that I wasn’t disappointed not to ever see you when I was in England. I assumed—correctly, I suppose, though for different reasons than you’ve laid out—that you didn’t want to see me, and that was the end of that.”
It’s a feint every time, though. Draco admits as much when he comes to sit next to Harry in the tree. Neither of them has seen the Snitch. It’s just, Harry thinks, rather nice to be here. Together.
Malfoy gave him a look that had a distinct hint of amusement to it. “How have you been enjoying the weather this week?”
out his arms to brace himself, but he manages to manoeuvre so that, instead of colliding with it hip first, he lands astride the topmost rail. He thinks it might almost look cool.
“Quite literally. Printing that photo got us almost a full double run, between Jordan and that bit about Jones and Llewellyn. Imagine the numbers if we’d named you. If we named you now.”
I’m rock hard and newly grateful for my trousers. It’s hard enough not to slip into him as it is. So much as touching my cock would incendiary.
He didn’t remember the walk to the foyer, but he wound up there anyway. Galder was waiting, and did him the not-so-small mercy of not asking any questions, instead declaring that he would send on Master’s things and tell Mistress Pansy and Master Greg that he had left and sent best wishes, and that Galder was at his service at any time.
“As you are both aware,” Robards went on, “this is a matter requiring the utmost sensitivity and discretion. Underassistant Malfoy, how much has Unspeakable Wardwell told you?”
“I like to think so,” Neville recovers. “Never thought potions needed to be so difficult, if the ingredients were just a bit more stable.”
“It was upsetting at first, but it was easier from Paris. Fewer reminders. Out of sight, out of mind.”
“And as you saw earlier,” she continued, “Draco’s in the process of beginning practical rehabilitation so that Edgar will regain full use of his wing.”
Draco pulled back just far enough to catch Harry’s bottom lip, pressing in for another kiss. Harry hummed against him and returned it, working his mouth against Draco’s.
I withdraw my fingers and reach for the lube. Coat myself. I want to make sure this is good for him. He’ll remember this always. There’s every reason in the world to make the memory a good one.
Either way, the Aurors would know how bodies cracked and twisted with the force of that kind of magic. Extremities first, then the neck, then the base of the spine down through the torso. Destroyed before they hit the ground. He thought about how they’d have looked on the ground after several hours, how the Aurors would’ve discovered them once they’d started to go cold. Would they have gone pale by then? He started to draw them like that, pale, blood pooling towards the ground without hearts beating against gravity. But no, something about that didn’t seem right. Not when he couldn’t know for sure how long they’d lain there before someone had found them. He threw the paper onto the dwindling coals and started anew.
Draco cast her an exasperated look, though didn’t try to hide the hint of fondness for her particular, very Pansy, descriptive flair.
“I had an impromptu meeting this morning,” Draco began. Potter started to look a little green. “Just with Granger and Millicent. I’m sorry I didn’t think to call for you.”
“Yes.” Draco tried to sound more definite than he felt. He’d thought he was on to something. An answer, even. But if he’d been right about the trigger for Potter’s outbursts, this latest one certainly complicated matters.
He rolled his eyes. “It’s Thursday. I’m in surgery Monday through Wednesday for the next three weeks and have all the usual business to attend to on top of that. It really isn’t a particularly convenient time.”
What he had to was lost, erased completely when Harry leaned forward and rested his forehead against Draco’s and whispered, “Can I?”
It looked like Wizard Space, Harry thought. It had to be. But it didn’t feel like it. The only magic he could feel thrumming through the air was his own. The rest felt like cool air and warm light and electricity.
Harry cleared his throat. “You know, we’ve really no idea how long this’ll go on. You liking me without the hissing and whatnot.”
“I didn’t understand how damaging British wizarding isolationism is until I left. If I’d known then what I know now.” He stopped and sighed. “That’s a dangerous road to go down.”
“I—” He shook his head. He had no idea what to say, and saying things had proven to be a pointless exercise anyway.
He leaps forward to snatch them away from Malfoy and turns around, shoving them on and zipping his flies before he can stop to think about it.
Potter took a shallow breath, striving for calm but clearly excited by his discovery. “Sweet.” His voice was rough. “Like a pear. Crispy. Give, but not juicy. Red and green flushed. Thick skin.” The apple transformed as he spoke, growing and turning colours, the skin over its soft patches straining over ripe flesh. More of the apples on the ground between them turned too, vibrant greens and reds that were unmissable against the brown leaves. Potter didn’t open his eyes.
“The Ministry helps witches and wizards recover objects. Transportation is the sole responsibility of the witch or wizard whose items have been retrieved.”
“No,” Harry said quietly. “Gawain said it would be dangerous, for me and for them, if anyone knew my magic wasn’t stable.”
He reaches out a hand for it. Pleasure shoots down my shaft and up my spine as his fingers graze the underside. He looks up at me with such
“Yeah, um. Morning.” Potter shakes his head as if to clear it and looks up suddenly. “Listen, Malfoy, I’m really sor—”
Harry nodded, trying to train his face towards the same neutrality he’d managed, if barely, at their first briefing. Expertise was an understatement in every possible sense. “Yeah. I’m aware.”
“He’s not wrong to be sceptical,” Draco said. “No one is. Much as I wish I could change the past, if that’s what he’s going off…”
He didn't have to imagine long. Malfoy slid his hand down to Harry's jaw and ran his fingers forward along it, finally crooking one under Harry's chin and pulling him forward and down until he was almost close enough to mouth at Malfoy's flies.
“Oh!” He jumps to his feet and stumbles out towards the cacophonous newsroom, barely remembering to close the door behind him.
“Hey.” Harry smiles at him, a bit sheepish, a bit…well, adoring, which Draco still hasn’t got over after almost three months together.
Kate’s heels clicked once against the threshold, and then she crossed the carpet to stand next to Potter. She held out a thick stack of envelopes. “Sir?”
“Shhhhh,” Draco hissed. “They might not have seen us.” He pulled Harry around a plump Wizard in an unusually tall hat. ”Just stay quiet and we can get to the door without –“
“Potter.” Harry whipped his head around again, about ready to explode. Malfoy held up his free hand. “You’re speaking English.”
No windows other than at the street entrance to Charing Cross Road, which bore a massive, stencilled version of
Harry’s frown fades into something less concerned and more curious. There’s that hint of hopefulness again.
Draco was trembling when he drove back into Harry, and Harry heard the telltale clatter of metal against the floor, closely followed by Draco’s relieved moan. “Gonna come. Want to come in your arse.”
Potter continues to be problematically disarming. I suppose it is his signature move, disarming. Didn’t know it was such an extension of his personality.
“No,” Harry said, and Draco’s relief went through to his toes. “I thought about how tired I’ve been after some of the times we’ve tried casting, and how I would be worried the whole time, and how my magic still isn’t entirely predictable, and it didn’t seem like a good idea. So I guess I just… didn’t go.”
Slowly, the bird extended its other wing. A line of tape still ran across the top, and Harry almost thought he saw the bird flinch, but the injured wing got almost as long as the first.
When his thrusts grow erratic Draco leans forward, wraps his hand around Harry’s cock, and begins to stroke. It’s so much, so overwhelming. The words come pouring out.
Beneath that, Harry read a summary for a Thursday afternoon writing group for those who were first learning English and looking to practice their descriptive skills. On Friday morning, there was watercolour for seniors. Friday evening, a wine and cheese reception for students, with talks by the artists.
Potter looked at the phone again, and out the window, until his gaze focused on one particular spot that Draco had not yet seen fit to attend to. He glanced quickly at Draco and back to the window, and then stared at his hands for a solid minute before chancing a look up. “So that’s it?”
“No.” Potter sighs. Draco imagines him carding his hands through his hair, or maybe putting them in his pockets, and almost misses the portrait’s next question.
But he does. He’s gone, far too gone to care. When he nips at Potter’s lower lip, Potter retaliates. When he sinks his fingers into Potter’s mop and tugs, Potter bares his neck. When Draco descends, when he takes Potter’s flesh into his mouth and sucks, Potter moans and bucks against him and digs his nails into the back of Draco’s neck.
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry and pulled him in, tipping them back so they fell, Harry’s weight on top of him. Harry scrambled for balance, bracing one knee on the edge of the mattress and the other against the frame, which left him kneeling over Draco.
Harry supposed that was its own sort of question. “I’m not sure why else. I wanted you to explain something you’d already explained. You’re right about that.”
“It is. And in addition to serving a larger purpose in the field, it’s likely to improve your surgical outcome if we start rebuilding your tolerance for magical exposure. It can only help.”
He thrust back again, trying to encourage Malfoy’s fingers to hit the necessary spot, and when it came close he released a low, promisingly sibilant, “Yesss.” He pulled his head up and faced the box, swallowing heavily and sliding into a series of low moans when Malfoy’s fingers sped up.
Harry tried to laugh into the silence between them, though it came out strangled. “Plenty to discuss with Healer Barrett. Turns out to be a rather long list.”
“Good, that’s good,” Draco soothed, and marveled as Potter canted his hips back without even seeming to realise it. “Are you hard?”
She crossed her arms, looking highly offended. “Yes. Greg and I each paid someone to come in, confidentially, as soon as we could afford it. Made all the difference in the world. And if Potter doesn’t agree I’ll be perfectly happy to wait in the kitchens and yell at him some more.”
Draco’s not sure he’d mind, though. He likes Harry like this, sitting over him, come dripping onto his unlaced Quidditch trousers, eyes shut, chest flushed.
“Would you please do it again, as you described the apple in the orchard? With some detail, perhaps holding a picture in your mind?”
He starts to slide down the wall, his shirt bunched up at his back as the brick scrapes the skin at the top of his arse. He keeps on, slips down till his half-clad bum hits the ground, till his mouth is in your view. He wipes it with the back of his hand and then you see him, his jaw dropped and his lips pink and, when you look, his eyes grey and glazed.
Potter steps forward again, pinning Draco’s wand hand to his chest. “I don’t. I think you considered all of it. So what does it say that you settled on this?”
“And the balls?” He glared at her. “Very important galas? That’s what it comes down to. You know there’s a solution to the Wizengamot issue.”
If the silence in the room was anything to go by, Robards had finished. Draco cleared his throat. “I appreciate your thoroughness, Auror Robards. Given those precautions, and the obvious benefit to the larger wizarding world, of course I shall be happy to participate.”
Instead of harder, Draco settles his fingers all the way inside of Harry and crooks them the way he hopes he remembers Harry likes. The shouted profanity tells him his memory has held up.
He took in the mouldings, the curtains, the bust of Brutus Malfoy, right where they’d been on his last walk through the house, and just as pristine. Then he lowered his eyes to the sofas, set across from each other in the curve of the room’s bow windows.
Father sends a congratulatory bottle of Champagne and a note suggesting that the blind item was a stroke of genius and Draco is making him very proud indeed. Draco
Malfoy’s eyes slipped to Harry’s cock, which was bobbing as he worked himself open. He was entranced until Harry spoke again. “Getting close…could start any time now.” He caught Malfoy’s eye. “Suppose you want me to stop, hmm?”
It didn’t make him feel any less like he was falling, or like he might ascend into the sky, or like he might be able to run for endless miles, even though he knew he’d collide with glass if he tried. He felt like he could scream, or exhale. He wanted to know what would happen if he did. It seemed incredible that this space could exist, and even more fantastical that it could feel like that without magic.
“The first charity thing is on the 5th. I know you’ve said this path will take longer, but the sooner I do this the sooner I’ll be ready, for some of them, even if not that one, and they do matter. I do want to do this. And the hearing, that’s in eight days.”
There was a moment, just one, when Harry hesitated. Draco saw him look up through hooded eyes, his mouth half open and so close to Draco’s shaft that Draco could feel the heat of his breath, and he faltered.
Recovering himself, Draco comes to stand behind the counter, knitting his fingers together and looking his client – which, Draco reminds himself, is all he is – straight in the eye. “Welcome to the Vanishing Department. How may we help you?”
He was wearing a three-piece charcoal grey wool suit, all of it fitting like a glove over a pale blue dress shirt, the collar starched so crisply Harry wondered if he should classify it as a weapon.
“That we needed to see the plans, and when it asked why – well, I didn’t think it would be that keen on having the Chamber closed forever, so I might’ve told it that we were protecting the Basilisk bones. It made me promise to do that, and then said it’d tell me the rest once I took it there. Why? Is that a problem?”
If he notices, he doesn’t protest. Doesn’t make a sound, though I feel some answering pressure as I work his arse.
Harry remained silent, and Malfoy sighed. “I realise this is not the ideal situation. But short of advertising for a replacement, which I assume you’d rather not do –” Harry shook his head furiously “—this is the most ideal situation possible. For what it’s worth, I’ve no interest in selling any sordid details to the
“Right. Thank you.” Draco took a breath. “The night you walked in on me getting head from that bloke—” Potter’s head shot up “—I’d been out dancing with friends. Millie and Blaise came in after you’d left and noticed a loaf of bread that had turned to cinders while you were, I’m fairly certain, watching under your cloak. It was the same day that your seam had started to burn during your examination. Those incidents were part of a larger pattern that led to the development of my theory, but they represent a pattern of their own, which I think was confirmed last night.
Draco ran a hand through his hair, pulling on the ends. “Picked a damn fine time to stop being a doormat.”
“Fair enough.” Draco lifted his cup, drained it slowly, and set it down again. “Did you order tea without biscuits.”
Draco’s head spins. He had expected to win, but not so quickly. Not like this, surrounded by the smell of Potter’s soap and with his cock already hardening under his robes. Not with Potter grabbing at him and rolling their hips together. Not with Potter
“Is that what you think?” he asked. “That I’ve done all of this work to dress myself up as a Muggle-lover in order to, what, feed Muggle artists to the pure-blood wolves?”
His smile. I’ll remember that too. The way his shoulders relaxed. His tentative gesture towards the other part of the attic, beyond the staircase. Just as bright, and bigger, more open. Only a desk, holding a few books, and a chair, and a bed, big and low to the ground, inexpertly made with white linens and a duvet.
“Yeah, but they probably know that might not all be true, you know? Records are different. If I read a suspect’s actual MLE records, I’d take that a lot more seriously than a Rita Skeeter tell-all.”
And then he gasps, because Potter is pressing his thigh into Draco’s groin, and it’s just the right amount of pressure, and the way Potter rolls his hips is somewhere between distracting and criminal, and Potter’s mouth is next to his ear, his breath hot against Draco’s skin, and he’s whispering, “I have every idea. I know you, Draco Malfoy.”
I’m glad he’s looking at the ceiling instead of my face. I doubt this particular combination of shock and smugness would be quite my best look.
These interactions are obviously limited in scope, and I will need to find ways to increase their frequency and intensity. However, fortunately, Potter himself has not been unwelcoming when these moments arise. Maddeningly, I sense a touch of amusement, as though he realises that a Malfoy has never done such menial things as rescuing errant chest pieces, sans magic, without ulterior motive. But amusement is far better than scorn, at least in this context.
Reconciling those two Dracos is…difficult. Harry has thought—as he avoids certain hallways and toilets and restaurants—the dissonance could be overwhelming. He’s been quite content not to know for sure.
He followed Harry to the bin and then led the way toward the alley. They were hidden behind a skip, about to leave, when Draco stopped him again. “Paris, living here – you’ll think about it?”
“We don’t expect catching the murderer will resolve petty crime, but it’s a fair sight better than a serial killer who mutilates his victims.”
“Oh?” For all that Harry wanted to know more, he’d be glad enough to leave talk of Inferi behind. “Is it?”
“More,” Draco exhales, and threads his fingers through Harry’s hair. He tugs—because he knows Harry too, knows Harry so well—and tries not to buck into Harry’s throat when he feels the moan vibrate around his cock.
And Draco does look. Harry arches to let him and perhaps unknowingly, Draco takes a step towards him.
“No, no. Come inside.” Draco corrects himself when Potter raises an eyebrow. “Please, won’t you come in?”
“And you— Before… anything I just need to be sure. You want to? Not because you feel like you should or it’s the right thing to do for someone new to all this?”
He follows Harry down the staircase. He doesn’t ignore the stares, or the litany of doubts that make him wonder what they’re all thinking, or the urge to drop Harry’s hand. Instead, he thinks about what will happen if he lets go.
He pushed Potter’s jacket off his shoulders, and Potter rolled his arms back to drop it to the floor. He had a thin t-shirt on underneath. When Draco looked down he could see the faint outline of Potter’s nipples, and then he was pulling at the hem of the shirt, pulling it up and over Potter’s head. He ran his hands over Potter’s bare arms and kissed him fiercely, thrilling when Potter moaned at his touch.
“Good.” I bring my free hand to stroke his thigh. He’s breathing evenly, if quickly. “Tell me how it feels.”
Draco flattens his tongue and runs it back to the tip of Harry’s cock, then arches his neck to take Harry into his mouth, bobbing on his cock, sucking and licking, pulling free just to hear Harry gasp and see him move his hips in search of Draco’s mouth.
She stopped in front of an unmarked door and gave him a genuine, if fleeting, smile. Then she pushed it open and led them into the Minister’s waiting room. She slipped behind the desk, and into an astonishingly good imitation of naïve, innocent boredom. She looked every bit the office secretary, fed up with office tedium. It was remarkable, Draco thought.
“Oh?” Draco raised an eyebrow, a bit thankful that Potter, with his apparent protectiveness where Granger and the Unspeakables were concerned, probably couldn’t see it. “Why not?”
“Oh.” Draco is almost light-headed with relief. This doesn’t seem like a prelude to a bigger confession. Though, his lingering queasiness reminds him, Harry could be trying to break Marcel to him gently. He clears his throat. “It’s fine. Slow day. Do you want to fill out the forms or come back and look yourself?”
He didn’t notice anything but the pull of a mouth around his prick until a glass slid across the counter and shattered against the floor. His eyes shot open and before he knew what he was seeing, he’d tightened his hold on Sydney’s hair and thrust forward, so Sydney couldn’t turn his head. “Don’t stop,” he rasped.
“That you mention him at all. You were never one to talk openly about romantic feelings, with Ginny or Ms Chang, for instance.”
Draco exhaled heavily, his breath curling into the crisp morning air. He shook his head slowly. “You guess you do.”
“Thank you, Auror Robards,” Croaker continued “As I have said before, your department did a commendable job in convincing the public that the Wand has been destroyed. One of our reasons for keeping it intact was to facilitate further study, which Auror Potter was quite willing to cooperate with. If the implant isn’t working we can simply remove it and return it to the Department of Mysteries for research. And safekeeping,” he added, almost as an afterthought.
“There was a second thing I had to say. That I wanted to ask you, actually. The other night. It wasn’t that I didn’t want it.” He saw the breath leave Draco’s chest and it took all his remaining will to keep talking. “I just never really thought that you did. Did you?”
“I may need to return fortnightly or monthly to make sure he hasn’t lost ground. Though I suppose a Healer here could do that.” He toyed with the hem of his napkin. “I was always here to oversee his case, which was always a temporary project. I have a lab to return to, and a home, patients, colleagues. My mother. It was never meant to be a permanent change.”
His vision flickered as it rolled through him. His hand slipped on the pane, and then it was just Potter’s back holding him up, the world narrowed to the heavy satisfaction in his thighs and the heat of Potter’s bare skin pressed against his own. His breathing slowed. He dropped his hand to Potter’s shoulder and felt Potter relax beneath it.
“I…” Harry waffled. Momentarily. The mélange in his chest was good for his resolve. “So will you, if you don’t stop arguing with me.”
“Of course.” It’s automatic, defensive. Even if he’d been so shocked by it all that Harry’s actual words had sort of washed over him at the time. “I hear perfectly well.”
It’s that time of year when seasonal objects start to make their appearances, particularly on Mondays. More tinsel is Vanished in the course of family squabbles than Draco will ever know what to do with. At least, he thinks, removing a silver strand from where he’s draped it around his neck, it’s easy to store.
and continues on. “Shoes seem a logical starting point, all things considered.” He glances pointedly to Harry’s feet.
Potter backed up, wiped the back of his hand against his mouth, stared at Draco for a long, silent moment, and ran.
“Come in,” Draco yelled, more than a bit relieved for the interruption. Potter certainly hadn’t lost his talent for self-righteousness.
Phillips snaps to attention. “Mr Malfoy, sir. Mr Robards had to report to a meeting with the Solicitor General. Mr Potter and I are here for the test.”
But Draco could barely sit still. He shuffled papers into one stack and then another, and then back to the first again. He couldn’t make himself focus on the words on the order forms, or fill out the Gringotts transaction requests. He couldn’t even make himself alphabetise it all, so the paperwork would be ready when he felt less like an Exploding Snap card about to blow.
And perhaps Harry is not alone in thrilling to the feeling of skin against skin. Draco moans and gasps and begins to mumble his way through a string of curses that would embarrass half of Knockturn Alley.
Draco leaned back, resting against the very edge of his desk. The sides of his coat fell away. He felt the slightest hint of pressure as Potter stepped forward and ran his finger over the four buttons of Draco’s waistcoat. As much as Draco appreciated a good suit, he hadn’t thought Potter would.
He looked so…hopeful. Scared. His eyes were big, his lips turned up in just the hint of a smile. He said, “Okay,” on an exhale. Barely a whisper.
He took the measure of the room. The blue rooms, yes, as he’d asked for. He had fallen asleep on top of the duvet, but his head was on a pillow and a light blanket covered his bottom half; the elves’ work, no doubt. Still in his clothes, but his shoes were gone. Curtains drawn, the weak beginnings of daylight peeking in at the edges. He let his eyes fall shut and took a steadying breath. He couldn’t have missed breakfast yet. Should even have time to review his notes. The thought did far more for him than any amount of deep breathing.
“I do, but…” Draco’s heartbeat and the stability of his stomach have belonged to Potter for weeks now, but in this moment he suspects the rest of his body has joined the conspiracy. His lungs refuse to fill. His toes tingle. His cheeks are numb. His thighs are strung tight. His head is light. His chest is warm. His fingers feel heavy and sticky, like he’s stuck them in preserves without noticing. He’s not sure how to even get the next words out. Not sure what he’ll do if he gets them out and finds he’s misunderstood Potter’s meaning entirely.
And then his hand moved down again, and down, to the top of my leg, and he wedged a knee between mine and gave me a questioning look. I nodded.
“Okay.” He sat on the table, held out his arm for Draco’s blood pressure cuff and waited patiently as Draco listened to his heart and took his pulse and temperature.
In spite of his shock, Draco does it just in time, both to avoid a collision and to see Potter swing himself through the window and land with infuriating grace. The urge to taunt is near-irrepressible; he wants to ask if Potter’s training for the ballet, but the words feel too familiar in his throat and he catches them in a wave of nostalgic regret that hits the back of his teeth and stops just in time.
“Harry.” Draco squeezed his hand and tried to smile at him, though it felt mostly like a tactic to diminish the blow. “I appreciate that, truly, I do. But that’s not what you want to do, or what your foundation is meant to be about. And even if it were, this kind of work relies on there being patients to see and a community of scholars to work with. There’s no institutional infrastructure to support that in England. It’s not about money. One of the few things, but there you go. It’s about the entire British approach to magical medicine. If they took Muggle science seriously, they might have to take Muggles seriously, and that would upend far too many things to be palatable.”
Draco bucked forward, throwing Harry off balance. Draco grabbed his knees and pushed him onto his back.
“Very well then,” Mill announced to the room. “We’re here to discuss Mr Potter’s progress. Dr Malfoy is overseeing his care. Unspeakable Croaker and Unspeakable Granger were at the head of his last team. Auror Robards is the head of Mr Potter’s home department, and he and Mr Weasley are managing public inquiries about his whereabouts. The Minister’s Office is coordinating efforts and, given the nature of the case, the Minister is taking a personal interest in progress and outcomes. Dr Malfoy, would you start us off with an update on Mr Potter’s care?”
He’s not sorry. Not at all. There’s more thick hair across Potter’s thighs, which are muscled and trembling, just like the rest of him. He leans forward to grab Potter’s arse, catching a nipple in his mouth as long as he’s there.
“So I recall. But will you be able to make the same sort of effort with Phillips and Robards watching?”
“I’m sorry,” he said again, and walked towards Malfoy, whose whole head turned this time to watch him and who, for one split second, gave him a look of such bewildered fondness that Harry thought he might stop.
“You—Harry Potter, defeater of Voldemort, defender of Muggles, champion of Muggle-borns, righteous and just destroyer of banks, schools, and government buildings—are telling me that I—Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, former torturer of Muggles and Muggle-borns—am going too far to protect Muggle art.”
Draco wanted to stare. Wanted to stare endlessly, at the coarse hair that ran down the centre of Harry’s chest, at the dark nipples, stark against his pale skin and already hard. But Harry’s jumper was in the way of the view and, he realised, Harry was squeezing it in his hands as if he wasn’t sure what to do with it. Draco took it from him and threw it at the foot of the bed.
“I…I’m feeling kind of.” He swallows. “I think I should…” He can just faintly make out the rise and fall of Draco’s chest. He wants to touch it. He wants to know whether he’s really as warm as Harry remembers. If he’s as hard. If he’s as rough.
Draco half-laughs, and this time his voice does crack. “The Wizengamot had just heard my case. Half thought the Vanishing Cabinet made me an expert. The other half thought I deserved to have to deal with the room. ‘The consequences of my actions’ – they all agreed on that.”
Now I’ve just got to finish this letter to Mother. Make sure our stories about charities align. See how she’s holding up.
“Tall, bald-headed fellow, perpetually exhausted?” Mille asked “And yes, I did know he could do that. Explains a few things about why they’re all over him, don’t you think?”
“Still,” Shacklebolt persisted, “why don’t we meet then and see? Weasley, that should give you time to think through a few different scenarios. Robards, security, if you would. Croaker, Granger, you can adjust your research agenda. Will that suit?”
Walking would have been dumb, Harry reminded himself. He would have wound up cold, and sweaty under his coat, and there would have been the whole awkward business of taking his coat off and explaining why he, a wizard, had walked. Instead, he stood on the hearth, then stepped back off and back on again, and off, and on. He thought, not a bit grimly, that at least it was a way to work up an appetite. Which he needed badly, as his stomach had been colonised by some very angry butterflies, or possibly wasps.
Malfoy blinked. "You gave me names and birth years. If there had been more than one result, Kate would have asked for clarification."
“Merlin,” Draco said, barely managing not to slur his words. “Yes, Needed it. Fuck.” He let his eyes fall shut, and when he opened them Potter was still there, looking back at him. Seeing him. He drew a deep breath. “Now. What do you need?”
Good thing, too. The Manor’s beautiful this time of year, crisp and cool in the late autumn, the wind whipping through the trees. There are few things so perfect, and I don’t intend to miss it next year.
had practically had to fight her way out of the house to stave off the influx of love letters, hate mail, and autograph requests, and Hermione had barely talked the Hogwarts Reconstruction Committee out of sending last-minute appeals plastered with that morning’s headline: “POTTER AND MALFOY TO HEADLINE HRC GALA.”
They’re both looking a bit worn around the edges by the time they move on to serveware. At least, Draco thinks they are. It’s a bit tedious, this. Sorting through odds and ends, avoiding Potter’s gaze. It’s clearly better than the alternative, where the alternative is having Potter hurl apologies at him. Yes, he’s feeling oddly listless, moving along like this. But it’s probably just that he wishes there was some polite way to stop for tea that wouldn’t involve inviting Potter to join him.
“Technically, yes, but they often choose not to. We see fewer cases of this now that the implants are becoming standard protocol. It was mostly an issue for patients who spent long periods of time in the void as a result of their magical outbursts. As,” he added, “Potter has. After leaving the hospital, either after their illness was resolved or after receiving an implant, many of them moved to predominantly Muggle areas. Switched to careers that keep them away from magic. Herbologists go to work in Muggle botanical gardens, that sort of thing.”
.” This time seven red points emerged from the tip of his wand, growing and expanding parallel to each other, their spiky petals knitting them together just as easily as they separated the individual stems. When they were done growing they dropped from Harry’s wand, this time held together by their own structure, rather than a ribbon.
Harry’s chest contracts. The reality of a hard cock in his face leaves him more nervous than he’d ever admit.
“But it was just October by the time that was clear, and I hadn’t missed too much to try school again, try finishing my N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was over the moon about it and Ginny – Ginny was there too, and Luna and Neville, people who had been through it all. And I thought maybe if we were all together, if it was lots of people who had been there, maybe it could work. But Ginny and Neville and Luna – and you, I guess, you too – you’d all been there that last year, with the Carrows. They were close in a way I couldn’t be, and Ginny, it didn’t – nothing felt quite right, being back there. It wasn’t like it had been. And even the Professors, they wanted to talk to me about it, to interview me about what happened and what it was like, how it felt and how the spell worked, all of it. And the first years were walking around looking at me like some hero and I couldn’t, you know, swear or forget to brush my hair or yell at Hermione or any of the normal things. If I was in the common room they’d be too scared to be there, and the older ones would just look at me and be reminded and I couldn’t do that to them, couldn’t be the reason they couldn’t move on, and it’s not like I could focus on classes anyway, not like that.
He didn’t quite have it in him to laugh, but he did appreciate the softness that crept in around her eyes.
“It’s fine.” He sticks a hand into the pile, now, perversely, half hoping he’ll come up with Marcel’s pants just for a change of subject. He comes up with a weakly fluttering Snitch instead.
I wouldn’t do to keep him safe?” The dangerous glimmer in her eye was just as convincing as the speech. “You don’t understand the Ministry,
“Yes, Madam, I understand that. However, the Vanishing Department has only received one nine inch, glass, ridged, purple dildo with built in heating and cooling charms, Vanished in the last two weeks. This is it.” He pushes the item towards her with the tip of an extended index finger. “Perhaps the colouring will match your recollections in a more familiar environment. The lighting in this office is rather harsh.”
Draco walked on, trying to catch a good look at Potter from the corner of his eye. When he saw the anxiety written across Potter’s face, he nodded and turned back towards the stairs, gesturing for Potter to follow. “Still, in the interim. My fingers wouldn’t object.”
“And,” Harry took a deep breath. “Also, I’m not going to say no.” He glanced over at Draco very quickly, then back to his hands.
“Yes. The cat wandered on to the property at some point. Both parents did, I think. She’s not ours. You might as well.”
“I came looking for you,” he said, just to buy time. “I wanted—” He racked his brain for any sequence of words that might make sense. He knew how to diffuse a situation, but he didn’t want to placate Malfoy. He wanted… He wished he knew what he wanted. “I wanted to ask you, I guess. After I saw…” He nodded towards his pocket.
As Granger waited, Harry grew more and more animated. He spoke quickly, insistently. Tearfully, which made Draco uncomfortable in all sorts of ways. He only heard snippets, when Harry grew emphatic—“never should’ve let you wear the Horcrux,” “you could’ve died in Godric’s Hollow, it was a stupid idea,” “I should’ve said goodbye before the Forbidden Forest,” “you wouldn’t have a lost a whole year in Australia, trying to fix things with your parents if you hadn’t helped me”—but it was clear enough that Harry felt that he owed her something or that he had wronged her. Which, upon reflection, Draco thought shouldn’t have been surprising; somewhere along the way it had become Harry’s modus operandi. But it was still startling to hear apology upon apology. Fortunately, Granger seemed to think so too, seeing it laid out before her like that.
Malfoy is waiting for him, looking cross. He stares pointedly at the clock, then at Harry, and raises an eyebrow. Harry bristles under the scrutiny. His obvious displeasure doesn’t deter Malfoy, who looks him over, eyes trailing toes to top. Harry shivers. It’s chilly in here. He’s beginning to regret his indifference to the weather and related charms.
Blaise is, happily, more amused than annoyed. “Don’t you generally take reader correspondence at the office?
Phillips hands him the cloak and he slips it over his shoulders. He wills himself not to trip, or spin off, or repeat his first attempt.
“Hmmm.” Draco unfolds it, draping the fabric over his chest as he examines the hem. “How fortunate. There’s a label.” He glances up. Potter’s eyes are locked onto his chest. He runs a hand across the fabric. “Often is, in older, custom-made items. ‘Lavinia’s Linens, Made for Elladora Black, 1873.’ Fairly conclusive. Here.” He holds it out for Potter, who shifts back nervously.
In that vein, he thought I was looking a bit hungry and has gone off to chase down the trolley. To his credit, he was right. I’ve been hungrier in the last week than in the preceding months, and he’s decided it’s part of my recovery to indulge every whim.
Draco moaned when Harry rolled his hips and flicked Draco’s nipples. He bent over to take one into his mouth, rolling the other between his fingertips and smiling when Draco buried his fingers in Harry’s hair.
“Harry.” Draco starts to sit up, but Harry’s hand flies out of his hair to grab his bicep, so he’s stuck leaning on one elbow.
“And then, about three weeks ago, I walked into Gawain’s office, told him about it, and gave notice.”
“No, it doesn’t, and that’s exactly it. The thing is, he got really, properly upset at Pansy, didn’t he? ‘You ungrateful bitch,’ all of that. It’s been years since I’ve heard Potter say anything like that—well, obviously, but I get the impression that it’s been years since anyone has.”
Harry squints at him. “I, um? I came for my stuff, remember? The big lot of things?” Malfoy looks at him coolly. “You made me fill out ninety different forms?"
Who gasps. Who jerks and groans and throws his head back like thirst, like need. Who thrusts once, twice, thrice, the fourth time on the last beat of the bar, and the next, and the next, and you lose count. Just go until your throat burns, till you choke and gulp and grip his cock deep in your throat. Till he throbs from his thighs to his prick, through his chest. Till he comes. Till you let him go with a wet pop.
“Was flying south for the winter. Only about twenty of them winter here, and Edgar’s magic would make the long flight easier for him. The presence of spoonbills in the UK is still a bit hush-hush; it’s less likely that he was hunted than that he ran into a bit of bad luck and encountered a hunting party that mistook him for game. That would explain the presence of buckshot. If he put himself into a defensive stasis—they can do that,
Potter jumped and rushed to examine it. “Damnit. I’m really sorry Malfoy. Dr Malfoy. This—I’m too unpredictable, I—”
“Ever?” Draco’s chest seizes. He’d never imagined, for all Potter’s hesitation, that this might be the case. That this could be the case. “No one’s ever fucked you before?”
She gives him a measured look. “And that’s why you blackmailed him into sucking your cock in a public cloakroom?” She leans forward. “That’s why, given an opportunity to blackmail the Boy Who Lived and next Head Auror, you asked for a date? Because it’s madness that could never work?”
When he did—when he found a way to move, when he struck up a rhythm, when he kept it as firm and strong as Potter liked, when he found himself thrusting even just a bit harder than he’d meant to, thanks to the exquisite heat of Potter’s body—Potter’s first deep moan almost threw him over the edge. He had to make it last. Usually, that meant distraction, but he couldn’t stand to look away.
Harry could barely breathe at the sight before him. Malfoy was shackled to one of the interrogation room’s heavy wooden chairs. Someone had got him one of the coarse grey uniforms prisoners wore while awaiting trial. Harry didn’t even know if that’s what Malfoy was now. A prisoner. Or if it has been a nod towards propriety, or if it was meant to make Malfoy look guilty from the off, or if someone else had got as distracted by the bare planes of Malfoy’s chest as Harry had.
We waited two nights. Plotting. Planning. Making quick runs past old haunts to scrawl a few words, lest the pause seem too coincidental. He was quiet, tense. Kept his hands to himself.
Clearly, Malfoy noticed his discomfort. “Intent matters, you know. The line between light and dark isn’t as clear cut as people like to make it out to be. It’s about what you intend to do with your magic.
Add in weekly dinners with Mother and the occasional night out with friends, and Draco was almost too busy by mid-summer. He’d reluctantly had to give up the idea of getting a Kneazle kitten when he wasn’t home enough to properly care for it. He’d even had to fight to carve out an afternoon alone in his flat to focus on the latest clinical reports without interruption. He was due to take on a next round of implantation surgeries himself. The biggest obstacle to making the procedure common was a shortage of qualified Healers, and remedying that shortage was, therefore, of highest priority. It was just a question of picking patients whose cases would be instructive.
“I don’t appreciate your shutting me out when we both know that playing would make you feel better.”
Potter’s hands flexed against the table top, his fingertips pressing into the wood. “With prose like that you should stick to banking.”
As he spoke, Malfoy began to pound his arse, moaning low in his throat and grabbing at Harry’s hip and the edge of the bar.
Draco barely hides a cringe. They sound like schoolboys. “I—do you want to? It’s a bit complicated, the hooks—”
Draco’s chest does a funny, squirmy sort of thing. “Yes. I am fine.” He tightens his fingers around Harry’s wrist. “Among other things.”
“Er.” Potter ran a hand through his hair, as if it might make any sort of difference in either his appearance or Draco’s disposition. “Yes?”
Harry nodded hesitantly. “I’ve been thinking about it. I’m not sure that I don’t, though. There’s a lot that I like, and a lot of people I like, and a lot of ways to make the difference. Don’t like the odds of changing things from the outside.”
“He already can’t,” Greg repeated, louder. “Can he? Isn’t that the problem? Can’t be around people, can’t go out anywhere. Couldn’t beforehand, either, for all the people trying to kill him.”
Potter crosses his arms. “Avoiding your staff. Can’t remember the last time they’ve gone this long without following me around. Thought they might drop if I just walked into their office.”
Harry felt the warmth of the liquor in his veins and the come in his arse and advanced on him. “You don’t have to deny it, you know.” He smirked. “You weren’t half bad, Malfoy.”
The whispering of his staff resumes on the other side of Draco’s door and grows louder as he sips. He thinks he hears the start of a scuffle. Past drawing straws then, are they?
Draco’s out of his seat before he even realises it. “So sanguine, are you? Think it’s all just a game?”
“Perhaps,” Luna offered, and climbed to her feet, “if you know why, and you don’t want to hurt people, and you’re the kind of person who can change, you already know what to do.” She leaned forward to kiss the top of his head, and disappeared back into the flames.
He wants Potter in his mouth, but he doesn’t want it to end. Wants to watch him come, wants to taste him, wants to bring him, trembling, to his knees, but he doesn’t want to stop. Potter’s cries are too sweet, his begging too precious.
Draco closed his eyes and let himself sink into the tub until the water came up to his chin. He ran a hand over the five tender points on his chest. The Dittany was already shrinking the blister that had formed over his second rib. He didn’t let his hand sink any lower. Didn’t need that confirmation to know exactly what his body thought of Potter.
Draco was sure enough of what he’d felt to guess at what Potter was seeing. He watched Potter’s face change from shocked to horrified. Watched him take a step back, and then another, and then he turned and ran for the Manor, disappearing into his rooms and slamming the door behind him so firmly it must’ve taken his whole weight.
suggesting that Potter has found his own tailor and is investing rather seriously in new robes. Draco finds the latter particularly interesting because Lovegood and the
She shook her head. “Besides which, what if it is disruptive? Did it never occur to you—it is all such a distant memory to you that you’ve completely forgotten—that the Ministry might not be entirely keen on respecting the wishes of a couple of ne’er do well former junior Death Eaters? That there might be things it’s unwise to tell the Ministry?”
“And it’s a bastion of goodness now?” I held my breath while he considered. It was entirely possible that Potter hadn’t picked up a Prophet in months and even more likely that he avoided the political reporting hidden in the back pages.
“Well.” Draco shifted in his seat. “To be entirely candid, I’m fairly certain you’re not going to like it. And, as you’ve already made your choice, it’s not relevant, is it?”
Draco sniffs. “Yes, well, as I’ve said, it’s generally against departmental protocols to let members of the public leave the front office.”
“Seriously, Malfoy? Are you still 11? So stuck in your own world you can’t see what’s right in front of you?”
He wonders if there’s more to be made of the photos. Potter’s got a pathologically overdeveloped sense of honour, and the press really didn’t turn out as well as it was meant to have done. Maybe Potter could be persuaded that it’s only right to go to another ball together, to try again.
The way he handles books, though. Harry had never really seen Ginny handle books, at least not so far as he can remember. He must have, at some point. But it wasn’t quite so memorable. Wasn’t quite like this, the way Draco moves so precisely, the way he uses one finger to tilt the books back off the shelf, the way he
Then she comes over here when she knows I’m revising for Arithmancy and bends over across the table just so, so I could see the glimmering edge of the key sitting between the swell of her breasts, and asks if I’m ready to reconsider last night’s wager.
Harry found Malfoy’s silence unnerving. He tried again, urged on by the same electricity that had pushed him to every sort of edge since he and Malfoy had been locked in together. “C’mon, Malfoy. Caring isn’t exactly your thing.”
Visitors would as well, he was sure of it. Already, in the soft open, it had been a massive success and he knew that word was quickly making its way amongst students and parents and professionals alike that if they came to
What I’ve learned, over the course of these months, is that he really does mean it. All this tripe about love…he really believes it.
“No, I’m pretty sure stubborn is the word for someone who will come up with any excuse to say no. If you don’t want to go out with me, just fucking say so!”
He keeps ruffling the back of his hair, resting his hand on the nape of his neck when he’s speaking. Wonder if that’s how my fingers look when we kiss, though they’d be paler against his skin.
Draco grabbed the pillow, laid down, and stuffed it back over his eyes. “It would seem the logical answer is to just give him the bloody Wand.”
“Of course.” Potter plasters on a smile that looks more psychotic than pleased. “How could I forget?”
Hermione jumped in before Ron could answer. “There have been several recorded cases where killers have volunteered information to law enforcement offices, Harry. Even worked with them. There are some serial killers for whom it’s part of the thrill. Getting close to the case, keeping track of the investigation, planting false information.” Hermione pulled a fortune cookie towards her and started playing with the corner of the wrapper, looking at it instead of at Harry. “There’s no way to know that’s not the case here.”
Regardless, Potter was gone, off to shower and do whatever else he was going to do. Sleep through the rest of their Merlin-forsaken night together, maybe. He could leave on his own whenever he woke, and they’d never have to see each other again.
It didn’t seem to be moving, as a bird would, nor was it a trick of the light. It was just suspended there, unnaturally, and Harry was overcome by cold fright and the urge to run towards whatever it was that was hovering, potentially helpless, above the marsh.
“We’ve got students to save and Basilisks to vanquish. And I believe I’m supposed to plunder your arse while we’re at it. Or are you just here for the company?”
“Right. Er, do we – should we, that is...?” Harry turned and gestured back and forth in the space between them.
Draco is startled into looking at him. “Thinking of it, or did it? Is that thing sitting in my department again?”
And anyway, Malfoy was acting like he was thick, which was just not on. Not when Malfoy’s whole explanation of the whys was basically beyond comprehension. Besides which, Harry thought, it was pretty dodgy to put together a bunch of random shapes and colours and then expect someone to add their own meaning.
Just interrupted to let me know she’s having a shower. Something about a long, sweaty dueling practise, needing to rinse off, blah, blah, invitation to join. Her pouting and whining is really rather extreme, and not especially arousing.
Blaise had picked the spot, a Muggle gay club in Brighton that was popular with the wizarding crowd and close enough to the beach to allow for discreet Apparition. It was clearly chosen with Draco in mind. He didn’t object.
He dismisses the idea as quickly as it comes to him. Their job is almost over and Potter will want to finish it and be on his way.
Draco sighed and levitated their drinks towards them. Pansy snatched hers so firmly that her ring echoed against the crystal. Blaise was more composed, though first among them to take a sip.
It was barely a minute—a panicked, breathless, never-ending minute—before Ron’s face appeared before him, groggy and concerned. “Harry?”
“Who cares?” Croaker asked no one in particular. “Re-scheduling the surgery can’t be that difficult. And the rewards—” he paused and corrected himself. “The potential for innovation is almost unimaginable.”
“Art,” Draco said. “It was like magic, only I knew they couldn’t do magic. And they tried so hard, and did so much, to make it anyway. Like this.” He gestured around the room. “This took weeks for the artist to build. Every pane and every light is painstakingly placed in just the right place. She thinks about every colour and every angle, and spends days upon days on ladders and floors, contorted and in the dark, to make it possible for other Muggles to see the world the way she does, and to feel something this vast and impossible.
Draco glanced back towards Potter, whose firm nod almost distracted from a beseeching sort of expression.
Draco turned back to the kitchen. Pansy was gaping. Blaise and Millie had matching expressions of surprise. He took a step into the room. “What?”
Draco handles the leather expertly, then unfastens his trouser buttons with a series of deliberate pops that leave Harry’s mouth watering.
. A mother he could forgive. “They went about it differently. He was all violence and political manipulation. Easy for people to see. But she was just as involved. For her, it was money—making it, moving it around, using gifts to turn the right blind eyes—and social pressure, to get other families to fall in line. But she loved the power of it, and she thrilled at the stories of torture and war. She wanted me to follow in those footsteps.” He looked Potter in the eye. His mother had told him, full of pride, how she’d manipulated both sides at once to save his life. “She wanted me to live, even if it meant saving you, so that I would follow in those footsteps.”
Potter looked around frantically. “There,” he said, pointing at the bit of singed hay. “I did that, didn’t I?”
After so many years spent worrying that his instincts were evil, Draco wasn’t sure he could trust the fluttering seed of hope behind his sternum.
“All the same spells again. Lumos to start, a patronus, levitation, and then I’ll ask you to end a spell of mine.”
Draco folds his hands on the counter and looks at the door. “Ministry heating and cooling charms are set to a standard eighteen degrees, while hallways are maintained at sixteen degrees. Ministry visitors are asked to help maintain those temperatures by closing doors at all points of entry and egress when they are not actively in use.”
“I do, remember? That you’re on that list of people—very short list of people—who I don’t have to lie to, or bend over to please?”
This, Draco will admit, if only to himself, is something he thought about. Harry, naked save his boots and trousers, kneeling over him, about to take down his flies and reveal himself. Draco thought about it more than once. His cock twitches at the sight. Years in the making, and it’s just as good as he imagined.
“You mentioned apologising to her. Do you actually want to? Or do you just think you should? I was under the impression that your comments were not entirely undeserved.”
Croaker slid off his corner. “It’s been too long,” he added without extending a hand, for which Draco was grateful.
“Draco. You know there’s something to be said for that. And we’re going out tonight. Greg has an early job, but Pansy and Blaise and I. Come with us. Just for a few hours. Clear your head. You can be back here first thing in the morning. Tell Galder to bring you up a tray at 7, or 6. Whatever you need to do. We’ll get you home early. But come out.”
“Yes, I’m calling you dense! You’re so bloody focused on doing things the way you like them that you refuse to see anything else! It’s not always black and white! It’s not always the kind of battle where you get to slay the villain and save the day! There’s a problem that runs deeper than anyone’s willing to admit, and no one in your precious Order could do anything about it even if they wanted to. I’m just about the only person who can!”
The photos. The photos, which feature Potter doing this exact same thing with someone else. With Lee Jordan, whom Potter has been so eager to protect.
“So when it comes to blowing things up, there may be a third thing happening there. Wandless casting is one. The Elder Wand amplifying your magic is another. The Elder Wand potentially having amplified negative feelings more than positive ones is another, and one we can work to rectify.”
Potter’s on his third biscuit by the time they reach the liquor aisle. Potter’s scepticism about it had been enough to make Draco insist.
I’m almost too fucking dazed to pull out, half tempted to collapse on top of him and be done with it.
Draco reminded himself that he was perfectly in control. Even as his cock twitched, even as he found himself at a loss for words. He gripped his tie to steady his hands and pulled it free of its knot, leaving it to hang on either side of his chest. “Yes.”
"Actually—" Malfoy began, then stopped as Harry added pressure to his touch. Malfoy worked his mouth wordlessly, then reached out to thread his fingers through Harry's hair.
Hosting this part of the show had been the easiest decision Draco had made since the Dark Lord crossed the threshold of his childhood home. He’d courted the artists’ collective for half a year before they’d agreed, and once they did he’d had the paperwork drawn up within the day. He’d badly wanted a garden somewhere on the property, but having an open roof had been out of the question; the odds were too high that wizarding types would appear there out of nowhere, stranded and possibly splinched by the anti-Apparition charms the Ministry had put in place.
Draco doesn’t react to his near-fall, just stands there, stock straight, looking into the middle distance
I didn’t know quite what to tell him. I wanted him to touch me, but the thought of it was overwhelming. I’d become quite hard, obviously, and it was clearly visible to him. His hesitation didn’t feel like it came from fear or disinterest so much as uncertainty about how to proceed.
Draco struggled up to his elbows. His cock twitched in Harry’s hand when he saw that Harry had undone his own flies, had wrapped a hand around himself and was working his prick slowly. Draco’s breath stuttered. “Merlin, fuck.” He swallowed. “Cause if you don’t, I’m gonna come in your mouth.”
He looks from Pansy to Blaise and back again. He thinks they mean it. He thinks, at a minimum, that they look curious enough to do it, and wouldn’t that be a disaster, even if the whole thing’s been coiled so tightly in his chest that he can’t really find it in him to object.
Draco hums and reaches out to grope the bedsheets for his discarded belt. He thinks Harry is wrong about that. He also thinks the brooms can wait.
Draco is trying, too. It’s the scariest and best thing he’s ever done. Even if it meant spending a week walking around in a constant state of exhaustion from middle-of-the-night Howlers.
Draco rested an ankle on the opposite knee. “Do you remember, Auror Robards, when the French authorities caught Rookwood?”
“You have to admit there’s a certain poetry to it. Not even Ludo Bagman would’ve put odds on this particular role reversal.”
Draco pressed his finger forward. “I’m going to be inside of you,” he whispered, making good on the promise. His finger slipped past the tight ring of muscle and he bit back a groan when he felt Potter’s arse, warm and smooth, around his finger. He slid out, and back in. “So deep inside of you.”
“Streets. My flat, if you want to walk me home. Or we turn right and on to the Rue Bonaparte, if you’d like to walk back to the hotel, with company or without. Or there’s Apparition. There are cafés, too, though they’ll be closed by now, and a few bars that won’t be.”
This kiss is slow, deliberate. When Harry opens his mouth, he’s met with the soft heat of Draco’s tongue. He takes Draco’s hand in his and squeezes, and feels the pressure returned.
“Draco,” he murmurs, “I want you. I’ve been wanting you for weeks. I’ve been dying for you since you ran off on Tuesday.”
“Even if it’s just one night, it is my first night, with a man. I’d like that to be with someone—well.” His cheeks pinked. “Someone I’m attracted to. Someone I want to be with. But also,” he rushed on, “someone I trust, who treats me like an equal. I don’t know when I’ll have that chance again. And I’d rather know, I think, what it’s like. What it’s like when it’s good, which, I do think—” He sat up straight and looked at Draco. “I do think it would be good. Do you think…?”
Potter’s body is a thing of beauty. I’d always thought he’d be scrawny; perhaps the impressions of our youth don’t leave us as easily as we might like. But three years of Auror training – and, I suppose, a war – have done well by him. His arse is firm and high, his waist trim, back muscled, his legs toned. I’ve never had the opportunity to take him in like this.
Potter probably does want something secret and that’s all. Maybe they’ll meet here, or in Potter’s beloved mausoleum. Or, no, Potter won’t even want him there. The house is under a famously strong Fidelius charm, there’s no way. They’ll meet in the rooms above the Hog’s Head, that’s more likely. They’ll be filthy and Draco will get bed bugs.
This client has given up on the bell and turned to study the wall, so it’s his back Draco sees first. His back and his hair, shaggy shocks of black stuck up every which way on top of a compact frame. All of it is dreadfully familiar. He’s only got a split second to gather his wits before the man turns to reveal green eyes and wire-rim spectacles and a stupid, shocked expression that rekindles every ounce of loathing Draco has ever harboured for him.
Draco’s face and stomach fall in unison. The ice in his voice is entirely genuine. “How many things?”
Harry shook out his limbs. “Yeah, a bit.” He grinned. “Not gonna get in the way of your performance, is it?”
By the time it’s over his head, Draco’s shirt is buttoned, but his tails hang loose around his hips and his hair is still tousled. It’s a sight Harry thinks he could stand to see more of.
Still, he feels more scrutinised than scrutinising. Still, his pulse pounds as he waits for some response.
He didn’t notice my silence until he noticed that I’d stopped working. It was my brush he followed, first and foremost. When he saw that it had stilled, he turned to me. Smiled. “C’mon,” he urged. I began, in that moment—that guileless, irrepressible moment—to believe in Harry Potter.
“Not to mention the ethical considerations. If his reactions to me are triggering outbursts I really shouldn’t continue on in my current capacity.”
Except that he thought, insofar as he’d let himself think it, that that’s what made it so dangerous. That it was seeing Potter like this that had got him hooked, that had him wanting there to be some reason for this mission to last. For it to bring them together at least long enough for him to memorise the smoothness of Potter’s sleepy brow and the rise and fall of his chest as his breathing grew shallower in the night.
His formerly reasonable pile has grown. Multiplied. Expanded. The knickknacks have started mating, or the chairs have recruited an army, or there’s been some sort of appliance-related coup, or the dais has developed a growth or
Suddenly, he’s twenty again. Or, the version of him in the Pensieve is. Twenty and just this side of properly drunk and leaning against Harry Potter’s kitchen worktop with a pint in one hand, and laughing at some inane joke of Potter’s. He was so full of them, all the time. In those days Harry’d been so eager to laugh. To make Draco laugh. Desperate for it, almost. And he’d succeeded, time and again.
“Maybe.” Harry lifted his shoulders. “Is that what you want to focus on when I’ve said I’ll come up to your flat?”
Draco found himself, after another very sound night’s sleep and a perfectly respectable amount of elf-made raspberry jam, back in front of Potter’s sitting room door.
“Everything you’ve said speaks to their competence, Potter. Which, A, is frankly laughable considering our current circumstances, and becomes more of a joke with every meeting. And, B, says nothing of their character.”
“Great.” Harry smiled. “That’s really great. Really. A really big relief, and I’m really grateful, especially since you don’t really want to, I know it’s a big deal and I really do want you to know how much I appreciate it.”
It was just that he’d reached a point of reassuring himself out loud, and Pansy’s presence made him feel less destined to become one of those portraits that earned eternal exile to the attic.
Harry rested his hand on Draco’s chest, five warm points surrounding his heart. “Depends on what you do with it.”
But, he reminded himself, joys of adulthood: his cock didn’t have to run the show. And, Potter’s incorrect accusations of cowardice aside, he could leave if the whole thing got out of hand.
Potter tugged at the buttons on Draco’s shirt, seeming to remember only halfway through that he wasn’t supposed to be eager. He slowed, but the message had already been sent, and Draco heard it perfectly. Saw it perfectly, as Potter brought a sliver of his chest and stomach into view.
Harry shifted nervously. Draco saw him try to focus his energy, to take deep breaths. Harry had to look away from Granger to do it, but Draco thought he wouldn’t have done a month ago. It was some sort of progress.
Harry scanned the room for something he could use to hold Malfoy in place. There weren't any curtains, no reason for there to be rope lying around, and he didn't want to pull his wand.
And if there was any doubt, his face when I told him was its own argument. He fell back into this incoherent rage befitting the Trolls and Hippogriffs with whom he insists on fraternizing.
“Fuck.” Draco’s head rolls back. If they’re going to do this, might as well really do it. He props his head on his forearm, lifting up so he can see Harry work. “Right then. Take my belt off.”
Potter moaned and rolled his hips again, whining when he met with Draco’s knuckles instead of his prick.
Harry relaxes and does as he’s told. His cock springs free, hanging hard and heavy over Draco’s face. He digs his fingers into Harry’s long-since discarded jumper, resisting the urge to reach up and lick. He hums. “Take it in your hand and bring it to my mouth. Just the tip.”
Instead, he’d stared at Draco the whole time. Unabashedly. Openly. Except when Draco looked back, of course.
“Yes.” Potter rushed to catch up. “Right. Er. Yes, they did answer quite a few of my questions, thank you.”
No, Draco doesn’t mind at all. He’s fairly certain his teenaged id is pretty fucking pleased, as a matter of fact.
“It’s not so simple, unfortunately. My magic… It didn’t come up while I was in the void, for obvious reasons, but Healer Barrett still doesn’t think it’s wise for me to Apparate if I can help it, and never to unfamiliar places or more than once at a go or for very long distances or when I'm physically or magically exhausted. He’s worried, as am I, about what happens if something goes wrong while I’m Apparating or on a Portkey or in the Floo. Not that it’s likely, but that, moving so quickly and covering so much ground, if it did happen, there could be a lot of damage.”
“So I stayed.” Malfoy went on, as though completely unaware that the air had been so thoroughly knocked out of Harry that he thought his lungs might be threatening to stop as well. “It was useful, in the end. You’d made it clear that I wasn’t to you what you—” Malfoy shifted uneasily, extending an arm for Edgar. “That ours was a passing acquaintanceship for you, and that I ought not rely on it.” Malfoy sniffed, and Harry was fairly sure it was more out of haughtiness than any of the alternatives. “It was best to end that acquaintance. I finished the application and was admitted. I devoted myself to my studies and excelled. We had always had Crups at the Manor, as well as Kneazles, peacocks, and Abraxans, and I’d been trained to oversee care of the grounds, with all their pests.” Malfoy gave a dry snort. “When not confronted with life-threatening ones in the middle of a class, I’ve always been good with animals. I sent an owl to the fellow who used to help birth foals at the Manor, and he was kind enough to make an introduction. As it turns out, Cambridge has a magical wing as well as the Muggle and, academics being as they are, they were more interested in my marks than my involvement in the war.”
Slowly, Edgar flew lower, skirting the waves and then turning again, flying back towards the marshes.
I’ve found the time moves much more quickly, and conflict is effectively sidestepped, by making full and proper use of our private bedrooms. That may be the best thing to come out of this all. Especially since Pansy’s tits aren’t just for show, and having my cock down her throat does shut her up well enough. School is rather a different experience when you’re of age. And not in the middle of a war.
“You don’t,” Harry insisted. “Of course you don’t. Bugger.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ve already cocked this up.”
We’ve played four games now. This was the fourth. A Friday night. Crisp. Chilly. There’s a party in the common room. He didn’t want to go. He wanted to be with me, to play Quidditch with me, under the stars. To have – last time he brought cocoa, of all things. To have cocoa with me.
The fact of the matter was—as he, being nothing if not self-aware, had quite accurately predicted whilst writing the list two weeks ago—that he wasn’t entirely ready to face the Manor. Certainly not to step out into the foyer and be in the middle of it all. If it had changed, he’d be forced to consider how long he had been away. If it hadn’t changed, he’d be immediately assailed by the sort of memories that were best confronted one at a time. It would still be better than going to the Ministry—condition number four had stipulated that he would never need to do that—but he at least needed to ease himself into it a bit.
She set her fork down with unnecessary force. “You haven’t exactly made a point of emphasising hospitality to anyone but Potter.”
“I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want,” Harry repeated. “Some things that it’s been difficult to realise. Not because I don’t think they’re true or I’m uncertain of them. I am. Certain of them, I mean. More because they were unexpected. I didn’t know what to do with them.” He half-laughed. “I’m not sure I do.”
“Yes, I think so.” Harry comes towards him under pretence of examining the desk. “Not sure, though.”
Draco knows Pansy is still not wholly at ease with Harry. She doesn’t believe that he’s really joking about it, and in fairness to her, Draco’s thinks Harry’s jocularity is a bit dark at times, and not unintentionally.
He stared down at Sydney. He’d been a good enough looking bloke at the club, and he wasn’t bad in the light of the kitchen either. Soft hair, soft mouth. It was good. This was good.
“Let me guess,” Blaise continues. “Potter came round for an apology, expecting, perhaps, an apology of the heartfelt and comprehensive variety, and instead you offered him—what? A retraction of sorts?”
“Oh.” Harry drops his hand. Draco winces when the cloak puddles on the floor, but covers it with his best imitation of patience. Harry lifts his arm immediately. “Sure. Yes. Draco. I would. I mean, I would like to have lunch with you.”
Though he had been watching Harry throughout the conversation, Draco was surprised when Harry’s gaze flicked over to him. He looked almost pleading, and definitely hesitant. Draco gave him a nod, which he hoped would communicate, “you can do this,” rather than, “not my problem, get back to it.” All of which left Draco feeling as unsure as Harry looked.
“No!” Granger paled. “Our teams do have some understanding of anatomy, for Merlin’s sake. The goal is not to keep him from being able to move.”
“I’d like to take your vitals outside of the void. There shouldn’t be a difference, but it’s better to be certain. Though if you’d rather go inside, that’s fine. And you can, of course, decline.”
And then his hand starts moving again, taking Harry firmly in his grip and sliding over his shaft, running a thumb over his slit. Harry’s balls are tight, almost aching. “Please,” he moans. He wants to come, wants to share Draco’s post-coital bliss.
That startled Potter into action. He covered his eyes and mouthed “Sorry,” over and over again, and started to back slowly, as silently as he could, out of the room. When he had to uncover his eyes to make his way, Draco saw that he looked thoroughly mortified.
He won’t let it show. Instead, he recovers his pleasant smile. “All the more reason for you to learn the art of tablesetting. Always wise to improve one’s –”
“Will you be retrieving them while I turn into an icicle, or will you be inviting me in before I freeze to death?”
“A colleague of mine, Luc Reynard, had gone to Annecy for a holiday and wound up queuing behind him at a patisserie in Mentheon-Saint-Bernard. He’d done a bit of research on the war for his work on curse-related scarring and recognised the face. Waited until Rookwood left the shop, cast an Incarcerous, end of. Consider Potter’s fame relative to Rookwood’s. How long do you think it would take for someone to notice him? For word to get out?”
Draco is still wondering about the usefulness of fear when he knocks on the door to 12 Grimmauld at 5 to 8 the next evening. Even with a lengthy afternoon nap, he’s vibrating with exhaustion. And excitement. And terror. And the strength of a resolution made in the middle of the night to, if he can’t be properly fearless, at least be properly fearful. To do whatever makes him most afraid.
Harry straightened against the back of the settee and pulled a brown kitten into his lap. “I’ve been seeing the Mind Healer.”
Granger leaned forward urgently. “We can offer you resources, assistance, access to magical artefacts that—”
“A complaint, then? Of course you’d have a complaint. Well, fine then. I can give you the form for that.” Draco begins shuffling around in the parchment under the counter.
Some of the stuff you’ve written in here – it’s pretty mean, Draco. I kind of guessed you were up to something when you started being weirdly nice to me back in September. No offence, not that you’d even necessarily take any at this, but it just really wasn’t like you to just be friendly like that. Picking stuff up for me and saying hi and the like. It just wasn’t very you. And after all these years of fighting, I guess I already knew you pretty well. And Ron and Hermione agreed about all of it, and I guess they know you too. I guess fighting in a war with someone lets you know them pretty well.
Slowly, so slowly, he trailed his index finger around and over Potter’s hole. When he slipped inside, it was Potter who took him there, who canted his hips so that Draco’s finger slipped into his rim, and Potter who pushed down until his fingertip was inside. He didn’t need more of an invitation. He slid halfway in and, at Potter’s moan, all the way.
Potter gaped at that. It was delightfully guileless, and Draco’s stomach graduated from somersaults to cartwheels.
Draco felt the corner of his mouth quirk upwards in spite of his best efforts. “I do so hate it when I’m right.”
“Nothing.” He leaned against the window, his back to Draco. “I’ll think about what you said, but without an alternative…”
They both look up when Harry bursts through the door to find them standing, quite respectfully, on opposite sides of the counter. “Er.”
“To make the world safe for Muggles and their creations, which is, I’ll point out, exactly what I’m trying to do here.
With a huff, Draco turns to face the back of the chaise, curling around the bottle. Potter may be, well, Potter, but that doesn’t mean he can’t figure his wardrobes out on his own.
Pansy fixed him with a scrutinising gaze. “Gregory is in the conservatory, having breakfast with Potter.”
It must’ve shown on his face, he thought, as Harry looked up at him a bit bashfully. “I know it’s not on the list of things to practise, but I thought, maybe…”
My hand drops lower still, and lower, until it’s the back on my knuckles rubbing against his bollocks, until I run my thumb over his cleft.
“Strip.” The command is decisive. Harry sheds his jeans as quickly as he’s able, cock twitching towards Draco as soon as it’s free.
Neither Potter’s proximity nor his vehemence stands a chance of selling me on that particular idea. It’s love, not dragon pox. They may be equally dangerous, but the former is hardly as contagious as the latter.
Everything I can think of is too dark to belong here. And I don’t want that. Not distraction. Not darkness.
Of course Malfoy would know the inside of his house. The bastard. “She certainly won’t let go of the past. And if you’re such an expert, you can’t tell me she exists as a passive object.”
He looks up at me and he’s wild-eyed, suddenly, gripping my shirt, grabbing my jaw and pulling my face in line with his. “No, No— that’s not. It’s not that, fuck, it’s not that.”
They stand there, pointedly not looking at each other, until Potter tries again. “I just didn’t recognise it.”
Pansy flushed, and he could tell her voice was carefully controlled. “England is my home. I won’t let them drive me out.”
Bringing his other hand to Harry’s other side, Draco tugged on the hem of Harry’s jumper and looked at him questioningly.
“Though this seems to have been glossed over at the Department of Mysteries, you’re not required to do to everything anyone asks of you. You can refuse consent and I won’t do them.”
“Our end is to protect each other. To rebuild a magical Britain where we are as one. What role does blood have to play in that pursuit?
Maybe it’s not intuition. Maybe he’s slipping Veritaserum into my drinks. Must be, because I just told him I didn’t like it much, the honesty. Which means I admitted to it. Which means I admitted to being dishonest at other points. Which doesn’t bother me nearly as much as it should, perhaps since I’m increasingly certain that he already knew.
The heat of Malfoy's skin came through the thick cotton of his shirt when Harry laid two careful fingers on his chest. It disappeared when Harry ran them over his waistcoat, and it wasn't until that sensation, that certainty that it was Malfoy's skin underneath all those layers, had disappeared that he knew with certainty that it wasn't just that he wanted to look at the suit, or touch it, but that he wanted to take it apart.  He stepped closer again, pressing himself against it — against Malfoy — and bringing both hands to the first of those six buttons. They slid open as easily as the one on his trousers had, popping free one after the next with a quiet whisper and no resistance from either the fabric or its wearer. Harry pressed in again, feeling Malfoy's body through his chest, now. He began to slide his jacket off, wanting even more of it, when Malfoy spoke.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, no. As you so kindly pointed out last time, this ritual may require exceptional endurance. And, well. Your arse is rather tight. And it’s necessary to take all due precautions.” Harry looked at him, brow furrowed. “Oh, never mind. I’ll put it on myself.”
Potter stopped moving immediately. “It’s fine. We can go back in. Do you have all the data you need?”
Potter glanced over his shoulder, then turned back, brow furrowed as if he was trying to figure out what question to ask first.
Which means Harry’s gut is only twisting because this is awkward, trying to decide what to do now. Draco gets annoyed when he rings the bell, but he also gets annoyed when Harry just goes back there to find him, but he’ll probably also be annoyed if he comes up front and finds that Harry’s been loitering in the office without saying anything
“Oh.” Draco’s thoughts return to the tea he’d been craving. Maybe they could take tea together after all. There are several kettles over in kitchenware, and apparently Potter’s favourite biscuits are already here.
“There were a series of sketches depicting crime scenes related to the murders the DMLE has been investigating.”
He replaces his wand. Potter is still staring at the now-clean spot, his mouth hanging open just far enough for Draco to be tempted to stuff one of his quills into the gap.
“‘Let what go?’ What do you think? All of it. As long as I’ve got this, as long as I’ve got anything they want, they won’t stop. Not with me, not with anyone I love. Never.”
He wonders if it’s the same bed. If it’s still there. If Harry still needs a glass of water next to the bed, and still ends up sleeping at a diagonal.
“I’m telling you, my theory is right. We have a root cause. We can treat that instead of removing the implant.”
“Good Quidditch days, basically. Clear, not so cold your fingers freeze or so hot they sweat around the broom.”
“Robards.” Wardwell didn’t budge, just held Robards’ steady gaze until he gave up on handing off the briefing.
“Oh?” Draco’s fingers felt like they were tingling. He couldn’t be sure it wasn’t the day’s exertion, or the Scotch. But he wouldn’t have bet on either.
It took all of Draco’s restraint not to bang his head into the doorframe. “I’m sorry. Merlin. I didn’t think you did mean—Perhaps I do need the break.”
, but it’s good. His mouth is so warm, it’s so tight, and the way he hollows out his cheeks to suck Draco down makes him want to moan. He can feel the sound forming in his chest, knows Harry wants it, how much Harry always wants it, and when Harry’s hand trails up his leg to cup his bollocks, it’s almost too much. He exhales, something guttural and animal that still manages to sound like Harry’s name, and the only thing wrong with this sound is that it makes Harry pull off. He smiles up at Draco and, with just a hint of hoarseness, asks, “More?”
Anyone else might’ve been surprised that Potter was waiting for me at my favourite tea shop the next afternoon, or that he so readily accepted an invitation to my workshop, or that he came unaccompanied and right on time. But I knew he would—that he would come and that he would listen. He’s inherently incapable of doing anything else.
You can’t help it. So you can’t help but see it when he turns to you. His shirt hangs to the sides of his chest now, he sweats, he glows, he gives you that smirk and a look and this one asks, “Scared?”
Millie and Blaise had pulled up stools and seemed to be watching with some fascination. Draco would’ve been annoyed, had he not been tempted to do the same.
Malfoy landed with a thunk, and Harry lowered himself between Malfoy’s knees, eyeing his flagging cock and settling back on his haunches. “If you’d just admit it, I’m sure we could find something to do about it.”
Any other commentary was lost to the guttural moan that came from Malfoy’s throat as he stilled, spilling into Harry’s arse and collapsing over his back.
“No.” Potter turned the apple over in his hands, pressing his thumb into a tender spot. “Too bad about the apples. Was wondering what they’d taste like off the tree.”
Draco snorted to cover his shock, and then naked thrill of Potter’s fingers digging into his flesh. “Surely there are better things you could fuck.” He trailed a finger across the thin line of bare skin above Potter’s collar, running his fingertips backwards until he was cupping Potter’s neck, until he could wrap his hand around the top of Potter’s spine and pull him in for another kiss. For all his readiness with a retort, Potter came into it easily, pressing his mouth hard against Draco’s, then rolling Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth, and that—that, Draco had never expected, and the nerves in his stomach melted into a pool of something searing and urgent. It was just a hint, but a hint of something he’d never imagined coming from the Golden Boy, who he’d been sure was given to either embarrassed fumbling or tender romance.
He wonders what it would look like. Would Draco’s fringe fall forward? Would his robes crease, or are they so starched that they would fall away from his body altogether? Would he have to take them off? What does he wear underneath them? Is that pressed and ironed too? Is there anything there at all, or is it skin, Draco’s skin? Merlin, how does he look under all that wool?
If he weren’t thoroughly homosexual, and she wasn’t completely preoccupied with Blaise, Draco would’ve gladly offered to sire her firstborn, complete with rights to any remaining Malfoy trusts.
“I realise it’s been some time since you’ve had cause to use these particular skills, and that they may bring up some unfortunate memories.” Harry opened his mouth to object, but the Headmistress held up a hand for silence. “We’ve all had that experience a time or two during the process of rebuilding. Perhaps you can find some solace in using Voldemort’s skill to undo his damage. And, while it may not be any more fair now than it was then, you are, I’m afraid, the only person who can complete this task.”
She paused, set her glass on the bar, and hugged him, burying her nose in his shoulder and holding tight.
He inhaled. Stepped past the posts, through the gates. Gravel crunched underfoot. It sounded strangely familiar. He knew that was preposterous; he’d walked on hundreds of gravel paths in dozens of estates and museums and gardens. There was no reason that the sound of French gravel should be any different to Wiltshire limestone.
Harry sat on the hearth until his legs were numb. Then he Summoned parchment and a quill and wrote another note.
“About the attic?” Harry asks, confused. He hadn’t planned to make that a part of their evening, and he's gripped with the worry that he may have overlooked something important.
“Fair enough,” Shacklebolt said into his silence. “But surely you understand that there are tradeoffs. I may want to protect Harry. I may want that very badly. But how to do that when it means refusing war orphans whose Quidditch league is cancelled due to lack of funding?”
Instead, he reached back and intertwined his fingers with Draco’s. He grinned when he felt a squeeze, and returned it, and pulled Draco’s hand towards him, and thrilled when the rest of Draco followed. Even through their jeans Draco’s thigh was warm against his own, and when Harry leaned closer he was instantly sorry to find that their coats were too thick for the same to be true of their shoulders. He turned to look at Draco, only to find that Draco had beat him to it.
He let the stairs echo behind him. Down past the galleries, past the plain white door to the infinity room, to the ground floor. They walked past his office—the thought that Potter might have left something of himself behind twisted at his stomach; he wasn’t sure if it was better or worse to have to leave that for another day—and towards the front room. Aside from the occasional scuff of heavy leather boots, Potter might have been Eurydice, floating silently behind him, daring him to look back.
“No.” He objected with an unexpected vehemence. “Something bigger, let’s—” he reached for my hand, twining our fingers together. “Just in case. Let’s make this one memorable.”
Potter reaches for the knife, sliding his fingers under Draco’s to grip the hilt. He brings it towards him, examining the blade. “So then the third?”
“Not really.” Harry put his cup down and leaned on the embankment. “I did like walking last night. And that bar, and the idea of it, being able to be out in public with another man—with you—and not having such a divide between the two worlds. Just about as soon as you said it, I liked the idea of being here again. But moving… Where did this come from?”
Draco had done it without thinking. He had acted impulsively—which never led to his wisest decisions—and he hadn’t anticipated a situation in which he’d slammed Harry Potter into a wall and had wound up holding him there, entirely unsure of what to do next.
“Finch-Fletchley’s a great cocksucker, decently intelligent, not bad to look at, reasonably well-positioned, and he was after you for years. Years when you would’ve done well to be seen with someone who hadn’t been a Death Eater. And a Muggleborn, at that. Always wondered why you wouldn’t give him the time of day.”
“Oh?” Draco perched on the arm of the settee. “In the gardens? After the…?” He trailed off and gestured at his chest.
Harry wanting him. Emboldened, he pressed forward and deepened the kiss, and Harry returned that too, all hands and tongues and warmth, that incredible warmth.
“Yes,” Draco answered, very intent on treading carefully. “I do. The Weasleys, Granger, everyone who came to see you. Teddy and my Aunt. I do.”
The night air hit him like a Bludger, but at least it did something to clear his head. He needed a walk, he decided.
He hooks his fingers under Harry’s waistband and doesn’t look away from Harry’s nervous, hungry eyes until he’s puled the elastic up and over his cock. His gorgeous fucking cock that Draco hasn’t set eyes on, outside of his own memories, since he was barely out of school.
“My whereabouts are hardly your concern. Though, now that you mention, I do have other portraits to visit.” Snape turned to Draco with a tight smirk. “The one in Paris, for example. Any messages to convey to your father? Beyond the obvious, of course.”
And if Father’s, “Cheers,” was more than a bit slurred, as his speech has been for days, and if Mother’s quiet crying is not constrained to holiday toasts…well. We are all still alive, and drunk and crying is still a fair sight better than living under threat of being eaten by a giant snake or tortured by his master. And I doubt, somehow, that living in that shadow of those years would mitigate either form of hysterics.
But faced with it, he’s almost afraid to touch it, just in case it should reveal that this too, is a memory. He’d tried it in the Pensieve once or twice, and his hand had met with air. With nothingness.
“Fine,” Draco groused, letting go of Harry so he could gather their cups. “There’s an alley back that way anyway, we can Apparate from there.”
Draco sighed. “I think the kittens will be fine overnight, if you’d like to keep them here.” He’d turned back towards the door when Potter’s question struck him. He spoke up to be sure Potter heard him. “And I wouldn’t have come back if I didn’t believe the other, too.”
Draco took a deep breath. “I’m saying, somewhat to my surprise, that I don’t think there’s any more work to be done here. You’ve done what’s needed. You can proceed on your own.”
“Yes,” Draco repeated. He didn’t look away, though it was harder and harder to stand Potter’s eyes boring into his. “I want it.”
“That Hermione, Ron, your parents, the Hogwarts ghosts, the Hogwarts portraits, and most of the wizarding world know we’re here together, and no one’s tried to hex us yet?”
The door slid open and Pansy appeared, in formal dinner robes and with Greg trailing behind her. Shock slid over her face when she set eyes on the table and its many place settings, but she met Draco with a blindingly, and almost certainly artificially, bright smile. “Whose friend?”
“No. And if you’re to seriously consider this case you will have to get over assuming that everything they do is wholly idiotic.”
When he came to the bottom, to a fire exit on one side and cinderblocks on two others, he turned around and started over.
Blaise shot Pansy an unambiguous warning look before turning to answer Draco’s question. “Not until the spring, I’m afraid. My work will keep me in the country.”
Draco’s client clears his throat. He looks Potter up and down with such unabashed lasciviousness that Draco’s skin crawls in sympathy; he clearly wants the great saviour’s attention.
We went on like that for I don’t know how long. More than a minute, less than an hour. The sun was still in the sky when he pulled back, breathing heavily, and caught my eye. He reached for my belt buckle and undid it. He became tentative for a moment, then, with one of his hands still holding the leather and the other on my flies. I nodded. He nodded back.
“Isn’t more…?” He looks pointedly at the very noticeable bulge that’s reasserted itself beneath my waistband.
“We all have our areas of expertise.” Potter gave another bland smile. “It’s not as though I have the training to tell specialised Unspeakables about wandlore or surgical procedures. And,” a note of fierceness came into his voice, “I trust them. They’re very invested in making sure I get the best care.”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s hand encircles his, guiding the knife back to the shelf. “Can you just stop for a second?”
“Harry.” Draco twined their fingers together and looked him in the eye. He hoped that said it all, but, he thought, just in case, “That’s not it at all. I want you.” He laughed, an unusually reedy, nervous sort of sound. “I can promise you it’s not that I feel like I should. If anything, the opposite. Not,” he went on at Harry’s frown, “that I would do it if it felt like it was wrong for any reason. But you… The way I feel about you, it’s not…” He paused. “When has it ever been that rational? It hasn’t started now, all of a sudden.” He blew out his cheeks. “I’m doing a crap job of this, aren’t I? But the point is, no, it’s not anything like that. I want to. Want you.”
Potter may think love will save us all, but it was Slytherin machinations – and a good dose of hate – that had him depending on love’s intervention in the first place. My attempts to get him on his own continue to prove that this slavish dedication to sentimentality mostly makes for credulity and hurt feelings.
Draco’s too tired to hide his disappointment when the morning passes without the arrival of Potter's owl or, more to the point, Potter, storming through the
Through it all, Potter’s eyes kept glancing towards the passers-by outside—any of whom could, in theory, be the killer—and Draco didn’t miss the way Potter’s hand rested in his lap, where he could fidget furtively with his wand holster. All of which was perfectly reasonable for an Auror on any other sort of mission, but Robards had been quite clear that this one was meant to garner public attention, and the only attention this would garner would inevitably paint Draco as a lacklustre conversationalist shunned by the Chosen One.
And when he closes his eyes, he still sees Harry’s skin, and the coarse hair on his thighs, and the tiny lines at the corners of his eyes that didn’t used to be there but are lovely all the same. And he thinks maybe it’s a fine line, really, between courage and fear. And he wonders if having one of the two—if letting himself acknowledge that he is, in fact, scared out of his bloody mind—could be enough.
immediately making a fool of himself hadn’t occurred, and it left him feeling strangely wrong-footed.
“You think I have a choice about this?” Draco keeps his voice low. Calm. “You think this is what I wanted to be doing?”
Draco worked on remembering what words were, and how to use them in ways distinguishable from self-immolation.
“In a world where Harry Potter claims he’s perfectly content to never play Quidditch again, it’s hardly the strangest thing going.”
Malfoy stopped short halfway through a sentence about the effect of dewy grass on low-flying snitches, snapping his jaw shut so sharply Harry thought he might’ve heard a crack.
Approaching carefully - Wheezes are an ever-present danger - he can't quite make it out at first. It's small and steely grey. It doesn't look like any Wheeze he's familiar with.
Why that ostentations Hallows replica gets her any credibility I’ll never know. Except, of course, I do; they’re all too foolish, too swept up in their saviour’s epic heroism, to think twice about it. Of
Malfoy’s story had been full of love. And humility. And appreciation. Awe, even. He hadn’t asked for anything, not directly. It sounded like he’d hoped, but he hadn’t asked. He’d told the story and left it in Harry’s hands, left it up to him to decide what to do with it.
And just like that, Draco is ice again, standing stock straight and moving on to the next thing. His withdrawal is so abrupt that Harry almost stumbles forward. He catches himself, only to be left staring at Draco’s receding back.
“European wizards are trained to use the humerus, radius, and ulna as primary conduits.” He pointed at his own arm as he spoke. “Implanting an extension of their wand against the proximal phalanges—the biggest part of the finger—pulls unpredictable magic through to the wand, which is how people are used to channeling their magic for casting. Having the Elder Wand, of all things, implanted next to a bone in a different part of the body seems to amplify your magic rather dramatically. The conductivity of bone plays a role there too. Had they done a conventional implant in the first place, or along with it—perhaps a series of them—it might have worked in essentially the same way. But that wouldn’t have resulted in wandless casting. That either comes from intensive training, as with a wizard like Dumbledore, or in extreme situations, or as a result of magical deprivation and the increased magical and physical awareness that results from being exposed to magic during and after it.”
He forced himself to shove the last 24 hours aside and slid into a mask of pure professionalism. “Time flies when you’re working tirelessly.”
After a call to Galder, his morning routine moved rather more quickly than usual. The Manor’s elves had been the envy of every British landholding wizard, and for good reason. He’d forgotten.
Harry’s chest surged at the feeling of Malfoy pressing back against him. It was an entirely different thing, this time, with Malfoy’s mouth moving against his. The charge of it skittered over his skin, urged him closer.
“Yeah, because I give a damn about someone other than myself! Lots of someones! No wonder it’s such a mystery to you.”
Draco looks at him. Draco doesn’t say anything. Harry, against his better judgement, begins to hope because, at last, Draco Malfoy has shut up.
Harry watched him tip his head back and down the remaining liquor. He slammed it down on the bar and swallowed. “Ready, Potter?”
Harry felt Malfoy squeeze a hand into his jeans and wriggled to try and make room. He imagined Malfoy’s likely reaction to the suspiciously well-squeezed container of Blackbeard’s Bottom Boysenberry Boy Butter he’d stuck in his pocket, just in case. He flushed when he heard a snort behind him, though Malfoy had the… well, courtesy was a strong word, but he coughed to try to cover it up. He rested what Harry assumed to be the the lid on Harry’s back. Harry heard a wet squelching noise, then Malfoy reached forward to shove the whole affair back in Harry’s pocket before straightening. “Alright, then?”
“You should try the coffee somewhere real next time. There’s a café near my flat—well, several, but a favourite one, if you’d want to.”
“It could have been any of those. You’ve come up with the one thing that lets you spend your time making money and hobnobbing with posh arseholes.”
The silence is starting to build. Draco thinks that’s not ideal. He also thinks he can do better. If the past is ill advised, perhaps the present. “Congratulations on the business. I hear your products are the most desirable for the modern potions maker.”
Malfoy laughed again. “All of this.” He waved an arm at the room, then dropped it back to his side with a thud as his arm hit the wall. “Everything I’ve told you. If you even heard it.” He shook his head and turned his eyes towards the ceiling.
He’s sick of the way Ron and Hermione walk on eggshells when someone brings up work or relationships or the war or anything else that fucking matters in their lives. He’s sick of the way Molly sends him home with leftovers because she thinks he won’t cook for himself. He’s sick of the way Arthur and Seamus and Neville and Dean and even fucking Ginny have taken him aside to reassure him that he’ll find someone someday.
It did little for his mood, though. As evidenced by his dinner companions’ collective reaction to his entry. Millie’s raised eyebrow and Blaise’s cautious scrutiny, Pansy’s open interest and Greg’s furrowed brow were certainly fair game when he’d banged the door open, shoved back the chair at the head of the table, and dropped into it with a dejected grunt.
The light at the tip of his wand—so familiar, even occasionally taken for granted after all these years—became a glowing ball, and then it became a thousand glowing balls, and then a thousand thousand. He laughed, delighted, and moved his wand. It trailed light through the air, through the glowing orbs, seeming to paint the whole infinite vista with light. He wanted to try an
Draco plasters on his sweetest smile. “Oh, of course. Pray tell, Potter, what are your problems, exactly? I shall endeavour to do my very best to solve them all.”
Circe, but Draco would be happy to let him play. He arched into Potter’s body, moaned when Potter nipped at his collarbone and grabbed at his sides. Grabbed back, and gasped at Potter’s throaty moan resonating through their chests. Slapped Potter’s arse, and lost his breath when Potter pressed back into it. Flipped Potter onto his back and held him there, settled his hips onto Potter’s hips and his hands onto Potter’s shoulders and felt all reason slip away when Potter arched up in search of touch. In search of Draco’s touch.
"Now you're getting it," Malfoy murmured, craning his neck until Harry felt the heat of breath and the warmth of lips against his jaw.
And really, that was probably why the whole business was lingering in his head in the first place. Who knew what would happen if Harry tried to ignore whatever message it was that Malfoy was trying to send? Malfoy was clearly a relentless sort of a bastard with questionable motives. And Harry had done enough negotiating to know that it was best to get out in front of that sort of thing, at least far enough to know what to expect.
Draco didn’t look up from his notes until Millie and Granger had taken their seats. He skipped greetings. “This doesn’t make sense.”
Draco shoved one arm and then the other through his crisply starched shirt and started on the buttons.
“I’m having dinner with Millicent and Granger. They’re both aware of your condition and have spent time with you regardless.”
Blaise quirked an eyebrow and left it at that, for a moment. “Regardless, do be careful. This is—well, really quite magnificent work you’ve done. I’d rather do ten detentions with Snape than see it undermined by a bit of red-and-gold righteousness.”
He followed suit, pulling his chair in quietly. “Do you intend to pout through the rest of the meal, or just the rest of the salad?”
“No.” Potter laughs, his breath ghosting over Draco’s neck, and Draco—older Draco—still remembers that better than he’d like to. The heat of it, the trace of hops. “Our wands, rubbing together.”
Then his fingers were nested between mine. He caught my eye and squeezed my hand and just…held it there.
“It’s always a pair of people,” Robards went on. “Three of the five have been romantic couples. The other two have been family members: a set of twins, and a mother and daughter.”
Draco steps out of his shoes and clothes and steps towards him. Harry’s half-convinced he’s going to faint. Draco steps between his legs and grips his chin. “Is this what you want?”
At last, Draco relents, dropping the poker back onto its hook with one last bang, and folds his arms. “Yes?”
Draco’s distraction stayed with him all day. Instead of taking notes during Chloé’s morning update he scrawled a quick “
He stopped and looked up, holding a mound of soil, a leaf dangling between his index and middle fingers.
It took three cups of tea before Harry was sure he could feel his toes again, and twice as many biscuits before he thought he might be able to speak.
. He hasn’t forgotten about Harry’s filthy mouth, but he has tried very hard not to think about it either. Didn’t think he’d hear it again.
Then he remembers that Potter has done it—had sent thirty messages that were open and caring, had put his heart on his parchment thirty times, only for Draco to
“Please,” Draco said. “Merlin,” he breathed, running his hands over Harry’s skin, holding him close to trace the line of his shoulder blades. He dropped his hands and traced the line of Harry’s ribs to his nipples and pinched. Harry arched into him.
"Except your insults, sense of humour, and pride, you mean?" Harry knew he was pushing his luck, that it was the sort of thing that might make Malfoy explode. He just wasn't sure whether he was hoping for it.
Harry heard something creak behind him and snapped around, wand in hand. There was nothing there. He crept towards the hallway, but there wasn’t any movement. Malfoy might still be asleep, just as he had been, arms splayed across the bed, head turned to one side, just as Harry had left him.
It certainly didn't help when Harry turned to him, a hint of softness at the centre of all that fire. "Gallery will be to your left. Hermione should be there, if you want someone you know to sit with. You'll watch for anything?"
“But I am sorry it had to come to that. And I wouldn’t wish that on you. Being wandless in a house with Voldemort.”
“But,” Draco continued, ”we also know that your magic has creative force. The kittens, the apples—when you feel affection or want something badly and let yourself experience that, you have tremendous constructive, reparative ability. It’s possible that you’ve used this more than you realise; a falling roof tile or a frozen bedroom is much more obvious than a blossoming flower or a ripened piece of fruit. But you don’t know
Potter clenched his jaw and shook his head, looking more and more like a tomato with each passing second.
“I know, that’s not – I’m not saying it won’t be. Just – look. I didn’t mean to be slowing you down. We can do this different. I can move faster. It shouldn’t be all your job just because I went a little wide with a Vanishing spell.”
