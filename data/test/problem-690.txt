“How the devil did you manage
His lips and tongue seemed to know which way to go on their own and Harry sucked, not caring the others could see him kneeling. Of course, they could only see the fluffy cloud of the charm on his face while his head was bobbing up and down the divine dick.
The Dark Lord´s voice was like ice to your ears on a winter´s day, frosty and painful, “You were given one task, Draco. To kill the headmaster.” Murmurs erupted everywhere from the light´s side. Not one single Death Eater moved. “Nine months, and not even one step closer to finishing that task.” Their Master´s fingers caressed his wand, well, it was Lucius´ really, like a lover. Draco blinked as he finally managed to stare up at the vile being.
He reached the fireplace and came to a halt before going through it.
Harry halted and sighed when Draco managed to cup his face and yank his mouth away from his body.
She patted his back. “I know sweetheart. Get some rest.”
Harry blinked as he stared down at the sitting blond. He looked like he owned the damn place all over again. His legs slightly apart, back straight and proud, one arm leaning against the side of the couch casually.
“Harry?” Hermione tentatively said, flanked by Ron, Neville, and Luna as they stopped in front of him outside the court room.
“What´s going on back
Please let me know how you like it.
Harry pulled away, clearly shocked at Malfoy´s sudden confidence. He had wanted to make Malfoy pay, he didn´t know why. Well, he did, because of the war, of course. Now, seeing the blond like this, cornered and actually challenging him, yelling straight at his face, was killing the mood.
“Bathsheba Babbling is in charge of Ancient Runes.” The middle-aged witch with short blonde hair nodded firmly to the crowd.
Draco had to smile when Harry spoke again.
Harry inhaled, and held the breath before exhaling slowly. Draco´s eyes narrowed in question.
“God… don´t stop…”
“Voldemort.” Harry took pleasure in seeing Malfoy flinch.
“I will.” Someone in the back said, loud and clear, making every head in the courtroom turn around.
Draco had no wand. Harry fucking Potter had taken it from him. The bastard.
Draco swallowed the lump in this throat.
“Mm.” Harry caught Draco´s soft lips for a brief kiss. “Make me yours…”
“You´re disgusting, Potter, I don´t do men!”
He wouldn´t have taken the Mark if he didn´t.
Loving the comments and the kudos - THANKS!
“Thus the reason for me being here.” She put her arm around Harry as she lay down beside him.
The crowd was in shock over what happened next.
He really had hoped that the blond was too ashamed to show his face at school again after what his family had done during the war; not to mention what Malfoy himself had done. It wasn´t that Harry was sorry that he had saved him from being burned alive; Harry was not that cruel even if it was Malfoy of all people. But, Harry simply wished that he didn´t have to look at his fucking face every single day and be reminded of every casualty from the Battle of Hogwarts.
Draco finally saw red. Not caring what he was about to do or what the possible consequences might turn out to be.
“It´s not even yours, it´s your father´s, so just-“
Ron studied the Ferret´s face for long moments after he had closed his eyes. What would bring Malfoy - an enemy - to trust him enough to do that?
even tried explaining that I could
know, however, that he had to speak to Malfoy and soon.
“So I´ve heard, but what does that–“ Harry sat upright so fast that he bumped heads with Draco, causing both of them to curse. “You want me to... -?”
Draco growled and yanked Harry on top of him, forgetting that Harry was once his rival, ignoring that Malfoys don´t bottom, and shoving aside their differences for now, because they had both agreed upon working on their flaws and learning what would be needed in order to live together. And who knows, maybe Harry
It was the first week of October before Harry knew it; that´s how fast the past week had gone by. The homework load had increased massively and Harry was mortified that he had to follow five NEWT level subjects: Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, and Care of Magical Creatures.
She smiled at what was about to happen. She was glad she had been given an excuse to take her leave; for the first time she was not sure that she would be able to keep her Malfoy mask in a straight face, which would not do.
inside the walls.
Taking a deep breath, he turned to face Harry.
“Are you okay? You look rather pale. More than usual. Maybe you should sit down,” someone said, and guided him to a chair, which he took. It would not look good should he faint. A hand on his left cheek woke him with a start from his trance. “Tell me what´s wrong, Draco.”
He sighed.
When his best friend finally did speak, Harry let out the breath he had been holding. “Then you fight for it mate.” And then he smiled at Harry, who smiled back.
Malfoy cringed his nose. “Lovegood,” he drawled, sounding as bored as he could, before resting his arm on the back of the couch casually. Nott and Blaise cheered him on.
“That´s hardly a new occurrence,” Draco tried to insult his nemesis like always, but it only received a small smile from the other male.
“Draco, come.”
You make me feel so good with your kudos and comments.
good on a broom on their first try Potter, it´s simply, ridiculous.” Malfoy sneered.
Draco shook his head. “No.”
… stop teasing… fuck me…” Draco grinned; he was going to make Harry weak from pleasure before the night was over.
Harry moaned to make Malfoy lose it; his control, that is. And he did.
“Come out to you,” Ron said, then burst out laughing at the double meaning of those words seconds after. And Hermione, bless her, lasted all but half a minute before joining Ron. Harry got up, scowled at them before leaving them behind to laugh it up. He exited the Gryffindor Tower, prepared to stay out until curfew. He wasn´t really angry, he was, sort of hurt, though not so much he would not get over it soon.
“Mr. Potter, need I remind you that you are under oath of this courtroom to speak the truth?”
“You will, as the new Malfoy heir, be in the center of society and you are expected to act civilized enough to not continue down the path of your past mistakes, naturally. You will spend the next year teaching potions and magical history to Muggle-born wizards in your own home.”
“W-what? No, it´s not alright! God damn you Draco, this was… was this… are you FUCKING kidding!? Did you just play me back there? Did you not…” He looked crestfallen.
Draco walked to his chair and grabbed the back. “That won´t satisfy the bloodline, you know that, you´re a pure-blood Weasley-”
The Hufflepuffs cheered seeing their score gain 50 points. For the first time, they were in the lead with something.
to close his eyes to calm himself.
“Wake up!” Draco kept shaking Harry and the Dark Lord laughed, most of his followers followed suit. Draco´s parents didn´t. They stared at each other, then at their weeping, grown-up son holding  Harry Potter tightly against his own body.
“Draco.” It was only one word. But it was his name, his first name, which not many would dare speak aloud. Not to mention, that fact that the blonde didn´t have many friends that would call him Draco in the first place. And now Potter of all people had the nerve to address him as such. And the worst of it, Draco didn´t seem to mind, even if he should have. Draco
Harry took his place in front of the chairman, standing where he had stood when he had defended Narcissa Malfoy. Draco would have to turn sideways in order to watch Harry, but he didn´t, which suited Harry just fine.
“God damn it – STOP!” Harry sucked one last time, before releasing the cock with a pop and meeting the grey orbs.
,” Harry pleaded and caused Draco to forcefully turn him around and capture his lips.
to cope with this year.” He glanced around as most nodded.
Harry´s parents were dead,
“That you´re a minute-man.”
his mother had done that to him in front of everyone!
I´m sorry I didn´t post yesterday as planned, I simple ran out of time!
Harry blinked as he glanced towards the scoreboards.
“You´re the challenger, I can´t be bribed to do something for you, it´s you who must d…” Harry was silenced by Goyle´s hand groping his dick through his clothes.
“Yes.he´s.a.fucking.natural.don´t.you.think?” Draco actually grinned. Harry was right; Finnegan
Harry rose and everyone stared as if the Savior had better things to do than to waste his time in the presence of a bawling infant. When Harry walked towards the Head table, murmurs of conversations began. Their new Muggle Studies professor rose and handed Harry the boy, who immediately nuzzled into him and fell asleep. To explain to those who were unaware, she said, “It seems convenient for an old woman to have the godfather of my grandchild in the same school, thank you, Harry.” Harry beamed and tightened his grip, not many 18-year-old males would want to be caught dead with such a small drooling pink raisin, but Harry loved his role and his godson.
“What!? It wasn´t for
Harry dodged a couple of fourth years and a bulky sixth-year male before they finally managed to reach the Malfoy heir´s dorm. Harry took a deep breath when noticing only two of the other four students present when he dropped the cloak.
“Yeah, later mate,” Ron turned and left them alone at Hermione´s wish. She and her boyfriend had been talking about the odd behaviour of their friend over the past two days, and Ron being, well, Ron, didn´t want to discuss ´this sort of thing´ with his mate, so it was basically up to Hermione.
“The Manor is huge.”
“Thank you…”
“Very well, Mr. Goldair and Mr. Witlin will be the Aurors with you at all times until we call you back.” He nodded to a dark-skinned, tall wizard who might have been an Auror for far too many years, judging from the greys on his almost bald top and a younger male who could have been an Italian.
Malfoy gasped and broke the kiss. “No, Potter. I… I can´t do that… It´s not… I need time to…”
“I had a terrible childhood, yes. I was starved, beaten, ridiculed, but mostly I was left to myself. I, too, was lonely for many years, but I once I entered Hogwarts I had friends everywhere. People who wanted to know me, to do things for me, and to act on my behalf, merely because I was famous. True, I found real friends too, and I didn´t need money or threats to achieve that. They wanted me for me, the real me, not the famous me, - and for that I am grateful.”
“Please, please,
“Do you have
“Draco, what are you-“ He sounded wounded and confused.
“Greg, I don´t…”
“Well, that´s who you are mate,” Ron stated unhelpfully. But Harry knew he was only trying to help, so he nodded instead of telling him off again.
It was so amazing to see that not one of the new professors were favoring any student. Not Ron´s mother, not Malfoy´s father; and not Ginny and Ron’s brother. It was as though all was fair and equal; as if everything had changed after the war. Well, it
Stroking that special spot again with his left fingers Harry sucked hard on the head still pumping Malfoy´s cock. Harry felt it soon after: the shakes of the blond´s legs while concentrating on keeping himself standing, his heavy breathing while he fought to keep his vocal outbursts in check, and the tightening grip in his hair. “Oooh god…”
Harry rolled them over. “ Why don´t we start right now then, alone this time?”
McGonagall paused before the next name, “Sybill Trelawney runs Divination classes.” More students groaned as the confused female stood and nearly fell backward before Hooch helped her back to her seat.
“Guess he liked what Malfoy had to offer,” the Irish howled with laughter at his own joke, before downing another beer and snogging the nearest female.
He met Harry´s eyes.
Potter had always been a thorn in his side, a pain in the arse – well,
friends for that, but they didn´t mind being sexual together like this.
be able to forgive him, even though he couldn´t stop loving him. Because he
“What do you want, Potter?” he drawled, not even stopping to find out until Harry put out his hand in front of Malfoy. They both stood there glaring at each other for a long while. “Potter, as much as I know you like looking at my handsome features, could you get on with it? I have other matters to attend to.”
“Maybe he just wanted to try it out? Or maybe he wanted to have a go at you in particular? You are
He wasn´t even convinced this was real. This was why he had not reacted, of course it was! Surely the two people he had been thinking about had not just wandered to this exact room and… “Merlin…” Harry finally breathed out when Goyle
Harry gulped, exhaled heavily and bit his bottom lip nervously while waiting for Draco´s words to reach his ears. Having had Draco around his horny teenage cock, knowing that Draco was about to reject him all over, was even more devastating than being without the experience at all. He sighed, letting his hands take what would be the final trip down the perfectly toned, porcelain skin of the snarky, snobbish Malfoy prince, a man he had never in his life imagined being allowed to caress, even for a minute.
Blaise grinned along with Greg, “What did you have in mind, Dray?”
“I´m gonna fuck you so good, that you´ll beg to bottom in the future.”
There it was again. His name, coming from red alluring lips. Lips he had been trying to run away from for the past two weeks. Draco closed his eyes, then maybe Potter would go away. “Draco, it´s alright.”
The blond´s eyes widened and his mouth fell open. “Why would I do that?” He asked when he had recovered.
“Are you not going to reply? We can´t get anything settled with a monologue.” He turned his body sideways towards Harry´s, his hands itching to touch.
Draco slid a thumb across Harry´s lips and Draco could feel the unshaven skin covering the chin. “I never had a clue about being gay until seeing your arse in the damn shower, and those dreams began tormenting me every damn night afterwards.” He heard Harry laugh. “At first I tossed the idea, calling it
Draco´s parents had never seen him cry before, not counting prior to his tenths birthday, of course. Neither had any of his friends for that matter. They didn´t know how to react or deal with this new Draco. Most were still dumbfounded, rooted to the ground in surprise.
Big mistake.
Draco flew backward and hit the ground right next to Ron Weasley, best friend of the man that had just been murdered because of Draco. Granger stood beside him, crying, just like Weasley. Both had their wands out. Draco had no way to defend himself and flinched back when Weasley moved.
of me?”
“You better swallow everything I give you, Potter.” Harry smirked when he heard those words. It was not because he would enjoy sucking Malfoy off, of course not. It was because Malfoy had caved, meaning Harry was one step closer to winning the game. Again, just like Quidditch.
“Seriously mate, that´s not even funny…” Harry´s green eyes met pale blue ones for a moment before he could answer.
Draco gasped as Harry sucked harder on the head. He could feel that this was Harry´s first blowjob, but because it was Harry, it was without a doubt the best he would ever have. Draco understood now why no Malfoy had ever married for love; the vibrations running through his body when Harry touched him were overwhelming; all consuming. The Dark Lord was right, love is powerful, but he was also so very, very wrong; it was not for the weak.
and his eyes.
And there it was. The question Draco would have to lie about when answering. Only he couldn´t lie. Not with Potter looking so damn kissable, not when his own body was aching to be touched by Potter, not when his heart was screaming at him that Potter was right.
“Go.”
Lucius Malfoy had been sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban the day before without the opportunity for any probation. Harry had not been present then. Lucius had gotten what he had deserved in Harry´s and many others´ opinions. And Lucius was a Death Eater to the core: a cold-blooded, delusional, greedy bastard above all. Harry had felt good once the headlines about it reached his doorstep this morning.
They didn´t hear the knock at the door or the male voice asking if he could come in.
(See the end of the chapter for

to take potions; he wanted more than anything to become an Auror, so he had to pass that, too. He could cope with an A, so he was struggling to keep that grade. He was happy with that until the Headmaster explained he had to receive an E on every exam, at the very least.
“On to Hufflepuff then. Hannah Abbott. Susan Bones. Justin Finch-Fletchley. Wayne Hopkins. Megan Jones. And Ernie Macmillan.”
“Father will-“
exist.” Harry met Ron´s eyes knowingly and offered a soft look in return since he could not pat his friend`s shoulder from across the table. Hermione rested her head on her boyfriend´s shoulder instead.
He blinked when the confused murmurs took over the courtroom and the chairman had to silence them.
Harry snorted. “We only wanked each other off, and he liked to blow me but I told him I didn´t want sex, not with
hoped that he would be able to cope when he was forced to take the Mark to keep his parents alive. But who was he kidding? He vomited when seeing blood, his dick wilted when he was ordered to rape, and his wand let out a cloud of embarrassing sparks when trying to cast the killing curse. Sometimes, when the Dark Lord had ordered Draco to torture, he was able to do it for a couple of minutes without getting sick.
Malfoy hissed, and Harry was sure that the blond didn´t even know he was being vocal, so who was he to tell him. Harry sucked the head into his mouth and ran his tongue down the underside of the now fully awoken member. “Shit,” Malfoy gasped, barely audible, but Harry heard it.
“´Mione…” Ron stopped her and she bit her lip.
“Yes, you do, and it´s okay. Draco, it´s okay to feel this way.” Draco felt his chin being grabbed and he opened his eyes. “I won´t let anyone hurt you over this. I love you.”
“I´m not the gorgeous stuck-up Malfoy heir who gets everything he wants, who nobody can give anything he has never gotten before, who has servants to do whatever he needs, with vaults so deep tha-“ Draco kissed him and Harry moaned around the warm lips.
A devastating roar filled the air and Draco saw Longbottom with a bloody sword and Nagini´s dead corpse. Voldemort was throwing curses at Longbottom - who managed to stay alive - and soon others joined in, fighting the most powerful wizard alive when, suddenly Voldemort froze and fell over, dead.
“With a boner. Why do you think I wanted to get on your nerves that much? For the same reasons girls moan over Snape, of course.”
The Death Eaters that hadn´t been killed or captured already fled.
He gulped and flushed, then downed the drink he was offered in one go.
“No, Harry, all my life people have been sucking up to me –“
“Like what you see, Potter?” The dark-skinned male purred when noticing Harry´s eyes widen. Zabini´s dick was thick like Goyle´s but about nine or ten inches in length.
“It´s not!” Draco pushed Potter´s hands away and Potter stumbled and fell on his arse. Normally Draco would have laughed, but he couldn´t. Not when the git kept staring at him like
“YOU FUCKING BASTARD!” Draco screamed at the top of his lungs and threw himself straight at the Dark Lord, wandless, still not caring for the outcome. The only thing Draco thought about was hurting the man that had murdered Harry Potter.
Draco´s hand rose to grasp dark, untamed hair that made Harry´s head as wild looking as the green eyes piercing his grey ones while he watched him suck his cock. He wanted to close his eyes in pleasure; he wanted to moan to let Harry know how amazing it felt to finally have him close to his body. He didn´t because if he did either he feared it may all be a dream. He needed this moment to keep him company when he went to prison; it would keep him sane, he hoped.
“Professor Malfoy requested to see him tonight, he couldn´t get away without letting his father know about this,” Zabini explained.
Harry was used to doing things for a cause, so this was not that bad, he told himself, as he joined Malfoy on the couch. ”If you plan on making me say ´stop´ by staring at me, Potter, then you might what to change your strategy. You already managed to give me four minutes.”
it took to respond; Harry´s body and voice. “Turn around so I can kiss you.” Harry shook his head and Draco stilled his hand. “I want to taste your tongue while I touch your amazing body.” He kissed his collarbone and Harry moaned. “
“You understand that a true leader needs to have order. And to have that order, punishments are sometimes required.” Draco nodded because he had to accept his fate, he didn´t want Voldemort hurting his mother instead, which he knew his Master wouldn´t hesitate to do.
Before Malfoy could give his answer, Harry grinned, met his eyes and let his hand wander from Malfoy´s right shoulder, across his muscled chest, his firm abs, slim hips. When Harry´s hand squeezed down on Malfoy´s cock the room burst with voices, yelling to either Harry or Draco to keep going to win.
“And you think I will?” He retorted immediately, to Ron´s satisfaction.
Malfoy met his eyes for the first time. Harry swallowed, not knowing what the other was thinking.
“Please…” Greg and Blaise gasped. If they hadn´t just come, that would have tipped them over. “P-pleeease… sss…”
Harry blinked twice before realising what Malfoy meant.
Gregory Goyle had been sent to Azkaban for three years. He had not had anyone to witness on his behalf. His parents had both died in the war; his mother by his father´s hand when she tried to get her son away from the Dark Lord´s grip. Greg had killed two Muggle-borns, so naturally, he had to go to prison.
“Why don´t you be a good Gryffindor and come for me…”
And Malfoy came hard. Harry kept a steady rhythm while swallowing every last drop. He had to admit that Malfoy tasted amazing, and he almost wished he could have a second round, not that he would ever tell the damn git that.
Draco focused his gaze on Harry and blinked. “I never.” He sucked in a breath. “Malfoy´s don´t bottom – but I´m willing to give it a try – for you.”
“I am so getting pissed tonight,” Ron exclaimed when they reached their destination.
“Alright, give us a minute, please.” He tried to make his voice sound normal.
Draco stood there another couple of minutes after Harry´s abrupt departure, clearing his head of immature thoughts of running after him. Draco´s chest constricted as he watched him leave. The man, Draco´s own body, mind and soul had been craving for years.
“Amazing,” Draco finished for him licking his lips free of cum.
He knew it. His parents knew it. And now, the Dark Lord knew it too. He
“He´s the one coming on to me, not the other way around,” Harry mumbled. “He´s not…”
“The Wizengamot will make it clear to everyone, Mr. Malfoy, that we do not tolerate any form of threats or tortures; ever. However, as it is, Mr. Potter has made a plea for your life. There are special circumstances when it comes to the man who has saved us all from Voldemort.” He spoke the name with disgust, but prided himself to be able to speak the name out loud.
Malfoy was struggling to free himself and his face was all red and bothered by the efforts. He looked so not-Malfoy like right now, and Harry took pride in being the reason for that. Harry shifted and his smile broadened.
to see you everywhere in the entire school. Then I just wanted to curse your arse for turning me gay.” Harry´s hand caressed Draco´s shoulder. “I mean, I´m a Malfoy for god´s sake, I
“I need to… before I can´t any more… please…”
“Of course, your letter would be delivered personally.”
Goyle was staring at him, and when he caught Harry´s eyes on him, the damn idiot made a show out of sucking long and hard on his spoon. He
“I can´t believe you just went down on Malfoy, Harry.” Neville´s face was beet-red.
Blaise groaned when seeing Potter like this, all pretend-submissive. Judging from the Gryffindor´s wide grin when lifting himself onto the bed to join the others, he knew all about their plan to make him uncomfortable, which was clearly not working, for whatever reason. Blaise had to stop wanking so he wouldn´t come at that idea alone.
Draco did, and while keeping eye contact, Harry yanked down the trousers. Without wasting another precious minute, he invited Draco´s cock into his mouth.
“For fuck´s sake, Potter, tell him you want him! It´s written all over your face right now, and every time you stare at him around the bloody school. Tell him.”
“Neville will kill me if he sees you.” Harry grumbled, in an effort to get her to leave.
“You´re so sexy when you´re angry, did you know?” Harry bit his lip flirtatiously when Draco quirked his brow. “I guess that´s what got me to notice you in the first place, whenever we would fight I ended up –“
“Weasley…” Draco sounded like a bloody wounded animal.
“Potter,” Malfoy drawled when meeting the Gryffindor in the corridor leading to the Slytherin dorms. “Cloak?”
Draco flinched.
“Yes… suck me…” He demanded.
“Ace of Diamonds. Oh, and there is a rule which states that you can only use a student once in one night as a
Draco´s parents had said their goodbyes earlier this week to him since no one was allowed to leave Azkaban except to witness in court or on granted probation. Draco had asked his mother to not come in today because he knew he would then break down and he could not allow that to happen before he knew his future destiny.
The taller male merely crossed his arms and smirked knowingly. “Not a chance Dray.” He opened the door, “I´ll be right outside this door standing guard, just like you groomed me to all these years.” And then the git winked at Malfoy, and Harry had to hide his laugh by biting into his own tongue hard.
a Death Eater in the first place.
Harry dragged himself down Malfoy´s body, making sure to rub Malfoy´s dick on the way down between his legs. “Your friends seem to be enjoying it,” Harry said casually to the blond´s dick, and the breath tickled so Malfoy squirmed to get away. Harry placed his hand flat on his stomach to still while his tongue roved over  his balls. “Merlin,” Malfoy gasped.
“Please don´t play games… I can´t…” Harry´s voice was so small in Draco´s ears and he hurt knowing that he was the one causing it.
“You know the word, Malfoy-“
“Good. Now, the eighth year students will not be allowed on the Quidditch team, since this year is a single exception and changing the rules for the Hogwarts´ House Cup is out of the question. I´m sorry.” She let the houses complain for a few  minutes to get it out of their systems; she really did wish she could have seen another game with Harry as the Gryffindor Seeker.
He shuddered. No Malfoy had ever divorced, could you imagine the scandal it should bring? He went into the fireplace and, shortly after, landed inside Malfoy Manor.
Harry burst out laughing and Draco stopped speaking, frowning.
He was alive.
There were so many things he had to say, to explain, and to get out of the way before it was too late, but he couldn’t speak.
Before tonight, Draco had been strictly straight, having had his fair share of females. The Trio´s sexual conquests have been mostly outside of Hogwarts, on breaks or Hogsmeade trips, because as Slytherins you were taught to not mix business and pleasure, school in this case.
The bastard didn’t even bother looking at Lucius. “He´s of age, Lucius.” He met Narcissa´s eyes now, who had silently started to cry. She was in shock, Draco knew the signs. “Had you not yourself
Draco´s breath tickled Harry´s left ear. “I have been for years Potter, even when I fingerfuck my arse…”
a handsome body.
the bitch in this room, Malfoy,” Harry remarked, causing the blond to bolt upwards. As soon as Harry sucked half of Malfoy´s sack into his hot mouth with his hand closed around the head and his thumb swirling the pre-cum around, Malfoy collapsed onto his back with a loud thump.
Thanks so much!
This was so not happening, he had to get away from whatever stupid prank they were about to play on him. “Not in the mood to chat now Goyle. Crappy day,” Harry said honestly, watching the taller male striding casually closer to him before stopping a step away.
”Harry, that was brilliant man! Never knew you had it in you.” Dean clapped Harry´s back excitedly before Neville and Seamus snickered again.
Harry felt as though Malfoy's eyes kept his locked to them. Even though it nearly killed him to keep them locked on him, he would do it; he had no choice.
Draco bit the right nipple pretty hard, clearly trying to prove a point. Harry closed his eyes to make the pain subside when a tongue gently licked the molested body part.
Hermione had, of course, twisted his arm to agreeing. Women and their damned withholding sex never failed to work! Besides, between the two of them, as a couple, they had more than enough to buy a large house and furnish it. Harry had, of course, received ten times more than the two of them combined, but he just shrugged it off and let it stay in his Gringotts vault with the rest of his fortunes from both the Black and the Potter lines.
“Luna said there is a way around that, you could take his family name-“
Harry laughed and got up too. “It´s not my fault you´re so fucking gorgeous…”
“So,” Harry repeated.
“More than you are now?” Harry teased.
Quidditch did your body wonders… all these muscles…” He whispered while running fingers over Harry´s abs.
“Malfoy, Harry. He´s the one you´ve been staring at non-stop for the past days,” she said.
Here´s another chapter for you.
Malfoy shook his head when Harry´s hand fingered his blond locks. “Is nice,” he voiced against Harry´s lips.
Once Luna reached Harry´s bedroom door, she knocked.
“I don´t know what you mean,” and Harry didn´t. Well, okay, he
Draco/Harry.
“I´m referring to
“His duties as a pure-blood are to marry and have children, one at the very least. Every pure-blood goes through that ordeal when choosing a partner in life. Being an only child is harder, they will have to follow the bloodline-“
“I`ll take the Slytherin males then,” said the braver Terry Boot.
“What the fuck do you want, Potter!?”
Harry had to win over the bastard, whatever the price he had to pay. He killed Voldemort; surely touching a dick would be fine. He had one himself, which he touched quite often, in fact.
Harry had listened intensely while Luna spoke. “He won´t do that, I´m a half-blood. He would never call himself Potter. And what kind of woman would agree to that?”
“Filius Flitwick is our Charms professor and also Head of Ravenclaw House.” The part goblin smiled and waved.
desperate.”
I´m too busy to post tomorrow, so I´ll post a day early instead, hope you enjoy it ;-)
“Yeah, got it right here,” Harry answered while covering himself with the garment he inherited from his father.
“Will you let me suck you off?” Harry offered. Malfoy´s mind was racing away but he finally nodded his consent and Harry did what he did best when around Malfoy, not counting Quidditch, of course.
“I already know my name, thank you,” the snide remark sounded and most laughed.
Draco panted heavily while Harry opened his own pants. The moment Draco felt Harry´s cock in his hand he slipped down and tasted the pre-cum.
was a wise move in this particular company: he made sure she stood. “Stop…” he said, before making gagging noises too inappropriate for any Malfoy. “Your tongue was in my mouth, how dare you?!”
sucked on his dick.
sexy? They watched as the Gryffindor gently licked Draco´s balls clean, thoroughly. Afterwards, their eyes widened in fascination when the dark-haired male poked out his pink tongue and lapped up the sticky mess on Draco´s left hip, before moving upwards, never leaving Malfoy´s skin, to suck up the rest of the spurts, which had landed on the blond´s lower abdomen.
“Holy fuck Harry…” he yelped in surprise.
The Gryffindors snickered at the blond being confronted with his ridicule of Neville, they were looking forward to hearing him make a fool out of himself. He cleared his throat. “I believe you´re looking for the Agua Erupto charm, Professor,” he said silkily and was rewarded for his efforts.
The Dark Lord, wand in hand, circled, as Draco tried to catch his breath. The horde of Death Eaters didn´t move except for Lucius, holding his wife in his arms. Both were shaking. The torture curse hit Draco for a second time and he nearly bit his tongue to bits.
“Malfoy dumped him over his pure-blood responsibilities.”
War changes people, sometimes for the worse sometimes for the better. Lucius Malfoy knew getting along with Harry was his only chance to recover from the humiliation and social downfall his actions during the war had cost his family.
Harry had to admit that he didn´t know what he would have done if he were in Malfoy´s place.
“I never… you were always…”
“Did you like it?” Dean had to ask. When Harry nodded Dean whistled, “Well, I guess he´s not exactly
The Slytherins looked at each other in order to decide who their next challenger would be, when Goyle rose and walked up to Goldstein to draw the card of the targeting house. Three of Hearts; and Goyle scanned the Gryffindor group and suddenly laughed aloud. “
“10 points to Slytherin.” Students whispered all around. Had Ron´s mother actually taken points from Ron and given them to Malfoy? “The incantation is A-kwa-ee-RUCK-too, and the wand movements are triangular like this.” She showed it a couple of times before ordering the students to get up, spread out and practice the spell.
…” He kept thrusting harder and harder, becoming more turned on by the second hearing the way Harry was gagging violently on his stick as he fucked his mouth. Saliva dripped down Harry´s face and Draco nearly came seeing it. “Fucking hell yes… take my cock…”
“All right settle down. Our new Muggle Studies Professor is someone I had not thought would ever consider teaching here. I know Professor Dumbledore had been trying to convince her for years due to her background knowledge as a pureblood witch and a widower of a muggle-born husband. She can offer us the best of both worlds.” Harry´s heart raced when he spotted Andromeda Tonks and he had to hold back the tears that threatened to fall. This would be so good for Meda, Harry´s nickname for the woman who was raising Teddy, who was Harry´s godson.
“I also had the opportunity that others did not have. I could look into the mind of Voldemort himself.”
“Noo,” his father croaked. “Take my life instead. The mistake was mine, by not raising my heir right.”
.” Potter lifted himself further up, so his head was in front of Draco´s, yet, he was still kneeling. “I want you so badly I can´t think.”
Harry pulled away when the pale hand left his locks and wiped his mouth before standing up and staring at Malfoy. He grinned when he saw his perpetually pale cheeks all pink and flushed, his bottom lip bruised where he had been biting down on it, to stifle his moans.
Harry rolled over so he could easily open Draco´s pants and, shortly after, they were both naked and panting.
Draco´s eyes searched for the owner of the wand that had saved them all and he met the green and sparkling eyes that belonged to Potter.
Draco grabbed Harry´s arse, forcing him deeper.
Lying down was making him insane.
“Oh, I forgot about that.” Harry shrugged. “We could find another place then?”
When Voldemort was
“You should go; we don´t mind," Blaise encouraged. "We helped ourselves before coming here, in fact.”
“I love you too, Harry.”
“-or, I´m excellent at pleasuring you. Which means I win the game.” Harry folded his arms over his chest and waited expectantly for Malfoy to retort.
He nodded to the chairman and waited, knowing he would have questions for him.
“Sure.you.just.like.watching.us.fuck.” Malfoy stated as he kept a teasingly slow pace.
“Fire calling the bloody Ferret…”
“Er, Ron, you´re… you´re up,” Ginny said in a small voice and sat back down, looking nervously around the room. The Slytherins were all howling with laughter by now, but as usual, Ron and Harry were clueless. Well, this time they
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.
“I love you Dray, so fucking much.” He rested his forehead on Draco´s, who took a deep breath in return.
“Leave me alone, Potter.”
“Well, I´m the only-“ Ginny froze in mid-sentence, and turned her head to her older brother, who was still whispering with Harry and Hermione. Everybody was now looking their way and Hermione looked up then sensing every pair of eyes on her, causing the two males to follow suit.
Draco closed his eyes. “I don´t…”
“I want you, Dray… want you inside me… I want to pleasure you too, While I fuck your tight hole raw, I´ll be sucking on your neck, whispering words that will bring you closer to the edge…”
“It´s not bloody fair Luna, I don´t want anyone else,” he whispered. He dropped to the bed again.
“You can´t be serious. Draco, I´m not the perfect one here, I mean, look at you –“
“More, Dray… please, I can take it…”
“It´s not about that and you know it,” he countered pushing aside his plate.
about my body, Potter,” he spat as he sat down on the black couch as the onlooking crowd laughed. Some were too drunk to pay attention, and others were randomly snogging, but about half the students were at least following the game with interest.
“Call your mother…”
A hand came to rest on his shoulder, a big hand, which meant it had to be a male one. “You should go see him.” Neville´s voice rang somewhere over Harry´s bowed head.
Harry wondered as he felt the button pop open, and the zipper slide down.
Draco heard the older man speaking up somewhere in the distance, not really paying too much attention. “Is there someone present who wishes to speak in defense of Draco Lucius Malfoy?” The old wizard in charge of the Wizengamot asked over his spectacles while he glanced around. Nobody spoke and nobody moved an inch. “Very well, w-”
“I´m sorry, I didn´t mean to hurt you.” His breath tickled Harry´s skin, and he let out a gasp. Draco´s member hardened. That was
Greg grinned. “Why, Dray, if I didn´t know any better I would say you were flirting with me.” It was Draco´s turn to snort. They were best friend´s, even closer after Draco had discovered Greg´s intelligence, but there was no sexual attraction between them.
still saw him as the older brother who always teased him, and therefore was not paying much attention to any of his warnings in class. Thus, earning him his fair share of walks to the infirmary with a variety of unfortunate injuries. This time he at least managed to only harm his shoulder so no one had to carry, or levitate him there.
“Don´t make me vomit, half-breed,” Nott spat at her. The Slytherins cheered, which caused Jones to laugh and lean in. She met his eyes before grabbing his face and licking him from his chin to his eye. “STOP! That´s disgusting! Now I´ll have to shower, you filthy half-breed.”
He walked closer to Malfoy and, with as much strength he could muster up, placed a hand on his shoulder, causing him to jump in surprise at the contact.
She laughed. “Nah, why would he be jealous of your gorgeous self with you being gay and all?” She winked and they fell silent.
“Dray… yessss… so damn good… aaaaah… don´t stop…” He thrust harder and Draco had trouble breathing. No one had ever been allowed to fuck a Malfoy, neither mouth nor arse, but this,
“Take off your shirt, Potter,” Greg ordered not planned, and Harry met his brown eyes. Harry knew a horny teenager when he saw one.
Draco sat in the middle of the courtroom once more and as he let his eyes nervously wander he noticed a lot of familiar faces present today. A few of Harry´s friends had shown up, maybe to support him being here or maybe to watch Draco get sentenced. He had after all been quite unpleasant to most of them during their years at the school.
Harry felt his cheeks flaming up in embarrassment and looked away. He finished his breakfast rapidly, made some excuse to leave without his friends who were still eating, and fled the Great Hall. When he rounded the second corner he stopped and leaned against the wall, still panting and closed his eyes.
“I love him.”
That didn´t stop Greg from trying.
“Mother.” He embraced her gently. “I´m free, but they took my wand for a year.”
“I´m not usually like this, I promise. Well, I might want to touch you in a sexual way quite frequently –“ Draco snorted. “-but I swear it´s just, that I´m so bloody happy to finally have you, Dray. You´re perfect. Sure, you´re a right selfish, spoiled git most of the time, but we can work on that, too.” Harry saw the raised brows but ignored them before speaking again. “Did you say spouse?”
tightly across Ron´s leg, then his thigh. Ron shifted uncomfortably; his breathing came in fast heaves. He looked down, it wouldn´t be long before the hand would reach his groin, surely Goyle would stop first?
“I know Harry. I´m sorry sweetheart.” The look he received was love filled and respectful.
He was forced to break his promise. Something he had never done to anyone before. He knew he couldn´t keep up this wall much longer; the confident, proud Gryffindor one, which he had been forcing out last Sunday. He was determined not to let the presence of Malfoy´s friends get to him. The worst part, was the part of him that was beginning to slowly crumble around his nemesis.
feel so good; too damn good to my liking.” Another kiss later, he continued, “you challenge me, you make me pissed over the smallest of things but somehow I don´t explode like I used to. You´re perfect for me.” This time his lips claimed Harry´s and their tongues met, causing both to moan in unison.
“How about we skip dinner and I show you something
“I don´t do men.”
“Agreed,” Voldemort said, and his magic swirled and cursed while signing the Oath between Potter and himself. Should either back out, their magic would kill them, painfully. And since Voldemort wanted to live forever, well.
Lucius Malfoy had never, not even once, told Draco that he loved him. He had raised him strictly and firmly. He knew his place in the Malfoy family and as the heir understood his future responsibilities. Draco tried to speak, but his throat clogged up the words.
“Damn…” Zabini lost it when he heard Draco screaming like a wanton whore. This had to be brilliant, the blond was always composed, even during sex.
“10 points from Gryffindor for name calling of another student,” professor Weasley said calmly. Ron whipped around so fast that he strained his neck in the process.
He leaned his forehead against Harry´s, panting. Harry´s hand rose to caress his left cheek.
Much like the Golden Trio had been in Gryffindor; Weasley, Potter and Granger, the Slytherin Trio got their nickname in the second half of last year. Goyle, much to everyone´s surprise, had been feigning stupidity for the previous six years. It was a trick he had used so that his father would think him unworthy of joining Voldemort´s ranks. The Goyle patriarch had simply feared that Greg would embarrass him, or worse get the entire family killed. It was rumoured amongst certain Pure-bloods after the First Wizarding War, that the Dark Lord was not really dead and they were planning his return, encouraging their sons on to be ready to join him when he did come back.
Draco tuned in again.
“Maybe no male should go, just in case?” She said, biting her lip in concern. She looked around to Ron beside her on the floor, Luna and Neville sitting on the couch and Seamus and Dean on a chair each. They had been allowed to stay here by Harry until they figured out what to do about jobs or further education.
. Walking the distance to where his mother was seated waiting for a response, he leaned over the small table and signed the parchment lying there, then sat down. “You know mother, tha-“
Most of the Slytherins had already cleared out and gone off to watch the Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw match today. It was Saturday, a week after Draco had been kissing Potter. Greg sighed, cast a privacy spell and spoke. “Alright, what´s up, Dray?”
need to feel his dick responding to watching all of this.
Harry hadn´t realized that he had closed his eyes until a soft hand rose to his face and Harry´s own hand reached to cover it. He could hear himself breathing harder and his chest heaved rapidly from the touch.
Draco thrust harder and faster and Harry´s body began shaking more and more. “He´s almost there, just hold on fifteen seconds then let go…”
Where have all the comments gone? "weeps"
Draco´s mother screamed as the curse tore through her beautiful body and Harry´s instinct took over and the truth blurted out of his mouth. “Because I love him!”
“Malfoy, get your tiny body up here.” The room went wild as Harry challenged the Malfoy heir. Harry met the grey orbs, and only swayed a little on the spot while trying to act not at all affected by the amount of beer he had consumed.
Hello all.
“You may step down Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy, if you have any last words before we retire to decide on your penalty, this is it.”
He cleared his throat nervously, keeping his eyes upon the chairman only, having used that method two days prior also to calm his nerves, to make sure that nobody could change his mind about speaking up. He could not take the looks he would receive from those who knew him.
M/M, Angst, Love, War, Torture, Magical Oath, AU, Loyalty, Good/Draco.
Draco sighed. “I want you, but it´s…”
“I want you,” Harry panted as Goyle kept pulling on his dick and stopping just before he would tip over the edge, then starting again.
Whatever the reason, he was so not discussing it with Hermione or Ron or anyone else for that matter!
The elderly man looked behind him as he took a pause to acknowledge the people staring back at him expectantly. He then met Draco´s eyes and went on talking.
“Watch it, Potter!”
Snape had also been put in the ground. Harry had paid for everything himself; it was how he had wanted it to be, after having watched those memories from his former professor many times. When he had finally shared his knowledge of the man nobody seemed to have known at all, he had been awarded the Order of Merlin, which was now resting safely on the mantelpiece beside Harry´s own here at Grimmauld Place.
Harry noticed the smirk.
“- for one year. The wand will be turned over to the Ministry. When that year has passed, you will get it back, so long as you have not been involved in anything illegal. Should you, however, break the law during that year, you will go straight to Azkaban for several years.”
He paused.
“Stop, we need to
Ron had turned into an alarming reddish colour.
When Lucius didn´t release the robes he was clutching, Voldemort´s - the bastard threw a spell that sent my father flying across the stone. He landed with a crack. He didn´t die, Draco noticed.
“It´s not right. We–“
“Pardon, I didn´t realise this space was already occupied, Potter. Carry on.” He turned and walked away casually.
“So, dinner is ´bout ready,” Seamus said, and they all burst out laughing. This had to have been the reason to why he had come for them. “Jesus, ya´ two… are fuckin´ awesome.” He got up and began dressing. “Malfoy, if I ever say a cross word against ya´…”
“The Wizengamot has made their decision Mr. Malfoy to take your wand-“
“Mate, I don´t like the git one bit, but I care about you and if you let this chance to speak to him for the last time slip you by, you will resent yourself for it for the rest of your life.” Ron gripped his other shoulder tightly.
Draco sighed and leaned back into the hard, wooden chair in the middle of the courtroom. The room was filling with all sorts of wizards, some he knew, some he did not. He would not meet their eyes. He could not.
“Huh, what is he doing back already?” Ron asked from somewhere on the floor in the living room.
“Draco Malfoy was forced into doing things. Things nobody could ever come close to comprehending when they have never had Voldemort living under their roof. When they have never had an insane father-figure who worshiped Voldemort - a man who pushed proudly to make his only son like him. They would never know the feeling of constant fear, of pressure to perform and to wear the perfect mask covering up just how you really feel. They would never know what is it to be lonely and afraid.”
She nodded in understanding. “He´s a pure-blood.”
Draco looked around and noticed they were still alone. He placed a hand to Harry´s chin and tilted his head upwards to catch his eyes.
“Mm, you´re right.” He stepped closer to Harry. “I
“Just take the fucking tag, Malfoy,” Ron stated, and the blond
He growled and pinned tHarry down on the bed. Harry´s body reacted at once and he moaned.
“Right. Two of Spades: so we´ll need to see a Ravenclaw challenger this time.” Luna immediately walked to the couch and sat down. She smiled when Goldstein handed her the cards and she drew the last of the Diamonds.
“Draco Malfoy first reached out the hand of friendship the day before our first year at Hogwarts when we met at Madam Malkin´s robes for all occasions. I was a lonely, miserable boy, who had never known friendship, and who had been bullied my entire life by my own family. And Draco seemed like just another bully to me when he went on and on about the purity of blood. So, naturally, I declined any sort of friendship he was offering to me.”
Harry grinned and nodded, “And when I win, minute-man, you get on your knees for me in the Astronomy tower at midnight tomorrow. Just the two of us, my cock in your mouth. You will enjoy it and you will swallow it all. Should you fail to do so, I get another the day after and another until you manage to complete the task.”
The shockwave Harry had been expecting came rising over him. People were shouting some angry, some not. He caught some of his friends´ eyes, and the look of horror written in them made his stomach turn over.
Malfoy sneered in return. “Fuck you, Potter; my mother saved your life. And I didn´t rat you out when the Dark Lord–“
“But he is also so much more than that.”
“Shut the fuck up Ferret!” He yelled.
Potter was rambling. Draco had to stop him before it would be too late, before Potter dragged him into this pit of stupidity and lust, which would not do. “Don´t you feel it, too?”
“Do you give up now?” The snake had the nerve to ask. Ron gulped and swallowed, before shaking his head. Goyle smirked then. The hand very slowly began to move. It was
Draco snorted. “I´m a Malfoy, Weasley! What – you thought I would call myself Draco Potter, a half-blood name?” He mocked.
Silence.
“If I were given another chance, I would not have turned him down. I would have tried to make it work. I am not trying to make excuses for him, not at all. I am merely trying to paint the right picture of a man who simply did not have many chances to be any different. Just like I didn´t have any choice but to be ´the boy who lived.´”
“You alright there mate?” Ron´s voice called.
”Mr. Malfoy, the Wizengamot will now discuss your case. The court will be on recess until we reach a verdict, however long that may be. You will be taken to the room next door, where you can say your goodbyes to your family and friends if you so wish. The room will be surrounded by magic which prevents you or your guests from removing you from the room until we are ready to resume court. Mr. Malfoy, need I remind you that this may be your very last time as a free man for a long time? I say this to all Death Eaters, of course, even though some have been granted freedom due to being only minor cases. There are those who will spend years or even the rest of their lives in Azkaban. Do you understand my meaning?”
“And why should you care for the life of Draco Malfoy?”
“My life, for the Malfoy family to walk away unharmed. I want a Wizard´s Oath, on your magic, that no one is to harm them.”
Harry couldn´t hide this from Malfoy in an intimate situation. He wasn´t a pureblood practically born into an iron mask of indifference, nor was he a Slytherin taught to tame his emotions. And there was no way he could possibly let Malfoy know how he felt, the torment that would follow would be devastating. Even though he only had eight months of school left, Malfoy would broadcast it to the papers.
“So fucking beautiful,“ Goyle breathed, before going for Harry´s pants. “Come here, Dray.”
Draco´s eyes flew open.
“He was surrounded by hate and traditions which were not up for discussion. He had no siblings, no friends, and no allies. Could he really have turned out any different? I am not so sure he could. I pity him in fact.”
“Nuuuhr…” Malfoy was losing it now. Well, Harry
Harry didn´t know for how long he had been sitting in a deserted classroom, it was in the first floor, and he had never visited it before. He stared wearily out the window at the autumn wind blow leaves around in a blur of red, yellow and brown. He
“-never leave Azkaban,” she interrupted bluntly and a shadow appeared on her pale face as she spoke. “You are the heir, you are in charge now. There are plenty of pureblood females that can help us. Now stop wasting time, Draco.” She smiled and kissed his cheek, then returned Ron´s wand to him.
Malfoy was breathing hard judging from the numerous times his chest moved up and down. For the first time ever, Malfoy let down his mask in the eyes of the public. He didn´t seem to notice the tears falling down his pale cheeks. If he had, he would have shielded them, obviously. “Yes. Mr. Chairman.”
“We are a few months away from the war, and emotions are running high still. We have lost family members, colleagues, friends, and neighbors. It will take time to recover fully and until then, this rule
Anthony Goldstein grinned at his housemates. “I´ll explain in our common room, come on.” The idea had simply walked into his mind and he was sure his friends would approve.
“Potter.”
An hour and a half into the game Harry heard his name being called and looked up, not really paying much attention lately, since his dorm mates had forced him into a drinking game of their own. Goyle was standing there smirking at Harry. Harry rose at Ron´s comforting words but did not really hear them.
Draco took a deep breath. “Thank you for offering your assistance to make sure I stayed out of Azkaban. If you´ll excuse me, my mother will be waiting to hear the news.”
“I just want this over with,” Harry stated.
… lately, huh?”
was the only reason that Harry pitied Malfoy.
Malfoy leaned back casually and smirked. “Never thought I´d live to see the day where Harry Potter would beg to suck my cock. I guess I should feel, honored is it? Well, I´ve got news for you, Potter, I can have head every fucking time of the day I want. so I would never lower myself to be soiled by your lips. Nobody can be
There were now only three cards left: two Hufflepuffs and a Slytherin.
Harry stopped panicking when he felt Malfoy´s tongue inside his mouth and he had to moan when he came seconds after.
“I disliked you from the first time we met, you know, when you insulted my first friend, Ron. And it just got worse the more time I spent at school with you.” Harry played with the hem of his shirt for something to occupy his hands with. “You were so arrogant and full of yourself and your prejudice towards, well, everything and pretty well everyone, that I never wanted to know why you were like that. I guess that´s how the whole game thing began, you know?”
Harry growled.
Seamus froze in the middle of the room at the sight that met him. Two absolutely
Harry nodded in understanding, but it still hurt. Draco´s finger ran over Harry´s lips and he gave a mischievous smirk.
“But you´re the one who always claimed Potter was special.”
“Draco!”
“That`s it then, let`s eat. Bon appetit.” She sat down, and the tables filled with delicious meals and drinks and the chattering began.
“You´ve been trailing after Potter since we were eleven, now get over here and take a chance.” Harry´s mind was spinning from their words and from Goyle´s touch. He
“Money can´t keep buying you friends, Malfoy. Everyone knows what you are now, and what your family stands for.” Harry shot back. Malfoy tried to leave then, but Harry slammed him against the wall. “You listen to me, you arsehole, you better stop thinking you own the school or–“
“In your dreams, Potter,” he spat as he willed his mind to tell his cock to not – too late.
“Fuck you, Potter, I´m a grower, not a shower," Malfoy hissed. "Now get to it, before I freeze my balls off.”
All characters belong to JKR and associated publishers.
“Your first pathetic attempt cursed a fellow student, a female, to my knowledge.” He met Snape´s gaze, who nodded at the silently asked confirmation. “The second,” the Dark Lord laughed, “Was almost amusing. Having the best friend of Harry Potter on the brink of death.” He stopped walking. “Pity Potter saved him. I should have enjoyed knowing another died for their friend.” He looked up at the sky before going on. “Lastly, Severus had to finish the job for you, because you were too weak to do so, even if the Headmaster was wandless.” He ignored the angry shouts coming from the light´s side.
Putting this many teenagers together in one school studying for their NEWTs, and taking away one of the often harmless and most used ways to let off steam, was unwise. Yet, this was the reality, as their Headmistress explained when she caught a group of 8th year Slytherins and Ravenclaws about to duel in the corridor three weeks later after dinner.
“What?” Malfoy almost whispered. “You´re making that up.”
Draco didn´t know if he should leave or stay, all he knew was he could not just keep standing there in the middle of the damn room in complete darkness like an idiot.
“I-I… don´t… I… that it…”
“Weasley! You come here, showing no respect, into my home-“
Harry nodded, which was stupid, since no one could see him. Draco cuddled Harry closer and Harry immediately found his mouth and attached himself like a leech.
Harry bit his lip to stop any stupid mumbling when seeing Malfoy´s eyes widening and he was backing away from Harry. Goyle stood up and blocked the exit. “No more running away from him, Dray.”
“Like what?” The older man inquired.
“Get on the bed,” Harry commanded.  Malfoy´s hand had let go of the dark locks at some point and the blond sneered down at Potter. Malfoy was not moving so Potter made a show out of crawling towards the bed where Blaise and Greg were sitting with their dicks out.
“Bugger off.” He took another bite.
“Now…”
Harry sighed, running his hands through his hair as he stopped to stare at the Orders. Not everyone had earned an Order of Merlin during the war. The Death Eaters had certainly not. In fact, they had almost all been hunted down and killed. The lucky ones who had been captured instead had now been sentenced to life in Azkaban.
"The further we get with the game, the more points the winning house can collect; meaning, that if a house has 250 points and is beaten, the winning house gets every last point plus an additional 50 points,” Goldstein explained while picking the next card, and excited murmurs could be heard around the room. Nobody really had that much to drink, seeing that it was the first time they played the game.
No. Draco´s mind screamed. You fucking foolish, stupid, fuck, Potter. Don’t you dare leave me behind!
wing?” Harry laughed. “You make it sound like they are clients. I hear you, we couldn´t have been raised and lived more different lives, so it will take work to
Several hands went into the air from Gryffindor, but the Slytherins all pretended that their time was worth more than this stupid spell. “Yes, Mr. Longbottom.”
Harry grinned, Draco could see his face clearly this close, his eyes having gotten used to the thick darkness long ago.
Draco stopped in front of the Dark Lord, who was smiling, and therefore more dangerous. Their Master looked Draco in his grey eyes when he raised his wand and pointed it at him.
Harry laughed, which earned him a slap from Draco.
Thanks for the kudos.
The dream had seemed so vivid, so real that his heart had still been running a marathon inside his rib cage when he had awoken. His body was sweaty and bounding with the aftermath of his orgasm. An orgasm more intense than any he´d  had before, and it had been caused by no less than three bloody Slytherins.
“I think,” Lord Voldemort stated because Draco had decided that he was not his Master any longer. He would die proudly, and free from that snake. “That the best way is for the Malfoy bloodline to end with you, Lucius.”
“Mr. Weasley, not so close to the–“
Draco blinked away the tears because he needed clear vision to see what happened next, especially if this were to be his last moments.
Draco could both hear and see the desperation in Harry when he spoke. He knew Harry needed to hear those exact words from him, even though they might not be true.
“Gays are just as accepted in the wizarding society as straight people are.”
Draco offered a small smile. “In this dump?” His eyebrow rose.
just leave them behind to go elsewhere, but that would only probably rid them of Pansy and her boyfriend Theo since they were both in a lazy mood this afternoon. Vince, on the other hand, was like a fucking leech that wouldn´t go anywhere alone, and insisted on shadowing the Slytherin Trio.
The voices in the room exploded when the other students were watching Luna snog the Prince of Slytherin. His hands wanted to grab her and push her to the floor in disgust, and he didn´t return her kiss, of course, he wouldn´t, it was fucking Lovegood.
get his soppy-arse happily ever after. Draco for sure would work bloody hard to achieve that, that much was for certain. Who in their right mind could say no to Harry Potter looking like that while sucking your cock. Besides, Draco Potter didn´t sound
”Draco, perhaps–...” His mother´s loving voice suggested after having listened to the facts of the entire trial.
“Of course, Meda,” he answered and carried Teddy with him back to his stunned housemates, well, Ron and Hermione had met Teddy once before of course.
“The one I… fancy… I think…” Harry finished dumbly.
Ron squealed, wide-eyed.
“God… suck it…” Harry thrust into Draco´s mouth before he was prepared for it. “Don´t tell me this is your first… god… ´cos I would… call you… a liar… so bloody g-good Dray…” He kept thrusting while Draco sucked.
Harry groaned, “Harry Potter.”
“I can´t Weasley god damn it!”
Because I Love Him
, you twat.” Harry laughed as they entered the room. They were among the last to arrive and they took their seats and glanced at the scoreboard:
“Prove it then, or I´ll talk. I killed Voldemort; I think I can manage a Malfoy.” Harry challenged and Malfoy huffed a little, his grey eyes boring into Harry´s green ones.
“Avada Kedavra!”
Draco closed his eyes.
And this was Malfoy for fuck´s sake. He shouldn’t be allowed to look perfect at all.
“Head of Hufflepuff House and Herbology Professor Pomona Sprout.” The plump witch smiled broadly and nodded shyly.
Ginny let go of Dean´s hand, and he nodded firmly and gave his girlfriend a soft look when she rose and put down her drink on the table. She drew in a deep breath of air before turning around to walk toward the couch.
People began talking, some were yelling in outrage but Draco had been released from his chains already and was heading for the door.
Malfoy gave a soft moan, and Harry sucked harder. He had a game to win. That was the reason he was doing this, and not because he had a sudden craving for salty drops of-.
Ron was still mumbling about his sore shoulder later on their way to the Game night; about it being Charlie´s intention all along. He also rambled on and on about it being that worst year of his life. Two close family members teaching here, and they
“He needs
“I don´t deserve you.” Strong hands grabbed his hips and drew him closer. They continued travelling up Harry´s body, yanking his t-shirt up, slowly removing it from his almost trembling body. “For years I was jealous of you for being given fame; which you never did appreciate the power of.” Harry tried to answer that he didn´t ask for that kind of fame, but Draco had known he would because he shushed him at once.
Draco nodded in understanding.
Flashback to Theo rimming Draco.
“Seven minutes left,” someone yelled excitedly.
THE END
“So.damn.good.oh.my.god!”
“I´m in love with him,” Harry breathed out in a small whispered voice.
“You were born to kneel before others, Potter, who wouldn´t hav-“
“…bottom?” He played with Harry´s hair. “For you, I would…”
Draco had to look away for a moment to keep his perfect Malfoy mask in place, which had, of course, returned the moment he had been acquitted.
Harry closed his eyes, letting his own fears wash away, no longer caring what the rest of the world were shouting at him for speaking those words to a Death Eater. All he cared about was hearing those three words from the lips of the man he had fallen in love with over the past year.
When Ron came through the fireplace too, he pushed Draco forward towards the doorway leading up to Harry´s room, where he was currently asleep like Luna had ordered him. “Malfoy, Luna will show you to Harry.” He took the beer that Dean offered him. “And you better bloody fix this mess, got it?”
Had they been Gryffindors, Draco would simply have excused himself and said that he wanted to chat with Greg and Blaise alone, but that would have been, coming from a Slytherin, like standing up naked asking for a blowjob.
“Tell him, Potter.”
Harry placed Draco´s hand across his own heart. “I can´t explain how or when, hell I can´t even tell you why, but I do. I love you.”
the past two days. Ever since you… the last game night.” She flushed, Harry noticed, and he didn´t understand what she meant.
Both Greg and Blaise were wanking silently and shared a look when they heard their friend moaning. This was not the first time they had done something like this together, they were best friends and furthermore Slytherins. They were also purebloods, and part of that, was that they would not be embarrassed in each other´s company.
Harry kissed him one last time and pulled away, with a hand over his heart he spoke again when he reached the door. “Always…”
Thanks so much for all your lovely comments !
“I´ll go,” Luna offered and left her boyfriend Neville with a cold spot where they had been molded together. He smiled as she went upstairs.
Harry raised his eyes to hers from where they had been staring at the same spot on the floor the past hour or so. Harry shrugged. “´Course not, Mione. Why do you ask?”
“You´re right, he wouldn´t,” Luna simply stated and Harry growled.
Malfoy´s hand almost reached out to touch him, but he managed to control his urges. He sighed and spoke. “I didn´t know.”
“Never thought the Slytherin prince cursed…” Harry sucked on the other nipple and Draco bucked into the molestation willingly. “But I like it.”
”Wait,
“Try it, before knocking it down. Give it and Potter a chance. To my knowledge he´s never dated men either,” he said.
him was beyond pleasurable for him. He was simply addictive. And, even though Harry was the reason for Draco´s admission to being gay, he was not his first. Ever since he realized his preference, he had been practicing with other willing men; there was no way in hell he was going to disappoint Harry Potter because of lack of experience. So far so good, it seemed.
“That was…” Harry fell back onto his bed, panting.
“Imagine my tongue rimming your perfect hole, would you like that?”
This was a good deal indeed.
Draco laughed. “Mmm, do you have any idea how perfect you are for me and my huge ego?”
Malfoy had also stayed behind after class when the professor had asked him and the room had emptied. Harry was leaning against the stone wall when Malfoy finally exited the classroom. “Oi, Malfoy,” Harry caught up with the blond when he walked straight past him.
“You know I can´t make th-“
Harry agreed while getting down before Malfoy, who wasted no time grabbing his wild hair.
“I don´t mind gays, of course not, but Goyle touching
“Well, I learned growing up, as a pure-blood myself, that if a gay heir were to marry and refuse to wear the family name and take on his lover´s instead, then the rules can be bent slightly. He would have to still provide an heir or more with a woman, but he would not be forced to marrying her since he has submitted himself to another bloodline. That would satisfy his own bloodline´s need of continuing and, in the meantime, he could avoid marrying a woman, as his blood would still be the in heir he fathered. However, the woman would have to be a pureblood also.”
“Now you get to pick a card. If it´s a club it goes back into the deck since it´s your own house.” She picked the 2 of Diamonds. “The number is not important, only the suit, or in this case, the house. Now, you get to pick someone from Slytherin, but I should warn you ahead before you make your pick. Your job, Jones, will be to get your opponent to say ´STOP.´ You can use any part of your body you want and, you can use words. However, no violence or spitting and no wands allowed. For example, you could walk up to them, rub against them, insult, moan, touch, and if you´re really brave, kiss or more.”
“Never thought… that I was gay… before seeing your perfect arse… in the showers after… Quidditch fifth year… either…“
damn good." He sighed.
Draco opened his eyes and stared into Ron´s eyes. “Only a fool would not,” he whispered and straightened up, not really moving any further. “He deserves more than I can offer.”
A life of responsibilities, duties, wealth, pride, honor and every bloody thing that came with the ´job´is what was holding him back, he knew. The same life would be filled with masked despair, unhappiness, loneliness and a cold that Draco could not be free from no matter how many hours he sat in front of the burning fire.
“I might not be the best student when it comes to concentrating for a long period of time, but I think I do alright in most subjects for someone Muggle-raised.” Potter didn´t even throw the words at Draco. He was being sweet in return.
Harry grinned at that idea and Malfoy frowned. “Sorry, I just… never mind,” Harry said.
didn´t have to sleep in a damn cupboard and
Neville was wounded, but that didn´t keep him from charging ahead when seeing Draco Malfoy lunging for the madman – and if Draco dared, well - yelling, “ATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK.” And because Neville had been the one that had kept Hogwarts´ bravery and morale up while Hermione, Ron, and Harry had finished off almost the last of the Horcruxes, the students didn´t hesitate to draw their wands and run like a horde of crazy horses towards the astounded Death Eaters.
And just like that, Harry decided to go all-in to ridicule Malfoy further. He was so going down.
“Stay close,” Malfoy stopped abruptly, as he felt Harry´s body suddenly pressed up against his arse, “Not that close!” Harry snickered.
“Right. Our last positions to be filled are Head of Slytherin House and your Potions professor. This person is someone who also passed the necessary tests and has the exceptional experience with Potions. I must admit when he applied I was very much surprised.” Her sternness was back. “I ask all of you to give him a fair chance. He has made mistakes in the past, as we all have. We must look forward and rebuild our school and our world in unison. It was what Professor Dumbledore always wanted and so do I. We are all human beings, and we all make our choices in life and must learn to deal with the consequences of those choices for the rest of our days.”
“Well, it doesn´t take a genius to figure out: the more times you get blown the harder you will be to bring off because you´d have more control holding back your load. So, naturally, that would mean, since I managed to do almost that before you stopped me, you´re either lying about the number of times someone sucks you-“
More nodding and Goldstein began with his own house. One by one, they came forth when hearing their name so the others could see their faces. “Terry Boot. Michael Corner. Kevin Entwhistle. Morag McDougal. Stephen Cornfoot. Anthony Goldstein (that`s me). Mandy Brocklehurst. Padma Patil. Su Li. Lisa Turpin. And last but not least Luna Lovegood has been allowed to join our year because of her advanced knowledge and work with the Order of the Phoenix last year.”
Draco kissed him, but before Harry could kiss back he pulled away again.
What seemed to be an easy enough spell to master turned out to be so difficult to manage that not even Hermione could do it correctly. “20 points to Slytherin for the first correctly performed spell today,” she said suddenly after 25 minutes, causing everyone to pause in their attempts and glance around to see the person she had just praised. “Excellent work, Mr. Malfoy, keep up the good work.” Malfoy didn´t even flinch when she placed her hand briefly on to his shoulder.
“Of course not, I´ll help you develop one.” Harry caught the hand on a mission to hurt him and laughed. “So fucking cute.” Then he rolled them over so that he was on top of Draco, who yelped in surprise. “Wanna be my first right now?”
“Taunted me? Spread rumors? Told the papers?” Harry offered, and noticed the slight pink colour of embarrassment rise in Malfoy´s cheeks.
“If I were given another chance I would not have turned him down. I would have tried to make it work. I am not trying to make excuses for him, not at all. I am merely trying to paint the right picture of a man who simply did not have many chances to be any different. Just like I didn´t have any choice but to be ´the-boy-who-lived.´”
Harry reached out for Draco´s face but Draco backed away.
The fireplace flared, but no head appeared, which could only mean; that somebody who did not have permission to come through was calling. The two Malfoys shared a look, knowing it could not be the Ministry since they were to have all-time access, and the few friends that still lingered around them could simply call. Narcissa flicked her wand at the hearth. Draco coughed up most of the tea he had decided to use to clear his throat with when he stared into the face of Ronald Weasley.
Harry let his tongue caress the slit of Malfoy´s dick causing the blond´s breath to catch, much to Harry´s enjoyment. Harry hummed when he surrounded the head with the heat of his mouth and sucked. “Uuh.”
He looked out of place in a room like this, with fellow students that were all half passed out by the drinks that kept coming, rumpled clothes from snogging sessions and so on. Even Hermione had been coaxed by Seamus and Ron to drink tonight, for the fun of it, the Irish had pushed until she caved.
“Again, he tried to befriend me when we arrived at Hogwarts, but unfortunately for him, he did so while ridiculing my first friend, whom I met on the train; Ronald Weasley.”
Standing still was making him insane.
They were alone in the hallway now, perhaps Harry had told his friends to let them talk alone and the Aurors had hurried everyone else out of the courtroom to not create trouble inside the Ministry.
“You said it yourself, or I think that´s what you tried to say at least. That I´m the only one you felt this for, a guy that is. That I´m special to you.” Malfoy made to object but Harry continued speaking, “That´s why you´ve always wanted to be near me. When you couldn´t be my friend, why else would you spend so much time arguing with me, taunting my friends, ruining my potions in class. You never did that to anyone else, and you know it.” Malfoy blinked as if thinking it over.
“Did he hurt you?” Harry felt good, knowing that Ron would do that sort of thing for him, but that didn´t mean he wanted Draco in pain.
didn´t have to endure that kind of thing. He supposed it was easy to sit back and judge Malfoy, while not having been in his shoes.
“It is a fame I never asked for, nor liked at any time, regardless of what anyone else believes. It is to me a mere nuisance to be followed around by reporters trying to ask me how I prefer to take a dump.”
“You wanted to see me…” Harry was nervous. He had spoken his deepest thoughts in front of everyone, and the truth would be all over the papers later he was sure. Malfoy had returned his feelings as well.
But Draco needn´t have bothered, because the only thing that happened, was Weasley´s outstretched hand waiting for Draco to grasp it. The young man that Draco had teased, cursed and ridiculed for years, was offering to help Draco up.
Harry leaned in to whisper. “Because I´ll finish what I started.”
“OWWW!” Ron yelled, while the rest of the class snickered.
“Malfoy,” the dark-haired male breathed, and Draco quirked a brow before shutting his book calmly. He
Malfoy turned when hearing Potter laughing so hard he nearly fell off his chair. Their eyes met and Harry had the nerve to keep laughing. Malfoy huffed, scowled and stared angrily back. The intensity of Potter´s stare eventually made the blond turn away.
None of the males in the room had ever been a bottom, let alone had anything inside them, they were all for staying in control of the game. It was a Slytherin thing, again. Harry sucked harder and wasted no time pushing the digit inside Malfoy´s arse. “You son of a biiiiiiitch…” Malfoy was about to grab for his wand to curse Potter when the finger touched his prostate.
“What is it?” The very excited voice of Ginny asked, she was so ready for this!
“Fuck off, Snake,” he spat, and his own house cheered him on. He offered them a small smile in return. Ron felt Goyle shifting closer, his broad chest pushing against Ron´s shoulder; he kept his breathing even. A hand landed on his knee. “WHAT THE FUCK, GOYLE?” he yelled, but the hand stayed where it was.
Harry cast the cleaning spell; he couldn´t believe they had let him bring his wand. Maybe they had made a mistake in that. Harry didn´t care.
treated him like he was an idiot.
Harry released Malfoy´s dick, opened his eyes and grinned.
Then He caught sight of the tiny boy on Meda´s arm, who started wailing at the applause when the aging witch took her seat.
“Aah.” The rough fabric was doing wonders and Malfoy was suddenly very flushed looking. His two friends had not come to his aid, they simply watched and went back to touching themselves.
“I didn´t mean like this! For Merlin´s sake Greg, just stop this and let´s…”
He straightened himself to the Malfoy proud-looking posture before walking towards the exit to return home. Without his damned wand. He felt like only half a man; a man that craved some Harry Potter. He could admit that to himself by now.
“You will give a public apology to our world for the mistakes you have made, letting them know you have learned from those mistakes, and that you will not repeat any of them.” He met Draco´s eye again. “You are free to leave this court Mr. Malfoy, but let me point out the obvious to you; you would not be out at all had it not been for Mr. Potter and the debt we all owe him.”
“Mr. Potter, need I remind you that you are under oath of this courtroom to speak the truth?”
Draco sighed and Greg knew he was considering it, but it would still not mean he was agreeing. It´s better than before, however.
Harry moved two fingers behind Malfoy´s sack to massage him there, and he could have sworn he heard a groan in return. If anything Malfoy´s cock was now half-erect, and Harry had to agree, that Malfoy was a shower. He hadn´t really paid much attention the first time. With his free hand, Harry gripped Malfoy´s shaft and pumped it a few times before running his tongue over the tip.
“Harry…”

Except Harry bloody Potter, of course. The fucker.
Sorry, I´m a day late!
“Harry Potter, you open this door right now, or I´ll summon the Gitsl bettles to attack you!” she threatened. She heard scrambling and the door slowly opened.
Harry´s grin faltered when Draco despite his appearance smirked. “Two days from now, Potter, meet me at the Great Hall and I´ll lead you into the Slytherin–“
Harry kissed him again, but Draco stopped him. Harry swallowed, knowing what was coming next. “We need to talk about this.”
“Yes, sir.”
“No need for that, Mr. Weasley.” They both startled and swung around and found Narcissa there. “Dragon…” She walked to her son. “Go to him.”
Laughter spread.
“And just what would that be?” Malfoy regretted the question as soon as he saw Harry´s amused facial features.
He had to work quickly now.
? Seamus wondered.
“It´s okay, mate,” Harry stated. “We all have our limits.” Ron downed a beer and opened another, and took a large swig and shuddered.

Harry laughed as he noticed the change of the scoreboards.

“S-stop, Harry… you´ll… god, I
Harry laughed harder.
it was inevitable, didn´t make it any less terrifying standing here awaiting your doom, in front of the entire school, both living and dead. Draco shivered again.
The minute Harry´s hand clamped down on Malfoy´s prick he felt it harden. Harry snorted and twisted his hand, causing Malfoy to growl. “You like that, do you, Ferret?” The sneer Harry received in return was worth everything. Harry laughed and twisted his body around and slipped to the floor, kneeling in front of Malfoy.
“Yes, we´ll be in the dorm tonight, studying,” Draco added this genius line to the conversation, knowing there was no way that Vince was going to return to their dorm until much, much later then. Vince grunted in distaste as he left the common room.
“Dragon? Oh, my sweet Dragon.” His mother almost ran towards him from the chair in which she had been sitting.
“Is there someone present who wishes to speak in defense for Draco Lucius Malfoy?” The old wizard in charge of the Wizengamot asked while he glanced around. Nobody spoke and nobody moved an inch. “Very well, we -.”
anyway.” Draco smiled awkwardly. “I´m sorry if I ever gave you the impression tha-“
Harry shivered when Draco pulled the forgotten pants all the way off from where they lay at Harry´s knees, followed by the red boxers.
, of course, but seeing it unfold - in Harry´s opinion - was spectacular.
Malfoy gritted his teeth. “Of course, it
Harry had no memory of how he had made it back to his own dorm afterwards, when he was thinking it over the next morning at the Gryffindor breakfast table. He sat there next to Ron, who like always, was shoveling food into his mouth as if one of his brothers might eat everything on his plate if he failed the task himself. Harry snickered at Hermione´s voice telling her boyfriend off for the third time today already.
Harry grabbed the Draco´s head forcefully and pushed his cock into his mouth again. Draco gagged, but didn´t complain, in fact, he resumed his task to suck off the most attractive man he had ever met. It wasn´t that Harry was stunningly beautiful, but his manly features, deep green eyes, thick, wild hair and
“What the hell are you on about now, Pothead?” Malfoy demanded.
tell me to stop.” Harry´s eyes widened.
Harry turned to Malfoy. “Say please, Malfoy,” his green eyes shining with mischief.
Harry smiled evilly and stepped closer until their bodies almost touched.
act like an idiot around his brother and mother: trying to get them to favor him over the other students. Harry was glad that the rest of the students actually liked the Weasleys as professors, even though most of the Slytherins would hardly admit to it, Harry had heard some of them talking about it when lurking around in his invisibility cloak.
Harry´s reasons for doing this swirled around inside his head, and he couldn´t decide which one to answer Tom Riddle with.
“A compliment. Tut. That´s so unlike you.” Harry´s free hand went through Malfoy´s locks, causing the older male to glare.
“If you win and you can hold on longer, what do you want?” Harry asked Malfoy like it was the most normal everyday conversation one could be having.
Happy eyes full of tears of joy.
“You´re Harry Potter for Merlin´s sake, you need something other than…” He made a hand gesture as he sat up.
Pale hips bucked and Harry gagged on the dick but didn´t complain, instead, he moaned again, sending lovely vibrations through Malfoy´s cock. “Nhhhu.” Harry grinned and sucked the length all the way out his mouth and back in again. He released it and slipped his tongue into the slit on the head while his hand pumped the cock, up and down, up and down. “M-more… fuuck…” Malfoy was losing it and Harry enjoyed every last incoherent mumble the blond let out.
Thank Merlin, it was now Friday and he could forget about that, for the time being.
“Of course not. Dray,” he said when yanking Harry´s pants down.
“But I love you… and you said that…”
“He was surrounded by hate and traditions which were not up for discussion.He had no siblings, no friends, and no allies. Could he really have turned out any different? I am not so sure he could. I pity him in fact.”
Semen spurted down Draco´s throat and he swallowed greedily. He could feel Harry´s eyes upon him, but he still couldn´t see shite.
He knew that Malfoy had hated every single order he had been given, but he had done it anyway. Sure, it was under the threat of his parents´ lives, Harry had seen Voldemort torturing Malfoy´s mother until the blond caved and took over the torture session of innocent Muggles himself.
later.
Teddy kept on screaming and someone shouted to cast a silencing spell on the boy, which made McGonagall stare so coldly the Hufflepuff 6th-year flinched. Harry met Meda´s apologetic eyes silently begging him to take the boy knowing that Harry was always the only one to calm down Teddy unless they wanted to wait half an hour for the screaming to stop. Harry nodded and the sigh Andromeda offered was barely visible, but Harry noticed.
“Potter…” It was meant to be a yell, or a growl even, but it sounded almost… pleading…
“I will not promise you anything, Weasley, but I will speak with him at the very least.” He nodded to Lovegood as she began leading him upstairs.
“Fuck!” Seamus cursed. He didn´t waste another moment, removing his clothes and scrambling onto the bed. He met Malfoy´s eyes and noticed the bastard even smirked at him. “Are ya´ sure? I didn´t mean to…”
Draco was sitting in the Slytherin common room with his two best friends, Gregory Goyle and Blaise Zabini, wondering how they were going to get Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson and the annoying used-to-be-useful Vincent Crabbe out of their way, so the three could talk privately.
It fucking hurt to breathe, Draco thought. At least he wasn´t dead.
Harry nodded. His friends and family, who had decided to be here, too, to witness the ´ferret´ get what he deserved, looked at him appalled at the idea that he, of all people, would speak up for this bastard.
“Of course it matters! If you really love me, then you should-“
“If you fancy him that much why don´t
“Promise me…”
Draco shrugged unconsciously and went back to finishing his breakfast. He wasn´t
“That´s rubbish!” He sat up. “We love each other, why can´t we just-“
Draco stared at the old brown door, took a deep breath, and then another breath, before finally opening the door quietly.
The other nipple received a pinch and Harry gasped. Draco smirked.
You´re in trouble now Draco...
Harry felt bad for his best friend and he wanted to confront Malfoy for making a complete arse out of Ron; never mind that it might have been Ron´s own fault. He told his friends to go on ahead, that he had to speak to professor Weasley, and he did have a free period that neither Ron nor Hermione did now so they left without too much trouble.
“What are you doing mate?” Seamus wondered.
… Oh god, you won´t believe it guys…” Goldstein’s´ voice trailed off when he went back to the inform the rest of the room that Goyle was wanking Potter off at this moment. The outbursts that followed were thunderous.
“I´m so glad you asked that, Granger. It´s the essential element of this game. I will draw the first card of the deck,” and showing it to the room, “3 of Clubs, which means that I need a Hufflepuff up here.” Megan Jones rose to her feet first and walked to Goldstein with everyone´s eyes resting on the brown-haired girl.
Dumbledore´s burial seemed so far away, a year to be exact.
“Mr. Potter, you may come forth to give deliver your speech,” he heard the man instruct, and Harry did.
“You´re cute while sulking…” Then he laughed even harder. Draco kissed him to shut him up. It worked and Harry placed his long fingers into blonde locks as he moaned. “I saved myself for you...”
“Most of us know each other by last names only, so why don´t we take a minute to get familiar and I´ll explain more. I have taken the liberty to have name tags made, you should bring these every Friday if you come back. I´ll call your names and you come up here to fetch your tag.”
He wasn´t cut out to
Draco huffed and was about to sit, his eyes never leaving the potions book he was reading, when someone yelped. Draco nearly dropped the book as he was suddenly aware of the green that was Potter´s orbs shining up at him from the chair he almost sat down in. Of all the places in the damn school he had to run into the git in it had to be in the bloody restricted section of the library, that only students who studied potions or Dark Arts in eighth year were allowed.
“Harry, you know we love you, we all do, but Ron and Neville are right you need to go in there," Hermione added. "You can´t leave it like this. I never knew how hard his life was and frankly, I never cared, I don´t think I do right now even, but you care… for God´s sake Harry, you declared your love to the man… which I´m sure you´ll tell us about…”
“Stupid Potter, stupid…” He plunged his tongue into Harry´s mouth, tasting every inch. “You can give me happiness; no one ever gave me that.”
Harry pulled Draco closer and pushed his tongue into his mouth. Draco moaned and it sent lovely shivers down Harry´s spine.
“Whoa,” Dean said, and Harry looked at Ron who hadn´t said anything.
Greg and Blaise have shared a man on more than one occasion, just like Blaise and Draco have shared a woman once, not to mention all the times the three men had their own one-on-one going on. Greg and Blaise have snogged but never been inside each other, and they would never end up a couple. They were too good of
“Gryffindor House is next. Harry Potter. Ronald Weasley. Dean Thomas. Seamus Finnigan. Neville Longbottom. Parvati Patil. Hermione Granger. And yet another brilliant witch, who was permitted to move a year ahead, Ginny Weasley.
“Fuck off, Ron,” he said and leaned back in his armchair beside Dean, who coughed in a poor attempt to cover the loud laugh he had emitted.
The chairman once more had to ask for silence in the courtroom.
Draco straightened. Ron still had his hand on his shoulder, maybe to stop him from running away. “You know what that would mean Mother.”
Tears were sliding unnoticed down his cheeks.
Well, okay, Greg was still his best friend, but Draco was simply annoyed with his friend´s attempts to hook him up with Potter. For the past week, Greg had been trying to trap the two alone in the same room, but each time either Potter or Draco had ducked away successfully.
“I´m not lying, Potter,” he drawled.
Naturally, Ron and Malfoy saw it differently, and that was their problem, really. Harry was sure if one of his parents had been teaching, he would have hated being favored over the other students. Really, he already knew how that felt after all, with his damn `the boy who killed Voldemort´ image.
“Enough!”
Draco removed his shoes, which fell to the floor with a thump. The sound startled Harry, but he didn´t move. When Draco was beside Harry, he lay down.
“Because throughout the last year I have gotten to know the real Draco Malfoy, both by following him around, but also through Voldemort´s mind. I have come to see that he is not only a stubborn, proud, arrogant bastard... well, I will not deny that he is all of those things.”
The Great Hall fell silent the moment the former head of Gryffindor House rose to her feet to address them after the sorting of the new first years. The students were excited to be back, to be able to return and not worry about Voldemort anymore, to meet up with friends or quarrel with foes, and to eat like kings and queens every day.  The lessons and the schoolwork that followed, they would have to live with.
“You may step down Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy, if you have any last words before we retire to decide on your penalty, this is it."
“Noo… you wouldn´t…” Harry´s entire body shook and he looked to the floor. He blinked away the tears he could feel dropping softly. Tears of sorrow, tears of confusion, tears of anger.
“Everyone knew you hardly ever made any effort to study, so your damn skills had to be natural for the most part. Some of them Granger must have put into that stubborn head of yours, but that would only be the theoretical parts, the rest was all you.”
Draco tuned out for a moment; he was in shock. Harry knew the
A slimy, disgusting, dictating murderer.
“I love touching you.” He gave another dizzying smile.
.” Surely that had been the wrong thing to say as Harry flipped Malfoy down on the bed so he lay sprawled on his back, his head between his two friends. Harry pounced on the blond, straddling his hips and making sure to crush and grind as much as possible against Malfoy´s dick.
