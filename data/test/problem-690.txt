An oddly familiar expression, that sneer, and then, too, Draco hadn't even realized Harry smoked! Muggles smoked; he'd seen it in films. Wizards were pipe people, mostly. But Harry—smoking! It must be some new affectation; he shrugged it off without comment, though barely. If offended him; he'd heard it was harmful. They'd speak of that later, ta ever so. No, he'd make a point of it; he'd never want Harry inhaling that weird Muggle smoke, nor ruining his heroically lovely lungs,, but there were more important matters now, more immediate ones at least. He needed those lungs in his life, breathing his air.
Yes, he'd tidied his person up a bit but he was nothing like his usual. A blind man could see he was laboring beneath a heavy weight. A deaf man could hear the unspoken 'please' which flavoured every syllable out of his mouth. He might as well say it aloud as much as he could manage; what did he have left to lose by begging, by playing the cur Hermione named him? If he was to be the dog here, he'd be the terrier, the one who always ferreted out his rat?
-whisper under his breath, half hoping Draco would hear and half hoping he wouldn’t, either. It would complicate things if he did; it would clarify things if he did—it would lay them wide open to scrutiny if he did, and—
"And that spell for clearing up spots—Hermione, come over here for a half-sec, will you?" Patil was crouched at the knees of the poor beleaguered ex-Gryffindor, staring at him intently, as if he were a rack of beef hanging at a butcher's.
Draco rolled in his sleep, disturbed by Harry’s voice and the inquisitive poke. Nearly squashing his bedmate as he did so, the unconscious twat. Harry wriggled frantically out from under, cursing his deprived childhood like the dickens. In a world that was right and good
Albeit by dodging the coffee table and Harry’s haphazardly discarded rucksack. He glared at the spilt scrolls and files in passing. Halted a few steps before the doorway and turned back to face his flatmate.
Ron only shrugged, unrepentant. “Hmmm,” he muttered, eyes fixed on Harry’s piercing scan of Slytherin. “This is verra, verra interesting, mate. Must admit I’m intrigued, yeah.”
"I," Draco's voice was low and croaky; he cleared his throat and shifted the lay of his arse upon the thin mattress they were renting by the hour. "Didn't know."
This wasn't something Draco could stand seeing in his head or for real, no. It had taken hours upon hours of Point Me and scouring the streets for stray gossip just to track Harry down to the
To tell the brutal truth, all unadorned, he was far beyond mere 'wanting' and well into mindless craving, and generally within the blink of an eye and a reflexive inhalation every single sodding time that doubly-cursed ex-rival of his marched blind (and naturally entirely oblivious of Harry's monstrous hunger) into Harry's bailiwick. Which happened to occur with the stunning regularity of the usual sunrise, naturally, as Hogwarts was by definition a boarding school and all the students lived in. Ergo, it was all Malfoy, Malfoy, Malfoy, all the time; day in and day out, straight on to bleeding infinity—or so it seemed to a hapless, dreadfully smitten Harry Potter.
Harry quirked his eyebrows, felt the tiny frown growing on his forehead smooth out, just like magic. Watched Draco, same as he'd suss out a napping dragon he'd had the bollocks to tickle.
He sighed glumly, assessing the state of teapot. One last lukewarm cuppa and he’d go somewhere. Maybe not the Manor but somewhere. Else. There was very lovely flower market located off of Dilly’d Alley and--
"Mmmm-aahhhh! Watch it, Harry!" Draco gasped when Harry was bit too enthusiastic—but he did nothing to prevent it, either, the ravaging of his bared chest by teasing tongue and flexing lips. "Missed—you—too—you-great-prat! Mind the teeth, now! That smarts, you little prick!"
He didn't understand at all why Harry was only blinking at him, and not saying that much-wanted 'Yes, Draco—I will!'
He fingered the pendent Harry had given him for Valentine's whilst he waited for Lucius to regain speech. It was somehow immensely helpful in restoring his disturbed inner equilibrium: a tiny golden snake, with emerald eyes. He'd gifted Harry with a whole new wardrobe and the latest model Nimbus in return but hadn't felt as though either was really effectual in demonstrating his happiness with having Harry in his life.
"Nhh," Draco mumbled—steady neck-chewing tended to distract him righteously—"um, ah! Oh, right there—that's it. Ahhhh...I dunno—I, really, Harry—can't see it—they'll just..."
Draco cleared his throat a second time; coughed genteelly when his Adam's apple must've stuck, mid-swallow. He'd gathered himself together, preparing to move in some decisive direction; Harry felt the vibrations through the conduit of the mattress. He tensed, helpless in the near-Stygian darkness that had done nothing useful to muffle ill-conceived confessions.
“Yes! Now move it, Potter.” Draco very nearly shouted, but managed to keep his tone level by dint of almost cracking those back-teeth he'd been so assiduously grinding for the better part of an hour into a tight, hard clench. He sniffed instead, imperiously. “Your Unspeakable arse is required this instant.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded, casting his natural caution to the winds, and focusing on the real issue, as he perceived it, at least. “I know. But also--is it really fair to him, Pans? He’s been away for so long, you see, and I don’t want it just to be propinquity and his knowing we’re good in the sack together so maybe we should just make it official or something. That's not good enough. It wasn't then and it's not now, not for me.”
gift—his matching bracelet from Draco, the wonder of all wonders—was clasped firmly about his exposed wrist.
"Potter! Harry!" He needed to know—his mind was going to go sideways any second now, and he needed to know if Harry was—if Harry was?
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry replied absentmindedly. The ever-changing angle of the sun across the sky outside—as well as inside the Great Hall, painted right above them on the magical ceiling—was creating some rather interesting effects in Malfoy’s equally magical hair. “I think.”
"You! You're a hero, remember?" Malfoy taunted, leaning close. And closer yet, his fine grey eyes narrowing with intent, his arms bunching muscle as he flexed them, till he was arched over Harry like some great hungry raptor over an unlucky bit of terrified fluff. Harry was far from being frightened, though; on the contrary, he was beyond all that. He ceased any attempt at inhaling or fleeing and only stared up at Malfoy entranced; he didn't want to miss an instant of viewing Malfoy's pores up close and personal; nor a second of this golden and unexpected opportunity for bathing in that Malfoy air, that Malfoy sensation. "Do what heroes do, Harry. Take action."
“Not the same illustrious Wizard, Harry, but thanks,” Malfoy was hardly ever at a loss, and shagging Harry Potter had been a great restorative for his battered feelings, after that awful Seventh Year. “Ever so. You like this, then?”
Finnegan, and Thomas, and Merlin knew who knew what other ex-Gryffindors were involved in this cozy little in-ex-House debacle, but Draco bet it would amount to the whole pitiful lot of them, one way or another) to be his bosom buddies. His mates, his pals, his extended family. It was an after-effect of the war, Draco figured, the way Harry felt about these people and in a way it had worked to his decided advantage. Harry had such a huge heart, under all that lousy grooming and careless manner.
Or mayhap not strange at all. Or, rather, not any more strange than Harry's usual circumstances, so it rather equated to being
"What?" Harry demanded intensely. "Are you talking about? Seriously, Draco, you're starting to frighten me now. A 'condition', you say? What does that even mean? Really, you need to rest more. I was always telling you that, back at uni, remember?"
He was bleeding internally or that's what it felt like; he was mortally wounded and this, at least, could not be recovered from. He'd fucked it all up, bollixed it totally, and it was hopeless, and Harry—oh, Harry!
"Oof!" Harry exclaimed, fingers gingerly finding the lump upon his left temple, carefully feeling about for the inevitable bruise. "Watch it with that thing, Hermione! It's a lethal weapon!"
“Shut up and watch the match, you two. And don’t ask stupid questions. It’s called school spirit, for your information. And we Slytherins had better be making a show of it.”
"Harry," he said again, having fortunately cornered his prey at the back entrance to the Leaky a few frustrating hours after the massive flat clean-up. 'Harry', he' d said, any number of times in the last few, all to no avail. Harry was a stubborn cuss, and Draco liked it. But he didn't like it so much now, directed at him. "Harry,
“That could be, Harry. But…it sounds to me, ah, as if you’ve put a fair amount of thought into this.
Last year he'd not known what to give Draco. Other than his arsehole, his willing body, his furtive kisses, all those. But Draco had those anyway, and Harry thought they might not be enough, quite. He'd settled for calfskin gloves, handmade, lined with Charmed cashmere, and the hope that Draco's hands would warm to match his heart.
a tad…impetuous, I admit. He's—well, he's given to these somewhat rustic attacks of gallantry. Misplaced, of course, but still, you—and I—must make some allowances for it; he's been through a great deal of difficulty already—and it's rather charming, really, how he bashes about, you see, finding his way often through sheer naïveté. I've grown accustomed, y'see, and it's not so ba—"
"Really? Wasn't sure, when I came in," Harry glanced up, grinning wryly. Perhaps he wasn't as sodden with Firewhisky as Draco had thought. The light in his eyes seemed almost…intelligent. "That you were—missing me, that is. Thought you were vexed with me, Draco, instead. Not too fond of our Lav, are you?"
“Man up, Harry!” Hermione hissed, jabbing him painfully with a wicked elbow. “Give the arse a whack, will you? And make it sharpish! He deserves it!”
"Ohhhh!" The Weasel clutched his stomach with both paws and began to rock. It was rather...pathetic. "Oh-ho-ho-ho!"
“I’m sure he is, rather,” Pansy said grimly. “You ran off, Draco, and just left him. Now, listen to me.”
"For me, at least." Harry sighed. What use was anger now? It wouldn't help matters—and Malfoy hadn't done a thing but exist. Sexily, sultrily, attractively—right in Harry's path, the git. "Pardon me for being in touch with reality, but he'll never look my way
"Of course I mean it!" Draco was quite indignant now that the first hurdle was cleared. He'd deal with his own Head and Dumbledore privately; no need to worry Potter with details.
"..ve. Me… here?" Draco trailed off, staring around at the newly done up front parlour of Grimmauld. "...
“Oh! Right on, Hermione,” Draco said happily, a great more enthused about life than he’d been for some time.  "The Manor will like that, very much. A willing victim. Yours, too, Harry. There's bound to be some couple out there in Wizard-dom who really craves that genuine brothel experience. Takes all sorts, right?"
Harry rubbed his palms together, eyeing the still singing git. The glassware had began to hum in protest.
Was a bracelet inside, not a ring. He was too afraid to purchase a ring, not knowing what Draco would say to it. Or perhaps it was more that he was terrified of how Draco would look when he opened it: taken aback that Harry had even presumed. Shocked, perhaps, and then…and then probably kindly cautious. Forgiving, even, his real response tucked well below the ingrained civility, the perfect mask.
"It's alright, then? Draco?" Potter peered up at him, panting a bit and scanning Draco's pale features anxiously. "Draco! Talk to me, git! Don't just stare at me!"
"Um." Granger stared wall-eyed at Draco, a faint blush rising fast upon her youthful cheeks. "Um, um. Uh, Harry? Why is, ah—why, precisely, is Malfoy here?"
He'd admitted to himself, hadn't he—and now to Hermione and Ron. He'd…feelings…for Malfoy. Honest ones, that went well beyond just smelling the git—or jumping his bones at first opp. But...ohgods! But—!
"Merlin fuck, Malfoy!" he gritted, meeting the hip swivel action with glittering eyes and a growing feeling of inevitability: had it always been only this they'd each wanted? All the other had mounted to only some years-long sort of rough foreplay?
Silence was all he got in response. Dreary, awful silence. One dull thud of his heart; two; three—would this moment never end?—and his heart beats were getting faster, as this rather indescribably awful sensation swept through Draco's body (one part shame, one part terror, two parts or more, even, of excruciating embarrassment). What would Potter say to that? What
"Yes, tomorrow. How many times must I repeat that, Potter?" Draco sniped. "Are you having trouble with the concept of time passing? See, today is Friday, all day, and thus tomorrow is Saturday, according to the Gregorian calendar, established as of—
to her dive of an apartment on Pathetique Alley and help her mend her clogged sink. Or anything else she needed fixing up, now that the so-savvy Seamus was fled with his dark paramour to the sunny climes of Barbados and hasty tropical divorces.
Yet he asked this as if Harry's reply would mean less than nothing to him, in a manner so incredibly casually curious Harry shuddered, wincing.
"Darling, really." Mumsy had tightened her perfectly polished fingernails—both sets now and set firmly upon both of his papa's rearing shoulder. "Be still." A straining Lucius was abruptly hauled back from the Manor's Floo fire. "Shut it now; there's a dear. Let Draco handle his own life for once."
“Here!” he exclaimed, his gaze instantly fixed back on that slender speeding form. “You see that? That’s what I meant when I said a natural! He is, you know. Filthy bugger.”
"No, really—forget it," he muttered, grateful not to have completed the original impulse. Or at least not to have put his thoughts into words. "S'not important." And it wasn't, nor even practical. It was just that he didn't quite know what else he was supposed to do, given the circumstances. The bloody circumstances.
sake, Malfoy, find him and talk to him, you pitiful prat. Make him see reason; go down on your knees if you must. Apologize, if nothing else! Tell him you didn't mean it, that you'll do anything if he'll just come back. Lie through your teeth, but do it!" She stomped a small foot at Draco, who jumped, twitching. "Or bloody well die trying. Because you'll wish you had, if Harry's not happy. Again—
“Never thought you would, Harry,” Luna said immediately, reaching out her free hand and placing it gently atop Harry’s wrist, fingers curling 'round in a faint echo of her steady grip from earlier. “Not for an instant. But I do wish you weren’t lonely like this. That’s all.”
Draco howled again, arching his throat, sweat-drenched head lolling. He could feel the weight of his lover, hot and as damp with perspiration and musk as he leaning hard against his spine and hips. It was perhaps the best thing in the entire world, all that lovely Pottery sensation, in and above and all about him.
Their cast continued all through, unabated, the showers of magic thickening in the air and settling like invisible rain into the undisturbed dusts and sediments below. Already the Lines looked fresher, more potent, as if the magical rain had infused them with new life and clarity. Harry began to pant near the end of of it; he’d not been joking when he’d said it was hard work, the Hygieian, and he knew they’d all be exhausted by the time they went straggling back to the quarters they’d been given at Castelobruxo.
“No more than you,” Draco replied equably enough. He smiled, giving a quick nod. “But go on, then. I’m all ears.”
“Not for the Manor either," Draco said. A hearty Molly Weasley luncheon and several hours spent in jolly company had done wonders for his nerves. "Wish it were that easy, what? But no. It’s sort of more sadly mundane, is what. Domestic, even. Mum says it does happen with the old homes,” he went on, shifting against the warm weight of Harry pressed up against his side. “They want to be useful, apparently, and ‘useful’ equates to chock o’block with family.” He shrugged philosophically. “It’s what they do, after all--house people. Ancient bloody Magic.”
, in its purest form. You have to admit, Pans, Theo; the berk’s got some serious moves on him, if nothing else! He can maneuver a broom like a bloody demigod! He’s a shoo-in for a professional career!”
"I'm." Harry's fingers slid from where they'd gripped Draco's upper arms, relaxing enough to trickle and slide and grasped and found their eventual way between two close-clamped elbows, squirming through the gaps, meeting up and latching tight on the other side, where Draco's spine bowed inward. Clenched interlaced till Harry's knuckles turned white and Draco swore at the painful intensity. "I'm
Harry spelled it clean and even went so far as to summon a tablecloth from the linens cupboard, shrinking it down to an appropriate size and accessorizing it with some rather fetching matching napkins Narcissa had Owled them over from Italy.
when that selfsame heap of blazing ginger temper had had the gall to pop up in their Floo at three in the same bloody morning, also weeping cauldrons of foolish tears.
He gulped, waiting anxiously for word of his fate. Eyed Harry pleadingly, his hope for a merciful release rising with every blink of those green eyes. But, no. Not that easy.
And then Draco had started with this rapid mumble-whisper drone, his voice barely audible. Harry had only caught bits-and-pieces and all throughout his strange little fit Draco only seemed more and more wild and odd. Mad, maybe. Possessed b y that mysterious box he kept turning over and over in his hands.
Draco smirked, pleased as punch. Harry gasped and shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting about suspiciously. Of all things, Harry was squeamish Draco's little gestures of his affections; the one fault he truly possessed, if one were to ask his boyfriend.
It was rather…heartening, that. Lent Draco some additional courage, not that he needed any. He had plenty of bollocks, did Draco Malfoy. No one suffered Voldemort in his own home for that long a period without developing some sort of spiny backbone.
“You don’t say. Really? Sounds smashing." Draco blinked at the mental picture, momentarily feeling slightly appalled at all that might go dreadfully wrong should the spells fail. "Right. Of course, Mum, but you know I've always mounds and mounds of work, right here at home. Hard to steal away.”
“Ack, Mills! Stop already, will you?” Harry fell back against the posh leather tufts of his posh office chair and snorted himself into a giggle of his own, flapping his free hand at her. “He’s bloody ninety if he’s a day, alright? And I think already taken, even if I did prefer older men. Which I don’t, ta ever so. Not that it even matters, right?”
He moved to casually lean up against his desk, the very image of success, what with his well-cut clothes and his little smirk, and regarded the painting, which was especially blue and only a little melted-looking. At least for a Picasso.
“Mmm, no, not that I’m aware of. But it’s only been a few weeks, you know?” Draco replied easily enough after a moment, idly picking at the ghastly pattern on the Cannons rug with one hand and toying with the telly remote with the other. “Give it time. I do believe the Manor’s a bit ecstatic to have them housed there; likely pulling out all the stops. Certainly it seems to be easing up on me personally, and that’s all to the good in my book." He shuddered dramatically. "Spider-decked mobiles and dizzy ducklings are
Draco instantly looked away and mumbled. "Sick of him poaching." He brought his bent knees together with a thump. "Annoying."
Potter, like Draco, had chosen to play Seeker this one final year of schooling. He, like Draco, alternated games with the Seventh Year Seeker, and, as an added bonus, Headmistress McGonagall had elected to increase the number of matches by half again. Plenty of time to observe Potter, then, and make certain he wasn’t rising too far ahead of his main competition, Draco Malfoy.
Summary: Draco's Veela heritage impels him to make permanent his relationship with Harry Potter. He needs a certain special family heirloom to make that happen. Potter's cooperation would be useful, too.
, and be woken up already tardy for his coming day, with Ron or Neville or sometimes both of them shouting loudly in his ear.
"No!" Draco gathered his magical core, concentrating. The duplam penetratum wasn't easy and he'd need all his remaining attention—which wasn't much, given how Harry's skin undulated across his own. It was like holding a Harry-houri, a sensual wisp of liquid quicksilver desire. He clung, gripping harder to spine and to buttocks, changing grasp to upper arm and to nape. "No, it's all wandless. Just say the spell, Harry. And, er...trust me."
"Draco." Harry was very seriously set upon this silly notion of his; clearly, as he saved the use of Draco's given name for those occasions when he wanted to wheedle. "Draco, I can't stand it. Dunno how you can, either. Come on, git! I want to be seen with you; I want it known, alright, and to do that we'll need some support. They're my best mates, damn them, and they
"You look quite--quite--" He shrugged helplessly, peering at Potter, who was apparently unfazed by the state of his workplace.
"I," Draco muttered dully, his chin dropping, his formerly overly eager hands clenching uselessly in search of the comfort of the little velvet box that contained the family ring that would've tied Harry to him irrevocably. It was gone—he'd hardly noticed its absence. He didn't care much now. "I…understand. Well…right, then. I am…I am sorry to have troubled you. Trust me when I say I shan't be doing it again, Harry."
But this was good. He’d accomplished something at last. He was setting the stage—and setting things to rights.
“Sheesh,” Pansy sneered. “Anyone would think this was actually of interest, darling—instead of being the most deadly dull sport alive.” Theo nodded his agreement, the little shit.
Like this evening. When they’d been sharing some really brilliant time together. Draco had been under the impression things had been going really very well. Matey, like the old days.
He could care less if she was Harry's old schoolmate from Gryffindor; he could give a flying pig—or fig—or wig—if she was in the midst of a messy divorce from that Finnegan chappie (up the Irish, mainly for realizing Brown was not all that; besides, Draco was rather pleased to learn Finnegan was breaking up with his horrid wife over that rather fit bloke, Dean Thomas.
Draco did a little dance of his very own, pattering about the planks, of gratuitously shared joy, waving his arms and his expensive omniculars with abandon. He might’ve stomped a toe or two in passing, but no one cared a whit.
"Huh," Harry crinkled his scarred brow thoughtfully, his chair legs half lifted off the flagstones. "Alright. But, you know, I'm not truly convinced she's really gone off. I tell you, she's a menace. She lurks. Just like Filch."
“Uh-huh!” Harry gargled, sitting straight and still as he possibly could manage, and decidedly not leaning into the curve of Draco’s arm at his back as he so fervently wished to do. “Yes, those!”
“Just,” Harry sighed. “Why does this always happen with you? You know I can’t say anything about my job and still you egg me on unmercifully!”
And…why now? In a few more months, he’d be free of the git; never have to lay eyes upon him again, really, if he didn’t choose. Excepting maybe to hear about him on the wireless, when Potter was recruited for pro Quidditch.
he should be, and that this cave with its Paleolithic symbols and glorious art spoke directly both to his magic and to his heart. No amount of missing Malfoy could change that.
"Well, fuck that with a swizzle stick. We're running out of time for this blasted assignment, damn it. Needed the old bat around…for once in my life."
But…they’d not exactly been pally, he and Potter. It could be…awkward. And Draco, lying awake night after night, unable to sleep, had come at last to one conclusion: he couldn’t let another day pass without telling Potter what he thought of his flying.
Three hundred sixty-five days had, after all, already fled behind him, a collection of tastes and smells and magics, touches and views and well-met strangers he could simply not imagine being without.  Solstice morning dawning over a desert resplendent with the symbols of Pre-Columbian magic?
"Yes, Draco," Parkinson added, "have you thought of something new? Please, please, say you have, darling. I'm so fucking bored!"
Two days previous he and Luna had been busy in Poland; a day prior to that, racketing about Norway. There, yes, there were always Dark Magic forces at work, attempting to wrest the power of the Elder Signs to their own petty nefarious purposes. But Nazca had generally proved smooth sailing until recently, the last real Dark flare-ups in the area having occurred more than fifty years before his and Luna’s Journeymenship.
Morning, noon and night Draco saw the damn Nursery suite and each time it seemed to be even more insidiously inviting, somehow.
C'est incroyable! as his Grandme're would've announced in her lovely French-tinted accents. C'est magnifique! Grandfather Abraxis had been the last Malfoy to adore his helpmeet in this fashion. It was only that cruel accident claiming his wife's life that had turned him to the Dark.
“Yes, you git!” Harry replied, and sank his hands into Draco’s trailing robe lapels, hauling him closer by main force. “Now, more—and faster! Quickly, as he’s likely coming!”
Draco closed his eyes, shutting out the flickering images on the telly. It was peaceful. The rug was warm over their legs and the murmur of the telly was soothing. He had his best friend in the world sitting next to him and they’d even managed to have a meal together. Their flat, for all that it had taken the combined powers of Hermione, Pansy, Theo--who was big in Wizarding real estate now--and even Minister Shacklebolt, who’d pulled a few strings for them in the paperwork department--their flat was both spacious and cosy, Wizarding and Modified Muggle, located perfectly, and it felt like a real home to him. More so even than Draco’s beloved Manor did at the moment, despite all its freaky antics. Perhaps especially because of those magical antics!
"Oh, I do," Draco's eyes glittered, the melt stayed for a moment. Suddenly the noise of the café seemed much heightened; Harry noticed it, just as he noticed the death grip Draco had on his collar. "I do know, but—"
Harry snorted. “I can’t believe you want to be an Auror, too, Ron. It’s all about stealth and subtlety, mate; Kings was telling me. Right, Hermione?”
Draco opened grateful eyes to a crowded, low-ceilinged country kitchen with a feeling of utmost relief, and felt Harry immediately relax beside him.
“Because you’re a heathen at heart?" Draco grinned. "No, I don’t know, really, Harry, but I do know what you mean, sadly enough. Oof, but that does feel good,” Draco answered, wiggling his own toes in his Molly-made socks, propped right alongside Harry’s. “Hmm. Bit chill in here, though. The Muggle air cooler machine Theo insisted on having installed must take after you, Potty."
Harry glowered, briefly, mutinously. Earned a quick smooch on his nose tip for punishment; a narrow-eyed glance.
"Draco?" Harry's voice and eyes were both concerned. He'd obviously not heard Draco confirm he'd wear this ring—would be proud beyond belief to flaunt it. And Draco couldn't bear to look; he closed his eyes to shut out Potter's searching ones. He couldn't possibly say something like that again—not in public!
, the silently sitting telly, the very dust itself. Nothing a Charm couldn't remedy but who cared? Who really cared? "Fuck
“What?” he demanded. “ I don’t see the problem here, guys. Go on, eat your breakfast. We’ll be late, otherwise.”
Of course Potter caught him, because Potter. Well before Draco might've struck the smooth stones with his spinning head—he
Draco shook his head sharply, sending his fringe flying into his lashes. “Want to, actually. Owe it to you and it’s only fitting. You should be prepared.”
"Hmmm." Draco settled his arms 'round Harry's torso and shoulders; reeled him in. It was comforting; it was all he needed, to have Harry home again. The stomach acid that had been crawling up his esophagus for the last few hours burbled and thought seriously about subsiding, even. "Hmmm."
“Right. I do say.  Look here, Malfoy,” Harry said, as calmly and reasonably as he could manage, what with mentally biting his tongue on all the other words fighting to burst out of his mouth. “Stop haranguing me, please. It's over and nearly done with.  I’m here, it’s all fine--or will be, soon enough--and right now all I want to do is complete the blasted report and go home, alright? It’s not as if you give a minced shrivelfig if I keel over then, right? As long as the job’s done properly and I'm not going about blabbing departmental secrets to strangers. So, let’s simply do our damn job just as we ought and then I may go home and so may you." Harry grimaced at the pink flush that appeared high up on his partner's cheek bones, a sure sign of Draco's internal upset. "And maybe," Harry continued, "you might also stop acting as if it's a total disaster if something happens to me when you’re not around. Today was a stupid accident, that’s all. Could’ve happened to anyone, really. But absolutely not your fault, Malfoy--and I never said it was, either.”
“Feel how mature I am? And I’m just quivering in my boots, Puny Potter,” Malfoy chuckled, pressing his naked cock against Harry's bum crack. “
"Yes! Now stop fucking about and do it, Harry," Draco gritted. Ground his teeth and swayed forward, a little off balance, as he held Harry harder, tighter, nearer, till he and the wall and Harry were nearly a blend, an inextricable mix of young man and old dust and fresh paint, fumed with all sorts of desperation. His throat was so dry he croaked. "Do it. Now. See what's there for you, Harry. What's inside me. What's always been. I want you to."
Potter, outdoing himself and perhaps hyped up by the roar from the stands, flew at superhuman speed upside down and in reverse ‘round the entire Pitch—twice! The Snitch danced over his twisting wrist all the while, teasing, its short-lived freedom clearly doomed. The entire stands, excepting two chilled, querulous Senior Year Slytherins, was upon its collective feet and howling in excirtment.  All for Potter, of course.
“Unspeakably so,” Harry nodded mock-dolefully, kicking back idly at a sagging stack of papers and whatnot set beneath his desk. “But now I'm home we must spend some quality time, and soon. So?” He cocked a hopeful eyebrow, wrinkling the faded silvery tracing of his old scar.
“But,” Draco overrode Potty’s protest completely. “Has all the diagrammes laid out—very well presented.”
"Right, right—whatever you say, Harry. Well, come on, let's clear up," Draco urged, nodding. "I think we're done here, least for this evening. ake the book along with since we've still time. And we'll nip in first thing in the morning and question Pince, if we absolutely must."
Draco just had to say it. He knew he should have sent an Owl to his parents before now, informing them of his recent romantic entanglement, but he'd been waiting. For…for the time to be right, just as he'd been waiting for Harry to—
"Um," Harry moaned, writhing his upper body all over Draco's, in the way that drove Draco mental. "You're
"Harry, Harry—" Malfoy panted. Never ceased moving his lips across Harry's flinching skin, never lifted them or lost contact, but his dick stilled, finally, and Harry dazedly mused that he might very have its fiery head poking at his hapless lungs next. "Harry, this doesn't end here, you know?"
It was mesmerizing, really, the way it gleamed like that—so changeable. He couldn’t take drag his interest away fully for the life of him, not even if his mates were individually falling to pieces over brekkers, all around him. “Huh,” he said again, softly, doubly bemused. “Maybe so. Can’t say as I mind being poetical. Maybe it’s an adult thing.”
be allowed to happen. He did so want to have a bit more time in Potter's company, and it was only a day out to Hogsmeade, nothing major.
"No, Squidhead!" Harry growled, rushing up the spiral staircase to the room the Eighth Year boys shared. "You've got it all wrong-way-'round, as usual!"
Perhaps he should borrow Dennis Creevey’s inherited camera. He needed to nail down these so-changeable details—as an Auror in training should do, right? Should be able to accurately describe any potential perps, down to the last buttonhook and tie tack! Like that Muggle Sherlock did, actually.
"Well!" Draco snorted, never taking his eyes off the elusive door. “Which tactics didn't work for me at all, and here I am fetching up at the Nursery and just finding my feet are carrying me right on through, and then here I am, internally screaming, mate, while I find myself straightening the baby quilt on the wee little bed and folding fucking freshly laundered nappies!”
“Rah! Harr-eeee! Harrrr—reeee!” the crowds boomed all about him, and the raised wooden towers practically shook to pieces with it. Excepting, of course, Pansy and Theo, who only turned up their noses.
"Oh, yes," Draco Malfoy was very pleased with himself, it seemed. He regarded the length of Harry's slight rumpled figure with a fond and possessive eye, and Harry, feeling the sweep of it almost like a physical caress, thrust his spine up in gut reaction, jerking his hips so his cock jiggled within his shorts, chafing. "You're exactly what I've been wanting, Potter. Exactly."
Draco used his newly-bangled hand to dig out his billfold, forestalling the waitress's determined approach by throwing down a generous heap of Muggle money on the sticky, wrapping strewn table top. Kept hold of Harry the whole time, though, with the other unadorned one. Unless he counted it as being adorned with Harry.
“It's not about Ted," Harry replied seriously. "Fact is, he’s enjoying his time at Shell Cottage immensely and Andy’s enjoying the peace and quiet. She’s set to join your mum for a week or so, I believe? There’s nothing to worry yourself there, believe me. No, it’s more…” He paused, standing at ease with his capable hands clasped behind his back and a contemplative expression descending upon his handsome, mobile features. “It’s more...a personal thing, really. With Grimmauld specifically. Just...One of the reasons you must come, tonight. You have to see it for yourself. I can’t--I can't explain it, exactly.”
Draco, coming to himself with a snap and start, recalled exactly why he was in the midst of making an utter arse of himself, here on the cold flagstones of the enemy Common Room. Potter was ever so his! His, his, his! Undeniably and no one must forget that! The ring, then. Right! He needed it. Needed to ensure it was attached to its proper place in the universe: Harry's finger.
Perhaps it was the Gardens that really clued Draco in, absolutely blanketed as they were in baby’s breath and lavishly scented orchids and passion lilies, whilst all the poor Bachelor's Buttons had died off.
“Ahem,” Draco cleared his throat, which was tight for some reason. Yes, alright; Potter would win. Fact of life—but he still didn’t want to miss this. Too exciting—too educational, damn it! “You two, shut it. And Potter—come
Harry wrenched away as he whispered, ripping his person sideways and back a step, twisting nimbly, so the space grew between them form nearly nothing to what might very well become a whole universe. Till there was only his hands left on Draco's upper chest, splayed out wide and shoving. Draco, panicked, reacted immediately. "Wait—Harry, don't! Don't let go!"
Draco inhaled sharply, standing quiescent in Harry’s grip, and gazed down at him in all seriousness, his expression returned to bland but his eyes glittering with a firestorm of emotions.
"As to that," Harry inserted hastily, rising from his seat beside Draco and making his way 'round to the back of the sofa. "He's here because you two aren't listening very well, guys. So we—"
"No! I'm staying right here," Draco sprang to his feet and stalked forward, finally giving into his mounting urge to move. He would go spare if he sat for one moment longer and simply took this unwarranted dressing-down, this freaky weird fit of Harry's. All this newness about him, which spoke volumes of Harry settling in. And…and there was time enough to feel devastated later, by all his Harry was saying to him; but-right now he was
“That’s it!” Draco announced, jumping up. “That. Is. It,” he repeated, his voice absolutely deadly, a poison so rich as to drown out Potter’s puling noises completely. “That’s enough. We’re both knackered and you--you clearly have some issues to sort. Maybe I do too, alright? ‘M not fucking perfect and don’t I know it, okay.  But I am going to my room now, and I am going to have a decent sleep and I strongly suggest you do the exact same. So. Good fucking night.”  He spun on his socked heel, gritting his teeth, and started walking. “Hope you feel better in the morning, truly I do.”
"Ah." Draco sighed. That wasn't happening quickly, unfortunately. Kneazles had seemingly stolen his tongue, for all the good it doing him. "Hmm."
? Grimmauld, that old wreck? No, that's not right," Draco frowned, diverted. "You hate Grimmauld Place, couldn't wait to move out. That's not home, Harry. Home,
Prodding, but gently, at feelings he'd no name for. That other people had to identify for him. Ad teased him for, sometimes, as that was the way of his mates.
"Hold still, Harry," Draco chided, having wrestled him most the way round the tiny round café table, chair legs screeching eldritch across the tiled floor as they came together. He dropped a quick kiss on Harry's ear, murmuring sweet nothings about 'squirmy gits' and 'little fools who wouldn't stay put.'
"Oh, love, my love…" Harry whispered sweetly and thrust like the sodding dickens. "You—you're just—I fucking well love you!"
Narcissa batted her lashes at him, all innocent maternal love overflowing in bounteous waves. It was highly unlike her.
managed it by dusk fall, thankfully, and Draco took advantage of the golden opportunity to snog Harry quickly one last time, directly under the two Gryffindor's wrinkled-up noses (in horrified disgust, no doubt; Draco curled his own upper lip in stiff irritation and heartily wished them both to perdition), before they all headed off to their separate common rooms.
Draco hung on for dear life to the slick sweaty skin under Harry's armpits; they and taut thighs were his anchors.
—with a little something (from the Malfoy collection, preferably, as the jewels his family claimed were all rare and very valuable and there'd hardly been a chance, had there? to stop in where his Mother usually commissioned her pieces and order something bespoke); simply as a reminder of their, er…their new-found friendship. Things happened, after all, and Potter might be interested—nay, even comforted—by having a small wearable of harking back to the time they'd spent recently,
He wasn't an idiot; not he! He wasn't gullible, either—so, erm, what exactly was Malfoy implying? Odd, how?
He'd know, then, that Draco meant business; that this was a serious endeavour they were embarking on and one he'd not be able to back out of in a few short years.
"I know a few people who don't know him that well yet," Patil volunteered, swinging her head in close to Pansy's. "Want me to dig them up?" They commenced whispering furiously, sotto voce.
"Shut up, wanker, or I'll shut you up," Draco felt constrained to threaten the git, poking at his ribs ever so gently.
you on about, Ma-Malfoy?" he stuttered, barely cognizant of the fact he was in the throes of being bourn backwards in a thudding rush, arse over teakettle, or that one hand had slipped under the back of one of his knees and was yanking it upwards. "H-Hey!"
'Plan B', Draco concluded dizzily some time later, blinking through the layers of fabulously tasty Seeker Cake his Harry had happily smeared all over his kiss-damp face, was a raging Success.
“Of course, if you say so," Draco inclined his pale head regally, lips twitching, breathing a tiny internal sigh of relief that apparently his dear friend hadn't come completely unhinged. "Potter.”
should have something—something visible that'll say it for us, right? So people won't be asking after us all the time and making stupid comments—"
certainly don't, but not now. Now is for Hogsmeade and I'll be damned if I let you ruin my day out for me with stupid squabbling, any of you." He sent a speaking look in the direction of the Mud--er, Muggleborn Brain too. "Malfoy is here, with me, and here he will be—"
"Fuck!" Draco's hands came up to fend Harry off and he made as if to scoot himself out from under Harry's sudden bulk pressing his folded legs into the smooth rocks. "Fuck, Potter—what in Merlin's Arsehole are you doing? Where'd you even come from—?"
"Hmph!" Harry muttered, not bothering to glance sideways at the sure to be indignant stare he'd meet. "Bollocks. You're so convinced of it you were just bawling over it, remember? Tell me another, then."
"M'not a 'job', Potter!" Draco huffed righteously, right in Potter's worried face. "I'm a treat-and-a-half, you gumptious prat! Better be appreciating me, wanker. I wouldn't do this for just any old—"
“Arse,” Harry muttered affectionately, “that was purely a miscalculation on my part--which you know full well--and you may address me as simply as Archmage Potter or Runes Head now--though you know I’ll have to kill you if you do it in public. We don't bruit titles about, not in DoM.”
“Yes, well. That's a matter of opinion,” Pansy smirked. “Very scary subject, that, at least for some chaps. Not that you’d ever truly have a problem, dearest, since Mrs Weasley is the mum in Harry's case and Hermione's mostly giggles over her, thinks she's lovely. Which she is, rather, but! The point is, Draco, we’ve all been concerned about you and Harry, and it’s really only gotten worse since he landed that Unspeakable position and got himself shipped off to parts unknown for so very long--and with no word, other than the occasional postcard. Oh, oopsie. Sorry, darling. Wasn't even the occasional post card, was it? Poor you, love. All that time and not a peep from one you love." She frowned in sympathy, pursing her lips. "Still. You’ve been terribly close, you and Harry, thick as thieves, ever since uni and perhaps even before in some daft manner, who can tell, right? And we all know you two shagged each other rotten in uni, at least at some point, however briefly, so don’t even bother denying you, at least, are highly invested in Harry. It just seems so obvious to us and yet you are both wandering about that flat, acting like boobies and not doing anything positive about it.”
. The Child's Dressing Room turned up after one particularly anger-filled venting on Draco’s part, and contained suitable garb for every age of any child, from squalling newborn to stylish teen.
"Oh, yeah, mate!" Seamus laughed. "I'll just toddle off and ask the Headmistress if she's interested, shall I? She's tonnes of experience with schooling younger men, I wager!"
Harry didn't feel the same as he. Demonstrably. It was only the chill of the night air nearly stunning Draco mid-swoop that stopped the inevitable tears in their tracks.
"Potter, I don't want to waste much time here," he warned disagreeably, suddenly feeling terribly uncomfortable. "We've all sorts of places still to visit, remember?"
“What? Make what worse?” Harry demanded curiously, bustling 'round his desk and skirting the Runes detritus to grasp at Draco’s leading hand and give a good hearty shake, then pulling him firmly into the room proper. “You--you're so. So
The aromatic whiff of Malfoy striding past him caused Harry to stumble blind into perfectly stable objects, objects such as corridor walls and work benches and plush, forgiving sofas; it created a maelstrom in his chest and throat that rendered him both gurgling with hot-tongued lust and stammering with barely swallowed-back desire. It was a dangerous thrill assailing him in a precarious perch: the scent of Draco's robes, his verbena hair, even his bloody leather bookbag—a crisp scintillating odour that lent a keen edge to every word that Malfoy spoke to him in passing or—and this was contrarily odd but to be expected, as it was
Sadly, Jera was still paramount and there were more pressing problems than any of those happening in faraway lands. His agents in the field were competent, his agents at HO were capable, and it was his bounden duty to act the bloody Polestar he was meant to be now and trust them all to get on with it. Besides, Antwerp was frightfully insistent, as usual.
"Mmmm," Harry murmured sleepily, rolling over, "Draco. Have I told you I love you yet this morning?"
Giving it up as a bad job and far too fatigued to really even care, Draco settled, eyelids drifting down, heavier and heavier with every breath. In the hall the sconces burned low of their own accord and Harry had managed to fiddle the duvet about so it lay approximately in the right fashion. It was peaceful at last and Harry was toasty-warm, laying next to him, still latched on to Draco with lax hands and knobby ankles. Oddly easy to accustom himself to, Draco reflected sleepily, those tickling toes aside. Especially at nearly three o'clock in the morning.
"To us swearing our inseparable love for each other—with this ring," Potter bellowed out at top speed, "I beseech thee—love, hold fast, handfast, Bond and commit to our earnest intent--"
“Strong words, skimpy Scarface!” Malfoy exclaimed, but he did shove his cock far enough up Harry’s bottom to finally poke his prostate.
"Harry," he observed dryly, setting a long finger atop the book in his lap to mark the page he'd been just so engrossed by ostensibly, he'd barely noticed the abrupt eruption of a messy-headed, green-eyed, whisky-fumed man onto the special-order spark-proof hearth rug. "You've (and here Draco firmly swallowed down the grim 'finally' he wanted so to insert, judging it to be both petty and completely unworthy of him) returned. At last. A little late, aren't you?"
"…Proof?" Granger echoed, a species of shocked realization dawning upon her horrified features. "Oh,
"I can lend Nev my new broomstick," Goyle volunteered helpfully. "S'nice. Impresses the Youngers something fierce."
going off anywhere…it wasn't as though this whole scenario wasn't far too familiar. Harry just wished his git would play out his bloody insecurities with fewer theatrics—preferably without an audience. Because Neville looked to be ready to skin him for taxidermy and Ginny was quietly fulminating, her hair nearly sizzling. And the entire fucking restaurant of trendy folk was avidly watching Draco turn his back on Harry Potter, gawping.
He rose up, heedless of the grumbled murmurs of the lower Years behind him as he blocked their view of the match. First years were meant to be thwarted; he did so proudly, as a Senior.
"Go," Harry commanded stonily, caught on an unbroken loop of denial. Cruel as any lash, that. Draco winced, mid-syllable. "Please. Now."
He’d said ‘Fuck!’, as he recalled. And when Draco and he bumped into one another, as if by accident, after the match, he’d expounded further, thusly: ‘Fuck
Harry didn't love him. No, Harry didn't. It had all been but a mad dream and a silly lovestruck idiot's fancy.
She shrugged again, having collected a pile of apple slices. “Ignore him, too, Harry. Rise above; that’s what I do.”
“I want to come in you; want to fill you up. Want to claim you; want you to scream and shout. Wake Ron and Nev and shock Seamus and writhe when I pound you and beg for mercy when I lick you and—“
Potter blinked down at him, all long lashes trembling with curiosity and green, green, green as the fields in May, and Draco nearly lost himself in the sea of jade bordered by inky spikes, delicate as his own downy feathers. Those eyes—that face—that odd little half-grin-not-scowl he affected!
Not that every Runestone absolutely had to be made of stone; far from it! Journeymen Mages from the Isles had the long-standing habit of creating their own very special collection of stones, gems, pottery bits, wooden items and woven-works, and then magically inscribing them with their own especial markings. It was a quite elderly tradition and Flamel’s instructors had been enthusiastic about students continuing on with it. But with a bit of a twist in recent years.
Harry's chin wibbled; his eyelids drooped. He, too, was worn to a nub. Bad idea or not—Draco's ideas were often not so hot—the Hippogriff had been undeniably both hazardous and incredible. He felt like he'd been squashed flat, all the cum extracted from him.
“Ron should be taking note of this, too,” Harry announced. “Malfoy’s hair is clearly the same shade as Lake water. No question. Even a blind man can see that.”
Ron—being a git and now a git with some real sexual experience under his schoolrobes—only wrapped both his arms about his own shoulders and mimicked a heated making out session with his
“Chaz is in France, Hars,” Mills remarked, the little frown thoughts of her younger sibling dissipating and a set, professional mien settling across her pert features. “He’s reporting back that the Lascaux have been seeing an extraordinarily high level of magical and Muggle visitation. I think that bears investigation.”
His mother nodded again, seemingly quite satisfied with whatever internal conclusions she'd come to concerning the newly revealed Potter-Malfoy misalliance—but, true to her generally reserved nature ,she wasn't being exactly forthcoming. Draco could only surmise what that mysterious nod meant and that left him feeling understandably uneasy. Not for nothing was his Mum a Black by birth, Draco knew. Rather…eerie, those Blacks. Peered into one's head at a drop of a hat, they did. Not at all nice, that.
came, Harry Potter did; all at once with a great ejaculatory burst and bung up Draco Malfoy's willing channel like a hurricane. Draco arched his spine into receiving it as a kneazle would into a stringent petting session, practically purring even as he choked out the last of his own satisfaction.
"How—long?" Malfoy was insistent; he couldn't possibly go any deeper into Harry, but he did, impossibly. "How fucking long, Harry? Tell me!"
fourthly, mind—I'm Prefect and you're the resident boy hero. Hmm. Salazar's toenails, Harry. What ever shall we do with this fortunate circumstance, I wonder? As we're all alone."
"Where first, Malfoy? I want to go to Honeyduke's," Potter announced, not waiting politely for Draco to express his desires.
, you two,” Draco ordered, packing away his omniculars in their specially hand-tooled dragonhide case. Potter was well off the Pitch now; there was no point in staying any longer. “Cheeky!”
"Mmm," Draco wasn't commenting on 'poor Lav' at the moment. Likely he couldn't remain civil if he opened his lips to speak further of the Gryffindweeb female, in all her jiggly jugged glory and drippy mascara. But this—this was better, markedly so. His lot had improved vastly, compared to five minutes before: he'd Harry in his arms again, right where the little git should be. Where Harry was supposed to be, by all that was just and right in Draco's life. "Whatever, git. I, er—I missed you earlier—you didn't Owl me?"
He bloody well wished to be cast a'sea. He couldn't fucking even imagine being returned to that dreary state of 'not wanting'. So dreary, so lacklustre, so benign bland and boring. Bah!
He halted himself all at once, planting his palms flat upon the desk and leaning far enough forward over it to nearly smudge Harry’s specs all in one gracefully threatening motion, matching Harry glare for glare.
"I always see you." Draco groaned pure despair to Harry's explosive 'Pah!' and gave it up for a bad job, this straining to read Harry's expression. "Oh, please. Don't you know?" He dropped his aching head fully upon Harry's collarbone, wrapping his arms tight about Harry, holding fast still when logic would've presupposed they'd move apart. He couldn't budge; he was stuck fast. "Oh, gods, I always, always…just always, Harry. Don't you know?"
Potter’s fidgeting  ran directly counter to Draco’s plan to work his way into Potter’s confidence sideways and carefully—and then inform him baldly he admired him. For his, uh, form. Whilst flying. And his skill, which wasn’t either an accident not a prophecy, but a gift. Right. He’d confess that well after there was any chance of being laughed right out of the room by a disbelieving Potter. Naturally.
Maybe it was the fact that the corridors and staircases of his perfectly renovated, completely cleansed, void of all Dark Magic, fully equipped with the latest Wizarding-adapted Muggle mod cons, bloody silly-arse ancient old fucking family mansion had taken to steering Draco's steps willy-nilly to the Nursery at least thrice daily.
“Patience, wee Potter,” Malfoy cautioned. He ran a tickling set of fingertips down Harry’s chest, tweaking the left nipple as he went. “That’s one of the faults of youth, you realize? Always ready to jump into any situation at all, feet first. You adolescent Gryffindor-types never even bother to check first—such a crying shame, that.”
Draco snapped his teeth, sharply, simply recalling that terrible, awful scene. Harry had had to rush through the Floo after Luna wandered blithely through it, off on her way to parts unknown, claiming airily she wished to live her life solely in the company of the blasted Nargles from then on, and
“Food fight!” Seamus howled instantly and tossed the entire lot of cheddar-scrambled eggs at Neville. It was, effectually, an utter melee, in an instant. “FOOD FIGHT!”
"Ready?" Harry asked breathlessly. He ignored the comment; nothing he could say wouldn't incriminate him. His hands cupped his gift instead, caressing.
He sighed gustily, scowling dispiritedly at the unfinished Incident Summary, left askew where Draco had shoved it aside, and renewed exerting every ounce of his will towards foiling the bloody Veritus within him. He couldn’t say what he wanted to say but he could tell Draco a different truth, just as valid.
For an instant, Harry's face took on an odd, adult sort of expression—rather as if he were sucking a lemon—but then that was replaced by irritated anticipation. "Look, Malfoy, we've only about a half-hour, tops, before Ron and Hermione will come looking for me. We've already missed dinner and if you want to do this—"
"Right here, git!" he announced, and promptly took over Draco's lap. "Arsehole! Bloody yes, you snot-nosed git-faced-cowardly yellow-bellied git-of-all-gits!"
“My brother,” Millicent announced darkly. “Is now officially a teenager, at just the thirteen. Or so he's informed me. That’s quite enough for me and Mum, Hars. He’s all about the Muggle devices and hanging about intersections along Diagon with his puerile little mates and generally making a nuisance of himself. My wits are at bitter end. As is my small store of patience.”
"Oh, now…Draco, love," Harry gripped him fast before he could bolt, wrapping their damp satisfied bodies together into an affectionate embrace. "Baby. At least admit it was an effective tactic. 'Sides—I've set a recording spell on the Room. I've a sort of Pensieve of it, see? Muggle film, though; can be played back any time we like, right? All of it—us
as he did so--and he'd yet to find a single solitary moment that seemed quite 'proper' enough to correct his disquieting feeling of missing Malfoy and simply Owl the bloody man asking for a meet-up.
Harry tarried not a moment more; his Patronus galloped off, misting through his office door. Snatching up a handful of powder, he tumbled through his floo and nearly straight into Draco’s arms.
"Come on—spit it out, Malfoy," Potter urged. His lips were on Draco's temple at present, and he'd tugged insistently at Draco's neck and shoulders to get him to bow his unwilling head down those crucial inches so that they could rest there comfortably. Draco fought the increasing need to simply bury his crinkled forehead against Potter's collarbone and let him have his way. Potter always did in any case; the berk was an unstoppable force of nature. "Talk to me."
“Yes, of course!” Harry shook his head impatiently. “That and more. A fuck of a lot more, in fact! I’ve been literally dying here, wanting to tell you that. Have you not even noticed?”
"Never mind," he remarked, abruptly giving up the cause as 'lost'. Not as though that hadn't happened before, right? Fine. He'd manage. "Carry on then, prick. By all means, let's not interfere with what
Draco manfully squared his already square shoulders and assumed his best meditatively composed expression, radiating waves of calm all about him. Non-homicidal calm, though he, too, was miffed in a Malfoy sort of way. However, his object of irritation (though the same as his father's) was also his objet d'amour. And that was a sticky sort of wicket indeed. One could not pull an Othello on Harry Potter—it just wasn't done.
“He always makes me wish--just a little, mind--me and Gin had worked out, after Hogwarts. Or even Ollie; he’s always been such a nice chap. A few kids would’ve been brilliant, maybe. Maybe not, though.” He humped a shoulder, huffing out an impatient breath, nostrils, and slung a fast palm through his hair, ruffling it. “There was uni, and then my career here--" he gestured about his office--"and of course I knew I'd be immediately posted, erm, abroad. For quite a long time." He waved a hand, looking uncomfortable. "So, I suppose I can say it, you know? Wanting kids? But it wasn't ever even a serious thought for me. Children aren’t exactly an option, right? Not with my job.”
“Yes? What?” Potter’s dark ironic eyebrows had flown well up and away, arched inquisitively at Draco. His eyes were squinty-suspicious, true, but he wasn’t actively bridling, in readiness to spit insults, nor preparing to bolt off to hither and yon. Draco took that curt businesslike tones as a positive cue to continue on in his chosen direction of introduction. “To what, Malfoy?”
Very specialized publication; likely you’ve not noticed it, plebe, as Granger does all your reading for you.”
"Yessss—yeah!" Harry's eyes were closed, his back arched into a bow. "This—isn't—easy, you know?" he gritted. "Bast—
Malfoy’s beloved stars and constellations, weekend hols in sunnier climes. Teddy’s toothless smile, and then of the courage and dedication of the Mages who stood in his same place, casting power, a century before his birth, and those who will doubtless come to stand strong in the Great Chalice Form and perform their necessary duty in the future.
"Matrimony!" his father muttered darkly. He snarled, upper lip curled over canines Draco could swear were visibly lengthening. "With. Bleeding. POTTER!"
"Oh! I was forgetting. With Harry home again, you shan't want to be gallivanting abroad, will you? Silly me."
At least that was a huge step forward for him, he allowed. A year ago he wouldn't have said a sodding word about it, choosing instead to suffer in silence, with his festering inside him. Or lose his bloody temper and take it out on everyone around him, of he couldn't bear the pressure. And what a wanker he'd been, yes—but it had felt good, in a weird sort of way. Least he'd not been quite as weighted down by his bloody circumstances.
“Ten, then—and we’ll see about that,” Nott grinned, not minding Draco in the slightest, even though he was right there. “He might surprise you, the twit.”
"Oh—oh, yes!" Draco flushed and paled instantly, wincing at his hurry. "Sorry—sorry, I wasn't thinking." His snapped his fingers and Harry's arse went from chilled and flinching to toasty-warm and almond-oiled in the blink of a Squid's One Great Eye. "Harry? I—is that alright?"
Finally parsing, Draco shot to his feet without even really seeing that his mug was free-floating, only aware in a very distant way that Harry had suspended the bloody thing with a spell, stopping it from splashing him all down his fresh robes and the sofa. He stood, valiantly striving not to wobble, and gaped wildly down at Harry.
Then he finally got his arse in gear, the wanker. Ceased with the infernal teasing and threw himself into shagging Harry with great good will—and a bounteous lot of sheer enthusiasm, advanced years or no.
"…Draco. Draco." Harry's gaze flew swiftly, great green orbs of confusion behind the frames Hermione summarily replaced his old comfy ones with. He shoved them up his nose with the back of his hand, sniffing the air like a wary dog, his chilled fingers smoothing the velvet continuously. "Draco?"
Harry nodded absently, eyes sleepy behind his spec frames. Tugging and tucking away fussily at the rug, Draco could hear the sounds of the leftovers packing themselves away in the coolbox, and a rush of water splashing merrily into the sink. Cutlery clinked about as it was put away and the lid of the rubbish bin thudded shut. It was all very soothing and domestic to his ears--and it was  hugely different from the Manor. If he were still there, he’d have heard nothing of that; the Elves were far too well paid to let such sounds escape the kitchens. He’d likely have been subjected to the irksome piped-in sounds of childish lullabies instead, provided him courtesy the noisomely officious Nursery.
Utterly reversed, in fact, to a mirror image of what they'd been before. One day he was metaphorically drowning in Dark Lord-inspired guilt and terror and literally choking on his own blood from where the git's spell had sliced him open, the remains of his weak tears salting his wounds—indeed, had almost perished from that spell--and then the very next moment he was snogging his greatest enemy—and ruthless attacker—in the corridors and empty lecture halls and loos of Hogwarts, as if he'd been born solely for the purpose of doing so. And--this being the kicker, the icing on his pudding--being repeatedly assured by the school's ancient, doddery,  and entirely too knowing Headmaster that he personally didn't have to die or murder or poison anyone—that
last week," Harry continued on, unheeding. This particular offense of the world in relation his Malfoy-infested heart was a huge one; he was rightfully pained by it. Gossip about Malfoy and other people was simply horrid; should be outlawed, really. "Ginny said and she follows the Society pages, you know, and
"Ta, mate." Not waiting for a definitive 'yes', Harry slipped off his glasses and cast them floating towards the general direction of the night stand.  He gave Draco a friendly little pat on the back, brow creased in concern. "Alright there?"
No tea had been offered. Draco wished he had allowed his manners to overthrow his affronted dignity. His throat was drier than a desert. He swallowed down the very small amount of saliva his mouth was producing and darted his gaze to the door, hopeful that a hint was being telegraphed. Eyebrows were only so useful and the Granger-Weasley contingent well inured.
“Bah!” Humbug, even. Draco harrumphed, a small part of his head occupied with wondering whether Potter had hit the showers yet. Next week at this same time, they’d likely both be in the showers, he and Potter.  He could use the opportunity to covertly spy out Potter’s musculature. Potter was slighter than he, true enough, but thy both had fairly decent shoulders and narrow waists, long limbs and sleek builds.
Indeed, he hardly noticed the awkward pause going on in his own private little social huddle at all, now that Potter was zooming about in spasmodic up-and-down feints through the close-set hoops on the far end of the pitch, as if he were practicing some brilliant and modernistic form of aerial balletics. Draco hunched his shoulders forward, bringing his omniculars up to peer closely at the Golden One’s zippy acrobatics.
“Oi! What did’ja do that for, git?” howled Seamus, wrenching himself well away from the flailing Weasley. He’s noticed his besmirched sleeve in passing when Ron fell upon him, squashing him into the waffle platter. “Bastard!” On his other side, various Gryffindors were shoved abruptly together, jostling elbows and banging forks.
with him, Merlin!” Draco babbled to himself aloud as he twirled and flailed every which way, needing to hear the sound of his own voice at least, because very little made any sense and that did, oddly enough. “Parkinson Hall--bloody Parkinson Hall,
! You fucking slag, Malfoy!” Harry reared up on his elbows and glared at his tormentor for al he was worth. “I’ve never met anyone who can waste as much time as you do, git! I don’t want—nor need—another detention from Snape—I’ve enough already, thank you! I’m in detention till I graduate this place and I’m sure if he can manage it, I’ll be scrubbing fucking cauldrons till I’m thirty! And if
“Oi, Potter!" Draco glared daggers at his irksome, entirely barmy friend. "No, I am not 'alright'! Bloody fucking Merlin, of course I'm not 'alright'! I’m not just about to up and sell Malfoy simply because my home is infected with an uncontrollable mating impulse! Are you mad? You must be absolutely frothing, even suggesting that! And you? You! What about Grimmauld Place? Cousin Sirius would be spinning in his grave, if he had a proper one! He’d never, ever want you to sell off the home he left you! You should be ashamed of yourself, Potty.”
Indeed, but of course he wouldn't have thought of his current situation in those terms of Pottery inevitability. It was the very last thing that would ever cross his conscious mind, he and Potter. Together—an item? Absolutely not. Never in a million years could he have imagined the odd twists of fate and fortune combined that would lead to him—Draco Malfoy—being utterly enthralled with him—that ginormous git Potter!
, damn it! He'd a life to save. His own. "And I'm not moving one fucking inch, Harry. Right damned here, Harry, in your face, in your Merlin fucking home until you agree to actually talk to me—till you agree to come the fuck back with me to the flat—our flat! This isn't
"Yes?" Harry asked quickly, lunging upright. He couldn't do this, not curled in a cum-stained heap by his lover's side. Could not lie there, Draco's semen still in him, and await words that would shatter him like so much balsa wood—into splinters of Harry. Horcruxes of Harry, really. Murdered nameless, formless hopes. Foolish daydreams. Thus the prisoner awaited the executioner's axe, he believed. Impatient—eager. Needing closure. "Go on?"
"If you insist of course I shall," he replied. "Obviously the only remedy for Bulstrode's curse is for me to humour you whilst we wait for the curse to wear off on its own, your ArchMageness,” Draco flipped a mocking half-salute; Harry only smiled back at him like the utter loon he was. “Your every wish is my command. Who am I, but a mere plebe, a civilian, to argue with our ensorcelled Saviour?” He turned to the door. “Do excuse me. I must scour my wardrobe for garments suitable to accompanying the great Harry Potter into public view. I'm certain the Press will be present for such an amazing excursion.”
But it was grueling, facing down his house day after day, and feeling stymied perpetually. For there seemed to be nothing the done about it; his Manor had made up its incorporeal mind.
(Incidentally, Draco had even half-mockingly cheered Harry on when a routine visit to the Ministry during Third Year for a crash-course in the inner workings of Mysteries had led to a chance meeting--and some rather spiffing shagging--with Harry's old Gryffindor Team Captain, Oliver Wood. A memorable shag which had become a repeated fling which had then morphed into an actual affair. Millicent Bulstrode, who was then attending Flamel by Owl and interning at the Mysteries Head Office meanwhile, must have been the one who kept the pointy bastard up to date on the details of Harry's on-again, off-again thing with the delectable Ollie for he never failed to tease Harry about it mercilessly. The ridiculously irritating and damnably
!" Harry breathed, and it was a benefice, that word. As if 'you', uttered just like that, in precisely
"Is this all for Beltane, d'you think, Draco?" Harry, the speccy idiot, wasn't looking. "Wow! Headmistress has outdone herself!"
said," Draco dropped his head into his hands in patent despair. "To Harry. 'Dog in the manger', I said. About Blaise. I was…just kidding. Joking around. And then he left me."
make a house party of it, later on. Bring along your bashingly barmy House mates, p’raps even, for your celebration….Harry?”
"What about the wards? And do take yourself off, please. Right now, Malfoy." Harry, it seemed, was stuck on the same old song. Not even the lyrics had changed.
And Potter himself? Not half bad, now that Draco was noticing Potter. Er…noticing Potter more than previously, that is.
“Oooh,” Ron batted his red lashes at Harry, raising broad greasy palms to fend him off.”Touchy, touchy, mate! Feeling defensive?”
“Ahh,” he sighed eventually, wriggling his sock clad toes on the cleared table and patting his very happily fully belly. “It’s so strange. I’ve had the real thing, you know? The actual dish, I meant. When I was abroad. But somehow I still missed our version. Why is that, you think?”
"Well…" Harry mumbled into the stretching silence, ducking his chin to avoid looking too closely at what he knew had to be Draco's expression of complete disbelief—and discomfort. Draco wasn't one for entanglements; Harry was well aware. "Truth is, I didn't want you to—know, that is."
He'd go to the Headmaster himself, Draco vowed, pulling Potter closer, wrapping his arms around the quicksilver energy as if to contain it; lay his case before the old Wizard and promise to serve Potter's detention himself, even go so far as sign an agreement allowing them to be flanked about by all of Gryffindor House if need be
Harry leant forward and cast aside his book, consigning it to the long, low coffee table they’d finally both agreed was the most possibly perfect table for that purpose but a mere two weeks previous. Before that they employed Draco’s old school trunk, until Harry complained one too many times his feet always slid off and nothing stayed atop it without a sticking spell.
“Shut up!” Harry burst out, vaguely aggrieved but not dragging his eyes from Malfoy’s interesting hair as of yet. It would take more than Ron’s usual ribbing to distract; already he’d noticed some greenish shades near Malfoy’s part that he’d not seen yesterday evening at supper. “Not that big a deal, Ron. I was tired, alright? Just tired.”
Lucius, who seldom raised his voice above an urbane, mock-genial tone these days, had clearly lost any pretensions to proper Malfoy behaviour. Draco shrugged. He knew the feeling all too well; Harry sent him up with great regularity. Had never ceased eliciting that reaction from Draco, honestly, but at least now there was snogging and shagging to soothe his injured sensibilities.
Speaking of, damn Lucius to Hades for placing his own son and heir in this cruelly uncomfortable position! And damn that scurrilous git Potter, as well, for rendering Lucius's heir helpless, supplicant before his super-Saint Potter trainers, terminally goo-goo-eyed and lacking his usual Malfoy chill all 'round!
. Draco shook his head at Lucius' flushed cheeks and fearsomely heavy scowl. He wasn't fool enough to escort his beloved anywhere near his childhood home
Harry heard in his head. He jumped two feet straight up, startled. That was…Draco? He was hearing Draco, clear as a bloody bell?
preventing you from poking your head through his floo, is it?” Mills went to the door, pausing to shoot Harry a fond glance. “Though I imagine you’ve had your hands full enough, in your off hours.”
"Well, dear, you'll recall he didn't stay long the last time he stopped over? Most unfortunate, that." Narcissa bobbed her clefted chin in a regretful moue. "Had I known then he was to be my future son-in-law then, darling, you may be assured his welcome here at the Manor would've been very different, Draco—at least on my part. Can't speak for our poor dear departed Bella, naturally. But then Bella was never all that interested in family, either. Not your Father, either, except his own blood, nor even you, Draco…" Narcissa frowned at him for a fleeting moment.
He flung out an accusing forefinger, indicating the giant four-poster bed the Room had kindly provided, situated just out of the more intimate circle created by the two sofas, the oval hearth rug and the low table set cozily between them. "Over yonder? Cause they'll not be able to see much of anything good, dumb arse, not if we're over there. Now, me, I admit I prefer a good, springy mattress—better all 'round, really, coming or going—but it's your call, Potter, so get it in gear, yeah?"
"Ah! Fucking hell! Slow down, Ha-Harry! I'll come if you do that!" Draco cautioned, blinking rapidly. He buried his fingers in Harry's hair for want of better place to put them. On the one hand, his lips wanted more of that mouth in his own; on the other, he'd hex to death anyone who dared part that tongue from his prick—it was
Draco chortled, a little louder now that he, at least, was positive they were alone. He leered a bit, leaning toward Harry and winking familiarly.
Courtship for a Pureblood was a serious matter, after all; Draco was as aware of that as he was of his own very lengthy pedigree. Even when it was for love—
After graduation. After he'd had a chance to show the world he was a proper candidate for Potter's paw.
“Ouch!” Draco yelped, retreating in his turn as much as he possibly could from the mad person. Not as far as he'd have liked; Harry’s ankles had his one foot in a stranglehold. The bed was also only so wide and the duvet had managed to tangle. "Shite!" He tossed his unwanted handkerchief away and glared daggers instead, increasingly irate. Harry had always had nightmares before but this was beyond ridiculous. “Bloody Merlin, Potter, will you please not? That was uncalled for, striking me!”
It was only…it was only that Harry had this peculiar habit of going a bit overboard for his friends, and Draco wanted him to be comfortable. To be at ease, and not feel he had to change that (nor anything else, either; Harry, for all that he drove Draco to the brink, was absolutely perfect, as is), just because it was Malfoy now in place of Weasley—either Weasley.
“I don’t think it’s merely that, Draco.” Pansy stopped her eternal knotting, and stared off into the middle distance, frowning. “I don't believe so at all. Neither do any of us, any of your friends, love. We're none of us blind nor lackwit, you know; it's crystal he's arse over tits for you. And I do know that he’s made a choice already and now you have to decide for yourself.”
Harry, as Draco recalled with the wee part of his brain not actively melting, had mentioned his best mate had a terribly difficult time with arachnoids.
Harry laughed at him, the skin 'round his green eyes crinkling, and used that wicked, sly hand to fondle Draco's bits. Shed his spectacles, too, carelessly discarding them over the arm of the sofa.
A flash of light, brilliant as Malfoy's hair and as blindingly pure as the molten grip of his wide-open gaze.
She only giggled, faintly belling sounds in the growing distance. Harry turned appalled, unbelieving eyes upon the countenance he knew so very well, it was bloody ridiculous. The familiar features were smirking at him, familiarly. Sexily—come-hither—no! Wait. Not
Still chewing methodically, Ron switched his searching gaze to his girlfriend’s mildly puzzled face.
"Fuck you, then. Arsehole." Harry's eyes went a poisonous hue. And when his hands settled on Draco's upper arms it wasn't to grip them with love and adoration, it wasn't to squeeze them fondly as he'd used to do, days and days ago—an eternity. He shoved harshly at Draco, who dug in his heels and didn't shift.
“No!” Draco slid his arm about Harry’s shoulders and pulled him close, leaning in to mutter confidentially into Harry’s ear. “No. She cannot, and here I was, hearing myself singing lullabies and chanting nonsense rhymes! And the smell I smelt? I swear it was intoxicating--like Amortentia, but all about bloody babies! Talcum and daisies, damn it! Fresh linens, line dried! So, it struck me.”
"Huh?" Harry said, shaking his head to clear it. He placed a cool hand on his forehead, where it throbbed, and considered spelling his headache away. But better not; the pain might serve to keep him still and quiet and out from under Malfoy's expensively shod feet, which would be best, rally. He'd have plenty of opportunities to make a fool over himself over bloody Malfoy on the morrow. Besides, Hermione's references were always the most expansive and weighty—they'd make for fine full-body shields if ever she needed to use them as such. "What? Malfoy?" he added, feeling slightly addled. He was entertaining odd thoughts—he should chill. "Could you two maybe stop that, please? It's annoying, alright?"
come 'round—if only there's proof. Positive proof. So, er...come on, please? Cooperate this one time?"
“Go, you prat!” Draco yelled, oblivious to their carping. “Put a move on it! Don’t lose it now, Potter!”
"I-I, er, won't, Draco," Harry replied hastily, blinking rapidly and with some bewilderment. He peered at Draco as if Draco were some stray nutter, come to call: gingerly and with caution. "I mean of course I wouldn't forget, you git! You've made it very clear—um, singularly clear, really, that I'm not to. But, er, Draco? What exactly is it I'm not s'posed to be forgetting? Because you haven't said—that. Yet, really. Exactly. Um…could you, maybe, perhaps…clarify?"
Which fancy gave Harry great ideas, naturally, and he resolved he would, as soon as he was able. Draco's cock was rather choice.
"Yes, love—yes, there!" And his Harry cheerily obliged him, never looking away from the sultry picture the firelight painted of one Draco Malfoy, starched white shirttails flapping about his thighs, blushing arse-cheeks spread wide, hole pierced and indubitably owned by his favourite—
"That thing—that position we were talking over the other day, the one that would need a decent levitation spell? And loads of room to maneuver? We go up—right? Up and then turn, like key into lock? Slot together. The Hippogriff."
Draco hurried after him—was towed after him, actually, like a barge to a tugboat—and tried not to wonder too hard as he raced along the narrow, windy way about Potter wanting suddenly to visit a jewelers' shop. It was far too odd of him, the barmy git; completely not what Draco was expecting, and Draco couldn't help but be curious, really—but it was likely only that Potter wanted to purchased a gift for Granger, perhaps as a reward for being civil.
Really, that was all that mattered, when it came down to it, Draco concluded. Harry wouldn't have a clue what he'd started by going against Draco's express wishes—the sodding prat—till it hit him. Like a wall of solid cake, laced with the finest French brandy. In something like sixty-four separate tiers.
"Please—yes—Malf—Drac—" he panted, rocking under the force of rapid thrust and withdrawal, "I'm—yours—Dra—cooo!"
They hadn't been shed of the pair of them for the remainder of the day, and it was only Potter's direct command that sent a red-facing and puffing Weasel and his slap-happy girlfriend on their way. Then they'd raced again, hell bent for leather, and fetched up at the last place Draco could imagine shagging.
His Mum really was terribly well suited to be the consort of one Lucius Malfoy: she was more than capable of keeping his bastard papa in check. Though perhaps by the time Draco's errant Father was released from Azkaban there'd be grandchildren in the mix. He rather hoped so; twenty years was a long time and he wanted a family to fill up the empty echoing halls of his inherited manse.
He incanted the lovely spell that simultaneously stretched and lubed; Draco shivered in reaction to it, his stomach rubbing queasily across the faded plush of the divan.
that washed-out colour, do you? ‘Lake water’? Hmmm, mate. Dunno’, mate. If it strikes your fancy, well…well, you know, that’s bloody inspirational, your poetics. Leastways, I find it so. Malfoy’s not the only poet, then.”
"You've noticed them, Malfoy? Harry's little mishaps?" Hermione stopped in her absorbing task of excavation long enough to ask of Malfoy, eyes on him like ravens on a fresh carcass. "Hmmm. That's…interesting."
at me, Harry. Can't you see what this has done to me, you walking out that door? How you could? And enough's enough, now. I didn't mean it; you know I didn't mean it. It was likely just me, being the way I usually am—you understand, right? And Zabini's always that way, always fucking about and you know how he is, right? He can't help it; his mum's a bloody murderess, Harry. That's what she does, murder relationships. And he's got no bloody people skills, no point of reference, thanks to his stupid old cunt of a mum. I mean, he's charming and all that but there's a wall, Harry, between him and everyone and it's only a very few of us he'll even bother wi--I mean. Blaize is, well. He just tried it on you, hoping for a rise—it was a
"Wedding to be in June, right after we graduate," Harry moaned his miserable way through the dreary litany of Malfoy's soon-to-be life choices, impervious to reason. "Honeymoon in the Lesser Antilles. So it's hopeless, really," he sighed and rolled over again to hide his crumpled-up, horribly unhappy face…though he did frankly acknowledge he was fully squashed flat, feelings-wise, and likely to remain that way for some considerable time. What was the point of hiding it? "Hopeless, Hermione."
"Don't be a wet blanket, Harry," Malfoy snapped. "I didn't say we have to do it all at once, did I? I mean, we can start off right now, but that doesn't mean everyone's forced to pair up and get jiggy by tomorrow, either."
what Harry should've expected all along, this Malfoy disease he was afflicted with so rudely. Served him right, didn't it? A sort of comeuppance?
Draco meanwhile had shoved, nudged and yanked Harry about six ways from Sunday, even going so far as to climb atop him.
“Idiot. Stop pretending, Malfoy. I can see you, you know.”  Harry’s skin goose-pimpled; all the damned duvet, this morning—every inch of it the bastard had taken!  He shivered; prodded harder, indenting the shoulder, the hollow beneath that intriguing blade of bone where a wing might be if Draco had them. “You’re not fooling anyone.”
Draco could be nasty about it—he'd wanted Harry to himself for the space a weekend, sod it; was that too much to ask, really?—or he could be polite. He could, if the fancy struck him, be…considerate.
Those Kneazle kittens, for example, and their adorable antics as they gamboled about on the wallpaper, playing with their painted Charmed yarn balls.
"It's…" Harry blinked, feeling stupid. But what he'd seen—and there was no earthly reason for Draco to pull pranks on him. "It's the same, isn't it? Yours…and mine?"
Truth was, he’d spent a rather difficult morning coaxing the Abraxan foals through some much-needed halter training, following by an even more strenuous afternoon in the Home Farm Apiary, coaxing the famous Malfoy Bees to shift hives whilst not stinging him silly. He’d spent a large part of the wee hours the night previous tracking a lovely newly discovered nebulae and recording it on both his Magical and Muggle cameras for the greater good and further research purposes of both the Wizarding and Muggle scientific communities. Naturally, he’d rejoiced he’d so much data to submit to the journals he regularly wrote for but the the compilation promised to be mind-numbing. Truth was, he was bloody knackered, and his stupid house was not helping.
Just bits and pieces. Leftovers. Harry had them, at least. Spare parts of Draco that no one else was remotely interested in—that he found to be utterly brilliant. Morning breath, for instance. Eyelids.
Those wee ducklings, all golden and fuzzy, paddling about their wee painted pond and quacking happily. Egads.
For once, this suggestion was not greeted by universal groans and piteous howls of 'No more bleeding Snap!' and 'Merlin, not Truth or Dare' again!' No one even dared mumble a naysay against 'Spin the Bottle', Parkinson's favourite, or Wizarding Chess, Weasley's.
Draco's internal organs twisted painfully—he gasped soundlessly, awash with pain. His ears buzzed. He'd made a grievous error, apparently, literally flinging himself at Harry's feet, pouring out his heart, offering up his trinket—he'd assumed far too much on the basis of far too little and now he'd made an absolute fool of himself.
Draco didn't care, not in the slightest, not really. The Brown bint could take her own bloody useless life for all he cared—she could fall off the face of the earth and he'd be joyous, actually. Dancing in the streets, ecstatically pleased. But
Well—Potter was firmly herded to his by his glaring lieutenants, but then that was obviously the jealous ginger git's doing. Draco sauntered, as he was wont to do after a particularly satisfying sexual experience, and crowed inwardly over the horrified looks on the Mudblood's and the Weasel's faces when they finally caught sight of the matching rings. He'd quite forgotten to spell them in the haste of their pell-mell return to the Castle. Draco shrugged the oversight away—they'd have to know sometime and it may as well be official, as it
.  Grimmauld’s not exactly spit-spot, top of the nines, is it? All that red velvet swagging, Potty. Still. Go ahead and open the damn door, will you? The bloody suspense is killing me here.”
“Flatterer,” Harry grinned in return, his throat easing as the weight of all those unwanted forced truths began to finally recede. He reset his feet, cocking a hip out, and leaned a little nearer his partner. “Laying it on thick, are you? Thirty seconds.”
"No!" Harry seemed completely freaked out that he even asked that, and Draco's pulse settled down a bit in relief. "Gods,
Hermione, at the end, having crawled out to aid Ginny by manning the muffin basket, was practically forced to pour the largest full pitcher of iced pumpkin juice available over both of their heads to bring them to their senses. Or so she stated firmly, later, all giggles gone and firmly put aside…and then they were all three of them late to their various first lectures, as they had to adjourn to change robes and spell their book bags dry and free of breakfast.
"I…hope you like it," he managed, poking the spellotape on his. "I mean, it took me a while, looking…"
," Draco grinned. "I meant your bloody bent for fucking success in all things--and your bloody humility over it!” He raised his glass in a wordless toast. “To you, Potty. Not that I’m complaining, particularly," he went on, his tone fond. “It’s rather a pleasure having mates in high places. Or posh basements, rather. Now, you said this morning you’ve been promoted yet again? Thrice? Can you at least tell me what I am to address you as, oh Great Panjandrum? And are you really, truly back in Town for good? Because--correct me if I am recalling incorrectly, do, Harry--that wasn't how it worked out the last time you told me that exact same thing--not at all! I still hold a grudge against you for that and don't you dare forget it.”
Arithmancy. Three plus two should equal a decent gift, right? Like jewelry. He'd taken the chance; had searched out and bought this thin platinum wristlet. Had had the shopkeeper add a tiny but very powerful charm to it and paid through the nose for the pleasure: a fine golden snitch, minute wings spread like an angel's, spelled to hum and buzz in Harry's ear if ever Draco should be in danger. It was, Harry decided, the least he could do. To keep his love safe, or at least have his back.
a tub and a loofah and at the very least a sodding folding screen 'twixt them and me, d'you hear? Just shut them out, Room—I beg you!
"Fine, fine—whatever, Ron," Harry waved him off. "Later." He shifted a bit, side to side in his trainers, and focused his gaze carefully off into the distance. "Look, er. Why don't you and Hermione go on ahead and we'll catch up at Madame Rosmerta's or something? Have a little breather, yeah?" He sent a hopeful grimace towards Granger, who was obviously the most sensible of the three of them, to Draco's mind, and she returned it with a small off-center smile of her own.
"Heh," Draco chuckled. "I'm only being repetitive so I'll be sure you'll understand; you know how woozy you are when you are when you're fagged."
“Yes, alright,” Draco grudgingly allowed, shutting his eyes in silent supplication to any listening anti-fertility deity and hauling in a hard breath. One way or another, Harry was his last real hope of regaining a normal life. He gritted his teeth, hissing, “Go ahead, then. That’s why we’re here, isn’t it? Get on with your customary heroics, please and thank you.”
“Not really. Just that struck me, really. Odd, yeah? Dunno’ why now, but it did, so…so, erm, leave off, alright? Asking me about it? I’m allowed to notice things, Hermione. Rather should be, for Aurors. Don’t you think?”
"Mmmm…come a little closer, why don't you?" he purred, liking all of it. Draco scowled at his cheek and took a second away from stripping Harry to poke him sharply in the chest.
Potter—hurtful bastard that he was, Potter actually grinned boyishly as he pulled back, his lips finally departing Draco's cheek, and he was still doing it when he opened his mouth to destroy Draco's carefully cultivated mask of indifference, summoned from nowhere only by Draco's own enormous willpower.
“Arrghh! Merlin!” Harry moaned, horrified. He felt ill, really, and clutched his middle to show it. “
Oh, yes—Harry had to return to that horrid slag's flat tomorrow; so he'd said, vaguely—something about elbowy-shaped drainage bits needed.
“Well, when I first returned and was given the Department to run, I was rarely at Grimmauld,  right?”
Draco didn't so much as take a breath, didn't exhale. He stayed right where he was, immobilized in Harry's bloody brand new armchair and watched Harry watching his every move intently, with lips just as tight and mostly bloodless, and
"Mmmm, no," Harry pressed his swollen lips against the side of throat that warmed his cheekbone, his scarred forehead; nibbled gently at the fragrant skin while he was at it. Draco's naked body shuddered beneath him. "M'here, aren't I? Can look after you now. Will."
when it was for Love—and not Galleons, Courtship Mattered. The style, the timing, the presents—the whole business was earth-shatteringly crucial to a couple's chances in the real world, after Bonding.
"Oh-my-Merlin-there—right there….yesss," he moaned, flopping about on the ridge of the sofa back. The tufted buttons dug into his abdomen; Harry's prick reamed him harder than hard. Draco loved it; adored it—could never
"No worries," Harry grinned widely at her, profoundly relieved he'd not have to perform a Wronski as well as the damned Hygieian. He saw Luna nod acknowledgement out of the corner of his eye. "Happens all the time, Ichika-san; we're accustomed. Carry on, then."
"No," Harry had replied decisively, his whisper marginally louder than Draco's and overriding it. "It's better to have something fresh, Draco. Something that's ours."
"Ron!" Granger spoke up again, her tone a whip-crack, and with its sound Weasley reluctantly subsided, grumbling under his breath. "It's alright. Look, Harry's just promised we'll talk it over later, if we feel we must. Let it go for now—he's right. Now's the time for Hogsmeade. We don't often have the chance for a little fun. I could use a spot, honestly."
“You’re a bloody idiot. Just consider," he remarked. "That only means you’ll have wrinkles and grey hair well before I do, slug brain! In fact, you might end up bald as a coot! It's already looking a bin thin up top, right at the temples. Have you noticed?”
That was--Draco blinked reflectively over the thought--if Harry could be convinced to ease up now that he was the actual Head of Department of Mysteries. Firming his chin, Draco resolved that this would indeed be the case. His mate had had nearly two years solely devoted to his career, gallivanting off with next to no notice and disappearing without a trace, and it had definitely paid off for him, position-wise, but now it was past time for him to relax, perhaps even lounge about on his laurels.
Draco could afford it, being a Malfoy. Though those rings were rather stunning in their own right and suitably costly.
Draco smiled his immense satisfaction as he watched his lover stumble over his own feet. He'd have fist-pumped but Malfoys didn't do that. But his Harry was stunned. Not quite silent, but close enough for him to get on with. It was working, the Courtship Proper—and his revenge, which was sweet, sweet, sweet!
“Ten minutes ago, maybe,” Draco advised him calmly, breathing out silently. He clicked off the telly and cast down the controller.  “And? What of it?”
Malfoy, in clear rejection of the sombre tones of his recent past, was only ever seen clad in white, and sometimes the cream, silver or very pale grey shades, but always hues of palest transparency or slight opacity that obliquely advertized his change-of-heart—and loyalties. He glided about the school like a Fallen Angel and caused all the lesser Years daily swooning sessions over his good looks, excellent manners and incredible charm. Some claimed he was Veela, his appeal was so pervasive. He might be Fallen, and perhaps even Resurrected, but in no way was he scorned.
“I do,” Harry said firmly, releasing Draco’s arm finally. “Right. Do come along. Let’s have our dinner and then I’ll show you my problem. But first you can tell me how you’ve been going along while I’ve been away. I’m starved for news, I swear. I hated not being able to Owl or floo you, but it can't be helped.” He shrugged, grimacing, and led off the way to the dining room. “It’s my least favourite part of the position, actually,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder and biting his lower lip in an engaging manner. “Not being in contact with any of my friends and family for so long. I abhorred that part, honestly."
"Better to be cruel to be kind in the end than allow him drag on like this, Potter," Draco whispered. "Always hoping. That hurts." His lips were light against the ridge of Harry's scar. "Look to your littlest Weasleyette; don't you dare tell me with a straight face that she didn't suffer whilst you were off fucking about. Not to mention what I went through—"
“I’m going to hex you both to little tiny pieces, you babbling baboons,” Draco threatened seriously. “You don’t know a good thing when you see it, do you? May I remind you Potter saved your fucking bums not long ago? Can you not show a little appreciation?”
"Well, I found one, just now," he jerked his fair head. "A spell that'll help us do it. Back there in the stacks. Up for it, Harry?"
“You’re not helping in the least! Control him, why don’t you?” Harry grumbled. Ron hadn’t given up on his neophyte stage career yet, the prick.
, Draco knew. Even if Harry didn't, because he was him. "No! Listen, I have it! Legilmens, Harry. Use it. On me, in my head. Just go on in, poke about and see, for once in your life—please just see. See how I am for you. See me, Harry-
Draco hadn’t been actually fibbing when he’d informed his Manor he had no prospects, romantically. Draco wasn't much for the social circle even at the best of times and, besides, all his friends--and all Potter’s--were off living their own lives, two plus years on from uni. Three, really, for them. And Potter, damn his eyes, was presumably still simply off Elsewhere Undisclosed, doing Unspeakable things entirely Unspeakably. It made it rather difficult, keeping close.
Harry rolled sideways; settling his sticky legs more firmly between Malfoy’s dangling ones. Fortunately, it was one of the magically extendable work surfaces and fortunately, Malfoy knew the right incantation to scrub all the cauldrons clean whilst they recovered. He’d his uses, for a walking, talking prat-of-ages, Malfoy did. Harry wouldn’t be without him, now.
He peered about, setting his two bottles down on a side table so as to free up his hands. Slowly he spun on a neat heel, searching for signs of life. Or, at very least, recent occupancy. But, no. The familiar withdrawing room was welcoming, as always, but depressingly empty of his quarry. A silver salver with an uncorked bottle of wine--a much nicer vintage than what he’d brought with--and two gleaming glasses stood at the ready on the credenza. A tiered tray of Kreacher’s infamous nibbles-and-bits was placed next to it. The hearth logs flared back up into a cozy, crackling fire behind him.  Yet his erstwhile host was absent.
in the Smaller Spare Yellow Parlor. Never generally used by the family, that room, as evidenced by its appellation.
had bloody well burst into a fit of messy tears, sobbing wildly and dripping snot all over Draco's imported cheese tray!
they'd been considering would have them both a good yard above the tabletop or more, likely thrashing about in plain view, and it would enable them each to penetrate the other, simultaneously. It was complicated; it was deviant—it was a bloody tremendously exciting prospect, even for the magically athletic.
"Mmm-hmmm. Draco…" Draco smelt so very good; salty now, yes, but sweet and mouthwatering. Harry—had he the energy—could've happily eaten right up.
“It-was-just-a-tiny-little-Veritus-Charm-that’s-all,” Harry mumbled hurriedly, dropping his chin down nearly to his chest and glaring hotly at his own poor quill, laying innocent and pristine on the blotter, all fletching intact as he hadn’t yet had the opportunity to use it, what with all the heavy-handed interrogation tactics Draco was dishing out. “S'nothing, really, alright? Barely even felt the sting. Got me in the back of the knee just as I was disarming him, the little tosser, and mostly by sheer dumb luck. Don’t make so much of it, will you please, Malfoy? It’s bad enough already, having a child hex me.”
He pressed the back of a hand to his forehead, which ached suddenly, awfully. His stomach hurt like the dickens. His ears buzzed and he only wished for it to be over with—Draco's inevitable, expected rejection. His own glaring asininity.
It was hateful, the way his face felt these days, since Harry had left him. He looked years older than the twenty-two birth days he'd celebrated so far. His mirror had advised him he looked downright peaky earlier, cooing with real concern over his dispirited state. Bloody mirror. Decades older, it reported. Likely the exact opposite of the self-confident, boldly successful young Wizard his unexpected but maybe useful guests had seen last (on the evening of the happy occasion of Harry's birthday party, Day 241.) Back then he'd been his usual self: charming, debonair, coolly composed and sharp of tongue, but with a silly party hat stuck on. There'd been champagne and cake in abundance and his own close mates visiting as well as Harry's, all gathering for a do. Like old home week at Hogwarts, but better, lots better. Because back then Harry had still lived in this drab flat, breathing life into it, into
Then he couldn’t see anything at all as Ron tackled him in return and they fell straight into the steak-and-kidney pie. It was a grand mess and almost beautiful, that. Poetry in motion.
“Al…right, Draco,” Pansy responded, after an extremely drawn-out and pregnant-with-a-full-litter-of Crup-puppies moment, during which Draco never took his attention from Potter’s fluid chase after the pesky, irresponsible Snitch. The Ravenclaw Seeker—silly git— wasn’t even in sight at the moment, having been left well behind when ‘the’ git flew upwards in that tight spiral—Potter, Draco would bet a thousand Galleons, would lay hands on the piss-ant uppity Snitch in a matter of seconds. It was a moment of finesse; he could almost taste it. “I suppose you wish to stay, then, for whole damned duration. What
"Okay," Harry pulled the small gaily festooned box toward himself across the table, deftly avoiding the sticky spots and the places where the cream from Draco's whip had dripped. "If…if you open mine."
“Oh, er…nothing, darling.”  Pansy smiled sweetly. “All is just fabulous; not a thing to worry your lovely hair over, dear.”
Harry yawned again, stripping off his clothes and stuffing away his small finds in his travelling kit. He’d save his second chrysocolla stone, keep it in his Mokeskin for later. Two years gone away was a long time, yes, but it wasn’t forever.
“It is,” Harry agreed softly, gazing again at the claviform. “It definitely is. We should go, though,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder at the little knot of Muggles behind them. “No point in wearing out our welcome, is there? And it was only this one, fortunately.”
"Wait—what?" Harry gasped, scrambling up on his knees in a flurry. He stuck a hand out and grabbed at Malfoy's open robes, unthinking. Hermione stopped her search abruptly and went into a great peal of loud girly laughter, gasping and giggling and generally making a fuss. "Odd?" he howled. "Since when am
"What—what!" Harry gabbled, pink and flushed and gone dizzy. "You—aren't you—gah!—engaged or something? What're you d-doing?"
“...No,” he returned at long last, lowering his chin and staring miserably down at his stupid quill again for fear of meeting his partner’s eyes. “I don’t, really.”
manner, contained all the fondness and lust Harry held for him. "Oh, you!" he repeated—and flung himself willy-nilly against Draco's thumping chest, bowling them both over in a rush.
how I'd put it." He lunged, for evidently events weren't moving along quickly enough for him. "Hah! Gotcha, Harry! Now it gets
"That's not all I am!" Draco growled, grinding his cheekbone against Harry's fiercely. "That weas never all I was and you know it!" Stubble grabbed and burnt pink trails across features unbearably strained. They were rubbing one another raw, not that they hadn't been, already. Draco hated it—hated that he'd denied it, all these days. Hated that Harry seemed so stuck on it, and had never, not once, forgotten, as he had. "Look at what I
“Watch it, Ron!” he growled, his voice deeper now that he was taller and broader. He cast a jaundiced eye upon Harry. “And
"Thank you." Draco cleared his throat and tapped an impatient toe, waiting. "Ahem… and this 'catch' you mention?" he prompted. "The spell, Mum? What is it, exactly?"
, when his poor body went into instant shock at the sheer aroma of Malfoy and then, too, at the sight of that sleek hair—and those steely amused eyes—and of course that tall, elegant frame silhouetted against the various scenic vistas of Hogwarts? It was passing strange, Harry had concluded, that when he'd finally and truly fallen for someone seriously, he'd fallen for that git. Smashingly hard, natch. Par for the course; it absolutely had to be Malfoy—Malfoy!
"With the right style…" Brown had crowded Longbottom up against the teddy bear and was sifting her fingers through his hair, her expression one of bemusement. "Maybe…"
He turned back to his best mate, frowning in a very dampening manner. Ron was eyeing him speculatively, chewing. He opened his mouth but Harry forestalled him hastily.
He’d used to think the whole ‘throwing oneself’ at a person was bunk, an expression of speech. Turned out it wasn’t; who knew? The Quidditch shed wall was convenient; the trampled lawn was even more so—and mutual frotting went a long way toward releasing pent-up frustration.
Both cocks were perking up and taking notice, as per the resilient nature of the young and hale. A wave of returning desire swept through Harry; he luxuriated in it, hearing the answering echo in his mate's mind.
"Not distracting, precisely," he grinned. "Just, erm, resetting your channel, a bit, tosser. You seem…tense. Too tense. For a Friday night. I want you not to be, yeah?"
He gave into the urge to ask, more loudly; if he did, Draco might hear and might answer to the positive side and then they’d kiss to celebrate it, long and lazily whilst Draco woke slowly and in baby-step stages, and Harry would taste him on his tongue for the remainder of the day.
"Pfft," Malfoy tsked and proceeded to calmly turn his gaze to view the Lake, his expression serene. "Obviously, Granger."
He didn't want to be here, in this stupid little dusty shop, with all these lovely pieces spread before him, each as tempting as the distilled attar of the Devil's Snare, when he'd family jewels enough of his own at home in the Manor's cellar vault and he'd been thinking recently—just a passing thought, of course—of how Potter might like to receive some sort of keepsake.
Probably never had anything of the sort, Draco decided loftily, being terribly poor and brought up by those godsawful Muggles. Probably didn't own a single valuable thing to call his own—well, except that Cloak of his, and his broom. Draco had wondered now and then—hadn't dwelled on it—but he'd wondered if Potter might not appreciate some sort of gift. A remembrance. Certainly, Draco was wealthy enough to see his way clear to purchasing a little something to signify their budding friendship, even if Potter wasn't. Likely he'd never even think of such a thing, being Muggle-raised, so Draco would need first to educate him concerning the finer points of gifting amongst Wizards. It was quite an involved and symbolic process, Draco recalled, his mind wandering for a moment, until he recalled that this was not at all what he'd intended.
“First comes love and then comes maaaaarriage!” Ron bellowed unmusically and the remainder of Gryffindor table pinned their wide eyes upon his mischievous face as he grimaced, rising slowly to his feet and laying a fluttering hand theatrically over his heart.  “Then comes baaaaabeeeee—“
Two years of zero contact was a rather long time, really. All things considered. It felt a bit awkward. Just popping his head through the hearth as if it were nothing.
"Well, then—you have to let me, Harry," Draco had told him. "I want to do it. I wanted to give you one of my own; that's much better—"
“Hmmm. You will, Malfoy? You’d do that for me?” Harry opened his eyes very wide indeed at the beaky nose level with his own. He earned a feline smirk and glancing kiss for it.
"Pfft!" Hermione snorted, daintily, and remained behind the fastnesses of her book. "No, it's not," her white teeth clacked with a snap behind the ruffle of pages. "But...same end result, Harry. Nothing—a big fat heap of nothing. Now do be silent, please. If you're not planning on doing anything useful and to the point to solve your problems, as it seems you are totally set on, you can at least be quiet about it. I need this information for Creatures. You
"Fine," Harry shrugged it off stoically. "You do that, love. We'll schedule the formal execution first thing after our honeymoon. I've booked a Portkey to Romania so we can visit the dragons at Charlie's Reserve—you love them, right? Dragons? And Charlie says the local hotel's very posh there—the accommodations include a suite and a complimentary breakfast."
, allowing it to happen at all. To progress even this far, unchecked, and Draco sadly admitted he had, more fool him! But what could he say? Really? It was Harry, and Harry considered Brown (
"What?" Draco asked again, his mind skipping from here to there and everywhere, and none of the stops made sense. "Why?" he demanded, his stomach twisting suddenly, sending the chocolate from the Frogs they'd eaten into unpleasant roils.
"...oh gods, yessss..." Harry hissed contrapuntally and the Weasel did indeed shut his trap right smart.
Which was exactly why Draco was interviewing him for the prospect of producing a Betrothal Cake large enough to comfortably feed a cool one thousand guests, staff, students and stray VIPs, such as Kingsley Shacklebolt and Victor Krum.
"Now? Gods yes—now! Now, Draco!" Harry commanded, spitting out a few stray wafts of down. "Don't wait, git. Do it now!"
“Alright?” Draco scoffed, allowing himself to be seated. “It’s a bit more than alright. Picasso, mate. My Mum would die for one of those, really. Brilliant old Safavid you have laying about on the bloody floor, too. But," he sniffed, pulling a long face. "I suppose that’s the thing I really dislike most about you.”
“Fine. Fuck you, too,” he sniped. “I’ll find you out later, whatever it is you’ve got on—don’t think I won’t!”
Oops! I should probably mention this is a sort of standalone sequel to another gift fic for this same do_me_veela* Fest, which you may read first, should you wish: Fear of Flying.
—well, I'm sure you know where I'm going with that, right? So…I say we should invent one. A game, that is."
"Oh, no," he muttered, his features sharp and predatory. "Not now, Potter. Not when I've finally got you all to myself. No bolting."
Harry did, with much fumbling and Draco helping him by getting in the way with fingers, pointy nose and curious lips as he struggled to release the staying charm that had held the fiercely bobbing little snitch at bay in its box.
“I’m bloody done! Up to my fucking eyeteeth! I’m calling in the Unspeakables! They’ll sort you out, see if they don’t! Well,
"Look, Draco," Harry once again felt the need to intervene. Poor Nev was shooting him these looks of desperation and the mood of the Common Room was still quite uncertain. "Why don't we just play Spin the Bottle and import a few Youngers for Nev to look over? Same thing, really."
the far more sophisticated Sixth Form, who sneered—at least in Slytherin—over such childish pleasures.) But it might not be possible or even advisable, given Potter's circumstances, though surely, if they were in company—Mudblood and Weaselbee would there, he was certain, and likely to ruin it just with their presence—surely it wasn't too much to ask?
"Why?" The query gave nothing away as to the emotional state of the querent. Harry's only clue concerning Draco's disposition was the sudden sweaty slickness of his smooth skin. It had gone cold and then hot in a matter of seconds, lax and pliant where it lay, but damp and slippery as Harry's own clammy knuckles and palm. Harry held on grimly, nonetheless. "Why not?" Draco pressed, intent.
, you know, not in so many words. You must, you know. You aren't allowed to leave me in suspense like this. You know my love-hate relationship with mysteries, mate. Oh! Perhaps we do need the tea, after all! Um, cuppa? Biscuits? They’re your favourite. Had them laid in as soon as I took over. Choco mallow. Tunnock's, even.”
"Shall we do it, then? Or at least get started?" Malfoy glanced about him, seeking support. "I, for one, feel our boy Longbottom here needs someone that's not plush and squeaky for the long term. What say you?"
“You’d have to kill me; yes, I know, Harry,” Draco replied, flipping a casual two fingers. “Right, no, as to that. I don't know why the Ministry is so difficult, really. I’m only just joyous that I’ve never felt the need to work there. But returning to the important things now. Which do you want, then, the Thai or what Kreacher sent? I’ll bring that in if you’d rather; I’m off to the kitchen for a beer anyway.”
‘Just Harry’ rolled his eyes in a very Pottery way and Draco fully relented, giving up on the notion of it not actually being Harry before him. But only slightly. If it really was Harry, then he was still banshee-shit
They browsed through the bookstore, Draco retrieving and paying for his package, and then went off to Zonko's, where Potter did the same, looking quite pleased with himself. With the parcels shrunken and time on their hands, they wandered about Honeyduke's for a good half-hour, purchasing a great deal of chocolate in various forms and, for Draco, several bags of the hard boiled green-apple sweets he liked to suck on when he was writing essays.
"O...kay? It's alright to use it, then?" Draco swallowed, reluctantly accepting the little box. "You're very sure of that, Mother? One hundred percent certain it's safe?"
"You, you're not the usual Harry James Potter with whom I am familiar, not at all, even though you appear to be. No, you've obviously been tampered with in some fashion; a Spell Damage victim. Millicent has doubtless placed some sort of vengeful curse upon you as a result of you saying you were faffing off entirely, and now you’ve being impelled to act just as a normal person does on a normal weekend. Wanting a meal out in public and shopping, all that. How diabolical of her. A fate worse than death for an important Ministry official such as yourself. You should likely go have yourself nice lie-down instead. Just till it wears off, of course. And I'll stand guard, of course."
, Ron,” Harry went on, enunciating. “I hate you now. Right now, this minute, I hate your bloody guts! Now, stop! Shut it, if you know what’s good for you!”
The room did a languidly rollicking spin about him and his gut roiled unpleasantly in reaction. He blinked hard several times at Draco, bringing his disapproving expression fully back into focus.
"No, you're correct—of course I wouldn't want that, Mum." Either wrinkles or the wind changing; the wind had been rather uncommonly friendly with Draco lately.
Harry nodded, his smile a little more pronounced and somehow genuinely easier, as if he meant it this time. Truly chuffed.
Draco also winced, recalling his own troublesome Nursery with its newly enhanced Potter-appeal. Spiderwebs? Really? And that was attractive?
"Harry, don't say for me to go." Draco took contrary heart at the lack of movement. He wouldn't think of what else it might mean, no. He ventured forward, by tiny degrees. "Don't say you hate me, okay?"
Draco Malfoy was threatened! He was actively being menaced by a twit with demonstrably more Spell-dyed blonde hair than brain matter—and boobs like bloody cocoanuts!
“Oh, no,” Luna shook her head, apparently giving up on the concept of eating any of the delicious food in front of her. She gently shoved her plate offsides, then idly resettled her unused cutlery into its proper setting. “No. Not a bit of it. Good idea, Harry. We should Owl ahead, though. Or floo. Meneer De Oude will be expecting us.”
"Which she never did, because Pans doesn't, so then I had to use it—wear it around, like some ponced up prat, just to—"
"I'm sorry," he murmured to the moonless night and the empty breeze, and then a warm wind rose up beneath his flying feet, his woefully slow wings, and bore him off, thankfully. For of all things Draco required right then it was a safe place to tend his wounds. "I—I'm so sorry. Harry. I'm sorry."
The only piece Draco lacked was the rings...but then he was wearing proudly the one Harry had given him, at that higgledy-piggledy
"Bloody useless Owls we have," Draco growled and grumbled as he shrugged his shoulders, but he was proud, too. As if they were his own offsping, those owlets. For his and Harry's two silly feathered letter-carriers had found life-long mates in the company of one another, just as he and Harry had. It was all too, too soppy for words, that, but
"Oh, fuck off, Potter!" Draco barked back. "Come here, won't you? Let's get those rags you laughingly call clothing off you."
, he was going to suggest. Thankfully, he was cut off by his father's roar before he could complete that thought aloud—or Lucius may well have choked him to eternal silence.
Draco dragged in a deep gasping breath. He scowled—Harry could almost see the full frightening extent of it, even in the dark.
“I’m going to bed and hopefully also to sleep. And if you really want to talk this through, Harry, well tomorrow’s the start of the weekend, and you technically have the free time available. I’ll be right here, in our flat. That we share. Together. So! Like I said, good night.” He bared his teeth, scowling sufficient to cow any number of Wizards lesser than bloody Potter. Potter, however, merely scowled right back at Draco. “Fine. I won't wish you good dreams then,” Draco felt compelled to add snippily. “I hope they’re all horrid, actually. Bloody oblivious wanker!”
"No?" Harry licked the porcelain ear he'd just breathed into with reined-in passion. "You seemed a bit, oh—I don't know—jealous, perhaps?"
It resembled nothing so much as a simple, common, garden-variety daisy, drawn by his little godson. Excepting it was 2,500 years old, and radiating powerful magic in every direction.
“Hmph!” Harry scowled and shifted. “Maybe. I certainly can't manage the way it is now. I suppose it’s not a bad idea. Bit passive, but I certainly can’t think of a better one just off the top of my head and believe me, I’ve been thinking so much I’ve got a permanent headache installed. Well...That could be my diet, too. It's been mostly horrid. Thank Merlin for Millicent; she keeps me alive.”
So quiet it was in main room of the Caerphilly Cheese Canteen—that alarmingly trendy new 'hotspot' for the younger Wizarding set, conveniently right off Diagon in the newly updated Knockturn, or so the reviews read—a single brass fondue ladle hitting the floor would've been deafening. But no one so much as inhaled, nor swallowed their neatly apportioned chunks of fruit or sourdough. No melted cheddar dared drip and shatter the breathlessly overflowing silence—which was how Harry heard that little break in Draco's voice so clearly. That hitch, that telltale gulp, as if exiting a loo—
"Ugh!" he moaned, rocking his hips frantically between the wool tartan and the rigid bones of Malfoy's pelvis, eyelids squinched tight in desperate delight. "Please, Malfoy—do it! I'm asking!"
“Shut it,” Draco ordered, but he truly didn’t mind it—leastways, not the warming charm. That was but the work of a second.  He did so, and the bench seat fairly glowed. “Pansies. No cocoa, I am not your Elf, arsewipes.”
“Holding pattern?” Draco scoffed noisily, eyebrows shooting skyward as he raised his chin and leveled a narrow-eyed stare at Pansy, who was supposed to be his ally in all things and comfortable confidante. Her needles clicked on, unstoppable; she met and matched his Look with a scathing Look of her own. Draco tsked. “Tosh. Whatever do you mean, ‘holding pattern’? I’ll have you know I have a perfectly lovely, perfectly satisfying life, Pansy Parkinson Zabini, and--if it weren’t for my bloody house going off the rails and shoving procreation up my nose twenty four seven--I’d be continuing it on, happily uninterrupted! It’s hardly a ‘holding pattern’ when you like what you’re doing!”
“Alight, here goes,” Harry nodded, and gave the door a hard nudge with his boot, but carefully, so as not to scuff it. “Stay back, will you?”
"Nope," Draco huffed. He raised his chin and glared down his nose at Harry. "Not at all. We invent the game this time, not follow someone else's guidelines. Totally different."
A little splash of cold water on his face should do the trick to settle him down, Draco concluded—and mayhap a quick one-off in the loo. He’d missed his usual wank this morning, what with all that considering of tactical approaches for proper Potty-luring and he could feel it now, what with all the unseasonable, unreasonable heat.
And then—and then he would kill his idiot insane beloved again! Using an entirely different inventive method, quite possibly involving a rack-and-thumbscrews!
“Ah.” Harry essayed a hesitant grin, making vague shooing motions at Draco’s angry quill. “No, no, steady on, mate. It’s nothing serious, really. Just a spot of bother, in the end.”
Harry had been approached by one of the Mysteries representatives for a potential position even before he'd begun his final year of study.
tugged upon by an invisible sheath and then twisted next and nigh the base of the t'other. Then angled in at an exact degree between two white firm buttocks, piercing precisely an inflamed indent, sticky-slimy-positively

Draco sniffed, having waved his mother off for the evening. She'd some sort of drinks do to dress for; he'd be forcibly dragging himself away from the bounds of the Nursery wing e're long, no doubt, having been waylaid on the way to his dinner.
"Whatever," his ex-lover huffed at him. "Nothing! Whatevers, Malfoy. Just go away now. Piss off. Leave me alone."
Those Nymphs and those Satyrs, eyeing each other with lascivious interest from their hiding spots 'neath trees and vines overladen with--cough, cough--grapes, pomegranates and fecking golden apples.
Quidditch, for one—sport, in general. They'd that in common, the two of them—he and Weasley, that was, though naturally also he and Harry, for Quidditch, especially. And mums. Mothers and the nature of their nosiness into one's personal life for another. Narcissa Malfoy and Molly Weasley, as their two vastly different sons had variously discovered, had a great many traits in common, nosiness over one's personal life being the main one! But not to get into that personal bugaboo now—Weasel wasn't the issue, this Brown bitch was, and Draco was sick to death of it. Of
Not quite AK level yet, but damned close! Perhaps he could projectile vomit on Ron’s lap  in place of hexing his face to a blubbery heap? That would be enough to ensure he didn’t get any from Hermione for a good long while!
And—above everything, even his own ingrained Slytherin nature, compelling him to protect himself—Draco wanted
The world, which had been a brilliant if slightly anxiety-ridden place just moments before, turned a dull sullen grey as Draco considered that alarmingly reasonable possibility. His heart, which had previously resembled a soaring, swooping lark caught in the contains of his chest, turned a leaden object, thudding slowly behind the sheltering ribs that caged it. A deathly moribund object; a struck-hopeless one. It didn't have much purpose if Harry didn't want it, did it now?
"Oh, for Salazar's Sake!" Draco exclaimed, beginning to feel as though he'd suffered quite enough already. "I can't even talk to you, Father! Do leave off now—forget them for now—"
Come to think on it, though, Potter, as Draco well knew, had quite a decent neck on him for such a stubby berk. Nice and long, and well set on his shoulders. Shouldn’t hide that—it was an asset. Likely he’d look good framed in a pullover similar to Draco’s, and in the same green, too. Go along with his weird-coloured eyes—surely not a natural shade, that. Not Charmed, though—git had been glaring at him with those same toad green eyes since First!
" That's right, that's right," Malfoy was beyond pleased; he was triumphant. "Oh. Perfect Harry. That's what I need to hear, Harry—
Still, it was a long moment before Harry dragged his fascinated gaze forcibly from the sparkly, wondrous substance seated at Slytherin.
Without a single word said, the pall lifted. Silverware clinked; Ginny and Neville could be glimpsed toasting glasses of superior chardonnay and grinning like maniacs. The majestic maître 'd stopped his interrupted descent in their direction—no doubt he'd been thinking to toss their arses out the the door for making all that ruckus in the loo—casually settled his snowy white arm cloth and wheeled abruptly off in another direction.
me," Potter ordered, insistent now, and his eyes were on level with Draco's reluctant ones, and Draco's lashes could only shield him so well before Harry's stare pierced through. "Tell me, please. Draco. What did you want to say? Because I want to hear."
Harry was a damned fixer-upper, that's what. Draco knew this, as well as he knew his own three middle names. The prat positively lived to spring into action for a cause. Draco understood this, perhaps more than anyone alive could—really, how could one not? He'd been bloody saved by the arse! Along with every-bloody-else in the Wizarding world!
Harry collapsed back, exhausted and high as a sodding kite on sheer euphoria. But Malfoy kept at it, wringing the last spurts of come from his cock. And then exploded, flooding Harry’s arse with Wizarding spunk and a flow of magical essence that left them both dazed and confused.
Harry prayed silently, something he did seldom—more like never. He prayed fervently to a force inchoate, anything greater than he, who might take pity and look after the likes of fools and mad Wizards. As
He flung himself out of his clothes, not caring that he left them all over the floor. Shoved on his pajamas with little care and dove beneath the duvet as quickly as he could, spelling the sconces out as he went.
"So dreadfully sorry," Draco told the Lake water skimming his toes as he dipped down, lower and lower, his slow dolorous wing beats carrying him far too close to the wavelets lapping the shore.
. He could send his feelings: through the ring, through his cells—arcing through the shrinking gap till there was none.
Draco flinched. It was over, at last. He'd the best advice he was likely going to find, at least from the people who knew Harry better than he did.
"Profs!" shrieked Neville. He scuttled behind a grinning Thomas and a snorting Finnegan for cover. "No Profs!"
Small gestures: a quick snog in the lav, interrupted by Zach Smith barging in, whistling. The touch of fingertips tapping a jaunty tattoo on his knee under a conference table.
"How can I?" he'd asked of his old friend—no, demanded. "He's not interested, alright? Not in me, at least."
Harry gathered himself back together, jostling Draco's hand right off his crotch in the process. Frowning, he glanced about leisurely, tilting his head inquisitively, sticking the very tip of his pink tongue past his thinned lips.
"We'll need pumpkin juice, too, for the Youngers," Granger said thoughtfully, whipping out a notebook and a biro. "Patil, you need to check on the age of consent in Scotland, remember."
"Get off me, you lout!" Malfoy didn't; he did the opposite, actually. Harry panted at the weight pressing him inexorably down into the sand.
do, now." He sneered, and it was all Malfoy; learned behavior, obviously. Draco nearly sneered right back, defensively, but caught himself just in time. "Go away. Go back to your friends, Malfoy, go back to the flat, carry on with your life.
“Prick,” Harry muttered, eyes zeroing in on the hair in question. Damn! He’d not caught precisely how the flickering shadows threw Malfoy’s tumbling oh-so-elegantly-casual fringe into bas relief against the alabaster of his high forehead! That effect was somehow…very important—to Harry, at least.
It had been, of course, too good to be true. Draco wasn't meant to feel this sort of enchanted happiness, this level of content. It was too late, as well—he'd never impressed Harry as being particularly worthwhile, before; he'd never succeeded in keeping his attention for all that long a time in all the days they'd spent challenging one another. Why would it be any different now? Materially?
“Say that again, slowly?” she requested after a very long moment had passed, in a wondering tone of voice, rather s though she’d witness the birth of a supernova or something.  “Darling?”
And then he and his bewildered mouth were covered firmly by long limbs and wide shoulders, white hands and teeth, and all devoured.
Gods, but that had been difficult! Too much like work, actually. He’d had to force himself to be rigidly courteous and super-polite all throughout; it was completely strange to be even be attempting it. That wasn’t how he and Potter communicated with one another, normally. It had always been raw, before, and generally bloody.
He smiled hesitantly at Draco and his teeth were pretty and white and his lips were pink and moist. Draco, off-balance by leagues already, was enthralled by the curl of silky hair that tumbled down upon his scarred forehead and the glint of uncertain glee in Potter's green eyes—as if the barmy git would like to laugh but wasn't sure if he should.
Draco spun about, turning his back on the Picasso and meeting his old friend's eyes again but this time from what felt to be a far safer distance. Potter had always been far, far too sharp for a Gryffindor. And it paid to be wary when one was unfortunately now committed to talking about difficult things. Such as stupid old manors which acted out in defiance of their master's express wishes and how he, personally, wasn't exactly in the market for an infant. Now or possibly ever, really.
“Ack. Ahem!” Draco cleared his throat abruptly, scowling. Catching Snitches and conversing with Potters was not at all the same thing; there was no equitable equation implied. “Silly prat—it’s not that big a deal, really,” he told himself aloud. “Do the same for anyone. Knowledge is power; everyone knows!”
No time to brace, no time to inhale; no time, no time, no time! All was right now and fuck, yes! And Malfoy's brilliant grey eyes, burning into Harry's wide ones, the fingertips of one oily hand nearly poking Harry's eyeball out as his spectacles were ripped away from him and tossed summarily.
Harry inhales sharply; there’s a shooting star streaking the sky momentarily and he can almost believe he hears the acid sizzle. Draco would be delighted, he’s certain.
“Fuck!” Malfoy griped, wincing. “Slice it the fuck off, will you, Potty? We’ll see about that! Saucy little puss!”
“No, it's definitely settled, Hermione," he said after a long moment. "A toast to your native ingenuity, oh Brightest Witch!” He raised his glass in salute, enjoying her slight blush. "See? Harry's stopped sulking already. Good man."
"Because—!" Harry shot back immediately, tossing his head furiously. "Because…!" and then stopped, when words failed. Full halt, because how does one person confess to being lost without the other? He didn't know the words, the way the sorry tune went. He only knew the melody of melancholy, slowly transcending all the bright in his heart that had arrived along with Draco. "I—just," he managed to gasp, after a moment spent swallowing. "Draco."
“Rather naturally,” Harry allowed with a heavy sigh, “it follows that Wizarding homes, especially the really ancient ones, would become imbued with a quite strident sense of purpose, developing over time the goal of encouraging Wizarding folk to have as many children as they possibly could manage. Uh-huh, I see exactly what you’re saying here, Hermione. The two of us, we seem like perfect targets.”
"Potter! Take it, you sod!" Draco ordered, scowling ferociously. This really was not how he'd ever imagined becoming engaged, but then, this was Potter, wasn't it? Enough said. Of course it was bollixed up; he'd just have to get through it. "And stop with that infernal chortling, twit! Of course I'm not pranking you, idiot," he added, snarling, "I would hardly consider this a joking matter. Merlin! I'm proposing here! To you! Take me seriously, for fuck's sake!"
your mettle, Harry. I truly do not believe I can bear to be in this house a single fecking second longer, not as it is
. I mean, I don’t know how it expects me to produce children without one, do you? I'm not signing it up for that as a singleton. I know my limitations, believe me.”
His unrepentant lover only squirmed closer—and the Weasel and his bloody know-it-all of a main squeeze choose that exact moment to cum
"Bird? What bird, mate?" Potter arched a wary eyebrow, cocking his head enquiringly. "Are you sure you're sleeping enough lately?"
Gurgling his staunched outrage and his very real need to roger Harry to mindless acquiescence, Draco did as commanded: hard, fast and dry.
“Oh…ah? Really?” The runty, green-eyed git took an abrupt pace back, rocking precariously on the rundown heels of his ancient, duct-taped trainers for a space of seven seconds. He seemed as if vastly startled by Draco’s outburst, almost to the point of scrambling off into the throng of students outside the classroom, moving purposefully down the hallways to their lectures. But then Potter grinned tentatively at Draco.  Which was unexpectedly…quite pleasant. “Um. Thanks. Thanks for that. Malfoy. I’ll, er, I’ll try to remember.”
He examined the utterly ancient claviform before him--shaped a bit like the letter ‘P’ but not really--and knew instinctively that Altamira was the
, then?" He shrugged sharply; it became a body-length shiver. "You just admitted right out all you wanted from me was a fuck, yeah? And not just one, either. A whole series of lays and a frigging whore on your arm. Decorate your bloody life with Pureblood, was it? Show off to your friends how you can own one, just like, with a snap of those fingers. But, it's just…it's just pretty pictures, Harry. Just the packaging, the outside, that's all you wanted—that's all you saw, too! And you say
"You…" Draco shook his head slowly, eyes widening at nothing much in particular. Maybe the mantle, actually, with its dearth of pictures of the two of them. At home—at the flat—there were pictures of he and Harry everywhere, on every surface. "You're not serious." He rocked back on his heels, as if to align with a world suddenly shaken and upended. He inhaled sharply, gustily, and blew out a ragged breath. "Bite your tongue, Harry. You don't mean it."
"Get—off—me!" Draco growled testily, having been the one who'd taken the brunt of their abrupt expulsion from Sexual Space. "Killing—me—here! Ca-Can't
He'd much schoolwork to catch up on before mid-June rolled around. Far too much valuable study time had been lost to mending the Cabinet and his poor attempts on the Headmaster's life, and his grades reflected that, sadly. But Potter had mentioned they'd swot DADA together, and Charms, and Draco looked forward to it. He looked forward to nearly any excuse that intimated additional hours spent in Potter's company.
. Get out. This is my home now and I live here alone and I bloody don't want you in it any longer. Please…just…go."
"Oi?" He turned his head to see if Potter had heard it too, his embarrassingly loud gurgle. “Hey, have you dined?” he enquired, gently elbowing his friend the lump again for good measure. “Potter!”
“What, nothing! You startled me, that’s all. I’m…I’m not accustomed to you being at all ‘poetical’, as Ronald here calls it. That was very weird, Harry. Not at all like you.”
“We chat rather regularly about you, naturally, and of course about Harry, most recently. Which is unusual in and of itself for her Ronald and my Blaise, as generally it’s only ever them blabbering about what the kids get up to and then Quidditch matches. Oh, and sometimes mother-in-laws. Very touchy subject, mother-in-laws.”
“Then why, Potter, are you in such a rush to duck and run, may I ask?” Draco drawled, his stance relaxing a scant millimetre or so. “It’s not as though you’ve anything to fear from me.”
"Fuck!" Harry observed, after several of those moments had passed, his eyes snapping open in alarm. "Tempus! Shite! We're late, Malfoy—shift your lily-white arse!"
“No, no, no. This is nonsense, utter rot. You’re raving. You’ve cracked. The pressure has clearly been too much. Grimmauld sprouting surprise nursery floors, you blathering on about thinking your mad house elf’ was a decent roommate to you? It's too much, Harry.”
"Naturally. There's no harm to it, Draco, dear." His Mum reached out and offered up a tiny pat to his fisted hands, clasped in his lap, apropos perhaps the uneasy scowl flittering across her son's expression. The fingers of one tense were pried open and she pressed the box into his damp palm before sitting back with a quiet sigh.
“Yes, of course you may, silly twat! It’s been a full month already; I’ve not seen you at all!  More, probably. Never mind all this"--he waved carelessly at the ominous amount of paperwork surrounding him--"it's totally normal. And--and why the
"Not true!" Hermione pointed to the two romping about in the garden, smiling broadly. "As you see, chaps. Am I not right?"
“Gits,” Hermione shook her head at them and returned to carefully choosing her next helping of a well-balanced breakfast. “Right, don’t know you, either of you. Cheers.”
Harry smirked some more at Draco, rather nastily in the dim light. It made him look feral, what with those eyes of his. He set his teeth in a baleful flash and tapped a toe on the filthy pavers, toe tip running the spent fag-end into a filthy smear.
“What is?” Harry asked, smiling as he sat himself down, stripping off his Ministry robes as an afterthought and slinging them round the back of his chair. Kreacher had thoughtfully resized the usually large dining table down to a far more intimate proportion. Harry leant forward and topped up their glasses from the bottle hovering at the ready. "My decor? My carpet choices?" There were only their two seats and barely room for the crowd of covered silver salvers on the polished surface. He lounged back, grinning sassily at Draco. “Drink up, mate. There’s so many things you hate about me, Draco. I've quite lost track. Which one is this?”
Speaking of? Right about this time, Draco mused, leaning up against his flatmate, close enough to share body warmth, he'd wager the Manor’s current inhabitants were likely romping about the place fucking starkers. And shagging in the most unusual locations. He could confirm this because the week before he’d rather thoughtlessly dropped by his home without notice to retrieve one of his smaller lunascopes and had surprised them
"Um, no, actually, Dad," Draco shook his head. "I, er, engaged in a bit of that last myself, so you can't blame Harry for
"Well, Potter?" Malfoy tapped a toe at him, and then prodded Harry's elbow with same, gingerly. "Nothing to say for yourself?"
Harry was as bent as Draco was, the sod, and admitted it, no excuses. He just happened to be horribly…atrociously
. As in shagging, snogging, dating down the village on the weekend; all that nonsense. Besides, we've need of your help, the both of you. I'm fagged with not being able to spend time with my boy—"
"Mr. Kringleshanks! Yes—well, we were just going to ask to try those on. See—all right, Draco?—those in that red box, over there. With the rubies set in. That's okay, isn't it?"
, Harry! I still can't feel my sac! Bed sounds like a very nice place to be right now, alright? And we two should be off there, soon as we can. Just need Granger and we're golden."
"Ummmm, no…" Harry sighed, fetching up at last before Draco's casually crossed legs. He shuffled a bit in his socked toes, peering at Draco pensively through his floppy fringe, waiting. Waiting for Draco to do as he always did, which was to put aside whatever it was he'd going on and make a comfy place on his lap, specially marked 'Harry'. "Not really, no. Um, Lavender fed me already. We had pad thai."
Draco shook his head in the negative and occupied himself discreetly glancing about, feeling more than a little impressed. Potter's new space in the Ministry was capacious and decidedly elegant, a far cry from the claustrophobic cubicle his friend had been assigned when he'd begun his employment.
!" she panted, shifting her Muggleborn bum uneasily on the cushions beneath her. Her brown eyes were near to popping, so wide open were they. "That's so—that's…my
“Oh.” Harry stilled, though he kept his hands where they were. “Right.” They were very close, which wasn’t in itself unusual. As Aurors they were accustomed to sharing tight spaces at times; it was nothing new. But it felt differently even so, to Harry’s mind. “Fair point.”
way faded to the silvery-yellow of advancing age, despite that (very) few months in Wizarding gaol, off and on, after one Trial or t'other. Ahem, his hair—was silky-smooth about his well-clad shoulders, the coif exquisite, but yet waving wildly about with the sheer velocity of his internal miff-dom.
"Good-oh! Nice to see you finally in a cooperative mood, Malfoy," Potter sneered, "I was thinking that never happened." But he did draw closer, and Draco waved his wand at him and then at himself, banishing their garb to a place that wasn't cobwebby and likely full of spiders.
.  That should cement his reputation as a highly regarded young astronomer amongst the Muggles and Draco did so love to work smart and not hard.
"Should have guessed?" Harry asked, carefully, because really—could the two of them actually be that much of the same mind? Over this? "That I'd—that you would—what? What, Draco? What odds? It's not like its so obvious…is it?"
“Just jettisoning Peesely altogether, are we?” Draco chuckled, gathering Harry into his arms. “Hmm, such dereliction of duty. However, you were in hospital with Spell Damage recently so I suppose it must be allowed. I’ll put it in your official report tomorrow. Oh, and mine too, if you don’t mind. Meanwhile, I’ve a nice white chilling and supper will be ready and waiting.”
. Harry couldn't quite define it, but he knew what it did to his innards and how it disrupted his normally placid post-war brainwaves, and it was
"Huh?" It was all Harry could do to keep his attention from straying. Malfoy sounded so serious, so intent. He was entranced more by the tone of words than the actual meaning. "Er?"
Draco plopped himself on their carefully chosen divan—the one that matched both Harry's furniture and Draco's antiques—and snatched up the novel he'd been attempting to peruse three hours before—when the bastarding, cheating, oblivious git had been due to arrive home!
“Harry—my nymphet nit, are you even still awake?” Malfoy shoved him on the shoulder, impatient. “What d’you say then? Spain sound viable for your glorious eighteenth? Or would you rather see Gay Paree? Might be cooler there—or
Harry nosed his face with its askew-spectacles carelessly about the flurry of falling white-gold hair obscuring his vision, tickling his forehead, and tilted his head toward Draco's, as any fond lover would do. Gods, but it hurt, how he did that. And
“Yes, why?” Pansy chimed in, all spritely and sharpish. She folded her shapely legs under the hem of her very short skirt, tugging it down against the wind chill. “Do tell, darling?”
"And then we'll tell them about us," Harry grinned. "In June, at the Leaving Ball, before they have notice to go mad about it. And after that, we bolt for the wild blue yonder—safely."
"Hmm." Draco gazed at him, his eyes so close they were a blur of darkest midnight pupil and a dazzle of tinsel. They glittered as he blinked, very slowly. "And then, Harry?" he prompted, after a longish pause. "What?"
Perhaps because it was Malfoy suggesting it, and he'd not once shown any real honest-to-Merlin enthusiasm for a single game the bored Eight Years played every single Friday night like clockwork in the communal Common Room, solely as an excuse to imbibe heavily, snog sloppily and play 'Shag 'N' Swap' as the evening waned. He'd participated, of course. Naturally, as he absolutely hated to lose, and had even won various rounds of the many old chestnuts of group gaming. He was especially skilled at Muggle poker and could deal a mean hand of Hearts. He was rumoured to live up to his reputation as 'Slytherin Sex God', as well, which led to his being rather sought after as a partner for those aforementioned Shag 'N Swaps.
Adrian Brie-Pucker was a dapper young Wizard, with dark hair and a smallish frame, like Potter's. Even his hair stuck up—also like Potter's—but his eyes were a pale, washed-out blue-grey. He did, however, boast of taller blond male Bond-partner, which for some reason left Draco feeling nauseatingly fond of them both by simple association, and Pucker was 'the' known supreme master of dessert-oriented confection.
eat like an actual adult does at dinner time but that you’re still somewhat peckish and I’ll tell you something better instead.” He glanced pointedly at their coffee table, where he’d slung the shrunken packets of takeaway. And smiled grimly. “Yes, indeed. Something very nice, Potter. Potter.
“Hmm?” Harry slowed down and half turned about, not wanting to lose sight of that Lake water hair, courageously forging ahead through the crowd before them. He glanced back at Ron, who was simply planted stock-still in the busy corridor, surrounded by giggling Firsties on their way to Charms, totally blocking the corridor. “What are you on about, Ron? Hurry up—we’ll be late!”
"But, it doesn't matter, does it, Draco?" The green eyes were pleading and Draco's jaw dropped. He'd never had Potter—
Harry loved him. Those three little words allowed the sun to rise on better days; they caused his very blood to dance through Draco's veins; they conferred upon him such a great joy he could only articulate a bare tenth of it—and that not clearly. For he'd not ever conceived of such a very—such an incredible—oh, but such an amazing state existing within him! And he a Malfoy, known for the ice water that ran through his veins. A Malfoy to be properly Mated and not in some bloodless Blood-pure arranged marriage! And to Harry, the unlikely object of, well, many a long year of Draco's furtively passionate feelings!
Would be a good idea to swot up on all his rival’s latest tricks in readiness for the next match, right? Draco assured himself. Perfectly reasonable, then, keeping a close eye on Potter. And nothing unusual or unnatural  about it, either. He’d done exactly that, before the Dark Lord bit the big one at Potter’s wand end; was accustomed to it. Learnt some, too. In fact, that was precisely why he’d chosen to sit in the bleak stands on a cold autumn afternoon, watching the inexpressibly lame match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Yes, he was indeed covertly observing his one true rival in life, sussing out his wicked-smart Quidditch strategies, right? That was his story and he was sticking by it, come what may. And his seat, which was the best one available for Potter-spotting. Even if it was a bit chillier than expected, this far up in the stands.
“...Okay,” Draco sulked, subsiding into the squabs of the settee. “I’m listening. Said I was, didn't I?”
nesting, with three downy chicks under her great striped wings, and he could understand exactly why Harry didn't want to call her away from the duties of motherhood. Harry was an utter slob for little fuzzy helpless beasties, the prat. "You could've used Ethelred. He's only sitting 'round on his great duff, the useless git."
have. And Ron's tired of it, Harry—I mean to say, he's complaining to Seamus about you and you know it's bad with him when he does that. Besides, you're not really like this, Harry; you're a better man, deep down; you know you are! So, go! Go, gather up all that famous Gryffindor courage of yours and tell him!"
“Oh, just something amusing. Or rather, more ironic than anything, really, but also slightly amusing. More for me, I suppose.”
The thought of going and coming left Harry a right oozy mess in his bits. He moaned, incapable of thanking his friend even for the sympathy.
“Brilliant,” Harry nodded. “Peesely can piss right off, interfering old git. I like your settee better than mine anyway. Mine’s lumpy or something. Ahem. Shall we?”
"I'm telling you, it's the same thing as the Talent Show, all over again," Bulstrode sighed. "Really, Draco, I thought you were as smart as Granger, here."
"Like that, do you? Want some more?" Harry nodded and Draco began working up his throat, nipping it and matching each little bite with the thrust of finger, till Harry was moving restlessly about underneath him, his breath coming short and sharp in the quiet of the room.
now dwell in, weren't we? But my House is just as horrid, damn it, even if it's all frolicking mooncalves and towering stacks of nappies! It’s worse than a mere fucking Curse now and Mum’s saying there’s nothing anyone can do, not that she knows of, not that even Blaise’s mother knows of--but you, Potter! You’re the one I need, I know it. You've got it, the knack of saving people, and bloody hell, Harry, I need saving!”
"No, I—" Harry sagged as Malfoy's lips touched his, ever so briefly, and pulled back. "But—what? You!"
"But—go ahead. Open it," Draco still wouldn't look. His lips twisted though and Harry thought maybe it was a near facsimile of a smile. "Right? T'is the season and all." The passersby outside the window, even being nothing more than red-nosed, scarf-wrapped ghosts reflecting, were more of interest to him than Harry. "Get it over with, Potter."
…And the lack of oxygen available for easy processing, which was causing him to choke on his own saliva, but that last effect—
"That sounds brilliant, Draco!" Potter's gaze was glowing; Draco caught tiny flecks of gold swimming in it, visible now that they seemed lit from within. And the little berk hadn't stopped his pointless grinning once—in fact, it was far worse now than before.
“Fuck! That’s not necessarily true, Malfoy,” Potter shot back, gripping Draco’s hand a little harder. “Why, just a few months ago, the Unspeakables were heavily involved in that Auror drive to contain those--oh, fuck! I can't tell you that. Why?”
"Oh, god, Draco…" Harry moaned. For it was sinking in, the 'next year' bit. Molten through his very chest, nearly exploding it—that, and his brain, which duly imploded.
"Draco." So sensible, so sane. Harry so matter-of-fact, as if there was no other way. As if it were inevitable, that horrible day. Which was mad, completely, and Draco's head was spinning with how very mad it all was. "
Which Draco did do, swallowing down his all-consuming and perfectly natural ire, and bringing his knees together.
“Better than anything on earth, isn’t it, Potty?” Malfoy asked, twinkle decidedly returned to his eyes. Of all things, he adored poking at his Potter the most.
Oh, but his Harry was ever so fit—and ever so fanciable! Draco, entirely derailed by manly beauty and awestruck by a clear gaze that seemed to pierce right through his heart, was certain he couldn't possibly be more ecstatic it was Harry his Veela Fate had chosen for him. Ah, to marry Harry and spend a lifetime in the git's company would be all the good things life could ever provide him—and more! Certainly he'd a job of work to do before him, a task that would consume years, restoring the Malfoy name to some sort of respectability, fashioning himself into a person Harry could be proud to have on his arm—but if Harry was with him, all along the way? Oh, bliss!
"I've brand-new dress robes that'll fit him," Zabini had roused himself, sufficient to edge closer. "Can enchant them to be little looser, you know—up top. Show off those shoulders of yours, old man. Most impressive."
“Fine. Done…but I’ll take Saturday next—Hogsmeade weekend, remember? Tuesday’s too soon—Draco’s daft but not that daft. He’ll never sort out how to go about approaching Potter by then, much less do anything useful about it. Tuesday’s too soon.”  And that was Pansy, plotting.
It was perfectly alright to be excited over a spot of spirited flying—even if it was Potter doing it! Perfectly understandable—even the expected response. Besides—everyone had been enraptured—not only one Draco Malfoy, neophyte convert to the Church of Potter-as-Quidditch-God. Or maybe just God, period.
Interpretations – Eihwaz does not mean literal death, but is more of a metaphor indicating transitions, renewals and fresh starts."
"Sure, Potter," Draco scoffed. "Give up on the Golden Boy when you have even the slightest chance of bagging him? I don't think so."
"Of course you didn't, Harry," Draco snapped. "I never got round to all the gruesome details, did I? We were far too busy getting trollied and gawping at the brothel
And dinner? The dinner he'd so carefully prepared, after a long hard day of toil? His special Friday night 'aren't we glad to be home again, us two, and happily together?' dinner was stony cold and it was nearing half ten—and there was absolutely no sign of the world-saving git—and Draco (Merlin help him; he didn't deserve this!) was
"No—no!" If nothing else, ever, than Draco had to let Harry know he didn't doubt. That he wouldn't think to—that he couldn't bear to, not now, nor in the future. His life was built atop this rock-solid foundation; there was nothing and no one else in the world for him. He couldn't conceive of having another person see him like this—open and spread and vulnerable, waiting, wanting—he didn't wish to.
It wasn't as though he’d not had a few thoughts exactly along the same lines as what his friend was saying; it was just that it was difficult to verbalize. A nebulous wish and perhaps not even truly his own?
"Where's your Wonder Witch, Granger? Go and roust her out, Harry. Say we've had a little…a little accident, er—with a Potion, that's it. The one for Slug, alright? She'll buy that, I'm sure. She can help us."
Draco didn't quite take in what Granger would do to him if he didn't go straight off and apologize to Harry; how it would hurt, the hexes she'd throw his way. He just…couldn't quite think how to go about it, apologizing; not in a manner that guaranteed success. He wasn't so good at saying he was sorry, he knew that. And he'd his pride, once. When Harry had walked he'd still had all his pride about him, bolstering him. All his courage. Now he'd nothing, three weeks from that fucking horrible day. Tatters, maybe.
"Draco, yes, yes, yes," and when Draco bit his shoulder, sucking, Harry was a real goner; he'd say anything—anything at all, in any language Malfoy wanted him to learn. "Draco, please! Now? Let me come now?"
Granger's eyebrows met her hairline briefly and then disappeared entirely. She parted her lips but said nothing.
“Fuck, no,” Draco snarled, elbowing his way forward so they were neck-to-neck, shoulders pressed tight, both of them glaring dangerously at the gaping maw as it opened. “Make room, git. In this together, remember?”
“How could you? How could you even sow that horrible thought in his fucking fertile Gryffindor mind, Granger-Weasley? Talk about extreme measures! You
"I like it, I suppose. And yes, again--it's all true. I am indeed home to stay and for the foreseeable future. Bloody Grimmauld Place certainly seems to believe I am.” He chuckled ruefully, shrugging. “Judging by the way it's been acting up since I set foot back into it. I mean, it's always been a little odd, but this! Which I actually wanted to ask your advice about but we'll get to that, yeah? Thanks, though. I'm chuffed you're happy. Not that I wouldn't expect you to be, but still. It’s good, all of it. Brilliant to finally see you again, and in person, too. I've missed you something fierce, you know. I said, didn't I? Earlier.”
? I did spend all those years believing he was a serious git. I did torment and insult him and basically act like he was a wart. I wouldn't believe him either if he tried it on me. Stands to reason."
"What's what?" Harry sighed, peering down at the tiny font on the pages his partner had flipped the book open to. "Hell, Draco, I can't even make it out. Gibberish."
He blinked slowly as he drew away, and Harry had to pull back a wee bit to even see the trace of lingering uncertainty. No, it wasn't the usual calm air of arrogance that confronted him, the severely tailored Malfoy sense of being 'utterly correct in all things' that Harry saw in the depths of icy glass. And those refracted panes to Draco's soul weren't nearly so frosty, not as they were usually. They were melting, dark as molten pewter, and Harry's insides melted right along with them.
"Hah! More like he'll scarper off the other way!" He was unconvinced and what was more, was still pink-cheeked with his growing embarrassment. "I don't think so—not Malfoy! He's just not into me, I'm afraid. He'll think I'm on at him for some idiot dare or the other—or I'm acting under an Imperius—or something like! He'll never believe I'm serious—why should he, anyway? Really,
, that Harry. So blind and dumb and honestly unknowing, the blighter. Fucking Dursleys! The damage they'd wrought on Harry's screwed-up emotional interior landscaping would never be fully plumbed!
And the situation needed fixing, at least in Draco's opinion; required it, even, and to that end he was in overweening need of a ring. A ring that symbolized a union—an unbreakable, unalterable bond. A special band that would stridently proclaim Potter his, Draco felt, which was exactly how it should be. For such an object would flash on Potter's finger like a bleeding beacon and warn off every potential rival. A ring…well, it would be Draco's polite mark upon Potter's person, more even than the love bites Draco liberally scattered down the tawny palette of Potter's perfect throat, more even than the fine silver chain he'd purchased on a whim in Hogsmeade just last week and presented Potter with a blush and a whole case of Frogs—more even than the fact Draco was in constant satellite motion about Potter's person, morning, noon and night, and much to the consternation of Potter's assorted mates.
"Hah!" he panted triumphantly. "There's another one, besides this," he added breathlessly, biting away at Harry's lips as he chatted. "Wanna know what it is, Harry?"
“Stay?” Harry asked the quiet of curtains drawn, the flutter of very thin eyelids, veined blue; the mumble-grumble-snort and shift of a bright-banner morning Malfoy, inciting. “Stay, please, for me?”
—you tit—it's not a love potion, per se, he wants of us specifically; it's one that'll manipulate emotions. This one does that and far more efficaciously than your little Vane bint's bollocks-upped brew ever did. We're talking pure, unalloyed lust here, Harry, when it's been distillated properly—not some simpering hearts-and-flowers
pleasant experience, have you. Leasees too, for yours. No sense in letting them sit empty. You’ll likely want to find someone with children--or someone who desperately desires them. Be kinder to your homes that way; let them down softly?”

"Here, but why here, Harry? The wards," Draco breathed out, still staring about him and feeling shocked shiteless, not really minding his ex-boyfriend's words because his ex-boyfriend's old house was so incredibly different. Like the flat, actually, but also

"—that idiot Pansy spent ages trying to convince me to make up Amortentia, you know, and I always put her off. Which isn't easy; she nags, Harry. You know how that is, right? Girls do, damn them."
, yes—the word described the effect brilliantly. He wondered why he’d never noticed that specific quality of, er, ‘prettiness’ before, in relation to the git.
Exhausting, perhaps, but immensely satisfying. Harry smiled for no reason as he picked over a small pile of polished chrysocolla at a quite posh stall, admiring the blues and greens of them and intricate patterns within, devised by nature itself. One would do for a Rune, he decided, catching it up and eying it critically, with the same degree of learned assessment he and his fellow Mages had employed the day prior, flying over Nazca. Yes, Hygieia was horribly draining and left a chap face flat on the ground after, but it was also their calling, their avocation, and they would continue to use it and others like it, whatever the personal cost. The Lines themselves were again fully restored for the nonce, sharp and elegant and as refulgent of power as they’d ever been, thousands of years ago in the times of their making. His Flower bloomed, and would for years to come.
Draco blushed scarlet with pleasure; this lube incantation was unlike any they'd ever used before—tasted eons better (
, either, Draco—a person can't live like that, always trying to be someone else. I should know, yeah?"
planning on joining the unfortunate Ravenclaws on the shameful side of defeat! He was still the House Quidditch Captain, bugger it—Senior Captain and expected to set an example—and he’d a few tricks of his own, yet!
that piddling D.A. of Potter's besides should Dumbledore allow it—anything to keep that expression stuck on Potter's dumb scrunched-up-with-smiles face. It was an utterly brilliant look on him; Draco had never seen the like.
"Fool!" She spat, newly ticked off, rising like a small Fury and tugging her silent sidekick along with her impatiently, her disgust with Draco over-evident and brashly loud. "You've let it go too far again. He's broody, Harry is. Probably obsessing, thinking he's made this grand gesture by walking out and now he can't come back here, even if he
Harry shrugged. He wasn't so sure of that. After all, he'd just dropped the other boot—well, more like an entire cobbler's shop—and nothing too terrible had happened.
"Sorry!" Draco snickered, spreading his hands wide and grinning full out to show he didn't mean a word of it. "Yes, you know me too well; of course I'm a bit of an arse. We all have our own upbringing to blame for something, don't we? But me too, Harry. I've really--I mean to say it's not been much of a lark, you being gone. It’s been far too long; I was just thinking that the other day. Mum’s been after me to Owl or Floo you for ages now but I knew--although I shall swear under Veritaserum you’d never, ever say so, no fear!--you’d not be so easily accessible. Nature of the job and all that. Still a bit amazed I found you this morning. I wasn't sure you were flooable here at the Ministry, really. And I knew you'd had Grimmauld all shut down when you left, so no use trying there.”
Draco shivered and turned his head sharply to the left, examining the carved stone of the Witch's arm with great interest. The Witch was constructed of a grey marble—no, surely it was basalt, similar to the Hanging Stones he'd seen at Merrivale during a family outing there. Or, perhaps a metamorphous rock of some sort; granite? In any event, it was fascinating, what one could learn from intense observation to detail.
"Oh, Draco!" Hermione, startled, cast her tome on magical arachnids flying up from her lap with a jerk. "Oh, sorry—didn't see you there."
! Bleeding morons!” Hermione choked, surfacing briefly, and then fell about with another fit of the giggles, in the face of her friends descent into total mutual twatdom.
“Thank you, thank you kindly, ladies and gents!” Ron, meanwhile, toasted his unappreciative audience with another sausage.
"Oh!" Harry blushed, leaning forward to give his lover's long pale neck and wide shoulders a fleeting embrace. "I'm so sorry, babe. Er…um, shall we, then?"
Draco flushed lightly at the accusation; couldn't control it, not whilst Harry was trailing his fingertips—his messy, untrimmed, bitten-over fingernails, scratchy and unkempt, the heathen bastard—down the sculpted planes of his bared torso. He shivered in reaction, tossing his head regally.
“Of course I am, darling,” his mother tinkled sweetly, shaking her sun-kissed head. “My 'bird' is highly vouched for. He's most definitely in Town, even if you've not heard official word of it yet. Strange, that. I'd have thought--"

"But?" Draco could tell his partner was still bothered by Pince's desertion of duty. In the olden days Hogwart's Librarian would no more have left a student lingering after close than she'd dance naked on the High Table at supper but…things had changed. She was older, more easily distracted—and damned close to forcible retirement, any road.
“I know,” Harry mumbled, unwilling to look up. He dared not, truly, because Draco was very compelling, even when a person hadn’t been struck by a Truth spell. “Me, too. Yours, I mean. I mean, I feel the same way, about you.”
"Come on, then. Sit!" Draco beckoned sharply, fingers miraculously still unclenched, and the horribly
…And further, he’d noticed Potter was wearing his knitted Gryffindor abomination as well, even though it was against regulation to wear House scarves during games; something about safety measures, what the ends trailing after; maybe ending up caught in someone’s bristles.
"If you say so." Harry sounded quite doubtful about that, but it may've been the shortness of breath caused by the fierce rush up the staircase. "Still not--"
"Harry?" Draco sniggered at him, but in a very fond and friendly sort of way. "What, surprised we think alike? After all this time. Prat. Be stranger if we didn't."
"Sorry, luv," Harry shrugged and wended his arms a bit tighter 'round Draco's waist, snuggling. "Wish I'd been here, instead. Stupid drains, the Muggle ones—always mucked up. And poor Lav—she's a right mess, she is. I just…I just feel so sorry for her, now. She needs her friends about her."
was in any position to do a damn thing about it, the offspring idea. It had been close to two years since he’d had any manner of a serious relationship and none of the various Wizards he’d pulled since interested him in the slightest, not beyond a quick fuck. He had standards, didn’t he? Surely the Manor could understand standards, steeped as it was in centuries of assumed privilege? He hoped so but he wasn't sanguine, no matter what he'd said to Harry.
The Lines were messages, meant for descendants, direct from the ones who had lived eons before Harry, Luna and Ishika-san had come to listen and to see what the Lines had to say, of course. For long ago there was magic to be found merely in not only eking out a daily living but also in the deliberate creation of the great Places, the Channels and the Paths and the Leylines of water and air, birds and other creatures, resounding of the lives of the People themselves and the other lives abounding large and small about them. One could be a simple little daisy; one could be great cat, one could be a Wizard or Witch or a Muggle who dwelt amongst them--one could be anything at all, and every one of those was precious and necessary.
“How so?” Draco demanded sharply, downing the remainder of his wine in one gulp. He coughed, raising a hand to cover his mouth politely. “Pardon.”
It was a threat; that sort of thing Harry recognized instinctively, after years upon years of it, relentless. Ad he reacted instinctively, just as he always had before, before Malfoy had dragged him into this endless sensual feast and claimed every spark of Harry's flagging will for his own amusement.
, which was the strangest sensation possible; just enough to make the incantation take hold and continue on unabated: one cock, long and pale and rosy-red at the tip, swathed shiny with copious lube, slotted cleanly into one small pink pucker, also dripping. The other prick—shorter, a little thicker, and with a purpling vein beneath flinching as Harry shuddered helplessly—was
“Could be. Who's to say, though? Hermione says sometimes it happens this way; these old places have minds of their own. But getting back to our plans, I’m so glad you popped by, mate. I really have missed your pointiness. Two years is a bloody fucking long time to be completely cut off, you know? Andy said you were absolutely brilliant with Ted the entire time I was, erm, gone. Thanks for that, you know? Made all the difference to me, Draco. It was difficult enough, leaving. Worse, leaving him behind. You know?”
“What? Is that your bloody motto? And, in its further favour,” Draco responded sternly, “it’s a much better idea than what you’ve gone and inflicted on poor old Grimmauld Place. Grimmauld is so far from the ideal of a honeymoon destination, Potter, it’s in a different galaxy. Perhaps Alpha Centauri. You really need to ask Hermione's help; find a better solution than renting it out nightly. Kreacher’s not looking at all well these days. Terribly haggard. For Kreacher, Harry, that’s saying rather a lot. He’s not spritely on a good day.”
“Wasn’t there long, though," he informed Draco's grudgingly enquiring eyebrows. "Just popped in and let Millie know I wasn't available this entire weekend. For a change, what?” He chuckled jovially, causing Draco to gently set his back teeth in an effort to maintain passivity. "So, long story short, here I am, mate"--the oblivious one gestured cheerily, grinning--"free as a bird, right? So. We should take advantage, yeah? Go somewhere, do something. Fun. Have some of that."
The urbane and cosmopolitan—yet somehow unexpectedly sensitive and intuitive—Narcissa Malfoy sipped her Oolong daintily, briefly closing her delicate eyelids in admiration of the wafting and elusive aroma of steamed jasmine-scented leaves. Sighing lightly, she placed her cup upon its paper-thin saucer with a decided and deliberate 'clink!' Those finely plucked eyebrows, so like Draco's, drew together in the teeniest, tiniest of puzzled frowns. Her expertly reddened lips pursed as she cocked her head and stared wide-eyed and guileless at her sole offspring, ostensibly astounded at his gawp-and-huff reaction to his mother's perfectly sensible reaction. Her son scowled in return, lips thinned disagreeably.
"You don't know even what I am, Draco, who I am," he murmured, so close to Draco's ear, Draco could practically hear the words inside his brain, echoing. "And you seem to believe it's all a game with us, I swear you do. That that was all it ever was, all along. You don't see
"Babe," Harry leant over and captured Draco's smirking mouth for a quick hard kiss, fingertips wrenching his chin 'round upon his willowy neck to do so. "Don't stir things up, alright? We've a job to—"
Potter snorted, bursting out in a peal of laughter. He ran a fast palm through that hair, ruffling it into a state of charming abomination.
Draco ignored them both, by and large. Personally, he was oblivious by then, excepting the exceptional length of Potter engorged and moving smoothly within his backside. 'Specially when, with an extra jerk and throb, the nub of Harry's willy repeatedly banged away at his prostate.
“Alright, alright!” Harry cringed back in his seat and threw up his hands, feebly attempting to ward off his determined partner. He definitely didn’t care for the ‘I mean fucking business, Potter’ glint in the git’s eye. “I’ll tell you--I will! All the bloody details. Just give me a half of a moment--”
Instead of responding, Malfoy glanced over at Hermione, who'd given up on her search for the requested notes and was in the midst of hastily gathering all her various things together, tossing them into her bag willy-nilly. Excepting the tartan, of course. Because Harry was still planted upon it.
“One for good luck, before we go? Just a little taste, that’s all. Like this.” Draco brushed his lips meaningfully against Harry’s, the barest tip of his tongue snaking out to moisten them. He drew back his head just as quickly, smiling wryly. “It’s been a long time I’ve been waiting, alright? A damned long time, really. Eternity, feels like.”
“You’ve noticed, I’m sure,” Pansy murmured softly, shifting closer to Theo, and speaking just below Draco’s optimal audial range, “he’s making no sense at all recently? That wasn’t even a decent comeback, Nott.”
Neville whimpered. He covered his head with his hands protectively and hunched into the teddy bear's lap in a vain attempt to hide. "Please not Ginny, guys. Please, anyone but Ginny. She scares me."
“Do I need to use a Silencio, then? And some Sticking Charms? I will, you know. Just keeping pushing, Nott.”
"Ta, Mills," Harry replied, glancing up and giving her a weary but grateful smile. "That would be brilliant, if it's no trouble."
“What can I say?” Potter laughed, clearly unrepentant, though he did leave off contorting himself and settled comfortably back against the cushions. “Oh, that’s right--I can’t. I’m an Unspeakable.”
It sent him into a full-out panic, that. He struggled and squirmed backwards, frantically seeking space before he leapt all over Malfoy anyway and clung like the slaggiest of slags, but Malfoy didn't allow him much freedom, if any, snaking a quick deft hand 'round the back of Harry's neck and stilling him carelessly with that single, brilliant touch.
“Tosh!" he scoffed. "If you did, then I never responded because I’d already gone. I was off picking up Thai for us!” Draco sniffed indignantly. “In Muggle London, where Owls aren’t supposed to go! Because I’d not heard a peep from you--as usual, mind--and I knew you had some hush-hush project going on and I also bloody fucking absolutely knew you’d likely not even had eaten luncheon, much less any supper. Millie as much as said so. So! Pardon me for attempting to keep you stationed on this corporeal plane, Potter. So sorry for trying to help your sorry arse out--
How he refrained from screaming, Draco didn't know. He blamed it squarely on Harry, though, and clamped down on the acid welling in his gut. Fiercely!
“Gladly,” Draco replied instantly, shutting his eyes and desperately envisioning the safest, most secure place currently available for refuge. “Ah! Molly Weasley’s Kitchen!”
But the entire time he was speaking, Draco was also utterly unable to cease mentally pawing through the shop's pathetic little wares—except that they
“Don’t you dare ‘Potter’ me, Draco,” Harry ordered tensely, digging his fingers into those broad shoulders, the same ones he’d been side-eyeing lasciviously for years. “It’s well beyond blasted Malfoy and Potter and you know it! Now, are you teasing me or goading me or exactly what, here? Leading me on, just to drop me like a stone or do you really mean what you seem to say? Do you truly care that much about me? Tell me the fucking truth, for once! I wasn’t lying when I said I was tired, damn it!”
Of course he'd literally had not a single solitary clue he’d ever be someone like that, really. He’d always fancied himself as an Auror, as soon as he’d turned eleven, gone full-on Magical and learnt what an Auror was. It wasn’t till near the end of his second year at uni, once Ron and Hermione had completed their courses of study and it was evident Malfoy was staying on to pursue a higher level in Astronomy that Harry had stumbled into what quickly became his obsession: Ancient Runes.
