He shifted Draco into his arms, scooping as much of him up as he could in attempt to cover him up again with Harry’s body. “We’re all war survivors, Ron,” he tried to remind without getting tetchy.
“Yes, pervert,” Draco aspirated making Harry chuckled as he dropped his hands. Harry’s eyes raked over Draco, examining the extent of the goop on him.
Harry stepped into the tub, adjusting the temperature with his wand so as not to burn Draco’s too chilly skin. “Nothing's wrong,” he wrote off with barely a thought.
Harry cleared his throat, “Yup.” Draco opened his eyes to the mirror and watched Harry pant silently behind him. He watched as his face flickered between relieved and disappointed as Draco lowered his hips back under the water.
Harry grabbed Draco’s face with both hands rougher than he had been handling Draco to focus his panicked gaze onto Harry, “I need you to trust me. I’ll keep you safe and I’ll get your family out. But it’ll only work if you trust me.”
If his eyes weren’t closed Draco would have rolled them, Harry was certain. “Let the rain wash away your sins,” Draco drawled. Harry pouted; His preferred sin repentance came in the form of getting shitfaced with Ron. That probably wouldn’t be considered repentance though. More like avoidance.
Harry stuck out his tongue, childish but felt right if he was gonna get called out like that, “I can’t tell you. Draco would kill me if I did.” Wrong answer. Ron’s mild pout turned to a frown.
“I’m pregnant,” Draco interrupted. With a gargantuan splash, Harry’s umbrella charm broke, drenching Harry instantaneously. Harry’s wild curls flattened over his face, straightening out over his eyes from the heavy water making him gasp. Shocked equally with the sudden cold water and the unexpected waterboarding from his hair blocking his nose. Shoving his hair out of his face, Harry continued to gape at Draco whose impassive mask was flickering out of place showing panic and potential for vomiting and running away. Though Draco’s muscles were probably so cold he’d hurt himself if he were to try to run away. What could Harry possibly say that wouldn’t make Draco try to run away? What do you say to your secret
“Yeah, and he’s a bloody Death Eater too! And you want me to just go up to Dumbledore and say what? Hey mate, I’ve been chosen to kill you, whaddya think about that?” Draco shrieked sarcastically.
The edges of the window were fogged up from the temperature difference between the spring rain and the cozy indoors plus the steady stream of rain made viewing the grounds in front of him a little difficult. Not to mention that despite it being early afternoon, the outside was darker than the lit-up room. Even with all of these hindrances, Harry’s eyes locked in onto a man’s form lying sprawled out on the grass in the downpour rain. He was so thoroughly drenched that his silver-blonde hair was a dark grey. It should have made him indistinguishable from any other student, for it was his hair that made him stand out from a distance like this. However, Harry knew without a doubt that it was indeed his boyfriend laying in the rain like a bloody weirdo. What the hell was he doing?
“I’m pretty sure I just saw your eyes almost open,” Harry nipped Draco’s earlobe with his taunt while adding a third finger.
? What would it be like to sink his teeth into that flesh? He’d love to make it raw with his teeth marks and soothe them over with kisses and kitten licks. Daydreaming of the taste of Harry’s arse, Draco absentmindedly tipped the Dragon Star seed powered into the main cauldron instead of the mini one they had set up to create a liquid solution before adding it to the main cauldron. The liquid burped as dread filled Draco’s body. He whispered a quick, “Oh shit,” and the once thin and slippery blue potion turned thick and gooey shooting straight up out of the cauldron to hit the ceiling and pour down over Draco. He gaped like a fish, trying to breathe through the downfall of thickened fluid. He could feel it slide down his back between his robes. He was rooted and blind, unable to wipe his eyes clear because he could feel that his hands were covered in the goo too. Faintly, under the goop coating his hair over his ears, he heard Harry’s boisterous belly laugh. Hands dripping, he flipped Harry off, only making him laugh harder. Sputtering goop that was trying to slip between his lips, Draco bitched, “You think you could pull yourself together anytime soon and help me?”
Draco whined, “M’s so tired.” Harry huffed as he stepped up onto the first step of the longest flight of stairs but right around the corner would be the entrance to the 8
“I know, love, you meant that you weren’t thinking of how our kissing will affect your family’s willingness to be saved by me.” Harry worded for him, cupping his palm around one of those pink cheeks. Draco nodded and turned his head slightly to kiss Harry’s palm.
“Hey! It’s not my fault that I didn’t know that there were different consequences to when two wizards dot dot dot vs two muggle men!” Harry defended.
Ron put his hands on his hips and grinned, “Yeah, except I didn’t say who, you did, and if he wasn’t your boyfriend you would have said,” Ron made a mess of his copper locks and put on a mocking unamused look pretending to be Harry, “Who’s my boyfriend? Or you would have said, ‘Course he’s being weird, Ron, I don’t even know his name.” Ron’s grin only grew as Harry glared him down. The fucker had a point and Harry didn’t know how to get out of this one. It was a Western stand-off between Harry’s stubborn glare and Ron’s gloating mirth and Harry wasn’t going to be the one to break it until he had come up with a way to salvage his slip up. His eyes were parched when Ron broke with a laugh and tugged Harry’s arm out of the bed, pointing out the window, “While you keep coming up with that lie, the ferret is going to get pneumonia.” Harry stumbled out of the bed, cascading his sacrificial offerings all over the floor. His only saving grace from face planting into the mess was the same reason he was in danger of it, aka Ron’s Keeper’s hand gripping his arm. Harry straightened up and yanked his arm from Ron’s grasp and swatted him before looking out the window.
Harry pushed back the hair that had fallen into Draco’s face, and spoke calmly having to work harder to keep from spooking Draco without the Luck, “What if we got your mother to safety?”
“We’re not enemies. We hung out too. Ate takeaway and watched movies. Draco’s obsessed with Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice,” Harry smiled softly remembering Draco’s teasing toes digging into his thigh as he tried to convince Harry to get an old fashion muggle long coat and britches.
Unable to pout in silence, Ron prodded, “So, why was the prat wallowing?” Harry froze in the middle of pushing a button through the eyelet, he knew without a doubt that Draco would not want him to tell Ron just yet. But they all knew Harry’s lying skills. If Harry was to bet on who made their secret relationship obvious to everyone, it’d be his arse he’d bet on. “Are you really trying to lie right now?”
He sneered down at Harry, “That’s Malfoy to you, Potter.” Harry just rolled his eyes and hopped up onto the ledge beside Draco who stared back at him incredulously. “What are you doing?”
“And what sort of competitor would I be if I gave them up?” Draco taunted though weakened by the breathy end from the glide of Harry’s cock moving in and out of him. He moved so slowly it was nothing but a tease winding him up so tautly but not enough to snap delightfully. Draco wrapped his foot around Harry’s waist and used his heel to spur him on, “Pick up the pace, Potter. Flobberworms fuck faster than you.”
“Thrilling? Overdue? A good time? The first of many?” He offered starting with a teasing lilt that pinched to unsure hope.
“Yeah, but I like touching you, remember? That’s what our friends harass us mercilessly about,” he teased, rolling his eyes. Harry released his amusement for concentration as he tapped his back with easy authority, “Up on your knees, I need to get more of your back.” Draco blushed feverously determined to keep his face turned out of sight as he obeyed Harry’s orders. His cock twitched as his mind unhelpfully tortured him with replays of Harry telling him to get on his knees. Harry worked in silence as Draco measured his breathing, trying to will his boner down although it was a little bit like trying to swim up tide every time Harry’s hands replaced the rag and slid across his bare back. Harry froze and Draco froze with him, worried Harry had picked up on the boner that Draco was fitfully trying to keep hidden under the water and blocked out of sight with where he placed his grip on the tub edge. “Draco,” Harry whispered.
“I hated it. It wasn’t great and all I could think of was that I just wanted to be home with Draco,” Harry admitted with a blush to his cheeks. Hermione gave him a very pointed look and Harry blushed harder, “Okay, I get what you’re hinting at. Just tell me how to get Draco back.” Hermione donned her determined face as she yanked a pen from her bun and pulled her notepad from her extended pockets. She clicked the pen and began brainstorming.
“Well, in that case,” Harry waved his wand, sending the unused ingredients back to the cupboard and vanishing the goop off the table and floor, leaving Draco as the only mess left, “let’s get you into a bath.” Harry was grinning too much for Draco’s liking, making him huff and storm off towards their dorm. Harry snickered behind him, scourgifying the ground in Draco’s goopy wake. Draco thanked all the stars in the sky that they didn’t come across anyone on their trek across the castle. He didn’t know what he did to be so lucky, because he did know all the reasons why karmically there should have been a lineup of students to witness his crime-covered shame.
Harry huffed and flopped his wet noodle boy’s arms, “This! He won’t bloody wake up and help me undress him. Can you please help?”
His grip on Draco tightened as he tried to hold Draco into place as he begged, “No, don’t leave. I’m sorry I froze. I just needed to process that. I don’t want you to leave.” Draco lowered his hips back down but didn’t lean back into Harry, pushing his body against Harry’s arms around his back until Harry dropped them. Draco sat in Harry’s lap with his shoulders curved in on himself, looking down at his hands where he was picking his cuticles. Since he wasn’t returning to the snuggle, Harry pulled his hips closer to Harry’s core to gain back some of the closeness Draco tried to create. Draco’s hands shot out to Harry’s shoulders for balance and Harry took the opportunity to try to catch Draco’s eyes. When he effectively kept his gaze away, Harry brought a hand to Draco’s face, cupping it like before but slipping a thumb under his chin to direct his face. Draco’s eyes flickered over to Harry’s trying not to look but unable to stop himself. However, once their eyes met, they were locked into the depths of their stares. Draco’s stormy eyes were cloudy with fear, wet with sorrow. Harry felt colder so he knew the Luck had finally run out so it was with his special brand of reckless bravery that he asked, “Draco, sweetheart, do you want my help?”
“Me too, love.” Draco picked up speed until the sparks in his balls tightened and his cum shot out over them. So determined to finish Harry, he kept going and whimpering Harry’s name as the sensitivity grew too strong. Harry grunted and came, adding to their mess. Draco dropped his hand into the murky water and leaned his forehead onto Harry’s shoulder. Harry’s finger left his arsehole and trailed up and down his spine as they caught their breath.
Ron choked and slapped the table, “Six months?! You’re joking. You’ve been having enemies with benefits with Malfoy for half a bloody year?”
Draco reared his head back, nearly toppling off Harry if it wasn’t for his quick reflexes, “Excuse me?!”
Harry’s whine interrupted him, “Yes, you are and I know, I’m sorry. I didn’t have anything else that was warm enough to put you in. Why don’t you own any sweaters?” Potter tried to redirect to his fault as if that would distract Draco from actualizing that his poor cashmere cardigan got rubbed, tugged, and stretched all night long!
Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder and smirked, “So, are you going to go get him out of the rain before he gets sick, or is he not your boyfriend?” Harry didn’t honor that with a reply, solely turning on his heel and leaving Ron behind. Well, he tried to leave Ron. The smug arsehole was trotting down the stairs behind him. When they broke into the common area and Harry was marching his way through it, someone asked where Harry was going in such a hurry. Ron took the pleasure of answering, with enough of a sing-song to his voice to almost get Harry to pause his march to turn around and flick him in the ball sack, “Going to get his boyfriend.”
“Uh. Well, we weren’t exclusive or anything and I went on that terrible date with Trenton. At first, when I told Draco, so he knew not to expect me home, he seemed cool. He told me to have a good time. But then the next day when I came over, he was all cold and he said that we should end this because it would never go anywhere. He said it would be absolutely mortifying to be seen in public together and who wants to spend their whole life hidden away in a flat drinking wine and eating takeaway,” Harry gritted out his teeth remembering how his heart fell out of his chest, how lost he felt when Draco shoved a miniature box into his hand and pushed him out of the door locking him out of his wards. The now enlarged box still sat untouched full of all the clothes, knick-knacks, toiletries, and his favorite mug that had wandered over to Draco’s.
“Sitting with you.” Harry shrugged with flippant ease, he was determined to see just how far this Luck could be pushed.
Harry chuckled, “Only if you open your eyes, sweetheart. Let me see those gorgeous greys and I’ll give you all you want.” Draco’s skin tingled under each little encouraging kiss Harry left on his cheeks and neck.
“Wallowing? In the rain? Tad dramatic, ain’t it?” Ron snorted leaning into the bathroom doorframe with his arms crossed. Harry huffed and batted at the hair in his eyes and gave Ron what he hoped he interrupt as ‘This is fucking Malfoy we’re talking about’. Ron laughed; He got the message.
“Yes, well, I’m dramatic. It’s the main facet of my personality,” Draco dismissed, closing his eye and dropping his hand back into the grass. He patted the space beside him in invitation. Harry groaned and laid down in the grass beside Draco. It took all of a second for Harry to feel the damp earth seep up into his sweater and jeans. He was a sponge sucking up dirty groundwater for his melodramatic boyfriend with a terrifying confession to make.
The scrape of the broom callouses on Harry’s hands against Draco’s fair skin covered his body in goosebumps as he shivered with excited anticipation the closer Harry got to Draco’s cock. His hands were so hot compared to the cooler air on his bare skin. A scorching hand found his prick, gliding up and down his shaft spreading precum as he went. Another blistering hand traveled lower, grazing his balls before rubbing around the ring his arsehole. The first stroke was dry but as the finger passed its first rotation, it slickened with the help of a nonverbal wandless charm. Draco’s seen Harry practically shit himself to achieve a wandless nox. But creating lube out of thin air was easy as breathing. It’s amazing what proper motivation could have on a man’s magical skills. Harry’s finger breached his hole and Draco’s toes curled before relaxing with a sigh as Harry moved the finger around. Sensations without sight were quite delectable. He just might have to challenge Harry again in the future. When Harry got two fingers working inside of him, Harry started feeling around for his prostate. He was getting a little rowdy in his search so when he found it, he stroked it hard. Draco gasped, his back arching and his eyes fluttering. He resolutely held them closed even if the lashes couldn’t behave.
Harry chuckled but humored him, closing his eyes and covering them with his hands, “You know we’re both blokes, right? Blokes who have lived in dorms with multiple boys for years now. Blokes who live with each other currently for months now. You don’t have to be prudish around me.”
Harry laughed as he maneuvered Draco’s other wrist to be under his one hand’s grip, “Any other resources I should be prepared for?”
“What are you doing?” He asked as he got closer. The top of Draco’s head was now visible. His perfectly maintained hair had been matted down by the rain, its strands bleeding out into the blades of grass.
“Don’t forget an umbrella charm,” Hermione called out distractedly. Despite being in her own circle of studying hell, Hermione’s foresight advice rang out, something that Harry will never not appreciate. The smattering of giggles throughout the room, however, could fuck right off. Harry happily expressed that by flipping them all off as he stepped out of the portrait hole.
“What I want to know was when were you going to tell us you shagged Malfoy roughly three months ago?” Ron accused folding his arms over his chest.
Harry used his arm around Draco’s waist to bring them into each other closer, rubbing their noses together, “Yeah.” Draco beamed pressing their foreheads together and tangling their legs. All he knew yesterday was everything had changed. All he knew when he woke was the warmth of Harry could expel the chill of the pouring rain.
Ron blinked a couple of times more before a strangled noise came out of his throat, “Oh, I heard you.”
While always pleased to be reminded that Harry did like him, in a friend capacity, of course, he could not contain the pouting grumble of his reply, “No, completely harmless, just a bitch to get off. It can only be spelled off of inorganic materials.” Harry’s eyes twinkled as he dropped the towel into Draco’s hands so he could wipe his hands off and the mirth of the situation returned to his face.
The fingers paused along their path, “We’re playing hooky today. Ron took our homework to turn in. The story is that we don’t feel good from getting caught in the rain last night.”
That wiped the mirth from Ron’s face right quick, “You want me to help you get Draco naked?!” Where was this prude ‘tude coming from? Three bros in a bathroom can’t be worse than months in a tent with your best bro and your crush.
There was nothing like spending your Saturday morning in a potions lab trying to complete a partnered project with the Golden Boy himself who has volunteered to be his personal bodyguard, roommate, class partner, and overall pain in the arse by the way of golden retriever antics spiced up with a mouth that could parry sass and sarcasm against Draco with frustrating ease. Currently, said arse pain was supposed to be returning the first round of ingredients and bringing forth the next, but apparently said task could not be done without a running commentary. Draco rolled his eyes as he measured out Dragon Star seed powder. Precision was key but letting Harry call him a pointy potions prat without the retort remarking on Harry being a dumb speckled git was just unreasonable. He flicked his eyes up, ready to lay out his lovely reprisal when he bore witness Harry bent over digging around in the ingredient cupboard. Those stupid, frankly criminal, grey joggers that he insisted on wearing on the weekend practically no matter what, hugged his arse so damn well. Getting an eyeful, Draco craved to walk up to that arse and slid his hand over one globe and grip, just see how much he could squeeze in one hand. Was it soft like the bottoms suggest or was it tight from the hard work Harry put into his body for
“Well, I’m open to anything. Which would you like to do first?” He teased with a squeeze to Harry’s biceps. Harry plastered his lips to Draco’s. He nipped at Draco’s bottom lip until he opened his mouth to him. They kissed deeply while Harry pushed their clothed cocks against each other. Not rutting, just pressing the idea into each other. Harry backed off, leaving them both panting. Draco’s now swollen lips peeled back into a grin, “Mmm, good choice.”
Hermione pushed her tray away and folded her hands onto the table putting on her serious face, “Well, what is your goal? Do you just want Draco to be your friend again to make raising a baby together manageable? Or do you want Draco back, but as your boyfriend this time?” At Harry’s petrified look, Hermione sighed, “How did you feel when you went on a date with Trenton?”
“Fine,” he punctuated with Draco’s second freed boot flying over Ron’s shoulder and hitting the wall behind him with a thump and flop. If Harry wasn’t respecting Ron’s right to pout, he woulda laughed at the green tint that sickened Ron’s face as he had to peel off Draco’s soggy socks. With a little maneuvering, they got Draco’s trousers over his legs and his arms free of his shirt. Ron tossed the shirt near the boots and other discarded clothing and stalled out staring at Draco’s mostly nude form, “Wow, he’s got as many scars as us.” Prickly defensiveness spread over Harry’s body like a rash.
Unfortunately, that meant Ron didn’t pick up the tone of the room, “Yeah, but our scars are from the bad guys, he was on the bad guys’ side.”
“Harry, honey, do you think that maybe that you both assumed the opposite from your lack of communication?” Harry cocked an eyebrow at Hermione, not understanding what she was getting at, and she sighed. “Where you assumed that you weren’t exclusive and together when you guys didn’t talk about it, maybe he assumed you were? That maybe he thought since you were home with him almost every day, slept by him most nights, that you were dating? That maybe he thought dinner and movies at home were what you did for dates because everyone knows you are a hermit and don’t like going out in public. And maybe when you told him you had a very public date at a nice restaurant and to a magical play in the park that maybe he realized that what he thought was what it was like dating you was actually just you hiding him away? Cuz Malfoy isn’t afraid of the public. Even if he gets turned away at some places or gets sneered at, he still goes out. He has fancy meals with Pansy, goes dancing with Blaise, gets coffee with Greg. Granted, he hadn’t been doing much of that lately and something tells me it was because he was staying
Draco’s chattering teeth echoed down the hall, “Fair enough.” His body shook and jerked around while he tucked his icy face into Harry’s jugular. The temperature shock almost made him choke in surprise. Between the clattering, Draco sighed, “You’re so warm. How are you this warm?” What was that warming charm again? Fosillo, Focillo, FoChillio? Fuck it. Harry paused midway up the first flight of stairs and closed his eyes. He focused all he could on trying to cast a warming charm over Draco without his wand in his hand. His brain hurt by the time Draco’s full-body wracks calmed down to a low vibrate. Ha! Success.
With the same serene slither of the rivets of rain, the thoughts of Draco in the back of his mind were finding themselves closer to the forefront as he wondered why Draco wasn’t there pestering him now. Was he in the library? Harry flicked his eyes to the mountain of checked-out books on Draco’s desk. The simple table would probably topple should Draco dare to strain it with more. For the table’s sake, and future Harry’s when he was inevitably prodded and pouted into helping Draco carry them back to the library, manually of course, because the oldest and heaviest of texts are always too fragile for a levitation charm, he truly hoped Draco wasn’t in the library. But if he wasn’t in the library, where was he? Common room maybe? His wandering hands patted the bed of parchment, books, and quills surrounding him like a sacrificial ceremony to the demon of NEWTs looking for the Marauder’s Map. As his finger’s curled around the folded parchment, he caught up to his Draco-centric mind. With a scolding to make Hermione proud, Harry dropped the Map onto the floor beside his bed and refocused his mind on the task at hand.
“Hey!” Harry shouted dropping his grip on Draco’s hip to lean up to yank Draco’s hand from his face to pin his wrist above his head. “That’s cheating.”
Harry quickly dissolved into matching guffaws, “I think we just made a lot of people richer and others poorer.” Harry bowed his face into Draco’s neck and pressed a kiss to the skin, “God, Draco, that was…” Draco extended his neck soliciting for more neck kisses which he was rewarded. He hummed with happiness as he felt the edges of Harry’s smile in every kiss.
“I did my Transfiguration essay,” Harry replied distracted by reaching over Draco and grabbing his other hand for examination.
Ron pushed off the door frame with his shoulders slumped and flopped his arms down to his sides, “Really, Harry?” He was surrounded by toddlers. The gods saw Harry make a hopefully positive life choice and said, rub his nose in it.
Ron pulled up on Draco’s heel and tugged off the boot with a little bit of unnecessary force, “It’s getting a little annoying that you keep secrets from your best friend for Malfoy.”
Harry chuckled, “Yeah, Draco, I have a thing for you. I wouldn’t have risked getting decked for a kiss just for kicks.” Draco studied Harry’s face, touching his features with shaking but no less reverently as Harry had done to Draco. Harry kept his eyes locked onto Draco, watching him think and decide. Draco pinched his brows together pursing his lips before he held Harry’s face still and leaned in. His tight lips softened as he pressed them into Harry’s. They kissed soft and slow, ignoring the precipice they existed upon.
Draco stuck his tongue out at him even though he couldn’t see it. He quickly stepped out of his pants and slipped into the tub. “Just because I don’t want to strip and climb into a tub right in front of your face doesn’t make me a prude,” he snipped. Draco tried to punctuate it with a pissy huff but as he sank into the perfectly warm water with a thick coating of suds and bubbles on the surface, his huff exhaled into a pleasant sigh.
Harry chucked the heavy wet sweater over his head and it landed on the floor in one giant slop. He sighed with relief to be free of that heavyweight, “Yeah, that’s new. Used to be the lightest sleeper I’ve ever met, and I’ve met me. Last few weeks tho, once he’s out, he’s out for good.”
“Ugh, the ground is cold and I’m getting wet,” Harry whined turning his head to look at Draco to see if his moaning cracked Draco’s statuesque mask.
Draco grinned into Harry’s chest, “What can I tell you, Harry? I’d like to spend my free day in bed. Do you have any other suggestions for what we should do?” Draco dragged his leg up Harry’s pretending to not notice the hardening cock under the layer of flannel pajama bottoms. Draco could feel the salacious grin on Harry’s face as he grabbed Draco’s thigh and pushed it into his cock before rolling them both over. The light behind his eyelids darkened with Harry’s body leaning over him and blocking the sun coming in through the window.
“I do care, there just isn’t anything wrong with him,” Harry tried to press to convince him to drop it.
Harry beamed as Draco nodded stiffly and asked, “What are you going to do for an hour while I get ready?”
Harry picked up the paper and flipped it over to find a staticky grey and black image that flowed and ebbed. He frowned at the picture, “What the hell is this?” Having wandlessly canceled their sticking-charmed bodies, Hermione held out her hand to see it and Harry dutifully passed it over to her. Immediately, she gasped with her eyes widening as she covered her mouth with her free hand. Ron pitched to the side in haste to look over Hermione’s shoulder to see what was in her hands though he looked equally properly confused as Harry. Harry leaned forward with worry, “What is it?”
As soon as the onslaught of rain stopped splattering into his face, Harry plopped down onto the first bench inside with Draco fully in his lap. The wet garments made a slapping squelch against the smooth stone bench and Harry’s arse slid with the slickness. After scrambling for stability, Harry pulled out his wand and expelled the drippy dampness from their clothes. It would take several drying spells to get them fully dry but this way, Harry wouldn’t leave behind a slip hazardous trail. Throwing a featherweight charm on Draco, he stood back up with him in his arms. “Did you just charm me lighter, Potter?” Draco accused pulling an amused snort out of Harry.
Ron followed behind, shutting the bedroom door before joining them in the bathroom, “So what was he doing?”
“All good ones,” Harry murmured. Draco turned his head and met Harry’s brilliant green eyes. He hadn’t placed his glasses back on so Draco got to look into them without the hindrance of the smudgy lens. They were bright with crinkly corners from the happy smile adorning Harry’s beautiful face.
Alas, Draco looked serene as he raised his finger to his lips, “Shush. Atone in silence.” Harry sighed dramatically and turned his head to look up at the rain clouds. The rivets of rain falling around his umbrella charm twisted and twirled in an interesting dance. He wondered what the theory was behind how the rain traveled around a person under an umbrella charm. Hermione probably already knew. The danger of asking her, however, was that she had no control over her drive to consume knowledge. If he asked her and she didn’t know, she’d push herself farther to learn about rain reaction to charms to a deeper level than Harry cared about on top of her mountainous NEWTs studies. He made a mental note to consult Hermione on his inquiry in a couple of months. Maybe three. Give her a break post NEWTs before stringing her out on dusty books again. However, he may not want to wait to ask her about why his umbrella charm seemed to have developed a divot. Pooling right above his head was a pocket of gathering rainwater. Most still trickled and danced around the sides but some drops of rain decided to consort omnisciently overhead.
Harry let out a big huff his eye twitching as he threatened with his teeth clenched, “Draco freaking Malfoy, if you don’t help me out, I’m calling Ron back in here to help me undress you.” And Harry got no response just Draco’s mouth popping open a little leaving tuffs of breath against Harry’s neck. Harry groaned and shifted the lug over so he could tug his wand out of his pocket. He called out a Patronus to send to Ron, “Ron, can you come back?” All of the tension that was in Draco’s body from becoming partially awake leaked out of him and Harry nearly dropped him on the floor. Harry grunted, “Oh for fuck’s sake, Draco.” He didn’t see if the stag took off correctly due to being a little preoccupied gathering up the wet noodle boy.
Harry shrugged his free shoulder and grinned, “Just went for it. Hoped Luck was on my side.” Draco pulled his head back looking at Harry like he grew an extra head.
Draco snorted but let Harry do whatever he was doing, “About time. Only due in the morning.” Harry smirked and brought Draco’s cold fingers to his lips. He kissed the slender digits, peering at his beautiful face. Professors, the public, his friends all asked what he wanted to do post-school. Most, he would tell them whatever he thought they’d want to hear to make them go away. Some he was honest to and admitted that to him his future plans were about as clear as the world was when he lost his glasses. Hermione had suggested he sit in silence and picture what made him happiest, where he’d like to spend his time, what achievements would make him feel the proudest. He had been frustrated time and time again when the only thing he could think of when he thought of happiness was Draco. He wanted to spend his time beside Draco. Bringing a smile to his face and keeping him safe were the kinds of things that made Harry feel accomplished. And Harry felt ridiculous and sappy. A sappy ridiculous bimbo whose boyfriend was all he could think about. But now he could see a clearer picture of his future. The image panned out from just Draco to include their family. His pride would be in caring for them, protecting them, living for them. A career would fall into place one day, but his job now was them. Harry brought his hand to Draco’s chilly cheek and in the pouring rain, his whole life shifted. His future started today, and he had a family to bring in from the rain.
Draco had begun to shiver the moment they breached the indoor warmth, but of course, the prat still noticed that. “Yes, Draco. I’m not carrying you up multiple flights of stairs with you weighing an ounce more than your books.”
But dropping it was not in Ron’s wheelhouse, “Harry, he could be sick or have an eating disorder or…”
Harry chuckled to clear the emotion thickening in his throat, “I suppose you’re right. We can reenact how we created life after dessert.” He smirked as Draco glared at him though the potency was weakened when Harry caught the crinkle of amusement in the corners of his eyes as he spun on his heel and marched into the house not waiting for Harry to follow him. Harry shut the door behind himself and locked it nonverbally as he blissfully watched Draco strut up the stairs. He should send Hermione a gift basket for being so right.
Draco opened one eye at Harry, his hand coming up to block the rain and Draco frowned, “Who said you have any sins in the first place?”
Draco yawned, “Goodnight, Harry,” rubbing his face sleepily into the cotton of Harry’s pj shirt, “You know, I just might.”
“How often were you over there?” Hermione inquired tilting her head and looking at him with a curious gaze.
Harry kissed Draco’s exposed neck from his head resting on Harry’s shoulder and he hummed, “Barmy, maybe, but I prefer the term brave.”
,” Harry begged, throwing out a bottom lip pout and desperate eyes with extreme effort because if you can’t beat them, join them. He knew the second Ron accepted his fate, but he held off his grin until after Ron verbally accepted. Didn’t want to accidentally goad him into changing his mind.
Harry pointed to Draco’s sprawled feet, “Can you get his boots off? I’ll start on his shirt buttons.” Ron flopped down onto the floor and started undoing the laces, his unwillingness displayed with every snap of a loosened lace.
He reached up and palmed Draco’s cheek bringing his face down so their foreheads touched. “Draco,” he whispered, but before he could finish his question, Draco leaned the rest of the way in pressing their lips together for the first time in a month. Merlin’s dusty beard, he missed Draco. Their innocent second first kiss quickly fell apart into a proper snog when Harry couldn’t resist sucking Draco’s bottom lip between his inspiring a whimper from Draco that urged both of them to ravage each other’s mouths in the open doorway to Draco’s flat. They split apart startled when a passing cyclist loudly honked their horn at them. Breathing heavily, he looked to Draco to find him pressing his long slender fingers to his wet, kiss swollen lips, partially hiding a giddy smile that had enhanced the apples of his pink-stained cheeks and crinkled his bright, silver eyes. Harry’s heart missed several beats, thudding off-balanced and painful in his chest as he tried his hardest to commit every detail to memory.
Hermione gave him big, concerned eyes as she cast a muffling charm over the three of them so that the nosy members of the cafeteria couldn’t hear her sigh out, “Oh Harry.” Harry hoped there would come a day that she stopped having to look at him and say his name like that. His shoulders slumped as he waited for her to break whatever news. “This is a sonogram.” A sono-what? Harry’s brows were pinched in confusion. “Honey, Malfoy’s pregnant. And based on his angry determination to tell you, the baby is yours.” Harry’s jaw dropped open and he just stared at her. She placed the sono-whatever back onto the table and turned it to face Harry as she pointed, “This bean shape in the center is a baby. Here’s the head and the body and you can see their little arm as the image moves.” Harry continued to gape at the image, his eyes making sense of the shapes as Hermione identified them. “And over here, the words say “D. Malfoy baby. 10 weeks. How long have you been avoiding him?”
The pattering of rain against the windowpane echoed softly through the dorm room. It muted the noises of people passing by or the cacophonous sounds traveling from the common room. It was the type of ambiance that settled the dust kicked up in an anxious mind. A focusing sort of energy that aided peace required for rest or for finishing that Transfiguration essay with a deadline fast approaching. Harry sat upon his bed, raising his arms, and stretching his spine as far as it went searching for a nearly unreachable, just so close, he only needed to stretch a little farther, pop! Harry sank into a satisfied slump after his spine snapped sweetly. He wiggled and shook out his limbs and hands, releasing that itchy tension of staying in one place for too long. Sated with freshly limbered limbs, Harry dove back into his work. A little prayer to the rain gods to keep pouring couldn’t hurt and just maybe he’d get this essay done before Draco returned to pester him. As if Harry wasn’t hoping to be pestered by Draco tonight.
Draco swallowed and cleared his throat, he had to start somewhere. “Um. Well, did I tell you yesterday?” He tiptoed with vagueness to soften the blow if he hadn’t told him last night. He was pretty sure he did. Like 90% sure. The number steadily decreased as his brain tried supplying him with a perplexing idea that he was swaddled and held by the Weasel at some point last night. Harry’s warm hand slid across Draco’s bare stomach, pausing at the base of it and he stretched his fingers outwards covering as much of the flat surface as he could. Draco sucked in a stilted breath.
“You’ve got natural talent, Harry. You should go into hairdressing. Be the Boy Who Lived to Wash Hair.” Draco mumbled with a grin pushing his head into Harry’s hands. Harry laughed inspiring Draco’s grin to grow wider.
“Is that why both of you have been in a dreadful mood lately?” Ron pushed. Harry nodded and pushed his tray of food over to the side. The smell directly under his nose was making him nauseous.
“Why don’t you?” Ron challenged as he lowered Draco’s feet into the tub first. Harry gaped at Ron. Where was this coming from? While Harry was glad Ron didn’t seem to still hate Draco, this was more steps forward than Harry expected.
“Room of Requirement. We need our beauty sleep, and I don’t think it’d be wise for one of us to sneak into the other one’s dorms so, hopefully, Hogwarts is feeling accommodating,” Harry mused. The Room of Requirement has helped Harry out in the past but he’s never gone to it for something like this and he truly wondered if the sentient room had purity opinions that would block them from use tonight. Draco twisted his hand in Harry’s to entwine their fingers and confidently followed beside Harry since he probably knew where Harry was headed. Watching the door form, Harry flashed Draco a satisfied smile, grateful the Hogwarts wasn’t a prude. They stepped into the room, smaller than he has ever seen it, but cozy with a plush bed beside a roaring fireplace, two pairs of pajamas on the bed, and two glasses of water on the nightstand. “Perfect, I’m wiped.” Harry pulled Draco into the room and closed the door behind them. He quickly began to shed his clothes for one set of pajamas, letting his layers drop to the floor without preamble. Draco seemed frozen watching Harry strip to his pants and redress into pajamas in front of him. Harry smirked at Draco, pleased beyond belief to have short-circuited him even if it was from accidental obliviousness, “Sweetheart, I know my ass is delightful but you’re gonna have to snap out of it if you want to change.” Draco shook his head out, blushing profusely as he bowed his head to work on his shirt buttons. Harry debated on teasing him further like oogle him as he changed but he decided to take pity on the stressed-out boy and crawled into bed, fluffing pillows and setting alarms. He didn’t look up until Draco was nervously crawling into bed beside him. Harry laid back on the pillows and opened his arms in invitation which was all Draco needed to clamber in and sag into Harry’s chest. His octopus arms wrapped around Harry’s waist and squeezed tightly. With all of the budding love and hopeful warmth, Harry squeezed him back and kissed the top of his head, “Goodnight, Draco. Sleep well.”
“Your thoughts?” He whispered back. The muted space between them felt heavy but he appreciated how it held him down and kept him sedated from working himself up into a panic.
Harry straightened himself batting back the curl that had fallen forward into his face, “I’m taking you out on a date. A proper public date to a really nice restaurant. I even used my name to get us a last-minute reservation which means there will probably be reporters there.” Draco frowned and crossed his arms, but he didn’t try closing the door again even though Harry’s foot was no longer in the way, so Harry took it as progress.
Draco hummed and smirked, “Make me.” Harry might have scoffed but the wandering hands over his body and renewed kisses upon his lips, jaw, and neck declared that Harry happily took up the challenge. Blindly, his hands found Harry’s head scritching his nails through his hair and rubbing down his back when he was close enough. Harry pulled back to fumble the buttons of Draco’s top. Those buttons Harry was popping open seemed bigger than his normal sleep shirts. What was he wearing? His brow furrowed as he felt his top. Was this his cashmere cardigan? “Harry, am I…”
Draco sniffed and wiped aggressively at his eyes with the back of his hand and cleared his throat, “What time is the reservation?”
Harry apparated to Draco’s doorstep in his finest robes fiddling with the miniaturized box of his belongings that belong at Draco’s. A bit presumptuous but he was determined to succeed. He had debated showing up in Mr. Darcy's attire but the only way he could have found any sort of replica in this short of notice would have been at a costume shop which would not have been good enough. He can just imagine how disgruntled Draco would have been at the sight of polyester instead of the proper wool and cotton. So instead of wearing an improper get-up, he wore his deep green velvet robes with the black lapels that Draco had picked out for him. And he stopped off at Hermione and Ron’s place for her to get his bird’s nest into perfect messy curls. Hopefully, Draco’s curiosity for why he was dressed so spectacularly would help Harry get his foot in the door.  He took a deep breath and rapped the silver snake doorknocker. It only took a moment for the charcoal door to be unlocked and propped open enough for Draco’s grumpy face to peer out and identify the intruder. Draco frowned deeper and went to slam the door, but Harry jammed his foot in the opened space, wincing as the hard metal pinched his foot tightly against the doorframe. “Bugger off, Potter,” Draco sneered and kicked at Harry’s foot to push it out.
The individual bathrooms in the eighth-year dorms were without a bathtub which was unfortunate for Draco’s need for soaking. While Draco had planned on just taking the longest shower imaginable, Harry transfigured a mug into a full tub in the middle of their now, very cramped bathroom. He filled it with water and bubbles while Draco grumbled and grunted off his goopy layers of clothes. He was down to his pants when he looked up to find Harry pulling a stool into the room and sitting down beside the tub. Draco furrowed his brows and placed his fists on his hips, “What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”
Harry scoffed, “You just did!” Not to point out his chest where the rain turned his shirt into a sheer impression of one which allowed the slash scarring, turned grey from the cold, to show through it. A big glaring proof that Harry had sins to lose.
Draco sighed again as Harry ran a comb over his hair, “Have you ever tried your grandfather’s hair potion?”
Ron frowned and held the door with one foot, leaning as far forward as he could to look at Draco while keeping it open, “He okay?”
Harry dropped the button and held onto Draco against Ron’s tugs. He gave Ron big, believe me, eyes and implored, “Trust me, I’ll tell you all about it one day. The four of us will all sit down and discuss why he was wallowing, but I can’t tell you right now while he’s unconscious and half flopped on the bathroom floor.”
“Well, Princess, we’re wizards and that sounds like a lot of unnecessary work.” Harry shifted his grip to hold Draco tighter, the vibration of his body kept loosening his grip, “And hanging onto you while you shiver this hard is enough of a struggle.”
“Worth it to see you this worked up, babe,” Harry assured in a husky voice that rumbled in his ear as Harry trailed his tongue down the shell to suck on the earlobe. Bastard knew what he was doing. Draco tried to squirm. He arched and wiggled and tried to press Harry down against his cock with his heel but Harry wasn’t budging more than what he controlled. Draco was hot all over despite not moving much to work up a sweat. But he was determined. Life may have taken him down a peg or three but he was still Draco Fucking Malfoy and Potter wasn’t going to win this. Harry tangled their tongues before he slowly began trailing down Draco's neck. His hot mouth suckled and nibbled on Draco’s collar bone like it was a treat he carried around on him specifically for Harry to enjoy. And boy did he enjoy it thoroughly before he traveled on down Draco’s sternum. Each kiss caused Harry to shift his whole body down dragging his cock slowly out of Draco. His hands twitched where they were still pinned above his head just begging to latch onto Harry’s hair and drag him back. If only he could tangle his fingers into those unruly locks, then he was sure he could command Harry to fuck him good. Harry paused right above him, his breath ghosting over Draco’s chest tickling him and making him pant with the need of contact. Draco's senses burned. He knew that Harry was giving him that smug “I won” smile. That fucker was wrong. He had not won. He could do this forever. Get fucked so painfully slow that no one was satisfied? Sure. No biggie for his pride. Potter had not won.
“He was a dispensable pawn of the bad guy, plus the good guys leave scars too,” Harry’s voice hardened as he frowned, forcing himself not to look at the Sectumsempra scars.
“Well, when you put it that way,” Harry laughed, amazed at himself that he dared to push Luck so far. His grin only grew wider the longer Draco stayed in his lap with his body settling into Harry even if his mind was still wrapping itself around Harry’s bold choices.
Frustration still under his skin like the beginnings of a brush fire wasn’t enough to keep the grin at bay, “No sense in denying it now.”
Ron grimaced, “You want me to hold your naked boyfriend?” One moment, unable to stop oogling, next moment, too squeamish to hold him. Ron made no sense.
“Are you sure cuz I’m pretty sure I caught him vomiting the other day and like he’s super skinny and you said he’s sleep has changed? Those are signs, mate.” Harry sat down into the water grimacing at having to continue being wet when all he wanted was to be warm and dry. Heavy emphasis on the
The rain was guiding his hair back into his eyes and he shoved it back semi-fruitlessly, “And you’re sure?”
Harry flushed immediately hiding his face in his hands. His voice was muffled by his hands as he pitifully admitted, “It wasn’t just once three months ago. I was regularly hooking up with Draco for about six months, but it ended suddenly about a month ago.”
“Can you imagine it? Me going up to McGonagall and telling her, “Professor, I’ve found my calling. My next contribution to the Wizarding World is really good hair washes,” Harry snorted clearly thinking about saying it to her face just to see it in person. Draco hoped that if he did pull off trying to convince the Headmistress of such an unexpected profession that he would share the memory with him.
Harry snorted and rolled his eyes with a grin, “My boyfriend, a sassy git.” Draco froze. Did he really want him as a boyfriend? Could they do that? Can he have that? Harry gave his hips a gentle squeeze and sway, “Hey, is that okay if I call you my boyfriend? I’m not really looking to be anything less if you feel the same way about me as I feel about you and I think you do?” Draco swallowed with big eyes and summoned the same bravery as earlier to nodded furiously and cover Harry’s face with simple kisses. Harry laughed fully, letting himself be engulfed in kisses as he spun their bodies around so he could reach for the shower nozzle, drenching them once more.
Draco popped his eyes open, giving Harry an eyeful of brilliant silver eyes that narrowed into a glare as he bitched, “I’m not dramatic and you’re blocking my atonement.” Harry rolled his eyes and stepped back from Draco tempted to roll his eyes again when Draco’s closed to block from the onslaught of raindrops while he raised his chin into it.
Draco cleared his throat and dropped his hand though he couldn’t quite lose the grin, “I best be getting ready now, I suppose.”
Harry clutched him tight and steadied them on his feet giving him a teasing grin, “Shush, sweetheart, it’s after curfew. You don’t want to alert anyone that we’re here.”
Ron casted a drying spell on his clothes where they had gotten wet and clapped Harry on the shoulder. The big mirthful grin told Harry all he needed to know about Ron’s resolving thoughts, “I hope this means I get to be a godfather.”
Harry practically threw his body over Draco’s and glared up at Ron with a gruff huff, “Ron, two things. What would Hermione say to you if she heard you ask that question? And stop commenting on my boyfriend’s body!” The ruddy bloom to Ron’s cheeks that matched his mop of hair made Harry feel so much better.
“Easy. Sit and watch you get ready. I’ve missed you like crazy, love. Don’t really want to go far from you. Plus, I brought my things that need to be put back where they belong.”
“Well I guess, get on with it,” Draco sighed snuggling in tighter as if eliminating the nonexistent space between their bodies would protect them from whatever Harry was going to say.
Harry cleared his throat, “Never crossed my mind. To be honest, I was trying to figure out how to ask you
“You saw nothing,” he sniffed turning his head away and pretending he wasn’t affected by the gentle petting of his prostate. The quiver of his legs gave him away, but he was ignoring that too.
Harry was still wandering around with his Luck tingling his blood when he noticed the blond git crumpled up in an archway ledge. He jostled his head back and forth trying to remember if Hermione had told him how long the Luck would last and if he had enough left. He shrugged, probably plenty. There was certainly plenty of curiosity to risk it.
“Because Hermione has this theory that I’m the biggest dolt in the universe. She says that while I assumed that since we didn’t say otherwise, you and I were not exclusive nor even dating but you likely assumed the opposite since we slept beside each other most nights of the week and that’s not really something you do with your best buddy even if you’re getting some with your best buddy.” Draco’s glare was getting more violent, and Harry steeled himself for having to slam his body into the door to keep it open. “She said that you saw our takeaway and movie nights as hermit dates and I didn’t at all so then when I did go on that date, that public date, you thought I was hiding you away or ashamed to be seen with you.” Draco’s jaw clicked as he turned his head away, looking up to the sky to fight against the shine Harry could see building up. “That’s not true at all, Draco. I’m not ashamed of you, I just didn’t know we were dating.”
“Draco? You good?” Harry asked, the airy drop off in Draco’s speech burrowed into his chest on the back of a worry bug. When he didn’t answer, Harry shook him gently.
And the brush fire crackled back to life and Harry snapped, “Oh, for fuck’s sake Ron, he’s pregnant.” With a premature release, Ron dropped Draco the rest of the way into the tub. The water line bobbing and crashing over the edge with a little push of water. Draco didn’t seem to care, his head lolling over to lean against Harry’s neck. Harry, however, was just as stunned by his own slip-up as Ron appeared. Draco was going to kill him. He just ruined his living streak. Survived Voldyfarts many times but died by his own big mouth. Ron continued to gape the two of them, those slow blinks moving faster than the cogs turning in his mind behind the blank look in his eyes. Harry panicked, “Shit. Shit. Shit. Don’t tell anyone. I know it’ll suck keeping it from Hermione, but please try. I’ll convince him that we should tell her when he’s awake, but I fucked up. You weren’t supposed to know either until I had talked to him.” Ron continued to look struck by lightning. “Ron, please say something, or do anything so I know you at least heard me?”
“Right,” Harry squeaked. Draco leaned up higher on his knees, bending forward just enough to give Harry full access. Draco couldn’t tell if he imagined it but Harry might have whimpered as he presented himself. He felt goosebumps raise over his skin when the pad of Harry’s finger trailed down his bony spine to right where his cheeks parted. Draco bit his lip to keep from whimpering himself. Harry took the soap to his skin, petting the skin with the towel instead of scrubbing as he had with the rest of his back. Draco prayed his panting wasn’t evident when Harry’s left hand slid down his back and parted his arse cheeks, making Draco’s arsehole completely exposed. Harry’s thumb ghosted over the area, definitely not enough pressure to clean. Draco’s eyes closed, all the blood so effectively residing in his prick that he felt dizzy. His hands gripped the sides of the tub with fevered strength, his knuckles whitening as Harry squeezed the rag over his lower back, sending little rivers down his crack. Harry pressed against the skin above his arsehole a little harder and Draco definitely panted audibly which he took as a partial win over the whine that wanted to squeal out of his throat. He fought himself against pushing back into Harry’s hand to his arsehole that couldn’t help but flex under the attention. After one more pass of trickling water and a ghost of a touch to the puckered hole, Harry’s voice cracked, “All clean.”
“Honestly, I don’t know where to start. Would you be willing to tell me about what happened this summer for you?” Draco stiffened in his arms and Harry almost immediately regretted asking. Maybe not ruining the moment was more important than this conversation.
Draco laughed a little as he wiped away more falling tears, “I guess we can’t call you the biggest dolt then…” he trailed off with a small smile on his face though he was still refusing to look back up.
“Why didn’t it end?” Hermione asked gently placing her hand on his arm to pull his hand away from his face.
Draco chuckled wetly as he looked down to the ground, his shoulders hunching inward as if he was trying to tuck inside himself, and muttered, “Figures. Of course, they meant nothing to you.”
“About the baby?” Harry whispered. Draco nodded staring up at the ceiling. Harry petted his stomach with small strokes of his thumb, “Yeah, you told me.”
hung so heavily in the air that for a brief second Harry contemplated making him walk. But Draco’s face held a bluish tint now evident in the light and the way he shivered meant Harry was definitely going to carry him. That did not mean he had to make it harder on himself. Harry sneered back almost missing the way that Draco’s lips quirked upwards with a tiny little flicker as he returned to his path up to their room.
being quiet. You’re the one who broke the silence,” Harry gestured wildly with finger-pointing and everything, “Can we go inside now? I’m cold, you’re c…”
“You’re doing what?” Draco squawked and released his grip on the door which made it swing open and Harry pitch forward without the countering weight. Harry stumbled but thankfully caught himself before he face-planted and broke his nose. He did not want to get blood on these robes.
“Ron,” Harry tried to interrupt but Ron continued as he gently lowered Draco all the way into the water, not caring that he was getting his sleeves wet. Or not noticing in his tirade. Either way, his sleeves were getting soggy.
Harry cupped Draco’s chin again and tilted his head back up to rise his hair again, as he explained, “My hair can only be cut so much because it grows back almost immediately. It’s got a mind of its own. Hermione actually cut my hair while we were on the run and she had to use impediment charms to keep it in place until she was finished. She was far more successful than anyone has ever been in the past.” Harry finished his hair off running his conditioner through the strains.
Draco grinned and crinkled his nose still keeping his eyes pinned closed, “It’s called using my available resources to help me win.”
Draco shook his head in Harry’s neck, “Nope, just barmy.” Harry chuckled, squeezing Draco when he felt Draco’s lips split into a grin against his skin. Pleased silence fell over them as Draco remained comfortably slumped against Harry’s chest. Harry trailed his hand up and down Draco’s back careful not to rub over the bony spine of his too-thin frame. Harry knew they needed to talk about so much like the Death Eater thing, the kissing thing, and the intersection of those topics. Snuggling Draco after curfew was a secret fantasy come true which he didn’t want to ever end but he also knew that the Liquid Luck would be fading soon, and he seriously doubted their communication skills without a little Luck on his side. His body must have tensed because Draco groaned, “You’re about to ruin the moment, aren’t you?”
Draco discarded his smugness for pouting, “No! I can’t! I have a confession to make and I haven’t figured out how to tell you yet and I won’t be coming in until I do. So, either leave me here or join me.” Harry’s heart rate spiked, always on hand to jump to the worst possibilities at a moments notice. What could Draco possibly confess that warranted a penance through nature’s baptismal? He hadn’t committed a crime or even insulted anyone’s blood status since the end of the war. So, what did he do? There was no way he’d be able to leave Draco here to get hypothermia and die leaving Harry without answers.
Harry sighed a breath of relief, “Yeah, Draco. I will.” To seal the promise, he pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s neck.
The kicking stopped but Draco continued to hold the door closed on his foot as he glared at Harry through the crack and demanded, “Why are you dressed so formally? Groveling doesn’t typically have a dress code Potter.”
Finally, Draco pulled back to whisper against Harry’s mouth, “Okay. I’ll trust you. But you better not leave me tonight. I’m going to need reminding that this is real and that I should trust you.” Harry grinned swinging his feet around to hang off the other edge of the window ledge. He braced Draco in his arms and jumped off. He did this all in one fluid movement, giving Draco no chance to think of any other response but to hold onto Harry tightly and screech, “Potter!”
He hiked Draco up once more in his arms, holding him out, “Okay, now you hold him while I get undressed.”
Draco yawned and stretched like a cat, his head and shoulders bowing but his legs stretching out as long and straight as they’d go. “Excellent,” Draco sighed out as he released his stretch, “A day in bed.” He snuggled again into Harry.
