Potter rolled him up onto his side and started on his back, lingering on his abused bottom, rubbing him clean, bringing back a heated tingle that went straight to his cock. Not that he was wanting to bring things round to that subject again or anything—
"I’m terrible at communication. That was always Hermione’s role. If she were here, I bet I wouldn’t be doing half so badly."
"You heard Charlie," Potter said, taking hold of Draco’s hips. "You can take me and you will. Cry all you want but you’ll take my whole cock with one thrust."
Charlie felt a pang. He loved it when Draco played the petulant aristocrat. It made his hand itch and his cock swell and it invariably ended with that lovely bare arse over Charlie’s knee. Followed by a nice sound fuck. He’d miss that.
"The other side? You mean your side?"
"Does Malfoy," Potter’s voice was definitely heading into husky need territory here, "er, like paddling, then? And whipping, and, er, things like that?"
Draco didn’t rush into an answer. He thought it over carefully. "Could I get that howler
Charlie nodded. Good answer. "By the way, I’d insist on a right of first refusal if you planned to sell to anyone else. There’s a responsibility there that keeps going on." He let Draco do his marvelous tongue-flick to the slit, followed by a twisting suck. His balls tightened with pleasure.
, calling the contract in from the drawer where it was stored. He snatched it from the air, stuck his glasses back on, and quietly, not waking anyone, began to read.
Draco’s face burned. He understood doing that for Charlie but for Potter too? His attention was focused on Charlie finding and picking up the cane, though—he had no time to protest before Potter was back in front of him. Not that he would have protested, not when Charlie was heading towards his arse with a cane in his hand. He wasn’t stupid.
. The vanilla het sex ones had been Tom Riddle’s. It was almost enough for him to want the psychotic bastard back.
an absolute champ at taking it up the arse. Aren’t you pet?" he said as his hand twisted ever more cruelly. "Those things aren’t mutually exclusive."
"You play Quidditch what, once a week?" Charlie pointed at Draco. "Him you’ll ride every night. Whatever you want, when you want it. What’s that worth?"
"I want something more from you." Harry stood up and unzipped his jeans, pushing them down along with his pants. "Sorry, but you’re just too delicious with that soap-coated mouth. I keep thinking how smooth it’ll feel—"
"Why would you think that?" Harry wanted to raise a hand to Malfoy’s face, stroke fingers across his cheek. He couldn’t, not here in public, or at least not yet, but oh he wanted it.
Charlie’s toes curled in the anticipation of making a truly epic sale. "Sorry, Harry," he said without an ounce of shame, "but I really need to get to bed. Got to toss you out now—"
Harry kicked Draco’s legs a little farther apart, relishing the tiny extra fraction he could sink in. Then he rubbed a soothing hand on Draco’s lower back. "You’re pleasing me already. There’s nothing you can do so stop trying to control things. You’re not getting a ring and I think you know what I’m going to do."
He’d barely gotten his mouth open to start apologizing, explaining, all those things that civilized people did, before Malfoy had rolled over and was practically spitting in his face.
"The opposite of hate? What are you attempting here, Potter, emotional connection via antonym?" Still, Draco’s rigidity edged into a different kind of stiffness.
"I know you’d planned to go—I saw your
Potter held his cock out, a little tentatively, not to mention a little too far away. The prat. How long did he think Draco’s tongue was anyway? He stuck it out as far as he could—see how cooperative he was being, Charlie?—and waited for Potter to get the idea. As in, come a little closer, moron boy.
"Fine. Do what you want." Draco turned his back. "Talk yourself blue in the face. Say whatever you need to make yourself feel better. Wasn’t that always your way? Show your teeth then pretend you were just smiling so you didn’t have to face the fact you were every bit as dangerous as the other side?"
Harry laughed hard. Draco shot him as dirty a glance as he dared.
A hand lifted his face, gripping his chin to keep it up. Green irises, each a thin bright ring around pupils black and dilated, drank him in--concerned and avid in equal measures.
Draco’s back stiffened to rigidity. "So there it is. The reason you felt justified in slipping me a hate fuck right under Charlie’s watchful eye. Can you excuse deceiving him like that too? Or did you think he was like that as well, that it was all your typical Gryffindor bully-fest and why shouldn’t you join in?"
Draco snorted. "I think three in the bed is quite enough."
Charlie put his beer down, came over and casually grabbed Draco’s hair. "Yes, he’s a slave. My slave."  He roughly yanked Draco’s head up to meet Potter’s eyes. "You’ll have plenty of time to see how much he likes it. Don’t worry about that."
Charlie grimaced. "Wait, sorry, forgot to tell you to release him from position first. He’s not allowed to move until you give him the signal."
Draco gave him his best you-are-a-lower-life-form stare. "A thing? How interesting. Is that how the common people spend their time these days. At
Draco tossed his head but kept his mouth shut. It was obvious why this was his kink. It was a standard tenet of psychology, no less, so there was no reason for him to feel embarrassed. The things you fear most are often eroticized, made conquerable by desire—all the textbooks he’d read trying to understand himself had said so.
Charlie grinned. "Could throw in some gillyweed if you like. There’s a supplier in Romania who gets it for me at cost."
Harry met his eyes. "I’d insist on that anyway. I don’t want to sneak around. Draco would be my properly acknowledged boy-friend."
Crap, he couldn’t see it—Potter’s tongue was relentless, and Merlin, it was fantastic, but he couldn’t see past their twisting tongues to get a look at the goods on offer. Potter’s hand was stuffed down his pants, though, Draco could see that. He was wanking fast and hard, grunting with pleasure with every pained moan Draco made.
Harry groaned to himself. "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. It wasn’t a hate fuck at all. That’s what I need to tell you more than anything. I don’t hate you. Er," he held his breath, "it’s the opposite if anything."
Draco’s face was agonized and Charlie could almost taste the moment when his control broke. He didn’t even bother to ask permission. He knew he’d never get it. He knew he was meant to be pushed over the edge no matter how hard he tried.
Harry palmed his cock, stroking it idly while watching Draco suck. "I’m fine with it. I’d like it, actually, if he was mine. It was more the knowing that he wasn’t mine, that I might never have him again, that made me want to drag him off and tie him up and keep him."
A warm feeling went through Charlie, along with the increasing feeling that this was the right thing to do for Draco. "Good to see you’ve thought about that too." He chucked Draco under the chin. "Well, what do you think about that, pet? Could you handle it?"
He pulled off, savoring the whimper. "What will you give me if I stop?"
"It wasn’t to my liking?" Harry’s breath sucked in. "That’s not. No. That’s not how I felt."
She’d had green eyes too, come to think of it. Funny how that came to mind right now, when Potter was so assiduously washing Charlie’s spunk off Draco’s chin. After that, Potter rubbed him down, arm by arm, then down his chest and legs, but not touching his aching cock, because he was just that kind of irritating sod. Potter had added some kind of cleansing charm too and it skimmed over Draco’s body, licking at his skin, making him feel sensitive and burnished like some fine antique.
"Good then. We’ll save the fucking for later, with Charlie, but I needed a truthful answer to that while we were alone." Potter leaned forward and pressed a little kiss on Draco’s mouth—shockingly innocent, startlingly hot—and smartly tapped him on the shoulder.
He could feel himself giving over to Harry’s curious touch. Submitting, letting him have his way, taking whatever sensation Harry wanted him to have.  His cock throbbed and he could feel it bobbing in empty air, desperate for a touch, even a cruel one.
"First you’re mad because you don’t get to come, now you’re whinging because you do?" Harry fucked back in with a brutal stroke. "Really, Draco, will nothing ever please you?"
"Hmmm?" Harry asked, leaning forward, not yet turning the water on him.
Charlie waited ‘til Harry shoved in. He named a price halfway in-between, raising his voice over Draco’s lovely wail. "You can make the difference back easy enough if you like. Rent him out a bit. The twins are the very devil on him but they pay well for the pleasure."
There was a pause—and probably a blush—then Potter said, "I’m big. Are you sure?"
Charlie wasn’t much for fancy flats but this was his indulgence. He needed more than just a little shower after all. He needed space to--as Draco oh so wished he hadn’t let slip—hose his slave down. It was a dragon tamer thing, he supposed. Teach a man to clean things with a powered nozzle and he just couldn’t resist applying it to everything.
"I’m going to come." Draco dropped his head and panted. "Please, Harry, just get me a cock ring. I need it."
A little warmth crept into Draco’s belly, easing the fear. Potter thought he was competent and in control. Which he was—he was a damn good barrister. At least something good had come out of all of Father’s trouble with the law. Draco’d spent plenty of time in chambers before he ever even graduated.
Then he walked away.
"Oh that’s easy. Fuck with his dignity and fuck his arse and you’ll meet ninety-nine percent of this sweetie’s needs." Charlie laughed even as Draco’s face burned hot. "As for finding out what a slave really wants, I’ve found it’s best to be absolutely sure. I use Veritaserum."
He turned to see Remus standing together with Tonks. Of course, Remus had a particular interest in the well-being of creatures often classified as Dark.
"You have nothing to complain about tonight, Potter." Draco dropped the file onto his desk with a hand that might have turned unsteady. "All this one needs is your signature."
Harry rubbed his palms on his robes and opened a mouth that looked like it had gone dry. "Thank you for inviting me. I wanted. Er, I want. Yeah, I mean…"
Charlie shrugged. "It’s not illegal, not if the subject is consenting. A bit pricey, but worth it if you’re going to do something as intense as taking a slave. I wouldn’t use it for a casual sub-type situation, but the responsibility is so much greater when you own." He pushed his cock down, offering it to Draco’s mouth. "They want to please you, you know? That makes it hard for them to tell you the truth about what they really need if they think you won’t like it."
He turned the water to cold, willing his prick down. Merlin forbid he come before he even got over there. He was
A finger ran down his crack, dipping into his hole in passing, making a spark run up his spine. It wasn’t as broad or as work-roughened as Charlie’s—had to be Potter’s. It came back and flicked his arsehole, pushed in and gave a little wiggle. Draco licked his lips but held absolutely still. He wanted more of that flaring pleasure but he hated to admit it. The hand pulled away and Draco refused to look back, to give Potter the satisfaction of knowing just how badly he wanted to get fucked.
"Thought it was pretty comprehensive." Charlie stroked himself, raising an eyebrow in interest. "You got some odd fetish? Grindylow groping? Hand jobs by Hagrid? What?"
Well, he guessed he’d measure it out the other way. Inch by inch as it reamed his arse. Hands pulled his arsecheeks even farther apart as Charlie appeared to be giving Potter a guided tour of the Malfoy bum.
He clutched the block, gripping it with thighs and arms, molding himself to it. Charlie was striping down the outside of his legs now. The skin was tougher there but the blows were all the harder for it, not diminishing the slightest. A low continuous moan was coming from his mouth now and he couldn’t stop it. It didn’t help that with each blow his cock slipped through that damn oil of Potter’s, forcing a pleasure that peaked just as his bollocks screamed from the stretch. He started panting and still the blows kept coming.
"Oi, what about me?" said George, now on his other side. "I made it too. Great speech by the way. Nice and short."
Potter stiffened. A cruel twisting thrust, using every inch of Draco’s hole then Potter went tense. A long, pained moan came and then he grunted hard and spurted. Draco could feel the come filling his arse, lubing Potter’s cock as he rode his climax out, turning those last few strokes slippery and wet. Potter panted his way through all of them, jerking and shuddering, clutching Draco’s hips as if he’d never let him go.
"You know," Charlie said as he hauled the two of them in front of him and saw what they had on. "Many people would consider it in poor taste to wear dragonhide to a benefit like this."
Charlie’s hand moved and Potter must have stepped up behind him because all of a sudden he felt cold lube smeared on his arsehole. A stingy little dollop. Then there was pressure on his arsehole, steadily increasing, and he sucked in an excited gasp—
Then Voldemort was dead, along with the ugly little soul-baby he’d wedged in Harry’s head. And one-half of Harry’s fantasies were gone, just like that. The girl ones.  Oh God. That had been a horrible realization. The kinky-as-fuck queer sex slave fantasies were
Draco whimpered—a wretched sound he’d often wished he couldn’t make—but his tongue was already moving before he could try to stop it. There was a white front part of the shoe, rubbery in texture, and he turned his head and laid his tongue flat on it, like it was ice cream just waiting for a lick.
Charlie’s hand lifted off his back and strong hands hauled him back up onto his knees. "See how much more fun the feisty ones are? They’re a little more intimidating to the inexperienced dom, I’ll give you that—this one’ll keep you on your toes all right—but if I wanted a dog, I’d buy one."
He ignored that, because yes, maybe it was that bad. Or that good, if his cock was the one who got to answer. It certainly seemed to approve of this turn of events. Anyway, fine, he’d done it. He waited, impatience growing. Did the idiot boy forget he had to tell Draco when to stop?
Draco scrambled onto the table like the good boy he was. His hair was tousled and his mouth swollen. He looked utterly, thoroughly fuckable.
Draco shuddered. His cock was harder than ever, twitching in the oil. He was scared, actually scared of this fucking, but he also wanted it so much he could scream. A whimper escaped him and he wasn’t sure what it was for—did he want that thick cock out or did he want to have it rammed in again and again until Potter yelled with release?
While Draco obediently worked, mouth stuffed full of silk, Harry turned the water on and let it run down Draco’s back. The thin silk was almost transparent when wet, outlining the fine muscles underneath. He dripped some soap on, let it foam, then gradually, teasingly, pulled the silk out of Draco’s arse. Draco groaned and a quick look to the front showed that his poor cock was stirring again.
Harry, who was kicked back on the sofa, looking utterly comfortable, grinned. "Look at him. He’s still hard and dripping, just like he was the whole way through. Better be careful he doesn’t run off with your detergent—I think he’s got a taste for it now."
with desire—and snicked it closed around Malfoy’s neck with a practiced hand. A thin silver chain at once snaked out from the bedpost and attached itself to the collar’s ring. Charlie touched the chain, spoke a word, then turned back to Harry with a smile.
There was a certain wariness in Potter’s shoulders which was interesting too, he decided as he watched Potter write. The Chosen One couldn’t possibly have a dirty secret, could he?
The floo crackled. Harry stepped out, shaking off soot, but Charlie’s eyes were fixed on Draco, watching his reaction. Stiffened spine, crackle of magic, forward lean as if Harry exerted a magnetic pull—
Draco nodded. An almost dreamy look was on his face, like he was far away and somewhere very good. He put his arms behind his back without being told, forearms crossed and high, out of the way of a thorough washing.
With a heavy sigh, the blond shook his head before running a hand trough his hair as he looked a bit up towards the sky, as if to hold tears.
Harry sobbed, holding his weight on his trembling arms, eyes closed and face down. His body was shaking for he was now crying heavily. He then felt a hand on his chin, and his dad raised it to make him look at him. Face his stare. Disappointed eyes burning the boy. And then, ashes in the wind.
Harry kept yelling still unable to find control, his green eyes covered in tears that threatens to fall on his cheeks. Stubborn, unable to think straight. Almost panicking. His breathing was hectic.
He concluded, leaving the Gryffindor suddenly confused. The blond brushed a hand once more trough his hair and sighed. Their eyes met again and the Slytherin seemed to read astonishment on Harry's face.
With a way to gentle touch, the blond ended up taking his hand when he was done, trying to relax it to make the black haired boy let go of him. A soft pressure that made Harry take a step back, started by this light touch.
Her voice was firm but strangled by a knot in her throat. She couldn't bare it, they had always been a trio and they had faced everything together, been trough so many things, so much darkness and so much joy. She needed both of them in her life, and both of them together. Their bond was supposed to be unbreakable. And she was determined to fix it. It was glowing in her eyes and Harry sighed at that sight.
It was Malfoy's last card. The last attempt he could make and he hoped it was enough the clear him from the suspicion.
Malfoy shouted, almost playful again. And Harry couldn't help but smirk, finding it funny how the blond seemed to care for him to be on time.
He mourned and begged.
The Slytherin asked frowning, obviously not convinced by the effect a muggle thing could have. Surely, a potion would be more effective to provide relaxation. Which made him curious as to why Harry chose the muggle way instead.
James just murmured on the same cold tone, he sounded lifeless, empty. It felt cruel.
He just said in a breath, a bit sad, as if he had just been ripped of all hope. To him, the exposed lack of trust he thought he had was the only thing that caught his attention. But to Harry, it was the lack of denying the accusation that stood out.
Are things moving too fast between them, or too slow ?
. He comforted himself, feeling a bit better now that he was in this small enclosed space. Far from the crowd that was still swarming of the platform.
The voice asked bluntly, coming closer. He hadn't heard his footsteps, but he wasn't startled either. He was expecting him. And he didn't even turned around to greet Malfoy. He just shrugged, keeping his eyes to the forest.
He mumbled to himself, looking again at the potion. He didn't really know what to do of it yet. He was still perplex about it's effect. But still, he kept it, putting it in his back. Maybe someday it would be useful.
He refrained from giving more details but the raven haired boy could see him drop an agitated hand in the grass, his fingers starting to torture some strands. He seemed anxious.
Her whispering was chilling. Threatening in that clenched jaw of hers that made her sound like a snake hissing.
She began, ready to argue with him, but quickly gave up. Shaking her head with a heavy sigh and running a trembling hand in her messy hair.
He asked softly, putting the box in his own bag. The silence now looming over the castle meant only one thing: classes had started.
The Slytherin stopped him with a sudden shout. Harry froze but didn't turn around. He just waited there to listen to what he had to say.
He had never heard of it. Actually, he had never been into reading so... His knowledge on books was close to nothing.
He decided. He wouldn't be able to escape forever, stay here all year long until it was over. He had no choice... And delaying the moment would not make it less inevitable.
He just said flatly. Sure, this place was holding one of the heaviest maybe, but it was of no difference to him anymore. He still could enjoy the high view, the wind blowing strong at that height. So up above he could forget about all the other people downstairs, pretend like they were in complete different places and that he was truly alone. Or almost.
He answered, showing the room around from the tip of his finger and raising his eyebrow with scorn. He found some ease in this opportunity to enter a banter. It made him more comfortable than the potential heavy conversation he was too anxious to face, after that encounter at the lake. Glad that Harry had not brought up his apology.
Her sternness had already gone, again she was only dreamy, her voice like a lullaby. Smiling in her daze, as if she was lost in a world made of cotton. Making everything around her soft, and even the cold boy's heart.
Dropping his arm, he looked at her with his furrowed brows.
24.08.2019
Amongst the crowd, he could already hear rumours, his name on everyone's lips. His heart sped up and he hurried to get on the train, not stopping when someone tried to catch his attention. He felt the panic grow, needing to hide as fast as possible. His eyes on the ground, breathing too fast, he finally reached an empty compartment. He rushed in, followed by his best friends who were baffled by his pace. He then hastily closed the door. Letting himself fall on the seat against the window, he closed his eyes and exhaled, trying to regain control of his breathing.
The boy nodded before getting up without a word, heading as suggested towards the bathroom. He was dirty, he knew it. He hadn't washed for three days now. His condition was deplorable. He didn't even changed from his pyjamas. He could even smell himself at this point.
She approached slowly to put her hand on his, but Harry pulled away, adverting her gaze.
He asked bluntly and the girl took a quick glance at him before plunging back into her book.
It made Malfoy snap as he threw himself at Harry in a growl. Grasping his wrist to turn the wand away, the other hand grabbing his shoulder, he pushed him hard into the wall. The Gryffindor winced and made a sound when he felt the pain from the shock in his back. But it only took him a second to fight back. Struggling to push the blond away, he hit his tight hard with a knee to distract him, making the Slytherin bend a bit and allowing him to take the advantage. Managing to get rid of the hand on his shoulder, but not the one at his wrist, he pushed him back only to fall on top of him. Making both of them growl from the fall. He ended up loosing the hold of his wand as they started wrestling on the floor. Grabbing shirt and hoodie and pulling while rolling around to try to stay on top of the other. Harry was staggered to loose that fight for dominance. To be overpowered by the slender blond, who revealed himself to be surprisingly strong. He had finally manage to straddle the raven haired boy and was pining him firmly to the floor, pressing his legs against his sides. Feet curled against Harry's tights to keep them from wriggling. Clenching at his top to keep him still. Bent over the Gryffindor, eyes burning in his, they were both panting.
The gaze made Harry loose track of time, he almost felt like they were still conversing in silence. But then, Malfoy suddenly shook himself and got up on his feet. Making the Gryffindor land back into reality too.
Harry mumbled, absently drawing circles on his knees with the tip of his finger. Taking it in, it was indeed making sense. He too was surprised to find that his company was not the worst. Confused that it was almost too obvious how much they were actually alike. That he was the only one that made him feel like he wasn't being judge for feeling so depressed. Maybe the fact that they weren't friend had the perk that Malfoy had no expectations from him. No care to see the old Potter back, the one he disliked anyway. Therefore, no intentions of pushing him to get better or change. And also, he was the one who had never treated him like a hero, the saviour, drowned him in the suffocating glory. In the Slytherin's eyes, he had always just see a pathetic reflection of himself, mocked. And now, what he could see was just the image of an ordinary boy. Exactly what he had always wanted to be.
Also, let me know what you think of the story so far :)
Harry let out a low sneer in disbelief. He sounded so pathetic, very far for the boy he once knew. Or thought he knew... But for sure, the blond was honest. Which he was finding interesting.
He asked almost shyly and Harry turned to him. Looking for a second. Easily figuring that he didn't mind. He was coming to terms with the fact that the blond's company was of no bother. Nice even. So he slowly shook his head.
He said a bit too softly, trying to calm the Gryffindor who was obviously lost in his frenzy and had no control over it. The Slytherin was, him, clearly aware of the absurdity of the situation. Bewildered by Harry's strong reaction and sudden outburst, still trying to handle it with caution though, as he understood he was probably acting like this because of the trauma. His sudden burst of rage was a clear sign that his mind was still overwhelmed with the shock of the aftermath. Wound still so fresh it would bleed again at the slightest touch.
: 27.10.2020
The black haired boy questioned, frowning even more. Looking as Malfoy dropped his head in a sigh and seeing his lips turn into a sad smile for a second.
This analysis was far too confusing and Harry felt uncomfortable to see his vulnerability so exposed in those grey eyes.
Alone again, Harry found himself having to hold an urge to hit the walls. He even wanted to hit himself. He just felt distressed. His world was completely falling apart now. He had nothing left.
He thought to himself but sighed in relief when he was sure to be alone. Finally entering the room, with a sluggish pace he headed for the sofa facing the fireplace. Since the fire was still on, he should at least enjoy it's comforting warmth. But, suddenly, he froze. Lying down on the couch, he actually ended up finding someone... Someone he could not have seen from the stairs, hidden and curled up on his side. And that someone was not just anyone... Blond hair, and silver eyes looking at him as surprised as he was. Again Malfoy was there, and both stared at each other startled and confused. Cleary, at this hour, they both thought they would be alone. Also, not used to run into each other in a common room.
He teased, earning him a cold stare, eyes narrowed, from Harry. He never liked that word,
Harry grumbled, on his guard. Bewildered by the Slytherin's behaviour. He seemed calm, almost too calm. His expression was empty and it was the first time the Gryffindor saw him like this. No scorn or anger, not even his usual petty expression. As if the blond had been emptied of all emotions. It was awkward.
He growled and shook his head. Getting agitated.
All three of them, they were indeed still alive. A miracle he couldn't deny.
The corridor was now empty, all the students had join their respective classrooms. The boy was even surprised to see she was still there. They were going to be late to charms now.
It's a gloomy nightmare full of angst, so if you're uncomfortable with this, you can skip and without getting lost in the story also.
They then led Harry as requested to the dorm, and without detours, he rushed to find the Gryffindor boy room before letting himself fall on his new bed with a sigh. Nobody was in the bedroom yet, they were all busy chatting in the common room. Probably about him and his new attitude. Not understanding why he freaked out in the great hall and why he was still avoiding everyone, even his old friends. He didn't even greet Luna, Seamus or Dean. Not even Neville. Even tough he knew he should have. The boy played a major part in ending Voldemort's life for good. But he just couldn't face him yet.
Reaching his hand out to him, he didn't really know why he offered to share. It was almost too friendly of him, but it came like an impulse.
(See the end of the chapter for
His voice rose, he was shaking with anger. And Harry could feel himself getting angry too. Did Ron really believe that he felt broken by choice ? That he wanted to feel so anxious and guilty all the time ? Hating himself so much.
Malfoy giggled at the remark.
Closing his eyes, the boy sighed, rubbing his temples. What if, that day, he had let Cedric take the cup alone ? He could have simply dropped out before even entering that goddamn labyrinth... Not caring about his pride. Because really, that's all it was then, pride and nothing more. People were already spitting enough insults on him for no reasons. He didn't wanted to have the coward label added to the rest.
The blond stammered and Harry shrugged and smiled at his confusion. A bit proud to impress him with his map to be honest.
Now feeling terribly guilty for never having bothered to try to understand the Slytherin, to have continued to believe that the boy might regret the defeat of the party he had seemed to be fighting for.
It was too much for him to endure, he felt ready to collapse. A turmoil in his mind, blurred lines between reality and dream. He was feeling dizzy from the pain. Stumbling as he started walking backward, but then suddenly he fell. Right into a hole he hadn't seen behind him.
The lake in sight, the boy froze when he discovered another silhouette. Sitting in the grass, contemplating the water. He recognized effortlessly the blond hair that turned nervously on hearing him approach.
He said coldly to the girl who looked up at him. This wasn't the first time they were having this conversation, Harry had already tried many times to take the idea of coming here out of her head. But she was stubborn. Perhaps more than Ron whose determination he felt was getting weaker over the weeks. And now, he seemed to have finally decided to give up entirely. Maybe he was actually the smartest one out of the two, maybe he had realized that saving Harry Potter was a mission doomed to fail.
Turning on his heels, he started to walk away. Tilting his head towards the blond who had been staring at him all this time.
Harry pointed and Malfoy was left bewildered. He hadn't even think of that option, and he wondered why, because it was indeed a pretty obvious solution. And it was absolutely destroying his attempt at proving that he was deprived of ill intentions.
He asked suddenly. The blond didn't turn to look at him. His eyes seemed lost on the stone still. And in the grey irises, Harry could see the reflection of the undying fire dance.
Unable to break the bars, the boy desperately tried to reach out to him, stretching his arm inside the cell. But Sirius didn't reach to grab his hand. He stayed back against the wall, wary. No matter how much Harry was begging him trough his red and watery eyes. Heart aching, tight in his chest. He whined trying to reach further, pressing even his check against the cold metal. But he gave up when he realized his godfather wasn't going to move. Went back to trying to break the bars, pulling hard at them. But he couldn't even make them shake.
He scribbled back a time—later tonight, Charlie’s place—and sent the owl off. Then he apparated home, still humming, and gave Draco a feed and a thorough wash before sending him off to kneel by the floo.
If Harry’s cock hadn’t already been stiffening, that alone would have brought it to attention.  He mouthed at Draco’s shoulder with increasing need. "What about wet dreams? Seems a little unfair. That wouldn’t be your fault."
"Think. Present tense. I know you’re an arse." Draco’s cock was stiff and full underneath the silk. "But I forgive you for last week. I’m glad—" he paused, swallowing hard, "that it wasn’t what I thought."
Harry shot him back a look that said
"Oh fuck!" Harry’s legs spread and he thrust up involuntarily. "Fucking fuck, that’s good."
Harry made the water a little warmer still. Draco moaned when its heat ran across his arsecheeks, down his crease and across his exposed hole.  Little cries of pleasure came from his lips as Harry slowly, thoroughly, washed him clean. He looked so perfect Harry couldn’t resist leaning forward, licking a stripe across that hole. Then another back again, then he kissed and tongued until Draco was panting, little begging noises escaping from his mouth.
She’d been spending a lot of time lately with Remus and Sirius, Harry realized. That was nice. Good to see Sirius socializing with the branch of the Black family that hadn’t cut him off. Of course, you know what they said about Blacks and their cousins—
"You don’t need a towel, you’ve got a slave." Charlie was bending over, searching through the implements that had been swept onto the floor. "Go on, he’s trained to clean you up."
Harry looked shocked. "Is he allowed to do that? Talk back like that?"
Potter scrambled to his feet, hand firmly entwined in Draco’s hair. Charlie pulled his cock out and Potter tugged Draco’s head up with a gesture that might have been helpful and might have been possessive.
No, not his sub. His
once more then came, shaking, in his arms.
"Sixth year? I noticed that."
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s shoulder. "It was the best sex of my entire life. That’s why I was mad at you."
"Because, you. You know." Malfoy pinked a little. "You wouldn’t let me."
"Jump to it and get everything from the top drawer over there. Bring it all over and lay them out on the table for us." Charlie turned to Potter. "I’ll just show you some of his favorite toys, let you try a few out."
Only training kept him on his knees. That, and the fact he wasn’t sure he could walk with a cock this hard.
He almost laughed at the sudden odd sweetness of it. Harry must have taken a moment to freshen his breath with a charm.  Merlin knows you wouldn’t want the man whose savage beating you were enjoying to be bothered by the odor of cheap ale.
Potter choked on his next swallow. "You Veritaserumed Malfoy? And asked about what he wants in bed and why and what he’s already done and everything like that?" He was trying for disapproving but what came out was pure green jealousy.
"Er, yes? If you don’t mind, that is."
"Yeah, I do actually," Potter said. "Such as, how does work figure into it? He obviously doesn’t act like a slave there. And what if you want something he doesn’t? Or the other way around? What if one of you wants to end it?"
Potter had risen too, along with Charlie. His gaze was avid and he ran a hand down Draco’s front, from pecs to abs. "He’s more cut than I would have thought. Would have guessed he’d be softer beneath those fancy robes."
Draco put a hand on his own shoulder, the right one, and indicated a push down. Harry licked his lips and stepped close and Draco was suddenly so very aware of how naked he was, and how clothed was Harry.
Charlie snorted. "I had a Welsh Green once, you know. Raised him from an egg. Lovely specimen, great flyer, and desperate to mate too, but the poor bugger couldn’t close the deal. Kept mucking up the mating dance. Finally I had to put a collar on him, disillusion myself, and lead him through the steps myself. Personal triumph, that: I got two tons of dragon flesh happily laid."
"What about the relationship? Not just the sex, all the rest of it? I won’t let Draco go to someone who keeps him as a dirty secret." This was the real question as far as Charlie was concerned, and where it might all grind to a stop. "Not the slave part, of course, that’s private. But that you’re together."
will slaver over that too."
Potter ran a curious finger across the line, then said, "do you have, er, a towel or something? My
George and Fred’s eyes were fixed on poor Harry, still slouched against the wall, looking gut-punched.
Potter, you sick fuck, Draco thought with satisfaction. Potter loved this just as much as he did.
"You know what, Ron?" Harry jumped up and came around the desk to stand beside Draco, mischief catching fire within him. "I think we should get that pint tonight. I feel like celebrating."
"It’s for oral training, you see. You get full use of the tongue even if they won’t cooperate." Charlie pulled him down and rubbed his cock back and forth across Draco’s clipped tongue, grunting with pleasure as he did. "They quickly learn it’s easier to give an eager suck, work the tongue themselves than wear something like this. Top gets the pleasure either way."
But Harry looked so sincere and when he leaned down and kissed him, its truth was clear. "I have wanted this forever," Harry said in barely more than a whisper as he untied the leash’s cords. "Thank you for giving this to me."
So here he was, putting on a borrowed pair of PJ bottoms and standing nervously next to a bed transfigured large enough for three. Charm-brushed teeth, face washed, hair—well, there was nothing he could do about his hair.
The minute he was sure Charlie’d sacked completely out, he cast a wandless
"Ah, here we go," Potter said, taking them into the nice-sized bathroom.
"Give him tits and make him shake them? Can’t imagine what he’d do to get his cock back. Bet he’d do about anything for that."
Bet Draco wouldn’t mind kissing those boots. He always did prefer to put his lips on quality.
"Of course," Charlie said. "It’s one of the things I love about him." His fist turned to iron in Draco’s hair and all of a sudden he was dragging Draco down by the hair, his body following until he lay sprawled in front of Harry. "He just has to pay the price for it."
Remus raised an eyebrow. "The sight of formal robes has a moon-like effect on him. It forces him to transform, he claims, and he can’t change back until the robes are gone."
"Is it really him?" Harry breathed. "It’s not polyjuice? Not some kind of glamour?"
Harry whistled indignantly. "I could get a new broom for that! A top-of-the-line broom!"
the towels for Draco’s rub-down.
"I believe you were in the process of explaining, possibly through grunts, exactly what was going through your mind last week?"
is a little strong—last time I used it to clean up, I think I took the top layer off my cock."
At least he’d made it with enough time to track Malfoy down and ask him what the hell was up. He’d never written so fast, not even at his NEWTs. His right hand ached and for all the wrong reasons. It should be sore from bringing it down on that pure-bred, overly mannered, supposedly well-trained—
"Of course," Harry said eagerly. "The howler crowd has the attention span of gnats anyway. They get whipped up by some other non-issue and before you know it they’re sending their howlers to the Cannons’s chasers or the sub-minister for floos or whoever."
Charlie groaned and shoved his cock in Draco’s mouth, pulling him down until his face was deep in Charlie’s curls. Draco’s nose tickled but he didn’t ease back even a fraction. He kept his tongue working against the cock inside his mouth the whole time.
. If I’m an emotional caveman, he’s a Neanderthal."
"Here," said Charlie, coming back holding up a small metal clip with an attached ring. "This is really nice for training as well as other situations where you want to maintain strict control."
"In this scenario." George frowned. "But what about you? Is our dear, dashing brother going to be left all alone if he gets the Welsh Green properly set up?"
Harry groaned quietly. He’d seen pictures of chastity devices. Wicked little lock-boxes that kept the cock from getting hard. No matter how much Malfoy wanted, needed, craved a climax, he wouldn’t be able to get it up and come. What he’d give to put one of those on Malfoy before he fucked him raw…
"Charlie doesn’t spoil me," Malfoy whispered back furiously. "He makes me wait all the time. Bloody hell, he’s put me in chastity for a whole month before."
"Okay, that’s enough," Potter said, after the string of drool had just about reached the floor and the taste of trainer had sunk deep into his tongue. "Lick all that up and you’re done."
"He’s allowed lube but no prep," Charlie said, tapping firmly on Draco’s arsehole. It puckered, hot and responsive, and they laughed. The bastards. "A little lube on the outside of his hole, at most, then some more on your cock. No stretching him out with fingers first, either. He’s here for your pleasure, not his."
Draco shuddered as a hard shock hit him. Harry could feel his bollocks tensing involuntarily, could feel the twitches in his thighs.
Harry’s hips surged forward. "Fuck. He makes you wear it every night?"
"Oh fuck yeah." Potter had collapsed on floor beside him, looking completely shagged out.  "Brilliant."
Speaking of which, here was said git in person, blowing into the department in a flutter of nicely tailored grey robes. A stack of case files floated behind him, trailing along like sad little puppies.
made that decision out of anger. "Malfoy—Draco—it’s not—"
Charlie looked like he was watching his own personal comedy, one of those French ones with too much sub-text. "There’s nothing I would have enjoyed more. Honestly. I don’t get as much chance to train tops as I’d like. Bring all the pieces together, so to speak."
Draco’s hands sunk into his hair, clutching wildly as his cock was tongued. Then he pushed Harry back, scrabbling, trying to fend him off.
This time, Harry said yes.
Harry shivered with pleasure. He thought he knew what Draco meant. He’d particularly remembered that rule when he’d read the contract. He pulled the front of the shift up, delicately untangling it from its pinching hold on Draco’s cock. The charm allowed him to pull it up apparently, just not Draco. He flipped it over, brought it to Draco’s mouth and pushed it inside.
There were two little silver clamps attached to rings on the floor. Harry eyed them with interest, measuring out what they might be meant for. Nipples, certainly, by the look of them. Harry pushed Draco forward and sure enough, they lined up exactly with those pale nubs. Draco’s eyes had fluttered closed and he was pliable, bending forward, forehead to the ground, clearly knowing this position well.
charm too? Don’t really want to go to work and get screamed at by my mail all day."
. Harry had seen the contract, all drawn up, each ball-tighteningly exciting clause spelling out, line by line, exactly what could be done to the slave. They’d talked it through and Harry had learned all these words for what he was—top, dominant, master—and that it was fine, really, because there were men who wanted the same thing on the opposite end. There were bottoms, subs, slaves who’d love to serve him. Men who fantasized about having done to them all the things that Harry fantasized about doing.
"Square-dancing," Harry said, straight-faced. "American-style."
Potter grinned and gave a little tug to the leash. Pain seared outward from the oh-so-delicate center of his face. He cried out, helplessly loud, but he didn’t move. A tear slipped free from his watering eye and balanced on his cheek.
Except—well, except the better he got at occlumency, the more the girl-related fantasies went away. Back in sixth year he’d told Ginny they had to break up because it wasn’t fair to her he had to go hunt Horcruxes. He hadn’t mentioned the fact that he was finding it harder and harder to want her soft mouth and her cushy breasts, let alone what was down below. It was fine, though—there was a war on and he was dedicated to fighting it. He didn’t want sex with her because he was a soldier, a man who lived to fulfill his destiny!
Harry eased up, rewarding him for answering. "For how long?"
Oh, for fuck’s sake, did Potter need an illustrated tutorial? What part of ‘fuck the slut’ was hard to understand?
Ron looked startled then he grabbed his cloak and grinned. "That’s the ticket, Harry. These barristers have to learn which department is really in charge around here."
"Fuck, Harry," Draco said at last. "That was intense."
"You’re inviting me out with you?" Draco sneered in his classic, inimitably snooty way until Ron turned away. Then it disappeared, replaced by a tremulous happiness. Harry was taking him out? Making it real outside the bedroom as well as in just as he had promised?
"He’s trained for it," Charlie assured him. "He’ll whimper and whine that whole first stroke—and make it slow, please, I want him to feel the burn—but he can take it."
"You handled him well. Better than I expected for a novice," Charlie said, continuing the mutual admiration club in which Draco apparently had a starring role as the pet, or maybe the inanimate object.
Abbott grabbed her cloak and waved good night, still laughing, as Charlie took the message and gave the owl a generous treat.
He wasn’t going to do that. Instead he returned to scrubbing, feeling little shocks of emotion pierce him. He wanted this. Wanted Draco. Couldn’t bear to leave him here and go home.  He rubbed his hands up the inside of Draco’s thighs and washed—regretfully—his come away from where it had dribbled out of that well-fucked arse.
"It’s a tragedy for the world that we’ve got cocks—"
Charlie felt another shiver go through Draco. That teariness was threatening to escape his eyes and roll down his cheeks. "Well, then, that’s the serious stuff." He pulled Draco back to his cock, urging him down on it again to distract him. Draco would hate to be exposed by crying at a declaration of protection, even though he craved it. "But as I said, I might not be looking to sell."
Harry shrugged. "I get howlers whenever they link me with anyone. Way too many little old ladies living in little wizarding towns have very strong opinions on who I should be with. Mostly their granddaughters. So who cares if I get ten times the normal number of howlers? Hermione’s set a charm that
Hermione hissed, reprimanding her boyfriend. And harry felt grateful. She seemed to respect his need for time, understood his desire to flee. She was already relieved to see him on this platform, ready to go back. She knew how to be content with small victories. Trying hard to be patient and not ask too much of him. Baby steps.
Feeling suddenly shy and ashamed as he realized how absurd his reaction was. Maybe he was becoming crazy... Because it seemed he as really lost his mind. Unable to control it anymore.
Harry chuckled coldly. Shaking his head slowly with consternation. His mouth twisted with disgust.
Their surprised exclamations mingled and the two boys then stared at each other in silence. As if time had been suddenly frozen.
! He didn't want to be celebrated, He didn't deserve this attention. He just wanted to disappear.
Malfoy was confident and looked pleased with himself as he gazed again towards the boy who could only answers with a frustrated growl, rolling his eyes but unable to find something to say back. Chuckling at Harry who couldn't get his last word, once more. Because he never did, really. The blond had always won at those games.
Why the hell did he ever agreed to come back here ?
It's also always a big encouragement to hear from you <3
Hermione tried to look positive. It was almost funny because Harry knew she was wrong.
The boy slowly forced himself to swallow the whole toast, but couldn't bring himself to eat the second. His stomach was, after all, drastically reduced. For the time being, she would have to be content with this small effort.
How could two simple words hold so much despair in them ? The conversation was starting to putt Harry on edge. He was unable to just let it go, and it was really frustrating. Hand clenched on his quill, not even knowing why he kept on answering when it could have been left at that. It's was a good end to it, Malfoy just dropping things, not bothering him anymore... But no, he had to fucking answer again.
He wanted to protest, but the usually soft girl was having none of it. She lifted her hands to clap them on his cheeks, holding his face so he couldn't escape her stern gaze. Making him shut up with a heavy sigh. Harry froze at the touch. He hated being touched... But he felt unable to move to reject her.
Malfoy sighed, running a hand over his forehead as if he was starting to get a headache.
It was calling him, and as he got closer, he could see it clearly now. A light wooden door just standing between the hedgerow, with a black doorknob on it but no lock. Taking a deep breath, he went to open it. Slowly, carefully. He could feel his heart racing in his chest. Sweat starting to bead on his forehead.
But he could feel that she was already considering the half-eaten meal as a victory. When she understood that he was done eating, she pushed a book towards him.
: 21.10.2020
Harry's heart ached.
He asked lowly and Harry was stunned that he didn't seem to recognize him. He clearly had lost his mind. It should even have been a surprise that he remembered his own name. His eyes were the definition of empty. His face so emaciated the boy could see the lines of his skull.
. The thing they looked so scared to tell him. Strangely tough, Harry didn't seem to care. He was even a bit disappointed by the news, he was expecting something terrible, seeing how anxious his friend were acting.
He challenged him with arrogance. Eager to understand, what his excuse could be. Even though, he thought he was starting to actually understand a bit what the blond's problem was. He had indeed grasped his mark without realizing it when he had woken up. But why was it driving him so mad ? Maybe the fact that Harry had pointed his wand right at him didn't help but, on that point, the Gryffindor was a bit dumb and couldn't realize his wrongs. To him it had just been common sense, to be careful and ready to protect himself. He couldn't see the throwback effect it had had on Malfoy. Maybe because his brain was still a bit lost in his nightmare and not fully woken up.
Hermione pleaded softly, trying to be optimistic and reassure him. That was her way of doing things, always trying to make him see hope and give him faith. But Harry wanted none of that, not now. He felt it yesterday, the breaking was strong and real. Sure, they had fought many times over the years and made up every time. But this was different. This wasn't really about arguing actually, just parting away. Changing and not being a match anymore.
"Not much. Maybe every now and then." Harry went back to palming his cock, watching Draco’s suck skills with lip-licking intensity. "Is he no good at it, then? Might be worth a discount."
"I can’t." Harry smiled. "I have to go to a ball. Shacklebolt’s always telling me to go to more of those. Good for public relations."
"Who’s coming?" Draco asked after he’d been kneeling for a (not particularly long) while. His pose managed to convey irritated hauteur while still maintaining the most perfectly correct submissive posture.
"Cheers." He raised his glass in toast and took a nice long swallow, then put it down and waited for Harry to start.
Draco swished into the office, robes just so, chin held high. In his hand he held a single thin folder, papers discreetly concealed inside.
"I didn’t give you permission to use my first name."
It tasted—well, not quite as vile as he would have expected. "If I die from some shoe-borne illness, I’m going to come back and haunt you, Potter," he muttered.
"But you can. I read your contract. You have the right to sell Draco if you want."
A hand touched his bollocks and he jumped.
"I’ve got some kibble in the kitchen still. High quality, very healthy. Keeps him in great shape."
"No, fuck, didn’t you understand what I just told you, you cretin?" Draco’s eyes were still a little wild when Harry looked up. "I can’t come in this."
"First, though," Charlie said, heading back to the sofa and picking up his beer. "Let’s talk about slaves and contracts and all of that. You’ve got to have some questions."
"The gesture’s this." Charlie flicked his hand in a simple sign, ending in a loose fist. "The more you close your fist, the smaller the harness gets. Like this."
you." He sank his teeth into Draco’s shoulder and closed his eyes with bliss then went absolutely rigid. He came with an animal sound, desperate and long and needy.
Before he could think twice, Draco kissed it. If you could even call it a kiss, he rationalized. It was more just hiding his face again, with his lips down, in the direction of the shoe. He couldn’t even move away, not with Charlie pinning him with a strength more used to Hungarian horntails than English barristers. And okay, Draco’s lips did move, forming what might be called a kiss, but it wasn’t like either of them could see that, or like Potter could feel it through the shoe.
A wicked look came into Harry’s eye. At least Draco thought it did—his vision was still watery.
Charlie flopped back to the sofa and got himself off with a couple of fast pulls as he watched Draco collapse forward into Harry’s arms. Pleasure rushed through him, a relief both physical—fuck, it was so good—and mental. There was nothing like seeing a pet go to a good home.
"Malfoy is the one who should be worried." Harry grabbed the first file and picked his quill up again. "Death by addendum is too good for him." Or maybe not death. Maybe just a good, sound beating and then Malfoy apologizing on his knees and then—
Harry chuckled deep in his throat. He nipped at Draco’s shoulder. "And he thought you might have a problem tonight? Thought you might indulge in a little surreptitious wank with me here in bed with you?" His teeth sank a little deeper. "Answer honestly."
"In other words, he’s lounging on the rug snarfing dog biscuits and listening to the punk show on the radio." Tonks overbalanced against Remus’s shoulder, barely stopping her champagne from spilling.
"If you mean beatings, everything from spanking to whipping, well I don’t necessarily use those as punishments. You get a pet with a masochistic streak like this one here"—a rub to the back of his neck as Draco delicately laved the vein beneath the head, "—and you risk confusing them. You can end up teaching them to behave badly to get the paddling they want. You have to make sure that a punishment is genuinely something they don’t want if you mean to condition their behavior."
"Harry, it’s Harry isn’t it? Is that what you want?"
and then there’s
"Well?" Charlie asked, turning to Potter. "Did he give you a good ride?"
Draco’s heart sped up as a thought entered his head. Did Charlie think—was Potter a perfect match for him?—not that he wanted to leave Charlie—but submitting to Potter was so fucking intense—
Harry felt extremely awkward. Which, okay, was probably to be expected when getting into bed with two other blokes. Even if it was only to go to sleep, not to fuck.
"You haven’t used one of these before, right?" Charlie asked, probably letting Potter take a good look at the implement that was going to make his old school rival weep.
"When?"  Harry rubbed the nipple between his fingers, squeezing hard now, moving from stimulation into pain.
Charlie rolled his eyes. "Of course I bloody well suck him. I like cock, yeah? You do too or you wouldn’t be looking to buy. Go on, get a taste. Make sure you like it."
He didn't mention his meeting with Malfoy, for now it was still far too confusing and he wouldn't know what to say. Also, he didn't feel like sharing, it would be too much talking.
Feeling her gaze still on him, the boy felt almost terrified by it. It burned him.
Hermione's voice was loud when she called him with obvious relief, making everybody quiet and turn towards him. He was panting at the door, because he ran. He had lost track of time during his morning walk. And now he felt like he was frozen. Everybody was looking at him, knowing who was under the now useless hood...
And then suddenly he was hit. Water fell hard on him and he got carried away by a giant wave. Struggling underwater, his body rocking with the current. Until he was pushed on sand, the wave retreated and he was left stranded on a shore.
Class was finally over and Harry hurried to put his things back in his bag, wondering why he even took them off, so he could flee before anyone could try to talk to him. Hastily, he left the room and headed head down towards the next class. But he was suddenly stopped by a hand on his wrist. Almost ripping his arm off as he was pulled over by surprise. He turned around ready to growl and shout at the person who had the nerves to think he could just intercept him like this when he didn't want to be bothered. But his temper cooled down when he faced Hermione. From the corner of his eye he also saw blond hair walk past by them, distracting him and he couldn't help himself but to take a quick glance at Malfoy, who glanced back with a slight smile. It was just a second, and he had no idea why he was drawn to look. But damn there was something unsettling about the blond smiling that was confusing him. It was such an unusual sight.
Just to let you know, I've reworked all the chapters. Not really changing the story, but it was full of mistakes (I'm sorry, I never realized how bad it was...) So I tried to fix all the grammatical issues, but if you see some left, please feel free to point them out, it would really help me :)
He could hear the worry in her voice, because she knew very well the impact this news would probably have on him. And she wasn't mistaken.
He said with a tone that was trying to be more light. Successfully making the blond smirk again.
Without a word, he followed the girl who was already heading towards the kitchen at a fast pace so she could hurry and offload the books on the large table in a relieved sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
He couldn't help himself but to take a glance at the blond as his answer was transferring. Noticing how he was still biting his lip, his grey eyes reading with a bit of sadness in them. Sighing as he sat himself better, leaning forward on his desk, playing with the quill in his lean fingers like he was wondering too much about what to answer. He could even see him do something he had never seen him do before. Just a simple gesture that could actually seem pretty normal and common, but not from him who had always looked so full of confidence in the past. He rubbed his palm on his forehead before running his fingers in his hair, leaving them there as he leaned a bit more over the paper, steadying himself with his elbow on the desk. Making him look beaten down, as if he was struggling. In a turmoil of thoughts. Thinking as he unconsciously started letting the tip of the feather of his quill rub against the corner of his bitten lips.
The Slytherin looked awfully innocent while he was lost in his reading. Like a child mesmerized by a story, he was even smiling sometimes. And Harry marvelled at the naive sight, because he was stunned to see that, after all the horror they both had been trough, the blond seemed to still have the ability to be amazed by a story, to free his spirit and travel in those fictive lands where he could find excitement. Proving that, somehow, he was still alive inside, that he had kept safe, and hidden somewhere, a part of the kid he was, or was supposed to be, the one that adults tried to destroy by making him grow up too fast, modelling him with their own ideas and forcing a destiny he never asked for upon him. A fragment of soul that was now setting free. The blond had been clever to preserve it... unlike the Gryffindor who was now only damaged good, with nothing left intact inside him. He had given his all, let the war stained every little inch of his mind. All of his innocence had burned, turning to ashes his ability to just enjoy things, even the simplest one. Even just a story... And looking at Malfoy, who was still able to have  even just a faint shimmer of light in his eyes, despite looking mainly broken, he felt weak. Because Harry's eyes were nothing but darkness. He hadn't even been strong enough to save just a tiny spark in himself.
Harry attacked the bars again. Refusing to give up even if he had lost his mind. And refusing to find meaning in his nonsense.
Or so Harry had been told, and that's why he had decided to give it a try after the war. In the hope it would actually work. He had remembered seeing a lot of muggles smoke when he was a kid, always wondering why they did and what could be so appealing in those smelly smoky tubes of paper. He had easily associated it with stress even before being told so. Often, when he was seeing someone looking nervous, they would lit up a cigarette and release the first blow with a typical relieved exhale, like they had been craving for it more than anything else. So he had figured that it must truly help to soothe the nerves somehow, if they were all so addicted to it.
He detailed. It was painful to admit it, shameful, but to be trusted he knew he needed to be completely honest. They had allowed him to keep on living by putting him in a cage, diminishing him. Like a wild beast that should never be trusted and on which you should always keep a careful eye on. That's how he felt, an animal held on a leash. But this option was better than the other one. Which was being sent to Azkaban... His young age had earn him some indulgence from the jury. They had offered some mercy with the benefit of the doubt. That he was just a kid, doing what his father had told him to do. That, given the chance, now on his own he could become someone good.
But he got disappointed when he started himself. It wasn't as calming as he had expected it to be, and also it was disgusting. But at least, it had the perk of being distracting. And he got hooked on the placebo effect it was giving him. When he was feeling fidgety, it was nice to have something to help him keep his fingers steady. It was filling the emptiness of his life. And he understood the true reason of the addiction then.
The Slytherin answered in a weak voice and Harry could almost hear the knot in his throat. Air filled with a strange warmth that had nothing to do with the now dying fire. Although, it felt too heavy. Making him break a slight smile.
She stopped a moment and took a breath as if to calm down.
The mud was making a squishy noise under his feet. Above him, a sky so black it was even hiding the moon. Thick and dark hedgerow trapping him from each sides, forming a dead end in his back. He had no other options but to move forward to try and find an exit. The leaves were brushing against his shoulders as he walked carefully into the thin corridor. Nose filled with the smell of dirt, but also, oddly of blood. He looked for his wand in his pockets, to help himself with some light, but it was nowhere to be found. Without it he was feeling bare, vulnerable in this suffocating darkness. The end of the path was erased by the night and it made it appear endless. He wanted to run to reach the exit quickly and get out of here, but that pitch black was menacing, and his Gryffindor courage seemed to have vanished with his wand.
This morning he had finally managed to find a perfectly empty path to class. Through forgotten or useless corridors that no one used, or going trough some at times where no one would take them. Embracing the loneliness, until he heard footsteps ahead. As a habit he ducked his head lower. But he started to feel his heart pound when the footsteps came closer. Straight at him.
His voice was deepening into a gloomy tone. Soulless.
Harry didn't answer, once more frozen with surprise. It was now the Slytherin's turn to lose his temper.
Hi breathing stopped and he dared to look up only to freeze instantly when he discovered a memorial standing in the centre of the courtyard. Built from a wreck, a huge stone that recalled the partial destruction of the castle that night. Standing tall in the middle of a circle of fire that was never to be extinguished. Enchanted to last forever, bright and fierce. On the surface of the stone was engraved the names of all those who fell for freedom that day, covering the whole front. The letters were shining with a dim light in them. He felt a knot in his stomach, a sudden urge to throw up. His vision soon became blurred. He didn't even realized he had squeaked in shock.
As he walked, he suddenly started to hear steps and murmurs of voices. It was time for breakfast and the students were starting to leave their dorms. Feeling the anxiety rising in him again, he quickly pulled his hood to hide under it, hands stuffed in his pockets, and made his pace faster as he was now heading towards the exit.
But so close to losing her, he realized only now what true loneliness meant. He thought he had it already, but he was wrong. He only had some, but she was still there to prevent him from being eaten wholly by it. Even when she was annoying or pushing him too much, she was there to keep the small sparkle of life in his heart. So it wouldn't go completely cold and just stop beating. Actually he felt so grateful towards her now. He had kept pushing her away but the truth was he needed her to stay. And so far she had. Even if she was well aware she was often bothering him, she never gave up on saving him.
He raised his hands to put a finger under each of his eyes, referring to the Gryffindor dark circles.
He almost jumped out of his chair when suddenly a ripped parchment appeared on the blank one he was admiring. Something wrote on it. Handwriting so elegant he knew who it was from without even having to read it yet. Turning then his head towards the blond with furrowed brows, shaking lightly his head as to ask what was the matter. He felt bothered. But Malfoy's straight face only answered by pointing his chin towards Harry's desk, where the little paper was still waiting to be read.
He felt terribly small and fragile facing this memorial which had the effect of a blade going straight to his chest. His legs were wobbly and he avoided the fall only thanks to Ron who, feeling him weaken all the sudden, quickly passed a hand around his waist and grabbed his shoulder by the other to support him.
Malfoy's face finally ceased to look empty, he was clearly offended by the comment. Now writhing in an expression of anger. He seemed almost hurt, or maybe upset. Harry had trouble figuring it out. But there was no doubt, he felt insulted.
She almost yelled at him, but Harry didn't even flinched. He didn't care. He just shook his head and shrugged. Acting like it wasn't affecting him, because nothing did anymore. Supposedly. Truth was different though. He was trying to deny it but he was aching. And even if he convinced himself that he wanted to sneer earlier at the dramatic way Ron passed by them, in reality he wanted to cry. He loved him for sure. He just didn't know how to be his friend anymore. Their connection was lost and neither of them knew how to save it. So it was easier to pretend that losing his best friend didn't even bother him than to keep on trying. He already had enough reasons to cry anyway. Enough problems he needed to work on. Adding another one would just kill him to be honest, his energy was already drained.
The next day seemed to be again the same as yesterday, and the day before it. Like a day on repeat, stuck in a day without end. Harry being nothing more than a shadow in the corridors, taking detours to avoid meeting anyone. Hidden under is hoodie, eyes never leaving the floor. He was ignoring is growling empty stomach, still couldn't get himself to enter the great hall and get some food. He was feeling to nauseous in the crowd to eat anyway. Surviving only on the leftovers that Hermione was giving him.
The boy flinched at the order. Hermione was obviously loosing her patience with him. He had rarely heard her raise her voice like this. With a broken rage, born from pain. She looked at him almost angrily. But Harry saw mostly despair in her eyes. And a feeling that he had rarely seen on the face of the brunette. Impotence. Like she was struggling to find the answer to a problem. And, for once, she indeed couldn't. Because she didn't know how to save him anymore. Harry was a problem that she couldn't solve. And it was a first for her.
He tried to make her understand, so she would dropped the matter. But damn she was stubborn.
He just answered, still not caring to give him details about his whereabouts. Sharing guilt didn't make them friends yet.
Looking to the left first, he narrowed his eyes to try and see better, hoping to get used to the dark. And afar, he thought he could see a door.
His steps were wary, holding his breath at each one. He could feel it, like a foreboding, he knew something was waiting for him in the shadow ahead, lurking. He thought he could even hear breathing in the hedgerow surrounding him. Heavy, almost growling. They were coming from all around, he couldn't say were exactly. But he didn't feel alone.
He sighed, he really wished it would be easier. To erase the whole history between them and start anew. Forget everything. But, unfortunately, he couldn't change what had been. It was optimistic of him to have believed he could. And this change of mind from Harry was a bit painful to the blond. But at least, he wasn't pointing his wand at him anymore... So, in a way, he had managed to make a bit of progress, even if it was still a step back from yesterday. For a reason he still couldn't understand though, since he had done nothing wrong.
But suddenly he realized, someone was leaning on the railing already. He froze, but it was only blond hair... Only... He felt weird to be relieved by that fact...
The question sounded stupid to Harry. It had only been a bit more than four months since the war was over, and this war had been all of his life. How was he supposed to have moved on so quickly ? Everything he was, everything he had lived was entangled with this fight. It had made him, defined him. It was such a big piece of him that without it he felt like nothing was left of him.
Malfoy sighed rolling his eyes then letting them stop on the wand in Harry's hand.
He breathed, closing his eyes for a second, before letting his gaze open with a determination even stronger.
: 22.10.2020
He mumbled, focusing to not let a tear fall. Looking at the flask once more, now seeing it as a gift and not something to be wary of. A gentle and kind gesture.
He answered flatly to hide the pain of having to say such a thing. She was smart, and for sure Ron had told her about their altercation, so she should have had figured it out by herself and not bother him with the subject.
... And now that it was done, everything seemed meaningless. He had realized that he had never grew beyond his mission. It was all he ever was. Making him no more than an empty shell without it.
Malfoy suddenly started to talk again. Calmly this time. In doing so, inviting Harry to truly listen to him and his arguments.
Malfoy answered firmly, his jaw tight.
Harry warned him, quickening his pace.
He asked and Harry held a bitter grin.
Ok, so I wanted to put so much into this nightmare... but didn't wanted it to be too long also. So I hope I didn't rushed it too much.

He persisted arrogantly, mulish, or maybe just really stupid. Probably too proud to yield and reconsider his behavior towards the blond, admit that he reacted badly because he was fooled by a dream. But he had learned to consider them as warnings, and the habit was rather hard to get rid of.
The blond stayed still, only turning his gaze a bit to look at him, head to toe, before smirking.
Harry had already heard this reasoning dozens of times, but she continued to repeat it over and over. As if to firmly push this idea into his brain. She pounded as many times as necessary. And, as always, Harry nodded without truly believing it. But at least, it silenced her.
Harry felt his muscles stiffen at the mere sight of the books. They represented a hope that he just couldn’t seem to reach. He didn't want to go back. Walk again where everything ended. Where all this horror occurred. He shivered at the simple thought of it, a knot in his stomach, he felt nauseous.
He had thought he had managed to go through that first day, but no. Everything was even worse now. Pressing his hands on his face, he finally screamed in his palms.
He screamed in a frenzy, not able to contain himself. Eyes watery with fury. Startled by his vivid reaction, the blond almost jumped back. Looking at him first with confusion before letting a sneer escape his lips. Smirking, he now looked annoyed. Raising one eyebrow, Harry felt like he was actually meeting his old cunning nemeses again. And he knew from experience and from that look he knew too well, that he was not going to shut up.
Ron finally said in a weak voice, it seemed like he was almost pleading. And Harry could feel his stomach sink. An overwhelming sadness at the thought that his best friend, or former, couldn't bring himself to just say sorry, after all they had been through. A simple word that even Malfoy had managed to say... Was the redhead's pride more important than him ? Suddenly, everything seemed like a lie to Harry. All his memories rotten in his head. Was it all fake ? And was it truly over now ? He knew he was to blame for the distance, but now that things were concrete, he realized that he knew even less who he's supposed to be without them. And as that true and deep loneliness was now hitting him, he wondered what was the point of going on then ? Hidden like a ghost under his cloak, so close and yet not a part of them anymore, this was the reality than turned into a living metaphor. Ironic, and painful.
After what seemed like hours of staying up against the railing, Harry finally turned around and went back inside. The night was getting chilly and his legs painful from staying still for so long. The moon was now completely on the right side of the tower, but the clouds were getting thicker and darker and it's light was slowly being killed by them. Making the horizon even darker, he couldn't even see the forest anymore. He went to sit on the stairs too, at the opposite side of Malfoy. There he watched him, but the blond didn't even glance back. He was completely absorbed by his story it seemed. Eyes moving fast and getting wide, then frowning. Sometimes his lips were moving along the words he was reading, without a sound being made. Harry looked at the book he was so devoted to, a black cover with only the title written in silver on it.
He had to quickly get out of there, the ceiling was starting to crack. So he ran back to the door, and again, he was surrounded by the hedgerows, his feet in the mud. The sounds of terror and destruction died when the door closed behind him. But he was startled to discover that he wasn't back at same place. Because now, he wasn't facing the path leading to the crossroad again, but just another door, straight in front of him. A door he had no other choice but to go through. It looked different. This one was painted a bright white, with a gold doorknob. Taking a deep breath, he went to open it. But the scenery  he found behind it was far from what he could have excepted from the look of the elegant door...
The rest of the day was uneventful. And it had seemed painfully long to Harry. He had just sat in silence in the back of the classes all day, waiting for the hours to go by, and escaped the meals by wandering. Like a shadow trough the castle, he was feeling like a ghost. Still there but with no meaning to it.  He had no future to look forward to, no goals anymore. What was he now anyway ? He had accomplished his destiny, met his purpose. So what was left ? He had never thought of that after part, because he had never thought he would have one. All of his life, he had only been focused on ending
The bond started to explain vividly, before stopping himself. His expression breaking instantly from wrath to something softer that made him look lost and sad.
Sirius first said with a tender tone.
He came here for a reason, and that reason had nothing to do with arguing with Malfoy.
She understood what Harry meant by obvious and, with eyes widened by scandal, she protested. She just couldn't believe it could come down to that. She refused the idea. They had lost too many friends in the war, and there was no way she would lose one more over what she considered a stupid fight.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was all that had been written.
The Slytherin seemed at a loss of words hearing that. Looking at Harry with widened eyes and an open mouth, his breath on hold. The Gryffindor seemed to notice he was even shaking a bit. Dropping his eyes with remorse as the blond took a minute to take it in.
All this seemed very useless to him. Hermione was striving to make up for their missed year, passing their exams by owl thanks to a special permission. All that so they could simply go back to Hogwarts and keep on as if their life had never been interrupted. As if they could forget so easily, pretend and just move on.
Also, what do you think of the evolution of their relationship ?
She tried to smile softly to calm him down. This time though, she didn't reach to touch his hand. She had come to understand that the physical contact was too much to the boy for now.
Harry was at a loss. What had they done to him ?
He mumbled, defeated. Chewing is bottom lip, because he realized now that he really had no way of proving Harry that he could be trusted. Even if he could have argued that it would be too risky for him anyway. They would just have to use a drop of veritaserum to know the truth and put him straight in Azkaban... But it would probably be counterproductive to use the desire of staying out of jail as his motivation to not commit crime...
She laughed softly as if she was evoking a tender memory.
She explained lightly, mimicking how to use it with her finger even if the boy still had his eyes locked on the flask.
Again, Harry could have left it at that. But he couldn't seem to be satisfied. Getting fidgety, he began tapping his fingers on his desk. Pushing his tongue in his cheek as he was thinking. Why was he still frustrated ? Why did it bother him to leave it at that ? He tried to ignore it, but he knew, he felt pity for the blond... The sad lonely Malfoy was actually getting to him. The way he had given up on his pride, desperate to the point of reaching to his old enemy... It was making him reconsider. Thinking back to their encounter in the common room, the blond had revealed himself to be able to respect silence. And his company wasn't really bothering then. Figuring then; if he was craving for silence and Malfoy for company, maybe they could find an agreement. If he was wiling to keep quiet that was, be a shadow.
Her speech left Harry disconcerted. But he needed that. he nodded silently and gave in because he understood. Yes, he understood this time, and Hermione's words awoken something in him. He who couldn't find any meaning left in life, who couldn't even understand why he was still breathing. She managed to remind him of something he had forgotten. This friendship that united them. The love he felt for his friends. Despite the shame Harry felt towards them, he didn't want to lose them, or cause them any more pain.
Malfoy answered quickly with confidence. Nodding his head as if he was trying to convince Harry who was looking at him unsure. Actually, he was surprised to find himself so admiring of the blond. He must have been one of the most hated man in the world nowadays, yet he was still finding the strength to keep a positive mind about things. He even became somewhat inspiring. And Harry realized how much more there was to him than what he had always thought. He wished he could think like him, focus on the good to fight his darkest thoughts. But he just couldn't...
But a glance towards Malfoy kept him for cancelling it. The blond was smiling. Looking happy... A sight that stupidly made him want to smile a bit too. Be he didn't.
They turned their gaze away at the same time, feeling it was becoming too heavy, and Harry observed the tower around him, nervous and unease, not knowing where to look anymore. His throat was dry and he heard Malfoy clear his before talking.
Slowly getting down the spiral stairs on his tiptoes, he was surprised to discover a light coming from the common room when it should have been pitch black at this hour. It was a warm flickering light, and the sound of flames eating wood told him it was coming from the fire. There was only a few steps left but he stopped himself for a second. It probably meant someone was still there, and he was clearly trying to avoid any encounter. Biting his lips anxiously, he then tried to look into the room as best as he could from where he was standing, not revealing himself, he even made the lumos spell disappear. But, surprisingly, there was no one to be seen. The couches were all empty, and there was not a single sound except from those coming from the fire.
But everything was going fast now. And even if he was becoming aware that he was dreaming, it all still felt too real and he still felt the need to escape. Still felt the danger fastening his heart. Rising quickly on his feet, he knew he had no time to cry over Cedric's body, nor to think. He had to leave him there. They were surrounded by a circle of masked Death Eater, Pettigrew and his knife was there too. Ready to take his blood. Harry had to run, quickly. At full pace, he barely managed to push between two Death Eaters to clear his way before they could caught him. Running then blindly with no idea of were he was going, as long as it was far from here, it's all that mattered. But it was like the way had been traced for him, because in the middle of the cemetery, he was trapped in a corridor. On both sides, rows of statues representing angels of death, drawing a path. Each of them holding one of all the persons he ever loved, struggling under their scythe. But he couldn't stop to save them. It was a painful dilemma but he knew he had to keep going.
Malfoy seemed to be startled when he heard Harry call him. Quickly turning around with the sound of a sniff, almost as if he was scared. He looked small, beaten. No smile in sight today. Instead, Harry noticed a wet glow in his eyes and also a redness. Had he been crying ?
Harry kept his mouth shut throughout the all journey. Mute, he found it easier to pretend he was asleep. Hours spent with his eyes closed, feeling his pulse getting faster and resisting the urge to change his mind and apparate back home. He didn't even care if his body ended up torn to a thousands of pieces due to the movements of the train. Maybe the idea even seduced him a bit...
A tiny smile of relief came across the blond's face. His body seemed to relax a bit also. He was taking that small victory, holding on to it. Feeling a bit more comfortable.
He had to admit, again, he must have been pretty annoying, acting like a know-it-all hero, like he was better than everyone else. Because he had a destiny. That fucking destiny... What a joke.
"Well we know you like it," Charlie said, throwing back another swallow of lager, "but let’s see what effect it had on him. Turn around then, pet, and give us a show."
A laugh. "Only to hold up my pants."
