Potter looked up at him. “Huh?” Draco rolled his eyes.
“That's silly. You should call him his real name.”
“A Flash,” Malfoy said calmly. Ron choked on his toast.
“Hang on, I never
As soon as Draco had finished stirring and the potion needed to sit for five minutes, he unlatched the door. His Aunt's owl entered. He took the parchment from her beak and pet her softly. It was definitely his Aunt's owl, but the writing was neither his Aunt's neat cursive nor Teddy's attempt at letters. It was plain, small writing that Draco thought was familiar, but couldn't quite place.
“I had put up some banners that were... less than complimentary of you. A sort of birthday present, if you will. But these two felt the need to tear them down, for some reason.” The grin returned, and Harry let his head fall to the back of the couch with his eyes closed.
When Malfoy was in just his pants, Harry growled. “Get over here.” Malfoy looked at him, unamused.
? At first he'd thought the guy just wanted as many allies in the Wizarding World as possible, but he wasn't going out of his way to befriend – impress? - anyone else. He was polite to all of the Gryffindors since coming back this year, but nothing like he was with them. He was focused on the three of them.
Eventually he looked up to find he was correct; they were staring at him. Harry twirled his eggs around his plate. “I never said he was up to something, not since we've been back. You all just assumed that. Truth is, I just like looking at him.” Harry continued eating calmly. It felt nice to admit it. Who cared if his friends knew? He was tired of pretending. He was Harry freaking Potter, and if he wanted to have a stupid crush on someone, he would.
“What in blazes makes you think that?” He tried to keep his face blank. The last thing he wanted was all his friends talking about Harry tonight. This was their one night a week to get some greasy food, drink too much for their age, and forget any stressful parts of their life.
“I am.” Draco's head snapped to the boy beside him.
"I'm not stalking anyone. I'm just… observing. People watching." Ron snorted and shook his head as he settled down into bed.
They were silent as they walked to the end of the path, where Harry turned to face him. “It was... good to see you, Draco. It seems like you're doing well.” Draco nodded.
“Harry.” Said boy jerked his head up at that voice, the one he felt like he hadn't heard in months. He'd spoken in class yesterday, but that wasn't the same voice that yelled at Harry, that insulted him, that cried out his name in Harry's daydreams-
“Well, I might be a masochist, too,” he mumbled. Sitting beside this idiot and enjoying the way his heart was beating like a hummingbird's wings confirmed this.
“A Flash,” she repeated, flabbergasted. “I'm going to assume you mean something other than the latest model of broomstick?” Malfoy shook his head.
“Shut up, it was nice.”
“I know this is hard to believe, but I have had a plan or two fail in my life.” Harry fake-gasped.
“I don't want to argue with you anymore,” Draco blurted out of nowhere.
When they sat down, Ron and Seamus started speculating who it could be. Harry gave away nothing, ignoring all their guesses and questions and remarks. He ate as though no one was speaking to him. Hermione stared at them in confusion as they discussed the matter avidly. Harry's stomach turned at her thoughtful expression. Had she somehow figured it out from some inconsequential thing he hadn't noticed? But she waited for Ron to finish his current theory. “But... it couldn't have been Parvati.”
After finishing the novel from yesterday and eating lunch, Draco pulled out some books on Alchemy. He'd forced himself to stop working over the weekends, per George's request that he didn't kill himself, but he didn't count research as work; he enjoyed it too much.
Later that night when he tried to do his homework, the only thing he could remember from the class was Malfoy's pretty script writing as he took studious notes, the way Malfoy's hair curled in one place near his neck, and Malfoy's smile when Pansy made comments throughout the class.
about him. “Anyway, what are you thinking for Ron, now? You've been spending time and playing chess with him, gave him that gift for Hermione, done the food route.” Malfoy sighed.
“Shit friends,” Weasley interrupted. Granger smacked her lightly. “What? I didn't have all day to wait for you to get it out.” Draco snorted. Or whatever it was that was more dignified that sounded like snorting.
“C'mere.” This time, Harry was not demanding, but closer to begging. Malfoy glanced around the room, ensuring they were the only ones present.
. Just... observing.” Everyone ignored Harry, and he didn't blame them.
As he rinsed off, Draco thought back to the last time he'd had an actual conversation with Harry. Almost three years ago, Harry had owled him out of the blue. He'd said he had something important he wanted to discuss with Draco in person and asked him to meet him later that week at a café in Diagon Alley.
Harry grinned as he looked up to met Draco's eyes. Draco immediately dropped his head down and pretended he wasn't listening. “You know what? I think it was.” Granger scoffed.
“What the hell are you doing?” he heard Weasel's grating yell before he noticed them entering the room. Draco merely glared at him as he charmed the last card into the large bag he'd whipped up.
“What look?”
“Malfoy,” Harry grunted. He didn't take his eyes off the boy when he started pulling off his Quidditch practice jersey. His breath hitched at the sudden sight of Malfoy's bare chest. If Malfoy noticed him staring at him intently, he didn't say anything.
“First, why don't you lay off other people's relationships that aren't even real? Not just mine, Neville's and Hannah's and whomever else you were talking about before them. It's none of your business. Second, why the hell would I or Ha- Potter care that you are watching us fight?
“Where did that come from, by the way?”
“You coming to Charms, Draco?” He pulled himself out of his thoughts and saw he was one of the only people still in the room. Blaise was standing on the other side of the table. Draco quickly stood up and grabbed his books.
“So you approve!”
“Harry, you didn't...” he shrugged again. Harry grabbed another copy that had been left down the table and read it for himself. Merlin only knew if the reporter would actually report what he'd said. He skimmed the first paragraph, a few lines about how Hogwarts was a safe environment that had rebuilt so well since the war.
And if the git could do that for Harry, that probably meant Ron had to do it, too.
But now Malfoy was being
“You got him a gift?” Ginny asked quietly. He looked up at her with a mischievous smirk. Her confused look turned to disappointment. “Really, Draco? It better not be something awful. I swear-”
It became a regular occurrence for Malfoy to casually offer him extra treats from Honeydukes or whatever his mother had sent him, so regular that Ron eventually forgot to be weirded out by it.
“Not always by any stretch. And when they fight they're calm, not heated. Not giggling at each other. Not acting like they want to rip each other's clothes off.”
“Potter,” Draco returned with a short nod.
“Thank you, Harry. That was actually really good.” When Harry didn't answer, Draco looked up to find Harry smirking at him. “What?”
“Uh, okay. What?”
Ron shook his head and turned back to his sister. No doubt Harry was just thanking him for the broom.
Harry was still glaring at the fireplace as if it were the redhead. Granger was sitting at the other end of the couch, nervously glancing between Harry and the room to the dorms. She was trying to write an essay and Harry had his parchment out, too. But it was clear neither of them were making any progress.
“Sure.”
“Sorry. I guess I'm bored with nothing dangerous happening this year. Maybe it's just force of habit, I don't know. But I'll... leave you alone.” Harry left, trying to convince himself he could even do that.
“And I'm the idiot,” He muttered, coming back to sit even with Draco. “I don't like being around you because you argue with me or insult me. I like that you aren't
Maybe that would teach Ron to give him some privacy.
. He had tried talking his mother into selling the place, but she had refused so far. Maybe it was just his imagination, but he swore he could see her resolve crumbling day by day.
In a few moments, Ron had jumped up and was almost to the common room door. He hesitated when he heard soft voices in the common room. He stilled and slowly crept forward, doing everything he could not to be heard.
“Mal- Draco, that's... thank you!” Ron was as surprised as Malfoy when Hermione jumped up and threw her arms around the blond. She didn't seem embarrassed or wait around for a reaction, quickly dropping back to her seat and opening to the first page. “Thank you, thank you. I'll get it back as soon as possible.”
“No,” Ron said simply as Seamus pulled a piece of parchment out. “Aren't that many of us.” Harry watched from the corner of his eye as Seamus started writing down names.
Draco had been hesitant, even as he'd accepted it, but he’d ended up liking it. He got to be in a back room almost all the time, working on potions and creating things, almost never interacting with customers. His favorite part was that he was able to invent new potions or concoctions to sell in the store.
“So, it's like... it's pretty clear you
"How could you not? You're constantly watching him." Harry flipped Ron off and kept his head down as he ate.
There was nothing
. Why hadn't he just listened to Malfoy and snuck off to one of their normal spots? They'd never once been caught or seen. Malfoy was never going to speak to him again, and certainly never sleep with him. Not to mention he would have to explain that he'd been snogging Malfoy (and perhaps a bit more than that) to his best friends. Harry looked closer at his plate and ignored the eyes that had turned to him. “Mate!” Ron yelled. “Were you going to tell me you were snogging one of our roommates? Or that you're snogging blokes at all?” Harry just shrugged without looking up.
“Get over yourself, Potter. The world isn't here just to adore you.” Harry stood up, still smiling.
“Draco's just being the prick he always has been. Thought he'd grown out of it a tiny bit, but clearly not,” Ron growled. Draco just rolled his eyes. He noticed Harry glance around the common room like he was looking for something, then brought his attention back to them. He was finally smiling, if only a small raise of his mouth.
Weasley agreed, quickly grabbing it to test it out. Harry protested, but didn't stop him. It dawned on Draco that there was a set of eyes on him, and Harry was definitely paying attention to Weasley. He looked up as subtly as he could to find Granger scrutinizing him. Her eyes flicked from Harry to Draco like she was processing something. He snapped his eyes down to his parchment, where he hadn't written anything since the Golden Trio had started talking.
If you told the Prophet, a professor, anyone, that you suspected me of something, it'd be over. I'm on such thin ice already, a comment from you would destroy everything I have left. It wouldn't matter that it isn't true.” Harry was surprised to hear the man speaking so openly and candidly. This was not something they ever had done before, or that Harry would have ever expected they would. Harry took a while staring at him, never having a chance to be this close. Eventually, he nodded.
“Name someone that fights as much as you two.” He was already starting to get very tired of the Weaselette's sudden challenges. He tried to think quickly.
Malfoy had turned his attention to the bird, but looked back up at Harry. "Um. No. He's one of the school's." Harry nodded. "I was never allowed to have one." Harry narrowed his eyes.
“Oh, I just thought it made sense to give it to the best Quidditch player at Hogwarts.” Ron grinned when Ginny flushed and widened her eyes. She awkwardly cleared her throat.
Of course he knew that. How could he not? It had been plastered in the Daily Prophet for the entire week leading up to it. Not to mention that people kept talking about it. Like it was some public holiday for them to celebrate.
“It was a birthday gift.” Granger's confusion doubled.
“Well, who is it, then?” Seamus asked.
“Shut up. I meant why on Earth would you... like me?” Harry finally looked at him, quirking an eyebrow.
“Such a sensitive girlfriend,” Blaise teased. Pansy merely shrugged.
“What might that be?”
Harry glowered at the fire burning across from him. It was a nice night, he had no homework or essay to work on, and his two best friends in the world were sitting next to him. He should be having fun. He should be having a nice night. So why couldn't he stop
“Erm. Well, sure. You're on.”
“I don't know, fighting? Insulting each other?” He noticed the Weaselette doing that God damn sarcastic head nod.
“Can I have a biscuit?” Draco was impressed when Harry only laughed at Teddy’s impressive puppy-dog eyes.
“I think I'm the only one who's going to tell you to stop being an ass, even though we're all thinking it.” Harry's glare returned full force. Draco could hear that everyone in the common room had stopped talking. Without looking away from Harry's eyes, he knew they were all staring at him.
Draco shook his head and calmly returned to his Charms assignment a few chairs away. He knew plenty of people were still staring at him, but he ignored them in favor of his homework.
“Must be a secret admirer,” Weasley guessed. Harry had certainly received plenty of gifts from them.
“What would be different in this other world?”
“Why am I flirting?” Harry laughed without humor. “Well, Draco. You see, when a wizard likes another wizard, that's usually how they communicate it to them.” Draco could tell he was being overly-sarcastic to cover his embarrassment. He was far too familiar with the tactic.
The cool air blew Harry's robes open. He pulled them tighter around his body, trying to keep out the winter air. It was one of the first nice days in a while, and Harry was enjoying it. He was happy to take some time for himself and enjoy the quiet for once.
“Nothing important.”
“Look at us,” he repeated. Neither of them said anything for a while. Draco studied the water as he continued picking the weed apart. If someone had told him a year ago that this is where he would end up, Draco wouldn't have believed them. Calmly enjoying a view of the lake at Hogwarts with none other than Harry Potter.
“Right. Obviously not me or Ron. It's probably not Neville-”
Harry hadn’t been able to help it. Since Malfoy had walked into the Great Hall in September with a strange smile Harry had never seen, he’d barely been able to keep his eyes off him. Every time Harry studied him, he found something new – a birthmark on Malfoy’s neck, how Malfoy’s smile was warm now, the rings he wore. The way Malfoy’s body moved while flying, the way he bit his lip when he wrote notes, the way he got absorbed in a book until he was lost to the world. The way he finally looked
“He... he told you that?”
Ron sighed in relief, and Hermione suggested he talk to the mind Healer that was now employed full-time at the school, and Harry smiled vaguely and nodded when it felt right.
“I'll only ask this once, then I'll leave it. You sure you're okay?” Draco nodded slowly.
"Oh. Harry." He flushed slightly, but continued petting the owl.
I locked the door."
“No, I just...” He sighed. He had not met Draco's eyes since the beginning of the conversation. “You are the only person I know that doesn't like me.” Draco scoffed.
“Hmm?” He looked up to see the eyes of the girls around him – Cho, Parvarti, and Weaselette– all looking at him for an answer.
But Weasley nodded enthusiastically. “Sure. That makes sense.” Her voice verged on sounding like she didn't think it did. “We were wondering more about how you knew what kind of party Harry would enjoy?” The unspoken
“Nope. I'm still here,” Harry answered before Draco could, popping into the living room. He saw the confusion flash across his Aunt's face before she smiled gratefully at both of them.
And when Harry risked his life to pull Draco from a raging fire, testified for him at his trials, forgave him easily, and saved the entire world from what Draco had resigned to be inevitable, what was Draco supposed to do?
“They didn't... it wasn't about the war or dark mark or anything, was it?” His voice was deathly low, and Draco knew he would snap if he answered yes to that. His heart started doing flips, but he mentally berated himself. It had nothing to do with him personally. Harry was just too fucking nice to allow that. To anyone.
Malfoy sat up and rolled his eyes. “Flattery won't get you out of this.” He moved back so Harry could sit up properly. “My fault really. Why would I trust you to handle the spells?” It stung, but Harry knew he deserved it. He'd really messed up.
"I don't know what he's up to."
Due to all of the events during their schooling distracting them – the Chamber of Secrets mess, dealing with Umbridge, and the final year with Death Eaters who bordered on torturing students on a regular basis, to name a few – any current Hogwarts student was welcome to return over the summer to catch up on their studies before completing their final year.
“Yes, Draco. Just like practically every weekend since you've started working here, students bought a bunch of love potions. Stop pretending you hate the smell of yours. I'm ninety percent sure that's impossible.” Draco just made the same face again at George and went into his workshop without responding.
“Well. I'll see you around, I guess.”
“All right. You can have one biscuit.” Teddy started to cheer, but Harry continued. “After you clean up the living room.” Teddy bolted out of the door as soon as Harry had finished his sentence.
Harry hadn't noticed the blond turning the corner into the courtyard where he was sitting, but Draco had most certainly noticed Harry Potter talking to someone who was clearly a reporter. Venting. Angrily. Everyone knew that Harry avoided talking to the press at all costs, so why would he be sitting in the courtyard chatting with a reporter?
"Oh. You're stalking all of us, then?" Harry threw his pillow at Ron's face, but he just laughed.
Malfoy was smart. Harry had always known that, to some degree. He was second in the class, just behind Hermione. Harry was used to seeing him scoring well on tests. When they were young, he was smug and loud about it. He did just as well now – often better – yet he never bragged anymore.
“What about him?” The reporter scooted forward.
But he hadn't. Malfoy had known what it meant to Harry, had put away all his Slytherin pride and years of rivalry and put himself out on the line to make amends. All for Harry.
“Do tell, Malfoy: what was that before?” Draco didn't even pay attention to who was taunting him now. He stormed out of his chair and the common room, muttering something about idiots and not answering to them. He could hear Hermione chastising them as he left.
"Yeah. A lot simpler." Harry studied him again, his soft smile and the gentle hand moving through the feathers, the tie hanging loose around his neck. When Malfoy looked up again, Harry turned so he couldn't see his red face. "See you around, Malfoy.”
"Harry." He looked up to find both Ron and Hermione studying him curiously.
“Harry, you could ruin me today if you wanted to.” Harry's breath stuck in his throat.
“Oh, I apologize. I didn't realize you owned the library tables.” Draco's glare hardened further, but Potter was already turning back to his book.
"Harry." Harry stilled at the voice he couldn't stop thinking about. When he turned around, Malfoy was holding up a Gryffindor tie. "You dropped this." Harry frowned down at his bag to see his tie was no longer where he had stuffed it in a side pocket.
The Prophet had certainly tried to make some romances – anytime Harry was seen alone in public with Ginny, the paper had a field day on the two getting back together. Never mind the fact that the two were obviously still good friends and the Burrow was Harry's second home.
“Wh- of course he does.” Draco rolled his eyes, just now seeing the cake.
Outside of the Owlery, he slowed to a normal pace. Malfoy didn't notice him right away. He was sitting on one of the stools with a small brown owl sitting on his arm.
“You sit next to me in review sessions. You study with me in the library. You walk the halls with me.” Harry waited for him to continue, but he didn't.
“Did he... did he actually say we were...”
“Teddy! How are you?” Teddy started a long rant about what he and Potter had been doing so far that day, which apparently included dancing, hide and go seek, and pretending to be dinosaurs – not that Draco knew what that meant. But Draco nodded and smiled enthusiastically.
Harry figured he'd have to have another conversation with Malfoy at some point, but he wasn't expecting it to be immediately after breakfast. The blond was sitting against the window right outside the Great Hall, but jumped to his feet when the Gryffindor troop entered the hall.
“What's got you riled up all of a sudden?”
When Harry called them to the kitchen half an hour later, Draco was surprised to see an actual meal laid out. He had no idea why, but he had assumed Harry couldn't cook and would make a frozen dinner or something in the microwave.
“He seems well. He clearly enjoys spending time with Teddy.” His mother nodded again and gave him a smile that made him wonder what she was thinking about.
“That was really nice of you. Kind of uncharacteristically, you know?” Draco already had excuses for that. He wasn't an idiot.
Harry had surprised just about everyone after finishing Hogwarts by not becoming an Auror, or Professor, or pro Quidditch player. Instead, he'd started a private business that monitored the Ministry of Magic for dark magic, inappropriate behavior, or anything disreputable. It was something no one had seen coming, but Draco knew it made sense as soon as he heard it. Harry didn't want to run around catching more bad guys, he wanted to make sure the bad guys weren't in power like they had been during the war. Draco knew as well as anyone that if the Death Eaters – and those who abused their power, like Umbridge – hadn't been in control just before and during the war, everything would have been different.
It was mostly because of this that Ron was polite enough to Malfoy and honored the truce. He certainly wasn't his friend and he still didn't understand it, but if Harry asked him to be nice, he could.
“Oh.” Her intense stare didn't change. “You're saying you didn't get him anything else?” Draco finally turned back to his plate, shaking his head.
lucky, but he definitely didn't think Malfoy would be raring to go as soon as he walked in. “I- you aren't mad?” Malfoy shook his head. One of his hands lazily traced Harry's sides.
“You didn't ask to be a Death Eater anymore than I asked to be the Chosen One.”
It was silent in the library, save for the scratching of quills against parchments and the ever-annoying Weasley drumming his fingers on the table.
It was a surprising partnership, but one that worked well nonetheless. George handled the fun, quirky side – organizing the store, interacting with customers, and coming up with imaginative new ideas. Draco handled the practical side of actually making most of the products and creating the new ideas George came up with. He also reeled George in on ideas that were too wild, impossible, or simply not cost-effective.
“What do you think, Draco?”
He had just pulled the curtains around his bed closed when Malfoy yanked them back. “Fucking prick,” Malfoy muttered, even as he moved to straddle the brunette.
“Draco Malfoy, I have never known you to be humble.”
“I will admit, this is going better than I had hoped.” ...
“Yeah. They can go a little overboard.” He put his hands behind him and leaned on to them, looking up at the night sky. It was a cloudy night with not many visible stars. If Draco had been alone, he would have gone in by now. He didn't actually want to get in trouble for being out after curfew for no reason, and he had calmed down by this point. But, for reasons he didn't particularly want to think about, this scene wasn't something he wanted to walk away from.
Harry removed the cloak just outside of the common room, and Draco followed directly behind him. The common room fell to silence at the sudden appearance of the two, more than an hour after curfew.
"What?"
“We should get inside,” Draco stated the obvious. Harry nodded, unfolding the cloak with one snap of his wrists. He looked back to the blond.
It was two weeks until Christmas break, and Ron hadn't found
The day flew by as Draco stocked the store up on the needed product. The easier items – like Puking Pastiles – were so simple and repetitive that Draco practically made them without thinking. With a few hours left in the day started off on creating George's new ideas. He began with the basics of a Draught of Peace, but tweaked a few of the ingredients. By the end of the day, Draco felt like he'd had some success with his experimentation. It would likely take weeks of testing, of course, but it was good progress for the first day.
“'S my cake.”
He held up a finger to the owl, as if the creature could understand the gesture. It almost seemed like she did; she stopped tapping and sat patiently on the windowsill.
Hermione and Ron exchanged a glance, then Hermione gestured with her chin towards Harry. Ron sighed.
“So stop dieting,” Blaise said simply. Pansy's expression turned to disgusted.
“Yeah. Of course.”
“I've certainly told you we need to break into new markets. This could be a good start.” George grinned again. He was always happier when he didn't need to pester and convince Draco for weeks. “A confidence potion would be a best-seller, if we were able to perfect it.”
It was just down the hall from George’s office, in the floor above the store itself. Sometimes Draco wished it was a little farther away from George, but they’d come up with a system that worked for them; if Draco left the door of his workshop closed, George wouldn’t bother him. If it was open, the Weasley felt free to come waltzing in just to annoy Draco, or let him in on a ridiculous pun he’d just come up with.
“Why are you calling him that?” They both looked down at Teddy's pout.
look at Malfoy.
“Malfoy,” Potter said after a moment of shocked silence, clearly confused.
“You are definitely a masochist. You enjoy being insulted and bullied, and you refuse to stop getting in trouble.” Harry made an over-the-top thinking face.
Not because he was avoiding the love potions or anything, he started by working on the confidence potion first. The book he'd read on his day off had given him a few new ideas that he was excited to try. He had a long parchment with lists of ideas, a quill ready to put an X beside them when they failed, and notes if they gave him any insight.
“Oddly, they didn't leave a name. They just left it for me to find.” It looked like Granger could not possibly be more confused.
“What?” Harry shrugged, but Draco noticed a slight tremble in his fingers as he turned the cloak over and over in his hands. Harry Potter was nervous.
It was ten minutes before he could no longer stop himself from glancing up. Just like he’d known, Malfoy was reading the paper. He traced his fingers along his lip as he read, deep in thought. Harry wanted to know what he was reading, what was going through his brain, what his lips must feel like-
All Malfoy wanted to do was win them over so Harry could tell them they were together. He didn't want Harry to...
“Yes?”
Fuck.
Eventually, Harry nodded. That was undoubtedly what the blond was working on.
There was an awkward silence. Malfoy noted the questioning expressions and confused looks among them.
“Well. No war, of course. No death. Just normal kids going to Hogwarts. We still have our rivalry, but it's friendly. Innocent. When I realize that I don't hate you, not at all – when I realize that my flushed face and flipping stomach and racing heart when you’re near me are for entirely opposite reasons – I don't feel like an idiot. I feel like... me and you, we're possible.” After a silent moment, Draco spoke again, still very softly.
“So, Harry.” Ginny brought the attention back to him. “Now that you've finally stopped being an idiot, what are you going to do?” Harry shrugged once again.
Ron definitely wasn't into blokes, but he could see what Mal-
. He mentally berated himself for interrupting the genuine moment, probably the first one he'd ever had with Malfoy, with his incessant fantasies. “You're the reason we're not in Azkaban.” Harry's inappropriate thoughts faded.
"Oh. Thank you." Harry studied him for a moment, trying to think of something,
“What the hell does it look like?” Draco continued staring at the boy who had just plopped down at the other end of his table. He had already started writing on a piece of parchment, not even glancing up at Draco. Draco huffed when Potter refused to respond any further.
watching Malfoy." He frowned when he realized he had just admitted to watching Malfoy.
“You all right, Draco?” George asked when Draco walked into work the next day. He sat down across from George on the other side of his desk.
need?” Draco rolled his eyes. None of his friends stayed off his back about his perpetually single state. Apparently not even his business partner.
“Oh, just take it already,” Harry said with an eye roll. He turned around to grab the broom, handing it over to Ginny. She looked up at Malfoy again.
“Harry...” Hermione said softly from beside him. Harry didn't bother looking at her.
“Probably worried,” Draco admitted. “We had dinner. With Teddy, of course. He told me it was good to see me. And... Teddy asked me to come back next week when he'd be there.”
Draco sighed as he turned the shower up a little hotter. It was the first time in ages he'd thought about Harry in the shower. It had happened constantly when he'd first moved in, knowing that Harry had lived in the apartment for two years before giving it to Draco. But here he was again, picturing Harry naked in his shower. The good thing – or was it terribly pathetic? - was that usually it wasn't even particularly sexual. Just Harry showering.
"Oh. Really?"
thanked for that.” Ron cringed. But he had to know why they were
"Um, yeah. We are. Aren't we?" His best friends exchanged a look.
“Malfoy-”
“Nothing.” Draco raised an eyebrow.
holiday, not Potter's.
“Fine. Had trouble sleeping last night.” George made a vague hmm noise. “Anything new?” George handed him a sheet with their current inventory so Draco would know what Potions or other items needed made. They were mostly low on Portable Swamps and Puking Pastiles.
“I will never understand you two.”
“Noooo, Uncle Draco!” Teddy whined. He tugged on Draco's robes as he pouted. He slowly transformed until a miniature Draco was staring up at him. Draco sighed. Teddy knew nothing won him over like turning into Draco's spitting image.
“The Potter look,” Blaise answered. “The one you only wear whenever he's around or you're thinking about him. Which hasn't been all that much recently, so where did you see him?”
As the days and weeks went on, it continued. Potter would hover near Draco. They'd made something of a tentative truce, but they certainly weren't friends, which made it strange that Potter seemed intent on staying near Draco. For a while, he wondered if this was another version of Potter creeping around like in sixth year, but he didn't seem to be monitoring Draco or acting suspicious of him. He was just... around.
“You boys are so kind to me.” She patted them both on their backs.
Draco looked up from his potion at the tapping on his window. “Damn it,” he whispered. He was in the middle of an important step. If he stepped away from the cauldron, even just to let the owl in, it could mess it up.
Ron took a deep breath. He started to go back to bed – he'd really seen and heard all his heart could take, to be honest – when Harry said his name.
“What?” Ginny just shook her head.
Draco couldn't help but pretend it would be for what he knew it wasn't, that Harry wanted to declare his undying love for Draco. He'd been nervous for several days wondering what Harry Potter could possibly want to discuss after barely speaking for two years since graduating. His mind had come up with a dozen possibilities, but all of them were completely unrealistic. The only ones he thought might be possible were that it was something about Teddy, that he actually wanted to reconcile their issues because it had been bothering his ridiculous Hero complex, or that he had some concern about George or the shop.
“No. I did not get him the stupid quill.” His voice was firm and steady, but Ginny smiled like a loon.
“You boys should be the ones enjoying life. Go on and head home, my dears. Thank you for everything.” She gave a kiss on the cheek to Harry and Draco before leading them out of the house.
“Draco...” Daphne started softly.
about it.
"I was just looking. Seeing what everyone's doing."
It bothered Hermione almost as much as him for the first few weeks, trying to figure out just what Malfoy's plan was. But after a certain point, she seemed to accept that he was just trying to be nice. Anytime Ron would bring it up she'd roll her eyes.
Finally, he could focus.
“I thought she might appreciate a second chance at that great night. With you, this time.” Ron blinked at the boy before him. It was thoughtful, and sentimental, and something he knew, without a doubt in his mind, Hermione would appreciate. It was exactly what he'd been looking for.
“I'm not sure whether to be proud of you or worried for you.”
“Ginny, I was wondering if you would want this.” He lifted his hand that was holding the package.
"I mean, we have a family owl. But he's not a
“Draco, I thought you had plans tonight!”
“How was your book club?” Draco asked. Andromeda smiled widely.
“You always carry your cloak with you, then?” Harry's mouth opened in shock, then he saw where it was in his hand and grinned, moving to fold it up.
“You really think the Golden Boy would say that about his friends? Of course not. I was just annoyed.”
“Draco, what are you doing out here?” Draco closed his eyes. Maybe if he ignored him and couldn't see him, he would disappear. “Draco?” he opened his eyes to Harry, looking concerned. “Are you all right?”
“I admit it might be a bit... over the top. But you probably haven't paid attention to him lately.” Draco held in a snort. There hadn't been a time in his life he hadn't paid attention to Potter. “He's been moping around the past few days. He doesn't listen to anyone when they show appreciation for what he's done, and nothing we say has been able to cheer him up! We just wanted to really show him how much he means to everyone.”
"You think he's noticed?" Harry glared when Ron burst out laughing.
But as his last year of school came to a close, Draco realized that he had no other idea of what he wanted to do. Sure, he was intelligent and had scored very well on his N.E.W.T.s. But he didn't want to work for the Ministry (perhaps he would have been more inclined had he known about Potter's plans to regulate it). He wasn't sure who would hire him, and he certainly didn't think anyone would trust him to make Potions for them. He couldn't imagine becoming a professor. He considered Healer, textbook writer, and a dozen other jobs, but none of them seemed right. As every job he thought of fell apart, Draco had turned back to George.
“Well, kind of. Never know when you'll need it. But I wasn't doing anything wrong. I just went for a visit to Hagrid's. Wasn't sure if I'd be back before curfew.
Worry that Ron – Hermione wasn't really the concern, he knew that – wouldn't be a good enough friend to accept that Malfoy was, apparently, what made Harry happy.
“Uncle Draco!”
After his lunch break, he knew he had to make the love potions. The potions were much weaker than Amortentia, of course. They would only last an hour, perhaps two if the victim was small. After a lot of outcry – mostly from Granger and Harry – they had adjusted the recipe so that it wouldn’t make anyone do anything they didn’t want to do. All it really did was enhance the giver’s best traits and make the receiver more eager to admit their feelings and act on them.
Did he for some unknown reason actually... want to be friends? He had come to accept Malfoy's truce, but the idea that the blond would want to be friends with him was far too ridiculous.
When Draco entered 12 Grimmauld place, he didn't even pay attention as Kreacher took his robes and greeted him. He collapsed on the couch and asked Kreacher for a cup of tea.
“Harry. Eat something.” Hermione dropped a forkful of sausage on his plate unceremoniously. He tore his eyes away to pile his plate. He forced himself to be a part of his friend’s conversation and eat and
The whole thing delighted Harry more than made sense.
“Harry, can I talk to you?” Malfoy asked immediately. Harry's friends continued walking without a moment's hesitation, leaving them alone. Harry nodded. Without a word, the two started walking down the hall in the opposite direction. It was a while before Malfoy said anything, but Harry waited patiently.
Mondays were usually Draco's day to relax. He spent the morning focused on the project he'd been working on for some time. After being unable to solve the issue with magic for a year, he had relented and found some books on the muggle way to fix it. He'd read the books, talked with some experts, and had recently started actually working on it. He'd been worried the magic would reject it – even the muggle method of fixing it – but there hadn't been any issues so far.
Draco started taking care of the dishes without a word.
against his shoulder.
“Malfoy?” Ron asked with obvious confusion. Draco didn't look up.
“We were asking who you think will be on the Slytherin team this year.”
“That's what they were annoying me about.”
“You're such a git.” Hermione and Ron didn't chastise Draco when they realized Harry was slightly grinning at him. Grinning. He hadn't grinned in days.
', I will physically fight you.” Harry grinned.
Harry followed without any idea where Draco was leading him.
“It's all right, Hermione. I know the other person isn't going to cave, so I doubt they'll figure it out. They'll get bored by the end of tonight.”
“You know what I mean!” Harry just continued looking at him with the same quirked eyebrow. Draco sighed. “You want me to say it? I was a Death Eater and you're the Chosen One.” Harry's expression turned sad.
“But... then the war came, and we couldn't just be two dumb kids teasing one another. We both did what we needed to do to save people we cared about and end the war. You proved that you
“Or did you meet someone else?” Daphne asked, her voice slipping to excitement. Even though Daphne was also single and had been for some time, she was adamant on Draco trying to find someone. Particularly someone who had a chance of returning his feelings. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Draco, you continue to surprise me. I had no idea you were so perverted!” Draco flushed and glared across the desk. “A fun idea, but no. I was thinking more of, like... a date night line? My first idea was a bit of a confidence potion. A little more than a Draught of Peace that only dulls the anxiety.” Draco nodded, intrigued. His mind was already racing to think of what ingredients would be needed to create that.
“Not really.” After a moment, Harry sat down next to him anyway. He noticed that Harry's hand disappeared into seemingly nowhere. “What are you doing? Or, what have you been doing?”
“I wasn't
“Ron. Have you bought your gift for Hermione already?” Ron flushed, both embarrassed and angry.
“But I
He met Harry's eyes. Harry was his best friend in the entire world, even before his girlfriend. Harry had always been there for him, even when he was a dick and an idiot and a git. He'd saved him from being poisoned, almost immediately accepted him back every time Ron betrayed him or was completely unreasonable, defended him whenever anyone insulted the Weasley name, and patiently let him take years to finally make a move on Hermione.
He'd just spent the evening with Harry Potter after barely speaking to him in years. Draco took a deep breath.
, Teddy?”
The Prophet hadn't really mentioned it, but Draco had heard the rumors that Harry must be dating people in the muggle world. Whether it was actually Muggles, or witches he took there, no one was sure. If there had been any witches, Draco was impressed. Either the witches were loyal, honest people, or Harry had somehow convinced them not to say anything to the press.
He just smiled. Definitely a masochist.
And he wasn't blushing. Malfoys didn't blush.
"I don't look at him all that much," he mumbled. When he glanced up, this time actually to see if Malfoy was paying attention, he found Malfoy studying him with an unhappy expression. He immediately snapped his eyes back down and kept his eyes glued on his plate. He refused to look in Malfoy's direction the rest of the meal.
“Goodness,” Malfoy drawled. “We were wondering when someone would catch on. Never thought it would take six months.” The deafening silence that followed almost made Harry laugh. He could feel the eyes of the rest of Common Room, no one bothering to hide that they were eavesdropping anymore. Harry met Malfoy's eye again with a slight grin and found that Malfoy was clearly just as amused by the strange sputtering sound Ron was making.
"You don't actually think he's up to something, do you?" Harry turned red as he snapped his eyes away from Malfoy. He shrugged.
“Exactly why I'm doing this,” he muttered. Granger set down the cake they must have just brought up from the kitchens on the coffee table.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. Ron nodded.
anything, and I knew that. But if you weren't my enemy, how could I... obsess over you?” Malfoy- Draco stopped walking suddenly. Harry took a few more steps before stopping, too. “I haven't been trying to figure out what you're up to. I've been imagining a world where things were different.”
“Goodnight, ferret,” Harry called as he left.
But it was their first Christmas as a couple, and he wanted something really special. He knew people didn't think of him as intelligent, and definitely not sensitive. He figured Hermione didn't expect any thoughtful kind of present from him. Which was exactly why he knew he needed to give her just that.
“Speaking of couples that need to just bang and get it over with...” Seamus started ominously, definitely louder. “We're all a little sick of watching you two and your hormones, Malfoy.” It took Draco a few moments to register that he'd said his name.
“You stalk me in sixth year. Attack me with a violent spell for no real reason. Risk your life to save mine in the Battle of Hogwarts. Defend me in my trials. Tell everyone I'm innocent. Come back to Hogwarts and watch me again, looking for anything I'm doing wrong. Make it seem like you don’t even hate me anymore when we talk. Then fervently defend me again to a Prophet reporter.”
“You want to know what Draco’s doing?”
“So. Anyway. I was wondering. If you or your mother want it, I'd be happy to give it to you.” The entire time Harry was talking, it hadn't even really occurred to him that his mother was a Black. That he was a Black. He had stared at Harry in surprise until Harry flushed and started mumbling about him not having to take it.
But after changing his mind a dozen times, he headed to breakfast early. There was almost no one there, just some of the professors and a random scattering of students. Only three people sat at the Slytherin table – a group of maybe third years that Draco had seen but knew nothing about. He made a beeline to them, correctly guessing that they would have a copy of that day's paper. He cleared his throat, and they all looked up at him.
“Who the hell do you think-”
Harry gulped. “I... I'm sorry. I
“You're the only worthy opponent, probably in the whole school.” Ron's arrogant face faltered at the seemingly sincere compliment from their once rival.
Draco kissed Harry gently, somehow better than every fantasy Harry had imagined. It wasn't wild and frenzied, it was soft and proper and so very
The living room was a clutter of toys and books, and for some reason the couch pillows on the floor. Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter. “You really are having fun.” Potter gave a ghost of the trademark grin Draco hadn't seen in so long.
Malfoy had clearly been trying to win Hermione, Ron, and Ginny over. But
“What?”
“I don't know why you think I saw him. I didn't even sit down before you accosted me.” Daphne sighed.
"Need to mail a letter."
“We thought that, maybe, you aren't sure how to deal with your life changing so abruptly to a world without Death Eaters and Voldemort, and being without someone to fight makes you feel useless?” Harry considered that for a while.
When they didn't say anything, Draco tried to ignore them. Even though he was reading – or trying to – he could see them having some kind of discussion silently. There were hand movements and gestures and eventually Ginny grunted when Hermione must have elbowed her. After that, they tried to act normally and started filling up their plates.
Harry grinned widely. “You love it,” he whispered as he pulled the curtains tight against the bed. Malfoy gave a non-committal grunt as his lips found Harry's neck. Harry quickly flicked his wand to cast the necessary spells.
“I got tickets to the Chudley match in two weeks. Can you think of a way to ask him to go that won't make him think I'm trying to kidnap him?” Harry laughed. “I was thinking I could just give them to you and him, but, still. That will come across too suspicious.”
“You vouched for him at his trial, Harry.” Harry's heart skipped a beat. That was exactly the sort of thing he preferred ignoring, pretending it hadn't happened. And it certainly was not something he wanted his friends to bring up. “You told the entire Wizarding World that he was not a real Death Eater, that he didn't deserve punishment, that you believed he wasn't a danger to anyone.” Harry turned back to the fire, not having anything worth saying to that.
Draco hurried back to his room and spent the rest of the day sick with worry about what Harry could have possibly said to the reporter. It could have been about anything. Maybe the reporter just wouldn't leave Harry alone about his personal life and Harry was telling him to fuck off. The reporter was making up something about Harry’s friends and he was defending them. He was arguing about something the reporter had said about Dumbledore.
Draco set the tea down. He'd finished the cup without even noticing he was drinking it. Now that he'd spent a few hours with Harry – eating dinner with him, talking to him, seeing that damn grin – he could sense his feelings coming back full-force.
Harry nodded. “Teddy was perfect, as always.”
“I'm sorry, Harry.” He looked up to see his friend looking at him sympathetically. “I... I shouldn't have said anything. It's really none of our business unless you want to tell us.” Harry shrugged.
“Well. It's too bad you didn't get it for him.” Hermione wasn't sarcastic, just very pointed and slow. “It's one of his favorite gifts. He loves it.”
But no matter how much he tried to convince himself that it probably had nothing to do with him, he didn't believe it in the slightest.
Did they have something he wanted? Ron had been racking his brain for ages, but couldn't think of anything. Was he trying to get the Golden Trio to let down their guard? It was possible, but again, why? Even Ron could admit that there was no realistic way Malfoy could do anything evil at Hogwarts – he had tracking spells placed on him, a parole officer, and all of his spells were monitored. He had to follow strict parole guidelines until he left Hogwarts in a few months.
“My- what in the hell are you talking about?” Hermione did what she could to turn and glare at Seamus, but it wasn't very effective with the loaf on top of her. Seamus rolled his eyes.
Malfoy.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Potter said before Teddy could whine again. “I think there's room enough for all of us.”
“That was also a very nice gift you gave him for his birthday.” Draco was proud that he was able to keep his face blank, not a trace of flush. He quirked one eyebrow, but Ginny answered for him.
In the morning, Draco was torn between going to breakfast as soon as he could, waiting until breakfast was almost over, or just grabbing something from the kitchens and avoiding the Great Hall – and whatever story the Daily Prophet had undoubtedly printed – altogether.
a door-locking?”
Someone in Potter's group mentioned presents, and the few around them cheered for Potter and Longbottom to open their gifts. The rest of the room joined in as Weasley and Thomas grabbed several piles of presents and dropped them on the table in front of Potter and Longbottom.
“If you aren't doing anything, what do you care that I'm paying attention to you?”
Malfoy returned the smile. “Exactly that.” Harry nodded.
“What? When?” Draco asked without looking up. He quickly cast a warming spell on his hands, cursing himself for forgetting his gloves.
“Of course.” Harry checked the bedroom door before moving forward and kissing Draco sweetly. Draco blushed when he pulled back. Harry lightly touched his red cheek, then turned away to dig through his trunk.
“What, the button? I guess it amused Harry.” Hermione continued meeting Draco's eyes.
Ron looked up at a throat clearing. Malfoy was standing behind Harry with a large package in his hand. Ron raised an eyebrow at him.
"No, I haven't," he grumbled. Hermione hesitated before turning back to her parchment. It was bullshit, and he knew that, and he knew
“Forever the Golden Boy.” After Malfoy squeezed his shoulder, he turned and walked away. Harry unabashedly watched him retreat – specifically his ass – until he was out of sight down the hallway. When he was gone, Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.
-Thomas a Kempis
“You know exactly what to say to cheer me up or piss me off or get me to do something, even when no one else does. They told me how you saved my birthday party from them; my best friends in the world didn't get it after weeks of me trying so hard to get them to understand, but I talk to you for five minutes and you did. You see me.” Harry somehow leaned even closer. Draco could feel his breath against his lips as he continued speaking.
“You're welcome... Hermione.” Ginny started, but Hermione smacked her again. He had to admit, despite the fact that she had punched him once, she had always been the most tolerable of them. She was at least intelligent and mostly reasonable. Ginny started to get up, but stopped when she noticed Hermione still sitting. She clearly had more to ask, judging by her face. Ginny slowly sat back down.
“Wh- oh, Malfoy?” Teddy nodded, making a face.
"Harry, I really don't think he's doing anything wrong. I think he's just here to graduate."
“You're way too intelligent and interesting for me. You may have liked the spotlight when you were younger, but now you hate it just as much as I do. Even if the attention is positive. You're brave and ambitious and don't take the easy way out.”
“Would have had a lot more without you interrupting.” Harry's voice was calm. He was proud of how unaffected he was able to appear. Ron and Seamus both laughed, but stared at him expectantly. “Dinner?” He asked, his voice calm even though his heart was hammering. He started walking to the Common Room exit before they could respond.
For Harry? Yeah, he could be.
“Very well, Weasley.” He hesitated a moment, then decided he needed to be more civil if he ever wanted to be accepted back into society. “And you?”
Of course, he'd
“Lasagna!” Teddy cried happily as they sat down to dinner. Draco sat down to a plate of lasagna that looked just as good as what they might serve at Hogwarts, or the manor growing up.
for Hermione yet. He'd already gotten her a few things, of course. There were her favorite sweets from Honeydukes, a small stuffed cat that vaguely looked like Crookshanks, and a quill similar to a Quick Notes Quill. This one wrote anything spoken word for word, perfect for Hermione's thoughtful ramblings or taking notes. He knew she would love all of them, and would certainly be happy if that was all she got.
“There are people in the common room. Meet me somewhere else.” His face flushed, as if he was afraid the people 50 feet away and through a door could hear them. Harry bit his lip and turned his bedroom eyes up a notch. Or two. Malfoy gulped.
Malfoy was standing next to him in the nearly empty hallway. “Can I talk to you?”
“Are you serious? That must have cost a small fortune. And they didn't even take credit?”
But then Harry was kissing him, and he wasn't even sure what his heart was doing anymore. It was hard to ignore it when Harry slowly moved his lips against his, his hand gently traced his stomach up to his chest, his other hand found the back of his neck. Draco roughly shoved both hands into that stupid messy hair of his, the stupid hair he'd definitely never daydreamed about running his hands through. It was upsetting when he felt the lips disappear, until they reappeared against his neck.
"Merlin, Harry. Do you think he's blind?" Harry ducked his head down even further.
Draco smiled. “
“Yes.” Draco stared him down, wondering if Harry was about to punch him. Harry clenched his fist like he was considering it. After a long-drawn-out staring contest, Harry suddenly stormed off into the dorms.
.           .           .           .           .              .               .
Before Draco could respond, Teddy had reappeared in the kitchen and was grabbing Harry’s hand to drag him to the ‘clean’ living room.
He quickly looked around the room, almost immediately noting that Harry's bed was empty. He let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. Harry must have woken him up when he went to the bathroom.
“To be fair,” Neville interjected, “that's not that far off from how you showed your affection for Hermione for a long time.” He gave a pointed look to Ron.
.” Draco made a face.
When Ron told Harry, his best friend had calmly tried to get him to see Malfoy's side of things – Voldemort in his house, fearing for his family's life, seeing how the Death Eaters tortured those who didn't obey. It took a while, several long conversations where Harry refused to give in, before Ron relented that he would
Whenever Potter sat near or walked with him, Draco would look at him pointedly with a raised eyebrow. But Potter never gave any explanation. Never even seemed to notice Draco's confusion. Draco would occasionally shoot a halfhearted insult at him, and Potter would respond with a slight smirk and a snappy comeback, but none of the words held much bite.
“I don't know. Maybe,” he relented so they would stop asking him questions and getting closer to the truth he didn't even want to admit to himself.
When Harry checked the map after dinner, he saw Malfoy alone in one of the abandoned classrooms. It was clear he was waiting for him, even though they didn't have plans to meet tonight. He stowed the map and headed out before any of his friends could be suspicious of where he was going. Harry found Malfoy charming a lone feather to float in patterns in front of him, sitting on the abandoned desk. Harry's cloak was folded neatly beside him. “Hey.” Malfoy nodded at him, slowly charming the feather to the ground. “I'm... I'm really sorry. I should have listened to you.”
He straightened in his seat. Most of those returning over the summer - Potter, Weasley, and Draco included – knew they would be too busy with school to focus on Quidditch. His mind ran over the students that were left.
It was a while later, after enough time to calm down, that Harry walked out of the bedrooms with his head held high. Ron was sitting in a chair facing the bedrooms, and he perked up when Harry walked out. Seamus, who Ron must have been talking to, looked on in interest. “Have fun, Harry?” Ron asked innocently.
"We just… we don't want another year of Malfoy obsession." Harry flushed and looked down at his parchment.
Harry hopped up from his seat, waltzed over to Malfoy's chair, leaned down and kissed Malfoy straight on the mouth in front of everyone. Malfoy didn't seem upset, since he gently brought a hand to Harry's jaw. It was only a few moments before Harry pulled away and walked towards his bedroom.
“I have no idea what you are talking about.”
“But... you've been watching me all year. Staring at me. Following me.” Harry bit the side of his cheek. He was Harry
Was he assuming – no doubt correctly – that Hermione would one day be someone extremely important in the Wizarding World? Maybe, but then why spend so much time winning over Ron, too? Just because they were dating? And what about Ginny?
“Actually, I've been thinking.” Draco groaned. He hated when George had been thinking. George just grinned. “I've been thinking we should have a section of the store – just a small part of it – dedicated to the adult market.” Draco made a face.
Ron nodded, too confused to think of a response. He met Hermione's eye, and she looked just as lost.
to,” Malfoy interrupted gently. Their interaction made it clear this was a discussion they'd had before. “You shouldn't have to worry about that. Let me handle them.” When Harry leaned in and kissed Malfoy, Ron immediately turned away. He stood with his back against the wall, his mind racing. It had only been an instant, but he couldn't get the image out of his mind. Harry had kissed Malfoy like he'd done it a hundred times before, like there was nothing more he wanted to do in the world.
for Harry.
There was some movement, but no response for a while.
"I didn't say anything! I’ve
“Listen,” He said, not particularly kindly. “I've given you guys plenty of articles. There's nothing else for me to say. You know my favorite color, what food I like, how many Quidditch games I've won. What else can you possibly write?” The man wasn't fazed by Harry's obvious annoyance. He sat his hat down beside him and pulled his quill to the parchment.
“Really just need to worry about Ron, now. Ginny was sold from the broom, probably even just you telling her she's the best player at Hogwarts. Hermione's no issue now that you got her that book. Was it really in the Manor?”
"The bathroom door, too?" Malfoy asked with a raised brow. Harry started to argue, but realized that he had no idea if someone was in the bathroom. He hadn't even considered that someone could have come through the bathrooms from the other dorm entrance. "And the silencing charm?"
His mother nodded and looked over to the wall of potted plants behind them. Now that they only had two house elves, who mostly spent their time cleaning the expansive Manor, they had hired a squib to handle all of the plants and landscaping. Although the manor was still dark and foreboding to a degree, all of the plants and redecorating had improved it a lot.
“I, well... that she fancied me, I suppose. But what does that have to do....” he trailed off watching Harry, who was meeting his eye with one brow raised. Draco shook his head slightly and his face grew red. “Don't. Don't mess with me.” Harry turned to the wall.
“Malfoy, I-” But Malfoy was already standing up. He rooted in Harry's chest until he found the cloak, throwing it on before Harry had even figured out what to say.
The apology was long and seemed downright genuine. Malfoy didn't make excuses for himself, or hint that Ron had done anything wrong to him, and took the time to apologize for everything he'd done the past seven years. Ron still didn't like the git at all and he knew they'd never be friends, but they came to an agreement that Ron would be civil to him. There was a similar conversation with Hermione that Ron wasn't there for. But she also agreed to be civil and polite and somewhat forgave Malfoy.
The rest of the pile came from an assortment of people responding to the letters he'd sent them – Andromeda about Teddy, Mrs. Weasley about nothing in particular, Mr. Weasley about Muggle TVs, Kingsley about working as an Auror, and some others he didn't even remember sending.
“Merlin!” Draco felt like he was just about on fire. “Do you have to be so vulgar? Why are you always here? This isn't even your common room.”
“Good book?” Draco finally looked back up and nodded.
Ten minutes ago, Harry had seen Weasley enter the common room. The two made fierce eye contact before Weasley stormed off into the dorms with Thomas and Longbottom, who awkwardly nodded at Harry before continuing with Weasley.
“That is true. I only thought... I remember that you and Hermione had quite a row at the Yule Ball. If I remember correctly, she yelled something about you ruining what was supposed to be a great night.”
idea, know-it-all.” Malfoy smirked and began running his hand across Harry's shoulder.
"Where are you off to in such a hurry?"
“Why in the hell would you give me a broomstick?” She didn't even bother mentioning it was the fastest, most expensive broom yet, one that had just been released. Malfoy shrugged. Like it was no big deal.
Draco cast a tempus as he stepped out into the street, narrowly dodging two young boys running through the door behind him. He’d expected to be at work past seven, and so had to turn down his Aunt when she had asked him to babysit. But it was just before five, which was just enough to time to get there if she hadn't found anyone else.
“Actually, I don't want to ask about you.” Harry sat up straighter, somewhat intrigued. He took a bite of apple and chewed it slowly before responding.
“We'll talk later. Best get out of here before someone else walks in.”
“Okay.” He said it like he didn't know what her point was. He slowly put the bookmark in his book and shut it. It was clear he wasn't going to get any more reading done.
"What are you doing?" The brunette snapped the map out of Ron's sight as if he hadn’t already seen it. Ron gave him a disappointed look. Harry shrugged.
And so it went on. Malfoy and Ron held weekly chess matches, Malfoy complimentary when Ron won and polite when Ron lost. He studied with Hermione once or twice a week, and listened to the rants Ron and Harry quickly grew bored of. Even Ginny joined Malfoy for Quidditch practice every so often.
There was a flood of noise circling Harry – owls, laughter, clinks of silverware against plates, happy conversations. But he had tuned it all out to watch the blond at the Slytherin table.
“None of them were Harry Potter,” Malfoy said quietly. Harry gulped. He didn't want Malfoy thinking he was indebted to him. He
“Will you stop staring at me constantly now?” Draco whispered. Harry grinned.
