“I think I’ve got an extra pair of mittens,” Potter said, slinging on his winter cloak and digging around in the pockets. He pulled out one pair of garish red and gold mittens with his initials on them, and another pair in an intricate multi-coloured pattern, which he handed to Draco.  “Those are new, never been worn, should be all right for you.”
Draco tried again.  “I’m sorry, Harry.  Staying here – I don’t have work, and it’s hard to keep hiding – not just being a wizard, but being with you.  They think it’s a sin here for men to be lovers, you know that.  All these kind people, but they’d think we were damned twice over if they really knew us. I couldn’t spend three months pretending, and I did want to see Madagascar.  But I thought about you everywhere I went.”  His voice cracked a little.  “I didn’t know it would be so hard.”
“They’re a kind of cattle, with humps and these gorgeous long curving horns,” Draco elaborated.  “People practically worship them.”
After he left the match Harry flew back to find that river and its bridge. It looked so much more cheerful now, sparkling in warm sunlight, than it had that night five years ago…
There was no sign of recognition on Lucius Malfoy’s face as he looked at Harry. “Good afternoon.  Do I know you?”
Potter came through the Floo.  He was dressed more nicely than usual.  For his date, Draco supposed.  He wouldn’t be staying long, then.
“But he made the world safe for us.  So teacher says we should join the ‘Send Harry Some Love’ campaign.  Do you like my poem?”
Harry bent over the headmaster, who was telling him in a faint voice to go find Snape and bring him there.  Harry ran down the stairs and disappeared.
Malfoy shook his head.  “She was half-grown.  We met at a garden party.  She had been left behind when a neighboring family moved.”
The Mooncalf was healed. Harry and Draco took it back to the field where Harry had first found it, just in time for the full moon. They stood in the shadows, removed the Sleeping Charm they’d used to relax it for the journey, and waited.
Rosemonde had been rescued from an abusive wizard.  She had probably been small to begin with, and also had been underfed, so although she was larger than an ordinary horse, she was not nearly as large as the other Abraxans, and not well matched to pull in a team.  She was also somewhat skittish.
But the voice that crooned from the bathroom cubicle was sympathetic: “Don’t… Tell me what’s wrong… I can help you.”  And since there wasn’t a living soul he could talk to about this, Draco told the maudlin girl ghost of a Mudblood.
“Nah, not me. Nary a Nargle in sight.” Harry grinned. He wrapped an arm around Draco and rested his head on his shoulder. “Nobody here but us Billywigs.”
A business card had indeed fluttered to the floor – and landed near another, smaller version of itself that Harry noticed for the first time. It must have fallen when he opened Malfoy's first note. In peacock blue ink, with a silver border, the card read:
He felt, suddenly, that he’d been freezing, and could only be warmed by Malfoy’s body heat.  He wanted to draw Malfoy’s hands across his body, let them thaw his skin.   Guide those clever hands down from his shoulder and across his chest, down from his waist to…  Just the thought was making him hot.
Startled, Harry turned, but he was, as so often these days, alone. Too often, Hermione said. Maybe she was right, if he was hearing voices in his head.
They walked to Baker Beach, and past that scrambled down to the smaller, more secluded Marshall Beach that someone had recommended.  It was a place of beauty, and a nude beach, and a gay beach, and Draco would have been shocked, but he had been on a tour of wonders.
“That’s right.  Thank you.”  She was polite but cool.  Draco was curious, though, and Ravenclaws could usually be tempted into conversation about whatever they were reading.
“These all have male riders,” Draco said, pointing to the illustrations from old Greek vases.  “I believe my hippalectryon will accept only you.”
“Cho’s waiting for me.” She turned to Ron again. “And if you feel the need to protect your virtue, you can always bring a chaperone.”
She was holding out a golden brush to Harry.  It looked too uncomfortable for a hair-brush.  “It’s a carding comb,” she said.
The infusion was ready. He took a sip and spat it out. It was shockingly bitter. He found himself thinking of Professor Snape.
“Yeah yeah, very pretty, but….” Harry tried the tap on the sink.  Water came out.  “Well, that’s a relief.  At least some of the taps work.  I‘m going to check the rest of them before I talk to this fellow.”
“’Nuff talking,” said Harry.  “I can see that if I want any seducing done here I’ll have to do it myself.  I want to see
Somehow, between the kissing, they made it to Harry’s house, and his bed, and shed their trousers and everything else, and then there was just joyful sexy desperate sweet wantonness until they fell asleep in each other’s arms.
The water was cold, and strong currents pulled the sand out between his toes.  The Golden Gate Bridge soared across the water.  Sea birds cried.
Draco made his way slowly through the skeletal beasts, who stared at him with unnervingly blank eyes.  Luna unwrapped a packet of bloody chopped beef.  He took some and held it on a flat outstretched palm.  The elderly horse accepted it delicately, and then her warm tongue gently licked the blood from his hand.  It was unexpectedly comforting.
“All right.”  Unexpectedly, Malfoy was sitting next to him on the couch, and reaching out to remove the replacement glasses Harry wore.  Harry was startled into stillness at the feel of fingers grazing the sides of his face.
The chief wizard, a small austere man resplendent in brocaded silk, agreed to help Rutherford after the tournament.  He pointed out an inconspicuous spot high in a corner of the sumo hall where she could perch. Rutherford settled in to watch the ring-entering ceremony.
“Actually, it will take him a while to fly back, and I’d hoped to use him before then.  Maybe I’d better come pick him up.”  Harry turned to Hermione.  “Do you mind if I step out for a few minutes, Hermione?  I’ll be back soon.”
Deciding to take the Minotaur by the horns, Draco lifted his chin, walked to Murgatroyd’s office, prepared himself with a quick charm, and knocked.
Now exhaustion won out.  “Do you think the Room of Parole is still there?” Draco asked Harry, who had been reuniting with friends and trying to comfort the wounded, but looked ready to topple over himself.
Draco was looking bleakly out over the water.  Harry was at a loss.  “I’m sorry about your mother,” he said finally, deciding to avoid the topic of Lucius Malfoy entirely.
“It will be a dance-as-you-are fun-raiser,” Merfley said. “However you dance is fine. We will be happy that you have fun. And you can see other dancing. That will be fun too.”
Arthur began walking towards it with Harry. “It’s his,” Arthur said, waving toward the shed. “We were just looking at the carbelator.”
The school year was almost over, and soon Harry’s term as a volunteer would be completed.  And after that?  He wished he knew.
Harry pulled Draco into his arms.  “God, you’re gorgeous when you do that,” Harry said.  “You’re making me hard all over again.”
“I BLEW AN ASPEN LEAF THERE ONCE, AND IT TIRED ME OUT FOR DAYS.  BUT I’LL TAKE YOU, IF YOU’RE NOT AFRAID.”
Sipping his butterbeer, Draco watched the match with pleasure, but a slight sense of something missing.
“I don’t know.  I didn’t know how.  I could’ve tried to say it wasn’t her, but they already knew it was, and then I was afraid they wouldn’t believe me about not recognizing you….”  Draco had gotten hold of some leaves and was ripping them to shreds.
Potter narrowed his eyes and Draco realized that he’d just made himself look suspicious.  Potter had a junior Auror expression on his face, like he was about to accuse Draco of destroying evidence.
Draco rewarded him with a small but grateful smile and a quick kiss, pulling him in close and Apparating them both to the front door of Malfoy Manor.  The door Harry had been kicked through as a prisoner of Fenrir Greyback.
“Turns your head into a vegetable.  Of the cabbage family, usually.  In your case, perhaps a Brussels sprout.”
“No,” Draco said, “I don’t want it back.  It’s all too confused – would you still be the master of it, unless I won it back from you?  If I won it, would I then be master of your wand too?  I’d be a target for every would-be Dark Lord who wanted mastery of the Elder Wand, wherever it is.  Let sleeping wands lie.  I’m not the same wizard I was.”
Malfoy sighed.  He ate a piece of mango and a biscuit somewhat grimly, then sat back and regarded Harry.
Potter looked in and, unfortunately, laughed. Herman flushed angrily and squirted a jet of water into his eye.
“It’s fine - thanks,” said Harry, surprised to be served anything by Malfoy, who just nodded.   Harry started to reach for some mango, then hesitated.  Maybe he was being naïvely trusting.  “I’m, uh, not hungry, though.”
Those gleaming eyes again, and laughter like the sun breaking through clouds, and Harry ran out of words.  All his brain could supply was
“I do know a few other spells.” Harry grinned a little. “And then, you know, I might not want you dead either.”
Harry felt bad.  He came over to rub the bear’s head.  “I’ll come back, Draco.  I just need a little break.”
Potter enlarged the mirror so that Draco could see if they touched his arse or legs.  Higher up he’d be able to feel it himself.
Outside the rain slackened for a few moments and Draco’s moan came out startlingly loud.  It was a sound of sexual gratification, not pain, and Harry, used to don’t-wake-the-neighbors lovemaking, found it unutterably hot.  He grinned at Draco’s flushed face.  Just then the rain returned with redoubled force, crashing against the metal roof, and they both laughed, eyes locked on each other. Harry spit into his hand – he couldn’t reach the oil – and stroked Draco’s cock until Draco arched his back, tossing his head with high-pitched cries of approaching orgasm.  He spurted hot and wet over Harry’s hand and clenched around Harry’s cock, and Harry hauled him up into a kiss.  He kept thrusting, face buried in Draco’s neck, Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist, until he came with his own shout of release.
“Not just his clothes and armour, Potter.  His horse is green.  His hair is green.  His SKIN is green.  Overall enker green.”
Draco nodded.  “I will speak to the Ministry at once.  I don’t have a great deal of influence myself, but there are others who may join on your behalf.  I appreciate your help in translating,” he added to the chestnut-colored centaur.  “Is there anything I could do for you?”
He could tell that Harry was restless.  They would probably be gone soon. Granger was continually poring over books in the library; she declined his help with research, but she was polite about it.  He tried to distract his great-aunt from shrieking at her in the hallway.
make it?”  Like a logjam breaking, he thought, watching the light pour again out of his lover’s eyes, dazzling and warm.
Harry couldn’t sleep, though.  He kept remembering what his aunt had said.  He knew Draco wasn’t a monster, but he was curious.  He knew the touch of Draco in his bed, and the sound of him, and the taste and the smell of him, and now Harry felt he couldn’t stand it, not to have the sight of Draco too.
“No, she couldn’t have ever met any actual goblins; that poem is very sensual. The goblins go about tempting people to suck on luscious juicy fruits.”
, which we were endeavoring to do something about. I will handle it. Draco, retrieve your wand and find out what this person wants. We have animals to attend to.”
“Another friend told me of the goddess who rides the white horse.  I think… I am beginning to understand the respect which has been lacking in our dealings with other creatures.”
“Are sexy as hell,” Harry said.  “But you do smell delicious.  Like treacle tart.  Mmmm.” He nuzzled Draco’s neck.
“We will send someone to help you with exercises to improve your upper body strength and training for independent living now that you are chair-bound.”
Artemis, his eagle owl, looked up as he came in.  He just had to tie the letter to her leg and… Draco had an image of the owl returning at breakfast to deliver a Howler.  That wasn’t really Father’s style – he tended more to the cold and cutting – but still.
Draco was feeling more optimistic when he re-entered the forest that afternoon.  And there in a glade he came across a hippogriff, a sleek steely-blue colored female.
Malfoy had reached what looked like an overgrown, muddy ditch.  “Wuffley?” he called.  Slowly a long, narrow boat of bright green appeared and water shimmered around it.
“If you get too pure you’ll end up like those Jains who won’t even pull up a potato because it kills the plant,” Parvati said, passing by. “No onions or garlic, either. For that matter, no taro. And you’d all have to go home without today’s other pudding too.” She was carrying bowls of something fragrant and creamy.
Potter, squaring his shoulders and tossing his head back, hissed at the dragon in Parseltongue. Draco barely had time to cast a protective shield before the dragon spat flame at them and hissed back. Somehow Draco understood the conversation.
The matches began.  After a parade of sponsors’ banners, a pair of wrestlers would enter dressed only in tightly wrapped silk loincloths.  They tossed in handfuls of salt to purify the ring, kicked their legs up sideways and stamped, slapped their bellies, adjusted the fringe on their loincloths and squatted, rose and squatted again and finally faced off. As soon as both signaled readiness they exploded into action.
Caught by memory, Harry shut his eyes. True, nothing about Draco that night had seemed reluctant. Hesitant only at first, then passionate. Someone like that had probably had many lovers since then. Probably still did. He sighed and opened his eyes.
Harry wasn’t as close to Ron and Hermione as he’d once been – they’d become absorbed in their own lives, he supposed, and then Ginny and Ron had squabbled a lot.  After Ginny left, Harry hadn’t much felt like seeing anyone. But Ron and Hermione were his oldest friends, and he didn’t want the distance to grow.
“No, wait, Fern. That isn’t an elliptical galaxy, it’s a spiral.” Draco scooped the cat up so he could correct what she’d entered. “And the arms are going anti-clockwise…”
When he finished, Teddy’s eyes were shut and he was breathing in the gentle rhythms of sleep.  Draco looked up to find Harry’s gaze upon him.  It was a moment before Draco could look away.  He got up quietly from Teddy’s bed and went into the living room.  Harry followed and sat next to him on the sofa.
“He doesn’t see or hear very well,” Draco explained. He was having trouble climbing up on the bed lately too, but Draco didn’t want to think about that.
It was an average cock, maybe, not particularly huge or heroic.  But it was Harry Potter’s cock, and it was getting hard, and it was getting hard for him.
Potter woke with a start, his chest heaving.  He stared at Draco for a moment, then said, “He kills people’s parents.  How can you believe in him, Malfoy?  Voldemort
you want, I’m sure my bride will be willing to show me her domestic skills.  I need my night-shirt cleaned before the wedding.”
“Everyone is related if you’re willing to acknowledge it.  There’s a Potter on my mother’s family tree somewhere, I’m sure of it.  There’s even a Weasley, for that matter.”
Harry’s arousal surged under the sweet heat of his lover’s hand and the naked lust in his eyes.  Draco sucked hard on one of Harry’s nipples and started tonguing his way downward.  “I ... wait ... ” Harry began, but then warm lips closed around his cock and within seconds he was gone, coming hard.
“Dudley?” Harry shook his head. “I don’t expect any happy reconciliations there and I sure haven’t missed him. I mean, I suppose if Draco Malfoy can turn over a new leaf then anything is possible, but I think the Dursleys are all just glad to have the magical freak out of their lives.”
After breakfast Harry could not resist trying to throw peanuts to some extraordinarily cute baby monkeys in the trees just a few yards away, but each time a larger monkey would appear and snatch the food away.
“I have, actually.  The centaurs of India are the Ashwini Kumaras.  I took an interest because they’re divine twins!”  She laughed.
“She was a Muggle.” Æthelflæd fixed Draco with a look. “In one battle her people poured hot beer down upon their attackers and dropped beehives on them.”
They carefully brought the Bowtruckles to a stand of trees to let them choose new homes, but it turned out that most of the trees already had Bowtruckles of their own. Draco ended up sending Merfley to the Root and Branch Magical Tree Nursery for saplings and planting several new ones, hawthorn, hazel, ash and apple.
Harry shook his head, but Ron had already turned back to Draco, whose mouth was twitching at the last comment.  “I bet you can’t find a rhyme for Hermione, anyway.”
After they circled the ring, clapped and filed off, the highest ranked wrestler entered the ring with two attendants.  He lifted both arms above his head like an owl getting a good wing-stretch, brought them forward and clapped.  Then he leaned sideways for a one-sided wing and leg stretch.  (Of course being wingless he was handicapped, but he tried to compensate, lifting the leg very high and stamping with energy.)  Next he squatted low and slid forward on his feet.  The crowd shouted approval.
“Revenge of the Mudgleborns, Malfoy?  It would serve you right if it were,” she said.  “This castle needs lifts, like the Ministry has.”  But the castle had a hundred and forty-two staircases.
chimed in with “Boy Who Lived Breaks Up with Girlfriend: Who’ll Be the Next Lucky Lady?” and “Our Savior’s Single Again – Is He Seeking a Sweetheart?”
Over lunch Harry explained that it would be the full moon again soon, and he’d been wondering if the Mooncalf was ready to return to its herd for their dance. However, Æthelflæd didn’t feel the leg had healed enough yet.
Over dinner, Harry and Ron talked about Quidditch, Auror cases and George's joke shop, while Draco and Hermione began a cautious discussion about politics and the most effective ways of approaching conservative purebloods.
A haunting melody drifted past. It spoke to something in Harry, bittersweet and yearning. The musician appeared, coming towards them, playing a long vertical bamboo flute.  He was a vendor, carrying others for sale, and Harry bought one.
Like Snape had once been.  Harry remembered what he’d seen in the Pensieve, just before he gave himself up to Voldemort.  Snape, who Harry had been sure was his enemy, confronting Dumbledore - appalled that Dumbledore’s plan would mean Harry’s death.
“Harry, what have you been doing?  Are you all right?  You look…”  Draco had no words for how Harry looked, some mixture of exhilarated and agonized and exhausted.
He shut his eyes because they were suddenly stinging. Then Draco felt a warm arm around him and an open kiss pressed to his neck. He opened his eyes to see Harry – Potter – Harry smiling at him, as he scrambled off the bed, still blushing, and scooped up his clothes.  So, he was going to bolt for his room.  But first he turned back and gave Draco’s hand a squeeze.  It was the wet sticky hand, and Harry looked startled at his own come now on his hand, then laughed a bit incredulously and wiped it on his thigh.
“As cool as Bill Weasley?”  Draco looked puzzled for a moment, then shook his head with a slight laugh.  “Only you could be insecure about being Harry Potter,” he said in an undertone.
After he had recovered, Harry turned, loose and happy in his body, to smile at Draco.  He stroked Draco’s thigh, reached tentatively toward Draco’s erect cock.  “What do you want?”
In a flash of silver, a stag Patronus leapt through the trees, startling him and the dog both.  Draco heard Potter’s voice emerge just before the apparition vanished. “Sing, Malfoy!”
Being stuck in a lift was not, itself, dangerous.  But alone with Harry Potter?  Hostility ended long years ago, but other feelings Draco preferred to hide.
“What if you went and watched the Mooncalves dance, Merfley, and then you could come back and demonstrate?” Draco asked.
It was part of the agreement that kept him out of Azkaban: work for two years (at minimal wages) “to serve the Wizarding community.”  But that community was very reluctant to give him a job.  It was only thanks to Granger’s strange sense of fairness that he had been hired at all - she was working for the Department on something to do with House-Elves.  He’d once made an effort, stiffly, to thank her, but she’d just said, “Do something useful for once in your life, Malfoy,” before turning away.
“So when I went to France to see Pansy, and to Italy to see Blaise, and they seemed to be just trying to transfer the same pure-blood social world there – I didn’t really want to be part of it.  I didn’t know what I did want to do – I didn’t have a career prepared.  My parents had some money in European banks, so I could get by if I was careful.  One day in Italy I thought, I’d like to see the Sphinx.  And then I thought, why not?  So I went to Egypt.  And from there, I thought I’d like to see dragons in China – they’re creatures of water there, not fire, you know.  So I went to China.  And it turns out that I’m actually a pretty good traveler – I like languages, so that helps.  And each place I went, I’d hear about something else, somewhere else that I was curious to see.  It kept me going.”
Draco’s body was thrown by the force of the spell and he screamed.  He was shaking.  It happened again.  Again.
“I was trying to stay alive.  If I’d really been working for him, I would have told them they had you at the Manor, wouldn’t I?”
Outside crickets were calling and the first faint stars were pricking the sky.  Fern prowled through the grass.  A movement caught Draco’s eye, as an owl swept low and silent over the ground.  Fern saw too, and ran after it.
“Well,” Myra said, “the wizarding world is a small one.  We’re likely to play more than one role in each other’s lives at some point.”
“Quite well, I think,” Draco answered.  “Not many people came, but sometimes people are more willing to open up in a smaller group.  There were some good questions.” Draco had begun offering workshops on coping with disability for other survivors of curses.
"Oh, Matty, what I wouldn't give for ten minutes with my mum to find out how to be better at this," Harry murmurs to the little one in his arms.
Potter looked at him, amused. “Don’t be a Fluffengrumple, Malfoy.” His eyes were warm and his smile was relaxed and it was altogether a charming expression such as had not been directed Draco’s way before.
The red-haired laddie gave Harry an apple made of gold.  Harry would have liked a real apple better, since he hadn’t eaten breakfast, but he didn’t want to be rude so he put the golden one in his pocket.  Then the laddie took one of the knights from his chess set, waved a wand over it, and there was a horse for Harry to ride.  He thanked the red-haired laddie and off he went.
Troubled, Harry went outside, where he found Luna and Merfley admiring the squidlets. “They can flash all kinds of colors now,” Luna said. “So lovely.”
“Huh – huh –” Draco panted.   The monster growled, too like a werewolf, and Draco shuddered.  Then he had an image of his mother, steely and self-contained.  He pulled himself together and sang the first thing that came into his head.
“They would if you asked, but they don’t lay in supplies to feed people during the summer.  And you really don’t want to eat what House-Elves fix for themselves – they have very odd tastes.   I’m heading in to Hogsmeade myself to pick up some bread and things.”
Slightly unnerved, Harry opened his eyes and pushed his glasses back up his nose until they felt normal.
It flipped a dismissive paw in the direction of Harry’s cousin Dudley, who was trying unsuccessfully to hide behind Aunt Petunia.
Just then the shopkeeper reappeared with the merchandise. As the other wizard was paying for his purchases, a familiar voice behind Draco called out, “Hello Charlie!  Ready to go and get some lunch?”
Harry didn’t have the patience for climbing stairs at this point.  He Apparated them into his bedroom.  They fell on the bed and finished getting rid of clothes.  Then he felt Draco’s palms cup his cheeks, fingertips lifting the earpieces of his glasses.
Teddy’s hair was shifting through a succession of colours. It settled on a vibrant pink that reminded Harry of Tonks at her most cheerful. He grinned at Teddy and Teddy grinned back.
“O Keeper of My Wand,” Draco said.  “Speaking of which, must I take things into my own hands before I die of sexual frustration here?”
“She’s the one trying to catch him,” Harry said.  “If she’s hunting him I’d say she’s a bit out of her league.  She’s quite an acrobat, though.”
“You are a trouserful of wantonness,” Harry repeated triumphantly.  But this time Malfoy held Harry’s eye with a slow smile.  Then he tipped his chair back and regarded his own groin.  Harry shifted awkwardly.  Malfoy stood, turned, and craned his neck over his shoulder to look at his own arse.
“He did most of his heroic deeds before you were born.”  Which was lucky, because it meant most of Draco’s shameful deeds had happened before she was born, too.
“Rutherford!  Come and take Potter his verse, it’s on the table.  I’m just going for a quick broom ride.”
“Let’s go and see Wilton House!” Padma said. “It’s probably possible to tour it. Harry, you invite Draco. You can all look for wyverns and I’ll wander the halls of a literary foremother.”
“Did you hear yourself arrive?  That was the last battle,” Harry said.  “That was you swooping in to save the day.”
That was plausible, actually.  Not that there were really Glum Mumsmiggles or whatever in there, but that Luna would think there were.
Draco’s spell had no effect except to make the monster bark with all three heads, a deafening sound.  Its six eyes rolled madly.  He tried again with a binding spell, which was equally useless.  None of the spells he cast worked against it, so in desperation he cast a protective shield around himself.  The giant dog lunged just outside, still barking its fool heads off.
Harry stiffened and then took a deep breath.  “Thank you for saving Draco from Bellatrix Lestrange, Mr Malfoy.”
Just then they heard the Floo come to life in the other room.  “Hello?”  It sounded like Potter’s voice.
“Kreacher heard Master Harry talking to himself about Master Draco’s wand, and Master Draco’s broomstick.  Kreacher is knowing what it means when wizards talk about other wizards’ wands and broomsticks.”
“He’s a bit rough around the edges, but his heart is as big as the rest of him,” the West Wind added reassuringly.
Draco gazed at him, laughed softly, took Harry’s hand and squeezed. “I’d say Mrs Weasley knew what she was doing.”
Harry loosed his hand and Disapparated.  Draco smiled after him.  From the corner of his eye he saw a gleam of yellow-green light blink on and off in the garden.  He laughed again in quiet wonder.  “Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee, Harry Potter.”  And Draco went home.
Some time later, Draco ran into Potter on Diagon Alley. Potter, un-Glamoured this time, actually nodded and said hello, so Draco did the same.  “Good afternoon, Potter.  Haven’t seen you around for a while.”
“Into a Muggle university, so clearly you’re not a Muggle-hater any more.”  Harry’s voice softened.  “That must have been such a difficult transition for you to make, Draco.”
“Well, and then there were all kinds of crazy things second year, when Dobby was trying to protect me by keeping me away from Hogwarts.  He managed to seal Platform 9 ¾ against me, can you believe it?  There’s really no telling what house-elves can do….”  Harry frowned.  “Kreacher!”
They landed on a mountainside, somewhere snowy and moonlit and quiet. The air smelled like cedar. Stars twinkled in the frosty air.
“Oh no! It seemed quite shy and I didn’t want to scare it. They’re said to be quite solitary when they aren’t raising a family.” Luna frowned. “I’m not sure how it would find a mate—their habitat is shrinking, and another Humdinger might be far away and difficult to locate.”
Except, he discovered the next day, she hadn’t been joking. Draco was with him when the owl arrived with a package and note.
Padma snorted.  “His loss.  I’m all for reading originals, but with all the languages there are in the world….  What kind of topic are you looking for, Harry?”
But nothing woke Draco up.  Finally poor Harry climbed into the bed, and if he cried a bit before he fell asleep, no one could blame him.
“Remarkable,” said Blaise.  “Next you’ll be telling me that Potter also has black hair.  But no, that would be too extraordinary a coincidence.”
He heard the leaves rustle, and saw an ivory horn.  A unicorn?  He held his breath.  And then, pure white and gleaming like moonlight, stepped out…  a centauress-unicorn?  She had a young woman’s upper body with a lovely face and pale flowing hair, a horse’s lower body and legs with golden hooves, and a horn spiraling up from the center of her forehead.  She was at once so strange and so beautiful that Draco was speechless.
“And have you bang me into the wall every few steps and drop me on the stairs?  I think not.  The house elves will bring something.”
There was a little line between Draco’s brows, and his mouth was tight.  It wasn’t anger, though – when he was angry his chin came up and his eyes flashed and he became rather scarily articulate.
The garter snake became quite animated when Harry spoke to it and there was a lot of hissing back and forth.  It looked more eager than angry.
Malfoy followed his eyes. “The Kraken!” he shouted in alarm, reaching for his wand. Just as he raised it, a whip-like tentacle broke the water’s surface and plucked the wand away.
“Yeah, he took a chunk out of Snape’s leg.  Come to think of it, that year was also my first time in the Forest, and the first time I met a centaur.  Again because of you and your snitching, Malfoy.  Considering how you behaved on that occasion, I’m surprised you ever wanted to return.”
She nudged her babies aside and got up. From the mouth of the cave she could see sunlit mountains. She stepped outside and looked around carefully until she saw the mountainside she had come from, in the distance. She recognised other landmarks.
“Ursa means she-bear and I am not a female, Potter.  As I said, you really don’t know anything about me.”
So that is what Harry had been doing – camping in the woods, on the run, hungry – the year the Dark Lord had taken over Malfoy Manor.  That year of fear and
“With black hair - silky, glossy, midnight black, and so soft.” Draco smiled, remembering the feel of it under his fingers.  “We look very well together.”
“Ignatius brought them.  I don’t know how he came by them, but of course I recognised they were yours.  And in need of repair.”
Draco thought dubiously of various Hogwarts classmates born the same year – Vince, or the once silly, pretty Lavender Brown.  He had no wish to speak ill of the dead – whom he had so recently tried to join – or of the scarred and determined survivors, but.…  “If we're all so clever, how our professors must have rejoiced, when a whole troop of us entered school at once.”
“Let me put the tea on and fix you something to eat, Arthur’s out by the shed, go see him, won’t he be surprised!”
Draco could be diplomatic when necessary.  “Well, the message is clear.  And it rhymes, though it doesn’t quite scan.”
At Hogwarts, students and staff were told that Draco had died suddenly of complications from his injury, and that his mother had insisted on a private funeral at the Manor.  It was strange to think that his friends in Slytherin would believe him dead, but he couldn’t afford to let it be known he was alive, if he wanted to stay that way.
“I certainly did.  But on my first trip I almost didn’t make it onto the train!  I didn’t know the secret to get to the platform.  Then on the train I made friends with Ron, and ate pumpkin pasties and chocolate frogs, and started learning about Quidditch, and…  well, I hadn’t even known about the wizarding world until a few weeks before, so it was all very new and exciting.”
“I got tired of having targets on my back and cameras in my face,” Harry said.  He’d wanted a refuge, he remembered, somewhere warm and friendly and good-smelling where he didn’t have to be alone.  Once he’d assumed that meant a home with Ginny.  When that dream faded, Harry had opened the coffee shop.  Now, with Draco – perhaps the shop wasn’t so important any more.
An opal necklace glowed nearby.  “Cursed… claimed lives of nineteen Muggles” said the label.  It, too, called to him.
Merfley and Herman seemed to understand each other fairly well, and Draco gathered that the final battle at Hogwarts had left a lot of curse residue in the lake there. As a result, the squidlets’ growth was delayed and they had lost some of their ability to change color, crucial for camouflage. They needed a safer place to recover.
He didn’t expect an answer to questions he didn’t even know how to ask aloud.  But later, when they went for a walk at dusk, Draco spoke about his changes since the war.
Ron looked to be torn between indignation and amusement. “Would you stop flirting with my girlfriend, you wanker.”
pressuring Potter, was probably a better question. “Don’t read the newspaper, you’ll feel better,” Draco advised.
Her discretion and matter-of-fact manner helped somewhat to ease his humiliation. Somewhat.  She left.
Artemis was finally given a letter from Draco to deliver to his father. She flew to the Manor with it. Since Narcissa always wanted to send her son a package of chocolates by return post, Artemis waited. Thus she was present when Lucius read the letter.
“Hello Draco!  Didn’t know you were home!  Mind your head!” Draco’s reply was drowned out by another shower of falling slates. Mercifully, Greg had sent them well off to the side, but the rosebush would probably never be the same.
Harry tried to catch Ron’s eye, remembering all the dreadful prophecies from Divination class. But Ron was getting a second slice of cake, and Lavender captured Harry’s teacup. Fortunately she did not see any portents of death. “It looks like there is romance in your future!” she said, eyes twinkling.
The success of the party continued the next day. Kingsley Shacklebolt contacted Draco to ask if there was anything the animal haven needed, and was surprised to find they lacked funds. He said money had been allocated but the funds were apparently held up for some reason; by the end of the day they were released.
And it was.  The Snidgets whirred, golden blurs, dipping and soaring over meadows and between trees, as Draco and Potter stood gazing upward with gaping grins, like children trying to catch snowflakes in their mouths.
“It is, actually.  McGonagall said I was to check in with the groundskeeper before I entered the forest.  Well, that’s done, so I’ll leave you in peace.  Ta-ta, Potter.”
Draco paused, as if he were looking for the right words.  “It’s not – lack of attraction.  But I don’t want to be your experiment.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said briefly, no longer smiling. “What do you want, Potter? Here as a junior Auror, are you? Where’s the uniform?”
Who was pressuring Potter, then? Draco studied his profile, recalling various headlines he’d seen in passing.
and it became eerily quiet. Harry appeared – he looked exhausted and smoke-streaked but determined.  He and Voldemort squared off, and everyone else stopped to watch.  Voldemort couldn’t stop himself from boasting and jeering: he would defeat Harry now because he held the Wand of Destiny, the Death Stick, he had gained power over it when he had taken it from Snape by murder.
“There might be one or more hibernating. Dragon-kind are more sensitive than you might think. They can go into a lethargy when the magical energy-field is depressed. They’re tough to kill off altogether, though. And the eggs won’t hatch until conditions are right – it’s called environmentally cued hatching. So they might make a comeback under the right circumstances.”
And then Draco was laughing, and Harry was laughing, and a jolt passed through him, warm as Draco’s eyes.
Draco had to laugh too.  “Thank you, Kreacher.  It was a fine adventure.  And it worked out very well.”
That girl Potter had saved from drowning in the Tri-Wizarding Tournament, many long years ago.  Potter had saved so many different people’s lives.  It probably wasn’t as memorable for him as for the one he’d – for example – plucked from a Fiendfyre.
“Because it’s urgent, and their international allies have asked for support…”   Draco trailed off as he recognized the look on Murgatroyd’s face.  “You don’t believe me.”
“Just as well, I’d already used one of the best rhymes.”  Draco’s voice trailed off as he thought.  “Granger, danger.  Stranger, changer….arranger!”
“You fill your trousers quite nicely yourself,” Malfoy said, gazing at Harry’s arse.  “And I do believe they’re getting fuller all the time,” he added, staring at Harry’s crotch.
Harry let out a long breath. “It’ll be a relief in some ways, not having to hide. Let’s show them we don’t care, then.”
It was late afternoon when they got off the bus and began to walk the last mile to Harry’s house, going steadily uphill.  There were few people on this particular road, but as they got closer they ran into a couple of students from Harry’s school, Madalitso and Lonjezo, who insisted on carrying some packages for them, balancing them on their heads as they walked.
He wondered who might have rumpled Malfoy up that way.  He wondered how it would feel to rumple Malfoy up.  Just gently.  Smooth that frown out.   Bring some color to his cheeks.  His lips.  Make his eyes flutter shut and his mouth fall slack and his breath come panting, gasping
Now years later, alone in his room at the inn Harry dropped the book of poems, doused the light, and cast a
Draco pressed his eyes shut.  He took a deep breath before he opened them again. “I ruined a lot of things, I’m aware. Apologies aren’t adequate. But since I have a life to go on living, I’m trying to work out how not to ruin the rest of it, and for that…” He looked at Potter.  “I’d like some privacy.”
“Some do. Ah, that’s Hessie.  She loves gingernuts, don’t you girl?” Malfoy said as he re-entered the room holding a book.  He gave the owl a delicate scratch and untied the scroll.  “Pardon me a moment.”  He scanned the note, penned a quick reply and tied it back to the owl’s leg.  She hooted softly and flew off with her biscuit.
“No, remember Luna talked about a sacred white horse?  These are carved into the hillsides, or outlined in white stone.  I used to fly around on my broom to look at them.”  Back when he was still interested in such innocent pursuits.
The Owlery was cool and drafty, as usual, and the floor a mess of straw and owl droppings.  It was a peaceful place to pause, among the hundreds of dozing owls, large and small, light and dark, speckled and barred.  But none of them were Hedwig, and now that particular grief flew in and landed hard.
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or plunderer, Borgin…. Though if his grades don’t pick up, that may indeed be all he is fit for.”
“The chief wizards here know secret ways to travel very far quickly,” said the other kitsune.  “One of them is in Osaka now to officiate at the Grand Sumo Tournament.  We could write a message to him for you. You will know him by his splendid robes with the purple trim.  I believe he will help you.”
“I’m sorry. But I’m here now,” Harry said, stepping back. “It’s so wonderful to see you. Where’s Ron?”
Harry pounded his back for him and brought a cup of coffee to wash it down with.  When Malfoy had composed himself, he turned to Harry.  “Say that again.”
he said, and Draco’s heart tore a little to see how easily he did it.   Greyback fell and began to rise again, but Draco and Luna both hit him with Stunning spells, which slowed him a little, and then a group of Order members were circling him and Draco couldn’t get a clear shot.  Rosemonde whirled him away.
He was sweeping around the back of the Manor now, scanning the trees.  “There’s another party of peacocks in the grove on the left,” he said over his shoulder.  “We’d better get out of here.”  A light tingle let him know he’d flown through the old overhead wards.
And felt wind and sunlight on his face. The bells on the sleigh rang sweetly in the frosty morning air. The horses—
“That was painfully clear – you looked horrified when you cracked your eyes enough to see me.  At least, you looked like you’d have been horrified if you could’ve summoned the energy.  ”
Finally Draco said, “I think home will have to be somewhere with an orchard where my-cousin-your-godson can climb my apple trees.”
“You can just tell us if you don’t like how – oh.”  Potter frowned.  “A mirror?  Would it help if you had a mirror, so you could see where our hands were?”
The shop-keeper opened the cage and Gabriel hopped out and onto Harry’s forearm.  The bird swiveled his head back and forth, examining Harry from all angles.  Harry had to smile.
“It was that Thai boyfriend of Neville’s. He asked for taro balls in coconut cream, it’s a Thai pudding. He said if there was Tarot in the name there should be taro on the menu, and ever since there’s been a special every Tuesday. The main courses were so popular, the shop has expanded into a full restaurant, lucky for us.”
but even unlikelier that he chatted with Luna.  Holding someone prisoner in your family’s dungeons wouldn’t seem a promising way to begin a friendship.
Rutherford nearly shredded the message parchment in rage.  Really, it was too much.  Here she was nearly at the Pacific Ocean, and did Potter have the decency to just wait a few more moments for her?  No!
“This Draco.  Think there’s any chance of a happy ending for him?”  Harry turned and lay Draco gently down on the sofa.
It was a complicated dance, but everyone was good humored when they inevitably bumped into each other or made missteps. There was a lot of changing of partners, but even when they were separated Draco often caught Harry smiling over at him, and they always found their way back together. The moonlight silvered over and soothed everything.
The bushy-haired lassie waved a wand at her bookmark and it turned into a horse.  “Ride this, it will take you to her.  But it will turn back into paper in a few hours, so you’d better get started.  Oh, and take this.  It might come in handy.”
But his body still lies on the forest floor.  Harry had asked her to stay close, so she does, and she hears Voldemort order a woman to go see if he is alive.   Narcissa Black hurries over – Narcissa Malfoy now, she remembers – looking haggard.  Narcissa feels for Harry’s heartbeat, and Lily hears her whisper a question to him.  “Is Draco alive?  Is he in the castle?”
“No, she was named for Aurora, the goddess of the Dawn.  Abraxas was also the name of one of the Winged Horses of the Dawn.  He helped pull her chariot, and the chariot of Helios, the Greek god of the sun.  Those great winged palominos that pull Mme Maxime’s carriage are called Abraxans.  My great-grandmother’s family bred some famous ones.”
“Boat-elves? Who knows? There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, Horatio.”
Draco was silent a moment.  “And I suppose all the house-elves love you, Potter?  Including Kreacher?”
Malfoy gave him a narrow look, then nodded.  “No hovering in wait, then, and you have to fly straight up, not forward more than a yard or two.”
“Go even earlier.  Hagrid is the one who welcomed me into the Wizarding world. You called him a savage, when we were getting fitted in Madam Malkin’s.”
“Mine is not to reason why, mine is but to heal and let it cry,” Draco said. “But I wouldn’t object if it found somewhere else to do its moaning.”
Would it have changed Draco’s decisions?  But he would still have been a Malfoy.  Draco tried to imagine who he would be, if he hadn’t been his father’s son.
“Well, he was pretty small when I left.  But he’s a Metamorphmagus like Tonks was, he can change the color of his hair.”
And yet - the May-tree decorations, still up from Beltane celebrations the day before, were lovely - the hawthorns frothing with white blossom and bedecked with colored ribbons.  When he’d been chosen by his first wand, the hawthorn one, at age 11, Draco had imagined that Beltane would be his special festival.  A day marked for happiness.  And now…  he sighed.
“Draco!  You’re here!”  Awe lit Harry’s features.  “But I have to go back. It has to be me, I have to try to finish this.”
The meadow was full of silvery-gray animals like big-eyed cows, upright on two spindly hind legs, performing a stately and intricate dance in the moonlight. They swayed and turned and stepped out a pattern with wide flat feet, treading a design into the meadow grass. Spellbound, Harry gazed.
But instead of joining Harry on the sofa, Draco moved to stand by the window.  “Harry … sexual favors aren’t part of the reparations, offered or owed.”
Sandy hair was quickly forgotten when they were naked in the shower together, all hungry mouths and roaming hands.  The sound of cascading water caught Draco’s cries as he spilled himself into Harry’s mouth.  He barely recognised his face in the steamy mirror when they emerged.  Dark-eyed with lust, stunned with pleasure, wanton.
The woman raised her brows slightly. She was one of the Patil twins, Harry realised – the short hair had thrown him off. He guessed it was Padma; he didn’t remember Parvati being much of a reader. But what was she doing here?
Trying to sense Potter’s location, she was distracted by odd bird-like vibrations coming from the witches with the long blonde hair, and more faintly from the children.  There were wings in their ancestry, she was sure of it.  The two men had nothing bird-like about them, though the tall one with the scarred face had the same type of red hair as some of Potter’s friends.
But the fiery Abraxans of Mme Maxime’s team dwarfed his small chariot, and when she tried to give him driving lessons on a carriage, they were so powerful that they were difficult for him to control.  He wanted a horse that he could guide with one hand if necessary, so that he could use his wand if he had to.
Malfoy cast a furious cleaning charm on the glasses and handed them back.  He turned Harry to face a long mirror.  “Now look at yourself.  Do you see someone who would have killed Dumbledore?”
Harry began to stroke and watched Draco’s mouth fall open and his gaze go soft.  With a surge of protectiveness Harry moved to kiss him.  “You show me now,” he ordered hoarsely, and followed the lead of Draco’s fingers over his own.  Draco’s eyes fell shut and Harry began to kiss him all over his face and throat.
Afterwards they lay in each other’s arms while Harry stroked him lightly.  “You’re amazing,” Harry murmured.  “I just wish you could feel what I do.”
“Well of course I’d want someone with a mind,” Draco said.  “An intelligent mind.  Which would naturally lead them to…”
“Right.  Well then, I guess you’ll just have to go see your rice terraces and tell me about them later.”
Harry lifted the billiard stick and tried casting a protective spell to keep wyverns in and Muggles out. There was a satisfying sizzle of energy. “Good. I’ll Apparate along the perimeter to reinforce them.”
“Neither, although I’d love to learn to drive.  My grandfather died young, and my father never learned.  Your team is magnificent.”
“Well, I wasn’t going to feed him all that cousin/godparent stuff you keep coming up with,” Harry said after his acquaintance had passed by.
He lit the candle and drew back the sheet and saw Draco lying there, just as pale and fair-haired as when he was a white bear.  His eyes were closed, but Harry could see the pointy chin and nose and sharp cheekbones he’d so often touched or kissed or felt nestled against him.  Draco’s night-shirt was open in the front and rumpled up around his waist, so Harry could see his skin and limbs.  And whether he was handsome or not, he was Harry’s dear one, and Harry couldn’t stop looking.  He thought he couldn’t live if he didn’t give Draco a kiss there and then.
Later, after they had made it into bed and were lying quietly, Harry let himself ask.  “So – Luna, and Katie, and Bill…”
A harsh cry rent the air, and Harry felt the brief squeeze of Disapparition. When he and Draco popped back they were tangled together on the ground on the other side of the boundary wards. Apparently Draco could Side-Along from below.
Draco smiled, imagining bringing Teddy for a game of Exploding Snap.  He needed to find a souvenir for Teddy.  No more exotic pets, Andromeda said.
“They’ll look after each other,” Harry said.  “Let’s just sit on the roof and look at the stars.  Maybe we’ll see one of your pea galaxies.”
“Reason not the need, Potter,” Malfoy said with an airy wave of his hand.  “You simply don’t know what you’re missing.”
remember. All week I’ve been trying to figure out how that could be.” Potter began to pace back and forth. “I almost
Potter looked sufficiently horrified that Draco was able to cast a few cleansing and healing charms.  Not until he had rolled Potter’s trouser leg back down over his knobbly knee did Draco say, “Joke, Potter.”
“It seemed clear that I had to rethink everything.  Father had made it sound like there would be a glorious reign of the Dark Lord, protecting the wizarding traditions, but what I saw up close – it was hellish.  And if he was wrong about that – what about all the other things I’d accepted?  I started to think that the things we’d insisted on the hardest were the ones that had no support but prejudice, the ideas that wouldn’t stand up to close examination.  Pure-bloods were supposed to be superior, but Granger was clearly the best student in the school, regardless of how clueless her parents must have been about anything magical.  You wouldn’t know a pure-blood tradition if it bit you, but your raw magic was ridiculously powerful.  Never mind what you could do on a broom.  I was supposed to be the best because I was a Malfoy, but best at what?  At annoying you, maybe, but I couldn’t even be truly effective at that.  Sic a snake on you, and you start a conversation with it.  Do you have any idea what a frustrating person you are, Potter?
They were strolling through a park when clouds returned and it started to rain lightly. Hermione was starting an Umbrella Charm when Padma said, “Oh, but the rain feels nice.”
Not until the birds’ screams were lost in the distance did Draco bring them down to land in a meadow.  “Looks like you got a scratch on your arm.  Did any bite you?”
Only when it vanished did they turn back to the witch. “All right, maybe we would,” Potter said. “I understand. No brooms.”
"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."   (This quotation seems to be from the films rather than the books.)
“Known it would do that.”  Potter gestured to Draco’s legs.  He ducked his head and mumbled, “Known you.”
“Yeah, it has,” Harry smiled at her. “You two should come for dinner.  I’ll fire-call you and we’ll figure out a date.”
“No, the curse is not continuing to act upon the patient.  It will not cause further damage, and his life is not threatened.  But the major nerve damage that has already taken place is, at this point, irreparable.”
There was that gleam again.  “Generous of you to leave some men for the rest of us,” Malfoy murmured.
After dinner Harry and Hermione sat on the sofa and traded tales they’d heard from Luna about her latest adventures, while Draco and Ron played chess at the table.  Harry looked over now and then, but he couldn’t really follow the game – they were either moving faster than he would have, or sitting for long periods of time studying the board. They weren’t conversing, but they weren’t throwing hexes either, which was promising, he supposed.
Draco watched with pleasure as Harry took out the mouthpiece and fitted the various parts of his instrument together.  Harry’s love affair with the saxophone had begun when they had gone to France together after the war.  Draco had needed to take Rosemonde home, thank Mme Maxime and say goodbye to his colleagues in the Reseau.  Harry had wanted to see where Draco lived at Beauxbatons.
And so Rosemonde performed her last war service, as an ambulance horse to bring the unconscious body of Severus Snape back to the medical care that saved his life.
Malfoy frowned.  “They’re crooked now.”  This time his fingers touched only the sides of the frames as he made a minute adjustment.
Rutherford, a clever and nimble owl, had learned to roll and attach a scroll herself, which made it simple for Draco to post them off.
“There was a lot. Er, of choices,” Harry added, not wanting to reveal too much of his hungry childhood.
“But the being, um, friends with you… I wonder if we might give that a chance here? Just take it slow, go for a walk or have lunch sometimes?”
“I’d make the most effective use of a brief opportunity.  Reforming my father’s character would take a bit longer.  Or perhaps you know a spell to eradicate one’s past beliefs?  It’s not so simple.”
“Ah.  I, er, haven’t seen you around for a while, Potter.”  Of course, that could be because Draco hadn’t much felt like going anywhere.
When Draco first saw the Hand of Glory, it seemed Darkly cool, macabre, powerful.  By the time he needed it, gruesome things held no appeal, but he saw no other way.  So Draco clutched a dead man’s shriveled hand, and led Death Eaters through Hogwarts by its sickening glow.
Potter hung about for a bit and finally left again with Lovegood, thanking them as he went for taking care of the injured Mooncalf.
The moon came out again and revealed an exuberance of small squid lighting up the water, diving and shooting back up again, propelling themselves in beautiful synchrony as they flashed and flickered. The patterns flowed one into the next like a kaleidoscope or fireworks display. Finally all the squid shot up into the air at once, brilliant as sparklers, and fell back into the pond with a splash.
“I’m not,” Draco said.  “Chinese medicine uses fungus that’s famous for its healing properties.  Perhaps that is the Numinous Mushroom.”
, Harry thought, looking back at his former nemesis with the dirty mouth.   A very amused looking mouth, at the moment, with a smile that was teasing but – here was a change – not malicious.
“I’m looking for Hagrid. Is that enough reason for being at Hagrid’s hut?  Are you his social secretary or something, Potter?”
“I find it very calming just to watch the wheel turn round,” said the lassie, “but I see that it’s a bit awkward to travel with.”  She waved a wand at it until it shrank down to a wee little thing like a toy, and Harry tucked it in his pocket.  Then she whistled and soon Harry felt a little breeze and heard a horse nickering next to the lassie.  She seemed to be petting something, but he couldn’t see hide nor hair of any horse.
Draco swallowed, hit with something like grief. Apparently he didn’t hide it well enough, because Potter looked at him with a hint of concern.
“Yes – anything.”  The cacophony of rain loosened Draco’s restraint and he cried aloud in passion as Harry’s hot mouth closed over his straining cock.  He came quickly, slumping against the wall, eyes dark, face softened.
Harry was looking stricken. “No one has seen an Acromantula here in ages.  I thought they were gone.”
“Er, well, I’ve been appointed Centaur Liaison.  So the more I know the better, I suppose.”  He held very still as a bony little half-grown thestral sniffed his robes and shuffled its leathery wings.
“Thank goodness he couldn’t get the aeroplane,” Hermione put in. “They didn’t sound safe at all. There’s only one left, and it’s in a museum.”
In the long hallway Narcissa took Harry past one portrait after another of haughty-looking Malfoys without comment.  When she paused, it was to point out some resemblance to Draco.
’d the thing out of Potter’s hands.  There were little dots scurrying about, labelled with people’s names. Intriguing.
“I told you he was a Chinese cultural hero,” said Harry. “Those acrobatics in the fight scenes were amazing.”
?  Harry grinned and extended a hand.  Wuffley nodded and shook it, not taking the pipe from his mouth.  He seemed to be an elf of few words.
Ah well, at least the fire Riddle lit dried the mildew out of me, though I got quite trampled afterwards in the battle.  Dumbledore wouldn’t have let me get mildewed, but Snape rather neglected me.  A brave man – Dumbledore did say perhaps we sort too soon – but Snape so
Potter turned to go, but somehow Draco’s hand shot out and caught his.  Potter looked at his hand.  He didn’t say anything, but handed Draco his glasses and got into the bed on the other side.  He turned his face to the wall and soon Draco could hear that he was asleep.  Draco fell asleep.  Potter was gone when he awoke.
He ran into Potter again at Flourish and Blotts.  Still Glamoured, but Draco recognized the way Potter stood even before he spoke.
He lost track of time, sitting on the hard floor, listening to Draco murmur to the dog, thinking of his own losses.
But why would Potter invite Draco on a date at all?  Maybe he meant just play at being on a date – a pretend date.  To fool the newspaper, or something.  That made more sense.
“I am so sorry, Herman, are you all right?” Draco asked anxiously. “What went wrong? The pond should be clean, I just filled it with fresh water.”
A breeze was pushing dark clouds across the sky as he opened the gate of his reed fence to see, sitting on the porch with the cat on his lap, a smiling Draco Malfoy.  Harry’s jaw dropped.
“Yeah and they eat wolverine stew!  And she has a dogsled and the dogs’ names are Melvin, Louise, Phoebe, and – and –”
“The New Guinean Nubbumping Humdinger, you heard it here first.” Draco smiled at Harry. “Luna was the first person generous enough to accept my offer of Magical Repairs and Reparations.  I try to do what she asks.  It’s never dull.”
“It’s not safe for you, either, is it?  You think I want to sit around while you’re off risking your neck?”
“He claims he’s ‘off the market’ because he’s in love. With Harry Potter, no less. Well, he’s no son of mine!”
Harassing Potter was less interesting when he didn’t fight back, so Draco decided to shame him instead with a show of his superior knowledge, and they worked on their homework together for a while.
Greg looked happy again.  They never talked much.  Greg offered to arm-wrestle.  Draco remembered that he was supposed to build up arm strength.  “Just hold your arm up,” he said, and pushed against it for as long as he could, getting nowhere.  “Now you can push.”  Greg easily bent his arm to the table.
Finally Harry grew tired of the impasse.  He wasn’t about to stand there all day, so he shrugged his shoulders, lifted his leg, and stepped forward.  The monkey dropped off.  Another one took a flying leap at Harry’s pack, but it was securely buckled on, and then he was walking across the bridge to the other side.
One could always count on Harry to be ready to eat, so they discussed their travel plans further over Kung Pao chicken, 5-spice green beans and “fish-fragrant” eggplant – which was not fishy at all, but garlicky and delicious.
Father had a formidable collection of dark artefacts, but it was Draco who had the knack of magical work on objects.  His father dismissed it as tradesman’s tinkering.  What Father really collected was influence – well-calculated flattery, a favor here, a threat there, a discreet bribe, an ostentatious donation, a strategic loophole.
Just as well Draco had so obviously been a prat back then, Harry thought.  Imagine if they’d become friends and Harry’d spent holidays at the Manor instead of the Burrow.  A child in Lucius Malfoy’s orbit.  He shuddered.
She frowned at it.  “The Forest is a dangerous place, as you are aware.  Professor Firenze would be the natural choice to assist you, but he is traveling.  Most of the Hogwarts faculty and staff have left for their summer holidays; I am about to leave myself.  That means there will be little support for you should something go wrong.”
Draco edged through the crowd at Luna and Millicent’s going-away party, looking for a place to sit. He spied an empty sofa. Granger occupied a chair on the far side of it, but he could take the near end. He was just about to sink into the cushions and rest his feet when Weasley appeared and flung himself down onto the sofa at the end nearest Granger. Of course.
“Not so pale,” Harry replied. He wrapped his arms around him and admired the pink flush on his lover’s skin.  He leaned forward to suck a rosy nipple into his mouth until it was hard as a bud and Draco was gasping. Harry licked the other nipple to a peak. “Beautifully pointy.”
“I believe she is Rhiannon, riding from the Otherworld on her pale magic horse.  Her first name was Rigantona, the great goddess.  They called her Epona, the horse goddess, on the continent.  But the statue left out her birds.”
Oh.  “Harry,” Draco said, a tender discovery.  And he was drawn up into a kiss, and urgent embrace, and they moved against each other in the morning light.
He should have protested, but Draco was in fact a bit vain about his handwriting, and Miranda looked so pleased.  He even let her use his owl, Rutherford.  Draco never had occasion to write Potter himself, so it’s not likely Potter would know it was Draco’s owl.  He helped Miranda tie the little scroll to Rutherford’s leg, and they watched her fly off.
“My cousin is Mr Potter’s godson,” Draco added, to Harry’s surprise.  It seemed to satisfy the students.
Suddenly Malfoy’s body tensed.  Harry quickly closed his eyes and feigned sleep.  He felt Malfoy slip out of the bed.  When he heard the sound of the shower, he jumped up and pulled on his clothes.  When Draco emerged from the shower, already dressed, he looked a little pink in the face as he wished Harry good morning.  “Here, let me get you a towel,” he added.  “You’ll want a shower.  Um - did you sleep all right?”
Drawn by the irresistible aroma of mince pie, she came closer. A whole pie all for her!  Nibbling delicately, she spied something yellow and fluffy nearby. She pawed it and it slid partway onto her foot.
The Anggitay smiled at him and waved.  The jewels on her hands sparkled, and the bells on her anklets jingled as she turned to go.
“Just advice,” Harry said. “Do you know a good place to buy a supply of high quality Darjeeling tea?”
He heard a cry from behind him.  Draco was crossing the bridge, trying to slide through a group of travelers to reach him.
“He is my son. Malfoys protect our own.”  Draco and Harry shared a look that was perhaps not as private as they hoped, because his father added dryly, “As you may have gathered.”
Malfoy regarded him in silence for a moment, then said “Alright.  Not here, though, I really do need shade.  Come on, then.”
“Aren’t we all?  Though as I have some responsibility for how he got those scars, it might put a damper on things.”  Malfoy sighed.  “Leaving aside my love life, there should be a little information about your flowers in here.  It’s a rather basic guide.”
Harry shifted closer, and then Draco leaned in and brushed his lips against Harry’s, just briefly but a sweet jolt shot through Harry.
“Well, it is my home we’re talking about.  Let’s see.  Monkeys turn up sometimes, to tease my cat.  I have a brilliant cat.  I don’t have enough of a garden to have been raided by baboons, luckily – they’re nasty customers.  Once or twice I’ve heard a hyena whooping at night, off in the distance.  That’s about it for big animals, unless you count the neighbors’ dogs.  Then there are birds, bats, snakes, lizards, geckos.  The toad that took up residence in the cat’s water bowl.  Oh, and the millipedes.”
“Hmm.”  Harry couldn’t see anything, so he thought he’d better check.  He stretched a hand over to feel for fur.
They didn’t go under his robes, he watched. Finally they finished with his upper thighs, and it was Potter who drew the robes back down over his legs.  Potter straightened up and shook his hands out from the wrists, as if he was trying to shake water off them.
“Sichuan, maybe? It could be a good place to compare meditation and healing techniques.  According to the book, there’s a mountain sacred to Buddhism there and another one sacred to Taoism.  And” - Harry grinned again, which lit up his face distractingly –  “a giant Buddha carved right out of the face of a cliff, how cool is that?”
“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up at Draco backlit by candlelight, wanting nothing more than to reach up and pull that warm body down to him.  But this was Draco Malfoy, who had been his enemy so long. Who was now, at best, unknown.  Who was passing through this place just long enough to be confusing.  If – if something happened, well then it did, but no one was going to say he started it.  In the dark, if they didn’t talk, afterward it could be like nothing had happened at all.
“I will not!” said Princess Millicent, throwing the night-shirt on the ground.  “Let him wash his own clothes!  Who needs night-shirts anyway?”
Harry shook himself.  “Enjoy your coffee.”  But when Malfoy eventually left, the cup was still full.
“Potter! POTTER!” he yelled, but got no response.  It was still difficult for him to transfer into his chair and get up, so he called out again.
A little later, Harry went over.  “You never drink what I make you anyway,” Harry said.  “I don’t know why you come here.”
“Do you think the dragon will keep his word to leave other people alone, now that he didn’t get to eat me?” Harry said.
He hadn’t been, actually – Harry really never danced and it hadn’t occurred to him that the music mattered much.  He tuned in and heard the singer crooning
But when he brought it over, Malfoy had his nose in a book and barely looked up. He sipped the coffee, frowned, set it down, pushed it away and – went on reading, pausing now and then to write in a notebook with a fountain pen.  He ignored the coffee as it cooled.
“Hm,” said Pansy. “In that case….” She raised her voice. “Weasley, what are you doing Tuesday night?”
Drawn by some sixth sense for biscuits, Old Timer meandered into the room and pressed against Draco’s leg.
“I fixed the broken frames, but that wasn’t the worst of it.  When’s the last time you cleansed these glasses, Potter?”
Following an interestingly spicy lunch at an Indian restaurant later in the week, they sat on a park bench for a bit.  On the next bench, a grandmotherly woman bounced a toddler on her knee and chanted,
Charlie Weasley glanced between the two of them thoughtfully and then invited Draco to join them for lunch.
Lavender ran outside, bursting with the news. Harry Potter kissing, of all people, Draco Malfoy? She didn’t know what to think. And they’d looked so happy, so caught up in each other, and…
After a moment Malfoy shrugged and undid a couple of buttons at the top of his robe.  He pushed the collar aside, revealing the tip of a thin scar that began just under his collarbone.
Harry was starting to feel hot in all directions.  “It’s a line from a poem!” he said desperately.  “Medieval poetry!”
Something clicked.  Malfoy’s wife – Delphine? – had died giving birth to… “Mira Altair,” Harry said.
He was close to dropping off when he heard the whine of a mosquito close by.  Secure in the knowledge that he was surrounded by net, he ignored it.  Until he was bitten.  Without his glasses, Harry couldn’t see the bug, but he knew one must’ve got into the net, and now he was trapped in there with it.  Damn – the whining was louder, how many were in there? Only the night mosquitoes carried malaria, but there were other insect-borne diseases, too.  While wizard blood offered protection against some diseases, like HIV, it gave no immunity to others.  Besides, the itchiness of the bites was annoying.
As the bus jolted to the side of the road to load and unload passengers at Nathenje, food vendors rushed up to the windows.  “Hungry?” Harry asked, looking out the window to see what was offered.
“Would you care for a biscuit, Potter?  Be my guest.  Sorry we haven’t any tea.” Malfoy turned to the girl.  “Satisfied?”
“Shut the door,” Harry said from behind the counter.  “It’s snowing out there and the wind is wicked.”
“So much for being mellow with the monkeys,” Draco muttered. “That little thug almost bit you.  Harry Potter, mugged by a monkey.”
It wasn’t completely dark outside; the moon was full, somewhere behind the snow clouds. The night was peaceful, with the snow drifting gently down, muffling the sounds of their steps. But Potter was bending down to scoop some up into a ball. “Good packing snow,” he said, turning with a mischievous smile.
After a moment Draco spoke gently.  “Maybe she had owlets before you met her, Harry.  Maybe one of her great-grandchildren is out there just waiting for a good home with you.”
Harry shook his head. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think people would be so worried, once Voldemort was gone.”
Now Harry laughed. And as they walked toward the stands Malfoy explained how he had overheard someone on a Muggle street telling a friend excitedly that she had just bought a Wessex Wyvern. He was startled, wondering if it was an illicit trade in magical beasts, but he had inquired where she got it, and was given an address. When he cautiously approached the place he found it was a musical instrument showroom that specialised in tubas.
Harry looked up from the package to Draco in disbelief. “She’s sent a knitted gift and mince pie for the Humdinger, and a round-trip Portkey for us. Oh, and a bell so we can ding for it.”
The hand at his waist moved to splay out over his abdomen and press him back firmly.  He heard Draco’s breath catch.  “There?” Draco whispered, turning his face toward Harry’s, so close.
“We can’t let him stop us,” Granger said.  “We may have to contact people in other departments.  Write up what you know and I’ll think about strategy.  With some international networking and research we should be able to verify deforestation rates and the existence of the Anggitay. When we have more information, we will have to think of proposals too.  What can the magical world do to reduce stress on the environment?”
Draco acknowledged her with a bow.  The hippogriff regarded him, unblinking.  There was a certain fierce beauty to her.  After the memory of the Dark Lord’s vicious megalomania, this animal’s haughty wildness felt clean.  She gave a shrill cry and shook out her wings, and it was as if the dust of the ordinary was blown away, and a spaciousness opened in his heart.
Ron looked horrified. “No need to go looking for new recipes, Mum, we love your cooking just the way it is!”
The monkey looked at him and then at all the other people holding out food and shaking sticks.  It sat next to Harry in silence for a moment, and slipped its hand into Harry’s.  Then it jumped down and away.
Potter was smiling steadily now and Draco felt himself about to fall into those green eyes again, when a shadow passed overhead.
The next year brought such Darkness and death that Draco choked, as if those lifeless fingers strangled hope, and he couldn’t shake their grip.
Draco used his arms more these days, to support him in getting in and out of the chair and bed, and the attention to them felt good.  He happened to be facing left, and stole an occasional look at Potter’s face.  Potter’s brow was furrowed in concentration.  It was novel to have that determination being exercised on his behalf, for once.
“They follow the line of the hillsides.  I hear they’re beautiful from above, all green and silver, sun glinting off the water.”
“Hello! Merfley is here with our first patient!” The house-elf beamed and bounced up and down on his toes. They were encased in pale pink ballet shoes.
A Chinese magical healer had told him that his magical energy, though strong, was not flowing freely, as if it had been contorted around some other shape that was no longer there. Even though the sliver of Voldemort's soul was gone, an imprint was left. In the calm solitude of the mountains, Harry’s spirit had gradually uncrumpled. Eventually he felt at peace. And then, in time, lonely.
Hermione sighed and pushed her hair back. “We’ll always care about each other, after all we went through together. But we’re better off with other partners.”
So Harry made something different.  When he brought it over, Malfoy was absorbed in his reading again.  There was an inkstain on the side of his nose.
“It’s serious,” Draco said.  “But at least they are talking, we are talking, trying to figure something out.  If we can listen, and respect each other, and work together….”
Draco was grinding against him, tugging Harry’s shirt off and pulling him into a kiss.  “So?” Harry asked when they broke for air.
Harry and Draco stayed in Gustavus overnight and flew to Juneau the next day, spotting some whales en route.  The Owl Post office there offered Portkey reset services.  “Is there anywhere else you want to see before we go to San Francisco?” Harry asked.  “We’re so close to Canada, and seeing that moose made me think of…”
Narcissa must have felt the same.  “We have to say good-bye now, dear.  Mummy will come back and visit you again.”
“One last carol for the Humdinger.” Draco rang the bell and with their arms wrapped around each other, they hummed “Joy to the World.”
“That’s accidental underage magic and it’s perfectly normal,” Draco said.  “The only unusual thing is that you didn’t realise you were a wizard.”
“Face like a white – pointiness.” The gingernuts were flying faster now and Harry had to duck.  “Stop, you’re scaring your owl,” he laughed, as Ignatius screeched a protest and flew into Malfoy’s bedroom.
“I don’t suppose you have a spare broom?” Harry said, watching Gabriel fly lazy circuits over the grass.
Harry laughed a little, which seemed to relax him enough to let the tip of Draco’s cock in.  He gasped then, and clutched Draco’s bicep with one hand.
“Well, maybe if you stayed put somewhere, you could make a fresh start – do something you could be proud of.”
in a bang. Harry fell back from the force of the explosion, but Draco could see he was unhurt. Voldemort, struck by his own rebounding death curse, crumpled.
There was a little silver bell on the table.  Harry stood and picked it up. He was a little sore from the long trip, and he thought a hot bath might be nice.   He couldn’t remember ever having one, because the Dursleys always made him wash in cold water.
It was an unusually successful lesson, Harry thought afterwards.  The students were involved, they were thinking, they were discussing ideas.  He wanted to talk about it with someone.
“What are you doing here?” Harry continued, still a bit dazed.  Malawi was poor, obscure, placid and friendly – nothing to interest a Malfoy.  Unless….  “How did you find me?” he added suspiciously.
Harry shrugged, trying to look nonchalant, to speak coolly.  “Let me know when you’ve decided what you want.”  He turned away.  From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Malfoy’s smile falter.
“Wuffley, this is Harry Potter and his owl Gabriel.  They will be our guests.  And this is my cat Fern, I don’t believe you’ve met.  Potter, this is Wuffley, the skipper of the
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t want to.” He looked up. “Why do I have to answer all the questions, Harry? Why don’t you ever talk about your own feelings?”
“I do, in fact,” Malfoy said, turning back to the cottage.  He returned with two brooms, one sturdy and stable for long rides, one light and quick for agility.
Draco looked at him silently. Artemis shook out her feathers and Draco went over to where she was perched and stroked her. “It was that kind of a year,” he said. “I almost killed a number of people and I’m sorry about all of them.” He looked up. “We’re both still alive, though. Can we talk about something else?”
The next day, the bear came by to see if he was ready to go back to their castle yet.  “Yes!” said Harry, and back they went.
“Æthelflæd, this is Luna Lovegood. She has an interest in some of the most, er, uncommon magical beasts. Luna, this is Æthelflæd, our veterinarian.”
The dragon scoffed. “I am the son of the great Zmey Gorynych, Fire-Snake of the Mountain! Tremble before me!”
By the time Potter was finished, Draco was feeling so turned on and generous that he was determined to reciprocate.  “Come on, Potter, your turn.”
“They were dangerous. You’re the one who rides dragons and Hippogriffs, Potter. I’m a coward, remember?”
Draco would have asked about this puzzling statement, but Harry’s eyes were lost in some unhappy place.  Draco shifted slightly so that his fingers brushed Harry’s.  He felt an electric tingle at the contact.  Harry glanced up and smiled at him, and something hummed in the air between them.
“I wrote to them and offered my services, a couple of years ago.  I know I owe them both, for –  foul language, and that damn bottle of wine. And for saving Greg.  Hermione wrote back and said she’d let me know. I took that to be a polite brush-off, as I’ve never heard from her since.”
.  I mean magical decontamination.  I had to spell all manner of toxic curse residue off of these, not to mention Dementor slime, Wrackspurt dust…  It’s a wonder you could see out of them at all.”
Harry continued to kiss and suck his throat, his jaw, his earlobes.  Draco caught his breath and arched back against him, and Harry felt himself growing hard.  “So,” Harry murmured between kisses, “What about his son?”  His hands found their way under the fabric and roamed across Draco’s chest.  Draco pulled one hand down to his crotch and pushed his growing erection against it.
Malfoy shook his head. “No one’s seen a wyvern in Wessex for over a hundred years. They aren’t even listed in
“I wouldn’t even be reading Chaucer if it weren’t for you.  And Padma.  Did you know she has a cousin who studies literature?”
“Oh very well, that shouldn’t take long,” said his aunt, taking the shirt and giving it to the princess.
Malfoy sat back, considering.  “Maybe your ears are at different heights.  That’s all right, I can adjust them.”  He began to reach for his wand, but Harry was faster.
“That’s true,” Draco said.  He didn’t speak again until they reached the house, where he left the market bags by the door.  “I’m going for a walk.”
is the word, Malfoy.  And you seem to have more need of my coffee than I do of your knowledge of medieval literature.”
“I don’t know, Harry, don’t interrupt the creative process.  You have to get the ideas first and sort them later.  Could be 'lions three', I suppose, but that’s a bit obvious.”
“Mostly monks,” Harry said. Well, and there had been a spry elderly Buddhist nun in a cave to the west of his hut, but he didn’t think that was what Ron meant. “How are your parents?”
“Sorry to bother you,” he began – damn, he’d forgotten the wand again – “but I was wondering.  How did you come to have my glasses that day?”
“Isn’t that a marvelous book?” Padma said, coming from the back of the shop.  “I’ve decided to learn Sanskrit.  So much of my cultural heritage
Padma laughed. “Draco tried for a while to go under the name Wystan Wyvern, but everyone figured it out. And then he got a bit obsessed. That car’s a – what is it again Hermione?”
“She says many of the reasons why people cut the forests are to do with money, and the coming and going of money crosses many borders.”
Draco cupped Harry’s arse in his hands.  It was warm and round, and grounded him. Harry was shifting around a little now, experimenting with positions.  Finally he seemed to find the angle he was looking for, and the rhythm.   He began to ride with abandon, faster and faster with little cries that made Draco’s heart speed up.
“What on earth is that?” Harry asked.  Along with a large bowl, a flat board, and a rotating circular stand, the thing had a central column that sprouted tubes, spoons, whisks and knives, all whirring. It looked hazardous.
.  The rhyme was forced, in her opinion.  The longer poem was more pleasing, plus it had quite a bit about birds in the middle part, and the parchment was better quality.
Harry groped for his glasses.  They felt a little odd on his face.  “Then why can’t I see you properly?  And what happened to the one who was hexing me?”
The owl turned and flew toward them.  Draco caught a glimpse of the heart-shaped white face – a barn owl.  This time Fern took a flying leap as the owl passed by.  Draco ran to pick her up as she landed.  For the first time, she struggled in his arms as he carried her inside.  Outside, he heard the screech of the owl.
At the cabin Draco waved Harry in, pointed out the bathroom, grabbed a paperback book and left.  Harry looked around.  One bed had slightly rumpled sheets and a few things by the bedside stand, and the mosquito net was hanging down.  Clearly Draco was sleeping there.  On the other bed the sheets were crisp, the stand was empty, and the mosquito net was tied up in a bundle above it.  Harry untied the net, kicked off his flip-flops, and put his glasses on the bedside stand.  He hesitated a moment, then took off his khaki shorts and peeled off his sweaty T-shirt, and climbed into bed in just his pants. In the familiar tropical ritual, he lifted the mattress on all sides to tuck in the mosquito net until it spread above him like a gauzy tent, then lay back to sleep.
“I’m so glad for you,” Harry said, and he was, couldn’t help but be glad when Ron was so clearly overjoyed.
“My turn,” Harry said, taking the mistletoe and holding it over Draco’s head. He wrapped his other arm around Draco’s waist and kissed him again.
“Good dog, good boy,” Draco said, stroking Old Timer’s head. He turned to Harry. “Do what we can? But that’s what I asked. What can I do?”
Sobbing… thorn bushes… rain… “The Augurey! It’s found its voice again!” he exclaimed, just as the rain picked up. “My potions worked!” He had to raise his voice over the sound of raindrops bouncing off the Umbrella Charm Potter had hastily put up to cover both of them.
It was another steep green mountain, dotted with curly-roofed shrines and temples where pink joss sticks sent up clouds of fragrant incense, although the statues inside were different from the Taoist ones.  Birds sang in the trees as they hiked up endless stone steps.  Draco kept stopping to look at plants, many of which grew nowhere else.
It wouldn’t have worked on people.  Draco assumed.  Really, his father was not a fruitful topic for conversation.
“Just get in,” Draco said in a voice of resignation, pulling back the covers on his bed.  “It’s late, I need to sleep, you need to sleep, it’s cold and I don’t have the patience to wait for this room to stop fooling around.  Or for you to fumble about trying to Transfigure something into a bed.  Just don’t touch me.”
“What are you talking about?  Rule over the local merpeople?  No, Potter, I don’t think I could keep a bubble-head charm going that long.”
They might be all right, then.  Draco grinned foolishly at Potter – Harry – who grinned as foolishly back, ducked his head, said “See you,” and disappeared into his own room.
Harry shucked off his mittens (wet but warm), felt around, wincing, and found his wand inside his jacket. It looked different from the wand he was used to, but it felt right and worked fine. He sat on the one large bed.
Perhaps Potter wasn’t a complete idiot after all.  Even if he was a hypocrite and would-be murderer.
“Can’t fly,” Harry finished with him, wondering where Malfoy had picked up this Lovegoodian lore about non-existent creatures.  It seemed unlikely he subscribed to
“Her note said she used the same charm she’d been using on my mittens. What’s the point of using a charm to keep a pair of mittens together if you only make one mitten?”
Draco came up to stand directly behind him.  Startled, Harry moved slightly, and felt a light touch at his waist to keep him in place.  Draco’s face was next to his, to look along Harry’s line of sight, his other hand on Harry’s shoulder.  “Where?” Draco murmured, close enough that Harry could feel the puff of his breath.
“You’ll learn fast.  Look how well you balance on a broom; it’ll transfer.  Come on.  I’ll keep an eye out for a rental place.”
“Lovely language they speak here,” Draco mused.  “Still, when it comes to seduction, Potter, you could use some lessons.”
“Do you know how to get in touch with her?  I’m looking for more information on Chinese astronomy, and I thought she might know someone I could ask.  I have a theory about the different personalities of the centaurs related to the two different centaur constellations, Sagittarius and Centaurus.
They said their goodbyes and Ron and Hermione walked off, Hermione giving one last curious look over her shoulder.
“Apocryphal,” Hermione murmured, taking a cake. “He fought off Vikings and kept the peace, commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, had Latin books translated into Old English, set up schools, and promoted literacy.”
The Centaur Liaison Office was essentially a joke, but Draco could hardly say that.  He thought fast.  “Centaurs read the stars, and I am well versed in astrology.”
“I’m leaving.  These people are incompetent.  Mother, let’s go.” His mother left the room with him, but when he demanded to go to the Manor, she demurred.
Years in the chosen solitude of the Zhongnan Mountains of China had left Harry unprepared for the bustle of the International Portkey Terminal. But at least he would be able to relax at Ron and Hermione’s, in the accepting warmth of their friendship. “Our Floo is always open for you, Harry, you know that,” Hermione had always said, and though he hadn’t been in touch for a long time, he trusted her promise.
Draco looked disgusted.  “I don’t want your stupid gold, you stupid man.  Potter wants to visit you for some stupid reason.  You’d better not hurt him.”   He turned around and left while Aunt Petunia was still fussing about what the neighbours would think if they noticed a bear at the house.
It was warmer at the lower elevation and Harry decided to hike in shorts.  They were almost at the end of the hike.  Draco stopped to look at another rare plant, telling Harry he would catch up.  As he walked, Harry ate the last of his snacks to lighten his pack.
“Maybe Herman is not reaching his full growth yet,” Merfley said, giving Draco a reproachful look. “But he is brave to help his brothers and sisters.” He set the cauldron down gently on a nearby bench.
She would not be able to track Potter while she was agitated, so Rutherford caught a vole to calm her nerves.  It had a piquant flavor, perhaps from the herbs it ate. French food truly was good….
“Some people may wonder why I didn’t choose a pure-blood, but when you meet the right one, you just know.”
“Bring Potter. Though…” She tapped her cheek thoughtfully. “If I’m to be ganged up on by Gryffindors, I’ll need another Slytherin along for support.  Draco, you come too.”
, Potter.”  Malfoy rolled his eyes.  “You seem to be taking excellent care of the Wrackspurts, they must have a colony nesting inside your head.”
The young Mooncalf had began to run forward but stopped and turned to Harry and Draco. It stood and danced a few steps, facing them. Then it dipped its head and ran again toward its fellows.
“Yeah.  Well – maybe for that bit, anyway, you weren’t to blame, if you were doing the best you could.”  Harry himself couldn’t quite believe he was saying that.
They could see it from a long way away, a figure stretching more than 350 feet along the hillside, cut in trenches filled with chalk.  The long lean lines of the White Horse flowed over the green slopes, its legs outstretched, its neck arched, ancient and sleek and lively.
Next morning they continued the steep climb and finally reached the peak, with views down into the “Sea of Clouds”.  They rested a while and then walked on, finally stopping for the night at a tiny monastery.
Draco bowed slightly. “Greetings.  I have brought you something.”  He held out a small flowering centaury plant.  “I brought it from a hillside in Uffington.  My friend – my loved one – and I flew out to see the great White Horse there.”
Dumbledore had informed his Order that Draco and his family were to be protected, so after the funeral arrangements were made to hide them both.  Snape told Voldemort that the Order had learned of Draco’s intention to kill Dumbledore, and that they had lured Narcissa to Hogwarts on the pretence that Draco was ill, then killed both of them in revenge.
She tore up some bamboo leaves until her temper had cooled.  A scops owl was looking askance at her.  Rutherford attempted to explain, wanting advice or at least sympathy, but the owl, while polite, didn’t seem to understand her situation at all.
“Are you going to make a Christmas present to make it feel better, Mum? Who’s going to deliver it, then?” Ron grinned.
“The part with the Kraken—it’s like the Giant Squid, only meaner—that part was scary, but the parts with you were, er, good,” Harry said.  “Where I was.”
Except that this time when Draco reached the top of the stairs, letter in hand, Potter was there, lounging about. Draco would never work up the nerve to send the letter with Potter looking on, so he Vanished it right away.
Harry was speechless.  Was this some kind of ploy?  To what purpose, though?  He saw no signs of the old calculating intelligence behind those pale eyes.
Draco twisted a finger around a whorl of hair on Potter’s chest, considering.  He appreciated the hairiness, but was it really a defining characteristic?  Still, it was a more conciliatory nickname than Scarhead, he thought, tonguing a bud of nipple to make up for past unkindness.
“I wasn’t trying to kill you, Malfoy.  I’ve been trying to tell you, I’m really sorry about what happened.”
Perhaps the Deluminator knew what he should do and where he needed to go.  He certainly didn’t, anymore.  He clicked it, watched a ball of light emerge, let that enter him, and Disapparated.
He couldn’t look at Harry, didn’t want to see the realization dawn.  He heard Harry’s intake of breath.
Potter only grinned.  “It’s a noble calling.  Just think of all the Hogwarts students next fall who will be refreshed by juice from these pumpkins.  When I got here, I thought it was the best drink ever.”
Here’s Lily’s son now, Harry – one of those I brought the sword for, and an interesting case for sorting.  Looks like the Headmistress has called someone else in too…  ah, the Malfoy boy that Dumbledore was so worried about.  He seems worried himself, looking at Dumbledore’s portrait.  See him square his shoulders.  He’s apologizing to the portrait!  Harry and McGonagall look surprised.  The air in the room is thawing.
But Ron, oddly enough, agreed with Hermione.  “I hate to say it, but… opposites attract and all that.”
“Was it ever all over with?”  Malfoy sighed.  “I was rather hoping never to have to ask you for anything again.”
“How is Goyle, then?” Harry asked uncomfortably.  Crabbe and Goyle had been goons, but inseparable.  “Did he go to Europe like the other…”
The lassie took Harry’s hand and helped him get on to a warm bony back behind a pair of leathery wings, though he couldn’t see a bit of it.
Draco smiled.  “And now here I am with a half-written thesis and a lover who used to be an enemy and then saved the world and then opened up a Muggle-ish coffee shop.  Which won’t sell me a cup of Darjeeling.  And what‘s your story?”
“I’ve left them too long already. And I’m on house arrest, there isn’t very far I can fly.” Draco turned back to the papers and picked up a quill.
Rutherford declined the drink, but thanked him.  The animal, who said he was a tanuki, told her that owls in Japan were not wizarding messengers.  “Try a kitsune for that.  A fox.  Look for them at an Inari shrine, there are always a pair.  I hear at the big shrine in Kyoto there are hundreds of them.  Look for red-orange gates called torii.  Thousands of torii at that shrine!  Winding up a mountain. Go north.”
Harry drew in a sharp breath.  Suddenly he wasn’t even sure how many loaded topics they were discussing – being a wizard? Being gay?  Being a neglected child locked in a cupboard under the stairs?  And since when did Malfoy call him Harry?
“Nothing dark, don’t worry.  Dark magic interferes with one’s free will, and Great Aunt Winonia was a willful woman and fiercely opposed to it.  She spelled the boat not to permit anything dark aboard – I told you she was a black sheep.  No, I imagine she smuggled brandy, like any good Moonraker.”
They were ready to head out at dawn, but stopped to help a short smiling monk who was trying to replace a light bulb just out of reach overhead in a hallway.  Draco had the longest arms.  “Just screw it in clockwise,” Harry told him, and Draco looked gratified when the bulb lit up under his hand.  The monk nodded his shaven head in thanks.
Glacier Bay was gorgeous and some of the ice was the same beautiful blue as the snake, who slipped onto it and slid away without a backward glance.   They flew close to some of the calving glaciers but learned not to fly too low, after Draco was nearly drenched by the huge splash made by enormous chunks of ice falling into the sea.
“Oh, are you studying hippomancy?  How interesting.  I’ve always suspected we could learn a lot about the future from horses.”
“You kept it!” Draco exclaimed in delight as he examined it.  “I’m touched.  Didn’t know you were so sentimental.”
“Something wrong? Have a drink, you’ll feel better!” said a friendly looking animal that Rutherford couldn’t place – a sort of cross between a dog and a raccoon.
That night, after a dinner of Sichuan dumplings in spicy sauce, he spent half an hour blowing into the flute without getting more than a couple of squawks of sound.  At least it looked nice.  In time, maybe he could coax music from it.
When Harry arrived at their agreed upon meeting place, he saw Draco pulling up in the vintage car. “Are you really going to drive this?” Harry asked.
His class bent over their shared books in groups of two or three.  They took turns reading aloud, and together sorted out who the characters were and what happened.
Potter had left and returned with a small mirror, maybe from his own bathroom.  “Try lying on your stomach and we’ll stick it to the headboard, unless you want to hold it.”
There was a silence before Ron spoke.  “Hermione said you were with him that day on the street, but I didn’t believe it.
“You know,” Harry said slowly, “I’m kind of an expert on scars.  And I think – I hope – that scars themselves are not ugly.  The curses that make them are.  But the scars just show what we have managed to survive.”
“Because I’m such a brave warrior?” Harry nuzzled Draco’s neck, running his hands up Draco’s sides and down his front.
Harry kissed back.  It had been so long, so long.  He was getting hard.  “What do we do?” he panted when they moved up for air.
Lucius Malfoy rose from a chair by the marble fireplace.  Physically, the man looked as Harry remembered first seeing him – tall and impeccably dressed, supremely self-assured, his hair a silver river down his back.  The sallow, shaking man he had become under Voldemort’s displeasure was sleek once more.
Draco exhaled a long breath. He tried to think how his mother navigated conversational minefields, but he would never be in her league. At least he could appeal to Potter’s sweet tooth. “Would you care for a biscuit?”
Harry sighed.  Really, he was usually more capable of intelligent conversation than this.  He looked down, noticed the flowers again, and stuck the little pot out toward Malfoy.
“Murgatroyd’s a fool,” Harry said.  “I may have hated you for years, but I ‘d never underestimate you.  You’ve always been persistent.  And creative.”
It began with a question from his landlady’s little girl, Miranda.  Draco liked her; she was a slightly awkward, bookish child, but Draco himself was socially awkward in the years after the war, and found books easier to deal with than people. Preferably books written by authors who’d never heard of Draco Malfoy or his parents.
“I need to know what I want,” Harry said, and the room let him in. Fifteen years since he’d fled the Fiendfyre in this room, Draco’s arms clamped round his waist.  Ten years since he’d last felt those arms around him; almost as long since he’d seen the man.  Their affair had been fiery. Nothing since had matched it.
Harry held back a sigh.  Hadn’t he had more than his share of responsibilities, without taking on owl training?   But how could he say that to Hagrid, whose heart was open to any animal, no matter how difficult?
“No.”  Another volunteer had described them as the basic snack food – greasy, crunchy, good with salt – but Harry couldn’t ignore the little dusting of insect legs left on the hand, no matter what a good protein source they were.  “I would’ve thought Malfoys didn’t eat insects.”
Hermione, still out of breath, confirmed this with a nod.  She gave Harry a questioning look, as he had come to join them.  Harry shrugged.
“It’s about four travelers who go to India to bring the first Buddhist scriptures back with them to China.  So it’s kind of related to meditation.”
“I was lying, you know,” said Draco, pulling him into his arms.  “You never needed any lessons in seduction.  That day I went back to my cabin to find you coming in my bed was the sexiest thing I’d ever seen.”
Just then the rain became a downpour that ripped through the Umbrella Charm and drenched them. “Come on!” Draco said and ran for the house.
Harry finished assembling his instrument, blew a few notes, and adjusted the mouthpiece while Draco admired the gleaming curves of brass and the sight of Harry backlit by afternoon sunshine.  “Er – this is for you,” Harry said, looking bashful suddenly, then put the horn to his lips and blew.
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy said quietly. “For… well, clumsy jokes are the least of it.” When Harry looked back at him, Draco added, “I might not completely dislike you either. Mind you, I’m only telling you this because I’m about to die by Manticore anyway.”
“That must be a serious problem indeed.  What does she think the magical community here can do to assist?”
“Er, no, I don’t want to intrude,” Malfoy said, glancing at Harry. “I just wanted to discuss the dosage with you, given your condition. Perhaps we can step into another room?”
“I will tell him about us.  I mean, if you want me to.  I just wanted to be sure there is an us, first.  There is, right?”
They discussed it some more. In the end, they found Luna was happy to show Merfley where the Mooncalves danced by moonlight, and the two of them watched quietly and practiced under Luna’s Muffliato and Disillusionment Spells.
“We can make it up as go along,” Harry said.  “Just try not to fall off the bed, it’s a long way down.”
Draco searched his face once more and then held out his own hand in its bright Russian-patterned mitten. “Come. Let’s walk,” he said.
While she tugged his strands into place with her beak, Draco smoothed her feathers and whispered sweet nothings and apologies and promises, as if he thought it was his fault she’d been gone so long. Rutherford let him.  Normally she didn’t like to be called Ruthie in public, but she was feeling indulgent.
He was getting ready to wipe down Rosemonde as best he could, wondering where he could get the single malt whiskey that was the only thing Abraxans drank, when Hagrid appeared and insisted on taking care of her.  She seemed happy enough with that, so Draco thanked her, stroked her nose, and promised to be back after he’d rested.
Malfoy stepped back. “No what?” He took a deep breath and looked down. “Look, Potter, I know you’ve no reason to trust me. But if you do…” He pulled his eyes back up to Harry’s. “I’ll try to deserve it. But you need to tell me what you want.”
“I know a flying horse you can ride,” said the googly-eyed lassie.  “And here, take this, it might be useful.”  She started to give him the golden spinning wheel.
Back then I thought that once my father was out of Azkaban all would be well.  Nothing is well.  There’s slaughter by snakebite at the dinner table.  And here you come stumbling in with Miss Too Smart for Her Own Good, and Weasley with his hair like a flare gone up to alert the world, and you think a puffy face is enough to hide you? At least you have the sense to be terrified, I can hear it in the way you breathe. You’ve got stubble on your chin and that chaos of hair is down to your shoulders, have you been living under hedges?  You’d be better off back there, by far.
Bear Draco looked alarmed.  “What?  You can’t be serious!  You want to live with those horrible people again?  And leave m- … And leave?”
And Petunia.  Once they were happy, playing together in the little garden their mother worked so hard at.  But somehow, Lily became the joyful child, and Petunia the complaining one.
But before he could complete his analysis for Galaxy Zoo, she jumped back onto the keyboard and the screen went dark.  She was always discovering computer settings he knew nothing about.
Harry took some plain massage oil and stroked it over Draco’s cock.  He knelt over Draco, straddling him, and kissed him again deeply.  Then he grasped Draco’s cock, poised himself above it, and began to lower himself.
kill his headmaster.  Get out of Hogwarts somehow, get to the Manor.  See his mother.  Be a celebrated Death-Eater.  Hope that he never had to face Harry again.
He woke up next morning on the grass in his ragged old clothes.  The castle had vanished.  He set off to try to find the way East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
“You’re bleeding,” Draco said. “Sit on the bed, I want to clean those scrapes on your side. Who knows what kind of venom that thing might have. Damn, my wand is gone—heat the kettle for me, would you? And cancel that curse so I can use my hands again?”
“Who’s here?” said a sharp voice, and the wind blew keenly all around them til they were stopped in place.  “Speak up, laddie!”
Charlie exhaled. “It’s hard to say – it depends on the breed, their history in the area. You can do research, but a lot is intuition. I wish I could help, but I have to get back to Romania. Do you know anyone with an affinity for wyverns?”
Draco rested his head on his crossed arms and watched in the mirror.  His robes were bunched up over his upper thighs.  His legs looked too thin – he’d lost muscle from not using them.  Baines was still instructing, although a lot of it seemed to be a matter of observation and imitation at this point.  Potter still looked serious, as if he were trying to absorb all this, as if he actually cared about learning it.  Potter’s tanned hands looked dark against the pale skin of Draco’s thighs.  It was so strange that Potter was touching him there.  So strange that anyone was touching him there, and his leg didn’t feel a thing.
“Maybe some honey,” Potter said, smiling.  “I eat my peas with honey, I’ve done it all my life.  It makes the peas taste funny, but it keeps them on the knife.”
One wild and stormy evening – it was a Thursday – the wind was blowing roughly outside, and tossing rain against the house. Harry was doing the washing up when there came three loud knocks at the front door.  His Uncle Vernon answered it.  A large white bear pushed inside and shook itself, sending drops of water flying.
Harry slowly approached the Hippogriff and bowed low. The Hippogriff hissed, screeched, and lunged towards him with its sharp beak. Harry stepped back in a hurry, confused.
For some reason Draco found himself blushing.  He looked at his shoes.  “Hadn’t you better get going to your date tonight?”
“Er, no, it was just last night,” Harry said. “I was camping wild on a walking tour. I startled it and it broke its leg running away.”
“I can’t figure out why they don’t make us confess,” Potter said.  “Dumbledore just asks ‘Do you want to tell us?’ and we say ‘no’, and he leaves it at that.  It’s not as if he couldn’t make a pretty good guess.”
“I was behaving rather badly myself at the time,” said Malfoy.  “Have you finished chastising our guest, Booboo?”
charm that shot him downstairs so fast he only saved himself by means of a quick Cushioning Charm.  “What was that, Granger, the revenge of the Mud-”
In the yard, the seedlings Draco had planted were drooping.  Harry was tempted to ignore them, until one of his students noticed them and shamed him by going to fetch buckets of water.  In a country of subsistence farmers, one could not neglect a future source of food, even though he’d be gone long before the trees bore fruit.
Draco shifted his gaze to the mirror.  Potter was still on the left and Baines on the right, and Baines was talking him through various points on the foot.  Draco couldn’t feel anything, and after watching for a while his attention wandered.  Then he heard Potter’s voice raised.
“We found it!” Luna reported happily. “But not until our last day. We were almost out of food but Millicent had cleverly packed a couple of little mince pies.”
Stunned with pleasure, Harry gradually drifted back to consciousness.  His body felt heavy, as though he had honey in his veins, sweetly sluggish. His pants and the sheets were wet and sticky.  He couldn’t move.  There was a slight sound off to the side.
“Because of the after-effects of the war, Harry Potter was taking a therapeutic walking tour, in the course of which the Mooncalf was accidentally injured. So it was a late casualty of the war.”
“You’d have sent Gryffindor house points so far below zero you’d never have recovered.  Pity you didn’t get to try it.  So – what brings you by this fine morning?”
Æthelflæd rubbed a painkiller salve into the skin inside the Mooncalf’s ears, saying it would spread through the bloodstream and work better than trying to get the frightened beast to swallow a potion. She splinted the leg and stabilized it.
Draco’s eyes were fixed in front of him.  Ahead of them, a pair of older men were walking along hand in hand.  Harry said nothing, but bumped Draco’s shoulder lightly with his own.  Draco looked over into a face full of attentive concern.  Harry’s hand brushed his.  Draco half-smiled, and then they were holding hands.
“Really?” Harry said, glancing at the others. A billiard stick would be an excellent place to conceal a wand. “Could we see them?” But it seemed that the wyvern billiard stick was long gone, and no one remembered where.
Am I?  Harry wondered, as they reached Malfoy’s cabin and settled into the chairs outside.  But he had to defend the millipedes.  “They’re quite striking, actually.  And harmless.  They get to be about 6 inches long at the beginning of the rainy season, and they’re shiny black with all these feathery orange feet, and they glide along like some sleek modern train, with their legs rippling in and out in waves.”
After that things were quiet for a while. The Mooncalf was terribly shy, but no trouble, as long as they kept the Hippogriff in another part of the grounds.
Draco clucked to the horses and flicked the reins, and they began to run. The bells on the troika and harnesses sang out a melody to the cadence of the horses’ galloping hooves. Sunlight sparkled on the snowy fields. Joy lightened his heart.
“Oh yes, it’s quite nearby, and there’s another statue of her there, but they made a mistake and put clothes on that one.  So unnecessary for a fertility ritual.  I would love to go to the crossroads there at Beltane, to see her come riding.  If only I could find a hippalectryon to carry me.”
“Very well, thanks,” Harry replied, inwardly rejoicing that apparently they didn’t have to talk about it.  Rashly, cheekily, he added “…eventually.”
And then Potter turned and left, and Draco could let out his breath and finally turn to look for his wand.  It wasn’t there.  How long had it been gone?  He’d been too weak to try to do anything since the fight – could his wand have been gone that long?  Surely he’d have known?  And why had he been left unguarded with Potter on the loose?
Draco slid into his arms, and they were wrapped in an embrace, kissing. Draco made a helpless noise in his throat and Harry couldn’t bear it, he got them through the doorway and down the steps into the cabin until they reached the nearest bed and fell on it.  They kissed and kissed and then made sweet hungry love, little cries of passion drifting out to mix with the murmur of the water and the other soft sounds of the night.
“Potter!”  His eyes took on a speculative gleam.  “Wapping you might be rather entertaining at that.”
“You missed me!  I’m touched, Potter.  I needed to look at some original manuscripts that couldn’t be removed from the library.”
Luna and her father did a swaying, circling, arm-waving dance thought (by them) to attract Crumple-Horned Snorkacks if there were any in the vicinity, which apparently there weren’t.
Draco was left to think about how little he wanted to discuss the events of that day with Dumbledore or even Snape.  How much had Potter heard – did he know what Draco was planning?  Had he told Dumbledore that Draco was about to use an Unforgivable on him?  Life imprisonment was supposed to be the sentence for use of
It took Draco a long time to work out a way to embed Hover Charms into the chair so that he could climb the stairs, and longer still to modify them so that he wasn’t jolted at each step.
Is that how it was for Severus, to look at Harry and see Lily’s eyes gazing out from the face of James?  Her dear brave exasperating James, who tormented Severus again and again in his thoughtless youth?
“If you want a tour, Potter, I imagine Merfley would be happy to satisfy your curiosity. I have work to do.”
“It’s not some cock-and-bull story, it’s true.”  Draco fished out the letter to that effect that he had brought to show the centaurs, complete with its Ministry seal.
A few days later an area had been excavated for the pond and filled with water. Harry Potter turned up just as Draco was getting ready to release Herman into his new home. Draco introduced them.
“Kamusta,” she said. “Madamo gid nga salamat!”  She looked delighted with the rings, which brought sparkling color to her pale hands, and the anklets, which he transfigured to fit. They jingled softly as she moved.
But maybe not today.  “I’m sorry – I don’t think I have the energy to fly right now.  Perhaps tomorrow.”
“Er…” Draco said.  He enjoyed his little cousin and hated to disappoint his aunt.  It was only a couple of years ago that he had mustered the nerve to meet her and tell her that he was sorry about the rift in the family.  But his meeting with Potter had been delayed so much already….
“Yeah, well, before today I didn’t exactly associate you with politeness.”  Especially not to barefoot old women with sticks on their heads.
“The war was traumatic for all involved,” Malfoy began. “But surely Pot— … Mr Potter, as the prime target of the Dark Lord’s wrath, and the chief hope of those who opposed him, would have felt the stress greatly. He may have felt a need to seek the quiet of the countryside in order to recuperate. Was your walking tour restorative, Potter?”
He was thrashing on his bed, lost in a nightmare.  Draco rolled up and caught Potter’s hand.  “Potter!  Wake up.  It’s just a dream.  You’re all right, stop screaming.”
“Bill Weasley?  If he weren’t married?” Malfoy tilted his head, considering.  “Well… maybe.  He’s intelligent, adventurous, principled – and he has a certain style, with the earring and ponytail.”
“I don’t have anything,” Harry repeated.  Perhaps zipping his wand inside his pack had not been the wisest move.
When she was almost to his house, she could sense that Potter wasn’t there.  This happened at times, of course; people went out.  She could leave the poem at his house, inside if there was a window open, or tied outside.  Or she could wait a while for him to return.
“I know what I want, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly.  “The question is what you’re willing to give me.”
Harry thought of Draco jotting notes with his Wyvern pen, leaning over his Wyvern car, describing the engraving on his Wyvern tuba. “Yeah,” he said. “I think I do.”
“All right.  Maybe I’ll go look for them after lunch.”  Draco frowned.  He hadn’t thought to bring food and wasn’t in the mood to Apparate all the way home again.  “Do you think the Hogwarts House-Elves would fix me something?”
“You didn’t hear?  Well, my father – didn’t do well going back to Azkaban, you know, he was - broken.  My mother was trying to appeal his sentence, but I knew that wouldn’t work, and I was angry with him for - turning our whole lives over to the Dark – madman. And, and then my father got sick in prison and – died, and I hadn’t….  Well, and then we didn’t do much of anything because we didn’t know what to do, and then my mother was sick and I tried to take care of her – but she – now she’s gone too.  And then I didn’t know what to do because it didn’t seem to matter.  And then they took the house.  So I left.”
“Since we broke up? A couple of years. You know, for all the big fights we used to have, it wasn’t about an argument.” Hermione paused, then continued in a quiet voice. “I thought I was pregnant – not planned. Ron was ecstatic, and I was… filled with dread. It turned out to be a false alarm. But I realised that Ron had his heart set on children, and I might never want them. I just want some time to – follow my curiosity, without so much responsibility for another life, you know?”
As Harry approached the broom-check stand for safe storage during the match, who should be in front of him in the queue but Draco Malfoy. Because of course he was.
Harry went off to find the cage.  When he returned, Hermione and Malfoy were chatting through the Floo.
“Yeah, and it’s really good!  You can hear me read!  There’s a dog named Teddie!  Teddie Neddie Eddie –“
Harry vaguely remembered getting a letter from Malfoy to that effect a couple of years ago, but he’d suspected it was some sort of scam and thrown it away.  Not wanting to admit that, he turned back to Katie’s contraption.  “Do you actually know how to fix this thing?”
Malfoy smiled, finally, and said, “Good game.”  He held out his hand and Harry clasped it.  The contact sent a little jolt through his nerves.
“Zebu.  They’re the real reason you went to Madagascar, aren’t they?  You just have a thing for the letter Z.”
This time the music was nothing Draco had ever heard, and far from the mellow smoothness of the last song.  There was a chaotic beginning, then a dark and threatening passage, countered next by a melody that sang of determination, a thrilling and desperate defiance, yet vulnerable and warm.
“There’s such a shortage of teachers in the rural schools – and of everything else.  Sometimes there’s barely enough chalk to go around, never mind textbooks.  And the students struggle because the classes are in English, which many of them don’t really understand very well.  Luckily they’re pretty well behaved, and the other teachers are friendly.  But I never really seem to know what I’m doing.”
“Fresh…? Actually, he was in salt water before,” Harry said. “That’s why it stung so when it hit my eye.”
Potter rolled his eyes and headed back toward his room – but the door had vanished.  He groaned.  “Damn room, my door’s gone.”
. His hands slid beneath the sheets, stoking the fire of a passion long dormant. A cry tore out of him as he came. He lay panting, and then dropped into a heavy sleep.
Harry looked and saw a strapping big lassie dressed in leather with bits of bronze and copper.  She had snapping dark eyes, short short dark hair, and a long long nose all neatly coiled and tied with a leather thong.
Draco was ready to slip away home after the 5th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Hogwarts when he saw Harry Potter, also standing alone in the shadows.  A strange place for the hero, but Potter shunned the limelight year after year.
“So I’ll only have the living to worry about.  Great, now I just need a boat.  A private boat that takes owls.  What do you think, Gabriel?”
“One chooses one’s areas of expertise, Potter.  Which is perhaps why I will soon have a doctorate in Medieval Literature, and you are a…”
“The Moose Jaw Meteorites!”  Draco said.  “We shouldn’t miss a chance to see the best Quidditch team in the Americas.”
It was early enough not to be too hot yet, birds were singing, and a young man in dreadlocks, one of Malawi’s rare Rastafarians, was pushing off from the lakeshore in a dugout canoe.  Harry looked out past the green leaves and tropical blooms to the silver blue of the water, the soft blue of the sky.  Nkhata Bay was picture-postcard beautiful, but few tourists made it this far off the beaten track.  Most of the other guests at the small beachfront hotel and cabins were backpackers or, like Harry, volunteers taking an in-country holiday.  And most of them weren’t up yet – there’d been a lot of drinking and loud music ‘til well past midnight. So this morning was still peaceful, and with no lessons to plan or papers to mark until the next term began, Harry could relax.
“Yeah, I work at a dragon reserve in Romania. It’s a great place, but there’s no broom shop in Romania with a selection like this one has. It’s always a treat to stop by here when I’m in town.”
That day Draco began work on a pair of coins linked by a Protean Charm.  He gave one to Harry.  “I’m not going to pester you – but if you ever need to reach me – you know how to use this.”  Draco bored a hole in his own and wore it on a string under his shirt, where he would feel it heat up if Harry ever wrote on his own copy.
Moving in together meant sorting and packing, and since Harry was organizationally challenged, Draco had come over to help.
Harry took heart.  “Just because it would be my first time with a man doesn’t mean it would be an experiment.  I’m not exactly a swinging playboy, you know.  And - I've felt a lot of different things for you over the years, but none of them have been casual.”
Then Draco said, “I’m sorry.  You shouldn’t have had to see that.  But now you know.”  He stood with an uncharacteristic slump.
Malfoy seemed all too happy to explain.  “It means ardent or fiery. A good match for someone named for a dragon, don’t you think?  Though actually he’s somewhat goofy,” he added fondly.  “But then I’m hardly draconian.”
Lily feels her son’s need of her, hears the infant’s whimper.  She draws near, sees the head of unruly black hair bent tenderly over the blanket-swaddled baby.  Her husband James, once wild Marauder, has turned awed father.
Seeing Harry’s concern, she added, “Teddy was never in danger of transforming, but it wasn’t comfortable for him. Fortunately Draco had been specialising in the Wolfsbane Potion, which was much in demand after the war. He began researching modifications that could be used for people with lesser symptoms, and came up with a potion that’s been working very well. Now he’s even experimenting with flavours to make it taste better.”
“That was Hedwig’s boy,” another owl answered. There was a moment of silence in honor of Hedwig, who died in a curse-storm ever loyal to her boy.
“Congratulations on your new position, Malfoy.”  Spinks, Draco’s co-worker in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, sneered as they passed in the corridor on the Ministry‘s fourth level.
Harry and the snake had another hissing conversation.  “No, not a ball like a dance, more like a… big tangle of yarn, I guess.  Made of snakes.  Many males for each female.”
Draco’s heart was in his throat.  He rolled out of the building and toward the pasture where Rosemonde was, and called to her.  “Rosemonde,
“Make me,” Harry said, still giddy.  Then a very unbearlike nose was bumping his, and some warm, soft, very human lips were pressed against his own, and soon Harry stopped laughing because kissing was even better.
They sat quietly for a bit, watching the stars come out and listening to the water lapping against the boat.
Harry’s aunt and uncle had used the gold to buy a much posher house.  They didn’t look happy to see him.  “A deal is a deal!”  Uncle Vernon shouted at the bear.  “You can’t return him now!  And you’re not getting any gold back!”
“Yeah, ‘cause she gives the kid a moose call!  And she takes books to the gold miners!   Books about kittens and pirates.  And cowboys.”
“Oh yes,” Pansy said. “In one of those end-of-the-year feast, let’s-take-the-house-cup-away-from-Slytherin-again speeches.”
to be in Slytherin.  He was miserable when Lily Evans was sorted Gryffindor, though, and the man did bear grudges.
The mirror stood unharmed.  In it, a younger Harry and Draco made love.  A look of wonder and bliss passed over Draco’s face as he came; then he relaxed and pulled Harry’s head to his chest.
At this point she would have been well within her rights to turn back home.  She was not responsible for international mail.  But she’d taken an interest in this delivery, and she’d never seen France….
Torn by the sadness in his voice, Harry wrapped his arms around him and began to nuzzle his neck.  From there, unthinking, he started to kiss Draco’s throat.  Suddenly Harry wondered if he was being selfish, turning comfort into sex.  “Draco?  Is this all right?”
“So he asked if I could possibly find someone else.  And there are so few people Teddy is really comfortable with….”
a relief,” said Draco.  “I was hoping I had a little more time to play with you before you went off to school.”
“Where would be the fun in that?” Malfoy said, handing his broom to the young broom-check wizard in exchange for a token.
“Malfoy,” Murgatroyd grunted.  “I wanted to see you.  We’re re-organizing and you’re no longer needed in your position.”
Several weeks later, Rutherford flew down from her perch atop a train on the Trans-Siberian Railroad as it neared Vladivostok.  Potter’s signature had become stronger, but it was across water.  Across the Sea of Japan, to be exact.
Whatever Malfoy might have said next was interrupted by a black blur that appeared from nowhere and landed half-way up his back, looking over his shoulder.  It proved to be a cat, and Malfoy swayed slightly to keep it from falling.  The cat walked across his back to balance on his other shoulder, rubbed its chin against the side of Malfoy’s face, and purred.  Now Malfoy’s robe was wrinkled and his hair was mussed.  If he’d been wearing glasses, they would be smudged, Harry thought.  He grinned.
She found a small altar on a side path, off the beaten tourist track, and described her problem to the two kitsune there.  After setting down its scroll, one replied to her.
He turned to whisper something back and found his nose brushing Harry’s cheek, his lips brushing Harry’s ear. He took a shaky breath.
“Here’s the cage,” Harry said.  “You’d better pad your arm though, he can’t help how sharp his talons are.”
But as Harry bent down and kissed him, three drops of hot candle wax fell on Draco’s night-shirt, and he woke with a cry.
Draco threw himself into learning about the Abraxans.  The huge golden-winged horses were magnificent, and he treated them with respect.  What a fool he’d been years earlier, when he sneered at the Hippogriff because he was jealous of Harry Potter and determined to look cool.
No, Harry wasn’t afraid.  He said goodbye to the South Wind and slept the night, so they could have a fresh start in the morning.
“Don’t tell me you actually bought those stinky little dried fish!” Draco exclaimed, noticing Harry’s little blue plastic bag.
“I’ll try.” Malfoy got out a little notebook and jotted something down. Teddy pulled Harry over to a shelf where there were several dragon figurines.
After hours of flying over glaciers, forest, mountains and bay they were hungry and went to the small town of Gustavus for a meal at a little café.  It seemed to mostly serve hamburgers and chips.  “Do you have wolverine stew?”  Harry asked.
Draco made a non-committal noise and reached for a book at random, thinking furiously as he riffled through the pages trying to look calm.  Potter waited.  Finally the solution floated to mind.
“You mean Draco?  The pale, pointy one?”  Draco was breathing faster.  He broke away to shrug off his robes, step out of them and peel his shirt over his head.  Harry pulled him down onto his lap on the sofa, and Draco turned to straddle Harry.
“No – want to see you -” Harry swept a pile of papers to the floor, turned Draco around and hoisted him onto the table.
Draco spent time with her, helped groom her, and spoke gently to her.  Gradually he won the trust of Rosemonde, and finally she let him yoke her to the chariot.  He told her what a strong, beautiful, intelligent horse she was, and how lucky he was to know her.  She arched her neck and pranced a little.  He urged her up, and she took to the sky, and there at last was the exhilaration of flying again, the wind in his face and the countryside spreading out beneath him, the sunlight gleaming on her golden wings.  Again and again they went flying together.  She too seemed to thrive on their partnership.
“Italy, last I heard, but that was some time ago.  He didn’t … keep in touch.  That wasn’t an English word, though, Potter.  Focus.”
They somehow managed the last quarter mile, dropped the shopping on the verandah, stumbled inside and reached for each other.
“Yes, because I was on my way to learn all kinds of magic, and it was my first trip without my parents.”
Harry realized that making conversation was up to him, and that he had no idea how to start.  They’d always been antagonists, to put it mildly, and hadn’t talked since the war ended.  But he hadn’t seen anyone from home in over a year.   Somehow the sight of Malfoy wasn’t as unwelcome as he might have expected – if he could ever have expected something as surreal as Draco Malfoy playing the apologetically polite host.  Harry made himself say something. “You still haven’t told me what you’re here for.”
“Who’s this then?”  Potter stretched out a hand to Wombat, who roused himself enough to sniff the fingers.
He looked at the two of them together – the former teenage Saviour of the Wizarding World being supported by the former teenage Death Eater.  He tipped his head back against Malfoy’s shoulder, saw his hair dark against that pale skin.   On his own face Harry saw an unfamiliar expression, unguarded, soft.
Well, Harry thought, it’s true that he was the one who got Draco’s shirt dirty.  And he had lots of experience doing laundry for the Dursleys, though candle wax was hard to get out.
“I wouldn’t count on that wand, Voldemort,” Draco said.  “It’s got a story you don’t know, a story of remorse.  You should have listened to Harry about that.”
It was good to sit with one of his oldest friends. It was hard to answer her questions, though – Harry had got used to living alone on a mountain with his nearest neighbours being monks and hermits. Long stretches of time went by when he didn’t talk with anyone, and when he did, it was in his broken Chinese. Now normal English conversation felt rushed, and by the time he had gathered his thoughts, Hermione or Padma were already filling the silence.
There was no point racing on such different types of broom, so they rode lazily for a while, Malfoy occasionally doing aerial tricks.  Finally Harry remembered his owl.  “Maybe we should see how the animals are doing.”
“Nah.  It’s not a Muggle thing.  I don’t know why not.  Maybe you could make a business of marketing it to them, Malfoy.”
Gabriel regarded him with wide, earnest eyes, the picture of innocence.   Harry squinted to read the scrawled signature, and then snorted.
Mrs Weasley was interested in the story of the Blibbering Humdinger. “The poor thing, all alone!” she exclaimed.
“The Ministry took it over, after – well, they let my mother stay there until….   It was too big for one person anyway.”
“Ha ha! The hero wants to bargain. It’s true that hero’s blood is especially tasty. Very well, I promise not to harm anyone else. And then,” it smirked, “the dragon claims the hero.”
Harry laughed and kissed him again. Draco pulled Harry down on top of himself and snogged him. “More,” he demanded. He held Harry close as they began to move against each other.
Harry was looking shy, he still turned uncertain sometimes for no reason that Draco could understand.  Draco felt a tender protectiveness.
Maybe he should just get drunk, since he was worthless anyway.  He didn’t especially like to drink, but he could learn.  Draco looked dully around his flat, wondering if he had any alcohol.
He entered the forest, striding along quickly, still fuming at Potter’s rudeness. The June sunlight was soon dimmed in the shadows of the great trees whose branches met and murmured overhead. The path forked.  Draco turned at random, since he had no idea what part of the forest the centaurs were in.
Harry felt like there was something he should be doing with his hands, but unable to determine what it was, he stuffed them in his pockets.  “Bye then,” he said.
Draco swung a leg over his broom and pushed off.  “Potter, here!”  Circling overhead, he stretched an arm down to the besieged Boy Wonder.  One of the demented birds leapt up and snapped at Draco.  “Come on!”
Did Potter mean to invite him to the theatre to watch a play?  To which show, and why in the afternoon?  Or maybe he meant a date to play Quidditch.  At least, as much Quidditch as two Seekers could play together….  Draco had a vision of Potter flying, his cheeks ruddy from the wind, his eyes sparkling and his hair wild.
After a little fussing with sheets and blankets and pillow, Hermione said goodnight and went into the bedroom that Padma had retired to earlier. Harry lay on the couch, which was comfortable but a bit soft. Then he lay on the floor, which was hard. Then he stood at the window, breathing the night air and looking out at the moon which hung low and almost full in the sky.
Granger looked to be trying to stay angry, but suddenly she collapsed into giggles too. It was all very suspicious.
Draco thought with a little ache of their midnight expeditions to the Prefects’ Bath, where he could float and swim and move with ease.  They’d laughed and wrestled and spun together in the water like otters.  Harry was always relaxed afterwards, and willing to let Draco touch and tongue him all over.
How did it start?  Perhaps when Lily held a fallen flower in her hand and found she could make the petals open and close, delighting their mother.
Harry had stood frozen, but now he began to tremble.  He couldn’t get a word out.  A dam of ice was giving way but he wasn’t sure what might come flooding forth.
“The Giant Squid?” Draco said, startled. “Did something happen to it? What’s wrong? But how could it be here? It’s enormous.”
, between the occasional “Do Death Eater Kids Really Deserve a Hogwarts Education?” articles, published a lot along the lines of “What’s Next for Our Hero Harry?”
“If only you could have waited a year, I would have been free.  My wicked aunt put a curse on me to be a white bear in the daytime and a man at night, because I wouldn’t marry the troll princess with the nose three ells long.”
In late afternoon they stopped at a large temple with a guesthouse and sat outside in a courtyard with other travelers, to rest before dinner.  A large monkey approached, moving from one guest to another, begging.  Some fed it snacks, some shook sticks at it, some did both.
“Is that so?” asked the bear, regarding Harry coolly.  “Well, you’re not what I expected, but I suppose you’ll have to do.”
The first wand Draco had ever had...  Memories flocked in.  His pleasure at being chosen by it, at channeling magic with it.  The spiteful little hexes he’d cast with it, and the careful and ingenious spell-work he’d done.  The shock of being able to disarm his Headmaster.  The sickening times he’d been forced to use it to torture. The mix of fear and fury, disbelief and relief when Potter – Harry – took it out of his hands.  The strange and crucial part it played in defeating Voldemort.
“To be ignored, abused or ordered around.  I’m familiar with the concept.  You have a lot in common with the Dursleys, Malfoy.”
Harry had meant to excuse himself and leave, but he found himself staying, just looking at the lake.  It wasn’t as if there was much else to do.  After a while they began to talk again.
Murgatroyd snorted.  “Very clever.  But I won’t have you antagonizing a herd of centaurs at a school.  The students could be endangered.”
“It’s true,” Hermione said. “Oh, Harry, you have to stay and tell me how you are and what you’ve been doing. All these years!”
“Thank you,” Harry said, climbing off the horse and giving it a farewell pat.  The East Wind picked him up and swirled him away.
Harry thought, reluctantly taking his hand from Malfoy’s so they could land safely.  Certain fantasies sprang to mind. But what Malfoy thrust towards him, though long and hard, was just a wooden racing broom.
“You can’t blame yourself for every deadly creature in the Forbidden Forest, Harry.  There’s only so much a groundskeeper can do.”
An owl swept by Harry on its way out to hunt, and then another. He looked after them. The first stars were coming out. Harry smiled, spelled owl droppings off his shoes, and headed down to the Great Hall for dinner.
Hermione frowned.  “You know, I hadn’t thought about it, but that was entirely missing from the curriculum at Hogwarts.  If I’d stayed in Muggle schools, I’d have eventually studied Chaucer, I suppose.  But I don’t remember even seeing anything of that sort in the library at Hogwarts, unless you count that dreadful play,
“No, what do you think about us?  Can we….”  Harry turned a little, looking at Draco.  “Can I…”  He stroked a lock of hair back from Draco’s face, which was so close, so close and so open in the moonlight.
Something landed on Draco’s back, silent but solid.  Fern climbed up to his shoulder and rubbed her chin against him.
Rutherford liked Harry Potter.  He gave good owl treats, and didn’t hold it against her that she so often delivered rubbishy verse to him.  She decided he deserved the longer nicer poem, so she folded and rolled it up tightly and, using her beak and one foot, tied it to her other leg.  She sailed out the window toward Harry Potter’s house.  She knew the way very well by now; in fact, she knew a number of different routes, being an owl who liked variety.
Old Timer liked to roll on his back in the grass, twisting from side to side and pawing the air in delight. Sometimes Draco sat beside him, reaching over to rub his stomach. Once, on impulse, Draco caught a paw and leaned in to sniff it. It smelled like grass stains and sun-warmed earth. Like peace. Draco smiled and lay back, closing his eyes. Old Timer snorted with pleasure. Contentment bathed them like sunshine.
The child shook her head.  The bushes rustled again, and the child moved forward – on four horse’s legs.  Draco caught his breath, looking at a very young centaur.
Malfoy’s face changed and he looked down. “I gave Wuffley the captain’s hat, because that was the article of clothing he most wanted.  I offered him more clothes, but he’d got used to the toga style from tea towels, and he said it was comfortable.”
One day when Draco was out in the garden Merfley appeared carrying a cauldron like the ones used in Hogwarts classrooms, walking carefully as if afraid of spilling something. “We is having another guest,” he said beaming. “A giant squid from Hogwarts.”
Draco could use a tonic; this fruitless pursuit of centaurs was wearing.  An infusion would be quick to brew.  He set it to steep and read about centaury flower essence as a flower remedy.  It was recommended for people who were exhausted from being so meek and unselfish.  Draco snorted.  No one had ever called him selfless or humble.
“Fighting a war gets your hands dirty.”  Potter wiped sweat off his forehead.  “This feels like cleaner dirt.  It’s peaceful, useful work.  And boring enough to most people that they leave me alone to get on with it.”
Harry was distracted by a group of happily inebriated Peace Corps Volunteers climbing onto the bar to spell letters out with their bodies.
The whole situation was surreal, but it grew even stranger when Lucius turned to Draco and repeated the same thing.
“No, Greg, wait!  Please stop and explain,” Draco said.  “You’re destroying the roof, not to mention the garden, and you know this isn’t even my house.  I’m just renting.  What is Luna going to say?”
“It means something like ‘Round, hairy, playful wombat! Don’t run off, burrow into the earth and disappear.’  It’s by Christina Rossetti, who wrote
sang a little voice inside him as he gazed at Draco.  He recognized that feeling, from old dreams of being caressed and cared for.
“Is that what you did, got a big dictionary and memorized all the words that start with cock, so you could use them on me?”
More hissing.  “No, he says he enjoys, uh, rubbing up against the other fellows.  Um, he’s a male.”  Harry looked a little pink.  “They have mating balls at home too, but nothing like this.  And he’d really, really like to go.  Meet his Canadian cousins, have another story to tell the snakes back home….  It’s a place called the Narcisse Snake Dens.”
“And this Puffskein was somehow injured in the war?” Draco gave it a dubious glance. The normally plushy custard-colored fur was frizzled and scorched on one side, and rather greasy. Draco suspected the owner of the Magical Menagerie was trying to offload damaged inventory.
“Perhaps it was the humidity.  Bring it round tomorrow and I’ll see what I can do.  You didn’t find a Blibbering Humdinger, then?”
“Perhaps you’d prefer the picture of the flying cock monster?” Malfoy continued. “Or there’s one with a tree of penises.”
Draco was kissing him now, on the mouth and neck and shoulder.  There was a high little whistling sound in Harry’s ears.  His whole body went taut, nerves singing, and then he was lifted in a burst of brilliant release, coming like fireworks.
“Oh, but I forgot, that would be beneath your dignity as Ambassador to the Centaurs or whatever it is.”
“Is that what happened that day, Draco?  Potter tried to kill you?  I think we need to talk about that.  We’ve been waiting until you were stronger, but perhaps we’ve waited too long.  I’ll get the Headmaster.  And Potter, who was supposed to return to his room after his detention,” Snape ended, grim-voiced.
The bear looked balefully at him and then sighed.  “I can’t,” he said.  “We’d better get going if we want to reach the castle before nightfall.  You can get some better-fitting shoes when we get there.  Until then I suppose you can ride again.”
“We’ll start with the shoulders, if you’ll unbutton the top of your robes,” Baines said.  “Lie on your stomach again, if you don’t mind.  Don’t crane your neck to look in the mirror, can’t you feel my hands on your shoulders?”
Draco tried to spell most of the sand off first but he could still feel it in his hair when they arrived.  “Shower first?” Harry nodded, shut the door of the suite behind them, grabbed Draco and they kissed their way into the bathroom.
“You?  Nothing, Harry, I don’t expect you to solve everything, you don’t even have local wizarding contacts, do you?”
“There’s a prince there whose wicked aunt is going to force him to marry a troll princess with a nose three ells long.”
“No, I missed….” The Beltane hope of the hawthorn May-tree?  Another power and privilege he’d assumed was his for the taking? “Illusions of youth.  Let them go.”
“No, she’s very practical. She’ll have made sure they packed everything they need for the expedition. And she’s good with animals.”
“Oh, call me Harry. I’m just here as a friend.”  Harry was flustered, wondering if she thought he was here to make arrests.  Narcissa extended a hand to greet him and on a sudden impulse he raised and kissed it, like a gentleman in an old movie.
Harry shook himself.  This was not the time and place for erotic daydreams. “Thanks for the hospitality,” he said, and picked up the birdcage.  He went to the doorway and called to Gabriel.  When the bird flew to him, Fern trotted after, and watched as Harry put Gabriel into the cage.
To find words for his want was more than Harry could do. He was getting cold and shaky again. He drew Malfoy closer; that was better. He closed his eyes, rubbing his cheek against Malfoy’s like a cat, and heard him catch his breath. Then he felt that unsteady breath warm against his skin. Harry pressed a little closer. A slow pulse of desire began to beat in him. He brushed his mouth over Draco’s.
Draco was saying something he couldn’t quite hear.  It looked like he was saying something about “indiscreet”, “drunk”, and “dear”, but that last one couldn’t have been right.
“No, I think you only defeated the evil maniac because you had the luck and gall to steal my wand when I was injured.  Don’t fish, Boy Wonder.  And don’t look like you half believe what I just said.”
“Shut it, you,” Draco said.  Harry stuck his tongue out at him, which perhaps was not very effective in the dark, but then Draco’s hand was covering his mouth and Harry ended up pushing his tongue into Draco’s palm.  Draco pulled his hand away with a gasp.
Malfoy gave him a disarmingly sunny smile from where he lay sprawled out on the sofa.  “Do come again.  We’d be delighted to see you.”
“Really?  I don’t remember any other Patils at Hogwarts except for her twin.  What kind of literature?”
Malfoy glared at him for a few seconds longer, opened his mouth as if to speak, closed it again, then shut his eyes and sighed.  “Well.  It was a year of doing regrettable things.”  He looked down, then studied Harry’s face.  “Why would you want to see the scar?”
Harry laughed a little. “But I’m here.” And as he kissed his unexpected lover, a sweet bolt of desire shot through him. “Here with you,” he said huskily, between kisses. “Here.”
The other Mooncalves, noticing, came running, making crooning noises. They stopped abruptly when they saw Harry and Draco.
They regarded each other for a long time, and then the bear turned to lick its fur, reminding Harry of a cat whose dignity has been slighted.
Outside the castle Harry pulled the little gold spinning wheel out of his pocket and threw it on the ground.  With a pop it turned full-size again.  He hit the wheel and spun it around angrily.
“You cannot defile our traditions!” said his aunt.  “This wedding will link our family to the house of the great Lord Trolldemort!”
Behind them was a sudden loud rustling as the Hippogriff shook out its wings. Luna turned. “Oh, what a splendid Hippogriff! I haven’t seen one in so long.”
It might have been a good suggestion, if Draco weren’t uneasy about thestrals and afraid of hippogriffs.  But he could hardly admit that to Potter, who seemed to make a habit of riding on beasts that would terrify any sensible person.
For some reason Potter was laughing a little, which caught Weasley’s attention, and now he joined in. “Black, with yellow eyes, right? Kind of long-haired, wasn’t it, Hermione?”
So they took off into the air again, under a concealment charm.  Potter’s arms were clasped lightly around Draco’s waist.  Nothing like the death-grip Draco had held him with when Potter carried him out of the Fiendfyre.  Just – pleasant.  Still…  Draco leaned the broom into a slow roll.
Rosemonde had pulled them high, high up, and the sound of the battle was covered by the wind rushing in their ears.  Wind and soaring and sunshine and a kiss in Harry’s arms.  That would do.
Draco had no answer. He smiled back and then found himself ducking his head. Draco kept his eyes on Herman, who seemed to be perking up. When Draco finally looked back up, Potter was gone.
Draco looked around for something to shield his head.  He found an umbrella, cast a strengthening charm on it, held it over himself and stepped out.  On the roof, looking very cheerful, stood Gregory Goyle with his wand out.
Draco stroked his lover’s hair. “Call me a cock-eyed optimist,” he said.  “I’m stuck like a dope with a thing called hope, and I can’t get it out of my heart.”
“Get out before I call someone to throw you out,” Draco said, groping for his wand but not taking his eyes off Potter.  His voice was shaking.
“Three ells?” said the lassie.  “That must be inconvenient.  Unless you could pick things up with it, like an elephant’s trunk.  Then it might be quite handy, actually.”
Laughing, Harry headed out toward Mr Weasley’s shed. He saw Arthur bending over a large, old-fashioned car with the bonnet up. It looked even older than the Ford Anglia that Ron had flown into the Whomping Willow.
Think of the Luna and she appeared, stepping lightly over the grass. “I hope you don’t mind me coming by.”
Draco stared at him. “Of course. Squid live in the sea. So do merpeople, that’s what their name means. I forgot that the Great Lake at Hogwarts was salt water.”
“Did you know that 500 years ago, the most important part of Timbuktu’s economy was their trade in books?” Padma said.  “Can you imagine a city like that?”  She and Hermione both had dreamy looks on their faces.
The melancholy sound was distressing. As Draco wondered, the wind rose and dark clouds began scudding across the sky. A drop of rain splashed against his face.
“For plucking me off that cold dark bridge, and… getting me unstuck? I needed to change my life, and I just didn’t know how to do it here. But I’m sorry for leaving so abruptly. I guess I didn’t think you’d care.”
He couldn’t give up now.  “All right, I’m not as cool as Bill Weasley and maybe I’m rubbish at flirting, but….”
Harry had vague memories of her mentioning a spell last year.  His impression was that it kept the mittens together so you didn’t lose one. “Sure,” he said, and thanked her.
“What?  No, I mean, of course you can – go wherever, I guess, just – it would be too strange to run into you here of all places and then not talk any more than this.”
Draco clamped his legs around Harry’s waist. “You stay here. That’s what wands are for.” He extricated his, and with a deft combination of Summoning and Cushioning Charms managed to get the tuba back without it smacking into them. Then he brought the billiard stick sailing over.
Potter had a date tonight?  Somehow Draco had imagined they could relax after dinner for a little.  Though, why would he think that?  Potter was squeezing in time for Draco at dinner, between the other things in his busy schedule, before he went out with his date – dancing, maybe – anyway, it didn’t matter, Andromeda needed one of them to mind Teddy and it might as well be Draco.
“Wiltshire,” Malfoy said.  “About ten miles from where the Manor used to be.”  It had been destroyed in a fire, a couple of years after the war.  No one had lived there at the time.
Draco paused.  “No.”  He raised his eyes to Harry’s.  They were full of an emotion Harry couldn’t name.
“We don’t know precisely what happened, but he has been this way since he returned from Azkaban.  Some days he has more of a conversational range than others.  We have tried various healers and remedies, but little has changed.  It is hard on my son.” She walked on.
Potter’s expression changed as he realised Draco was serious. He looked searchingly at Draco, and Draco couldn’t muster up his usual cool protective shell. He had been kissing this man,
With Malfoy, though, flying all out was as natural as breathing.  No one else on the pitch had ever mattered the way Malfoy had.  Now the old animosity was gone, but the fierce pleasure was still there, even when, on their third go, Malfoy caught the Snitch.
Potter, who always managed to have twice the adventures anyone else did, had apparently met centaurs back in first year.  Perhaps Draco would have to ask him for more information.
Draco slept, woke to be given potions and fed soup, slept again, time passing in a haze.  One time he thought he saw Crabbe and Goyle in the doorway, and another time Pansy and Blaise, but he had no energy to talk with them.  Often when he awoke he would see Snape sitting by his bedside, unspeaking.  Once, when he was lying in a light daze, he heard Snape say under his breath, “Why
“Er – I don’t know! Let’s ask Harry.” Teddy charged back inside as Andromeda went to the door to meet the visitor.
.  He had been so relieved that she was safe, after the war.  He’d thought, somehow, that their troubles would be over then – there would be grief, but they would have each other for comfort, and the ease of familiarity, and the golden sweetness of the kisses he’d remembered.
came a piercing shriek.  Draco turned to see his insane Aunt Bellatrix raise her wand in fury.  He threw himself on top of Harry and tugged on the reins.  Rosemonde swerved out of the way of the curse and Draco struggled to regain his balance.
“Oh, we’re forgetting the other present,” Harry said.  He pulled a soft yellow mitten out of the wrapping. “Wait, there’s only one?”
“But it’s just the Squi…” Harry’s words were cut off as another tentacle wrapped around his arms and waist and began dragging him out of the boat. Malfoy dove toward him and grabbed Harry around the legs. The tentacle was sharp and painful where it dug into Harry’s sides and the smell of ammonia burned his lungs. The giant creature snapped its wicked-looking beak, far too close for comfort.
When all of these other birds promised to seek so faithfully, how could she, an owl and professional messenger, fail to complete her mission?
There were a couple of days when he saw nothing in the forest beyond a Blast-ended Skrewt or two, and then a terrifying day that sent him stumbling out of the forest barely able to talk. Harry looked up in alarm from where he was sitting outside the hut chatting with Weasley.
“Actually, it’s because of you that I first met Fluffy back in first year,” Potter said.  “We ran into him when we were trying not to get caught out after curfew, after you set us up with that fake dueling challenge first year.  It was terrifying to find him, but useful information.”
“I mean, she’s still alive, I think….” Because surely she was, or Draco would have felt it?  “I just don’t know where.”
As the hometown of such an illustrious Quidditch team, Moose Jaw received a lot of wizard tourists, and Harry had no trouble finding a place to book a Portkey to San Francisco.  On arrival, they took their garter snake friend to his home grounds at the seashore at Point Reyes and said goodbye.  He thanked them for the adventure and told them they would always find a friend among the garter snakes of San Francisco if they mentioned his name, Ssschxthssthss.  Draco was sorry to see him go.  His company had revived Draco’s love of snakes, making the nightmare memories of Nagini recede.  Draco suspected Harry felt the same way.
“Then no one can say we’re off the beat,” said Draco, turning with a smile.  “It doesn’t have to be hard, Harry.” He stretched out a hand.  “Just hold me, and move.”
“Not prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter,” he had reprimanded Draco.  As if Potter hadn’t left Draco standing there like a fool with his hand stuck out.
Was there anything she could have done?  To make peace between James and Severus, to keep Severus from the dark road he’d taken?  She does not know what.
“Why? You still don’t think Hermione deserves a place in wizarding Britain?” Potter’s voice was hard.
“Let me taste your untrousered wantonness,” Harry said.  He took his lover in his mouth and sucked until Draco was incoherent.
It was sandy and astounding and glorious, kissing Harry Potter on the beach.  As if Draco had breached a high grey stone wall and tumbled into a garden riotous with life and colour.  The sweetness of Harry’s mouth on his, the singing in his veins, warm skin against his own, the little sounds that escaped them.
“Back to bed, Teddy,” Draco said.  “We can’t keep you up all night for company, or what will your grandmother think?  We can read there.”
With an awkward 3-way Side-Along Apparition, Harry brought Luna and Æthelflæd to the meadow near his campsite, where he’d left the Mooncalf. The animal was where he’d left it, still immobile.
“Yes,” Harry breathes back.  He breathes – he lives.  And in return for the news of her own son’s life, Narcissa lies to Voldemort so Lily’s son can live.
Gabriel screeched, but quieted after the cloth covering was on.  Harry placed a call to let Malfoy know he was coming.
Rutherford thought she’d like to see Harry Potter’s face when he received a good poem for a change.  She decided to wait, and do a little mousing in the meantime.  It was a bit awkward to hunt while carrying mail, but she’d had practice.
“Together,” Padma said, slipping an arm around Hermione and kissing her temple lightly. Hermione blushed slightly and nodded.
“…We may be able to wangle more mince pies out of it,” Draco finished, getting his cloak, scarf and mittens.
“I have spoken to some people at the Ministry about the issues that you and the Anggitay brought to our attention.  Not everyone is listening yet, but we will work to persuade them.”
“Look, Malfoy, I know you need to keep a job a little longer to stay out of prison.  That’s why I gave you until the end of summer.  You annoy me, but that’s not enough reason to send you to Azkaban, and your current pay is so miniscule it makes no difference to the budget.  You don’t need to make up stories.  Just stay out of my hair, all right?”
The view out the window mocked him – air, light, freedom.  He grabbed his wand and tried to spell a curtain across it.  Nothing happened.  Draco swore and the door swung open.  Through the door he saw Potter, also sitting on his bed.
“Look,” Harry whispered to Draco. Draco turned. Hovering at the edge of the field, watching them solemnly, was the Mooncalf.
“No one can help me.  I can’t do it… I can’t … It won’t work… and unless I do it soon… he says he’ll kill me….”
Then the silvery Patronus of a stag appeared in the room and Potter’s voice burst out.  “Malfoy, where the hell are you?  The place looks deserted and I’m under attack by crazed peacocks.”
It took Harry a few more tries, because Malfoy was adept at last minute changes of speed and direction and Harry was still learning the broom.  But finally Harry pushed up with explosive speed and grasped Malfoy’s broom just where he held it.  With his hand over Malfoy’s, Harry was pulled along by the powerful broom, close enough to see how Malfoy’s eyes sparkled, his face pink-cheeked from the wind they made.
“Certainly,” Draco said, trying to squelch his sense of foreboding.  “Owl me with a convenient time, and I’ll send you my current address.”
Soon he lay beneath Potter, hero-snogged, sun-kissed.  Delicious. Draco reached out lazily for the map.  What!  His name blocked out by Potter’s!  Unacceptable.  Draco rolled them over.  Now he and his name were on top.  Brilliant.
“You do! You like me!” Malfoy crowed. “Well, in that case you definitely have to stay alive, so that you can say nice things about me at my funeral.”
Potter looked around as if he expected to see the Giant Squid of Hogwarts rise up out of the pond or crawl across the lawn.
Harry nodded.  Could anyone with good vision know what a gesture of trust that was?  Everything went fuzzy as his glasses slid off, and then Draco’s face returned, close enough to be clear, against a blurry background.  Like a Muggle movie in romantic soft focus.  Harry grinned.
Potter shook his head.  “Now you sound like Hermione.  Do you really think all that book research is necessary?”
(Although Harry suffered more neglect, I felt the Dursleys did actively dislike him, so I wrote about Draco in this.  It's Draco's POV of the scene from Chamber of Secrets where he and his father are at Borgin & Burkes.  Unbeknownst to him, Harry is hiding in the cabinet after Flooing to Knockturn Alley by mistake.)
“All right,” Draco said, but his voice came out rough. He hesitated, and then Potter grabbed his hand and drew it to his cock and he had Harry Potter’s cock in his hand, hot and silky and growing stiff, and he was hungry for this, he hadn’t known how hungry for this.
“Owls eat gingernuts?” Harry asked dubiously, setting the flowers down to open the window for the owl to enter.
