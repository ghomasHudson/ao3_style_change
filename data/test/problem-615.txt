Harry thought about how much he feared losing Ron, and for a moment he felt sorry for Pansy. That was, until he remembered about the Amortentia. Merlin knew how long she could have kept giving it to Draco without anyone knowing…
Harry stayed silent again, and his eyes wandered.
"Why are you in a suit, by the way? Or do you just... Dress like that, now?"
"Do you want me to fuck you?" Harry said when he became too impatient to wait for Draco to form a coherent sentence. Draco's body curved against Harry's in response that was a lot more telling than the breathy "yeah" he said against Harry's mouth before Harry yanked his T-shirt off of him, letting it fall to the floor and leaned back to kiss him. Draco's fingers curled into the back of Harry's head and tugged at the hair, pulling him back as he breathed in a way that could only be read as asserting and teasing:
“Yeah, but that’s just because of Charlie," Ron said. “I want to have something of my own, you know? I don’t want to be just ‘Charlie Weasley’s little brother who also became a dragonologist’ or ‘The Weasley Twins’ little brother who sometimes sweeps the floors’.”
“Ruddy broom”, Draco huffed and leered behind him as the broom flew straight back into the rain. “No wonder, really. I stole it from a broom closet a couple weeks back.”
They watched as the nurse scurried into the hallway.
“Why, do you want me to?” Draco said, raising his brows and giving a smirk that caught Harry off-guard, causing a jerk in his gut and a burning on his cheeks.
“But he killed me anyway," Harry said, now standing up and leaning his palms onto the counter on which Draco was working on. “And I came back. And now I’m here, asking you, man to man, what happened to you after the war. Not to make fun of you. Not to blame you for what you did to help Voldemort. But because I care, and I know you suffered a lot.”
It's only now that Narcissa notices the kiss mark on Draco's neck that he's very obviously trying to hide with his hand. She glances at Potter, who is still waiting for Draco in the freezing cold. Her mind starts to piece it all together - the article, them holding hands, and then her memory takes her back. Draco had never stopped talking about Harry Potter, had he… But she always thought - surely it should have been unthinkable that he would...
Malfoy stared at the parchment Harry had handed him, his nose twitching as if in disgust.
"See?" Draco said. "I have to crouch if I want to kiss you. Little man."
“What was she doing at Hogwarts?” Draco said. “What was
been walking him to his dorm every day for about, two weeks, has it been?”
"Yeah. They don't know what to do."
"Well, I doubt it's for me to approve," she said. "There's a Ministry official for every brick in this castle now, it seems. Peeves tricked a handful of them too close to the Whomping Willow, and I haven't heard the end of it since. You can rest assured Madam Pomfrey is taking good care of the gentlemen, and tell that to the boy who threatened to file a complaint to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? The Whomping Willow is a tree, you'd have to be blind to think otherwise."
“I think last week," Harry said. “Not sure if Skepperus remembers it, though.”
"Or the choices he didn't have the courage to make," Remus said.
“I’m just trying to help, Draco.”
“What, like, fucking a guy?” Harry laughed.
As they walked around the classroom, looking under tables and chairs to find the snakes, Draco started talking.
“Oh, I know,” Draco said. “Harry was assigned the Toadsworth case.”
"But the way you like him, you don't like Ron, right?" Dean asked. "There's gotta be a reason you brought this guy up in the first place."
"I think we both know you do. You've proven yourself more than enough-"
“Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure.”
"Yeah," Harry laughed. "We had been hanging out for a while and we had such a good time together - but I don't think he was expecting it. Well, I
"Draco Black…" She huffed. "What an appropriate name for a black sheep like you.
“It’s okay," Hermione said again and smiled at Harry. “I promise.”
“Indeed. So she must have stayed a while, and been killed while Scamander was in my office.”
Nothing happened.
“A shame, really," Ron said. “I was hoping he’d give Hermione a reason to punch him again. Merlin, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything sexier in my life. Well, if you don’t count-”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and he glanced at Draco who had now started to shift, sure to wake up any moment now.
“What would we know of normal, Draco?” He said. “We children of the war. We do as we must, and if we find a moment of contentment somewhere, then I say we’ve been the lucky ones.”
“Not as merry of an occasion as we would have hoped,” Draco said. “But yes. Merry Christmas.”
Harry's heart sank a little as he realized Remus must have been talking about Sirius.
Harry didn't answer, which alone was answer enough. He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, though Draco could tell from the weight of his arms that he was exhausted. Harry smelled like himself. Harry Potter's Auror Adventures, and coffee. Dark magic and alleyways. An ugly world filled with vendetta that Draco had once lived in, but had had no intention of returning to. Except, perhaps, if it was to save his future from being clouded by the muddy waters of his past. A past that, admittedly, he had been too eager to leave behind and think it wouldn't come back to haunt him.
“Do you need help with those?” Harry asked.
“They didn’t sack us, did they?” Harry said. “There was an owl just as we were leaving, but I didn’t-”
“Oh… Sorry to hear that,” Neville said, wheeling around. “It’s freezing out here. Want to chat inside? That way we’ll be safe from any murderer, too, I reckon.”
“Do it as a favour. To pay me back for my troubles. I mean, you did bite me and everything." He had now gotten up and was rummaging through his trunk for the cloak.
“From year three,” Ron nodded. “She’s dead.”
“Don’t come yet,” Harry said before going down again, swallowing around Draco in a way that roused something between a yelp and a moan from him. The inside of Harry’s mouth was so hot, and the back of his throat, whenever he grazed it, so tight, that Draco thought he might lose it if he couldn’t come, and he leaned his head back, covering his eyes with his hands as he groaned.
"What did I do to deserve that?" Draco gave a joyless laugh. "I didn't do some of the things that I was supposed to. During the war, I mean."
"What is it?"
She chuckled. “You always made sure he was looking at you before you said something idiotic. You never made trouble unless he was there to see it, and I always thought… I saw how Crabbe and Goyle followed you everywhere and I couldn’t help but think how much you three were just an extension of your families. How it seemed like you had no choice.”
“By the way, what was the assignment we got? To replace the whole interview mess.”
“Wishful thinking, my friend,” Draco said. “I was just about to have a walk outside, isn’t that right?”
always jealous of Adrik. Tired of living in his big brother's shadow… I reckon that's why he really went to Great Britain, to make something of himself." The woman chuckled again. "And how did that turn out?
“Oh?” Draco said, taking a deep breath of fresh air before stepping inside the other greenhouse. The cold current still stung his lungs, but he already felt better. “She was here, then? Before she was…”
"How do you know?"
“Deal?” Harry said and held out his hand.
Draco tugged on his earlobe.
“You shouldn’t be walking out here alone with a murderer lurking about,” Longbottom said.
Ron huffed.
“I’m terribly sorry boys, but all the doctors are busy right now.”
“I should’ve realized," Harry said when Draco put the paper down. “I should’ve warned you it would be like this.”
Harry and Draco stared at each other as they listened to professor Skepperus walk down the hallway and into the staircase.
Usually Ron practically inhaled the basket's contents just to avoid dealing with the letter. Only Harry and Hermione knew that he had barely made it through the previous year and occasionally thought of dropping out. Still, at the beginning of each term he decided to do better and this one was no different. Despite already knowing that his best friend's newfound motivation would only last so long, Harry was happy that Ron was there with him as they unpacked what little belongings they had brought with them to the dormitories.
did for the Dark-”
“You guard his dorm too, don’t you?” Harry said, his eyes widening in realization. “That forest behind you - it’s the same forest as in the portrait on the seventh floor, isn’t it?”
“Doesn’t sound like him," Harry said and sipped what was left of the broth in his cup of noodles.
“He’s doing PoM?” Harry said, surprised that they'd even let someone like Theodore into the programme with his father sitting a sentence in Azkaban.
Draco."
Draco sighed.
Draco's hands balled up into fists. He dug his nails into his palms so he wouldn't say anything stupid. Grandmother was talking about taking matters into her own hands, so they probably didn't know.
"Thanks," Neville said and was about to go in as he turned back around to look at Harry. "And... thanks."
Draco smiled too, but let it melt into a deathly calm expression as he tilted his head and dragged his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip.
“Alright," Harry said. “Guess I should get back to work, too.”
“Someone has to look after the plants,” Neville said. “Professor Sprout was glad to go, and I was glad to stay.”
There, tucked within a patch of reeds, stood the small tombstone, just like before. Draco let out a breath he had been holding when he saw it looked untouched, as if not even the wind had moved the sands since their last visit six years ago. Still, the place was haunted by an eerie atmosphere, and the salty winds seemed to carry whispers with them. Perhaps that was what all graves were like. Draco hadn’t seen many in his lifetime. The only one he paid regular respects to was the one in the garden around the Burrow, the one that was always covered in fresh flowers. Whenever he stood in front of it, often with Molly and sometimes on his own, he couldn’t help but think of other people, not just the man buried there. People who hadn’t been granted the dignity of a burial, people who had met their fate on the dining table in the manor Draco had called home as a child, and been devoured there by a slithering beast, right in front of his eyes. And the others. Just watching. Whenever he came to think of those times, Draco had to pinch his eyes shut and tell himself that those people, the dead ones, were probably at peace now. But even so, he couldn’t help but wonder if the afterlife for someone like them was different than to a man like Fred Weasley, who was loved fiercely by so many people, even in his death.
Harry stared at his best friend.
“Yes," Hermione said reluctantly.
“I hope not," Harry said but decided it was best to keep to himself what he really thought was going to happen. He decided to change the subject, although what he had in mind wasn’t exactly less uneasy than Ron’s poor success in the AT programme.
bad, they just didn't feed me if I..."
"Yeah... I guess he never really moved on."
“Yeah," Harry said.
“Oh fuck”, Draco said under his breath.
"Holy shit that's cold-" Harry blurted as his body jerked in reaction. Cold or not, it felt good, way too good to have Draco's hand around his cock like that with no fabric in between, skin on skin.
“See?” Seamus said to Dean. “The man doesn’t even know about STDs, for fuck’s sake.”
"Ah, hold this," Neville said, handing Harry the pot and started to rummage through his rucksack. After reaching his arm to the very bottom of the bag, dusted with fine layers of pencil shavings, he pulled out a wrinkly piece of parchment. "I always write it down... Shit, this is last year's." Neville sighed. "Where were you when I needed you?"
“Oh," Hermione said, her brows lifting slightly. “About what?”
Outside the pitch-blackness had slowly started turning navy blue.
"Forgot about that bloody quill," Ron muttered. "What a bitch."
Harry walked back into his room only to find the mess he had left on the floor earlier. The mystery raisin lay in the middle of it, its aura judgemental. Harry ignored it, collapsed onto the bed and spent the rest of the evening procrastinating.
“Well in that case, you don’t get to use him as an excuse to stop me from discovering your kinks”, Draco decided. “So, what is it? What makes you go hard?” Draco tilted his head.
“Oh, you mean Ginny," Harry said and to his surprise, noticed the wooden desk under his palm had started to have grains again. “We broke up pretty soon after the war.”
“He didn't," Harry said, his heart racing. He was starting to feel the high die down, and it was rapidly being replaced by frustration towards Ron.
Harry’s heart was still racing from what had happened when he made it into the sixth floor of the dorms building. He found himself secretly hoping that he’d be the first to be back from classes so he could lock himself in his room and maybe release some pressure.
“You know, it’s funny,” Harry said while he slid out of his coat, “I always thought you didn’t like me in my work clothes, but judging by your reaction to all this…”
"What, you mean sneaking out to give each other handjobs in broom closets?" Harry said, grinning. He was more amused by Ron's reaction than the situation itself. In fact, he had suspected Dean was gay during their last couple years at Hogwarts but he had never paid much attention to the matter with the whole, saving the wizarding world business going on.
“Well -
“Careful now," Draco said calmly. “Everyone’s watching, and I can do much better than just holding hands. So go. And send mum my regards, will you?”
Draco and Harry lingered around the doorway of McGonagall’s office. It seemed neither of them was quite willing to take the initiative of stepping inside.
“Taking care of the Catalonian Fireball chick they found on Hagrid from what I hear,” George said.
“But why?” Draco asked. “I mean- I know I could be worse-looking, but I’m still… me. And you’re you. You’re Harry Potter.”
“I’m fine. Let’s go.”
"We were actually on a date," Harry said, finally managing a few words. They tip-toed out hesitantly, as if checking whether the atmosphere was safe to say such a thing. To his relief, the smile that rose to the corner of Remus' mouth didn't appear amused, not in the wrong way.
"And the water looks… You know it's cold and you don't know how deep it is, but it's
And so Narcissa tells Lucius to go through with the plan and contact the Parkinson girl. Just to get it over with. Just to bring an end to this madness, this postponed and all the more stubborn teenage rebellion of her son, to bring him home. Narcissa expects a couple months at the house will bring him to his senses. Narcissa's mother-in-law, for once in her life, agrees with her and complains that is it cruel to let her die of old age without seeing her only grandson for the last time. That's what Lucius translates her words into, anyway. There's a coldness in the old woman's eyes whenever she looks at Narcissa, and sometimes she suspects she's ridiculing her when Lucius insists she's complaining about the weather. The worst thing is, Narcissa can't disagree with her. She has done something wrong in raising her son, otherwise the situation would be different. Has she spoiled him too much with gentle words when discipline was needed? Probably. But Lucius was always stern with him, sometimes even giving him a slap across the face if he was being disrespectful, and Narcissa couldn't bring herself to do the same. After all, Draco was only a boy. Well, man now, wasn't he? He would never seem that way to Narcissa, though. One day he would have wrinkles around his eyes and sunken-in cheekbones like his father and Narcissa would only see the face of a curious young boy who wanted to climb every tree and jump in every puddle. But all that was so long ago.
“Because then I would’ve looked like a massive git, that’s why," Draco huffed. “Why did you give me an eight, anyway?”
"Thank you!" Neville said, his posture visibly correcting itself. "Okay, I'm starting over. Twelve stitches, was it?"
“Should we try
Draco put on the joggers and hoodie he had left folded on his chair the previous night.
I was in that bathroom, crying like a little bitch when you found me? That’s right - because I had tried to kill Dumbledore and failed, and cursed Katie Bell in the process.”
"He's dead then?"
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right…”
"Oh, they did," Harry said. "They just didn't tell me. I suppose, had I known I was a wizard, it would have been difficult to get me to do all the chores."
Harry huffed. “They didn’t even spell his name right.”
“What are you-”
Little did Harry know that professor Skepperus, perhaps due to his limited eyesight, was especially fond of peer reviews.
“I don’t want you to be used to this. I'm sorry.”
“Oh shut up," Draco said, a smile softening his words. “You know what I mean.”
"I send socks and hats to them every Christmas."
“Because I think you are," Harry said and realized he really did. “You just weren’t given a choice. Just like I wasn’t. I never had the choice to think about myself - I could have, but then people would’ve died, and it’s not really a choice if the options are your own death and letting people suffer, is it? Both are equally torturous. You just picked one. I picked the other. And we both made the right choice.”
kiss back… He was a bit taller than Harry was, and now that Harry really put some thought into it, he realized he probably would get pinned against a wall or something.
"But, I was wondering if you two have considered that this kind of publicity will only make Draco's situation worse."
“I’ll see what I can do," she said with a quizzical smile.
“It wasn’t real, Harry. He’s not coming back.”
Draco wandered in between the greenhouses. The glass walls were lifeless, and the gray weather had brought about an eerie atmosphere to the place. It didn’t bother Draco - that is, until he saw movement inside one of the greenhouses. His fingers curled around the wand in the pocket of his coat, although it was most likely just Professor Sprout tending to some plants. Draco stared at the figure, and before long he realized the person inside was far too tall to be Sprout, and had broad shoulders. A man, if Draco’s eyes didn’t betray him. Could it be Neville? Draco knew he had begun teaching alongside Sprout some years ago, but it still seemed strange that he would stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. The figure moved and Draco crouched, but too late - the person inside turned around and saw him. But Draco saw him too, and realized there was nothing to be afraid of.
“Scared," he said in an eerily absent tone. “I’m not scared, I… I think I’m in love with Pansy.” Draco’s eyes shot up to look at Harry, and now they were filled with an unnatural glow. “I’m in love with her, Harry!”
Harry smiled, secretly pleased from having managed to impress Draco.
The "bold of you to assume I was held"-line is a nod to a great drarry post I saw on Tumblr once. If any of you happen to know it, please link it to me! My url is welcometothefrogparade.
"I'm not going near that thing," Draco huffed and decided to take his chance while the bee was still at the other end of the room. "Move over."
," Draco said, and the room lit up in a faint, blue glow. “With our luck he grabbed the notebook.”
“Did you feed it?” He asked Harry, who was perplexed by Harold’s behaviour.
“Oh, I think you heard me just fine," Theodore said, standing up. He was as tall as Ron, although he didn’t look very intimidating. Harry’s arms were easily twice the diameter of his.
him," he said and then yawned while rubbing his other eye, his glasses politely making way. “I hope you didn’t actually want to know about poisoned candles.”
Then began the ritual that had taken place after every Magical Injury class for the past two weeks. Harry and Draco would walk out of the classroom after everyone had already left, talking about something and then kind of awkwardly linger in the hallway, unaware of where the other one was planning to go and if it was in the same direction of the other’s destination, or perhaps if they would go somewhere together.
Harry quickly shook his head.
Harry let out a nervous laugh.
“Oh, I think you know exactly what I mean. You don’t really want to be an Auror, you’re just too stubborn to admit it.”
"Well, lucky for you, you decided to snog the only bastard in this place with a thestral for a Patronus. Must say something about my booming mental health, don't you think?"
Draco was peeking into his thermos mug, visibly disappointed to find it was empty.
“Yes I did," Draco gnarled. “Or in case you forgot, I was about to use
"This one," Draco said, gathering the chain in his palm, "father never sold, no matter what people offered him for it."
“Are you two dating?”
Harry didn’t say anything. He wanted Draco to keep talking, because Harry was seeing bits of emotion on his face that he had never seen before. The way he chewed on the inside of his lip when he wasn’t talking, the way the aggression had vanished from his voice. He was being vulnerable.
“Oi, this is a sex positive dormitory”, Seamus stated. “Sit down. I’m sure Hermione wouldn’t mind you knowing a lube spell or two.”
Harry watched, speechless, as Draco placed the amulet in front of the tombstone and piled sand on top.
"The younger Malfoy, you mean?"
“I always see it in the papers,” Neville said while he gently inspected the leaves of the plant. “Case after case after case… It doesn’t surprise me anymore. Harry has always been someone who has to sacrifice a lot to feel worthy, but I had hoped…”
For a moment it was quiet as Harry sipped his tea.
“It’s this," Draco said, fascinated as he pointed at Harry’s arm.
“Don’t tell me you’re having Malfoy do interrogations with you now?” Theodore scoffed. “I don’t want to imagine your methods, if that’s the case.”
Larry’s eyes twinkled in excitement.
“Would be a shame if someone stole it.”
“I could name a few… No, but you really said this morning that you don’t hang out with her anymore.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry, yeah I should have totally seen that coming! I should’ve thought, ‘you know what, Harry might just be fucking Draco Malfoy in there so I better knock’.”
"It could be worse," Harry noted. "You could be stuck hiding from a bee with someone way less handsome."
“Uh, Draco-”
Harry realized people were staring at them. He let go of Draco’s hand, unaware that he had still been holding onto it.
“Would you just shut up for two seconds and listen?” Granger exclaimed. Draco suddenly remembered a certain slap in the face he had received a few years ago. He shut up.
“Can you think of any reason why she would’ve given you Amortentia?”
“Oh shit - we’re late, aren’t we?”
"By the way - you don't remember saying to me yesterday... About your favourite smell..."
“Shut u-”
Harry grinned back at him and again, Draco's abdomen pooled with a restless heat. He ignored it, because even he wasn't horny enough to start something while a flying murder bug was darting about. They returned to look at it.
“Hermione," Harry let out in an anguished sigh.
"Young master Draco has become so tall," the elf said, and now Draco recognized her too.
What happens when Lucius is in London shakes both of them to their core. It's much worse than they ever thought. Not only is Draco associating with the wrong sort, but with the Potter boy. And the article says Draco is apologetic towards him about the past and when Narcissa reads that, she feels despair pool in her insides - she wants to hold Draco and tell him he has done nothing wrong, and whoever has convinced him - and now her despair turns to tingling anger, because of course that's what happened. Too much time alone surrounded by the wrong people. Of course Draco had tried to fit in among them, and of course they had treated him like a war criminal, made him feel even more alone. And so he had turned to the only person who could redeem him. Narcissa is now convinced this is what has happened.
"Are you alright?" Neville asked. He was holding one of his ceramic pots, its little feet dangling in the air. Judging by the state of Neville's hands he had once again been digging for soil in the courtyard.
Lucius’ fist clutched the end of his cane a little tighter, and his calm expression started to unravel.
“Don’t be a fool," Lucius snarled. “Of course it’s my business, everyone knows whose son you are. What
“My - my leather jacket?” Harry stuttered. He was slowly turning red in the face as he wasn’t used to Draco being so close to him. “You like the smell of leather jackets?”
"Bisexuals," Dean repeated, staring at Harry. "Like, people who swing both ways."
“How can one tell them apart from regular candles?” Draco made up as he spoke. He could see from the corner of his eye that Potter was looking at him.
“How - how are you?” Granger asked in an unnatural tone that revealed she was aware of how ridiculous the circumstances were. Draco didn’t even have time to come up with an answer before Granger spoke again. “I’m sorry, I know this is kind of strange but - I wanted to talk to you about Harry.”
Harry turned around and saw Malfoy standing in the doorway of the last room, the light behind him casting a long shadow into the hallway. He wasn’t wearing his uniform. Instead he had on a black hoodie, its sleeves rolled up to the elbows, and black jeans - a strikingly Muggle-like outfit for someone of his upbringing. And as much as Harry didn’t want to admit it to himself, Draco looked strangely attractive that way.
“You’d better start explaining what the fuck is going on," he said, sounding only half as intimidating as he would’ve liked. “Why am I in your room?”
“Ha- Hector”, Harry stuttered through the sensation of his heart melting.
"Don't mention Ron dropping out," Harry whispered just as they heard footsteps approaching. Draco took mental note, although the list of things not to talk about was growing far too long to remember. What was left, the weather?
Draco rolled over, a jaded frown shadowing his face, and reached for his watch. He stared at it, trying to get his eyes to focus on the symbols. Almost noon? He blinked and looked again. Half past eleven... So he had slept through his morning lectures? A very strange occurrence considering how long he had been suffering from insomnia - he didn't even remember the last time he had slept through a full night.
"Alright, wait a damn minute, will you?"
“Oh so he's
"Bold of you to assume I was held," Harry said.
Draco wakes up to find himself in a compromising position.
“Oh… He must have overheard Neville and I talking about it.”
McGonagall tilted her head, staring at the air in front of her, probably reviewing an event in her memory.
“Oh?”
Draco looked at him and swallowed. For a moment he wanted to just, run to him and squeeze him as hard as he could. He could see Harry’s terror looming above him in the air, almost hear the merciless waves of his inner turmoil crashing down on him every time he tried to step ashore.
“Be my friend," Harry said.
"Ah, Hermione, I was hoping to run into you," Percy said, handing the young woman a pile of papers. "I thought I'd lend you my notes on magical law. You know I got full marks on that test, right? Well, I should be on my way - but if you have any questions, about anything," he said, "don't hesitate to send an owl to the Ministry. I'm sure I'll be able to squeeze a few minutes of tutoring into my schedule."
“And since when do you know so much about him? Larry says you’ve been sneaking out with Malfoy for weeks.”
on you.”
"Yes," Dean said. "He uses it to annoy me."
Draco gave a shrug.
"Relax your wrists," Hermione said in a calming tone to Neville, who looked like he was using every ounce of concentration he could muster to succeed at whatever it was he was trying to do.
"Besides," Draco said as he turned away from the grave, "I'm petty by nature."
Harry smiled. Since Theodore Nott knew about the article, there was obviously a copy of the paper in Draco’s dorm already. But Harry didn’t mind. Truth be told, he missed Draco. It was actually a little embarrassing - they had spent the whole Saturday together, and even so Harry had this ache in his chest. He kept seeing things he thought Draco would like and saying things he hoped Draco would have been there to hear, and having thoughts he wanted to tell Draco about but probably wouldn’t remember later. And he kept thinking about… things. Doing things, with Draco. Things he hadn’t done before, at least not with a guy. Things he hadn’t found himself wanting so bad before.
“Why didn’t you ask McGonagall?”
“Well neither do you to most people”, Dean noted.
Harry pressed his lips together.
“You were?” Harry said. He wasn’t exactly sure what the alternative would’ve been - the only way to get past the door was to talk to Larry.
"To Darthorn. You never came back to Hogwarts like the rest of us. You didn't graduate."
Harry frowned. He hadn't really thought about making out with Draco, but now he did, and now that he
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I know," Neville said. "Why?"
"We just need to get one thing straight," Ron then said and glanced around the room before stepping a little closer. Draco was fairly certain he was about to get clocked when Ron continued:
“Well would you look at that suit,” Gwen said. “Now I feel underdressed.”
“Sure," Hermione said. She gave Harry a quick hug and left.
Harry closed the file and placed it back under his arm. Draco found it unsettling that he hadn’t even taken off his coat.
Later that night Harry was overseeing the dishes as they washed themselves. Darthorn, much to the horror of some parents, didn't have house elves. Instead each dorm had to divide chores within its inhabitants, and that included cooking and cleaning. In addition to that, the 200 students were also in charge of keeping the classrooms and hallways clean. The task rotated between dorms weekly so that on average, each dorm would have to clean the school about once a year. Even with five people who all used magic, the job was still pretty daunting. Neville had accidentally created a flood in the owlery the previous year, causing little rodent skeletons, feathers and owl droppings to pour into the courtyard. Harry already dreaded their next turn.
“Well, what can you do? That’s old news now," Harry said, shrugging in a sarcastic defeat.
“So, it’s true then? That the card-”
“Shut up or I’ll fail the class and drag you down with me.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“-which is precisely why you must go,” Arthur said. “It will be suspicious if you refuse now, it will seem like you know something you're not supposed to.”
Gray eyes. Cocky expression.
“What- no! Who told you we were-”
“How did you become aware of her death?” Harry asked.
Harry twisted the jar open (it opened with the most satisfying pop) and handed it back to Malfoy. Malfoy didn’t thank him, and Harry didn’t say “you’re welcome”.
“Good one," Harry laughed. “But yeah, just found out yesterday that Ron and I are having a Practical Examination in a few days with the AT group. So, yeah, I was cramming.”
“I’m not sure if I should tell you," Granger said, her shoulders dropping. “But I haven’t seen Harry like this in a long time, so I-”
Harry Potter? The Chosen One? The-”
“It’s true then," Theodore said with his nasal, stretching voice. “Saint Potter has come down to greet the lower classes.” He was sitting in an armchair, looking like he was up to absolutely nothing. Harry saw a copy of Daily Prophet lying on the floor next to his feet and realized why Draco had asked him to bring a copy. Judging by Theodore’s tone of voice and the way he was looking at Harry with a stupid, very uncle Vernon-esque smile on his face, he hated Harry more than Draco ever had.
“Not anymore you’re not,” Draco said dryly, glancing at all the people present.
“Hm.”
Harry grabbed the newspaper and read the full article on his own death. It listed many of his achievements, including defeating the Dark Lord in 1998 and becoming the youngest to be promoted to be Head of the Auror Department in 2007, a year that hadn’t even taken place yet. The article also featured a short interview by one of Harry’s colleagues - no one the real Harry recognized - who described Harry as a tense but determined man to whom fighting Dark wizards had been more than just a career choice; it had been his sole purpose in life. The colleague then went on to say that dying on duty while tracking down a group of illegal magical object traders was probably the way he would have wanted to go. Harry frowned as he read that he hadn’t even been killed by one of the traders, but in a car accident on his way back from work. While it may have technically counted as still being “on duty”, Harry still felt that calling it that just made the already underwhelming story seem even worse. However, there was nothing strikingly unrealistic about it, and Harry started to wonder if, instead of the past or a nightmare, the mirror had sent him into the future.
, to feel less powerless against it. It. The way Harry was. And how much Draco wanted to just take him. And for Harry to take him. And he had, but Draco wanted him to do it again. At the earliest convenience if not sooner - he wanted to have Harry, to claim him and be claimed and to stop thinking about what was the appropriate thing to do and whether this or that would seem weird and show himself, all his lust that had never really had a place to go. But there didn't seem to be good words to describe any of that, and so Draco had remained silent about it. He supposed that was why Harry still thought he was upset about his mother. Which he was, just… He had been upset about her for a year already, and how long can someone really fret over their parents before they start to think about other things? Like dick.
“Merlin,” he said as he closed the door after himself, “what happened?”
is a strong word - but… yeah. It seems like he does.”
“It’s my supervisor telling me to stay away from the Malfoy case,” Harry said. They stood in front of the fireplace and he took a handful of Floo powder. “Arthur has a portkey prepared for us. Ready?”
Seamus Finnigan didn't study at Darthorn - he had recently gone to work with the Weasley twins on product development for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Something to do with fireworks, if Harry remembered correctly. Either way, it made sense that he would have come to visit - after all, Paddington wasn't too far away from Diagon Alley and several of his friends, including Dean Thomas, Neville, Ron and Harry all lived in the same dormitory.
They wandered around the main building. Harry knew what he needed to talk about next but wasn't at all sure how to bring it up. In fact, he had been avoiding even thinking about the matter since that one day, and now all that repressed doubt started to trickle out of him.
Grandmother Yana's barely existent eyebrows rose.
It was a crisp and sunny Autumn day, probably one of the few left before the brilliantly orange and red trees would start to sprinkle their leaves onto the grass with a much more generous hand, leaving behind the stripped, gray landscape of winter in London.
“Making me listen to you wailing about your problems is exactly what you’re supposed to do," Harry said. “Only," he said, raising his index finger, “you have to return the favour. Even if I come throwing pebbles on your window in the middle of the night, because frankly I don’t know how to fold one of those damned cranes. You have to listen to me rant about the same things over and over again. You have to let me screw up and realize it afterwards and comfort me even though you told me so. When I’m being a dick you have to call me out on it, and if I don’t listen you have to make me listen. When someone dies, you have to sit with me through the funeral without me saying a single word and choke-slam anyone who tries to talk to me two feet deep into the ground. And when I’m happy, you have to let me be happy even if you secretly don’t agree with everything I do. And when you’re panicking and spiralling and thinking
Harry sat up straight and lifted his arm, and Draco leaned onto his shoulder, letting Harry run his fingers through his hair as they sat in silence.
taller, that was a given, but surely not by a foot…
gay, or bisexual or anything-”
“I’m pretty sure that would make you a cool grandfather," Harry noted.
“You’re obviously not”, Draco said. “Come on. I’ll walk to you to your dorm.”
"I missed you,
Draco turned to look at him.
“See, that’s my problem," Harry said as they gathered their things, “I have no idea.”
“No," Harry said. “No, I don’t think I will. Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just go and be gay somewhere else.”
Professor Toadsworth, however, didn’t seem to mind the cold. No wonder, really, as she was dressed in heavy wool and furs from head to toe.
Remus crossed his arms against his chest. It was clear he was going to wait for Harry to continue talking. Harry shrugged.
Draco looks away.
"Hi," he said and pressed his lips together as a teary whimper tried to escape him.
They crossed Chilworth Street in silence.
“To Hogsmeade. Are you… Ready to go back?”
Harry was experiencing a type of perfect stillness he had never felt before.
Remus placed his hands in his pockets.
"I swear they keep moving the dorms up a level without telling us," Neville said, panting and holding onto the handrail for support.
Harry wasn't sure when he had started to softly grind against Draco but he had, and Draco's fingers were digging into his back, encouraging him, and Harry was so dazed in arousal that he was surprised he didn't come right there and then when Draco's hand reached down for him, fingers curling around the shape of his cock, stroking at it through the fabric. This time Harry wasn't so successful in holding back his moan. Harry felt Draco smile against his lips, swirling his tongue around Harry's, and Harry's chest fluttered when he realized Draco liked hearing him.
“Forget I said that," Harry said as he realized there was no way Draco could have known about Paddington Bear.
"Yep," Harry agreed.
Harry took of his glasses to clean the lenses a little. It didn't so much good - little water droplets clouded them as soon as Harry put them back on.
Harry felt the pleasure spill over - he came, incoherently begging for Draco's name, his orgasm rippling fire and absolute bliss into his every cell and his vision momentarily fading to white from the exploding release.
“What do you mean?”
Ron smiled and felt the top of his head. He had recently gotten a buzz cut (mainly because most of his hair had burned off when he had been helping Seamus, Fred and George with testing out the new fireworks), and still wasn’t quite used to it.
"So they- those bastards treated you like a house elf, is that it?"
,” Harry said, pointing his wand at Draco’s palm. Just like the abundant amounts of spilled and smudged ink in their school years, be it on clothes, on furniture, on parchment, the words faded and disappeared.
“No, I am, I just…”
“What’s that?” Harry asked.
The man sighed and gave an apologetic smile.
“What the hell do you know about what is like me and what is not," Draco snarled and threw the handful of dried snakelets he had been holding, across the room. “Don’t you dare think you know me just because I didn’t want you-know-who to kill you!”
“Harry! I was hoping I’d run into you today.”
"About what?"
“Oh?” Hermione said. “Did you crush the bicorn properly?”
“Harry kissed you? When?”
“Yeah," Draco said. “I was still asleep when Ron came to get me, so I didn’t get a chance to eat.”
Dean and Seamus were looking at him with more anticipation than Harry had ever been subjected to in his life.
"I missed you too," Narcissa says. "And I will miss you."
“Uh, sometimes?”
“Not anything out of the ordinary," Hermione said wearily. “Honestly, I don’t know how anything gets done in this country with the way decisions are made. It’s like watching Ents talk.”
“Potter, we should go-”
“And how exactly, if I may ask, will you-”
"Yeah."
"Would you rather it be them?" Draco said, nodding at the Weasleys behind them. Harry looked at Draco. Then he turned to look at the family and said:
it, whereas a top…”
Harry stared at the image for a while, expecting something to happen. He then, very quickly, touched the surface. He flinched as he realized his fingers were sinking into the reflection - he was expected to walk into it. Harry glanced at the thin strip of pink light coming in from the tent’s flap. The sun must have been rising outside. Draco was probably still in bed…
Harry turned around and saw Draco standing behind him, tucking his wand back into his pocket.
This didn't seem like a good time to be thinking of those kinds of things, though. Harry was already half-expecting Draco to call the whole thing off once he'd see the article. Many others like it, and much worse, would follow. It was inevitable.
Neville took a pair of clippers from the pocket of his apron and trimmed off a few leaves.
Draco looked away almost bashfully.
"Do you know what you're getting yourself into?"
"Yes. And no."
Harry gave a confused frown.
Harry and Draco have got some explaining to do. Harry confronts some uncomfortable thoughts concerning his future, and Draco shows unexpected interest in the fate of a certain house elf.
“You’re kidding, right?” Harry sneered. “I don’t know how well Ron hides his prejudice when he’s with you, but I was there when he found out about Dean and Seamus and let me tell you, it wasn’t exactly what you’d call ‘being okay with it’.”
“About Amortentia?” Harry said, letting out an amazed laugh. “Hermione, that’s great! When is it coming out?”
“Draco-”
"You know when you're at a lake," Draco said, "and, you're standing on the dock looking down?"
Harry turned to look at Malfoy and could see in his face that he had probably been looking at him for a while now.
“Blimey, Draco," Harry said, his brows raising in a pretend astonishment. “Am I really? The
“Miss, do you happen to know a nurse we could interview?” Harry continued.
Harry figured he just wasn’t properly awake yet and tried the door. It was locked. Harry frowned. In the dark he could recognize some of his old things, like the tin horse he had found on the playground once and managed to smuggle back without the Dursleys noticing, but when he reached for it, his fingers grasped at nothing. Harry had a feeling he was in the wrong place altogether. How was he
“What’s with the face, Potter?”
“Thing is, you’re right," he said. “I’ve known for a while this really isn’t what I want to do, but... I also don’t want to drop out. At least, not before I figure out what I’m going to do next. I don’t want to tell people, ‘I dropped out, I couldn’t do it’. I want to tell them, ‘look, I started this great new thing’.”
And that was enough.
“For what it’s worth, I think you should go, too,” Hermione said. She probably didn’t realize it, but she was holding a hand to her stomach. “There can’t have been many people left at Hogwarts yesterday. Rolf might even be a suspect, and with the wedding and all, I just think…”
Neville was quiet for a while. Apparently something very distracting was going on where his feet were.
Harry came to from his thoughts when he heard distant laughter. The boys' dormitories were small, shared flats, each equipped with a small kitchen and living area, and a room for each student, snug but big enough to almost comfortably fit a single bed and a writing desk. Although the walls of the bedrooms were almost as thin as the curtains of the beds in Hogwarts, Harry was grateful for the added privacy.
Harry looked up and saw Larry the Giraffe in his human form staring at him from his painting.
“Oh fuck off," Harry said, letting out a joyless laughter. “You know what, at least I’m not in denial. Unlike you, I don't need everyone to like me so fucking much all of the fucking time.”
“Bold of you to assume I care about your opinion enough to spend my time with people you don’t like, just hoping you’ll see me.”
The following morning, Draco was sitting on one of the stone benches that lined many of the hallways in Hogwarts. He was writing in his broken, enchanted book while toying with the triangular shape of the amulet beneath his shirt. At first he had decided to use the empty pages to sketch on, but then a few images of hallways and Nearly Headless Nick, who was very fond of the idea of modelling for a picture, Draco grew tired of drawing and started to write. At first it was just a few scribbles to test his cursive, and then he found himself writing about all sorts of things that he had thought about over the years. The castle around him seemed to fade, and he only became aware of it again when he heard Theodore Nott speaking. Draco didn’t know how much time had passed, and he would have preferred it that way instead of whatever argument Theo was undoubtedly looking to get into.
and yet they never taught us that one at Hogwarts. Or, they weren't supposed to, at least.”
Harry sighed and backed away from the control panel. Nothing was working. He sat down on the cabin floor and looked calmly at Draco.
“No, he… He’s probably the least likely of them all to tell anyone. Ron would’ve told Hermione and Dean would’ve told Seamus but Neville… I don’t think he’s going to.”
At that point Harry was already so tired of just standing there that he put his shoes back on and decided to talk to Malfoy some other time. He was already halfway down the hallway when he heard the last door open behind him.
“Ordering your little assistant around like that,” Draco continued, keeping his voice low and dragging. “Come now. That won’t do, will it? Gwen’s a good girl. I know one when I see one. And it’s not her fault I’m good-looking.”
He was already half-asleep when someone knocked on his door.
“Oh, that one - it’s from a new Terry Pratchett book. He’s a Muggle author who writes about magic. Well, not real magic but, you know. The way he imagines it.” Draco got up to point at another page. “That one’s his too.”
"What?" Harry said breathlessly, his eyes barely attempting to focus anymore.
“No.”
Draco looked contemplative for a moment.
Draco started to get a little confused. Did Granger know or not?
"Father kept all kinds of magical artifacts around the house," Draco said. "He collected and sold them for a living, and when he kicked me out I stole most of what he had left. That's how I've been paying for the tuition."
“I am aware of this, Mr. Malfoy," the professor said. She put emphasis on all the incorrect parts of words when she talked, which made it difficult for Draco to read her tone of voice. “Has it not occurred to you that it is in my interest not only to guide future Aurors, but also to steer the fragile ones away from this path?”
any choice? You're giving me an ultimatum- do as we tell you or you're not our son anymore."
Draco snorted into a laugh.
"Yeah," Ron said, swallowing down hard. "Thanks."
Harry was getting sleepier by the minute as he changed out of his uniform and crawled under the blankets. His pillow still smelled like Malfoy. Harry rolled over and tried very much to dislike the scent.
Draco glanced down. There was no way the professor could have seen what he had in his pockets.
“Did someone say something to you?” Draco asked tensely. “About St Mungo’s or…”
Ksenia returned with the owls, and grandmother Yana nodded towards Draco.
“Oh, hell no”, Ron huffed as Harry sat down opposite of him. “Just dad. He promised not to tell mum before I come up with a plan for what I’ll do next. Hell, she'll go ballistic.”
“So you do agree?” Granger said, her eyes lighting up a little. She started looking through her folders and handed Draco a slip of paper. “Then tell me, what do you think?”
"Then we'll apparate to Hogsmeade. What difference does it make at this point?"
"Mmh, you coming for me Draco? Fuck, you're so- oh fuck... do it, do it, come for me Draco, fuck..."
“Nothing," Draco said. “I was supposed to turn into my lab partner but I just, itched everywhere for a few hours and got an awful rash on my arms.”
The students were mesmerized by the performance, clapping and cheering as the mockup dragon spit pretend fire at them.
“Yes, sir,” Gwen said. “Catch you later, Draco.”
"What do you mean?"
"It's kind of like a mixtape but with books." Draco shrugged, looking a little bashful. "It's kind of lame, but I made it for you, so…"
Draco didn’t answer. Granger kept talking.
He handed the notebook over to Malfoy who took it and stared at the page for a while.
“No one," Hermione said calmly. “But Ron says you’ve been acting weird lately, and I’ve seen you and Draco walking together a couple times, so I thought-”
“Why don’t you give me my wand and we’ll talk.” It was as if Potter had just now noticed that Draco was holding it.
"The symbol is much older than Tales of Beedle the Bard. See, somehow the ancient Egyptians managed to enchant this amulet so that while you wear it, you can't die."
“What?” Harry turned to look at Malfoy who was now looking at him, dead serious. Apparently it hadn’t been a joke.
Harry looked at Draco and then turned his gaze to the window. It was so dark outside he could only see his reflection from it.
Draco leaned his face onto his palm. Harry found out not longer than a few seconds later that as he had said that, Draco had met eyes with Seamus Finnigan who had been in the middle of sneaking out of the dormitory.
slept for so long in one go. The door shook in its hinges as someone pounded on it again.
"I've got the explosive part covered," Seamus explained, leaning forward on the couch, his left hand nonchalantly resting on Dean's thigh, "but Fred said the visuals could use some work. So, since I happen to know an artist," and now Seamus' hand patted where it had previously rested, "I thought I'd give the course a try."
“Care to tell me why? Because in case you forgot, he’s a massive dirtbag and also, um what was that thing again where they all hunt you for sport, with the masks and matching tattoos and everything - oh, a
“Uh”, Harry started again. “Why would- it’s not like, he’d get pregnant…”
"Nice place," Draco said, gesturing vaguely at everything in the room. "Really, it's..."
"So the Dursleys didn't know either?"
“He’s - he’s a lot nicer for starters," Harry said, letting out a small laugh, “and he doesn’t hate Muggles anymore. And, he feels really bad for a lot of the things he did - or, well, he’s wishing he hadn’t done them in the first place is what I meant. He looks different too. More relaxed, I guess.”
“He was transferred recently,” Harry said. “He made some questionable decisions when he was with the Law Enforcement department. Not enough to sack him, but…”
“Uh," Harry said and wondered if this was one of those history lessons he had slept through. “Not… Not really?”
“Good. Although, we didn’t exactly do anything yet.”
"Jump for me," Harry said instead, and the room hummed in a white heat of possibility. Who was to say they weren't innocent?
Draco tensed up.
“How?”
“Don’t call me that”, Harry laughed. “Besides, you’re definitely the kinky one.”
Draco swallowed down hard.
The woman unsteadily walked to a desk that stood in front of a window and pulled out a roll of parchment from the drawer. She nodded to Draco.
“I see,” Draco said. “Would it be forward of me to assume that makes him of the suspects?”
Harry frowned. That made what Larry had said sound even more peculiar.
“Oh, I am sassy," Harry said. “It tends to get me in trouble.”
for me, you know? And even if - like Ron for example, or even Hermione, they don't really…"
much taller," Harry said.
“You never told me why Pansy did it," Harry said. “I mean, you don’t have to.”
“Oh yeah? So he also told you how gross he thought it was? Do you think-” Harry’s voice got caught in his throat and he suddenly felt himself tear up, “do you honestly think he would treat me the same if- if I...”
“I guess we’ll find out. I’m not about to just keep it in my pocket, it’s not safe.”
Harry sighed and got up. And there they stood, Harry looking up at Draco, Draco looking down at him. He
“The only person I need you to be friends with is me," Harry said.
Harry sighed.
Harry was a little taken aback.
“You don’t get to give me orders before you tell me what the hell happened!”
“It says, ‘Neville told me’... Are you sure he didn’t just embellish the story a little bit?”
please,
“Oh, that - my assistant will have taken care of that. I have her ask all the routine questions.”
“Something along the lines of ‘you shouldn’t be gay and especially not for him’.”
Draco felt the blood escape his face as he came to the realization that he was looking at Harry Potter, and that this was his room.
“He comes around sometimes,” Maita said quizzically and added in the crushed Bicorn horn. Just a bit early for Draco’s taste, though he tried not to notice this. He supposed it was one of those professional things.
Neville raised his brows, and Draco realized it wasn’t the timing of the murder Neville thought nasty, it was the murder itself.
"Then you'll join the circus or become a carpenter," Remus said. "Or whatever you want. You're the only one who's holding you up to all these expectations."
“Yes, of course," Harry said, a little annoyed over how little trust Malfoy placed in him.
?” He said.
"But how would he ever find out where we hid it?"
“I’m sure I don’t,” Draco said.
"Well, unfortunately you're my only grandson." Grandmother Yana took out a silver case from her robes and pulled out a cigarette. She lit it with a routined motion of her hand and took a deep breath, her shoulders relaxing. She let out the smoke from her mouth and watched as it curled into patterns in the air.
"Oh, I did," Harry said and threw a quick glance at Ron, who was still standing there in the awkward way lanky, tall boys stand when they are trying to appear small. "You gave him quite the fright."
“Not here.”
Open-mouthed, on a high off of tasting, breathing in Draco's scent, Harry kissed the side of his neck, nibbling and sucking and biting on the skin, leaving behind little red marks as if to say, "I was here". Carding through Harry's hair, Draco tilted his head in response and moaned quietly, low in his throat when Harry got to a particular spot.
“Sure, but we have to start now. I need to be somewhere tonight.”
Hermione smiled at Ron, letting out a breath she had been holding.
“You shave?” Ron laughed. “Why?”
"What," Harry breathed even though he knew what Draco meant. It wasn't as if he could do anything before he said it.
Harry let out a breath against Draco’s neck, leaning his palm against the cool stone wall behind Draco, and Draco knew at that point he could have made Harry come just by talking.
Harry found himself surprisingly reluctant to walk into the mirror. Something, something he couldn’t really point out, was very eerie about the whole thing. But he had beaten Voldemort. And at least a hundred dementors, and several Death Eaters, he reminded himself. Walking into danger simply was what he
"I never said that," Narcissa hisses, wiping away the tears as they roll down her cheeks.
Draco felt unease taking over him as he realized the situation. He hadn't really given it much thought before, but now... It would never be over for Harry. Being in danger, sacrificing himself for everyone. Being a hero. What an absolute idiot, Draco thought. Worry made a wrinkle on the bridge of his nose.
"So you're kidnapping me?" Draco said. "How eloquent of you."
A witch called Juno Toadsworth was head instructor for the Auror Training programme. She was a retired Auror who spoke with a strange, vaguely Nordic accent and was about as tall as Harry had been at twelve years old. She was a brilliant teacher and a particularly good storyteller, but much to Harry’s disappointment, he wouldn’t have many of her classes before third year. Toadsworth was, however, always present during exams, and this morning was no exception.
"And where do you keep these other godfathers?" Harry had said, and they both had laughed. Harry wanted to be the best godfather there ever was. Just like his own had been.
“Hi," Draco said in a tone that made the word more like a question than a greeting. Then he suddenly realized - Granger must have somehow found out what happened. Had she come to the dorm along with Weasley? Draco didn’t remember seeing anyone, but then again he also hadn’t exactly stopped to admire the view on his way out.
“Yes, ehm-” Harry said. “The file? I trust you have it?”
“Would it kill you to hold that over me, too?”
“I’m fine," Harry croaked and coughed a little. “What was it that you asked again?” Harry was painfully aware of how unnatural he sounded. Why was he so nervous anyway? So he wanted to maybe befriend Malfoy - so what? No big deal, right? Except, it kind of was, and Harry felt like it was something he probably should keep from Ron, for now.
Lucius travels to London to take care of some business and to try to track down his amulet that he suspects Draco has sold to fund his studies, and he promises he'll try to find out what really happened with the Amortentia while he's there. He's too proud to confront Draco about it personally, but Narcissa doesn't blame him. The war took so much from him, his son not among the least valuable things.
“You're joking, right?”
Harry woke up on Monday morning at 4AM to another paper crane behind his window. He turned on the light, got out of bed, fairly sure he was dreaming it all, and opened the window. The crane crashed into the floor and flopped there like a fish on dry ground until Harry picked it up. He unfolded it and squinted at the blurred lines. He then realized he wasn’t wearing his glasses. After finding them on his desk and putting them on, he could read the note.
Harry's smile faded.
“Are you sure it’s a good idea to wear it?” Harry said as Draco got up and used Scourgify on his hands.
"We could do a 'rags to riches' sort of thing for the special," the other voice answered.
Here we are, then. Thank you so much for reading A Handful of Snakes! The sequel is coming, hopefully starting this winter. If you have any questions concerning that or this work, feel free to message me on Tumblr! My handle on there is welcometothefrogparade.
“But in the comics, where does he live? Surely somewhere. Or does he sleep in a web?”
The professor tilted her head.
"Just fuck me," Draco husked against his ear, his voice breathless.
"So it was you that made the first move?" Remus asked, now a tone of surprise in his voice.
“I see," Lucius said, giving a nod. “And why, if I may ask?”
Harry excitedly nodded.
Neville, Ron and Hermione were all there. Neville was sitting in one of the armchairs, holding two small sticks that had a knotty mess of red yarn hanging from them. Hermione was reading and occasionally giving instructions to Neville. She was sitting in the corner of the sofa with her legs curled up under a blanket. Ron was resting his head on them, busy with throwing a superball against the wall, catching it as it bounced back.
“Why don’t you just say what you wanted to say and go," Malfoy said and started pouring blue liquid from one vial into another. He had a look of concentration to him when he swirled the liquid around until it turned purple.
on my door.”
Draco and Harry glanced at each other. An aura of feeling like mere schoolboys again was about the air. It certainly seemed like they had just been invited to come in and sit down, so they did so, and the Headmistress gave a small nod of approval. Still, her lips were pursed together in a narrow line, and her eyes darted from one man to the other. Draco doubted she had been so on edge since the Battle of Hogwarts.
"What?" Harry felt worried all of a sudden. That didn't sound like Luna at all. "Out of Magizoology? Why? I mean, she's so good at it."
“And you," Harry said, raising his wand at the animagus, “if you ever blabber about my business to him again-”
“What’s that?” Draco asked. Harry handed him the card, and he frowned at the first words.
After Draco makes a run for it, Ron and Harry are left behind to deal with the aftermath of the situation.
A moment of eye contact. Draco let Harry hang in there for a while, taking in the visual of Auror Potter on his knees, and then said:
“Did something happen?” Harry asked as he followed Draco. “Are you alright?”
, not Nemrot. Now, whatever you have heard about it, I can assure you-”
“It’s not so bad," Harry said, his finger tracing nonsense words in cursive onto the table. “He’s actually a lot nicer these days.”
“Anything interesting at the Ministry?” Harry asked and started to search his shoulder bag for a snack bar. He only found the empty wrapper and realized he had already eaten it during the lecture.
“And not me, I never even told Luna about-”
“He isn’t… doing so well with school," Harry said, his smile fading. “I had to help him with Charms last week.”
"I mean," Harry said and didn't continue.
“Scars from what?” Harry asked, but at the same time as the words left his mouth, he realized.
“Not anymore I’m not," Draco said and slowly started to throw mushrooms into the cauldron.
“What’s happened?” Harry said.
"There's no time for this right now," Harry said, visibly uncomfortable. "I'll find out who killed professor Toadsworth and figure… Figure this thing out. I'll send an owl here when it's safe to contact us."
“He would be proud of you I think," he said. “For what it’s worth.”
figured”, Dean corrected as he sat down opposite from his boyfriend.
This time it didn’t last very long, as just after Harry was finished talking about the funeral he and his friends had held for one of Longbottom’s legged flower pots that had ran into the hallway and fallen down the stairs, he looked at Draco, nodded to his right and said: “Come on. I know a place we can chill at for a while.”
“Well, Ron grew up as a wizard," Harry said, leaning back in the armchair. “It probably seems more normal to him than it does to us.”
"What?"
“Is it just me,” Draco said, stepping closer to Harry, “or is Mr. Potter feeling just a tiny bit jealous today?”
Harry pressed the button with the picture of opening doors on it. Nothing happened.
Draco had said he hadn’t particularly enjoyed the book himself, but he had a hunch Harry would. Harry didn’t disagree with him - the story began to unravel right on the first page without excessive descriptions of landscapes or complicated histories of fictional families; all things that Harry tended to skip to get to the good parts - but despite that, he was finding it difficult to concentrate on reading. Across the round glass table, Draco was sketching a picture of him.
“You told him?” Malfoy asked, irritation in his voice.
Harry tried to keep a straight face as he pretended to read Malfoy's homework. He was just waiting for Malfoy to get to the good part.
“Why are you trying so hard to make it seem like I’m somehow a good person?”
“And where is your room?”
It had started to rain when Harry began making his way back to the dorms. He passed through the courtyard like he often did, in an attempt to get some fresh air before losing himself in piles of assignments and reading. There was a smell of wet asphalt and autumn in the air.
"Of course," he said, leaning back in his chair as if giving space to Draco. "You know, I once knew someone in your situation. Someone who was from a family not a lot unlike yours, and who rebelled against them and picked his own path in life… Of course, it's a kind of pain that never quite leaves a person, even when they find new people that become their family."
“Oh no," Harry said and covered his mouth with his palms in an effort to control the flood of emotions the little pot with woollen socks awakened in him.
"Know what it's like," Draco said.
“Look, I appreciate the sentiment, but I really don’t think you want to hear it”, Harry said. “Besides, it’s not like we talk about you and Hermione…” Harry shuddered trying to continue the sentence. “You know.”
Draco leaned over and kissed Harry. They hadn’t kissed that day, and it quickly became apparent from the way Harry’s body reacted to it. It felt like lighting the first match in a line of matches that led into a dried-to-crisp forest on an August afternoon - it was just one match at first, but you couldn’t really light it without thinking about the final result. And just as Harry started to lose his track of thought, just as everything was becoming red and hazy and sizzling and Draco was wantonly, almost possessively taking the lead and all Harry could think about was how much he wanted to go back to his room and see where it all would lead if they let it, Draco pulled back. He gave a smirk and Harry could tell he was now getting his revenge for when Harry had teased him earlier.
“Besides, Pansy could have still been there and she could have… you know.”
Ron shook his head.
“Got it covered up," he said. Harry knew from the look on his face that he was talking about the Dark Mark.
She was a cheerful, bleach-blonde Auror, and cute as a button as far as Draco was concerned. That is, on the same basis that he considered kittens cute - they had big eyes, they were small, and unmistakably harmless.
“And there isn’t just tops and bottoms”, Dean noted. “Some people like to switch, and a lot of people don’t even do the bum stuff.”
“Hermione?” Harry said. “Are you here?”
" Draco replied with the formal hello as he wasn't sure what else to say. It had been many years since they had last met and had it been for Draco to choose, he could have happily lived the rest of his life without ever speaking with the hag again.
“You’re kidding," Draco huffed. “And what would the Weasleys say, seeing you there in this company? I think not.”
“Judging by the pace new Weasleys keep popping up”, Draco said, lowering his voice to a teasing whisper as he leaned to speak into Harry’s ear again, “I would reckon his family isn't exactly made up of prudes.”
Ron spent the following weekend visiting his parents at the Burrow. He had begged Harry to go with him to cause some kind of distraction whenever the subject of the AT programme came up at the dinner table, but Harry was starting to be so behind on his assignments (mainly due to the two nights he had spent arguing with Malfoy in the Alchemy lab and in professor Skepperus’ office), that he had had no choice but to stay at the college.
Fuming, his mind racing so that he heard buzzing in his ears, he walked hallways he didn’t see until he found himself in the Dungeons, standing before the open door of the Potions classroom. He fantasized for a moment of brewing Essence of Insanity, or even Cough potion or any simple concoction that might take his mind off of the mess at hand, and then he stopped to wonder why the door was open. Then he heard a faint clink coming from inside the classroom, and when he listened for a bit longer, the gentle humming of something boiling at low heat.
Malfoy was staring at him, out of breath with anger but also with a confused look, as if he had expected some other reaction out of Harry.
“Oh- sorry,” Harry said and leaned closer, holding his wand so that it now shielded Draco from the rain.
“Yeah. You ok?”
don't understand," Draco said, shaking his head as if they were in grave danger.
"Is your father that worried about the afterlife?"
Lucius stared at Draco for a moment. And then he left, his robes swishing as he did.
“Heard you got laid”, he said.
"He's more than a friend."
“If I could obliviate everyone who knew me back then…” Draco said, shaking his head.
"Ah, you noticed," Seamus said and patted on Dean's thigh again, "you should've seen Ron's face when he found out a few minutes ago!" Seamus laughed.
“Is it? Then what was that?” Draco said, unable to stop a mischievous laugh from escaping. “Do you mean I’m not… deep enough?”
"Well, I did that internship at Cuddlebogs Conservatory," Neville said, and having finished drinking, leaned onto the kitchen counter. He looked the same as last year - tall, gentle and slightly unkempt. "I saw Luna a couple of times... Not much happened, to be honest."
“Yeah.”
When Molly Weasley opened the door, Draco was twice the amount convinced that this was the closest thing to a mother of Harry he was ever going to meet. She wore a dress with a cardigan and an apron over the both of them, all made up of a thousand different patterns and colours, and she, or the house, or both of them, smelled like nutmeg and oranges. As soon as she saw Harry, she let out some kind of delighted
“Will you help me with Charms?”
“It’s normal to have short-term memory loss after having Amortentia," Harry said. “I read about it.”
the mirror, like into the reflection, and returns not longer than a minute later, dragging Harry with her. Harry was shaking - he threw up the second his feet touched the ground and he sort of collapsed, but wouldn't let anyone touch him. I tried to help him up but he raised his wand at me-”
"Well, the thing about being raised is, you kind of have to be not kept in a closet to take part in something like that." Harry twirled Draco's hair around his index finger and wondered what it would look like curly.
Harry forced a smile and continued to stare at his parchment. What was it about getting back at Malfoy that sounded about as exciting as helping Gilderoy Lockhart answer his fan mail? Wouldn't it be better to just, try to forget and forgive? Or at least forget?
The way Draco pronounced the author’s name made Harry think about their conversation with Lucius, and how Draco had asked him if he had taken Narcissa to Russia.
"That's the spirit," Percy said, perhaps choosing to ignore or simply not picking up Ron's sarcasm.
“You-”
Harry leaned forward.
“You’re quiet today, Potter.”
"We aren't going to the Burrow today, are we?"
“At least Malfoy knows what he’s doing”, Seamus said. “Doesn’t strike me as a bottom, though, that lad.”
“He may not have realized everything he does when he’s with you might end up on the front page," Hermione said. She noticed Harry was holding the book Draco had given him.
“I don’t think it is," Harry said and walked to the desk. “He has bad eyesight, remember? I don’t think he could very easily tell the notebook apart from all those just by the spine.”
“What if it’s important?”
Harry blinked and read it again a couple of times, just to make sure. Draco wanted him to go to the courtyard… right now? Harry shivered at the cold air coming in through the open window. He closed it, his limbs feeling weak from not yet being properly awake. He looked at the note again, turning it over and upside down, but there was no more writing on it.
“Larry," Harry said and as he noticed Hermione’s confused expression, continued, “the man in our dorm portrait.”
"You know about the Deathly Hallows, right? And how a triangle symbolizes the Cloak of Invisibility."
“No, she tried to," Harry said, “she really did, but I… I didn’t really give her the chance to. By the time I started feeling better, she had already been offered a place at the Harpies.”
“You look like you’re feeling better.”
Draco stared at Harry, trying to take in what he had just said.
Draco couldn’t stop smiling once Gwen had left.
Harry slid down from his chair, and sitting cross-legged on the floor, started to sort through the pile of papers, chewed-up pencils and erasers that he had poked full of little graphite-coloured dots. Harry flinched as he thought he had seen a spider in between some papers - then, as he noticed it wasn’t moving, he picked it up and in a mixed state of fascination and disgust, tried to figure out what it was. A tiny bezoar? Or maybe a dried-up grape. So, technically a raisin, right?
Harry swallowed down and nodded.
The Alchemy Lab was a set of three classrooms, all connected by the hallway in which Harry was now standing. He had never been inside, but he knew where to go as only the last classroom had light shining through the closed door. He took off his shoes and managed to get to the door without making a single sound. He pressed his ear against it, but heard nothing except little clinks and clanks of glass dishes and instruments being moved from one place to the other. Harry listened for quite a while, and soon he was sure that Malfoy was inside alone. Two students brewing something would have made more noise, and even if the other one had just been sitting there, surely they would have at least talked to each other. Harry wasn’t quite sure how to proceed. This was the perfect opportunity to talk to Malfoy but he didn’t want to make it seem like he had stalked him or something. Even though he kind of had, hadn’t he?
“Boo! Get a room," Harry said.
“So when - how long ago was this?” Harry said. He was still struggling to understand why anyone would send a postcard to Draco and him. The only person who even knew that they were friends was Hermione.
Draco didn't need to ask twice - dizzy for it, Harry started to gently thrust in and out, eventually settling on a pace that wasn't either brutal or slow, one hand stroking Draco's cock.
“What do you think?” Draco said as they walked the corridors, heading towards the library. They passed by several Aurors and other officials from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, recognizable by a badge they all wore with the letters “DMLE” embossed on it. They all nodded to Harry and he nodded back, but didn’t respond to their attempts at small-talk. Draco wasn’t sure if he was just imagining it, but it felt like many of the officials and Aurors were surprised to see him with Harry. It was unthinkable they wouldn’t have known about Harry’s marriage, as someone had leaked that information to none other than Rita Skeeter a mere few months ago. The headlines had been most imaginative, but they paled in comparison to the articles themselves, which described elaborate (and expensive) celebrations in vivid detail, none of which had actually taken place. Draco doubted their Magistrate counter-wedding could have been twisted to look so grand, even if by some miracle both of their families would have attended.
“I requested they leave it until you arrive. The department healer did visit, to make sure she is… well, dead.”
“Alright," Ron said, nodding in exaggerating bobs, “that settles it then. Come on now, let the man have a bit of breakfast in peace.”
"Do you know Rolf?" He finally said.
“Oh. I didn’t know that.”
“No," Granger said, “I-”
’s pretty common too”, Dean said. “That one has protection. And then there’s
“What - so I can’t make Polyjuice Potion because I get hay fever?”
Harry frowned. Had Draco been lying when he said he wasn’t dating Pansy? But why would he have lied about something like that? Besides, together or not, it wasn’t like Malfoy to swoon after someone like that. Or at least, it didn’t seem like him to Harry.
Draco could only manage half a smile. He was somewhat used to the company of Harry's friends by now, but it was still strange to be at Weasley's house.
“Yes," Larry said and leaned towards Harry. His voice was now a hoarse whisper. Something about the way he carried himself reminded Harry of Cedric Diggory.
“Right,” Harry said. “The murderer could still be in the castle,” he continued, lowering his voice. “Or someone else. It wouldn’t be the first time someone broke in.”
“Yeah," Harry said and turned his gaze into his unopened notebook on the desk. He hated himself when he was like this. He felt like he was unintentionally harsh to everyone whenever someone tried to talk to him, and the last person he wanted to be rude to right now was Draco Malfoy.
“He’ll find out soon enough anyway," Seamus said. “It wasn’t me, mate, I swear.”
"Well... yes."
Grandmother Yana clicked her tongue. "That family has gone to the dogs. Literally!"
“Pansy put Amortentia in your coffee. The effects hit you when we were already at the hospital, and then we got stuck in an elevator. By the time the custodian got us out, it was already dark outside and you were ready to physically knock out anyone who would stop you from getting to Pansy. I didn’t want to give her the chance to give you another dose so I smuggled you in here and made you drink a sleeping potion. That’s it.”
“Oh”, Harry said. “I didn’t-”
now? So you actually fancy him? And, and you’re expecting me to just say, ‘oh okay Harry, you know what, love who you love’?”
“If only the odds were in my favour like that," Draco said. The awkwardness in the air only grew thicker as they passed the station.
"Hullo, ma'am”, Harry said, “we - did the officials not tell you I was assigned the case of Professor Toadsworth?"
“He isn’t going to find it,” Draco said.
“When do you have that exam you talked about?” Draco asked to try to get Harry talking, quickly. A restlessness was taking over him - not an unpleasant one, but it was certainly of a nature that Draco didn’t want to give encouragement to. It had happened to him before, many years ago, upon many different occasions, and he knew exactly how to deal with it.
It was pretty much established in Harry’s head at this point that he thought Draco was handsome. Which was normal, because it wasn’t as if, just because he was straight he couldn’t appreciate another guy’s beauty. He thought of it as beauty, because there was something very delicate about Draco’s harshness. Like the way his brows moved ever so slightly closer together creating a little worried-looking wrinkle in between when he was concentrating on something. And there was that hint of something blue, something absent-minded and gently mournful in the gray of his eyes whenever he was deep in his thoughts, probably not aware that Harry was looking. And all that made the way his face transformed when he was laughing a hundred times more delightful to look. Draco’s laugh was boyish and genuine and Harry loved it because it always sounded like the laugh of someone who was laughing for the first time in their life.
Harry got up and decided to go see what his flatmates were up to.
“Ah, for the thing. Yeah, I’ll check”, Neville said.
here, anyway? On Christmas, I mean?” Draco said.
“I’ve been in the mirror too," Draco said. Harry tensed when he heard it, but Draco didn’t loosen his grip on him. “It was at a shop in Knockturn Alley at the time... I was just a kid. A nosey one too, and my parents thought I had gotten lost. They must have looked for me for hours, and then finally mum came into the mirror to get me. I’ve never seen her so angry.”
"What, killed Potter?"
“Not for this potion, usually, but… Well, to me it would only make sense. Just the smell is making me feel better.”
“It definitely wasn’t that”, Harry said through the laughter. “I think I’d remember…”
"Golly," Ron said, "I better get my act together then."
“In my room," Harry sniffled.
“Hello, Theodore,” he said. “Glad you could make it. I’m sure you understand that I’ll need to have a chat with you before you leave.”
“We got a whole parliament,” George said, but only his wife chuckled. “You know, a flock of owls is called… Ah, nevermind.”
“Wasn’t exactly easy to get you to take the sleeping potion," Harry said and took off his flannel, revealing a worn out T-shirt that showed enough skin on the arms for Draco to notice a red bite mark. “Had to wrestle you
And, there was actually a third thing about Malfoy that had started to bother Harry recently. Harry had no idea what had happened to him after the big battle where Voldemort had finally been defeated. Harry was keen to know, because leading up to the battle a lot of things had happened that had made Harry wonder about Draco. Like the time he hadn’t revealed to Bellatrix that it was Harry who the snatchers had caught, or before that, when Harry had seen Draco lower his wand just before Dumbledore’s death. Or the time before that, when Harry had found Draco crying in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“Act like I don’t exist," Draco said. “They do.”
“Exhale.”
Later that day Harry went to see Draco. He had come up with a good idea for a date and wanted to ask him out, and also, in addition to that, he hadn't seen Draco in a few hours which alone… It felt stupid to even admit to himself in his thoughts, but Harry already missed him. Being by himself was okay and it wasn't as if he didn't have schoolwork to do, but… Draco. Draco was there,
“Greenhouses are always in season,” Neville said. “That’s what I like about them. But you’re not the first one to wonder about it. That Professor Toadsworth was interested in it, too.”
“Adorable, isn’t it?” Neville laughed and picked up the pot. “Oh, by the way - I’m going to the Owlery for a bit, should I check if you guys have any mail?”
“Sorry," Harry said, but didn’t make an effort to get up.
“Someone’s already awake," Harry said under his breath and started looking for something with his gaze. “I’ll sneak you out of here.”
Harry and Draco go out on a date, and the aftermath makes Harry wonder if Draco knew what he signed up for.
"I couldn't have come up with a longer way to ask someone to call me by my first name if I had tried."
"I don't have to tell you anything", Draco said. A coldness that he hadn't needed to use in a long time was returning into his voice.
Malfoy was leaning his chin onto his index fingers and looked like he was pondering hard at something.
“No, I do believe you’re required inside,” Harry said. “In fact, why don’t you wait for me there?”
“How could I not?” Harry said. “She taught us- well, me, for…”
“You and Draco are on the cover of the Prophet.”
“Then what the bloody hell did you kiss him for?” Ron exclaimed.
“I didn’t know her. I extended an offering to three persons I found eligible for the position, and she was the only one that was willing. It surprised me, I must say. Professor Abboud from Darthorn, who is an old student of mine, told me Toadsworth had been planning her retirement for years, and that not much could be expected from her.”
“I know what you mean,” Draco said. He was used to nasty relatives, but they weren’t the kind of people one would be wise to mention in the presence of Neville Longbottom.
The sound disappeared for a moment and then started again.
“Ah, it’s always the forbidden fruit, isn’t it," Seamus said, a smug smile on his face. “Don’t you worry on it, lads. Your secret’s safe with me. Well, I’ll tell Dean of course," he said as he walked to the portrait, “but that’s it. No one important at least. Not the press, definitely. Unless they ask me, that is. A couple galleons for a scoop doesn't sound bad when you're dating an artist, just saying...”
A silence filled with rainfall, a flash of lightning and a thunderclap followed. Harry hesitated. His chest felt tight with nervousness, but there was really no better time than the present, right? It was just him and Hermione, at least for a short moment still before Neville would return from the Owlery.
"I hope you're kidding, man. This is your chance to get back at the bastard!"
They shared a brief moment of eye contact, and then Harry tilted his head and said:
"I thought you had somehow found out that I… And that maybe you were just, fucking with me."
"Uh," Harry said, scratching a nonexistent itch at the nape of his neck, "eight?"
On Saturday morning, after a late breakfast with Neville, Harry started doing some reading for one of his independent courses. Its name, A Closer Look at the B-6 Class of Ministry of Magic Forms Currently in Official Use, was an omen of how mind-numbingly boring the reading materials were. They were written in an overflowingly formal style that was practically begging to come across as pretentious. The text was abundant with complicated words that no one actually used in real life, and Harry found himself reading a sentence and forgetting what it was about by the time he got to the end. When this started happening with every sentence, he tossed the book onto his bed and decided to work on something more practical.
"Alright," Harry said and pulled Draco closer, placing a kiss below his ear.
“Well, we were actually looking to interview a nurse," Harry said. “We just think they’re the most underappreciated people in the whole, uh, society right now. Unsung heroes, isn’t that right, Draco?” Harry flashed a confident smile at Draco, who was staring at the ceiling impatiently.
They stand there in silence, and though neither of them moves, Narcissa feels the space between them grow too large to cross.
Come midnight, Harry was still doing homework. Ron was in his room too, with his homework spread on the bed along with a bag of crisps that rustled whenever Ron reached his hand inside. It had become a habit for the two to do homework together at night. Harry had found he could concentrate better when his friends weren't having fun in the next room and Ron... Well, he never seemed to remember about homework before it was already dark outside.
Harry didn’t answer. He was looking at Draco, and at his lips, and probably fighting back an urge that wasn’t appropriate to have at work. No wonder, really. It had been a while.
“I have no idea," Harry said. He gave a smile. “But it’s apparently a good thing.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”
Harry skimmed through the article.
“I’m under the impression he was placed in the library to wait for further questioning.”
Draco did as he had asked, though at this point any word out of Harry, any fracture of a movement would have been enough to send him tumbling over the edge.
"You're no fun, Big D."
“It’s me being your friend," she said.
Ron didn't have time to answer before Percy Weasley's presence filled the whole room. He had been living in the dorm before starting his new internship as a bookkeeper in the Ministry of Magic and now, judging by the empty cardboard box he was holding, he had come to clear out what was still left of his belongings in the flat. Perhaps out of pride or solidarity towards Hermione, he was wearing his PoM uniform, complete with a navy blue blazer and a golden lapel pin in the shape of a small hammer.
“Me too,” Draco said after a while. “I’m so tired of the running. I’m tired of chasing him.”
“Do you know why I always hated you?” Draco asked and sipped his coffee. The bridge of his nose crinkled at the taste.
“Harry, I’m failing Charms again," Ron said, his voice muffled against Harry’s uniform jacket. “I’m never going to be an Auror, am I?”
Harry laughed.
“Not really magic I guess," Harry said. “Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider on a school trip, and then the next morning when he woke up…”
"Is that all?"
Draco turned to look at Harry with a frown.
“Why, Draco? You know better than to be seen with the likes of him.”
"Adrik is 65 already and has been underground for forty-seven years," grandmother Yana sighed. "But I trust him more than your father. He will adopt someone and set things right for this family."
“Exactly," Hermione said. She shook her head. “I don’t know what to do. I mean, I help him as much as I can but lately he won’t even let me do that.”
Harry seemed a little caught off guard. Just as Draco had intended, really.
Harry and Ron ate in silence for a moment. Hermione started to eye the Daily Prophet that was laid out on the table.
“What’s there to cram?” Draco asked, ignoring Skepperus and the sounds of chairs being moved as the class was dismissed. “You know how to defend yourself.”
“You-” He started but then leaned into his fist for a second, “how…” He looked frustrated. “How the fuck were you not expelled? How were you
"No. And he's made sure no one else in my family will either," Draco said, fiddling with his sleeve. "Not that I'd want anything to do with them, anyway."
"Oh," Harry said. He thought about it for a moment. "But it probably doesn't count if there's just
“Checked on the Polyjuice Potion after class," Draco said. He looked as if he had said it just to fill the silence, with no real intention of going anywhere with the story.
As if on cue, Neville, or at least Harry assumed it was Neville who was carrying a large, potted plant that looked like it had a green head of hair instead of leaves, almost tripped on the doorstep. Harry took a few steps in an attempt to catch the plant, were it to fall, but somehow Neville managed to keep his balance.
"Draco," Harry said in a stern voice. "It's okay. She gave you Amortentia, do you understand? It will wear off."
Draco shrugged again.
“No matter,” Draco said too quickly for it to sound natural. “I’m used to it."
“If you’re gay," Seamus said. “Like a test. It’s real simple too.”
“What thing?” Harry asked after Neville had left.
Harry was already about to say "Hogwarts" when Draco touched his arm to interrupt him.
Harry ignored Theodore's cursing - it didn't sound as bad considering his voice was becoming squeakier by the second - and watched as he turned into a duck. The duck stared at him for a moment and quacked.
“So, are you going to tell me why Draco was there or do you want me to guess?” Hermione said, crossing her arms.
“I don’t understand who would do such a thing.”
"Yeah?" The Triwizard Tournament came to mind, but Harry knew that probably wasn't what Draco was talking about.
- and then stopped giving him any friction whatsoever. At this point Draco was starting to be delirious enough that he might have actually started begging, but then, luckily, Harry took him in his mouth again. Only, now he pressed his lips tight around the tip for a while, rolling his tongue over and back, and then stopped again, raising his brows at Draco like presenting a challenge.
“Some”, Draco said and moved a couple strands of hair that hung in front of Harry’s eyes. “When we used to visit our place in Moscow, I had a friend there. Dimitri.”
"Don't."
Draco finds himself entertaining some peculiar thoughts about The Boy Who Lived.
Harry quickly leaned forward and pecked Draco on the lips, pulling back as soon as their mouths had barely touched.
him, he had taken over my body, and he was going to hunt down all the traitors, and you… You didn’t know it wasn’t me, you thought I’d survived the crash.”
Granger let out a sigh. “They’re probably fighting.”
“Sorry. I don’t mean to pry.”
since they were trying not to wake everyone else up, but, something like that) under the dim, warm light of the kitchen lamp that hung low above the table. It was a little after midnight and Harry was starting to feel more like himself again. Usually it took him a few days after a breakdown to stop feeling out of it, but he had a feeling that this time, maybe due to him being distracted by the new person in his life, it would be different. In fact, it was already different. Harry didn’t have the feeling that he was going to spiral and end up somewhere where no one could reach him. Draco didn’t seem afraid of the darkness. Or at least he was on speaking terms with it.
Draco then read the quote to Harry, who at this point was staring at the young man, experiencing waves of euphoria that he suspected were side effects of utterly, irreversibly,
"Well, you're only half correct. He didn't ask about the wedding since I thought we should at least decide on a colour for the invitations first."
Harry frowned.
“They immediately assumed you guys were dating," Ron said, giving a laugh. “What a git - I mean, Harry’s not even straight.”
“Well, we didn’t get caught is one reason," Harry said. “Besides - I got caught doing way worse things over the years. Of course I realized only a couple years ago why Dumbledore was willing to put up with all that.”
“There was a rumour going around that I somehow lost it after the war," Harry said. “Which, I mean - it isn’t true, but I also was at St Mungo’s for a couple months and the Prophet obviously made it into a whole thing… I don’t know, after a while I just stopped caring and let people believe what they want.”
“So it
Draco let out a sigh and fell on his back on the bed. Harry looked at him, and his hands stopped fumbling inside his bag.
“You’ve changed, Harry!” Harry heard Ron sneer after him as he walked out of the dorm.
“And professor Abboud couldn’t point out what you did wrong?”
The password to Draco’s dorm was “
"My father got the worst of it though. He hasn't walked properly since… it's really no wonder he didn't want me around his house. I just remind him of everything that went wrong."
Draco frowned, as this clearly wasn't the response he had been expecting.
“No," Hermione said. “Just before you didn’t shake his hand. He came up to you - Ron and I were standing next to you - to introduce himself.”
“Where is Charlie, anyway?”
"Let's hope they don't break up, I guess," Harry said and swallowed a sip of tea. It was too hot, but there wasn't time to let it cool down. He added a little more milk.
"I got the impression from your mother that your intention is to let this family die out. Tell me, is this true?"
"Well, clearly not," Remus said, probably referring to the article. "It's very brave of you, as usual, but…"
"And what if I don't like what it's really like?" Harry said, his voice small.
“To have a little chat with your professor," Draco said. And murder her if she did what I think she did, Draco thought to himself.
"Bending over for me are we," Harry said, his grin spilling over the corners of his mouth. "How generous of you."
Having skimmed through the reading material, Harry knew the class would be about what muggles would've called first aid. It was the sort of thing Aurors ought to know about since they were essentially both the police and the military of the wizarding world. They handled magical crime either as it happened or were the first to see the aftermath. Either way, more often than not someone on site had a broken rib or a nose on the wrong side of the face. Treating that sort of thing wrong (think Lockhart when Harry had broken his arm) would get the Ministry in a lot of hot water, not to even mention the paperwork.
kind of moody and tense but not… not like he used to be. He wouldn’t call you the m-word anymore. Sometimes it almost feels like he- I guess
"Sure. But I'm warning you, I'm not going to lose this time."
The class wasn’t the only thing Harry would have liked to talk about with Draco. He was dying to know why Pansy had tricked him into drinking Amortentia if the two weren’t even friends anymore. The whole situation just seemed so strange, and since Harry had been the one to help Draco - had he liked it or not -, he felt too invested to just let the whole thing slide.
Draco huffed. “How the hell are you supposed to study for something like that?”
"They're not freezing. The house elves."
Draco raised his brows.
“Are you serious? Why?”
“What was it about?”
"It's just a bee. They don't do anything if you don't swing your arms at them. Anyway, it's good that you've found him."
Hermione looked up from the newspaper and raised her other eyebrow in a way that made Harry quickly gulp down the rest of his tea, get up and go to his room. He could still hear the rest of the conversation.
“Ten points to Gryffindor," Charlie said, and immediately started laughing as he realized his error. “Nevermind that. Now, who knows why it has purple eyes?”
in there, wasn’t it?”
"I would, yes," Dean said, "but mostly because you're straight."
“Bloody hell," Ron said and laughed into his sleeve, trying not to wake up the others.
“What happened to you after Hogwarts?”

“Why do you-”
"No, I can't… In the mirror I was - if I keep taking them I'll die-"
“Because I do care," Harry said. “You didn’t kill Dumbledore. You didn’t tell Bellatrix it was me at the mansion, and I never got to know why. And now you’re here wearing Muggle clothes and telling your old friends to piss off, and it just doesn’t seem like you.”
“Not exactly.”
“What do you mean?”
"How are you, professor?" Draco said once the silence had lingered for an unsettling amount of time.
Harry smiled.
Draco really know what he was getting into? Or was Harry just the furthest thing from his family Draco could imagine and therefore a seemingly good option? Of course, Harry didn’t think that, he didn’t want to think that, but with everyone’s attitude towards the matter… It was kind of difficult not to feel discouraged.
"If by corrupting he meant turning me gay, then the man is even thicker than I thought." Draco looked up at Remus. "He's also about ten years late in his observation."
“No," Draco said, visibly getting more and more annoyed as Harry’s voice interrupted his thoughts. “She didn’t tell me because I already knew. You know why I already knew? Because I’m the one who was to live as Draco Malfoy in this sorry excuse of a world, and to me it was perfectly logical why she did it. It’s none of my business whether it makes sense to you or not.”
Ron made a face that could have very well been featured in the before-portion of a laxative commercial.
At the time, Harry had had the feeling that Draco would change sides. That at any minute, he would rebel against his parents and fight the Death Eaters. But he never did, and Harry didn’t understand why, because it seemed like he had wanted to.
"Teddy is Draco's first cousin, once removed," Remus confirmed, nodding. "Given the circumstances, I think it might be wise for you to reconnect with some of the forgotten branches in your family," he said, directing his words to Draco. "I hope you'll let Harry bring you to meet Teddy some day."
"There," Draco said. "Now he's the richest free elf there ever was."
Harry silenced Draco with a kiss much more ardent than what Draco was accustomed to these days - it started with Harry pulling Draco closer by the back of his neck, and then making him stay there, stay still while Harry had his way around his mouth, and in it. When Harry pulled back, Draco found himself breathless and a little dumbfounded.
The man had wrapped himself up in a brown leather jacket, and his other arm was stretched out next to him, the hand holding a pair of glasses with round frames. It looked like he had fallen asleep in the middle of trying to place them further away from himself to avoid rolling over them in his sleep. Not that there was much space to roll over.
“The misuse of Amortentia," Hermione said. “Healers have been saying for years now that it should be made illegal but no one at the Ministry is listening. It’s pretty unbelievable when you think about it - it’s practically designed for sexual assault and they teach
“You look like this,” Draco said and leaned back down, imitating Harry’s heavy-lidded expression. “Impatient, much?”
What was it with these Gryffindors and their constant need to apologize when there was obviously no reason to? Draco knew exactly why she wanted to talk about Harry, and that wasn’t a conversation he was looking forward to.
"So that's where Harry gets it," he then said.
"So, it was… Everyone at school kind of assumed, since you're- and since you did what you did-"
Harry felt a certain desperation take over him about the whole situation as he walked to Draco’s dorm, the folded newspaper sandwiched between his arm and his side. It was becoming painfully obvious that he and Draco would never do anything without everyone talking about it, everyone having an opinion. And it wasn’t just because Harry was who he was - Draco’s family was very well known, not necessarily for their positive influence on the world, but still, the name Malfoy meant something. A lot, most of the time. And so did Potter, and it was as if Draco and Harry were trapped somewhere between the two, unable to escape.
"Don't what? Call you Draco?"
Draco's heart jumped. Surely it couldn't be...
"I do," Harry said, his lips pursing together at the memory. "Bellatrix threw a dagger at us when we disapparated, and it… he…"
Ron turned increasingly red at Harry's remark. "Gross," he said, making the slug face again. "They were in our dorm and everything..."
Harry was walking back to the dorms with the postcard in his pocket, keeping his head down so no one could tell that he had been - and was still - crying. Every time he thought he was about to calm down it started again, and Harry didn’t really know what to do because it wasn’t like him to cry like that. He just wanted to crawl into bed and stay there until everyone had forgotten he ever existed.
“Summer? Late summer, maybe July or August. Why?”
“I don’t know," Draco huffed. “Professor Abboud said it could be that I was using a copper cauldron, but even she couldn’t be sure.”
"We buried him by the sea where we apparated. He liked the place."
Harry didn't know what to say. He would have wanted to say that Draco didn't know better, that things were different now, but the words felt empty before they had even left Harry's mouth.
“Later. When it’s a happier day.”
Harry swallowed down and nodded, delirious from how much he wanted to do it. He probably would've begged if Draco had made him, but instead Draco gave a smirk.
A silence lingered for a moment.
want to kiss Draco. And now it was too late to pretend he didn't. Ron would never look at him the same ever again, would he? They wouldn’t laugh together or do homework or go see Quidditch games or spend weekends at the Burrow.
“You were saying?” Harry said. His voice was soft and low and fell like liquid, and he was taking his time.
“You are correct in your assumption, however your pronounciation of the name of the object in question deviates from the highest level of accuracy. It is called the Mirror of
“I’m fantasizing of retirement, if you truly wish to know. But unless I am gravely mistaken, you haven’t been summoned here to discuss the inner workings of my mind.”
One day in the early summer of 2001 Lucius tells Narcissa about his plan and at first, she doesn't like it. Lucius promises to not go through with it, at least not yet. Narcissa won't admit it, but she still hopes they won't have to intervene. That her son won't return to Darthorn for his second year, that he will return to them on his own after having suffered enough. She knows it's not right for a mother to wish that, but she can't help it. She misses her son and knows he must be lonely without his family, without his old friends. And Narcissa is angry with him, of course she is - for stealing from Lucius, for disrespecting him so blatantly, and even for leaving when Lucius told him to in the fit of his anger. Draco should have known better, he should have shown more loyalty to his family, if not to his father then at least to Narcissa.
“Figures," Draco huffed. “Listen, I’m as perplexed as you are as to why Harry would want to have anything to do with me, but that doesn’t mean-”
“Fair enough," Ron said, and to Harry’s great relief, started laying his Charms books on the table.
it," Granger said, “but not drink it. Don’t you see? You’re allergic to knotgrass! The itching and the rash, it was obviously an allergic reaction. That's why the potion doesn't work - your body rejects it instead of reacting with the magical properties."
" 'Mione made hundreds of socks for the house elves back in the day. Poor buggers are probably freezing now, with us gone and all."
“It's okay," Draco said, rubbing circles onto Harry’s back with his hand.
“Why do you insist on destroying what’s left of our family’s honour?” Lucius’ tone was light in pretend serenity, but the corner of his eye kept twitching restlessly.
“No, I - so how come you thought I was Neville just now?”
Draco, and somehow Harry felt that Draco had noticed it too. Not only that, but lately Harry had caught himself staring at him. Not to somehow figure him out like before, but just… out of the pure joy of looking at him.
“Hello, son.”
"Well, kind of. It's only worked once -  it was after the battle at Hogwarts, after I left with my family. We ran into some dementors that were still circling the area and I was the only one who knew the spell."
“Is that the face of regret I’m looking at?” Draco said when they heard the front door close in the first floor.
“I say," Skepperus said and started slowly turning away. “How to tell them apart…” He looked as if he had gotten lost inside his thoughts as he wandered to the front of the class.
Harry turned his gaze to the door just as Remus Lupin opened it.
Draco still couldn’t quite grasp how difficult it was to get anywhere on time despite finally having a fireplace connected to the Floo Network. Perhaps transportation was simply too easy that way; with commutes taking approximately ten seconds, one quickly began to assume that there was still time to have a cup of tea, to finish folding the laundry, to exchange a kiss or two, or otherwise…
“Stay safe,” Hermione said again. “I don’t know why, but I have a feeling you’ll be gone a while.”
“I got better after the war.”
“That it might be cursed somehow?”
This sparked a liquid fire to pool in Harry's abdomen and now unable to control himself with what he realized was Draco's erection pressing against him, he pushed Draco onto his back on the bed, mirroring the position they had started out in except now Draco's legs were on his either side from having previously straddled him.
“Oh, definitely not, not after I had to resort to some, well, alternative means to look like anything next to that git. I don’t know him, you say? Then explain to me why he hasn’t yet declined the offer. If he really planned to retire, he would’ve done that as soon as-”
"He mentioned it in his letter."
Harry now discovered that had been standing in the middle of his room for a while, fiddling mindlessly with a lock of hair that was just long enough for him to press it in between his lips. He wondered if anyone was home - he didn’t remember seeing anyone when he had walked in. He desperately wanted to talk to someone about - not necessarily about Draco in specific, but… Actually, yes, specifically about Draco, Harry realized as he sat down on his bed. But what was there to talk about? Well, besides the way, the way he was. What he was like, and how Harry hadn’t realized it before, and how Harry sometimes got this burning feeling in his chest whenever Draco did that thing where he, he didn’t chew on pencils like Harry did, but just kind of gently held the end of one between his teeth, or dragged it on his lower lip, before all of a sudden deciding on a word and continuing writing.
“Of course not," Harry said and pulled another chair closer so he could rest his feet on it. “I didn’t tell anyone," he continued. “Just like I promised.”
“But he’s not an Auror yet, is he? Besides, it’s not fair - you have no idea how the mirror affects someone like him. It’s
“A Muggle gets hurt," Harry corrected. “And then write down how we would heal him using Muggle techniques.”
“If only you still had that Time-Turner," Ron said. He raised his arm in an invitation, and Hermione scooted closer, cuddling up next to him so that Harry could barely see her face from behind her massive scarf.
Harry woke up to bits of dust falling on his face. He opened his eyes and saw the underneath of the staircase in 4 Privet Drive looming ominously above him. He carefully sat up, realizing he was too tall now to sit up straight in the cupboard. Harry reached for his glasses, only to soon realize he was already wearing them. Why did everything look so hazy?
And with that, she lets go and disapparates.
“Did you," Ron started, his ears and cheeks scarlet, “lose a bet or something?”
“Hmm… Yeah. You’re right.” Harry exaggeratedly looked at the ceiling, trying to appear contemplative. “Maybe you should ask
… A shame, really. If he had stayed in the motherland, he could have had potential." She deeply inhaled from her cigarette again, now in a considerably more cheerful mood.
“I was going to give you a two," Draco said.
“Good point”, Ron said, nodding. “Good point. Let’s, uh… Let’s just agree we’re happy for each other, yeah?”
“But I don’t want to be helped," Ron sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve. “I want to be good at something, Harry. You know how I feel when you guys have to help me pass every bloody class?”
Harry looked at him and felt his thoughts fall away. All that was left of them was a vague shape that spelled out "love", but Harry knew it wasn't time for that yet.
"Then you die. I don't even want to know how many people have lost their heads just to have this stolen off of them. That's why it took me a long time to decide what to do with it. I don't want people to die for this, thinking it will fix everything."
“You're seeing some bird?”
"What do you mean? What's with the questions?"
“What did you discuss?”
"You will do it here," grandmother Yana said, clutching to her cane, decorated with a beetle green crystal. She seemed to find the matter urgent. "I have owls ready to deliver the papers to the magistrates of Russia and Great Britain."
"Really? So that's why the car-"
“I should probably go catch up on work”, Draco said once they had finished eating.
“Wake up you prat," Draco snarled and watched as Potter jolted awake, eager to see his frightened expression as he’d realize Draco had his wand. But much to Draco’s disappointment, Potter just looked at him jadedly.
He then realized he was smiling at Malfoy.
“Look, I don’t like Malfoy, alright? But I’m still your mate, and since you’re not dating my sister, I thought, why not talk about it? Man to man.” Ron leaned back, clearly pleased in his effort.
"So you- and it worked?"
“Very much so.”
The words are like stabs to Narcissa's heart and she realizes Draco is unwavering. She recognizes that look in his face, because once it has stared right back at her from the mirror. This is it. Things will never be the same. Never. Not after this.
“Fair point.”
“He will,” Neville said instead. “It may take him a while, but he will. He’s too far gone now to let the fear win.”
"It was always him."
“You okay there, mate?”
The whole wedding had been a compromise, come to think of it. They had never wanted it to be a big deal in the first place, but after months of trying to find a potential empty weekend with Harry's impossible work schedule with no luck, they had decided (meaning Draco had suggested and Harry had apologetically agreed) to elope to Italy and get married quietly at an insignificant, poorly air-conditioned Magistrate office counter at a village that could have looked endearing, had it been featured in a rom-com. And so they had done, and of course Harry had promised to Draco with admirable eagerness that as soon as the aftermath of the Hackett case was dealt with, they would have a real party.
Professor Toadsworth gave a grin.
“When did you know you were into guys?” He asked.
“We can talk about that later when you feel better.”
"What, right now?" Draco said through a yawn.
“Can I hold you?” Draco asked. Harry stared back at him, trembling. He nodded, and Draco carefully moved closer and wrapped his arms around Harry.
Harry glanced at Malfoy again. It was strange to be the one answering questions instead of firing them at him.
“I need to talk to Hermione," Harry said.
“I can’t very well solve two cases at once," he said. "Besides, what's the point of assigning me with a new case when I'm supposed to retire any day now?"
Not really knowing why, Draco held out his hand, and Ron shook it.
Hermione let out a little laugh, that despite all of Harry’s inspection, didn’t look forced.
Draco raised a brow and Harry remembered what he had said about the constant apologizing.
“So I’ll just, have someone else try it then?”
"What are you doing?"
“See?” He said, placing it on the ground. Harry and Neville watched as it scampered around the rug in small circles, the basil plant it was holding swaying as if in excitement.
“You told him not to tell anyone, right?”
“That’s Luna for you," Harry said. “But I like her. She treats everyone the same. Even you and I.”
"It's best you don't mention my family unless you want someone to have to use
“Oh please," Hermione said, apparently having just fastened off another sock. “I’m waiting for a response from the Prophet.”
Hermione sighed.
Draco flinched and turned around. He hadn’t expected to see Granger standing there, just a few feet away from the tree. How the hell had she gotten so close without making any noise?
“Oh, sorry," Neville said, “I didn't know you were sleeping. We can talk another time.”
“Well, that, and also what happened before," Hermione said.
“Ron doesn’t have to hide
"Bloody chicken almost killed me. Give me that," Draco said and snatched his homework from Harry before he could read any further.
“It’s kind of a long story… I’ll borrow you some comics," Harry said and turned to look at the wall again.
"Let's go." Malfoy walked straight past Harry and he went after him.
"And now what? I call you Harry and we braid each other's hair? Fuck off."
