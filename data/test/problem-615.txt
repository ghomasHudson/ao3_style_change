Harry immediately sank down on the stool Draco had transfigured, the blond moving around him until he was situated at his back. “It’s going to feel cold,” he warned.
Before entering, he edited the man’s memory so that he wouldn’t be able to remember Draco’s face or his recognition of him at all before bringing him in to the Auror department where there were always people on duty.
Before either Harry or Ron could respond, however, Harry noticed a figure making its way to their table, their cape flowing gracefully behind them in a show that seemed almost practiced. “I don’t think that’s a problem we have to think too hard on.”
Harry knew he was going to regret this. He just knew. One day, which he supposed was today, his dumb Gryffindor mouth would open itself, like Earth would if it were to swallow him whole for the very reason of speaking, and he’d finally say something he would live to regret.
The first thing he noticed when they arrived was that it was awfully dim. Not dark to the point where he couldn’t see, but it was clear that the lights were spelled to be dimmer than usual.
“What was it called again?” Hermione asked, her eyes screwed shut while she snapped her fingers as she tried to recall the name of the school. “Mahoutokoro! I think.”
“Why?” Draco glared at him, finally sitting up. Harry grinned triumphantly and stood, extending his arm once more to offer help in pulling him out of bed. Once again, his hand was slapped away.
However, because he kept gagging, his throat began to convulse around Harry’s cock, making it harder for him to continue. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began gagging, thankfully not audibly, making him pull off to catch his breath.
Also, you might be thinking: Wow, Gi, are you trying to fit every known Wizarding school alive in this school? To which I say: Mind your own business JHDFJBDS no I'm kidding, I swear it's all important for Draco's character building so things make sense.
“Half-day,” Harry said again, watching as Draco’s eyes snapped open, before blurting, “And we go on a date in the afternoon.”
“Very well, then.” It was quite laughable how Robards was more disappointed in the fact that they were dating over them being late.
“Git,” Harry grinned, giving Draco a light shove. “Anyway, what if I said there was a way to make it more fun?”
“Children,” Hermione chided with a sigh. “Prefects are meeting in a few minutes and I would like to gather myself before then.”
Harry continued watching as he saw the man get even closer to the fallen figure, grabbing his arm and forcing him to his feet to shove him against the wall. Harry couldn’t make out any faces through the dark, but he could see their figures.
“Did I- You just grinded your arse on me in front of the entire Ministry and started a dance group called Harry and the Hogwarts House Elves.”
“You did?” Harry asked, evidently surprised. Draco didn’t know why; he figured that he was really supposed to prepare himself before they even started so that Harry wouldn’t have to wait.
The streets were crowded with what Harry assumed were Muggles. This was still the Muggle section of the city, he noted. He took a right and was momentarily blinded by the bright neon lights that filled the street, still crowded with people.
He already Floo called  Ron and Hemrione to update them on everything that happened and ask if he could stay there until Draco was finished. They were both worried about him, as expected, with Hermione’s light chiding and lecturing that she always warned him it was a bad idea.
“Why are you here anyway?” Harry realized. Draco didn’t like stepping into the Ministry if he could avoid it. “You didn’t come all this way to trade deals like that, did you?”
He’d noticed that, for some strange reason, the easiest way to wake him up was taking off the blanket. He figured that it was because of the temperature shift. Merlin knows Draco always likes to keep warm, wearing layers upon layers during cold seasons until he was both comfortably warm and reasonably soft looking.Not that Harry would ever tell him. He did value his life, after all.
“Alright,” Draco huffed once he managed to get himself into an acceptable position which was, unfortunately for Harry, having him practically pressed up against his back. “Watch.”
“I’d like to think using your grandfather’s hair potion would be pretty good branding as well,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at him. “You know considering it was made for your hair type and all.”
“Anyhow, I was going to tell you that you don’t have to distract Draco anymore,” Neville told him, and Harry froze on the spot, asking aloud why not. “Well, I figured out a plan and have an idea for our possible date.”
“I don’t mind,” Draco said after giving it much thought. “Just as long as I get a say in the renovations as well.”
“No,” Harry groaned, thunking his head on the table. “It’s just a game, though. No harm, I just need him to lose.”
“Goodbye,” Harry sighed, suddenly exhausted. “We’ll change the tire after dinner.” Not bothering to wait for the two, he started making his way back to the Burrow.
They were so close to one another that there wasn’t much else for Harry to look at and distract himself with besides Draco’s face, which wasn’t helping much. For a split second, his eyes darted towards Draco’s lips, which had gone slightly pale from the cold before deciding that it wasn’t such a good idea after all. His lips looked sinfully delicious and he just wanted to kiss them until they were swollen, red, and back to being warm.
“I arrived on time, then?” Harry asked, walking towards the kitchen once Draco stepped aside to let him in.
“I live in this area too,” Malfoy said, raising his eyebrow as if Harry were dim. “I’ve seen you walk by in the daytime.”
“Are you going to get dressed now or do I have to jump on you again?” Harry teased, hoping to diffuse the awkwardness that was slowly growing between them.
As if sensing Draco’s thoughts, Harry pulled off with a soft ‘pop’ before grabbing the abandoned lube on the bedside drawer, sitting back on his ankles.
“Tempting though that offer sounds, I really do think I should head out soon.” Draco got up, pulling the sheets off himself and placing his empty mug down, before stretching languidly. He started gathering his clothes, starting with his hat, and then went to search for his coat.
Harry hummed around his cock, sending vibrations through his body, dipping the tip of his tongue and sliding it through the slit on the head of his cock. Draco arched his neck, throwing his head back in pleasure. He both wanted to prolong this for as long as possible, and speed it up and have Harry fuck him already. He was pretty sure he was more likely to finish right that second, though.
He was promptly shushed by Malfoy’s wave of a hand. “Just give me a second to finish the process.” Then, while keeping his fist still closed, he pressed a finger to his chin for another 5 seconds, still keeping his head held high as if what he was doing was so spectacular.
“Pardon me for disagreeing,” Malfoy said dryly, getting up and brushing his robes off. “I feel like I need a long shower and a good shad, excuse my language,” he nodded his head to a flustered Hermione.
“Harry has a point, mate,” Seamus, one of the few remaining people in the common room joined in. “We did say until someone loses. But you can quit if you can’t handle it.”
“Alright, I will not bore you with any more announcements. Those can wait for the Opening Feast,” there was a collective but scattered groan from a few students, but the tone was light and joking. “For now, let’s enjoy ourselves.”
His former schoolmate was already there when he arrived, leaning against the wall where Harry found him initially, looking very unsure of himself, which made Harry frown. He was clutching two large muggle suitcases which surprised Harry since he wasn’t really expecting the man to have so much to bring, all things considered, but shrugged it off and offered to bring one himself.
“Yeah, essentially,” Neville smiled guiltily. “Since you know most of the people in our year because of the DA, I was hoping you could spread the word?”
“Why are you using terrible pick-up lines on me?” Draco asked wearily as they weaved their way through the crowds. “We’ve been married for 7 years now.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Of course. But he’s also very kind and charming. Many people get on with him well, and he’s gotten more exposure to things since he’s been joining these exchange programs since his fourth year.”
In a brief moment of bravery, he brought his face closer, searching for any signs of disgust or rejection. Instead, all he saw was Draco’s wide eyes searching him, somewhat anticipating whatever is about to come next. Figuring that was enough of an approval, he leaned in and pressed his lips against Draco’s cold ones.
“Why are we playing a game in a game?” Hermione asked faintly, though it didn’t seem to bother anyone else as it was quickly dismissed with a careless wave.
“Okay, love,” Draco eventually sighed, giving in to his partners antics. He gave Harry a quick peck on the lips, causing his ace to split into a wide, satisfied grin.
“Oh?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, but his eyes were slightly wider and the the light blush dusting his cheeks darkened a bit.
“And to think, I’ve been able to keep that little bit to myself with 6 years of dating,” Draco sighed dramatically.
“If you’d come down earlier with enough time for me to fix you up before classes start, then maybe I’d consider it,” Draco shot back. Harry wondered if he was being serious about that offer, then decided he’d take it even if it wasn’t actually being offered.
It wasn’t anything he’d felt when he was preparing himself for Harry in the shower just hours before.
“While the other founders might have seen how the acceptance of non-Pureblood children into the school would benefit them and their ideals, and they weren’t wrong with what they were able to achieve, Salazaar Slytherin must have been worried about the possibility of their school being exposed, making the entire community vulnerable,” he explained.
“The more we say the word, the less it begins to sound like a word,” Draco told his excitable boyfriend.
“I can’t wait until our honeymoon,” Draco murmured softly into his ear, too soft to be heard by anyone else. “But I guess it would be rude to leave our guests now.”
“Then stop saying it,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s hand and leading them towards one of the free tables.
“What’s wr-” Harry looked at him worriedly until Draco gave him a reassuring smile, cutting him off. He tried to remember what he saw from those videos he watched on the laptop Harry bought him before sliding down the length of his boyfriend’s body until his face was aligned with Harry’s crotch.
“What good will that do me,” Harry groaned. “He’ll be too busy keeping his conversation up with Neville anyway. They won’t even remember I’m there.”
Hesitantly, he reached his hand out and slowly stroked over the flank from base to tip before curling his fingers around the hardened member. As his hand went back down to the base of his cock, he pulled down the foreskin covering the head of his cock as he did so, exposing the sensitive head.
“Children, please settle down,” the Headmistress chided, earning herself an immediate reaction. It was almost hilarious how fast the Great Hall became silent.
“As much as I love our school,” Harry began in a soft voice. “What could they want to gain from coming here? I’m sure there would be more of a cultural exchange if they went to the schools in America.”
Harry noticed the absence of Draco’s presence next to him about 2 steps after and paused to look at him. “Go on.”
“Think you’re so brave do you?” Dean smirked at Malfoy with a glint in his eyes. The blond’s smirk faltered a bit but he kept his head held high, silently challenging Dean to carry on..
His two best friends’ eyes also turned to where Draco and Parkinson were seated, along with the other friend from Beauxbatons.
Ron paled a bit. “Hey, those ribbons are really neat, love. Would you like some help tying them around,” Ron said, quickly making his way to Hermione. “Such lovely silk you’ve chosen. Very refined-”
“It’s you, right?” Harry clarified, wanting to make sure even though he had a strong gut feeling that he already knew his answer.
There was no doubt he was attractive- that much Harry could tell even with his poor eyesight. He stood straight, posture emanating a somewhat regal vibe and yet somehow, that wasn’t the most striking part of him. No, it was that he looked somewhat familiar somehow.
Unable to help himself, Draco let out a small giggle, prompting Harry to look up at him with amusement shining in his eyes.
, the unsaid words hung heavily in the air and they both knew it, but Harry didn’t want to say it out loud.
“Me neither, Harry,” Hermione said, furrowing her eyebrows while her eyes remained on the man in blue. “But you’re not wrong, there is something strangely familiar about him.”
“Great,” Harry chirped, not letting that fact ruin his mood. He practically bounced over and plucked the beanie off the blond’s head, causing his hair to rise and go out of place.
“Maybe next time I’ll throw you in with the ferret,” Ron grumbled, plopping down on his seat once he handled his bags and helped Hermione with hers.
“Malfoy, wake up,” he said a little louder, this time shaking his shoulder violently, moving the blanket to uncover his head. He received a small shift in the sleeping man’s position for his efforts so that his head was facing Harry, but that was about it.
“I hate you,” Draco muttered, his eyelids fluttering shut. He could feel himself begin to feel drowsy as his head lolled into Harry’s chest.
He gave Harry a shy grin, which he was glad to return back, giving him a quick, chaste kiss before taking a step back and pulling Draco with him. He began waltzing messily, taking whatever steps he felt like while making sure to hold Draco close to him before getting tired and collapsing back onto the sofa.
“Hey, it doesn’t matter if you think it’s embarrassing, okay?” Harry reassured him, his hand moving towards his cheek. “This is supposed to be fun for both of us.”
“It’s no problem,” Harry said as nonchalantly as possible, wanting Draco to just look at him instead. “You’re doing most of the work, anyway. What with the planning and all.”
“And how much did it cost you?” He then decided to ask. It wasn’t like money was an issue for them but, well, for the sake of practicality. What would they even do with a car? Run people over in Diagon Alley?
“Oh,” Harry tried not to sound too disappointed once again. It was the first day of their final year. They still had a long way to go. “Goodnight, then. And good luck with the firsties.”
Harry swallowed thickly and decided that maybe he should join that mission to get shit faced as soon as possible.
“C’mon,” Draco sighed, smiling exasperatedly and taking Harry by the hand. Putting on a bit more show for the guests, he feigned resistance as Draco lead them past all of the tables to where Ron was watching them with amusement in his eyes.
Harry’s conversation with Bill suddenly flashed through his head. He was right. If he said yes, he’d be committed to Draco and he’d be stuck playing this stupid game forever.He couldn’t handle that. It hurts too much.
There were a few more that Harry couldn’t bother to remember, but Hermoine would most likely stop him if he was breaking a rule anyway. Trial and Error, or something.
“Good,” Draco said simply, laughing as he watched someone dance around in the Truth or Dare group. Harry didn’t even bother looking over, he was too entranced by the way Draco looked when he laughed freely like that.
And all went back to normal after that. The game continued, they still had occasional fights that their friends had gotten used to, albeit very few and only for a short while. Never over anything serious as well. Eventually, it was time for them to graduate.
“Mate, just go down there and offer to help them out,” Ron sighed, tired of watching Harry sulk as they rebuilt a pillar.
“Well if you like someone else, then you could have ended it earlier,” His tone was suddenly cold. He stood up and brushed off his trousers. “Nothing wrong with losing a bit.”
He watched as Draco grinned triumphantly before fluttering his eyes closed, long eyelashes resting against his high cheekbones. He looked so happy in that moment that Harry really wanted to kiss him.
“Alright, Potter, what do you want?” Draco asked, crossing his arms defensively once they were stood outside the classroom, away from the door.
“Silence, please! Do not worry, many of the new students who have joined us last year have already been sorted. Today, you will simply be meeting the first years, so do not worry yourselves about going hungry over an extended sorting,” Headmistress McGonagall sighed.
He tried to shake off the heavy feeling in his chest by taking the longer route to the Gryffindor dormitories and giving himself some time to think during the walk.
“He’s difficult to not like,”’ Neville said, his smile turning odd. “Wow, if someone told me I’d be saying that a few years ago, I would have sent them to a mind healer.”
“Surrounding yourselves with Slytherins, Hermione?” Ron asked, not even bothering to disguise his tone even though everyone in their small circle could hear them. Harry remained silent.
“Wouldn’t you rather ask something like what his wedding theme is gonna be since there’s no way either of them have any plans of losing Gay Chicken?” He takes it back. He has no friends, he is a lone wolf. Best mate named Ron? Don’t know him. Murder just became homicide.
“Adelis, Sofia!” The first name was called, and a brunette witch in the standard Beauxbatons uniform gilded her way up to the front. It took a few seconds longer than normal before announcing, “Gryffindor!”
Draco nodded, looking down. Harry felt horrible, even though he didn’t really do anything. He just wanted to kiss his frown away- okay no that’s pushing it.
“Malfoy?” Harry’s voice came out in a soft whisper and yet, despite the loud music blaring through the busy night street, Malfoy seems to have heard him perfectly.
“I don’t hate it that much,” Draco insisted. He really didn’t. Somehow, he seemed to appreciate most things when it came to Harry. Maybe he was being biased, but he didn’t really care. He was happy.
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “But there’s no class tomorrow, so how do you feel about doing it sometime between before and after lunch, depending on when I wake up?” Harry teased.
“Potter!” A voice screeched from down the hallway of the Manor. “Get your arse back here right this instant before I burn you and feed you to the peacocks.”
Harry nodded, understanding the implications of his statement. “I should probably go. I promised Hermione I’d put some effort into revising today.”
Instead, he nodded and grabbed Draco’s hand, entwining their fingers and placing a brief kiss on his hand.
“You’re wrong,” Draco stated plainly, and every head except that Zabini kid’s snapped to stare at him, looking with various degrees of confusion and, in Ron’s case, absurdity.
“Right,” Harry nodded, mentally noting those directions before bending down to hold up the stunned man. They both gave each other a nod and Harry, suddenly feeling more awake now, apparated to the entrance of the Ministry in what Hermione would most likely call a reckless decision.
Deciding to let the topic drop, Harry continued talking about a case, although his eyes carefully tracked every one of Draco’s movements, keeping an eye out for any more signs that something was wrong. He managed to make it through dinner without shifting too often in his seat, and they both eventually settled to get ready for bed.
Then, Harry switched over to the other side, leaving the spot wet and exposed to the cold air that brushed against him. It didn’t take long until his hand switched over, though, so he could repeat the same actions over his pinkened bud.
Sex. Sure, he was well aware of what they were doing, but he still wasn’t used to hearing the word out loud, more so say it himself.
“Oh, I didn’t see them when I was looking for a spare carriage.” And thank Merlin he didn’t, Harry thought smugly.
Unable to help himself, he let out a snort and padded his way closer to the bed before getting down on one knee to be at eye-level with the surface.
He sounded slightly disappointed, and Hermione smiled at him apologetically, shifting closer so that they were seated shoulder-to-shoulder. “I’m still going to make time for other things. I promised myself that I’d give more time to just enjoying the school year since it will be our last.”
“Potion for…..?” Harry trailed off. They had talked about a lot of potions, in his defense, because Draco had been helping him study for that subject in particular.
He forced himself to not put too much meaning behind this little detail he noticed, but that didn’t stop him from hoping.
“Whatever, you do what you like,” Ron rolled his eyes before getting up. “But I’m not going to force myself to be around him  just because you and ‘Mione are.”
“Him,” she repeated, just to be sure. “Aright, so what do you know? You’re being a bit strange about this, Harry.”
Added this l'il extra bit because I felt like it and didn't like how the other one ended. Hope y'all liked in anyway, tho <3
Harry sighed and got up. He wasn’t that hungry. He’ll probably just grab something by the kitchens later when he feels like it.
“Although I must admit I find the sequence of events quite skewed,” Draco continued, completely ignoring Harry’s reaction.
As for Harry’s crush, it only grew as he spent more time with the Ex-Slytherin. He got to know him better and understand him more. There were able to eventually open up to more serious and private subjects like the War or what Harry experienced at the Dursleys’, which resulted in a nice evening of cuddling.
“I-,” Harry started, unsure of what to say. On one hand, it was technically an assignment, and he did want his partner back. On the other hand, however, he wasn’t sure of how Draco would take his sudden appearance in his home.
“Do not think for a second that you aren’t having your hair tamed today because if it’s not today, then I am not Ginerva Weasley, Chaser of the Holyhead Harpies,” she exclaimed, pulling him by the ear and dragging him through the hallway and back to the room he was assigned to get ready in.
“No,” he shook his head. “It’s alright. I’ll just pull him aside before class so that if he decides he doesn’t want to talk to me after, it won’t be as awkward.”
It was just too bad that the next time his eyes opened, it was because Ron didn’t want to revise on his own with Hermione. Well, he normally did but that was only when revising meant having… study breaks in between, which meant Hermione was in the mood to get actual work done at the moment.
“Hey, Harry,” Draco mumbled, pausing a few meters before the entrance. “I wanted to ask you something.”
“I’d imagine you were too, when you got stuck,” Draco smirked. Another flush creeped its way up from his neck, but nothing could kill his good mood.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco gave him another smile, and Harry was vaguely aware of the students that were still training behind them, possibly listening in on their conversation. “Goodnight.”
They spent the entire night together, occasionally choosing to mingle with their friends or greet their other colleagues, but they didn’t leave each other’s side once that night. Draco even got Harry to dance with him for a few songs, despite Harry’s reluctance. They both ended up having fun anyway.
“What? Are you interested in dating the ponce? Is that it?” Ron asked. Harry felt like he should seriously talk to him about that. It reminded him a bit of when he had to break the locket in the forest, and what he saw. Yeah, he needed to get it through his head that Hermione’s dating him because she genuinely returns his feelings, and there’s no need to feel that way.
Or at least, that’s what he assumed. When he offered the place to Andromeda over the summer since it was her family home, she said she didn’t want it because she’s let go of that part of her life already, and it reminded her of everything she stood against. But when Harry said it was alright, and he’d probably try to fix it up so that Teddy could inherit it in the future, she quickly offered to help remodel it, saying something along the lines of
“I would just like to go over my final reminders so that you can leave in time for your first periods,” she sighed, sounding a bit weary, but also somewhat excited. The hall was absolutely buzzing, as it seems many of the students were excited for this exchange as well. “Their carriage will remain on school grounds to serve as their housing. Please do not try to get in unless explicitly given permission by one of the students with the knowledge of their designated teachers.”
Harry squinted his eyes through the darkness of the room until he managed to make out a fallen alarm clock that appeared to have been thrown against the wall, lying on the floor, partially hidden by a desk. He briefly wondered how long it’s been there.
“Grab a vinyl and put something on while I get Kreacher to make us more drinks, would you?” Harry asked, immediately feeling a bit awkward and letting go of his hands. Draco straightened himself up instantly, giving a quick nod and quickly walking back into the living room.
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry raised an eyebrow back, only to receive a snort in response and feel a hand grab his arm and drag him up and away from the Great Hall.
It stopped just about an inch in, and Draco could feel it resting inside him. He willed the channels of his arse to relax, allowing it to slide in deeper.
“Hardly boring,” Harry snorted, quickly dodging his head to the side as a block flew in their direction.
“Better bloody be amazed,” Draco grumbled under his breath. “Took me so bloody long to figure out the charm work on these.”
Much to the delight of Harry, Draco was pretty good at tutoring him as well. When he gave up because of Harry’s cluelessness, he’d practically do all the work for him, to Hermione’s disapproval and Ron’s envy.
If only the prat’s eyes didn’t practically shine with excitement as he spoke and his face didn’t light up the way it did, maybe it would have been easier to look away instead of openly stare for the world to see.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, jogging over. Except, as he neared the tired looking figure, their features began to become clearer, and as they became clearer, they began to look familiar.
Suddenly, he heard a crash in a narrow side alley and some screaming. He knew that he should have kept walking, that it was none of his business and that he should have ignored it, but something inside him was screaming to check it out.
Harry winced. “I hadn’t realized...” he said, feeling truly awful. Sure, he didn’t like Malfoy at the time of his trial, but it was supposed to give him a second chance. Instead, it felt more like he was robbed of that.
“Oh c’mon, Draco!,” Harry was having fun getting on his nerves. “You could at least pretend to enjoy being on a date with me, unless you’re planning on chickening out already.”
“Well, now you just look ridiculous,” Parkinson sighed, looking around wearily to check if anyone else was watching the spectacle that was Draco Malfoy.
“You earned yourself an extra half-hour, now get up,” Harry sighed. Since it was clear that Draco had no intentions of moving, he grasped his pale arm firmly and attempted to pull him out of bed, only to be fought with, admittedly weak, resistance.
“I am,” Harry confirmed, briefly wondering if he should stand. When Harry gave his answer, the other man frowned. Well, it wasn’t quite a frown, but Harry did notice his lip twitch downward considerably, eyes looking somewhat regretful now, which left Harry feeling very confused.
“Well,” Harry shrugged, biting back a smirk. “They said it was a prototype and they wanted me to test it out. It only has a minor problem of taking down what others say when they talk too loud as well, though.”
The only thing that managed to pull Harry out of his daze was the sharp sound of glass smashing against the tiled floor. He blinked, confused, before looking down to see spilled water and broken shards scatter around his feet, cursing to himself before casting a vanishing charm.
Despite his pain, Harry cracked a small smile at that. Until his words fully registered in his brain.
“I had to run after you after quickly explaining the situation to my mother, who smacked me on the head for you,” he said. “And then I had to bold up those stairs, why did we choose to have such a long stairway.”
“I had asked about that but the Headmistress said getting to know the different houses could help them decide better which house they might prefer or fit in better,” he heard Hermione’s voice explain vaguely in the background.
When the students were being dismissed to their common rooms, Harry got up when Hermione did and followed them out. Technically, he could probably get away with roaming around a bit before curfew, but he was knackered.
“Hmm? Yeah, I’m fine,” he responded hurriedly, feeling a light warmth on his cheeks. “Let’s go now.”
“Hey!” he laughed, catching it just in time. When he put it down, he realized that Draco was already falling back asleep. “What, am I supposed to hit you until you wake up?”
“Pureblood, Potter,” Draco muttered, reverting back to using Harry’s last name as a means of self-defense.  “We don’t talk about such… private matters.”
The sight of him made Draco turn red, but he couldn’t look away. Harry continued placing small licks over the area until all the come was gone, leaving Draco’s skin damp with his spit instead. After that, he continued trailing soft kisses down his skin until he stopped over the sensitive spot he was rubbing at earlier.
“Potter!” Draco yelped, the tone of his voice rising as he blinked the bleariness away. “Am I hallucinating?”
So now he has confirmation that the Slytherin Neville is planning to ask out is Draco, and he’s not quite sure what to do. Thinking back to his conversation with Hermione from breakfast, he concluded that he should just avoid interfering. By the sounds of it, Neville hasn’t asked him on the date yet, which means that there’s still a possibility that he’d say no.
He had to admit, somehow the white hair and beard suited him, although he much preferred when Harry was stubble-free and smooth because it felt nicer to tuck his face into his neck like that.
“Alright,” Neville said, nodding. “I’m going to meet Draco after his class ends and… tell him about our change of plans.”
“Nothing, I was just curious,” Harry lied. “I’ll probably go with Ron and Hermione if they don’t have a date planned yet.”
“Oh fuck,” Draco groaned, his hips bucking towards Harry’s mouth unintentionally. One hand came over and gave his cock an upward stroke before catching the foreskin between his thumb and forefinger, pulling it down with one stroke.
“Honestly, Ron,” Harry sighed, sounding frighteningly like Hermione. “Do you really want to avoid Hermione for months over this?”
“We would be fine if you would just drop the dis-” the whispering was drowned out by the flames roaring as the other students came through the Floo. “Next time, I promise.”
“Yes, you do that,” Headmistress McGonagall gave a slight smile. “Have fun, but do try to watch yourself around Mr. Malfoy. I know how embarrassing adolescent feelings can be,” and with that, she was retreating, leaving Harry to gape openly and wrap his head around what she said.
For the whole week, they spend their breaks with one another instead of going up and down the hallways to eat outside when there were “perfectly good tables to eat on here.” Except on this last day, Neville came up to where they were working and brought Draco lunch.
Running over to the center of the dance floor, he cast a quick sonorous charm. “May we please call the newly wedded husbands to the floor for their first dance?”
“Not exactly,” Harry snorted. “I’m pretty sure she was serious about the ignoring you part, though, so you might want to think of a
Harry let out a huff of laughter.”Then maybe you should be the one to fix me up every morning,” he said.
This surprised Harry. Of all the things that he was expecting to come out of his former rival’s mouth, this was not one of them. It just didn’t align with how he knew Draco saw himself when they were back in school.
“He seems to like America,” Harry commented, raising his eyebrows. “I’m surprised he chose to come here for his final year.”
“Mister Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy greeted him, along with a stern nod from Lucious before he looked away with a slight tilt in his nose.
As it were, the 8th Years were given privileges since they were older. For starters, they were given a later curfew. They were also granted access to the Restricted Section in the Library, given that they had special permission from a teacher because it was related to their studies.
Believe it or not, but the idea of eating his breakfast on those uncomfortable chairs in their office with the possibility of Robards barging in to assign them a new case was just not appealing to Harry.
“That was an awfully late reaction,” Draco said, furrowing his eyebrows while he stared at the spot where the glass hit the floor.  His eyes were still noticeably droopy, however, and he let the issue slide with a lazy shrug.
“Is that really your question, mate?” Ron asked, not really getting the point of the question. “That’s no fun,” Harry silently thanked his best mate for somehow diverting the attention away from him and possibly refraining from murder.
“Is this your first time taking part in an exchange program?” Hermione asked the man seated next to her. “I heard that Beauxbatons offers a lot of these types of things.”
“Lovers quarrel?” Dean asked dryly from the sofa next to them, trying to shield his ears from their shouting.
Harry observed him pull some people aside and have hushed conversations with them, though. It looked serious, so he decided against interrupting him.
He momentarily wondered if any of the neighbors could hear him and cursed silently, scanning the area before casting numerous unlocking charms on the door. It took a while, but he managed eventually, silently thanking Hermione for all the wisdom in the world.
“Exactly. That should be enough to last you,” Blase smirked, joining her in the doorway and opening it a bit more. Harry tried to get a better look, damning Blaise Zabini for being so tall.
He was just as, if not more, meticulous as Hermonie when it came to organizing, and he doesn’t know why he found it so endearing on Draco, but it was, unlike when Hermione did it sometimes. Whatever the reason, he was perfectly content to watch Draco flick his wand sharply while shelving the books quickly.
“Duly noted,” Harry mock saluted. Once he was dressed, they slowly made their way into the Great Hall for breakfast, which was right before the ceremony.
“Sure,” Harry agreed. If Draco was helping host, then he most definitely was planning on going, and he was going to make sure it was a success no matter what.
“Not wrong,” Ron snickered. “But I don’t know, maybe just alright to hang out with at least? I mean, if ‘Mione’s gonna be stuck with them for months, they’re most likely going to be with us, right?”
Draco began munching happily on the croissant, his partially sleepy, grey eyes occasionally flicking between his coffee, their surroundings, and Harry. Not that Harry was paying attention.
They made jokes, they teased one another, and they got to talk about how they were as kids. They discussed their previous professors, delicately avoiding any of the conflicting feelings they had about certain teachers like Moony and Snape. It wasn’t that they still held negative feelings against them, but they knew both of them were past that stage and would rather look forward and make up for their past instead of brooding on it.
He willed himself not to think of those things, however, because he was practically exposed like this, and he didn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable by a surprise hard-on.
Harry wanted to scream. Neville was waving him over from one of the hallways and Draco had begun pulling himself out of Harry’s space to look at his friend properly.
“Contextually, if we were to observe, Hogwarts was founded during the period where Christianity, I believe it was, had become prominent across the world,” he began, focusing his attention to her while only taking a brief second to spare a glance at everyone in the circle to see if they were listening before continuing.
He considered the satisfying possibility of burning the food and flaunting it but, really, eating it right in front of him would be so much more gratifying.
Ron let out a groan. “I know,” he grunted. “Not talking until our NEWTs doesn’t exactly scream healthy relationship, does it.”
“You can’t stay in bed for the entire day,” Harry said, raising an eyebrow at him even though he knew he couldn’t see his expression.
“Don’t you want to see if you’ll ever be happy if you were actually with him? If he gave you a chance,” the older man said. “You’re wasting your life away just hoping that it would become real one day.”
"I've always been able to before," Harry teased lightly with a small smile, refusing to admit that, yeah, he didn't think this through at all. "Please? Just think about it."
Even though he knew he was wrong, though, and blamed his teammates, his persistence was the only thing that could rival his competitiveness.
“Well, no. But I will consider it,” he replied. “I was thinking along the lines of coming with me as my plus one?” he said hopefully.
“This way,” the Slytherin instructed him, not even sparing a glance around the room. There were a few curious stares but other than that, nobody seemed to mind his presence there. It was no secret that it had become more common to allow members of other houses into their dorms, provided that they were let in by one of the hosting house members.
Harry became acutely aware of how warm it felt to have his chest pressed against Draco’s back and the soft, clean scent that tickled his nose, causing him to abruptly let go of the blond in mild panic.
“He looks like a bloody ferret, alright?” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “Now what’s the deal? I thought we were going to avoid him and Hermione?”
“Well, not really,” Draco rubbed at his nape. “We were thinking of having a feast together at the Great Hall with the professors and the younger students, since they can’t drink yet, then move over to the Longbottom Manor. Neville’s aunt said she wouldn’t mind.”
“I’m sure that won’t be necessary,” Draco chuckled, some tension releasing from his body. “Really, though, I should start getting ready.”
“Oh hell, he’s sulking again,” Ron wailed, marching his way over to Harry’s bed and shaking him violently. “Stop it, mate. I can see you slumping.”
“We ought to buy those sold in potion vials, I suppose,” Harry grinned before settling himself between Draco’s legs. And then, once Draco managed to quell his giggles, “Could you hold your knees for me? Just so I’d have better access.”
Draco knew his moans were getting louder, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Harry seemed to enjoy his reaction, anyhow.
He bolted his way back up the stairs, leaving Harry to leave, resigned, and take a seat next to his best friend, who already had her head bent over one of their textbooks.
“His mother missed him,” Hermione nodded, seeming to agree with his thoughts despite the fact that he didn’t actually voice them out. “She wanted him here while his father wanted him in Durmstrang, so Beauxbatons was the compromise since they have properties there.”
Harry wasn’t sure of what else to say after that, because he wouldn’t know. For all he knew, Malfoy could be wrong. But he could also be correct. All that Harry knew was that he didn’t want to leave Malfoy like this, and he wanted to help him somehow.
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” He sighed, but he was grinning, excited at the idea of seeing Draco again.
“I haven’t even lived yet!” Seamus wailed dramatically. “I haven’t dated and I’m going to die from these classes before I do.”
“Draco,” he murmured, resting his hand lightly over the relative area of his arm. He began shaking him lightly but, as usual, there was no response. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head as a devious smile slowly creeped onto his face, and he decided he might as well give in to his childish impulse.
“Draco,” he groaned tiredly, draping his upper half over Draco’s torso. Still, the man didn’t get up. He simply adjusted his posture so that he could sleep comfortably under Harry’s weight.
“Don’t take too bloody long,” Harry yelled through the hall before adding that he’d be waiting in the kitchen and busied himself by searching for a glass of water. The kitchen was, unsurprisingly, organized, and yet Harry had no idea how to locate the glasses.
He saw the man who was being pinned tense, yet also slump as if accepting the inevitable. The short, stout man that was pinning the worker against the wall began moving his hands all over the trapped body, and Harry felt his gut twist. Harry heard him snap, "Now bend over," and that's when he knew he had to do something quick.
“You’d be here,” Draco said, rolling over onto his back before giving Harry a - devastating, if he may say so himself - smirk. “I’m sure we could think of something to do.”
Harry gave his friends what he was hoping looked like a reassuring smile before nodding. “It’s fine. I’ve never had a problem with besting Ma-Draco before,” he shrugged.
“Of course I will,” Harry rolled his eyes, making Hermione raise an eyebrow at him. “I swear!” he raised his hands in mock defense.
Harry contemplated how he should try to wake Draco up this time. He’s yet to resort to using a bucket of water, if only because he knew that the blond would probably make him clean it up, thereby making them more late.
“Well, yeah,” Harry shrugged. “But I figured having a rat’s nest on my head was pretty solid branding.”
“Harry, fuck,” Draco gasped. Harry repeated the action, his finger now massaging the tense muscle of his arse until it softened when Draco relaxed.
He couldn’t imagine how Draco might have turned out if he went to Durmstrang, but it made sense that Lucius would want him there.
“No!” Harry shouted from his place among the tables, earning his a smack on the head from Draco and a laugh from the rest of their guests.
Unbothered by their comments, Harry ventured onwards. “See, you must be a magician, because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears.”
“I’m sure Harry and Draco would’ve found their way to each other eventually anyway,” Hermione said, for which Harry was grateful he had at least one person that made sense in the room. Well, technically Fleur counts, he supposed, but she was still trying to fix his hair, so probably not.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t ask questions, which was good because he wasn’t sure if he knew the answers himself.
“Thanks for letting us be here, mister,” He said, holding out his hand. “We don’t get to enjoy things like this often.”
“You’re planning is impeccable, as always,” For some strange reason, he just felt the need to validate his boyfriend more than he already was by the guests compliments. Like he needed to show him how much he really appreciated it, because Harry would sure as hell be lost without him.
“Sometimes. When we get tired after tending to the greenhouse, for example, or when Potions is our last period and he’d rather stay here instead of go all the way to the library or something since I have a sufficient amount of books,” Draco responded absentmindedly. “Aha!”
“That’s not the point!” Ron exploded once they were in the hallway. “We were tortured in his bloody house! His father is a
“Well, what else was to be expected of the founder of Ravenclaw,” Draco huffed, but Harry could see him give a pleased flush at the compliment. “Well, I believe this is where we part,” the Head Boy gave him a small smile.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to find a free seat next to Draco, not that he’d really want to since he and Hermione were seated right up front, which left him to sit next to Dean. Ron was still glaring holes by the time he walked in, but he pointedly ignored it.
“I have,” Harry nodded, agreeing. He was beginning to wonder why Neville wasn’t just getting on with it, but it could have been that he was plotting his long, painful death. Either way, Harry braced himself for when his friend opened his mouth again.
He winced a bit as he felt the skin around his hole cling onto his fingers, the area slightly burning from the stretch. In all fairness to himself, he’s never touched himself this way before, so he figured that it was likely to hurt. Still, he persevered, willing himself to relax further until it was slightly easier to thrust both fingers into himself.
“Well, generally people would prefer to get nakes for sex, from my experience,” Harry smirked lightly, quirking an eyebrow at him. When Draco lightly slapped his chest, he chuckled to himself and reached behind Draco to throw the sheets over his shoulder. Immediately, warmth covered his body as he held it tighter across his body.
“You’re wrong about that, mate,” Ron sighed, leaning against Harry’s door frame. “Just give it up and get dressed. Besides, you were all for this party when Malfoy suggested it.”
“Jealous I’m taking your job, are you?” Harry retorted. “Maybe it’s you rubbing off on me.” That earned him a shove, although a light and playful one.
“The only time I’ve driven a car was when we hijacked my dad’s back when we were at Hogwarts, though.”
“I think I’m starting to regret it already,” Harry said faintly, keeping his eyes focused on the ceiling above them. He felt the bed dip as Draco moved to adjust himself.
“What, were you expecting that we have larger beds and a sitting room?” Draco snorted once Harry voiced his thoughts. “No, the founders of the school wanted to make sure that this was equal for most all students. The only difference is whether or not you want to customize it a bit, like my bed sheets.”
“What does it do?” Pansy Parkinson asked, only looking mildly interested in what her friend has to say. Harry, on the other hand, was trying not to eavesdrop on their conversation and keep track of what Ron and Hermione were talking about.
Harry laid in Draco’s bed, giving himself a couple more seconds to fully wake up, before rolling onto his side and, to no one’s surprise, his boyfriend was still peacefully asleep.
, Harry thought, biting back a snort. This man seated across from them might have been sorted into Ravenclaw, but he’s the type to surround himself with Slytherins. Manipulative, callous, and the tendency to use others. Resourceful. Everyone knew they were the kind that only worked for themselves.
“Er, kinda?” It took everything in Harry to not laugh at how awkward the blond looked, unsure of how to talk to kids.
“I like you, you idiot!” Harry blurted. “It was never really just a game for me, okay?” and with that, he bolted away from Draco, making his way to the entrance of the Manor before Disapparating back to Grimmauld Place. Their home.
“Fuck, you’re so sensitive,” Harry groaned, relieving some tension off himself by rubbing his cock against Draco’s stomach. “You want to come already?”
Draco immediately began bobbing his head up and down once he was sure he wouldn’t gag, this time trying to go all the way down to the base and take all of Harry like how he had seen in those Muggle videos. Even as the head of his cock hit the back of his throat, making him gag around the hardened length, he made himself keep going.
On the bright side, he’d get to spend more time with Draco this way. At least he could try to figure out whether what he felt during the night of the party was just on him or if it was mutual.
“Shut up,” she growled, roughly tugging at his hair harshly in attempts to get it to cooperate and get into place, causing him to yelp. “Just a little more…”
Or at least, it was. Harry finally got the chance to talk to Draco alone more. He felt like they were finally getting closer at that point, and not because they were being put together in the same group. No, this was Draco genuinely enjoying having a conversation with him, and just the thought of Draco liking Harry’s presence was enough to cause a giddy, fluttering feeling to wash through him.
Another thing that heavily amused him while they were fixing up was how he tried to disguise how thoughtful he was when it came to every detail. For example, he created a platform for Professor Flitwick to stand on when lecturing.
“Great,” Neville exhaled, giving him an easy smile, and now Harry was confused. “You’re the only one I’d trust to leave Draco with for company for a long time. I don’t think the others would fancy being in your place as much.”
“Ladies, ladies,” Seamus interrupted, striding over to where the loud whispering was coming from like he owned the place. “We can all hear you,” he announced.
“We’re heading in early!” Draco called out to whichever staff or friend helping could hear them. “Let’s go. We should be rested for tomorrow.”
, Potter.” And he had the right to brag, Harry supposed, especially since one of the dares he competed consisted of Owling his mother a letter written by everyone else, no limits. And Harry knew it was bad since he contributed, writing to make it look like Malfoy found Firenze attractive and if she knew anything about Human x Centaur relationships.
“I’ll be in charge of gathering the Slytherins,” Draco stated before straightening himself. “But for now, I must get going. My mother is expecting me for supper.”
“You didn’t get hurt, right?” Harry asked, turning to face him, and Draco felt his heart swell with affection for his caring boyfriend.
, Harry thought. At least he knew that it would be safe to use his wand in any case, but that also meant that whoever that was lying on the ground was a wizard who worked as a Muggle prostitute.
“Potter,” Robards said, a mildly threatening tone in his voice. “If you don’t start getting him to work, the department might start enforcing disciplinary action. I’ve been trying to prevent it since you’re one of my best teams, but I can’t hold them off forever.”
He got dressed slowly but finished just in time for them to make the trip to Hogwarts while being considered late, but still slightly acceptable. The Hall was already filled with students and parents who had helped out with the rebuilding, but they managed to spot their friends easily. It was hard to miss a large group of 8th Years boisterously laughing on one side of the room.
Gingerly, Draco did as requested. He tried not to think too hard on the fact that this meant he was spreading himself wide open, not only for Harry to touch, but see as well. He was going to have everything exposed and on display for his boyfriend, and that was enough to remind him of his initial embarrassment.
Once it was hovering just over his head, he began ruffling the soft strands of blond hair roughly until his arm was practically thrown back at him.
As Harry absorbed what the blond just said, along with the entire situation, laughter bubbled out of him. It started as a small chuckle but eventually broke out into hysterical laughter.
Harry heard one of his friends, he wasn’t sure who at that point, but one of them took in a sharp breath.
“I know you’ve had other partners before,” he continued, disregarding Harry’s question. “And I don’t really have the experience you do, but I’m not incompetent. I’m not.”
“Don’t think too hard on it, love,” Draco waved his other hand in the air. “Mother is in a lovely mood. She’s excited for the children.”
“You might,” the exchange student said, shifting uneasily. “I’m sorry, and I’d really appreciate it if you’d listen to what I have to say first before anything else, but I am sorry.”
Harry turned his head to look at his friends, all of them trading silent glances and conversing with one another through their eyes before finally turning back to the man who remained standing, eyes clasped behind his back.
After the war, Draco had done everything he could to apologize and make it up to anyone he had hurt during the war. Harry, like most others, were very weary when they accepted this fact and tried to accommodate Draco’s new behavior, but eventually realized that he really was trying. For a start, he rarely said no when people asked him for favors, no matter how much he clearly disliked the task.
Harry was still disappointed, but he figured he could get Ron to come around eventually. For now, at least he wasn’t mad at Harry, and that would do for the meantime.
“Because your ferret is busy with Neville and you want to prove to everyone that you became an Auror on your own merits?” Ron guessed sarcastically, dragging him down the stairs.
“Okay, no,” Draco batted his head, stepping away from him and Harry pouted. “If you get any drool on me from last night, I will spit on you.”
“You know what’s on the menu? Me ’n’ you,” this time, Harry was greeted with not just one, but a crowd of groans coming from Draco and their 4 children.
“Thanks,” Harry let out a breath he had unconsciously been holding. “And honestly, I feel like we can trust Draco. You should at least give him a chance.”
“You can’t reject me,” the short man grunted, taking a threatening step towards whoever that was on the ground. “I’m paying you. If only the wizarding world could see how you’ve fallen from grace.”
Hermione, on the other hand… well, she wasn’t looking as excited as she was before, to say the least.
Harry opened his mouth to respond but was instantly cut off by Draco holding his arm out to stop the students who were following them from walking. “Hold on, the stairs are moving,” he informed them, then proceeded to give them a quick lecture about safety and the moving stairs in general.
we’re expected to be in the office in about five minutes,” Harry repeated a little louder. This seemed to finally get the other man’s attention, because his head snapped up to look at him with wide eyes.
“Of course it is!” Harry exclaimed, pulling his arm away and feigning an affronted look. “It’s all about the pazazz.”
And to further the nightmare that was unfolding before him, Harry began dancing. He swayed his hips in time with the music and danced around the house elves who were wearing little elf hats and costumes.
“You’re fault,” Draco grumbled almost incomprehensibly. He pulled the blanket over his head again and tried to fall back asleep. Business as per usual, Harry rolled his eyes.
“I’m sure I could make it up to you,” Harry said as casually as possible with a small smirk, trying to mentally pull himself together. If he was reading the signs right, he might as well make the most of it. He could feel his heart begin to pound loudly in his chest but kept his eyes trained on the blond in front of him.
He knew Draco’s address thanks to the few times they worked over time and went over cases there. He always did say that he couldn’t trust Harry with having the right tea and biscuits. However, he still felt a bit uncomfortable with the idea of casually showing up.
“We will be handing in a file for the re-assignment of partners,” Draco said dutifully with a small nod. Harry’s head snapped to look towards him, but Draco just gave him a look that said
“Why does that bloke over there on the far end look familiar?” Harry asked his friends, voicing out his thoughts. They immediately paused their conversation and darted their eyes over to where he was looking.
He brought his eyes higher, only to be met once again with Draco’s silvery pair staring back at him. This time, his face was bright red, and Harry was sure it wasn’t from the cold.
“Why?” Harry asked, feeling bewildered. Most schools started their first years similarly to Hogwarts; at the age of 11. It wasn’t even required to attend a wizarding primary, just as long as they got some sort of basic education.
After that, he practically scoffed down his breakfast- but in the most graceful and unobvious manner- and left the Hall as soon as he could, and Harry couldn’t wipe the grin off his face, much to the worried glances of both Ron and Hermione.
“Of course, Malfoy,” Hermione said kindly. “We understand that your father’s actions are not your own. As long as you really don’t share the same, uh…
Once it was fully sheathed until his knuckle was pressed against him, he began thrusting his finger in and out, slow and careful like he said he would. With the amount of lube he used to coat his finger, and the extent Harry went to to help Draco relax, he hardly felt the stretch of his rim around the finger.
Somehow, hearing her insights on the situation was both helpful and not at the same time. She was right when she said that in the end, Draco would be the one who either rejects them or not, and Harry felt like he had a decent shot with him if he was basing this off the party, but at the same time he wasn’t sure about his chances when he and Neville have grown so close.
Draco, who had been fumbling with the potion, nearly dropped the glass vial when he saw Harry. “Where is your shirt?” he asked, his voice sounding odd.
“I’m sure it was,” she scoffed, ignoring his second comment. Somehow she, along with the rest of their friends, had come to the conclusion that they had done something other than kiss and cuddle for a bit before coming to their party.
, Harry allowed himself a private smile as they made their way to the next table to have a chat with their guests.
“Wicked!” The kid cheered. Everyone else seems to have began searching, but Shawn seemed more interested in talking to the out-of-place pair. “Hey, you own this house, right?” he was facing Draco.
“Yes, but then why didn’t he ask him out before the school year started, then?” she pondered, coming to the same realization he did last night. “It doesn’t really make sense, waiting until the school year starts when they could have spent more time together over the break.”
“Why?” Draco suddenly looked suspicious, as if Harry might have a secret motif for wanting him away from any possible witnesses to their conversation. Yeah, in hindsight, it did sound awfully sketchy.
“I love you too,” It wasn’t something they said often, outside of their own bedroom at least. Normally it was reserved for when they were alone, or when things go wrong in the Auror department and Harry ends up in St. Mungo’s.
“I went to bed early. The rest of them stayed up late talking,” he explained, rubbing the back of his neck. They began walking side by side to the Great Hall with their things, the pile in her arms significantly more for some reason, but knowing her it was probably academic.
“It was?” Harry let out an embarrassing squeak. Oh Merlin, he hoped that Draco didn’t notice- that is, if he really did at least.
“Uh..” Both Draco and Hermione gave him a funny look, and he realized that now that they’re friends, they’re going to make one hell of a duo. He was already dreading any possible study sessions those two might try to hold for their NEWTs. “Everything?”
The Slytherins’ heads snapped towards him just to make sure he was really talking to them. The got on well enough, he supposed. There was less hostility between the houses now and sometimes they engaged in polite conversation during classes and in the common room, but they weren’t exactly friends, no matter what the occasional parties they have in the 8th year common room might imply.
“Draco!” Harry blurted, spinning around quickly. He didn’t need more indicators than a sign to recognize his boyfriend. “And what compensation do you suggest?”
“Hey, do you mind if I sit here?” he asked, smiling sheepishly. “Draco said he was going to sit with the other Slytherins because he hasn’t spoken to them enough over the break and I can’t seem to find our other classmates.”
Even though he still wasn’t awake yet, Harry paused. Draco was, for the lack of an appropriate term, beautiful when he slept.
He snatched the towel from Harry’s clutches before reaching up to pat the towel firmly against his head, scrunching his hair through the thick material. “If you do it like that, your hair could become frizzy, and it damages your hair if you do it too hard.”
Eventually, once Draco had loosened considerably, Harry began prodding a second finger alongside the first one, wriggling it against his entrance until it slipped in as well. This time, he could feel a mild discomfort from the wider stretch, making him contract around Harry fractionally.
“Hey!” Harry whinged, but he was grinning. Really, he was just glad Hermione found someone who could keep up with her. “No wonder you get along.”
This went on for a few more minutes, a bit longer than expected and very close to what could be considered suspicious, before Draco grabbed his discarded shirt and tossed it back to him. “C’mon, it should be dry enough to try and style for now. You’ll have to do this part every day on your own, though, so do try to pay attention this time.”
“Totally unrelated, but okay,” Harry complied, spelling his hair back to its original dark colour then proceed to turn his Santa costume into a formal set of Wizarding robes.
“Hey,” Harry breathed, suddenly realizing how close their faces were. He was practically lying on top of Draco, whose eyes snapped open to stare into his own green ones. Silently, he was thankful that there was no light filling the room, or he’s pretty sure his flustered expression would have given him away.
“I barely even know the guy,” Harry reasoned. “I just find him objectively attractive. It doesn’t mean I want to date him. And we don’t even know if he’s into blokes.”
“Don’t what, Draco?” Harry asked him softly. He was surprised that they were still talking since he half-expected Harry to just get up and leave in disappointment.
“Alright!” the sound of McGonagall’s voice suddenly boomed through the halls. “I can tell you’re all starting to get antsy, so let the feast begin!!”
“Right, yeah,” Harry nodded quickly, unsure of what he was agreeing to exactly. “I was just thinking, you know, since the Slytherins and I didn’t exactly get along before…”
“Fine,” Draco gave in, handing him the handle of one of his bags and using his free arm to hold onto Harry’s.
Then he began rolling it between his fingers, tugging lightly every few seconds, enjoying the way Draco mewled into his lips before squeezing them with a tug then letting the skin go.
“I don’t want him to think that I’m incompetent in… matters of the bedroom.” he muttered. “What if I’m not as good as his past partners?”
“You’re talking a lot about the founder, but you didn’t justify anything about the people that come from the house,” Ron pointed out. “It doesn’t change the fact that the people that are sorted Slytherin share their Pureblood nonsense and think they’re better than everyone, and the fact that most all dark wizards in our History have come from that house.”
“I know,” Draco sighed, still cupping his mix of Firewhiskey and hot chocolate in his hands. He was wrapped comfortably on the couch with heavy blankets because, despite the heating charms, he was freezing. “Whatever prompted her to fancy an outdoor party in the winter. I’d say she’s gone barmy, but I think we already knew that.”
“Just a few words and you already can’t string together a proper sentence,” Harry chuckled deeply. He could feel him slide in a third finger, stretching his entrance even wider. This time, he could feel a bit more stinging as he was stretched wider, but it felt much better than when he did it to himself.
“And about the fun thing. I guess you’re right,” Draco sighed, moving away from Harry and pulling them down to one of the seats. “I guess I’m just nervous. Besides, can you blame me. 3 years of playing a game and 3 years of finally being serious, I guess I’m just glad we’re finally getting married and I want this to be perfect.”
“Merlin, your hands are freezing,” Harry remarked, grabbing the offending pale hand that had assaulted him moments ago. He enclosed them in his slightly larger pair of hands before realizing what he was doing and looked up, greeted by the sight of a pink-tinged Draco Malfoy.
“All volunteers please stay back once everyone leaves for their first period. You will be excused from your classes for the rest of the day while I give you further instructions regarding your responsibilities as well as what to expect,” McGonagall concluded. “That’s all, now you may leave.”
They didn’t comment on when Harry began helping Draco review for his tests despite not understanding a lick of what he was reading. Draco never pointed out how they settled into their own routine of dividing chores their chores and going out to restock their pantry.
“And what’s wrong with them being in Slytherin?” Harry asked, feeling irrationally defensive over the house. Or it could be Draco, but that was beyond the point. However, Neville was close with Draco, so it didn’t quite make sense why it would be a problem.
He gave the bushy-haired girl a half-hearted glare. “Don’t,” he said. “Just don’t. I don’t want to get my hopes up over nothing, and the thing is I can’t even blame him for saying yes.”
“They’re both aged at 46, if you’d like to adopt them, ma’am,” Scorpius replied with a false tone of courtesy.
“Remind him it’s Gin’s birthday,” Ron insisted. “They have some weird friendship, maybe he’ll agree.”
“Other… things?” Draco asked, confused. His eyebrows drew together when he looked up at Harry’ who was only smiling bemusedly at him, just the slightest hint of mischief in his eyes.
“Already?” Harry panicked, not really wanting to dive into a case without his partner. And if this was another high profile case, there was no way in hell he had any plans of doing it without Draco. “But Draco hasn’t come in yet.”
Harry suddenly realized that Neville actually gave the name of the person he was planning to ask out, and this gave him a sick feeling in his stomach but he chose to ignore it. So far he said that this person was a he, and he was in Slytherin. And that they got closer over the summer.
catching himself on his feet at the last second so that he wouldn’t faceplant on the ground. For someone so sluggish in the morning, he was surprisingly agile.
If Harry stopped now, Draco thought he might never want to go again. That, and he didn’t think his nerves could handle preparing himself for the first time all over again.
“What the fuck were you thinking?” Hermione demanded, causing both Ron and Harry to flinch. She never swore at them before. “You best hope I manage to fix this because if he leaves the program, you will be sorry.”
“I know,” Draco said, looking him in the eye seriously. “We’ve already told each other that, and it will never have been just a game between us. I love you.”
“Ouch, you brute,” Draco grumbled, glowering at the floor. He didn’t even notice Harry step away and try to deal with his internal crisis as he continued glaring at the floor, his lithe frame swaying a bit as if he could topple over at any second.
“Then why did you say you were only proposing because of the game?” Harry asked, somewhat confudled.
It took a while, and Harry would admit that he dozed off for most of the Sortings of the other years, but it wasn’t as long as the regular sortings they had at the beginning of each school year. Eventually, they reached the 8th Years, and Harry perked up considerably.
“I would,” Harry defended his husband. He knew it was light banter, though. Draco and Ron have been getting on even better recently, playing chess and drunken darts at pubs together. They even share their odd relationship with Celestina Warbeck, where they hate her music but will not hesitate to break into song at any and every pub.
“I had no doubt that you would,” Harry reassured him. “I meant that you’d have to come with me to the Burrow for Ginny’s birthday.”
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “It doesn’t matter to me if you’ve never been with anyone before. I just didn’t expect it, is all.”
“They look a bit awkward, don’t they?” Hermione pointed out, raising an eyebrow when she turned back to look at them.
“How interesting,” McGonagall’s muffled voice sounded from the front of the room, but Harry paid them no attention. He was busy trying to distract himself from the way Draco smelled as he reached over Harry to grab the tea pot.
“Presumptuous much?” Draco rolled his eyes before returning to the task at hand, which was surveying the crowds and looking for Harry.
He should probably say no, he thought. Ron would kill him, but the bright excitement shining in Draco’s eyes got the better of him and well, he could never say no to Draco. Not anymore, at least.
“Yes, fine, bring if you must,” Hermione sighed, not that excited at the prospect of creating drunken teenagers in the party. Activity. Whatever. “It will get them to loosen up a bit, but this isn’t a party so pace yourselves.”
“Still cold?” Harry asked, knowing that he was about to push into risky territory. He sat himself down next to Draco and pulled the blankets over both of them, pressing his side into the other man’s, who had tensed slightly. Harry then grabbed his hands again and rubbed on them a bit, hoping to create more heat.
Dean shouted “come in,” and a shock of blond hair peeped through the open doorway.  “The elves told me they made Roast and Treacle for dinner. Thought you ought to know before it runs out.”
Suddenly, the tip of his tongue peeked through his lips, licking over the sensitive bud. Draco arched his back, leaning into the sensation, but Harry had other things in mind. He sucked over the sensitive skin, his tongue lapping over it again, before grazing his teeth against it.
“I’m sorry, were we hurting your delicate Gryffindor sensibilities,” Malfoy smirked, looking not at all apologetic. Beside him, Zabini snorted and looked up in his direction with a raised eyebrow.
Harry gaped as he processed his boss’ words. “You want me to break into his house?” Harry clarified unsurely.
“Look, I have to wake up early to make it to the meeting place on time, but be free to join us tomorrow,” she said, getting up. “I’ll tell him you’re all good so he won’t be skittish around you.”
“Of course, love,” Draco gave him the biggest, most smug, smirk before turing to face the game. They remained unbothered for most of if, opting for truths instead. In Harry’s case, he just couldn’t be arsed to get out of the surprisingly comfortable position. For someone with cold hands, Malfoy was  surprisingly warm.
He ended up lounging around in the common room with a book after dinner, trying to catch up on one of his missed homeworks when he heard Ron and Hermione arguing nearby. He hadn’t even heard when the bushy-haired girl came in, so he sat up immediately to see if he should intervene.
“We still don’t know for sure that it’s him he was talking about,” Hermione said unhelpfully, before sighing at his pointed look. “And there’s nothing wrong with being just friends with Draco and seeing where it goes from there. You don’t need to ask him out instantly, and Draco can make his decision when he feels like it. If Neville suddenly asks him out, then you’ll know your answer at least. You’ll only be a bad friend if you purposely try to sabotage Neville, if that’s who he’s planning on asking out.”
“Fine,” Harry raised his hands defensively. “I’m just saying that- all things considered- you could be very wrong.”
“Oh lovely, age isn’t catching up to you yet.” Draco huffed, but he was still grinning excitedly. “Yes. A lovely car with all the scary noises included.”
Harry chuckled a bit, creating small vibrations which prompted Draco to ask him to be still while he took a nap. Being a bit late while being cuddled up to his new boyfriend, he could do. He summoned Kreacher, asking for another drink- nevermind that it was his 3rd that afternoon- and wrapped his arms around the blond that had fallen asleep on him.
“Hey,” he whispered as he stood up. “Hermione mentioned just some bits of what happened earlier, but I think you guys should stop antagonizing all of the exchange students before McGonagall finds out.”
“Why are you being odd?” Draco asked him. Harry flushed again, regretting letting himself be so transparent.
A sudden light of realization flickered in her eyes and she began looking at him with pity. “And you think the bloke he’s planning on asking out is Draco, right?” she surmised, and he could only nod sullenly. “Oh Harry,” she sighed. “It could be another Slytherin, for all you know. I mean, technically he’d have only just gotten to know all of the Slytherins over the summer.”
Despite his discomfort, he began searching around. First he checked the kitchen, only to find that it was still clean and unused. He left the cup of coffee there and placed it under a stasis spell before searching the bathroom, which was also empty and, upon closer inspection, the shower was dry, meaning he hasn’t even gotten up to shower yet.
He was clutching his elbow and muttering to himself, swaying slightly as he walked - not unlike a drunk person - and sat himself down on one of the kitchen chairs, dropping his head in his arms.
“Ah, but I was merely stating them by the order of how you prioritize them,” Ron smirked teasingly. “By the way, you hang out with him too much. Starting to talk the same.”
“What?” Harry asked dumbly, his mind taking a moment to catch up to the fact that she was listening in and trying to connect that to their conversation.
“Be quiet,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but his friends reactions did nothing to extinguish the excitement from his face. “It’s almost done.”
The students performed another set of fancy charmwork to entertain the students as they passed, smiling at the rows of tables until they reached the front where they stood in 3 neat rows.
“Well,” Draco hummed thoughtfully, his fork waving in the air. “You’ve been in my bed already. Why not make it official?”
“Yeah, dad. Would it be a good time to remind you that there are other guests at the table?” James asked, suddenly peeling his forehead off the table. “Or should I throw up on you as a reminder?”
“Hey, I’m much more than that, I’ll have you know,” Harry said very seriously. “I’ve also gotten my head stuck in a fence.”
“A solid reason is what everyone’s been giving since he first got here,” Harry shrugged, now giving his small realization some more thought. “We don’t actually know him.”
Harry was beginning to wish he could slap the government to enforce better laws to protect sex workers, but unfortunately he had no business with the Muggle government. The wizarding one however... maybe he should call Hermione in.
“I mean... you look tired,” and he did. While Malfoy looked good, all things considered, he looked exhausted. Possibly from working late nights, but Harry felt that there could also be emotional exhaustion from the little incident he witnessed just a few minutes ago.
“In my defense, I tried to get Kingsley to introduce us as Santa and the Elves,” Harry shrugged, still smiling widely.
“Please, just fuck me,” Draco repeated, feeling himself get more desperate. With a soft growl, Harry began pushing in. Despite how much both of them wanted him to go faster, he moved, gauging Draco’s reaction for when to pull back or still himself.
“Nonsense, Harry,” Hermione huffed, joining the pair of them. Aside from helping rebuild, she was also in charge of scheduling and checking on everyone, which meant she could visit them often. Of course, she never stayed too long because she refuses to slack off and waste time. “They’ll try to include you into the conversation. Draco and Neville aren’t like that.”
“I’m just giving you the space to pack your things,” Harry responded quietly, unable to look into those piercing gray eyes again.
Draco couldn’t focus on anything except the waves of pleasure that shot through him, the way his cock leaked and pleasure built at the base of his spine, begging for release. His skin tingled, feeling more sensitive everywhere his and Harry’s skin touched. When Harry sucked against the sweet spot on his collarbone, the sensation felt even stronger, making Draco moan wantonly.
Then, Harry grabbed his hands and began dancing them around, turning Draco off-beat and pulling him towards his chest, reminding him a bit of that afternoon they spent together before coming late to Pansy’s party.
“What did you get, love?” He asked, bracing himself slightly for a trail of floating stationary to tail an erratic Draco once again.
Harry must’ve noticed the crowds thickening as they walked, with some people even managing to weave their way in between Draco and Harry to get ahead, prompting Harry to grab is husbands hand.
“But it seems you have a lot to think about,” he continued, not caring about Harry’s lack of response. “So I think I’ll leave you to it. See you in class.”
“You poor baby,” Hermione cooed sarcastically, although Harry could tell she was holding back a laugh and continued scowling into his pillow. “Whipped for Draco and now he doesn’t know what to do with himself.”
“Er,” he said dumbly, his mind blank as he stared at Draco’s face which seemed to glow from the light that peeked into the dark room from the doorway. His eyes unconsciously roamed his body and, once he realized what he was doing, he decided to revert his attention towards thinking of a good way to wake him up.
“And who would hire a Death Eater?” At this, Malfoy raised the sleeve of his netted shirt. While it didn’t exactly cover the Dark Mark before, pushing it up made it strikingly clear against Malfoy’s pale skin, making Harry stare. He knew he shouldn't have, but he couldn't help it. It's been a while since he's seen another Dark Mark and yet somehow, even with Malfoy bearing to him, he didn't feel threatened.
“Alright, children,” Draco chided with a grin playing on his lips. “Stop picking on Harry.” This prompted his husband to stick out his tongue at the three youths, before Draco added, “it’s not nice to gang up on large children.”
Like always, Draco was turned on his side while pressed against Harry’s front, an arm wrapped around his waist and a leg thrown over both of his own.
“Unhand me,” Draco demanded, writhing and flailing himself clumsily in Harry’s arms. Unfortunately for the sleep-addled Auror, Harry was physically stronger than he was - and actually fully awake, - therefore managing to pull him off the bed by force. Still, that didn’t make the task of pulling a grown man’s entire weight out of bed much easier.
He used his free hand to try and tug off Draco’s own shirt, fumbling a bit until Draco helped take it off himself, finally exposing him to the cool air in the room. He shuddered a bit, resisting the urge to look away once his upper half was exposed for Harry to see.
Yeah, perhaps both of them were going to die of embarrassment before they made it back to their office alive.
“Did the Ministry not give you back your assets once the trials were over?” Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He was at Malfoy’s hearing, and he knew for a fact that this was one of the things that was promised to him. The vaults promised to his name, while still being owned by his father, should have been given back to him so he could start a decent life. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
, he added mentally. Another revelation from those times they actually talked and got carried away until Malfoy realized how long had passed before cutting the conversation awkwardly and walking away.
Shoving thoughts of how he thought Draco Malfoy looked good when he was happier, he watched as the blond held his closed fist up for all of his onlookers to set their attention to.“I don’t get it,” Blaise Zabini sighed, and Harry was inclined to agree. “Is something supposed to ha-”
It was apparent straight away that she cared a fair amount for the bloke, and insulting him was not the way to go. “No wonder she’d rather hang out with him. If you’re fragile masculine ego thinks it’s because he wants her, then I think you should re-evaluate yourself.”
“Shut up, you’re probably as bad as him,” Ron snapped before making his way back up to the castle as well, leaving Harry to stand awkwardly with the two Slytherins.
Unfortunately, the new Transfiguration teacher arrived at that moment, putting all conversations that filled the room to a close. But by some miracle, Harry was able to sit next to Draco in all their shared classes that day so all in all, it was a good day.
“Anyway, are you ready for once the feast ends?” Hermione asked him and Harry had to remind himself that they were Head Boy and Head Girl. “I managed to disseminate the Headmistress’s announcement to the Prefects before I got here.”
Both Ron and Harry groaned at Hermione’s suggestion. Since 8th years couldn’t be Prefects or Head Boy or Girl to give chances to the younger years, McGonagall had created a new position where she puts 2 people in charge of creating inter-house unity between them. Naturally, Hermione volunteered.
Harry, not paying that much attention to the words that came out of the exasperated Slytherin’s mouth, found himself leaning into the touch and sighing contentedly. “Feels nice when you do it,” he murmured, causing Draco’s lips to quirk upwards.
fault the man still couldn’t manage to drag himself out of bed on time. He had resisted Harry’s attempts over the last two days, and now it seems he’s taken drastic measures to keep Harry out.
“Well- uh. You see,” Draco stumbled over his words, trying to get the question out. That was strange. He was normally the more eloquent of the two, something he says often, at least. “Would you like to move in together?” He blurted before quickly looking away, trying to avoid Harry’s eyes, which had grown to the size of saucers. This was also strange, not exactly new, though.
“Must we, really?” Ron whinged. His girlfriend gave him a pointed glare. “I mean, that’s a great idea, ‘Moine, but how do you expect that to go?”
“I’m alright, thanks,” the blond man said, not noticing the way his green eyes widened. That voice, although empty without its usual drawl, was one he could easily pick out from a whole gala of chattering Ministry employees.
“If he hurts you, though, I will not hesitate to cut off his bollocks and spoon feed them to him,” she warned threateningly.
Draco searched his face, concern still marring his features. Harry gave him a reassuring smile before he eventually gave in,nodded, and briefly kissed Harry before pulling away.
“Hey, mate,” he ran into Neville after Potions, his last shared class with Draco for the day. Afterwards, the Slytherin was heading to Ancient Runes with Hermione while that was Harry and Ron’s last class for that day. “Can we talk?”
All words and possible coherent apologies blanked out of his mind the moment those gray eyes met his, making him unconsciously hold his breath.
“Sorry, I can’t,” Draco answered, looking a bit disappointed. “Head Boy duties. I promised some new 6th Years that I’d help them with their Charms texts.”
“Then maybe you should stay?” Harry suggested, feeling hopeful. He wouldn’t admit it out loud, but he didn’t like the idea of Draco leaving just yet. More so because he was worried that the blond could get sick, or maybe slip on ice, or-
“I bought that hair potion I was talking about,” Draco explained, pulling something out of his bag. It was a glass container with a green substance inside. It looked rather appealing, in Harry’s opinion, but he trusted Draco’s judgement.
“Hi,” Draco grinned, practically nuzzling Harry’s hand. Really, there was no better thing Harry could think of than seeing Draco in this soft, vulnerable state. Especially when he was smiling so brightly at him.
“I mean, just because I find him attractive and all, you’re not mad about me and Ginny?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Well, Potter,” Draco drawled, sounding slightly slurred as he was still trying to fully wake up. “If you wanted to be on top of me, you could have just said so.”
He heard some snickering coming from the area of Dean and Seamus along with Ginny asking them what was going on. Draco rigidly sat himself down next to Harry and began gratefully taking food from the plate Hermione handed him.
“What’s one person compared to the many that came from that house,” Ron debated. “She might’ve just been unlucky to be sorted there.”
He wanted to suggest doing the same to Ron, but after hearing him grumble under his breath the same accusations he spouted earlier, Harry thought it’d be for the best to let him cool down first.
Draco felt himself relax further once Harry stopped, grinning brightly at him before licking a broad strip up from the base of his cock all the way to the tip.
He was just dismissed from a shift of over 24 hours. After a stakeout that lead to successful raid which took up almost a whole day on its own, he was forced into one of those tedious meetings some Aurors are tasked to go to in order to discuss possible solutions for other cases as well as a break down of what happened in the previous raid for areas of improvement.
“Not too much,” Draco waved his hand off, grabbing the keys he had put down and heading to the Floo. “I’ll be back by dinner, or would you like to come with me instead?”
Upon further inspection, he noticed that one of the tires had a huge gaping tear, which had probably blown out.
“I suppose it did,” Harry smiled at them, giving Neville a pitying look that he hope portrayed ‘good luck there, mate.’
Sighing resignedly to himself, he decided to go around and talk to his other classmates. It wouldn’t do for Harry to sulk by himself and not enjoy the party. Besides, he was surrounded by friends anyway, he might as well enjoy himself.
“Get some sleep, Potter,” Draco groused, turning so that his face was pressed against his pillow. Harry was oddly tempted to do as he suggested, but he knew that neither of them would actually have the strength to get up once both of them are comfortably settled.
“Well, at least he’s enough of a swot to keep up with Hermione, if the Ravenclaw sorting was anything to go by,” Harry said lightly, forcing himself to keep an open mind on the man that they didn’t actually know.
And it’s not like Draco didn’t want to have sex with Harry, he just wasn’t sure how. He knew that if he didn’t prepare himself, it would probably turn out awkward, and Harry would probably realize that it isn’t worth staying with Draco because they aren’t compatible.
“I know,” Harry responded, shrugging and leaning back into the cushions. He was still holding Draco’s hand but had ceased with the rubbing. “They’ve been talking for ages, anyhow.”
Without saying another word, Harry pulled him in for another kiss, this one more gentle than the first. Tentatively, Harry held Draco’s hands, which were still clutching the blanket that covered his body, and pulled them away, allowing the duvet to slide off him slowly.
Harry felt his cheeks warm at what Draco said before standing, resisting the urge to physically drag Draco to the bathroom as well. “Just get dressed for work. I’ll be in your kitchen.”
“Since work is almost up, why don’t you just stay here,” Harry offered. “Then we can head to the Burrow together.”
“Oh yeah, because we got on so well in school, didn’t we?” Malfoy scoffed. “Face it; you wouldn’t have helped me and, to further this, I don’t want your charity.”
“Draco?” Harry asked worriedly, pulling out. He sat up straight, pulling his legs out from underneath Draco before leaning against the headboard, prompting Draco to sit up as well.
Despite their initial reluctance to work with each other, they made a great team. One of the best, in fact, which meant that they were often assigned to high profile cases. That man, ironically, helped him think clearly. They were good at pointing out the flaws in each other's plans and while that might sound rather antagonistic, it did them a lot of good on the field.
“Alright, alright,” Harry laughed, feeling lighter and optimistic than he did earlier. “Goodnight, Hermione.”
“However, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic has reached out to us over the summer regarding an exchange program with the students,” she informed everyone, and more chatter occurred, but it did not deter her from speaking. “Their options normally consist of the schools in America, so this is the first time we’ll be hosting them here, aside from the Triwizard Tournament.”
” Harry asked, doing a quick double-take and staring wide-eyed at the pair with his mouth agape. “You literally just bought it. How did it explode?”
Despite it not being what he asked for and being slightly exasperated, Harry couldn’t hold back his smile at Draco’s excitement over simple muggle things. He was, after all, the one who insisted he try some as well when trying to get him to agree to the telly despite all the hassle of making muggle technology work in a wizarding house.
“Why are you wearing a sweater?” Harry asked. It was nearly the end of summer, but still considerably warm outside. If they had to work under the sun, there’s no doubt Draco would be sweating all over.
“Jealous?” Ron asked, and Harry knew he was joking but he was right; he was a tad jealous. Before Harry could respond, Ron quickly remembered something. “Oh wait, I left my essay somewhere in my trunk. Tell Hermione to give me a second.”
He walked as fast as he could without being obvious to catch up with the lone retreating blond figure in the hallways.
“If you find yourself spouting nonsense about blood purity, don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Ron raised an eyebrow at him.
“Calm your tits, Draco,” Pansy sighed. “You guys have been inseparable since you came back from France. This is if I choose not to count my party and the nonstop letters you sent to each other while you were away.”
Draco’s eyes snapped towards his and his sharp features immediately transformed, sticking his tongue out and making a face that looked as if he was heaving his guts out. Harry let out a snort and apparently that was all it took for his two best friends to remember that there were other people riding with them.
“Because…” Draco shifted awkwardly from his position on the ground, eyes darting around the place like he was expecting something to show up. “The game? There’s nothing else left for us to do, anyway.”
“Oh tush,” she waved her hand. “There’s plenty hidden. Some might not even be found until the end of the day, and you can always just give away the candy you find,” she insisted.
“‘How long is this song,” Draco groaned softly, dropping his head on Harry’s chest. “On the bright side, other people have joined us now.”
“Hey, er,” Harry mumbled awkwardly, gathering his things. “I’m going to start with that plan of yours. So, goodbye.”
Normally it was Harry that really pushed their relationship forward. It was him who suggested that they couldn’t end the game, he planned the first date, he made the first move which lead to their first kiss.
“Oh please,” Harry huffed. “He’s around Neville too much for that statement to be true,” Harry mumbled under his breath, rolling his eyes until he realized how that might have come off to Ron, who was most definitely on Neville’s plan of asking Draco out.
“Hey, speaking of dating,” Neville piped in, and Harry’s ears immediately perked up. If Neville dates, then he’d probably spend less time around Draco.
“Perhaps,” was the reply he got. “I was considering it, but I’m not sure if I’d be in the mood to, what, get all dressed up to smile painfully at those arse-kissing officials at the Ministry?” Harry barked a laugh.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Draco forced a smile, silently willing himself to stop moving so often so that Harry doesn’t notice. It was bad enough that his nerves were beginning to get to him, there was no need to add the pressure of Harry knowing he was nervous.
“Harry,” Hermione said soothingly. “I know it’s hard, but I think you should give yourself some time and space away from them. If they’re happy together, then wouldn’t it be nice if you could find a way for yourself to be happy as well?”
Harry’s small smile widened a bit, giving Draco a nod and getting up to join him on the dance floor.
Before they could make it to the exit, though, they ran into a slightly tipsy Seamus and Dean supported by Neville who was trying to haul them to their seats.
“I’m sorry, but do we know you?” Hermione asked, finally speaking up for the rest of them and asking the question that they all seemed to have on their minds.
“Thank you, ‘Mione,” Harry smiled, reassuring his friend once again,thankful that they care enough to worry about him. “If I can’t handle it then I’ll stop. Don’t worry."
Instead of confirming or denying outright, however, the girl just laughed. In fact, she couldn’t seem to stop laughing, tears welling in her eyes while Neville smiled bemusedly at her.
Hell, even their travelling capes seemed to move gracefully. The girls wore their silk-blue dresses, hats, with their capes while the males wore a silk blue button-up with a darker waistcoat and a matching tie and trousers and their hats and travelling capes.
“Subtle,” Draco gasped, giving a slightly pained wheeze. Harry turned his head slightly just to be sure that he didn’t accidentally hit him too hard, only to be met with a light, teasing smile, which he gladly returned.
Right as the clock struck 12, Harry pulled Draco in for a kiss, as did the other couples around them. The only difference is that they didn’t separate after a few seconds, choosing to ignore everyone’s stares and whoops before pulling away for air.
“Draco left me a note!” He suddenly remembered, digging around in his pocket and earning a smack from Fleur, who was still attempting to tame his birds nest.
“Alright then,” Neville nodded, and the three of them made their way out of the greenhouse. “I’ll take off first.”
“Oh c’mon.” This time, it was Ron’s turn to snort. “It was pretty clear that you found him attractive the moment you saw him walk up to us in the Great Hall.”
“Let’s switch games!” Hermione cut both of them off, suddenly yanking Ernie back before he could defend the “foul”. She must have pushed him to the front while thinking of a solution, then.
“Me and Neville, you mean,” Draco mumbled, his cheeks flushing a bit. Although that could be because of the cold air that surrounded them.
“Ha!” Ginny barked a laugh while reading the note from her place behind him. “Well, at least we know what Draco would say,”
Ron seemed to share his thought process, having elbowed him lightly. They shared a glance for a second before turning back to their breakfast.
“So…” Harry said soon after, feeling undeniably tense for the confrontation that was about to come. “What did you need?”
He didn’t appear to be a fan, since he wasn’t freaking out or asking for a signature yet, or frantically shaking their hands and thanking them. On the other hand, he didn’t appear to be anyone that hated him as well, sensing no anger or hatred from him.
“That’s ridiculous!” Hermione exclaimed, her voice becoming louder. Harry heard the vague sounds of footsteps storming down the stairs, and suddenly his friends came into view.
“Harry likes Malfoy?!” Seamus shouted from the other side of the room before promptly receiving a smack to the head from Dean.
“Sure, but I didn’t say anything for you either,” Harry pointed out, unsure why he wouldn’t just take the absolution and run away like he wanted. “I mean, I did kind of agree with Ron at first, so I wanted to say sorry.”
Harry’s palms began sweating and he could feel his heart practically trying to beat its way out of his chest, wondering if Neville noticed how Harry kept monopolizing Draco in every class they had.
Draco’s response felt reluctant at first, but eventually Harry felt him push back and respond to the kiss. That’s when he figured it was safe to continue, moving his lips to deepen the kiss. Draco’s lips parted, allowing Harry to explore hesitantly. He was eventually able to build more confidence before the kiss became messier and they had to pull apart for air.
“Wait,” he breathed out, his voice sounding rough and foreign to his own ears. “If we’re going to do this, at least let me do this right.”
He let out a sigh, already knowing that Draco was going to be late. He had been coming in nearly an hour past their expected time the entire week and, frankly, it was beginning to stress Harry out because-
“But that’s not alright!” Harry felt rage bubble inside him. Dread filled him as he imagined what Malfoy might have meant by
It took a while, but eventually the sensation waned into mild discomfort rather than pain. Figuring that it was enough, he wiggled a second finger beside the one that was currently sliding into him, trying to force it in as well. It was considerably harder and slightly more painful when he did it, but eventually he managed.
He took a quick shower and got ready for bed, the sounds of his roommates piling in as he did so. They all followed suit and got ready for bed while chatting jovially. Except once Harry was in bed, he couldn’t actually fall asleep. He tossed and turned for a few more minutes while listening to their conversation until he gave up and drew his curtains back, joining their conversation.
“I believe that she can speak for herself,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Ron before glancing at Davis, who just watched the exchange quietly. Once he realized that she didn’t want to interfere on the conversation, however, he continued speaking. “And regarding the founder, I must admit that you can hardly blame him, although it seems that whatever had transpired during the passing of his message to those in his house had become murky over the years.”
“He did give some pretty interesting facts earlier,” Harry mentioned. He did, technically, albeit Harry wasn’t really a fan of the response he gave. “She probably found it interesting and wanted to investigate for herself. You know how she is.”
“I’m sorry,” Hermione apologized, looking up at them from her seat. “I must have forgotten to tell you, but I’ll be excused for the rest of the day. We’re supposed to give them a tour of the school grounds.”
Draco was wrong, it could get quite horrible. Harry began making his way towards Draco with the sea of people parting for him as he walked. When Draco realized what was going on he tried to back away and escape, only to be stopped by their friends.
“Potter!” He heard the front door bang open and loud footsteps, normally quiet and graceful, making their way upstairs to the bedroom. He panicked quietly and began shoving his things into the bag, ignoring how crumpled they were or if they took too much space like that.
“Head stuck in a fence, eh?” He raised his eyebrow. “You know what else gets caught in fences often? Deers.”
That much was evident by the time dinner came around. Harry arrived at the Gryffindor table and took a seat beside Neville, who was happily chatting with Sofia, their new housemate. Ron took a seat beside him, glaring at everything as he did so.
“Thanks, Hermoine,” he smiles gratefully at his friend, feeling his cheeks flush a bit with excitement.
“Okay wait,” Harry said, getting up after changing his mind. Who knows when Draco would actually make it back, and safely at that. “I’ll come with you instead.”
“Well, they did say we couldn’t stop until one of us loses,” Harry said slowly, already regretting this. “Unless you chicken out?”
Both Harry’s and Ron’s mouths dropped at her words while Neville’s confusion increased tenfolds. “I didn’t realize you guys were close,” Neville commented, apparently the only person who was able to speak and diffuse some tension.
In hindsight, Harry’s idea of waking Draco up a whole hour and a half before they actually had to be at work might not have been the best idea, but he wasn’t exactly known to have the best ideas when it came to Draco Malfoy.
“Nonsense,” a thick French accent cut into their conversation. It was Sofia, who was now looking at them incredulously while Neville watched on curiously, seemingly trying to piece all the information together.
“Okay, good,” Draco nodded seriously before turning to search for his morning drink. Harry found himself highly amused by how sluggish his partner was in the morning and watched him take a sip of his coffee.
His skin felt warm where they connected, a somewhat comforting feeling for Harry, as they disapparated. Once they arrived with a soft crack into Harry’s living room, he set the bag down on his sofa.
Harry knew Draco’s eyes were beautiful, but they looked much brighter in that moment, with the fireplace lit and reflect in them. They were practically sparkling as the reflection of the flames danced in them.
“Ha ha, you’re so hilarious,” he deadpanned, looking at her like it was the worst idea she’s ever thought of. And to think, she was supposed to be the one that had good ideas. It’s a sign that there’s no hope for Harry.
“What, you ran away and hid?” the sneer was still present on Ron’s face, distrust evident in his voice. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the other man yet. His mother did help him in the Forbidden Forest, but he still carried a strong dislike for Lucius Malfoy.
“I’ll take care of him,” Harry promised. “Why don’t you pack your bags and tell your employer that I’m paying you for the rest of the night so that you could settle in and I’ll meet you back here when you’re done.”
“I’m heading over to see Arthur,” Draco’s gray eyes lit up. “He wants to see the car and maybe give it a go since the Burrow is surrounded by open space.”
“Right,” Draco nodded. “By the way, I’m glad that I’m allowed to come back this year. That I finally get a chance to know you, and everyone.”
“The one at Malfoy Manor?” He clarified. For the entirety of their relationship, he’s managed to avoid any situation wherein he’d have to step in Malfoy Manor. No, he wasn’t afraid of the place and his memories there could be overlooked by the fact that the whole place has been renovated as well. He just didn’t want to see Lucious Malfoy, who was holed up somewhere there under house arrest.
“I meant I wouldn't stalk someone just because I like them,” Harry narrowed his eyes at his ex best friends. “See, not creepy.”
He took a deep breath and forced himself to take a step. And another, and another, and another, until he finally stood in front of Draco, who was peering up at him curiously.
“Oh, for Salazar’s sakes,” Draco huffed, walking back into the bathroom dressed in his pajamas with his hair wet.. “No wonder your hair is in constant disarray. Give me that!”
“Why would I do that?” Harry asked. “Wouldn’t it be better for me to just end it if I can’t. I don’t want to end any possible chance of friendship after.”
“Why? Everyone’s been making eyes at him since the moment he was called for the sorting!” Ron yelled back. Multiple figures that were scattered across the common room pressed themselves to the walls to avoid the verbal war that was going on, looking for a chance to escape to their rooms.
Once their food arrived, their conversation had settled down a bit. Harry was quick to shovel down a portion of his food, which didn’t escape Draco’s notice, as he earned himself an amused glance from his husband.
The slightly aged witch gave a surprised laugh and looked at the pair with amusement. “Such a cute couple.”
Instead, he knocked the block out with his wand and it went soaring towards Anthony Goldstein, who cheered loudly after narrowly avoiding getting hit by a flying block. “Wicked! I say that should be the only way we’re allowed to remove blocks.”
Hermione walked in with Draco beside her, albeit that he was lagging behind just slightly. He looked better than he did when he left, a small smile donning his face while he listened to Hermione rant about something or the other, offering a few words every now and then.
Harry nodded mutely, giving him a tight smile before letting himself out of the room, not trusting himself to say anything else that might give his feelings away.
“Oh, apparently there’s been an increase in students this year since the War is over and parents seem to think that it’s safer to send their kids here now,” Hermione responded. “Aside from that, since the Ministry practically forced some families to send their kids here, some students that were previously taught at home privately decided to go here instead, despite everything.”
“It’s alright, kinda” Draco said, suddenly serious, but he still had a small smile on his face. “It helped me realize that things like that are bound to happen, all things considered. But thank you for being kind about it now.”
“Just go,” Hermione said exasperatedly, pushing the blond off his seat. “The teacher won’t be here for another few minutes, anyway.”
“I think his private tutors recommended it,” she said. “Some pureblood thing instead of going to a wizarding primary. And his parents were ecstatic to raise a child prodigy, so he ended up abroad.”
“You guys are still here?” Harry asked, making his way to where they were bent over a set of plants.
Draco frowned. And upon further thought, as it seems, he frowned more before nodding with a resigned sigh. It shouldn’t be too bad, anyway. The entire Weasley clan knows about their game, but they also know that Harry has really fallen for the git. They won’t torture him.
He felt the bed shift behind him, watching the blond hair peek above his own dark curls as Draco attempted to position himself higher so see what he was doing as well as be able to look over Harry’s figure, grumbling and wishing he were taller.
“Are you sure about that?” Draco whispered, his face suddenly just mere inches from Harry’s own, making the man jump  in surprise, neary falling off the bed.
Ron looked like he was trying his hardest not to snort out loud while Hermione simply raised an eyebrow at him, something that had an increased effect once Draco saw her do it and gave pointers. On being
He felt his cheeks heat up, and not because of the increase of temperature in the room, and hoped that Harry didn’t hear it over his moaning.
“Right on, lad!” Arthur said excitedly, practically skipping down the stairs and running out with Draco to the front where Harry parked the car.
“Yeah,” Ron replied, nodding. “Actually, we were hoping you could help out. Since you know Malfoy the best, we were hoping you could distract him until Neville’s plan is ready since he’s practically inseparable from the other Slytherins.”
“Right,” Harry muttered, flushing. Suddenly, unsure of what else to say, he repeated his previously answered question. “Are you alright?”
“That you did,” Harry looked over at him, and they made eye contact briefly, widening their smiles before turning back to regard their guests. “I never said you didn’t catch my eye at Hogwarts either, anyway.”
“See? It’s always nice to refresh your memory and remember the younger parts of our relationship.” Their kids, despite the disgust of seeing their parents kiss, gave Draco a grateful look. Seeing as Harry was finally content with all of the content he’d spewn out to made Draco blush, they were all able to engage in a normal conversation and catch-up with one another.
Sadly, it seems that the fates had it out for him that day, because Hermione arrived with Ron in tow, loading their bags and hopping in.
Draco rolled his eyes as he said this while eyeing the crumbs that fell from his sandwich with distaste. Harry simply shrugged at the comment and called Draco a prat while flicking a crumb at him.
“I was just joking,” Draco hissed, trying to smile but looking bashful at those around them, all too happy to watch the scene unfold.
“Y-yes,” Draco struggled to gasp out when Harry began rubbing against the gland with the pads of his fingers. He felt his cock twitch against his stomach, leaking more pre-come onto himself as Harry massaged his prostate, making him shake with pleasure.
“It’s a gift and you should be proud because I did it on my own initiative without complaining,” he said smugly.
There were tables cleared in the front of the Great Hall, a designated space for the new students to eat in. While McGonagall made a quick mention of the fact that they didn’t have to eat there, but rather had the option to mingle amongst the Hogwarts students, most seemed to prefer sitting together at the front tonight.
Harry remembered. Of course he remembered. She, Nott, Crabbe, and Goyle had all given them hell since the first year they’ve been in Hogwarts.
“Kiss me again and I might be more sure,” Malfoy replied with some snark still present in his voice. However, the pink dusting his pale cheeks was enough to give him away. “In fact, I might just show you instead.”
“Do you even know what they talk about sometimes?” Harry practically whinged. It didn’t matter how old he was, he just finished a war he’s been fighting since he was a baby. He was allowed this. “Plants! And potions, and school.”

“Draco?” he called softly, unconsciously lifting a hand to rest it on the general area of the man’s shoulder.
“What’s up?” Harry asked, aiming for casual. They began walking side by side down the hall. Harry wasn’t even sure if they were meant to be in the same area, prompting Draco to walk with him, or if his classmate just wanted to talk with him.
There was a quick cheer after that and that’s how the game continued, prompting Harry to think that maybe Drunk Jenga wouldn’t be the best idea right now.
“Why is there a huge tear?” He asked, unsure if he really wanted to hear the answer. He hoped to Merlin that it was maybe a sharp rock that was lying around the area.
“Why?” Harry asked, recognizing Parkinson’s first name. “I did notice that you guys seemed to know each other on the first night you arrived.”
He agreed, and that’s what they did. The Weasley’s were a generous bunch, and they accepted Draco with open arms. Most of them, at least. It would take some warming up for some others to get used to him, much more really like him, but it was enough.
“So,” Harry said once they pulled away. “What exactly is this plan of yours to start waking up on time? Because, as much as I enjoyed waking you up myself, you must see that I’m not exactly thrilled to have someone else do it.”
“Nothing, love,” He managed to choke out, placing a lingering kiss on the worrying blond’s forehead. “I was just thinking of renovation ideas.”
“It matters,” Harry started, “Because it means that you might need more preparation before we have sex. I don’t want to cause you pain.”
Harry gave in with a sigh, sliding next to the man while also making sure that there was enough space between them so they were at a respectable distance.
She looked rather hopeful that he would say yes, but Harry felt like it would be too awkward if he just suddenly began joining them, especially since he sided with Ron at first. It meant that Draco thinks he dislikes him, and he’d either have to apologize in front of Hermione or make the awkward walk until they could be alone, and he didn’t really feel like doing either.
Harry noticed some of the Slytherins shift uneasily, but kept his focus on the new Headmistress. The Slytherins were accepted here, everyone knew that by now, and everyone got on just fine.
“Adorable,” Ron teased once his girlfriend was out of sight. “You could go join them, if you like. We’re almost done with this pillar and that should be it for the day.”
Nodding to himself, he stepped into the shower and began methodically going through his normal routine. He washed his hair thoroughly before scrubbing his body with a special soap that’s meant to help him feel softer. And once that was done, he reached towards the counter before grabbing the bottle he’d purposely set aside.
Neville appeared looking rather sheepish with Draco, who trailed behind him with an awful imitation of Neville’s facial expression.
Draco rolled his eyes briefly before lighting up instantly at the sight of their destination. They easily located the table where all their children were seated and asked for the menu from one of the waitresses passing by.
“Is this what it’s going to be like? Are we going to be the poster boyfriends for the Wizarding world to see?” Draco joked after a while, finally getting back to his old self.
Harry gave a short laugh and a small nudge, enjoying how his lithe frame swayed slightly at the sudden push. “They’re great, Draco,” Harry complimented. “It must have been pretty complicated.”
“Love, if it makes you feel better, sex doesn’t normally look like that,” Harry said, lowering himself to get in Draco’s line of vision.
“Oh Harry,” she sighed. “It’s pretty obvious to all of us that you like him, you know?” He choked, feeling a slight warmth creep up his neck.
They walked at a leisurely pace, giving Harry the chance to have a look around as they passed. All things considered, such as the fact that he was here without the risk of getting caught or looking for a possible murderer, the common room actually seemed quite nice.
“Poor ickle Draco,” Harry cooed, mussing up his hair, Though it was no longer slicked back harshly and settled loosely behind his ears, it was practically pristine and perfect. Well, at least it was until Harry got to it.
“Harry James Potter, do not even think for a moment that I will be letting you skive off your academics on the most important school year of our lives,” Hermione scolded. He hadn’t even realized that she took the free seat next to him with Ron on the next seat over.
Hermione gave Harry one last look before grinning at her boyfriend’s antics. “You present it to me as if it’s a gift and not like I’m doing you a favor here.”
He turned around and saw his classmates try to pretend they weren’t watching his conversation with McGonagall go down and chuckled lightly to himself. “It appears they are. I’ll have them clear the area then, shall I?’
“Hallucinate about me often, do you?” Harry teased, his heart beating heavily against his chest before noticing that Draco was beginning to fall back asleep. He tried not to make it too obvious that his eyes were having a field day eyeing the blond, silently thankful for the fact that Draco seemed to be too tired to notice anyway.
He felt nauseous at the idea of walking up to the blond who was sat casually at front, completely unaware of Harry’s internal struggle. Hermione was turned to the side, facing Draco while turning her head just the slightest bit while mouthing “Get on with it!”
“Just think, Harry,” Luna chimed in. “What would Draco say? Would he support your choice to drink? It could help you decide.”
“For what it’s worth, though,” Bill said, nudging him as he stood up. “Nobody is that committed unless there’s another reason.”
He moved slowly at first, giving Draco the time to adjust to the new sensation of having Harry’s cock split him open, thrusting in and out of his body. Harry rested one hand on the underside of Draco’s thigh, pushing down on it a bit while simultaneously parting Draco’s legs more.
“I’m sure Neville has that covered already,” Ron teased dryly as they slowly made their way on board with Harry feeling very reluctant to give up his search so soon. However, he realized that Ron probably wasn’t wrong about that. He wouldn’t be surprised if he was already sat with his old friends, or Neville and a mix of other people.
“Pull yourselves together, you uncultured, spineless maggots!” Malfoy glared at them with determination in his eyes. Harry took it back, he did learn something about his teammates from this game. Never fuck with Malfoy when he felt competitive.
The sound of their food finishing was able to shake him out of his thoughts, so he grabbed their plates and a fork to transfer the food before hearing a
“Just,” Harry felt like ripping his hair out. “Look, you said you don’t want charity. Fine, I’ll stay out of your business and won’t meddle with what you’re doing, but at least live with me until you manage to afford your own place and graduate so I know you’re safe whenever you go out to work.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked. Draco nodded before giving Harry a shy smile. “You have to promise me that you’ll tell me if you don’t like something, though.”
“I suppose I best make the most of it then,” Draco sighed dramatically, closing his eyes once again.
“Hey, I’m Shawn,” He introduced himself. Draco looked lost on how to continue. “You’re Harry Potter, aren’t you? You’re a legend!”
“But if I own a share, shouldn’t they just supply us with is?” He asked, still not fully understanding the situation. Harry shook his head. No, they don’t. “What a scam,” Draco scoffed. “They’re not such good businessmen after all.”
“Right, well…" Ron trailed off awkwardly, unsure of what to say at the strange looking display in front of him. “I’m going to bed.”
“Whatever you say, mate,” Ron teased. “And he’s from a prissy Pureblood family. Honestly, not likely.” Harry felt something inside him twist, although he had no idea why. Somehow, the thought just disappointed him.
“I woke up comfortable and I’m going to bloody stay comfortable,” Draco grumbled “And if you think I’m going to make it any easier for you to break in, you’re wrong,”
“Since we’re all here, shall we start with the Easter Egg hunt?” Narcissa clapped her hands and the children started buzzing. They stood up one by one and were led to the garden, Harry and Draco following at the very end.
“Bite me, you wench.” The pout on his lips was back, and it took everything in Harry to tear his eyes away. Malfoy had been the loudest and most talkative of the group when it came to guessing and, being the talent that he is, still managed to get most of his guesses wrong.
“No objection from me,” Harry smiled, but he knew Draco wouldn’t leave. Besides the fact that it was simply too ‘improper’ for them to do, they decided to have the first dance once everyone receives their food. Why they decided to wait so long, he had no idea.
Sure, it was still a bit darker than the Gryffindor Tower, but the place actually seemed quite… cozy. There were some scattered cushions on the carpet by the fire, surrounded by worn leather sofas. The light from the lake glowed through the windows, lighting up the different corners of the room in a somewhat striking way as they reflected on the various surfaces there.
, he added silently. Why was it always their dinner on the line when Draco came home with new Muggle things.
Draco glared at him, and proceeded to keep glaring at him until he was nearly out of the doorway. The effect of the glare was somewhat dampened by the fact that Draco still looked ruffled with his mussed, blond hair and pinkness on his cheek from where he rested it.
“So, I guess we have some news to break to them later?” Harry asked the blond who was laying across his chest, face just inches apart.
When Harry peered over his shoulder, he realized that the inside of his trunk was expanded and, even worse, the many cabinets it came with were also expanded. He figured that yeah, it would take a while, he might as well take a seat.
“Harry!” He internally groaned. “Truth or Dare?” He glared at Justine Finch-Fletchy and cursed him mentally, trying to decide which of the two options might be worse for him.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said with a small shrug. “You don’t seem to be up for it now, but it does give us some time to talk about this better.”
“That’s amazing, love.” Harry said, pulling his boyfriend down onto the space on the couch next to him. “Thank you,” he said, giving him a long but chaste kiss.
“About that…” they turned left into the Great Hall and sat at the nearly-empty Gryffindor table. “He didn’t give us the exact name, per se, but he did describe him.”
There were a few scattered chuckles around the hall, and Harry found his lip twitching into a smile. Hermione listened attentively, clearly curious as to what their former Transfiguration teacher might announce, while Ron sat beside her, grumbling about being hungry.
“Did you just-” Harry sputtered, staring. If he looked even closer, it almost looked like there was a small hole in the wall. He looked at Draco disbelievingly, but the man had already begun to doze off, his head lolling at an uncomfortable looking angle.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
“Why would I need a reason to have a disco ball?” Draco huffed, plopping himself down on one of the seats. Neville rolled his eyes and swished his wand. Not a few moments after, a bunch of snacks came floating onto the table in the drawing room and music began thumping through the walls.
“Oh sweet Circe, look at him!” she practically swooned, and her friend nodded in agreement, both staring dreamily at the blond that was seated in front under the Sorting Hat.
“If the school hasn’t worked towards reforming those notions and providing proper solutions to guide their students to critical thinking, then it sounds more like an institutional problem, no?” Draco asked, still looking unaffected by Ron’s harsh accusations. For someone who wasn’t even sorted into the house, he defended it quite vehemently.
“Draco!” He feigned excitement, trying to ignore the rapid beating of his heart. “How sweet of you to join us,” he slid to the side, making more room for his ‘boyfriend’ to sit with them at the Gryffindor table. A hush fell over the entire Great Hall as everyone paused their conversations to stare at the odd pairing.
Harry tried not to feel resentful at the fact that they were forced to get up earlier than normal to witness the sorting of the exchange students’ sorting. At the same time, though, he was a bit excited to see if anyone would be sorted into Gryffindor in their year.
Harry took comfort in the fact that if Draco wasn’t sitting with him, at least he wasn’t with Neville either. Now neither of them could hog Draco.
“Where’s that Gryffindor bravery, huh?” Malfoy teased, not unkindly. “Don’t tell me I’ve finally bested you at something so very
“Hey, Harry,” Neville piped up, pulling him out of his lone sulking. “Draco and I were wondering if it would be a good idea to have a party for everyone that helped out with the rebuilding. What do you think?”
“You can move again,” Draco whispered, mind still slightly hazy from his orgasm. He felt Harry continue thrusting into his sensitive channel, the sensation going straight to his spent cock. One, two, three thrusts until Harry’s pace became erratic, and Draco felt warm spurts flood him inside.
He used his knuckles to press lightly against the spot before rubbing them against it, and at this point Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to buck his hips upwards into Harry’s mouth, or grind himself against the sheets and apply more pressure to where Harry’s hand was massaging him.
“I still don’t get it,” Zabini said. Harry didn’t either, but he was determined to find out. He also mentally decided that this agreeing with Zabini thing had to stop.
It’s not that Harry had explicitly said that he wanted to have sex with Draco tonight, but he knew. Their past few nights spent at one another’s flats were enough to see how Harry was slowly building his way towards it, becoming more and more confident and bold in how he touched Draco when they snogged.
“Mate, maybe you were right and we do know him,” Ron whispered, having noticed the man that was approaching them as well.
“Yes, I must,” Harry replied, doing his best to hold in his laughter. For what, nobody knew. “It’s to remind you all of what you’ve been missing ever since you all moved out.”
“That was disgusting,” Zabini sighed once more, this time dropping his head onto the table. That, Harry didn't quite share his opinion with, although perhaps he should have.
“I wouldn’t marry someone for a game. For just a game and speaking of,” he said, taking something out of his back pocket. “You never gave me an answer.”
Harry hated it when people reminded him that his relationship with Draco was just a game. It always hurt all the same, but being able to be close with Draco in some way was enough.
“Did you know that your prostate is as big as a snitch?” Harry informed him, making Draco confused. He was pretty sure that this conversation could wait until the morning, but he decided to indulge his boyfriend.
“Would you let me go after them?” Harry asked hopefully, only to earn himself a snort from the other man.
camp in your bloody living room until you learn to get up on time,” Harry threatened, standing outside the door to Draco’s flat. It was Wednesday and the sod decided it would be a brilliant idea to lock Harry out so he could get a few more hours of sleep.
“Don’t think that I’m some stupid virgin,” Draco said, his voice shaking. “I can handle you just fine.”
“Look, Draco is a good guy, and I can say that there are many people in his life who wouldn’t be pleased to hear you say things like that, starting with me,” she said, her voice still hard but no longer angry. “He has loyal friends, and I think it would be better if you got to know him yourself instead of creating assumptions based on who his family is.”
“She is,” Ron nodded, a small smile finding its way onto his face. Harry doesn’t think he noticed it, but he thought it best to not point it out. “Just give me the go signal if I can hex him.”
“Sure, mate,” Ron said, making space for Neville to sit down comfortably. The other man thanked him and let himself get settled in before seating himself next to Harry. The cart still had a fair lot of space with only 4 of them in there, so it wasn’t too cramped. Small mercies.
Since he left his shoes at the entrance, he figured that he’d be fine. Slowly, so that the bed didn’t rustle too much, he climbed on until he was standing, practically towering, over his fellow Auror.
“You bastard,” Draco rolled his eyes and swatted Harry’s hand away, but he could see Draco’s lips form a slight smile. Suddenly, he got a mischievous glint in his eyes and shoved his fingers in Harry’s hair before yanking his hand back harshly.
A small fluff of fuzz gathered on his pale hand and he took a pinch of them, taking about half, and blew it in Harry’s direction. Suddenly, Harry felt as if something was tickling his insides and let out a sudden laugh before abruptly stopping himself, the tickling sensation fading.
Surging forward for another kiss, Harry met him half way and savored the feeling of Malfoy’s pliant mouth opening to grant his tongue entrance into his own, their tongues sliding against one another as Harry’s hand snaked upwards to grab a fistful of Malfoy’s hair. He heard a soft groan emerge from the other man's throat before it clicked in his head that there was something wrong.
“Oh really,” Pansy chimed in along with Blaise. She gave Draco a shit-eating grin before saying “Well we’ve always figured since 4th year. You know, “Potter” this and “Potter” that.”
“Doesn’t feel like it when you keep choosing that snake over me and Harry.” Silently, Harry wished they wouldn’t bring him into this. “You’re the one acting off, what with your new snake friends and all.”
“I mean, if you’d like to apparate back to your house and come back later, it’s all the same to me,” Draco shrugged carelessly, as if he weren’t inviting Harry into his bed.
“Malfoy,” Hermione sighed, pushing Ernie to the front. He looked at her with desperation but her puppy-dog eyes were stronger. “No.”
“Yes, but I think it would be more fun if I brought you as my date,” Harry retorted, feeling a blush creep up his neck before adding, “So we’re seated together, I mean.”
“They assigned me to more technical tasks,” the blond shrugged. “Probably recognized precious cargo when they saw it.”
“After doing this for so long, you don’t think he’ll wonder why?” Bill explained. “He might think he did something wrong. It could even hurt him if you just suddenly packed up and left.”
Draco wanted to feel pleased, except instead he felt his hands threaten to clench against where they rested on Harry’s chest, because his boyfriend had steadily trailed his hand down towards Draco’s arse, kneading the flesh there.
“What’s wrong with Slytherin?” Draco inquired curiously. If one were to listen closely, they might have even described his tone as defensive.
“Merlin, fine,” Malfoy sighed, pretending to sound annoyed, but Harry could tell he was secretly pleased by the turn of events by how there was a slight upward turn to his lips. “If it eases your mind.”
“You can keep going,” Draco murmured, thankful for Harry’s control over the situation. It took a few seconds, but they managed to continue until Harry was buried to the hilt in Draco.
“Great,” Harry grinned, already counting which classes both he and Hermione are taking so he knows when he’ll be able to see Draco.
“If it’s a lovers quarrel, we’re still technically playing the game and winning. All couples fight eventually, totally normal. Like your average gay couple,” Draco huffed. “Follow me, Potter. We’re going to fix this mess you made.”
Forgetting just about everything in the world, Harry grinned and dived forward, pulling the other man in for a kiss. A real kiss. It wasn’t as long as he would have hoped, but at least now he knew he would be able to keep doing it again.
“Right, well,” Harry mumbled, suddenly nervous. He was starting to remember why he didn’t want to do this. “I just wanted to say sorry. For treating you like shit. Yeah.”
Harry nibbled on Draco’s lower lip, eliciting a soft whimper from the blond. After a particularly hard bite, he would soothe the skin by running the tip of his tongue over the sensitive spot before sucking it back between his teeth, repeating the action.
Now that he had pointed it out, Harry noticed that unlike the blankets he had on his own bed, Draco’s had a thin duvet on it, something that shouldn’t make him overheat during the hotter parts of the year given the cool air of the dorm from being situated under the lake.
“I- yeah,’ Harry choked out, hoping his disappointment didn’t show on his face. “We can stay at Grimmauld Place until we find somewhere else we both like.”
“I don’t think I could ever regret anything with you, Harry.” He pulled Draco a little bit closer than considered modest but who cares. They just got married.
“You were looking for him, anyway,” Pansy gave him a shit-eating grin before pushing him forward with the strength she had no right of possessing, causing him to stumble forward into Harry’s arms.
“Careful, Potter. We’re making a scene now,” Malfoy whispered lowly into Harry’s ear, possibly making sure that others wouldn’t hear their conversation. Thankfully, it was only the 8th years that were openly staring and whispering as the younger students remained oblivious as to what was happening at their table.
No, Draco was faster. The bedroom door swung open, and it was only a matter of time until he was spun around as well.
“But I could probably do it before class if you actually do get up, that is until you get the hang of it at least,”’ Draco conceded, not noticing the odd tone to Harry’s voice.
“Yes, Ronald,” she rolled her eyes fondly. “Think of how exciting this could be! What if the student I get also loves to study? Maybe we could trade notes and ideas of projects!”
“I don’t think I could actually not think about fucking you, no,” Harry teased, his grip tightening around Draco’s waist.
Apparently their next subject was Ancient Runes, which Harry did not take. This meant that he would most likely end up alone, unless he manages to find one of his other friends while wandering aimlessly until he reaches the common room and settles on self-forced seclusion until further notice.
Oh, the knitting? Just something Hermione had him pick up in his free time. She suggested he do something other than laze around and watch the telly all day and just donate some of the things he makes to S.P.E.W. or an orphanage.
“He was probably confused,” Draco huffed. If one were to look closely, it would seem like there was a light pink sheen fighting its way onto his cheeks, but maybe Harry was overthinking and beginning to see things. “In fact, he’s probably still confused. Don’t think I’m going to let you copy my notes, Potter.”
As the door opened wider, pats of the room were slowly revealed. He scanned the area warily before his eyes landed on a lump under a large duvet. The only sign that it was actually Draco under there were the few strands of blond hair sticking out from the top by the pillows.
“You- You’re right,” Harry sighed, already dreading the fact that one day he’d have to tell him. He’d have to end things because they couldn’t keep playing around like that forever.
. What the bloody hell did he mean by that. He didn’t have enough time to contemplate what he said, more so ask, because when Harry gave the skin a small suck, Draco gasped, arching his back  while his arse gave way for one of Harry’s fingers to slip in.
“A hero to us all,” Harry rolled his eyes, turning a corner. Draco had finally given in and laughed, bumping their shoulders lightly, a small form of contact that nearly had Harry stumbling on his own feet. “So, were you hoping to try it now?”
“Huh?” Draco asked, his voice muffled. He peeked his head from the top of the casing and eyed the item in Harry’s hand. “Oh, that. It’s Neville’s. He left it here when he came by yesterday.”
“They are supposed to be joining us between the last week of January or the first week of February, and will be leaving 2 weeks before their OWLs and NEWTs take place,” she informed them. “Now, the reason I’m telling you this so early on is because they will be needing a student to partner with them and guide them around in the months they will be staying here. They won’t be assigned until before the Christmas Holidays, but this is your chance to inform your parents and talk about it, as well as possibly learn their language to talk to them better.”
“Why are you going up? I figured you’d be assigned to keep an eye on the Dungeons for Slytherins and Hufflepuffs,” Harry asked curiously.
And life continued as it normally did. Draco didn’t comment when Harry left food out for him every morning and evening. He didn’t react when he and Harry began spending their free time together when Draco didn’t have class or it was too early to work and Harry had a free day.
“Sorry to shit on your Savior Morals, Potter, but the law doesn’t exactly care about whores like me,” Malfoy spat spitefully, glaring at the ground as he spoke.
“Hello, love,” Draco’s voice said before he added in a much quieter tone. “I’m going to end you, Potter.”
“Because,” Draco huffed, looking down and fiddling his thumbs. “You’re not the only one who can say stupid shite at the wrong time, you know.”
“Why?” Draco glared sullenly, looking like he was on the verge of falling back to sleep. Harry was overcome with the strangest need to smooth out his hair and kiss his pout away. “Just why?”
It was a sketchy route to take, Harry knew, but honestly, he didn’t really care. Sure, he was too tired to apparate without the risk of splinching himself, but that doesn’t mean is incapable of defending himself should something happen. He was a wizard, after all.
“Why?” Harry asked, somewhat surprised. Draco loved that blanket and, ever since he admitted to having a hard time falling asleep without it, Harry understood why he kept using it despite the fact that it made him late in the mornings.
. If Draco wasn't looking at him right now, he’d probably facepalm until his forehead was permanently red, because
The cheeks burned even more when he watched Harry’s cock spring free from the garter, his own hardness twitching in his pants.
Malfoy’s cheeks pinked a bit at this. He glanced briefly at Harry, causing them to make eye contact, and swallowed thickly before Seamus spoke up saying, “Not so brave anymore, are ya?”
“I don’t know,” Harry smiled, “Can’t blame the world if they want to keep staring at you. You’ve got a great-”
Pulling away from their kiss, Harry trailed his lips lower, pressing small kisses down from his jaw to his neck nipping and licking at the skin as he did so. He continued downward until his mouth was pressed against the nipple that wasn’t currently being teased by his other hand.
“Draco,” Pansy sighed, finally dropping the smirk. “I may not be his biggest fan, but I don’t think that Potter is the type to date just to get into your bed.”
“Are you two planning on taking turns napping in Binns’ class then?” she asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow at them.
“May the Gods above help this poor student that gets assigned to her,” Harry snickered, and Ron joined him soon after. Hermione glared at them and rolled her eyes once more before refocusing her attention back to the sorting, as the first years entered while they were talking.
Hermione was beginning to fidget, having not yet been assigned a partner. Apparently, they wanted the Sorting Hat to assign partners based on how well the two students would get along, which is why they hadn’t been assigned prior to their arrival.
“You have a point,” he started when he saw her give him a pitiful look. “But I’m not sure. I don’t think I’d be able to get over him just like that, but I also don’t want to lose him.”
“Draco! Draco! Draco!” he chanted with every bounce, but the only response he got was a slightly disturbed stir. Harry felt himself slowly get tired and decided to flop down on the sleeping figure.
He refused to do that, though, and forced himself to try and swallow the gulp he took in, slightly choking on his hot drink as he did so.
Hermione and Draco had gotten on surprisingly well, but Hermione and Ron were one of the few who took much longer to warm up to him. Ron still calls him ‘Malfoy,’ until now, but they’ve become relatively civil at least. Hermione, on the other hand, is glad to finally have someone who can keep up with her rants, arguments, and academic quests and Draco, who probably feels that he owes a lot more to her, is always willing to indulge her.
“Oh, it was,” Harry said, giving him his second shit-eating grin of the night. “But it was mainly because I knew you’d hate it.”
“Hey,” a soft voice sounded through the noisy area whilst students were loading their trunks. “The carriage I was supposed to ride got full. Can I ride with you?”
“You wish,” Draco scoffed. Then, he bolted back upright before looking at Harry suspiciously, making the fully dressed Auror flinch backwards to avoid having his head smashed by the other. “Wait, why are you here?”
“I told her I’d think about it because I wasn’t sure if I could be arsed to drag myself out of bed,” Harry replied, grinning. It was the partial truth. The other half was that he was hoping that he could convince Draco to stay with him instead, and maybe gather enough bollocks to make a move on the other man.
, Harry shuddered. Now Harry was really glad he didn’t step up to volunteer as a guide. Of course, it’s not like the Headmistress would be giving them cursed objects, but he didn’t exactly want a reminder of what happened back in Second Year, and by the look on Ginny’s face, she didn’t either.
“You have to admit though,” Harry said, shrugging. His eyes were still on the two figures that had seated themselves down at the Slytherin table. “It is kind of strange. They seem pretty familiar with Parkinson too.”
“The Daily Prophet disagrees with that statement, I’ll have you know,” Harry scoffed playfully. “Where’s your #1 Most Desired Bachelor of the month page?”
Harry froze. He could not believe- no. He will kill them when this is all over. He chanced a glance at Malfoy, who looked utterly lost. So that means he didn’t know what the game was. Dean must’ve sensed his confusion because he quickly got down to explaining the rules.
There was no answer, so he knocked again. And again. And again. Eventually he just gave up and whispered
The way his eyes shifted beneath his eyelids, making his eyelashes flutter against his cheeks, the soft sighs of pleasure when Harry brushed his thumb repeatedly over his hip, the way he leaned into Harry when they were close enough, pressing himself into the warmth between them.
“Let them talk, then,” he said eventually. “I like how what’s between us is normally private between us, anyway.” It would explain why they were both cooped up alone together in Harry’s house, without the presence of their other friends. He got a soft humm from the blond next to him.
like my father?” he asked calmly, but his voice was dangerous. His face looked disgusted even as he said it, as if the notion of being anything like Lucius Malfoy was deeply offensive to him.
"You could go to me," Harry said sincerely. "Even if it's just for the sake of having a decent place to stay while you study." He couldn't imagine a whorehouse being a comfortable place to study, considering Malfoy also said he was also a student.
“It doesn’t look too bad,” Draco murmured, checking his hand for damage. He pulled Harry over to the table by the wrist and told him to take a seat before fumbling with his wand and waving it over the reddened skin.
“Here,” Draco said, Transfiguring some sticks into a basket. Harry took it and they began searching. Not that Harry would admit it out loud, but it was actually kind of fun. There was some strange thrill that came with finding an egg.
Thankfully, the carriage had just stopped moving, signalling that they had to get off. Ron and Hermione got off first, being the closest ones to the door, and went ahead of Harry and Draco. They continued talking about how they thought the school year would go until they reached the entrance of the Great Hall, where Harry felt rather reluctant to part so soon and go to the Gryffindor table while Draco made off to the Slytherin table on the other side of the hall.
“Potter!” he yelped, pushing Harry off him. His gray eyes stared back at him, widened in surprise. “What the hell?”
“My grandfather did a what now?” Harry asked dumbfoundedly, unaware of this fact and a bit put-off that Draco knew this about his family before he did.
“C’mon,” Harry urged, like how one would do a sulking child. “There’s coffee waiting for you in the kitchen.”
“And if you think you’re going out there without your blazer or Boutonnière, you’ll soon be a dead man instead,” Oh. Right. That. It wasn’t hard to put on, anyway. Just needed a bit of fixing.
“It happens,” Malfoy glared at him. “It’s not always like that and I’ve been doing just fine without any charity, so I don’t understand why you’re insisting that I stay with you now.”
“Oh, you’re right!” Shawn suddenly panicked before dashing off to search the grounds with everyone else.
“So you’re really not doing this because you want to go out with him?” Ron clarified once Harry managed to calm himself down.
“What I mean is,” Harry placed a quick peck against Malfoy’s glistening lips. At least that small action loosened his frown a bit. “let me take you out properly, yeah?”
Right. Steadying himself, he picked up the pace and began stroking the hardened length in his palm, mentally willing himself to move on to the next step if he really wanted to make Harry feel good.
“No! And unless you’re planning on apologizing, I think it’d be best if you stayed away from us until they leave for their NEWTs, because Draco is a
“Well, Ronald,” Hermione huffed, giving her boyfriend a light smile. “It’s your fault you boys stayed up so late to talk. It’s ass if you aren’t going to be seeing each other for the rest of the year!”
, one that almost sounded like someone bumping into a wall, and turned around just in time to see Draco stumble in.
“I saw some students lounging out by the Great Lake,” Ron said as they exited their final class for the day. “Which means that the tours are probably done. We should go find Hermione.”
“Won’t you be busy, then?” Harry asked, hoping that if Draco says yes, at least he’ll have a way to still spend time with him, even if it’s just as friends.
Harry briefly went over the situation which should be enough to make a case against the man, which still took a bit longer than expected since he needed to sign some paper work, before apparating back to the alley where he left Draco.
“Well... I said no, didn’t I?” All things considered, he probably deserved that pinch. “If you regret this because I pound your toes in, it’s on you.”
“Of course not, Potter,” He scoffed, straightening out his back. “I’m simply freezing.” Okay, maybe he had a valid reason. It was late into November, after all. But it wasn’t that cold.
And the school year continued on like that, neither of them giving up. They’ve even escalated to working together in class and spending most of their free time together, much to the delight of Hermione as she finally had someone that understood everything that was coming out of her mouth.
His boisterous entrance did nothing to awaken his partner, though, forcing Harry to resign himself to manually waking him up again with a sigh. Not really in the mood to wrestle Draco out of bed, he sat down at the very edge, feeling the bed dip under his weight, facing towards his sleeping friend.
“I did set an alarm,” Draco huffed, still managing to sound petulant despite the tiredness in his voice. “You see that weird lump in the corner? Yeah.”
“This wouldn’t have happened if you just set an alarm,” Harry managed to gasp out, still slightly breathless from having to heave Draco out of bed, and also the fact that he couldn’t believe he just manhandled
At some point, everyone had broken into different games in different places in the drawing room. In the center, people were playing beer-pong, while there was one circle for those playing Truth or Dare and various groups who were just talking all around the place.
This meant that Harry would most likely not be seeing Draco for a few days, since he planned on staying with his family in France while Harry spent his time with the Weasley’s. Another wave of disappointment hit him, but he did his best not to show it and instead try to channel his energy into getting Draco to stay for a while longer.
“Maybe you ought to have thrown yourself in and spared me, because we were so close that night,” Harry retorted childishly. His friends didn’t know exactly how close they were to kissing, but Harry didn’t feel like mentioning it yet.
“Or you could give me the password and I’ll find my way in,’ Harry suggested, completely joking. Sure, he knew where they were, but he’d rather not be the only Gryffindor in there without a single Slytherin to back him up.
Pansy decided to host her Christmas party on the 23rd, stating that there were some people who’d already have their family gatherings on the 24th, with 25 being out of the question and the 26th being for Boxing Day.
Except, when he ran into Draco in the Grand Staircase, he was feeling significantly less tired. The other man, on the other hand, looked frazzled as he kept track of the students walking in a single file.
Harry, much to Draco’s horror, had come out on stage in a full Santa costume, having spelled the hair on his head white along with his medium-length stubble that border-lined a full beard. Well, that explained why he refused to shave in between the few days they had been meeting before the party.
“I was supposed to,” Draco responded, giving a slight shrug. “But there are more new Prefects in Ravenclaw and Gryffindor this year, while Slytherin’s and Hufflepuff’s have had prior experience already, so I figured I’d guide them through for their first time.”
“Right,” Harry said, vaguely amused. “And I don’t think you’re an idiot for not knowing these things. Sex can be complicated.”
“You really are gorgeous,” Harry said in a soft whisper, not giving Draco any time to respond adequately as he leaned back down to press his lips firmly against Draco’s, this time dominating the kiss as he slid his tongue into Draco’s pliant mouth.
“You know, you fit that description too,” Harry laughed, making his way over to his frantic fiance and hugging him from the back. He placed a kiss on the back of his neck, earning himself a light shudder, but the blond persistently braved the task of making sure there were no pairings like Lucious Malfoy and Xenophilius Lovegood. Nope, no need to deal with that.
“Ah, but this assignment revolves around you getting your partner to work with you,” Robards grimaced. “I need you to make sure that Malfoy starts coming to work on time. Since it’s for work, I’ll be giving you a 30 minute window every day.”
“Am I provoking some sort of, ah, inappropriate ideas at the table, then? Am I bothering you?” Malfoy had gotten up from his seat at this point and slowly sauntered over to where Harry was seated.
He rubbed his head and pouted at his best friend. Harry ignored them all and looked down, mumbling “I’m not creepy.”
“At least now that I know you’re a virgin, we can explore other things for the future,” Harry snorted, throwing an arm around Draco’s waist and pulling him closer until he was pressed against his chest.
“Sure,” Harry responded, attempting to return the smile he was given. It was a weak smile, but it was enough for his best mate.
“Potter-Malfoy, isn’t it?” Harry laughed, earning an affectionate kiss on the cheek from Draco. “But please, call me Harry instead. We are family now, after all.”
Any previous confusion he had turned into warmth. He was always thankful for McGonagall, and how she would sometimes feel like a parent figure to her. “Thank you, Headmistress,” he smiled.
Finally, Harry unwillingly interjected. “That is hardly something that should be discussed at the breakfast table.”
“Hey, love” Harry hushed, holding Draco’s hand. “Even when we were playing, it was never just a game to me. I always loved what we had.”
Harry felt a blush creep up from his cheeks and mentally willed them to stop since Draco’s hands were on his face and would most likely be able to feel the warmth in his cheeks even if it were covered by his hands.
“Gotta run,” Harry flashed the rigid trio before making a run for the nearest room. Sadly, Ginerva Wasley was much faster. In Harry’s defense, she was on a broom.
“Merlin, I can already see her brain forming plans to fit this in with our NEWTs revisions,” Ron sighed.  Then, he turned his pleading eyes towards her. “You’ll still help us, right, love?”
“Now children, this will be my final announcement before the exchange students arrive.” It was mid-breakfast on the day of the Beauxbaton students’ arrival. They were set to arrive at dinner time once all classes were finished, and Headmistress McGonagall has been stressing over this for weeks now.
“I don’t even want to know why you have family trees memorized,” Harry mumbled, shaking his head lightly. “Maybe I’ll give it a go, then.”
“I mean, we’re basically the reason this whole thing started.” Seamus continued, still looking at Harry as he batted Ron off him.
“Let’s get breakfast, then. The others probably think we plan on sleeping through the ceremony or something,” Draco said, pulling away from Harry, who wanted to pull him back towards him and just hold him forever.
“Can’t you just let me find Draco first?” Harry pleaded, the rapid movement of his eyes never ceasing as he scanned the crowd for a bright, blind head. “What if he’s not able to find an empty train cart to sit in.”
Draco looked rather put out once he realized that it was almost time for him to leave if he had any plans of making it to Pansy’s Christmas Party. Harry supposed he should even count himself lucky that Draco chose not to skip out on their weekly hang-outs together instead of spending more time preparing for the party or going earlier.
Draco’s head snapped to their entwined fingers before glancing at Harry, making sure he was holding the right hand. As if sensing Draco’s momentary confusion, Harry brought his hand towards his lips and placed a brief kiss on his knuckles before giving Draco a reassuring smile. Draco, unable to help himself, smiled back at his caring boyfriend. Alas, that bliss was only momentary before Harry ruined the moment by saying, “Did you feel my jacket? It’s made of boyfriend material.”
Eventually, Harry left his nipples in favor of trailing kisses down Draco’s chest, all the way to his stomach before lifting his head slightly, breathing over the damp spot where pre-come had begun to gather on the base of his abdomen.
“Hey, mate,” Seamus called, barging into Ron and Harry’s office in the Auror Department. “You’re still coming out with us for drinks, aren’t ya?”
“Don’t,” his boyfriend murmured before kissing him deeply, swiping his thumb over some spit that had caught below his lip. “If you keep going, this might be over too soon.
Without even bothering to knock anymore, because Draco never had and probably never will hear him when he does, he barged in and took a seat at the foot of the bed.
“So, what, he’s monopolizing Hermione and trying to get her into his bed? She has a bloody boyfriend.” Ron looked positively outraged at this point, as if he were just a second away from standing up right there and now.
“Harry, are you ready to go?” he heard Hermione ask him from behind, turning around and closing his mouth with an audible clack.
Anyhow, he busied himself by fiddling with the magical adaptation of a toaster oven to reheat their breakfast and then setting up some plates for them to eat. He knew that Draco liked to have his with cream cheese, but he wasn’t going to go through his fridge.
"So you've mentioned," Malfoy said softly, looking away. "But we hardly even like each other. I feel like you didn't even think this through. Would you feel safe living with someone like
