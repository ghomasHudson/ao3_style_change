“So…?”
"I know Hermione, I know. I'll be careful. I have been so far. You don't have to worry, honest." Harry said, trying to calm his friend's frantic nerves.
“It was in the potions textbook I got at the beginning of this year.” He said.
“Would I?” Harry asked, genuinely concerned for what Draco thought of him.
“Take me home.”
Draco sighed happily. Maybe he didn't need to always be strong, maybe it was ok to be sick. And babied. He didn't mind Harry's immediate reaction to caring for him. In fact, he liked how much Harry cared about him and his health, even if it was just a stupid cold. And maybe Malfoys don't get sick, but Dracos do.
“What do you think it all means?” He asked Ron and Hermione after he told them all he could remember from what the proffessor had revealed to him.
“Almost.” Harry muttered.
“Mhmm.” Harry copied back.
As he made his way to Dumbledore’s office, he tried to remember everything Trelawney had said to him so he could tell his headmaster what happened as accurately as possible.
“You’re a shitty liar.” Malfoy pointed out.
After a while, Draco set down his book on his night table and looked over at Harry expectantly.
“And you can’t Accio it because…?” he teased, untying the letter from the owl, petting it lightly, then watching it fly back out the window.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Ok?”
“Fuck, Harry. I love when you call me that.”
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, it’s definitely different. We only just talked this morning. That’s when we decided to try us out, you know? And about what you said earlier, about me liking him, you’re right. I do. I really like him. He’s changed so much. He has this light about him now… I don’t know, ‘Mione. I just - I’m glad that we’re growing close.”
The trial resumed and Harry gripped the bench on which he sat, to prevent himself from loosing control when a few of the Wizengamont members made rude remarks towards Draco, or threw him dirty looks. Harry caught every one and willed himself to stay calm, or he knew he'd feel the wrath that Hermione possessed rain down on him.
“I’m being an inconsiderate bastard, and only thinking about myself. You want a normal relationship, and I’m making that practically impossible.”
“Oh, just wondering if I wanted to go for a pint later.”
Without another word, Draco stood up and fled the restaurant. Harry was quick on his tail, though.
“Hmm, hi Harry.” He smiled back, nuzzling deeper into the warmth and comfort that constantly radiated off of the raven.
“No! Harry-stop-I-can’t breathe!” Draco laughed. He fought a glorious battle, but didn’t stand a chance against Harry and his tickling hands.
That was the last Harry heard before he left the classroom.
Draco loved his job more than anything. He loved his clients, he loved that he could run the business how he wanted, he loved making people happy. He loved expressing himself through his work, while also helping those that were too shy to do it on their own. He gave people confidence, which was the most fulfilling part of his work.
Once they’d finished with Healer Walkins and obtained the pain relieving potion for Harry, they stopped off for a small lunch at a nearby cafe.
“Well, you’re going to tell her you love her and you’ll support her through this. You’re having a child, mate. The world isn’t ending.” Harry said, hoisting his best friend off his floor.
Now, as Draco stood in front of Harry like a FEAST, Harry was really concerned they hadn’t finished their intimate conversation.
Harry won the upper hand, by distracting Draco with a hand under his shirt, he pushed him down against the couch and, continuing to kiss him, slid his other hand under the shirt, eventually slipping it off of the blond.
“Are you mad?” Draco asked tentatively.
Draco, however, paled and looked almost panicked again. Harry just wanted to smooth the worry right out of his features. He opened his mouth to reply, then when no sound came out, quickly shut it again. He dropped his gaze to his fiddling hands and finally replied almost in a whisper, "I guess so. I don't really have a choice, or any other option for that matter."
Draco pinches his shoulder in a playful way, as he escorted Potter to his station.
Lo and behold a sneeze should tickle his sinuses. Draco had just enough time to stop kissing Harry and turn his head away before the sneeze exited his body, along with two others.
"I'm going to need you two to sign a few things for some confirmation and file purposes." Kingsley said, rounding his massive mahogany desk and began searching through some drawers. The boys were handed a piece of parchment each and quickly signed where they were directed too. "Oh and Mr. Malfoy, I think you'd like this back." Kingsley said, handing over a wand Harry didn't recognize. He immediately remembered he still had Draco's old Hawthorne one and reminded himself to return it to him. Draco's long, elegant and pale fingers gingerly grasped the wand and a sigh of relief escaped him.
“It will be ok, Ms Granger. You did a very good job coming to find him. I will be awarding you, but we should make our way up to the hospital wing, don’t you think?” She asked, then cast a patronus, alerting Professor Snape about his house member and godson.
“Good. You know I love you too much. Plus your arse is the best one there is, there’s no way I’d give it up for some sleezy fuck. Do you plan on arguing and fighting with me on avoidable issues just to cause me pain?”
“Thanks, Draco.”
Anger, disbelief, rejection kept ringing in Harry's ears as he thought of what the blond was thinking about him.
Draco day up and looked at Harry with assessing eyes. “That’s not fair. That’s so not fair.”
“Dr-Draco.” Harry murmured, his breath coming so quickly he felt light headed. He was about to get molested in front of his whole house by his rival. He did not think this was going to happen when he woke up this morning.
It dawned on him, that as they knelt there together kissing each other like their lives depended on it, they had never kissed yet. Not even at the end of their wedding ceremony.
“Are you forgetting something?” Malfoy smirked.
“I didn’t lecture you, I simply gave you a suggestion. Plus, we have this gorgeous, secluded beach all to ourselves, and you want to stay dressed? Hell, we could walk around naked whenever we want. We didn’t even need to bring clothes.”
A few moments later, Harry pulled away because he was seriously running out of oxygen, but when he looked into the grey abyss, he only saw remorse.
Back in the common room, Harry had all of 30 seconds before the portrait slammed open and Sanpe bellowed his name.
His emotions calmed, hearing all that from Granger. He still wanted to get this conversation over with. He’s had a long day for Merlin’s sake! “Ok, Granger. Let’s talk.”
Draco started, opening his eyes to see Harry over him.
Everything happened so suddenly.
Life isn’t fair though, and sometimes dreams can become a nightmarish realty. For Draco, that was exactly what he was feeling in this moment.
“Fucking, dammit Draco.” Harry said, releasing his wrists and letting him up. As soon as Draco sat up, Harry grabbed his cheeks and pulled him into a rough kiss, making out with him with all the passion he could muster. Eventually they pulled apart, breathing heavily.
“Sorry, I didn’t like the way he was eyeing you. I’m not a fan of Ted.” Potter said nonchalantly.
He stood in the gents, sobbing his heart out. Ron stood by the door in case anyone tried to come in, as Hermione ran soothing circles down his back.
Draco untangled himself and rolled over. He threw the blankets off of himself in a heap. Merlin, he was hot. His breathing came fast and ragged, and his sweat soaked through his silk pyjamas.
“Thanks so much, Kinsgley. I was hoping you had any job positions available for Draco and I. I was going to ask your receptionist, but I’m requesting that we be placed together or in close proximity. I’d like to be able to see or speak to him regularly throughout the day. I wasn’t sure if your receptionist could work that out for us.” Harry fidgeted with his seat, hands and shirt hem the whole time he spoke. He didn’t know if it was wise to interrupt Kingsley’s day to ask for a job, but he needed this.
Draco knocked, mainly just for respect. When he didn’t hear anything come from within, he tried the knob and realized it was unlocked. When he entered, Harry wasn’t in, but there were a couple chairs in the corner, as well as a decent couch off to the one wall. He sat and decided to wait for him.
"Alright, with that said, we're going to need to know where and with who you plan on staying, for file purposes, of course." Kingsley added, looking reserved.
“You didn’t kill him, Potter.” McGonagall sent furrowed brows in Snape’s direction. “He is under magical-medical care though, under close supervision. That spell was-”
“Merlin, yes.” Draco moaned, arching up into Harry’s caress.
He could just have inhaled a large amount of dust sometime the night before. Probably from that damned comforter.
“Another one?” Harry asked as he looked over it with furrowed brows.
“Hello, we’re here for our future employment training.” Harry said.
Draco sighed deeply before gritting his teeth and saying “I'm not getting sick. Malfoy's don't get sick.” He stood abruptly, grabbed his tea and swiftly left the kitchen, leaving behind an annoyed and deeply concerned Harry.
Calling it a room was an understatement. It was more like a suite. Malfoy had everything he needed, all to himself.
“Context, Draco.” Harry said.
“Did you claim me?” Draco said suddenly, a hint of panic in his voice.
To feel the flames lap at my skin
A little while later, as Harry was thinking about how to convince Draco, once again, that working would be a beneficial transition into adulthood, the door creaked open suddenly, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. A blonde head peeked in, and Harry could tell from the look in his eyes that he was calmer than he was before, if not a little sullen.
“Do it, ‘MIone. He does such brutal ones too.” Weasley said, pouting at his girlfriend.
“I’ll say it everyday if you want me too. I don’t think it’ll ever lose its meaning.” Harry replied.
Harry was walking to the Gryffindor common room after transfiguration, planning to spend his spare period there before lunch. Hermione said she had to talk to McGonagall about the essay they were given and what the particular outline was for it, and ways she could go above and beyond (its Hermione, what would you expect?), and Ron had stayed with her. They promised to meet him there when they were done. So, as he was strolling along the empty corridors (the next period had already started) to their nearby common room, he passed by Proffessor Trelawney, which was odd, seeing as he rarely ever saw her outside her classroom and maybe the great hall for meals, especially since it was during a period. Still, he nodded politely at the batty woman. She had a flash of a weird look pass across her features before she stopped and turned to him. Recognizing this as a sign that someone wants to talk to him, Harry stopped and turned to her with a question on his tongue. But before he could speak, a raspy, echoing voice sounded the halls that wasn’t anything like her regular airy voice.
As he was trying to think how much Harry has changed since they graduated a few months ago, the subject of his thoughts exited the bathroom and came to lie down beside him. Draco smiled at him and Harry smiled back, though a little strained. Draco wasn’t one to beat around the bush, he really wanted to know what was wrong with Harry.
Harry stood and walked in front of the blond. Seeing his Omega in distress had really brought out his Alpha instincts. He crouched down to see him better and took his hands in his own. “If you're lost, I'll find you.” And with that, Draco broke down and a heartbreaking sob filled the silence in the study. Harry slipped his arms around his waist and pulled him in for an embrace.
Draco faced out the window and swallowed the knot in his throat. They didn’t speak for the rest of the ride.
The Omega hadn’t spoke yet and Harry peered kindly into his eyes. He seemed deeply lost in thought, worrying his bottom lip desperately. So Harry gently grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him. They kissed and kissed and Harry poured his whole soul into it.
When Draco found the pilot to ask where they were and where they were to go, Harry continued to gaze around in awe. He had never been anywhere other than England and Scotland, especially not for a tropical vacation.
And Harry did.
Draco came first, spilling over his stomach, as Harry caught up, not too far behind. He pulled out and came on Draco’s stomach too, mixing their spunk together on the thin plane of Draco’s pale torso.
Draco hung up Potter’s cell phone and passed it back to him.
“Well, Ron and Hermione were here when you came in. She kept asking all these questions. She probably knows what’s going on, or will, as soon as she does some of her research. You know how she can get.” Draco replied, smoothing his hand down Harry’s arm.
“Maybe pool, but how about another game?” He said, watching Draco bend over the table. He sidled up behind him, putting his hands on his waist. “I’ll let you pick.” He said.
Harry grinned and padded through the kitchen. Being slightly taller than the blond, he was able to reach the mixer with ease. Something Draco frowned at. “Here you are. What are making?” He asked, following behind the blond who resumed a place in front of a large mixing bowl with many ingredients inside.
Pansy rolled her eyes, sipping her drink. “Men.”
Tears have come and gone all day, since I decided I’d pay him another visit. It’s been a few weeks since the last one. A few weeks since I said those too common words that rip both our hearts to pieces.
Harry sighed again. He considered their points and agreed that he needed to do something worthwhile. “Thanks guys, I really appreciate your help. But hey, keep your Fire Call on, ok?” He and Ron chuckled while Hermione rolled her eyes with a smile.
Harry sighed. He knew Malfoy didn’t know any better. He knew when he was truly terrified. Every emotion seemed amplified in his current state. Harry stepped forward and grabbed Malfoy’s hands to stop him from hurting himself. If he hurt Snape, now that was different…
“Malfoy!” Harry shouted when the blond had not followed him to leave for their morning classes.
Draco, startled from Harry’s presence, spun around with wide eyes before he quickly realized who it was. “Oh, um, yeah, could you? I can’t quite reach the mixer.” He said, smoothing out a dark plaid apron that covered most of his front.
Harry sat back and smiled at him for a moment before he replied with “I’m not entirely sure, but I think I’ve already found mine.”
Harry looked deeply into Draco’s eyes, adrenaline, fury and lust all mixed in a swirling pool of emotion within them. If he could only touch Harry just a little…
“Gay-Gryffindor?” he chokes out.
Drcao took it and returned the introduction. “Draco Malfoy.”
Twenty minutes had slipped by before a stout man with a pinstripe suit sauntered up to Sarah and asked for Draco Malfoy. She pointed towards him, who was the only one sitting in the Minister’s waiting area.
“Promise?” Malfoy bit his lip.
Walkins chuckled and smiled. “Mr Malfoy, a prophecy can’t make someone fall in love. Unless under a love potion, that is entirely their own doing.”
Harry sat down in the chair in front of the desk and sighed deeply.
Draco ducked his head. “I thought we were over that…”
as naked as the day his mother birthed him.
“You can do that?” Draco asked.
“Good point.”
“And you didn’t tell us?” Harry sounded slightly miffed.
“Stop complimenting me and kiss me already.”
“Ah, that’s how it always is.” She said, following him into the soft cushion. She patted his leg sympathetically.
“Got the git,” he said as he sat down. “A bloody nuisance he is.”
“Well, Ron, when a man and a man love each other-” Ron interrupted Harry though, throwing a pillow at him.
No, he thought. The amount of distance he would have to put between the two of them would most likely mean moving to a whole new country, possibly continent. That wasn’t an option he was willing to consider.
They both groaned deeply. Draco slowly thrust forward, as Harry scrambled at his arms and back.
He watched as Harry sat at his large desk and gestured for Draco to sit in the comfy armchair across from him. It was almost as if they were in a business meeting.
Nothing more was said as the two moved as one, chasing their releases together. They continued to kiss the whole time, until Draco clenched tightly around Harry, spurting his come over his chest. Harry soon followed, gasping draco’s name before spilling himself into his mate.
He dreamt the whole thing. He must have. That’s the only explanation for the blackness that coated everything and the warm comfort that surrounded his bones like sleep.
Harry broke the silence with “I'm not babying you and you're not fine. It started with last night and now today. You came home early, which you rarely do unless for good reason, and now you start coughing uncontrollably. You're getting sick and I don't want to watch you suffer. Now, you can either take a few potions or I can drag you to St. Mungos and you can explain to them what's going on.”
Draco went zooming into Harry’s lap before he’d even finished the request.
The temptation was too high.
Harry moaned, groaned, and fought himself from bucking his hips up too much. Draco continued his ministrations for a while before Harry shrieked above him that he was ready.
Of course he is, Draco thought. He’s an Ex Death Eater of Merlin’s sake! Why would anyone be proud of that?
“He was your Godfather, right?” Draco nodded. “Why are you making fun of him?”
“Ok, but would I be able to take it only when I’m not with Draco, or would it have to be a constant potion I’d have to take, like everyday?” Harry asked. He really hated taking potions.
He worked from 8 to 6, 6 days a week. Although his shop was always full with customers, hired employees, and sometimes volunteers, Draco felt alone.
"'Mione, its fine. Kingsley requested I step out for a minute to calm down, I guess." Harry replied, answering the unasked question.
He just needed a quick cold shower to cool himself off. He felt fine, aside from his burning skin. He didn't think anything of it, probably just his boyfriend’s skin’s oven-like tendencies to overheat his small body. Especially when they cuddled too close together. Plus it was June and they still had their big winter comforter on their bed.
“Kind of, yeah. What was it Walkins said?” Harry asked Draco.
Harry really didn’t want to frustrate her, so he continued begrudgingly. “Well, we talked about mates and I might’ve mentioned that I found mine and he asked so I told him that it was him and he said that I was his. Or so he thinks.” He decided to leave out the part where Draco had a panic attack and that he held him for several minutes. “So yeah. That happened. And we’re together now.” He looked up to see her expression.
Harry grabbed a towel and rubbed the batter off his face. He sighed as he stood. Instead of bothering the house-elf, he took out a wand and with a flick of his wrist, the kitchen was putting itself back in order. He then dragged himself up the stairs and shut himself in his study once again. He needed to think things over.
Dried, dressed in pyjamas, and snuggled up against his blond, hot cocoa in hand, Harry turned on Netflix, and began flipping through the different options.
“Mhmm, I know.” Harry smiles.
“Oh, the Mungo's visit.” Draco said.
“Dray, hey. Thought you got lost.” Potter said, rounding Draco where he was sitting.
Draco turned to stare at the oven as well before murmuring “I was just going to use magic.” He turned to look back at Harry.
“Of course... I want to bond with you. I want to be connected with you for the rest of our lives. You’re it for me. You’re truly my everything.” He whispered into Draco’s hair, and felt the blond exhale. “But, everything’s been moving so quickly with us, don’t you think?”
“What?” The two friends say, alerted.
“Not with this prophecy on us, you won’t.” Harry pinched his side lightly, the same side Draco had experienced pain in his lung.
“Yes, sir, and you will.” She says as she shoots out an arm to prevent him from passing her. “I just need to speak with you first.”
“‘Bout what?” Draco enquired.
Thank you so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed my work! :)
Harry waited patiently for Kingsley to finish. His job sounded great, much like what he was doing now at home. Just reviewing files for Kingsley and his many ideas to add and subtract minor details to the Ministry, Hogwarts, and its post war-efforts. It was very easy work, however, that was an owl every few days at least. He could imagine how much more he’d have to input his opinion into Kingsley’s archaically vicious attempts at reassuring the wizarding population of Europe that Voldemort was dead. It was done with. Why couldn’t people just move on now? Not to forget what happened, but to rejoice that it ended how it did and continue on with their lives they might not have had, had Harry misstepped slightly. He was just tired of constantly being reminded of the war and Voldemort and how he ruined almost everything.
“I’m going to bed.” Harry mumbled.
“Mhmm.”
Harry shrugged.
Harry was petting Draco’s head when he spoke from within Harry’s chest where his head was currently residing for warmth.
Hermione nodded in agreement. She and Ron tried telling him other things that might’ve changed Harry’s mind.
Draco glanced up through the stairwell and back towards Harry and the room beside his. He chewed his lip nervously before asking, just above a whisper "Is it alright - I mean - um - if I could - uh - have that one?" He quickly pointed to the spare room beside Harry's. "I mean, I don't want to be intruding in your space..." he started before he noticed the beaming grin hanging off Harry's face, then quietly faded out.
“Well…” Draco paused for a second before a huge grin broke out on his lips “It’s wonderful! How is it so soft? And the syrup? Wow! Just, wow.” He started cutting himself another piece as Harry broke out into a laugh.
“We have reservations for dinner tonight in the city, at eight o’clock.”
When he got to the hallway he knew the Minister’s office was on, he continued down the hallway till he came to Harry’s office. He knew it was Harry’s because on the door was his name in the same golden glow as Draco's was on his cupboard in the basement.
CLICK
“Yeah, kissing’s pretty friendly.” Draco said with a chuckle. “I'd like that.” He quietly responded. He started picking at his fingers as he remembered more of what he’d read. “There's still something I don't understand. I don't really know how it all works, but how do you know you’ve found your true mate?”
Draco sighed and lay down on the couch. He didn’t want to think anymore. It had been a stressful morning.
He entered the house and put his bag down at the door and carefully untied his expensive work shoes. He was about to go to the kitchen to make some tea, when he heard movement come from above.
As Harry began wiping his cheek frantically, he scootched a little bit away from the blond. “Malfoy.” He said. “Nice of you to finally join us, dressed.”
“Take me Harry, make me yours.” Draco whispered into his ear.
Harry crossed his arms and furrowed his brows in a defensive manner. “All of what?”
“Oh bugger off, you three. This isn’t my field of work. We can go ask Healer Walkins tomorrow. I’m sure she would know.”
“Why?” Draco asked skeptically.
“Harry. Listen to yourself! We do one thing, once, and now all of a sudden you’re all over me. You had to force yourself to be in the same room as me, just yesterday! A relationship based off of carnal desires is barely a relationship. I want communication and trust.”
"Yeah, alright. I'll see you tomorrow."
“I just had Kreacher fix it up with a few cleaning spells. Nothing big.” He shrugged, putting the cup down on the desk and slipping his hands in his pockets.
He threw a pillow at her.
Harry shut the door, promptly ignoring any further communication with his mate.
“That sounds like a great deal, Kingsley. I really appreciate it. I will let Draco know, and I’ll get back to you on what he decides. For myself, I’ll gladly accept the position you’ve offered. We can discuss hours and when we’ll start, soon.” Harry got up from his chair, indicating to the Minister that their meeting had come to an end. They shook hands, exchanged goodbyes, and parted ways.
Harry swallowed thickly, closing the door and slowly approaching the blond as if he’d attack at any moment.
“Ah, Harry, I was wondering when you’d come to visit me.” Dumbledore said with a large grin on his face.
“Harry….” Draco moaned. The pure feeling of lust radiating off of his Alpha.
“Dray,” Harry whispered, automatically tipping his head to the other side and closing his eyes.
“Mr Malfoy, I need to ask you some questions, please,” Madame Pomfrey begged. Once Malfoy was paying attention to her, Harry tried slipping out and returning to the common room where he could forget all of this, but Hermione’s other hand wrapped around his other arm.
When they broke apart, Draco was attentive and muttered three words Harry had not been expecting.
“Harry, is everything all right?” Draco asked, padding down the stairs as Ron continued to vomit in the bucket. “Ha, slugs.” Draco laughed, clearly thinking the same thing as Harry.
“But it’s not morni- oh.” then it dawned on him. “You’re pregnant?” he said quietly.
And with that, he sauntered out of the kitchen with a sway of his hips, leaving behind a grumbling Harry to finish his breakfast.
“Hmm.” He responds nonchalantly.
No one would have suspected a thing, Draco being discreet about his personal life with those around him. At least, if Harry didn’t have his arm tucked obnoxiously (though lovingly) around his waist, and the other resting on Draco’s other arm or hand when it wasn’t holding his glass.
I’m standing here, staring at the love of my life, my heart breaking for the millionth time. He takes my breath away, and it’s not because my lung capacity has diminished immensely after the two packs I had today.
Draco just waved him off and said “Yeah, just a bit hot is all. Go back to bed love, I'm fine.”
“Oh, very. I used to have quite the crush on you in Hogwarts, although now it’s definitely more.”
“Bloody fucking hell, Malfoy! What the fuck!” Harry began wiping at his mouth.
“Yeah, it’s bloody scary. You really fucked him up, Harry,” Dean commented.
Then he saw it.
Potter nodded in understanding. “I’m glad that you found something you love. At least one of us learned from the war.” Potter chuckled darkly.
“Isn’t that what we’ve been doing?” Draco asked with a raised brow.
The Omega was smirking. Smirking and grinning and Harry knew he knew that Harry knew just what he was up to. He strode over to Harry who was still in the bathroom doorway, grabbed his face, and pulled him into such a sexy, steamy kiss, his world just fell apart.
“Yeah, but the prophecy doesn’t know that.” Harry said. “It’s a big deal to ‘old P’ what we say to each other most of the time.”
“Yeah, alright. No, it has been nice having someone else around. Since Sirius left, it got a little lonely. Then with you and Mione moving in together, I felt a little left out. It’s stupid, I know, but Draco is so much, MAN, you know? Like he just fits in everything so perfectly. My hobbies, my habits, my life. I like him a lot.” Harry said, a dreamy look on his face.
And with that, he Apparated away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah Harry, it's me.”
Ron watched the exchange between his two friends before he spoke, "Umm, 'Mione, I know you're worried, but you should have a little more trust in Harry. I know he just flipped out on the Minister and Wizengamont, but he's managed to keep his magic in check, so far." He turned and addressed Harry, "And Harry, I know she can be a worrywart," he received a glare from Hermione for that, "but really she just doesn't want to see something bad happen to you." Ron finished with a sympathetic smile, gracing his freckled features. Harry looked at his best mate with a slight frown, but shared a tight-lipped smile nonetheless. Ron looked past Harry's shoulder towards the courtroom as he caught sight of one of the Aurors approaching them. "Now, they're calling you back in. Go and save the bloody ferret, once again." He said with an eye roll.
The backlash was for sure going to be negative. The Boy-Who-Lived found mate with Ex-Death Eater Malfoy. He knew Draco was so much more than his past and mistakes, but no one else would see that. The change from Malfoy the Prat to Draco the Precious was drastic, but nobody knew Draco like Harry did. And that’s why he decided to keep their relationship private. It was just better that way.
“No, you just keep running your mouth-” Ron fought.
Draco huffed. Still no response. He knew Harry wasn't ignoring him because only Draco was that petty when he was mad at Harry.
“So talk, Potter.”
They came together, the squeeze of Draco’s arse around his cock as he came, pushed Harry to follow a second behind him.
He also talked to the twins about their shop, and how businesses was blooming more than usual since Harry did an advertisement for them a few weeks back. He briefly conversed with Percy about new Ministry-related issues he didn’t care much about. And, of course, Harry talked to his practically adoptive parents, Molly and Aurther. They did so much to reassure him that everything will be fine, and they wouldn’t have so easily let him marry the Malfoy heir if they didn’t trust that he had changed. (Harry discreetly rolled his eyes at that.)
Harry knew what he was talking about. While they were holding each other in silence, he was able to think about all the blond had said. Especially how Draco thought that Harry was his mate.
“Have at it then.” Harry said with a smirk, passing Draco the remote.
"I'm not tired." Was Harry's response.
Sorry it’s such a short chapter, but it’s meant as a filler. I’ll try to make it more interesting soon.
"Mr. Malfoy, it has been brought to my attention that you currently don't have an accessible place of residence available to you." Kingsley began, as an auror moved to remove Draco's restraints, both magical and physical. Draco rubbed his wrists, as if they ached from the cuffs. Harry felt his chest twist again, his blood growing hot at the action. The blond looked at Kingsley with a raised brow. He didn't speak so Kingsley continued. "If you were unaware, Malfoy Manor has been seized by the Ministry, and it's unlikely it will return to your possession." The other eyebrow was raised and eyes grew wide. Still, the blond remained silent, so he went on. "Your mother now resides in one of your families properties in France. And as I've been told, you're aware that your father has been given the dementors kiss, yes?" The Minister asked, peering down at Draco.
Dreadful colour, he thought with disdain (mainly because he was in a shitty mood that he was here at all), silver would’ve been better.
Harry felt a slight twinge in his heart at that. “Of course I do, baby. I really do. We should just have time for us right now though, don’t you think? There’s no rush-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry? Is everything alright?” Draco tried peering into Harry’s eyes, but that only angered him.
“I know, baby, shhhh.” Harry tried to comfort the blond, bringing his face back to kiss it. After letting the blond relax, he pulled out a little and slowly pushed in again, repeating the action until he could pull out all the way and push in without Draco crying out.
Spearmint, soap and sugar immediately flooded Harry's senses. He indulged in them briefly before remembering his bushy-haired best friend's words, and 'flipped the switch' to block them out.
“Oh Merlin.” Harry groaned. “What-err, what did you, um see?” he kept shuffling around as he asked the blond. He was extremely embarrassed and mad at himself for being so stupid and careless.
Hermione slightly cocked her head to one side and said “Harry also told me about your wand. It was very nice of him to return it to you.”
I don’t have an immediate answer to his question, so I linger for a bit, gasping like a fish, trying to piece together words.
"Well, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy certainly can't just be dismissed because of a few mistakes." One of the Wizengamont jurists said.
“Diana, can you take the next customer? I’ve got a thing to take care of.” Draco called from across the open shop, emphasising ‘thing’.
Draco’s brows furrowed. “What do you mean.”
“HARRY! HARRY! Oh I’m going to be sick.”
Draco drifted off and averted his gaze back down to his shoes. Harry took this opportunity to try and comfort the Omega. He wrapped him back up in his burly embrace once again, holding the blond to his chest, feeling their heartbeats sync in a rhythmic pattern of thumps.
(See the end of the chapter for
From behind, he pulled Draco’s naked body against his clothed one.
He wanted to tell everyone about him and Draco, he wanted to scream it from the rooftops, write it all over the side of buildings and wear a sign on his chest telling the world that he had found his mate, his one true person. The only person he’s ever needed and will ever need.
He must’ve looked quite pitiful, standing there in a tieless suit, dressed sharply and handsome as ever, amongst the sweaty haired, tank-top clad mailing employees that watched him.
He sighed and made his way to sit on the armchair across from the couch. She turned to face him. “Ok, fine. I’ll talk, but just so we don’t upset Harry. I can’t take that right now.”
Draco seemed to deflate somewhat at that. He sat there silently for a minute. He didn’t bring up what Harry had said about his behaviour earlier that day, and he was actually glad about it. He must’ve came after that part. The blond had been all sorts of moody lately, and Harry really didn’t want to set him off anymore than he already had been. But only because Harry couldn’t handle it. He’d been on one hell of a rollercoaster lately, and his magic had been harder to control than normal. At breakfast, he lost control out of nowhere and the window they sat beside at the restaurant, shattered. They were never going back there again.
Oh my gosh it's long and fluffy and angsty I hope you guys like it. I tried to add more Alpha/Omega info in it. It took me too long to figure out how this chapter was going to go but here it is!
He walked over to his room and sat down on the bed. He soon found it was very comfy and his eyelids felt ten times heavier. He cast a quick Tempus charm: 8:05. He thought a nap would do him some good, seeing as he had a hell of a long day. First his trial, then Harry's defensive outburst, then more of his trial, then that discussion with Kingsley, then coming home with Harry Potter-
“Yeah, that’s all I want.” Harry said, shutting Draco down before he could plan a massive gathering that would be completely too big for his enjoyment.
“Did you come?” Draco asked breathlessly as the pulled away.
Draco woke up to a warm hand caressing his bare hip bone. He looked over and found Harry smiling gingerly at him.
Thank you so much for the wonderful reviews, I can't wait to share more for this story :)
“No.” Draco refused with a laugh.
Harry turned and glared back at Malfoy, who lowered his head again.
Harry rolled his eyes and Draco let his laugh break free.
Things between Harry and Draco are speeding up considerably. They get jobs. They make love. Vanilla smut ensues, nothing too explicit.
“Wrong.” Ron said simply.
“Do you know what I want to do to you?” Draco asked seductively.
“What're you doing?” Harry asked with a raised brow, not that Draco could see it, mind you.
“Oh, there's still time. I haven’t worked a day behind it yet.”
“But I thought… wait. You like me?”
Draco passed out from the intensity moments later.
“Harry, I love you-”
“Hey.” he didn’t even look up at him.
“I know, baby, I know. You want me inside of you?” Harry nodded frantically. “Ok then, sweetheart.”
Harry sighed. This was going to be horrible.
“I don't.. I don't know. My head hurts, my nose is all congested, I'm hot, and my body aches.” He said, pointing to whatever was wrong with him.
“It’s been a damn month! Why can’t they just leave it alone already?”
“We were planning my best escape route. Sorry, Harry.” he said with a grin. It was quickly wiped off his face as he felt a sharp pain jab into his left lung, causing him to clutch his side and lose his balance. Harry was beside him in an instant, holding him up.
Draco has already said his farewells. The limo was also packed. He had nothing left to do to distract himself from the painful look Harry was so vividly expressing to everyone. He couldn’t help but feel like this was all his fault, like he forced Harry into this. But he didn’t. He was in the same boat as Harry, but Harry was treating him like the shark-surrounded waters, ready to attack at the slightest movement.
“Oh, baby, I got that covered.” Harry said sweetly.
“I understand your concern, Mr Potter, however prophecies, curses and magical vows are tricky things to work with.” Walkins explains. “It will take some more research, consideration and time, we might just be able to figure out how to deal with the new information brought to light.”
“Draco? Draco...babe…”
“Yeah.” Harry whispered.
“Took your time, didn’t you?” Draco asked, not unkindly, only with the slightest hint of sourness.
“Stop, you fool! I’m hurting!” Draco said in between laughs.
The late morning sun shone delicately through the sheer curtains and onto the peacefully sleeping boys. It slowly roused them awake from their comfortable places, and reminded them where they had fallen asleep.
“You’re not doing this to avoid me, are you?”
“I-well, Harry found him and confronted him about the cursed necklace. Then he casted a spell he didn’t know, and Malfoy started acting all weird, then Harry ran away. I came looking for Malfoy to make sure he was ok, but I found him unconscious. I- I don’t know what happened.” Hermione was visibly shaken, not crying, but clearly upset about what happened.
“Don’t you think you should be with her right now.” He asked.
He sat on the bed as he watched Harry strip off his shirt and move to the bathroom to wash up. He admired the lean muscles that shone proudly on his back, the dark skin encasing them against his bones. He wanted to touch, to run his fingers over them to feel how strong they really were; he wanted to taste, to lick and suck at the supple skin...
“What? What else?” Harry questioned heatedly.
However many minutes later, they pulled apart looking deep into each other’s eyes, breathless and hotter than any other time they made out. That’s when he did it, the little snake.
They both avoided each other for the rest of the night. Neither of them went to make dinner or try to seek out the other, so when they both went to bed the last words they spoke to each other still lingered in the kitchen.
“Because you’re still in the beginning stages of your manifestation. Everything for you is heightened right now. I’m saying no right now because if I said yes right now and you later regretted it once everything calmed down, I wouldn’t be able to lose you like that.”
“What are you thinking?” Malfoy suddenly asked from beside Harry.
“You sure?”
Harry groaned. “How are you so perfect?”
“Nice?” He inquired.
Harry thrust in deeper. “I know baby, I know. You’re taking me so well, though.” Harry groaned.
Harry drew them a bath with healing and skin-softening potions. They both sat in the warm water, Draco’s back pressed against Harry’s chest. Harry rubbed a soft cloth over Draco, letting the water and potions sink in and do their jobs. Draco hummed.
“That we’re Alpha and Omega.”
“Ah, well, in that case, we might need to use a pensieve memory. But, that will come after lunch. Now, don’t you have a potions assignment to start?” He said with a knowing glint in his eyes.
Eight...all magic
“Actually, Professor Snape, I have a question to ask.” Harry ran after the Head Slytherin.
Draco spoke up for the first time in a while and said “Could you maybe bring me some tea.”
And waited.
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione said, coming down the stairs. She strode right over to Harry and hugged him tightly, however, nothing like the embrace Ron and Harry had shared.
“There, there he is, Mr Malfoy. Here he comes.” Madame Pomfrey tried to calm the blond, but he wasn’t having it.
“-and I came across some really interesting information. Now, I would like a second opinion, but the whole thing makes sense, albeit a bit dramatic. So, after what Draco told me yesterday, what you guys were talking about when you had the seizure, it makes sense as to why the ‘seizure’ occurred.” she had put air quotes around the word ‘seizure’.
“Want to fuck me?” He whispered in the blond’s ear. “I miss your body..”
Draco, gasping with tears spilling down his cheeks right after Harry pulled two back-to-back orgasms from him, was one of the most beautiful sights Harry had ever seen.
Now that took Harry by surprise a little bit. He didn’t have an answer for that one.
Draco hummed. He leaned his head against Harry’s and closed his eyes. “A place for only our family.” He said. He was exhausted from the day’s events of packing and travelling, he wasn’t paying complete attention to what he was saying.
“Where do you think you’re going?” Draco shouted after him.
“Finnegan, you utter plebeian. I am thoroughly disgusted by your childish antics you clearly haven’t grown out of since our time at Hogwarts. I am ashamed to say that I had the displeasure of knowing your immature arse. Never pull a stunt like that again on Potter, or YOU will be on the receiving end of MY wand. This is Draco Malfoy, by the way. Get checked, you Irish clown.”
“Malfoy,” Harry started, watching Malfoy whip around fast to face his opponent. “You cursed her, didn’t you? The necklace, the one Katie had.”
Once his body stopped, a few minutes later, Draco grabbed his wand and immediately sent a patronus to St. Mungos to hopefully get an emergency team to help transport Harry to the hospital. He gently laid the rest of Harry down on the bed, slipped on a pair of underpants, put a pair on Harry too, and by that time four medi-wizards were bounding up the stairs to where Draco was calling to them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco woke up burning again, and this time with a headache. Except now, he only had the sheet covering him, and Harry off to his side of the bed.
“Oh,” Harry caught on. “No, baby, I didn’t. If we’re to be bonded, we wait until then to mark you as mine.” Harry said.
“I want to. And, if we don’t do it now, I don’t know when I’ll be ready again.”
“You won’t leave me alone until you get what you want, eh?” Harry said with a sigh.
“I, well, Proffessor Trelawney stopped me in the hall today and said something to me. I’m just confused with what it means and what’s going to happen.”
“Dra-” Potter began, but Draco stopped him with a finger poke to the chest.
Quickly, in their urgent state of arousal, they spelled off their clothes and rearranged themselves so Draco was kneeling, his arse up and on display for Harry.
But he wasn't sick. Malfoy's don't get sick.
And waited.
“Ha-harry? What..” Draco stopped too, placing a hand to Harry’s chest.
“Thank you, I did it myself.”
They finished dinner without any more mishaps. Harry got a parchment from McGonagall stating their new schedule, and their living arrangements.
He groaned. “Ok, c’mon then, Malfoy.” This was going to be humiliating.
“Fuck me, babe, oh my lord, Draco. Fuck!” Harry cried.
Harry was just about to comment ‘as long as it keeps you quiet,’ before Malfoy leaned in ever so slightly and brought their lips together. Because of the awkward position and the fact that he was tied up, he ended up leaning against Harry like a stiff board.
Later at the pub, surrounded by a bunch of Gryffindors, Draco sipped his whiskey while softly resting his hand on Harry’s leg.
Draco thought for a moment then replied with "Not since I was young, three, maybe? I don't remember much, if anything at all. Just that it's dark and damp, oh, and that horrid house-elf."
Draco sighed. He grabbed Harry’s hand and held on to it for a minute. “Ok.” He finally agreed. “I’ll indulge in your little dates, you big sap.”
“You fucked him, didn’t you?” Pansy assumed.
“Ahh! Oh, Harry. You scared me, you git!” Draco retorted back.
Ron Levitated him to sit down beside him. “I will set you free because I’m not feeding you. But if you make so much as shift towards Harry, I will bind you back up and drown you in the Black Lake. Got it?” Ron said.
They both stood there, Harry speechless and Draco panting like he just ran a 5k run.
“You can tell me, Dray…” Harry said, rubbing his husband’s arm.
He needed to write down the uses of Flobberworm skin and Scarab Beetle scales and what type of reaction they make when combined; whether combustion, with fire, or gaseous, with smoke. He’d once read somewhere once that when Scarab Beetles were mixed with another ingredient, he could make homemade stink bombs. Now whether that was Flobberworms or stink bugs, he wasn’t sure. Because on one hand, stink bugs were notorious for their stench, but Flobberworms, on the other, were so putrid-
“I promised her I wouldn’t. It’s not my news to tell.” Draco finished, his nose upturned, such Malfoian grace coming from that gesture alone.
“Hmm, something like that.” Draco said, switching to Harry’s other side.
Draco glared at him before attempting to extract himself from Harry’s big hands. It was impossible to talk to this man seriously, Draco discovered.
“I never asked you what your dream was.” Draco said after a long time.
When he was done flipping through his many poetry books, he finally looked over to the few magical creature ones he brought out and winced. It's not that he didn't want to learn about it all, it’s just that then he’d finally have to accept his fate.
Harry's other hand came up and brushed some of the platinum locks back and away from his face. “Draco?” He repeated.
“Are you going to touch me, Harry?” Draco asked, gently brushing a strand of hair out of Harry's eyes.
“Wait, you saw that?” Harry called after him.
Harry pushed Draco onto the bed, unbuttoned his trousers, and pulled them off swiftly. He pulled off his own pants and knelt down in front of Draco’s legs.
Harry looked conflicted for a moment before saying “I don't think hot tea is good for you right now. But I can cool it down for you first.” Draco smiled sweetly and nodded. “And I can make you some of Molly’s famous chicken noodle soup. I know you like that.” Draco nodded again, more vigorously this time. “Ok love, you stay here. I'll be right back.” He kissed his head again before exiting the bedroom and making his way to the kitchen.
Draco felt bad for bringing it back up, and with the look on Harry’s face, so was he. “No, I’m sorry Harry. I didn’t mean it like that. I was just worried.” He tried to peer into Harry’s face. “Can - do you forgive me? I really didn’t mean it.”
“So, now we’re going to be in pain for the rest of our lives.” Harry said glumly.
They ate in a comfortable silence for a while, before Harry decided to break it. “So, I was thinking…”
“Because you haven’t come in yet.”
“Oh, good, cause I was debating on how we could break this prophecy so you didn’t have to deal with me, as I clearly thought that’s how you felt.” Draco responded truthfully. Harry had climbed into bed beside him and he was now combing his fingers through his unruly hair.
The next morning, Harry woke up with spearmint, soap and sugar intoxicating his senses and an unfamiliar but not unwelcome warmth pressing against his back. Blocking out the scent as usual, he turned over and found a tuft of blond hair peeking out above the sheets. He chuckled to himself before nudging the body. “Draco.” Nothing. “Draco.” Again, nothing. Harry pulled the blankets back to reveal a soft-looking Draco Malfoy, and not his usual pointed look.
“He told you to fuck off.” Harry growled lowly. “Or are you just too thick-skulled to have gotten the message?” Harry said, clearly squeezing the man's throat. The man was grabbing and grappling at the wall behind himself, clearly trying to support himself from the hand that was slowly squeezing the life from him.
Once they were ready, they stopped at the  doors and looked at each other.
Draco jolted awake as he felt the mattress move beneath him.
“What about you? And our plans tonight?” He hadn’t seen Ron in a long time, busy with whatever Kingsley had him working on, and Ron had just started Auror training. He also avoided public outings as much as possible, and he absolutely hated being far from Draco for any amount of time. Going out for a pint with Ron would be amazing, but only if Draco was with him too.
“I was just thinking about what we’re going to do when we come back into this room tonight.”
“Dray.” Harry whispered as Draco went to attack his neck.
Draco shrugged, putting his drink down and grabbing a cue off the wall behind him. He rubbed chalk on the cue, set up the table, and began playing, all while Harry watched from the bar a few feet away.
“So how is ferret doing? You guys have taken quite the blow recently with the Prophet and everything. How’re you taking it?”
He never thought his life would end up like this.
Draco leaned into the slight touch before Harry's hand uncurled and he cupped Draco's cheek.
Draco just winced as he picked up one of the flabby cake things and plopped it onto his plate. He drizzled some of the syrup on top, cut a small piece off and brought it to his mouth. He looked up to see Harry watching him intently. With a raised eyebrow, he bit into it -
“What?”
“I’m not as dirty as you.” Harry laughed. Merlin, he loved the way Draco looked.
“How is it… you always know…. how to get… under my skin?” Harry asked, gulping down Draco’s scent.
“I love you so much, baby. You were so good for me, so good sweetheart.” Draco peppered kisses all over Harry’s face and neck, rubbing soft hands over the overworked body.
“You think I would have let him fuck me again if that’s all I was to him?” Draco asked her back, picking apart his croissant that she brought him.
That’s when Fleur, with their tiny baby nestled peacefully in her arms, pulled Bill away from the table where the two had been sitting for so long.
He stood, stretched, and padded towards the door. He knocked a few times, but when there was no response, he opened the door to just a sliver so Draco could hear him better.
Harry didn’t know this yet, and Draco intended on keeping it a little secret for now. He knew Harry wouldn’t feel any different if Draco told him, but just in case, he didn’t want Harry to shut him out like he did with his scent.
He scrunched his face up before muttering “I’m sleeping.” and pulled the blankets over himself again.
“What? About why?”
“Stop staring.” Harry muttered at the two of them, while he poured himself a cup of tea.
He tailored to all sorts of styles, but was a king with colour. Literally. His clients named him ‘the King of Colour’™️.
“I believe the prophecy is based around you and Mr Malfoy, and you think this as well, I presume?”
“Are you mental?” Ron quipped. “First, that slimy git doesn’t need our help, and second, do you really think he’d do the same for us?”
Harry attempted to lift his hips up to touch his cock, but Draco was thrusting so powerfully, he wasn’t able to manage it.
“Are you ready to go? The limo’s waiting out front to take us to the airport.” Draco gestured briefly behind him.
And like that they slept into the late hours of the morning.
“Look, kid, I don’t have all the answers to your damn questions. You have to finish all that before you go; I suggest you get started.” Jonathan said.
That was until Harry came out later and sat beside him.
"Yes, sir." Draco replied quietly with a tight nod. His expression was back to his calm 'n cool Malfoy mask, although less pointy than Harry remembered.
“Oh, Miss, I would like to know if you’re aware of any new updates with Harry Potter?” he asked politely.
“Yeah, but you’re good at saving the wizarding world, it’s something you were smart to pursue because no one can do it like you can.” Draco said, emphasising with hand gestures.
“Pleasure.” He said sassily.
“And mate.” Draco smiled.
“Yes, but I still knew it was a bad idea.” Draco smiled and placed kissed Harry’s head.
“Morning.” Draco stretched out like a cat, and the warm hand expanded its territory by gliding up and down his sides.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to say no because that would absolutely crush Draco; but it would also be untrue, because he did want to. It was actually what they were supposed to do- an Alpha bond with his Omega.
He gets up, rummages in his drawer for a second and walks over with a small velvet box.
“Of course it is. He’s the only one I’ve ever been with.”
“What has gotten into you?” Draco giggled as he pushed Harry’s head away. “You, stay put. I’m going to shower.” And with that he closed the door and stripped.
Draco stood up immediately, Hermione and Ron right behind him. “Where is he? I need to see him.” Draco says, already making his way past her.
“Um, I don’t - I don’t think so. I just have to finish mixing this, and then put it in the oven.”
“Want you now…” Malfoy whispered, cupping his hand behind Harry’s neck, looking down at his lips as he leaned forward.
“I’m sure we’ll be able to go home soon, love. Your health is the most important thing at hand.”
“Crystal clear.” Malfoy murmured.
“What-What was that?” Harry asked breathlessly.
She finished, breathlessly, looking at the pair with wide eyes, pleading for them to understand.
“What about memos? Those normally contain emergency information, no?”
"Knowing you, you're probably being to forward with your questions. You should let him come to you. He's just really flustered, you know, being under the same roof as an Alpha and all." She said back to him.
Draco sighs. He pears back into the shop to see everyone working and everything looking alright. He decides to indulge in Potter and what he has to say. He’s always been more lenient when it comes to him, anyways.
“Ok, ok. Don’t worry. Everything will be ok. Do you need some water? Are you going to be sick again?”
“Yeah, I just got here.”
They came within seconds.
“Harry?” Both Ron and Hermione’s voices could be heard from different places in the house. They came by after dropping their luggage and things at Grimmauld Place. They still hadn't decided on where they were going to live, but they decided to stay there temporarily until they found a place of their own.
“I was really concerned as to why this happened, seeing as Harry has had no previous experiences with seizures. So, naturally, I took to my books and found out that- oh, hi Harry. How are you feeling?” she said upon entering the room.
“I never hated you like I do right now.” He responds immediately.
Draco’s cheeks heated and he ducked his head into Harry’s neck. Strong arms tightened around him further. “Me too.” He mumbled.
Harry chuckled. “I just wanted to check in. I’m in the mood for take out; anything you want?” He asked politely.
“Do you really?” Draco questioned with a skeptical eyebrow.
When Draco looked out the window from the sitting area to see Harry’s naked arse being submerged in the ocean, he nearly fell out of his chair.
“I’ve always wanted a family that loved me.” He whispered brokenly.
“That’s bold, seeing as you want me to fall in love with you the second you reveal your feelings to me.”
"Ahh."
Draco broke off with a slight gasp. “I actually have to talk to you about something.”
“Oh, please! You think I’m some damsel in distress?” he clicks his tongue. “You asked me out, remember? Call me when you get over yourself.”
“Woah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You think, actually and genuinely think, that I did this on purpose?!” Harry stood in shock, regarding his Professor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione nodded. She told them he was in the common room and offered to send a patronus to get him to come up.
“Are you going to undress me, Harry?” Draco asked, referring to his trousers and pants that were still on him.
“Potter, what brings you in today?”
Harry glanced quickly at Draco before nodding. “Where do we go from here. I’m exhausted and want to sleep in a proper bed.”
Hermione smiled and Ron looked sheepish.
Draco could practically hear Harry smiling.
Just as Malfoy’s hands started creeping up higher, he was lifted up off the ground and away from Harry. Harry looked up to see Ron holding a perturbed Draco Malfoy.
He got out of the bed and unlocked the door. “Hi ‘Mione. Sorry, I just needed to get out for a minute.”
.....
Draco didn’t want Harry to feel pain, but he couldn’t exactly make him fall in love with him either. He tried that, and he truly thought they were close enough. Clearly not.
Dumbledore had led Harry to his pensive and removed the memory of the bizarre interaction between him and prophecy-telling Trelawney. Dumbledore had watched it through first, and when he surfaced, he didn’t have the usual knowing glint in his eyes. He beckoned Malfoy forward.
“Harry.” Draco moaned, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist and grinding up against him.
“W-wha… what?” Harry stumbled.
Harry laughed again before asking “Not much of a morning person, are you?”
“You never answered the question.” Weasley said, narrowing his eyes.
But, he couldn’t help feeling sorry for him. He knew what it was like to not have a crush reciprocated, he knew what it was like to feel lost and helpless.
“Oh Merlin, Harry, you’re so hot. What you did to the man back there, mmmh, I’ve never gotten so hard so quickly before.” Draco said, gasping as Harry attacked his neck at full force.
“Mhmm.” Was Harry’s only reply.
The little Omega’s cheeks turned a brilliant red and his eyes widened dramatically.
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco said as he rubbed his eyes, a few more tears spilling out. “That was incredible.”
“I’m going to make love to you, now.” Harry said, kissing Draco full on the mouth.
And then it hit him, Draco. His mind just registered what he said, and he shattered.
When he woke up to the smell of bacon and eggs with a side of fresh Omega, he knew this was going to be harder than he thought.
“Where is he now?” Hermione asked.
“Oh, but my dear, that makes it even better.” Malfoy said.
“Thank you so much for that assessment Ronald, I so needed your input on this situation.” Harry replied sarcastically.
“Hi, Harry,” Malfoy responded. He started over towards Harry, a light airy touch to his step.
Harry hummed. “And what about your neck?” He asked as he moved his lips to the small section showing above Draco’s collar.
“Ah ah, no touching.” Draco smirked. “This is reserved... for my bonded.”
A good full minute went by before Harry spoke. “What do you think?”
Draco chuckled. “No.”
“Yeah, it was so great to see them.” Harry said happily.
“What do you mean?”
“Do you plan on leaving me?” Draco asked, apropos to absolutely nothing.
Draco smiled back and said “Surprise me.”
Despite them not getting any information to ease their worries, Harry and Draco relaxed into the night with their friends.
“I’m not...prepared.” Draco said, voice shaking slightly.
Neither of them knew where they were, seeing as Draco’s parents picked the destination for them, since they were using their private plane to get there.
“Good idea. Boy’s heavier than he looks.” Ron said with a grunt.
He may have control, but he’s still a beast. He hoisted the blond up around his hips, walked over to the bed, threw him down, crawled over top, and made out with him like never before. He didn’t touch him aside from kissing though, seeing as how Draco made it clear from before, that he wanted to talk to Harry before they did anything too serious. Maybe he just needed to be put in his place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco obviously knew it had to be a nightmare. He had his own, but nothing like that. He nodded before asking “War?” He turned to see Harry nod, but no words came from him. He sighed before patting Harry’s leg. “Try and get some sleep.” He said as he made his way to stand.
He trails kisses as he lowers himself down Harry’s body. When he gets to Harry’s cock, he grasps it firmly and places little kitten lick all over it. Truth be told he’d never sucked off another bloke, let alone shagged one. He does his best to remember how Harry did it the first time, and before long, he’s having his hair pulled at and warnings of Harry’s orgasm being whispered above him. He reluctantly pulled off of the throbbing gem and licked it a few times before he announced:
“Wha- you’ve never had pancakes?” Draco just shook his head. “Well, you are today. Sit, they’re done.”
“What? Why?”
“Ok...ok Harry…I have to go…” Finally he pulls away, pressing a hand to Harry’s chest. “I’ll see you soon.”
“I mean, we've been quite civil with each other, I’d even say friendly. I'd like to get to know you Draco.” Harry said with a smile.
And for how often she gossiped, you’d think she couldn’t keep a secret. That’s the thing, the girl could definitely keep a secret when she wanted to. So, Draco trusted her. She did keep the secret that he was gay from their third year when he found out, until he decided to come out in their eighth year.
“It’s been great. I miss sleeping in my own bed, you know?”
“I’m going to the washroom.” He stood abruptly, the hand falling from his lap. “Don’t follow me.” He whispered directly at his new husband. With that, he left the room and retreated back to the room he had first been lead to, where he got ready for this very unfortunate event. He sighed as he entered, locking the doors behind him and all but collapsing into the king-sized bed that lay in the middle of the room. He let the soft sheets and blankets surround him in a comforting manner, minorly relaxing his stresses. He didn’t intend to fall asleep, but as he closed his eyes and started drifting off, a soft knocking was heard at the door. He stayed silent, in hopes that whoever it was would leave. A familiar voice broke through.
“Ah! Harry!” Draco cried, bucking up violently. Harry pressed a hand over his hips to keep them down, before swallowing him again.
It was open. He gingerly stepped in and peered around inside. He fumbled for his wand and casted a quick Lumos before finding a switch, similar to the one in the bathroom and flicked it. The room suddenly filled with light and he put his wand away. The room was a decent size and bookshelves filled with books and trinkets lined every wall. A sofa and a few arm chairs sat in a circle in front of the only window in the room. A desk and chair sat against a part of a wall not covered by a large bookshelf. A small framed photo of 4 boys around their age, hung above it. All the furniture was covered in sheets, indicating that this room wasn't used and hadn't been used in a while, if the fine layer of dust was anything to go by.
Harry didn’t look at Draco at all while he spoke. He either looked out at sea or down at the sand beneath him. When finished, he was out of breath.
“No, I think I’ve got them.” He said confidently.
Basically this story was written as an experiment to try a new writing style (kind of). I focused mainly on Harry and Draco finding ways to overcome their issues as a forced couple without resulting in violence or full on avoidance. In this fic, they compromise and accept their fate, realizing later on that they were the best people to have been in this predicament. I don't see this fic going anywhere else so I'm thinking of ending it here. Please let me know if there is any idea you might want added, and i'll consider expanding this storyline. As of now, Here is another finished fic :)
“I don’t know, he seemed pretty determined to be with Harry.” Neville said, shakily.
“You wanna bet?” Draco teased, trying to tickle Harry with his long fingers.
A week had passed and everything was going really well to Harry’s surprise. He was a little worried about Draco falling back into the ignorant git he used to be, but Draco proved him wrong. He was extremely helpful now that he was more comfortable being around Harry. He’d helped organize a schedule for Harry, sorted through his mail with him, even went as far as arranging meetings with Kingsley and other important Ministry members.
“You’re lucky it wasn’t the coffee table atlas.” He said.
Harry spoke immediately. “Think harder, Draco. Unlike myself, we both know you’ve got a brain in there bouncing around with an answer.”
Draco's eyes widened as his eyebrows practically disappeared into his hair. Kingsley just grinned. "Thank you for the offer Harry, that's very generous of you. That is a fantastic idea, as long as Mr. Malfoy is ok with it." Kingsley replied.
He nodded towards the kitchen. “Yeah. Would you like a cuppa? We can talk in there.” He turned back to Draco. “Come on.”
“Dray…”
“Meeting someone tonight?” Ted asked gruffly. He had a thing for Draco ever since he started coming here. Aside from a few chats and rounds of pool, they never really talked that much. Draco wasn’t particularly interested in Ted, but he was still nice to him.
He hated when she did that. And by that, he means give him every reason to rethink his feelings or perceptions.
“It’s been over a week since you talked to Shacklebolt, and there hasn’t been any word about us since. I’m not going to hide in this house forever. I’m going mad!”
“...so now I work for PSIMS. My line of work, in the bloody Ministry of Magic, is called PSIMS. I am so over this. I quit.”
“I understand, Harry, and I will do everything I can to help you and Mr Malfoy. I will speak to the Prophet’s editors and tell them to shut it down.” Kingsley wrote something down on a piece of parchment before returning back to Harry. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
Draco nodded and then followed Harry out of the kitchen and up to his study. Once in, he was able to get a good look around him. A beige colour filled the walls with dark red accents all around the room. A large fireplace with a mantle covered in photos faced the door and the scent of oak wood flooded his senses. It was purely Harry and very Gryffindorish.
“You are impossible.” Harry laughed, wrapping an arm around his husband. “Hermione’s pregnant, apparently. Ron just came to tell us, but it looks like he panicked.”
Harry nodded. “Come with me.”
“It is a fair punishment. You should not be dueling outside of class, no matter the situation. Especially unprovoked.” McGonagall stated from behind her desk.
“What, um, are we…?”
He slowly divested the pink-haired man underneath him of his clothing, caressing his pale body softly and littered it with kisses and kitten-licks.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. You’ve got an isle to walk down in about thirty seconds.”
"It's fine, Draco. You live here now, you can have this room all to yourself. I don't use it."
“I knew you’d come back for me.” He said.
Hands roamed, hips grinded and lips collided.
Draco just flopped back down on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling. “My husband is being controlled by magic.”
“I think he can.” Draco responded timidly.
“Definitely.”
“Harry’s not here right now- he had a meeting with the minister about a promotion or something.” Weasley said, seemingly brushing it off. Jealousy? Draco amended. Maybe.
“I damn well hope so, because I want to go home.” Harry said loudly, catching Draco’s attention. He put his hand over Harry’s arm in a calming gesture. He nodded reassuringly when Harry looked his way.
“What are we doing?” Draco asked Harry.
He pushes all thoughts of love and happiness into the reserves of his mind and focuses on only causing pleasure and relief to his high strung penis.
“Regrettably, yes. I wish we weren’t here, but back in our rooms, rubbing and humping-”
Harry stared back at her in shock. "Wha- it's not like I'm going to attack him or something!? Quite the opposite actually." Ron grimaced while Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco stared at Harry with what looked like guilt and worry. He looked scared to even speak to the raven, so Harry started for him.
Another big smile crept its way across Harry's lips. "Do you want me to go?" He asked.
Since the incident, when he found out Malfoy had feelings for him, it felt… good. He liked being liked, he enjoyed having someone want him. He had never had that before. Even if it was a boy, even if it was Malfoy.
Harry nodded, almost loosing himself in the smokey gaze. "Yes, we can do that too."
“You said there was a ‘fog’ that left his eyes, right? Traces of magic involved? That was no prank, harry. It had to do with the spell, and if he dies or gets seriously hurt, you’ll be in a lot of trouble.”
“You ok?” Draco grounded out as he struggled to not move more of his cock into Harry before he stopped.
“No, you’re absolutely correct, Mr Potter. From what Healer Marigold has told me, your health has improved majorly since last night. I want to run a few diagnostic tests as well as prescribe some replenative and preventative potions from making this worse than it is. If all is well, you’re good to head home.” Walkins says with a smile.
He grunted. “Draco…” it may have sounded like a warning, but Draco took it as an incentive to continue.
“Just thought I’d come say hi.” Draco lied.
Draco had settled into a crouched position on the boardwalk, with the heels of his palms pressing into his eyes.
As the reception commenced, with family and friends gathered together, one would consider this a joyous occasion. Harry and his two best friends however, did not. Draco was off greeting and thanking everyone for coming to their -forced- wedding.
Draco closed his mouth but his eyebrows were still raised when he asked “Which part?”
The little Omega bit his lip and closed his eyes. He reached up and held Harry's hand in his own, so it was trapped between his cheek and hand.
However, when Harry and Draco moved in together, the old estate seemed to change. The rooms were brighter, the air lighter, and the halls filled with sounds of laughter and joy almost all hours of the day.
He wiggles aggressively out of Potters grasp. “We aren’t together. We’re just here to play some pool. I’ve played more games with Ted than I have with you. So on the part of hanging out, there’s more between Ted and I, then us.” Draco said defiantly.
“I never needed you like I do right now.” Tears spill and I feel angry with myself for reminding him.
The morning of the interview, Harry was meant to meet the reporter in a small cafe a few blocks west of his home. As he was getting ready to leave, he saw Draco shifting on his feet by the door, his bottom lip pulled in between his pearly white teeth, his eyes cast down at his shoes and his eyebrows furrowed. He looked worried.
“Harry.”
Harry woke that night from a restful sleep to the sound of Ron coming from the living room. Draco stirred beside him, also waking up.
Malfoy came out a moment later -
“And mate.” Harry added.
“Again, I’m not sure, but seeing the effects of it with your guys’ case, I wouldn't be surprised. This prophecy seems to have such major control over you two, but I would consult with Healer Walkins again. She knows her stuff.”
Harry glared up at him then, clearly not enjoying the game Draco had in mind.
Although they had briefly mentioned sex between them, it hadn’t been brought up again. The week had been extremely busy, and Draco had come down with a nasty fever the day after Harry met with the Minister. They both skipped the ball for St. Mungo’s, Draco being too sick and Harry insisting on staying home to take care of him. Draco felt bad, but Harry promised many more galas and balls in their future.
“I don’t know what you want from me, Draco. You didn’t seem so perturbed when I offered the idea earlier. It’s a good way to make friends and yes, socialize. If that requires interacting with people who have the SAME job as you, then do so. I can’t be your only friend. You’d go mad.” Harry tried for a little bit of humour, but his grin died away after seeing the glare Draco threw his way.
The halls of 12 Grimmauld Place were usually silent, faint whispers coming from the few portraits that littered the dusty walls every now and then.
“If we keep doing this, my lungs are going to shrivel up and die.” I say, breaking the ever increasing silence around us.
She nodded, eyebrows drawn together as she thought hard about something.
“Yes, I do.”
Although he did say he was going to try to be better with Draco, Draco knew that it wasn’t Harry’s idea, nor was he really willing to do it. He did it because his friends asked him to, not because he wanted Draco. Not like how Draco wanted him to.
“Just say you’re going to fuck me. Please.” Draco said, slightly hysterical.
“You are a wicked, wicked woman. Fine, something did happen. And yes, it was intimate. And yes, he did treat me really fucking well. And yes, I may be totally, irreversibly in love with him. But that gives you no right to spread my life through your spiderwebs of lies that cling to the Ministry’s black walls, Parkinson.”
Draco looked up from his vacant station to see who had walked in. He didn't expect to see his school-rival from Hogwarts, standing in the middle of his shop, looking slightly lost.
As soon as Draco Malfoy walked into the courtroom, Harry Potter's senses were assaulted with a scent like no other. One that could only be described as purely Draco Malfoy. Something similar to spearmint, soap and maybe sugar?
“Do you think it’s a common occurrence?” Harry asked.
He smelt him.
Draco glanced at the food and slowly approached the table. He carefully sat down on the bench and slowly picked up his fork. With that he dug into his meal, pristine and proper, unlike the messy Griffyndor across from him.
“Ok, but just kissing.” They kissed.
“Mm mm.” Harry replied, shaking his head.
They made their way into the bathroom, Malfoy’s arms staying put around Harry. He sat the blond down on the small bench that sat across from the shower, muttered a ‘stay out,’ hopped into the shower, shut the curtain, took off his robe, and turned the water on.
Oh damn. There goes a twitch. And another one as Harry tightened his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco squirmed uncomfortably to hide the fact that Harry pressed up against him made him feel more than a little aroused.
Draco was in shock. “So, you don’t actually hate me?”
There was a rush of energy as arguments started, people were talking over each other, and the Wizengamont council members were flooding out of the courtroom in a flourish.
He watched as Harry stripped down bare, and it then occurred to him that that was the first time he properly saw him naked. Aside from his skinny dip a few days back. He also saw his cock for the first time, and he swears he’s never felt his fill up faster.
“That’s a surprise.” Harry muttered under his breath.
“Ok, we’re going. I just have to grab my bags and we’ll go.”
"Oh, hey Draco. How are you?" Harry asked, smiling as always.
Ron nodded. “Eight weeks, she said. Oh my god, I’m going to be sick.”
“How did you find where I was anyways?”
“I- no. Yes.” I stumble, totally aware but totally uncontrolling of my words or actions because of the way he looks at me.
“Oh.” Pause “Why?”
With pressurized grinding and rubbing, it only took a few moments for them to reach their climaxes, and not surprisingly at the same time, before they came back down, panting hard and raggedly.
Draco nodded.
“‘That’s the fate of being bound to a prophecy.’” Draco supplied.
“I could’ve been naked, you know.” Draco said, somewhat defensively after having his poor hiding place discovered and intruded upon.
"Like I said, he just got up and left, ‘Mione." Harry said as he Floo called his best friend. "He even told me he was scared yesterday. Something's not right."
“Hi, baby,” Harry said smoothly.
Harry looked up to see the blond staring down into his plate, clearly avoiding eye contact. “Well, yes, but that's not all.”
“Oh, cause you hate being cooped up inside this house with me all day, right? Because Merlin forbid you spend anytime with me-”
Draco quickly gave up his act and felt his eyes burn slightly. He sighed before turning over to Harry.
“I am so fucking lucky to have you.” Draco echoed.
“Malfoy, mate.” Ron began in a friendly tone “Shut the fuck up, why don’t you?”
Harry smiled up at him and wrapped an arm around the thin waist.
Harry hummed in response and leaned down to lock their lips together. With their added nakedness and extra horny hormones (they’re boys, what do you expect), things heated up quickly.
“So, as I was told, you two were joined together by a prophecy, correct?” Walkins said.
Draco bit his lip, still unsure of it all.
“Me too. I’m excited to have a place where we can call our own, a place with only our memories in it.”
Loosening him up and open with an equal assault of his tongue and fingers, Harry was eventually able to sit up and lube up his hard and leaking prick, ready to fuck the precious creature in front of him.
“Potter, you’re helpless. Looks like Finnegan needs a reminder on consensual spell casting in regards to colleagues and acquaintances.”
Harry and Malfoy made their way to double Potions, the first class of the day. Malfoy, practically hanging off of Harry, nuzzled and kissed his neck as they walked. Harry gave up trying to push him off after they both almost went tumbling down the stairs to the dungeons. Not wanting to risk an accident or injury, Harry ignored the blond until they reached the classroom. Whatever to keep him quiet, Harry thought.
“Fuck you, no.”
“Draco.” Malfoy corrected, leaning in closer still to Harry.
He would go by appointments, but would take walk-ins if he had the time. This day was particularly slow, as a Tuesday afternoon would be, so he was taking anyone that would walk in.
“I am going mad, Potter. I am utterly disgusted with your ideas of-”
“Yeah, we can do that. I'll get you a change of clothes though, cause I don't think you want to wear those out.” He gestured to his pyjamas.
“I'm fine with whatever you decide. You know I'll always be there for you, for us. I know because you're my mate you're probably... eager, and I am too, but it also can all be intimidating.”
Not feeling Harry let up, Draco sighed, and turned his gaze to the side so he wasn’t forced to look at Harry when he spoke.
That was the first time Harry had heard him speak during the whole trial, and to say it shocked the pants off him was an understatement. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened. Draco peered over at him with a raised eyebrow but said nothing.
“Why would I, when I have you?” Potter said with a quirk of his lip. It was immediately wiped off at the wide-eyed look Draco shot at him.
“Malfoy-malfoy stop.” Harry pleaded once more.
“I knew you’d listen.” Malfoy said with a lilting tone. “Are we almost done here, I’m bored.”
“That’s bollocks!” Ron shouted.
Draco nodded in agreement. He remembered some fond memories he had with his Godfather, especially when he was really young, although no one could disagree that he wasn’t a rotten shell of a man at the end of it all. He protected draco, which he loves him for, but he was a wicked and selfish man at the same time.
“Oh? Must be my lucky day.” Draco said with a laugh. The previous week’s events had been replaced with another busy week’s filled itinerary. He had not heard nor seen hide or hair from Potter. He wouldn’t let some outrageous encounter from his old school rival ruin anymore of his time.
He was just going to skip out on it and find something else to do to pass the time, but then he really thought about it. They were going to be there, on a private beach, for a month, and just because he didn’t bring any trunks, he was expected to not go swimming the whole time they were going to be there? The only other person that could see him was Draco, and from what Harry could guess, he was off brooding by himself.
“Yes, Hermione. As a joke, though.” He said, rolling his eyes.
Harry was silent for a moment. “Oh, ok. What - what do you want to talk about?”
Draco did have a great deal of papers and envelopes in front of him. He picked one up off the table, flipped it over, and dropped it back down.
Harry stayed seated as the room cleared out. He quickly glanced over at Draco who was sporting a very panicked expression. The urge to hold and comfort the small Omega was almost too strong.
He knew about his budding sexuality- in that he wasn’t straight. Since his close friendship with Cedric from two years prior, he knew that boys always interested him. But he also knew he didn’t like Malfoy, what he did, how he acted, or even who he was.
“Quite.” Snape said. “Although, your behaviour in my classes this past year has improved drastically, so I suppose I can overlook the mishap without deducting points. Nevermind that now. I wanted to discuss your and Mr Malfoy’s predicament. I am particularly disappointed in you that you would so carelessly cast an unknown curse at a classmate, no less. I am aware that you have been punished enough by your head of house, as well as having to watch over Mr Malfoy, which is punishment enough, I believe. However, you did seem to take on the task without much issue.”
Draco chuckled and said “No, not really. Thank you.”
“That makes you mine.” He finished. All worry and hesitation left his face.
Harry stood and placed a kiss on the Omega’s head, then made his way back to sit at his desk. He looked over at the blond with a smile on his face. “I can’t believe that we’re together now.”
When they were both washed, brushed and dressed, they stood looking at the bed awkwardly.
When he can inside, he saw Draco reading in the sitting room.
“Oh that’s it-” Ron said, as he was about to hit Malfoy.
“Yeah, interested. It’s not a for-sure thing yet.” Harry mumbled, scuffing his shoe on the floor. It’s true, he was interested in medicine of the magical sort, but he wasn’t 100% sure that that’s what he wanted to do. It just seemed interesting.
During sixth year is when he realized what all the hype was about the golden boy. He was the perfect being: handsome, casual, daring and loving. He was everything Draco wanted.
Two...Hermione and Ron
He pinched the bridge of his nose, thinking of what to do. Well, to be honest, there was only one thing to do if he didn’t want Malfoy making sexual advances for the rest of the day.
Draco cried and sniffed, making his congestion slightly less, but it still sucked. His head pounded and his body was still very warm, but being in Harry's arms provided him with a comfort he couldn't find anywhere else.
Draco glided by the bookshelves and quickly peered at the different types of books Harry had. Everything from muggle books like novels, to poems, to literature, to wizarding books, spell books, centuries old to ones he recognized from Hogwarts, to defensive magic, and a small section of dark magic. He softly snorted to himself as he realized they probably came from the original owners of the estate, the Blacks, and the only reason they were still here was emergency purposes. At least that's what he wanted to believe. He found himself back at the doors so he turned fully around, taking in all his surroundings at once and realized that this was his favourite place in the whole house. He moved back to the furniture and slowly started folding the sheets in on themselves, carefully trying not to disturb the dust that lay on top. He removed all the sheets and grabbed the pile before taking it down to the basement where Harry told him it's where they do the laundry. He threw them in an empty basket before making his way to the kitchen. He found Kreacher wiping down the counter and grimaced at the sight of the wrinkly house-elf. "Kreacher, would you mind following me?" He gestured back out the kitchen door and started back up the stairs before he heard the elf mumble something behind him about his love for purebloods and that he lives to serve the noble House of Black, or something or other. They made their way back to the library and Draco closed the door behind them, not wanting to disturb Harry. "Ok, I'm staying here for a while and I'd like a place for myself. This is actually a decent home-library, but it needs a little cleaning up. I trust you know what to do." And with that, he walked out and let the house-elf do its duty.
Harry smiled shyly and nodded. Draco responded back with a firm kiss.
“How was it?” Harry asked.
Harry lay awake for another hour or so, really considering why it was that he couldn’t submit to Draco’s request.
Harry Summoned a buck from the shed in the backyard. He handed it to Ron just as his nausea overtook him. It reminded Harry of their second year and the incident with the slugs. Man, Draco was a little prick.
“It’s alright, Draco. We’re here with you.” Hermione assured.
“Can I kiss you?”
“Good morning. I’m Draco Malfoy and I am a new employee here at PSIMS.” No one said anything, just continued to stare at him for a few moments. Draco cleared his throat and decided he hated everything in that moment: the concept of work, the societal expectation that everyone must endure such ridiculous practices, and Harry, who decidedly got him into this mess in the first place.
“And teasing you were.” Harry growled again. He pounced on top of Draco, kissing and licking his neck affectionately. Draco screamed with delight, giggling as Harry gripped and groped his sides.
Just a short one to add some flavour :) I’m coming up with some good ideas for this one
“I trust McGonagall told you,” The medi-witch said, as Malfoy’s screaming ‘let me go!’ rang out.
- and holy shit it was the best thing ever! The sweetness of the syrup mixed with the softness of the cake made the flavours complement each other perfectly. Draco saw the excited smile on Harry’s face, clearly waiting for him to tell Harry what he thinks. He swallowed his bite and took a sip of tea.
Finally, when he was able to, Harry found himself talking amicably with the oldest Wesley kid, Bill. They had become so immersed in their conversation, neither of them realized two hours later when Harry was to leave for his honeymoon.
Warm, wet hands ran over his skin, most likely massaging his sore muscles. He opened his eyes to find himself in bed, Harry standing over top of him.
Wait, what? Did Potter actually just ask him out after he thought that Draco had? This was a big misunderstanding. Draco paused, considering the notion. He thought back to the severe attraction he had for the man. Well, one date couldn’t hurt... “I might…” Draco said.
“I’m going to get him some water. Sit him up in the chair, Ron.” Hermione voice sounded frantic.
“Fuck, look at you.” He whispered crawling back up to kiss Draco full on the mouth. “So fucking precious.”
“I want you too, so badly.”
"I hope so. I love you Hermione. Thank you."
“Harry,” Draco moaned. “Oh merlin, you’re huge in me.”
Draco stares for a moment, processing the information he was just given. He shakes his head quickly and shortly. “No, I don't. I need to see him. NOW.” He says, breaking through her arm the second time, and making his way at a quick walk, peeking into every room he passed, looking for his husband. At the end of the hall and to the right, he sees Harry through a wide open window, laying in a bed, assumedly sleeping. A glowing yellow orb floated above him, thin blue strings of magic interlaced gently within it. He enters the room timidly, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest. The witch, Hermione and Ron have followed behind him.
“Get off, Malfoy,” Harry pushed, but once again, the blond stuck to him.
"Location can play a part, yes. The place you received the prophecy, or even bonded, will have a higher control rate than, lets say, a place you once visited during a vacation." Walkins assured.
“You know what?”
More smut in this chapter. Are we surprised? No.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hand and pulled his attention towards himself. “We’ve been over this, love. I don’t love you because the prophecy said to, alright?” Harry looked at him so sincerely.
