“I’m happy to hear that, Gentlemen. I, myself, am finished here. Let’s go get us settled. I have a letter to send and I want to talk to you about what is happening with the shop. It might be best if Bill, Charlie and Ginny join us, as I’m going to be working with them.”
Ronald Weasley reveals that yes, stupidity is his only talent
Is raging outside
Draco’s jaw dropped.  The guy before them was gorgeous! Not to mention he was also naked.  The mystery man stood two inches shorter than Draco himself.  His body had the look of a professional dancer, with a washboard stomach and skin a golden brown colour.  The man had shining ebony hair that brushed the nape of his neck.  Dazzling green eyes burned with an internal fire as he looked at each man in the room before striding confidently towards Voldemort.
Lucius was just settling down for tea when two owls landed on the table beside him. One of them he recognised as his son’s Eagle owl, Lucien. The other was a stranger. Shrugging, he reached for the strange owl first – Business before pleasure after all.
Draco nodded grimly. “I’m not regretting him getting pregnant,” he said softly, “but I am regretting that it happened when it did. Even six months later and his bones would have been strong enough for him to stand by himself. This morning I swear I saw his lower legs bend under the extra weight.”
“Before Pateras continues with his last reason for holding this meeting, I am going to say something. Those of you with children who are in my Pack are no longer in control of them. They are still your heirs or heiresses, but everything to do with them now falls to me. This means that any and all pre-signed agreements, understandings and contracts are null and void. If they wish to mate, marry and bond, they will come to me with their request, as one of my members already has.” He smiled. “They are my Pack and you have little power over them.”
Before Harry returned to his seat, he conjured another two poles closer to where he was seated and attached longer chains from them to the nipple rings. “Work for your meat, Slut. Show me how good you are.”
Twenty-five minutes later, the two of them walked into the Dining room only to find five shell-shocked adults. Both boys stopped.
“You will be doing a great deal, as this job is … intense. I need you two girls to go over the castle recording how many rooms are no longer being used, what you think the room was used as and list the items in the room. While in each room, you are to clean it to the best of your ability and sketch it the way it looked when you first arrived. Take photos before and after you remove or clean out something so that you have proof of what you found. Do up tables of each area and write what you find in that area and what condition it is in. Everything you find that isn’t furniture is to be packed into boxes. When each box is full, you stop and one of you brings the box to a room that I will have set aside specially for them. The boxes will be labelled with what room and which area the stuff came from. I will have another box appear so you can continue.
Tobias looked up at his bonded and smiled thankfully as he was handed a mug of his favourite Chi drink.
Draco groaned as Tobias nodded.
“No, but I would appreciate it within a week. Two at the most.”
When the words sank into his brain, he gave a blood-curdling scream and ran from the Hall as though the hounds of Hell were after him. All noise stopped as everyone blinked at the sudden exit he had taken.
The Pack had been in the library for just over an hour before they had their first interruption.
“ASAP,” was the reply as Tobias stumbled to his feet, making the two others in the room smile slightly at the sight.
“Wu, Xing.”
With that, the two of them shook hands and separated – one to sit at the Gryffindor Table to sit with Lee and the other to sit with Ginny. Both of them looked at Tobias and sighed in relief when they saw him asleep on Draco’s lap. It was evident that the raven-haired teen hadn’t heard what the woman’s plans were and, if the looks Draco and Lucius were exchanging were any indication, the toad-like centaur was going to have one Hell of a time. They could hardly wait! Let chaos reign.
“We thank you for you consideration Drimbolweave,” Tobias intoned with a bow. “You honour us with your presence in our negotiations.”
Tom dropped the stirring rod he had in his hand with a slight flush on his cheeks and nervously cleared his throat. “My son is a brat,” was his only reply to the blonde’s question as he turned back to his paperwork.
Tobias pouted. “Anadochos doesn’t want to taste my fish.”
“Of course they have our permission!’ Salazar exclaimed, incredulously. “Why wouldn’t we allow it? Rick,” he whined, “he doesn’t think we care about our grandson’s wellbeing!”
Dobby grinned as he felt his magic connect to his new masters magic. With a bow and a murmured ‘master’, he disappeared, a large smile on his face.
“Sev? What if there isn’t anything I feel up to eating there?” he asked quietly.
“If they are so bad that you have been kicked out of your own dorm roon, why haven’t you come to me?” Neville asked with a frown as he put his cutlery down.
Tom breathed out explosively when The Pack appeared in a flash of flame. “Thank you for coming so quickly. We have a problem.”
“In the common room,” Neville replied coldly. “Ginny was with me until about nine, Colin was with my until ten and you, Seamus and Dean left at twelve. Do you want me to prove it?”
Both the elder Weasley males nodded in understanding and returned to their normal places.
Needless to say, there was no bath for two; no foot rub and more than on pot of baby tea as the younger members of The Pack celebrated a new milestone in the development of their soon-to-be Pack member.
“Cissa! Cissa! I’ve got wonderful news!”
Tobias nodded and began to munch on one of the items on his plate. Draco mumbled something and rose from his seat, having made up his mind to ask the man. Hopefully, he would get an answer.
Tobias sighed. “I assume that it is important that we be there. Why he couldn’t have just waited til lunch and sent it with Thanatos, I have no idea.”
After a while, he spoke. “It hurts Nona. It hurts that I can’t show them who I am. I can’t handle all this inside me. Why can’t they all accept me the way I am – for who I am? I need to be released – I need to burn.”
Ron snapped his wand up and yelled out the cutting curse. When The Pack saw their Alpha was in danger, all of them – including said Alpha – transformed into wolves and charged the shocked redhead.
Tobias started shaking and wrapped his arms around himself for comfort. Severus stood and wrapped his arms around the youth. “You trusted me enough to write to me for help during the summer. What has changed for that trust to no longer be there?”
Tobias stopped growling.
“What is it that you have planned for today, Bi?”
None of them looked back as they were portkeyed into Hogsmeade. As Draco guided a green-faced Tobias to the nearest seat, Blaise made his way to the local Owl office to send an important letter to The Lord, knowing as he did so that there was a strong chance that he would be disowned and not caring if he was. His was a higher purpose than the Zabini clan now-days.
“I wish to talk to you, Gios. Meet me in my study in an hour.” Tobias bowed and left the room.
“You have been very very bad my pet,” he chuckled, holding her with ease. “I know you have been told about the brand on you by that delightful head of house of yours and I also know you have been researching it on your own – yet you still fight against my orders.”
“No Bi. Food! Eat! We need you at your best to properly support the little one that is growing in you.”
Tobias shook his head.
Tobias nodded slowly, as if deep in thought. “I must say I find Crucio rather boring. In fact, Bella cured me of my Crucio phase while she was begging for forgiveness after her fourth day of punishment. Such a pity she had to be released, she begged so prettily.” Tobias grinned, eyes gleaming in the firelight and almost the colour of hail clouds.
Five minutes later, Poppy heard the gentle sound of sleep and reached for the handle.
“I hope that helped, young Amelia,” a masculine voice said softly in respect for the pain she had previously been in.
Draco visibly melted at Tobias’ whispered apology and allowed him to snuggle slightly into his chest before pushing him away slightly with a regretful look in his eyes. “I need to change, Love. You can have me back when I am presentable,” he said in reply to Tobias’ pout.
“I always knew you’d go dark, Potter.”
“That is only a rough figure though,” Fred said with a shrug. “It depends on the time of year after all. That was the figure we approximated from our owl services from last year so …” he shrugged.
Lucius turned a deeper green. “What could be worse than what he is eating now?” he groaned softly.
Voldemort started to laugh as Severus went pasty-white and hurried to order the house-elves away from the boy. Everyone looked at him in surprise and all eyes widened as they saw tears streaming down his face.
“It’s only been four days and he’s already cleaned all the sitting rooms, re-organised the kitchens, scared the house-elves out of the kitchen on a morning, cleaned and organised his rooms, made the chambers I use for torture into a playroom for the Death Eaters and has scared me out of my office while cleaning, organising and completing MY paperwork!”
“That … that snake? Is …”
When the class was over, she noticed a flick of white out of the corner of her eye. Stunned for a moment, she let the information that a Slytherin had sent the note she wrote for Tobias to one Neville Longbottom. She shook her head. She shouldn’t be surprised. Neville, after all, was very loyal to his friends and family. Forcing her mind back to the lad before her, she pulled out a pensive. It was going to be a long afternoon.
Tom smirked. “Maybe, but I’m sure you’re rich enough to spare a few knuts.”
Hermione shakily wrote her essay, face pale. Not one of the spells she, Ron and the Headmaster had cast at Harry near the end of last year was in the books found in the general library. The more spells she researched, the sicker she felt, until she had to run out of the library with hands over her mouth. She had used spells worse than the Unforgivables, which was disgusting – but what is worse was that she had used them on a friend – Her best friend – willingly. She would beg his forgiveness for this for the rest of her life and she would take her punishment without question. She just hoped that it didn’t get any worse, but by look of the book the Deputy Headmistress took, she knew it was going to get worse – so very much worse.
“So yes, we do expect our females to give birth and keep house. They also make all our weapons, perform most of the rituals that are performed, plan and create all new vaults and they protect this bank by being our warriors.”
“Thank you Anadochos”
“I think I may need St Mungo’s after all Poppy.” He panted shallowly for air.
“In my years here, everyone knew that Slytherins were evil and that the worst two families were those of Black and Malfoy,’” she snorted softly in disgust. “We were FOOLS!”
“And what were they”: Helga asked with a knowing smile.
For some reason, Neville felt a sharp thrill go through him as excitement filled the air.
“Come on, Lucius,” a female voice now sounded. “I want to see my boys so if you don’t move, I’ll let Remus at you. You are – after all – keeping him from his Neogennito.”
Without a word, Severus handed over seven rolls of parchment to the diminutive older man and turned to look at the last person in the group.
“Both Potions and both Herbology for me,” Neville joined.
Ginny nodded and knocked on the table. “Two chicken salad sandwiches on multigrain and two tomato juices with a small amount of salt and pepper.”
Lucius chuckled, knowing how stubborn his son could be. “And how did you get him to stay in bed? And did he go back to sleep?”
Draco knocked tentatively on the door to his childhood bedroom before opening the door slightly. He gasped when he saw the bandages wrapped around Tobias’ hands. Tobias opened his eyes at the sound. Draco almost ran to his side, tears once more running down his cheeks.
“Neither have I, Dear, but it was lovely to hear.” The mother answered before turning to the two boys. Black eyes – made deeper by the pale face and black hair that framed them – looked into Tobias’ emerald ones. “That was beautifully said, My Raven. I am taking that as admittance to linking my garden.”
Once he had started, Harry could bring himself to stop and he licked a line from mid back up towards his Pet’s slowly leaking hole, gathering all the released liquid on his tongue. When he got to where he truly wished to be, he pulled back inspecting the quivering hole. With a smirk, he conjured a set of ropes with leather loops on the end. With a deftness that would have surprised all those who had known him in his school years, Harry relocated Draco’s feet into them. Giving each ankle a nibble, he also relocated Draco’s hands so they grabbed his ankles.
“You said this is what happens most of the time. What happens in the dreams that this doesn’t occur in?”
Draco relaxed as he stirred the mixture in his cauldron, focusing on nothing else. He had noticed that Tobias was still tired most of the time and he was starting to cramp. When Tobias was asleep, he had taken to watching him and talking to the Founders. He had discovered that for a few weeks after the conception, Tobias would be tired and sore as his body was still getting used to the foreign material in his body. Even though he now knew that this was normal for those who could naturally conceive, he still watched his husband like a hawk – just in case.
Severus laughed softly. “How about we compromise: We leave now for Hogsmeade and we stop in Madam Puddifoots,” he wrinkled his nose in disgust, “To have a snack before lunch. Or,” he added hopefully, “We can ask the elf who serves Tobias for a large basket of food for us all to munch on during the day.”
Halfway through supper, Voldemort broached the subject he wished to discuss.
No one had ever seen the Ice-Prince of Slytherin move as fast as he did to gather his husband in his arms. “I love you, I love you, I love you,” he murmured, a single tear falling from his grey-green eyes to roll down his face. “Don’t ever forget that, Tobias. I love you so much, and this gift you have given me – as unexpected as it is – is so amazing. Don’t believe for a second that it isn’t welcome, because it is.”
“I’ll go get The Pack and see if Thanis will take us. Greg or Vince can take “Bi from you if you wish.”
Tobias shook his head , burying his face into Draco’s neck.
Severus shook his head slightly to clear his thoughts. He had one more class before the end of the week – and he had a surprise for his two godsons. Grinning, he managed to scare his class into the lab without trying.
Schozogglan [Zog] – Earth Daemon
“Bi! If you don’t stop, you’re going to kill my father with laughter.”
Amelia, Lucius and the other Ministry workers who had volunteered to be members of the Dumbledore investigations sat down, stunned after being thrown out of the pensieve. Looking between themselves, Amelia felt grateful to whomever sent the letter to Minerva just before they entered the room.
In my Iris garden against a grey stone wall.”
“And he also believed that our Potions Professor would need you. He receive three letters this morning and looks ready to throw up,” Luna piped in.
Severus watched in shocked surprise as tears sprang to Draco’s eyes as he read the invitation. Reading it over his shoulder, his jaw dropped. When Tobias started something, he made sure it was completed – and completed properly!
In the silence that followed, Lucius stood and moved to his wife’s side. Looking at his Lord for permission, he pointed his wand at the boy and murmured something. The Weasleys gasped as Harry Potter disappeared to be replaced by someone else. They watched in shock as he threw himself into Lucius’ arms and hugged him tight.
The stranger quickly appeared at Tobias’ side once the older man had been detained.
Tobias sat in the middle of the sitting room, looking around in awe at what his pack had organised for him. They had all eaten breakfast in the decorated room, followed closely by large stockings filled with small wrapped presents and small packets of international wizarding sweets.
Tobias smiled at him. “Not yet, I’m not,” he whispered. “Are you going to claim your prize?”
Bill, Charlie and the twins turned to Neville. “Tell Alpha that we are sorry we missed him, but we had to go back to work before we were missed..”
Before anyone could respond, Dobby popped in with a bowl of strawberry yoghurt topped with flakes of bright pink fish and an almost rubbery looking strip of white. Everyone had to look away as Tobias gleefully dug into the meal.
Blintzy bowed and disappeared with a pop, only to reappear moments later with a man wearing old brown hide pants, a cotton shirt and hide vest all caked in varying thicknesses of dirt.
Tobias looked up from his writing and pouted. “But I’ve already had a 15 minute break for a mid-morning snack.”
“Is why we give to pregnant Master,” an unfamiliar voice squeaked.
Severus blinked once in surprise before demanding, “I need to speak to Lucius. Right. This. Second!”
Just so you know Alpha,” Pansy whispered as Blaise and Ginny distracted Draco, “the food that you will be getting is designed to support you and the cub through the period of time it will take for you to recover from yesterday’s events. It will speed up the process a little as well. You can still have your cravings, but they will only be snacks between the meals so you aren’t going to be missing out on your favourite combinations.”
“Tell them that no matter what we decided, they have my blessing to begin once they’ve all been checked.”
He sighed. It was very quiet in the house. Ginny had asked for – and received – permission to go travelling with Luna and her father for the holidays. Bill and Charlie were in Egypt and Romania and due to the shop; the twins were rarely at the burrow. Percy still wasn’t talking to the family – but he had started to answer the letters Ron had been sending him. In fact, he was going to be picking him up later on in the week to spend the day with him.
Algernon looked to the bed and chuckled as Bill and Charlie dragged the woman from the room to hand her over to the Aurors that Narcissa had just fire called. He had been worried that his Little Lord would start freaking out at hearing what the woman said, but he hadn’t thought to keep the Malfoy Heir in mind.
Ginny whistled. “That’s a lot of detail you want, Alpha. Are we going to get an explanation to why we are doing this?”
“Remind me to stay on your good side,” Lucius stated from his position behind her, making her jump.
Severus watched slack-jawed as every single teacher in the room pledged their allegiance to his godson, even knowing – or suspecting – that Tobias was in league with the dark. Wait until Tom heard about this!
“Thank you for holding this for me Amelia,” he said. “Now I won’t panic when I can’t find them.” He stood and strode out, oozing confidence, but she finally saw through the mask and saw the real man behind it.
“Do you swear your loyalty to me?”
Laughing at the meetings ending, the Slytherin’s left for their beds. Before separating to find their own beds, both Tobias and Draco hugged the amused men that were still in the room. As they walked away, talking about why Tobias wanted Draco to be the main focus of Dumbledore’s keep-control-of-Potter campaign, both men watched them.
“We can do that,” Pansy said, determination evident in the set of her mouth and deep in her eyes. “How long do we have to do this? And do you want the hallways done as well?”
“It’s only right that you know Lord Patil. I couldn’t allow you or your daughters to go into this blind. Pateras and Anadochos made sure that I went in knowing what I was getting into ad since the girls helped one of my Pack, I intend on doing the same for them.”
“Nonos, Lykos. Both of you please come with me.”
Minerva nodded and called the Librarian over. Minerva once again sat, this time gripping the bushy-haired girl’s hand firmly in her own.
“Sounds interesting,” Pansy said with a smile. “Are we all going to the library then?”
“Sorry,” they murmured as they walked in past the man.
Nods and groans of relief were his answers. Packing away the books they were using, the group hissed as stiffened muscles were worked.
Ginny and Luna walked along behind him, talking about whether or not nargals would live in a periwinkle forest.
Kyria - Lady
A flare of green flames drew the attention of all in the room. From them stepped a cold Remus, a smirking Severus and, moments later, a livid Harry. All motion in the room stopped.
“Oh! Tom, old boy! I didn’t see you there! If you’ve come to kill me, please do so now.  As you can see,” Harry pulled up the sleeves of the shirt he was wearing to reveal his lower arms, “I tried making your job easier for you by doing it myself,” Harry snarled in anger, not seeing the distress on Remus’ face, nor the shock and surprise on everyone else’s. “But it turns out that the old bastard hit me with a suicide prevention charm before he collared me.”
Harry hid his grin and followed the two men to the dining hall.
“Are you serious?” Amelia asked incredulously. “Do you know what that means?”
Severus was nervous. It had been nearly four hours since Harry had walked into his study and neither of them had yet to leave. He jumped as a laughing Harry opened the door, then straightened and bowed to his Lord.
Minerva smiled sadly at the girl. “But it was you yourself that allowed this to happen,” she said, shocking the girl into silence. “The thing about the brand you have is that it does not take hold unless your magic accepts it as punishment for what you did wrong. You already know that your punishment for your part in what happened to Harry that led him to become Tobias is death. Your magic accepted the brand in the hopes that it will not be a long, slow, painful death.”
Tobias nodded and snuggled into the mattress.
“And if the Young man goes dark?” Wu asked, only a slight trace of his native accent detectable.
Severus nodded. “Is it safe to give either of them any potions?
“How long has he been here?” Draco clarified.
“I came to say it is time for the four of you to get some sleep. Whatever it is that you are doing can wait for tomorrow. I have cocoa for you so you can relax before attempting to sleep.”
Tobias laughed. “Come on Nonos. If you don’t tell them, then I will, and that will make it worse for you, wouldn’t it?”
Severus swallowed hard. “My Father was one of them – he targeted anyone weaker than he was and wouldn’t stop until he had broken them. He did it to my Mother and he tried to do it to me – but I had something that made me fight it. I had a solid friendship with Tobias’ birth mother and it wasn’t until I lost that friendship that I even thought about joining the Dark Lord.”
“You look fabulous, Pateras. I knew that would work on you.”
Sev kept looking him right in the eye. “It isn’t any of my business, but as the godfather to both you and Draco, it is my duty to make sure that the both of you are safe when the other is unavailable. You made it clear to me that night a few weeks ago that that was my job, and I intend to do it. I do not want to have to go back home and tell a werewolf that his Neogennito is not doing well. Nor do I wish to tell Draco that the bonding ceremony is off because if he doesn’t come see you, then you are not going to survive.”
“Do you  have any marriage arrangements for Padma and Pavarti?”
Tobias smiled and reached for it. “Thank you. Do you think I can have something to nibble on? I’m feeling a little hungry.”
“Watch your mouth half-breed,” Draco sneered, mentally begging for the resident herd’s forgiveness. “That is my bonded you are talking about with your unworthy tongue.”
Once they read the letters, both the Malfoys and Remus apparated to their Lords house only to find the Dark Lord – his eyes now fully Hazel and his skin looking more like that of his youth and less like that of a corpse – dancing around the room with a terrified Pettigrew as his dance partner.
Wood and clay will wash away,
“Draco?” The whisper caught his attention and he looked at his father and laughed at the look of awe on his face. “What the hell did you promise him?”
“If there is nothing on the table that you feel you can eat, I will send you a nutrient potion and talk to one of the house-elves about a strict eating regime for you. But, if it comes to that, I’ll need you to see Poppy or the Malfoy’s healer to see why you are having such an adverse reaction to all the foods around you.”
“And is this person still alive?” Severus asked, noticing how Lucius was paling.
Remus chuckled. “Yes, I guess I am. But if it means you remain happy, healthy and comfortable during your pregnancy then I’m sure I will be able to live with it.”
“What schooling?” Achalendra asked coolly as he herded his daughters towards the door. “From your results and what I have heard today, you are using your school years to learn how to be the Mistress of a rich man rather than learning how to become someone to be proud of. As it is, the only thing you will be able to do on your own is to work in the adult film industry. I am hoping time with the main branch of our family will change that. If not, then there are plenty of rich men who would be interested in having a younger woman on their arm.”
Luna raised her head to reveal large watery silver-blue eyes. “My toy broke!” she bawled, her fight against her tears lost as glittering trails flowed down her cheeks.
My … Fair … Lay … Dee.”
The four woman of The Pack laughed at that.
She grabbed hold of Tobias’ hand and pulled him into the kitchen behind her, knowing that both her parents would have heard that last little bit about Hermione and Ron and secretly celebrated it.
Ron froze as the voice spoke. No matter how much he wished it, that voice haunted his nightmares. The one dream he had that contained the owner of that voice stood out in his mind. He replayed it every time he closed his eyes. He still felt the phantom pains those knives of hers had caused. He opened his mouth to scream once more, but fear had frozen his voice. He moaned piteously as a cold hand formed of mist touched his cheek.
Cornelius watched the youngster as he walked unsurely towards his new line. He shook his head as the shy, fumbling lad became a confident young man. ‘I’m glad that went well,’ he thought almost hysterically. ‘I don’t want to know what would have happened had I refused.’
Tobias looked at her incredulously. “Yes, Allies,” he eventually stated after getting his voice back. “You don’t seriously expect me to believe that the entire population would leave their money in the control of their enemy.”
This worried Tom. He knew that his son was clinging to the chance at spending time with his betrothed before they had to separate, but he had the feeling that Tobias was beginning to become dependent on Draco to keep him sane. He sighed heavily. The following fortnight will be hell for him. He’ll have to talk to him after all.
TRIAL OF LOVE
Tobias snorted. “You are talking to the boy who – when other boys were having naughty dreams about girls – was having trouble not creaming his jeans from his memories of you torturing his human family. Hell the only reason why I didn’t have that reaction to the things I could see coming from Pateras was because it fucking hurt me … and they didn’t involve Dumbledore, or the Dursleys spread on the wall with their heads on spikes.”
Severus chuckled softly as he looked up from where he was writing out a parchment full of potions-related activities on it and glanced over at the  transfigured bed where Tobias and Luna could be found. After eating, the rest of The Pack had guided Luna to Severus’ office and the blonde had sleepily climbed into the bed with her Alpha, mumbling a soft ‘thankyou Papa’ before falling into a deep healing sleep only moments after Tobias.
“Y-y-y-yes m-m-milord.” Wormtail walked past Harry, who growled at him, his eerie eyes full of a promise – You’re next.
“Did you have a team in mind?”
Draco smirked slightly and manoeuvred himself until he felt the head of this dick press against Tobias’ entrance. ‘Thank Merlin I remembered to add the relaxant Sev gave me,” he thought as he slowly pushed into the tight heat above him. ‘Oh Merlin, he’s tight!’
Algernon Longbottom smiled as he lowered his wand. “Both carrier and child are fine. The time spent in a different time frame didn’t do much harm. The youngster is a week or so older than it should be. Instead of being 1 month old, it is 1 month, 1 week.”
“So you agree?”
Luna let out a wet giggle as the bonds that tied her to the other members of The Pack pulsed with all the pride, acceptance and, most comforting of all, love that they held for her.
Severus and Lucius followed Tom to the library, tears streaming down their cheeks at Tom’s shrill scream of “MY BOOKS!”
Tobias grinned. “Just go to the front of the class and act like everything is normal. I’ll take care of everything else.” Raising his voice so everyone in the class could hear him, he said. “So using magical vegetable matter grown in a muggle environment rather than a magical one affects the outcome of the potion it is used it?”
Chuckles answered him. “That would be because all the books we need for this assignment are here in our dorm. How else did you think we could get the grades we do without going to the library?” Blaise chuckled.
After the feast had completed and the students long since gone to bed Albus Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk deep in thought. He was deeply impressed by the strength the boy showed earlier that night. He wasn’t much worried about anything the boy said or did, as long as he did the job he was manipulated for. In fact, if he were honest with himself, he hoped the boy would do something like he had threatened. It would make it that much easier to dispose of him.
Once Ginny heard her name come up, she grabbed her chance and jumped into his sentence, her hands on her hips and scowling at her brother.  “As if you don’t know what him and I want to do together without you two in the room. It has been you, Ron, who has been trying to push us together since your forth year, isn’t it? How do you think we would get to be in a relationship like that if we don’t know anything about the other?” She turned her scowl onto Hermione. “I expected my brother to be this stupid, but you Hermione? If I were you, then I’d stop fucking him every night if his stupidity is spread that way.”
“Oh, no, Bi. No. You don’t always have to be strong. I’m here for you when you need to show this side of you.” Draco smiled shyly. “I enjoyed being the person to comfort you last night. It was special to me. Promise me you’ll always let me comfort you. Please?”
“I received a letter from the Twins earlier this morning. It seems that they managed to intercept a letter that Ronald had sent to our mother. They gave me a short low down on what the letter said and what they are doing about it, but they did indicate that they would have a full report for you by lunchtime and as it is lunchtime in about ten minutes, it should be on your desk for you.”
Luna was in her specially designed room within the Room of Requirement, humming softly while getting the room ready for her plans for the next evening, humming a popular children’s song in a slow and eerie fashion, a large insane grin on her face and silver eyes following things only she could see. Life was perfect. Her Alpha and his unborn cub were doing well, she had Alpha’s permission to court a potential mate and she had another session with a red-headed annoyance. Yes, life was very, very good.
Tobias sat at his desk, deep in thought. He had woken nearly an hour before and had listened to Luna’s problem before calming her with a few words. She had nodded and left to do as he had suggested, leaving him to read, examine and reply to the letters, reports and forms that had been delivered to his desk by Thanatos. He smiled as his thoughts turned to the phoenix that had chosen to bond with him. He didn’t see the creature often due to his reluctance to cage a magical creature, but there wasn’t a day that he didn’t receive at least one letter that the beautiful creature had delivered for him.
Tobias giggled slightly at the mental image of what would happen if that was to happen and shook his head. Still giggling lightly, he got up and sat beside Draco just as hundreds of owls flew into the Hall.
Take a look inside me and watch my heart strings come undone
“May we adjourn to another room to discuss this?” Tobias asked, once again going into diplomat mode.
Vince and Greg stood side by side in grey-green dress pants and crisp white shirts. In Greg’s hand was a scroll held together with a silver ribbon. He handed this to Draco. As Draco opened it, another rose appeared in his hand, a green ribbon wrapped around it.
Hope you all enjoy this chapter. I will admit that when I originally wrote this I needed a few tissues, but that could be because I took part of it from my own experiences. Not fun at all.
“Glad to see you Dan. Good to see that some people of sense are still in Mungo’s.”
Mrs Weasley broke the silence. “You are still too young to know Harry. This is for older, more skilful witches and wizards …”
“We are very happy at being back here,” one of the twins said with a grin.
Salazar spluttered slightly. ~ Who does this child think he is. He is nothing but the son of an ass and a Demon. ~
Tobias brightened. “Kidneys please! And tomato! And yoghurt! And fruit salad!”
Draco smiled softly and nuzzled his check on the top of Tobias’ head. “Later is later. This is now. Just relax my special one. Just enjoy.”
Draco nodded. “It does look horrendous. What would you like instead?”
The guards who were in the room smirked: Their kind knew the real dangerous sex. Males might fight for honour, frustration, and to gain glory, but it was the females who fought for their family. There was a reason why no creature dared to attack an area where young goblins were present when their female relatives were around.
The man paled, eyes pleading him for mercy. Tobias grinned maliciously. “Now, why did you throw this toy at me?”
“If you were here, Frank, you would be proud of him, for there is no doubt that he is your son. None at all.”
“He asks us to care for his newest pet name ‘Poke’ because he is fun to poke with a very long stick.”
“A little, Pateras. Are we holding the ceremony tonight?”
With one last spoon of what Tobias believed he would forever call ‘glue’, he leaned into Draco’s side with a slightly tired exhale. He hummed happily when Draco absent-mindedly wrapped an arm around his shoulders and someone close by handed him a mug of some creamy spiced liquid that smelt and tasted familiar to him.
Severus nodded his understanding. “I will go see your father tonight under the guise that he has called a meeting. I will explain all of this too the family in one go and get them to organise a visit to a healer we all trust. Until then, is there anything he can have that will make him act more like himself – or at least make it so that he can stay awake during his lessons?”
Tobias started to laugh. “Pateras, did you read the instructions on the potion before drinking it?” Voldemort shook his head, grinning like a loon. Tobias shook his head sadly. “This, my friends, is why it is important for all instructions to be read thoroughly before doing something. Pateras, please tell me how you feel.”
Tobias frowned thoughtfully down at the papers before him. Since Draco had forbidden him from using magic for a few days to allow himself to recover from his forced transformation the day before, he had decided to take his paperwork with him to breakfast since he was to spend the day with Minerva since Severus was brewing several very delicate potions for the Healer who had replaced Madam Pomphrey. He jumped slightly when a hand was placed on his shoulder.
“How big was it, Mr Malfoy?” Pansy asked, awed at the site of the large fang. She, like all of the Slytherins who had heard of the events of four years previous, had believed it was just a story that the Headmaster had concocted to increase his Golden Boy’s reputation. By looks of it, the Headmaster had actually talked it down – but to what purpose.
“Without a thought!”
“Eight?” Draco gulped. “Why eight?”
I know I promised weekly updates, but that was before my computer decided to die. It is now fixed and here is the next chapter!
Luna watched the sun sink below the horizon with a satisfied smirk. It was almost time for her to get to work. Before vanishing into the castle, she looked up at the full moon. “It’s almost our time, Mother. I hope you are proud of whom I have become.” She turned and walked back into the castle without a single glance backwards.
Lucius whimpered slightly and moaned in distress.
The bonding, part 2
“Oh how wondrous!”
It turned out that on odd occasions, a Dragon handler would, for some reason, gain the interest of a specific dragon and sometimes the dragon would choose to bond with said handler. No one knew how or why it happened, but it was considered to be the highest of honours to be the chosen bonded of a dragon in  Dragon-Handler law. Needless to say, Charlie did not contribute to the enlargement of The Pack, but in his own admission, he was happier being the bonded companion of the Peruvian Vipertooth that chose him than he would have been had he bonded with a human.
At that, Severus started laughing until tears streamed down his face..” I-Icky Sq-Squishy stuff? How u-utterly Hufflepuff of them! Are you sure this is a Gryffindor?”
“Now that that’s over with, what’s going on Beta?”
“Be the first person to,”
Severus Snape – Nonos [Godfather]
“You are most welcome, Mr Malfoy-Black.”
“Of course, Nonos. I’m sure I could also give a short demonstration of the workings of this pack. When this meeting is complete, please write a letter to Pateras suggesting it. Oh, and ask him if it can be done before a full meeting so everyone knows what they’re dealing with if they decide to try their games on them. I think even you will be surprised Nonos. Kitten? What are the Old Goat and the Over-cooked Chicken Club up to?”
“We would be delighted, Professor McGonagall,” Draco half-bowed.
“Yes. We require a large fruit salad. Make sure you get a good variety of fruit. Do NOT focus on apples, pears and oranges.”
Draco growled angrily at the paling mid-wife.
Draco threw his arms around Tobias and squeezed him tightly. “This gift is satisfactory, Bi. Where did you get it? It is hard to find someone who can brew en larmes de rayons de lune, much less one that looks as if it is 100% pure.”
“It was sparrows actually,” Xenophilus stated calmly as he lit the lanterns so he could converse properly with them.  “They were getting into Luna’s grass garden and eating all the seed. Gnomes like sparrows. It’s like carrot to a rabbit.”
Harry turned and smiled at the two elder Malfoys and Severus, then frowned and turned to face his father.
Draco face-palmed as Harry turned his darkest glare at the man as his temper flared.
Tobias shifted slightly so he could hide his face in Draco’s chest like a small, timid child. Draco rocked the sun lounge slightly, his heart fighting over whether he should be happy the rave-haired youth allowed him to do this, or outraged that anyone could treat his intended in a way that was beneath what he deserved. Resting his cheek on Tobias’ head, Draco vowed to treat the angel before him the way he deserved to be treated. Deep in his thoughts, Draco hadn’t noticed that Tobias had fallen asleep, nor had he planned on falling asleep himself.
Tobias stared up at Draco with wide eyes and nodded slowly. He whimpered when Draco pulled out of him, but he quickly moved into the position that Draco had told him to get into.
“Yeah,” Millicent agreed, sliding in next to the feisty red-head. “If you pout any more, or any harder, then Beta here won’t have a choice but to attack your mouth with his own. He already looks to be fighting the urge to make you moan.”
“No, I’m fi-“ Draco yawned, “fine.” He glared cutely at Harry who had chuckled. “Maybe I am a bit tired, but … stay? Please?”
Tobias couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m terrified, Pateras. I’ve gone from having no-one, to being surrounded by people who genuinely care about me, and it’s happened so fast. What if I stuff it up? What will I do if I drive him away? What if I’m not good enough for him?”
Severus chuckled. “I was wondering who would be the first to catch on. I’m going to make myself clear. I am a Potions Master – and a damn good one at that,” he stated. “I believe that if you are going to teach Potions then it should be done properly. I was forbidden to teach my lessons the way I wished, so I didn’t bother to do much more then  give them enough homework and supervision so they could do the best they could without killing themselves. With Amelia and the other Ministry officials here, they gave me the permission I needed to change the way potions is taught. The students who did as they were told and went to their professors were the first to get the new schedule.”
“Albus Dumbledore has just signed his own death warrant,” Harry snarled, lighting the two piles of wood on fire just by looking at them. He looked at Wormtail, who was hiding behind Crabbe and Goyle Snr.
Draco and Tobias spun around fast enough to give themselves whiplash. Standing before them was a woman so pale she seemed to glow in the darkness and a male so dark he could have been mistaken for a shadow. A pair of luminescent blue eyes shone with humour from The Father’s face.
Soon his screams stopped as the spiders seemingly took offense at the sound of his terror and converged onto his face and neck. Soon only his ears and eyes were the only things visible. Out the corner of his eye, he saw the two mist children happily spinning slowly around while silver and gold threads marked their progress to form an intricate web design.
A hiss of pleasure filled the air. ~ I wish to be known as Raithia, Master. ~
Everyone looked at the wall and watched as a very familiar redhead paid a first year to slip the herbs to Tom without him knowing.
“Tonight we go to Malfoy Manor. Tonight we become a pack in more than name. From tonight you do not answer to anyone but me – unless I tell you otherwise. Draco is an extension of me. If he tells you to jump, you are to respond with ‘how high’. Do I make myself clear?”
“The potion, however, “Fred continued, moaning softly as he sank deeper into the seat, “was not destroyed in the slightest. It was simply passing from me to George and back again, so we had a constant amount of it in both of us. This leads us to believe that the person who doused s did it to say they gave it to us while still allowing us to be unaffected by it.”
“How do you know?” Severus asked, taking the opportunity to pull Tobias against him and run a calming hand through his godson’s hair. Everyone sighed in relief when Tobias calmed and cuddled into the older man.
Harry blinked and looked at the Malfoy engagement rings, then back at the blonde. “Y-you’re not mad at me?”
“What the Hell am I WEARING?” Tom yelped.
“Actually, he was one of the three that didn’t think it was a good idea.”
“Hello Algernon,” Daniel said as the older man knelt on the other side of the downed teen.
“Those herbs are the first things we bearers are warned against. They are Asian in origin and they are burnt or made into a tea to cause women to abort an unwanted pregnancy. The only trouble is that it aborts wanted pregnancies just as easily.”
--FLASHBACK—
Tom laughed and checked the time. Seeing it was almost 10:30 he yelped.
He opened his mouth to continue, only to find it obstructed by Draco’s mouth. After an intense kiss that lasted several minutes they parted panting for breath.
“I understand Minerva,” Amelia soothed. “That is one of the reasons you are a good teacher – you care for the students. I’ll come to your room with you after this evening’s meal so you can give me those memories. Can you send Severus Snape in for me?”
Lucius chuckled softly. He’d seen the light in Tobias’ eye when he’d seen the pile of paper in Sev’s hand. When the youngster had left, he turned to Tom. “Do you know what his going to do once he leaves Hogwarts? I have the feeling that everyone in The Pack – Including Miss Weasley and Miss Lovegood – could sit for their NEWTS at the end of this year and pass them with good marks.”
He glided to a spare seat between Minerva and Filius and nodded to the both of them.
What did surprise them, however, was that one of his conquests had volunteered to carry his issue and he had accepted. It was later discovered that the woman in question and her husband had been trying for an heir since they were married and had recently discovered that the husband was infertile. The pair had approached Blaise with a proposition – he give them a child and sign the kid over to them fully and in the future, when he felt ready for an heir, the woman would do the same for him. The arrangement, though somewhat surprising, worked out well for the trio and Blaise doted on his daughter, as did the rest of The Pack.
“Maybe we can go further. I had forgotten how marvellous this feels.”
“Was this necessary, Kitten?” Tobias sighed, knowing deep down that it was.
Chapter 54
“Merciful Merlin! What’s wrong with him?” a worried female voice called.
Sorry peeps, not feeling like myself tonight anyone have a spare hug I can have?
The mostly asleep red head giggled as he was tickled by what his mind told him was wool as a soft woollen blanket surrounded him.
The Pack waited patiently at the doors leading into the Dark Lord’s domain. They were all dressed in the same thing with the only difference being a minor one. This uniform – a design created by their Alpha – consisted of a long-sleeved kimono-style bronze shirt tied at the right hip for the females, the left for the males, with long black dragon leather pants with a copper snake curled up the leg opposite that of the shirt’s tie. The top button on the pants doubled as the snake’s eye. The pants were topped with a narrow silver belt with a black snake buckle. Small pockets in the top of the belt hid important items, such as floo powder, shrunken potions vials filled with various potions, shrunken water canisters. Stone and flint and food dried so thoroughly it had to be chewed for hours before swallowing were also added – as Tobias said, they never know what would occur if their wand was ever removed from them in a fight, or worse – snapped, and they were in an uninhabited area.
Severus’ eyebrows shot up into his hairline. “You cannot eat?” As Harry shook his head, Severus leant over and looked closer at the bands on Harry’s wrist closer. After a few minutes, he stood and hurried to the door, cursing the Headmaster as he went.
Tobias curled up around the foot on him and growled deeply. Nothing made him angrier than someone threatening his family. Forcing himself to breathe through the pain he was experiencing and blocking out the old bastard’s words, he triggered his side of the bond he had with his phoenix.
Two of the Weasleys split off from the rest and approached the group of Slytherins.
“God’s Will.”
George swallowed nervously before straightening his back and squaring his shoulders. He may not want to say this in the company he was currently in, but he would answer the question and face the consequences like a man.
Tobias sighed. “I did have a break. Madam Greengrass made me lay down for fifteen minutes and have a cup of sweet tea and a scone while she checked me over.”
“H-he is then chained up with me where they use him to get me to do what they want me to do. I – I have to choose between dad and Draco, but I can’t. I don’t want to lose either of them. Dumbledore hits Draco with the cutting curse of Severus’ then hits him with Cruciatus.” Tobias shivered. “There is so much blood. I like the sight of blood – but not when it is Draco’s. I – I yell at him to stop, but he doesn’t. So I scream ok. I’ll kill dad. I don’t want to, but I have to if I want to save Draco.”
“Same for me,” Theo echoed.
As one they looked down at the paper they held and nodded in satisfaction. They could not wait to see the results of this.

“We already have enough evidence on how bad a teacher Severus Snape is, so I’ll skip those questions and go onto …”
Tom smiled, watching as his son handled Lady Augusta Longbottom like an expert. He beamed in pride when the Longbottom matriarch accepted the invitation.
Both men walked back into the room with a slight bounce in their step.
“What’s that Alpha?” she asked.
“It’s icky,” Tobias pouted.
Remus smiled. “I got Harry back in bed without waking him. Are you alright?”
Severus nodded, deep in thought. “He could just be having a reaction to the difference in the magic between here and the Garden. How about this? You both only have potions this afternoon, right? Well, I’ll let you off this lesson so the two of you can sleep. I suggest using your new rooms, I’m sure that Kitten will alert me if something goes wrong.”
You seem to be having trouble with something, Miss Granger. Is there anything I can do to help?”
“Bi, listen to me. None of what he did to you matters in the cause of my loving you. A muggle cannot take the virginity of some magical unless they are married. To the wizarding world, a witch or wizard is only classified as being deflowered if the witch or wizard involved gives consent with heart, mind and soul. You are still pure in every way until the day you give yourself to someone sexually.”
Since they had signed the papers, she had learnt to put her own beliefs to the back of her mind and see something through another’s point of view. She had been told of Tobias’ full story and the true identity of his adopted father.
“No. I have neither the knowledge nor experience to be confident in an individual’s strengths and weaknesses when it comes to work in this calibre. I will leave that to the experts. What I do request, however, is that they are competent. The must not forget that the wards they are working on are for the protection of CHILDREN.”
Tom laughed. “He said that he bets the Weasley red hair is a unique shade of red because they were originally the bonded pets of Satan’s Fire Demons.”
“What for?”
Bumbles wants me in his office before breakfast, so I’ll need to have my potion after the meeting. If I don’t turn up to either Nonos’ room or breakfast, I’m going to be in the Chamber working til I’m needed in defence.
It is the day after the sorting and the signing of the contracts. What surprises does today bring?
The next moment, the Professor was at the front door of the house of one Harry James Potter – and it was not what he had expected.  After he had gotten it past his brain that the Boy-Who-Lived lived in this plain, boring neighbourhood, his ears noticed yelling.
Pansy, to the surprise of many, found a lovely bonded in one Susan Bones. When asked about their relationship by someone outside The Pack and Amelia, it was Susan who tore into the nefarious gossip, verbally shredding the woman’s hide and reputation with such precision that Pansy, Luna and Narcissa took notes. Amelia, who had been spending her lunch break with the four of them, just smiled proudly at her niece. To the joy of both girls, they had welcomed two cubs of their own into The Pack and were responsible for the idea of The Pack taking in young victims of child abuse from muggle-born populations.
Walking into his room, he found his favourite outfit on the bed. Smiling, he changed, looking forward to later on that night.
Albus blinked in surprise. This man hadn’t heard of him? Where had he been all his life?
“Just do what you can without books,” Tobias said with a happy laugh, “If we all finish what we can, we can discuss the ones we’ve answered before moving onto the ones we haven’t.”
“Hello Sally-Ann,” Tobias smiled.
“We shall talk more about this revelation of yours after we have eaten, Mr Potter.”  With that, Voldemort swept from the room, leaving Harry to dress while Remus waited for him.
Nonos – Greek for Godfather
Tom knew that Tobias had to be nervous. Tomorrow was New Year’s Eve, so in two nights time, he was going to be bonded. Narcissa was going to be over in the morning with the bonding robes. Tobias already had everything else ready. Sighing, Tom closed the door and walked to his room. No matter how he looked at it, he felt as if he was going to lose his son in two days’ time. He just hoped he didn’t cry, no matter how much he felt the urge to.
Harry beamed, and then got a very Malfoy family smirk on his face. “I will go by Harry James Potter while with the Weaselbies, Pateras. I do not wish to, but I have the BEST idea of how to break the wondrous news. Do you mind if I go under the name ‘Black’ while at school?”
To everyone’s surprise, Tobias rose from his seat and moved until he could gather the young woman in his arms. “You were the Jewel of Ravenclaw Kyria – one of the few that Rowena herself would have chosen to personally train had you attended when she was alive,” he stated as he softly nuzzled the top of her head with his nose and cheek. “Do not feel ashamed or upset by the deplorable behaviour of the jealous.”
“Hello Father,” Luna said, not at all dreamy. “I see that Periwinkle found you.”
“Divine intervention,” Lucius stated seriously.
“Draco!”
“Sally-Ann,” Draco parroted with a half-smirk.
Tobias thought for a bit. “Honestly Pateras, I have no preference. I enjoy being with males more, but I can function well enough for a female too, so I will stand by your decision. May I ask one thing to be non-negotiable?” Voldemort nodded, puzzled at what this requirement was. “Can it not be someone related to me by blood?”
Sorry for the long wait peeps, I've been busy busy busy and every time I thought of doing this chapter I've felt like curling up into a little ball and weeping like a little girl, but as you can see, I got over it and am once more motivated into actually doing stuff that doesn't involve work and reading :3
The end of the story
Excitement filled the room and the Pack drew close together, quivering in excitement.
Is there no stronger word I can use
When he had completed, he placed the jar onto the bedside table and gently manoeuvred both Tobias and himself into a more comfortable position. With a soft press of lips to the top of the head before him, Draco also succumbed to the call of sleep.
He almost collapsed in relief when he noticed that the person called up was his godson. ‘It’ll be over soon,’ he thought to himself as he watched Lucius place the strongest truth spell he could safely use on his son-in-law.
Draco, meanwhile, was deep in thought. He was just finishing his mental plan on what he was going to do to one Deloris Umbridge when a soft cough snapped his attention back to what was going on around him.
“Thanks Kitten. Give me a bell when Gin is alone – and preferably fully clothed – and I’ll see her then. Keep an eye on the old goat, but don’t sabotage any of the plans. I’d like to see Sev when he has a spare moment, as well.”
Zog grinned. “Just like you know not to stand on ceremony with us.” Everyone laughed as Tobias stuck his tongue out at the Earth Daemon.
He shook his head slightly. At first, he hadn’t believed Lucius when he’d told him about the summer, but when he had viewed the memories in the pensieve; he hadn’t been able to control his laughter.
“Mondays after breakfast and last thing Fridays,” Tobias and Draco chorused.
The bonding is here! And meeting new friends :)
Severus did his normal ‘welcome to the end of your lives’ lecture, followed by a speech on the importance of their NEWT’s. By the time he’d finished, he set the class to taking notes on the first – and easiest – of the first batch of sixth year potions.
“I-I think I’ll take that as a ye,” Draco panted. Harry kissed him again. Lucius walked into the now silent Hall and laughed when he saw his son.
She smirked in satisfaction as the pale boy before her fainted.
The Pack looked back at Tobias, awe in their eyes. Ginny was the first to break the silence.
At Riddle Manor, four people were just finishing reading the letters they had received from the friend they had been ignoring for longer than they should have. The first man bowed his head and heaved a sigh of disgust. His son was correct; they should have factored in the pregnancy factor before turning on Severus as badly as they had. Inhaling deeply, he reached out for a roll of parchment and a quill. He had a lot to atone for with his old friend and he intended on doing it properly.
Tobias yelped and hid his face in Draco’s neck, causing him to chuckle. The muffled, ‘I hate you’ that came from there made everyone, including the adults who had followed them, laugh.
Minerva growled half-heartedly at the two red-heads before shaking her head in resignation.
“Who are you? What are you doing here? How are you here?” A baritone voice made them all turn fast enough to give them whiplash.
“I’d love one,” Tobias smiled.
She gave him a pitying look. “Hormones?'
Lucius blinked in shock. “What just happened?”
George grinned wider, “But others would call it ‘Vengeance’.”
Abstract: Harry runs the wizarding world with a firm, but fair hand – it isn’t until he is safely in his own home that he can reveal just who he really is.
One by one a seventh year student walked to the front of the hall and reported in.
“I guess this means we are going to their rooms then the library,” Millicent stated softly after several moments. “I have something I want to look up.”
Augusta – who had been holding the babe while making her grandson blush by alternating between telling stories of when he was a babe and hinting at wanting great grandchildren – hurried through the floo holding her precious bundle close to her chest. She knew that Tobias wouldn’t be following her through the fireplace and as the spinning stopped, she sent her thoughts to those left behind in the café.
“I know it is too little too late, but thank you for everything you’ve done for the boy. I can’t believe that I was fooled into believing he was safe. I want you to know that no matter what; I’m on the same side as young Mr Black.”
“This is my unbreakable to you, Lord – with these men as witnesses. So mote it be.”
Opals of an April dawn,
“Interesting,” Luna hummed, “What does it do?”
“What are we going to do?” he asked, voice shaking slightly. “How are we going to make this up to him?”
“And how is waking me from the first uninterrupted sleep I’ve had in a long time supposed to help me?”
Chuckles were heard from everywhere around the room as Luna and Ginny turned thoughtful.
“1X873-000IC,” Draco listed as he clunked around, hiding his own smirk.
Lucius cleared his throat nervously. “He and my son were soul bound this past Yule after which it was discovered that he is a natural bearer. There have been several attempts at forcing my son-in-law to abort their child – one in front of Randal and one before the Minister. I only want to ensure that no other child has been suffering needlessly.”
“Are you alright, Minerva?” Albus asked in concern, eyes twinkling without him knowing.
Tobias nodded. “I agree Ma’am.” He closed his eyes slightly “Is next Friday at lunch alright with you? I’m going to be busy till then.”
“Good news is the only damage done is slight bruising,” the older man said. “Better news is that orders from the Minister are that Dumbledore goes to you after his trail.”
Confused, Tom looked at the parchment before shaking his head and removing it so he could read it.
“It seems that my appointment book is surprisingly clear at this point in time, gentlemen.  I am … intrigued in what Mr Potter has to talk to me about.” With that, Voldemort – the Dark Lord of the age – followed the Malfoy heir into the flames
“No. That is why he got me and the twins to surround you in white sage smoke and iced water,” Luna explained, calming Tom down. “But I think that it is time for me to pull out my bag of tricks now.” She smiled a smile that made the adults in the room shudder in fear and The Pack to smirk. “I’ll deal with him when I get back.”
Only six of the seven were in the room as one of them had suddenly remembered that she had to send off a report. None of them minded all that much, considering that it was only the pink annoyance, but after hearing what was in the letter and then the viewing of the memory, the six remaining members had gone into shock. It was worse than what they had been expecting.
Kyria – Greek for Lady
Tobias pushed his almost empty bowl away from him with a badly concealed yawn.
“I am so proud of you, Neonegitto!” he whispered fiercely. “So is your father. He says he misses you and he is also very proud of you. The twins, Bill and Charlie say to congratulate you on stumping the old goat and for the warning you gave their brother.” Remus smirked. “I must say that you’re werewolf form is most definitely suited to you, and congratulations on your engagement contract signing. In one month’s time, you and your marked are going to be sent a port key. Your father, Lucius, Narcissa Severus and I all agreed on a ‘family’,” Remus winked on the word family, letting Tobias know that all the Death Eaters would be there, “party to celebrate the happy – and most welcome – news of your engagement. We will hold the public one during the Christmas Holiday Season.” Remus stopped to catch his breath, having said this in a rush.
Draco sighed in exasperation but nodded his head. “I will Love. You just rest for now.”
“Don’t make me request for someone to help me experiment Ateros,” Luna said dreamily. “Ronald will not last longer than this year, after all.”
Tom caught himself as he started to chuckle at the face on Cornelius Fudge’s face. “I heard that there was some trouble so I came to ensure my son is kept safe. I also would like to request that my personal healer be within reach of him as well as one of the Malfoy house-elves to prepare his food – he has special food requirements that I don’t trust to just anything to prepare.”
“Lady Longbottom.” Tobias called as Neville led his Grandmother away. When she turned, he smiled at her politely. “You may run into the Lestrange’s whilst you stay here. If they threaten you with anything, tell them you are under my protection. If they do anything without threatening you, call for Gios ek Skotadi and I will deal with them. I don’t think Bella dear will be any trouble though.” He bowed slightly and followed his father from the room.
Tom nodded in satisfaction and he moved into the room with a flourish, causing Tobias to laugh.
Fred, George, Bill, Charlie, Ginny and Luna sat around a card table playing exploding snap.
Rising, Neville shook his head in disgust at the rest of the school. Did they honestly believe that a Ravenclaw would need tutoring?  If anyone question it they had an answer for them, but just the thought of a Ravenclaw needing help with their studies was preposterous!
“It is good to see you talking things over, My Raven. Did you both enjoy your meal?”
“Would you like to wait for another day to view the memory? Minerva asked.
“I will talk to Professors McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick and Snape after our meal has been complete about finding you a new spot to stay in for the rest of our schooling. The matter of you and Ginny staying in the Room of Requirement however is of concern to me.”
Amelia blinked in shock, making Grapplefang laugh loudly.
“We thought.”
“The one that decorated everything in purple stripes?” Vincent asked, confused.
Tobias made his way into the crowded potions corridor. He knew the potions master had a class and that his spare lesson would be either a tutorial, potions making or inventory calculation. He hoped that whatever it was, that he’d be able to get a few words with Severus away from prying eyes.
“Why?” Severus asked in a pain-filled voice, making Tom flinch. “Why do you wish to remove the one thing that shows I am connected to the only family I have?”
Ron brushed absentmindedly at the things that were moving on his skin.
“Build it up with iron and steel,
“I’m worried about Weasley and Dumbles. Both have been too quiet. Granger has been too, but that is more to do with Miv and her parents.”
“Yes Milord. It does mean that Tobias is expecting. It is much too early to see the little one, but I can tell that there is someone growing in there. So I guess congratulations are in order, Milord.”
“What was that about?” Tobias asked, confused.
Standing outside the seating hall inside Malfoy Manor, Harry waited. He was wearing black Dragon leather pants with a silver chain-mail belt, a deep green, almost black, shirt that made his eyes look hypnotic, black boots with bronze buckles and stitching and – Harry’s favourite – a cloak with hood, Slytherin green in colour with the symbol that would signify his adoption – a snake wrapped phoenix – in silver. If he was startled when the door opened, he did not reveal it. He looked into the onyx eyes of his potions professor and nodded silently in greeting.
To Draco’s annoyance, the person who aided him the most in understanding what was happening was not Algernon, like he had thought, but Godric Gryffindor. Looking back, he should have realised that the best person to go to for advice and answers would be someone who had lived through what he was going through now. He sighed and shook his head with a disbelieving chuckle.
Booph cleared his throat, making the two humans jump. “We must leave you now. We will be back in 30 minutes to guide you to where you will meet up with The Mother and Father. After then, you will not see us again until the time for you to return arrives.”
Lucius nodded thoughtfully.
Tobias was intrigued. “Who said I was under the old coot’s clutches to begin with? Why couldn’t have I been playing a part?”
Tobias swallowed him whole before giving the wettest, sloppiest head job he could. He smirked at the disgusted look on Draco’s face before sinking slowly onto the swollen dick, relishing the slow burn.
The day after and another meeting.
“Our boys gave us a granddaughter,” Narcissa said with a soft smile.
“Neogennito!” Remus struggled to prevent himself from growling at his godson. “Explain. Now!”
Yes yes yes, it's another update. I hope that you all enjoy it :3
“What in the world was more important than reading a letter from your parent that was written on our Official Parchment?” Lord Patil growled. “Parchment, I might add, that is only used in times where the information is vital to the recipient.”
Draco paled even as he chuckled uncomfortably at the image. The thought of Salazar Slytherin behaving in such a manor was terrifying.
“You sound happy.”
“I do My Lord,” Lucius growled, frustrated with everything. “The Head Auror … Scrimager I think his name is … decided to use Aurors who were a part of the old man’s Order believing that they would be loyal to the Ministry first, even after it was bought to his attention that they were exceedingly close to the insufferable old man.”
“See?” Draco asked, laughter dancing in his eyes. “We wouldn’t have had a chance if we were buried under all this. We would have become very attractive but very flat pancakes.”
One shaking hand reached for the innocent-looking roll of parchment. When his godfather had stopped shaking and was reading with his jaw lowered slightly, Tobias swallowed, hoping against all hope that he had done the right thing.
Dobby nodded happily. “I know two elves that will be good for that. They are twinsies girl elfs. Young and very helpful. They are too young for duties of their own, but good for errands and being in young company.”
“For this … yes.”
Meanwhile, in the Slytherin common room, one of the more stupid seventh year students was on a rampage.
“The shop while –”
A little family time and one lucky idiot
Before him were three stacks of paper. One sat in a cedar box marked ‘reports’. A second sat in an oak box marked ‘Important Documents’. The third and centre pile, was the only one not in a box. On a sheet of parchment was a small note in his son’s narrow handwriting.
“What is it? Surely it can’t be that bad.”
“Thank you,” Tobias said with a soft smile. “It was lovely.”
“Five,” a soft male voice interrupted her, startling everyone into staring at the Potions Master, who was lost in his own memories. “One around each wrist, one around each ankle and one around his neck. The old man had him collared like a common mutt.” The man’s voice was soft and distant, almost sad as he spoke of what he had seen.
“Seeeeveeeeeeerus, I wanna get through!”
“Is it fair that I don’t pity them?” Tobias mused. “I have a feeling that Sev is going to get vindictive.”
Ron sighed in relief as the pieces of bridge spun slowly around him and each other as they came together as though someone had cast a reparo spell on the pieces. He grimaced slightly as the stone he had at his back turned to rough wood and dug into his flesh. He relaxed slightly as her heard the verse sung once more, but his blood froze when instead of going for a third time, the eerie soprano took over once more.
Zog chuckled. “Okay. We were first drawn to Akzant’tra when he was on the doorstep of the muggle’s house. We were on an errand for the Mother. She had felt something was off that night and sent us. We were drawn to this small sleeping babe. He was what the Mother had felt, so we gave him a gift – The ability for his magic to protect him by connecting to any predatory animal. So that we knew the little one was safe that night, we curled around him.”
“We do not wish to forget to respect you for who you are, not only for what you are. The one day that we do forget to react in this way will be the day you are here on official business.”
Tobias looked at Theo as if he had grown an extra head.
Harry gave a grin that had the hairs on the backs of everyone’s necks stand on end. “But Pettigrew … him I NEED to kill. He broke a wizard bond. I saved his life and he repaid me by getting Sirius killed. I told him a month before the first vision of Sirius that I wanted an audience with you to discuss the possibility of me, Siri and Remy joining you, but he went against it, and I want his blood!”
Fred and George exchanged looks and turned their smirking faces at the now scared older man. “You have no idea just how happy you just made us, Lord,” The first twin grinned.
“Those fifth years that have not yet been seen, please stay in your seats,” she called out. “We know who you are and punishments will be given if you do not stay. Sixth years also please remain seated. Everyone else my leave.”
“Just don’t judge what you do not know or understand. Magic needs all three types to survive properly. Everything MUST stay in balance.”
The questioner sighed and slumped in defeat. “What was your first impression of the accused?”
Draco smirked. “There are a lot of things that we can do without actual penetration. I would have thought that you would know that by now, seeing you are in a relationship with our Potions Professor. If not then …”
Both goblin and human blinked when the teen snuggled down in the chair, closed his eyes and fell asleep. Quietly, the two of them returned to what they were doing, both keeping an eye on the younger male.
Around his neck was a silver collar with a circular dog tag that rested in the hollow of Draco’s throat proclaiming him as the exclusive property of one Harry James Potter. Also attached to the collar were three chains. The first two were attached to the silver rings that were to be seen in Draco’s puffy red nipples, making each ring hold two separate chains that were pulling in opposite directions with every move he made while the third chain was attached to the back of the collar and lay heavily on his spine.
Tobias groaned, thinking he’d died and gone to heaven as his husband’s skilful hands mapped his body with long, firm strokes. Time seemed to fly by in a series of groans, moans and cracking joints as the slight pressure stored in them was released.
"What is it?” he asked wearily.
Draco was counting down the seconds until his ancient Runes class finished. He had left his fiancé in the hands of their godfather. Severus had somehow managed to convince the other teachers into setting holiday homework. To ensure that Tobias didn’t do any of it, Sev had collected as much paperwork he could to keep him busy – Not that Tobias was upset at that.
Minerva stared at the ceiling as the Healer did an in-depth scan on her body. She knew that she would take longer than the other staff members due to her age, so she asked to be done first and requested a cautionary scan of her mind. When the Healer cleared her of mind manipulation, she heaved a sigh of relief, much to Amelia’s confusion.
Severus found the blonde youth in the library curled up in front of the fire. With him were Blaise, Pansy, Ginny and Neville.
Amelia resisted the urge to scream. She had read out the names and tent numbers like she had for all of the other year levels and chaos had reigned. She rubbed her temples and grit her teeth against the pain as an annoyingly loud voice protested yet again.
~ I give you a gift of my own blood, given freely. I am the Alpha of my pack. My pack mates mean everything to me. We are closer than family. I am a pureblood wizard, my parents being of the magical world. I am the Founder’s Heir, with each of their four bloods flowing through my veins and their magic’s coursing through my body. I give the blood of my body willingly for it to be tested to prove I speak the truth of it. ~
Draco chuckled softly and hugged his intended tighter. “Don’t worry, Bi. If she touches me, I’ll feed her to the Oaf’s newest obsession. I’ll even ask him politely.”
“Too long,” she answered dryly. “Turned out that it was more malicious than what had been originally told. The young lady will never be the same, I’m afraid. I’ll never understand people like that.”
“Our silent partner gets a third of our profit while the two thirds we keep is divided into four. One fourth goes covers rent and bills for the shop and flat, one quarter goes to the two of us for spending on food and clothing and anything that takes our fancy. Another quarter goes towards supplies and the last quarter is put into an account at Gringotts,” Fred stated.
“Could the potion have been accidentally made from the stuff in your systems?” Tobias asked, putting his quill down with a frown.
Tom stood in the doorway, watching his son. Silently he walked in and laid a hand on his shoulder. “Sickle for your thoughts?”
Ginny lowered her quill with a sigh of relief. As she massaged her hand to alleviate the cramp, she looked around. Because there were more people in one group, she had been moved into the Slytherin/Ravenclaw group – for which she was grateful. When her eyes focused on her pack-sister, she realised that she was copying her movements.
“Do you swear to forgo your birth name for one of my choosing?”
Tobias hid a sly look by turning to snuggle deeper into Draco’s neck before covering it with a mask of indifference. “Very well. Those who wish to sleep in may do so. I shall be spending my time tomorrow escorting those who are awake at the said time around our new meeting place – and mine and Draco’s living space from when we are bonded. But, if you are all more concerned about sleep then visiting the Chamber of Secrets, I understand.”
“Sally-Ann,” she corrected with a small smile of amusement. She had given the bonded couple permission to call her by her first name an few weeks previous and the blonde teen was still struggling with it.
“That’s nice,” Tobias muttered, not really paying attention. Minerva laughed softly and transfigured one of the quills on her desk into a blanket to cover the sleeping teen with. Running a gentle hand through the teen’s hair one last time, she returned to walking around the group who were working so diligently. She shook her head in dismay when she realised that of the four houses, only her own house was not represented.
“I was out for a week,” Tobias said softly, “so was Gran’ther Sal in all his pregnancies.”
Hani – Female vampire; Pronounced Har-Knee
“Can you make fruit salad containing whatever fruit you can find. No dairy, no sugar, no herbs. Make sure that it is alright for an unborn babe. Try to keep the regular fruits to a minimum.” He sneered at the trembling elf between them. “And take this poor excuse of a creature with you. Maybe you can teach it how to grow at least half a brain cell!”
Luna happily prepared the next part of her plan, humming a bouncy tune that Neville was positive was supposed to be dark and depressing. Shrugging it off as Luna being Luna, he turned his attention to the passed out idiot before him.
Tobias gave the older woman a self-depreciation half-smile. “Thank you Professor. I do know this but today y brain is feeling a little scrambled.”
“They would be having something to eat with Severus in their room,” Lucius stated. “When they become … amorous … it is har –
Everyone in the room watched in fascination as the liquid disappeared down the boy’s throat. Laughter followed when Remus tried to remove the goblet from his hand before it had been licked clean. When he managed to remove it, he spoke.
“In terms of negotiation … No,” Tobias said. “In terms of a third party who is neutral, yes. Do you know of someone who can fulfil that positon?”
Severus pondered this. He had experienced this child’s challenging and changing palette first hand. It wasn’t that his tastes were getting more expensive – just more … limited in what it could handle.
“There are two problems I can see,” the Healer announced eventually. “You have a few blocks on your core that will need to be removed as soon as possible. I’m sorry to say that I can’t do anything about them due to their age.”
Those who were focused on the still flaming footprints noticed that the flames had formed a small wolf and small feline that were pouncing and rubbing along each other before joining Tobias and leaning on him.
“So they are your twins now are they?’ Amelia said with a soft chuckle and an exchange of amused grins with her fellow Ministerial worker.
Tobias nodded. “Your job will be to create and cook my meals and snacks every day. If you agree you will be given a list of my dietary needs and the potions that I need to take and the times and amount I need them. As payment you will get a ball of wool every fortnight and a pair of socks as a bonus every six to twelve months.”
Draco nodded and snapped his fingers, calling a house-elf to him. “Start a bath then go to The Lord and tell him I wish for Healer Longbottom to attend lunch if at all possible.”
“How the Hell.”
“First even is the snow angel making competition. This event requires only one team member to participate. Rules are: No magical aid and no sabotage.
“In other words,” Lady Zleva said with a grin, “don’t piss off your son or son-in-law.”
Achalendra bowed once more to Tobias, ignoring her. “I thank you for this. We shall stop taking up your time. Padma, it is time for us to go.  Amelia.” He nodded his head at the amused woman.
“You may remain here,” Grapplefang relied as he and the other goblins stood. “Just send us a flame when you have come to a decision.”
He watched as Tobias finished up his breakfast and stood to leave the Hall, giving Draco a soft kiss on the top of his head. Shaking his head, Severus turned his attention to his own breakfast, so he didn’t see the group that left the tables right after his charge did.
“We know it was you who tried to terminate Tobias’ pregnancy – and we know that it was the old coot that ordered you to do it – He will get his, just as you will get yours. But until then, you are mine,” she whispered, a near malicious look in her baby blue eyes. “Let me introduce myself. My name is Luna Lovegood; otherwise known as Kyria of the Death Wolf Pack. I’m the Torture Expert, and you will be my first human specimen.” She smirked. “I’ve been told I have a very rare talent for my art.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m going to kill Ron!” Harry hissed. “He almost broke your arm in three places. He DID break your wrist and three fingers! Pomphrey didn’t do her job well enough! I understand about leaving us to heal naturally, but she damn well should have scanned us for serious injuries! If your fingers and wrist had set like this you wouldn’t have been able to use your wand properly every again! This is really going to hurt, Draco. I’m really sorry. Ready? One … Two …”
Severus and Draco exchanged semi-amused looks, but even they had to admit that the potion would make it worse. Leaving Tobias to sleep, Severus and Draco returned to the main school building, still slightly in shock. Realising the time, the two Slytherins split – Draco to go to the Slytherin commons, where he would need to inform The Pack as to what was going to happen, and Severus to go to Dumbledore’s office to tell him his ‘other master’ was calling.
“He started killing aimlessly – men, women, children, muggle, magical … none of it mattered. Then came the day a prophecy was made to Albus Dumbledore in my hearing. It concerned the Dark Lord so I ran and told him what I had heard. When I discovered he was targeting Lily, I went straight to Albus begging him for their protection. He agreed on one condition – I was to spy for him. I agreed and so began my life on the side of light.”
“Blaise, you are disowned from the Greengrass family for crimes against said family,” the healer stated, white-lipped in anger.
Luna and Neville smirked as they saw Ron drifting between being awake and being asleep. With a nod from Luna, Neville smugly raised the spell that would protect his her Luna’s identify and he watched as Luna slowly faded into a mist formed body with two black holes where her eyes should be, knowing that he looked exactly the same.
With a slight inclination of their heads, they stood as one and half-carried, half dragged the girl-turned-bird to the hospital wing. Tobias cleared his throat and gained everyone’s attention.
A voice full of humour echoed around them. “Of course Sal. Do not worry about forgetting about me, Bi – I know things have been busy for you. Now, if you will all please look towards the blank wall, I have a memory to show you.”
“Are you disappointed with me, Pateras?”
Severus walked into his classroom, only to see the one person he didn’t want to see anywhere near a cauldron.
“I don’t understand,” Hermione scowled.
Tobias leaned back into Draco, his eyes half-closing. “Your words of poison are worthless to us, so please stop polluting the air, it is necessary for humanities survival.” Tobias turned and kissed Draco smack-bang on the mouth before leading him to the seats at the front of the classroom.
“Because he’s seen it.” Multiple gasps were drawn from everyone’s throat before turning and bowing lowly to their Lord. Tobias walked forwards to hug the man.
Falling down, falling down.
“Thank you for answering ma’am,” Tobias bowed slightly. “I have been wondering that for nearly two years now-ever since the tournament. I made a few friends from both schools and they told me about their systems for tutoring.”
“He does that very well, doesn’t he?” Millicent asked softly, her voice sounding just as green as she looked.
“So he can check you again. You’ve been tiring faster than normal. I just want to make sure that no light wizard or witch has hit you with anything.”
“Really?”
Once properly attired – Draco in black silk pyjama pants and Tobias in blue – They stumbled over the bed where they quickly fell into a relaxed sleep, with Draco holding Tobias as if he were the most fragile thing on the face of the Earth.
Raithia bowed deeply to the blonde and the portrait opened slowly. Tobias walked in without a sound. A sharp intake of breath soon followed as the members of his pack noticed the surrounding. Tobias grinned manically as he looked around.
Tobias almost smiled at her. “It’s due to what I went through earlier this summer. My guardians originally came to me because I was restricting my own magic by living in fear of what would happen to me if I didn’t. This summer found me with my magic bound against my will and by people who I trusted to do the right thing by me. My guardians were still there, but as they originated from my core magic, the bands bound them as well. Once the bands had been removed and my magic flared, my guardians also had to release some of their bound magic, therefore binding them to me tighter still. Now, if I am ever in that position again, then the guardians will be able to protect me, and if they can’t do anything due to their power base being locked up, they can force my body to change into their shape.”
“Since we cannot play with my knives, we’ve decided to give you a concert,” the misty voice returned. Oh, I’m sure you will love it!” she half squealed, which freaked Ron out more than anything.
“I wish to join your ranks, milord,” he stated. He glanced at Remus. “Remus too, wishes to join.”  He bowed deeply to the older man.  “We are yours to mark as you will.”
“Hey!” He yelped. “What was that for?”
“Early Friday evening I found Miss Granger in the library and getting rather flustered. Thinking it odd, I offered her my assistance – as long as she told me what it was she was researching. I wasn’t about to help her with schoolwork, after all. She told me she was looking up bonding bands. Thinking that maybe Mr Weasley had gotten her pregnant, I asked why.”
“OH! You have burning herbs too!” he squealed excitedly. “Can I burn mine?”
“I’m sure they are fine. After all, none of them will abandon anyone.”
Draco pulled Tobias closer. “I forgive you, ‘Bi. I know that it was the hormone acting up, but some of what The Pack and I do in retaliation is because of our need to protect you and the little one. It’s worse when we don’t spend a lot of time with you since we get antsy.”
Chapter 25
Ron shuddered at the sight of another, unknown, mist hand and whimpered at the sound of the unknown voice, his mind running through all the horrible things this stranger could do to him.
All the students who had studied under the woman hissed or groaned in annoyance as the dreaded pink-clad form tittered.
Minerva cleared her throat. “May I be the first to present-” She paused to look down at the names that had appeared on the certificate before her. “Misters Draco and Tobias Riddle-Malfoy.”
“How do you feel, Pateras?” he asked, handing him a glass of water.
Remus frowned. “What does that mean? Aks … Akzant’tra?”
Vincent bowed slightly. “Thank you for giving your blessing Alpha.”
“Can’t,” George continued sharply when one of the men they didn’t know opened his mouth, “Not won’t.”
Tom nodded. He understood how the younger man felt. He just wished he would keep his son and son-in-law away from the Headmaster until he’d been dealt with.
“Sevie!” Tobias squealed, making Severus pale. The only person to ever call him ‘Sevie’ before just now was a hyperactive …
Tobias nodded at Severus, who gave Neville what looked to be a black banana. “And this brings us to our next sweet. We call them ‘Gons’. These are the opposite of the ‘Chatters’ and are the only way to quickly warn up someone who has eaten one, but the reverse is also true. Unlike the skiving snack boxes, these two cannot be made into the same sweet, because they cannot touch. If put together they react ... violently - and cancel out the other’s effect.”
“Wands away, parchment and quills out!” he barked. “Weasley, just what in the nine levels of Hell do you think you are doing? I said ‘wands away’ not ‘point them threateningly towards the nearest pregnant person’.” He stood between the wand and his godson. “Now WEASLEY!” he roared when the idiotic red-head just blinked at him. He smirked as the boy moved to comply and stalked the rest of the way. “I was going to allow you time to read and summarise the chapter on antidotes and cures but instead, thanks to Mr Weasley’s inability to follow simple instructions, you will instead be doing a test on the subject instead. No books or parchment on the desks, only your quill will be. You have until the end of this lesson to complete it,” he stated as he sent the papers out wandlessly. “If you haven’t answered at least three-quarters of the paper it will be an automatic fail. You get marks for correct answers and for deductive reasoning so you can get some marks even if you get the wrong answer. You do not get marks for putting your name on the paper. You may start now.”
“Then the spiced hot chocolate he’s been drinking since he got here,” Remus’ amused voice came from behind the blonde. “He wanted to see the library but Lucius was terrified for the benefit of his books and so has banned Neogennito from the library until the next time they come back.”
Zog rolled his eyes and a smooth, silky chuckle echoed around the room.
Conversations amongst individuals broke out and for the first time in a long while, The Pack acted as a normal group of teenagers – ones who had no idea a war was going on.
Draco was in heaven. His husband was pinned under him in the throes of passion, and his hair was being tugged on spasmodically every time the god beneath him begged for more. He had sped up til he was pounding into the depths of his husband’s body and he could feel the tell-tale signs that indicated his climax was building. The continual chant of “Yes! Oh Gods yes!” from beneath him, revealed that Tobias’ was building as well. Continuing with his thrusting, he moved the legs that were around his waist back to his shoulders and thrust harder.
Neville chuckled. “She’s got us there.” He shook his head in amusement. It was so easy to underestimate the young blonde girl, but she was in Ravenclaw for a reason – something the Pack normally had no trouble remembering. Neville privately blamed their forgetfulness on the revelation of just how scary a place Luna’s mind really was.
Augusta looked at her grandson in confusion. Smirking, Neville explained about the things Tobias did to Bellatrix. Her laughter echoed in the empty halls.
“The Slytherin Quidditch team is working harder and cleaner than I’ve ever seen them. They are more focused on the game and everyone is playing harder than ever – even when you were our opponent.” Draco smiled to soften the blow. He knew how much it hurt the younger teen to still be banned from Quidditch form the previous year. Tobias smiled sadly back.
“I promise,” Draco chuckled. Who would have guessed that the storage person his husband was would become so child-like when he was pregnant. He blinked for a moment. Maybe he should talk to Algernon about that …
“Sorry Love. I wanted to taste you. Forgive me?”
“I didn’t tell him. He was waiting for me in the floo room …”
“Thank you Mr Black …”
Seeing the throat that was bared to him, Draco attacked it viciously with lips, tongue and teeth – marking the tanned skin as his. The loud, needy sounds coming from said throat only made him more demanding. When he pulled back to look at his artwork, his husband was mewling softly for more, and there was not one spot on the throat that wasn’t either red with teeth marks or black with love bites. He lowered his head so he could plunder the lips of his husband and moaned.
Draco nodded a small smile on his lips. “Yes Sev. He did just stroke my cheek and hug me in the Potion’s Lab.”
“I am Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
As soon as the words left his mouth, the Great Hall exploded into sound Severus sat stunned in his spot at the Staff Table. He couldn’t believe that this was happening. As the Aurors snapped the magic suppressing cuffs on his wrist, he locked his eyes on those of The Pack. All of them looked to Tobias who nodded once and Severus watched as Neville, Luna, Ginny, Theo and Blaise left the room without notice.
Draco was shocked when Tobias leant forward and placed a soft, chaste kiss to his lips – just a gentle brush of lips really – but where their lips touched was burning pleasantly long after both boys had drifted off to sleep. Tobias’ head resting on Draco’s chest, right over his steadily beating heart.
“Trapped,” he answered honestly. “I’m stuck in a cage. I want to go outside. I want to see PEOPLE. I understand not wanting me to go to the classes we share with the Gryffindors, but forbidding me from going to History of Magic which only has four other people in it – three of whom are our Pack and the other is the person whose sister is buying us the muggle foods I am craving at the moment is going too far. I’m lonely Draco,” Tobias admitted, tears in his eyes. “I see you for meals and bed. I see the rest of The Pack – bar Nev, Gin and Luna – for breakfast and dinner and I see Nev, Gin and Luna in passing on my way here once a day. I don’t even see Severus. He just locks me in here and disappears.”
“I am yours to mark, Lord. I do not trick you, neither am I a spy. I tire of the twinkle-eyed bastard’s manipulations and no longer wish to be manipulated under the guise of being cared for. I swear loyalty to you.” A flare of green light engulfed them.
Sally-Ann gave a shallow curtsy and returned to her table.
Draco used his magic to slam open the doors to the Great Hall, fury in every line of his body. Everyone in the room went silent and watched the blonde wearily as he glided menacingly towards the Head Table.
“Yes Alpha,” the entre Pack chorused before laughter sprang from their mouths.
“As for your statement that MY child is a bastard – conceived out of wed-lock – and that Draco is not the Father,  can assure you that both Draco and myself were judged to be virgins at the time of our bonding by magic herself. Even you should know that magic counts someone as a virgin until they WILLINGLY give themselves to someone.”
“Yes, he is,” Narcissa stated icily, still glaring at the man. “And he is currently on my ‘wish to kill but have been ordered not too’ list.”
Draco and Neville exchanged relieved looks while Severus smiled and Tom, Narcissa and Lucius looked horrified.
Draco felt a real smile curl his lips. “I accept this courtship gift, milord and I pray to the gods that I am worthy of your attention.”
The students all climbed onto the train, talking softly about what the twins had just told them.
Tom, Lucius and Remus exchanged looks of amusement and shock as they looked at the package that Thanatos had just delivered to them. In the centre of the triangle the three men made was a red headed male with blank eyes wearing a pale yellow and grey ball gown, lilac choker, silver bracelets and a ring made of mother of pearl. On his feet were a pair of sparkling pink stilettoes and, taped over his mouth, was a scrap of parchment.
“The contract between one Fred Weasley and one Padma Patil.”
“Resting is the main one, but there are supplements that can be taken and a potion that may help.”
Gasps sounded in the room.
“Surely you can’t mean that,” Mr Zabini pleaded, forgetting the others around him.
Amelia smiled when she stepped into the room holding the last two students to examine.  She had purposefully left these two for last because not only were they the reason for this occurring but the other members of the council had requested to be present for the last one.
Dobby pat his foot in understanding and made his move.
Luna and Ginny were the first members to get to the door separating them from the watery sunshine. With a joyful laugh, that was echoed in the group behind them, the two girls threw themselves at them before taking off at a playful run. One by one the other Pack members joined in until only Tobias, Draco, Theo and Pansy were not running.
Hermione nodded. “I’ve been here since the Library opened this morning, and I can’t find anything in any of the books I’ve looked in.”
I need you like I needed you then
“Want to come wiv you,” the sleepy blonde pouted, making Tobias chuckle softly.
“I never thought I would have this,” Tobias’ soft voice said, breaking Draco from his thoughts once again. “I’m glad to have shared it with you.”
A sharp rapping interrupted a tall, sallow-faced, dark-haired man from the bubbling cauldron before him.  Grumbling to himself about nothing having respect for the delicate nature of potions and about people who had nothing better to do on a full moon then to change into a wolf and attack everything in sight, meaning he had to make another delicate potion just for someone else to interrupt in a delicate stage, he stormed to the window. He stopped in surprise when he saw the pure white snowy owl tapping at the window. He knew that owl. He quickly opened the window and removed the parchment from its leg.  The owl then flew towards the owlery, as if she were going to sleep there.  Shaking his head in resignation, he opened the letter.
“Amelia?” Minerva asked uncertainly.
Greg, being the tallest of them, plucked it out of the air and read it out loud.
‘Though I must admit,” Neville though with more than a little pride, ‘Luna’s idea of making us seem like young children was perfect. There is just something more terrifying seeing a mist child with black holes for eyes compared with an adult or near adult.’
To everyone bar Randal’s surprise, Lord Patil nodded and gave a shallow bow. “I will do so.” Just before the man left the room, Tobias called out to him thoughtfully.
The Pack nodded at Madam Pince as they entered the library before splitting up and heading to the shelves that held their strongest subjects. After half an hour all eleven of them returned with four or five books each, waiting patiently for their turn at being addressed by the Librarian
Pateras,
“I … apologise Lord Malfoy,” Wu said, looking away in shame. “I wronged you most grievously. Please accept my most humble apology.”
“I heard Pateras and Algernon. I know Algie needs to check me over so I got up so Kyria wouldn’t be  disturbed by the extra magic around me.” Tobias’ eyes flicked to the only intruder amongst his family. “If Mr Wu keeps going, send him to me since the majority of the secrets Lucius is keeping are mine.”
“Go on. Drink it. You need it.”
“What are everyone’s plans for tonight?” Tobias asked softly after pushing the almost completely empty bowl away from him.
“Yes. I wished to introduce my followers to our newest allies. As their leader, why don’t you make the introductions?”
“Thirdly,” he continued when he realised that no one was speaking, “where the hell were you when the Death Eaters attacked?”
Blaise’s eyes widened further still. That was … more than a little potent
Lucius carefully removed his granddaughter from Tobias and silently left the room, allowing the Father and son to their bonding.
‘How the Hell did you manage to keep your job?” Algernon asked. “I lost mine because some idiot in a high position refused to accept that magic can’t fix anything.” He turned in obvious dismissal of the fuming Healer in favour of addressing the twins. “If you will take a seat outside, Amelia and I will go over your lists and decide whether it will be me who goes into the mine field that is your mind or someone who is better suited for it.”
“I have a feeling that The Pack will be sitting for their NEWTS at the end of this year,” Sev put in, helping himself to strong tea. “I have noticed that all the members help each other with all the homework. Someone who is strong in one subject works on their assignments with those who are weak in the subject. When all the subjects have been done, the assignments are then exchanged so everyone can read them. And everyone adds little bits of information to each assignment in different coloured ink before they are handed back to the original author, who then re-writes it to include any extra information that had been added and to correct spelling and grammar that they had missed. Once that had been re-written, they make a duplicate and give it to the subject’s strongest; who reads all of them to make sure that nothing is copied, either from a book or from someone else.”
Tom poked out his tongue before getting a mischievous look in his eye and launched himself at his son. “Mmmm cuddly,” he stated as he snuggled up to his laughing son, who was now in his arms. “Let’s get ready for this meeting. You will be sitting with me.”
The raven-haired youth looked around the room and laughed internally. Ron was partnered with Pansy, Hermione with Blaise, Dean was with Vince and Seamus with Greg. Draco, he was annoyed to discover, was partnered by Lavender Brown, while he was partnered with Neville – who had gotten into the class due to the Headmaster’s manipulations.
He stopped and waited patiently as soft murmurs came from the students gathered. When they didn’t stop after a few moments, he cleared his throat, causing them all to freeze in memories of a high pitched ‘hem hem’ coated in pink.
Minerva laughed softly as she looked up from helping the few students who had come to her for help to see one of her favourite students reading a piece of parchment with his nose scrunched up and taking long, slow blinks as he fought off sleep. She pat the first year she was helping on the head softly, disregarding the colour of the badge on her uniform, and made her way back to the pregnant young man.
Tobias stretched lazily and snuggled into the warm breathing pillow beneath his head. He wasn’t sure about what woke him til a soft giggle and a soft chorus of ‘Aww’s’ reached his ears.
“As soon as we get him upstairs, we will write to Draco telling him not to worry,” the teen holding Tobias stated in amusement.
“Welcome back to the Snake-pit. I hope you all had an enjoyable break. As you all know tomorrow is our first day of the new term. All I ask of you tonight is that you get a good night’s sleep. Try not to wake the young Lord and his husband; I doubt they’ve had much sleep this past week. If they do wake before you are all in bed, please tell them I wish to see them. Lights out is at 10. Now, enjoy your evening.”
Draco blushed slightly. “Last night, Father.”
* * *
The sound of scales gliding over a hard surface sounded. Seeing a glimpse of the guardian from the corner of his lowered eyes, Tobias bowed deeply. The Guardian chuckled.
“Did we get.”
“After Tobias finishes eating what was brought up from the kitchen for him,” Draco stated dryly.
“Our beast speaker, Hemerotes – Tamer,” Charlie stepped to the front and removed his cowl, “and our dark mage, Katara – Curse.” Bill stepped up beside his younger brother and removed his cowl. The two of them separated, but stayed at the front of the cleared space.
He was forced out of his thoughts by a sharp knock on his door that made him jump. With another quick glance at the pair on the bed, he rose and hurried to his door.
“Very happy indeed,” the other said with an identical grin. “And the reason we are back again makes this wondrous event so much sweeter!”
Everyone was jolted out of their shock and anger when they heard a yelp of shock and a soft thump echoed in the small room. Turning in panic, the tension eased when, one by one, the adults in the room started chuckling at Lucius, who – at seeing Draco on the ground with Tobias on top of him nuzzling and licking his bare stomach – covered his eyes with a small shriek.
“Are you going to be coming with us?”
Tobias turned thoughtful and while he was thinking, Draco softly called Dobby.
Draco rose from the bed and pushed them out of the room with his magic. “We will see you as soon as we get dressed.”
Lucius sighed and rubbed his temples. “The reason this enquiry is occurring is due to a good friend of mine. He blood-adopted one of the students over the summer break. It would have taken nearly seven months to heal the young man of everything that was wrong with him with the combined skills of Potions Master Snape, I, Lady Malfoy, my friend – who is currently going by Randal Black as it is too dangerous for us to use his real name at this point in time – and Randal’s personal healer. That is, if the young man hadn’t been chosen as a phoenix bonded. As it is, he has strong intolerances to a fair few foods and his bones are still easily strained.”
Both twins grimaced as George swallowed it and his skin rippled as though hundreds of small insects were crawling beneath it. Within minutes, a replica of Ronald Weasley stood amongst them.
Luna noted the flurescent purple breast and deep pink beak and talons as Ginny exclaimed, “Lycia! What news have you bought form the mischief makers from Tartarus?”
“She could almost be in Slytherin, that one,” Pansy gasped.
Tom started to pout more, but he then noticed the white sage that was burning in one corner.
Melody
The elf nodded. “He is in the big room of Books. When Binky went to find him, Binky nearly got buried.”
“And this just proves that you are not of the feline species,” Severus sneered playfully at the pouting man.
Bill chuckled. “I don’t think that’s right, but it does have something to do with the status the Weasley family held in the past. The Weasley family – unlike what everyone believes – have not always been a light family, but that is a discussion for another day.”
Tobias moaned at the empty feeling and at his husband’s words. He wanted something to fill him – something larger then Draco’s tongue – and he knew exactly how to get it. Using all the strength in his abdomen, back and legs, he escaped from Draco’s grasp and vanished behind the Willow trunk, where there was a slow-flowing stream.
“Who is it?” Neville asked.
Tobias pouted. “Meanie.”
“Yes, Luc. He just admitted that he was a bottom – the subservient partner.” Severus glared at Narcissa. “Are you quite happy now, ‘Cissa? We now know more about your son’s soon-to-be-rampant sex life, which I, for one, didn’t need to know about.” Severus stormed out after his too-awake godson, his robes snapping with tension while an amused Lucius and a subdued Narcissa followed him.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “We will do so Sir,” he said, smiling indulgently as Tobias piled a large spoonful of both jars onto his sandwich before biting into it and moaning in pleasure at the taste. “We have to write to thank her for the gifts anyway. Maybe she will be able to get us more of them – I will give her the money for it.” He turned to the Ravenclaw still before them. “Thank you. You didn’t need to do any of this.”
“And Molly still maintains that your business is going to fail?” Minerva asked incredulously. “The two of you have managed to do something that business men and women have had trouble with for a long time – that of what to do with ideas that have failed.” She laughed abruptly, “You are getting rich on your mistakes!”
Draco moaned and moved Tobias’ hands back to his head. “Don’t be scared to hurt me, Love. I know I will hurt you when I enter you, so don’t worry about doing it back, and remember to relax.” Manuvering Tobias’ legs so they were over his shoulders, he used on hand to guide the head to Tobias’ entrance and lowered himself enough to latch onto the lips he couldn’t get enough of. He felt Tobias tangle his hands in his hair as he kissed back and before he could hesitate, he pushed his hips forward, moaning at the feeling of the tight ring of muscle giving way under the continuous pressure he was administering, until he was buried balls deep in his husband’s depths.
After a short break, Harry started thrusting at a punishing pace, holding Draco’s head and upper body off the desk top by the chain attached to his collar. Draco had, it appeared, passed out from the original entry and that meant that Harry had to do everything himself. With a few more thrusts, Harry came once more before pulling out and replacing the butt plug.
Sev started to tell him about all the dreams while he struggled to stop his voice from shaking. When he finished, Draco looked thoughtful. “So they are only mild at the moment. That is good. We can stop them from getting worse with little to no hassle.”
“He certainly named the two of you appropriately,” she sighed. “You have several people who want to discuss the events of today with you – amongst other things.”
The beginning of Hermione's worst nightmare
“I need to talk to you Alpha, about a personal matter.”
The only response he was given was the patented Malfoy smirk and a glance towards the door where Tobias had just left.
Gregory Goyle – Skia [Shadow] – Guard; best with dagger
Severus blinked in shock. “Last I checked he wasn’t showing any sign of depression.”
“You question the person I chose for my heir?” Lucius asked smoothly, making Deloris choke.
Draco almost moaned at the coy look his bonded shot at him. Leaning over, he licked the outer shell of the ear closest to him. “How about we shower up, go see our family and friends and when it comes to nightfall, we’ll see what happens?” His voice was husky desire and velvet seduction to the ears of his slightly younger husband.
Harry waited outside Severus’ private study for several moments before knocking.
“And bring something to eat – sandwiches will do for The Pack, but make ‘Bi something more substantial.”
~Thank you Guardian. May I ask whether there is a name you wish to be known as? ~
Tom growled at him.
Draco slowly opened his eyes as the soft chiming wormed its way into this awareness. It had been surprisingly easy to slip into a meditative state once he’d dressed in the plain white robes. He smiled softly as he remembered what he had seen in the deepest pit of his heart. He and his husband had been lying on a blanket by a lake. A black haired boy of about eight sat beside them holding the hand of a two-year old girl with his face and his husband’s hair and eyes. By the way his and Tobias’ hands rested on Tobias’ extended stomach, he guessed that they were expecting another child.
Sally-Ann breathed out a sigh of relief and smiled. “I’m glad to hear that they are all right. I was worried when I didn’t see Tobias this morning.”
Before Severus knew what was happening, he was seated in the Dark Lord’s study with Remus beside him and Lucius stepping out of the floo.
“She will make a full recovery,” Vincent said with a smile. “I am going to wake her soon for her own noodles in broth. Would you mind us spending the night with you? I don’t trust the girls in her room and I doubt they would allow me to sleep in their common room with her.”
Luna nodded and took a small mouthful. “Transfig, Divination, Astronomy.”
“Fred wants to court Angelina,” Tobias said with a sigh. “They have been dating for two years. I don’t have anything against Padma joining The Pack because she is a hardworking, discrete woman who will listen to what we have to say, compare it to what she already knows and form her own conclusions. Pavarti on the other hand …”
Every jaw in the room, bar those of the two with their heads bowed, dropped. Standing before them was a large Earth Daemon. Looking at his claws, they noticed they were the exact replicas of the claws in the bond mark of the two boys.
“Of course!” Fred exclaimed, indignant at the thought of Pansy even thinking the two of them couldn’t.
Tobias whined softly when he felt the soft pressure at his entrance. The whine turned to a pleading whimper as the slick muscle gently probed into him. As Draco’s tongue wriggled its way into him, it took all of Tobias’ mental strength to not start begging. It wasn’t long before the soft whimpers became desperate pleading as Draco speared him with his tongue over and over.
“I SPENT A FULL THIRTY MINUTES TELLING YOU I HAD PLANS BEFORE YOU SILENCED ME AND TAPED MY MOUTH SHUT WITH SPELLOTAPE!” Draco roared, leaping towards his father, fully intending on choking him.
Remus shook his head, still laughing. “N-no Sir. He has been that … starved, I guess you could say - that his animagus form has partially merged with his mind. At least that is what Sev and I have guessed at.”
Tobias swallowed his mouthful. “Do you want a job Dobby? I need an elf I can trust as my own cook while I’m with child.”
“This is where we leave you. We will see you whenever we can.” The daemon disappeared.
Everyone nodded decisively, chorusing ‘understood.”
The wall hiding the Snake Pit opened as he approached, allowing him entrance as the Head of House. He blinked as he entered to find … Chaos.
“What …” he began before being cut off by Draco pressing his lips to his own.
Harry, however, said, “Remus! I wondered when you’d get here; even though I’d have appreciated it if I had been told by you that you were fu…” he paused, before changing the word he was going to use, “dating my potions professor. If you’re wondering, I approve.” He swallowed the next potion before saying to the gob-smacked man in the doorway, “don’t worry, Remy. I’m not interested in him like that.” He turned to Severus.
Tobias laughed, “Whatever you say Pateras.”
“I understand, my sweet. I thought we were covered with neither of us taking the pregnancy potion. It seems that I have a special person with me.”
~ Guardian of the Founders, I call upon thee in the hope you will grace us with your presence. ~
“You have my permission for both of these requests to be fulfilled,” Tobias replied. “May I enquire as to why you wish Padma to remain with us?”
“Neogennito?” he asked carefully. Harry answered by looking at him, before moving so he could watch him, while still lapping at the red liquid dripping from the deer.
Tobias’ pout grew and another hand touched his other shoulder.
“I needed to say it,” Tom admitted in a stage whisper.
Tobias paled slightly. “How did Drakontas react? Is he mad at me? What about Pateras and Lykos?”
Tobias’ eyes widened at Draco’s words and he kept his hands where they were knowing that Draco would do it. It seemed as if Draco had discovered his biggest kink.
“But we miss our pack so is it possible to head back to school?” Luna asked.
Draco stood and walked towards the group around Severus, leaving Tobias wedged between Vincent and Gregory. “What is the meaning of this?” he asked, crossing his arms and raising an eyebrow.
Tobias flamed into the dungeons only moments before Severus opened the door to the potions lab. Draco saw the look on his face and hugged him lightly. When the door did open, Tobias pulled Severus to one side and thrust his memory of the event into his mind. The man paled further than the class thought possible and left the dungeons at a run.
The humans followed the goblin into his office. Before sitting in the chairs offered, Tobias and the Weasley twins bowed deeply to the other goblins – who had gathered in the room – and Madam Bones. The Patil family hurried to copy their example and within moments they were all seated.
Harry smiled widely at the man, even as he mentally compared the slimy-looking character to a wide array of internal parasite common to human kind. “I plan on not leaving my house while drinking tea by the gallon, eating whatever food my elves feel I should eat and spend the rest of my time playing with my pet. He’s such an adorable little kitten.”
“No offence, Sir, but you’re old enough to be my father, and you’re not my type. I prefer blondes.” He smiled half-heartedly.  Once more, Voldemort roared with laughter.
“To.”
Meetings meetings and more meetings. The poor members of The Pack
“Then he must be extremely weak to be defeated that easily.”
“Which do you think it was?” Draco asked.
Neither of them noticed the silence as they looked deeply into each other’s eyes.
“What do you mean?” Blaise asked, deep in thought.
The twins released both owls at the same time, chuckling. They had to report this to The Pack.
“You’ll never learn, will you Lucius?” Severus groaned.
She blinked a few times then smiled slightly. “That is fine with me, Mr Longbottom. Sorry for not answering straight away, I didn’t recognise you at first.”
The Pack exchanged looks. This person must be bad for The Lord to start rambling.
“Or they knew and di it purposefully so that it didn’t work while they could still say they had given it to us,” Fred finished.
“Ah, there you are Minerva!” a very unwelcome voice said. “And you found two of our missing students. I’m going to assume that you will handle their punishment?”
Lucius nodded and wrote to hide his smirk. “Registration number?”
“Silver and gold will be stolen away,
After removing her toys and healing the damage they had caused, Luna checked the red-haired teen’s vital signs before indicating to Neville that she needed help returning him to his bed.
Ronald Weasley couldn’t believe his eyes as he watched the boy transform into a large bird of prey of some kind and then disappear in a flame. He knew that as soon as he’d manoeuvred his ex-friend to fall out of the window, the owls attacked. Knowing that the owls couldn’t do anything to permanently hurt them, or prevent them from leaving, he turned with a smirk on his face – only to be frozen in place by a set of the devil’s own eyes.
Draco growled and pressed his lips to Tobias’ with a less-then-gentle bitting kiss. “I’ve changed my mind,” he purred, licking Tobias’ lips. “You are not a tease – you are one of the carnal sins, and I am going to claim you, but first,” he smirked, “I’m going to make you beg for it. I’m going to touch you and taste you. I’m going to get you to the very edge of bliss – and leave you there. Then I’m going to tease you. I’m going to make you think that I will sink my fingers into you – but I won’t. Then, when I enter you, I’m going to push just the head in and stop. When you tell me it’s okay to move – I will, but just barely. I will continue to do this until you are nothing but a puddle of goo beneath me and then,” he moaned softly and leaned down to whisper into the ear closest to him. “And then, ‘Bi, I will push into you, sheathing myself inside you in one,” he pushed his groin into his husband’s “hard,” he tensed slightly – preparing for movement, “Shove!” As he said the last word, he ground his groin downwards, dragging a moan from Tobias’ lips.
Minerva smiled from her place at the breakfast table as her youngest college strode confidently into the room. It had been many years since the young man had given off such a potent aura of self-confidence – far too long in her opinion.
Everyone looked at Tobias in shock.
“Good. Here they come.”
“Like Alpha and Beta’s parchments, your two have been combined. Your list is several items long. First, WWW. Make sure that everything is going well. If you need help with new ideas or to test products, don’t hesitate to ask us. Next is your family. If any of them slip up and mentions something of interest let us know immediately. The other two things on your list are Umbridge and Pomphrey. Think you can handle it?”
Ateria - Mischief
“When you have eaten all of you come by my office. I will need to check up on Miss Lovegood to see if she needs another blood replenisher a.” He looked at the awake and aware Pack members sternly, his eyes telling them to look after the blonde girl.
The entire Hall muttered softly, shame-faced at the thought that they had forgotten about the family they had left behind when they headed off to school.
“Harry! How can you –”
Luna nodded with a wolfish grin, “With pleasure!”
Tobias beamed at that and Severus groaned, knowing he’d just been manipulated into giving away his Lord’s best spy in the school to the imp. Tobias laughed and handed his professor a small vial of pearlescent liquid. “A present from Thanatos.” The boy walked into the classroom, followed by a disgruntled Severus.
“Not a problem,” Cornelius chuckled, “I remember when my wife was pregnant with our first. I couldn’t get enough of feeling her move.”
“You requested my presence, Lord?”
“How rude of you to assume otherwise,” George stated. “I do believe I am insulted.”
“And as a treat for you, the other laws against Centaurs were recently passed,” Lucius said enthusiastically, “as such, you will be the first to suff …” he coughed politely into his hand, ‘forgive me. You will be the first to … benefit … from them. Isn’t that just grand?”
Lucius smiled and nodded in affirmation. Tobias whooped in joy, ran to him, stole the papers in his hands and read through them. When he looked up his eyes sparkled with honest joy.
“If he doesn’t go for it, tell him that I will also be under his rule for all three months and so I’ll help him with any and all restoring work that needs to be done with Hogwarts and in my own time, not during detentions. This is now my school; My home, so I need to know what is going on within its walls.”
Blaise rolled his pack-name around his mouth, getting the taste of it. “Arpakitiko ... I think I like it. What does it mean?”
Neville thought for a moment before he started laughing hard enough for tears to fall down his cheeks. “Re-remind me to stay on your good side, Alpha. Th-this is going to hit her hard … not as hard as you punished her, but still hard.”
Severus blinked the question not what he was expecting. “Why do you w… Oh. Um … Draco. Do you think you may be falling for your betrothed?”
“Sir?” Harry slurred as Severus headed for the door.
“I got a note from the Unspeakables this morning,” one of Lucius’ associates stated. “It seems that a few of the students have been bound by something of a magical nature. The three I find troubling are two death oaths and one Master brand. There is an indication of why these have been placed, but they were accepted by magic and recorded so they must be honoured. If anything happens to either of them while we are there, we can do nothing.
“My dear, dear boy! I am surprised at you! I am the Sorting Hat of Gryffindor. None can hide anything from me!”
While they had been there, they had spoken about anything and everything. Tom had admitted to no longer knowing what he wanted for the wizarding world, while Tobias had discussed his plans for after the bonding. Tom had been ecstatic when he discovered that Tobias was going to hyphenate his name so he could keep the Riddle name. He and Draco had discussed it and Draco was fine with it – going as far as to suggest that he also hyphenate his name. Neither Tom not Tobias knew that Draco had spoken about it with his parents and that Lucius had given his blessing.
~Gran’thor Sal’s diaries from when he was old enough to write~
Both redheads watched the woman go in amusement before separating; One to the inventing area of the shop and the other to their above-shop apartment.
Before the man could sink further into his thoughts, a clean and dressed Tobias appeared next to him.
Draco quietly entered his godfather’s room, muttering under his breath. He had spent the morning in the library with the healthy members of his Pack, but the absence of two of their own had caused a wall of silence to envelope them while bringing them closer together as a group.
Those years nodded. Tobias addressed the seventh years. “You will be given different bribes and threats – mainly in regards to your N.E.W.Ts. DO NOT BE SWAYED BY HIM! Remember that Slytherins look out for their own. He will want you to spy on me, find out who my father is and whom I’m closest to in the house. Answer with a sneer and ask him if you look like you pay any attention to his golden boy. Make it seem as if you believe me being in this house is a plot of his to get someone brave enough – or stupid enough – to spy on the snake’s pit.”
“That’s what I was afraid of,” Bill sighed. He pulled his face from his hands and straightened in his seat. “What do I owe the pleasure of your visit to?”
When she turned towards the doors, her face transformed into one of pure disdain. She was now and would forever be, thankful for the feline-shaped pendant Tom, Lucius and Narcissa had gifted her for overseeing the bonding of their sons. It was the only thing she could credit with protecting her from that particular curse.
“No, he’s fine,” Severus stated quickly, moving Tobias until he was holding him bridal style.
Before the owner of the establishment could stammer out his thanks, all twenty people before him vanished in a lick of flame. By the time the Aurors turned back to the burning husk that was Voldemort, they were too late to see the spell/potion combination break and the visage of a snake-creature vanish to be replaced by the annoying features of a red-headed, blue-eyed idiot who was consumed by the flames.
When they finally had handed in their work, the three boys sat at the table and nibbled on the food the Malfoy house elf and bought Tobias.
Blaise felt his jaw drop. “How much of that stuff did you put into that potion, Alpha? For the type of reaction you got last night, I’d say that you had to have used a full plantation!”
After the glow had faded, Harry grinned as he got up. “Sir?” he asked Severus, “what’s for supper?”
“As I was saying, second most frequent craving is for sex. Often the carrier will become more dominant – at least to begin with. He will become demanding and insistent with his partner and if his demands aren’t met – or if he feels his demands aren’t met – he will take matters into his own hands. Once this craving starts, it is best for everyone to steer clear of them when they are in a room by themselves or when the carrier starts to exhibit the signs of this craving. These signs are touching his partner, rubbing himself against his partner, excessive flirting with his partner or – in the more extreme cases – pinning them to the nearest flat surface and snogging them while undressing.”
“I can’t do any more of this sheet,” she announced giving Theo a thankful smile as he released her hand, only to give Blaise’s hand the same treatment. “I need a textbook for it.”
“What was the matter?” Rowena asked.
Tom nodded in resinated thanks. He wasn’t afraid to admit that he needed help with his son. He had to admit that this was something that he was unprepared for.
Lucius watched his Lord from his position in the doorway in amusement.
“How DID you get this position?” Algernon asked. “The first thing any Healer learns is that twins are treated as one person medically – especially identical twins. It is widely known that twins are, on average, more powerful due to the way their souls and magic are entwined.”
Tobias’ eyes widened and he blushed a brighter red.
Neville mentally rubbed his hands together gleefully. “If someone was willing to swap rooms with either young lady, would it be possible?” he asked softly after a moment of thought.
“You should feel privileged,” she continued in an almost chatty voice. “You are the first being to be in the same room as these blades – well, other than myself, of course. They are my latest invention. Aren’t they just simply wonderful? They are truly wonderful pieces of art, if I do say so myself. The handles are the perfect shape to sit in your hand,” she kept her magic around her while revealing the design to her prey.
~ Of course, Raithia and please call me Alpha. Not even my followers call me Master. ~
“I have a life Booph,” Tobias answered. “I’ve been put onto light duties for a while and so cannot do some of the things that I used to do.”
Tom deflated when he heard that. He didn’t know what he would have done if he’d been responsible for his son to abort his child. He wouldn’t have been able to forgive himself. Anything that would keep his family safe was worth a few moments of distraction. He nodded and quietly went back to the report he was attempting to read and understand.
His eyes moved to the three-seater beside the fire-place and he felt his heart melt. Tobias had somehow managed to curl up on one cushion with his knees against his chest and his feet curled under him. His head was resting on the arm of the sofa and it was evident – at least to Draco – that his husband had fallen asleep while watching the flames in the fireplace. Without a word, Draco crossed to his sleeping Adonis and gently stretched him out so he was taking up the entire thing. As smoothly as he could, he slid himself beneath the dark-haired head and began running his fingers through the mop, silently staring into the flames.
~I understand it enough to relay information to anyone who speaks the snake language. I cannot speak it, however. ~
The Pack followed their Alpha in silence as he walked to what looked like an empty portrait. Once more, Tobias hissed. The answering hiss he got made many with him tense.
Everyone in the room exchanged confused looks until Neville entered the room with a blank-eyed Ron following him. Understanding formed in Tobias’ eyes when Neville ordered the shell to stop and it obeyed.
Silence filled the room. Harry smirked in a very Malfoy-like fashion at the stunned people before him. Remus was the first to speak.
Neither boy revealed any emotion to this. Poppy filed it away for further study at a later time. At the moment she had more important things to deal with.
“We know is.”
“Bi, calm down. Draco loves you more than anything. He doesn’t need to say anything, because you can see it in his eyes and how he treats you. I don’t doubt that you will have problems. All couples do – but you will get through them together. Nothing you will do could drive him away from you. And Bi? It doesn’t matter what anyone else things, because to Draco, you – are – perfect. Always remember that you are welcome here at any time. You are still going to be my son no matter what.”
“I have decided to adopt Mr Potter as my heir.  I believe we can both benefit from the arrangement, but thought the four of you should be consulted, as if it occurs, you will all be his godparents.”
Everyone gaped at the sight of fourteen wolf-turned humans bowing to a Tobias who was surrounded by black and silver flames while his wand was covered in green and white flames. No one moved as the flames combined and leapt from Tobias to Voldemort then spread to the Death Eater bodies that had been placed in a line in the middle of the street.
Harry grinned and harshly pulled Draco to him by his dick. “Of course,” he purred, “But you are going to be punished for yelling at me.”
“You forget, Xing Wu, that the people in this building who are in the most danger are CHILDREN,” she snapped the last word, making a few of the members sitting close to her wince slightly. “The children most endangered are SIXTEEN! My Susan’s age. Lord Patil’s twin daughters’ age. Lord Malfoy’s son’s age. Madam Greengrass’ grandchildren’s age and, if I miss my guess, the same age your niece was when she lost her betrothed and almost lost her life due to the boy’s own idiocy.”
Deloris passed out and Draco and Lucius exchanged smirks.
“Now, for what we are here for,” Booph stretched to his full height, causing all his tendons to snap satisfactorily. Narcissa giggled again when Lucius had to duck so he wasn’t hit with the Shadow Daemon’s tail. “We know that you had no plans for a honeymoon so The Mother has organised one. We will pick you up before the evening meal. Tonight, you will be introduced into the Mother’s garden.”
Tom got a look of puzzlement on his face. “I don’t know. I’m guessing they were put into my robe pocket that day I told everyone that you were pregnant. I just assumed you gave them to me.”
“I am the youngest potions master to ever receive the title, and not even I can make this potion with this degree of purity. The only person to ever have done that was Salazar Slytherin himself. You are truly his heir.”
“Let me get this straight,” Amelia said as she took in the silently fuming Tobias and the pale, shocked forms of the twins. “If Mr Weasley breaks the contract he and his brother lose their dreams and their futures while if Miss Patil breaks it the Patil family loses a valuable seat for the Grey/Neutral side of the Wizengamot to the Light and the equivalent of just under a trainee Auror’s pay for a month?”
“What is your chosen route?” Grapplefang asked.
A pop from outside alerted everyone to the fact that Aurors had arrived. With the added help, the Death Eaters that were scattered throughout the area were swiftly captured and delivered to the newest cells at the Ministry. As these cells literally glowed with charms for soothing rage, dampening magic and compulsions for telling the truth when a set phrase was uttered, there was no hope of them escaping.
‘This should do the trick,” he muttered as he pulled out a plain brown packet. He opened it to reveal a dull purple-grey powder. “I just add a little pulse of magic …” He pushed a small amount of his magic into the pinch he placed into his palm until a soft glow came from it.
“Come youngster. It is time for you to claim your mate as your own – unless you no longer wish to claim him.” The Father added slyly.
“So … What happened?” Ginny demanded.
This is a pubic announcement ... Killing the author of a story is NOT recommended if you want to see the stories end ... Thank you for your attention.
Severus remained silent through his entire examination – something that unnerved the Healer working on him to a great degree. When she was finished, she handed the results to Amelia and just about ran out of the area set aside for the patient’s privacy.
Dobby beamed and disappeared.
“Ginny? Luna?”
Gold of a shimmering noon,
He then turned to the scowling female that stood beside her. “In answer to your accusation,” he began with a nasty smile, “Yes, our females DO give birth. Male pregnancies have not yet become a part of goblin biology.”
“What is in it for Gringotts?”
“A few of them are still bleeding, for both me and Lucius,” Narcissa said with a wince, “Dobby was, after all, our house elf before he was freed by Harry after seeing how he was being treated.”
Draco carried Tobias to their room and placed him lovingly on their bed. Smiling softly, he placed a soft kiss to both of his husband’s flickering eyelids, his nose and finally his lips.
You're my safest place to hide
Luna has more fun :3
Draco chuckled and waved to the desk behind them. Lucius turned and gaped at the display.
With very little fan fair, The Pack stood and left the Chamber, debating over who would be first to be examined and seeing who would be closets to guessing what Dobby would bring to Tobias for the evening meal. . Tobias’ favourite was a tomato based fish soup with chunks of pan-seared bread. If he didn’t get that tonight, maybe he could request if to lunch the following day.
“What is it?” Blaise asked, looking at the odd box contraption on the table. It had a strap attached to the base, on which another, smaller box sat. The smaller box had a handle on one side. It looked old and flimsy.
Understanding lit in their eyes and Luna stood carefully. Silently she handed him a case that fit nicely into his hand.
Tobias opened his eyes and smiled at the blonde above him.
“It is also possible to exchange one member of the Patil family for another regardless of which branch they originate,” Grapplehank added. “Unfortunately for Mr Weasley, it is non-negotiable for him; neither can both changes be done to the contract. It is one or the other.”
“Yes, Founder’s Heir. It is wonderful to be able to speak to you, finally,” a feminine voice silenced the students. “Please forgive me for not introducing myself sooner, but I was under orders not to until you had come into your inheritance. I am Hogwarts, young Sir. Welcome home.”
And there's nowhere left to run
My Fair Lady.”
Now, not only did he have the over-protective man who called himself the brat’s father to deal with as well as the Malfoy family, he was also facing an investigation into the safety of the school’s students with him in the Headmaster’s position.
to separate them completely.”
“Technically I have finished it. You were the one who ordered another serve without asking me if I could eat more,” Tobias stated stubbornly.
“Master Sir called Dobby?”
Harry glared at her before turning that same gaze on Dumbledore. “So much for the protection of the Order, Sir,” he drawled, sounding more like Draco than he had before. “Death Eaters attacked the Dursleys two weeks ago. I was rescued,” he spat the word as if it were poison, “by someone I didn’t like, nor trust. It took both him and Severus here to get me out without dying.” His eyes took on the look of hard emeralds as everyone voiced their accusations at Severus.
Everyone blinked as the honest blonde skipped away, just in time to avoid a flame covered Tobias with fury pouring from his very being. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE’S COMING INTO THE SCHOOL!” he roared, making everyone flinch.
“How dare you! I’m the Minister’s Undersecretary. You will regret this!”
Draco’s jaw dropped slightly at this. “That sounds wonderful, Bi.”
“Looking for a dark-haired person we both know and love?” a soft voice called, making Draco relax.
The Lady nodded and left to talk to the Minister, leaving the students in complete silence.
Once everyone had gotten to their proper positions, Tom stood. “There are several reasons for this meeting being called,” He began. “I will be dealing with one reason now and the others later in the meeting, but first, I will say that the next person to show disrespect towards my son will face a fate worse than death – and it won’t be from my hand either.” He smirked, “if you can’t tell, my son’s Pack are very protective of him.”
“He’s having nightmares again, isn’t he?”
“It’s not very fun to torture someone who has already been broken. When he wakes, he will remember all, but find no proof of it happening. He will put it down as a nightmare and I will be free to torture him again and again and again.”
Dinner that night was a quiet one for those who sat at the Slytherin Table. Every move that Tobias made was carefully monitored as the abnormally scatter-brained teen slowly ate a seemingly normal - though foreign – soup full of noodles, dark green vegetables and thinly shaved slices of mixed meats.
Sal smiled sadly. “Without the potion, between 4-7 days. With the potion between 2-4 weeks.”
“What if they try something with Kyria when they see the results she gets with what happened a few days ago?” Vincent asked. “I have only just found something to give as her first gift.”
“No. It serves them right. Lucius most of all since he is the only married man of the group: You should have seen some of the things Narcissa put him through when she was pregnant with Draco.”
The new goblin nodded his acceptance and approached the two men. “Now, what seems to be the problem?”
Tobias nodded. “Has anyone anything interesting to report?”
It was their time to answer The Mother’s Call.
In one movement, Tobias’ hands flashed with green flame and he rolled towards the man’s other leg, making the disgraced man fall heavily on the ground with a deep crack of something breaking.
“I’m not a cat person,” Severus sniffed. “I don’t do animals. I only like wolves because I will be in horrible trouble with Tobias and Draco if I said that I didn’t.”
Tobias stopped as well and looked back at his husband. “Yes. Unless …” he felt his bottom lip wobble slightly and his eyes begin to fill with tears. “Unless you only want one child,” he whispered.
“Minerva … are you sure?”
“Bring the man waiting at the gates here Blintzy,” Lucius stated.
“Is it just me,” Vincent said with a frown, “Or has it gone very quiet?”
The Pack watched with laughter shaking their forms as their Alpha and the Dark Lord squealed happily and hugged the Potions Master at the same time.
Tobias sat on the floor, legs crossed. “Yes Pateras?”
“And why is that?”
Remus thought for a moment and nodded. “I think that would be enjoyable. I will ask everyone – Is there any particular room you wish for us to congregate?
Before him, sliding slowly down the pole, was a young man the same age as Harry, but where Harry was black haired, tanned and with a physique that was suited more for a beater than the seeker he had been in school, this new man was platinum blonde, porcelain-skinned and slender enough to still be mistaken for the seventeen year old seeker he had been in school.
The rest of the day passed peacefully for The Pack member who were still in school. The incident of that morning was still fresh in everyone’s minds so nearly no-one was game enough to talk to any of them. Of the few souls brave enough to talk to them, only three enquired after their Alpha’s health and only two asked after Luna. Each of them got a smile from the person they had asked and the latest update that they had heard.
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco soothed. “At least the only person who can interrupt us is the Dragon-Lady.”
“Pateras!”
“Open it Sev,” Tobias said softly. “You will torture yourself more doing this then if you just opened it.”
“No. This is your own fault, Pateras, and you need to deal with the consequences. I sent you exact directions for that potion – ONE teaspoon before bed every day until it was finished. Now I need to brew more for you,” his voice dropped to a dangerous purr that made Draco shiver with delight, “and I do hope that you will follow my directions this time.”
“Students,” he announced when he got to the centre of the dais. “The two men beside me are Mr Andrew Stephens and Mr Klause Stoker. They are the men who hold the top positions in the Education department and the careers expert in our Ministry. The way this will work is I will call out two names. The first will go to Mr Stephens and the second will come to me.”
“If it’s all the same, Draco, I wish to keep my possessions the way they are,” Severus murmured as he offered Harry a glass of sparkling water with line, which the boy took, gratefully, as he sat.
For the first time in memory, the Great Hall was silent as the students ate their evening meal. All of them were waiting with bated breath as they watched the doors leading into the Dining Hall. Everyone caught hold of their breath as the door slowly creaked open to reveal their Potions Professor in all his dark robed splendour.
“Just us or Minerva as well?” Severus asked as he reached out to steady him.
“Alright my beautiful husband and child. I’ll get you something yummy to fill up that empty space.”
Millicent looked at the scroll and back at the man with a raised eyebrow.
“On our way.”
“Tobias normally naps mid-morning and mid-afternoon,” Minerva stated softly. “I think today is the first time in a while that he didn’t and it’s caught up with him.”
“Build it up with bricks and mortar,
The beaming smile Draco gave him was all the answer he needed.
For several minutes, the only sound in the office was that of chewing and swallowing as the three of them enjoyed their food.
Tom sat across from his son. “We’ve received warning that Dumbledore is planning something. We don’t know what it is, but it concerns you and Draco in some way. All that we could discern from Thanatos was that it would hurt both of you.”
“Are you hungry, gios?”
Just as Narcissa turned away, no longer able to stand the sight of the strongest man she knows standing only because of the arms of her husband and his best friend wrapped around his waist, a brilliant blue-white light flashed and a dull THWUMP was heard.
“That wasn’t him being mean Alpha,” Ginny stated. “That was him taking care of his mate and cub. Remember, you have to eat enough nutrients for both you and the pup.”
As it was, the families of the boys in question could refuse the girls contracts on the bases of not knowing if their son was the girl’s first experience, not believing the child is their son’s or due to the girl’s lack of modesty, integrity and intellect. It all depended on what the boys said and how they reacted to the news.
With no effort at all, he rose from his position and walked to the door. Before the door managed to close fully, he whipped out his wand and one word left his lips with no one but his victim witnessing his actions. “Imperio.”
“Yes, Lord.”
Tom raised an eyebrow at the cat animagus, ignoring what was going on behind him. “Would I have sent you that letter if I were hiding him?”
“Sleep?”
Severus sent a level look at the teen, who grinned as he hand the letters to Luna, who skipped out of the room happily.
