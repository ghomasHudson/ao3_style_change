Harry thought of all the photographs of his friends, of that magazine with La Jolla Cove on the cover, and wondered how Malfoy could walk away from it all. But really, he knew: he’d walked away from it ten years ago when the Ministry exiled him and his parents from Britain. Harry wasn’t sure he would want to come back either.
He stood there motionless for a long time after the slam of the front door stopped echoing, wondering just what was so wrong with him that it would drive someone to that sort of exit. When Hermione cautiously poked her head out fifteen minutes later, he was still there, and would’ve remained that way for hours more if she hadn’t curled her arm around his waist and manhandled him into the kitchen for a cup of tea.
The man turned to Harry, beaming, and said, “That’s my son! He’s in first place.” Then his eyes trailed up to the scar on Harry’s forehead and he took a step back. “
Thick, clear liquid started dripping from the man’s fingers and Harry grabbed his hand to squeeze all of it off. Then he tugged him up and around, turning his body until his cock was hovering above Harry’s face. Merlin, it was a lovely cock, and with such lovely bollocks, too—so pink and soft with fair hairs sparsely covering them. Harry reached up with his dry hand to guide the head into his mouth, delighting in the way the wizard’s thighs tensed. Harry sucked and the man threw his head back moaning, his hips moving subtly, as if he wasn’t even aware of them. Harry reached up with his other hand and slid a slick finger into the man’s arsehole, and this, finally, reminded his guest of what he was supposed to be doing—he bent his head immediately, taking Harry’s cock back into his mouth and sucking it properly.
Bill shrugged. “With great reputation comes great pain in the arse from one’s government.” He handed Harry the folder. Harry took it, under duress. “It’s at Malfoy Manor,” Bill added then, which made Harry still, nearly upsetting his coffee as his hands jerked to a stop.
The wizard moaned, apparently realising Harry’s intentions. He started fucking Harry’s mouth and fingers properly and Harry let him, enjoying the feel of being on the edge. When the first spurt of come landed in his mouth, Harry could hold on no longer. He arched up, emptying himself in the man’s mouth and swallowing down everything put into his.
Harry moaned, arching up into him, feeling delicious tingles rush over his skin as their bodies touched. “Oh god, you smell so good...like life, or adventure. Like a little bit of England, but with a whole lot of beach. It’s amazing. And your accent—it’s just the same. Where are you from?”
“Want to kiss you,” Harry murmured against his neck. “I don’t know why. I don’t even know what you look like.”
Harry’s heart leapt in his throat. Suddenly, all this rashness seemed like a very stupid idea. He masked it as best he could, grinned at Lucius, and slowly turned around. Malfoy stood there, looking annoyed with all of them but perfectly delicious anyway. His pale hair was plastered to his head and his wetsuit was scandalously tight. Harry could get used to seeing this sort of thing on the regular.
“Ta,” Bill said, finally looking up. He smiled at Harry, his left cheek pulling a little bit where the scars from Greyback’s attack still crossed his skin. Sometimes Harry wished his scar was as cool and rakish as Bill’s. Bill’s scars were sexy. Harry’s was just embarrassing.
“It’s only Potter, dear,” she said, standing. She held her hand out for Harry and he kissed it awkwardly. Then he wondered if he should’ve shaken it instead. They weren’t in Wiltshire, after all.
“Ron gave your case to me. I was de-cursing the Manor while you were there, and when I got to your bedroom, your magic was everywhere.”
“Maybe.” He licked a meandering trail down Harry’s chest to his hips and the fuzzy patch of hair beneath his belly button. “Maybe you can find out for yourself one day.”
“Your spell,” Harry gasped, holding his fingers out. “Do it on mine.” The wizard looked up at him from his mouthful of cock, and Harry groaned as his lips stretched into a smile around the head. He sucked hard and then popped off.
,” Hermione said, and he heard her stop moving at the countertop. He smelled the intention of a chopping spell to finish what she’d started but she reconsidered before she cast it, and the scent faded. Instead, she moved to the pantry and returned a moment later, handing him a vial of Hangover Potion. It wasn’t meant to soothe the ache of his
“It wasn’t his face,” Harry said. “I never even saw it. It was his magic. I liked the way it smelled.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “Fuck,” he said. Because he couldn’t think of anything else. At this, Narcissa looked up enough that he could see her face beneath the brim of her hat, and she smiled at him as if he were just round for tea and everything was normal instead of them all being on a beach in California and only two of them wearing clothes.
The wizard laughed and then bent to nip at Harry’s skin and nipples with his teeth. “I live in California, in La Jolla.”
Harry managed to work two full fingers into his wizard’s tight arse before the other man figured out how to arrange his hands so he could do the same to Harry, which only made Harry moan hard around his cock and thrust up into his waiting mouth. God, he was not going to last very long. There was something about sucking another man off that brought him right to the edge—one day he reckoned he might try to get himself off by doing just that—and the feel of a hot, tight arse around his fingers was the best. He worked in a third finger, just to see if he could, and his wizard took it like a champ, moaning even more around Harry’s cock. The vibrations, the finger in his arse, and the expert sucking all came together in a slow burn of uncontainable pleasure, and Harry felt his balls tightening as his orgasm built up. He moaned around the cock in his mouth and rocked his hips upwards. Harry finger-fucked the man’s arse relentlessly. He took as much cock in as he could, desperate to make him come and when he saw his balls drawing up and felt him trying to pull out of Harry’s mouth, Harry wrapped his free arm around his hips and pulled him down again. There was no way he wasn’t swallowing every bit of come from the man whose magic smelled this good.
Malfoy found his wave. Harry was instantly aroused. He wondered if Bill would be open to considering a branch of
Bill rolled his eyes, moved over to the kettle by the sink in their converted office, and set about making himself a cup of tea. “How the hell should I know? Ron’s in an uproar about it all. He’s the one who sent the file over,” he said. “Read the paper. It’s probably in there.”
This made Malfoy blush, which looked rather fetching with his tanned skin. “Were, ah, my school things still there—?”
Lucius followed her gaze. He scowled and his eyes snapped back up to Harry’s. “Then, one wonders, what business could
In response, he wrapped his hand around Harry’s skull and pulled him in, pressing their mouths together. Harry melted into the kiss. “Can they see through your privacy spell?” Harry asked.
The east wing of the manor radiated the stench of Voldemort, so Harry decided to save it for last. He went through the west wing on autopilot, cleaning out curses here and there. It appeared that this was the wing the Malfoys had once used for living in, so it was relatively clean. Compared to the east wing, anyway. And then he opened the last door in the corridor to an onslaught of coconut and salt air and hot sand and
“Bollocks,” Harry decided. Ministry cases were always the worst. They paid very little and always threatened tax audits if
He took the opportunity to check out all of the Malfoys’ things. There wasn’t anything cursed in this house that he immediately saw, but he was sure something somewhere would at least take off a finger. The scent of Malfoy’s magic was soft but everywhere. He wondered if this was what Malfoy Manor smelled like before Voldemort lived in it.
“I smelled your magic; it woke me up,” Harry said, stepping into the shower behind him. “I hope you weren’t planning on skipping out.” He placed his hands on the firm globes of his wizard’s arse and squeezed. Merlin, he could get used to this. It didn’t even matter what the other man really looked like. “What’s your name?” he asked.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “He was in a Glamour, too.” He added, even though he didn’t have to, “I could smell it.”
Harry squeezed his bum again, and then lathered up his hands and ran his fingers up the knobs of his spine, watching his muscles tense in the wake of Harry’s fingers. “I want to see you again,” Harry said, as though soothing a skittish pegasus. “I promise I’m not a troll, or at least I’ve been told I’m not. And I’m pretty fit. I only Glamour my face so I won’t be recognised.”
But the house—the house was like something out of a nightmare. Harry smelled fear. It overwhelmed everything else, like a wet, putrescent rot. Insidious magic crawled over the exterior, decaying the limestone, the wood of the doors, even the glass of the windows.
He got closer to the shore, coming to stand next to a tall, tanned man with a long blond plait. He scanned the water, looking for Malfoy’s tell-tale hair but they were too far out to see clearly—especially with Harry’s eyesight. Another big wave rolled in and two of the bobbing surfers took it, pulling themselves up and riding in. It grew bigger as they approached the shore and one of the surfers swerved sideways, sliding inside the pipe it created when the wave crested and broke.
Harry tapped his wand to the doorbell and waited. After a long moment, it opened to reveal a rather tanned house-elf wearing a cream linen toga.
“So you’re going back,” Ron surmised. Harry suspected that his refusal to answer was answer enough. “Could be a serial killer,” Ron said pointedly. The Auror in him always came out when Harry was considering something questionable. “You don’t know this bloke’s motives.”
“Yes, but I wasn’t trying to trick other blokes into showing me their bits when I was fifteen. Something you’d like to tell me, Malfoy?”
The house-elf narrowed her eyes, visibly annoyed. “Master Draco’s surfing competition. Sandy has not gotten your name, sir?”
Harry tried to imagine how long he’d need to train to have that kind of core strength, and was afraid of the answer. The surfer came out the other side of the wave, still standing, his legs swinging up almost parallel with the earth as the board travelled up the wave and still he managed to stay standing.
Even the staircase was cursed. Although—Harry sniffed, then gagged. Not cursed by the Malfoys then. This staircase, like several other spots in the manor reeked with
didn’t move them to the front of the queue. “This is why I didn’t become an Auror,” Harry reminded Bill, not for the first time. “Why can’t they take their shit to Gringotts’ curse-breaking team?”
Ron’s eyes widened. He shot a spell at the door and it slammed; Ron’s home-made biscuits-smelling privacy spells followed. Harry winced. Ron’s spells were so sweet that they gave Harry a headache when a lot were used in quick succession. “You slept with
Bill hmmed, not looking up from his perusal of another new case—this one from the private sector and therefore much less of a hassle to deal with, even if the Malfoy one had come from Ron.
There were no evil wards around this manor—well, perhaps not a manor, as it seemed to be in line with the other houses on this magical street, but it was nearly as large as Malfoy Manor anyway. Much more inviting, Harry noted, with pristine white stucco and a Spanish tile roof. There were two coconut palms on either side of the drive. Exiled or not, the Malfoys certainly weren’t wanting for much. Harry had to give the evil fuck credit: Lucius Malfoy had been prescient enough to move most of his money into Swiss and Caribbean bank accounts—both wizarding and Muggle—before the end of the war. Harry remembered Ron ranting about that for months after the Ministry realised it had exiled the lot of them into a ten-year holiday.
He laughed, beautifully in Harry’s opinion. “You like my magic, wasn’t it?” To demonstrate, he snapped his fingers and all of Harry’s clothes vanished from him and reappeared folded—neatly—on the chair by his window. The room was suddenly heavy with the scent of ripe coconut. Another snap of his fingers, and the wizard’s own clothing followed suit, with the scent of high tide following.
His wizard jerked to a stop halfway through the drawing room. Harry turned to see what had caught his attention, and wrinkled his nose when he saw him staring at the Black Family tapestry. “Ghastly, I know. I keep telling myself I’ll take it down, but I never do,” Harry said, tugging unsuccessfully on the man’s wrist. “This was my godfather’s house when he was still alive.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. He noticed then that the man was still holding tight to his arms. Harry stepped closer, pretending it was due to the surge of the crowd. He let his hand settle on the man’s hipbone, and watched as his eyes fell low and his mouth parted as he inhaled. “I come here all the time, but I’ve never seen you before last weekend.”
Harry straightened, crossing his arms over his chest. “Well I didn’t know it was him at the time, did I? I only just found out now. I de-cursed his bedroom.”
His wizard shook his head quickly, that same strangled sound echoing from his throat. “No, no no no. I have to go.”
Fortunately, as the threshold was cursed to give any half-bloods who touched it green skin, he did not.
disintegrated with the sharp smell of lightning. Harry jumped, and looked away from the sight with some disappointment. Lucius was glaring at him.
Harry scrunched his nose. He hadn’t read a newspaper in six years, and he didn’t plan to start anytime soon. He swilled the rest of his coffee—now cold—and stood from the table that was shoved into the emptiest corner of their office. He had to navigate around a stack of cursed books as high as his waist and a collection of scabbards that snipped off any appendage inserted within (there was a wizard in Dorset who would never be able to forget this grave mistake). He stepped lightly around the music boxes that started playing funeral dirges whenever someone near was thinking salacious thoughts (these often went off when he and Bill were light on cases; Harry suspected a third Delacour-Weasley to be announced any day).
Harry thought, as he watched Malfoy’s wetsuit-clad bum making its way back into the water. He dove in and Harry had to readjust himself in his chinos as Malfoy began swimming out.
The wizard smiled slowly. “I’ve never come before then.” He flicked his hand. The silence of a privacy spell came first, but the rush of orange zest followed right after and Harry’s eyes sank closed in response. Merlin, he could sit in this man’s magic all day. He stepped closer, pressing their bodies together as Muggles continued dancing all around them, oblivious. “How did you know I had magic?”
“Hi,” said Harry, flushing. Malfoy gave him a half-amused, half-exasperated look, and Harry wondered if he was going to bolt again. He hurried to add, “I thought maybe you wouldn’t run off this time if I knew who you were, too. And you did say I should see where you live for myself sometime.”
“How may Sandy help you?” she asked—she had an American accent and now, finally, Harry recognised the widened vowels and sanded-down consonants he’d heard in Malfoy’s unusual accent.
His wizard resumed washing his feet, with more attention to detail than Harry’d ever bestowed on any single body part during a bath. “I’m not worried about you being ugly,” the wizard said, and Harry could hear the laugh in his voice. “Why would anyone recognise you in a Muggle gay bar? Are you famous? Have I just had sex with one of the Weird Sisters?”
She sighed. “Then you will have to take the long way. It is fifteen minutes by Muggle car then another ten getting down the cliffs, if you don’t fall.”
Harry nodded. The wizard reached over and snapped his fingers above Harry’s outstretched palm. Harry closed his eyes for a moment; if he wasn’t careful, he would get drunk off this wizard’s magic, and then where would he be?
Harry slammed it back, and then buried his face in his hands. Smell was always the most overpowering right after taking a potion, and he tried not to breathe overmuch while it went into effect.
Harry shook his head. He was just as baffled by this as they were. “I...don’t know. I was attracted to him,” he admitted, scrunching his nose. It always felt weird talking about people he would like to mess about with to Ron and Hermione.
There was a burst of lemon-sugar from the bathroom across the hall that Harry suspected to be an exfoliating spell. He smirked into the pillow. Maybe his wizard was really attractive after all if he was into such poncy spells. He levered himself up and out of the bed, padding into the bathroom. His wizard was humming—a song Harry’d never heard before but catchy nonetheless. He pulled the shower curtain back.
Ron’s eyebrows went way up. “At the Muggle club?” Harry nodded. Ron put his wand away. “Why didn’t you leave?”
Hermione stopped chopping again. “Harry,” she said, spinning around. “It’s dangerous to mess around with someone under a Glamour. They could be a
His wizard laughed. It was such a gorgeous sound, almost as nice as the smell of his magic. “I thought we were heading for another round right now…”
This time, Draco’s eyes widened. He looked from one parent to the other but Lucius, too, was otherwise occupied by this point. He’d taken the lounge chair next to Narcissa’s and was digging through a magically-expanded bag for something.
“Why did you Glamour over this?” Harry asked. He trailed his finger over the smooth skin, marvelling at the goose pimples that rose in its wake.
Harry felt his neck prickling and turned to look over his shoulder. Both Malfoys were watching avidly. Harry narrowed his eyes and erected a
Sorry that I’m rambling for so long, this – just muttering everything that’s on my mind out loud – is somehow even more tempting than to write you an epos with every reply. And frankly, I needed to release some pressure too. I’ve been so tired the last few days because I had to do loads of homework, run some errands – for my regulations mostly. Can’t get into detail, but you know how anxious it gets me.
You asked me whether you think that the Mind Healers would still think that what we have together is normal? I think that they would. What we found together cannot be called conventional but what part of our lives has been? I was brought up by relations that despised me and then I was thrust into a whole new world when I was eleven, one that still seems fantastical when I stop to think about it. You were brought up in a hot house of political philosophies that you couldn’t escape from. Even if you’d been offered an alternative perspective, you couldn’t have accessed others who shared it without losing your family and everything you held dear. We both fought in a war that other people wanted and were misused by the very people who should have loved us.
Merlin, I can’t quite fathom that I might have plans for after Hogwarts. Ones which include a bath, and now I can’t stop imagining being in such proximity, naked, with someone I like. With you. Sorry, I digress. Let’s definitely flirt, but I have some more things to say first.
I know that you Mother was unwise – and her conduct entirely terrifying – but I truly believe that her actions can be excused. What she did was conniving, but it wasn't selfish, not really. Narcissa’s whole worldview – from birth, throughout her marriage and even now, when everything she ever known burnt to ash – is to do everything in their power for you to get on in life, and to attach you to a person of influence, which, for all intents and purposes would be myself. That’s the reason that she waited until the very last moment to tell me about the vault, stalling to a point of no return.
So. The most basic part is to register the planned business to the Ministry. The safe way to go about this is to register before even one Sickle is made from selling anything. I won’t need much for that, and it might cost a small fee, Slughorn wasn’t entirely sure about that. But he made it sound like it’s no big deal at all. Only some paperwork. It would only get a bit fiddly if I were to hire employees, but that won’t be the case.
When you read this, you will have found a silver tray with fruit and a steaming hot tea (one which is yet to pour). Kreacher just brought them with a flourish – at least for his grumpy old bones – and the remark, “Refreshments for the young masters.”
We had a brilliant duel there. And yet I saw it in your eyes, and perhaps you saw it in my own – memories of the visit prior to this exciting one. But let’s try it. We can always step back and leave the blasted room, should it feel wrong. But quite frankly, I want you. We have only spent one single night together so far while it feels like we should have had thousands of opportunities by now.
With a flick of my wand, I banished both our clothes. And I’m sure I preened at your astonished gasp when you looked down at yourself, finding both our pricks at full attention. You pulled me close. While I kneaded my fingers up your nape and through your unruly hair, I felt your broad hands all over my back, my shoulders, my arse; your soft kisses on my chest and your hot tongue left wet trails across my skin. And Circe, it felt glorious. Have you ever heard about blokes complaining that their girls only want foreplay? They have no idea what they’re missing out on.
Draco was the first to suggest that they meet after the holidays ended, a reveal that filled them both with nervousness.
“You look so sexy,” you said, taking hold of the back of my knee and pushing my leg back, lining yourself up and getting in position. “You don’t know what you do to me, Harry. I’m besotted. I’m in love with you.”
I better go. Sorry if this letter has been the equivalent of me spilling a phial of noxious Flobberworm serum down your robes. It’s just been one of those bad days. One of those horrible, scratchy days. I’m glad that I’ve got you to talk things over with though. I hope you don't mind.
Your recollection of Christmas days with your Muggles (does this sound like a slur? It’s unintentional, love) reminds me a bit of these Yule Balls I mentioned. They simply existed to impress, really.
Don’t laugh, but I’m a little afraid I’ll feel this intoxicated by you forever and then I’ll simply never get anything done, ever again. There’ll be nothing else for it, my dear: we’ll have to graduate from Hogwarts and then spend the whole of the next century in our bed. What do you think? We can get up to shower occasionally, and have an owl to deliver us food, but otherwise I’m not sure there’s anything else I want to dedicate my life to.
So. You broke the kiss, thinking about Shakespeare. That’s a totally normal reaction for an eighteen/nineteen-year-old bloke being approached by a girl. Your self-control is equally impressive and beyond hope, mon ami. I’m just taking the piss, obviously. I’m really glad that you’re true to your words. When you wrote that you’re looking for true romance you sounded very sincere about it. I’d be slightly underwhelmed and disappointed, had you decided to kiss her back, let alone get back together with her.
“Don’t ever scare me like that, ever again,” you demanded, knotting your hands into my jumper and pulling me close. “Every minute felt like a sodding hour… The house was so silent, and I couldn’t stop thinking… Fuck, Harry, but I love you so much. I’m a stupid, besotted sap, catastrophising my life away.”
My homework is done, and you’ll be very delighted to know that I’ve been talking to Theo already. The poor lad was overjoyed, no doubt, but also a bit shy when the pair of us approached him after dinner, wasn’t he?
We need to remember what McGonagall said: hold true to what you know in your hearts. I know that I love you, and I know that you haven’t done anything to deserve what that Auror said today.
Yes, I am Harry James Potter. You’ve caught me, bang to rights! Shall we do all my names while we’re on the subject and get them out the way? Hero. Saviour. Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived. What about my being the third part of the Golden Trio? The last is a new one that the
And amidst all the buzz of summer, we planned our bonding. I still don’t like to admit that Mother was right: we did spend way more money than we originally intended. What I will admit is that it’s entirely your fault for spoiling me so much.
Were they trying to use it for a banishing ritual, or was it for the creation of an undouseable flame? It boggles the mind thinking about taking a risk like that when it isn’t necessary to do so. That’s the thing about magic, isn’t it, the whole dark/light dichotomy that you joked about with Ron.
And Ron and Hermione – I’m feeling a bit sorry for that poor chap. I’ll remind you to be a good friend to him. I don’t mind having Weasley join us for dinner and listen to Quidditch matches on the Wireless together as long as he doesn’t wear that offensively orange Cannons shirt.
The two of us sometimes make fun of your hair or your clothes being messy and askew, and not too rarely do I start fondling with strands of your hair, your collar or your obnoxious Gryffindor-coloured tie. The truth is that it suits you so well, my love. Remember that pretty early on in our relationship – when we were still a bit in-between; shocked that it’s us, but starting to get used to the idea on some level – I told you that I liked your hair? I think it surprised you, didn’t it? So, the truth is that messy clothes and unruly hair are somewhat the essence of your charm (next to a myriad of other things). It suits you and I love it. I love the way your hair grows out in places, but it waves and stands and curls, and only when I play with a strand, softly pulling it between my fingers, do I see how long it is.
I can’t think of another way that I'd rather spend my time. You’ll be able to tell me about some more of the places you’ve visited, regale me with a couple more of your poems and I can listen. If you called me your friend or, even better, gave me an oh-so-macho slap on the back then that would simply be the pumpkin icing on the treacle tart. I won’t be drinking Firewhisky, but perhaps I’ll treat myself to a pile of Honeydukes that’s nearly as big as my head. I did warn you, didn't I, that I had a sweet tooth?
I hope that waking you up before dawn to continue our marathon wasn’t too much after the long and exhausting day you had. But when I woke and it was still dark, you lay in front of me, my arms tightly wrapped around you. It was so warm and comfortable that I had almost drifted off to sleep again, but my hardening prick didn’t want me to. I ghosted my hands up your slender sides, your warm skin, and grinded my hips against you until you woke up, grabbing behind you to stroke me while my arm looped around you to return the favour.
I’m just teasing you, my lovely. But the fact is that now, while there are about 300 kilometres of distance between us, I can still feel a reminder of last night whenever I move. And before you fret whenever you read this – not in an unpleasant way. And I’m fairly certain that you know what I’m talking about anyway.
“Draco,” Theo said, his voice a bit lower even though there was hardly anyone else around. “What the
Forgive me. I’m running my mouth off. Talking about things that I don’t know the first thing about. You must think me an ignorant prat who doesn’t know a thing and I suspect that you might be right.
Even before we Side-Alonged to Godric’s Hollow, you seemed nervous, chewing your bottom lip and kneading my fingers. “I think I forgot my dad’s birthday,” you said, chastised. “I know it’s in March, but I didn’t think about it when the 27th arrived.”
“Thank Salazar,” Narcissa replied, dropping my hand. “Then I’ll tell you about France, though perhaps you might be dismayed by what you hear. Please bear in mind that I believed I had no choice in my actions, and Draco knew nothing of them.” At that, Narcissa slipped an understated gold ring from her index finger and placed it on the scratched wood of the table between us.
For a moment, it actually felt like I’d become incorporeal. My powerful magic didn’t frighten me a whit then. Instead, it felt glorious, like the gift that it is. In that moment, everyone within the standing stones seemed to become one being.
I’m completely over the moon, imagining that you spent time with an actual dictionary in the library and that you even wrote a poem for me. In French! Circe, you’re such a romantic dope, I will never in my life forget the words you versified for me. It’s beautiful. And there’s nothing I could wish for more than to fly with you, share a broom under the clear night sky.
Any residual annoyance from my Slytherin-esque trick seemed to melt away as I refreshed our warming spells and wrapped my arms around your shoulders, and found your lips for a long, soft kiss. Merlin, but you tasted so good. I could taste the salt of your sweat on your mouth and feel the race of your pulse. Dawn was breaking around the two of us, and the shape of your heavy, full prick was hard under the thin material of your tracky bottoms.
articles with my own two eyes. I saw the disgraceful, scandalous display that you pulled when you received your Order of Merlin. I saw the pair of you, kissing and embracing for all the world to see.” Your Mother pursed her lips with distaste. “And I knew, there and then, that what the pair of you were involved in was more than a mere infatuation.” She knotted her fingers together and stared hard in my direction. “It was obvious, simply from the way that my son looked at you in those photographs, that he loves you deeply. A mother always knows these things. I’d already known the strength of Draco’s partiality back at Christmas, when he’d waxed so lyrically about his committed relationship with his unknown correspondent. Merlin. My heart broke, for I knew that no good would come of your pairing, not in the end, and I do fear that I’ve been proved right. The newspapers are already rather brimming with vitriol, aren’t they?”
“Youse have a letter young sirs" Dobby answered pulling a letter from out of the depths of his dirty pillow case. Draco sighed slowly expecting it to be from Pansy, she was in Europe at the moment had been sending him almost daily owls about all of the things she was doing and wearing. It was an obvious attempt to draw out jealousy but he had assurances from his father that they would be going to Japan later in the year.
“You will make up for it in history of magic, Pans, and Transfiguration. You already made that stick look sort of metallic and that was just wandless.” He told her and Pansy gave a huge grin her sour look vanishing.
“For your information, Granger my parents are due to arrive any minute. I was told to give you this Potter. It is an invitation to the Malfoy ball. As you are a Black you have a right to be there” Draco huffed taking out a cream coloured envelope from the depths of his robes. Harry accepted it slowly his fingers brushing against Draco’s as he did so. “The invitation includes your friends” Draco told him this with a scowl motioning to Ron and Hermione who both stayed silent with shock. “Well then, I bid you a very merry yule, Potter”
“And you, Sir Nicholas” Harry and Draco replied as they were ushered away from the ghost by the twins who pointed out various pictures and statues as they passed. There was no way that Harry would be able to remember anything he was being told but he was very glad that he had come to Hogwarts.
“I would say the same, but you look a fright...Potter” Draco said very deliberately looking him up and down. Harry didn’t mind, not when he saw the way Draco’s pupils dilated or how his pale cheeks coloured from looking him up and down. He wasn’t dressed to impress, he had been helping Luna and Rolf after all and fancy clothes didn’t stay fancy when mucking out Hippogruff shite.
!” The third head shouted to the older one who somehow managed to look surprised, however she still managed to make a joke hissing
“Thisen is a sad subjects Master Lupins! Wese be talken abouts somethings nicer!” Jinx squeaked rubbing her eyes on her pillowcase and Harry moved to hug her tightly. She let out a gasp and hugged him in return lightly patting him on the back. “Youse is a good boys master Harry!”
“I was just…I still get surprised, I mean, when people sound like they care about me. Fussing over me not wearing socks or slippers” Harry shrugged, he was getting better, at least he thought so, however it was slow going and sometimes he couldn’t hide the absolute glee he felt when his dads or the Malfoy’s treated him as though he was something to be looked after. “The Dursley’s would make me clean the gutters in the rain, if I got sick, I had to hide it. They only cared that I was dressed because it wouldn’t have looked good for the neighbours”
“Just…My head hurt, just for a moment. It’s gone now…” Harry answered managing to smile though he was sure it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Stop looking at me like that, honest, I’m fine…The bell is about to ring, finish your lunch…” Sure enough Harry had barely gotten the words out before the bell sounded informing them that it was time to head to Charms.
“…Why did Dumbledore have to leave? Wasn’t he the greatest wizard of all time? I wanted to learn under him!” Hermione asked immediately “I read all about him!”
Had a bunch of treatment and am under a heart specialist... Then they ran another test and found blood where blood shouldn't be... So I was back in the hospital for another round of tests as they thought I might have cancer. Thankfully not. Turns out I have the insides of a 55 year old because I have had undiagnosed crohn's disease for a number of years.... They took a bit of my insides out and hopefully I am now on my way to recovery or at least getting to where it can be treated. I'm still in recovery but as soon as I'm able I will be posting this and dragon tamer! Sorry
“I will find away. Just as I always do, Harry shall be taken care of” A crack and a smashing of pottery caused the tension in the room to snap and they both turned to see the strange and rather highly strung house elf Dobby in the corner of the room looking with frantic wide eyes at a broken flower pot.
“Oh? So, you could blackmail me?” Harry threw out the question casually, but Draco could see that he was only joking and didn’t take the words to heart. Instead he rolled his eyes hummed softly;
“Not your fault, Harry dear, but I think that it’s time for you to be heading back. Your aunt and Uncle will be looking for you” Mrs Figg looked apologetic at even suggesting it but Harry nodded looking at the clock on the far side of the wall seeing that it was almost four thirty and he hummed reluctantly;
“I think you were good. Thank you for reading to me, I know it is a childish and you probably have better things to do…”
“No, another time I was hiding in Mrs’ Figgs bush from Dudley and another little adder was in there, I just started talking and it seemed to nod in agreement. I said that it would be fun if Petunia could see it cause she hated them. The next day Petunia screamed cause the snake had gotten into the bedroom” Harry explained and although he was amused Draco gave a hum and then looked at the snake in the enclosure. It was looking at them its beady eyes unblinking as its black tongue poked out of its mouth flicking up into the air. “She thinks you smell nice”
“A magical device that allows one to travel back in time. It cannot be used for long distances and there is always a risk for meddling with time but...The ministry controls all the time turners, unless he has somehow mastered...” While Severus spoke Harry could tell he was growing more convinced of the idea and Harry allowed himself to smile just a little “Harry, it is possible that you are on to something. Dumbledore always seems to have the upper hand, always seems to know too much and appears to be in multiple places all at once...But we should not get a head of ourselves. Allow me to do some investigation, we shall see...”
“How dare you both!” Severus snapped dragging the errant Weasley twins through the village of Hogsmeade anger burning like a hot flame in his stomach. Everything had been going so well, Harry had been enjoying himself and there had been a flicker of something with Lupin, he was sure of it, the way the other man had looked when he had darted into Zonkos was something that he would perhaps allow himself to remember fondly later. Then everything had come crashing down around his ears, the terror he had seen in his Harry’s face and the anger in Draco’s. His godson had been like a fierce lion staring down both boys and Severus was sure Lucius would be proud but it shouldn’t  have happened “300 points from both of you”
“Nope! The snow cushioned my fall” Harry snorted his grin eyes, free of the glasses sparkled with happiness from under his messy fringe. His cheeks and nose were bright pink from the chill and Draco was sure his own would be. Warming charms could only do so much. “Uncle Luci has an amazing aim”
“You should have stayed in bed Remus, I would have had one of the elves bring you something.” Narcissa told him with a concerned look in her pale eyes but Remus shook his head taking some of the cold cuts and carefully nibbling on them though it looked as if it took a great deal of effort to do so.
“It means that you will be going to Hogwarts to marry the Prince!” Petunia said in a giddy tone and Boy…Or Harry felt his blood run cold his mind on Draco.
“We talked a lot and he made me warm milk and we ha snacks your dad is fun” Harry admitted with a nervous shrug and Draco grinned proudly puffing out his chest dropping down into the chair his father had left.
“Absolutely terrible Mum had us clearing out the gnomes in the garden, nasty little buggers, one bit old Ronnikin’s rather large nose.” Fred howled with laughter patting the back of the smaller red head with so much force it nearly knocked him over. At the mention of nose Harry found himself looking at it surprised to see a rather large dirty stain on one side. Before he could tell the other boy a short dumpy woman dressed in a patchy purple and lime green cardigan came bustling over dragging a girl behind her.
“I cannot say, he did for a time seem happy here, slowly however he has become more unstable. Jinx” Lucius called and the female elf popped into the room smiling happily at them all. One look at the happy female elf told Harry what Lucius said about them being happy being bound to wizards was right, all of the Malfoy elves seemed to be happy, all except Dobby.
“So is Severus. He floo called about two hours ago” Narcissa chuckled smoothing his hair out with her fingers while Jinx was magically dressing him in the robes that had been picked out. “And I believe Lupin has been pacing the garden since six. It is not every day you gain a son, but you are one to be proud of Harry, now can you stomach some breakfast? Severus says you must have something on your stomach, or the potion can be quite sickly”
“Bella is insane, my love, but I am still her baby sister she will not hurt me. I will word it so she will think I am trying to bring back the dark lord. If she knows anything, she will tell me” Narcissa sounded certain and confident but Severus wasn’t so sure. He was positive that the loyal who had served the Dark lord wouldn’t be too happy with those that had gotten away with it. Lucius continued to stare at his wife in silence his eyes seemingly searching her soul before he brought her hand to his lips and kissed it gently.
Much good it did him as he was almost sure that the mate his fox wanted was dead by now. He had been years since he had seen him in the woods. A raven-haired green-eyed beauty dressed in rags with dirt over his face. A vagabond no doubt only clinging to life then and who would no longer be alive now. It was unfair, it truly was. He hadn’t meant to find his mate in the woods in passing so many years ago. He had been riding alone for the first time and his horse had thrown a shoe sending him flying from its back and into a puddle of murky water. Not wanting to admit that he had been thrown from his horse he had looked around for the river he knew to be nearby. Following his nose hadn’t been much use when all he could smell was the dirty water covering his expensive clothes but eventually that scent had faded allowing him the scent of a breeze over the ocean on a warm summer’s day mixed with the sweet scent that came with omegas.
“Dobby is in excellent physical heath, his mental health however is another matter but he is receiving the best possible care in Mungos. Perhaps you should join him? Your obsession with a ten year old boy is frankly disturbing. Please, remove him from my house and away from the children, I will not have them more disturbed than they already are” Lucius turned his back on Dumbledore focusing his eyes on Draco and Harry before breathing out a long and heavy sigh “I’m sorry that you have had to witness this but I promise you, this ends today. Albus Dumbledore won’t even be a shadow by the time you go to Hogwarts. I promise you both”
“We showed them around the school, as promised” Both twins answered quickly before lowering their voices and inching towards the professor “We had a mild run in with Hagrid in the halls.”
Draco led Harry through the winding corridors and down a small flight of stairs to the large basement kitchen. A dozen or so house elves were busying themselves cleaning silver, polishing shoes, and cooking. Not all things were done with magic not even for elves and they were all working happily, or almost all were working happily, Dobby was slamming his head against a wall wailing;
“And yet I’m the one walking with my friends and you appear to be alone.” Draco hummed smoothly motioning to Alice and Chao-Xiang. Ron scowled his face turning red, as he opened his mouth to speak however, he was cut off by Seamus and Pansy coming towards them followed by another Gryffindor Harry vaguely recognised from last night. “Irish, Pants, good to see you.”
“The Goblins would even refuse the ministry, lawless lot, hem hem” Umbridge sneered leaving Harry perplexed about Goblins. He looked at Draco but the young blonde seemed to be lost in his own thoughts and wasn’t looking at him but at a painting on the wall. Harry followed his gaze and was startled to see a young man of about 19 with hair as black as his own his eyes on the other hand were a deep sky blue looking like marbles Dudley had played with as a child. He had tried to force Harry to eat one once and it had gotten lodged in his throat. He didn’t remember much after that until he was on the receiving end of a punch to the stomach by Vernon. The force of it had dislodged the marble and he had gasped for air. The young man in the painting stared at him for the longest time and then motioned for him to listen to what was going on around him.
“What are you apologising for?” Severus asked, his eyebrow lifted slowly up his pale forehead vanishing into his fringe. Harry shrugged and then collected himself knowing that Severus liked him to be more direct.
“Yes, unfortunately, Dobby was not originally our family elf. He came to us not long after Draco was born. He was young then and I felt as though we were doing him a kindness. His true wizarding family had been killed during the war” Lucius stood from the table and moved to stand in front of the unlit fire his hands behind his back and Harry swallowed down a lump from the back of his throat. “He seemed to be unharmed and he agreed to join the elves here happily but it was not long before we suspected that he was troubled. He has no love for our family, but to cut him loose when he has served us for as long as he has, with his mind as fragile as it is and his talk of us being bad. It would only serve to fuel the gossip that runs riot”
Draco was so caught up in the moment, he hadn't noticed when Harry undressed himself enough to do that.
Draco’s heart does a somersault at hearing these words and his face splits into a wide grin. “Yes, Harry.”
“Sorry about that," Draco says after swallowing, "but this is amazing.” Harry chuckles and finally digs in as well. After he’s taken a large bite, Draco seizes the opportunity to ask him something he’s dying to know. “Why a bakery?”
Draco quickly checks the pillow, but there's no message. He can’t smell bacon or waffles either. He didn't expect Harry to make him breakfast again, but for some reason, being left without anything turns Draco's stomach.
Draco is about to protest, but Potter carries on, refusing to allow any interruption. For a moment, Draco gets a strong glimpse of what it must be like when Potter’s on the job, when he senses that someone’s hiding something. Potter’s eyes are dark and are entirely focused on him. “Who are you? Are you involved in some sort of illegal activity?”
“Malfoy.” His voice is husky, and the sound of it sends an unexpected shiver down Draco’s spine. “I can’t say I’m surprised to see you here… visiting.” He closes the book he’s been reading, and holds it up. “Looking for this, I presume.”
Over time, music had brought them closer together. With every visit, their bond grew and feelings for each other had grown. One day, Harry couldn’t hold back anymore and kissed Draco after he’d finished a song.
Draco doesn’t doubt Harry’s abilities for one moment. From what he’s heard from Ginny and even Weasley and Granger, Harry is much more experienced in this area.
Draco feels a warm huff of air near his ear only a split second before Harry leans forward and kisses the spot behind his ear, causing Draco to let out a shaky breath. He slowly turns his head towards Harry and the next kiss lands on his lips, warm and tender.
However, a Healer without a wand is as useful as a Quidditch player without a broom. So, Draco calls his substitute, changes out of his robe, and ends his shift three hours early. He steps into the fireplace in his office to go directly to the Leaky Cauldron. Ollivander doesn’t have a fireplace in his shop — for obvious reasons — and to Floo directly into a shop without a scheduled appointment is rude. His mother hasn’t raised him like that.
Draco runs his hands through his hair. He’s tired, he’s dirty, and above all, he’s exhausted. It’s almost midnight, and it’s all cold — the water in the shower, the flat, the shop. He’s spent the last hours casting warming charms, but the more he casts them, the shorter they last. He knows what he ought to do, but he’s already messed up once today and Harry will undoubtedly owl Neville who, in turn, will arrive back promptly. Draco can’t risk that. He can do this.
At high notes, Draco’s voice began to quiver. Instantly, Harry knew that this was it for tonight. A lump was forming in his boyfriend’s throat, clogging it up.
“You—” The moment Harry’s eyes meet his Draco is lost for words again. He swallows around the lump in his throat and looks down at his hand gripping Harry’s wrist. “You still have my wand.”
He walks over to Potter and places a hand on Potter’s arm to tug him along. Despite the chill, Potter’s skin is warm. Potter gives him a tentative smile, which Draco does not return. He  turns away instead, and lets his hand fall away from Potter’s arm. They begin the trek back in silence, Draco leading the way again.
“The secret passageway. You know, the one that connects the library to the mud room in the back of the house.”
Till today, it was unclear how the man had managed to enter the private fundraiser. Draco had just returned to the stage two months prior, and he’d been planning on not only announcing but also on selling exclusive copies of his new album to raise money. The event, however, would now be remembered forever for a different reason.
“Oh stop it, Pansy.” Ginny slaps her playfully on her arm. “Not everyone is unable to keep their hands to their own lap. I think it’s nice that they’re taking it slow.”
“I guess you’re right.” Harry runs his hands through his hair. ”I just never had to deal with meeting the parents before. When I dated Ginny, I’d already known Arthur and Molly for years. And with the others, it just never happened.”
Truth be told, Draco would like to try it, and he’s never trusted anyone more than Harry. He presses a kiss to Harry’s chest.
Instead of having a nice relaxing evening with his boyfriend — it still feels weird to call Harry that, although they’ve been dating for almost seven weeks — Draco stands in front of the mirror. With a quick flick of his wand, his newly acquired dress robes fly out of his wardrobe, and with another few practiced waves, he’s dressed.
“Loos in ten. You look so fucking hot today,” Harry whispers into his ear and kisses him on his neck, quelling potential objections.
That’s why Draco is here. It would be impossible for Luna to handle the shop and the plants while Neville stays with his grandmother, Augusta, for a few days, helping her to get back on her feet.
“Okay,” Draco responds, readily dispatching the beverages on a nearby table and rolling up his sleeves. He’s never cooked before in his life, every single one of his meals having been made for him since the day he was born. He’d never admit that to Harry, though.
In the background, there’s the click of a lock turning over, and then the sound of wood creaking. They break apart and look over to the heavy double doors of the library. In the orange light of the fire, they can see that one door has swung open, a tiny crack that lets in the cool air of the dim passageway beyond.
, before turning to him, a serious look on his face. Draco inhales deeply. It’s clear that Potter wants to talk. Given their recent track record, however, the chances of any kind of conversation ending with them parting on civil terms is poor. The hurtful words Potter had spoken the last time he was here still echo in his head. He can still recall the look on Potter’s face when he made it clear that he was in this arrangement just for the sex.
Daphne even goes so far as to strike a superhero pose. Ginny and Pansy come up with others. Draco doubts they’ll finish selecting the pictures today.
It’s the only way to describe the man before him. The piercing eyes, the long eyelashes, a hint of freckles on his cheekbones, and the wide, inviting smile. He’s even more gorgeous up close. On a very objective level, of course.
her attention to her wife. While these two have never been shy about talking about their relationship in more detail with Draco than he’d ever do, he’s — so far — never seen them in action. But, oh Merlin, this reminds him of the time he read soft porn with Blaise in their dorm while giving each other a helping hand. Back when Draco pretended he was straight. Because nothing says straight more than reading about two women and having your friend’s fingers wrapped around your cock.
“Tell me Draco, do you want me to stop?” Potter whispers, before biting down on the left side of Draco’s neck.
Draco frowns at him. The words haven’t sunken in yet when Potter continues. “I mean, I really like you. I think, I’m in lo—”
Sex, in the past, has always been quick, an efficient way to reach orgasm and then part ways. That's been enough for Draco, whose schedule has always been filled to the brim. None of the blokes ever knew anything about Draco’s life, sometimes not even his name.
Draco knows he’ll probably fall asleep during the film again, he can barely keep his eyes open as it is, but he has to stay for Pansy. Hopefully, it’ll distract him enough to not think about Potter for now.
The ringing of the alarm clock is the shrillest sound Draco has ever heard in his life. Draco isn’t sure if the horrible headache is caused by this or the liquor he was exposed to yesterday. In the small Healer kit he brought along, there are potions for almost every contingency, but since Draco didn’t think he’d get wasted while looking after plants, there's sadly no Hangover Cure to find in there.
It’s actually quite nice to watch them together, laughing and insulting each other. Eventually, they’re done with both folders, and Draco finally gets his turn. He looks at two pictures of Pansy and Ginny before putting the folder aside — there are things you don’t want to see.
. That’s what people normally wear after they take a shower. I don’t know how you usually shower, but I don’t wear clothes when I’m standing under the water.” He gets up and takes a step in Draco’s direction.
Potter points over Draco’s shoulder at the small table next to the armchair, right in front of the rug that he had been lying on. There’s a bowl of chocolate-covered strawberries that Draco’s pretty sure wasn’t there when he had first entered the library.
Potter shoots him an inquisitive look, but does as he told. Draco waves his wand in a complicated flourish, then casts a
They're supposed to be delivered today, but Draco can't get them to blossom. Only when in full bloom do they reach their full magical potential.
Luna ignores his last remark completely. “Harry made apple tarts. You should get some,” she tells him before leaving.
Pansy has always told him that it’s better with someone you love, but there has never been much of a difference. Now, Draco understands. A different kind of intimacy; one that isn’t purely physical but makes you feel invincible.
The first shackle falls off your right hand. You reach in your mouth to take out the piece of parchment he'd stuffed into it. You move your jaw to relax the strained muscles.
There’s the sound of Potter’s bare feet against the wooden floor, then a hand gently touches his. Potter turns Draco’s wrist upwards, and then places the book in it. Draco relaxes once he feels the familiar leather in his hand.
“Lemme think…” Harry tilts his head, biting his lower lip as he thinks back to yesterday’s conversation. “It went something along the lines of, ‘It’s really quite simple Harry, the both of you have got to sit down and have it out. If you feel something for him, you can’t let him leave without being honest about your feelings for once.’” There’s a slight pause.
Draco’s left hand finds its way into Potter’s hair, his nails scraping against the scalp, and his other hand settling on Potter’s shoulder. Unconsciously, he pushes Potter down, and Potter complies. His hot mouth leaves Draco’s only to find its way back to Draco’s neck, kissing and licking over the skin before he bites down softly, leaving a mark.
It’s when Potter says, “come to the rug, my darling,” a clear invitation in his voice, that Draco finally comes back to his senses. He inhales deeply, pushes himself away from Potter, and takes the final three steps towards the double doors.
A moment later, the warm body that had just been straddling his vanishes. He opens his eyes, blinking at the sudden loss of heat. In one swift motion, Potter’s turning him to face the fire, both of Potter’s strong hands on his hips and pulling him closer to the edge of the bay window. Potter’s on his knees in front of him, a wicked smile on his face as he undoes Draco’s belt.
“Mmmhh...”  For a fraction of a second, Draco can’t help himself, and he leans into the touch, tilting his head to side to give Potter better access to his neck. A drop of sweat runs from his hairline down to his neck, only to be licked away by Potter’s hot tongue. Unwilling, Draco’s eyes drift close.
Draco lifts the item to Potter’s mouth. He can't hear anything over the loud pounding of his heart in his chest. Heat rises into his cheeks as Potter’s teeth carefully dig into the lavender coloured fabric. An image Draco will never forget.
There's a brief pause. Mercifully, Potter keeps his mouth shut, and even has the decency to look slightly ashamed.
“You were drunker than I thought,” Potter mumbles to himself, but Draco can still hear it. “All the stuff here is for Ron’s stag night. You promised you’d help me with the last-minute preparations.”
“Hermione and I have been presenting this one bill for months without success. Then, as a last-ditch attempt, she reaches out to Potter. He comes in, wearing his usual tight-fitting, and for once unwrinkled, robes. Basically, all he does is to smile brightly at the Wizengamot, and they pass it. How’s that fair?” She refills her glass and takes another sip. “How’s that fair?”
Five minutes later, Draco is fumbling with Harry’s clothes again because the man he’s in love with is incapable of dressing himself in anything but jumpers, joggers, or jeans. Harry’s nervous energy is making it impossible for Draco’s spells to work, and Draco feels green eyes watching him intensely as he buttons the sleeves of Harry’s outer robes manually.
Draco wants to point out that Harry, by agreeing to this, has made a rod for his own back, but he doesn’t. At this rate, they’re going to be late for the gala, which is simply out of the question.
Draco places one hand on the door handle, trying to summon his resolve, but it’s difficult when Potter’s murmuring filthy promises into his ear, trying to entice him back to the rug. Draco closes his eyes, basking in the feeling of his strong hands running all over his body, Potter’s mouth pressed up against the shell of his ear, telling him all the ways he’d like to make Draco scream. All the ways he’d like to suck Draco’s cock; all the things he wants to do to him, and Draco’s so close to giving in.
At least he can enjoy the confusion of his father as to why the food remains unsealed. Draco has seen his father watching him like a hawk, so Lucius knows that Draco has at least acknowledged all the guests — that is, the guests that Lucius invited.
With carefully taken steps, he approaches the shop door. He pauses for a second in front of the door to read the name written in loopy script.
“Can you let me finish for once? Godric, do you have to be an insufferable arse all the time? You know as well as I do that you’re not innocent here. Remember what
He complies, starting with Potter picking him up in his Muggle car and driving them to a lovely restaurant. Followed by him showing up on Saturday again because it couldn’t be that Draco had never been to a cinema. Or Sunday when Harry owled him because he’d made too much dinner for one (it might’ve been an excuse, but Draco was not complaining). Draco isn’t even sure if the last date counts as one since he ambushed Potter at work and dragged him out for lunch, but in his mind it does.
When they make their way back, the entire table stares at them. Pansy has the smuggest of expressions on her face, while Thomas and Ginny clink two more shot glasses together, and Ginny’s brother looks like he wants to apparate away.
This seems to kick-start his brain because vivid snippets of last night flash before his eyes. Him knocking on Harry’s door. Harry opening it, wearing nothing but joggers. Harry seeing him completely naked, and…
Harry’s warm palm strokes appeasingly over Draco’s side before his arm slings around Draco’s middle, his hand resting over his heart. Harry resumes to fuck Draco’s thighs, teasingly slow in the beginning and then in earnest.
You’re conscious of the location of every single knife on Malfoy’s body, but the push dagger disguised as a buckle is your blind spot, the single weapon that always slips your mind. Pointy, elegant, and deadly, just like Malfoy.
Draco has no idea how to deal with Harry fucking Potter sitting in his living room one Saturday morning.
Nobody’s been able to get under Draco’s skin the way Harry does, and he isn’t even trying. Never before has the slightest of physical contact made Draco want to melt into the touch. Nowhere else has Draco felt this safe.
If Draco weren't such a skilled Occlumens, he could’ve sworn that Harry is inside his head. Everything he wishes for is done the next second. Kisses on the right spots, promises about later tonight are whispered into his ear as Harry’s hand wraps around his cock.
He allows himself a deep breath, then shoves his feelings aside to concentrate on the problem at hand. Draco lights up his wand and spots what Potter had missed the first time around: there’s a small gap in the stone, and at the end, a rock shaped like a lock.
If your head wasn’t already pushed to the wall, you’d probably bang your head against it out of sheer frustration.
Draco laughs loudly, his entire body vibrating against Harry’s. “That is the worst plan I’ve ever heard.”
They had always been compared. Both of them came from wealthy families: their fathers were rich entrepreneurs. Draco’s mother was a famous model that had small acting gigs from time to time while his own mother had been an actress who sometimes did commercials. And then the only sons of these prominent families chose music.
He has a scathing remark ready on his tongue to accompany the tinkle of shattering glass, but he abruptly shuts his mouth when he sees the face of his kidnapper. Or rather — quite literally — his saviour.
Red, fiery anger rises inside your body when you allow him to distract you with a kiss, only to realise that the shackles bolted into the wall are now enclosing your wrists, leaving you to stare at the headboard. It would be possible to open them if you could just reach your wand.
Apparently kidnapping Draco has become Ginny's favourite pastime. Or how else can it be explained that he finds himself in their living room again? However, this time, he’s sitting in the armchair with a whiskey in hand, facing Ginny and Pansy on the couch.
“I guess you’ll just have to wait and see. And if you don’t get ready, I won’t be your boyfriend for much longer. Mother, in particular, doesn’t appreciate her son and his date being late.”
“I had two patients today who were calling you, and I quote” — Draco moves his fingers, making an air-quote gesture — “a hot, thick Top.”
At exactly 8:53 p.m. — the time when it had happened — the stage was covered in blue, with a spot on Draco. They couldn’t go for her favourite colour since it was red and it would’ve been the worst choice for this kind of event. He took his microphone from the stand and turned to face the audience.
Their breaths become shorter, jagged, and Harry loses his rhythm. Two more strokes are enough for Draco to spill all over the sheets. Draco’s barely conscious enough to notice when Harry reaches his own release shortly after him, but the shout of pleasure is hard to miss.
“We should’ve done this sooner,” Harry laughs breathlessly, moving a strand of hair from Draco’s forehead.
“Today in the pub, when we mentioned bottoming, I noticed how you tensed up and, uhm…” Harry takes a deep breath. “Fuck this is awkward. I’m here if you want to talk or whatever.” There’s a short pause before Harry adds, “No pressure, though.”
“Draco,” Harry sighs, “my bed is big enough for both of us. Come on, now. I have to be up in two hours.”
The clacking of her heels on the wooden floor becomes louder and louder as Pansy moves towards them. “Which one would I meet in the Ministry?” Draco looks up, directly into his best friend’s eyes. “Hi, Draco. Having fun down there? It’s my favourite position.” Pansy smirks at him.
An idea pops into your head. It doesn’t actually classify as an idea, it’s more of a whim. Once again you move forward, but this time you aim for Draco’s right side, and if he wants to drive the blade into your flesh, he’s got to swing it. He does exactly that, but you duck even lower and sweep him off his feet before you take out your gun. The sole of your shoe is on his wrist, pushing down until he lets go of the knife.
Draco scoffs lightly; he can’t think of anything to say to her. Or how do you explain to your best friend that you got wasted in a club one night, fucked somebody, and are still hung up on it? Months later.
Draco grits his teeth. "I'd like to focus on my work. You're distracting me." Harry doesn’t have to see him failing at casting a spell.
Draco’s brain finishes. It’s not that he hadn’t known what Harry looked like topless before they’d become a couple, but then he touched his body, ran his fingers over every inch of skin.
Suddenly, Ginny pops her head through the door, a red spot of what’s most likely tomato sauce on her chin. “If anything happens to Mum’s quilt, I will make you answer for it.” Her eyes move to Draco. “Want some spaghetti with your vodka? I cooked.”
It’s his only weekend off in the foreseeable future. With school about to start, and first years getting their hands on their first wands without proper lessons, more people than usual are admitted to Spell Damage. The temptation to try out the newly-bought wands is almost irresistible, with real consequences for Draco and his colleagues, including the extra hours spent at work. Not for the first time, he wonders if Harry could seal the boxes, so they don’t open again until all students are on the Hogwarts Express.
“So,” Harry said after clearing his throat, which brings Draco back to reality, “do you wanna try with the second dough, Draco?”
Harry sits at the other end of the table, talking to Finnigan and Longbottom about Salazar knows what. He’s happy — smiling constantly and laughing whenever Finnigan cracks a joke. The cutest thing about him is the slight flush on his cheeks.
Potter tries the fireplace, but although he tosses in a generous handful of Floo powder, the fire doesn’t switch to the Floo network. It remains a normal orange. One of the logs shifts slightly in the grate, and sends sparks and ash flying up the chimney.
Draco had thought Potter would show up, the two of them would put on a show of being lovers, and then they’d return to Hogwarts and carry on with their separate lives. The pounding thump of his heart as he gazes at Potter tells him that that’s a stupid idea. Instinctively, his hands clutch harder on Potter.
Or how Ginny had hastened to her girlfriend and was caught in the crossfire between the security and the shooter. Ron had been by her side.
“Beautiful,” Potter breathes, and Draco has to sit down at the look of pure desire on Potter’s face, his ass hitting the cushions of the bay window with a thump. Potter tugs him forward until he’s sitting at the edge of the ledge, and slowly kisses his way up Draco’s calves until he reaches the inside of Draco’s thighs. Draco’s eyes flutter when Potter’s left hand brushes over his cock, Potter’s fingers sliding up and down teasingly before he grips Draco’s cock loosely, and begins to stroke. Potter’s mouth continues its tour up Draco’s body until he reaches Draco’s hipbone. He bites down gently, marking him, before he licks his path back south again. The combination of Potter’s hot, wet tongue against his skin and Potter’s hand on his cock feels incredible.
You hate him when he forces you on all fours before casting wandless preparation spells — all while clothed.
Draco kisses him hard, needing the connection in the post-orgasmic bliss. A slow and tender kiss that helps him come down from the high.
The song was barely finished before Harry ran across the stage to Draco. He pulled him into his arms, shielding him from prying eyes and nosy cameras. The news sites and tabloids across the globe would run a story on them tomorrow, but he couldn’t care less about their opinion of his relationship with Draco.
It’s infectious, and it’s never fake. If Draco could, he’d bottle it up and listen to it on repeat for the rest of his days. Harry never pretends, and maybe that’s why Draco finds himself so drawn to him. Harry wears his heart and his emotions on his sleeve, and Draco never has to guess how the man really feels.
Surprisingly, the rest of the day passes without incident. They manage to keep their wands in their pockets, and none of Draco’s neighbours need to be Obliviated. While Draco cleans up the last remnants of the party preparations, Potter picks up the two bags filled with the things they’ve prepared. He’s wearing the sash that reads “Weasley is our Queen” on the front and “A Beauty that needs to be seen” on the back, and the crown sits proudly on his head. The two inflatable dolls are tucked under his arms.
He goes to take a swig of champagne, but the glass slips from his fingers as someone grabs his arm and drags him onto the dance floor.
Ever since Ginny casually dropped the bomb that is Potter’s sexuality, hours have been spent imagining different scenarios. Many hours, more than Draco is comfortable admitting. It’s not that he
“I expected you to hex me into next year, or at least to storm in here, maybe setting fire to the quilt.”
Ginny is the first to laugh, but soon the entire table follows. Then, Pansy pretends to be a Prophet reporter asking questions about their bedtime activities. It turns into an 18+ game of ‘Never Have I Ever’ over food.
In lieu of replying, Draco opens the door for her and ushers her in. He just wants to get this over with. It’s not like she really needs him anyway — he’s not even in the same room when they stick a needle into whatever part of her body needs to be accentuated this time — but it’s more his physical presence that calms her down.
“Sorry,” Harry says, blinking, confused. “Here.” He returns the wand and tries to step away, but Draco holds his grip.
There had been no big announcement. They just walked out of Ollivander’s holding hands three weeks ago, counting on modern technology and the vicinity to the Prophet’s headquarters to do the rest.
Draco barely manages to not spit his whiskey all over the rug when Ginny wiggles her eyebrows. Having a certain reputation can be a curse at times. In the corner of his eye, he sees Pansy biting the inside of her cheek to keep herself from laughing.
“You mental?” He shakes his head and closes his eyes, trying to get the image of Potter out of his brain. He seriously wishes he could Obliviate himself. Seeing Potter like this, naked and inviting, makes it almost impossible to leave. It takes all of Draco’s willpower not to simply push Potter up against a wall and fuck him senseless. “Give me that bloody book and then I'm out of here. Now!”
Potter ignores Draco’s remark. “What happened this time? Pixie attack? Or did another potion burn the wood to ashes?” Potter looks like a dog who’s excited about going outside.
Draco rests the palm of his hand on Harry’s cheek, stroking Harry’s skin tenderly as he looks at him. Harry’s face is open, happy, and Draco takes a deep breath. He has never expected to say these words to anybody and mean it, and yet here he is, steeling himself to bare his heart. He loves Harry; has loved him for a long time now.
“Oh yes, Draco’s stiff posture and icy glare at his guests scream ‘successful party,’” Millicent remarks.
Draco checks the time, sees he’s almost late — for his standards — to pick up Harry, and makes his way to the Floo. He pointedly does not think about where they’ll be going tonight because then he’d need another dress shirt. Maybe even another shower.
“These two were just leaving.” Draco is glaring daggers at his best friend. Not that he doesn’t appreciate her, but he’s been looking forward to enjoying a nice date night with his boyfriend. Nothing particularly special, just a bite and a drink in a Muggle pub.
It’s quite ironic that of the ten women his parents have invited, three are in a relationship. With each other. It’s even funnier that his father had been desperate enough to invite Ginny Weasley. She is probably as interested in men as he is in women. She can also lift him up and carry him bridal style over a threshold. Which would have made for interesting wedding photos if they hadn’t both been horribly gay.
I know I'm late. Very late, but I've honestly had most of the chapter written by life decided to shred all my plan with a smile on its face. Anyway, here it is. I'm gonna work on the next one now, hoping it'll be out on time.
Deadly, but fucking hot. Being at his mercy never fails to do its job. You’re hyper-aware of his breath tickling the hair on the side of your head and the weight of Malfoy’s body driving you harder into the stone wall. You feel his magic wash over you when he gets rid of the blood on your face.
Draco pauses in front of the fireplace to fully appreciate Potter’s naked body on display. Potter’s tanned skin is lined with scars that he’s collected over the years, and Draco’s already spent hours tracing and mapping every single one of them. He runs an appreciative gaze over them now; over Potter’s well-defined muscles from all the hours he spends training. Potter stays perfectly still as Draco looks at him, his body tense with anticipation. The warm glow of the fireplace highlights every contour of his body, and Draco reaches out to touch Potter’s chest. He runs his hands lightly over Potter’s skin, feeling Potter’s heart beating fast under his palm. He slides them over Potter’s hard abs, and settles them at Potter’s hips.
It’s not at all like this, but Draco has to admit that he’s gone through a lot of wands ever since Potter started working here. Maybe it’s fate?
The thing is, he's been incredibly happy for the past week, and as superstitious as it may sound, he hasn’t wanted to jinx it. Not when he isn’t absolutely sure about Harry feeling the same way. But since Harry apparently told Hermione — and by extension, Ron — about them, maybe Draco hasn’t been reading the signs wrong after all.
Blinking a few times to make sure that Harry has really sent him this and it’s not a horny mirage, Draco can feel heat rushing to his cheeks. Harry has never sent him a picture. And what a sight it is. Harry straight out of the shower, his hair still damp and his towel hanging low on his hips. Draco should play hard to reach more often if this is what he gets in return.
Reaching for Draco’s hands, Potter pulls him to his feet as Draco kicks off his shoes and steps out of his pants, leaving them behind on the floor, crumpled. He guides them both over to the white, soft rug in front of the fire that’s burning even brighter than before. As he walks, Potter discards his bathrobe and slippers, leaving him fully naked, and Draco still half-dressed.
That’s the most accurate description of his feelings tonight. Since Draco is about to turn thirty in less than six months, his parents — or to be more precise, his father — decided enough was enough and told him at Christmas that a ball would be held shortly after New Year’s to which all eligible pure-blood women would be invited. Such an old tradition. One of many Draco hates.
he arrives — Draco might have alcohol poisoning. Stealing food from the buffet hasn’t worked. The food is sealed under charms until the hosts officially greet all the guests.
“By Merlin’s crusty old beard, that absolute tit of an idiot didn’t update the wards! I could be a psychotic raging axe-murderer out for revenge for all he knows. And he dares call himself an Auror? How utterly careless! Whatever happened to
Potter smiles again, clearly pleased with himself. “So it’s not that. Thanks for confirming my suspicions. I think I know you well enough by now to know when you’re telling the truth and when you’re lying. There’s another thing which you forgot. I work in the Ministry, and as it seems, so do you.”
“Wow. I’ve never seen so much of you, Pansy. When did the Wizengamot robes become so translucent? And what exactly is Ginny doing with the tip of her broom?”
“Fuck, Potter.” The words come out breathy. Draco’s mouth is dry. He lets out a stream of curses as Potter keeps up the slow pace, keeps him right there on the edge. Then the wet hotness that is Potter’s mouth suddenly disappears.
“It’s going to be fine, Harry. It’s better to meet my parents like this than to face them two-on-two for a Sunday lunch. Ginny and Pansy will be there as well. So will a lot of other people you know.”
Then Potter adjusts his clothing, looking coyly up at Draco through his eyelashes, and Draco blinks twice when he catches sight of—“Merlin’s saggy tits, Potter! This is obscene.”
The only thing that’s still somewhat a mystery to Draco is what they’re doing right now. Because this doesn’t really feel like a simple apology meal shared with… a friend? Are they even friends?
Underneath all these layers, Draco shouldn’t be able to feel anything. Yet his skin is ignited, and the heat rolls in waves through his entire body.
The lions eye Draco suspiciously as if they can read his thoughts, and they give him an open-mouthed, silent snarl, which he answers with a disdainful sniff, before turning back to the bookcase.
Draco looks up at Harry who’s slowly sinking into the opposite chair. Harry’s eyes move from Ginny to Pansy before stopping at Draco, nonverbally checking with him if he’d forgotten that they were all supposed to meet here today.
"This is unacceptable," Draco remarks. "I'm gonna cut the direct line between our Floos, Pansy, if your wife continues to abduct innocent Healers from their houses."
Then the mood shifts. Potter looks as if he’s trying to solve a difficult Arithmancy problem. His brows are knit together and his right hand is at his chin, fingertips stroking the stubble there.
He slides a third finger. Harry groans at that, his body trembling with need. Draco holds still, waiting until he feels like Harry’s adjusted, then slowly resumes pumping his fingers in and out of Harry, lets him get used to the burn and slide until he’s whimpering for more.
“Here.” Harry is suddenly behind Draco, his hands on top of Draco’s. “See, you have to knead harder, otherwise…”
For a moment, Draco sincerely believes that Harry has covered himself up. He lowers his hand, only to be confronted with Potter’s terry-cloth bathrobe hanging completely open, exposing Potter's front; his cock is already half-hard. The red-orange flames of the fire illuminate Potter's tanned skin; highlight the sharp angles of Potter's body—the lines of his chiseled jaw that softens into a teasing smile; the jaunty thrust of his hip. Potter looks exactly like sex on legs. He looks like everything that Draco had dreamed about, like everything that Draco had once wanted.
They’re each devoted to their own task, silence stretching between them. When Draco can’t bear it any longer, he says, “How do you deal with all these weddings? I’m done in after only two days.”
Draco grins slyly at that. “How exactly will Weasley walk through Muggle London tonight?” he asks while beginning to glamourise the crown.
You hate him because it feels so bloody good. So amazing that your mind wanders without permission into the treacherous, and very dangerous, 'what-if' fields. For just a few seconds, you stay there, let the images unfold, linger there.
Silence descends again, bringing with it a tension so thick that you could cut through it with a wand. Opposite him, most of Potter’s face is cast in shadow.
Even after over two hours of being here, Draco mostly keeps to himself. He listens with interest to conversations around him and drops a comment here and there, but he’s still nervous. These are Harry’s friends; a pride of lions. And they’re celebrating Hermione’s birthday, so it’s not a casual after-work thing that he could’ve skipped. Having Pansy beside him makes it a little more bearable, although she’s been integrated for years while he feels as if he’s being tested.
He makes his way up the stairs to the library at a quick pace. Every time a wooden step squeaks under his shoe, he startles, and looks behind himself to check that the coast is clear. The paintings on the wall are all his distant relatives once or twice removed, and they eye him sharply as he goes past, but remain quiet. Draco exhales in relief once he’s past them. He stops on the landing and waits to see if anyone’s given him away; or if Kreacher would appear. Technically, Kreacher should be at Hogwarts, but he could pop back anytime Harry or the house summons him. When nothing happens after a minute and the house remains silent, he makes his way cautiously over to the heavy double doors of the library.
And if this isn’t enough reason to never repeat this ever again, Malfoy forces you to open your mouth, effectively gagging you. Whatever it is, it’s so deep in your mouth that you can’t spit it out, but not so deep to constantly trigger your gag reflex.
On top of that, everything smells like Harry. Like… warmth and comfort. Draco wraps the quilt around himself, burying his nose in it. He tries not to think about the hot body next to his, and how much he'd like to close the distance. How much he wouldn’t mind being wrapped in Harry’s arms.
“Non, c’est trop tôt.” Draco looks up, seeing the confusion on Neville’s face, and then it clicks. He’s been speaking French. “Sorry. When does your Portkey leave?”
He tugs the book out of its resting place. There’s a slight resistance before it slides free halfway. When he’s sure that it’s come as far as it can go, he releases it, and the book slides silently back into the bookcase. There’s a soft click as the old gears start up, the machinery slowly kicking into action after years of disuse. Draco steps back expectantly as the bookcase before him sinks back into the wall, and slides behind the others to reveal a gaping hole blanketed in darkness.
All of a sudden, Potter emerges from behind the shelves. As he steps towards the counter, Draco has a hard time not to let his jaw drop. He’s had ideas (let’s call it ideas, okay?) about Potter in full work attire since he’s seen the photos, but oh my… he is
“The book please, Potter. Give me my book and then I’ll get out of your hair.” Draco stretches out his right hand in Potter’s direction. His forehead is damp with sweat, and he’s not sure if it’s because of the fire, or because of Potter. It feels like the room is getting hotter by the minute, and Draco reaches up with his other hand to adjust his robes. Then he catches sight of the look on Potter’s face, thinks better of it, and lets his hand drop down.
Harry as always acted first and then thought later. Maybe this time he’s been a bit too hasty to agree.
“Ladies, I mean it,” Daphne warns. “I won’t let you help me with next year’s motto nor let you participate if you continue like this.”
Yes, you’re impulsive, and yes, sometimes your plans aren’t completely thought through, but you leave no traces. Nothing. Nobody.
He opens his eyes, his heart pounding hard in his chest. He has no idea where he is, or how he ended up in this bed. On the pillow beside him lies a note. When Draco picks it up, his eyes fall to the name at the bottom of the paper.
to try storm his way out. The door shakes heavily, rattling in its hinges and glowing red as the spell sinks in, before it stills again. Draco sighs audibly.
There’s barely a metre to the roof edge, so the only direction is forward. The easiest way to tip the scales would be to draw your gun, but before you could even do so much as point it in his direction, he’ll have thrown his knife at you. Malfoy won’t make the first move. Being in a defensive position, especially with a knife in hand, is always an advantage.
Draco pointedly ignores her and focuses on repairing the tissue layer by layer, slowly closing the gash. Suddenly, Ginny kicks him with her other leg on his upper arm.
“Hey,” Harry says, and Draco turns to him, propping himself up on one arm to look at him. Harry’s lying spread-eagled with his hands folded underneath his head. He looks as if he’s just downed an entire vial of Felix Felicis—there’s a wide, pleased smile on his face.
Once all traces have gone down the drain, Draco opens the curtain and reaches for a towel. To his surprise, it’s fluffier than it looks. And it smells good, too. He brings a bit of the soft fabric to his nose, inhaling deeply. The scent is interestingly sweet and crisp; oddly calming. Once he realises what he’s doing, though, he quickly starts drying himself off.
“Honestly, it wasn’t my dream growing up; I always wanted to be an Auror.” Draco huffs out a laugh. “It’s true,” Harry continues with an amused smile on his face. “I tried to be one, but I simply couldn’t. Not after all that had happened. Cooking is still difficult for me sometimes — long story short, the people I grew up with were abusive arseholes and forced me to cook for them before I even could read — but baking is different. I love seeing happy smiles on people's faces when they come into the bakery. And I also love the involuntary moans people let out as they taste my treats.” Harry smirks at him, and Draco tries his best to stay cool, knowing he’s failed when he feels the heat rushing to his cheeks once more. That’s when Harry begins to laugh — a loud, belly laugh that fills the room.
“He is, though he would be embarrassed to hear you say such. Come, Draco has a surprise for you, and he believes that it might help” Lucius rose gracefully to his feet and then held his hand out for Harry. Harry carefully moved Snowdrop and allowed the older man to help him up. “I believe he and Cissa will have had ample time to set it up”
“No, it was my fault, I shouldn’t have betrayed you like that…” Harry said squeezing the woman back briefly before moving to pull out her chair for her. “I’m glad you came; I didn’t know if you would.”
