,” teased Malfoy. “My point is that you can keep on top of your spell work regardless of what the guards want.”
“Because... I’m not his son. He shouldn’t risk Azkaban just for
dark magic. It’s a way to gain immortality. Sort of. The theory is that, you can break off a portion of your soul and store it in an inanimate object. If you died, you’re still tied to this world. Someone else can use that portion of your soul to bring you back,” Harry said.
“It’s alright,” Hale said and backed off on suggesting they used Harry’s memory. Regrettably, that meant that Harry had to recount Burke’s attack in painstaking detail so that Hale could record it. It was hard. Harry watched the quill moving across the parchment instead of looking at Hale the whole time. When it got to the part where Burke lost his soul, Harry stuck to the story that Lucius had already told the guards.
“Like Moody’s eye?” asked Harry.
“No one was as bad a Burke, but… some do hurt prisoners, most just say mean things or ignore you… which means they ignored what Burke did,” Harry said. He knew that some guards might have stood idle because they feared Burke rather than from genuine malicious intent. But the result was the same for Harry either way.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Is my trial going that badly?” he asked as he feared why the minister was so confident he wouldn’t have to move Harry at all.
Harry and Theo sat on the floor, close to the classroom door. As Theo scanned Harry’s notes, the others crowded around to get a look as well.
Just like when they entered the showers, Lucius and Nott stuck close to Harry as they left. He once again tried to keep his focus at eye-level and hoped the other prisoners were giving him the same courtesy. The room’s temperature quickly dropped with the lack of warm water flowing. Consequently, goosebumps covered Harry’s body. Harry already didn’t want the other men to see him naked, but he especially didn’t want it to happen when he was experiencing shrinkage due to the cold. Harry once again strategically placed his hands in front of him as he walked, and desperately looked for a towel.
“He’s been cooperative so far, Burke,” interjected Perkins. Unfortunately, kind comments were the only championing he seemed willing to do for Harry.
There wasn’t much in his pockets. A half-eaten box of Bertie Botts, a note he and Ron were passing each other during Charms earlier that day – he rather hoped they hadn’t written anything embarrassing or incriminating - and the beginning of his Charms essay that he decided to scarp and start over. As Burke pulled out the items, Anton marked a note of them on his form and started placing them in a bag.
“Er, Hale is his dad’s judicial-wizard too,” Harry said. The statement wasn’t a lie, though Harry knew they wouldn’t appreciate an intentional misdirection either. Harry wanted them to assume Hale had told Nott while he was visiting the school. He was certain Nott caught on, as he let the statement stand with a minor smirk he quickly repressed.
. Harry didn’t need to look at Burke or Bradley to know that if he protested he’d probably still end up taking the picture but would probably also be sporting a black eye.
“Harry?” Theo asked.
“Why not?” the wizard repeated.
Sensing that Harry was more than willing to forgo defense review if it came tied with dark arts, Lucius decided to cut in.
“Actually, if you’re being honest about it-” started Nott.
Mulciber’s bottle of lube started off no taller than an inch high. If pressed on the bottom while saying the word “Celestina”, the bottle would grow larger. As a last-minute decision, Harry made the larger version oversized. It felt like a gag gift, but Harry thought Mulciber would find it hilarious... and practical.
Harry cast magic almost non-stop throughout the day, but never felt any fatigue. He might of said he was feeling normal, if he hadn’t been wide awake while the others got ready for bed. It took some convincing for Harry to get the others to sleep instead of keeping him company all night.
“Something like that,” Harry grinned.
“I didn’t think the guards would help,” Harry said.
acceptable, but, er, understandable, I guess,” Harry amended uncertainly. “Like the muggles who’ve hurt someone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I see it?” asked Theo.
Harry got up after he realized he only had two class periods to go about the castle uninterrupted. He grabbed the first sweater and pair of jeans he found, but instead of just changing out of his formal robes, he opted to take a shower first. He might have had one that morning, but he relished the thought of being alone for a change. He didn’t need to charm the water to remain warm, but he still used his wandless magic to make his soap and shampoo levitate around him. It was a relief to let out some magic and consequently the pressure of Burke’s soul. He hadn’t been able to do anything magical since his first shower, and the pressure had been slowly building.
There were a couple of minutes where no one said anything, just watched Harry or exchanged glances with their neighbors. Harry knew that if the courtroom didn't have anti-apparating wards all over it, he would have accidentally apparated himself back to his old school’s roof just to get away from everyone. He looked at Hale somewhat desperately.
“Months? What happened?” he asked.
“Draco, I can’t. It’s too...” Harry put down his fork and pushed away his meal as his stomach churned just thinking about what he’d done.
“I hate to ask more of you, Harry, but could you provide me with some parchment and a quill?” Lucius asked once he finished his meal.
“So Albert, how did your trial go today?” asked Harry, purposely changing the subject.
“You don’t have to keep the ring,” he offered because he trusted that she’d protect it, but he had no right to ask it of her.
“I will carry Harry’s child myself if it comes to that,” Draco said, trying to end the conversation so he and Harry could have it in private first.
“I think I’m a horcrux,” Harry whispered and found that saying it again did not make it any easier.
1996?” Runecraft cut in as soon as they’d officially started. Harry looked to Hale for guidance, but the man had already jumped in.
“Help,” Harry whispered as he watched the unmoving dementor. He pushed feebly at Burke while the man’s attention was off him, but barely managed to get the man to budge.
“Right here,” stated Burke.
“Good dreams?” Ron asked when Harry ‘woke up’ in a good mood.
“Yes,” Harry said resolutely. “Look, I get it, I do. When someone hurts you, it’s normal to want them to suffer in some way… but I don’t think Azkaban, at least as it is now, is the solution. However we respond as a society to crime… well, it shouldn’t be that…”
Conversation flowed smoothly until lunch. Harry’s eyes constantly strayed to the photos of Draco he had hidden in the folds of his sheets. If Albert or Lucius noticed, they tactfully pretended they did not. In return, Harry once again used magic to make the meal taste better than it was. Harry ate very little despite his new ability. The pressure of Burke’s soul had lessened, but the ‘full’ feeling had not completely subsided. Harry gave his bread to Crabbe and sent the rest back half-eaten.
“Burke?” Harry questioned when he saw a man pull open the door his cell. In the dark of the night, it was hard for Harry to make out the features of the man without his glasses on.
“I guess that means I’m not expelled?” Harry asked instead.
It takes Harry longer than he’d care to admit, but by the time he put the pot down again, the spell work was significantly more impressive. A rough life cycle of a plant continuously played out. Starting as a small seed resting atop the soil, the seed slowly sank into the earth and a moment later a sprout grew from the soil. It turned into a stem, and eventually bloomed into the flower Harry had initially created. The flower aged and wilted. Once its petals fell, the dead plant reformed into a seed and the process started again. Harry hoped Crabbe would genuinely like it rather than the perfunctory thank you Harry had expected with his original efforts.
“Martin, bring Burke to... might as well be the office. Not like there is a good place to store him,” the last guard that arrived ordered once Burke’s clothes were back in order. The guard nodded and levitated the body out of the cell. Harry was happy to see them go.
“Maybe keep moving in case Snape went to fetch McGonagall,” Harry said. Hale nodded and the two of them continued to walk towards the gate.
“And how did you do it when you were in a coma?” Draco pointed out the flaw in Harry’s logic.
“Really? You’re going with innuendo? Your mum is going to ask me to describe this moment in detail; what am I supposed to tell her?” Harry asked.
Since the Harry and Draco interactions can’t happen just yet, I’m trying to bring Draco in where I can. Thus, Harry being obsessed with his handful of photos. Somewhat creepy? But let’s face it, we’ve all been there.
This time, instead of a solitary figure gliding past the cells, there were three of them. Harry could not tell one from the other, so he didn’t know which, if any, had been the one from last night. All three had stopped at his cell door and turned towards him.
Perkins led the way, with Dumbledore and Harry following closely behind. The headmaster placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder to better steer him around the crowd. Just as they surged forward with questions for Harry, Hale loudly offered to speak on his behalf. The crowd didn’t seem too keen to let Harry go, but with Dumbledore and an auror serving as buffers, Hale was clearly the best way for them to get a comment for their stories. Once they were past the main crowd, their walk out of the ministry was unimpeded. Just as quickly as Harry had been whisked away from Hogwarts, Dumbledore brought him back.
Harry briefly considered telling McGonagall about his study sessions in Azkaban. However, Ron and Hermione’s shocked reactions did not bode well. It seemed like McGonagall, and by extension Dumbledore, would have a similar reaction. Harry didn’t want to deny his new friendships, but he held back. It had been a long day already and he had no desire to deal with the fallout of that on top of everything else. So, he strategically pretended to struggle with some spells. McGonagall seemed content overall. At the end of their meeting, she informed him that he only had to complete the missed assignments for the spells he’d ‘struggled’ with. Had Harry known this was her intention, he wouldn’t have pretended to struggle that much, suspicions be damned.
“Well, Albert is the one who hired Hale for me,” he said hoping that Hermione’s practical side would understand how beneficial that was to Harry’s release. “And they made me
“It was a compliment,” Mulciber brushed off Lucius’ warning. “So Pots, why haven’t you asked Draco out yet?”
“Wait! How am I supposed to pay you? I can’t exactly go to Gringotts,” Harry worried.
“So, she didn’t mean to kill him,” proposed Lestrange.
“I was just going to request privacy charms,” Lucius said with a smirk. “I don’t want to see Dolph using your gift any more than you’ll want to hear it.”
“Surely you can take it, Potter,” Burke responded.
“You know I’ve done worse than childish pranks... though some of them were rather cruel,” Draco admitted. He remembered thinking himself clever, but in retrospect had been rather mean-spirited.
“Move,” ordered the guard at the end of the hallway. The prisoners started shuffling forward in a single file. They headed in the opposite direction from where Harry entered this wing of the prison.
“Are you having us on?” asked Crabbe. The man was very confused by the concept. Harry didn’t blame him. It should be impossible.
Harry knew it looked odd to Hale that he was willing to pass along love notes to the woman he had been arrested for cursing. However, it wasn’t about Bellatrix. Harry did it for Rodolphus. If Bellatrix got some comfort from the letter, well, that was regrettably unavoidable.
The guards were all riveted on Burke’s unresponsive body. Fortunately for Harry, they assumed gravity was the cause of Burke falling over. Harry’s accidental magic had either not reached them or was mild enough to overlook while coming to terms with this crisis.
“I’ve already asked Neville to explain his and Hermione’s class notes,” Harry informed her. Since Neville was one of her stronger students, Sprout was satisfied with Harry’s choice.
Just in case, Harry decided he should contact Hale for advice too. The man would be able to tell him about specific laws or policies that he should look into, or perhaps certain people he should talk to. Plus, the man had a remarkable ability to use words as a weapon. Maybe he would be willing to coach Harry on what to say when advocating for change.
“Pointy,” Draco said dryly.
“Ginny – she tried to pick a name you’d like. James after your father, and Prewett, well that’s my maiden name,” Mrs. Weasley explained though she looked worried Harry would object.
“Did you call for help from any of the other guards?” asked another wizard.
“Still, if you can’t find anything, don’t worry about it,” Harry said.
“They arrested me for the department of mysteries fiasco,” Harry answered. Malfoy raised his eyebrows but fortunately no one laughed. Harry suspected they probably were a little amused that he was now in Azkaban with them for incidents that occurred the same night most of them were arrested.
“I think every time I use magic, it kills a portion of Burke’s soul,” Harry said faintly. He looked towards the dementors in hope that they would tell him that wasn’t the case.
“Other horcrux?” questioned Lestrange.
“It’s not,” Harry insisted. “You
“Wait Auror Perkins, Mr. Runecraft,” Dumbledore interjected. “You can’t possibly mean to arrest the boy.”
“They said I had another soul – a piece of one
“Git,” Ron agreed. “But you should be fine in defense.”
“Maybe not with any other student, but he hates me enough to make an exception,” Harry pointed out. He belatedly realized he was frowning. It was at the thought of what Snape might say about the Dursleys, but he was directing his frown towards Draco. When Draco looked away with his own frown, Harry had to hold back the impulse to call himself an idiot.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked in alarm when Burke leaned over Harry’s prone form. In response the man grabbed a fistful of Harry’s hair and yanked his head to the side.
Before Harry made it back to the Gryffindor common room, a younger student stopped him to say Dumbledore wanted to see him in his office. With a sigh, Harry changed direction.
“Wouldn’t that be a shame? I can see it now. The headlines reporting the tragic tale of Potter getting kissed in an escape attempt. And just when Dumbledore was about to rescue him too. Such a shame it would be,” Burke mocked and leaned against Harry’s bars. Harry wanted to call Burke’s bluff but the truth was he didn’t know if the man was bluffing or not. So far, Harry hadn’t seen anything in Burke’s character that would suggested he wouldn’t let a dementor kiss one of the prisoners.
Harry stared at Asherath in horror, as he realized the significance of what the dementor was telling him.
Harry blinked in surprise. He hadn’t considered it mostly because he hadn’t been given the opportunity to make arrangements. He had hoped that Dumbledore had hired someone to work on his case, but with a sinking feeling, he realized the man had probably intended to represent Harry himself. Given how resistant the ministry was to Dumbledore at the moment, it was probably hindering Harry’s case more than helping.
“Fine!” Jugson snapped. “But if the dark lord questions why the boy left here with nary a scratch, I’ll be the first to point to you.” Neither Lucius nor Nott seemed particularly worried.
“When I made the horcrux... er, to make a horcrux, you have to do more than just... kill someone. I...” Harry thought it would be easier to say it while Draco’s head rested on his chest. He could avoid seeing Draco’s expression turn to disgust, but still have the comfort of holding him. However, Harry didn’t know how to get the words out. He’d hidden this secret for years. Draco knew about the horcrux, but he’d never pressured Harry to reveal how it was made. Harry clung to the hope he could live up to the person Draco
“Thank you,” Lestrange said. He sounded sincerely grateful. The sense of longing in his voice made the others uncomfortable though they could empathize.
“You’re not,” Draco snapped back. When Harry just raised an eyebrow in response, Draco sagged and sighed. “Alright, there is some... damage,” Draco flinched as if saying the word caused him physical pain, “but, you’re still whole.”
“He’s in your common room,” Harry said.
Neville’s visits were the only ones he never felt any sort of trepidation with. He loved Ron and Hermione, he did, but they were clearly waiting for Harry to open up about his feelings (Hermione), or reminisce about Ginny’s past antics (Ron). Both were things he wasn’t ready for, and Neville was the only one who didn’t push it or look at him expectantly. Early on, Neville had offered to tell him about the time he’d missed, having spent lot of time supporting Ginny during her pregnancy, but when Harry had shamefully admitted he wasn’t ready to hear it – that he may never be ready to hear it – Neville never brought it up again; the only one seemingly content to let it be.
“How? You may have noticed I’m stuck in Azkaban,” Albert gestured around him.
“But I can’t just leave it,” Harry said miserably, “it hurts.” It was more of an excessively uncomfortable feeling than true pain. All the same, Harry felt like it would drive him mental if he had to live like this forever.
Harry left soon after as he couldn’t leave James with the Weasleys all morning. They’d done enough for him as it was. He dreaded facing Mrs. Weasley as he worried he’d see her disappointment in him. Instead, Hermione was waiting for him and he didn’t know if that was better or worse.
“Thank you,” Lucius said and cradled the photo.
Hale introduced him as Mr. Lance, and made sure to stress the fact that he had recently won some prestigious award for investigative reporting. Harry made the appropriate impressed noises though he’d never heard of that award before. He knew Hale intended to put Harry at ease with Lance’s obvious competence in his job. But, it was Lance that eventually reassured Harry when he confided that his cousin had been arrested, and subsequently died in Azkaban only seven months into his sentence. Harry felt like Lance shared Harry’s desire for prison reform even if the man hadn’t outright said it.
“Er, I don’t know if this is the best place to discuss this,” Harry stalled.
“I think it was an accident, but Voldemort knew how to make horcruxes. When he tried to kill me, it backfired. No one knows how I survived. What if it’s because he was trying to make a horcrux?” Harry said in a rush. He didn’t know the specifics of making a horcrux, so he didn’t know how likely it could backfire in this way. But how else could he have gotten someone’s soul in him? Who else could it be?
Harry was on his way out of the great hall when they arrived. Another minute and he probably could have avoided a large spectacle. But a spectacle is exactly what these men wanted. Five ministry employees stood at the doors leading into the great hall. Four were dressed in Auror robes while the fifth was wearing robes that Harry had come to expect to see on an older high-class pureblood wizard.
“Even if it harmed school children?” confirmed Hale.
“Are you sure you’re ok?” asked Crabbe softly.
“Ugh! That man is such a... a...,” Harry struggled to find a word that was insulting enough for an idiot like Burke. He couldn’t find one that properly articulated his feelings about the man, so he settled for something Dudley and his cronies used, “fart-knocker!”
“Was it for... you know,” asked Hermione. She could not outright ask if it was related to Voldemort because of the crowded room. She frowned when she spotted Romilda Vane nearby, obviously listening in. Hermione cast a privacy spell with a glare.
“That’s just one part of it. It’s not just about the guards. They’re part of a system that needs to change,” Harry said with a sigh. An awkward silence fell. Harry pulled Hale’s scroll close and started to read through it.
“Since no one else has survived the killing curse, we have nothing to compare your symptoms to,” she said. Harry couldn’t explain it any more than she could. He didn’t mention seeing Dumbledore and the train station in what he assumed was the in-between. He certainly couldn’t mention that he’d made the choice to come back. He had several theories on why he was able to survive the killing curse, and none were something he planned to share with a stranger. He’d let her and everyone else assume it was the same thing that had miraculously saved him the first time, though Harry knew it couldn’t be. He hadn’t fallen into a coma when this happened to him as a baby.
Harry was quiet for a moment before he pointed out, “this is still me trying to do magic. I still don’t know how to stop it from happening accidentally.”
Theo nodded when he read Harry’s response. Both got back to work, pretending Harry had just been helping Theo with his Defense homework. It amused him when Ginny got Theo to read over two of her assignments, the second one the boy practically ended up writing for her.
“Wake us up if you need to,” offered Crabbe.
“Not if you call it sexy times,” Draco snorted. He reconsidered as he watched his husband change into pajamas, but steeled his resolve. For better or worse, he was going to try to answer the horcrux conundrum.
“Alright,” Harry accepted Nott’s offer.
“No. No. But they
to use any of the good insults.”
Ron still wasn’t eager to have Nott join them. Sensing this, Nott asked Ron if he wanted to go play a game of chess once they’d both finished their homework. Harry didn’t know if it was the opportunity to get away, or the fact that Nott suggested his favourite game, but Ron agreed without making a fuss and implying Nott was up to something nefarious.
Harry found both books interesting, though they were a little above Harry’s very beginner knowledge on the subject. He needed Nott to explain a good portion of what he read, but they couldn’t speak about it while surrounded by other students. Harry’s progress was also hindered by his regular classes.
“Er...” Harry hesitated, not sure how to respond. He couldn’t look Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the eye, so he helplessly looked down and watched James.
“You have no evidence to support that claim,” Hale countered.
“Yeah,” Harry answered.
“Yeah, but we had enough warning. I stashed some of your stuff in the room of requirement,” Ron said. “I would have just left your cloak and map under Dean’s bed, but I wasn’t sure if they’d also check Dean and Seamus’ stuff.”
“It was fine,” Harry replied as his hands clenched his shirt. He wanted to put it on, especially as Burke’s eyes focused on Harry’s tattoo. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t trust Burke enough to have his vision obscured even for a few seconds.
“But you asked someone for help?” asked the wizard from earlier.
“That can’t be legal,” Harry stated slowly. He was beginning to wonder if the death eaters were just trying to mess with him in any way that they could.
“If two sad sacks like Lucius and I could get the gorgeous Black sisters to agree to marry us, I’m sure you’ll do just fine,” encouraged Lestrange. Lucius rolled his eyes but didn’t bother addressing the insult. From Lucius’ stories, Harry knew the man felt blessed to have Narcissa as a wife.
“Surely there must be some consequences,” Harry said as he fretted over how long the guards were likely to leave Albert in pain. It was becoming increasingly clear that the prisoners couldn’t do much, but surely their judicial-wizards could step in. “Perhaps Mr. Hale could do something?” he asked.
“What you’re trying to accomplish… it won’t be easy,” Hale warned.
Burke and another guard walked over to Harry cell. For a brief moment, Harry thought that perhaps Dumbledore had done it and Harry was free. But one look at Burke’s smiling face let Harry know that wasn’t the case.
“I understand if you don’t feel comfortable coming to me as I’ve obviously failed you in my duties as your Head of House. I’ll always be willing to listen should you want to talk. I hope...” McGonagall paused briefly before she pressed on. “I ask that you consider the possibility of a mind healer-”
, Draco,” Harry stressed. “As in more than one!”
Harry huffed and marveled at how surprisingly comfortable he was surrounded by Slytherins. Given their history, it was probably even more surprising than realizing he enjoyed the company of a bunch of Death Eaters. Harry was just about to sit back down next to Draco, when Theo came out of the classroom.
“I think I figured out how to connect two mirrors if they were side-by-side, but it doesn’t work with one mirror being so far away,” Harry explained.
“Because, I don’t know if I can trust you,” Harry said honestly. The insulted look on Parkinson’s face would have been comical if Harry didn’t think she was about to curse him. Zabini started laughing, which fortunately redirected Parkinson’s glare towards him.
“I thought McGonagall was going to curse that one man,” Ron laughed. “She was so angry.”
“What, no brave comeback?” prompted Burke. When Harry didn’t respond, he tried a different tactic. “Did you sleep well?”
“This time,” muttered Snape.
The tension between the two of them was broken by one of the guards calling out to Burke from the end of the hall. They had finished handing out the meals on this floor and were ready to move on. Burke frowned in their direction, clearly unwilling to leave.
“She wasn’t exactly sorry either!” Harry retorted, glad that his anger was pushing down his despair. “She ran out of the ministry bloody
Malfoy and Mulciber were running through a list of spells. When one of the Lestrange brothers jumped in to suggest some sort of anti-clotting spell, Lucius snidely remarked that it was rather advanced and thus not likely to be part of the sixth-year curriculum. Harry realized they were planning more spells to review with him. It brought tears to his eyes again, though this time for a happier reason.
“Albert, yours works a little differently. I used ‘Thea’ as the password to enlarge and shrink the box, but you can set a second password that would lock and unlock the box,” Harry explained.  Thea was the name of his late wife. Harry had almost set ‘Theodore’ as the lock/unlock password, but figured it would be better if the man choose his own password for what was essentially a small safety deposit box.
“No,” Burke muttered, annoyed with Harry’s constant talkback. “Tell me how it works. Which motherly type is attractive? Someone to coddle you? Or, do you like it when they nag you? Is that why you cursed Lestrange? Did she remind you of mummy? Hoped she’d spank her naughty boy for using spells he shouldn’t know? I bet you would have loved-”
” the dementor admitted. “
,” Harry insisted. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to bribe a healer to say Harry was unfit for school just so Snape could get Harry kicked out like he’s always wanted.
“Is he really?” asked a second man on the boat. He was staring at Harry’s forehead. Given the limited light on the boat, he couldn’t make out the scar.
Harry didn’t know what expression he was making, but he was sure it wasn’t flattering. He was uncomfortable and embarrassed, but that was probably what Hale was aiming for. After a few shots of Harry’s tattoo, he asked to see Harry’s hand. He took a few pictures of the scar. Normally Azkaban’s low lighting would have made the scar hard to see, but Hale had brought his own light. As the man was not allowed to bring in his wand, he brought in an orb that glowed. It looked a little like a lightbulb.
“Oh, I’ll leave. Since I can do that. I can leave whenever I want. I’m a free man, unlike you who isn’t getting out of here. Ever,” Burke remarked as he left his spot near Harry’s cell and joined his coworkers. Harry stewed in his anger as he listened to Burke’s footsteps move down the hall. Harry stared blankly at where Burke had stood, imagining what could have happened if he’d been able to do wandless magic. It was only when the hallway door closed behind the guards that Harry snapped out of it.
“What do you mean? I never tried to get your attention. Before this,” Harry waved his hand between them in a vague manner that was meant to encompass his whole Azkaban experience, “I would have been quite happy to never come across one of you again. No offense.”
“I feel like a prat,” Harry complained as he brought the food to his mouth and tried to chew “delicately”.
Once Hale was done taking pictures, he called in a guard to heal Albert. Harry once again removed each illusion one at a time. Harry relied on where the guard pointed his wand, as he could not feel what areas the magic was attempting to heal.
“Look, I really don’t want to talk about Burke,” Harry said tensely. He didn’t want Burke to take up any more space in his life. It was bad enough that he couldn’t get away from the heavy and hot feeling of the man’s soul. “Whatever Hale said about him, was probably true. Assuming the papers didn’t bungle it up, that is...”
Harry once again felt conflicted. It was fundamentally wrong to use up someone’s soul, but Harry felt like he couldn’t avoid it at this point. Even if he could stomach giving up magic, there would be no guarantee that the deterioration of Burke’s soul would stop.
“It’s prison, Potter, not a five-star resort,” Scrimegeour stated blandly.
“I meant on the Azkaban end. Won’t hurt to know how it’s theoretically possible,” Theo said.
word, not just bodily but magically as well. An unseen force pushed out from his chest and when it reached Burke, it toppled the body on to its side. Burke’s arse was now facing the guards, but his vacant gaze was pointed towards Harry more clearly than ever. Fortunately, the man’s crotch was still somewhat facing downward. Harry hated seeing what was left of the man, but he did take his first deep breath since taking Burke’s soul. He clung to the knowledge that Burke couldn’t hurt him anymore.
“Draco didn’t tell you?” asked Harry.
“How are you doing this?” asked Lucius. Harry launched into an explanation of how he managed to create a new mirror and connect the two. He worried that Albert would be upset about the risk Theo took to help, but Harry wanted to give credit where it was due. Fortunately, Albert was far too impressed to be upset.
(See the end of the chapter for
Burked hummed in satisfaction and drew his wand away. With horror, Harry realized it was the first rune in his prison number.
Burke calmed down somewhat once he realized his threats were working. His face wasn’t as red with anger as it had been just moments ago.
As Lucius and Nott were the only prisoners he’d seen during the last few days, Harry felt the most comfortable around them – even naked. He couldn’t help but observe that both men still looked relatively healthy. Lucius wasn’t sporting a six-pack, but his chest was surprisingly toned. Harry tried not to dwell on it as it felt icky to notice that about Draco’s father. Though Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Draco was similarly built.
Draco strove to find a way to settle the matter. For him it honestly didn’t matter if James was Harry’s son, carrying his horcrux, or was the other half of Harry’s soul. Either way, Draco loved them both. But it weighed on Harry. So, Draco continued his research and tried to develop a plan for all of the possible outcomes. He was nervous when, after years of research, he thought he finally had a way to answer it.
Harry was silent and only Malfoy and Nott were able to see him shift in a guilty manner.
“The boy has a point,” Lucius stepped in. “You’re under as much scrutiny as the ministry. You should consider how this will blowback on you.”
“Do you think they’ll actually listen?” asked Harry. Scrimgeour hadn’t been keen when Harry suggested similar measures for the ministry itself. It seemed unlikely he’d like it any better for the prison.
Hale’s eyes trailed over Harry’s shoulder and the man frowned at something back at the castle. Harry turned expecting to see Snape hovering nearby. Instead it was Draco and Nott standing near Hogwarts’ front steps, doing little to hide the fact they were watching Harry and Hale.
Perhaps, if he’d never found his mother’s ring, and if he’d never had to run from some snatchers, the idea of creating his own horcrux would have remained just that. An idea. A crazy, desperate thought that rattled around his brain. Never spoken aloud. Never followed through.
“What?” Harry asked in alarm. He glanced at Mrs. Malfoy, but she also gave him an expectant look. Harry’s stomach twisted to realize that he’d somehow gained the woman’s approval to date her son, but he couldn’t act on it.
“It’s important that you look like a respectable young wizard today,” Hale insisted. To emphasize this point, Hale pulled out a jar of hair gel from his own robes. “I hope you don’t mind, but we should really tame that rather atrocious hair of yours,” Hale’s tone was kinder than his words. Harry let the man style his hair despite not having a mirror where he could check out the results. By this point in their relationship, he trusted the man to make him look better rather than worse.
“Potter twinks he can fwight de big scawry death eaters? Twinks he can-”
“Sadly, you’re looking as atrocious as ever,” Harry teased fondly as the classroom door closed behind him.
“If I tell you... er, I’d have to tell you about something that could get him, and others, in trouble,” Harry said. It was the brief flash of concern on Nott’s face before he managed to hide it behind his usual stoic façade that convinced Harry. Nott wouldn’t purposely hurt his father.
“Not as far as I can tell,” Harry stated. While he though the news would make Nott feel relieved, Harry remembered that they were surrounded by other death eaters. Not helping in a task set by Voldemort might actually backfire later on. “I think Malf, er,
“Harry, I don’t think you fully appreciate how remarkable that is,” Albert stated.
“Go to bed,” Harry suggested to the tired death eaters. As usual it was a struggle to convince them, but Harry argued that they could help him more if they were fully rested. Or as rested as Azkaban would allow. Harry wished that he was able to sleep, but he hadn’t felt
Hale agreed to take the memory at the end of their meeting. He would review it and determine if it was worth entering as evidence for Albert’s trial.
“I awoke to the sounds of a struggle. When I sat up, I saw Burke attempting to- well, we’ve already established the vile act that bastard intended,” Lucius said judgmentally.
“Well, you’ll just have to practice,” the man concluded.
“It seems to be disintegrating,” Ishanders told Harry. He meant it as encouragement, but Harry felt the heavy weight of guilt settle in him.
“Albert Nott volunteered his testimony as he was deeply concerned about the guards’ treatment towards a sixteen-year-old boy. One who is the same age as his own son. Would you not do the same?” Hale said, as he shamelessly used emotional manipulation to cut down their arguments. “Lucius Malfoy could have corroborated their story had the court given me permission to interview him,” Hale added.
“Oh,” Harry answered. If they could prove it, then Harry wasn’t sure how he was ever getting out of the prison.
“Ursula is too. Only one out of three children in Slytherin,” Hale bemoaned, “my wife won that contest.”
“Pansy, it’s fine,” Draco said and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.
Lucius and Draco. Albert, and now Nott. Harry wants to collect them all! Harry’s Home for Wayward Slytherins.
memories.”
“I have no proof,” Harry stated cautiously aware that none of his friends had believed him, “but I think Malfoy – er, Draco – I think that Draco was given some sort of task from Voldemort.”
What surprised him even more, though it probably shouldn’t by this point, was their continued support even after all that they saw. After witnessing Harry purposely touch Quirrell knowing it would burn the man, Albert merely told him to never be ashamed of fighting for his life. Lucius even apologized after witnessing himself through the eyes of a scared twelve-year-old.
“Even if I had enough power to summon her, I’d rather not,” Harry replied.
Harry was led towards the chair with magical chains. Along the way, he caught sight of Dumbledore sitting in the first row. He wasn’t directly behind the chair Harry was to sit at, but he was close. Noting Harry’s attention, the older wizard smiled encouragingly and nodded at Harry in recognition. Harry was surprised that he felt comforted by the headmaster’s presence given he’d felt forsaken by him since his stay in Azkaban. Still, Harry couldn’t manage to return the smile because he was all too aware that this time Harry was the one avoiding all eye contact with the older wizard.
“He has done well in all of his classes today. You heard Filius at dinner. The man was praising Mr. Potter’s resilience,” McGonagall interfered before Harry and Snape could start bickering. Harry wondered if Flitwick had actually been that complimentary or if McGonagall was playing it up for Harry’s benefit now.
Burke’s hand trailed further down but his own body was blocking his access. Keeping a tight hold on Harry’s hair, the man slid down Harry’s body. He brought his hand to the hem of Harry’s shirt and lifted it up. Harry shivered as chest was exposed, and he knew it had more to do with Burke’s cold gaze than Azkaban’s cold atmosphere. Burke’s hand was firm as it moved up Harry’s chest, and just as unforgiving as it pinched his nipple.
The witches and wizards that had wanted to condemn Harry gained some support from other wizengamot members who were less willing to part with ministry funds than they were with parting from a prisoner that had gained too much media attention. But Hale never faltered and countered all objections they put forth. Harry found he was able to enjoy Hale’s wit more now that he’d been pardoned. Harry tried to maintain an innocent expression and the good posture Lucius had instilled in him. He didn’t care about compensation beyond giving Scrimgeour, Runecraft, and the rest a final fuck you.
Just as they settled down and Malfoy was getting ready to teach Harry a new charm, they heard the door at the end of the hall open again. Harry’s mood immediately plummeted. He hadn’t realized how successful the spell review was at uplifting his mood until then.
Harry had a hard time falling asleep that night. He alternated between hoping that Dumbledore would suddenly appear to release him, and dreading that the suddenly talkative dementor would come back. Neither happened and Harry eventually succumbed to sleep.
“But why?” asked Ron. “I don’t want to encourage you date the ferret if you’re not into him... but it’s pretty clear you are, mate. And it’s pretty obvious he wants you too.”
“Draco, I can’t lose you too,” Harry said. When Draco reached out for his hand, he clasped it desperately.
“No,” said Albert immediately. “We can’t trust the others to keep this a secret. Avery and Lestrange will just have to deal with huddling at the edge of their cells.”
smudge your copy with lube, don’t expect me to replace it,” Harry threw back and was satisfied when Lestrange laughed uproariously.
“That’s different though. No, really. What you did when you were a Death Eater... that was forced upon you. You never cast a curse unless they forced your hand. You didn’t eagerly participate in any of his schemes,” Harry pointed. He felt Draco exhale against his chest.
“Er, there was a dragon egg...” Harry wondered how he could explain without mentioning Hagrid. He wasn’t sure if Hagrid could still get in trouble after all these years, but he didn’t want to chance it. Luckily, he didn’t have to elaborate since the hall door swung open and a guard called out “Nott, your judicial-wizard is here.”
“I want to. Besides, you know I love a good challenge,” Draco smirked.
With even more assignments by the end of the day, Harry planned spend another night in the library. Ron bemoaned wasting a Friday night on homework, but his pity at the pile of work Harry had collected meant that Ron didn’t try to distract Harry with a more amusing way to spend the evening.
“What did you do?” asked the Lestrange brother in the cell next to him.
He didn’t know how much time he wasted idle in bed, but eventually he forced himself to get up. He needed a distraction from his own dark thoughts and unfortunately his failure to sleep only added to the negativity swirling in his mind. In Azkaban he’d used magic and made trinkets as a distraction. If sleep wouldn’t give him the escape he craved, perhaps magic would. At the least, he knew he’d feel better if he managed to do something productive.
. You know what I’ve done. That it made me... half a person at best.”
When Harry sat in the chair, the magical chains swung up and encircled him. It was decidedly uncomfortable, but Hale’s presence at his side prevented Harry from having a panic attack.
“To be honest, I don’t think they want you back,” Draco said. When Harry flinched at the news, he amended, “they’re all understanding about why you’re sloshed. They just want to spare the kids from seeing it.”
“Draco, you’re babbling,” Harry cut in. He’d been able to follow Draco’s rushed explanation, but felt he should interrupt. His husband didn’t usually get flustered; not unless Harry did something to either anger, embarrass, or arouse him. So, seeing Draco nervously info dump everything on him made him uneasy.
She gave him a recap of the final battle. It turned out that Neville was the hero in the end, killing Nagini and then Voldemort at Ron and Hermione’s insistence. When they recovered Harry’s body, they were pleasantly surprised to learn he hadn’t died. Unfortunately, no one could figure out what was wrong with him. The medi-witch briefly tumbled into an explanation of the various tests and spells they tried. While it worried Harry, his immediate concern was finding out what happened to his friends.
Nott lent Harry his book on blood magic, and a second one he’d borrowed from a housemate. Harry expressed concern about someone else knowing they – or at least Nott – were suddenly interested in blood magic. Nott reassured Harry that he didn’t tell them why he wanted to borrow their book, and he certainly never mentioned Harry’s name when he asked.
“I would if you’d bothered to show Potter his place,” responded Jugson. “What would the dark lord say if he knew you were passing up an opportunity to-”
“Can any of you actually cast healing charms?” Hale asked the guards waiting outside the room. There was a moment of silence as they seemed to realize the trap Hale was setting. If they admitted to knowing the spells, then they let two prisoners suffer unnecessarily. If none of them could perform the spells, Hale would use it as another example of the ministry’s incompetence.
“We do not share our food, even with our children,” Asherath explained.
“It sounded interesting enough, that I now regret not taking it in third year,” Harry said. Of course, Trelawney had made him regret that decision in every class, long before he started learning about runes.
“Potter... thanks,” Crabbe said and held his hand out towards Harry. Harry grasped it expecting Crabbe to offer a simple handshake, but Crabbe used his hold to drag Harry to his feet. Once he was standing, Crabbe enveloped him in a hug.
“Well... that was easy,” Draco said with a smile.
“They’re not dead,” Andromeda told him, “they’re in Azkaban.”
"Be glad he can't dress you like a proper young wizard, because you’d look like a prat too," teased Mulciber.
“Yeah, you do,” Harry snorted. “A bit like B.O., but still... Ron-y.”
“I won’t tell anyone,” Nott said. Harry wasn’t sure if that was true, as he could see Nott wanting to tell his roommates. Though it did seem unlikely he would spread it beyond them. Harry wasn’t sure how trustworthy they all were, but Draco and Crabbe would likely reign in Zabini and Goyle if need be.
Given they just finished lunch, Harry assumed whoever was walking the halls didn’t have a benign reason for being there. And since he heard foot steps, he knew it was men and not dementors. Harry braced himself for another visit from Burke.
“Still, do you not also want genetic children?” Lucius asked.
“I...” Draco’s eyes teared up, and Harry panicked. He didn’t know why he always screwed things up so badly he made the people he fancied cry.
“Harry?” prompted Bones. The court was quiet. Too quiet.
“Wiblin,” Burke gestured to the other guard to open the door. Wiblin waved his wand and the door swung open.
Seeing the auror’s wand pointed directly at his chest reminded Harry that he didn’t have his wand on him. He had a terrible of vision of Umbridge gleefully breaking it as soon as they arrived at the ministry. Logically he knew they weren’t supposed to break anyone’s wand until the guilty verdict was announced, but given his past experiences with the ministry, Harry didn’t feel overly confident that they would follow protocol and wait.
“I- what do you want to do next, then?” Harry asked.
Harry had been dutifully reciting Crabbe’s message a second time to ensure he had it all, when Albert cut in.
Hale called in the guard to observe as he collected Harry’s memory.
“Asherath showed me how,” Harry said. He thought back on the dementor's (in)actions and wondered if it had been another weird test of theirs. “I think he wanted me to do it. Maybe to see if a human could?”
As the guards handcuffed Harry, Hale asked them to send Albert down to meet with him. “I’m not taking the chance that the ministry will continue to pull this random form bullshit with all of my cases,” Hale explained.
“Potter... it would have to be really terrible for you to lose me,” Draco tried to reassure him.
“Why do you think that?” asked Hale before the wizengamot could react.
“Vengeful little fucker,” snorted Mulciber amused. He sobered quickly as he recalled exactly who Harry had been stabbing.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry responded.
“It was a good distraction,” Harry said. There was no need to say exactly how much time went into it.
Conversations eventually tapered off, but Harry felt more relaxed than previously. He couldn’t say Azkaban was pleasant, but he thought he could survive it until Dumbledore got him out. Harry still hoped it would be soon. As nice as the death eaters were being - and boy did Harry think that was a weird thought – he would rather be back at Hogwarts and know that his friends weren’t in trouble for helping him at the ministry.
“I propose a trade. Apparently, my father was teaching you introductory Alchemy. I can help you continue your studies. In turn, you can help me with Defense,” Nott proposed.
“What do you talk about?” Draco asked. It was hard to imagine the dreary prison inspiring many interesting conversation topics.
“What did you tell him?” asked Draco. He sounded nervous. Harry faltered, not sure if the answer would upset Draco or not.
“Come see me after today’s classes. We’ll review the rest and decide on a plan for how you’ll catch up with the missed assignments,” McGonagall said. Harry wasn’t thrilled imagining the amount of assignments he’d likely have by the end of the day from all of his professors.
Tired of the scrutiny, Harry decided to skip his afternoon classes. The pitying looks from his classmates were hard deal with, but he knew it would be nothing compared to whatever Snape had in store for him. Harry didn’t have the energy to deal with it even if it gave Snape more time to think up ways to humiliate Harry when he inevitable had to go back to class.
The grim looks on Malfoy and Nott’s faces did not comfort Harry.
“You do realize we’re still human beings, don’t you?” Harry responded.
“Fart-knocker,” howled Mulciber, while the Lestrange brothers giggled. “I have to use that some time.”
. It’s terrible, Draco. So, so bad,” Harry said. Draco was quiet for a few minutes as he contemplated it. Since their friendship started, Draco had known there was something weighing on Harry. Something beyond Ginny dying in childbirth. He figured the other man had hurt, or possibly killed someone during the war and was prepared to talk him out of the self-hatred Harry had developed as a consequence. But he started to suspect it might be more complicated than that. He took Harry’s drunken words seriously and debated if it was possible for Harry’s secret to truly drive him away.
“She’s totally going to be a judicial-witch,” said Ron to Harry.
“They’ll ask one of the guards with some healing knowledge, or just use a potion,” Lucius explained.
“I’ll handle them,” Hale offered when he saw Harry nervously eyeing the reporters.
“It was strong enough to drown you?” Draco asked in surprise. Though he was confused about how an inanimate object could drown someone.
“Who?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help but wonder if his friends had been interviewed and if so, what they said.
Eventually the men around him start conversing. The murmur of it reached Harry though he only caught snippets of their conversations.
Harry tried not to respond, not wanting to give the man the satisfaction of knowing he was scaring him. But his resolve crumbled when Burke started tugging his shirt collar away from Harry’s neck.
“It’s not though, is it? I mean the Malfoys...” Harry said, but trailed off at her confused look. “Oh, did they die in the battle too? I hadn’t heard. The last I saw of Malfoy, er, Draco, he was alive, but...”
“He won’t thank you for it,” Harry grumbled. Parkinson ignored him and walked towards the classroom. “Fine. He’s... talking to his dad.”
“Transfiguration? I can’t imagine professor McGonagall was too pleased,” Harry speculated.
“I don’t know. I didn’t mean to. I think it just... she was wearing the ring when we, er, made James. It must have... moved somehow,” Harry said.
“Alright,” Harry said despite his doubts. He had no alternative suggestion, so decided to go with their plan.
Harry laid still, stared at the ceiling, and desperately tried to think about anything but recent events. When he was reasonably sure that Albert and Lucius were asleep, he quietly got out of bed and sat in the middle of his cell. Silently he levitated a nearby pebble. Likely it was a chipped piece of Azkaban’s crumbling walls.
“He’s got you there,” Malfoy said with some amusement.
“Sure,” Draco said. He kept his tone light even though he felt apprehensive.
“Charms, transfiguration,” Harry said. “They tried to cover the Hogwarts curriculum that I was missing by being there. They might have been completely off base, but I still learned loads of useful spells.”
“He should be so lucky as to have us all hug him,” Parkinson added.
“Professor Flitwick was the same for me,” Neville added. “I think I only answered two questions during the whole interview. Professor Flitwick interrupted the rest.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, then remembered that Hale had told him Hermione kept mailing him muggle court cases and theory. “Reginald Hale is impressed with you. Thinks you should go into law,” Harry said with a smile.
“I’m not,” Harry said with an eyeroll. “You did a good chunk of the work.”
Harry thought that Auror Perkins seemed inclined to agree with Dumbledore but that could be wishful thinking. Mr. Runecraft, on the other hand, was clearly annoyed at the interruption.
line,” he explained and handed Harry something that looked like a muggle hockey puck.
“Not the things that truly count,” Draco reassured firmly. As friendly as he and Draco had become, he wasn’t used to the other man so blatantly complimenting him. He found he rather liked it and hoped Draco meant what he said.
“Not even for Umbridge?” asked Ron. At Harry’s surprise, he elaborated, “people are saying she’ll likely be arrested for what she did last year.”
“She wasn’t. She obliterated Slytherin’s chance to win the house cup that year,” Malfoy complained.
With reluctance, Harry removed his shirt and placed it in the hamper. As he did, a very naked Mulciber tossed in his pants and winked at Harry. Harry tried not to notice exactly how much hair was on the man (it was a lot). It helped when he removed his glasses and placed them on a nearby bench. He hoped Burke didn’t break them.
Hermione inhaled sharply causing Harry to instinctively step in front of her protectively despite knowing on some level that she was likely better equipped to handle this situation than he was. He could barely process what was happening.
“So long as you don’t keep doing so in public places – ministry property, no less, you should be able to practice with relative ease,” stated Nott. Harry gave him an incredulous look.
“You truly don’t know?” questioned Asherath.
“Ron was a mess. George too. I’m pretty sure Mr. Weasley wasn’t holding up as well as he pretended to,” Hermione offered.
Harry frowned. It wasn’t the reprimand that he’d expected, but it felt like one all the same.
Harry thought he did a good job of alleviating any concerns Snape might have put in their heads. He made sure to arrive on time, he handed in all of his assignments, and he answered at least one question in each class. Only McGonagall and Snape seemed to spend an excessive amount of time observing him. At least McGonagall wasn’t sneering at him while she watched him successfully demonstrate each spell. Snape hovered around him and appeared disappointed that Harry managed to complete all his missed assignments on time, but thankfully he didn’t try to touch Harry. Harry had made sure his stance was near perfect to avoid it. The only time Snape’s attention wasn’t on him was when another student asked for his help. Harry was exceedingly grateful when Nott called over the dour professor, and even the other Slytherin boys kept the man occupied for the majority of the class time.
“Er, fine,” Harry said. Even though Albert’s face was squished against the wall, and only half of it was visible to Harry, he still caught the man’s unimpressed look. “I mean... it’s in the paper, so I’m kind of... hiding in a random classroom.”
Everyone grew quiet again, but this time it seemed less tense than before. Harry glanced around his cell as he reflected on what Malfoy had said. The cell was more spacious than Harry had pictured when Sirius spoke about Azkaban. Of course, that hadn’t been too often as the man did not want reminders of his time there. Harry wondered if he was in Sirius’ old cell. Knowing his luck, he was probably in Crouch Jr.’s old cell.
“Being a death eater isn’t a good reason,” Draco responded.
Hale probably wanted him to say some outrageously large sum of money, but that wasn’t what Harry needed. “I’d like there to be a throughout investigation into Azkaban. By an
“It won’t be for long, and it won’t look good for the ministry,” Hale reassured him. “Look towards the right. The press has been allowed access to your trial, and you can be certain this has been noted.”
Using the floo almost made Harry sick up again. He didn’t, but his stomach didn’t settle for a long time. He distantly heard Draco order a house elf to prepare a guestroom. He let Draco support him once more as they made their way up Malfoy Manor’s elegant staircase.
They asked him a few more questions about Azkaban, and Harry dutifully answered until they started to broach the subject of Burke.
“Er, thanks?” Harry responded.
“Brilliant!” Harry said. It wouldn’t have helped him escape Azkaban, not unless he wanted to risk swimming in turbulent waters. At the most it would have let him join Crabbe or Lestrange in their cells. Still, he thought it was a genius invention.
... should I ask Madame Pomphrey to join us?” Dumbledore asked.
“Just meant that before I met you, I would have assumed you’d be a spoiled brat too. You know, being the saviour and all,” Mulciber explained. “That spoiled cousin of yours – he the one you live with?”
“Are you up for delivering a letter?” Harry asked her. She was reluctant to leave him so soon, but dutifully offered her leg so Harry could tie a letter to it. He only gave her Albert’s letter to Hale. He didn’t know if he trusted the families of the other prisoners to not hurt her. He didn’t think they would – except maybe Bellatrix – but he didn’t want to risk it. Too many people knew what his owl looked like, and none of the family members of the Death Eaters knew of Harry’s friendship with them.
“Dangerous, you mean,” Hermione said with disapproval. “So much can go wrong. What if it damages the structural integrity of the wall?”
When James’ birthday came around, Harry practically begged Draco to go with him. As much as he genuinely enjoyed Draco’s company these days, he asked for more selfish reasons. He needed the support. And frankly he hoped that the others would be put off my Malfoy’s presence enough to avoid sensitive subjects, or even just avoid their presence in general.
“OK,” Harry said as he wiped at his eyes to remove the tears that were threatening to fall. “Research. I can do research before reaching for a basilisk fang,” Harry clung to the hope that this wasn’t necessarily a death sentence.
Harry felt he would be fine in most subjects, but it wasn’t the time or place to get into that discussion again. Still, he was curious to compare notes with Hermione to see how close they managed to get to the curriculum. Even if the prisoners hadn’t been correct about the content itself, Harry was confident the theoretical background they gave him would help him catch up quickly.
Another uneasy silence descended. Draco and Zabini looked at each other and made subtle gestures. Harry feared they were trying to decide which of them was going to ask him about the Dursleys. Fortunately, before either of them could, Theo came running around the corner. A second later, he was followed by Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle.
Neither Mulciber, Crabbe, nor Avery were animagi so there was a slight debate on what the sixth side of the box should be. Crabbe had suggested a bowtruckle, but Avery thought a kelpie would look cooler.
“Speaking from experience?” countered Harry.
“Draco,” Parkinson said with reproach. She leaned in and whispered to Draco, though both Harry and Zabini could still hear “you remember that comment he made to Goy-, I mean Wren. Do you really think you should be alone with him?”
“I was angry at the time. Maybe that’s why it worked?” Harry proposed. He didn’t want to think about being a natural at such a dark curse.
“But that’s...” Harry thought it was ridiculous that the ministry would hire people who weren’t prepared for even simple injuries. “What if they’re the ones that are injured?”
As the others continued to tease Lestrange, Harry noted that Malfoy seemed to be calming down. He did not join in the conversation, but he no longer seemed to be breaking down. Harry thought he understood why Lestrange and Nott had started the conversation, but Harry probably would have preferred if someone had first acknowledged how crappy everything was. Still, Harry started talking about the recent matches he’s read about in the papers. He even spoke about the recent Hogwarts quidditch games, though he skipped over his own recent injury.
“Would it be fair to say Bellatrix Lestrange’s orders were aggressive and without consideration for the damage she caused to those around her?” asked Hale.
“What did they do?” asked Hale when Harry stalled for too long. Harry glanced nervously at Hale, but the man did not seem upset that Harry was saying something they hadn’t previously discussed. He hoped Hale saw where Harry was going, and knew Harry had the best intentions for Albert. But that didn't make it any easier for Harry to actually say it.
By the time they are finished, the transcript for the interview ends up being extensive. Harry also noticed that Hale was carrying various official looking forms. He figured that Hale would be able to hide Lucius’ letter within the rest of the papers.
“You’ll get caught,” Lestrange finished Harry’s thought.
“Leave,” Burke insisted again, but he was watching Harry’s horror-struck face instead of the dementor. He lay atop the boy to keep him pinned down. The hand that wasn’t holding Harry’s wrist was pressing Harry’s face to the cot so that Burke had free range to access Harry’s tattoo. Harry shivered as Burke leaned down and licked it. A second later the man moved his mouth a few inches over and harshly bit down. Harry screamed and tried to pull the man off with his free hand, but once again was unsuccessful.
“The wall was a fluke. I was surprised. It won’t happen again,” Harry added.
“Just curious,” Harry said.
“Could you not be vile for five minutes?” sneered Lucius.
“It wasn’t the only time we were almost caught... I keep thinking... I know our chances aren’t good. I know I could die,” Harry said. Ginny inhaled sharply, but Harry continued before she said anything in response to that. “I don’t plan to make it easy for them, but I know I could die. I just need... I need to take him with me, you know? I need to make sure that everyone else is okay first.”
her; wishing to have both my sisters back in my life. How foolish that seems now. The fancy of a lonely child...”
“Did that scumbag really not put his cock in you?” Mulciber asked angrily. He realized how harsh he sounded and tried to tone it down for Harry. “If he hurt you, er ripped you then we will demand those fucking guards heal you.”
“James can stay with me for the night,” she offered. He probably should have felt ashamed of being such an incompetent dad, but in that moment, he could only feel relief.
“Meals seem to be about the only creature comfort they consistently provide,” Malfoy stated. He placed his now empty food tray in the slot where it had entered and then tapped the bar directly above it. It vanished.
“Wait – did you or did you not cast the cruciatus curse?” asked the voice Harry now knew to be Mulciber.
that he compromised the school’s foundation. There are still cracks where Potter caused the most damage,” snapped Snape.
common room? Where you were headed anyway?” asked Harry.
Hale asked about the other guards’ actions once they discovered what happened. Harry briefly contemplated offering that memory to Hale. When he recalled that he was naked from the waist down for part of it, Harry decided against it. He didn’t want anyone in the ministry to see him like that.
“About every two to three days if we’re lucky,” grumbled Malfoy.
“Where’s Draco?” Parkinson asked.
“You know it won’t be completely private, right? I mean on the other end,” Harry stated. The prisoners could talk softly, but it was likely their neighbours would still hear parts of the conversation.
and wouldn’t be able to retain all the information. When Harry expressed these concerns, Lucius decided that they would hold random pop quizzes. Thus far, the men were pleased that Harry was remembering a good portion of the lessons. On the rare occasion that he got stuck, someone would jump in to review the parts that gave him trouble. By the end of his third full day of lesson, Harry was itching for his wand. He hadn’t been this excited about magic since he’d learnt he was a wizard.
“What’s wrong with your hand?” asked Nott, seemingly out of the blue. Harry blinked at him uncomprehendingly. “You told Scrimgeour it was a sign of the ministry’s corruption.”
“Good work, Reginald, as always,” Dumbledore said to Hale. He nodded politely to Perkins before focusing all his attention on Harry. “Harry, my boy, it is good to see you at last,” Dumbledore said warmly. Harry wanted to point out that Dumbledore had plenty of opportunity to see him when he was first sent to Azkaban, but he bit back the retort.
“Right,” Wiblin nodded and once again stepped closer to Harry. Harry immediately repeated his harsh “don’t”, which fortunately made Wiblin pause.
"That's a stretch, even for you," snorted Harry.
“He hasn’t received his trial yet,” added Perkins. “He’s to wait here until then.”
“What the fuck happened?” the man asked. The other guards shifted uncomfortably before turning one by one to look at Harry. In response, Harry’s breathing once again grew laboured. Wiblin, the man closest to the door, stepped forward.
As anticipated, classes the next day were much the same. The professors wanted reassurance that Harry would be able to catch up with the rest of the class. McGonagall or Snape must have relayed the conversation they had in Dumbledore’s office since Harry felt their attention on him. Not wanting to give them an excuse, Harry stuck to his initial plan but didn’t pretend to struggle as much as he’d originally intended. He’d hoped this would alleviate any concerns, but several professors cautioned him not to overextend himself. Harry felt like he was doomed whether he performed well or poorly.
“But I won’t be able to practice,” Harry insisted. “I’m better at remembering if I can feel the spell, you know?”
Harry looked to Lucius even though he wasn’t sure what he expected the man to do. Burke clearly wouldn’t listen to reason. They had no other recourse. Harry flinched when the door at the end of the hall opened and closed again.
“What if...”
Harry burnt what remained of the body, and then his clothes. When Hermione joined him back at the spot of their last campground, he didn’t tell her what he did. If she thought he looked horrible, she had so many other reasons to choose from to explain why. She herself did not look good after that close call either.
“Some,” said the man defensively. Rather than argue, Malfoy just agreed that it could be added to the plans. None of the men suggested divination, which suited Harry just fine. They also did not suggest muggle studies, but Harry figured he knew more about that than any of them. Perhaps he’d offer to teach it to
“Think you can make this water warm?” asked Albert as he washed his hands after his morning piss. “Cheers,” he said almost immediately after, which informed the others that Harry had once again performed magic soundlessly and wandlessly.
“It’s not going to help you, Potter,” Burke mocked as he refocused on Harry. Fortunately, he no longer wanted to strangle Harry to death, but unfortunately his hands resumed their exploration of Harry’s chest. Harry tried to push him away but barely had much strength after their last struggle. He couldn’t stop Burke from pressing his hips to the bed as the man leaned down to lick at Harry’s chest. He tried. He pushed at Burke’s head and mumbled “no, off” but the man ignored him. Burke even tried to ignore the lingering dementor, but its presence was usually enough to kill anyone’s boner.
They were quiet as they all observed the baby. None of them could point to any physical sign of Ginny, and it did make them sad.
There had also been a smaller article that mentioned Harry had been called to testify in Albert’s trial. Naturally Hermione had seen it and brought it to Ron and Neville’s attention. Having no choice but to address it, Harry confirmed it as he got a letter from Hale that morning telling him he would be needed at the ministry tomorrow.
Several snatchers happened upon them on one of their rare ventures back to civilization. Later Harry would learn he’d led the snatchers to them by saying Voldemort’s name, but they assumed it was merely bad luck when it happened. They’d been unprepared, and were forced to split up to make it harder for the snatchers. Harry managed to shake all but one. He’d apparated away once he was clear of the muggle population, but the snatcher had grabbed him at the last second. Harry pushed the man away when they landed in the forest. He readied himself to run again but stopped at the sight of blood. Lots of blood. The man had splinched himself so badly, he had difficulty breathing. He couldn’t raise his wand to heal himself, let alone stop Harry from kicking it out of reach.
The dementors made a particularly loud rattling sound. Harry was struck with a fear that they would attempt to suck his soul out despite the distance between them and wished he’d learn to keep his mouth shut. However, two of the dementors turned their attention to the third.
“I’ll protect Draco’s virtue while you’re gone,” Zabini offered with a grin. Parkinson looked like she wanted to send Zabini to fetch Theo instead, but she eventually gave in.
“Not even if you’re sick, or...” Harry scrambled to think of another reason, “or to feed your young?” Harry knew it was extremely unlikely that the dementors fed their children like birds fed their chicks, but he was desperate. Both dementors made loud rattling sounds. It took Harry a moment, but he realized it was a dementor’s version of a laugh.
Hermione gave him updates on their classes the whole way to the library. She once again expressed her worry about Harry being able to catch up in time for exams.
McGonagall informed him that she would be the one to take him to the ministry. It left him worried about what she would think about his testimony, but he couldn’t do anything about it.
“What did you tell them?” Harry asked Theo.
“You do lose the moral high ground when you condone the treatment Harry was subjected to while in Azkaban. Treatment that is ongoing for the prisoners that are legally detained there,” Hale added in support of Harry.
“There won’t be trouble. That’s the point. The guards won’t stop me from beating the wanker like he deserves,” insisted Jugson. He was losing his patience.
Lucius’ voice wobbled a bit over Draco’s name, but he smirked at Harry after he spoke. Harry was surprised for a moment that Draco would have talked to his father about him, but realized that he probably sent letters home complaining about ‘Saint Potter’. Harry couldn’t imagine either of Draco’s parents being that interested but felt oddly pleased by the thought. Draco had frustrated Harry enough over the years that he felt smug satisfaction that he had been equally vexing for Draco.
“But why? They never seemed interested in us as more than a snack,” said Mulciber. Harry didn’t have an answer for him.
“Potter are you-” Wiblin froze midway to Harry when the boy flinched back from him. Wiblin had been too close to Burke for Harry to trust him. It belatedly occurred to Harry that he was still naked from the waist down. He pulled his sheets around him since he didn’t know where Burke had tossed his clothes. Wiblin gulped as he glanced at Harry’s covered lap before focusing on his fallen co-worker.
"Ugh! Dragon it is," Harry groaned. The last thing he needed was to be persuaded into writing Draco's name surrounded by hearts.
“So, er, there are some letters for you,” Harry explained and gestured at the box. The others all stared at the box as if it was about to jump up and attack. It was Zabini that broke the impasse by plucking one of the top letters.
“I need a shave,” remarked Albert as he ran his hand along his chin. He patted Harry’s shoulder and told him “stick close to Lucius,” before he walked away. Harry watched him move towards a small line up of prisoners that were waiting for a guard to spell away any unwanted facial hair.
Harry glanced at Hale, but he couldn’t tell what Hale wanted or expected him to say, so he settled on the truth. “Not the guards, no.”
“What?” Harry frowned.
Twenty minutes before the interview, Harry nervously packed up his books. Ron asked if he wanted them to go with him. Even Nott looked like he’d join if Harry requested it. Harry declined. It was going to hard enough to get through without an audience.
“Yes. You have
“Well?” prompted Lucius after he observed Harry scowling at the photo for several minutes without discarding it like the others.
As the conversations continued around him, Harry let himself slowly relax again. At least until an uncomfortable feeling in his stomach started making itself known. He tried to ignore it as long as he could.
“You can always arrange to pay him back once you’re able to get to your funds,” Hale suggested. Harry nodded but dwelled on the fact that Albert had paid for his clearly expensive judicial-wizard.
“Oh! Sorry. Hermione, Ron, this is my judicial-wizard Reginald Hale,” Harry introduced them. Hale recognized Hermione’s name from her letters and thanked her for sharing some interesting reading material. With a pleased smile, Hermione launched into a comparison between wizard and muggle laws that she found interesting. Harry had no idea what she was talking about, but he was amused to see Hale’s surprise at her eagerness turn into genuine interest in the subject.
curious.
Harry’s trek to the library was derailed when he spotted a surprisingly familiar face in Hogwarts’ halls.
Again, Harry was quiet. He could see Burke getting frustrated and hoped that the man would grow tired and just leave.
“Mulciber is right-” Nott started to add before he was cut off.
“Ok, but you can punish them without… without taking everything. I’m not saying we should turn each cell into some sort of… luxury hotel, but do they have to do anything they can to make sure we’re miserable?” Harry asked.
Harry really didn’t want to look, but eventually could resist no more. The black symbols were not overly large but stood out prominently on his neck. The skin around the area was an angry red shade, but as Burke patted the area, the red seemed to be receding.
Draco snorted. “Please, Potter.”
“But it’s not to late to salvage this. Many people still believe in the chosen one,” Scrimgeour gave Harry an intense look. Harry merely raised an eyebrow but kept quiet. It was easier to ignore the man when they had been in the Weasley’s garden and there was a convenient gnome putzing about. The most exciting thing in Harry’s cell was the diminishing bar of soap that Harry really hoped they would replace soon.
“I don’t want you to hate me,” Harry said softly.
“Look, I know the prisoners have done some horrible things,” Harry figured he might as well get that out of the way first. “Some of them murdered people, tortured them… cast unforgivables,” Harry said, not denying his own crimes even if Ron felt Harry shouldn’t have gone to prison to begin with, “but they’re still
“I think they hope we won’t eat and end up starving to death,” Nott added. He was poking at the last bits of his food and seemed to be contemplating doing just that.
“Well,” Albert said, drawing out the word. “Someone really put their foot in it.”
When Draco pointed out that James had many ‘Weasley’ habits, Harry figured it just added proof to the nurture side of the nature verses nurture debate. James merely mimicked what he saw repeatedly. Ron had complained on multiple occasions about Harry allowing the Malfoys to corrupt his nephew; that ‘conceited rich heir’ wasn’t as attractive to most people as Harry inexplicably found it. Harry explained that the Malfoys were more generous than Ron knew. They picked up Harry’s slack whenever he grew distant. If the price was James acting a little entitled, Harry would take it over the alternative. So, James displaying both Weasley and Malfoy behaviours, did nothing to convince Harry that James was his own person. After all, Harry had also picked up habits from both families too.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said.
“Alright, good,” the man seemed relieved and started backing away from Harry. “Alright...”
Anything Harry would have said in response was quickly forgotten as he spotted something even more threatening once Burke had moved out of the way. In one of the cells across from him, a pair of grey eyes were watching him. Harry wondered if Burke planned this when he picked this cell for Harry or if it was just an unlucky coincidence. Being surrounded by death eater was bad. Terrible even. But being in the cell across from Lucius Malfoy was going to be hell.
“You should,” encouraged Ron. “After all this, we may need a judicial-witch on our team.”
As soon as Harry got out of the carriage he knew something was wrong. Well, more wrong that it already was.
Harry tilted his head and slowly pulled his collar down until the new tattoo was visible. Malfoy hissed in shock.
From the practice he had creating Albert's box, it was exceedingly easy to create a stone etching of a porcupine. Harry then created a slab with a peacock.
“Bloody hell,” Ron muttered.
“In some ways. Had I not been your judicial-wizard, it could have been disastrous,” Hale informed him with a smirk. Despite the rather pompous statement, Harry suspected there was a lot of truth to it. “It has, of course, backfired on the ministry as all sorts of lawmen are protesting it,” Hale continued to explain. Harry chanced a quick glance at the aurors and was surprised to see Perkins nod and Bradley scowl, though the latter could just be from being near Harry.
Later, once they had escaped Nagini and Voldemort, they’d both taken a closer look. The band was made of pure gold, and the ruby was a genuine stone. They had no way of knowing if was Lily’s ring, but they both thought it unlikely someone would have purposely left an expensive ring in the rubble of Harry’s home. Harry knew it could have been dropped by any number of people that had checked out the scene of his parents’ murder. Still, he liked thinking it had been his mother’s and got lost until Harry luckily found it. The fact the center was a ruby - Harry’s birthstone – supported his theory. Hermione even suggested it might have been a gift given to her after Harry was born. Part of him felt he’d built a whimsical fantasy; that in desperate times, he was grasping at any means of connection and comfort. Still, he treated it as if it was his mother’s ring.
“You don’t talk about your family,” noted Lestrange.
Their friends sent congratulatory messages, a few made “about time!” jokes, and some insisted on scheduling celebratory dinners. As far as Harry could tell, they all approved and were happy for them.
“I wouldn’t know,” Malfoy said eventually and then was silent again for a few minutes as he thought about the situation. “Sending you straight to Azkaban was probably just to make it harder for Dumbledore to rescue you quickly or prevent the whole thing from happening. They probably thought that sending you here would ensure that their plan would work… but since it’s a crap plan, it will not.”
Unlike the rest of the prison, this room was brightly lit. No longer accustomed to such light. Harry had to close his eyes against the brightness. When Burke urged him forward, Harry forced open his eyes. And immediately wished he hadn’t. In the center of the room was a chair with chains; exactly the same type that had been at his trial last year. Harry didn’t know what these men planned to do, but he was certain he did not want to sit in that chair.
“Well I can’t do nothing,” Lucius hissed. “What if... Draco cannot fail.”
“Yeah,” replied Harry in surprise.
“If Harry can’t hold them and a guard remarks on your recovery, we can say that another guard healed you to avoid additional problems from the ministry. It should be believable given recent events,” Lucius proposed. “Though we shouldn’t draw attention to it if we don’t have to, thus the illusions.”
“That can’t be helped I’m afraid. Have the dementors passed by yet? I’ll be sure to tell them to say a special hello to you,” Burke continued. Harry didn’t think the man actually knew the special attention the dementors had already paid him.
Nott joined them again. Hermione and Ron both frowned but didn’t outright ask him to leave. Nott had thus far been pleasant and respectful, so they could not shoo him away without appearing like assholes. Ron even relaxed when Nott offered to go over Ron’s essay for Transfiguration. Still, when they both needed to leave to do some prefect duties, they hesitated to leave Harry alone with Nott. He reassured them he’d be fine, but they both looked back uncertainly before they left the library.
“Alright, maybe, maybe some better workers, or what’s it called… sensitivity training? Yeah, maybe that’d be alright?” Ron said. Harry didn’t know what to do with that. He knew Ron was trying, maybe even genuinely supported his own suggestions, but Harry knew he was still skeptical on how much the prison should change. Harry didn’t know how he’d convince the public if he couldn’t even convince his best mates.
“Hot,” Harry panted, “and full.” The latter was a similar feeling to having eaten too much. Every time Harry escaped the Dursleys and was presented with one of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent meals, he couldn’t help but gorge himself. With Mrs. Weasley’s instance that he eat plenty, Harry would inevitably eat too much. Despite having done this a few times, the opportunity to eat as much and whatever he wanted meant he was doing his best Dudley impression. He immediately spent the following few hours regretting his life choices as his body rebelled against his too-full belly. He would moan until he finally digested enough to be comfortable again. Apparently eating a soul gave him the same feeling, except he doubted his body could digest it. “Too much,” Harry cried.
Burke started guiding Harry out of the cell while the other guard kept his wand trained on Harry.
It was easy to agree to the first part, but he debated about whether to involve Draco. It was tempting as it would give Harry an excuse to spend time with Draco. It would also get him away from whatever he was doing in the Room of Requirement. But Harry also wanted it to be a surprise; a gift he could use to impress Draco. He didn’t know which option was more selfish.
Harry’s heart soared at the possibility, but he trampled it down.
“Not like that,” Harry said. He wanted to comfort Draco and say Lucius was alright, but a beating from the guards wasn’t the only danger in Azkaban. Harry was worried about them himself. However, he didn’t want to say any of that given that Draco was clearly hoping for reassurances. Not sure what else to say, Harry offered “your dad is mostly worried about you.” He hoped it would bring some comfort to know that Draco was still Lucius’ top priority.
“Draco!” Harry called. It came out louder than expected, so Harry was glad that only the three Slytherins were nearby. A couple of second years had seen him head in this direction, but Harry hoped they didn’t care enough to follow him.
“Perhaps we just need the younger generation to show us a different way. Reginald has made your recent stay a rather public spectacle. That attention might open debate, and sway witches and wizards to be open to reform,” Dumbledore mused.
“Lucy gets another present?” asked Mulciber. “I’m beginning to think he’s your favourite,” the man teased.
“Yes.”
“You’ll get three meals a day-” Lucius started to explain.
Harry’s good mood lasted the whole day. He ignored all whispers about the Dursleys as best he could. A task made easier each time he locked eyes with Draco and got a smile instead of a sneer. It was a tad unfortunate that Harry didn’t see Draco outside of class that day, but Theo informed him that Draco spent most of his free time talking to Lucius. Occasionally Crabbe joined them, but Albert was at his trial, so Theo wouldn’t get the opportunity to speak to his dad until later in the evening. Harry regretted that he wouldn’t be able to talk to him too, but he supposed he could just ask Theo for details the next day.
“I believe you can manage throwing a toenail curling hex at someone,” announced Nott.
“They couldn’t arrest them, but the aurors gave them a hard time for awhile. After the papers started reporting on Umbridge, the aurors stopped showing up at Hogwarts to question them. However,” the man paused and Harry knew he wouldn’t like whatever was next. “Arthur Weasley had been asked to take a work leave. The papers got wind of it quickly. The ministry tried to present it as a positive thing, as if Mr. Weasley could use the time to focus on his family during their legal troubles. Since the ministry imposed an unpaid leave, everyone could tell that was utter horseshit. Mr. Weasley was reinstated quickly. I think he even got a slight pay raise.”
Draco’s research expanded into learning more about the deathly hallows. Somehow that led to Draco often reading the fable to James as a bedtime story. Eventually it got to the point where Harry had to floo Draco and ask him to come over just for the bedtime story, since James only wanted to be read to by Draco. Harry probably should have been insulted that his reading skills weren’t deemed sufficient, but he was secretly glad about James’ insistence. It gave Harry an excuse to see Draco daily.
“Er, do you mean the Weasleys?” Harry asked. He hoped she wasn’t planning on contacting the Dursleys.
I probably went into more detail than needed with Harry’s gifts to the others. I wanted to stress that Harry was learning more than simple spells. The death eaters have been encouraging him to think about the subjects deeply, to combine different types of magic, and to take charge of his own learning. And most importantly, if there is no known spell to do something, it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. It just might mean you have to create the spell yourself. This provides Harry with hope so that he’s open to the idea that there might be alternative solutions to the horcrux problem. No one has any ideas currently, but a lot can be accomplished with effort.
” asked another. Much like their looks, their voices sounded alike. However, there was a minute difference that informed Harry that different creatures were speaking.
