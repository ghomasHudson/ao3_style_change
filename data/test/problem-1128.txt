I am plenty sober. Stop worrying like a mother hen. My last drink was almost two hours ago now and I was never
So my thought is this: You've got their attention already. Do something with it. Prove wrong the bastards campaigning to get you expelled and cheering for you to fail, and show the rest of the student body what Slytherin house can be with the right people at the helm.
His eyes glittered mischievously as he eyed the man across from him again, this time with far more appreciation. Potter had scruffy, thick hair that looked shiny and soft; brilliant green eyes that could melt ice or give birth to butterflies with just a glance; and a perfect build, as far as Draco was concerned... far better to be seen in life than in fantasy. He worried his lip once more.
"Just so we're clear: I'm not saying no, but I can't make any promises about my ability to perform. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
That elicited another short laugh from the blonde as he was already being tempted into round two. He was young and definitely horny, but even he needed at least ten minutes between rounds. Slowly, he pulled out of the kiss.
He held the tiny sun between both hands, staring into its yellow-orange center until his vision went white, then, without warning, he crushed it to nothing with an echoey clap.
Draco's quip was delivered on a smile, indicating he was merely kidding. He kissed Harry's lips one last time.
Draco chuckled as he slipped a hand between them and placed it over Harry's stomach. He leaned forward to nuzzle his lover's ear and whispered hotly, "You should eat first. You'll need your strength."
Draco chuckled at Harry's dramatic display. He leaned forward and brushed their lips together in a slow, teasing press and suckle of lips before pulling back.
"We should ask Harry his intentions with Draco, as well," Luna interjected in her gentle, singsong way. "Besides wanting to have sex with him, of course."
Draco smirked and Harry's thoughts scattered when he added a clever twist to his strokes. He was able to gather them with a bit of effort. Focusing on talking was helping to keep  his orgasm at bay.
But then why would he be standing there with a hand outstretched, mischief on his face and challenge in his laughing eyes?
A part of him wanted to hold back, to break the man completely, but it all felt so bloody good, the psychological factors so unbelievably arousing--Harry Potter was begging him to come while wearing a ball gown at his command!--that his own orgasm was a looming inevitability.
"The procedure is muggle. You wouldn't have heard of it," he said dismissively. "But did you report that attack to the DMLE? I don't remember it from any of our briefings and you're high profile enough that it would have come across an Auror's desk at some point."
"I 'ate to tell ya, but those files are private. Ya'd need permission from the recipients or from the Malfoys themselves to get access. They're bank records, ya see."
"Laugh it up, fuzzball," Potter intoned. He pointed a finger at Draco and sardonically declared, "I should feed you to Mrs. Norris."
Harry deflated slightly but his mulish pride insisted he fight on. "You're telling me that you're keen on the two of us dating then, are you?" he pressed, directing the jab at Hermione for her smug nod at Neville's claim.
He reached up to wrap an arm around Draco's waist and hold the back of his head with the other so he could give him a proper snog. He held nothing back.
Malfoy gave his leg a critical once-over then speared him with a penetrating stare. He considered Harry for what felt like an eternity before finally relenting--with a heavy exhalation--and returning stiffly to the chair.
While his complexion was rough and dark, with equally dark hair sprouting on his legs, forearms, chest, and abdomen (narrowing and becoming more dense the lower it trailed), Draco's skin was soft and porcelain, and it looked virtually hairless below his neck except for the small patches of dark blond in his armpits and at the base of his prick.
"Why'd you never say anything about this before?" Harry asked curiously, as though he weren't presently being shagged to the brink of orgasm (even though he most definitely was). His mind had a tendency to go down rabbit holes during sex and the thoughts would become distracting to him if he didn't voice them. Ian had hated it. But Harry was eager to know. If Draco had wanted him as long as he'd said, why did he wait so long to so much as smile at him?
He pulled a few strands of his fringe forward with one hand while stabbing a piece of smothered broccoli with the fork in the other.
"If you think I'm going to complain about being given the privilege of that sweet arse of yours, you're sorely mistaken," he replied easily, propping himself up on one arm to pull the covers back and determine the best approach for getting Draco out of his clothes as fast as possible. "I am up for the challenge."
Draco sat up on his knees and spread his thighs as one hand took hold of Harry's neglected cock. He positioned it against his hole and slowly lowered himself onto the head.
He released the breath he'd been holding several second later when the group walked on in the other direction. His senses remained finely turned for threat, however.
"'m sorry," Teddy mumbled promptly, eyes downcast. A glob of icing fell out of his fringe and plopped wetly on the back of Harry's hand. It had bits of yellow butter cake--Harry's favourite--and matching yellow sprinkles stuck to it. Too bad that any cake his godson wasn't currently wearing was smeared all over the the kitchen floor. He considered trying to salvage it but Draco would be mortified. And that meant sex would definitely be off the table. No, it was more important to focus on salvaging what he could of the evening, he prudently decided.
Harry went to the window, the concerned expressions he'd received a moment ago too much to bear. He focused instead on purple patches of heather amidst an unkempt green lawn, dotted here and there with the artefacts of Arthur's obsession: a rusty lawnmower, a tipped-over watering can, a motor of some sort. The sun was just beginning to go down in the western sky. Its heat radiated through the smudged glass, warming his face.
Harry briefly entertained the idea of feeling embarrassed by the observation but decided to cram a forkful of food into his mouth instead. The combination of salt and fat was a great comfort to him.
"None of that if you want to eat here," he chided, eyebrows drawn and expression stern. "Unless you're interested in expanding our sexual repertoire to include exhibitionism," he clarified. "I'm pretty sure Becky or Betsy or whatever her name is wouldn't mind."
"Well, I don't know how to cut it myself, and after the last time I tried to have someone other than a house-elf or my mother do it... Well, let's just say wearing half my head close-cropped is not a good look for me. I haven't the patience to deal with my father, and Mother has been on extended 'vacation'," he lifted his hands and quoted the word with his fingers, "for ages. With no one else I trust, I just... let it grow.
I know we are going to piss each other off now and then, but luckily for you I don't require groveling or gifts--just a straight-forward apology. Do you make your boyfriends buy your love, as well?
His immediate thoughts were consumed with the removal of the scalding substance from his person. He didn't have time to worry about the fact a good portion had gotten into his eyes and mouth. That is, not until the bone-twisting, stomach-churning pain of transformation set in, erasing all petty concern for things like ruined robes and superficial burns. He clutched his stomach and doubled over in agony, dangerously close to sicking up on his Oxfords. The room spun dizzily and suddenly he was falling.
"Liar," Harry accused fondly. Draco's expression was pained, his breathing ragged, and he was trying to just will his way through (which was not the way Harry was going to deflower someone).
What looked suspiciously like the hint of a smile tugged at the corners of Malfoy's lips before he stiffened them. Something fluttered in Harry's chest. (Indigestion probably--he'd had Thai for lunch.)
to break me out of the hospital! I might still be contagious and I absolutely refuse to get anyone else unfortunate enough to come in contact with me sick, as well.
"Mm," he pulled away just long enough to grab a pinch of floo, toss it in, and say clearly (in a dry, raspy voice), "Malfoy Manor," before unceremoniously tossing his lover in--quickly following after with an excited cackle.
He promptly forgot the lesson he'd learned not five minutes earlier--his heart clenched in sympathy. And the roaring lion within him (which demanded justice for all and championed the plight of the downtrodden) pawed and paced on Malfoy's behalf.
Harry smirked against Draco's mouth, pleased with himself for having been right. He gave Draco's prick another few lazy wanks then turned him around so they were both facing the door.
think about it. A good deal more frequently than he would like. And once the idea took hold, it began seeming... well, not entirely out of the question.
He leapt onto the table to appraise the two plates. They were nearly identical--both heaped with juicy baked chicken, golden fried potatoes, and vibrant steamed broccoli--but one featured the addition of two boiled eggs. He instinctively knew that plate was meant for him and he silently thanked the house-elves for their thoughtfulness. He hadn't even been certain they'd noticed him in the kitchen, so enamoured were they with Potter's presence.
Hello Boys and Ghouls! In honor of the holiday, I have risen from the grave to actually publish a chapter. Happy Halloween!
"Who told you!" he asked with a mock gasp of horror. "Guess I shall have to conjure up a new devilish plan since my original one has been discovered."
Draco kicked his trousers off after they were pulled down. He had no socks or shoes on, which made the undressing process much easier. He widened his legs just before his entrance was penetrated by one of his lover's rough fingers.
They stood from the couch, Draco somehow retaining his grace and hardly even wobbling, and then Potter suddenly had a new scarf. The blonde had moved to hug his neck and press into the front of his body.
the food," he explained (slowly) and offered Draco a hand up. "From a streetside vendor. It is going to be cheap, greasy, and delicious. And you will thank me when we're through."
Draco sighed as he felt Harry's cock begin to tickle his sphincter once more, a small smile gracing his patrician features... Which slowly ebbed away until it was a stern frown the longer Harry played with his hole instead of filling it.
Fortunately, he was pretty good at ignoring intimidation (he'd had practice). Encouraged by Draco's breathless, sultry urging, he wrapped his hand around the hard length and noted its similarities and differences to his own. It was hot, smooth, and had a nice weight to it. He began to tug with the long, easy strokes he preferred at first and watched Draco closely for his reactions.
Draco didn't want to think of the letters Potter might be sending his other friends (were they friends?) in his addled state. But if it was possible, just possible--
"Use your mind to make us less sticky," Draco practically demanded as he curled around Harry and kissed his cheek. He nuzzled his lover's ear with a satisfied smile. "It's sexier than
Harry'd sent Malfoy home with an appointment for the following Friday and detailed instructions on how to purchase appropriate athletic wear for their next session, which would include a series of exercises meant to test his strength, flexibility, stamina, and coordination. An unprepared wizard turned loose in a place like Lillywhites could be trouble, especially one like Malfoy who'd probably never stepped foot into such a store, let alone done shopping there.
Harry spluttered, nearly choking on his tea. "Oh. I wasn't planning on--" he cleared his squeaky throat and scratched the side of his head awkwardly.
Harry grinned. "Three, at least. Maaaybe four, if you stay the night. That would be a new record for me." He took another bite--it was just as good as the first. "As for the lack of injuries, part of that is Ron watching my back, for sure. The rest is...well, I've always had a knack for defense, I suppose."
"So bossy," he admonished playfully as he grabbed his necessary tools and went to work. "Just remember demands are not one of my turn-ons. Not unless they are delivered in a sexy growl."
"I don't know. Are you going to behave like a neanderthal or are you going to apologize for being a prick?" Draco's brows furrowed and his lips thinned. He almost resembled Snape with the way he glowered. "And don't argue with me about it! You get mad at me if I am even just the tiniest bit bossy. I always apologize via sexual favors, though
For all that he had been giving Potter a hard time earlier about his stamina, between the hand on his prick, the one on his bollocks, and the tongue in his arsehole, Draco was rapidly hurtling toward orgasm.
you I can’t do it, Potter!“ Malfoy exclaimed, as if his half hearted attempts at wand work over the past five minutes totally vindicated him. He glowered at the hawthorn wand held clumsily in his weak right hand, looking for all the world like a sullen teen.
But it wasn't just any bloke. And it wasn't just fucking. It was Draco and it was his first time and he'd said he loved him and wanted to be made love to so Harry kissed him deeply and thrust gently, pouring all the emotion he felt for him into all of it.
Nancy had called that morning asking after her "favourite patient." When Harry failed to divine the identity of the person in question, she'd been shocked he didn't immediately know who she meant--apparently, the Malfoy who saw her for twice-weekly occupational therapy was both "charming" and "gracious" and worked harder than the rest of her patients combined. Harry felt a feeling that was suspiciously like missing when he recalled the way Malfoy used to lob insults at him from the exercise equipment (but more than likely was just discomfort over having lied to his colleague: "I dunno, Nance. He hasn't shown up for any of our appointments, either.").
"But, Harry, they won't talk to you!" Draco protested. It was strange, the almost high-pitched quality his voice took as he spoke. "One of the first things we learn as children is to always call a solicitor when it comes to discussing possible criminal involvement and the consequences thereof," he explained as he was coaxed back onto the cushy sofa once more. "Even if... Even if it's true, I know what buttons to push and what not to say. And I'm a friend, so they wouldn't think to mistrust me."
"It's quite green," he commented wryly, knowing Draco would scold him for it if given the chance. "I like it," he added as he pulled Draco's head down for a lengthy kiss.
Draco smiled through a deep, guttural moan as he was finally penetrated. His back had arched to meet his first trust, but the pleasure of his prostate being bulls-eyed was not what caused the burst of warmth nor the stretch of his lips (as pleasant as that was, and it really was.)
Having his hand suddenly taken was surprising, but only for a second. As their fingers interlocked, Draco curled his across the warm back of Harry's hand between his roughened knuckles. He squeezed to show his approval of the new tact, and promptly rolled his eyes at the wary way Harry glared around at the few evening passersby. Draco was far more comfortable than the angry looking Auror who appeared to have something to prove.
"Of course I do," he replied smugly, despite knowing what a wreck he was not even half an hour ago. "And you... Look more than adequate."
In short order, they got their ducks in a row and had the waitress brought in for questioning, making especially sure to file all of the appropriate paperwork in advance this time around to avoid another debacle like the one with Zabini and Parkinson. Once again, Harry stayed out of sight and let Ron do the interrogating, deeming it especially prudent in light of the incident the night previous.
He jotted in his notebook the alterations he had made to this batch (an extra tablespoon of Fluxweed, finely dicing the Boomslang skin rather than shredding it, stirring anti-clockwise while adding the Bicorn horn). The last attempt had been a partial success, giving him whiskers, claws, and an unpleasant lump that could have been a vestigial tail. Though he desperately hoped his animal form was something more formidable than a house cat, a full transformation of any type would cement his reputation as the foremost living brewer.
The unexpected turn in conversation was a bloody minefield. He didn't want a perfectly good evening--perfectly good after the woefully inadequate assassination attempt, anyway--to end because Draco said something offensive about his friends. But then, they would have to talk about them sooner or later if this...whatever it was...was ever going to be anything more than shagging.
Coffee is absolutely terrible for you: it is addicting, creates bad breath, and yellows teeth. Before you become fully dependent on something so pedestrian, I would like you to consider some alternatives. Your next gift is a collector's edition tea box with assorted teas from around the world--both caffeinated and decaffeinated, including many traditional British blends. I trust you will find one that you favour.
"Is there nothing you're not good at?" Draco asked with a huff, just before releasing the headboard with his right hand and shoving Harry's head back down toward his ass. "Yes, give me more."
"...So, when are you going to get mad at me and plot revenge? Or is punching a man in the face without warning still the preferred Gryffindor style?"
Of course he'd seen other pricks--boarding school followed by the locker rooms in the DMLE--but he'd never been so up close and personal with one before, especially not one that was
Draco chuckled quietly at the moniker. It had been applied to him before, but never with the hint of a smile Potter sported when he'd said it. That small, novel alteration had Draco quickening his motions, almost without noticing.
He surreptitiously scanned the room to find they were the focus of every single pair of eyes, including the gaping bride and groom. He sighed. There would be hell to pay for this little stunt.
to come to work while still carrying that flu around I will personally strangle you with your own hideously red scarf! I cannot afford you infecting my person with your germs due to some idiotic notion that one must continue their duties no matter the cost as I, for one, am not willing to pay for your reckless work ethic!
He remained on the sofa while Draco trudged upstairs, feeling lazy enough to consider casting a cleaning charm on himself (but they just weren't as reliable as good old fashioned soap and water). Forcing himself up with great effort, he made his way to the loo, thinking he'd have a look around while he was in there.
Draco chuckled wearily as Harry laid his weight into him. He ran a hand down the Auror's jaw until he could press his thumb in the slight dip of his chin.
Draco looked none too pleased about the food but he hadn't even tried it yet. Harry was irritated by his bad attitude.
So, for the first time in quite a long time, Ron beat him into the office that day. His eyes widened in surprise when Harry sauntered through the door, his ginger brows climbed his freckled forehead. He hadn't expected Harry at all, of course. Maybe he should have owled ahead.
He carried the curry to the table to dish it into the bowls and motioned with his head for Malfoy to follow. "The chemistry between them is electric and undeniable," he continued, gaining steam. "And I especially like that their relationship has to overcome significant challenges, what with it being so unconventional." He seated himself and picked up his fork. "I've never liked for things to be too easy," he concluded with a wink.
Harry was so dismayed he wasn’t sure he’d said that bit out loud but Malfoy replied as if he had so the question was moot.
"Is it too tight?" he asked solicitously. "Your wand doesn't respond to me quite as well as my own, of course."
Malfoy laughed, the sound joyful and uninhibited. Harry thought that maybe he’d never heard something so lovely before.
We are in the home stretch now!! At my current estimate, that means we have maybe ten more chapters (most likely
"Come on," he growled as his hand encircled Draco's cock tightly. He wouldn't last much longer, but he needed Draco to come first. "Come on..."
I am sure once we get a few rounds out of our systems we will be okay to talk. After sleeping it off, I imagine. I won't go easy on you.
"Don't mistake my prudence for lack of interest," he warned, righting both himself and his robes. "Your gown awaits, and that," he gestured at Potter's lap, "is going to disrupt the fall of the skirts."
"I have a dinner to finish," he said simply. With that, he took Draco by the arm and apparated them home.
"So demanding," Draco admonished playfully as he released Harry's nipple with a wet slurp. He used both hands to grip the twin peaks hard and used the renewed addition of his weight on the Auror's cock to grind down into Harry's erratic thrusts.
Some time later, a ginger head peeked through Harry's open office door. "Hey, mate," Ron greeted affably, "Can I tag along when you head home tonight? Hermione thinks she left Rosie's favourite dummy at your place."
With great effort, he pried open his eyes to peer blearily at Draco as he tried to process his questions. "Just you," he mumbled eventually, reaching out to wrap an arm around Draco and tug him closer. He tucked Draco's head into his neck and nuzzled his hair, practically purring like a kitten. He wasn't ready for bed, per se, but a nap wouldn't be remiss...
"I got distracted," he replied, kissing his way up Draco's flat, smooth stomach to the hollow of his throat, which he flicked with his tongue.
You, sir, are a disgusting slob. It's a wonder you haven't contracted a horrible disease from your own ruddy desk yet!
I can now appreciate your qualities for what the are, along with the striking package that contains them. You are quite a man, Harry Potter.
"This isn't nearly hot enough," he complained. In spite of his words, he began to scrub his now golden hair instead of attempting to fuss with the taps. He did spare another glance towards Harry's dripping body, though. He openly leered and his lip was once again caught between his teeth.
"Fred is dead because of Voldemort," he passionately asserted. "And there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't miss him or I'm not broken up about all the people who lost their lives because of that monster. But Draco isn't any more responsible for his death than me--maybe even more-so in my case since I'm the one Voldemort was trying to get to all along. So unless you're going to start taking me to task over that, you need to lay off of him. And bloody well get used to the idea of him being around here," he poked Ron hard in the middle of the chest. "Because if I like him enough to go through all this bullshit, he's probably going to be sticking around for a while."
"Like that, pet?" he breathed as his hand tightened and began to stroke. "Tighter? Faster? How do you want it?"
Draco openly sighed with disappointment, though he was still grinning to ease any hurt Harry might have felt from the noise. (He decided he would hold Harry to that 'next time' clause, however.) He gave the uncapped lube a sniff and made an appreciative hum.
We can make accommodations in an effort to limit your media exposure before and during the event. It would not be difficult to announce you as a special guest seeker and keep your identity a secret until you take the pitch. Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about the reporters beating down your door after the fact, but we can at least provide the utmost security to escort you home, should you wish.
"Married? What's her last name now? She seems like the type to hyphenate. I always thought she'd go into activism after her organization of that house-elf rights program. What was it called again?" He didn't sound entirely interested, but he was just
Enclosed are a dust mask for when you cough, some Forever Ice Cubes for your fever and throat, and detailed instruction for decontaminating your home and person. I have already sanitized the office.
"What, you want to shake hands?" Potter asked incredulously, easy laughter making his words melodic. Draco held his gaze. That was
Unsurprisingly, the en suite was large and the amenities lavish. He spent a moment to look around, then took his usual spartan shower, marveling at Draco's multiple shower heads and colorful assortment of soaps, lotions, and Godrick knew what else. (They were going to have to shower together in there soon...maybe even that night.)
Draco gasped hotly as Harry suddenly began to swallow his cock. His pants had been tossed to the floor. It was another pleasant shock, having Harry eagerly eat his prick--his throat and mouth already constricting so perfectly on the sensitive length.
Crabbe's death was as sure a motive for murder as anything if Goyle did in fact hold Malfoy responsible. Malfoy didn't seem to think so, but it was often difficult for individuals in the middle of a situation to properly assess it. Harry would have him brought in for questioning.
The Slytherin's playfulness turned into challenge as he stared down the inch or so below at Potter's annoyed features. Something seemed to flash behind the silver of his eyes, coupled with a smug smirk reminiscent of their childhood days.
He waited impatiently for Pansy's face to appear within the flames. It did before long, though she seemed irritated by the interruption (which caused Draco to smirk--knowing full well she was probably with her beau of the month).
, he thought, throwing caution to the wind. Ian had been a nice, safe boyfriend and look where that got him.
Draco smirked and shook his head at his boyfriend's grin. He just knew the man had so many jokes he wanted to make but was holding them back. His arms wound back around Harry's neck as he was dragged into a kiss, already carefully dragging them back to his extremely large, pillow stuffed bed. He twisted them around just before his knees hit and shoved the Auror out of the kiss and backwards over the edge of the bed. Draco immediately followed, straddling his thighs.
He dropped his backpack on the floor, acutely aware of how dingy it looked in the pristine space. He avoided making eye contact with himself in the expansive, spotless mirrors for the same reason.
He had finally looked away from Harry’s gruesome extremity to pierce him with his gaze, which Harry opted to take as tacit permission to re-dress. “It’s always worse when I’m thinking about it,” he replied, doing up his trousers while Malfoy watched. He neglected to mention the nausea that turned his stomach or the creeping dread that squeezed his chest vice-like or how the stench of his own burning flesh mixed with the acrid copper taste of blood in his mouth and the indescribable pain and sense of
Harry turned Draco's patented smirk-and-sassy-eyebrow maneuver on the sexy Slytherin and shimmied lower on the mattress, pulling the blankets all the way over himself and covering Draco up to the waist so he wouldn't get cold.
"Really? You're making me wear these?" Draco said with a sigh, but took the items none-the-less (knowing full well what a fit he might pitch if Harry denied his "punishment" for doing something similar.) Despite his hesitance, he folded the square and gently propped it into his pocket appropriately and quickly, skillfully tied the red neck piece into an Elredge knot about his collar. It took a minute longer to complete, but the mesmerized look on Harry's face made it more than worth the effort. It was an unusual, fishtail knot his father hated for being so "informal".
He reached behind himself to pull the tab that diverted water to the shower head and stepped into the spray.
That didn't seem likely, unless Malfoy was bored out of his mind being cooped up at home. Which could be--
Harry stamped out the small thrill he felt at Malfoy's (sort-of) compliment. "Thanks," he said off-handedly, pressing the button for Level Two. "And thank you for meeting me here today. I've been looking over the names of those who applied for restitution from your family and cross referencing them against anyone who might hold a grudge against
It was Harry's turn to bite his lip as he struggled against the sense of inevitability tightening his bollocks and putting a stutter in his movements. He was hot all over...but it paled in comparison to the scorching heat gripping his prick.
"Yours is a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions, extra sauce, and no pickles," he explained, handing the yellow-wrapped item to Draco (he'd done his best to order it the way Draco would like best). "It's meant to be eaten with your hands like a sandwich but if you'd rather use a knife and fork, I won't judge you too harshly. And if you want ketchup for the crisps, there's some in the little packets in the bag."
That thought led directly to another disconcerting one: was any of this going to make it into a future book? They'd have to talk about that--he wasn't entirely comfortable with the notion.
The laces at his back were tightened until Harry could barely breathe. He gripped his hips in an effort to keep some form of balance while Gieves abused his ribcage and lungs, but the moment he lifted his head to look at Draco it ceased to matter.
Moments passed. The pain ebbed by degrees but left behind the disorienting sensation of Draco's body parts being in the wrong configuration. He couldn't see a thing and felt like he was being smothered. Debilitating panic raced at the edges of his mind. As he struggled to right himself and caught flashes of light in the darkness, he realized the problem--he was tangled in a pile of his now far-too-big clothing. So much for being something fearsome.
Draco sat across from Harry with his own plate and took a few minutes to settle in. The balcony itself was kept well-cleaned, despite its minimum use, with ivory chairs and table. The railing was covered in ivy that reached from the ground to the roof. He spared a few seconds for the backyard before turning his gaze back to Harry--studying his face and smiling at the slight awe he found there.
Draco, for his part, was completely cavalier about the whole affair, except for the rare occasion Harry caught him brooding. (But he always pretended that wasn't the case when he was called on it.) Besides the glaring elephant in the room, things between them were going surprisingly well. It still didn't feel real, but they'd been on several dates (most of which hadn't involved danger or intrigue), done a whole lot of not-quite-shagging, and generally enjoyed each other's company.
He arched wantonly against Draco's cock, spreading his legs even wider, and groaned, "Like that. Just like that."
"Had to learn when I began to live alone. No house elves. This is actually something I concocted myself, a cross between Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna. I don't like Parmesan cheese or the big noodles and meats in lasagna, so I took what I liked from each one day and put it together. It came out exactly how I wanted it."
Harry grinned, lips stretched around Draco's prick, and drew off with a hard suck. He gave the head a final lick with the tip of his tongue and resumed his ascent up Draco's body.
That startled a breathless laugh out of Harry. He pulled Draco down beside him, lest the insatiable beast get any ideas, and pressed a loud, smacking kiss to his forehead.
Malfoy hummed with a skeptical squint but let the matter drop. His eyes seemed to linger on Harry's trousers, however. What was wrong with them? They weren't wrinkled--Harry'd ironed them. A quick visual inspection revealed that they didn't appear to be harbouring any renegade stains either. In fact, he couldn't determine a single possible cause for Malfoy's critical look, and yet...
Malfoy eyed him as if he didn’t fully trust the statement but he nodded an acknowledgment and returned to his meal.
"Fine, be that way," he huffed dramatically, standing with a creak and a groan (whether from the chair or his joints, he wasn't sure). "I don't envy you the flaying you'll be getting when 'Mione finds out you turned down a perfectly good opportunity for a child-free date, though. Hasn't she been after you to be more romantic lately?" he asked with false innocence, knowing for a fact that was an on-going sore spot between them. (Harry's private theory was that Ron was stacking up rather unfavorably against the men in Hermione's current 'light reading.')
Draco squeezed a little tighter as his grip became slicker. The water from the shower and the heavy precum leaking from Harry's head proved to be effective lubricant, at least enough to allow firm, solid strokes without an unpleasant burn. His own cock stilled as he concentrated on Harry's, though the full length of it remained pressed from balls to head along the Auror's scalding crease.
Balancing his plate in one hand, Harry dished up fat tortellini, thick, pink salmon, crisp, colorful salad, and well-seasoned squash. He eyed the treacle tart covetously--it was warm and gooey perfection. (He might not have been so hasty in his marriage proposal after all.)
Draco made a noise of protest, a whine perhaps, at the idea of having to get up from the couch. He was tired and content, and more than ready to take a nap right there on the lumpy sofa. Reluctantly, he opened his eyes to see Potter hovering over him with a hand outstretched. He frowned and narrowed his eyes at the man like an angry child... Until he developed an idea. He sighed, as if in defeat, then--fast as a snake--grabbed Potter's hand and jerked him down to the couch. In the same motion he rolled them over so that he was laying on top of the Auror.
Harry’s leg was beginning to cramp, the overtaxed remaining muscles seizing up beneath Malfoy’s dead weight. As gingerly as he could, he began to shift inch by painstaking inch so that his left hip became the fulcrum for their combined weight.
"No? Really? Are you just not that adventurous or have you not had someone long enough to experiment with?"
"Dinner was good," Weasley said with little enthusiasm as he shook Draco's hand goodnight with a wooden grip. Draco rolled his eyes and was tempted to correct him (dinner had been
He carefully slid from the bed and to the floor where some of his old laundry was. Dirty or not, he pulled on a pair of trousers and tied the laces in the front as quietly as possible.
Draco was absolutely at his wit's end. Every time he seriously considered biting Potter, however, the oaf would scoop him up for a cuddle--taking serious ruddy liberties--and scratch all the spots that made him forget his anger momentarily.
Satisfied with his unhindered taste and really quite full at that point, he returned the plate to the table and settled in to watch Draco. The man ate like he did most things--slow, absurdly sensual, and deliberate. The way he licked his flatware wasn't helping the ache in Harry's bollocks any. But it was a delicious torture.
now because I have work in the morning. Like a normal person." He shuffled under the covers with Draco snuggled in close and felt pleasantly fuzzy all over.
A cry was wrenched from his lungs as his joints snapped into place--shoulders, elbows, ankles, and knees; knuckles, writs, and jaw--all at the same time, excruciatingly. His fur receded, teeth and nails flattened and dulled. His stomach threatened to unload its contents but he forced them down.
Harry's orgasm caught him by surprise--both in its suddenness and its intensity. Seemingly every muscle in his body tensed at once and he came on a silent scream, the pleasure exploding outward from his belly rather than his prick. Draco drew up, but not off, swallowing every last drop as Harry's bollocks emptied themselves, triggering another blinding spasm and a choked sob. By the time the aftershocks began to subside, his breath rattled in his lungs and spots danced before his vision.
Apparently reading Harry's thoughts (shit--could he do that?), Malfoy pointed sharply at him. "I am still mad at you," he declared, even but firm, forestalling the development of any notions to the contrary. "Furious, actually."
"So, where are we?" (Draco decided to ask outright to confirm his suspicion rather than sit and wonder.) "And why aren't we naked and in your bed instead?"
"How did you come to write professionally?" Harry inquired, genuinely curious. He returned to the hob to turn the chicken, pleased with the golden brown sear that was developing.
Draco groaned with appreciation as his head was licked and then swallowed. It didn't matter that Harry couldn't take all of him, his cock still twitched and his heart still thrummed. He was already painfully hard by the time Harry had decided to reciprocate--he wouldn't last long...
"Before we're done getting to know each other," he clarified, relatively sure Draco couldn't twist those words to take them the wrong way. "Now, hush."
Lucius didn't move to comply, only arched a brow and frowned minutely up at him. Harry fought to maintain the tenuous hold he had on the reins of his fury.
"You don't know what I have!" Harry snapped, before he could think better of it (which was pretty much immediately). Leave it to the incomparable wanker to irritate a confession of love out of him.
Was it too soon to mention that? He hoped not. He wanted Potter--Harry; he'd always been Harry in the secret recesses of his mind--with every fiber of his being. Had for years. But hearing the man so unsure left him wanting to share in the hope it could be a comfort.
...I sound like I'm whinging. I don't mean to. I've chosen my situation, unlike you. Freedom of choice is significant for me. I'm sorry about the situation you're in with that marriage contract. Godrick, I'd rush out to marry someone else just to let it be my own bloody choice. I hope she finds someone else and that you can buy the family out because of it. If not, you should just violate the contract yourself, I think.
"Suit yourself," she shrugged, snickering, but Harry could see the wheels turning as she looked between him and Malfoy. Could be trouble: Janine had a decidedly
He'd learned Draco well enough to know it wasn't genuine. For whatever reason Draco had felt the need to set his feelings aside, maybe even with Occlumency (Harry was beginning to worry he did that far too often to be healthy), and that made him feel like shit.
Draco always complained about Harry collapsing on top of him 'like a great, dumb ox' after coming, so he intentionally collapsed next to him instead, drawing him down onto the bed to cuddle...apparently right into the puddle of his cooling jizz.
There was more grinding than was strictly necessary when Draco returned and Harry knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that this was the very best risk he had ever taken.
"I can't wait to see what noises you'll make," one lubricated finger slowly began to slip into Harry's entrance, "when I have my fingers in you."
Your mother has informed me that you are refusing the potion from St. Mungo's because you believe it to be poison.
Swallowing after two and a half delicious chews--and more than a couple delighted moans--he plucked the chip from Draco's fingers (as the pureblood stared on in shock and horror) and shoved the whole springy thing into his mouth.
Draco continued to slice the vegetables with an especially smug smirk. The sound of the sizzling meat filled the momentary silence as Potter put out cups and flatware.
. "With the first and last letters transposed?" She looked to him for confirmation and Draco nodded hard enough to put a kink in his neck. "It obviously isn't written in English then," she deduced. Spot on. He trilled and danced about the table, more fond of the pair than he ever had been--Granger for her wonderful, clever mind and Potter for having the good sense to fire-call the woman (and maybe a few other things).
He looped his arms around Draco's waist and thought. He'd had a plan for dinner out, but he wasn't sure Draco would feel up for it given everything. Besides the emotional upset of the case, international portkeying was exhausting.
Harry made short work of filling him in on the relevant details and turning the sniveling restaurateur over to his more than capable colleagues.
Draco chuckled as he walked around Potter with a certain sway in his hips on his way back to the couch. He didn't deny or accept the Auror's silent questioning, satisfied enough to know Potter was a fan. He sat back down with a little more dignity than usual and laid his elbows over the back of the piece of furniture.
It slipped from his face as an idea took shape: He'd gotten to touch and have a taste--and had enjoyed both far more than he ever would have thought possible--but what he hadn't been able to do yet was
," he put enough emphasis on the last words for the innuendo to be unmistakable. "What's not to like?" he smirked.
He set down his spoon with composure that impressed even him and picked up his glass for a long drink of water. His heart had lodged itself somewhere around his Adam's apple and made swallowing difficult. It thudded like a jungle drum.
He was plenty angry still. He paced a few steps to calm his temper and gather his thoughts, then came to stand in front of Ron--who slouched against the wall with crossed arms and a sulky expression--again.
"Heh. Not all the time," he clarified, relaxing somewhat and offering a half smile. "But I can be available during the day as long as you run plans by me first. And you've made a compelling case for me to keep my evenings open."
Draco gasped as he was thrust into. He bit Harry's ear in retaliation and thrust back--hard. He pressed Harry's chest into the shower wall as he grasped his hip tight to keep him place while his right hand gripped the Auror's hard, swollen cock; his own hard length slid between Harry's crease.
"That wasn't half-bad, Potter," he smirked condescendingly. "l think I shall do something special for you... Besides being your own personal sex kitten."
Harry restrained his scoff over Draco's 'no judging' command at the doorway. They'd been in his room at its worst, how bad could Draco's be in comparison?
Malfoy eyed him speculatively. “It didn’t seem to bother you before,” he hazarded after enough beats had passed for the ringing in Harry’s ears to clear. “What changed?”
"Too bad," Draco murmured before he moaned and twitched with every wave of heat that hit his stomach and quickly raced its way to the tips of his fingers and toes.
Feeling bold, Harry cupped the back of Draco's head and pulled him in for a real snog. He tasted like capers and wine.
Draco moaned softly as he climbed into the tub and sank into the hot depth below the layer of bubbles. His head lolled back against the tub as a cat-like smile stretched over his lips.
"Even if you caught this guy, it doesn't mean I'll be safe from someone else doing something else to end me--maybe even something similar. It's just the way it goes. And besides... I do get out sometimes: to charity auctions and to Pansy and Blaise. I just don't go out dancing and drinking. It's not a big deal."
tools I like?" There was something in the way he grinned and quirked his brow even higher at that offer. It was a mix between evil and excited. "Well, luckily for you I have a number of useful tools."
The Manor was different than Harry remembered it. Still cavernous. Cold. Absolutely dripping with valuables. (There was enough gold in the fixtures alone to make a dragon jealous.) But where it had been library-quiet the few times Harry had visited in the past, an almost perfect silence permeated it now. And if he wasn't mistaken, several portraits were missing from the walls.
Harry was the Head Auror. He'd just gotten out of a long term relationship that had ended badly (to put it mildly). Not only was Draco a co-worker, but he was practically a stranger--they hadn't had a real conversation in more than a decade. They were in public. It could be a trap. Worse, Draco could be under the influence of a mind altering substance!
"I'm more of a show-er than a tell-er," he replied with a smirk of his own. He stood and extended his hand to Draco, tugging him out of the chair and into his chest. He planted a firm kiss on Draco's lips... then led him up four flights of stairs to his bedroom.
He paused for a second to examine Potter's Auror robes, pretending he was deep in thought--as if to recall the details.
For a brief moment, Harry worried about his own balance as the world seemed to tilt on its axis. He decided to go set up the next exercise and use the time to clear his head. It was suddenly rather difficult to string two thoughts together standing that close to the object that had been dominating them of late.
Surprising everyone, Harry included, it was Draco who spoke first, facing down a literal den of lions. "I can assure you all this isn't how we intended to inform you of our relationship," he answered calmly, matching Arthur's tone. Harry nodded emphatically.
Harry grinned. "Are you trying to claim me, then?" He found he didn't mind the idea so much. He wasn't the kind to sleep around while he was seeing someone and it seemed that was what he and Draco were doing. While that hadn't been his intention at the outset--he hadn't had one, really--now that they were there, he was glad to see Draco establishing some boundaries.
Draco opened the fridge to grab a drink of his own. As Harry was lacking anything "frou frou", he settled for making tea instead. He set the boiler on the range after filling it with water and used his wand to light the fire beneath.
"Have you ever heard of a sixty-nine? I had mentioned it before. I wouldn't mind trying that either..."
Harry cleared his throat, suddenly nervous. He'd planned to say this later, but there was no time like the present.
He lifted Harry's hand to his lips and kissed the back, before letting them both drop--still joined--to their sides once more.
Ordinarily, he wouldn't go into the office on a Saturday, but he didn't want to let the waitress lead go cold. So he disentangled himself from Draco, who grumbled and cocooned himself in the blankets. With a chuckle, Harry made his way to the open doorway he assumed led to the bathroom, scooping up his wand on the way.
Draco fell back easily. He immediately wrapped his legs around his lover and hugged the Gryffindor with his entire body. When their kiss broke, he frowned and glared at the Auror.
A matching smile spread across Harry's face. "Gladly," he said, quiet and sincere, before shucking his trousers and pants and crawling over Draco to kiss him soundly.
Potter was warm, possibly from fever, and his skin a slight clammy though still soft to the touch. Draco rubbed the back of his partner's neck and scratched at his somewhat sweaty nape hairs. With his face so close it was easier to see all the shades of green swirling in the sick man's eyes.
"Ahh, stop--wait," Draco gasped as he removed Harry's hand from his cock and gently pulled his other hand from inside him, as pleasant as that felt. They had never come at the same time before, and Draco was determined to change that as he widened his legs and pulled Harry into the cradle of his thighs. Their cocks pressed together as Draco pulled him in and hugged the Auror over his thighs to lock him into place--his hands gripping Harry's shoulders.
He set to work righting upended bottles of ingredients and retrieving lost articles from the floor. Draco was content to sit on his haunches and observe, but with a sudden bolt of panic he yipped at Potter to warn him off of touching any of the tacky dried potion.
He hadn't ruled either Slytherin off his list of suspects or accomplices since they had conveniently disappeared right before the attack and were among the only people who knew about Draco's crush on him. His gut told him not to trust them (though, to be fair, it said that about most Slytherins--present company excluded).
Lucius could tell Harry seethed. The fact that the usually fiery Gryffindor could keep his mouth shut for as long as he did (without interrupting) perhaps indicated Draco's good influence.
"As for position," he began with a thoughtful hum and a grin that could rival the Cheshire Cat's, "Lay on your back with your hands above your head. And remember that you trust me now, or at least I hope you do."
"Sure you were," she smirked. Then, with her characteristic go-getter's attitude, she rubbed her hands together and proclaimed, "All right, boys, what've we got to work with?"
"Come on then," Potter offered, picking him up to cradle in the crook of his arm. Draco allowed it. He was feeling generous. "Are you
as a regular customer), he was not ready to be despoiled in so coarse a manner, and not with an appointment to be kept.
"I meant you feel like you haven't been fucked much," Draco whispered with a hot breath as he leaned his torso across Potter's as much as he could with his hand still thrusting roughly--his breath nearly on the man's ear. "Have you ever been penetrated, Potter? Or do you prefer to do the fucking?"
Draco chuckled as he was hugged close and cuddled. He grabbed Harry's forgotten wand and spelled them clean (without removing his head) before covering them with the sheet and blanket. After, he set the wand under his pillow (an old habit) and slumped into his lover.
"I'm usually better about eating," he said defensively, following Draco to the kitchen. "I had a busy day arresting your former best friend and his sort of girlfriend."
Harry hadn't realized how nice such a trivial kindness would feel until experiencing such a striking lack of it.
It wasn't even noon yet when he heard the rapping of knuckles on his door. Draco was finishing up his second cup of extremely strong tea with a tired glare and pajama bottoms covered in penguins. He hadn't bothered to dress in anticipation of the Auror's visit. Hell, he couldn't fathom why the Auror even wanted to come to his home. If it was "official business" as Potter said it was, Draco thought it might have been more prudent for the man to demand his presence at the Ministry. Not that he was entirely complaining... Despite his annoyance with the hour, he didn't mind a surprise visit from the handsome, gruff Savior.
He went to root through the potions cabinet in his loo--which was rather well stocked--and returned with the requested phial. Draco had propped the tray on his lap and was happily crunching through a rasher of bacon, foregoing the toast and eggs Harry'd made to accompany it.
"Did I report it?" He asked to make certain he heard right as his mind returned to the present. "Why bother? If I reported every incident of attack, why, you might as well arrest all of London!"
Well. If he could be gracious and empathetic with other patients going through similar trials, he could do so for Malfoy. He was a professional, after all.
Draco dispelled the glamour on Harry's neck. The tip of his wand tickled a bruise for just a second before slowly traveling down to the hollow of his throat--down, down to the superficial cleft of his bosom before traveling back up to the Auror's lips.
They'll confiscate it as contraband and try to duplicate it for their own use and profit. Unscrupulous pit vipers.)
He drew his wand out of its holster and held his hand out impatiently for Draco's, conjuring a small puddle of lube in the middle of his palm when it was offered. After casting the necessary protection spells (and nothing else), he set his wand aside and pulled his legs wide with a hand on each knee, offering himself up to the man who had once been his arch nemesis.
He bolted to the kitchen to uncover the source of the commotion with Draco hot on his heels. The smart money was on a pint-sized werewolf with a penchant for mischief. Ten galleons said they would find him with a stock pot on his head and cake ('with
Harry's blood thrummed in his veins. He slicked his prick (breath catching at the feeling of his own hand; this probably wasn't going to last long) and cast the necessary spells. Draco watched him all the while with eyes gone dark and piercing.
But he couldn't have stayed. Harry was already thinking of asking him to move in, unconsciously or not. They hadn't been lovers for very long, not really--it would be too soon. It might not have seemed so strange to Harry, but for Draco he had already accomplished one giant life's goal (the loss of his innocence) recently, and the man didn't love him! Moving in was far too big for them to just jump into. So to spare his gormless lover from that pressure, Draco left.
on the sticking charm holding his mask in place and stuffed it into his coat pocket, thinking that would be enough to convince Draco of his identity and intentions.
, Draco," he panted hoarsely, just before his arms gave out and he collapsed onto Draco's back like a pile of wet laundry.
When Draco called up the stairs to him, playful flirtation evident in his tone, his heart leapt into his throat. The long-forgotten adrenaline rush of breaking all the rules came surging through his veins, making him almost giddy as the anticipation built.
Harry groaned long and loud, heedless of their potential audience, and let his head fall back against the tiles as he tried futilely to catch his breath and keep up with the man who'd come wonderfully alive with that single kiss. He wasn't too worried--from the other gasps and moans echoing in the cavernous space, he and Draco weren't the only ones who'd had the same idea. Merlin, the fallout from this ill-conceived party was going to be disastrous. HR would have their hands full come Monday.
With his fingers still deeply embedded and rubbing circles into Draco's inner wall, Harry leaned forward to lap at and kiss his navel, followed by his pert little nipples. He would have taken Draco's mouth in a kiss next, but sadly his torso just wasn't long enough to reach.
"Let me tell you something, princess," he growled next to Draco's ear, "I don't need a wand to undress you."
Harry wasn’t about to let Malfoy fall into a pity pit. Not now. Not after they’d come so far. "You should take them up again," he said briskly, forestalling an unwanted shift in Malfoy’s mood as well as his own natural curiosity about the revelation (there’d be another opportunity to ask about Malfoy’s apparent artistic side later if he played his cards right). "It's good practice. Now quit stalling and go get changed. It’s workout time.”
"Ha ha," Harry deadpanned, though inside he celebrated the fact Draco was thinking along the same lines as him. Mostly. (You could never be too sure when it came to Draco's thinking.) "Dating me isn't perk enough for you?" he joked.
"I like you," Potter proclaimed. "Rather a lot." Fucking Gryffindors interrupting perfectly good shagging for heartfelt bloody declarations. "This is where I'd usually say something smart like 'Merlin knows why,'" he continued, "but I actually do know. It isn't hard to figure out--you're brilliant and sexy and a right pompous git, but you genuinely care about your students and you're braver than anyone gives you credit for.
Draco quirked a brow and crossed his arms lightly over his bare chest. He took a few steps closer to Potter, though carefully as he was acting much like a scared deer at the moment.
Knowing his fingers were thicker than Draco's and really not wanting to hurt him, Harry pressed the two already poised over his entrance into the burning, clutching, impossibly tight heat.
At the present, Potter was holding him suspended a scant few inches from his face, babbling at him about how he'd love to keep him but that would be unfair to his owner who was probably distraught over losing him, and that he really should put some clothes on and go looking for that person but that Draco was just too adorable to leave, even for a short while.
Draco let go of Harry to brace the counter with both hands as he panted his appreciation. His right leg managed to maneuver its way between Harry's legs now that there was space to do. He slipped his leg between them and press his thigh up into the jutting growth.
He moved into position as Draco directed, stomach twisting with equal parts apprehension and excitement. Somehow he knew that Draco would be crushed if he showed even a moment's hesitation so he swallowed down his anxiety and grasped the slats of his headboard as Draco had done before.
"I think the Spotted dick is a bit tart, but have you tried the French chocolates? I was surprised to see them, considering the budget and all. Not the brand I would have chosen, but decent I suppose."
Harry got himself ready in record time. He didn't know how much leisure constituted 'a bit,' but he didn't want to waste one minute of it--he had an agenda (and books and cards were not on it).
Arthur cleared his throat, capturing the attention of all in attendance. "Come, let's sit," he urged with quiet authority. "Please." He unbuttoned his tweed coat, revealing a pale green waistcoat underneath--threadbare and faded with age and pulled tight over his rounded belly--and seated himself near George. Ready to intervene if necessary, Harry thought.
"Don't start making judgments based on how this looks," he warned. "It's just a convenient apparation point."
"It's part of you and you are worth more than just some thing," Harry replied earnestly, squeezing Draco's shoulders. "Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't deserve one iota of your time or energy. Take that from someone who's dealt with a lifetime of being treated like a commodity. I refuse to do that to someone else and I won't have you acting as if I would. Can you make those promises?"
Harry realized that Malfoy's cocky, irreverent veneer was a mask for the almost crippling fear and sadness that had come to typify his pathetic existence. He was trapped...as much by his fear as the very real threats the outside world posed, all because of that ugly, spiteful scar on his left forearm (barely recognizable now after its connection to its maker had been severed).
Harry rolled up his shirt sleeves and donned an apron. He'd shed his robes while Malfoy slept. He set the kettle to boil and rummaged in the pantry to see what he had on hand that would be quick and easy.
Malfoy smirked down at him but refrained from commenting. It seemed Harry’s willingness to indulge his whims had earned him at least a modicum of goodwill. It was a shame to cash it in so soon...but such was life.
"Well," he said, turning to leave for the second time, "Goodnight, Malfoy." (He'd considered adding a 'nice to see you,' or something like it, but that wasn't true.)
"Merlin, Mordred, and Morgana!" Harry exclaimed, jumping up from the sofa (causing his unopened package to tumble to the floor). "What
"Come with me," he directed, nodding toward the basin. "Two pairs of eyes are better than one and it will be helpful for the memory to be fresh in your mind if I have any follow-up questions for you. I have a calming draught in my desk if you need," he added as an afterthought.
Merlin, he was so fucking hot. Harry let his eyes roam greedily over Draco's body and felt a little lightheaded from the swift exodus of blood from his brain.
He was still pompous, entitled, and pratty, of course, but he was a fair sight less evil. He did a lot of good for the world, in fact, in his post as the Prophet's official Ministry reporter. Go figure, right? Who would have believed five years ago that
By his wide, slightly glazed eyes and the pink flush in his cheeks, Draco appeared either horny or just this side of panicked. Context clues suggested the latter, but the former was generally a safe bet with him. Who knew--it could be both.
flatmate is at work. Not that I give a damn what you two do as long you stay away from my room when you do it. Most of the furniture is yours, anyway. It's not my business what incurable diseases you choose to expose yourself to.
Malfoy smirked and crossed his arms loosely before him, looking for all the world like a kneazle with a mouse between its paws.
He pulled Draco against his chest and apparated them before he could argue. They arrived with a loud pop in a dirty alleyway just down the street from his favourite fish and chips stall.
"Now, gentlemen," Arthur said, making eye contact with the both of them, "if you'd like us all to leave, we can. I understand that you weren't...expecting company." A muscle in his jaw jumped when he said that bit and Harry wondered if he was speaking through gritted teeth. "It seems as though you might have more to say, however." With a pointed look at his sons, who were the most likely to dispute the claim, he asserted, "We are ready to listen."
Harry grinned down at the adorably pouting man below him, arms braced on either side of his head. "You might like it better when I tell you my plan was for
"Well, if you can handle it I certainly can," Draco said with mock pompousness. He tugged Harry's hand over gently and kissed the back of his hand, then bit his thumb--just before slipping the digit into his mouth. He suckled on it until it was nearly numb before releasing it and settling their hands back down on Harry's thigh.
I didn't realize you watched me so closely on the pitch. Flying is probably my all-time favourite thing about being a wizard. If I could do it without a broom, I would.
"I insulted him," he elaborated, hoping to get the conversation done with as quickly as possible. And with a minimum of bloodshed.
And how nice it was that Potter and what Draco assumed to be his Weasel friends were in a group just behind him! What a coincidence.
Harry suppressed a sigh. It was his fault, he supposed. Draco'd been in a right sunny mood when he arrived. But he was bloody hungry. It wasn't fair to hold him accountable for things said and done when he was running on biscuits and tea fumes.
Malfoy was unpredictable. Waspish. Prone to fits of temper and bitter cold that left Harry feeling alternately dumbfounded, irritable, and on edge.
Harry shuddered and spasmed as he came deep into Draco's ready throat. He stopped bobbing to suckle on the head and greedily devour the seed that spilled forth--like a man in the desert without water. Once he knew for certain Harry was emptied, Draco pulled off and sat back on his haunches with a smug smirk--lips red and eyes glazed.
"You really did miss me," Draco breathed as he lifted up the blanket just high enough to see the action going on beneath. It wasn't the first time someone had his cock in their mouth, but it was the first time Draco felt like he might cum (like a teenager) just from watching. "Ohhh, fuck... Feels so good..."
Draco dragged Harry's bottom lip into his mouth for a quick suckle. He licked the darkening skin before releasing it with a gasp. He leaned forward to breathe into the Auror's ear.
"That's up to you, Harry," Draco purred in response as he leaned forward just enough to plant his hands on his lover's broad shoulders. "I certainly don't mind. I like the sensation of being filled when it's with a partner I like... So, just you, then."
"My first time was excellent and I am quite glad I waited, but I doubt it would have been anything less even if it wasn't--considering my partner." Draco cast his eyes upward at last and grinned.
It had taken the better part of the day, but they were able to track down the culprit--the victim's own brother, who'd developed a nasty (and expensive) potions habit and was desperate enough for his next fix to risk his brother's life to get it. It was depressing.
relaxed he'd start to feel that way. "I just have to show you how. And I get patients who wouldn't take me seriously if I dressed any more casually, even if it would make my job easier."
From the vantage of the apparation point, the Hall wasn't visible. Harry was glad--he wanted to get a good look at Draco's reaction when they came around the corner. (For all that Draco had grown out of the majority of his bigoted beliefs, he still thought muggles were substandard in the cultural domain.)
With an unqualified grin, Mike prepared their order and handed over two hot paper cones, heaped with golden brown fish and perfect salty crisps. Harry thanked him and lead Draco away a few paces. "Do you want to walk and eat, find a place to sit, or head back home?"
It's novelty lube, you moron. Blaise finds it amusing. Doesn't your Weasley's joke shop carry a similar product? Just get your rocks off and be done with it.
One hand continued to wash the man's back, gliding smoothly over the knobs of his spine, as the other wrapped around Harry's waist and tugged gently at the trail of hair below his navel.
Harry knew this was coming. Draco had been silently and impatiently willing him to hurry up and finish for the last several minutes so they could move on to the afters he had planned, but Harry was not going to rush his dessert. It was too good for that--it deserved to be savoured.
Draco tensed a moment when he felt a hand descend on his head--he considered it the height of impropriety when someone tried to direct him with pressure on his skull. But the hand was light and still; Potter simply wanted to touch him more, it seemed, which was agreeable.
"You asked about them!" He reminded with a laugh after they apparated, but seemed to consent. The Slytherin allowed himself to be dragged into the home and toward the upstairs bedroom.
"You've had an exhausting and emotionally-trying morning," he responded, as reasonably as he could manage. "Let's get you home so you can sleep it off."
There was also--and he really didn't like thinking about this--the distinct possibility it had been rather too convenient to reject Malfoy himself than risk the possibility of being rejected by someone he'd taken a bit too keen an interest in of late. (Hermione had
"Thanks," Harry said sheepishly, catching a wayward drop of water at the corner of his mouth. His voice remained hoarse even after the thoughtful drink.
Draco gasped as Harry thrust and rutted against him like a needy animal. The heat between his legs and the noises Harry made (the pleading alone was so incredibly hot) had his prick considering to hardening again, but he knew nothing could come of it. Instead, he chuckled, sat up straight, and pressed his full weight onto Harry's cock like he had done before. This time, however, he merely held Harry's hips to anchor himself, content to let the Auror squirm and buck and finish himself off beneath Draco while he watched.
Harry grinned. Drunk compliments were the best compliments, in his opinion, because they were the most honest. Draco wasn't truly drunk--which was incredible given the amount of alcohol he'd consumed--but he was certainly buzzed. His body was loose, his smile easy, and his compliments free-flowing.
, princess," he pointed at the wok with his elbow, "is a teriyaki stir-fry. You don't have to eat it if you don't want it. But I'm of a mind to withhold dessert if you don't."
It felt strange to be standing in Malfoy Manor in nothing but his socks, pants, and bandages. And it was quickly going to become stranger still, he thought ruefully, as he availed himself of the closer of the two settees to begin unwinding the elastic bandages wrapped securely around his upper thigh.
When Draco put it that way, Harry did want to stay and play. It's not like he had an official start time compelling him to go--it was his day off, after all.
"Now," he said, untucking and unbuttoning his shirt as he spoke (he'd lost the jacket at some point but he had no idea when), "I'm only going to ask this once and I will accept any answer you give--" he tossed the shirt off the side of the bed and set to work on his belt and the fastenings of his trousers.
His neck flexed almost painfully, craning his head backwards into Draco's shoulder as his whole body bent like a bow. His fingers scrabbled for purchase on the slick tiles and he came on a hoarse cry, relying heavily on Draco's arms for support lest he crumple to the floor.
Draco not growing his hair past his collarbones seemed like a rather arbitrary distinction to him, but if it helped the man feel like more of an independent agent from his father, then it was grand. The length was more similar to Lucius's style than Harry preferred, but it wasn't his business to say so. Still, if Draco would rather have it short, it was a shame that he had no good options to make that happen. At least none he thought were viable.
"I assume you mean the needle incident? Quite a strange instrument, a muggle syringe. Normally magic would destroy certain muggle technologies, but a syringe is manual--metal and plastic. No mechanics involved... Almost unassuming and so tiny. You can probably imagine how surprised I was to learn about it."
Harry hastily looked away, gulping nervously. Malfoy seemed totally oblivious to the show he was putting on (and the effect it was having on him).
Draco didn't wait for an answer. He dove back onto Harry's cock until he was nearly at the hilt--constricting his throat and moaning obscenely against the flesh. His finger slipped inside carefully until it was sheathed to the third knuckle.
to remind me of), I don't look particularly nice while wearing Flu Green, capiche? For you it doesn't matter, but I have far more dignity.
"I get why you might not tell us while things were still...unofficial," Hermione chimed in (not sounding she 'got it' very much at all), "but how could you not think of us in the three months since then?"
Truth be told, he did look slightly ridiculous in such a casual and ill-fitting outfit, but who cared? It was just them in the house. Plus there was something appealing about Draco in Harry's clothes.
And I meant "indulge" the same way I used the word "spoilt" about myself. Your father was spoilt just as I was and grew to be as much of a prat because of it, but then changed for the better by seventh year. (I don't know what changed him, I just know what I've been told.) Your grandparents were old enough to be
"I'll enjoy the view from this safe distance all the same," Harry replied, smiling around the tines of his fork (as he'd immediately chased the statement with a bite of rich, buttery salmon). He sighed with pleasure and settled back against the cushion, crossing his legs in front of him and forgetting the cares of the day.
Unlike certain Slytherins (nearly all of them), I'm not the kind to use blackmail. I promise not to speak of anything you write to me.
He hoped that by the time their reservation rolled around he wouldn't look still so thoroughly shagged.
The scientific part of his mind surmised that their activities must have burned through more than just their combined magical energy stores. It seemed that the effect, whatever its cause, was fuelled by calories, as well. As this was another fact Hermione would want to know, Harry added it to his ever-increasing mental list of things to report. (The particular curvature of the underside of Malfoy’s arse as seen from below was on a separate list entitled “Things Harry Would Not Be Reporting To Anyone Ever.”)
Draco jumped as Blaise fell backwards into the wall. The punch had been so loud it echoed slightly in the large entrance hall. The blonde was simmering with rage (it had been a volcanic eruption, until he watched his former "best friend" get so beautifully smacked.) It took a minute after they had apparated to realize they were no longer at the restaurant and instead in front if his own door.
Malfoy's eyes wavered. Harry guessed he wanted to check him over for visible disability but for whatever reason the Slytherin held the eye contact instead. It both compelled Harry to speak and made it harder for him to do so.
Draco released the headboard when given permission. He grabbed for Harry's shoulders and pulled him down into a longer, tongue delving kiss--nipping his lips before pulling away and laying back down properly.
"There's a lot about him that would surprise you if you'd just give him a chance," Harry replied, some of his anger giving way to hurt. Ron must have a rather low estimation of him to think he would be dating Draco if he were no different from the slimy, cowardly, bigoted tosser he'd been in school.
"Why? Because I like you," he said, as if it were obvious. "I want this thing we might be growing to flourish and bloom. I want to get to know the man known as Harry Potter and decipher him from the boy I knew. I want this to be something real and far from fleeting... I want us to date, have fights, make up, take naps, and, yes, rut and experiment and have sex. But I don't want the latter to be our main component.
Whereas the downstairs of the house was chic and modern, Draco's room would have been right at home in Hogwarts' dungeons.
My point is, I didn't see this as anything other than normal and acceptable, though now I realize differently. But I still have difficulty recognizing...shall we say, problematic parenting choices.
"Feel free," he breathed, almost dismayed, as his gaze locked upon the sight. He noted a slight hesitation in the normally confident man and smiled at the reminder that Harry hadn't done this before.
. Harry did like it. So much so that his bollocks drew up tight against his body (quickly enough to make him somewhat queasy) as he careened toward the precipice at a breakneck pace.
"Really? That's it? You don't remember how to feed yourself? I knew I should start sending you lunches, and as punishment I shall send them with sappy notes that I hope all your colleagues read."
"Didn't think so," Potter replied. "In that case, we'll detour to the Headmistress' Office to fire-call Hermione before heading to the Dungeons. Unless you object to that plan?"
"Apparently the only publications to have mentioned me are Witch Weekly and The Prophet. One refers to me as some lost prince type and the other still speculates as to what my illegal activities must be while I'm hiding. Which have you been reading?"
, but something like it. Directed at Harry. Malfoy's infrequent quips and even rarer smiles came more easily. (Not
"I fear to tell you, but I have never cooked steak," Draco admitted as he took Harry's beer (he didn't snatch it, just pulled it away casually) and drank a quick swig. He nearly wretched, shoving it back at him and coughing. "H-How can--uck--how can you
Cursing the fates for their unceasingly cruel sense of humour, Draco resolved to make the long trek to the first floor for the Gryffindor Head's Office. It was small consolation that he wouldn't have to go all the way across the castle or up too many of its one hundred forty two staircases in search of aid. The journey would be perilous enough as it was. He hoped against hope Mrs. Norris III wasn't out patrolling the halls or that he encountered any errant students on the way. Merlin forbid he be mistaken for a pet. Or worse--vermin.
Draco smirked, though it was more appreciative instead of taunting or playful. He placed both his hands on the Auror's cheeks, his thumb playing across Potter's cheekbones.
"I want you to fuck me with your fingers, Harry," he purred. "I want you to finish me off. I'll do you after if you're good."
"I didn't see it as a big deal," Draco said honestly. "I didn't think. I guess I'm just so used to being told... and observing that sex wasn't much of anything for people that I forgot there is a difference between real consent and what is essentially prostitution. That's why I'm apologizing. But no one else has ever told me or made me feel like my body was worth more than just... I don't know, a
