“Fine,” the devil heaves out a put-upon sigh. “I should’ve done the old ‘do not be afraid’ routine. I forgot. Are you happy now?”

“So Harry sold his soul for nothing?” Draco asks, granola bar forgotten for a moment.
“You’re welcome to try,” the devil tells him cordially enough. “Draco, how much longer are you going to have a bout of hysteria? I want to bet on who will win today’s quiz show.”
“Does Bartemius have a form like
His stomach drops and his skin feels much too thin all of a sudden, his bones waver and bend and he is absolutely overwhelmed in a way he has never been before in his whole life.
“Me going away wouldn’t change a thing,” the demon tells him, tilting his head to keep watching Barty giving a correct answer and slurping down an acid-spitting snake with his huge bird beak. “Harry signed his soul away.”
had to go and squeeze a prophecy out of that Trelawney woman, so here we are,” the Thing huffs, visibly bored by the conversation. “Just accept that you got tangled up with a war criminal in your youth and probably killed your own sister, and then
“Why are you eating?” Draco narrows his eyes, but not a lot. If he will be eaten alive by a bloody demon, this is probably the right time for it anyway. “You never eat.”
“A moderately unpleasant evening with your parents,” the Thing responds, and apparently he has a human face and is on a first-name basis with Draco’s parents, because
devil?”
“You picked Harry,” Dumbledore narrows his eyes, bright blues turning frosty all of a sudden while he completely ignores the accusation of making up a prophecy that killed Harry’s parents. “You approached him with a contract!”
“I can feel your sneaky little glances,” the Thing tells him, eyes glued to the telly, “and it was a one-time thing. Be glad I tolerate you taking up an armrest.”
“Yeah,” the devil says nonchalantly, like the implications of that fact don’t trouble him at all. And, to be fair, they likely don’t.
“I thought it would disappear!” Draco shrieks, waving his hand towards the Thing, still with its unsettlingly handsome face. “I didn’t know it could do
“Would you stop talking about fucking practice for a second?!” Harry yells, voice not at all distorted by their phones. It’s exactly as if he were standing right next to Draco, screaming into his ear. “We’re headed for eternal damnation because of a bloody prophecy and you—”
“He isn’t talking to you,” the Thing shouts back, ignoring Draco’s form carefully creeping closer.
Draco gulps.
“Yes.”
his parents open the door and enter the living room.
Harry opened the letter and read through it three times without taking a single word in. then he sat down on the sofa, closed and opened his eyes a couple of times, slapped himself once to Hermione’s incredulous gasp and tried to concentrate again. It was a very short letter, written in a shaky and jittery hand. “Are we sure it’s really from him, Professor?”
Words failed him for a moment. “You what?” then he regrouped. “I don’t love you. I can’t love you.”
For a second he had to close his eyes, the feeling was so unnerving. Once again it was a mistake; the moment he did so the weapons began to speak to him, whispering in terrible hisses of the misfortune they brought countless others. He nearly covered his ears with his hands, willing the curse to pass, for he knew it was only a game his father was playing with him. Without much thinking he grabbed Granger’s hand and pressed softly. He didn’t know if she is also prey to these nightmares, or if his father is torturing him alone. He did not turn to look at her face. She pressed back.
He turned to him, wild with excitement, frantic with all this goodness. Softly tugging a lock of hair behind his ear, loving him so much, so fucking much –
“I don’t…”
“That’s not true. It’s not. You’re lying, same as always.” Draco had to bite down the whine, because he won’t cry now, he refused. This was just another lie, he won’t fall for it, he simply won’t.
“Why’s that? Because you don’t know me either?” Harry’s voice was bitter and cold, and Draco had to tell himself twice it’s just his disappointment, because
Draco shook his head. “Why are you here, Potter? Married or not, you must still have
“Yes,” Harry said, and he couldn’t help but laugh at his expression. “You, sleep here. It’s creepy down there all alone, you’ve said it yourself, and I’m getting kind of lonely up here as well. Don’t worry though, no funny business. You can bring your own sheets too if you’d like.”
The alarm went off exactly as the helicopter lifted off the ground. Draco turned his stopper watch back to zero, definitely smiling.
A spell was cast; he felt the whoosh of magic and suddenly there was marvelous warmth in his knees, spreading from their center to his whole body. Draco uttered a startled gasp, closing his eyes, committing to this magnificent sensation. Quite often he needed healing, and he was frequently provided it, but this spell he did not remember feeling. It passed through every nerve, muscle and blood vessel in him, vibrating with energy that was both sweet and intense. Draco did not know he could have it until it filled him in every possible way, fizzing like soda. Maybe he was making this up, but from behind his closely-shut eyelids he thought he could see a light shining very near, almost like it was emanating from his very body.
, he was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted. So he grabbed Harry in two bloodied hands, knife pressing against the palm of one, and kissed him. Fuck everything else. This could have actually been worth it.
He thought he had a pretty good chance.
“No, I don't think so. However if you do not mean to hit me anymore, I think we'd better get back to the pans, before Filch returns and gives us another night in detention. Because believe it or not, Potter, but I actually don’t want to spend any unnecessary second more with you.”
like he jokingly said sometimes in his head. It’s not like he could really, actually call him – he was Potter, just Potter. Always Potter, which on its own was already too much. He couldn’t very well be
“So sorry.” How could he make him see? Harry would never understand he had no choice. The screams inside his head made it nearly impossible to hear what he was saying.
He was surprised when Malfoy plopped back on the seat and took off his shirt. Harry was sure he would want to do it somewhere more private, his room for instance. He couldn’t help but look again at the colorful chest in front of him. It was as mesmerizing as it was gruesome.
“No,” Bellatrix said harshly. “You are not allowed. You know I will not hesitate to punish you.”
rather brilliant, weren’t they?” Daniel asked.
“Harry, none of that matters. Suppose I said it, it doesn’t… it doesn’t mean anything.
He shrugged. “There’s still a lot of work to do on the house. You’ve seen it yourself, it’s a mess.”
“And you are quite certain you are not developing any – “
“Do you love me?”
“Sure,” he said, hardly aware of what he was saying. Bending under the table as if to tie his shoelace, he got the cloak he had stashed under his robes and covered himself. He glanced around cautiously; no one had seen. With a great sigh of relief he made his way out of the hall, very careful not to touch anyone, not to attract any attention. He had the sinking feeling that a certain pair of blue eyes was following him around the room, but there was no way Dumbledore could see through the cloak, and he carried on mercilessly. He will not stay here a minute longer, he will not listen to whatever it is the old man has to say, he will not look at the dreary Potions master seated to his left – he will not, he will not, he will not. Slowly pushing the doors and sliding through them without causing a commotion, Harry found himself out of the Hall, shaking.
Draco blinked some more. “Why?” he asked, so lost. His father was right there, and his face looked like his world was crashing all around him, like it was ending. Maybe it was. Draco didn’t know anything anymore. He was so lost. “Why are you doing this?”
“After you were already declared dead? What, is it a Muggle tattoo?”
“No, I didn’t,” Draco said, very quietly. “I had no idea. I thought you ran away that night because you didn’t want me. I thought I ruined everything. That’s why I was so upset when you came over on Friday.”
“You don’t understand,” Grove begged –
“Yes, Sir, yes. Please.” Without meaning to he nuzzled against the hand, and it must have been working, because He let him.
honour, and if I’m going to cook I will make the main course. Why don’t
“What do you want from me?” Draco asked, unsure, and he lost the butterfly outside. His voice was so uneven.
His breath hitched when the blond opened his mouth as if he was trying to swallow him whole. He wasn’t too far off, Harry suspected, or at least he would have if he were able to form a coherent thought. He was breathless and sweaty and dizzy. The miraculous, flexible tongue drove flaming arrows down his spine as it engulfed him, running over the head, up and down it. Every movement Malfoy’s mouth made sparked every nerve in his body, and his muscles were seizing up uncontrollably. He couldn’t fight as his hips fought to thrust forward into him, as his legs shot sideways. His hands fell down to the sofa, fingers grabbing the material like a lifeline. “Fuck, Malfoy,” he mumbled, unable to contain himself any longer, then he gave a loud moan, sinking lower on the couch, shivering. “Fuck!”
“You need to try and act more like him,” he whispered urgently to the giant boy. “Try walking less stiffly. Think as if – as if you’ve never had a proper thought in your life, and your biggest fear is cursive.” Ron smirked at him through Goyle’s ugly face.
“My mother,” he said at once, not meeting any of their gazes. “Is she – what exactly happened to her?”
“I was never my own, Harry. That’s why I can’t give you – that’s why I can’t love anyone else. I’d always be His. I’m sorry.”
There were far more important things to do. For example; sitting by the lake with Draco, Ron and Hermione, making fun of Ron for his fear of the giant squid. Holding Draco’s hand in the corridors. Visiting Hagrid for some terrible scones. Flying with Ron and Draco in the Quidditch pitch. Kissing Draco every single opportunity he got.
“Yes, with his friends. Lupin, and Sirius, and… Wormtail.”
“While all this time…” Harry buried his face in his hands, and not seeing the pain in his eyes made it easier in a way, and harder in another.
Potter’s confusion looked very grim. “Is that – are you saying – what are you saying, exactly?”

to the sitting room – actual running, bad knees can fuck themselves – only stopping inches from Potter’s nose. Then, because his heart did not allow for anything else, he simply threw himself into Potter’s arms, effectively pushing him back into the fire where the edge of his trousers started to smoke. Potter chuckled, lifted Draco slightly in the air and took a careful step away from the flames. He then proceeded to crush him, sighing in relief or contentment or whatever else, and with the lack of the ability to breathe came the first semblance of calm Draco had all day.
was he thinking? Feeling like – like
it. He was familiar with it, gods be damned. And then Harry Bloody Potter had to come and tear it wide open, changing absolutely everything. Everything! Not a single thing was still in its place inside Draco’s head, and he didn’t know what to do with this new world he suddenly found himself in. He did not understand its rules and could not protect himself from its lashes. He didn’t even know who the hell he was in it. Not in the broad, more general sense, and not in the very necessary, specific sense. Was he the man who kneeled in a frosty Azkaban cell, or the man who saved Harry Potter’s life? Was he the worthless sack of shit who belonged on the floor, or very much a human being fit to lie on something made especially for him? Was he His, His and His alone, or the man who kissed Potter? Who, in the name of Merlin’s soggy pants, was he?
not to mention to the whole world’s wickedness, asking me if you are getting into
“What the hell is that?” Draco gapes, staring gobsmacked at the large flatscreen.
“I’m very good at deception,” the Thing tells him, its voice cold and strangely clear, like the words aren’t spoken into air but into Draco’s very thoughts. He is just about to loose his bloody mind and scream, when he manages to remind himself of the anger management exercises he’s been doing at his therapist’s behest.
“No,” the devil huffs. “They’ve never quite liked that.”
“We’re trying to figure out how to vanquish you, Mr. Voldemort.”
Draco knows he will not be taken into heaven to dissolve into that peaceful-sounding unity the devil mentioned; he pays his taxes, yes, he does better now, yes, but the world is unfair or else all humans would go to heaven. Or else maybe humans wouldn’t even exist, to experience the many pains and hurts of life.
to ignore him. There is the slightest hint of a smirk on that terrifying face, and Draco knows that for all his serpentine looks, the Thing is as sly as a cat. There is no way it doesn’t know that he is getting nearer and nearer, and it probably revels in the gnawing fear that wars with unholy desperation in Draco’s mind.
“So you wanted me to go insane?”
“Are you going to
“Why would I be happy?” Draco wheezes, mind reeling with trying to comprehend something it was never meant to.
my parents dying?” Harry glares at Dumbledore.
the words appear in a neat, spidery script on top of the menu, and now Draco can cross off ‘being called a bellend by a hungry demon’ from his nonexistent bucket list.
Some more words appear on the laminated sheet.
He doesn’t see the devil. At all. He sees the goddamn universe and he understands that what he is perceiving is everything, but the devil was there when there was nothing, nothing but beings like the devil.
“Because you’re evil?” Draco guesses, as the Thing seems to be in a good mood. His questions are usually met with snark, ominous statements about the state of his immortal soul, or derisive silence.
“So you’re not powerful,” Draco guesses, although he is reasonably sure that he’s right. Powerful demons are on demon quiz shows, not waiting for Thai takeaway on the couch of gay Englishmen.
His mind keeps trying to figure out how it all
The panic attacks stop in a month, and in another Draco begins to reject dinner invitations from his parents, from the people with whom he’s only ever talked because they ran in the same circles and it would’ve been rude not to, from people who could help him gain influence.
Harry, half-asleep on the couch, shudders at the sound of the door slamming closed, and blinks at Draco like he has no idea where he is. The demon doesn’t look away from the telly, which is showing—
Draco dry heaves in humiliation.
“You’re taking the piss,” Draco declares, to no one in particular, entering the kitchen one morning and getting a slight heart attack that he is way too young for.
“Because his panic attack started when you apparently showed him your true form!”
“Er,” Draco's fingers fumbled with the bracelet. “I’m not very good at it either.”
This was the very definition of a nightmare; the table was sticky, the floor was grimy, and the back of the seat was covered in something highly unpleasant. Even his glass – containing
“I don’t know about this, Harry,” Hermione said as she looked down at her now complete essay. “I just really don’t think you should get involved. He told you he didn’t want you to, anyway. Can you imagine if the situation was reversed, and Malfoy would be offering to help you? You’d be so angry, you’d curse him right there and then.”
Draco gave a sad little snort. “You only fell for me because you saw me as a victim. Just as he intended. You thought I needed your help, and that made you open up to me. You wouldn’t give me a second glance if I wasn’t in so much pain back then.”
“He will not leave until he is satisfied. I’m afraid there really isn’t any other choice. You do know whom it is we are dealing with here – I daresay you know very well. You have shared much with me over the years, after all. He will not leave before he knows more, and there isn’t much we can do about him on our own. You will have to tell him - not about us, of course. About Azkaban.”
“All right, but still… buying property is a momentous occasion, Mr. Too Rich for His Own Good. We should do something about it.”
Locks of dark hair danced as Harry shook his head. “I’ll take you to my place. It’s warded, no one can get inside. You’ll be safe there. He won’t be able to find you.”
Draco’s eyes widened, and for a second his face was so hurt, Harry was actually ashamed of himself. “It wasn’t like that,” he insisted, and Harry believed him.
Draco scoffed. Hard. “Pansy? A Death Eater? She was never. What utter rubbish.”
“Well, it wasn’t exactly because of them this time. It was more of a… me thing. I wasn’t really in a mood to tolerate anyone, especially not my horrid relatives.”
“What’s going on, Harry? Are you okay?” Neville asked, breathless. Obviously he was expecting some kind of a fight from the boy he was holding, but Malfoy was still in his hands, trying to catch his breath. He looked at Harry with such rage, such loathing, that he found himself actually taking a step back.
“No, that’s not really how he operates.” There was darkness in the grey eyes, darkness and a sort of hollowness that unsettled Harry. “He did it in his usual manner, Potter. By torture.”
“All year you’ve been pretending to suck at these lessons, when actually you could have gotten it on your first try?”
“We have to think of a plan,” Harry said, and he was just unable to look at her. “We have to find a way – maybe they don’t know it’s not me yet, maybe Voldemort isn’t there still – “
Harry frowned. “What do you think he’ll do, exactly? Wandless and bound, what threat does he pose? He’s a mess, Draco. If anything, he’s the one who should be worried. After the last time I’d seen him… I really don’t think he’d risk meeting me again unless he had something real to say.”
But that was a wrong choice of words, because
right here in the corridor – he had to do
He covered his eyes with one hand so he wouldn’t cry and pushed the other fist into his mouth.
“It could still take a few hours before you feel any change,” Hermione came to her senses. “Perhaps we should plan for what happens if… you know.”
Harry had the grace to blush a little. “I didn’t mean it. Not really. You’re… you’re not my favorite person by far, but you’re nothing like him. You’re nothing like Voldemort.”
“Because I wanted to,” the boy whispered, smiling. Harry could feel that smile piercing right through him. He looked at the grey eyes, and Malfoy’s smell was still so strong in his nostrils, he wanted nothing more than just to lean forward and –
was staring at him shamelessly, he just wasn’t sure he could face what would be waiting for him behind those doors. He hadn’t seen Dumbledore since their very heated conversation in the end of last year, and wasn’t sure he’s up to facing those blue eyes again. And then on top of that there was the face that haunted his waking hours, with the black eyes and the greasy hair… he just wasn't certain he would be able to see Snape without attacking.
. And killed, He killed them all, He killed all of them because – because – a wave of hatred so powerful nearly made him topple off the sofa, intertwined with guilt, crushing guilt, so intense it was practically sizzling. They’re dead because of him. Because he was too stupid to follow a simple rule. Because he didn’t know anything, couldn’t tell right from wrong, couldn’t bloody do one thing right. A stupid, stupid piece of shit, a filthy whore, he did this – he did all this. He…
with it. He didn’t know his heart can do this weird, warm dance it was currently performing.
Draco shook his head. “No. Harry. You're – no.”
“No, Harry. I should be thanking you.” And because he didn’t know how to say it, he scooched a little closer to Harry’s maddeningly-warm body on the sofa. “Thank you.”
“If you want to come with me, I’ve got a Portkey ready. But you don’t have to – “
“Me too,” Draco whispered, leaning against him with his throat all constricted. It was somewhat true. And besides, he would cut himself
The hand left his face abruptly. “Go to the kitchen. In the third cupboard you will find a can. Bring it here.”
He followed her back to the living room, where she took a small folder out of her bag. “I have it, what you’ve asked me to look into. The magic is fairly complex, but there are a few specialists who deal with those kind of incantations – I’ve added the list in the end. As for designs… well, they each have their own unique style, so I’ve attached a sample for each name. But I do think that, if you wanted, it would be best for you to come up with something on your own.”
Then it was the next day, because for some reason that was the way these things worked, and Draco found himself standing outside a big black door deep under the Ministry. Harry had Grove transported to the courts’ holding cell from Azkaban, because Harry could do anything. Draco was extra grateful for it now; he was quite sure he wouldn’t be able to go back to Azkaban to save his life, maybe not even Harry’s. It was also very helpful Harry was given permission to use the restricted Floo, so they didn’t meet anyone on their way from the cottage. This was probably as good as Draco could hope for. Only now they were outside the interrogation room, and he didn’t know what to do with himself anymore.
“Ah, you know,” the golden-haired boy smiled a little wanly. “Fighting with me Ma all summer so she’d let me back in this year. Thankfully I was able to convince her that Hogwarts was the safest place with Dumbledore here, and all.”
open this stupid cleaning product, no matter how he tried. He spun and swung and hit and tapped and nothing, nothing,
“No, Draco, wait. I meant not on the rug as it is, but of course you can stay. Let me just – “ he grabbed his wand and started swishing it around, and Draco was too confused at first to understand what on earth was happening. So he’s not getting banished? He doesn’t need to leave? “I was never the best at Transfiguration, and right now let’s blame it on the injury too, yeah? My, that’s some shoddy work. But do you think it’s…. do you think it will do for tonight?”
Draco looked like Draco now. His skin was its normal pale, his wounds and bruises and cuts healed and gone. Since Harry never left his side he saw and even helped Madam Pomfrey change Draco’s dressings, wash him, feed him. He loved taking care of him, if only Draco would wake up. There was so much he wanted to tell him, so much he wanted to ask, and so much he needed to see. Harry’s nights were an uncomfortable array of blurry nightmares and cold sweat. His nightmares weren’t even about the torture he’d suffered, which he would at least be able to understand. Instead they were – he could only assume – the things he imagined Voldemort did to Draco. It was hazy, because he really had no idea, but it left him panting and shivering and even shrieking sometimes. Madam Pomfrey insisted he would take a potion for his dreams because, she claimed, “she wasn’t able to sleep with all the racket he made every night”. Still she said it in a very soft tone, and she didn’t force him to leave, so he took it. It didn’t really help.
There were too many feelings in his chest as his father got to his feet and turned to face them. Somewhere in him there was still the boy who loved him fully, unconditionally. The boy who admired him and was ever so proud. The boy who thought everything Lucius did was for his own good in the end, that it came from a place of honor and respect and even love. But then there was also the boy who was hurt… his shame and confusion, always disappointing, never good enough… fear, definite fear, gut-wrenching and all-consuming… Draco swallowed hard. This was it now. This was it.
“How did you do it, then? Move on?” Draco tried not to let his interest show too much. Perhaps Golden Boy has something that can help him, too.
“Yeah, I know. But he really has changed, and you’ve been getting along fine with him recently, so I guess he can’t be as big of a prat as we always assumed.” Ron smiled. “Could have been worse. I don’t think I'd say the same if it was Goyle, for example.”
“Draco,” the headmaster said nonetheless, “I am sure you have a lot of questions.”
His breathing was hard, his chest was solid, and Harry just wasn’t getting it. He was still kneeling there with him, like he did ages ago in this very place, and Draco simply and painfully wanted to die. The attack was still coming out of him in vengeful speed: “What is it that you want from me, exactly? You want me to be all broken up so you could be the hero? You want me to slash myself open for you so you could save me? Fuck off, Harry! I don’t want you to save me, even if you could! I will never let you, never, ever! I hate you, after everything you’ve done to me, I hate you so much, I fucking hate you – “
“See what?”
There wasn’t much to say after that, even if Draco’s throat wasn’t completely blocked, and so they just sat in a rather uncomfortable silence. Therefore when Potter suggested Draco went for a shower, he jumped at the opportunity. He’d not had a proper wash since he arrived Saturday night, just the odd scrub down a sink. Potter’s shower was old and rusty, but it had scalding hot water, and it was exactly what Draco needed. He spent a long while under the stream – possibly too long, he didn’t know if the hot water was provided magically or not – and came out red-skinned and most likely sporting some burns. Potter loaned him a few garments to wear – the trousers were too short so his ankles showed, and the shirt sleeves ended a little before his wrists, but they all smelled like
Ron shrugged again, and Harry found that he was actually starting to believe him. “Yep. Got no problems here. Although you should know that if he ever does anything to hurt you, I’d turn him right back into the ferret he always was.”
Potter nodded gravely. “They don’t, er, appreciate all of our methods. There’s a standing joke about the state of my reports being – really, they can be so nitpicky sometimes. But overall they’re pretty nice.”
It was frighteningly silent on the radio, only some indiscernible mutterings. Draco couldn’t draw a single breath. Then an odd noise emerged in his earpiece; was it… laughter?
There
“Please,” Draco said in a constricted voice. “Please. Let me go on my own.”
“Are you feeling okay?” he asked tentatively. The blond shrugged.
listen to whatever rumbling confession the man wants to fake, and since there was no possible chance in hell he won’t use it to tear Harry to pieces – what could Draco do? How can he stop this, how can he protect him? What could he do to ensure Harry’s life isn’t shot as well as his, that he can leave this interview and still be able to close his eyes without having to see it? How can he keep him safe?
When “I sacrificed everything for you, Draco. Everything. I had to change my whole life, risk imprisonment, spend the remainder of my days on the run, but I did it for you. You killed Grove – you killed him, Draco, do you hear me? You killed a man. Things can no longer continue as they were before. But I’m here, I’ll always be here for you. I will protect you. I will keep you safe.” But –
be clear, though: if you fight me, I will not be the one to pay the price. And neither will you, before you say anything. I don’t suppose you want me to show you what I can do to Draco if I truly intended to hurt him? I promise you I had been very restrained in regards to him until now.”
But seeing Pansy like that, unprompted, was a punch straight to the face, and the memory could not be fought. Draco sighed and closed his eyes, but even Potter’s smile wavered. He’d done so well not to think about her recently. He used to do it a lot back in the day, and now… not so much anymore. He didn’t even have his single pansy by the till to remember by. It was funny (not in a ha-ha way, gods, far from it), but Draco really hadn’t given her much thought since the whole thing with Potter started. Well, maybe that made some sense - he was so busy worrying about the
Of course he had to fuck it up. He always fucked everything up. And that night, just when it was all going to be all right, when he finally started to believe her when she’d said – when he thought that maybe he could actually be okay – then he went and did it, the most careless, most idiotic thing he could have done. And then he really would have spent the rest of his miserable life in Azkaban –
“What do you mean?” Lucius asked coldly, and took a step closer to him. Draco tried to cough a few times, but it’s really no easy feat when you’re tied and upside down, so he spluttered rather than spoke.
“But what did he want? They would hardly just bring her here for a nice family visit. Why did they come?”
he huffed, turning his head to face the shadow directly. “Yes,
“Don’t you worry your little head about it,” Malfoy snarled at him, then turned the opposite direction and stormed away. Harry watched him with mixed feelings of guilt and regret. And above all, confusion. He really had to ask himself, why did he want to help the Slytherin so much? Why did he even care? Was it only so he didn’t have to think about his own grim life, his loss? Was it because he thought it could somehow change the inevitable fight he will have to have? He wasn’t sure. He only knew that watching Malfoy limp away from him felt sour in his mouth. He sighed and made his way to class.
“Do you mean it?” he dug his elbows in his stomach and leaned forward on the table. His voice was embarrassingly small.
“It’s not – “
. Draco had the insane urge to take her by the hand, but he wasn’t all that courageous, so he just led the way to the kitchen, past Mother and Harry who scuttled out of the way and made themselves scarce. They sat at the table, where Pansy opened a bottle of wine and poured it into two glasses.
“Okay?” he couldn’t fathom a single thing. Harry wanted him for more than – what?
“What others?” Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco suddenly and violently wanted to die –
“I’ll stay. Another week, if that’s okay with you. Then we can reassess the situation.” The visible relief on Potter’s face broke his heart. He didn’t know what a pathetic, unfaithful wreck Draco was. How much he didn’t deserve his trust and affection. But he could not bear being away from him while there was still a chance to be near… he would cling to Potter for as long as the stupid man allows him.
Dumbledore spreads his arms wide, and a blinding light fills the room. There is a sound like three orchestra’s worth of brass players have just tried to play the loudest, highest note they could, and the entire apartment building quakes. Draco stumbles before he catches himself, and when he opens his eyes again there are colourful circles flashing in his vision.
“Of course they do,” Narcissa says gracefully. “It’s good to see you again, Tom.”
“You wouldn’t
was it?”
“Mm,” Draco hums in quiet agreement. Tomorrow he will go, leave London for good, and live out his remaining time on earth in a little cottage as far away from the Malfoy name as he can get. With the Malfoy money, of course, but he doesn’t care much about that. He cares about reading books for the sheer enjoyment of it rather than because they are a part of being
“Or you could enjoy your life instead of worrying about what comes next,” the Thing huffs, reaching for the egg rolls.
“I thought you didn’t want your parents to see him?” Harry asks tentatively, like Draco is the unreasonable one here, like Harry didn’t just bring a fucking demon home one day like a particularly nasty stray.
“Alright, maybe it was more than some years,” the demon concedes. “Could’ve been a decade or two. Anyway, the Chinese place is right between the knife fight bus stop and the necromancy Asda.”
Harry keeps pushing, there's a row, and Draco's pretty miserable. Mentions of extremely vague torture (no deets).
Draco dreamed of a river.
“I am, and I have no clue what you’re on about! I’m not testing you. I’m not trying to annoy you. I’m not trying
I'd always love to hear from you.)
“I got a letter from her,” he said, holding out a folded piece of parchment. “They let her write to me.” His excitement sounded as frozen as the weather outside. Harry didn’t need to ask who he meant.
“Thanks. I guess I know that, it’s just… never mind, we don’t need to get into that now. So yeah, I get to duel people and investigate and it’s a lot like what I did at school, only far easier.” Draco had to smirk at that.
“I was just going back to my common room,” Malfoy said, back to his maddening, condescending tone. “Potter here was lost, I think. Poor soul.”
He was able to do it because it was for Harry; he needed to do it to make him happy, and Draco would do anything for him, that was pretty much a given. He could even say no, it would seem. Repeatedly. Quite naturally. And if he was able to do that just then… maybe it was something he could do, in general.
For a second it looked like he was about to pat him on the shoulder, but then Potter’s hand changed direction and landed in his own hair. “Good night, Malfoy. I guess I’ll see you round soon enough.”
Harry was aware through the building panic in his gut that Snape sounded actually distressed. Maybe he does want to save Harry’s life after all. But there wasn’t really time to get caught up on these details. “How do they know?”
“Dunno really. They just are. Not to say that all Muggles are bad or something, I know how you pure-bloods think with your prejudice. They just happen to be three of the worst people on the face of the earth.”
“What do you mean? Have you been talking to him about it?”
“Huh?” Ron seemed a little startled all of a sudden, the flush in his cheeks growing darker. Harry could only smile.
!” That kept him silent for a long moment.
“I know that… I know it may be hard for you to believe me, I do, and I understand that. I just fucked up colossally and – and I swore I’d never hurt you, and there I just went and did it. I’m so sorry, I can’t tell you how sorry I am.” His choked tone went up an octave, and Draco could hardly even breathe. “I’m so sorry I did that. I know it’s no excuse, but… I’m not perfect, Draco. I can’t be, I’m only human. I get why you wouldn’t trust me, but I promise you, I promise, I will always try my hardest. Always. And no matter what happens, I’d never leave. Never. Even if – there’s nothing that can make me go, okay? I’m so, so sorry. Maybe I don’t deserve it, but still, I - please don’t push me away because of this. Please. It kills me that I hurt you, that I was careless, but I swear, I never want to hurt you again. I – I love you, Draco.”
has been a long-time business partner of Lucius’.
He can’t imagine living as an embodiment of opposition to something that has already happened, irreversible.
“As right as you can get it with your human mind,” the devil shrugs. “Good job, Draco. Most people become raging lunatics after seeing something like me.”
“Truly human forms require sustenance,” the answer comes in an unsettlingly delighted tone, most likely because the Thing manages to get the last smidgeons of ice cream out of the tub with its expert use of the spoon. “A lot of sustenance, in fact.”
“Who was the artist?” Draco squints at the screen. “Dalí?”
and signed my soul away like an idiot?!” Harry yelps, and judging from his face he’s deadly offended. Draco panics, and says what is possibly the worst thing to say; that is, the truth.
“Probably,” the demon responds. “And I also fucking hate the whales.”
“Technically,” the demon tells Draco calmly as Harry rages on, “it’s only him who is going to hell because of a prophecy. You are getting there on your own merit.”
“You are excused,” the Thing tells him graciously. Draco chokes on his own tongue.
“I’m eating Harry’s ice cream,” the demon states the obvious, and then tries to get the last bits of ice cream from under the little ridge near the edge of the tub before it melts. There is no rush, because the tub itself has been in the freezer until about half a minute ago, and therefore its contents had no time to melt.
“It was foretold, my boy. Prophecies cannot be changed.”
“That doesn’t sound too bad,” Draco offers tentatively.
anyone in heaven, that’s not what heaven is. It’s just dissolving back into some semblance of that unity that used to be.”
“We could get takeaway,” Draco offers without thinking about it. Takeaway is pretty much always the answer when one lives with an athlete as a boyfriend and their kitchen can only hold so many snacks. Then again, demons are probably a bit different. “You know what takeaway is, ri—”
“Are you a demon too?” Draco asks Dumbledore non-judgmentally. “How powerful are you?”
“And he’s powerful because someone famous painted him?”
“People are very good at living with time,” the devil tells him. “It’s after you die that the issues begin.”
“They can’t see you,” Draco tries to reason, and ends up sounding suspiciously close to begging. “They just can’t, they will—”
“You’re
Again, Draco is simply astonished by the ability of this 5’11” monstrosity to sound just as reproachful as Narcissa Malfoy. Then again, they do know each other.
“The one where that knife fight with the four blokes happened some years ago. You must’ve heard of it, there were buckets of blood.”
“You thought I walked up to someone looking like
No, Draco much prefers being a human, even if it is confusing and painful most of the times. At least he can delight in the broken shards of something wonderful, blissfully ignorant of what it used to be.
“Let me get this straight,” Draco begins, and, judging from the faint tremble of his otherwise very kissable lips, Harry is trying to swallow back an ill-timed joke about neither of them being anything remotely close to straight, “you signed a contract with someone and you didn’t realize that you managed to sell your soul to them.”
The two of them watch the recap of last night’s soul-collecting marathon in silence.
“I’m here to make sure the prophecy is fulfilled!” Dumbledore continues. “The chosen one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born on the last day of the seventh month and I will see to it that he exorcises you from this world!”
“Huh?” Draco is reasonably sure that he is hallucinating.
“Bosch.”
“But he didn’t specify
The world warps and Draco’s mind breaks a little with it.
“Is that actually necessary?” he asks the morning after Harry moves out, frustrated to tears with what he calls Draco’s hopelessness. Draco has never felt this hopeful, this calm about his life before.
“I’m afraid you have overstayed your welcome here, Tom,” he says in a terrifyingly calm voice, and Draco discreetly inches away from the couch. Dumbledore might look like a fashion disaster Father Christmas, but his voice promises utter annihilation.
” Draco asks, half hysterical and half accusatory.
“Yes,” Draco says slowly, unsure why this is causing Harry to freak out
“He said it was a petition to save the whales,” Harry responds self-righteously, as if that makes it any better.
Or, well, it is
and idiot.”
It is incomprehensible.
“No,” the demon waves its hand like that’s an inconsequential question, “just Google it.”
“You are,” the demon agrees, not looking away from the flatscreen for a moment.
“And you’re a demon, right?”
It’s the difference between peering up at the night sky, marvelling at the myriad of celestial bodies that paint it, and one of those bodies suddenly approaching.
“Yes, yes, very unfortunate business, being the parents of the chosen ones,” the old man pats him on the shoulders. “And he does have multiple souls, because thankfully his mother, Lily Potter, knew that his son would be in mortal peril and decided to protect him even in death—”
“Mm,” the Thing hums in agreement as they watch the latest episode of
“Okay,” Draco says, putting on a cheerful tone because he really doesn’t want to know more about
Draco had nothing to say for the longest time. “You saw her.” Real-Person-Potter, who knew he existed and treated him as a human being
“Draco, I’m sorry, I don’t think my brain is working right yet. What is it you want?”
“Clever, on top of everything,” Harry’s smile widened. “I know that, you dolt. You’re you. I want you.”
, the discussion ended there. Draco had to proceed with caution and not get too wrapped up in whatever it was Potter was trying to lure him into. Still, though, and because he really couldn’t help himself, he got up and went to the kitchen, dreading what he’ll find there. Dreading – and with good reason too, for on the counter was a box of eclairs (damn it, damn it,
Clearing his throat, Draco set around to fixing the shop. There weren’t many things to do, since almost no flowers were sold yesterday, so by the time the first customer came in he was already extremely bored.
It was too horrible. Too, too, too horrible. Seeing the hands grabbing him as he felt the bruises form. Feeling the whip, first in the memory, then in the living room – feeling His curse on top of the others’ (and gods, His Crucio could put theirs to shame). It was… he couldn’t do it. Draco begged and cried so hard he was gagged, and he still couldn’t stop it. He couldn’t stop asking for another chance,
“Or you touching me,” Harry continued, and he wasn’t sure which one of them was actually more red.
“Yes, I’m in the car. We all are. Clear to go, Draco.”
Some crackle was the only answer he got for a minute. “What shirt?”
“And are you… okay with that?”
. Potter would smile readily and entirely for his benefit. That, more than anything, was what Draco couldn’t resist. Potter wanted him to be warm, yes, and he was the solid form of good, right, and he was fit and objectively beautiful, all that was true, but then there was his smile. It was his smile that made Draco go absolutely, recklessly bonkers for him. It was his smile that had Draco in such deep, deep trouble.
“Oh, right. Well, it was nice to meet you,” Potter said a little heavily, and the two bade their farewells. Walking briskly away, Potter had to run a little to catch up to him. “Hold on, you prat – what’s gotten into you?” he was panting by the time they left the park, and very obviously worried when he noticed Draco’s expression. “Draco. Hey, Draco.” He stopped and sent his hand out, but didn’t grab him, though Draco flinched as if he would. “What is it? Are you all right?”
, he said without opening his mouth. She nodded and turned, walking towards the door whose lock clinked open for her. Draco exhaled with relief and brought his face up to meet the two men in front, trembling only a little. In an instant all thoughts of Granger disappeared from his head and only they remained: his father and Greyback, the improbable duo of pain and terror. Draco had dreams it would end this way.
“Your cupboard?” Malfoy nearly whispered. Harry chuckled.
“Well, I’m not. Dead, that is. I am very much alive. I don’t think they’d let a deceased person rent an establishment in this kind of neighborhood.” Ranting madly, yes, Draco, that surely was the way to go. He would have slapped himself if he possessed even half his faculties.
“I’m sure.” And he didn’t even blink while mumbling the biggest lie of the century, which must have been some sort of progress.
“Will you just sit down?” Draco spat, on the verge of panic. He had no choice but to look at Potter now, and what he saw rattled his very core. Puffy-eyed, deathly-pale, trembling-lipped, Potter was an absolute mess. “What the hell are you talking about?”
Harry growled. Literally growled. “You touch him – you lay one finger on him – “
They sank into a debate on how best to stop Draco from killing himself, should he seem so inclined, and he let himself disassociate. It didn’t matter how they did it, really. The only thing that mattered was finally
“I can imagine. Do you miss that? Having someone who understands?”
Draco shook his head. “You don’t understand. When I gave up – I wasn’t even myself after that. I lost everything, all I had before the castle – who I was – it was all gone. The Dark Lord was all they kept in me, all I had going, and I wasn’t going to come back. Ever. I was going to stay there and be nothing. Until… well, until you. Until you saved me.”
to speak so bluntly, but Draco’s heart still did a ridiculous little double-flip. Now that he came to think about it, he supposed it really was something. Draco would never have dreamed of saying anything like that to anyone in years. Only Potter. His face relaxed as he looked at him, the corners of his mouth twitching. “You really are a prat.”
The line of hair looked so soft against the hard, toned muscles of his chest and abdomen. Draco’s eyes followed it without intention, entranced. Potter was mesmerizing. There was a small burn on the center of his chest, hardly visible but for being slightly raised. His skin was dark and smooth-looking, and a crazy notion ran through Draco's brain wondering how it would feel like on his tongue. These thoughts were
“I know what it was. Why did you do it?” Harry felt his cheeks burning, his blood running hot in his veins.
“So very sorry. Truly, I am. Everything that happened to you because of me… I wish I was a better father to you, but I can only try and do better from now on. Draco, I hope you accept my apology. That would mean everything to me.”
But then he looked back and the smile, that fucking damned smile, was still wide and bright across his bloody gorgeous face, and well. Maybe all of that was future-Draco’s problem. Small bites, he’s decided, right? The sigh was ripped out of him almost by force, because right here and now Harry was incredibly simple. Easy. In this particular moment in time, Draco knew exactly what he wanted, and it was the easiest thing in the world to give. Maybe in the general sense Draco could never make him happy, maybe he could never give him what he truly needed, but – and this was crucial, this was the thing here, because in this precise moment he actually
Perhaps that wasn’t all, actually. Perhaps there was a bit more to it. Because if he could learn something that would help him better understand this – whatever it was that’s been going on in his head, well, that’d be a bonus. And, also. If he could take on that knowledge, and… at some point, if he could use it to – help someone else? Then that would be, erm. That would be kind of good.
“I guess, yeah. I’d rather you were on my side than his, that’s for sure. Would it be so bad?”
But Harry was not thinking about Malfoy, so he couldn’t quite explain to himself what he did, or how he was feeling about the blond at the moment. He was not thinking about him, because to think about him made his insides burn and freeze at the same time, and it was physically painful. So he was not thinking about him, and shutting his mind forcefully he crashed hard on the bed once more, writhing in misery.
“I did not leave, you know where I have been. And if all is going according to plan, why have you come here? You did not think you deserve a reward for a plan halfway done?” Lucius’s anger was cold and distant. Draco hated that more than anything in the world. Well, more than almost anything.
“How –“ the question left his lips before he had a chance to think it through, but Draco didn’t need it. He knew, did he not? He knew just how he did it. He knew it all along, a part of him had known all this time and didn’t bother to tell the rest of him. The absolute arse.
“Have you ever met Death Eaters before?” Draco asked with a clear air of despair, but still no one listened.
As he expected, Malfoy was already there, sitting on Harry’s sofa again. But when he looked at Harry, he seemed – Harry felt his chest doing this weird expansion thing. He seemed happy. Like he was happy to see Harry. Everything about his demeanor said he was relaxed; he sat with his legs up, feet on the table, hands resting at his sides leisurely. And Harry knew what had changed; ever since Malfoy saw him break apart completely, he no longer felt like Harry had the upper hand. He wasn’t ashamed of him anymore. He felt… safe around him.
Potter’s hands shook a litte. “You don’t have to, you know. Stay away from her.”
“Please,” the ridicule on the pale face was wholly familiar, “you’re not alone, Draco. You’re just someone else’s pet now. Of course you’ll be good if you serve a master such as Harry Potter.”
“You know you could get a wand, right? That is, if you come back. You could have anything you wanted.”
No, no he wasn’t – no, nothing was – no, it was simply impossible, it couldn’t be happening, it – and the realization was so heavy, Draco might have actually passed out again; it was something he never really grasped and always had known. Something that was so obvious he would never have guessed it:
“There is no point in that,” Draco spat and closed his eyes. The vague threat wasn’t as frightening as the calm tone of voice his father took. Does he know, then, what they plan to do with him? and is it vicious enough to satisfy his lord?
“Why did you stop me?” Draco asked, although he suspected he knew the answer.
“No, Potter, that’s not true. You already had it right before, you can do it again – “
“I can take care of myself – “
happened?”
“Is.”
“Do you want to tell me what happened?”
The arsehole laughed. There was such a strong note of relief in that sound, Draco wasn’t even offended. “You really wanted to kiss me?”
Harry’s smile only grew wider. “Not really. I want to hear all about it. How you dream about me at night, kiss my photograph every time you go to bed. You probably have a poster of my face on your bedroom wall at the manor.”
“Hey, come here,” Potter reacted to his expression, and Draco dutifully got up and settled himself next to Potter on his bed. “There’s a picture of her. Want to see? Wow, did she always have a tattoo?”
rug in the bedroom. A seventies-looking kitchen, and then this living room looks like a museum – and who has a security camera in their flat? I bet you he’s a porn star. Or in the mafia, or something, I don’t know.”
“It’s supposed to be ‘move, I’m gay,’” the demon informs him, plopping back down to where it was seated before Draco has arrived.
“He had a bloody toad as a pet,” Draco remembers with a shudder of revulsion.
Not to put too fine a point on it, it feels like being in the opening sequence of a horror movie, and Draco really doesn’t know why he’s surprised. He’s getting takeaway for a fucking demon from a place that’s near a bus stop apparently infamous for some knife fight and the
“I wanted you to experience the difference between demons and a devil so that you would finally stop calling me a demon. That was about the extent of my malicious plans.”
It doesn’t matter. Power, wealth, fame—none of it matters. He is a human being at the moment, and this moment won’t last long.
—knowing that it is something profoundly broken. Knowing that the only thing to do now is to hurry along the death, the final disintegration of it all instead of trying to recreate what used to be.
But Draco can’t remember being part of that unity like the devil can, and he thinks he is better off for it. He doesn’t want to imagine what it must be to look at the world—to look at
“They also maintain their wealth by child labour, pollution, and the exploitation of workers. The tax evading part is inconsequential, considering.”
“How is that marking him as my equal?” The demon scoffs. “I’m clearly his superior, I own his soul.”
“He does, but he said he can’t sign anything without talking to his grandmother first.”
“Potato potato,” Draco responds, accidentally throwing out months of what his therapist has been calling a ‘great strengthening’ of his mental resilience.
“Good evening,” Lucius Malfoy greets his only son coolly, and then his eyes move from Draco’s wide-eyed expression to the couch. “Ah. You never told me you knew each other, Draco.”
This, unfortunately, also means that the Thing has just devoured a whole tub’s worth of ice cream in less than thirty seconds. That is a bit worrying.
“Excuse me?” Draco stares him down, as much as any 5’5” man can stare a 5’11” demon down.
know how long it will last?”
“And the prophecy is that Harry has the power to vanquish you?” Draco asks, the question only mildly more interesting than the eight-legged creature that is currently chasing Faust across the screen while spluttering some sort of an acidic bile.
“You have a very small apartment,” the Thing says, taking some clean mugs out of the dishwasher and putting them away on the highest shelf of the kitchen cabinet. For a moment Draco is sure that he’s having a really odd stress nightmare, because the creature sounds exactly as judgmental as his mother does. “Especially for someone who is supposed to be rich.”
“Bollocks,” Draco mumbles. “I’ll have to pay my bloody taxes from now.”
He is in the middle of London and he is also in the endless, unforgiving expanse of space, the dark stretch of the world, and it doesn’t matter that his eyes see walls and furniture around himself—it is a thin layer of varnish over the yawning nothingness of the world, the
“But Neville is an idiot,” Draco tells him bluntly. “He couldn’t vanquish a public school bully, not to mention a demon.”
“Do you have their number?”
The demon howls with laughter.
The devil rises from the couch in a slow, uncoiling movement, slit-pupil eyes like a snake’s. Draco remembers the first time he saw him there—the terror, the shock, the anger, the helplessness—and he remembers the person he used to be too, before the inevitability of his death and what will come after was made clear to him. He knows the answer to his question, he thinks, but he wants to hear it still.
(Or maybe it’s thanks to his therapist, who is very patient in listening to him rant about the “pet” his significant other got without asking him, and whom he refers to as ‘the demon.’)
The menu that Draco is staring at has some items circled in red.
Draco groans again, partly because his ribs hurt, and partly because Harry has been showing the Thing his fucking memes, or RIP vine compilations, or whatevers, and that’s just about the only thing that could’ve made this whole situation even worse.
“Neville,” the Thing nods while Draco is trying to get over his own shock at Neville’s distinct lack of shock. “It’s been a while. How’s your grandmother?”
“What?” Draco asks, confused.
“Did I miss something?” Draco asks. “Demons are people who died and went to hell and were tortured for a while, correct?”
“Draco, we are going to hell,” Harry continues, sounding slightly panicked. “Hell is a real place and we’re going there!”
It’s awe, in the purest sense of the word. He is completely awestruck, something that feels like it might be his soul buoyed by the sight of something so inhumanly majestic, something so beyond what he thought was possible.
On one hand Draco understands him; it must feel profoundly unfair, that he was tricked into signing his soul (souls?) away just because Dumbledore had some half-holy nun make up some sort of a prophecy about him in a very unethical attempt to buy himself a ticket to heaven.
“I’m not a demon,” the Thing scowls at the same time, which is an ominous sight only slightly brightened by the hilarity of the obvious lie.
“That depends,” the Thing responds, visibly bored. “If you get a decent tormentor you can be done in a century or two. If you apply yourself.”
“I’m not sharing,” the demon responds. “You should’ve gotten something for yourself while we were there.”
me?” The Thing asks Dumbledore. He sounds extremely annoyed, which Draco understands; the quiz show is on the final round, which is when the soul-eating fiends and acid-spitting snakes are usually brought out. Dumbledore plants himself right in front of the flatscreen.
“Can demons enjoy hell?” he asks the night before he moves out of the apartment. They are sitting on the couch, eating takeaway from the Chinese place near the knife fight bus stop and the necromancy Asda.
“What are you even doing?” Draco asks with a huge, put-out sigh, turning away from the bedroom door. The demon stares at him, back in its glowing scarlet-eyed form, scraping a spoon at the bottom of the ice cream tub. Draco has never, not once in the past three months, has seen the Thing
And it doesn’t even begin to resolve the existential crisis of suddenly realizing how fragile the entire universe is, because a consciousness that existed when none of it was around is just casually sitting next to him on his couch made of stardust that was created entirely by a conscious being and then left to swing around wildly on strings of fate.
devil?” Draco asks tentatively, strangely pleased that his traumatic experience wasn’t done with the explicit desire to hurt him. “Not
“I can’t reach the top shelf,” Harry explains, because he takes to absolutely mad situations like a duck takes to water, so he has found a use for their resident demon. “And he was bored.”
“What will come after?” he asks, although he doesn’t think he’ll be able to understand.
“How does he have multiple souls?” Draco points at Harry.
“Why do you know my parents?” he asks, trying his best not to fall asleep. He is once again perched on the armrest of the couch, and with his luck sleep will make him slip down on the couch side of it, resulting in a very rude awakening by their resident demon.
“Am I getting into heaven?”
Which, in retrospect, should have probably worried him.
“Oh,” Draco says, immensely relieved.
Neville Longbottom?”
“It’s the only way to purge some of your humanity,” the devil responds. “Very human demons don’t do enough for hurrying along the end of the world, they just suffer pointlessly.”
“I know you!” Dumbledore snaps, although he looks a little pale. “Your name was Tom Marvolo Riddle before you became a demon and—”
” Draco shrills, and the anger he tried to repress hits him like a bloody freight train. “There’s a literal demon on the couch!”
On the other hand? Draco is
“You are
“Oh, she’s doing well,” Neville responds politely to a literal demon. “How have you been?”
” he points at the Thing on the couch, although he would rather not look at it ever again, “told you it was collecting signatures to save the whales and you believed it?!”
“He’s having a panic attack,” Harry corrects him while Draco sucks a painful, terrified breaths. “And shouldn’t
The Thing is gone.
“That’s Bartemius,” the Thing says. “He used to be the murderous son of a petty king about two thousand years ago, before he got to hell. Took him forever to turn into a proper demon, but then the first thing he did was picking an artist to torment with visions, so he got up the ranks overnight.”
“Move, I’m tired,” he groans, and throws himself down on the couch. The demon moves out of his way with inhuman speed like someone has just threatened him with holy water, perching on the back of the couch instead.
“Yes.”
them into the restaurant.
“No,” the demon huffs. “The prophecy said that either him or Neville has the
“Infernal news,” the Thing tells him matter-of-factly, “says it in the corner. By the way, we’re making great progress on ending the world, so if I were you I’d sell my stocks in those sweatshop-owning companies. Not that you stand a chance of getting into heaven, but in case you want to try and fail.”
While he’s sure that no amount of visualizing the anger leaving his body with every exhale is going to improve this situation, he is even more sure that the Thing won’t appreciate being yelled at, and he’d rather not find out what the Thing with its icy voice and glowing scarlet eyes is capable of.
Draco knows that his victory is momentary, and he is proven right the next second, when the Thing puts a foot underneath his back and flips him off of the couch with a rather powerful kick.
That makes no sense.”
“No they haven’t, you nonce,” Draco tells him brusquely. Sometimes Harry needs comfort and coddling, but more often than not Harry needs someone rudely telling him to stop blaming himself for shite he absolutely is not responsible for.
of his souls he signed away, did he?”
