"What happened....? How long was I out...?" I tried to ask him while taking in the gigantic headache I had way too much from my head but stopped and looked up at Ron who was patiently looking at me with a gigantic smile on his face. "Three days about...I thought you would be in here for weeks, I'm glad you're just fine considering you took such a sharp hit to the head, you should be glad that your house won though. I was surprised Draco cared at all about it and wanted to make sure you weren't hurt too bad after you sacrificed yourself for him. Were you crazy?! You could've gotten yourself killed!!"
"So I sneak out to the garden to see you, we keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. Oh, Ho, cause you were Romeo I was a Scarlet Letter and my dad said "Stay away from Juliet!" but you were everything to me i was begging you please don't go and I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone, I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess, it's a love story baby just say yes. Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel, this love is difficult but it's real, don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess, it's a love story baby just say yes."
"Sorry about him, he doesn't understand what it's like, laying there day after day, watching people press their ugly faces on you." For some reason though, the snake lifted his head up at me as If he understood what I was saying somehow. "Can you hear me?" Nodding his head, I was surprised that the snake could really understand me at all, but it was quite amazing in all honesty. "I've never talked to a snake before, do you talk to people often? You're from Burma aren't you; did you think it was nice there, do you miss your family?"
"Well..'just harry' you are a wizard." ".....I'm a what?" "A wizard." "....I'm a what?" "Blimey Harry didn't you do anything strange when you were upset or scared?" He told me and I remembered what happened not long ago at the Zoo, he was right in all honesty, I've done dozens of strange and odd things in my life, they just sort of happened I guess. Finally getting handed my letter I've been dying to see, I was able to open it for once.
After a little while of sitting by myself the same red-head came over to my pair of seats for the train. "Do you mind? Everyone else is taken..." Not minding at all, he sat down happily and introduced himself while I did the same. "So it's true, do you really have the...you know the scar...?" Nodding my head with a smile he was watching it in admiration before a cart full of goodies came over asking if we wanted anything. "Wicked...."
Pressing play, I leaned back into my pillow. "You stare me down with those electric eyes, no matter how hard I try I can't escape that gazing night, that girls up in the atmosphere, that girls up in the atmosphere, oh. Making me hypnotized by the way she moves, baby girl please help me soon, i'ma take you to sun and the moon. That girl's up in the atmosphere, oh that girls up in the atmosphere; yeah I've been catching myself thinking of it."
"Even Malfoy didn't deserve that, besides it is a surprise he cared at all, I guess even Draco has a heart no matter how much of an egotistical jerk he can be. I'm sure Slytherin is definitely happy though about being able to win the match don't you think?" I said to Ron who nodded his head at me before Draco came inside, most likely to make sure I was still alright.
"She stares me down with those electric eyes, no matter how hard I try I can't escape that gazing night. That girls up in the atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere; oh she's way up in the atmosphere. Yeah, I've been waiting, waiting for you anticipating chasing after things that you do but I can't catch lightning. Waiting Waiting Waiting for you anticipating chasing after things that you do but I can't catch lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. No I can't catch Lightning oh yeah, oh no I can't catch lightning, I can't catch lightning, oh I can't catch lightning, oh no I can't catch lightning." Non of this helping unfortunately, I tried to distract myself from this all for a little longer but I couldn't find any way so I just pushed on the Icon 'Lightning By Alex Goot' before turning it off and doing my best to fall asleep.
"You actually think I'm actually going to CONSIDER in the slightest about telling anyone we both tripped and accidentally kissed eachother in the worst possible position?! Don't act like an idiot more than you already are!" I yelled at him but he quickly told me to stop yelling or else I'm going to attract the attention of the whole Hogwarts castle. "If you hadn't stolen my Robe non of this would've happened."
Going into the air with the rest of my team, I could see the gigantic field and hear the announcer. "Welcome to the first match of the season, Slytherin vs. Griffindor! Everyone is taking positions, let's have a nice and clean game from all of you!" In no time at all the Snitch was released and everyone was watching it fly around since we couldn't start the game until it was time to start playing. "The snitch has been released, remember whoever catches it wins the game, it's worth 150 points. The Quaffle is released and...the game begins!"
Harry begs and begs for the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin but the Sorting Hat sees a potential he can not. Already making enemies with Draco Malfoy on the first day, it's difficult for them to get along in the slightest but they begin to learn what it means to fall in love in the worst way possible. Even though Harry tries to pretend he has no actual connection with the Slytherin household, there is no way he can do that so easily with a single chain pulling him straight back known as Draco Malfoy.
"I've got six of him, trust me he's really common. This is my rat, Scabbers, pretty pathetic isn't he?" Shrugging my shoulders I couldn't help myself from agreeing unfortunately while the rat munched away in one of the small boxes. "Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow, wanna see?" Nodding my head in excitement with a small 'yeah' he didn't mind at all from pulling out his wand in preparation.
"Potter this is Oliver Wood; Wood I have found you a seeker!" "What do you mean he's not in the same house as ours, he can't compete against his own house of all things, it's against the rules." I could hear Oliver saying but I really had no idea what was going on right now. "I know the game is today and you need a Seeker or else your house will forfeit the match, it's either him or you forfeit."
"Harry, happy birthday!" It was an amazing gift and I walked over to Hagrid after paying for my wand. We eventually got to a small rest area but i couldn't stop thinking about what he was saying to me about my scar and why this all had a connection to me, I tried asking Hagrid beacuse I'm sure he knew if he knew about the death of my parents. "First, understand this Harry, not all wizards and witches are good people, some of them turned evil and there was one particular wizard a few years ago who turned the most evil. His name was...V...his name was...Vol..." It seemed hard for him to say for some reason so I tried to ask him to write it down but he didn't know how to spell it appearantly. "Fine...Voldemort."
"POTTER, MALFOY, PAY ATTENTION!!" The both of us suddenly heard which snapped me out of my thoughts and we both screamed all of a sudden while jumping out of our skin for a mere second which ended up with seeing Professor Snape staring down at us. The entire classroom was laughing at us which made our faces blush from embarrassment but Snape was completely expressionless while narrowing his eyebrows at me. "If you're so inclined to be so focused on your 'personal studies' then I'm sure you will obviously be able to tell me exactly what the answer to the entire lecture I've been configuring for you small minded students are?"
Placing my earbuds into my ears, I tried to keep quiet so I didn't get complained at while everyone was busy sleeping and began to let the words spill out of my mouth. "We were both young when I first saw you, I closed my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there on the balcony of summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ballgown, see you make your way through the crowd and say hello; little did I know that you were Romeo and you were throwing pebbles and my dad said "Stay away from Juliet." and I was crying on the staircase begging you "Please don't go!"; and I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone, I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run, you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess, it's a love story baby just say yes."
"Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts, of course I'm sure you know all about Hogwarts." "Sorry, no..." Confused for some reason, it was like he couldn't figure out why this strange place called Hogwarts didn't even process in my mind at all. "No? Blimey Harry didn't you ever wonder where your Mom and Dad learned at all?"
“Yes, he brought it here for me to examine, but it is very unstable. I’m afraid one wrong use could be enough to punch a hole through the very fabric of time itself.” The old man hung his head, shaking it at the floor in disgust.
“Is Muggle art always this violent and outlandish?” He asked, stepping closer to examine just how incredibly detailed the portrait was. And to think that was done all by hand and not magic!
“Theodore darling, be a dear and buy me a drink,” she said before planting a big wet kiss on his cheek.
“I do understand,” he replied, feeling his heart bang against his ribcage, “and that’s why it has to be me that stops him. Not them.”
Robards smirked at that, “I had a feeling you’d enjoy it. Once you’re settled in you’ll have free reign over this collection. It’s yours to study and experiment on, though I trust you’ll follow the necessary precautions when handling these Dark Artefacts.”
It took him a few days to stomach the news. At first, he was so paralyzed by what he’d heard, he didn’t leave his bed for a whole twenty-four hours. The day after, he managed to snap out of his depressed, immobile state, though he still couldn’t leave his flat in fear of coming across anyone he knew; he was already horrified enough. Two days later, he had come to terms with it and decided to still take the job, after much consideration. As much as he wanted to be wrong about his father being irredeemable, new evidence popped up proving he was incorrect each and every time. After fighting the truth for so long, he realized he could no longer live as a bystander to his father's actions. Especially now that Draco’s been practically disowned for deciding against marrying some poor pure-blood girl that likely wanted nothing to do with him. It was better this way. Or at least that’s what he tried to convince his inner conscience.
Embarrassment and shame swept over his whole body. Draco was utterly disgusted with himself, but he had no choice but to open the stall door now, knowing Potter was unlikely to leave until he did. He feared the reaction of the latter when he finally faced him, but the uncertainty of not knowing scared him more.
“Enjoying the party?” Draco smirked, chugging the last of his drink before setting it aside. Leaning his forearms against the railing he looked at the Muggles walking the streets, unassuming and unaware that a dozen or more wizards were partying just above them.
It wasn’t until Mittens leaped onto his lap, as Draco shut his eyes so painfully tight, he thought he might see stars. His clenched fists, tugging at his hair painfully, automatically reached for the kitten’s fur. His breathing came slower now as he pet Mittens’ fur through shaky hands. This was often their routine. Mittens, while still a young cat, was wise and knew whenever Draco would get bad again. It was one of the main reasons Draco became so attached to the feline.
Though he tried, he couldn’t get Potter off of his mind since their last encounter. It seemed too convenient that he would be here, so close to his neighborhood after the last several times he accidentally ran into him. It just didn’t make any sense. Why now? What could Potter possibly want from him now that he was a broken man, with little to nothing to offer him? Was it an apology he sought? A reconnection? Another rivalry? Whatever it was, it flew right over Draco’s head. Yet he still couldn’t push the thought out of his mind, especially after hearing Potter’s harsh words. Even at night, when he fought through nightmares of fire and blood, he saw Potter’s face. That’s how it always was with Potter; his presence was more of a sickness to Draco’s mind than anything. It spread unwittingly until it consumed every part of him – even the healthy bits.
“It’s actually at my home, we’ll only be gone for a second,” Harry responded, refusing to make eye contact and staring at something interesting in the direction of the Ministry.
Harry trailed off, as if searching for the correct word, though he was a bit distracted as he patted Mitten’s head and body.
“Robards said he was spotted not far from here, along the museum grounds. He was spotted for only a second, but we have a witness who confirms it was him. Blaise, I want you to question the witness while Potter and I search the grounds.” Draco started, pointing off in the not so far distance to where the museum should be, before directing his attention to Longbottom and Irma, “Meanwhile, you two are to report to the local Auror department here and conduct your tracking spells.”
Your words made me take my prick out of my pyjama bottoms and stroke it until I came. I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve never been quite that excited before.
What was it like in your dungeon? I know what it looks like, for I made my secret way into the Serpent’s Lair once upon a time – more details about that when we meet, if you wish! – but what games were popular? Did you play Gobstones or Wizard Chess? Did you have a Wireless? Who used to steal their dad’s Firewhisky and dole it out in sips? Was it you, Draco? I’ll bet it was. That sounds very Malfoy-esque.
It is very early, but you must know by now that your words are never a burden. I love you, Draco and that won’t ever change. When I woke, it was to the heat of my diary, still stashed under my pillow, and I watched each of your hastily – but still beautifully – written words appear on the pages. Your worries radiate from the page, my love, the honesty of them raw and potent.
My mind was so foggy. You moved a bit after a while to get a hand between us, starting to jerk my prick. After a moment you grabbed for the lube again and, oh fucking Circe, you know exactly what I want. Your slicked up palm rubbed over my head and down my shaft, matching my pace and intensity. Fuck, you took it so well. My fingers were so deep inside of you, while you made so many soft little noises and whispered how much you love me, how much you want me.
We moved to sit sideways, you between my legs, and I took one of the sponges, soaking it with a good amount of foam and soap. I began washing you, taking all the time in the world to appreciate every part of you I could find. From the nape of your neck over your collarbones, into your armpits and along your beautiful arms. Your hands.
That little bugger put me in the Hospital Wing, back in Second Year. Bloody hell, do you remember it? It was during the Slytherin/Gryffindor match and that rogue Bludger knocked me out of the sky. That was Dobby. He also dropped a cake on Uncle Vernon’s work colleague, withheld my mail for a summer and best of all, found me the Room of Requirement for the first time. He was a good creature, and you’ve got memories of him from when you were little, I’d love to hear them. If Hemione has anything to do with it, all house-elves will be liberated before we all reach our thirtieth year. They’ll be the savviest business leaders on Diagon Alley, swear to Merlin. They’re already the best chefs and pastry makers.
Pansy scoffed, “Oh please, it’s not like we’re getting married. We had sex, that was all. He left in the morning anyways, so I doubt it’ll happen again.”
"Draco…it’s so good to see you again.” She smiled at him softly, and he was slightly dumbstruck until he snapped out of it and pulled her in for a quick hug.
“Maybe there’s another way leading out of this tunnel,” Blaise motioned for the exit, noticing the lights beginning to turn on, meaning they were now open for the public.
The moment between them was gone and Draco rolled his eyes as he opened the door, facing an incredibly nosy and wide-eyed Pansy, who had hoped secretly in her mind to catch them in some inappropriate act or another.
As an adult, he understood the propriety of it, though he supposed there was wiggle room in the door-knocking debate if the door was already slightly ajar. What then? Does he knock before pushing it open? Or does he walk in unannounced, regardless if there is anyone in the room or not?
He definitely looked worse for wear, he didn’t need a mirror to tell him that. Pansy, on the other hand, looked rather put together. She wore a surprisingly simple Muggle outfit. Her hair was tied in a bun, and her face looked freshly cleaned. She must have had an early start to the day, he presumed.
“What the bloody hell is wrong with you?” Draco hissed at the man, tightening his robe so his exposed chest was no longer exposed, “What if I was indecent, you prat?”
been years, after all. He looked more mature, and from what he’d heard, his Auror job had been doing well to keep him in shape. His hair was just as messy as it’d always been, and a bit longer too. That much hadn’t changed. His clothes looked expensive, which was odd to Draco – he doubted Harry even bought them himself, anyways. Still, he couldn’t deny that they flattered him greatly. All in all, he looked…like Harry. The thought caused a lump to form in the back of his throat.
Later in the afternoon, he went to the Manor to have tea with his mother. He tried to visit as often as he could, but once a week was all he could muster when every step he took into the Manor made him want to jump off a bridge.
Draco stood in his black silk robe, sipping on a glass of ice-cold water when the noise from the Floo sent his glass flying through the air and leaving water droplets all over his window. The glass nearly shattered upon contact with the hardwood floors, but Draco had caught it at the very last second.
That night he packed everything of value he had on him, all of his clothes and personal belongings and apparated somewhere they would never find him. In Muggle London, he was invisible. Two weeks had passed before he found a permanent place to lay his head in Chiswick, the flat he still calls his home.
“And you’re ready to see me now?” His voice had an audible tremor in it, though he covered it up by clearing his throat.
Draco shrugged, though internally rejoicing for the change in topic, “I wouldn’t mind some takeaway. Are you okay with Chinese?”
A soft purr brought his attention down to the floor where Mittens figure-eighted between his legs. Harry’s eyes brightened almost instantly as he knelt down to caress the cat, “I didn’t think your flat would be so…”
Irma was the first to speak up, in a cheery tone, “Except me, of course. You lot graduated five years after I did.”
Without another word, he disappeared into his room, feeling increasingly uncomfortable with the number of eyes staring at him. He could hear the people begin to chatter among themselves once again and that gave him the time he needed to take a deep breath and sink his face into his hands as he sat on his bed. Why today, of all the days? Why did it have to be after visiting the Manor, when every part of him felt compelled to lock himself indoors and curl under his sheets and contemplate the existential dread of being a Malfoy?
Blaise laughed at his stoic expression, despite moving their discussion to more stories about his new partner’s placement. Dorian was his name – an older gentleman who seemed to have a distaste for Slytherins, as much of the rest of the Wizarding World did after the war. Blaise’s stories were bordering on cynical, although he laughed it off regardless. Draco could imagine that he would experience the same discrimination if he accepted the job offer, though he tried not to think about it too much.
The thought sent echoes to his mind and throughout his body, causing shockwaves to sweep through his spine, as he began to shake uncontrollably. He breathed in and out, panting now, as his thoughts begun to race, and his mouth went dry. As he heaved, his shaky hands reached for his chest, and Draco
look at him. The hurt and confusion was there, but it was masked by anger. Draco found it difficult to look at him so directly, as the regret coursed through him like a rush of adrenaline.
“Mother, you know I have to get to work.” He lied again with ease. He didn’t work on the weekends, but going home and laying on his bed with Mittens curling up next to him seemed like a much better option than staying there a moment longer.
“As you can see, this case takes top priority. I’ve spoken to a select few in our department that I believe would be of great help to you, and would suggest you add them to your team. If you can start as soon as tomorrow, you can meet them. Some, I believe, you may already know.”
She stuck her tongue out at the blonde-haired man, scooching her chair closer to Theodore’s to the point where she was basically sitting on his lap.
Had he not been as tipsy as he was, he would have likely decided against the entire endeavor, but Draco’s sound mind was never exactly sound while inebriated. Nevertheless, he persisted, trying to seem as nonchalant as possible by blending in with the crowd, keeping his eyes peeled for any suspicious characters. While he struggled to maneuver himself to the stairs, which led to an open terrace up top, he had thought he heard a familiar voice.
As Draco struggled with his thoughts, Robards placed a document and a quill on the desk, pointing to the dotted line where Draco’s name was supposed to be. His expectant glance only furthered Draco’s thoughts into a flurry.
That shut him up quickly. An apologetic look fell over his face, but she didn’t seem to have any time for pity as she quickly waved him off and changed the subject.
flat, Draco felt hesitation grip him like a boa constrictor, squeezing the rationality out of him. Anthony was a handsome man, and one who was clearly interested in him, so why was Draco feeling so reluctant? His heart rate quickened when Anthony’s hands slid up his arm, and up to his shoulder. His blue eyes seemed impossibly blue, not unlike the color of azurite. Draco wondered to himself how he ever thought they could be green.
The trio stood in silence for a moment, contemplating the words spoken aloud. Draco pondered what they could mean, knowing that it was likely the well itself was not magical in any way, and yet, he had a strange feeling that the passage was meant to lead inside the well.
Potter nodded once, leading the way through hallways and galleries of art. Had Draco been here for leisure, he would have loved to look closer. Most of this art, he’d never seen before. The paintings...didn’t move. He found that he didn’t mind it.
“No, I will not.” He shook his head and through the tears he saw the look of disappointment on his father’s face. It was more painful than a thousand knives cutting into his chest. It was worse than lying in a pool of his own blood in the Sixth-floor boys’ bathroom.
“We’ve found him.” He said, though Draco already suspected as much when he saw the expression on his face.
Her words felt like a punch to Draco’s gut. Was that really why they were there? To cheer Harry up because of Draco’s alleged misdeeds? It felt unjust, listening to them, but now that his name was mentioned, he couldn’t possibly leave without getting some answers.
Reluctantly, he opened the stall door. Draco tried not to hang his head or give any tell-tale signs that he was ashamed, but it was difficult doing so when Potter looked at him so intensely.
for him to come up with the right words to say. He didn’t even know where to start. But he knew he owed him his life, and nothing would ever erase the man from his mind, no matter how hard he tried. Years, months, weeks passed by and it all went to hell the moment Harry Potter stepped into this pub.
It was relatively cool outside, despite it being the middle of summer – cold enough to see his breath, but not cold enough to need a scarf or gloves. Instead, Draco settled for shoving his hands in his overcoat, which had a warmth charm on the inside of it.
For the first 6 months or so after the war, he had no choice but to stay at the Manor until his trial approached. After the trial had ended, he no longer found it in him to stay in that wretched house. It was his childhood home, the only place he’d ever really known besides Hogwarts, but the war ruined them both for him and he found himself tired of it all. After that, he packed up his things, wrote a letter to his mother, and settled in a small loft in a Muggle neighborhood in London. It was a simple life, one that his family could not understand, but one he was content with. He didn’t need the same things he thought he did before the war, and certainly didn’t want the same things. For the first time in his life, the Muggle world seemed much more favorable than the Wizarding world for that fact alone.
“Maybe I could start now,” Harry gave him a crooked smile, one Draco had seen so many times before but never directed at him.
"Draco!” Pansy practically screamed from the other room, “Are you seriously still in bed? You lazy sack of-“
Instead of replying, Harry had turned to say goodbye to his friends. It was then that Draco had looked around the now-emptying pub that he realized most of his friends were getting ready to leave as well. Had they really been there for that long?
“I know you’re angry,” Blaise walked over to him, giving him an understanding look, “but you can’t let your anger cloud your judgement. Come on, we’ve got to leave within the hour.”
“I will not.” Draco felt his words come out stronger this time as he sprang up from the table, though the tears had already begun to blur his vision, “I won’t marry some girl I could never love!”
“I take it you’ve never seen the house before,” Harry remarked, digging through the desk in search of something.
Blaise, who was now sporting a dark red flush on his face, either from the alcohol or the embarrassing story, couldn’t keep a grin off his face, while the others laughed heartily at the tale.
Sébastien shook his head, “No, but he said you might ask me that. He told me his son was following him with a group of Aurors and then disappeared. I thought he was just trying to scare me, but here you are.”
The door handle began to turn. Draco panicked and rushed inside one of the bathroom stalls. He nearly slapped his hand to his forehead when he realized he’d left the faucet running.
“Wait, what is that?” Potter asked, pointing to the shimmery ink that was now fully visible to the two of them.
towards the fireplace, and tossed the letter to the flames. He watched through blurry vision as it burned away the golden letters that read
She sat down across from him, noticing the way her long dark hair flowed in waves behind her back, “It’s water under the bridge now. Besides, I knew you were going through a lot.”
Taking a deep breath and tightening his grip on his wand, he grasped the door handle very carefully before swinging it open and pointing his wand in the face of none other than Pansy Parkinson.
Blaise sighed, “I don’t know. Everyone has been so on edge since word got out about Robards assigning a special team for some top-secret case.  The newcomers like me know nothing about it. You met with Robards, didn’t you? What did he tell you about it?”
At first, he hadn’t realized that Harry was staring at him. Blaise was in the middle of greeting Weasley, when he noticed the familiar dark mess of hair that was on Harry’s head, and those unrelenting green eyes. It seemed Harry was just as surprised to see him as well, as they both just stared at each other for a moment before the weight of Anthony’s arm on his shoulder began to droop, bringing his attention back to reality.
Harry chuckled, “It certainly can be. What is that one you’re looking at? The fall of Ixion? That’s based on a Greek myth, you know.”
Draco lingered by the door, though his eyes wandered to the hundreds, if not thousands, of books piled on top of another, “No, mother forbade it. ‘There’s nothing for us there’, she used to say.”
Draco started by clearing his throat, “First, I wanted to tell you that I’ve accepted a job with the Ministry.”
It was nearing September and the weather had started to become chilly again. Draco could feel it in his bones when he came to the countryside. It served as a reminder of much colder days than this at the Manor. He remembered the deep chill rattling his bones when the Dark Lord was near and the Death Eaters invaded his home. Every room of the house was filled with the stench of death, save his own room and his mother’s parlor. He remembered the deep ache from his mark and the chills running down his spine when they called upon him. Sometimes, when he was alone he would feel a phantom pain over it, markedly amplifying the panic and anxiety he had developed over the years as a result of his imprudent choices. The Dark Lord was gone, he knew this for a fact, and yet when he stared at the mark, he wondered what would happen if he pressed his wand into it. Would he still feel pain?
“Sorry for the delay,” the man cleared his throat, eventually taking a seat. For a second, Draco didn’t recognize him, but eventually his eyes readjusted, and he realized the middle-aged man sitting in front of him was none other than Gawain Robards, the Head of the Auror department.
With that, he walked out of the door, not waiting for the house-elf to escort him there, until the Manor was far out of view.
The usage of his last name and the nature of her teasing sounded too familiar and yet too foreign to hear on her lips and it made him shift uncomfortably in his seat until they heard the Floo again in the other room.
To Draco’s left, he could see Blaise walking back towards them, intrigued by the direction of their new conversation.
He thought that by eavesdropping on Harry and his friends that he would find answers, but now he’s been left with only more questions. Though he wanted to disbelieve the words he’s heard, it made far too much sense to be incorrect. Now he’s left with a question of his morality, and an iron-clad boot stepping on his already shattered heart. Is it better to join the Aurors in finding his father? Or is it better to stay blindly loyal to the man who wanted nothing to do with him? He stared up at the stars, hoping to find a semblance of peace when looking at them. His vision was blurry with tears, leaving him with a feeling of emptiness he knew all too well. Before he could draw any more attention to himself, he stepped into an alley and apparated himself home, where he could at least cry about his fucked up life in the privacy of his own home.
“No, and I have no intention of being anything other than her friend.” His tone was biting, and for good reason.
Across the way, they could see a single flame of a candle, sitting at the floor of a heavy, wooden and iron-wrought door.
Blaise stayed silent for a moment before hesitantly opening his mouth, “It doesn’t matter what I think. Now go and get dressed, we’re meeting at the Ministry soon.”
Draco couldn’t answer, and Blaise could sense it. He must have known he wouldn’t get an answer, at least not today, as he later sighed and motioned for the blonde wizard to follow him out into the hall.
The lot of them erupted into a flurry of chanting and laughter over drinks. From the sound of it, it was likely they were playing a drinking game inside, which led Draco to yearn for the comfort of the indoors. Not that he was uncomfortable with Anthony’s words or his closeness, but he couldn't help but feel a bit startled by it. Not to mention the fact that all of his friends were inside, waiting to celebrate
A house-elf led them to his mother’s parlour, disappearing momentarily to bring the pair some fresh tea. Draco would have declined if he’d gotten the chance, but he knew what his mother would say.
Draco could hear his heart beating in his chest, his breath became uneven as they scoured through the casemates. At times, they would pass by a cliff with cannon loopholes, reminding Draco of the rich history this place once had. He could feel it seeping out of every crack and crevice inside the rocky cavern.
Longbottom nodded, sending Draco a small smile. It was timid but it was there, plain as day, “Robards would’ve had our heads if we came up with nothing. Good job, Malfoy.”
Blaise’s eyes lit up at the question, “It’s going wonderfully. Just the other day, I was assisting the Head Auror on this case…”
“It can be hard, putting on a smile when you feel nothing at all.” Draco turned to find Harry looking off in the distance, smiling sadly to himself, “Most days I don’t even bother. Being around people helps, it takes you away from yourself for a moment, away from your own head.”
The crew shared uneasy glances with each other before parting ways without further comment. Blaise apparated to the Auror department, along with Longbottom and Dendron, where the witness was being questioned by local Aurors, meanwhile Draco and Harry made their way to the museum grounds. They received confirmation nearly an hour ago, but it’d been several hours since he was spotted there now. The chances of him still being in the city were low, but Draco tried not to think about it too much as he scoured in each direction for a sign that he was there.
On the subject of knocking before entering, Draco had mixed opinions. As a child, if Draco were to enter any room in the Manor before knocking, he was sure to receive lashings from his father due to the sheer disrespectful nature of it. Living at Hogwarts for most of his childhood, however, he realized that knocking before entering was not always required. In fact, most times, he rarely knocked before he entered a room, especially if he were entering the Slytherin dormitories or classrooms.
The pub they had entered was quite the establishment. By the time they arrived, it was packed full of people. The lighting was dim and dark, but the noise level was deafening, and Draco realized by the way Pansy was waving over to a few people sitting by the bar, that he recognized a few faces.
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at him, ready to lecture him, “You’re wrong, Draco. How dare you speak of your father that way.”
“Oh come on, Blaise,” Draco rolled his eyes at the other man, “you and I both know this is pointless! It’s just another ploy to throw us off of his trail.”
Draco sincerely doubted that. Still, he knew better than to argue with her once she'd set her mind on something.
“I understand your past is a bit...colorful. We all made mistakes when we were kids. But you seem like a changed man.” Anthony said, with a light pink tinge on his cheeks, eyes darting from Draco’s face to the noise from inside.
“Maybe another drink will make you talk,” Draco wanted to refuse, and really, he should have. Instead, he nodded, since words came a bit harder for him at that moment.
Time will pass, and he will heal. Those were the words he always said to himself. As Narcissa ran her fingers through his blonde locks, he stared intently at the portrait of their family resting over the fireplace. Time had passed, that much was true. But if he hadn’t healed by now, he doubted it would ever happen. As his mother held onto him, portrait Draco stared back into the eyes of twenty one year old Draco, mirroring his sadness in a way that it never had before. The sobs ceased, but Draco still stared at that portrait, waiting for the moment the sadness would leave its face. Only, it never did.
Robards smiled then, in such a way that caused the hairs on Draco’s neck to stand on edge, “Everything, Mr. Malfoy.”
“You don’t have to feel embarrassed.” He replied, stepping closer to Draco now so that they stood face-to-face, mere inches away, “I get it. We all do.”
“You never responded to my letter,” Harry looked up, now staring straight at him, “Did you ever receive it?”
Suddenly, Draco knew what this was about. Harry didn’t have to open it for Draco to understand what was inside, the look on Harry’s face alone spoke volumes.
Ginny, much to Draco’s surprise, also had chuckled at Harry’s bewildered expression before she leaned into Harry’s ear to say something over the loud noise, then excused herself to the lady’s room.
Several hours had passed since their assignment in Rotterdam and the team had already apparated back home. They reported their findings to Robards, who didn’t seem to care much for what they found, sorely disappointed they hadn’t caught him. The witness couldn’t tell Blaise much aside from what they’d already been told by Robards and they found no trace that he was even there, save the hint they found at the art museum. Draco knew his father was toying with him. He knew Lucius was five steps ahead of them and was aware that his son has been working with the aurors. How he knew, Draco had no idea, but he was determined to find out.
“Draco,” Theodore leaned closer to chat, despite the roaring noise of the public, “How’ve you been, mate? Haven’t seen you in a bit.”
After a long while of sipping tea in silence, Draco stood, dusting himself off, “Thank you for the tea, mother. It’s been delightful as always.”
“I don’t know, Pans,” Draco sighed, taking a sip of his cocktail. He grimaced when he tasted nothing but water and bitters.
Draco mumbled, still grasping onto his pillow as if it was a protective shield, “Just leave me here to die.”
it’d been since he’s felt someone touch him. Not even sexually, but to feel the firm arms of another wrapped around you. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt that.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled on the back of Blaise’s collar until he fell back on his chair, “You can flirt later. We’ve no time to waste, you prat.”
Draco smiled back at him, albeit a bit timidly, “Yes, that’s fine with me. It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Robards.”
Draco tried to suppress the bitterness in his tone, but found it a bit impossible as he raised an eyebrow, “Doesn’t being an Auror make it difficult to be inebriated every week?”
“You...you cannot be serious,” he muttered, taking note of everyone’s smiling, happy faces compared to the somber one on his.
He turned, to find her with a genuine look of affection on her face, making the guilt seep deeply into his stomach, “My dear, please do take care of yourself.”
He knew what she was going to say. ‘Draco dear, you have a duty to your family and our name. You can have as many hush-hush side romances as you want, but you need to carry on the Malfoy line blah blah blah’. He’s had this conversation more than once and was
Narcissa removed her hands from her lap, sipping her tea once more. Her eyes shifted to Draco’s and the sign of recognition hit him like a slap in the face.
As much as Draco wanted to remain scowling and indifferent towards the situation, forever stewing in his gloom, he found it was difficult to do so with the influence of alcohol coursing through his veins. He couldn’t deny himself the pleasure of conversing with his friends, and some acquaintances, while feeling particularly courageous after having a few drinks.
Draco stood over the edge of the pavement of Het Park, looking onward as the Nieuwe Maas revealed more buildings across the way. They had just apparated to Rotterdam, and he had found himself here - drawn to nature corrupted by steel buildings and polluted water. In that way, Rotterdam was very similar to London. Draco thought to himself as he watched the boats come and go that he would have liked to see Rotterdam in its heyday, before the surge of bold architecture was created to show its modernist teeth to the world. Not that it mattered, Draco was near certain they would be leaving quite soon. He was certain his father wouldn’t stick around long enough to make a second appearance. Yet, it all seemed too convenient that after he was spotted, the Auror department seemed to get word of it immediately. How did they know where to look? Unless, of course, the anonymous tip called in was Lucius himself hoping to throw them off of his trail. Still, Draco didn’t mind the sightseeing, even if it was a waste of time.
Harry nodded, letting Draco lead the way. As they walked out, Draco turned and saw the shimmery ink disappearing once they left. It served its purpose.
The truth was that since the case led him to Rotterdam, Draco couldn’t get his father out of his mind. At night, he dreamt of being condemned to that fiery wheel himself as Ixion was, watching as his father cast him out, grinning that barmy grin that only a power-hungry madman could give. At least it was a break from his usual nightmares involving Potter, especially now that Draco had finally come to terms with the truth he had been hiding for so long. Draco fancied him, perhaps since the beginning, but it hardly mattered now. He doubted Harry would ever feel the same way, and even if he did, the two could hardly stand being near one another long enough to not argue about some stupid matter or another. At least Draco could thank his lucky stars that he was able to suppress these feelings, if need be. He’d already been doing it for so long, what’s an extra dozen years or so? And still, with the looming threat of his father trying to use a Time-Turner to bring back the Dark Lord, Draco could hardly think about anything else.
“I was going to say cozy,” Harry met Draco’s gaze for a moment, startling the blonde wizard with an undeniable warmth behind his eyes and a slight, crooked smile. Just one look was enough to wreck him and Draco felt as though he’d collapse right then and there if he wasn’t gripping the wooden bed frame for support.
“I see,” Robards rubbed the scruff of his neck, “Well if that is the case, we’ve to capture the target first in order to find the Time-Turner.”
A moment paused before Draco realized he needed to step in and say something. The tension was palpable, even worse now that Irma made such an insensitive comment.
Draco hadn’t forgotten, he was just simply delaying the inevitable. He spent most Saturday afternoons with his mother, although she had been ‘unforeseeably detained’ this past weekend, or so she wrote to him. Despite it being noon on a Wednesday, today seemed to be the only time in which his mother would receive him.
Pansy sighed, “Believe me, I’m trying. It seems, however, the head of the Floo Network Authority has a personal vendetta against me.”
Granger joined their embrace by allowing Weasley to slink his arm around her waist, comforting Harry with her words, “You can’t fix everyone, Harry. Especially not someone as twisted as Draco Malfoy.”
“Draco? Are you listening?” Pansy held her purse over her shoulder, while her heels clicked against the floor.
“I’d say you know the majority of us pretty well, don’t you, Malfoy?” Blaise asked with a mischievous look in his eyes. Payback, Draco supposed, for not allowing him to flirt with Miss Dendron.
Draco leaned over to take a closer look at the wand. He wondered if it still felt the same in his hand, if it still answered to him. Grabbing it, he felt nothing at first. Then, he felt something – a gust of wind, like a whispering of sorts in the depths of his mind. Perhaps it was nothing. Perhaps it was the wand choosing him once again. Regardless, it felt good to have it back in his hands.
Potter led the way out to where the rest of the group was. Irma, Blaise, Neville and Ron had decided to join them as well. He already dreaded how this evening would go, but now that Draco’s been forced to work together with said people, he had to learn how to play nice.
As Justin came back with another drink – something that smelled strongly of gin, Draco realized that the laughter had died down and he couldn’t stop thinking about how undeniably
The trio wasted no time to enter the tunnels, stunned by the underground passages that seemed to go on forever. Though some parts of the tunnel were exposed to the outside light, most of it was enclosed within. The only light visible to them when deep within the tunnels was the
Draco had decent conversations with the group, especially Lovegood and Justin, who had enwrapped him into a conversation about current events in the Wizarding world, something Draco appreciated, after having lived in a Muggle neighborhood for so long. He found that he was even able to have a conversation with the Weasleys, including Granger, without a single insult being thrown. It was mostly mundane conversation, a bit awkward at best, but it was better than sitting there scowling, as Draco would have done without all the alcohol in his system. Trying to be amicable towards Granger was a bit more difficult, considering she stared at him as if he was about to hop on the table and start hexing everyone. Instead, Draco decided to fight that battle another day and avoided her presence as best as he could.
They now stood in Parcs de la Pétrusse, overlooking the view of the Adolphe bridge and the Pétrusse Casemates. It was as Draco expected, a city built on the ruins of another, with Roman and medieval architecture still prevalent throughout the city, with a tiny bit of modernism sprinkled in there as well. Yet again, their journey was proved to be futile as Lucius left no indication he was ever there. Potter, Blaise and Draco scoured the city for at least an hour, galavanting through every museum they could find within walking distance to the park where he was spotted, and even then, nothing of significance was found.
“How can you defend him? After all this time, knowing everything that he’s done...and you still defend him?”
“I’m sorry, I need to-,” Draco scraped his chair loudly against the floor as he stood abruptly and made his way to the bathroom.
If his anxiety was bad before, it was certainly worse now. Potter placed his hand on the stall door as if he were going to push it open but stopped before doing so, simply placing it there to let Draco know he was right on the other side.
Ron looked like he might fall over from the way he was trying to hold back laughter, while Granger looked like she desperately wanted to get Weasley home.
Neither Draco nor Harry said anything. Draco was focusing too hard on trying not to throw up, while Harry just stood there, looking concerned. Longbottom gave Harry a firm pat on the back, while Ginny gave him a peck on the cheek as the pair headed out together. At the time, Draco was too drunk to notice. Even Lovegood had left, and the only ones left on the street were Harry, Draco, Blaise, Justin and Anthony. Eventually Justin and Anthony had left, while Draco sat on a bench, focusing hard on trying not to see double.
Potter, ignoring Draco’s side comment, spoke up for the first time, surprising Draco enough to render him speechless, “Are you going to stay long?”
“Years? So...you weren’t living at home after the war?” Harry’s eyes met his and Draco felt his stomach doing flips inside his body.
“Do we know if he has any accomplices?” Harry had a particularly determined facial expression as he asked the question.
Draco felt his palms start to sweat as he glanced at the Aurors passing by his glass-enclosed office, throwing him dirty looks while Robards had his back turned away from them. This surely couldn’t be good.
“How do you know he hasn’t used it already?” Draco asked, more out of sheer curiosity than anything. He wanted to know what they knew before letting on any information he already had.
It had been a little over a week since he burned the letter, and since then, Draco had done well to isolate himself to the best of his abilities. All he had done since then was bury himself in paperwork and refuse Pansy’s request for another weekend of drinking. It was pure luck, or possibly misfortune, that he received these summons at such a pivotal point in his life, in which Potter was suddenly popping up
“Yes, and I will tell you the same thing I told him. I cannot help you.” The man finally seemed to take notice of Blaise and Harry standing behind Draco, eying warily at their Auror robes.
“Congratulations on the new job!” Justin Finch-Fletchley and Anthony Goldstein came into view and Draco just simply blinked at them in return.
Draco leaned over the bathroom sink, breathing heavily as he stared at himself in the mirror. The familiarity of it all made the bile in the back of his throat rise, but what was left of the rational part of his mind refused to let Draco make a fool of himself now – especially not when Harry
“So…what does that have to do with my past?” Draco felt his hands shake a bit from where he placed them in his lap. He bit his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood, hoping to snap him out of whatever trance he was in at that moment.
Draco couldn’t maintain eye contact and instead focused intently on the menu despite having ordered already, “No.”
There it was. The overwhelming truth, that isn’t so overwhelming for someone who already knew. It was no secret to Draco that the Malfoy family had a Time-Turner in their possession. It was his father’s, so he never got the chance to use it himself. The fact that they hired him onto this case wasn’t surprising at all, now that he understood the real reasoning behind it. Even so, he couldn’t help but feel a bit cheated. Not only was he being used as a pawn in the Ministry’s game of cat and mouse between them and his father, but now he was to undermine his entire family legacy just to arrest his father and capture the Time-Turner. Yet, the depressing truth was that even if he didn’t take the job, they would likely capture him anyways, letting the Malfoy name forever rot in Azkaban with his father. This way, however, Draco could at least pass on their legacy in less devastating ways.
His tone was enough to make Draco’s blood boil. A younger version of himself would have retorted with something snarky and arrogant, but he was older and wiser now and he refused to snoop down to Weasley’s level. Before he could reply, however, Harry gave Ronald a pointed look that you’d give to a child – a look that screamed ‘play nice’.
Draco wanted to believe that to be true, but a part of him seriously doubted that. Harry was a far better person than he was, time had shown that. Still, the sentiment was nice. Clearly, he didn’t think him to be an arrogant arse anymore, or if he did, he kept it to himself.
“It’s the only way to keep our name in the good graces of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.” Narcissa said that afternoon over biscuits and tea.
“I was having lunch with Blaise,” Draco replied, while muttering under his breath, “not that it’s any of your business.”
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows at the blonde wizard, either thinking him an idiot or utterly deranged, “So that’s it then, you’re going to throw your entire career and any chance to see your father again out the window, just like that?”
“Draco!” Narcissa met him at the door this time, still dressed in her loungewear - a long, black gown with intricate lacing on the sleeves to make it look like snake scales. How very fitting for a Malfoy, Draco thought to himself.
“What does that mean?” Draco asked Blaise when they sealed the well up again, but the dark-haired wizard didn’t answer and instead shook his head and laughed.
“So” she sat down in her chaise stationed in front of the fireplace. Draco sat opposite of her. “Might I ask what this is about?”
He still had no idea what Harry was asking, but it didn’t stop him from staring at the man, with a surprisingly open expression.
Looking up at the Manor, which seemed rather menacing as a thick layer of fog covered the ground and thunder roared in the distance, he remembered his letter from his mother. He knew he was early for tea, but it didn’t matter. After the day he had, he quickly realized that nothing he thought mattered actually mattered.
Despite the fact that the world around him was spinning, Draco couldn’t help but focus deeply on the man’s appearance. It
“-holds a strong energy. I know,” Harry gave him an understanding look, before walking over to Draco, “It takes some getting used to.”
“So, are you feeling better about the situation now?” Weasley asked, swinging an arm around Harry’s shoulders as if to cheer him up.
“Point taken.” Harry muttered under his breath, noticing Draco’s crabby mood seemed to be less about the question and more about the reason they were there.
At one point, Blaise patted Draco’s back, “Come on Malfoy, loosen up a bit. What happened to the Draco I knew in sixth year who would sneak firewhisky into the Slytherin dorms?”
“The Bock Casemates, of course!” Blaise replied as he recognized the fortress behind them, “I saw a sign leading down to a tunnel.”
“My dear, we’ve ALL known for quite some time. Years even.” Her cackling turned into small giggles, but her face was still as amused as ever.
Pansy gave him an incredulous look, “Draco, we’re going to a Muggle bar, you can’t wear your robes out like that!”
He knew Blaise was right; Not going would be foolish, despite knowing that it would likely be a fruitless endeavor. Regardless, if there was a reason his father decided to go to Luxembourg, he knew it had to be in search of a Curse-Breaker.
Pansy gave him an incredulous look before taking another sip of her martini. It wasn’t Buckingham Palace, sure, but it was comfortable enough. Though, he supposed moving to a nicer loft closer to the Ministry wouldn’t be terrible.
The manor was silent save his yelling. Draco thought the glass would shake from the noise, but if they could withstand the screams of torture from his classmates, they could withstand him screaming now.
“Potter, what do you know about Luxembourg?” His tone verged on excitement, to which Potter could only blink in return, mouth agape.
Pansy’s eyes nearly jumped out of her head while Blaise, Malfoy, and the rest of the group laughed at her facial expression.
Draco had been through it all. He had faced death on more than one occasion, he had lived with the Dark Lord and his evil aunt Bellatrix, and above all else, he had survived the war. He thought by staying alive through it all, the universe would be kinder to him. Somehow, by showing he was more than the cowardly child he was in school, he would be absolved of his sins. Yet, time had proven nothing but the fact that he was, is, and always will be a coward - a stupid teenager that thought he had no choice. He stared into the sickly face of the man he looked up to his whole life, feeling nothing but sorrow for him. Maybe he didn’t have a choice back then, but at least Draco could recognize his choices now and realize that even if he is a coward, he isn’t his father.
“I’m surprised you’d pick a place like this,” Harry spoke to him first, pointing out the design and architecture of the building - quite rustic - a small, family-type place.
I'm hoping to update this and my other fic (a dragon age fic for those of you that are interested) semi-regularly, hopefully on a weekly/biweekly basis! It ultimately depends on how these next few weeks go because I will be going back to school in the fall, but regardless, I will continue writing this fic as often as I can! Thank you to those who've stuck with this fic and I promise there will be more to come soon! Xoxo
He sighed, knowing that was as close to an apology as he would ever get from her. He muttered an ‘ok’, and without another glance, walked outside and apparated home. It was foolish of him to hope for more and yet he always did. Of course, Draco realized over the years that he’d been a fool about many things. What’s another foolish hope to add to the list of his many, many faults?
Something unfamiliar in Anthony’s eyes made Draco want to retreat, as if he already knew what he was thinking. He was no idiot, he saw the way Anthony looked at him, remembered what his touch felt like the first time they went out drinking and his hands had a mind of their own. If Harry hadn’t been there, he would have likely enjoyed it more. But with the reality of him being just a few paces away, standing within his
They could hear the man grumbling and the cluttering of several objects before the door swung open, revealing a shady, red-faced man with a white beard and wizened skin, “I said go away! What do you want?”
Wordlessly, Lucius got up and walked out of the room. Narcissa called after him, but not even she could fix this situation with her words. Draco stood there, feeling the silent sobs afflict his body like a shockwave. He waited until Lucius was completely out of view to let it out, and this time, he didn’t hold back the hot, fat tears as they rolled down his face. His mother said nothing, but watched him sadly as the tears escaped his body.
Several days had passed since their last lead and Draco was becoming restless, awaiting news regarding his father’s whereabouts. That particular early Friday morning at around 4 AM, Draco’s peace was disturbed when he received a guest via Floo.
Draco smiled back, scratching at the nape of his neck, “His name is Mittens. He’s quite friendly if you want to hold him.”
Draco hummed, staring off in the distance at some ornate painting of the Malfoy family, back when they were happy. Lucius looked as stern as ever, but young Draco was smiling a bit as he looked up to his mother, and for a moment they shared a glance with a glint of something in their eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place.
Harry broke eye contact and hummed, as he looked over at the others who had now taken over the dance floor. Anthony too, called over by Justin and Blaise, had gone to dance, leaving Harry and Draco alone at the table.
Her words helped a bit, remembering that Harry was possibly drunk too, and if Draco was lucky, he wouldn’t remember. Granted, luck was seldom on his side.
Footsteps echoed inside the men’s room until they reached the sink and turned the faucet off. Draco didn’t dare look to see who it was, but he had a feeling it was Blaise. It always was Blaise who came to calm him when Draco embarrassed himself like this.
It didn’t seem to work, which confirmed Draco’s suspicions that the well itself was not magical in any way. Yet, if that were the case, then why keep it sealed with rocks and debris?
Sébastien shrugged, “I’ve never met the man. I serve wizards from all over the world. My guess is that he found me through reputation.”
Draco sighed, taking a seat on the park bench to catch his breath for a moment. Potter sat next to him, while Blaise took another lap around the park, hoping to find something the others might have missed. Draco watched as the leaves began to fall, just barely yellowing before they inevitably met their end. If he were his father, where would he go? Well, if he were searching for a Curse-Breaker in Luxembourg, he couldn’t imagine they would be within the city. A Curse-Breaker was daring, often venturing into tombs and caves and such. A thought came to him then, causing Draco to sprang to his feet upon the realization.
“I’m not a child!” His voice shook and for a moment, Draco thought he’d lost himself, “I know, okay? I saw his picture on their board, they’re just waiting to put a big, red X on it, I know it!”
His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his name being called. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise to him that he would see her here, especially since she just moved into a flat not far from his place. Even so, when he saw her standing in front of him, he was at a loss for words.
“Oh relax, I’m coming,” Draco rolled his eyes at the pair, remembering to leave his now discarded robe folded on the chair.
“I…I don’t have any information to give you. My family was pardoned, so I don’t-“ Draco stammered, although he tried desperately to keep his tone even, despite the fear that coiled deep in his spine.
on the other hand, well…that was a different story. His mother prevented him from being disowned, as long as he married a pure blood witch, then he could have as many liaisons as he wished. That
“Don’t be stupid, Draco. You’re going.” With that, Blaise entered the fireplace and Floo’d himself out of Draco’s flat, leaving him standing there, huffing with anger.
It was amazing to Draco that Harry had been living among muggles for years now, and the papers had yet to pinpoint the superstar’s home. Draco had always imagined he would be living in some posh manor in the countryside, or some trendy loft in London. He hardly imagined Harry living in his own ancestral home. Although, he supposed it made sense, given his close connection to Sirius. Draco hadn’t ever spoken to the man before his untimely demise.
Hello everyone, thanks again for checking out my story :) I will be trying to post new chapters as frequently as I can. Please let me know in the comments what you think of the story so far!
“Mr. Malfoy, is that you? Please come in.” Robards' voice rose above the idle chatter in Draco’s mind, beckoning him to enter.
“Why would Lucius write that on this specific painting?” Harry looked around to see if there were anymore magical writings, but no, just the one.
“In all our years at Hogwarts, I’ve never seen you this plastered, Malfoy,” Harry smiled at him in a way that was either genuine, or genuinely making fun of him, he couldn’t decide.
“Malfoy, you idiot, I was changing!” She looked terribly offended but made no move to cover herself up.
“I don’t care about marriage,” Draco muttered, feeling his hands begin to shake from under the table.
Harry turned to him, replying, “You go on ahead, I’ll take a long lunch. I doubt Robards would mind.”
“As you’re all aware of, this is our new recruit, Draco Malfoy. You have all been selected by him to work on a top-secret case involving a dark artefact. We believe Lucius Malfoy, former Death-Eater, may be trying to use a true Time-Turner to bring the Dark Lord back. For those of you who were at the case briefing last week, you’ll know that we lost track of the target somewhere in Belgium.”
He should have been used to it by now, really. Panic attacks were not new to him. There were many nights when he would wake up with the same sensations – barely coming to, with the growing numbness of his fingers giving him warning of what was to come. And yet, each and every time, it took him by surprise.
in rhythm like a soldier’s march as he watched the moon lighting up the sky. It was late and he couldn’t sleep - nightmares again. Yet the radiance of that soft glow against his pale features brought him that sense of calm that he needed. At his feet, he felt Mittens figure-eighting between his legs, feeling his soft fur caress against his skin as the kitten vibrated with contentment. It was a nice feeling, serving as a gentle reminder that he was not alone, despite constantly feeling like he was.
It was a small thing, but it gave him hope – that one day, Draco would be okay. He wouldn’t need to reminisce about the past, nor would he need the aid of an alley cat to calm him down. Time would pass and he would heal.
Pansy sighed exasperatedly, rolling his limp body around to face her, “Oh come on, Draco. Stop throwing a pity party for yourself and buy me food!”
