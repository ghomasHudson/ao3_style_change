Draco straightened himself on the chair and closed his book quickly, going to grab his bag. Harry frowned and reached over to place his hand on Draco, which made the blond freeze almost immediately. "Don't leave, please. I really need help with this potion." Harry mumbled and waited for Draco's reaction. He waited for what seemed like minutes before Draco shuffled in his seat and pulled his hand away from Harry's, his ears heating up with a red tint as he put his bag back down in the chair beside him. "Fine." He huffed and put his book back on the table, opening to the page he had just closed previously. Harry's smile returned and he looked down at his book, squinting so he could read. Harry would open his mouth, quietly uttering each word his eyes drifted over, he would lean down to look closer at the pictures, he would glance up at Draco every so often. Draco wet his lips and slammed his palm into the creaky table as he shot an icy glare over at Harry. Harry jumped slightly and looked up sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. "Read in silence," Draco grunted and looked back down to his book, noticing Harry shuffling a little in his seat. "Sorry, old habits die hard I guess." He grinned and looked back down to his book, now silently mouthing the words as he spoke. He didn't make a sound, but Draco looked up and watched his lips part as each word his eye drifted over. Draco's lips thinned and he looked over Harry's uniform, his tie was uneven, his robe laid lazily and sloppily on his shoulders, his sweater vest pulled down a little too far, maybe Harry was also struggling this morning with his outfit like Draco was.
Harry, now back in the castle, stormed up to the Gryffindor common room, his foul mood being clear as day to his two best friends who were trailing a ways behind him. They gave each other wary glances before sitting across from Harry on separate chairs, Ron's eyes averted to the ground. "Ron you bloody scared him off! You're absolutely insufferable!!" He yelled, his arms flinging up in the air as the other Gryffindors made their way up the stairs to the dorm rooms. Ron sighed and crossed his arms, finally looking up at Harry only to be met with a deadly glare from his brunette friend. "I didn't want him there, Harry! He was being a twit!!" He yelled back, Hermione staring at the exchange between them. "No, you were being a twit!" He retorted, falling back into the chair with his arms crossed. Hermione put her hands out gently, trying to settle down her boyfriend and best friend. "Calm down please, can someone explain what this is about?" She asked, her head tilting to the side. She looked over at Harry, who was staring at the fire with a newfound interest, and let out a sigh. "It's about Draco, all I did was ask if they got any sleep and he commented on all of us snoring which made him get no sleep! Honestly Harry I don't even know why you invited him! He doesn't deserve to be spoken to at all!" Ron explained and shot a glare over at Harry who started to turn red from irritation. "Ron, don't be so rude, Draco apologized to most of us at his trial! He deserves a second chance, you know he was forced into it." Hermione said before Harry could say anything to Ron he would soon regret.
"Don't be repulsive, and what new problem? Bloody hell, Pansy you act like I have a problem with the prat every second of the day." He retorted, his eyes sliding open to shoot an icy stare over at the female but her clear signs of being completely unbothered made Draco look forward to the same wall Pansy was pushing her palm out to.
Draco liked it when Harry would tilt his head ever so slightly as he asked a question, it reminded him of a puppy hearing an unfamiliar sound. Draco licked his lips and parted them to speak, but nothing came out. Why was Harry sitting in front of him? Why did he seem like he wasn't even hungover when Draco looked like he just shagged someone in the bathrooms? Why was he pushing Draco so much where Draco didn't want to resist anymore, he just wanted to give in to his temptation and kiss the bloke senseless. Harry cleared his throat, which snapped Draco out of his stare. Harry had a soft pink hue painting his cheeks as he placed his Potions book on the table, how long had Draco been staring? Why was Harry blushing? So many stupid questions that Draco had no good answer for. He pulled his eyebrows together and thinned his lips, watching Harry open his page to the same one he was on, glancing over at Draco's book to make sure he had gotten the right number. "You don't care if I join you right? I need to study for the liquid luck potion as well.  Ron and Hermione are too busy... well, they are just too busy to help me right now." Harry asked, trailing off when he brought up his two friends. Draco knew what he was going to say, they were too busy snogging each other senseless and cast Harry out like a third wheel.
Hey Hey Hey! The second Chapter is out!! Hope you all enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
Pansy's expression grew soft as she glanced at Draco from the corner of her eye, he truly looked pitiful. She steadied her tone when she opened her mouth to speak, "You know, he was quite shocked when you walked out. He definitely wanted to talk to you," She hummed, biting her lip as she watched his expression carefully. "He has probably been wanting to talk to you, Draco. But you push him away all the time because you're afraid you'll hurt him again.." She brought up, clearly hitting a soft spot. Draco winced as he went to grab his left forearm; squeezing tight. The dark mark still there but always covered up, it didn't change the fact that it was still there and prominent as ever. Pansy reached over to grab Draco's hand that was placed on his forearm, giving it a firm squeeze. Draco shook her hand away and dropped his hand to his side, looking down at the brick road. Harry always had that smile on his face, like he was supposed to be happy for everyone while all the other students sat in darkness due to the war. Draco hated that, he hated the fact that Potter remotely thought he was supposed to be the pick-me-up even after he saved all of the Wizarding World.
The two young wizards stayed there for hours, just looking at the stars and not a single word was spoken. At some point, Harry had fallen asleep with his head gently pressed on Draco's shoulder. His breath was shallow and quiet, a few snores and mumbled escaping his lips anytime he shifted around. Draco now used to the pressure on his shoulder, kept a steady gaze on the twinkling stars above them. He was stiff, not sure if moving was a good idea with Harry pressed so close to him. He broke his stare from the stars and twisted his head to look at Harry, his chin pressing to his forehead softly. He couldn't believe it really, it's only been a few days but Draco was this close to Harry and he wasn't snapping at him every second, it was nice. Draco hesitantly brought his hand up, his movements slow like a snail, and gently pressed his thumb over Harry's lips. Just like he had imagined, they were soft and plump, definitely made for kissing and that alone. Draco thinning his lips and took his hand away, looking back up to the sky to distract himself from his wandering mind.
When the coast was clear, Harry slowly slipped through the password locked the door and followed Draco up the stairs. Having already been here before, he had a general idea where everything was, but he had never been up to where the dorm rooms were. Harry stuck close to Draco, but he couldn't keep his eyes from wandering around at all the doors. They had silver number plates on them to distinguish each room from the other. When Draco stopped, Harry bumped into his back a bit having been distracted, he apologized quickly before looking up at the number plate; It had black, finely carved numbers on it that read
The male across the bar poured the clear liquid to the brim of each glass, looking at the two in almost pitty. He put the bottle away and walked away to a couple that stumbled up to the counter. Draco shot Pansy a quick look before he quickly bottomed down each shot. He slammed down the last glass and coughed, hitting his chest hard. Whatever that liquor was, he was pretty sure vodka, was bloody strong and would definitely get him blackout drunk. Pansy followed in suit with a smile on her lips, she gingerly placed the glasses down and let out a breath, "Wowie! Muggles know where it's at!" She said, giggling slightly as she yelled over the music. Draco nodded with a frown as he felt a hand placed on the small of his back, making him flinch slightly at the contact. Luna had her hands on both Pansy and Draco, a friendly smile curled on her lips. "We're going to Honeydukes if you'd like to join us!" She informed, her speech slurred due to the alcohol she had consumed. Pansy's eyes widened as she looked at the blonde female, she was surprised. Why would she still invite them to wherever they were going when it seemed they clearly wanted nothing to do with the group. Before Draco could even utter a word, Pansy parted her lips, "Of course we'd love to!".
After some small talk, they finally walked out of the building and made their way to the Shrieking Shack. It had started to snow sometime through their game, which Draco didn't mind too much. Harry was walking with Draco, behind the rest of the group, and the silence that surrounded them was comfortable for Draco but awkward for Harry. He had just jerked off to the guy standing right beside him, he even moaned his name at the end of it. What if Draco heard? How long was he standing there? What would he think of him? Did he like him back? So many questions with no answers unless he asked, and that was not happening. When everyone made it to the Shrieking Shack and up the creaky stairs, the pile of sleeping bags sorted themselves out after Hermione cast a simple spell on them. "Everyone has a sleeping bag." She yawned and claimed one right beside the window. Ron moved his closer to hers, snuggling up beside her when she climbed into hers. Everyone started to occupy their sleeping bag, and Harry and Draco were standing there watching everyone climb into one. When there were only two left, which happened to be right beside each other, Harry moved to claim the one right beside Luna. He let out a yawn and slid down into it, looking up at the shifting ceiling of the shack. Draco slowly slid in his sleeping bag beside Harry and also watched the ceiling. "You know what. How about we go star gaze outside instead? I'm not too tired yet." Harry requested, turning to face Draco who already had his eyes closed to try and sleep.
After Herbology Draco went in search of his robe. He was shivering half the class because he only had two, rather thin, layers on. He walked into the Library and over to the table he had been seated at. The robe was nowhere to be seen, and people were not sitting at that table so it's not like he could look around it or under it. Draco gripped his hair and let out a heavy sigh before turning on his heels and out the doors of the library, of course, someone took it and Draco had a rising suspicion he knew exactly who it was. He walked down the hall, his hands in his pants pocket and silver eyes averted towards the ground. Walking absentmindedly, he collided with another person, watching their feet slip as they fell on their arse. He looked up surprised, not expecting to see the messy rat nest of brunette hair and viridescent eyes staring right back at him with just the same about of surprise. Draco huffed and crossed his arm, putting all his weight on one hip as he leaned down slightly. "What are you doing on the floor?" Draco snickered, watching Harry stumbled upon his feet. He stepped forward a few times, poking into Draco's sternum with a sharp-pointed finger. "Oh, can it." He groaned, but soon his expression grew to one of concern as he looked over Draco. "You're shivering?..." He pointed out, watching the blond wrap his arms around himself. "Yeah,  it's bloody freezing and I lost my robe. Do you have it?" He asked, rubbing his biceps a little.
The blistering cold air hit pale cheeks as Draco stepped out of the warm confines of the Hogwarts castle. His cheeks flush from the sudden drop in temperature, his chin tucking slightly further into the dark green and bright silver scarf that was hung rather slack around his neck and placed gingerly on his shoulders. His pale blue eyes flicked up to the snow riddled sky, his eyelashes hitting the tops of his eyelids as he stared at the light grey clouds. He let out a heavy sigh as he stepped down cobble stairs, his right arm hooked gently around his shoulder bag as he made his way through the main courtyard. A rather short bob of black hair followed behind Dracos heels, a sly smirk on the female's lips as they walked in silence. She slid up to Dracos side and clung to his left arm, her eyes batting up to look at Draco. "Draco dear, it's rather cold out today, mind holding me?" Pansy Parkinson asked, her small smirk growing slightly when Draco shoved her off his arm. "Bugger off Pansy, you have a robe." He huffed, his arms folding into a tight cross over his chest as he walked to the rather large and elderly oak tree that was just shy of the middle of the courtyard. The golden yellow and dark orange leaves were scattered about the cobble street, scuttering across the stone when a gust of wind blew into the enclosed area.
at the lad." she hummed quietly and bent down to pick up her leather bag. Draco scoffed and shook his head quickly, rather unimpressed at Pansy's attempt to get him riled up.
He found himself liking being tucked away from the large crowd, usually, in crannies he found no one would visit. He ran a hand through his combed back and gelled hair as he snuck another glance over at Harry, this time their eyes met. Draco paused, his eyes never leaving Harrys' and Harry doing the same for what felt like forever. He soon cocked an eyebrow slightly before he looked back down to the orange liquid in his glass. He heard shuffling at the table, making his curiosity spike but he kept his head down. Harry made his way over to the table Draco and Pansy shared, giving the two Slytherins a sweet smile. "Malfoy, I didn't expect you to be here?" He asked, putting most of his weight on his left leg which Draco noticed he'd do a lot. Luna skipped over to their table with a bright smile, "Harry, I invited them!" She said, tilted her head to get a better look at Pansy. Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise and rubbed the back of his untamed hair, letting out a soft giggle that made Draco's heart skip a beat. "Oh! I didn't know, you should've told me, Luna! Why don't you join us over here?" Harry asked, pointing to the round table behind him.
Draco swallowed hard as he watched Pansys back before she disappeared into the store. He cleared his throat and shoved his hands into his coat pocket, averting his eyes from Potters. "Yes well, I would need to be bloody sozzled to talk to you properly." He scoffed, his tone harsh as almost as he wanted the boy to walk away. Harry only let out a giggle as he stepped forwards a bit so the tips of their shoes were touching. That action made Dracos breath hitch as he looked into those emerald eyes he so desperately wanted to look at all evening. "I guess you're sozzled then." He smirked and slid beside Draco in one quick motion. "Walk with me?" He asked, taking a slow step forward to see if Draco would follow. Draco slowly stepped forward, following Harry's stride. "I didn't know you fancied sweets." He muttered, trying to fill their silent walk to Honeydukes. Draco snorted and shook his head, "I bloody despise sweets." He retorted, watching Harry's smile fade from the corner of his mouth. Draco knew Harry actually quite liked sweets, watching him dig into them at the feasts in the Great Hall.
Harry whipped his body around and grabbed Draco's wrist quickly and without much thought. "Wait," he said, his grip tight and clear that he did not intend to let go unless Draco twisted around.  When he did, Harry loosened his grip and looked up, silver meeting emerald. "Draco I'm trying to be nice to you, but you make it so hard when you push me away so quickly. Can we please just talk?" He asked, his eyes and expression hopeful for a yes, almost desperate for a yes. Draco parted his lips, still in slight shock from the sudden grab. "I-" He started, but closed his lips and formed a thin line. He tugged his wrist away from Harry and stuffed it in his coat pockets, looking down at the brunette. "What's there to even talk about, you just need to learn personal boundaries." He spat, squinting his eyes when Harry's smile dropped completely. Harry took a few steps closer and pushed a finger into Draco's chest, his breathing getting quicker as he thought of something to say. "Personal Boundaries are one thing, but being a complete prat is another. Draco, pushing our past behind us, just talk to me?" He asked, his tone pleading as he poked Draco's chest a few times.
Harry made his way out to the main courtyard, sitting down with a bit of force on the fountain as he wrapped the scarf around his neck. He let it hand rather slack on his shoulders as he gripped it tightly, bringing it up to get a small whiff. The comforting smell of faded Red Mahogany Wood, Golden Apple, and Fresh Lavender filling his nose in an instant, and he almost buckled with how good it smelt. "Is this what he always smells like?" he asked himself and took another small whiff of the scarf before letting it go, completely infatuated with the scent. He let out a sigh and straightened his legs out, scraping the snow off the cobblestone flooring as it squeaked on his shoes. He dropped his head, the edge of the scarf hitting his exposed forehead, taking in a breath of fresh air. He heard two familiar voices approaching the courtyard, making him lift his head and look in the direction of said voices. His eyes brightened a bit and his lips curled into a smile at the sight of Draco walking towards the castle with Pansy right beside him. "Draco! Hey!" He yelled and stood up, staying put when he saw the panic in Draco's eyes and the hesitant smile on Pansy's lips. Pansy hooked her arm around Draco's and dragged him into one of the side entrances of the castle, leaving Harry completely dumbstruck and just staring stupidly towards empty space.
Harry watched Draco pull off his sweater and let it fall to the floor, a puddle of water forming around the wet piece of clothing as he worked on the buttons of his white dress shirt. He let it fall down his pale arms, the faded dark mark still under his skin as he twisted his arm to get a good look at it. harry had only given the dark mark a sideways glance, he was too focused on his shoulder blades that poked out any time he moved his arms. He was looking over his back, a few moles and freckles catching his eyes, they reminded him of falling snow in the pattern that they were in. His eyes soon fell on his side, his hip bone poked out from the rim of his boxers that were visible from the rim of his pants. His skin was pale, so pale it almost glistened up the dim lighting and Harry wanted to reach over and run his fingertips over his skin just to feel how smooth it felt, it definitely looked smooth. Harry clutched at the hoodie Draco had given him and for some reason couldn't pull his eyes away from Draco's body.
Draco stopped by the edge of the water, rolling down his sleeve to cover his hand while he brushed the snow off a large rock to the right of him. He sat down on it, holding his hands together in his lap while he glanced at Pansy. Pansy took her seat beside Draco, pushing her body close to his so they could warm each other up. "Talk." She hummed and looked at the frozen-over lake glistening in the sunlight. "Alright. Potter invited me out to play Truth or Drink with his friends, I accepted and said a few things I shouldn't have, soon we went to the Shrieking Shack to sleep, but Potter and I decided against sleeping and to go stargazing. He fell asleep a few hours before morning and..." He explained but paused at the end as he looked out to the lake. "And?" Pansy asked, rubbing her hands together to warm them up as she waited for Draco to continue. "Pansy I almost kissed him... I was so close... He was wearing my hoodie and he was sleeping right on my shoulder..." He continued, his head dropped down to look at his hands fidgetting with the string that came from his hoodie pocket.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and let out a sigh, his lips still tingling a bit from the kiss as he licked them to feel how chapped they were. "Okay, I'll try. What if he just doesn't come to classes?" He asked and rubbed his hands together nervously, hearing Hermione hum beside him. "Well, we'll work on that if it happens." She answered and stood up, looking down at Harry who still looked out of it. "How was it?" She asked with a wiggle of her eyebrows and a gentle jab to his side with her elbow. "His lips are... really soft, like little clouds." He mumbled as he reminded himself of the feeling of Draco's lips on his and the look of relief in his eyes. Hermione giggled and tugged a strand of Harry's hair. "Alright lover boy, go do some studying and no kissing thoughts," Hermione said with a wink as she sauntered up the stairs to the dorms. "Hey, 'mione!" Harry yelled, trying to catch her attention before she walked down the hall. Hermione peaked her head from the stairs, waiting for Harry to say something. "Maybe don't tell Ron just yet." He quickly said, watching her face twist to one of fondness as she nodded and started her way back up the steps.
He slowly started pumping his fist, throwing his head back on the wood wall. He spread his legs a little bit, soft and quiet moans escaping his lips making him throw his hands on his mouth. He closed his eyes and quickened the pace of his hand, more pre-cum leaking out with each pump. He imagined Draco pinning him down on soft and silky green sheets of his bed, their lips pressed together firmly and comfortable like they fit perfectly with each other, Draco was palming him through his jeans slowly just to make sure the moment didn't fly past. He imagined Draco flipping him over, pulling his ass up into his groin, his clothed dick rubbing up against Harry's ass and the friction being amazing. He thought about Draco being gentle with him, guiding him through everything like how first times were meant to be done, a loving smile on that perfectly shaped face. Without another thought other than the smile on Draco's face, his abdomen boiled and his cum shot out in hot strands while he groaned out the blond's name. He panted and collapsed onto the wall, his arms falling down to the cold tile flooring. He was falling for Draco Malfoy, and hard. After cleaning himself up and fixing his disheveled look, he walked out of the bathroom right into the chest of someone.
Hey, y'all! So, I'm really sorry this chapter is a tiny bit shorter than the others, I wanna leave everything else for a separate chapter! I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!!!
Draco really shouldn't have just walked out of the Hog's Head, he should have stood his ground by the bathroom and spoke properly to Harry. He should have made small talk at the table, he should have gave offered to buy him those lemon drops instead of watching him walk over to the cashier and buy them for himself; so many should of's and no actions. He sighed and cut into the egg again, shoving it in his mouth to chew hard. "So, the potions test is today, did you two study?" Blaise asked while chewing on a piece of golden-brown toast, a small smile on his lips as he watched Draco eat. Draco whipped his head to the side, his eyes wide and eyebrow pulled together with his mouth slightly agape. "Potion test?" He asked, gulping rather hard as the stuck egg in his throat. Blaise nodded and tapped the old book he had placed on the table. "I studied, it's making liquid luck right?" Pansy asked, leaning around Draco to look at Blaise. He nodded and leaned back as well, ignoring that Draco was in the middle of them. "Yeah, Slughorn told us about it last week." He said, shrugging his shoulders as he leaned back into the table to take another bite of his egg. Draco bit his lip and slammed his palm down on the table, his fork clinking a few times on the plate. "Damn it! That damn slug, I don't remember him saying that!" Draco yelled, soon regretting it as his migraine kicked his brain around like it was a soccer ball. Blaise snickered and shook his head, looking at Draco, "No, you don't remember because in that class you always have your eyes on Harry." He stated matter-of-factly watching Draco shoot him a rather spin chilling glare. Blaise was use to those glares, so he just looked away at his plate to busy himself with a puddle of egg yolk.
The room became quiet, and Draco squinted at the brightness of the light Blaise had turned on just before leaving. He let out a painful moan as he twisted to the side to place his feet on the cold stone floor. He rubbed his abdomen as he let out a yawn, walking around the bed to the chest at the foot of it. He unlatched it and gathered out his clean uniform. He slid his arms through the white button-up, pressing his chin against his bare collarbones to look down as he was pushing each button through the slits. Draco rubbed his throbbing head as he pulled out the uniform pants. He slipped into them rather swiftly and buttoned them, zipping them up with a short tug. He stuffed the button-up into the rim of his pants and wrapped his tie around his neck, tieing a quick knot and pushing it up to tighten it a bit. He slid the black sweater vest over the dress shirt and put on some socks; slipping into his already tied shoes. He grabbed his robe, stuffing it in his satchel as he made his way out of the dorm. He walked slowly down the stair, only hearing the crackling of the fire in the common room; everyone had left for breakfast. He slipped out of the password locked door and walked down the dungeon corridor. He let out a long yawn as the migraine in his head throbbed with quite a bit of force.

He reeled back and cupped his nose in pain, looking up a bit at the person who he hit. It was Draco, who looked like he was just about to knock. Harry's cheeked quickly became red as he looked down at his shoes, fidgetting with the cuff of the hoodie. "Merlin, I thought you died in there." Draco teased and looked behind Harry in the bathroom. Harry shook his head and rubbed his neck after moving his hand away from his nose. "Everyone is going to head to the Shrieking Shack, I figured you'd want to know. I know they wouldn't leave you but..." He hummed and stuffed his hands in his hoodie pocket. Harry nodded slowly and finally looked up to Draco, his blush having faded a bit. "Right. Thank you. Are you joining us?" He asked and crossed his arms over his chest. Draco shrugged and looked around the hallway, his expression bored. "I might as well, I've got nothing better to do." He muttered and stepped back so Harry could walk out of the bathroom. He took a deep breath and nodded once more before walking out of the bathroom and down the stairs. Draco followed him and looked at everyone who had stood up and put on their coats. They looked far more worse for wears than Draco did, meaning they must've had more to drink; Draco probably didn't have anything to hide. Harry cleared his throat and walked up to the group with a smile, gaining smiles in return.
"Merlin's beard, I bloody love the prat!" He yelled, looking directly at her when he finally said it. The weight off his shoulders lessened as he looked over his expression, making sure she wasn't going to do something stupid. The smile that grew on her lips surprised Draco, but he soon felt comforted by the grin as she walked around and sat down beside him again, her head going to lean on his shoulder. "Now was that so hard?" She asked and kicked the snow away from her feet, hearing another heavy sigh leave his lips. "Yeah, it was."

Thanks for reading!!! ♥♥♥
Draco huffed out a hot breath, his eyes averting towards the ground as he kicked an invisible pebble from the crevice of two stones coming together. "I was just staring into empty space where Potter
Pansy stayed quiet for a while but soon rested her head on his shoulder, rubbing his arm as she kept her eyes on the lake. "Maybe you should have." She stated simply and felt Draco tense a bit at her sentence. She sighed and brushed some strands of hair that had fallen in front of her eye. "Draco, you're trying too hard to not do anything that you think would hurt him, but maybe you're hurting him more by pushing yourself away? What if he likes you too? You'll never know until you make a move, and I doubt Harry would make a move on his own." She explained, Feeling Draco press his cheek on the top of Pansy's head, showing he was listening at least. She felt him nod slowly and then heard him let out a sigh. "If I open myself up to him I'm going to hurt him far worse than what I'm already doing that." He muttered and felt Pansy pull herself away from his side, a deep frown on her lips. "You don't know that Draco! What if he can help with your Nightmares? What if he can help you in more ways than you think?!" She yelled, her harsh tone making Draco flinch a little. He looked at her, his expression unreadable but his eyes clear as day shattering. "I don't bloody need his help Pansy!! I just..." Draco scrunched his nose in anger and turned his head away from her gaze, his eyes landing on a wilting flower peeking from the snow.
Harry gave them both a small smile and a nod, watching them reluctantly walk away with a few glanced before they disappeared into the castle again. Harry sat down beside Draco, his thigh brushing against Draco's forearm which made him flinch back a little. "Since when were we on a first-name basis?" He asked and stuffed his hands in his robe pockets to busy himself with the now non-existent lint there. Harry turned his head after placing his bag beside his feet and showed off a friendly grin. "Well, I told you I wanted to start fresh, and that means a first-name basis!" He answered and crossed his legs tightly, resting his reddened hands on his knee. Draco nodded slowly and thinned his lips, his eyes flicking between those sea-green eyes and pale pink lips. How much he wanted to pull the Gryffindor in by his tie and press their lips together harshly, lead him down to lay on the fountain, and pull them together so they could warm each other up with a nice make-out session. "-are you?" Harry asked, rubbing his hands together almost anxiously as he awaited an answer. His eyes were glued on Draco's face as the blond blinked a few times to throw himself back into their conversation. "What?" He questioned, his tone confused and his face contorted into a seemingly dumb confusion. Harry sighed and looked down at his hands that were melted together, a bright blush flowing up his neck and onto his cheeks and ears. "I asked if you were wanting to sleep in the Shrieking Shack with all of us tonight after the game. We planned it at lunch and we all just wanted to stargaze tonight and maybe do some stupid stuff, I don't know." He repeated himself and bit his lip quickly after sucking it in. Draco wanted to reach over and pull his lip out from his teeth with his thumb, rubbing it gently before pulling him in so he could gently kiss his neck, just below where a small amount of stubble was growing from a few days without shaving. He swallowed hard and looked over Harry's burning face, resisting the urge to reach over and cup his hot cheek.
to be, not my problem the bloke is everywhere!" He blurted out, his voice raising an octave or two as his arms slightly go up into the air. Draco bit the inside of his lip as he settled his arms back to his side and slouched even further into the tree. Pansy only snickers slightly and shrugged her boney shoulders, "I was only teasing. I have news," She hummed, leaning down to Draco's ear so wandering students couldn't hear the thing she was going to tell him. "Potter and his friends are going to Hogsmeade tonight, and I was graciously invited by their friend Luna. She said I could bring a guest if I felt uncomfortable. Oh Draco, you would leave me alone with the rays of sunshine would you?" she questioned, faked worry laced her tone.
The class ran by fairly quickly after Draco and Blaise finished their potion, which meant it was now lunchtime. Pansy had waited for Draco and Blaise outside of the Potions classroom, having had a free period. She smiled and hooked her arm with Draco, making him let out a sigh as they walked into the Great Hall. They all got only a few glanced before they settled down at the Slytherin table. "So, how was the test? I have potions after thing." Pansy asked, her arm detaching from Draco's as she went in for a sandwich. Draco shrugged and cupped his cheek in his hand as he leaned on the table. "It was fine, Pansy. You studied so you'll be fine. This prat didn't study at all so I had to do everything." Blaise said, whacking the back of Draco's head in which Draco decided to ignore instead of arguing with Blaise. When Harry and Hermione walked into the Great Hall with Ron trying to catch up behind him, Draco perked up a little bit, not so slouched over the table anymore. Pansy sighed and frowned, trying to act hurt, "Not even going to perk up to his friends like he perks up to Potter, how rude." She sighed and looked down at the sandwich she had in hand. "Put a can in it, Parkinson." He retorted and watched Harry sit down at the Gryffindor table, hearing a small snicker from beside him.
Draco was speechless, he had absolutely nothing to say and that might've been a good thing. He kept opening and closing his mouth almost wanting to say something but decided against it. He turned his head, his eyes finding the wall as he pursed his lips slightly. "You're making this hard.." he muttered out before he turned quickly on his heels quickly and made his way down the spiral staircase. Draco made his way through the crowded pub to their table and leaned down to tell Pansy he was wanting to leave. Pansy thinned her lips into a frown and said her goodbye's, placing a few silver Sickles down to pay for both Dracos and her drinks before she tossed on her thick winter coat and walked out the door. Draco followed, not bothering to look back because he could feel the glare Harry was shooting him from the staircase.
Draco huffed and snatched Blaise's book, pushing himself off the table. He ignored the protests of Blaise behind him as he walked out of the Great Hall. Potions was his 5th-hour class, which meant he had enough time to study the correct formula and ingredients for the liquid luck potion. He stormed into the library, finding a nice quiet place in one of the corners, and dropped the borrowed (or more stolen) book down on the table. He flipped open the pages, some fluttering loose from his fingers as he turned to the page of liquid luck. He placed his elbows on the table and pressed his knuckles into each cheek, looking down at the opened book. His eyes followed each word carefully, taking mental notes of the ingredients and measurements of said ingredients. He ignored the chatter from other students that had found their way to the library for some reason, his entire focus was on the book in front of him. That was until someone sat in front of him, and without raising his eyes he sighed "Parkinson, I am not in the mood to talk, I need to study this before Potions or that slug will grow concerned with my marks." He muttered, his eyes flicking from words to pictures as he turned the page. He heard a small snicker come from in front of him, and it didn't sound like Pansy. He whipped his head up, tearing his focus away from the pages to look into forest green eyes. He felt his mouth dry as Harry looked over his expression, his eye trailing down his chest and to the book on the table. "Early study session?" He asked, tilting his head to the side as he spoke.
Harry smiled and nodded, twisting his satchel around to show the neatly curled up robe around the band that connected to the bag. He pulled it away and handed it over to Draco, their fingers brushing close as Draco took it from his calloused hands. He quickly slipped his arms into the sleeves and pulled it close together, finally feeling somewhat warm. "If I knew you'd be cold I would've brought it to you sooner. What class did you just have?" Harry asked, putting his arms behind his back and clasping his hands together. "Herbology, I'm so cold cause I was outside." He sighed and rubbed the back of his slightly untamed hair. Harry nodded and looked over his rosy cheeks and nose. "Well, You should've just come back to the library when you noticed it was gone, you git." He said in a playful tone, his smile yet again making small wrinkles form in the corner of each eye. Draco's fingers twitched a little bit as he thought about reaching his hand out and rubbing his thumb over Harry's cheek, but he stuffed his hands in his robe pockets to busy himself with the lint inside.
Pansy stared at him confused for a moment before softening her gaze and giving him a small, comforting nod. "Of course, but can you tell me why? Come on, Draco, I'm practically your best friend." She mumbled and placed her hand on his shoulder gently, feeling him flinch ever so slightly. She kept her hand steady on his shoulder, letting him decide if he liked it or didn't, and when her hand wasn't pushed away she rubbed her thumb gently over his clothed skin. "Not here, too many ears." He mumbled and stood up, watching her arm fall to her lap as she took in what he said. She nodded and grabbed a few pieces of toast while she stood up, using her free hand to brush down the back of her skit before standing to the side of Draco. "Lead the way." She muttered and put the corner of the perfectly crispy bread in her mouth. Draco made his way out of the Great Hall, cautiously stepping through the main corridor to make sure he didn't run into anyone returning from the Shrieking Shack. When they were out of the castle and away from the courtyard, he let his shoulders fall, and hands rest in his pant pockets as they approached the Black Lake. Pansy shivered a bit at the temperature and looked around as they walked. "You always did like outside..." She mumbled and looked at the white hair ruffling in the chilled wind.
"You like him?" She asked, almost to completely understand what Harry was saying. He only nodded and looked at the calm flames in the fireplace. "And he kissed you? What did you do?" she questioned, rubbing her knees a little to try and stop her hands from becoming clammy from the heat of the flames. "I just stood there. I didn't know what to do. But I didn't hate it... I liked it actually... But he just ran off before I could say anything." He explained and looked over Hermione's expression after turning his head to face her. She hummed and brought her hand up to play with her curls. "Okay, so that just means we need to make up a plan. Tomorrow is Sunday, so it's going to be easy for him to avoid you. Monday he has to go to classes, so try to talk to him in any classes you have. Maybe invite him to Hogsmeade without us? Just you two drinking? If he accepts great! If he doesn't... Well then I can try to get him to the library to 'study with me' and you can come in and talk to him there!" She explained, clasping her hands together with a bright smile and something mischievous in her eyes. Harry nodded, trying to pile all the information she said in his messy brain. "Okay, so try to ask him out on- Hermione you want me to ask him out on a date?!" he asked, his voice raising an octave or two and his cheeks heating up with a pink hue. Hermione's smile stayed on her lips as she nodded and rubbed Harry's shoulder gently. "Yes! Exactly a date! And if that doesn't work then we can do the plan B! which is the library one." She confirmed and looked around the common room, yet again making sure they were alone.
Hearing the chimes of the clock, he looked up at the students filling the courtyard, girls giggling together in their groups, and boys shoving each other around in a playful manner. Draco chewed on the dead skin that had peeled itself from his bottom lip and tapped the heel of his shoe on the white stone on the fountain. He thinned his lips and rubbed his hands on his pants, debating whether to go to the common room or stay out here for his free period. "Draco!" A familiar voice yelled over the commotion, catching his attention quicker than he would like the admit. He looked up from his shoes and settled his gaze on Harry who was walking at a fast pace directly towards him. Draco would be embarrassed to admit the bubbles stirring in his gut at the mention of his first name from Harry. It rolled perfectly off his tongue, almost like he was made specifically to call out his first name. Hermione and Ron were following their friend, confusion spread over their faces as they whispered in each other's ear. Harry stopped right beside Draco, his lips curved into a smile, "I didn't see you come back, I assume you've been out here all lunch?" He asked, shuffling on his feet a little as his friends poked his back to ask a question. Draco stared at the brunette for a while before breaking their eye contact to look at Ron and Hermione. "Yes." He replied, gripping the stone beneath him tightly. Harry nodded and looked behind him at the two lingering by his heels like lost dogs, "You guys can go, I'll catch up." He hummed and waved his hand in the air a little to shoo them off. Hermione gave Draco a small glance, then looked a Ron, then back to Harry before she nodded slowly. "Okay, don't forget to meet us in the library when you're done." She mumbled and clutched the books she had her arms wrapped around.
"Say it. Draco, say the words out loud." She ordered, his arms crossing just below her chest, her eyebrows pulling together in a tight frown as she waited for Draco to speak up. "I-" He started but closed his mouth making Pansy stand up and walk around to where his head was facing, crouching down and placing her hands on his knees. She looked at him expectantly, her expression no longer angry, it was calm and comforting, waiting patiently for Draco to say it.
The very moment Harry left the bathroom is when Draco stumbled back onto the sinks. His hands sliding on the cold porcelain, his head dropping down to his sternum as he took a sharp breath. There were way too many thoughts flying through the blond's head; Did Harry actually invite him? How did he not pussy out and yell at him? Was this some sick, twisted dream he would wake up from in mere seconds? He blinked hard a few times before pushing himself off the sink and made his way slowly out of the bathroom. He pulled his robe sleeves down slightly, his eyes glued to the ground as he steadied his walking pace. Going back to the Great Hall wouldn't be the best option for him at that moment; he'd just stare at Harry the entire time and not do anything productive like eating for once. He rubbed his clammy hands together and decided a nice breath of fresh air would do him wonders. He walked down the main corridor of the castle and out the doors to a rather large courtyard with a fountain in the middle. He glanced up and the greyish clouds covering the sun which made little flickers of light shine through them. He let out a heavy sigh, his hot breath making a cloud form around his mouth and dissipate through the air quickly. He sat on the white bricks of the fountain, the water splashing small droplets on the back of his robe and slowly soak into the thin black material.
Pansy merely settled back to her original position leaned against the tree. "I'm not insane, I'm trying to get you something more than just stares from the other end of the Great Hall or following him in the halls to try and get a good look at that devilishly good looking smile he wears on those pretty pink, plump, lips." She said, her voice lowering into a teasing tone as he described Harry's lips and smile. She looked down at Draco's adam's apple bobbing slightly as he swallowed his saliva hard. She let out a satisfied hum from the small reaction she could muster from the blond and crossed her arms just below her chest, her eyes sliding closed quickly. "If you come, they'll all be drinking, which means you can look at him longingly and just blame it on the alcohol effects." She added, making a pretty valid point.
Draco went- scratch that- if Draco even
Harry looked at the Slytherin scarf and let his lips pull into a smile, "What would I do with a Slytherin scarf? You know people would think I got it from my girlfriend?" he chuckled and wrapped the soft scarf around his neck, gripping it a bit before letting his hands fall back to his knee. Draco snorted and raised his eyebrows while keeping his eyes closed, "You? Date a Slytherin? That would be the day..." Draco replied in a cocky tone. Harry relaxed a bit at the more laid back comment from the blond and leaned back into the leather seat. The room soon fell silent, the only things the boys could hear was their own heartbeats and the breathing from the other, and it was comfortable. Usually, when they were in each other's presence, the room and air were heavy and awkward, but right now it was peaceful with not awkwardness lingering in the warm air. "Hey, can I ask you something? It's kinda personal." Harry asked, finally breaking the silence. Draco let out a hum as if saying 'sure' and Harry rubbing his hands together and bit at the dead skin on his lip. "Well... You're a decent looking guy..." Harry spoke, soon realizing the starter of his sentence may have not been the best choice cause Draco was now staring at the brunette with wide eyes.
"Why are you so bloody thick-headed?! I try to be nice to you, I try to start over, and you push me away with more force than the first time! What are you so afraid of?! What possibly could go wrong with starting over you twat?!" He yelled, pulling Draco forward a bit so Harry's forearm lay on Draco's chest. "Bloody Christ I just don't like you!! Why can't you understand that?!!" He retorted, his own expression contorting to irritation as he felt himself being pulled even closer. Their lips were so close, the only thing guarding them is their noses which were almost pressed firmly together. Having never seen this much rage in Harry's eyes, Draco lost his train of thought. "How do you not like me?! You were so nice this afternoon?! or this morning?! Please explain because I'm not buying it!" He groaned, his grip firm on the collar of Draco's hoodie. Draco stayed silent for a while but soon shoved Harry off his body, his breath heavy and rapid as Harry stumbled on his feet. "Stay the bloody hell away from me." He finally said and turned to walk away but Harry wasn't having. He walked quickly to the front of Draco and put his arms out, his face determined to get some answers. "Not until you tell me what you're afraid of." He said and moved anytime Draco would move. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his hands curling into a fist as he tried to compose himself. "Get away from me." He warned, his eyes sliding open to a slightly darker grey filled with something Harry couldn't put his finger on. "No." He retorted and flinched when it seemed Draco was going in for a swing, his eyes sliding shut to brace himself for the impact.
Having noticed the eyes drilling holes into his skin, Draco turned to face Harry with a small smirk on his lips. "What? Do you like what you see, Potter?" He joked and watch the blood rush to Harrys' cheeks. He soon looked away although reluctantly and busied himself with unbuttoning his shirt as well. This felt like they were doing something more erotic than just getting changed for some reason, and Harry couldn't figure out if he liked it or hated it. After Harry looked away, Draco slid into his hoodie and pulled his belt from the loops. He placed it on his bed and glanced over at Harry who had finally shrugged the shirt off his shoulders. Draco had only imagined what Harry's body looked liked under his clothes, and it was now Draco's turn to stare at him. His eyes trailed over his slightly muscular stomach, his skin wasn't pale, it was more a beautiful golden brown like he had just worked on his tan. Draco's eyes trailed down the small amount of hair that went down to his navel, his fingers twitching a little bit in anticipation that would never come. He averted his gaze when Harry slid into his hoodie and tapped his foot on the floor. Draco pushed the soaked pants down and pulled the other ones on quickly, looping the belt back around his waist and sinching it tight.
Harry looked away quickly, his cheeks heating up to show off a nice pink tint as he whispered to Ron. He must've said something about him because Ron gave Draco a sideways glance before returning his attention to their potion. Draco did the same, not wanting another hit from Zabini. Blaise quickly added the other ingredients and put his and Draco's book under the table when Slughorn announce it's been ten minutes. "Shit, what next?" He asked, looking over to Blaise with concern. Blaise only chuckled and cranked the heat up with a shake of his head. "Unlike you, I studied." He hummed and took the glass stick from Draco's fingers. Draco watched him stir clockwise this time, the liquid turning from a light grey color to a molten gold color; some droplets leaping like goldfish above the potion's surface. Draco hummed as if saying 'You actually did study', and watched Blaise stir for a bit longer before he turned down the heat. "I didn't expect you to, so I had to do it," He snickered and took out the glass stick, wiping it off with the cloth that was set there for them. He then took a small glass container, popping the cork out of it. He handed it to Draco, looking at him and then the potion. "Hold that super steady, we need to get five bottles out of it in order to get a passing grade," Blaise said, picking up the cauldron gently and making sure not to spill it. He slowly poured the first container full, making sure Draco put the cork in tight before he handed him the next container. Draco placed the cork on the table and held the glass steady, watching Blaise pour the molten gold liquid into it.
"Doesn't matter, he was an absolute prick to us from the first year to now! He hasn't changed one bit! Sure he's more concealed and doesn't talk to many people or make stupid comments in class, but anytime he opens his mouth it's disrespectful and nothing else!" He barked back, his lips in a seemingly permanent frown as Harry started to just ignore his friends. "Ron has a point, Harry. Maybe he's nice to you or something but he's still pretty snappy towards up..." Hermione said and looked over at Harry, his face being lit by the fire roaring in the fireplace. "Do you blame him though? Anytime he opens his mouth you guys take it as rude?! He was joking you know! Even I could tell!" He yelled, standing up so fast the sofa scooted back a little bit. Ron fell silent at that, looking down at the floor. "I can't stand you two right now." He grunted and grabbed the Slytherin scarf that hung on the back of the sofa. Hermione looked at it with wide eyes as Harry walked out of the common room, his cloud of emotions, mostly anger, following him out of the room. It soon fell silent, the only noise being the cracking of the fire beside Ron and Hermione, and Ron soon stood up and walked up the stairs to his dorm room.
Harry took in a sharp breath as they walked, getting closer to the store with each wide stride. "Well, you might want to try a few in here. They have some pretty mild sweet things too." He added, pointing a finger up to the sky as he spoke. Draco shrugged his shoulder and walked into the store, stopping slightly so he could hold the door for Harry. Harry's eyes sparkled with something Draco had never seen before as he grabbed the door just above Draco's hand. Draco slipped his hand from the door as he watched Harry slide past him in the thin doorframe. "Thanks," He hummed and close the door behind himself. Draco nodded and parted ways with Harry to look for Pansy. Pansy was looking at the chocolate frogs with a glint in her eye before she looked up to meet Draco's gaze. She smirked wide and slid her hand on Dracos bicep, patting it a few times to try and get the blond to speak up. "So, spill! What did you two talk about? Or did you bite your tongue and walk away from him like always?" She whispered, her tone laced with excitement.
Pansy merely gave Draco a sideways glance and sighed, her dainty fingers going up to her hair to curl around the small strands she could manage to grab at the moment, "You
(See the end of the chapter for
AHHHHHHHHHHHH This chapter was so freaking CUTE!!!!! I hope you all enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!!!
Harry rushed into the bathroom and gripped the cold sink, turning it on quickly to create noise. His breathing was heavy and his heart was pounding against his ribcage. He gripped the hoodie Draco had given him and let his chin rest against his collarbones. The thought of Draco doing whatever he pleased with Harry in bed made blood shoot straight down to his groin and his jeans tighten. He swallowed hard and shook his head, closing his eyes tightly to try and get the images out of his head but in reality, they only made it worse.  Harry wasn't gay, at least he thinks he isn't, he had fantasized about girls before and woke up with the worst morning wood he had ever experienced, but this was something different. The thought of Dracos rough and strong calloused hands running down his sides as he kissed and sucked at his neck, his silverish eyes dark with lust as he looked straight into Harry's eyes with nothing more than love, his hips jerking forward as he set a steady pace of thrusts into Harry. His body started to heat up as he slid down the wall he had found himself against. He licked his dry lips and fumbled with his pant button, wanting to get some relief before going back to the group. He slowly wrapped his hand around his burning dick and let out a hiss at the dry friction of the first rub. He flicked his thumb over the bead of pre-cum that was pooling at the tip and rubbed it down the shaft.
Harry slouched into the comfortable chair and sighed, shaking his head rather quickly "Who wants to pace themselves, I want to be wasted when I go back to Hogwarts." He whined, crossing his arms tight over his chest. Draco glanced over at Hermione, who wore an annoyed expression as she retorted back with a snarky remark. Draco then looked down slightly at Harry, who was shivering quite noticeably. Draco furrowed his brows and looked at the table, fidgeting with his thumbs as the others bickered around them. Draco did not expect to be squeezed up to Harry tonight, he expected to get a few drinks and head back to the castle annoyed that he didn't speak up to Harry.
He felt his cheeks heat up, making him turn his head to the side to look at anything but Draco. He let out a small chuckle and shrugged his shoulders lazily. "I see. You know, you could've given me a shake, you're probably freezing." He mentioned and looked over the naked trees that surrounded them. "Not really." He hummed and looked down at the broken step below their feet. Harry stood up, wobbling a bit from the sudden movement, and looked down at Draco with a smile on his chapped lips. "We should go back inside, the others might think we're up to something," Harry suggested with a rub of his arm, shuffling on his feet with embarrassment from blushing so much. Draco stood up and stretched out his back, hearing it pop a few times before turning on his heels to walk inside. Harry followed, making sure to stay far enough away so he didn't step on Draco's shoes. They walked into the room everyone was in, surprisingly still filled with snore, and sat down on the sleeping bags they had claimed for themselves. Harry looked around at all his friends and scratched the back of his head, deciding if he wanted to wake them or let them sleep off their hangover. Luckily, today was Saturday, and no one had to get up early like usual.
After about fifteen minutes of the agonizing sweet smell, they all left the sweets shop decided a trip to The Hog's Head's would be a good third stop. Draco, now heavily feeling the effects of the two cups of Fire Whiskey and three shots of Vodka, stumbled slightly on his feet at a slightly uneven brick on the road. Pansy gripped his back and pulled him along with a huff, clearly being annoyed at how much of a lightweight Draco was. "Geez Draco, who knew an ex death-eater would be such a lightweight." She joked as she dragged the blond along and into the pub. Draco whacked the back of her head and pushed himself away from her grip, "Bugger off." He groaned, sitting down at the table they all decided would work for the size of their group. Pansy smiled as she went to sit down, noticing Harry was also about to sit down. She smirked and back up, extending her arm to show Harry towards the seat beside Draco. "You can sit down," She hummed and watched him sit himself down beside Draco muttering something along the lines of 'Thank you'. She waited for the other to sit before she took her seat on the outside of everyone. Draco straightened himself up, stiffening at the touch of their elbows on the table. "I think some butterbeer would be good right now, we need to pace ourselves." Hermione chirped, giving a soft nod when everyone agreed to it except Ron and Harry.
Draco cleared his throat and bent down to get on face level with Pansy, "Well... it was kind of just small talk. Said I should try some of the sweets here.." He filled in, the edges of his lips struggling to keep a frown. "Draco, don't buy the whole bloody store now. Maybe get him his favorite candy, you know that right?" She asked, looking around the store to look at each head. Draco thought for a moment before he shook his head quickly. "No bloody clue..." He muttered and rubbed the back of his neck. Pansy looked at him in surprise and pulled him closer to let out a hushed yell. "You don't even know his favorite candy?! Christ, Draco you're a lost cause." She pinched the bridge of her nose and shook her head, squeezing her eye shut as she thought. "Maybe just get some lemon drops, everyone loves those." She suggested and let go of his bicep as her eyes fluttered open. She pointed a sharp finger over to the lemon drops and gave him a glare before browsing the rest of the store.
This was the usual routine, Blaise and Pansy would talk, sometimes Goyle or Theo jumping in if they felt like it, and Draco would be staring into 'empty space where Harry happened to be'. Pansy and Blaise had grown accustomed to it, not really minding the utter obsession Draco had for Potter. Draco sighed and pushed himself off the table, looking down at the two, now confused, friends of his. "Bathroom." He muttered and walked out of the Great Hall, feeling the eyes of each professor on his back. Draco made his way to the bathroom and leaned on the sinks, dropping his head down and closing his eyes. He stood there in silence for a while until he heard footsteps outside the bathroom which made him open his eyes and straighten himself out before he turned around. Harry was stood at the entrance to the bathroom, and Draco tensed quickly, this was a rather familiar scene. Draco cautiously took a step forward and put his hands out a little, "You're not going to use sectumsempra on me right?" He asked, flinching at the name a little. Harry had also flinched a little, but he slowly shook his head. "Of course not, I will never use that spell again, I promise." He said and stepped into the bathroom. Draco let out a heavy breath and nodded, crossing his arms over his chest. "Why are you here?" He asked, rubbing the dark mark through his clothes. "Well, I wanted to know if you wanted to come to Hogsmeade with us tonight, We're planning on playing truth or drink at the Three Broomsticks, It's a pretty fun game." He chuckled and rubbed his neck awkwardly. This was a scene to behold, Harry inviting Draco out for a night out was definitely something Draco did not expect. Draco blinked a few times, letting the invitation sink in a little.
-----
When Potions class came around, Draco sulked into the classroom and sat in his seat beside Blaise. Blaise smirked and wrapped his arm around Draco and pulled him close, glancing around at the other students before he turned to whisper in Draco's ear. "Did you hear?" Blaise asked, watching Draco's scrunch up from the closeness of the two. Draco shook his head, cautious of what Blaise was going to say with other students around. "Wow, you really are clueless. After you left Hogsmeade last night, Cho and Harry went at it in the Three Broomsticks washroom." He informed, feeling Draco tense up considerably. Draco turned to face Blaise, his eyebrows pulled together and the frown on his lips deep. "What?" He asked, making sure he heard it right. When Harry walked into the room with Ron, Draco straightened his back and watched them walk to their assigned table. "Yeah, I heard Cho was so loud you could hear her over the music." He added and removed his arm from Draco's shoulder. Draco's face went pale as he looked over at Harry, trying to see if he could see it in his face. He didn't look different, his usual bright smile and eyes, and his always untamed hair. He looked normal, and Draco didn't know if Blaise was telling the truth or just trying to rial him up before the test. "Sod off, Zabini." He spat and looked at the pot in front of him. Blaise only nodded with a small chuckled and pulled out his potions book just as Professor Slughorn walked into the room.
Draco only sighed again, letting his chin hit his collarbones as he lowered his head. He knitted his eyebrows, picking at a small thread on the cuff of his coat, a small and quiet hum coming from his throat as he listened to her. That was entirely false, Draco really wanted to talk to him, but for some reason, he couldn't bring himself to do it. Maybe it was because Draco was too bloody self-centered (in Pansy's eyes), or maybe it was because he was truthfully too nervous to actually talk to him normally due to their history. He rubbed the back of his whitish blond hair and let out another sigh, his eyes pulling up to look at Pansy who was staring out in the street at the falling snow. Of course, it was snowing tonight, it was almost always snowing during winter here. Draco detested the cold, how it wrapped around your body so quickly anytime you stepped out of the door, how quickly it would send you into fits of shivers while walking around. Yet again, he wasn't too fond of the warmth either, he didn't like the clamminess of his or other people's hands, and he didn't like having to take off layers because he was too bloody hot.
going, he would definitely blame any weird things he would do or say on the immense amount of alcohol he would consume.
Harry tried to squeeze the water out of Dracos robe before dropping his arms and head with a sigh. Draco stood up and pulled his drenched robe off to give it a squeeze to try and get as much water out of it before he walked into the castle. He looked down at Harry and flicked his forehead, making the brunette flinch a bit and look up at Draco. "You're wet too. Come on," he ordered, pausing a bit when he shivered. He slowly started walking back to the castle doors, looking back to make sure Harry was following. Harry stood up quickly and wrapped his arms around himself before following Draco closely, not wanting to lose him. "I'm sorry..." Harry muttered out and looked down at his feet as he walked. Draco sighed and clutched his hand into a fist, "Stop saying you're sorry. It's fine." He grunted and walked down the stairs to the dungeon. Harry looked up as they started walking down the stair, finally getting a hint to where they were going. He gulped and tried searching for any other Slytherins that could be around. "Draco, Are we going to the Slytherin common room?" he asked just above a whisper to make sure others couldn't hear his voice. Draco crossed his arms to try and conserve his body heat before looking back at Harry with an unreadable expression, but Harry could tell he was pissed. "Yes. Don't worry, everyone is in class most likely, I don't think anyone has a free period but me cause they are too proud of their bloody studies." He replied and stood in front of the stone door that had a snake wrapped around it. It reminded Harry of the entrance to the chamber of secrets, but less creepy and more welcoming. Draco whipped his head back around and shot Harry a small glare, "Cover your ears. I don't need you sneaking into our common room every bloody second of the day." he ordered and made sure Harry had his ears firmly covered before he whispered the code. The snake shot back into a small hole and the door popped open. Draco held his hand out to tell Harry to stay put so he could search the common room before the Gryffindor walked in.
