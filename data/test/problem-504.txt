But, as it turns out, running into Draco being accosted by boisterous Australian lads with a fetish for British accents levels the playing field. It’s difficult to be suspicious of your childhood arch enemy when you’ve just rescued them from something you don’t quite—and don’t want to—understand, and Harry supposes it’s difficult to plot dastardly things when your mouth still tastes like a stranger’s tinea.
“Well, yeah, now you mention it,” Potter shot back, dodging the piles of dung with offensive ease. “Because then you would’ve been a danger to the rest of our mission, and probably wrecked it, and then Voldemort would still be around and we’d all be dead.”
It was hotter than his teenage dream. The dream had been fueled by anger and a mutual yearning to prove the other wrong, to fight, to win. This was nothing like that. When Draco fell to his knees it was to bring them both pleasure, years-long feuds forgotten in the face of the other’s offered vulnerability. Draco could get drunk off that sensation.
That’s what he and Malfoy were for. Harry had to stop the curse; Malfoy had to cure it. But they were only given two days interaction with the artefacts suspected of causing it, and they couldn't go home until fourteen days of quarantine at a Ministry facility. Harry had received special permission to quarantine back at home… but that was a whole other thing.
There was a brief struggle, like Potter was trying to find some reason to refuse the gift, on the grounds that he only deserved to sleep on nails or some other such rot, and then he felt him give in and just let Draco hold him.
Draco froze as he watched Potter take in his surroundings. How much could Draco trust this dream? Was it accurate? Because Potter was staring at the cottage the same way Draco might imagine an eternal wanderer stared through a foggy window to a warm hearth and a feast within. Longingly. Desperately. And with the absolute conviction that they were unwelcome.
The noise of the party swelled, the distant laughter washing over them and making the silence of their little corner stand out with stark contrast. The smell of hot pastries being offered as entrées on floating trays overwhelmed Draco, making his stomach turn. This wasn’t how it was meant to go.
Draco nodded, forcing himself to listen to the words instead of drifting away where he didn’t have to acknowledge them.
“I don’t know, Harry. That sounds really fun,” Hermione said when Harry had told the table at large over dinner about his suffering.
Harry’s stomach gave a pleasant little flip that had nothing to do with how good his lower half felt, and everything to do with the feel of Malfoy’s cheek pressed against his bicep. He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to regain control, and before he had managed to open them again he felt a light touch circling his hip, questioning.
It was as if he had crossed into another dimension. The inside of the shop was caught in some kind of time spell, full of gently floating debris that drifted ever so slowly upwards, like it was still in the process of exploding at a very, very slow pace. Through the haze of smoke that curled out of the workroom door, Draco caught sight of George Weasley, suspended in mid-air and surrounded by gently floating pieces of scorched paper and cardboard.
For a moment, the dream changed, shattered glass floating between the harsh screams of his aunt’s hatred.
“Nope. Found it out the back of Flourish and Blotts. Mildred hadn’t put it out for sale because she thought it was too terrible to sell.”
“I don’t know,” he said, voice full of regret. “I’ll have to turn it over to Robards and find some other way to make a difference. I can’t stay there.”
The gate of the Sanctuary creaked open in his dream, and he saw Potter tiptoe onto his property. Something looming and ancient surged within the cottage where Draco of the past slept, because this was clearly a memory—just not his own this time. Even though Potter of the present was nowhere to be seen or felt, and had not been since the Manor appeared.
Evie shot him a grateful smile. “Maybe. We’re just glad something like this exists. At least if the worst happens, she can still go for a fly with her sister.”
Then, the memories began to filter in: the horcrux; Potter becoming an Unspeakable; Potter spinning him around and around while the two of them laughed in delight before pulling him closer, his eyes dark with heat.
Transfiguring the book into a fish, Harry throws it into the ocean. With any luck, a shark will eat it.
Shaking himself out of the strangeness of it all, he turned to Neville and smiled somewhat desperately.
“I think it makes all the difference,” Harry said awkwardly. “Because now we know it was our choices that made it, not fate, which means our choices can make it again.”
Draco turned to him, an insult on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn’t grasp a hold of it. The room was blurring, Potter’s face distorting before his eyes into a thousand colours and shapes that didn’t seem like they could possibly fit together and yet managed to all the same. All at once, Draco realised his error, but before he could work out how to operate his mouth to warn Potter, he fell forward, his forehead brushing against the red chalk of the circle, and passed out.
Draco closed his eyes against the painful scene and only opened them again once they were saying good bye.
“Bring George out of the—” Draco repeated weakly, before he shook his head and just decided to go with it.
that he could reverse engineer. It was like a whole new branch of curse magic. Some elements matched a branch here or there—most closely the hellfire curse, as he’d originally thought it was, from the mercurial branch—but then it would throw something in that was solely psychical, or only tacit, and he’d be right back where he started.
To his surprise, Potter laughed. It was a cold sound, made worse for the slight note of drunken amusement that wouldn’t seem to fade away. All of a sudden, he realised how close Potter was. He turned to face him and took an involuntary step backwards at the triumph on Potter’s face.
Draco laughed and dropped his head back against the lockers. “Shut up, Potter,” he grunted, thrusting forward when Harry closed around him again. “I dreamed we took the argument into the change rooms, and then the showers, and then you were on your knees and I was fucking your mouth. Oddly prophetic, now that I think about it.”
Weasley snorted. “Wouldn’t dream of it. My tongue would probably drop off if I tried to speak fluent ponce. Don’t touch the squid display.” He pointed to something bright red in the corner that jiggled ominously. “It bites.”
“Yeah, okay,” Harry says, stepping into the inviting circle of Draco’s arms. “I can probably think of a few things.”
He paused and then seemed to slump forward. “Okay, fine, I’m not dealing with this too well, all right? And when you had a go at me for drinking on the job I ended up going to the Ministry and researching all night.” He gave a wry grin. “It was that, or drink another bottle of whiskey.”
Draco only got angry when things were personal, which meant that Pansy wouldn’t have a reason to think that he was trying to fool her. After all, this wasn’t meant to be personal, was it? It was just a stupid little bet. Which left the question—why was he so angry?
“Thank Merlin,” he groaned, dropping back against the pillows as his fingers confirmed dry bedsheets.
His eyes snapped open as his thoughts clicked into place. The explosion that had caught Ron was only designed to draw attention, and the inhibitor had already been dispensed. While there could certainly be more inhibitors, it was nothing that a shield charm couldn’t protect them from, which meant that every aspect of the curse that they had so far identified was no longer a threat.
He turned swiftly away, lest Potter think he wasn’t still furious with him, and walked into the kitchen in search of coffee and potions.
Draco looked up at him. “That’s usually how it goes,” he admitted. “The fall is so gradual it’s impossible to notice until after.”
Neville snorted, covering his mouth and trying to pretend he hadn’t. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “Sh’kinda funny. Lil’.. lil’ bit.”
Draco froze and tried to look like he very obviously wasn’t listening, which he very obviously was. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter emerge from the back room and come to stand in front of him on the other side of the counter. He pasted a politely curious expression on his face and looked up. It nearly fell off his face in dismay when he realised that Potter—the
Hermione rolled her eyes—a gesture Harry very rarely saw her make. “Yes. Yes, I remember. And when he found out about Dean and Seamus he was
Draco gaped at him. Where was the fire? The bite? Gryffindor had just thrashed Slytherin two hundred and fifty to forty; why wasn’t Potter laughing at him? Surely that was why he was here—as some sort of dominance tactic against the Slytherins. Against
“Kalen, just open the box. You’re not in trouble.” Potter flicked his wand and the ropes disappeared.
Potter shook his head. “I mean hurry it up. It’s going through fledgling state again, right? And when it finishes and it’s worked out what it’s doing, the curse activates properly. Let’s hurry it up. Give ourselves something to actually fight.”
After several minutes, Potter set down his empty cup and sighed. “Veela use peacock feathers to line their nests.”
“It is impossible,” Draco said, twisting the cuff of his shirt between restless fingers, “to occupy an estate for centuries upon centuries and not imprint yourself upon it. Voldemort knew this, although he may not have understood it all. He knew, nonetheless, how to target it. His Death Eaters destroyed homes and sacred land belonging to those he deemed blood traitors, damaging the magic of both its human and animal custodians for… Merlin, decades, probably.”
“We’ll take him in now, Auror Potter.” One of the mediwizards looked up while the other transfigured a stretcher out of one of the pieces of foam in their pack. “Looks like a bad Stun at this point. There’s no indication of head trauma or other damage from what we can tell.”
Draco drew his wand from its holster and muttered an incantation, one of the diagnostic charms he had cast many times on the parcel already. This time, instead of sending back a series of conflicting readings that put the curse into multiple categories of curse magic, it sent back a set of figures that Draco recognised instantly.
After a while, when his back was soaked in sweat and Malfoy’s fingers had somehow crept beneath his shirt to run slow circles around his hips, he realised he was tired. Drained. Exhausted.
Might I suggest respecting his boundaries whilst trying to think of an incentive for him to slowly, in his own time, let them down?
Potter broke off, eyes wide and a little glassy. He closed them and swallowed, taking a slow, measured breath. Draco’s stomach was churning, the alcohol he’d already drunk heavy like stone, and all he could taste was bile.
“Come on, for Merlin’s sake. Just—” there was rustling from the bed, and then Malfoy was beside him, gripping his shoulder much more gently than he would have expected from how annoyed he’d just managed to sound. “It’ll be fine. What was it you said the other day? This’ll be a good opportunity for us to learn about ourselves and each other. To learn how to, what?
Potter continued to stare into his glass. It was as if he hadn’t even heard Draco, as if he was somewhere far away. Draco didn’t repeat the question; he just waited.
He looked up to see Malfoy waving his goblet at Harry, one eyebrow raised as he stared pointedly at Harry’s own glass. Confused, Harry picked up his own goblet on reflex, holding it out for the bizarre toast Malfoy appeared to be giving him.
Potter’s brows drew down, fury flashing across his face for a split second before being replaced by something darker.
An expression crossed Potter’s face very fast, full of guilt, sorrow, anger, and regret. Draco could do nothing about it—not that he knew what he would have done anyway—because George had crossed the room and lifted the lid of the box.
Harry opened his mouth to say something—anything—but nothing came out. He tried several more times on the trip down to the Great Hall, but each time, the words stalled on his tongue or got lost in his throat before they were able to make it out his mouth, and they spent the trip in tense, uncomfortable silence.
Strangely, he wasn’t crying anymore. Harry traced slow circles on Malfoy’s back and listened to him talk.
He waited until Potter had finished securing the area, then told him, “It’s a hellfire curse. Likely the only one, since they always set each other off when they’re in close proximity.”
“They’d be covered in boils within the hour,” she finished, and then fell sideways off her chair, laughing all the way to the ground.
“No one else is here,” Draco agreed, looking around at the stark room. His voice echoed a little as he spoke. “I wonder if Pansy wants us to go upstairs.”
“—and I spent several exhausting days searching for you and trying to blend in by talking like a chav.” He pinches the bridge of his nose and winces, presumably at the memory of his abused vocal chords. “I tried an accent spell but it didn’t work and I ended up sounding like Steve Irwin on cocaine. At least without the spell I was in control of the sounds coming out of my mouth.”
but he spooks so easily, Blaise. I tried to bring up the idea of therapy and he nearly attacked me!”
“The second one.” Malfoy sat down on the edge of the bed, legs crossed and his chin propped in his hand. “If we freeze in the middle of this, we’re no use to anyone.”
that.” Irritation broke through into Blaise’s tone. “Merlin, Draco. You’re trying to do this all on your own. I
The word was quiet, reluctant, but Draco heard it all the same. He thought about ignoring it, but that wasn’t why he was here. Fighting against Potter was only going to risk their safety, and in the quiet recesses of his mind even he could admit it was a stupid idea.
But Malfoy was there, gripping his knee and running gentle circles with his thumb. It was the most surreal thing Harry had ever experienced—stranger than dying. He was a little ashamed but mostly unsurprised when he felt his cock start to pay attention.
Draco tried to focus on the words, but he was too far away. All he could hear was laughter, and it made him grit his teeth and nearly walk out the door. He managed to stop himself and instead walked closer to the counter, pretending to eye some enchanted pigmy puff toys.
“It’s an excellent idea.” The warmth in his own tone just about disgusted him, if he wasn’t already resigned to what Potter was turning him into.
Harry’s stomach swooped, his erection suddenly straining against the front of his jeans. “Me too,” he admitted, his voice raspy.
Draco couldn’t find the words to reply, couldn’t think beyond the overwhelming sense of want that was consuming him.
Warm hands were running circles on Draco’s back. In front of him, Granger was arranging her coat around Potter, who still hadn’t moved. Her hands were shaking, and she kept stroking Potter’s hair tentatively, as if unsure whether or not she should be touching him.
“Then perhaps next time you might choose not to swim in a bathtub of Firewhiskey before attending such an important work meeting,” he said with a sneer. “Or does the precious Saviour not actually care about his friends as much as he professes to?”
“How can you tell?” Potter asked, staring down at Ron who was now being tended to by his brother and the willowy lady.
“We’d better find this Kalen O'Fearadhaigh then,” he said after a moment, slipping the box into his jacket pocket.
He could lie, he supposed. But what was the point? Draco was already trapped in some kind of prophecy with Potter. He may as well explain about everything else Fate was handing out.
“All you have to do,” he spat out slowly, “is leave. That’s it. The curse will probably lift if you just
She didn’t know what had happened; Draco could tell as much from her confused expression. She guessed, maybe. But for some reason, she didn’t bring it up, didn’t probe him for answers. He was grateful for the space.
It was almost like this was a third Potter, sitting in front of him. He was unlike the happy, light-hearted person he was with his friends, and again unlike the brooding, volatile person that Draco was becoming so intrigued by. Was it really just that they were both making the effort, for the first time, to work together? If Draco had known that was all it took to get his proverbial handshake, he would have threatened their lives long ago.
“You? Not universally liked? I never would have guessed—you’re practically Mr. Congeniality himself.”
Potter made a half-hearted attempt at batting it away, but they were too far gone to really care. The hard length of Potter’s cock was pressed against Draco’s thigh, his own quickly swelling in response. He tugged at the front of Potter’s trousers, pulling at the buttons until they burst open and he could slide his hand down into the intoxicating warmth of Potter’s boxers. It was an awkward angle, made more difficult by the way Potter immediately ground against him without giving him space to adjust.
He wondered if Potter was having flashbacks to the war. It wouldn’t be a surprise. With everything Potter had gone through, it would be shocking if he
, my choices don’t matter and my fate was laid out before I was born and that no matter what I do, I’m about to die.
, as if the two were mutually exclusive. Harry quirked his lip; he knew the feeling. It didn’t make sense to him, either, but it also did in a weird, abstract, squinty kind of way.
Malfoy started making regular little sounds, thrashing his head from time to time, but it wasn’t enough. Harry had read in one of the other books about the perineum, and how pressing against it was a way of hitting the prostate from the outside. He put that knowledge to good use now, using his free hand to cup Malfoy’s balls and feel around with his thumb until Malfoy was rocking enthusiastically back against him and swearing.
you are!” It was Hermione. “Where have you been? Breakfast is almost over. If we don’t hurry, you won’t have anything until lunch. No, don’t argue, come on, before Ron eats everything himself.”
“A rigid application program,” Draco said, sliding a piece of parchment across the table for Potter to assess.
Draco made a big show of sighing before he lay back down, this time pulling the covers up over them—a clear signal that their conversation was over.
You do remember sending me that letter last week, right before you left, don’t you? I know you said you’d had too many G&Ts, but your handwriting was far too legible for you to be that pissed. Just give me your address so we can talk. I know we don’t have a great track record, but never say never.
Because he was watching Malfoy so closely, taking care not to drink any more than him, he noticed that Malfoy hardly drank. He either passed the bottle off or took a sip so deceptively long that it looked like he was keeping up when he really only swallowed once. The others soon slipped into a comfortably drunken state, and Malfoy relaxed against the pillows, his cheeks pleasantly flushed and his guard—for once—completely down.
With a tremendous amount of effort, he takes the paper Draco passes him and sits down at the table. It isn’t long before he throws the paper away again, good mood evaporating and taking with it the pleasant cloud of lethargy that usually sits with him until his first cup of tea.
Harry froze, holding himself still as his attention switched instantaneously from the sensations on his cock to Draco’s worried face.
Then he realised Potter meant true Veela, not half Veela, and the reason why he had never found that tidbit in his own texts slotted into place.
Neville managed to take a long drink without coughing once and passed the bottle back to Malfoy. Harry wondered for a moment if he might refuse, but he picked up the bottle, wiped it delicately with his sleeve, and took a sip. Harry’s eyes fell to his throat as he swallowed, and he quickly looked away.
The warmth of Draco’s breath hitting his neck made Harry shiver, and he subconsciously rolled to face him and draw him in closer.
Potter was waiting for him at the counter, dressed in a rich, navy three-piece suit that made Draco stumble a little when he saw. It was the suit he had admired in the window the other day, the one he’d said Potter should buy.
The room was silent, filled only with the sound of gently whirring gears as they ticked steadily around.
There was a moment when time seemed to slow down, when Potter was looking at him with an expression that Draco finally acknowledged was familiar—was the way Potter often looked at him when he was drunk or a little bit tired or vulnerable for another reason altogether—and he thought to himself: they’re all Potter. He was a bit delirious and incredibly tired, but in that moment, it made sense. All these sides of Potter that he kept seeing, kept being confused—or sometimes turned on—by, they were all Potter, none of them more real than the other. It was just that, for some inexplicable reason, Draco was the only one who got to see them all.
Draco’s laughter subsides and he glances over at Harry, puzzled. “Send me?” His eyes widen. “Oh, right. Ah…” he trails off, a complicated expression on his face.
Harry’s mind begins to fill with a strange, buzzing sort of static that he hasn’t heard since he was a child. He shoves it away.
“I spelled it clean first!” Draco insists. “Merlin knows I’m not drinking from some stranger’s stinking footwear.”
Eventually, the sound of the bar began to die, vibrant chatter being replaced by sleepy conversation and wide yawns. Draco thought Potter must have forgotten about their plans, but then their eyes met and Potter lifted his eyebrows in question.
Harry cried out, his eyes fluttering shut and his head rolling back as Draco let go for a moment and simply ground against his hip with a moan. The slick slide of their bodies together, the intimacy of Draco’s arms caged around him, was almost too much, and he knew he wasn’t going to last long. He opened his eyes and found Draco watching him, not just with open desire, but with love—warm, bright, and clear.
Harry kept pressing at the spot he’d found, eyes darting between Malfoy’s face, cock and arse. He couldn’t decide which part he liked best, and it was all he could do to take it all in at the same time.
They spent the night in Malfoy’s bed, side by side, sharing the simple comfort of knowing someone else was within arm’s reach. They awoke face to face, legs tangled, covers cuccooning them in warmth, fingers laced together. On any other day, it would have been weird, but today it simply felt right in a way few things had of late. There was no one else to seek comfort in, and a strange part of Harry thought he might not want someone else even if there was.
“Stop trying to outwit him. Stop trying to reveal only half your hand at a time so that he doesn’t spook. He’s a Gryffindor. Tell him everything and trust in his instincts.”
“He’s in surgery.” Potter’s words sounded almost dead. “We can’t go in until he’s out. If he makes it out.”
“Fucking bollocks,” Draco hissed, climbing to his feet and looking around at the curse. After a long moment, he admitted, “I didn’t expect it to be an entire room.”
He picks up one of the toys at random, feels the weight of it in his hand and closes his eyes at the rush of want that suddenly fills him. Maybe this won’t be so bad. Maybe this will be what they need to rekindle… whatever it was that they lost.
Draco gives him a long-suffering look, but instead of protesting, he simply flips the two of them over in the bed and resumes his earlier position. Harry’s head tips back onto the pillow at the same time Draco’s mouth wraps around him, and he cries out in bliss.
When he emerged from his bedroom, Potter did a double take at the sight of his face but wisely did not mention the eyes. Draco noted, uncharitably, that this may have been more due to the fact that he had covered Draco’s living room in peacock feathers rather than any sense of polite conduct.
Somewhere through the haze of anxiety, Draco acknowledged that Potter equated love with infatuation. He filed it away for later and forced himself to laugh.
“No,” Draco said, giving his head a little shake and stepping into the house. “I Floo-called your house and Ginevra answered, looking a bit frantic. She said I’d find you here.”
Very quickly, it became apparent that the angle they were working with wasn’t to their advantage. The bed was too low or Harry was too tall, and he couldn’t go very far without having to bend his knees uncomfortably or hunch awkwardly over Draco.
Draco huffed, but looked around for the wrapping paper. He’d found a truly atrocious set in a bargain bin at Flourish and Blotts, and he couldn’t wait to show Harry. His eyes landed on the edge of a bright pink roll, tucked behind the Christmas tree, and he pounced.
“I honestly don’t know, Potter,” Draco admitted. “Morgan made it sound as if it was the Fair Folk behind this curse, but why would they use symbols designed to trap and ensnare them?”
Potter snorted, and then to Draco’s shock said, “Malfoy figured out you had the inhibitor. It’s thanks to him you’re awake.”
“Alright?” he asked, grasping Draco’s hip tightly in an effort not to blow his load right then and there.
“Yeah.” Potter grinned, finally turning to him and sliding his fingers into Draco’s. “I thought it would make a nice first date.”
“Sorry, Malfoy.” The grimace on his face almost did look apologetic. “I am going to need the two of you to swear it—it’s policy. Do you think Parkinson could come by in—”
Draco’s cheeks flushed, and he looked away. “I don’t think that will work for what we want.” He cleared his throat. “Even if we do ignite rumors that we’re… together—”
“I asked him—” His voice breaks. He clears his throat and tries again. “I asked him why, why he was doing it all. It’s over, Ron.”
“Don’t you think you’re overreacting, mate?” Ron asks, wide-eyed as he stares at Harry over the top of his beer. “I mean, you both seem pretty happy to me.”
Draco inclined his head, unsurprised at the sombre atmosphere surrounding their table. Barring the solitude and poor choice of venue, they had probably had similar intentions to him, coming out tonight.
Harry supposed that was probably a pretty good estimate—after all, now that Malfoy’d said it, he felt that way, too.
Malfoy made a tired noise behind him, and when Harry turned around, he noted that Malfoy did not look like someone who had watched bees all afternoon. Black circles rimmed his eyes, and there was an edge of terror in the whites of his eyes. Harry crossed the balcony quickly and cleared the small table they had been using for their meals. In perfect timing, the house-elves sent up the plates, and Harry made sure that Malfoy got his first.
He knew what the connection was: the Malfoy line. Peacocks were linked to Malfoys, and Malfoys were linked to Veela, but what the hell did Potter know?
“When I was young,” Malfoy continued, propping himself back on his hands and staring ahead with an air of someone telling a grand story. “My parents hired out and commandeered an entire wing of Mt Mungos for me to play Healer in.”
The next time they’d seen the Slytherins, they’d all met at the bar and ordered jagerbombs to toast everyone’s good health.
A hex that pushed them to the heights of their emotion—rage, fury—and then froze them when they did.
Draco’s tiredness disappeared, replaced by a burning need to get Potter alone, to hear his voice where there were no other distractions, to see all the many emotions he wore openly on his face when he stopped worrying about who was watching.
Their eyes met, and Draco felt the cold, icy fingers of dread creeping up his chest as he realised there was a good possibility that, even if they survived whatever the curse did, he and Potter would never remember this.
“Come on, Potter, you’re smarter than this,” Draco snapped. “Since when does that make a difference? So, what we do is we market it so that pure-bloods
Malfoy’s eyes flashed cold, unreadable, as he clinked his goblet against Harry’s and said, “Here’s to a fast resolution, Potter.”
Now, the more important question was: how in Merlin’s name was he going to unknit the first layer of the curse’s shield, when the entire curse was presenting itself as an analogue mechanism? A vision of jamming the wand into one of the gears and watching the entire thing stutter to an explosive halt ran through his mind, and he viciously dismissed it.
The two of them jumped before realising it was only Pansy. She glared at Draco suspiciously, but for once he was confident they had no need to worry about being caught out. After all, this time their closeness had nothing to do with their charade.
Green didn’t identify intent; it meant the curse’s will was done. It was as if they were in the throes of the curse itself, which was impossible because they were
He studied the way Potter’s face was lit with a fervor, the way Potter scanned the notes on the parchment intently, looking for connections and making plans. It was like watching the sun rise, spreading light and wonder as far as the eye can see. His breath caught in his throat and a painful ache started up deep in his chest. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that Potter was in so much pain, and it wasn’t fair that Draco had to watch in silence.
“And if you don’t move forward, then what the hell was the point of the guilt?” Weasley continued, shrugging. “So it’s important to learn from the mistakes you make. We fucked up. If I had my time again, I’d do things differently. And if something like this
Merlin, wasn’t that pathetic. He’d fallen in love with Potter, and on the way he’d learned to love himself.
“I think you’d make a quick distraction, like complaining loudly about the signage above the bar, so we we’re all looking at it, and then quickly confirm you were going ahead with things because you’re both so terrible at working together you couldn’t trust that one of you wasn’t going to hang the other one out to dry,” Weasley suggested, smirking. “Am I right?”
He stepped back and shoved his hands in his pockets. Potter didn’t look at him, but at least he didn’t tear up the parchment either. After a moment of silence, Draco nodded awkwardly.
Draco was holding himself very carefully now. Harry felt him start to lift his head up, presumably to look at Harry and ask him what the fuck he was going on about, but Harry quickly grabbed a hold of his shoulder and pushed lightly, the gesture a plea to wait. Slowly, Draco dropped back down.
“The curse and I are currently in agreement,” Draco muttered, spitting the words around the shape of his beak. “Give me a minute.”
Potter shook his head, but there was a curious gleam in his eye. “But I can find out pretty quickly,” he said with a grin.
“I didn’t leave you in the Manor this time,” Potter said, awkwardly turning away. “I took you with me.”
“How do you make so much mess?” Malfoy asks, giving his head a little shake and finally turning to him with a strange smile on his face. “It looks as though ten people live here.”
It was through knowing and sharing himself that he finally found himself falling properly, completely, inevitably into love.
Harry supposes he’s not really one to talk; he couldn’t even wait until he was inside before he ate his own.
think that,” Ron gave his girlfriend a disgusted look and turned consolingly to Harry—a much more appropriate reaction. “That sounds bloody awful. Having to socialise, ugh. Can you imagine being put together with someone like Malfoy? I reckon he’d be right miserable to whatever poor sod he was paired up with.”
The sinking feeling grew, spreading cold fingers through Draco’s veins. He couldn’t say he was surprised, but Potter obviously wasn’t taking it with the same jaded dismissal that Draco had. Was this part of everything that was going on with Potter right now?
Draco caught sight of his reflection in the mirror above the sideboard. He looked far thinner than he remembered, eyes heavy with tiredness but brimming with a restless fury. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to sleep, but he knew it was far too dangerous to attempt anything tonight.
Potter was watching him, eyes dark and full of heat. His shirt was riding low, the fabric stretching over his chest and dipping below his collar. In the space between the shadow of his neck and his collarbone, Draco could see Potter’s pulse thudding under his skin. He ached to press his tongue there, to taste the sweat that dipped into the hollow of Potter’s throat.
“Chin up.” Blaise patted him on the back. “The worst you can do is fuck everything up completely, and hey—you’re already doing that!”
Granger snorted. “That sounds dangerous.” She turned back to Draco. “We really do have to run now. Thanks again.”
He stepped forward and smiled, noting that Potter took several seconds before he seemed to process the movement and realise that Draco was there.
In the background, he could hear the Healers asking questions and his friends answering as best they could. He couldn’t work out what they were saying; the words didn’t make sense anymore.
Without even meaning to, he was reaching towards Potter, some part of him aching to console the broken man before him. What had happened in the last few minutes to lead to
Across the table, Pansy, Weasley, and Granger had stopped laughing. The way Potter was looking at him was like nothing Draco had ever experienced before. They’d argued in their time, even after they became friends of a sort. It was nothing like this. Potter argued like he was wielding a sword, righteous and full of fury, no quarter given. But the way he was arguing now was as if Draco had already drawn the first blow.
From his satchel, Harry pulled a stack of books that had been transfigured to look like ordinary NEWT-level Transfiguration books. He changed them back with a flick of his wand and pushed them toward Malfoy, who looked increasingly incredulous and curious.
There was very little Draco could do to turn the tide of the war, not with all he had so far done. But he could perhaps do one thing. He could get Potter out of here before the Dark Lord came.
Harry sighed and began to load his plate from the portioned offerings in front of him, presented so that no one else would have to touch his plates. Somewhere along the way, a house-elf had vanished his bags.
Draco didn’t have to fake the jealousy that he knew was creeping into his expression. Granger did a double take when she saw his face but didn’t say anything.
“I know this is all fun and games to you, but it’s no wonder they were pissing themselves laughing the other night.” He jabbed a finger at their friends, before turning immediately back to Draco. “You have no respect for anyone but yourself. How could you possibly pull off a functional relationship?”
Something soft hit his face, and he opened one eye to find a pillow as his only protection from Potter’s glare.
When Draco found out that Harry Potter had become an Unspeakable, he hurled three bottles of Chateau Mouton at the wall and set his curtains on fire.
Potter shrugged. “I’m just wondering if we can do something to help. Make sure fewer kids grow up with parents who are afraid of them, when there’s absolutely no reason for them to be scared.” He cleared his throat. “Make sure fewer kids grow up thinking they’re freaks.”
A dinging sound, like a bell, startled them apart. The dial in the centre of the balcony glowed gently, and they both crossed the floor in two strides to see the reading.
Potter frowned, seeming unwilling to speak and break the strange spell that had descended over them. “So, this is some kind of fairy entrapment curse? It pulls the fairy inside and then makes sure they can’t escape?”
Malfoy turned his head a degree toward Harry, but didn’t say anything in response. It was clear he was listening, though, so with only a little awkwardness, Harry suffered on in finding the right words.
Something chimed like a bell, and Potter looked down at the device on his wrist. Whatever he saw there, it made him flinch and recoil, the expression on his face shifting back into that anger from before. Only this time, it came with some inner conflict—sick and wretched. Draco wondered how he could read Potter so well, but before he could question himself, it was gone.
Draco turned around to study him. He had a point; that same question had been bothering him since they’d started. “I didn’t think we’d be inside it,” he said, stepping into the centre of the room and looking around at the moving walls. “I thought our minds would put us in the workroom and the curse would be where the package is, just with a different appearance. But despite the fact that we do appear to be inside the curse itself, its defences are still there.”
“There’s your romance,” he said, reaching for one of the vials by Malfoy’s hip. “Get properly on the bed so I don’t have to do this half bent over.”
A faint pink tinge rose on Malfoy’s cheeks, and he exhaled in a rush, the corners of his mouth lifting into a fraction of a smile. “I must confess,” he said drily. “My adrenaline is kicking in and my first impulse is to insult you. Can I make fun of your hair a little? It will make me feel better.”
“Oh,” he breathed, infinitely relieved she hadn’t been saying what he thought she’d been saying. “Yes. Yes, we are.”
Harry shrugged awkwardly. “Well, when you two started dating, Ernie asked all that stuff about…” he coughed suddenly, realising exactly where he was going with this and suddenly very much not wanting to ask it.
They had already passed four days into their intended two day lock-down, and the stirring resurgence of emotion in Harry’s gut didn’t feel like a positive thing, no matter if it likely was. He wasn’t enjoying remembering what it felt like to be overwhelmed. Powerless.
Finally, they fell apart and Draco dropped down on the bed while Potter leaned over to grab a handful of tissues and spit into them.
Draco tried not to wince at her phrasing. Then he tried not to remember what his younger self would have thought.
Malfoy led him from the Great Hall all the way up to the library in silence. He sat at one of the long tables and gestured for Harry to take the seat beside him.
“When you grow up beneath my father’s thumb, Potter, you learn a thing or two about how to manipulate people. The question that remains is how you choose to equate that possibility with your own morality.”
“You guys head on,” he said, grabbing Ron’s abandoned water glass and draining it. “I’ll wait a bit and then Apparate from the alley.”
Then he stood, arms coming to wrap around Draco’s waist and draw him closer. There was a moment where they simply stood and watched each other. Draco’s fingers had drawn down to cup Potter’s jaw, and every place where they touched burned with heat. Draco bent down, closing the distance between them, and pressed their lips together. He wondered if Potter could feel the thudding of his heart between their mouths, if his pulse really was bursting through every millimeter of skin. It certainly felt like it.
“Draco, will you marry me?” Harry asked, his fingers brushing against something in his inside pocket. “I have a ring, but… I don’t want to bring it out and have everyone hate me for proposing five minutes before the bride’s big moment.”
After what felt like several years, Malfoy nodded. He got up from the bed, the pillow dropping beside him onto the floor, and crossed the room.
Then there was a loud crack, like Apparition mixed with a car crash, and both George and the box disappeared.
He trailed his hands lower, running his fingers along the juncture of Potter’s thighs and pushing gently until Potter was perfectly exposed. He felt the moment the atmosphere changed, the moment Potter realised what was happening. A faint whimper fell from his mouth and his legs opened wider still, knees falling back towards his chest and outwards while his ankles rested on the bed.
A jolt of heat rushed through him. Potter almost looked like he was jealous. His jaw was set firm and his eyes were piercing as he stared at Draco, challenging him.
Those were the basic divisions of all curses: mercurial curses dealt with explosions and catalysts, things of a volatile nature; psychical curses affected the mind or soul; and tacit curses were the insidious curses that crept into your very being and manipulated you, controlled you. Between the three branches, they covered everything Draco had seen and could expect to see in all known curses, but it wasn’t helping him now. It was almost as if he had to dissect the entire curse from scratch so that he could categorise it somewhere new before he could even begin dismantling it.
It has been a privilege to know you, Potter. In whatever sense that may mean. I wish you the very best in your life. It is a shame we were never friends, but some things aren’t meant to be.
“Who else is joining us?” Malfoy asked, dropping his bag on one of the beds and turning to face Harry with an expression of utter boredom.
When they were certain no one was in any danger, Morgan waved her hands again, and the store exploded once more into sound and motion, the echo of the explosion ringing in their ears.
that he didn’t scare Potter away, and Potter was looking well spooked. “I think you’re fit, and it’s clear we make a good team.” He waved a hand at the parchment in front of them. “What if we tried this for real?”
He searched blindly for Draco’s lips, kissing him and grabbing the back of his neck to pull him closer, kiss him harder, deeper. They were still pressed together, the sensitivity making them both whimper, but neither of them made any move to break apart. When Draco finally pulled away to breathe, Harry looked down and realised he had run his hands through Draco’s hair so much, they were both covered in glitter, their sweat-soaked skin shimmering in the moonlight like water.
Draco let his hands come to rest on Harry’s hips, the silence of the empty change room settling around them. It was comforting, as if he had one foot set in the past while facing inexorably forward to the future.
Potter looked over at him, eyes and face already soft with sleep. “You don’t have to go home, obviously. Just stay here. No sense in running out the door; we’re friends.”
Potter exuded an aura of fearlessness, of strength. He always had. Tonight—like many other nights—Draco had been caught by the twinkle in his eyes, the unexpected wit of his humor. He had been enraptured, dazed, falling with no end in sight. And now, to discover that this lurked beneath the surface…
He threw his spoon into the bowl where it landed with a strident clatter, sending flecks of chocolate liquid onto the table cloth. When he looked up at Blaise, there wasn’t even a hint of chagrin in his expression.
They linked arms and walked toward the orchard gate. The peacocks had flown over the fence again and were busy hunting for the insects that liked to congregate near the fruit. Pansy pointed out a particularly ferocious hunter with a giggle, and the seriousness of their conversation faded away.
Draco stopped drinking. He felt sick with the realisation that he had never seen it, and then the sickness—the guilt—evaporated as the twisted burn of rage took its place. Perhaps he had never noticed, but Potter’s friends should have. They should have understood it; how could it be that
“Yeah, well… yeah,” he said lamely, giving Malfoy the hairy eyeball, like he couldn’t believe Malfoy was capable of saying something that mostly lacked vitriol.
Malfoy gave a surprised laugh, glancing at him quickly before looking back at the parchment. “I suppose we’d better get on with it.”
“Oh, my god,” he enthused. He’d laid back down on the bed and covered his eyes with his elbow, still shaking with laughter. “Oh, my
Suddenly, Potter’s gaze refocused and he looked at Draco properly. “I’m leaving,” he said, the words flat and toneless.
Malfoy looked at him with narrowed eyes, like he was waiting for a punch-line at his expense. It didn’t come, and eventually, he said, “Yes. It measures emotional volatility.”
“I thought I was solving the problem by removing myself from the equation, but it doesn’t work like that.” Harry scrubs the back of his neck. “I abandoned you and it was a real shit move. I’m sorry.”
He did, then, slowly at first, worried about giving too much stimulation and overwhelming Draco by going too fast or being too rough, but as they both got used to the sensation, his movements became more smooth.
“What do you remember?” Potter asked hesitantly, confirming that he had witnessed Draco’s dream. “Did we change the past?”
He let himself out the front door to Apparate. The last thing he saw before he closed it behind him was Potter turning out the light, plunging the apartment into darkness.
Draco let the conversation filter over him as he tried to think of something he could say to make Potter feel better, or to allay his fears in some way. But there was nothing. Potter worked for the Ministry; the Ministry was corrupt. There was nothing Draco could say or do to make that go away.
Harry reached for his hand and held it, staring around them with awe, and Draco quite forgot the view in place of his boyfriend’s expression.
The way Malfoy ground slowly against the bed, fingers digging into Harry’s hips hard enough to bruise, told Harry everything he needed to know. He bit his lip, eyes squeezed shut as the warm mist caressed him, and let everything go.
She glared at him for long moments before finally nodding. He moved to go back inside, but she stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
Draco had a single moment to think that he could look into those eyes forever before they disappeared and the world went black.
Potter must have felt him looking because he looked up at Draco and smiled for a moment before turning back to the parchment. It was a distracted, sleepy little smile that Draco had never seen on him before—real in a way that Draco rarely experienced with Potter.
“Oh.” Potter cast an uncertain glance in Draco’s direction, and Draco felt his stomach flip. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re good.”
Malfoy stared down at him without expression. Harry became increasingly aware of just how little he was wearing in his—technically Ron’s—old Chudley Cannons’ jersey compared to Malfoy, who was fully dressed. Hastily, he pulled the blanket up to his chin, but the damage was already done.
The words were barely more than a whisper, but Blaise heard them all the same. He smiled, radiant and warm, and the moment faded away.
“You arse,” Draco breathed, and then he straightened himself up and followed Harry into their bedroom.
He’d dreamed of kissing Harry Potter once. He’d dreamed that the kiss was brutal and rough, a mixture of repressed desires and hidden shame, knowing that he wasn’t good enough for this and taking it anyway. There was still a hint of that now, as they carried the past into the future with them, and there was even a surprising amount of shame from Harry himself. It made Draco think of the small dark spaces in Harry’s dreams and all the things they didn’t know about each other.
The world below the balcony was as empty as his own, and he stared down at the silent grounds feeling oddly disquieted. He’d thought the whole quarantine thing was something he could stomach well enough on his own—just power through and deal with the consequences later. It’s how he’d always managed; it’s how he always would.
“I don’t know think you even know you’re doing it,” she continued, her voice growing soft with concern. “I’ve seen that look on you before. I
He makes a noise at the back of his throat, part whimper, part gasp that is full of such yearning that he immediately longs to take it back. Malfoy’s eyes snap open. For a moment, his face flickers with confusion, and then he pulls away, just enough that his lips still brush across the end of Harry’s cock. He turns, his eyes landing on the wrapper that has captured Harry’s attention. Everything stills, the fading light in the kitchen casting shadows across Malfoy’s face so that Harry can’t quite see what his expression is.
“Malfoy, you don’t need to go all stilted and formal,” Potter tried. “Look, I’m sorry how that came out. It’s not the whole story. I can tell you what—”
Potter rolled his eyes so hard it must have hurt. “My sins. Right. Trust you to see visiting your house as a sin.”
He cleared his throat and looked away. A flash of blond hair across the table caught his eye, and he looked up to find Malfoy watching him. He was sitting between Lavender and Neville, with a full person’s worth of space on either side of him. It made him look smaller. Their eyes met, and Harry looked away.
Lacking any other choice, since he’d only brought curse-related items with him, he’d outlined everything in great detail to the professors below and hoped Lockhart could figure it out.
Draco straightened and stared at him. “Those are some incredible leaps of logic,” he said airily. “Are you sure those are real prophecies you’re dreaming of? Because I’m beginning to think your imagination just needed another outlet.”
Harry swallowed and shifted in his chair. Draco’s eyes dropped lower, to the slight bulge at the front of Harry’s black jeans.
He strode forward, pulled back the largest curtain, and slammed his fist straight into the wall. With a shattering like glass, the room crumpled away.
“We can’t be late,” Draco insisted, trying to step back but succeeding only in slipping his fingers beneath Harry’s waistband.
Harry doesn’t know how long they rest like that, each of them spent and a little broken, but he knows he’s not the only one slowly being filled with a tentative, new hope. He thought this was his Daydream come to life, but so did Malfoy. Though one question still remains.
Harry studied her for any signs of an ulterior motive, but reluctantly decided that she just looked cold. He couldn’t really say no to that.
“There’s a warning, right before they fire,” Harry explained, eyes crinkling with amusement. “Whether or not they choose to challenge that is entirely their decision.”
He watched Potter closely out of the corner of his eye, pretending the question was casual, dismissive. He took in the way Potter froze, steadying himself against the desk since he was still swaying slightly from the drink, and turned to glare at him.
Finally, he cleared his throat and slowed down. “I am calling you ‘Draco’,” he said with affected care, “because it seems ridiculous, after everything that has happened, to keep calling you ‘Malfoy’, don’t you think?”
Getting the message, Harry groaned and pushed back as Draco slicked his fingers with lube and slid them inside. Before long, he was panting and writhing, and Draco didn’t waste time lining up his cock and thrusting inside, slow and hard. He gripped Harry’s shirt beneath his hands and reached around, tugging at Harry’s cock in the same rhythm as his steady thrusts.
Harry hears a quiet snicker, and it takes him a second but then he’s laughing too and lifting up his hat to peer at Draco with one eye. “Well you definitely haven’t grown up, have you?”
He watched Potter for the remainder of the evening, watched him in a way he’d never thought to before. It was there, in every movement, every subtle shift to his expression. Potter was never calm, never just
They hadn’t talked about the conversation they’d had the other night when they’d been drinking. They hadn’t even mentioned sharing that they were both virgins. Harry’d woken up the next morning half convinced it’d been a dream, but this definitely wasn’t a dream now. He pinched his arm discreetly and the resounding pain told him it definitely, definitely wasn’t a dream.
Malfoy’s tone was so flat, Harry actually looked up at him. “Sorry, no… Sunlight cleanses the air. Only works on airborne curses.”
“What double act?” he growled, and Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes at how beautifully Potter was illustrating his point.
—the air shifted strangely, as though time were slowing down, impeded by the fog of despair and unhappiness that permeated from Draco as he realised what was about to happen, how defenceless Potter was about to leave him—
“No, Malfoy.” Potter shook his head exasperatedly. “We were just talking about the feeling of magic—types of magic feel different, yeah? Well, this curse has felt strange ever since it settled, and I just worked out why. It doesn’t feel like an ordinary blood curse. It feels like a casting, like there are words that set it off.”
“As much as offering self-care suggestions to you goes against every ounce of free will in my body,” Draco said with a sigh. “Don’t you think you should sleep instead? The urgency has disappeared—Weasley is awake. You’re of no use to me if you’re falling asleep on the job.”
Suddenly, the lights flickered into life, and they turned to find Pansy leaning in the entrance to the stairwell, arms folded. For a moment, fear flickered in Draco’s chest as he took in the faint note of apprehension on her face. But it was gone in a flash, replaced by a reluctant smile.
“You still made the choices,” Draco said slowly. “Fate offered them, but you made them. Even now, you changed the prophecy. You opened the curse.” His words came out almost reverent. “It might have been a dream, but you made the choice.”
Draco Vanished the pinboard, and as it disappeared a funny jolt twisted in his stomach. A tugging, pulling thing. He straightened and shook his head—bizarre.
It was why Draco had begun this peacock sanctuary. He was giving back in the only way he knew how, the only way the world would accept from him: by caring for, amongst others, the magical flock that had cared for his family for centuries. By making amends for the shit-awful way his family had used that gift. By trying, desperately, to say sorry.
The waiting room was ice cold. They hadn’t been allowed in to see him yet, but they’d been told that he’d come out of the catatonia as soon as they’d landed from the Portkey. Draco read between the lines on that one. He wondered just how violent Potter had been when he’d come back to himself hurtling through empty space and landing somewhere he didn’t recognise.
No matter what angle or position he tried, though, he didn’t seem to be finding it. Malfoy was no help at all, too busy enjoying the sensations.
He shoved the conversation from his mind and tried to focus on other things. On Sunday, he met with Pansy for lunch. As a last minute decision, he decided to host at the Manor so that Pansy and his mother had the opportunity to catch up on old gossip. The second he walked through the double doors of the drawing room, he wondered why he’d waited so long to do so.
“Lovelorn gazes?!” Potter spat, gripping the paper so hard it tore a little. “What the hell does she mean
Draco’s stomach pitched in relief that Potter was still normal underneath it all, although he did immediately wonder why he cared.
Potter checked his watch. “We were in there less than twenty minutes,” he said, confused. “I must have pulled us out early. Check your notes—what happened?”
Harry, shockingly, agreed with Malfoy’s opinion—something that only a few years ago he never would have thought possible. He hadn’t spared a thought for Malfoy since leaving Hogwarts. He hadn’t kept track, but maybe four years had passed since then. It was weird seeing him again after so long; weirder still to have to live with him for the next three months.
Potter hurled the first one so hard it hurt, and Draco responded in kind, because no matter what the curse was doing to them, they weren’t friends.
“Alright,” he said warily. “But you’re half a second delayed when you catch. You need to make your decision when the Quaffle leaves my hands, not when it’s mid-air.”
Draco felt the warm, comforting press of someone’s hand in his own, tugging him forward, and the hot ache of tears followed quickly behind. He snatched his hand back, feeling abandoned and scornful all in one, and watched the sparkling glass of a broken chandelier whirl around him, slicing his face open, bleeding him dry.
He’d only been back in England for three days, and in that time he’d already been accosted by Pansy and Blaise on no less than four occasions. Pansy had been easily mollified with the boxes of jewelry, but Blaise had been harder to deter. He’d popped around every morning since Draco had arrived, bringing with him a box of pastries and strong coffee which he traded for Draco’s vulnerability. At least insomuch as Draco was prepared to give it.
“I reverted to fledgling stage when the curse hit,” Draco explained, staring at his hands. “Anything is possible.” He huffed a laugh. “Might even grow a beak on the new moon. Isn’t that fun?”
The lad hanging off his shoulder grins at him and punches him jovially in the shoulder, increasing the volume of his chant. Thankfully, before Harry can decide whether or not joining in on the chant crosses a line in his morals, the man finishes chugging the beer and drops the shoe onto the sand.
Potter nodded, looking the opposite of confused, which bothered Draco on levels he didn’t want to acknowledge. “And when a child does accidental magic, it accesses the core of their magical self, using the blood as a conduit, the same way as an adult does wandless magic.”
Distantly, Harry acknowledged that it had to be one of the weakest insults he’d ever heard Malfoy sling at anyone, let alone him. But Harry felt everything distantly these days; more pressing was the rising tide of fury rising inside him like an old friend. Before he knew what he was doing, he’d stomped back across the floor, braced himself on Malfoy’s desk, and leaned right up in his face to hiss, “What the hell gives you the right to act like this? People could
But Potter had been beaten down on this for a long time—years. Draco needed to choose his words carefully.
“We’ve really fucked this up,” Potter said finally, and Draco laughed, though it sounded more like a sob.
His stomach gave a little jolt at the sight of him, but he ignored it in favour of the undoubtedly more important issues at hand. Besides, the entire endeavour was futile; the two of them had nothing in common.
When he drew back, Potter’s face was caught in the light from inside. Draco’s breath hitched—at first in pure surrender, but then he saw again the lines on Potter’s face, the dark shadows beneath his eyes that were still visible, even in the afterglow.
Now that the moaning had stopped, Draco seated himself in the armchair opposite the chaise longue, where he had deposited the Boy Who Lived so he might lie back to display the full dramatic effect of his dire illness, as he no doubt desired. Steepling his fingers, he regarded his charge for several moments, noting with appreciation that the fever sweat was already drying, thanks to the helichrysum, and the manic, pained look in his eyes had been replaced with a glazed appreciation of all things sensory. That was no doubt thanks to the asphodel, or perhaps the vodka the tincture had been steeped in.
“Besides,” he muttered, sliding his chair closer to get a better look at the page Malfoy had stopped to look at in greater depth. “I
Potter shrugged. “Community service is as much as they get for that. Meanwhile, the shopkeeper is terrified for his life and thinking of closing up. It’s not right.”
The memory of Malfoy grinding against him in the club hit Harry with the force of a bludger. He stopped laughing. He remembered the way the strobe lights reflected off the glitter in Malfoy’s hair, making him shimmer, almost like he was under water, though the way he danced was anything but slow. Malfoy moved like he was fighting—sharp, certain, full of barely restrained fury. It was nothing like any of the professional dancers he had seen, who seemed so calm and graceful.
Draco blinked at the subject change. “No. But I thought they only sent the letters right before Hogwarts?”
Harry wasn’t sure who reached out first, the world seeming to pause for days before he finally felt Malfoy’s hands on him, fierce with warmth and want. He was pointy in all the wrong ways, sharp angles and fierce words, but it was that sharpness that had kept Malfoy going. Kept him chasing the cure until he found it. It shouldn’t be attractive or good at all, but it was. Harry wanted it so much, now he knew what that sharpness meant—both what it concealed and what it
Ron blinked several times before he seemed to realise he’d been asked a question. “What? Oh, no.” He huffed a laugh, turning to address Harry. “I’m staying with Neville. They’re not going to put four adults together, mate. That’s just weird.” He shuddered.
Potter, Boy Idiot, Imbecile Who Lived, had the audacity to actually grow a brain? Are you telling me that not only did he crawl his way out of that team of over-glorified scrappers, but he also managed to secure a position that is widely regarded as the most prestigious and intriguing title one can hold?”
He pulled away and spun Draco around until he was pressed face-first against the wall. Draco’s heart sped up, thumping madly in his chest as he pressed his forehead against the coolness of the brick and tried to focus on breathing. He propped his hands against the brick on either side of his chest and collapsed there, waiting.
It should have been the other way around, he would have thought, but Malfoy seemed as calm as a cucumber. Except no, he didn’t, when Harry looked closely. There was a tightness to his eyes and mouth that betrayed a hint of nervousness. His hand, though, still on Harry’s shoulder, was a relaxed, warm weight where it rested.
He no longer hated Potter, but he also suffered no delusions about how dreadful an idea it was to consider him anything more than a mild, sexy annoyance. And yet, every time Draco thought back to yesterday afternoon, pushed up against the wall with Potter’s eyes roaming over him like he was water in a desert, he managed to completely forget why.
Potter lifted his eyebrows. “The bet? I don’t think so. Unless you’re not happy with the progress?” He took a sip from his mug. “I figured it was going great, and we just need to keep at it as planned.”
The footsteps came closer and then light fingers ran through his hair, adjusting it, smoothing it back into place.
“Why the hell are you in my kitchen?” He leans back against the table, tucking himself back into his pants but leaving his trousers undone.
“Holy hell,” Draco breathed, and then his body kicked into action, flinging out his wand towards Morgan so that jet-black ropes suddenly bound her where she stood without him having to even think it.
“No one’s running anywhere fast in those slippers.” The boy laughed. “They’ve got tentacles for Merlin’s sake.”
“Malfoy, I promise I’m going to do everything I can to look out for both of us. We’re in this together. But I’m not going to pretend our relationship is something it isn’t. That’s why you wanted me as your anchor, isn’t it? Because you can trust that everything I say to you is honest, and because you don’t have to second guess anything I do?”
and terrified because he had a feeling he’d just discovered something he didn’t want to know. Again.
Kalen nodded eagerly. “We could cross an Undetectable Extension charm with a Portkey—I’ve been working on something similar.”
“Don’t hesitate to call on me if you need anything,” she said quietly, extending a graceful hand to clasp Draco’s shoulder. “We all love Ron very much. I don’t want to see this happen again.”
It isn’t enough to have this and nothing more. He had thought that if it was only sex, it would be just like every other time he had brought himself off to the thought of haughty lips and an accent like cut glass. But it isn’t; it is so much more. His deepest desires run so much deeper than sex, and now that he knows what he is missing, he can’t possibly pretend anymore.
“Robards didn’t even read it properly. Just kept going on about the budget and how the Ministry can’t be seen playing favourites.”
Draco fished around in his pocket for a treat and gave it to the indignant bird, who immediately flew away. A muffled sound of despair came from behind him, and he turned back to see Potter already halfway out the door.
They crouched behind a group of partygoers making their way to the garden and followed them outside.
The words came haltingly. “I didn’t know how to do what I needed to do. Your words made sense, and I could see how things weren’t right, but it was all from a distance. It was like I understood the theory but not the practice.”
Pansy, Weasley, and Granger continued to stare down at the newspaper on the table and howl. Weasley actually had tears in his eyes. Fortunately, Potter looked just as confused as Draco felt, so there was that.
But slowly, he found himself changing too. He kept seeing Eleanor, kept making progress on himself. They began sharing those moments—he and Potter. Not much, only bits and pieces. The things that made their heart sing, the pieces of themselves that they had rediscovered and wanted to share.
Harry stretched and then leaned back on the bench, propping himself up by the hands. Draco took a moment to admire him in all his naked glory.
“Well, we let their imaginations run wild,” Potter said with a private smile. “Refuse to fill in the gaps, and then—” he paused, mulling it over.
Potter came over to his house after work. It was strange to see him in Draco’s space like this. The afternoon sun streamed in the kitchen window, sending soft shadows dancing on the walls as the trees outside moved and swayed. Potter leant against Draco’s kitchen counter, a mug of steaming tea in his hand, and he seemed to be assessing Draco’s ceiling with the intense focus of a grand war master.
He stared at the pinboard for a while, trying to work out what he was making up for by undergoing this horrible entanglement with Potter. It couldn’t possibly be owed to Potter, could it? But then, how could it not? He had one more debt to pay after his one, and no reparations made to Harry Potter so far, which was a hilarious concept. Truly hysterical. As if Fate would ever let him off without paying his debt to Harry Potter.
“This is what it looks like inside?” Draco asked, still running his hand along Potter’s back but turning to George. “The first box must have triggered the dormant spell in the second—I should have thought of that.” He grimaced, silently cursing his own stupidity.
Directives were snarled, hexes thrown, Bellatrix’s wild hair whipping in a frenzy that punctuated every flash of hatred from her wand.
Was all of this, today, some kind of response to what he’d said last night before they’d gone to sleep? Was he trying to be nicer? If so, fat lot of good that effort seemed to be doing. Was he maybe embarrassed by what they’d said yesterday? Or, more to the point, was he embarrassed by what
“The—” Potter trailed off, took the glass, drained it, and tried again. “The Fair Folk? Like, fairies? I thought they were a myth.”
Draco stood up straight and brushed his hair back out of his eyes, examining the vial with satisfaction. “My wand is very pure, thank you very much,” he said with a smirk. “It’s perfectly encased in the appropriate materials and spellwork required for it to be used in wandmaking. The problem is that when used in wandmaking, the hairs retain their initial properties, meaning that my wand will try to drain the purity from the new hairs—it’s why I have to be very careful whenever I use unicorn hairs in my ingredients. They’re temperamental bastards who have the audacity to become tainted,” he drew little finger quotation marks in the air as he said the word, “at the slightest external influence.”
“Right,” Draco said, louder this time. “Potter, shield the civilians and protect the innocent, or whatever it is you do. I’m opening the box.”
Harry nodded, and Malfoy dropped back down so they were side by side, rocking gently into each other’s hands with their foreheads pressed together. It took him a moment to find a rhythm, with Malfoy grinding up against him, and it was doubly hard because he was lying on his right side and could only move his arm in tiny strokes. He switched to his left hand, and Malfoy’s head dropped back against the pillow, his mouth falling open with a gasp.
Malfoy had the grace to look guilty. “A little. I had to see for sure, and the best way to do that was to let it continue what it was doing.”
“Malfoy,” he said after they were well down the path into the Forest. “Are you going to stop sulking?”
“Because there’s no fucking point.” Potter’s voice sounded strange as he hissed the words—harsh and uneven. “It’s not going to make them stop.”
An owl whooshed through the open window, carrying a thick letter stamped with Blaise’s seal, and it was deeply important because Blaise had been researching the final reparation for him, but Draco didn’t open it.
The sound of excited children screaming surrounded them, piercing Draco’s ear drums. He climbed over the waist-high barrier separating the Quidditch pitch from the stands and crossed the field to where Harry was waiting.
Draco’s eyes rolled heavenward. “What have I got myself into?” he muttered under his breath, and then he was there, filling the void he’d created inside Harry with himself.
Draco gaped after him indignantly. He was just about to insist Potter regain any manners he had once possessed, when he noticed that Potter was wearing the same clothing as yesterday. He frowned, wondering how to broach the question—or what the question might even be—but the workroom door was already banging shut, leaving him alone.
“Bite me.” Draco groaned and rubbed his temple. “Fine. Look. Would it make you feel better if we agreed to one more session, just to alleviate any doubts, and then we opened it straight after? If you promise you’re not going to resort to name calling, I’ll even let us do it now.”
Draco grabbed his hand and all but dragged him back down the path. They tried to look inconspicuous as they passed back through the front doors, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure they managed it. He was thankful no one was around to see.
“Why not?” Malfoy’s calm demeanour snapped, and for a second Harry saw through to the mild hystrionics that were slowly bubbling beneath.
“I thought it might be fun to spice things up a bit. Don’t you think?” He pushes Harry back down onto the bed.
The sun has crept high over their heads as they sit out on Draco’s balcony. The past few days have been spent sight-seeing and sunbaking down on the beach, but they’ve decided to stay indoors today. Draco’s nose is threatening a pink tinge, and even Harry is sleepier than usual from the excessive sun he’s seen. He stretches out in his deck chair and adjusts his unbuttoned, pink Hawaiian shirt so that his chest can get a nice dose of morning sun before it becomes too strong.
“That’s right,” Pansy added, smirking at the two of them over the top of her wine glass. “You know, I was only joking when I made that bet, but this is just too good. Well, I wasn’t joking, I was drunk. But now, I’m neither!” She smiled brightly at them. “I hereby declare this a genuine bet.” She leaned across the table and grabbed each of their hands and shook them. “If you two genuinely fall into a real, honest, happy, mature relationship, I will buy you that stupid dinner at
Potter straightened up and took the man’s hand, smiling politely. “Of course. Good to meet you, Miles.”
Everything faded away—the club, his friends, the war—until all he could see were charcoal eyes staring into his.
“Yeah,” Harry said slowly, watching as Ron crossed his arms over his chest, glaring mutinously at Hermione who had walked off in exasperation. “I don’t know about that, actually.”
Images assault Harry’s mind: confused reporters insisting they heard opposing facts from the source himself; outrageous and clearly doctored photos of Harry getting tattoos on his bum right before a swimwear photoshoot that reveals the photos were real; multiple eye-witness reports that Harry fought a shark and lived.
“Aah, there’s my Slytherin boy.” Pansy reached across the table to pat Draco’s hand affectionately. “I knew you hadn’t gone far.”
Harry heard a faint snort behind him, but when he turned around the only person in sight was Malfoy, and he was looking straight ahead with a bored expression.
“Yes, well, it’s obviously a touch stronger than expected, isn’t it?” Draco snapped. “How’s your head?”
The warmth of the Leaky settled over him in a burst of colour and sound the second he opened the door, and he managed to slow down enough to pass as a normal person instead of the increasing wreck he was becoming. Unfortunately, he hadn’t made it more than five steps towards the back entrance when he heard his name being called, and all illusions of a quiet night of sulking at
Potter’s breath was ragged. “You’re not going to defend yourself?” The words sounded almost like a plea.
He honed in on the centre of the curse, grappling it with a brutish spell that he normally reserved for sluggish psychical curses that presented no danger of explosion. But sometimes, you really just needed to hit something.
Harry cast a glance at Malfoy, expecting to find him sneering or on the verge of a nasty remark. Instead, he was just as pale as when he’d first opened the door to see Harry, and from the look on his face, he didn’t find it very funny at all.
He didn’t bother waiting for a response and stomped off to his room. The door slammed behind him, and his head
“How can you stand it?” Weasley sat forward on the chaise, elbows propped on his knees and a deep frown on his face.
Hypothetically, if someone wrote you a letter saying that "the only reason they would stay in England would be because of you”, and that they “wish they’d been brave enough to talk to you earlier”, and then left the country, and then (after you followed them to France) told you to piss off and go home, which part would you believe? Hypothetically.
(Of course you should go. Childhood leaves a mark on us all in the most personal of ways—if someone shares that with you, it is an honour.)
“Why didn’t you clue into the prophecy when you knew I was the Veela?” he snapped. “You’re meant to be the smart one, these days.”
“I didn’t mean lonely.” Potter shook his head. “I meant you aren’t surrounded by cronies. That sort of… defined you at Hogwarts. You were the head of a pack of idiots. Even when you were alone you were… part of something else. A thought that didn’t belong to you. But here, you’re just you.” He shrugged. “I like you better this way.”
Harry felt him turn so that he was looking at Harry, breath ghosting across his cheek. He swallowed and continued to look at the ceiling.
Malfoy’s veneer broke, and Harry saw a glimpse of what was beneath: surprise, warmth, desire. Perhaps something else, hidden deep behind the others.
He felt again that overwhelming certainty that no one in the school knew how he felt, that he was alone, completely alone. He felt the cool grip of the sink beneath his fingers and thought about how he had never been offered a turning point, and even if one came now, it was too late. He had been led down this path from birth, and by the time he had realised how to think for himself it had been too late. No one had cared enough to question it, to think of a way to offer a child a solution that hadn’t meant disowning his family and everything he loved. No one had cared enough to try.
Malfoy made a noise—shocked, a little awed. His eyes were wide, a tinge of pink rising on his cheeks.
“Brilliant!” Harry enthused. “Did you see Arnold? He’s the youngest of the lot and he’s already got the hang of the wordless ‘up’ command. I’ll have to get him to partner up with Emily and see if he can explain the difference in a way that works for her. She might go better wordless than verbal.” He stowed the brooms away and turned back to grab the second pile off Draco.
“All right,” Draco said carefully after he’d weighed up all the thousands of ways this could go wrong. “You’ll be my anchor?”
Draco’s stomach sank. He was getting close to something, and with each passing second all he wanted to do was run. But he’d come this far.
“Draco and I both had appointments with investors,” Pansy said, propping her chin on her hand and regarding Harry with an expression that made Draco deeply concerned. “So, Potter, did you and Draco kiss and make up last night?”
Draco pulled out his notebook and scanned it with surprise. “We found a lot,” he said, eyes widening. “In fact, I think we don’t have too much more to analyse. There’s a note here too. It says—”
As he felt the familiar stirrings of an old obsession, he wondered if he had forced himself to forget.
I know that Hermione says I’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon or whatever, but honestly, have you met her? She Obliviated her parents and sent them to Australia! Don’t get me wrong: I love her to bits, and that was definitely the right thing to do. But… I couldn’t have done it.
Oh, Harry, I’m sorry. Maybe you should just come home? It’s not like you and Malfoy were ever friends. Honestly, I’m not sure why you’re surprised that he’s stringing you along. Why are you even bothering? You have enough on your plate…
Potter rounded on him so quickly he took a step backward. There was a fire in his eyes that Draco had never seen before. It wasn’t like the righteous fury of his teenage years; it was bitter and angry and achingly familiar.
That was where he suspected she was. Not literally, but in the nebulous, other-worldly sense with which he had always wished to disappear from the Dursleys.
that statistics show these families to be at a far greater risk, and I know that you’ve used every appropriate method to ensure selection of entry to the program is based on merit rather than sweeping generalisations. But if you want to introduce a program based on a system of equity, you must
Draco started moving, short, rocking thrusts that he built up to long, languid ones. Faster than he’d been expecting, his perception of weirdness turned into something else that felt pleasant, like he could sustain himself on Draco’s gentle movements forever if he wanted.
Draco fought back the surge of anger that threatened to overwhelm him and struggled to view things from Granger’s perspective. He knew she meant well and wasn’t an idiot; he just had to remind himself that they viewed things a little differently.
“They’re allowed to hug you now,” Malfoy pointed out, like a sunrise, like a clock sounding one minute past midnight. His voice was softer than Harry imagined it could be, usually all shrill and sharp edges. “But for what it’s worth, I’m sorry your Muggles were the kind my parents justified their existence with.” The words were halting and awkward, an apology for more than one thing.
“Wow,” Harry said what felt like an eternity later, stretched out beside Malfoy. “So that’s the prostate.”
to open the gate before now. I sent a Patronus for the research because I knew I’d likely end up straight back here. And I was right: I need feathers. So I thought I’d go round the lane and get any that had drifted over the back, but it wouldn’t open.”
Draco laughs and pulls him into a slow kiss, their tongues sliding lazily together. “But you like me now.”
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed how you look at him lately,” she said finally. “It’s like you’ve never seen him before, even in the six years we’ve all been friends.”
He let Malfoy lead him onto the dance floor and draw him close, their bodies moving together. The music was wild, vibrant, but Malfoy slowed them right down until they had transformed the song into something else entirely. The obnoxious melody still rang out over the top, but they weren’t moving to that, they were dancing to some other undercurrent instead.
Draco stared at Blaise, unable to form coherent thoughts. It was as if the room had suddenly darkened, the sun hidden by clouds and the birds falling silent to allow Blaise’s words the weight they deserved. He felt powerless to turn away from the look on Blaise’s face, the quiet promise in his words. For the first time in weeks, he felt a tiny part of the burden he was carrying float away. Whatever happened, Blaise knew the truth. He could always come to Blaise.
Potter’s lips pressed tight with rage. “You’re a such a spoiled brat—why am I even surprised that your go-to assumption is that I must be insane?” He drew finger quotes in the air as he said the word, glaring at Draco like he was scum. “Have you ever thought to ask?”
For a moment, Draco stopped breathing, but then Potter drew his hand out again, bringing a small pendant with it and holding it up so it was gently swinging from the black cord around Potter’s neck.
This was not fair. This was unjust. This was… This was… bloody sexy, if Draco was honest with himself, and that just made him madder.
Harry expected to feel nostalgia when he walked through the doors of the Great Hall at Hogwarts, but instead he just felt depressed. It rose up through the bottom of his stomach, catching in his throat like a howl, and on upward to rest in his skull. A looming cloud trapped by bone.
“You will keep your thoughts to yourself,” Lucius snapped. “The Dark Lord does not appreciate the misguided gossip of those who cannot understand. We will not fuel it.”
An indignant shriek from upstairs had them both turning and breaking into as quiet a run as they could manage.
Harry frowned, sitting up, too, suddenly very aware that they were both naked with their cocks still out. He pulled the comforter over his lap self-consciously. Malfoy, watching him, raised a pale eyebrow as if to say,
He stood and closed the distance between them, shoving his hands awkwardly into his pockets. He noticed Potter did the same.
Draco’s lips curve slowly into a smile, and then both hands disappear from Harry’s chest and reappear on his hips, fingers curling beneath his shorts and pulling them over his thighs.
His heart thumped in his chest, making him feel light-headed. He couldn’t believe he was actually asking this, saying the words out loud.
It was odd. And the more Harry thought about it, the more pissed off he got. What right did Malfoy have to take this tragedy so casually? Just because he didn’t have anyone to care about. Just because he wasn’t personally affected.
Harry shook his head, and Draco realised suddenly how pale his face had grown. “What did the Veela Curse say again? Do you remember?”
“Er,” he said, trying to think how to ask and feeling his cheeks flame at the realisation of just how stupid he’d been.
Harry was surprised so many of them had returned—it was almost like eighth year all over again. Except, eighth year had passed in something like a haze: too many people had still been in mourning clothes, their eyes red-rimmed each day at breakfast. Harry wasn’t sure how he passed his exams; he couldn’t remember much about the year at all. He thought Malfoy had tried to speak to him once or twice, but Harry had told him to piss off, and Malfoy had gone, just like that.
Malfoy dropped his head lower until he was mouthing at Harry’s top button. Then, with a faint pop, he pulled it open with his teeth.
They’d been stuck on each other for so long, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to give up this side of Malfoy after so short a time. It was reassuring to know he felt the same way. The last of the anxiety he’d been holding over officially starting something with him faded away with Malfoy’s admission.
“It…” Harry began, and he wasn’t even sure what he was saying. He kept saying it anyway. “It shouldn’t matter in here, right? I mean, we get quarantined anyway, after.” He wasn’t making sense. Worse—he wasn’t making sense, and he was
Malfoy looked up at him like he was a total idiot. “We said ‘no strings’, Potter,” he said incredulously. “This is… this is a
The words held amusement, but no malice. It was like the war had sucked all of the hate out of him and left someone new in its place. Bizarrely, Harry found himself hoping some of Malfoy’s bite still remained.
He always thought that love would feel like fireworks and sex. And it does, but it also feels like a tiny candle burning gently inside his chest, and the littlest things make it burn the brightest. It’s the sight of Draco resting on the couch in a bathrobe and warm socks; it’s the concentration on his brow as he reads one of his potions journals; and it’s the sound of his quiet movements in the kitchen as he prepares their breakfast. Harry never thought those things would be so important to him, and yet they’re the parts of his life he treasures the most.
Nonetheless, he was forced to agree. They had to do something, and the available options seemed fewer each time.
Draco felt the smile spreading across his face, slow and bright and impossible to contain. He reached slowly, deliberately to the inner pocket of his jacket, his fingers brushing against the tiny box hidden there. He watched as Harry’s eyes followed the movement and widened.
A noise came from the shop—George’s laughter, warm and bright and entirely incongruous to everything Draco felt right now—and Potter stepped back. The expression on his face faded, replaced by the shutters that Draco was becoming increasingly familiar with.
As the knowledge hit him, vague recollections of past dreams entered his mind. They were so blurred he couldn’t distinguish them from an ordinary nightmare—nothing out of the ordinary for Draco’s sleep. But their frequency—and his obliviousness to them—only supported the uncomfortable truth settling in his mind.
Afterwards, he lay panting, staring blankly at the canopy of the bed while Harry removed his fingers, stripped out of his pants in record time and pulled at his cock until he was coming, too.
Stacy’s mum had been a little more nervous, confiding to Harry that she was mildly terrified that something would explode with glitter and she wouldn’t be able to think of a believable lie quick enough. But it had gone as smooth as possible. All four children had occasionally broken up into fits of giggles that left the other kids bewildered—particularly when one of the parents had commented on the old-fashioned broom tucked into the corner of the kitchen—but that was it.
Potter turned away. “I don’t know how we’d ever know,” he said flatly. Then he huffed a laugh, low and humourless. “The dreams are getting worse.”
“At first, we thought you had an elaborate scheme going,” Pansy said, her eyes fixed on Draco. “But there were too many details that you couldn’t have faked.”
Did Draco like the man he’d become? It was an odd thought, one that had never felt relevant before. Who cared what he had become? It was his past that defined him.
“Draco, why don’t you tell everyone why you picked that tie you were wearing earlier?” Pansy asked, giving Draco a sweet smile.
“How do you like it?” Potter repeated Draco’s question back to him, gaze steady as he watched Draco’s reaction.
But Potter didn’t let him. He met the feverish desire of Draco’s lips with slow, deep kisses, pulling Draco down into the slow, intoxicating swell of emotion he was trying to avoid. With a whimper, he stopped trying to escape it and just gave in. Slowly, Potter stepped him backward, leading him from the kitchen to the bedroom across the hall.
He handed Potter the two potions he’d prepared with the ingredients from this morning, held his own glass up in a mocking salute, and drained them both in quick succession. The first one—the Chameleon potion—wasn’t too bad, but the Transition Potion tasted like pig swill. He closed his eyes, trying not to choke on the flavour, and felt a hand come to rest on his shoulder, its owner staggering for balance.
Draco closed his eyes and breathed slowly. Potter was right, of course, but he didn’t know what else to do. “Just try it,” he whispered, still with his eyes closed. “Just try to say sorry.”
“May I just say, Mr. Potter, your proposal was outstanding. We’re more than happy to partner up with the Aurors in pursuit of such a charitable cause.”
They were closer than before, Draco leaning back against the sink and Potter propped on one hand beside him, almost caging him in. When had they moved?
They’d begun exploring their own and each others’ bodies more liberally since having decided to make a real, honest go of a relationship together. The only real difference now, though, was that instead of getting up and sticking to their own sides of the room immediately after, they’d discovered that staying on the same bed was actually quite an alright experience.
was raised?” He jabbed a finger towards the family in the corner, though he didn’t turn away from Draco. “Like that. Do you know what it’s like, to be called a freak when you let slip a little accidental magic? Do you know how fucking terrifying it is to think that maybe, maybe
He allowed himself to be pulled down to the floor, dropping to his knees, held up by a slow kiss and the sensation of strong hands sliding down and gripping his arse.
Draco followed the nurse down the hall, sterile white walls surrounding him and making his teeth ache. So much white; it was blinding. Before long, they arrived at a tiny, secluded room away from everything else. All Draco could think as he walked inside was how lonely it was.
Harry gapes in response; it’s all he can do. With Malfoy still clinging dazedly to Harry’s shirt, they make their escape from the beach.
Draco turned to Harry and found the open stance of his body an invitation, and he decided to accept.
This year, he was fairly certain her obsession had turned to bee-keeping, which Draco was at least seventy percent sure she had chosen mostly for shock value. Not that he’d tell her that, of course.
When Malfoy spoke, his breath danced across Harry’s skin. It almost felt like a kiss. Harry wondered what it meant that he wanted it to be.
“It was just meant to be exciting—a big explosion—and then the inhibitor was part of the original design. I thought I weakened it so it just made you a bit sleepy and more likely to open the box, but it must have revived.”
Harry was so surprised that he turned to face him without thinking, their noses bumping together and knocking his glasses askew. He pulled back and straightened them, and, in the process, noticed the way that Malfoy’s hands hovered awkwardly. He ended up settling them on his own hips, like he wasn’t sure what to do with his pants either. He felt a twinge of anxiety that he’d ruined everything.
Harry’s lips were soft, still tasting of the herbs of their shared dreamscape, and he kissed Draco like he wasn’t completely sure how. Not unskilled but cautious, slow, the Gryffindor in him subsiding as he waited for something Draco didn’t know how to recognise. So, he gave him all that he could and hoped it was enough, bringing his hands to twist in Harry’s hair, pushing him back against the table of orchids that wobbled a little in their pots, pressing their hips together and deepening the kiss until everything else faded away.
One of Draco’s hands started wandering up his chest, pausing to play with his nipples before continuing on to explore the sweaty planes of his chest and back down to his abdomen. Harry twitched and all of his muscles seemed to clench every time he hit upon a sensitive spot, of which there seemed to be many more than he remembered.
Granger stood up, wobbled a little, and tried to usher Potter out of his seat, but he only crossed his arms over his chest and glared up at her mulishly.
He shook his head, clearing away the thoughts that didn’t have a place right now. He would deal with them later—much, much later. Possibly never.
excited. I’ve never seen her show emotion like that before, it was disgustingly heart warming. She’s all I have in this stupid world, and she’s gone.”
The words caught on the air, changing it, changing them. Potter cleared his throat. “How does raising peacocks make amends for”—he waved his hand at the board—“all those families?”
He hadn’t been able to work out what she had done with the wand—it was an odd little movement he hadn’t seen before.
He set the instrument up carefully. If they were lucky, it would parse through the hex’s purpose to the intention behind it, and trace that intention to its source by morning. An intention could never be severed from the caster like a curse could; it was as much a part of them as the hex was.
It was a Friday night affair, which meant no expense had been spared. The entry was lined with tasteful garlands, and waiters emerged from every corner with a tray of drinks the moment you felt the slightest bit thirsty.
The arm on the balcony shifted, and their hands brushed together. Malfoy glanced down at their fingers and visibly swallowed.
At the sight of Ron lying unconscious on the floor, Draco forgot his irritation and switched immediately into work mode. He took one look at the exploded package—the one Ron had dropped onto the counter only moments before—then covered it in a number of protective and diagnostic charms.
The foyer was empty when he arrived, the marble pillars looming around him and making him feel strangely lonely. The lights weren’t even on. He’d just found a corner to wait in when a noise from the entrance made him turn. Potter stood there, illuminated by the soft light of the setting sun behind him. There was something off about his expression, but Draco couldn’t see it well enough to figure out what it was.
After a moment of silence, Potter gave himself a little shake. “Did you listen to the match last week?”
Draco knew it was the alcohol—he could see it in the way Potter’s eyes were faintly glassy, and how they lingered on him far longer than normal—but when Potter’s gaze drifted along Draco’s body, pausing at the open button at the top of his shirt before dropping lower still, he couldn’t help but shiver. He only hoped it was dark enough to hide the rising flush on his cheeks.
“You’re sure you have the lubricant?” His nerves were getting the better of him. He’d read and reread the chapter in
“We didn’t do enough,” Granger said, a sad edge to her words. “I know what you’re saying—that it’s understandable and everything, but I still wish we’d done more.”
It must have been a by-product of visiting the Manor—his childhood home—that was all. He’d been lost in his memories once already today; his body had just decided to take that one step further.
“Well I didn’t bloody know you were Veela,” Potter snapped. “And I thought it was my magic, all right? I’ve been studying this prophecy for years, and dreamscapes too, and they’re mostly metaphorical, for Merlin’s sake. I thought my dream meant I accepted the creature magic from your wand, and the curse was just another hurdle getting in the way.”
“It wants to kill you, you giant twat,” Draco snarled, fighting the urge to hunt. His vision was turning red at the edges.
It hit Draco then, in that way that only nighttime epiphanies could. He didn’t quite have the words yet, but the feeling was there, rising like an inexorable tide in his chest. A horrible nausea began in his stomach, coursing up through his throat until he thought he might vomit. Potter didn’t see himself how other people saw him. He thought he deserved the stalkers, the weirdos.
Draco was surprised for a moment by his seriousness, though when he thought about it there was no reason to be. Weasley had always had a vicious honorable streak.
“Not exactly,” Draco said, feeling a little foolish in light of what he was undoubtedly intruding on. “I guess I just wanted to apologise.”
He didn’t step into the corridor. A part of him recognised it was all very childish, but he didn’t seem to possess the ability to change it.
One thing Draco did know was that their time was running out, and if the curse managed to properly identify them as intruders, it would all be over.
He clutched at Harry’s hair, riding out the waves and thrusting as gently as he could manage. Then, Harry pulled away and spat onto the floor, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and smiling up at him. Before he could speak, Draco pulled him upwards and guided him back to the bench behind him. Still warm from the afterglow, he dropped to the ground and settled himself between Harry’s spread thighs.
“And I didn’t win the war, Malfoy. I died.” He laughed again, but it wasn’t like before. It sounded normal, the way he did when they were laughing together with Pansy and Granger and Weasley. Somehow, that was far, far worse. “I died, and it was the biggest accomplishment of my entire life.”
Harry smacked him lightly. “That I’m really glad we decided to do this together. I wouldn’t have wanted to explore this with anyone else.”
The door to the office where they are having their weekly meeting bursts open, and, as if summoned by Harry’s thoughts, Draco bursts in. For a moment, Harry hopes. He hopes and hopes and hopes, and he knows it’s written on his face, and he knows he’s a right git for it, but he can’t help himself. It’s who he is.
Potter’s eyes met his, and for a moment, Draco thought the firelight was reflected in them. Then he realised the colour was wrong: blue instead of red. The sapphire flames licked Potter’s eyelashes, darting up his hairline and into the ether. They vanished, but the answering call flickered from Draco’s heart—a pounding drum of heat and fire and longing.
Avian blood born by a human required an avian conduit for its magic to be fully expressed. Veela hair would have worked, too, of course, but Draco’s great, great, great grandfather found something better. A flock of birds raised alongside Malfoy heirs for generation upon generation, soaking in their magic, feeding it back to the land they lived off. Connecting witch and wizard to the magic of the earth in a way few understood or remembered.
“Okay, I think you’re ready,” Harry finally said, and when he pulled his hand away, it was torturous for both of them.
“I thought the biggest part about all of this would be the sex itself,” he went on. “It sounded like such a big deal, the way everyone would talk about it, and our overly-loud neighbours. I thought there was something huge that I was missing out on, and that when I got there, it would all make sense. And maybe that’s how it is for other people, I don’t know, but I
“Well. Okay, then. As long as you’re happy. All we want is you to be happy, mate,” Ron said, and then, to himself, like he still couldn’t believe it, despite them sitting right there, on the other end of the sofa: “
Draco had always hated the smell of St Mungo’s. It was worse in the actual rooms; something about the spell residue and stench of varying ailments and curses combined together to produce something potent and raw. It made him think of Aunt Bellatrix, which came of no real surprise but still sent waves of nausea running through him every time.
I used to talk to Charlie a lot, though, when I was younger. It was kind of shit, being the youngest bloke of six, you know? I’d get really mad over things, and there was no way to let it out because Fred and George would just laugh at me, Percy wouldn’t listen, and Bill wasn’t there. Mum and Dad never had any time for it either—not because they didn’t care. Just because there was no time. So, I’d talk to Charlie, and he helped me figure out how to say things that I didn’t know how to say or didn’t want to say (at first). Because he’d just listen.
Then, he turned around and pushed his way through the crowd to the front door. It was freezing outside, and a light snow had started to fall. Potter was nowhere in sight, but they had planned to meet back at Draco’s place, so that was no surprise. With only a small amount of trepidation, he turned on his heel and Apparated away.
Before he could think of a way to take the words back, the room around them began to fade, distorting into a mess of grey and white streaks that eventually gave way to brown floorboards.
“Even just these last couple of weeks,” he continued quietly, “since you saw us at the party, I’m noticing new things every day. We’re seeing each other more and more—keeping up appearances—and I just… It’s driving me crazy.”
They decided that Potter should be the one to create the echo, since he seemed to have the most experience with it for reasons unknown to Draco. He didn’t really care; it suited him. He was far too distracted running his fingers across the mark on his neck to be able to think about spells and echoes and cursed items that never did what you bloody wanted them to.
Something strange appeared in Malfoy’s expression, and when he opened his mouth to speak, Harry found he was holding his breath to hear what came next.
Draco sighed and called in his pinboard, removing the mark he’d made against the Stevenses. If his father was paying for their transgressions against the Stevenses, then Draco couldn’t be. And now that he was more sober, it seemed an odd choice for a Veela Curse.
“Are you always so loud?” he asks, incredulous. “I never—” he breaks off and shakes his head, and for a moment, Harry is confused. This doesn’t fit his day dream.
For a second, the strange expression from earlier is back on Draco’s face, and this time Harry knows he isn’t imagining it.
“It’s after midnight,” he said lightly, going by no obvious medium but the stars. “Guess I’ll try the gate. If it’s going to open at all, it will be now.”
“If I fuck you here,” Potter murmured conversationally, “what do you think our bodies are doing back in your workroom?”
He’d written exactly one letter to Potter and received one in response. He’d asked Potter to meet him at the lake on Saturday, and Potter had said yes.
In a rousing show of fortitude, Draco’s hands moved through the expected etiquette of preparing tea for his guest, despite their intense urge to strangle him instead.
Potter’s eyes met his through the crowd, and he felt a jolt of something uncertain race through him, like maybe he was meant to be there with him. He was hit again by the strange thought that there was something he and Potter knew, something that was theirs alone, but he just couldn’t quite grasp a hold of it.
It was amazing. London stretched out before them, all bright lights and cars as small as toys. The city noise drifted up on a warm breeze that rattled through their hair, making it whip around their faces and back. But the most entrancing part of the view was sitting right beside him.
Which left the Veela Curse. Enacted as revenge for interfering with a Veela nest, the enraged mother could curse the invader with an appropriate mate.
“A curse that’s waited ten years,” Blaise said cryptically. “Surely you’re not that stupid. I’d have to write to the Ministry if you were—tell them their Unspeakables had fallen into ill repute.”
The elastic of his boxers snapped against his knuckles; he hadn’t pulled them all the way down. He wondered if Malfoy could even really see what he was doing, and then he wondered whether he wanted him to or not. What if Malfoy didn’t like what he saw?
His head snapped up in shock, and when his eyes met Malfoy’s he forgot how to speak. The anger had dropped away from Malfoy’s face, and what was left was a calm, resigned expression that Harry didn’t recognise.
Potter raise his eyebrows in question, and it was like the very air of the room had changed. It was tinged with that same kind of visceral awareness that came right before a storm, like the earth was holding its breath. Draco carefully exhaled, knowing that the end was already inevitable. Even if he could return to the start and look for the signs, he wouldn’t stop this.
With a little surge of Gryffindor bravery, he leaned up and kissed him. He felt Malfoy give a small jolt of surprise, and then his arms were coming around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer. Their lips parted, and Harry felt a rush of something in his chest, perhaps surprise that they had gotten this far without hexing each other. Whatever it was, it was warm and bright, and he was delighted that his madness had led them here, to this moment.
It was, he decided, a little messy, and he wasn’t sure he had enough room to move, though from the sounds he was making, Malfoy wasn’t complaining.
Draco’s stomach did a little flip for no reason that he could identify, but outwardly he didn’t move a muscle. After a moment, he asked, “Can we?”
The sounds of the club faded around them, giving way to the intoxicating thrall of sweat and a bassline that thudded somewhere in their chest. Malfoy’s hands lifted up, playing with his hair, teasing him, and Harry responded by keeping his hands firmly to himself—teasing Malfoy in an entirely different way.
Something dark flashed in Potter’s eyes at the rejection, but it passed quickly. “Of course. I’ll see you there?”
“It’s dinnertime,” he said plainly, looking over Harry’s left shoulder. As he gawped in confusion, the muscles in Malfoy’s cheek jumped.
Blaise handed him a bit of paper with a slowly moving figure etched across a map. “Not at all. You can track their progress here. I insisted, since you never can trust those live postal services, in my mind. Potter, how’ve you been?”
He could see his own weariness reflected on all their faces, and he wanted to speak, to make sure Potter was all right, but he knew that this part wasn’t for him.
I’m writing this after admittedly one too many gin and tonics, which always leads me to become both more melancholy than usual and more honest—a terrible combination when it comes to you.
The fact that it allowed notes to be Vanished between Harry and Professor McGonagall, and food to be sent in by the house-elves, but not the house-elves themselves, was impossible.
He focused on the way Malfoy’s cock felt in his hand, trying to pay attention to the times when Malfoy’s grip would become loose and his mouth would open in ecstasy, so that he could do it again. It was difficult because it felt like every part of his being was centered on the hand around his cock and the careful way that Malfoy was stroking him.
Something broken and rotting twisted in Potter’s expression, and he stumbled to a halt. “If I forgive you, what does that say about me?” he gritted out.
,” Draco snarled, continuing before he could be interrupted. “He likely has an inhibitor—I left a note in my book. Can you get us into his room?”
Draco paused for a beat in surprise before falling into the topic with enthusiasm. By the time they’d finished talking, they’d made it around the lake three times. Draco checked his watch. It was lunch time, but he didn’t want to push this. It was still so new.
“Eggs,” Draco agreed, laughing again. “And toilet paper, and whatever else they levitate up to my second-story window. This is ingenious. I can just hide behind the curtain and watch.”
He held off drinking for the moment, instead watching the way Potter downed an entire glass of hundred-year-old mead in less than three seconds.
He had to turn away from the look in Potter’s eyes, unable to comprehend exactly what he might be seeing—too scared that he was only seeing what he hoped for. He pulled out his notebook and wrote a message to himself:
Potter shrugged, staring down into his tumbler of scotch. “Can’t, really. Just trying to stop it where I can.”
They managed to flag down a Healer and express enough urgency that the Healer ran off immediately with the message. But that meant that all there was left to do was wait, and the atmosphere between the two of them was becoming increasingly stilted.
However, the faster Lucius deteriorated, the less time Draco had to make his final two—now one, thanks to the curse—reparations. Creatures of fate and family. His fate was tied to his family, and his family to his fate. If he was fast enough, perhaps the son could save the father.
Draco’s stomach sank. Of all the things Potter could say to him. Of all the mean-spirited, ill-willed, rigid-minded…
The fire had lowered to a dull glow, more heat than light at this time of the night. It flickered across the living room, sending long shadows dancing around him. After a moment, Draco screwed up the paper, sprinkled it with Floo powder, and lobbed it into the fire while muttering Potter’s address.
“Only what we want,” Malfoy agreed readily, and Harry felt the beginnings of a smile creep onto his face.
He pulled away, leaning back against the table to catch his breath. Harry straightened up and spelled himself clean.
“Me?” Potter asked, incredulous. “You won’t even let me try to explain what I meant! I had one moment of weakness where I lashed out, which is hardly unusual for us, and—”
“Skeeter thinks the two of you are dating!” Weasley finally spat out, shoving the paper across the table to them and then joining Granger on the floor.
“It was addressed to me, and I’m opening it. Now, do what you do best, Harry, and make sure no one dies.”
“I do,” Malfoy said, the words tumbling out in his rush to correct Harry. He shoved his hair back from his forehead, the gesture making him look uncharacteristically messy and unsure. “But I want to enjoy it, Potter, and as of yet I have no frame of reference for what that would feel like.” He paused, and then, looking faintly disgusted with himself, added, “And, oddly enough, part of that enjoyment means that you have to feel good as well.””
He only said that one word, but it was enough. Draco covered his face with his other hand, squeezing his eyes shut against tears that were threatening to fall. He didn’t even know why he was crying.
Draco smiled a little at the memory of the phrase. It had been years since he’d heard it. Somehow now, he thought he understood it.
Draco remembered, suddenly, that Potter had walked into the forest to die once, simply because Fate had deemed he should. For the greater good, Harry Potter could give his life and save the world, and so he had. And now, for the greater good of forgiveness and mercy, he could forgive a Malfoy, offer his hand, and save both their lives.
He froze for several seconds, staring at the scene, before Malfoy turned to him and he realised he was holding several pairs of clean boxers. Flushing, he dropped them on the floor and walked over to the doorway.
Through the glass, Alan could be seen perched at the very top of the water fountain. The morning sun caught his feathers, highlighting their rainbow-like radiance, shadows dappling as the wind ruffled. With a shimmer, Alan fluffed out his tail in proud formation, each feather a work of art as he displayed himself for their viewing pleasure. An owl swooped above him, taunting the peacock as was its weekly ritual, and dropped a letter from his mother on the kitchen window sill. He didn’t move to collect it; he had no burning desire to read the contents, knowing, as he did, that the update would not be good. It never was.
He could still see Potter moving, a dark shape behind him, the two of them in shadow. Draco’s cock was hard, so hard, and he didn’t even care anymore about trying to keep it away from the rough slide of the brick wall. The pain was grounding, matched by the rough thrusts of Potter behind him. His arse was so full, Potter’s cock dragging over the sweet spot inside him until he could hardly feel anything else.
And if those boundaries were to tell Draco to fuck right off, that was what he would do. But before he left he would made it clear that Potter only had to say the word—there was
I wish I’d had the bravery to talk to you when it would have made the most difference, but it’s been too long now. I’ve burned too many bridges, and life isn’t so easily turned around. However, although it makes no difference to my life anymore, I want you to know how thankful I am for everything you have ever done for me—for all of us. Particularly as I never deserved any of it.
“Draco. Take it off, right now. Please.” He is begging—nothing like the usual flushed pleas the two of them gladly trade—and it’s not only his sanity that is slipping away, but everything that was still tying him to Draco.
“Shall I come back later?” he asked, his voice full of genuine warmth as he smiled at the two of them.
The first words that came out of Draco’s mouth were, “It’s not that kind of Sanctuary, imbecile.” And then he’d realised this was actually quite serious, blast it all, and tugged the feverish and delusional man inside. The second words he uttered were along the lines of
“I dunno,” he said finally, sounding a bit surprised. “I mean, I thought it’d be funny, yeah. And I guess the thought of how much work it’s going to take doesn’t bother me?”
“You know, though,” Malfoy drawled, the words slow and thoughtful. “It doesn’t mean that you have to wait, just because I am.”
“So why didn’t you pick the Auror program, Harry?” Seamus asked, taking a swig from an unlabelled bottle of brown liquid and passing it over. “I thought you’d be dead set on it.”
Like sinking into a familiar jacket, Draco found his blood boiling in response. “I know you’ve allegedly got a brain in there,” he snapped, vicious and cutting, “so try to use it. This curse can only end once the transgressor has paid for their sins.”
It was like nothing he’d ever experienced before. Masturbating and even fingering had been fantastic, but the feeling was wholly different from this.
Draco snorted, some of the tension visibly seeping away. “It’s not your birthday anymore. Don’t be daft.”
It was pure coincidence that he looked at Potter just before the room faded away. There was no noise to alert him, no sensation of being watched, just a chance turn of the head for no reason at all. As their eyes met, Draco was thrown by the depth of longing he saw there, the way that Potter’s eyes seemed to hold sadness and fear and want with the same fierceness that they used to hold nerve and fortitude.
He turned to Potter and saw him already holding the inhibitor in his palm, a fierce determination in his eyes.
He kept a careful distance from Harry, which was nothing new. His hands were shoved into his pockets, casual and relaxed, as if he had no great desire to touch Harry, while Harry himself was filled with something hot and furious, something that reached inexorably for Draco, fighting to pull him near.
“Draco, can I have a word?” she asked quietly, and that caution in her voice, more than anything else, sent warning bells ringing in his head.
The answer was so free of duplicity, so honest and simple, that Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face. After a few seconds, Potter returned it—sleepy and soft around the edges.
I asked about the old tabby cat. The owners were delighted that someone remembered her. Her name was Pattenrond, and she was indeed the mother of Noirot. Pattenrond never liked guests, apparently. She’d always leave when someone came too close, so she must have loved you if she stayed asleep while you sat with her.
When he looked up from the table, he saw that Pansy was watching him. Her brow was furrowed, but he couldn’t tell if she had caught onto their act, or if she knew what he was thinking right now. It couldn’t be the latter; even he didn’t know that.
His breath hitched and for a moment he didn’t know how to respond. But they had come this far on a strange truce of openness and truth; why stop now?
It was the kind of party that used to have all the Gryffindors shuffling their feet and staring awkwardly at the artwork on the walls. But then Pansy had bridged the gap between them all and apologised for letting a moment of fear and weakness overwhelm her that night in the Great Hall. Potter, of course, forgave her immediately, and they’d all learned that night—after several drinks—that he truly had gone into the forest to die. Had died, in fact.
Like Umbridge, but somehow worse. I’ve never been able to look at cats the same after her,” Ron paused, face wrinkling as he swallowed. “And I live with Crookshanks.”
But the more Draco watched him, the more he wasn’t sure it was that simple. There were signs that it could be war flashbacks, but there also seemed to be something more—something that simmered below the surface in a way that the harsh, jolting reminders of a war didn’t tend to do.
Draco stared at him, unable to think what to say or to guess what might have happened to make Potter look like this. He gave up without trying and got to his feet. “Shall we?”
“Because Potter’s an idiot who still wears Gryffindor colours even though he’s twenty-four years old, and if he’s going to insist on being a twat then I’m going to remind him that Gryffindor isn’t the only house in existence,” Draco answered promptly.
Harry stared in wonder and met his pleased smile. His hair was tousled, so unlike his usual perfect composure, but there was something else, something more. The expression on his face—giddy, so free of its usual caution and filled instead with a simple sort of wonder—made his heart ache, and for the first time since they had begun this…
Harry cringed. He had no idea what he was saying. The whole point of it was that he hadn’t been thinking when he’d said it. He moved uncomfortably on the bed.
Harry’s face broke into a brilliant smile, and Draco leaned in to kiss him—a soft, chaste kiss that held the promise of many more.
Harry opened his mouth to snap something out—he didn’t know what—but the tone of Malfoy’s voice made him pause. Malfoy had always been highly strung, there was no doubt about it, but not like this. Right now, he seemed highly strung because he was nervous, because he was
“Wasn’t sure if I was on the wards,” Potter admitted, glancing up at him briefly before turning his attention back to cleaning.
“Definitely not,” Potter said, a bright smile stretching across his face. Then he cleared his throat, looking momentarily embarrassed. “I mean, I still want to get one over them all, you know?”
“What aren’t you telling me?” he asked through gritted teeth, mostly for two reasons. Firstly, because Potter
“Unspeakable tosspot?” Potter snorted, and Draco edged closer. “Is that the best you’ve got? You ought to be more worried about the uninhibited access I have to surveillance spells now, mate.”
Now that Malfoy was relaxed and mostly used to the feeling, Harry started trying different angles, feeling his way around for what he’d read about.
An unfamiliar face appeared by Draco’s side—bright eyes and lips stretched over white, white teeth into what was obviously meant to be a smile.
“I didn’t know soulmates felt like this,” Draco confessed once they’d pulled back from each other, still with his forehead pressed against Harry’s, the warm rush of their breath dancing across his skin.
“Worth the wait?” Draco asked as he rolled onto his back, his voice heavy with exhaustion and satisfaction.
“We don’t have to,” Potter said, his voice several notes lower than normal. “If you don’t like casual sex, just say the word and I’ll go back to work.”
Draco frowned. “You’re reminding me of the moment Veela blood takes hold,” he admitted. “That’s how puberty feels.”
Harry opened his eyes to find himself staring into the most inscrutable expression he’d ever seen. “What?” he snapped.
As the only wizard in Wiltshire possessing Veela blood, and possessing, too, a decades-long feud with the man in question, Draco doubted there was anyone who fit the bill more than he did. And, of course, he had been wondering when he would owe reparations to the Boy Who Lived.
The sensation of peace disappeared, and Draco was filled with the cold horror of knowing he had made an irreversible mistake.
Draco didn’t need the wire to unravel, but he did need to know where the layers were and what they did. He might not care about the Weasleys, but he couldn’t escape the image in the back of his mind of Ron stretched out on a hospital bed, unconscious while the unknown curse did Merlin-knows-what to his mind.
The polite chatter of the professors welcoming Malfoy filtered around him, and he focused on cutting into his desert, consuming it bite by bite. It wasn’t until someone began waving something in his face that he realised he was being spoken to.
He nearly said something. Nearly tore into the two of them, sitting so innocently across the table from him, but he held back. If he hadn’t, he would have ruined not only the friendships at the table, but the trust that he and Potter were slowly building—and that was too dear a price to pay, even for the satisfaction of knowing he was
“Potions,” he said flatly, his usual bored expression firmly in place. Then, something crossed his face and he pulled himself up a little straighter. “No one else is studying it here, of course, since Ilvermorny is hailed as the best for post-graduation Potions. But you can’t get fresh unicorn hair at Ilvermorny, and—” he broke off suddenly, as if he’d remembered his audience. “And I need that,” he finished, stilted.
What might the choices of a prophecy-child and a creature of fate amount to when they were finally allowed to make them?
It’s too much: the sounds Malfoy is making, the way his left hand grips Harry’s hip so hard he is sure there will be bruises afterward, the way his right hand slides, tantalisingly slow, along Harry’s slick cock. It is going to send him over the edge far sooner than he intends.
that Draco truly realised how much the mistakes of his past had come back to haunt him, would always come back to haunt him.
The wooden chest had a shiny inbuilt lock, and Draco wasn’t going anywhere near that for all the galleons in Gringotts. With a sigh, he checked the shields around the circle and left the room. When he found himself at the liquor cabinet, staring uselessly at the lock whose key was still somewhere behind the armoire, he swore and left the apartment for Diagon Alley. He couldn’t very well drink at home, not after tearing into Potter for it. He’d go and have a civilized drink with company at
For long moments, Draco didn’t speak. Potter’s face was white, and Draco thought he saw a twinge of regret pass across his features, but he didn’t care. All his secrets—somehow, Potter had read them. How had he got his hands on his journal?
“Good things can still always be better. Besides, don’t you want to know what it feels like with me fucking you and sucking you at the same time?”
“No need,” Draco said, standing up straight and ignoring the way the Aurors’ eyes raked all over his dishevelled appearance in surprise. “I’ll take the case.”
Once, his father would have reprimanded him for talking back so much, but not anymore. Now, he only settled further into his ramblings, staring into the fire. When he was called away, Draco thought nothing of it, and when the messenger came scurrying back to fetch Draco as well, he felt only the thick slide of dread at what might be to come.
The faint sound of voices from the back room told Draco that Potter was speaking to the Aurors, and he was surprised when George lowered his voice so as not to be heard.
Professor McGonagall’s tone almost sounded apologetic, but not quite. There was too much urgency in it, too much necessity. Harry didn’t even blame her.
Harry murmured an affirmation around his cock, the sound vibrating against him and making his knees go weak. The lockers rattled behind them in time with Draco’s thrusts, and when he looked down he could see Harry’s spare hand moving fast between his own legs.
She never had been one to mince words. Draco’s chest spiked in irritation; couldn’t she stop analysing everything for five seconds? They’d only just begun to put their plan into action, and she was already stomping all over it in six inch stilettos.
“No,” Draco breathed, shaking his head. “I passed fledgling stage in fifth year. After sixth year, no new symptoms should have shown themselves. Not unless—” He broke off, staring at Potter.
They fell into a strangely relaxed silence, both staring maudlin into their glasses. Mutual failure worked wonders for unity, sometimes.
He had hoped the package might contain a clue towards the nature of the curse, but it would seem it was only further mystery.
“Don’t be cheeky,” Draco reprimanded him, slapping his arse cheek with his free hand inserting his first finger at the same time. Harry yelped, and when he looked down, Draco was looking very pleased with himself.
distractedly and eyeballing some of the pictures. He looked up suddenly, and said, shrewdly, “You didn’t go to Granger for these, did you?”
Potter cleared his throat. “They keep bringing me back here, Malfoy.” His voice came out odd, all tight and strangled when Potter was normally explosive and sharp. “I’d wake up to a trail of feathers leading me out the door. I’d see them floating on the wind. My magic… it wants to be here. It has for years.”
“No.” Potter shook his head. “I mean the stuff from the war, yeah sure, that built up like you say. But the rest of it… I didn’t know what was underneath because I’ve never lived without it. I thought that was just
He spent the day fetching Malfoy what he needed for his experiments. As the hours passed by, Malfoy became increasingly focused, poised on the edge of a breakthrough. Harry almost held his breath, entranced in the strangest way by the concept that he wasn’t the hero this time.
The thought that Potter had returned and bought it, all because Draco had said he should, filled him with a surge of hope and wonder that should be downright illegal. It was useless getting so caught up on the small details—it was just an act, and Draco needed to remember that.
“Right. I’m going to grab something to eat, then.” Potter left them at the table and headed towards the sandwich display.
“And this thing between you and Malfoy… it’s serious?” Hermione asked hesitantly, like they were an arithmancy question that wasn’t making any sense, but somehow, impossibly, someone had written an answer that she couldn’t work out. It was quite flattering to be on the end of that look, actually.
The biting edge had returned to his voice, thank Merlin, and Potter seemed to notice it too. He climbed slowly to his feet. “New plan,” he said lightly, although there was a hardness to his jaw that Draco didn’t want to examine too closely, lest it reveal more than he wanted about the man he was indefinitely locked up with. “We work on this together. Let’s start from the beginning—do you have any texts I can read?”
“That’s because it’s not a rune,” Draco said quietly. His voice had taken on a faint, distant quality that he didn’t seem able to shake off. “There’s an old fairy tale—it has a few translations, but the most common one is called Sweetheart Roland. I won’t bore you with the details, but a witch sets out to murder her step-daughter, but the step-daughter foils her and runs away with her magic wand.”
hiding in a darkened corner. I had this corner prepared for couples, you know. There’s a spot right behind you that’s just perfect to use as a prop to push someone against while you ravish them.”
Around the other side of the table, Pansy, Granger, and Weasley were all testing the wine. Granger even had the menu laid out in front of her and a frown on her face as she took small sips and ran her finger down the options. None of them were looking over at Draco and Potter; they had a moment of privacy.
“My…” Potter’s hand hovered over his thighs for a moment, and Draco collected all his willpower not to take the piss once again. Then the hand moved higher, over his chest. “My heart.”
“What? Never mind. I’m assuming the pleasure is enough to provide the motivation itself. Or maybe it’s an organic confluence. Under the right circumstances with the right components, it just… happens.”
It was late, the lamp-light casting long shadows on the kitchen table between the two of them. Draco tried to ignore the way Potter’s posture had shifted, the way he seemed to hover on the edges of the darkness like it was something he was itching to sink into.
Only… why was the debt Fate called of him one that put Potter in harm’s way? The curse’s appearance had Fate’s name written all over it, but apart from saving Potter’s life by removing it, Draco couldn’t see how this was meant to benefit him. No, it had to be a debt owed to the Stevenses. But then, why was Potter caught up in it at all, particularly when Draco still owed him? His loose brain could make neither heads nor tails of the perplexing detail, so he temporarily ignored it.
The crowd parted and there he was—a solitary figure leaning against the side of a curtained alcove that led to a separate drawing room. Draco’s whole body relaxed at the sight of him, his lips curving into a soft smile of their own volition. It was disgusting. He shook his head—still unable to get the smile off his face—and walked over.
Draco was only seconds away from coming, the softness of Potter’s sheets having done wonders for the slow thrust of his hips into the mattress. He was intending to wait, to let Potter enjoy his orgasm, but a hand immediately gripped his and pulled him up higher, maneuvering him until he was sitting over Potter’s face and his cock was sliding into the waiting heat of a mouth. He gasped, forehead falling against the wall with a soft
Draco lifted a shoulder, picking up one of the pigmy puff toys and examining it. “Just doing a spot of shopping. You’re here on official Auror business? Or is it strictly civilian today?”
Merlin, the man may as well have told all of Diagon Alley that they were just faking it. A librarian passing by looked at them oddly but continued on without stopping, her trolley squeaking into the distance. This place wasn’t quite as hushed as the Hogwarts library, but Potter’s voice still travelled.
wrong, and there were times when you could have made a better decision, but you did all you could with the information that was available to you.”
Blaise ignored the dig and nodded sagely. “Yes, you did used to do that at the end of seventh year; I’d forgotten.”
The Veela tilted its head as it had once before, the memory slamming into Draco’s brain. “But you do not forgive him.”
“Why the fuck is my arm sticky?” Draco snapped, and then he saw the words printed onto his skin, smeared beneath his shirt cuffs.
the curse, and the cursed item was perfectly untouched under all Draco’s wards—how could they possibly be affected by it?
“I’m not saying I don’t want to do that, um, right now, but remind me again why we couldn’t talk about this in our room?”
Potter had called him Draco, and he couldn’t even appreciate it because the Veela in him was taking over. Tiny feathers had sprouted over the backs of his hands. The curse was transforming him into a fully-fledged Veela, ready to perform the final task the curse demanded of him.
He closed his eyes and focused on the spell. The final two mechanisms appeared to be linked, but they weren’t from any branch of curse magic Draco knew. It didn’t make sense, and not just because it was unknown. The simplest of Draco’s diagnostic spells searched for purpose and intent. The spell returned different colours according to the nature of the curse’s will—blue for pain, pink for control, orange for destruction—but he just kept getting green.
What are you playing at? I went to that stupid café and you never showed. Why won’t you just meet me?
“Finally acknowledging your dangerous volatility, then? Shall I sign you up for Alcoholics Anonymous next?” Draco smirked.
“I’m sorry for acting like a dick, er, out there.” He waved a hand vaguely. “I knew you didn’t mean anything by it. I think I was just latching onto an excuse to sulk.”
He didn’t think it was only flashbacks. He’d seen Potter that night, seen how he reacted to the memory of the most traumatic events of his life. Draco didn’t pretend to be an expert, but his gut was telling him something else was happening too.
It had been a while since he’d had a dream like that. Years. He’d almost forgotten about them; he’d had dreams like that starring roughly half of their year level after all.
The strangest thought hit Draco—he had missed this. There was always something about Potter that got under his skin in ways no one else could ever rival. Potter never backed down from him, never ignored him, and it made Draco feel like… like—like he took up space. As though he was real and he existed and the things he did were important.
Potter glanced at him sideways. “Well, they’ve got each other, don’t they?” he said with a shrug. “It’s different. Everything’s different, out in the real world. Away from Hogwarts.”
“I don’t care about my bloody journal,” Draco said in a rush, before clutching his head in confusion. “How is this even possible? Not even twenty-four hours ago, I remember feeling such complete and utter betrayal at what you revealed to me, and yet, only a day before
Those times were gone now. He trusted more easily, could interact with his emotions more freely. In some ways, he needed Eleanor less—and by needing her less, he was able to heal more, heal deeper than before.
His eyes fell on Potter and Draco, and they shared a grim look which removed all doubt from Draco’s mind that George wasn’t aware of the seriousness of the situation, even if he didn’t know the details.
“What the bloody fuck?” he said when he’d gathered his jaw off the floor. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Then she turned to Hermione, laughing at something she’d said and ignoring the two of them entirely.
Draco gaped at him. “After everything I know about the great Harry Potter,” he said slowly, “I really shouldn’t be surprised that you’ve made this about you, and yet.” He stalked off down the path, shaking his head. “It’s like Hogwarts all over again,” he said over his shoulder.
“You heard.” Malfoy wasn’t looking at him now; he was back to studying his hands, rubbing his palms slowly back and forth over each other.
“The curse has proven more difficult than expected,” he said finally. “Potter is going to assist me in getting to the root of it.”
And it had ignited Draco’s own jealousy, tearing at him until the mere thought of Potter entering this Veela’s territory made him want to kill. To rend flesh from bone until nothing was left behind. In a state like this, he didn’t care about breaking the curse.
“I always thought,” he said conversationally, “that I would end up in a nice, normal relationship where, at the hint of discussing our emotions, someone would dive for the smelling salts.”
Potter laughed humorlessly while Granger got that far-off look in her eye that suggested she was making Plans. “The stamping isn’t going so well. The incident was a series of attacks on some shops in that little Wizarding shopping district in Bath. They used illegal potions, which means they were smuggled in, and given how hard the Ministry has been focusing on
“I don’t understand it,” he said instead, after he’d sucked in a lungfull of air and counted to ten slowly. “How the hell do people have the energy for sex? I’m run bloody ragged just with my seminars and lectures, and we haven’t even
I’ll send you the best. You’re wearing a lot of yellow at the moment, aren’t you? I’ll ask the assistant what suits a yellow outfit.
He angled his fingers as directed, but it still took several seconds of searching until he finally found what might have been Malfoy’s prostate. When he touched it, Malfoy let out a startled sound, but it was only after he had been pressing against it for several seconds that he started to really respond.
When he steadied himself against the wall of his foyer, it took him a moment to discern the shadowed figure leaning against the stairs.
Draco had thought that whatever was going on with Potter was to do with the war, but this had started a long, long time before that. Draco didn’t even know where to begin.
