His hands shaking, Draco opened the envelope, and pulled out the letter.
He slowly draped the necklace around Draco’s neck, fumbling with the clasp. It looked
“Uh, hi. Sorry to just turn up… I tried to text you, but you didn’t, uh, yeah.”
Draco snorted. Robards and Potter looked at him quizzically, and he coughed in a lame attempt to hide his unprofessionalism.
Harry put out his hand.
"Malfoy. Have you finished your reports yet?" Hermione stood over him, looking distinctly annoyed that she had been designated the task of speaking to him.
“Draco, what-” Blaise began, but Draco had already disapparated.
Draco lay on the couch, staring at the ceiling. He hadn’t even tried getting to sleep, knowing it was pointless, and that even if he did manage to sleep, it would have been interrupted by nightmares.
They reached the training hall fairly quickly, and Hermione was somehow already there.
Draco’s voice was shrill, panicked. Harry immediately yelled, “Protego!” And Draco’s bolt of red light bounced off Harry’s shield, hitting the wall and leaving a small crater.”
“None of you are going anywhere.”
“Yeah, you too,” he managed to say as he was almost squeezed to death. Pansy let go, turned to give Draco a meaningful look that Harry couldn’t decipher, and walked off to take her seat.
“Thank Merlin,” Robards said with a sigh, running his hand through his hair, and completely ignoring Draco. “One of our other teams managed to capture one of those bastards, and he wouldn’t talk except to say that there was a ‘nasty surprise’ waiting at Malfoy Manor. It looks like he might have
Harry nodded, and followed her inside.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a worried look before sitting next to each other on the other sofa.
“Let’s go.”
as though this was a fucking autopsy, not a letter to her son.
Every other Slytherin student had been rejected.
And then they'd just ignored it all, chasing after the new lead.
“You are going to be the death of me, Potter,” Robards muttered. “Well, the situation is all sorted now, anyway…”
"I know. But when Voldemort was at large…" Amyra flinched slightly at his name, "I used to get these… visions… in my dreams. They were real, at first, until Voldemort started using them to manipulate me." Harry frowned, and took the cup of tea Amyra handed him. "There was one…"
Draco felt his body freeze as he placed his hand on the banister.
He pushed the thought out of his mind. "It doesn't matter. It's not like I have a choice. It's going to look very suspicious if I refuse to go and see him."
As they pulled up outside Draco’s flat, Draco turned to look at Ivan. “How many years ago was your village destroyed?”
Draco looked away, hiding his blush. “Nothing.”
“Please.”
Andromeda looked up from her plate at this point, and Draco thought for a moment that she was glaring at him, but the moment passed as soon as it had arrived.
There was a gentle knock at the door.
"Ronald, maybe if you actually helped instead of just standing there and making snide comments-"
“Don’t. It won’t solve anything,” Harry said, his heartbeat quickening.
Andromeda stood up. “Come here,” she said, stretching her arms out.
They stared at him blankly.
“Did I say that? Sounds way too smart for me.”
Draco flinched, and looked up, meeting Harry’s eyes.
been captured…”
“Alright,” she said, sitting on the armchair, “tell me everything.”
"I won't. What is it?"
“I’ve been there before, it’s not like other bars. Please, Draco?”
“Draco, please, don’t be too hard on him, he’s-”
And now, he was going to attend the funeral of Narcissa Malfoy, a woman he couldn’t have spoken to more than a couple of times - although, she had saved his life - a funeral which would also probably be full of ex-Death Eaters and Slytherins.
“Hey mate.”
“I’ll go,” Draco said suddenly, surprising Harry. Draco blushed when the three of them looked at him expectantly. “I mean, I don’t mind doing it alone. I know the place better than anyone else. I lived there, after all.”
Everyone at the table exclaimed.
“Yes, I’m… I’m fine…” Draco trailed off, surprised to feel tears on his face.
“Sorry. I’m fine, really. Just… work, you know?” Malfoy smiled, but Harry could tell he was hiding something.
Draco grinned. “Thanks.”
They sat down on the old couch in the living room, and a few minutes later, Dean and Neville walked in, followed by a very sheepish looking Ron. Harry stood up to hug each of them, followed by Hermione, who stopped awkwardly before Ron and settled for a wave.
"I want to be there. Of course I do. I'll try, Ginny, I really will, but I don't have control over how long this trip is going to be."
“Are you sure?”
“We almost got caught by the landlord when I took him for a walk. I had to duck around a corner and cast disillusionment charms.”
Draco was vaguely conscious of the chains unwrapping, and of his arms being grabbed, and of the terrible cold washing over him as Dementors accompanied him to a small cell.
“This is a very serious problem,” Robards began, “and as the Minister said, you must not tell anyone about this. You two are the most skilled out of all the trainees, so we will be doing a lot of the difficult field work. Our first job is to investigate past offenders who may have had something to do with this, or who may know something about this.” Robards paused, and then spoke in a quieter tone. “There is no evidence to suggest that this is… you know. Death Eaters. It’s most likely a couple of messed up people following his ideology. We’ll catch them soon enough.”
Walking, hand in hand with Scorpius, Draco beside him chatting about the muggle movie
Harry silently pleaded.
Théodore Nott fell to his knees. His eyes were wide and forlorn. His face was deathly white and he was visibly shaking. Blaise was frozen, teeth biting into his knuckles. Pansy was actively sobbing.

Draco threw his arms around Théo's neck, Theo did the same to Draco's waist and crushed him to his chest.
-"You hate your life don't you? You're not even sure it's yours. Has it ever been yours, Potter? Have you ever had an authentic thought? Have you ever done something without being manipulated to do it? Didn't you say when it all came out in the open during the trials that you were prophesied to defeat him? Your whole existence was planned out. Dumbledore left you unloved and uncared for so you'd follow him blindly when the time comes.

“I– It’s just, a really bad night, you know, and I was hoping you would– you would come down, eventually, and I know I shouldn’t have bothered you if you were actually sleeping well for once, but I didn’t know– what to do.” Draco’s eyes are wild and bright; as she talks, the lace on her sleeves flutters in an ephemeral echo of her frantic hands.
it. Without anything terrible happening, and without the world ending, and without getting immediately fired. He feels impossibly light, like he could simply float away if he stopped concentrating; even the late October chill seems unable to reach him on the walk home. He opens the door to the flat with a little flourish and nearly skips over the threshold, stopping short when he sees Harry standing in the middle of the living room.
“My darling,” Harry says again, unable to stop her smile.

“Do you think you need Dreamless Sleep?” Draco murmurs one night, smoothing Harry’s curls away from his sweaty forehead. He’s found Harry’s nightmares aren’t loud, nor violent; instead, he just shivers silently and wakes with tears streaming from his eyes. Draco isn’t quite sure if screaming would be better or worse.
“Oh god,” Draco moans as Harry licks a stripe up the underside of his cock. They’re sprawled across Draco’s couch, too needy to even make it to the bedroom. “Do that again.”
when you wake up, you idiot.”
Unable to help it, Harry shivers; Malfoy says her first name like she’s handling it with kid gloves. Soft and round and gentle.
“I did.” His voice is shaking.

Harry pokes Draco right in the arse, and Draco swats at him, unable to stop his helpless giggles. “Stop, you are the worst, the
“And–” Harry snorts. “You want crepes and open communication?”
“But we could be,” Harry whispers, and Draco falls quiet. “We could be, if… god, everything hurts, and I– I keep losing days to this terrible
“I know that I make you feel good,” Harry says softly.
I don’t pull just as much as you.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says quietly. “I–”
“Draco.” Harry reaches out to grab Draco’s wrists, squeezing hard. “Stop. I just can’t– this could really hurt you. I could really hurt you. With that. And what if you don’t like something, and I don’t know?”
The sound Harry makes when Draco’s lips meet his is like nothing Draco has ever heard, and he tucks it right into his heart for later, when his world will come crashing down around him. Harry’s mouth is so much softer than Draco expected, and
“Oh, yeah,
“I’m still gonna fuck you.”
“I’ll pick you up.”
“Draco–”
Yet here he is, frozen in panic while Harry lays beside him, tucking his chin against Draco’s shoulder. Draco startles as the soft material of the flannel touches his stomach, but as Harry starts to rub small circles he relaxes into the sensation. When Draco is sufficiently clean, Harry tosses the flannel onto his bedside table and nuzzles his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck.
at me.”
“Of course,” Draco says, but then blinks as something settles in his chest, reassured. “Oh. I– yes.”
Draco moves his mouth, but he’s forgotten words, he’s forgotten anything that isn’t being held tight in Harry’s hands. “Take me to bed,” he finally manages, clutching at Harry’s shoulders. “Take me to bed
Harry blinks, the light in his eyes still absent.
There is ice moving through his veins, and Draco doubles over with a gasp, wrapping his arms around himself as his body is wracked with shivers. He hears Harry make a pained sound over the rushing in his ears, then there’s hands gripping the back of his neck and he can breathe again. Warmth seeps through his skin from each of Harry’s fingertips, and he exhales shakily.
something Harry will ever tell him. Instead, Harry just judges Draco’s boyfriends very, very harshly, because he’s a bit jaded and Draco deserves the world.
“Come on. Come up here.” I need him inside me in every way, today. I need his cock in my mouth while my hole still flutters everytime I move. “Sit on my face. You’re gagging for it.”
“I’ll put a glamor on,” Draco says. Harry moves closer to him, and he goes very still.
Draco pushes his face into Harry’s neck and stays quiet for a long time. When he speaks, his voice is very small. “I just want someone to like me.”
“Is G6 another quadrant?” Draco asks, his voice raw with curiosity, and I glance at him in surprise. At my expression, his mouth pulls into a tight line, guarded once again.
.” Harry easily cleans them up with magic, then brings the covers up over their bodies as Draco burrows even closer to Harry’s chest. “I love when you’re clingy after sex.”
“I trip over them,” Harry says mildly against Draco’s warm skin. Draco laughs again, the sound just a rumble in Harry’s ear.
“Why’d you stay with him then?” Harry looks back up to Draco’s face, blinking away the wetness. Draco looks to the side, then shrugs.
“But you need… your beauty sleep,” Harry mumbles as Draco pokes him in the arm.
“You’re fine, babe.”
“Don’t care,” Harry grunts, sliding his fingers out of Draco to unbutton his jeans, not bothering to take them off as he pulls his aching cock out, giving himself a long stroke. Draco’s hair is still wrapped around his fingers but he loosens his grip just a bit. “Color?”
“This is more important,” Draco says plainly, like it’s the truth, and Harry rolls his eyes as he casts a wandless cleaning spell. Draco yelps, then sticks his tongue out at Harry, but he sounds pleased. “You’re supposed to let
“Hmm, what’s that?” Draco asks, looking up at me with half-lidded eyes as I straddle his hips again.
Harry slaps a hand down on the bed once, twice. “No, no, I’m not– fuck,
“Okay,” Harry says, soothing a hand down Draco’s ribs. He’s so pretty, splayed out like this, his silvery hair spilling across the pillow, the Gryffindor red stark against his wrists. Harry swallows hard. “I want to. I’ll take care of you.”
DRACO
“All better.”
“Do you like this, normally? Like, would you ask a partner to do this for you?”
“What?” Draco asks, fully distracted from the show now. “What do you mean?”
Harry’s mouth twists. “You can, though. You can say no. Or say that it needs to be on the clock.”
“Merlin.” Harry pulls away panting and fists Draco’s formal robes in his hands. “You like the plug?”
“I kind of feel like I need to leave. Because I’m a mess.”

“What?”
soft when you’re griping at me for leaving my shoes in the hallway,” Draco teases. He gently maneuvers Harry’s loose limbs until they’re lying side by side, with Harry’s head resting on Draco’s shoulder and Draco’s arms wrapped around him.
“For real. Let me kiss you for real.”
“Maybe a countercurse needs to be created?” Hermione says, worry warring with academic interest in her voice. Draco is her friend, too. Or
“You’re mad,” Draco says, but a crooked grin is working its way onto his face. He has a single dimple, and Harry wants to press his tongue into it, to experience Draco’s pretty face–
“Thank you. Decide if you would like me to come on your face with you sitting like this, or across your back with you on all fours.” Harry stands, efficiently stripping off his jeans and jumper. He ties his hair back in a low bun with a hair tie Draco slipped onto his wrist earlier. “Afterwards, I’m going to eat you out, and if you’re good and don’t make any sound, I’m going to fuck you. That part isn’t an option. You’re mine to use.”
“I am. I am good, I’m good for you.” Harry says the words like a litany all his own, like he finally believes they’re true. “I know how to make you feel good because I

“Home,
?” Draco asks again, his eyes wide and bright. Harry nods.
He’s just not quite sure what to do with the fact that Draco might like to be tied up.
“No, it’s…” Harry reaches out slowly, running her finger through the end of Draco’s hair. Draco blinks, her lips parted, and Harry tries not to think about the lovely curve of Draco’s cupid’s bow. “It’s

“No,” Draco gasps, scrambling backwards until his shoulders hit the headboard with a
“Did you mean to kiss me?”
“This is my bed!” Harry continues, and I scoff. “I could’ve just left you out in space, but nooooo, I had to do the good thing and bring you onboard, and then you try to sleep in my bed?”
“I didn’t know you had a car,” Draco says softly after a few moments, shifting in his seat.
and expect me to have the resources to treat your clearly magical burns. This could have been so much worse. Why didn’t you go to Saint Mungo’s?”
“I wasn’t– That wasn’t–” Draco swallows back hot tears, turning away from Harry. “Okay. I. Like You. I want to be– with you. For more than just sex. I convinced myself I didn’t because you’re too good for me and I knew you were just sleeping with me because you’re bored. Sometimes I– sometimes you said things that made me wonder if you wanted– but I knew it was just you being nice. Because you are. Nice. And I want to get coffee with you.”
“You said I could. You said, ‘my clothes are your clothes, you fancy git’, when my robes kept catching on things.”
“Oh, you know.” Draco shrugs nonchalantly. He’s nearly to the rear headlight, now. “Giving you just the tiniest bit of what you deserve.”
,” he laughs, and I scowl, because his humor is definitely at my expense. “Draco. You’ve really never been in space for long, have you?”
“Draco?” Harry turns to him fully, his brow furrowed. He’s in a thick green jumper and faded pyjama pants that drag at his heels, sleep rumpled and soft. “Do you want something different?”
The night is too quiet, and Draco can’t sleep.
“Would you like to go on a date?” Draco murmurs, bracing for rejection as soon as the words have left his mouth, but Harry only smiles, wide and boyishly happy, as he nods.
But Draco and Harry mellowed out, from reluctantly polite acquaintances to equally surprised friends to content roommates, and the volley of insults somehow morphed into the Untruth Game, as Draco dubbed it. The way Harry explains it to anyone else, it functions as a way for two mildly repressed people to fucking
“But… but you deserve…” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand, gently so it won’t hurt. “Draco. You deserve someone who likes you but also
“Hm?” Harry summons a pair of handcuffs from the drawer, the soft blue ones Draco favors. He’s biting his bottom lip in concentration and Draco wants to swallow him whole.
Harry summons the matching ankle cuffs while Draco tugs at the restraints around his wrists. Draco bends a knee up until he almost unseats Harry, who slams his hands down onto Draco’s shoulders with a warning glance. The motion causes the tip of his cock to brush Harry’s arse and the plug to push up against his prostate, and heat flashes through Draco’s stomach.
It also helps that the sex is
That’s the right thing to say– Draco’s fascinated by Muggle things that seem impossible without magic, like bubble wands and washing machines. He moves closer to Harry, curiosity warring with trepidation on his face. Harry holds out his hands and wiggles his fingers.
“What?” Harry replies, a broad grin taking over his features. He had moved closer in the time that Draco was talking, and now he grabs Draco’s flailing hands, squeezing them tight. “What’d she say?”
“Later,” Harry murmurs. He’s safe, here in Draco’s arms. “All I want right now is you.”
“Once upon a time, the moon had a daughter.”
It’s a leyline.
Draco, I don’t need the almighty Harry Potter to tell me what to
“I didn’t stop loving you,” Harry says into Draco’s mouth, his hands pressing bruises into Draco’s wrists the way they used to, as though he isn’t planning to let go. “Be with me, for real. I know we’re not perfect, I know we’re not, but– Draco, baby,
The weather steadily gets cooler, the end of summer unspooling to early autumn chill, and Draco easily falls into the rhythm of living with Harry.

Harry answers with a long, sweet kiss that leaves no room for interpretation.
When I come back into the room, pajama clad and much sleepier than ten minutes ago, Harry is sitting upright in the bed, tapping away at a small handheld device. The bed itself is tucked into an alcove in the wall and larger than I expected for a ship this size, and the overall effect is coziness.
“I didn’t realize how grand of a gesture it was going to be,” Harry mutters, a bit sheepishly. “I got everything ready and set it up, but when it came time to show you I realized I had basically just bared my heart to you. But it was worth it, for you to have a place where you feel at home.”
“You know how you have an extra room?” Hermione rolls her eyes, somehow managing to make the action fond, and Harry grins back at her. “And how you’re so good at shrinking charms? Well…”
HARRY
“Breakfast,” Draco says, gesturing a bit wildly towards the hob. “It’s just, you always make it, but I can too, and I wanted to– to do this for you, to make breakfast for you, because it’s– because I do know how, and…” Draco trails off with a helpless shrug, his cheeks bright red, and realization strikes Harry.
Draco hums, unimpressed. “And what do we say to get fucked?”
“Really, Harry. I don’t mind. And your hair is so tenacious, it’ll all escape eventually.”
“Yeah,” Harry replies, his voice coming out smaller than he intends, and Draco covers his face with his hands and laughs until he sobs.
“Don’t– I don’t–”
,” Draco whines, and Harry jolts, because Draco never says his name during sex. Not once. “Harry, please, I want–
Today Draco is sitting on his crisp white sheets looking pale and drawn, though whether from the strain of the bond or just anxiety Harry can’t tell. The knot of heavy affection in Harry’s chest tightens with the desire to simply hold Draco until his shoulders aren’t slumped. Last week he cried when he came– Harry always pretends he doesn’t see, to leave Draco with some semblance of his pride.
“Shut up!” The room is too hot, and Harry is panting, trying to keep his hands from shaking. “Shut the fuck up.”
“I am literally a Junior Healer,” Draco snaps, frustration punching it’s way to the forefront of his thoughts. “I am not
be me’.” Draco huffs, somewhere between a breath and a laugh. “It startled me so much and I couldn’t stop laughing, you remember?”
“I know you are.” Harry snaps a hairband around the end of his braid and slides under the covers. “I’m sorry it’s worse for you,” he whispers, but Draco is already asleep, his shoulder pressed to Harry’s.
“Get in the blanket,” Draco says sternly. He has his fluffiest knit blanket stretched between his hands, advancing on Harry’s where he’s perched on the couch, looking like he might bolt. Draco shakes the blanket a bit, frustrated; he doesn't get why Harry is so cagey about this.

“Mmm.” Draco wiggles impatiently, my dick dragging along stomach, his eyes intent on mine. “Are you going to fuck me now?”
? “I was right, about your mouth being made to suck–
,” Draco spits, and Harry huffs, amused.
“Stop,” he gasps, unable to contain the frantic laughter bubbling up in his throat, and he wiggles and wiggles but Harry is unrelenting, throwing his entire body weight onto Draco and running both hands up his side, much too lightly. “Harry, you bastard, you–
Harry’s mouth is hot on Draco’s as he kisses him hard, working a finger in slowly. He doesn’t wait long before adding another. Draco holds onto Harry, lost in the burning pleasure of it all until Harry pulls his face and his fingers away. For a second Draco chases his mouth, desperate for contact, but he inhales sharply as Harry shifts and nudges the blunt head of his dick against Draco.
“You’re going to come, pet. You’re going to come with my cock buried inside of you, and my come running down your legs, and it won’t matter that you said no, because you’re mine.”
“How many times have I said–”
“Harry?” Draco asks softly, keeping his eyes closed. Trusting.
“Harry,” Draco says thinly, gripping onto the couch cushion for dear life, his body parallel to the floor. “I’ve never been relaxed in my entire life.”
“Do you still want the dildo?”
“I want you so bad,” Harry pants, “
“Really?” Draco asks, suddenly pulling back to search Harry’s face. “It really is?”
“It’s just a glamour. Don’t you know me? I thought you would know me. Draco. I want you to know me.”
Draco sighs, running a hand through his hair and messing up his already mussed bun. “I don’t spend a lot of time in my room, really. So I don’t have too much.”
“We can talk about it,” Draco says softly, but Harry is already off the bed and slamming the door to the bathroom. Draco sinks down onto the sheets, wincing at the stickiness of his own come on his stomach and Harry’s between his legs. When it grows too uncomfortable to bear, he grabs his wand and casts a cleaning spell, then pads down the hall to the bathroom. He doesn’t try the doorknob, just asks, “Harry?”
“You idiot,” Draco says, and tackles Harry to the bed with the force of his kiss. Harry laughs right into his mouth, his hands clutching at Draco’s forearms. They kiss until they’re breathless, breaking away to pant into each other's mouths.
“Having trouble, huh?”
Harry slows the thrust of his finger, hesitant, and Draco looks up to find Harry gazing at him. “Oh, Potter, no, I didn’t mean–
“Okay, you have to be careful.” Harry shows Draco how to plug in the toaster, and even once they have perfectly brown toast Draco is still sulking, staring down at his plate.
“Nope, it’s a planet. Technically? More like, the shell of a planet. The whole thing is hollow, but it’s still very much inhabited.”
“Give me a colour,” Harry says, and Draco’s shoulders twitch like he wants to move, but won’t. “Oh, yes. You can move your hands.”
“I’m sure I can manage with your big strong arms to carry me,” Draco says, his faux sincerity cracking as he joins in on Harry’s laughter.
and Draco had punched him on impulse and then burst into guilty, panicked tears over it.
“Shut up,” Harry replies weakly, turning his head to nudge his nose into Draco’s hair. The tile is cold and uncomfortable on his back, but he doesn't dare move when Draco is so warm on top of his chest. “Is your bruise okay? Be careful, it’ll still be tender even with the potion if you press it too hard.”
The display is staticked out, so I can barely see the person who answers my distress comm. They’re just a flicker of dark curls and white shirt. Their voice—deep and rich—comes through loud and clear.

“We can be gentle like this, too,” Draco murmurs, sliding Harry’s shirt down her shoulder. “If you want.”
“Fucking hell. Stop, Harry,
what do I grab
“Move,” I growl, bucking my body up.Before I realize what’s happening Harry’s got both hands under my thighs, lifting them up until I’m nearly bent in half as his hands cradle my legs. Muscles ripple under his skin and I grab the base of my cock, squeezing tightly, begging myself not to come.
She had a point.
There were a few moments of silence.
Harry looked at the clock. He only had fifteen minutes left at home before he had to go out into the field with Malfoy and Robards.
“Right then! We’re a tad early, but the other members of the court should be here swiftly.”
She sighed. “I’m not picking a fight with you, Harry. I just wanted to check if you’re okay.”
“I know, but… it feels to easy. To just have the location written on a piece of paper.”
“That doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to hurt,” she said.
"Harry, hi!" Mrs Weasley said, bustling in, "I know you said not to bring anything, but we got some crackers and dips just in case."
It took a couple more tries for Ron to get it, Hermione correcting him until he slowly disappeared. The three of them stood around for a while, until most people had succeeded, and Kingsley moved on. The rest of the lesson went similarly - Harry and Hermione easily performing spells, Ron close behind, and the rest of the class (spare a few others), taking a while longer.
Draco made a (mostly) involuntary noise of mockery, which ignited an immediate response.
To his relief, Hermione stood up and walked over to sit next to Pansy.
“We’ll get him back. They don’t have any evidence, there’s no way they can convict him.”
“Sorry. Overslept,” he panted.
“I’m not going to ask again. Tell us, now.”
Potter. You can’t apparate closer than this,” Draco said, and started walking.
“And it can’t wait until after the funeral?” Potter stepped forwards again.
“Fine, whatever.”
Harry felt himself smile back. "Yeah." He paused. "I miss it."
Potter pulled them down into a gentle landing. “Come on, let’s apparate from here.”
“Morning,” Harry said, and Hermione made a noncommittal noise. “Coffee?”
"Stop making excuses for him," Draco said, trembling. He pressed her forehead to hers, closing his eyes.
"Yes."
“I just… I haven’t heard from my mum- my parents- in a while, and…” He took a deep, quivering breath. “I know they weren’t good people. I just want them to be… to be alive.”
Although he couldn’t pronounce most of the names, Draco was quite impressed by Teddy’s dragon knowledge.
The Purists had to be connected to the recent murders. It was too much of a coincidence. But both the Collins had been arrested and had died in Azkaban years ago, and Amyra hadn’t seemed suspicious… who else had been involved?
Harry forced a smile. Ron had always been bad at reading emotions, but he couldn't blame him for thinking Harry's bad mood was due to missing Ginny, rather than seeing her.
Harry wanted to say something to Draco, to comfort him, but he didn’t know what.
to lose a hand?” He snapped.
“Stay, boy. We’ll get out of here soon,” Draco told Leo. He barked happily, and licked Draco’s hand. Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“Excellent. Bring them to the library, and we’ll get started on research.”
"Cheer up, mate, Ginny's going to be here in a few minutes," Ron said.
“For someone who hates Muggles so much, it feels weird that he entrusted his secrets to a simple safe,” Harry said.
“Okay.”
Draco nodded, and followed Blaise inside.
“Harry?”
Draco felt his heartbeat speed up. Panic. He couldn’t breath. His throat had closed up, Luke was before him, but he looked so much like Draco’s father-
“Hermione, you don’t have to do this,” Harry said, softly, putting a hand on her shoulder.
Frowning, Harry walked towards her, and was about to ask what was wrong, when it clicked.
Potter stepped forward, and looked at the tag around the dog’s neck. “Leo,” he said, and patted the dog, “he’s a St Bernard.”
“...we’re close. Very close. I can feel it, Erin, soon this will all be behind us.”
Draco smiled softly. “I love you, Pansy.”
“What do you mean?”
He stood up as they approached. “Good, you’re here. Let’s go. I can take you with side-along apparition; it’ll be easiest.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Harry and Draco stood in silence, for a few moments before the lift dinged and the doors slid open. Harry practically sprinted down the hall, Draco close in tow, before reaching ward E4. He shoved the door open to reveal a large room with a few beds, nurses and doctors milling around in green Healer’s robes.
They walked inside, to find a kitchen, lounge, bathroom, and single bedroom.
It wasn’t the shaky, unsteady scrawl of his mother, like he’d been expecting, but instead an official print. Somehow, that made Draco more uneasy.
“You don’t have to say anything, but… I love you, and I’m here for you if you want to talk, or if you want to watch a movie and eat ice cream, or if you just want me to sit with you in silence.”
She paused. "I'll miss you, Draco. We hardly have time to talk like this, or watch movies, or anything."
“Draco.”
Blaise had inherited his parents’ house. Similarly to Malfoy Manor, it was a huge, sprawling place on top of an isolated hill.
Draco felt his heartbeat speed up. "Uh, what?"
“What’re we going to do with him?” Potter asked, still petting Leo.
“You weren’t there, Hermione.” Potter stopped again. “If I had been in Dra- in Malfoy’s position, I would have done the same thing.”
But, everyone who had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and had finished school had been given an opportunity to be an auror, if they wished. Most people had said yes.
“Sorry, I just… want to make sure he’s looked after. I don’t know.”
Dean and Seamus nodded.
He walked out of the ward, to see Robards pacing up and down, and Draco chewing his lip nervously, sitting in one of the chairs in the passage.
"Me too."
Draco snapped his head up at Pansy’s voice.
She scowled at Harry as Draco and Narcissa broke apart.
Potter. That must be Harry’s great uncle, the auror.
“Oh, no,” Draco laughed, and then paused. He felt his heartbeat speed up as he took a deep breath. “I’m, uh, I’m gay.”
“Thanks. And good luck to you too.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied, confused.
"I can't believe they still keep those things around," Potter muttered as the boat came to a stop.
“You okay?”
“Yeah, and I can’t cook. We know this.” She gestured to the counter, where ten more packets of ramen were in a pile.
Ivan looked away, and Draco saw his eyes watering.
“I’m not sure, Gawain, it all feels very precarious-”
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled, wiping his eyes.
“It’s okay, you don’t need to say anything, or…” he still didn’t look Harry in the eyes. “You know how much we’ve been fighting recently. Every time we get into an argument, I find myself thinking, ‘This is it, she’s going to break up with me.’ Then she doesn’t. And I kind of realised that I keep provoking her because… I think I want it to end.”
Draco saw Potter perk up when he heard the word ‘Black’.
Leo opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Unperturbed, he silently barked again, and then licked Draco’s hand.
“Hermione, I really don’t want to- oh. Hi, Harry.”
Ron stood up. “I don’t think you should do it.”
Ron obliged, scowling, and stomped out into the garden.
His hair, usually so perfectly styled, looked like it hadn’t been brushed. There were dark bags under his eyes, and his shirt was wrinkled, the top button undone.
Harry was beginning to feel uncertain about spying on Malfoy, too.
"Did you learn… patronuses?" Draco asked, surprised. Patronuses were incredibly difficult. Potter doing them was one thing, but all the kids in Dumbledore's Army…
Harry called the nearest pizza place and ordered two larges, then joined Hermione on the couch.
“Imperius.”
“Okay. That makes sense. And I don’t suppose there’s any chance I can come with you?”
When had they gone to Ukraine? Draco had still been very young - it had probably been his first or second year at Hogwarts. That was almost a decade ago, so it was safe to assume that Draco’s father hadn’t been involved in the destruction of Ivan’s village, and besides, they’d been in central Ukraine, nowhere near the border to Hungary.
Harry and Malfoy stood at the door to the bedroom, staring at the bed.
Harry bolted upright in bed, sweating.
“Yeah,” Harry smiled back, and handed her a cup of coffee. “How are you feeling?”
“He was defending himself.”
“Then you don’t have to. Just do a small thing.”
“Uh, yeah,” he said, trying to sound normal. “And you… are you thinking about Ron?”
Hermione walked into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes groggily. Her hair was untamed and her shirt was buttoned wrong.
‘Declared deceased’. Not passed away, or even died,
“Bye, Ivan. I’ll see you.”
The door opened.
“Then why didn’t you…”
“But I think I understand now,” Ivan said. “Even if you hadn’t had a tough few days, you still wouldn’t have texted me. Am I right?”
Robards was sitting at his desk, and looked up in surprise. “Potter? Whatever is the matter-”
Harry knew it was a dangerous distance to apparate, but he didn’t care. He felt the breath being squeezed out of his lungs as he, Draco and all their belongings contorted to land inside Amyra’s house.
“You expecting a delivery?” Draco said, frowning.
She sighed. “I don’t know. But we can’t do anything rash. It’ll only make matters worse.”
Harry sat down again, nodding.
“Harry! Sorry, I forgot you’d be home today…” she trailed off, and Harry noticed that her eyes were red and puffy.
“Now, as I was saying before, if you confess to everything, we will offer you a reduced sentence. It’s simple.”
"Yeah, me too."
“Well, keep up the good work. Dismissed.”
Pansy sighed, and nodded. "I don't want you to be, but I guess you're right." She reached forwards and tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. "It'll be okay, Draco."
“And what do you think I am able to do about that?”
The lock clicked, and the door swung open.
“And yet here you are, with a couple of Gryffindors and a blood traitor-”
"I guess they don't know what else to do with them. Can't exactly let them roam free."
Harry blinked at her. “What?”
Draco turned to look at Potter, still in deep conversation with Robards. He watched as Potter bit his lip in thought, and looked at the way his hair stuck up in every direction, looked at how he was standing, with one of his feet pointing out at a weird angle, and Draco felt his hand subconsciously rising up to touch the silver pendant on his neck.
“Ma’am, I’m going to have to ask you to calm down, or you’ll be arrested too for impeding arrest.”
“Budge up.”
“Draco,” Ivan called over the music, “Your friend is calling you.”
The kitchen door swung open, and Potter ran in, followed by the others.
"Harry!" Mr Weasley said, and Mrs Weasley immediately gave up the chair next to Ginny's bed. George and Percy were also around her bed.
“Yeah, I think I’m feeling the same. With the guilt.”
A few minutes later, they all stood in the entrance to the sprawling Ministry of Magic library.
Malfoy was just scared. There was no way he was still a Death Eater. He was just a kid who wanted to see his parents again, unless… unless he was a really good actor-
Draco glared at Pansy, who rolled her eyes.
“Do you know the code?”
Pansy put her hand over the Mark. "I know, Draco. But things will get easier, even if they don't get altogether better."
“What?”
The guilt was there, but Draco was used to it. He'd had the same feeling in his gut for years, from the first time he'd realised he liked boys and not girls, until he'd first met Potter, and every waking moment since then when his thoughts had drifted from his family duty to the dark haired boy that intrigued him so much.
“I figured. Not like a group of Aurors pops round just to have a cup of tea.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Ron snapped, glaring at Hermione.
“I…” she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. “I have to face my fears someday.” Her voice was shaking.
“Ron, don’t beat yourself up. You’re still doing really well,” Hermione said, “you just need to listen more.”
Harry raised an eyebrow in surprise. “That is not what I expected you to say.”
“Well, you know, Robards still wants us to keep an eye on him.”
Amyra shrugged. "Whatever you want to believe, kiddo."
“Yes, I’m sure, now
TRIGGER WARNING:
“Shut up.”
"Okay, fair enough. But now we don't have to stay in my room. The whole house is out oyster."
“Hm? Oh, I, um… Sorry. I zoned out.”
“Harry, don’t you think-”
They smiled at each other again, and for a moment, Draco managed to forget about what lay ahead.
She sighed, and scratched Padfoot behind the ears.
They nodded.
"I, uh," Harry trailed off, realising how stupid his reasoning sounded, "I had a dream that you had been hurt." He avoided her skeptical gaze. "There was a couple that we interviewed before you about the Muggle killings that were murdered a few days ago. I got paranoid."
“He’s taken sick leave. I thought you would have known,” Robards said, frowning. Harry and Hermione exchanged a look. “Anyway, we don’t have time - we’re short-staffed as it is, and there’s a lot of work to be done.” He sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. “Listen up, everyone, continue with the tasks your supervisors have set you. Work quickly. We do not want the Muggle police getting their hands on all this. Granger, Potter, Malfoy - with me.”
But here Draco was, walking up the driveway to the huge, iron gates of the house that he had grown up in, that his mother had lived in, his mother who was now-
Draco skipped forward a few entries.
She opened the door, and behind her stood Ron. Both of them looked very pale.
They both looked up, to see Bill Weasley frowning at them.
TRIGGER WARNING: This chapter contains descriptions of child abuse that may be troubling to some readers.
Robards sighed, and turned to Elarena. “Bring the Veritaserum.”
For a brief moment, he wondered what his father would say, but something that might have been the tequila made him think, fuck it.
They were definitely in over their heads.
He opted for what he hoped was somewhat companionable silence.
The apartment was almost exactly how Harry remembered it - small, a bit run-down, but homely. A few moments after he knocked, the door opened, and Seamus stood there.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “When I said that, the Prophet was working directly for Voldemort. Now it’s just a bunch of nosy journalists trying to find an interesting story.”
“This weird Muggle thing. It’s called the Simpsons.”
“I’m sorry, by the way,” Pansy said, as Harry awkwardly looked around the room.
Well, he was one to talk. He and Ginny hadn’t been doing much better lately.
He didn’t read the rest of the message.
They walked off, leaving Draco standing alone in the corridor.
Potter didn’t respond.
Taking a deep breath, Draco inserted the key into the door. He wished Potter wasn’t watching him so intently; however hard he tried, he couldn’t stop his hand shaking. He turned the key, slowly,
Draco reached into the box and pulled out a necklace.
Ron was sitting on his bed, curtains closed, face illuminated only by the glow of his phone. Clothes were strewn all over his floor, along with an assortment of dirty crockery. He barely looked up as Harry walked in and sat on the other end of the bed.
Draco flinched, along with most of the others in the room.
She rubbed her eyes. “Oh, god… sorry, Harry, I didn’t get much sleep.”
“They should get Hermione in here,” Harry muttered, more to himself than anything, “we wouldn’t see her for a week, but the place would be completely organised when she emerged.”
"I mean, I…" Harry felt like whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say. He opted for the truth. "I, uh, yeah."
“Thank you. And the same goes for you.”
He wasn’t sure exactly how long he’d been lying there. He had drifted in and out of a restless sleep for a while, and then resorted to a useless attempt to untangle his thoughts.
“Yeah, go ahead. I’ll get you some blankets.”
“So? What do you guys think?”
“Your sister is coming home tomorrow, Ronald,” she said, glaring at him.
“Uh, what are you watching?”
“Don’t tempt me,” Draco said, with a small smile, walking into his bedroom. He sat down at his desk, and opened one of the boxes containing all of the Collins’ journals. He had told Robards his findings about the ‘Purists’, and had been ordered to further investigate.
“Uh,” Blaise said.
“Go and talk to Lucius Malfoy, obviously! We’ll have to get special permission to enter Azkaban, of course, but it shouldn’t be a problem - this investigation is the Ministry’s highest priority after all. I want you two to go - you should leave as soon as possible. I’ll send a message asking permission right now. Start getting everything ready!”
“Because it’s way better than wizarding ones. Wizards don’t even have any gay bars that I know of, anyway. And it’s not like we’re here to make friends, Draco.”
“It’s alright. I know… we want to bury our pasts. But, you are better now. You became an Auror. That is not an easy thing to do.”
Ginny's frown enveloped her entire face. "Harry, I understand that you're busy with work. I know how difficult it is for you right now. I was expecting you not to be able to come today, or not come right away… I told myself it would happen, but it was okay."
"... Anthony's sweet, but he's honestly a bit useless. He just copies whatever other people- Harry?" Hermione stopped her ramble about work when she noticed he had stopped.
“Get your head out of your ass, Theodore. You’re just lucky you haven’t suffered the same fate. We all are. We’ve been given a second chance. Draco and I are choosing to take it.” She stood up. “Come on, Draco. Let’s go. It’s clear we aren’t wanted here.” Draco stood up quickly. Pansy threw one last look at Blaise, who avoided her eyes, before storming out. Draco followed her closely.
Harry noticed Draco’s hand trembling.
“I… I don’t…” Draco stuttered, lost for words.
Eyebrows raised in incredulity, Robards spluttered, “Wh-whatever brought you to this conclusion?”
To say that they had been thrown in the deep end was an understatement.
“The study’s upstairs,” Draco said, and walked briskly towards the staircase. He wanted to get out of the foyer as quickly as possible, he didn’t want to think about his mother-
RON: Oi, you’re gonna be back for Ginny’s surgery, right?
“Ah. I got caught up… I stayed over at Blaise’s a couple nights ago and left some things there. Went to fetch them on the way.”
Ivan shrugged. “That was many years ago, now. I have travelled around, first to America, then France, Belgium, Russia, and finally here. I like it here the most. I have started learning about magical plants. I would like to open a shop, I think.”
Hermione frowned. "Well, they aren't there now."
“Well, you’re right. I’m not alright, but I’m getting there.”
Hermione muttered an incantation, and the peas picked themselves up and decanted into a pot of boiling water.
“Uh, yeah.”
The man nodded. “I am bisexual.”
“Malfoy, what are you-”
“I know how to do that,” he hissed.
He glared at her.
“Why not?” Pansy sat next to him.
“Yes. Terrible, really.”
“He’s only a couple minutes late, sir-” Harry started, before Draco ran in, stopping next to them, breathing heavily.
The person deflected Draco’s spell, and they started to duel. After a couple of seconds, Potter joined in too, but even their combined efforts at flinging spell after spell at this person seemed to do nothing.
"You're from the Ministry?" She said, scowling at them.
The Healer’s eyes widened slightly, but he quickly regained his composure.
“What?” Harry said.
Pansy snorted. “Well, you might as well
Draco got out of the car, and walked up to his flat.
Pansy groaned loudly. “Draaacoooo, just do a spell or something, please? Cooking with magic takes like, zero effort.”
The hallway opened out into the foyer.
The door opened after a few seconds, and Dean was standing there.
“Why did you move?”
The woman scowled at them, but nodded.
Harry nodded, and followed her in.
“Tell me what? I haven’t seen either of you since I left Amyra’s house-” Harry suddenly cottoned on. “Oh,” he said, “you guys broke up?”
He knocked.
He turned back to Amyra.
"Thank you, Mrs Weasley," he said, smiling and taking her offering of food. Ginny followed close behind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, I don’t want to trouble you-”
Harry thought,
The new recruits had been put straight to work, with training squeezed into their schedules. There was a senior auror put to train the recruits, in pairs, as well as general classes.
to distrust Draco, but like Hermione said, blindly trusting him might not be the smartest move.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Just the outside. Stand back.” Potter did so, and Draco raised his wand, moving it in a sweeping motion across the gate. It swung open, with a creak.
“Maybe another time. Let’s stay in touch.” He pulled a receipt and a pen out of his pocket, and scribbled his phone number on the back of the receipt, handing it to Draco, who pocketed it. “Goodbye, Draco.”
“I’m not making excuses for him anymore,” Draco said, and his voice was firm. There was a fire behind his eyes as he turned and walked out the room, Harry following.
A murmur ran through the crowd.
“Don’t worry about it. The more pressing question is, what are
“Yep, that’s me. And don’t worry about Padfoot here, he’s all bark and no bite.”
“Well, that seems unlikely… I expect she was more familiar with the, er, rest of the Blacks,” Robards said, but he gave Potter a sympathetic smile.
Amyra laughed. “You remind me a lot of Sirius, you know.”
Malfoy didn’t respond.
The last letter had been dated four months ago, and if they were allowed to send letters every three months…
“I guess so.”
“I can’t stop it now, Erin,” Robards said, wringing his hands, “it’s too late. They
She smiled in relief. “Thank Merlin. Not that I don’t want you to stay with Ron, but… I didn’t really have anywhere else to stay. I didn’t really think living situations through until we’d already settled on this apartment, and then…”
"The Purists…" she muttered, "You mean that group that Lucius was part of years ago?"
“I don’t know. Maybe. But I don’t think he’s a bad person.”
He couldn't even ask Hermione for help understanding them - they were under strict instructions not to share any of their work with other aurors.
Robards coughed, almost nervously. “We just need to be careful, Potter. I’m sure you understand.”
Draco looked down at the book again, his breathing slowing. Then, he furrowed his eyebrows, looking at the title of the book.
An hour of painful eyeliner and painstakingly chosen outfits later, Pansy and Draco headed out into town.
A few hours later, Harry, Hermione, Pansy and Andromeda were standing outside Blaise Zabini’s house, all with a similar look of dread and nervousness on their faces.
They both looked at Hermione. “I- I don’t think it’s impossible,” she said, timidly, “I agree that we can’t be one hundred percent sure, but I think it’s worth being cautious.”
She nodded.
He locked the door, and slumped against it, running his hands through his hair.
Draco snapped his head back to face his father, and walked forwards until they were face to face. “Shut up.
He really hoped Hermione would forgive him.
Harry turned back to them. "Oh, nothing."
They walked outside, followed by Potter, Andromeda, and Teddy. It was sunny, but there was a distinct chill in the air.
Some of his old school books were still on his desk, along with others he’d picked up from Flourish and Blotts. An eagle feather quill lay across an abandoned piece of parchment, the inkpot next to it still half full.
“Are you okay?”
Malfoy didn’t know that Harry had endorsed him.
Draco glanced guiltily at the kitchen, where his phone had been sitting, face down, for the past three days.
Potter nodded again. “I’ll let him know.” Pause. “Are you… doing okay?”
Potter stopped pacing, and looked as if he was about to say something, when there was a sudden loud crack behind him, and Hermione Granger appeared, looking distinctly frazzled.
Draco was breathing heavily. He realised he was on the floor, curled up. Luke was staring at him, scared. “What- what happened? Did I do something?”
"Well," Harry said, panicking slightly, "I just think… maybe it's about time, you know? Independence, and all that."
Ivan looked confused, but still responded. “Four years ago.”
Harry smiled, and took her hand. He had offered to pay, or at least contribute, as soon as Ginny had started talking about surgery, but as he had expected, the Weasleys had declined.
“What would I do without you?”
“What kind of booby traps are we facing now?” Potter said, his tone cold.
“Who else knew about the safe?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, but it didn’t quell the unsettled feeling in his stomach.
He was furious.
“Potter, I understand that it’s not ideal, but we are under immense pressure to find out everything we can- we have to be sure-” Robards ran a hand through his hair, and then mumbled, “if I’d known you were going to be here…”
“What? Why?”
Harry grinned. "Hey, that's great! Has your dad managed to get the loan out?"
"Yeah. I love you. Bye," Ginny stood up too, kissing him.
Blaise paused, looking from Pansy, to Harry, and back to Pansy.
“...asked Potter to report back to me regularly on Malfoy’s actions,” Robards was saying, “I’d like you to do the same, Granger. I’m not saying that he can’t be trusted, but with everything going on right now… well, it’s better to be safe than sorry.”
Draco took a sip of his drink.
me updating regularly? more likely than you might think
Ron resignedly switched his phone off, and looked at Harry. “How do you think?”
He wasn’t sure that Draco could do this on his own.
“I hope so.” She sighed. “Whatever Robards and Elarena were talking about, it was definitly suspicious. Whether it has anything to do with there being a spy in the Ministry or not, I want to find out what’s going on.”
"Oh, for Merlin's- Harry, check the lasagne, please."
He looked around. Only a few other people had succeeded on their first try. Granger, of course; Potter, also expected; some others whose names he didn’t know; and, surprisingly, Neville Longbottom.
Ivan’s breath caught.
“Ah, how did you find it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut up, you know I’m right. And now, you get the number of this dude who just so happens to have had his hometown destroyed by your father. Maybe Freud had a point.”
"How was work?" Pansy asked as Draco flopped on the couch.
"Pansy, right?"
Ginny stared at him, not saying a word.
"You seen Draco?" Robards asked.
“Is… where’d she go?” Draco asked, as Potter walked towards him.
She bit her lip. “I don’t know if he’d want to-”
he thought.
"I'm sorry."
Harry opened the oven. "Uh, I think it's ready?"
“I… nothing. Sorry.” He looked down at the book he was holding. His hands were trembling.
"Ginny, I still love you. Of course I do," he said, and she looked back at him.
Draco felt something sink in his heart, and he looked away from Ivan, out the car window. “I’m sure… I’m sure you know my father was a Death Eater. We went to Hungary four years ago, on holiday. We stayed near the border to Ukraine. My father disappeared for a few days, for ‘work’. I think… I think he was one of the people who destroyed your village.”
Pansy laughed hollowly through her tears. “You think they care about a fair trial? They just need someone to blame for everything that’s going on, and he’s the perfect scapegoat. An ex-Death Eater working for the Ministry? Everyone will buy it.”
Harry felt something twist in his stomach.
Harry shrugged. He still thought it was useful to know what the public was reading and thinking.
“I know you’re not okay, but I don’t really know what else to say.”
"That's good," Harry said, smiling, and he squeezed her hand.
Harry flopped down on the couch, and sighed. It was a chilly Saturday morning, and he was under strict instructions from Robards (and Hermione) to:
“Well, you didn’t get caught, so it’s fine.”
“One… two… three!” Draco shot a stunning spell up at the ceiling, and with a deafening crash, the area where he’d hit fell down, leaving a pile of rubble in front of the door.
Harry sat down on the bed next to him.
Draco didn't remember much. The music being too loud, Blaise being angry, him being envious. Pansy told him what he had said the next morning, and he'd been mortified.
“More like did I survive with him,” Pansy said, walking into the room and pouting.
“It still hurts. All the time. I guess I just… push it away.” Harry pulled her towards him, and she sobbed into his shoulder. “We all have different ways of dealing with things, Hermione. It doesn’t make you weaker.”
“Thanks, mate.”
“Yeah! I can’t wait. It sucks that I’ll still have to go through all the original auror tests while you guys got a free pass, though.”
“You don’t have to do this,” Harry said.
“I think that’s normal,” Potter said, and Draco could feel Potter’s eyes on him. He tried to continue staring resolutely at the sky, but for some reason he felt his eyes being drawn downwards to lock with Potter’s. His face was illuminated by the moon and stars in a silvery glow, almost like a halo, and his signature emerald green eyes seemed to be speckled with gold.
“Harry, quickly, there’s no time-” She ran forwards to Draco. He looked at her in surprise. “Listen, you have to go. Somewhere safe, where the Ministry won’t find you, they’re going to-”
do such a thing to him. She'd never caused him pain deliberately. But what did it matter? Because he was feeling it anyways.
-"Oh, Merlin I rubbed off on you." Draco chuckled.
He really hadn't thought about what Draco had said before the whole

Harry's eyes widened but his first instinct wasn't to jump to his feet and lie through his teeth but to clutch Draco's arm tighter. He distantly remembered how Draco had said

It was too much. All of it. Too much.
that she was dead, though, he no longer feared her death. No. Pain was the new resident evil in Draco's body. Scorpius's innocent words dug a hole in his heart. Draco's breath caught in his throat, and his heart squeezed painfully, he tried to push the creeping fog away - They needed to leave.
-"She's gone now and I'm all his, and Theo, he doesn't care about you or anyone as long as it's his bed I sleep in at night—"
He drew Draco back to him and kissed him.
-"I am." Draco whispered. He didn't even sound apologetic.
Harry felt beaten, battered, defeated and extremely exhausted. His entire body ached. And
When I thought of worldly things I might miss come tomorrow,
-"What's wrong? Harry we don't have time for this."
Finally, Narcissa's genteel upbringing made her stand up, almost glide towards Harry and hold her hand out to him.
-"Probably chasing some useless bit of gossip about what type of coal the minister's imaginary mistress uses to fuel her hearth." Theo said.
-"Alohomora.Wingardium Leviosa." Theo said, waving his wand.
Their faces were so close, their noses were touching. Draco's arms were trapped between them against Harry's chest; Harry's own arms and legs were locking Draco tightly in Harry's loving,
-"Something's wrong with you—"
-"I'm getting a divorce,"
-"T-Théo." Draco croaked out. His voice was raspy and rusty from occasional screaming and little speaking.
They sat down and discussed the boring details of how Draco's case files and assignments would pop up in a specific drawer and how he would be working with literally every department in need of his expertise, so while some departments like the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures or the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes didn't do shit individually, all of their cases combined would be a lot of work. Granger also pointed out that the Department of Mysteries would need Draco too, no one knew what they did, so things could be pretty busy. Blaise had his nose in the air like the pretentious asshole that he was, everyone except Granger and Scorpius looked at him with an expression of utter contempt and disgust they've all practiced and perfected during their teenage years. It was an expression that made the average person squirm and shuffle and feel useless and worthless, it was an expression that told its recipient to go quietly crawl into the nearest ditch and promptly die you fucking waste of oxygen.
Draco Malfoy had a fitful sleep. His dreams nowadays weren't particularly nightmares, but they were worse, they were of

Harry sighed and rested his head back against Draco's belly.
At the sight of them.
Draco blinked at her. He was mostly sober. Yet, still drunk on the memories Scorpius's innocent comment had stirred. He couldn't really hold a conversation while feeling the ghost of Astoria's hands in his hair. It seemed somewhat vivid and surreal. Draco didn't want it to stop. He wished moments like this would happen more often. He wished for madness so he'd never stop feeling her touch, listening to her laughter, watching her face.
Theo smirked.
On Women's Day, a few days ago on the eighth of March, Scorpius hadn't made a single comment about

They strolled around looking for Blaise and Pansy since it was nearly countdown-time, only to find Blaise staggeringly conversing with none other than Granger and the Weasel. Potter was nowhere to be seen.
-"Hadn't my aunt
Draco realized he was leaning heavily against theo. Pansy was crying silent tears next to him. Blaise had his head downcast - was he crying too? Or was he praying? Was he thinking of his dead father? Was he ashamed of meeting Draco's eyes, knowing he was alive and Astoria was dead? Draco thought he should be, they should

-"My boyfriend is not in love with you!" Pansy said, indignantly.
-"Please read it to me," Draco whispered tearfully.
He was sitting on his bed —he'd moved out from Scorpius's room obviously, to his childhood chambers— propped up with the giant headboard and half a dozen pillows, chatting with Theo, when Pansy and Blaise pushed the doors to his room open and barged in. Pansy practically bouncing with excitement, while Blaise was smiling smugly.
They all simultaneously turned their heads towards him and seemed to be quite surprised for a second to see him. Like they'd forgotten where they were. They looked around the literal hundreds of people that made a huge circle around them, Harry and Ron.
Draco kept at it.

Draco was leaving him. Harry's heart would never stop aching, ferociously protesting against being parted with Draco, the hollow pit of heartache would swallow him whole, from the inside out. Draco, Draco Malfoy whom Harry
Despite that, Harry wasn't going to follow his heart anymore. He wasn't a child. He wasn't leaving Ginny, the Weasleys were family, Harry's only family. He'd have
painfully—he'd shied away from further contemplating it. Merlin, another long episode!
-"RON STOP!" Hermione screeched.
He didn't elaborate anymore and Harry didn't want to overwhelm him so he didn't push.
-"What? Okey, then you don't—"
-"Really? He'll love it. Thank you!"
-"—are in dire need of a potions-master. All the departments are currently suffering because of the considerable shortage we have. Overworked, underpaid, ministry officials are—"

Words that were long overdue.
-"Shut up! We have a son. You don't understand, none of you do. She wouldn't leave him. She would never. He's only five! He needs his Mother. She'd never do this to him. She's not dead! He's my son. He's our son. Scorpius is my son, she'd never - you're lying, lying! Why? She's alive! WHERE?—"
him in his life.
-"I can't believe you, Draco. I feared you'd been up to something shady. There's nothing wrong with going to muggle clubs. Although, admittedly, it's kinda weird, because you're Draco Malfoy, all prim and proper, snobbish and sometimes even annoyingly genteel—which makes you look so out of place here. but it's okey. It's nothing to be ashamed of or keep secret. I'm not a conceited, pureblooded asshole with a stick up my ass like Nott. . . or  you, as a matter of fact. Come on I'll buy you a drink or two or three. Can we come tomorrow? Or every night. It's so close—"
They carried on walking, all four of them.
Harry Potter was, again, petrified, horrified, stunned and thinking. Draco Malfoy made him think. Made him even hate himself a bit.
-"I wasn't alright before."
Harry tilted his head back to stare up at Draco.
-"BOYS."
Ron got up and walked off. Hermione wordlessly spelled everything in place, including Harry's battered body.
-"What?"
-"PLEASE, I DONT WANT TO DIE."
Fuck! He should have went with Quidditch instead.
Harry tickled Scorpius until he announced Harry being his third child. Rose and Draco giggled and protested on the grounds that Harry's hair was raven-black and therefore could not be related to any of them, Harry begrudgingly let a mischievously delighted Draco turn his hair a light orangy-brown. Harry must've looked ridiculous judging by Draco's uncontrollable fit of laughter. Harry fell in love with him even more. Which was astounding, for Harry felt that every cell in his body sang a perpetual, beautiful, unearthly chant, of his unequivocal love and devastating yearning for Draco Lucius Malfoy.
-"What! I didn't. You can't—What...I didn't. You...I swear. I didn't know...I would never, I pro—"
Theo had his head down. Forehead resting on the underside of Draco's wrist, painstakingly kissing Draco's knuckles, fingers, palm and over again.
Harry smiled.
-"And, Now. For what I've been dying to tell you all morning." She looked at Scorpius. "I have a three-year old daughter who'd be delighted to be your friend Scorpius! I've actually had the playroom made for her when she was just a baby. She'd love to come work with mommy again. Her name's Rose." Granger said gleefully.
Draco glared at Greg.
Harry wouldn't loose hope.
Nothing got through the walls of his depression. He didn't know what day it was, in fact, he could no longer grasp the concept of time, nor that of space for that matter. And he didn't even care. It was all extraneous to him. What did it matter, when Astoria was fucking dead?
-"Fucking hell!" Harry whispered. Some of the
-"Hmm? Oh, Father did. You know how we practically have the same hair—"
-"No,
-"What about the muggle boyfriend?"
After a prolonged lunch that Harry had gotten away with not touching since everyone was so busy patting Ginny's bump, Hermione stared at Harry in the eye, for the first time since everything broke out, and silently communicated that he should follow her.
The air vacated Draco's lungs so fast, his entire body went into shock. Wheezing, he dropped to his knees. Each breath Draco dragged into his lungs did nothing to nurture the overwhelmingly urgent need for air engulfing him. Draco's senses shut down, he couldn't register any outside stimulus, nothing beyond the unbearable burning in his chest; he was suffocating. He dropped down on the ground, lying on his side atop her grave, in the middle of the small field of Hyacinths, and wept. Everything was becoming an incomprehensible blur, the edges of his vision were darkening and Draco distantly recognized that he was loosing consciousness for lack of oxygen. Draco's lungs convulsed in desperation. The sound of his violently thrashing heart was the only thing that filtered through the haze of agony and shock. Draco gasped and panted to no avail. His shoulders and chest heaved and he quivered all-over with every desperate and mechanical try at pulling in air. His last thought before the encroaching, all-encompassing darkness swallowed him whole was -
Dread and panic flooded his veins, his surroundings were dark, cold and deathly silent.
Harry couldn't believe it either. He didn't say anything and just relished in the feel of Draco in his arms, he refused to think of why, feel guilty or anything.
Draco grinned, "Never."
, warm embrace.
Harry smiled too and vowed to make Scorpius who liked everyone, like him more than everyone.
His posture stiffened, muscles rigid. Eyes blown-wide open in shock, face white with fear. A violent tremor overtook his body and a great sob escaped him, followed by a flood of wet, hot, salty tears streaming down his ashen cheeks.
Harry's heart cracked then.
the longing grew—and would grow more crippling, more devastating, as time went on.
-"WhynotIloveyoupleasebemyboyfriend?" Harry mumbled in a rush. He blushed hard and felt tears welling up in his eyes for the impending '
seem sorry which was so startling, for Harry was sure Draco Malfoy was never sorry, for anything. It was the second time he'd apologized to Harry. It made him feel better, to know that Draco cared for him even if he could never love him like Harry loved him.
ANYTHING!
Harry held him closer and kissed his forehead. Draco was drowsy and puffy-eyed from all the crying.
Draco's eyes widened, surprised by Harry's sudden, unusual canniness, he sighed, "Yes."
-"Potter you're staying. Come with me and Blaise. You're no fun, Theo. Draco rubbed off on you with his bitching and whining over his dead wife." Pansy said mockingly.
cards to Rose and Granger. But not once did he appear disheartened or sad or did he make another card for his Mother, or ask about her.
Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott stood in front of the magnificent foyer in The Nott Estate, taking a much needed moment before flooing to Diagon-Alley.
Sorry could never cut it.
Harry smiled.
Pansy and Blaise flooed to their respective houses to get dressed—which was stupid because they've all (except Blaise) been practically living together back in France and were doing the same now in Malfoy Manor (with the addition of Blaise) but Draco figured that all of their clothes combined was
As Harry apparated the next day in front of the Burrow, the spring afternoon sun warmed his chilly body through.
Today your life on earth has passed but here life starts anew.
Draco had no doubt he'd have to go through this again. But he was glad Scorpius wasn't crying. Otherwise he'd have gone straight back to the merciless depths of the dark fog. because the fog hadn't disappeared. Draco suspected it never will.
to Harry's debilitating feelings of longing, pain and despair.
-"WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?"
-"Oh, sorry, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me—"
He just didn't know it yet, Harry decided.
-"Eternity sounds good." Harry said as he grinned joyfully and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him in tightly against him, Draco went willingly and cupped Harry's cheeks in both hands, Harry leaned his face into the touch and felt fresh tears resurface in his eyes, he breathed deeply Draco's scent.
Harry did the same, breathing loudly, rapidly and irregularly through his mouth.
-"It's like I'm watching a movie about a bunch of Dumbledores lying and keeping shit from one and another."
Ginny came, talked, laughed and smiled, the Quidditch season finally ended, they hadn't won but it was close and she was pretty happy with her team's placement, she was tired and glad to finally be home, she'd missed Harry, dinner was lovely and thank you Kreacher—Harry didn't eat a bite; He barely managed a smile. Neither did Ron or Hermione, Ginny had clearly picked up on the tension but didn't want to address it, probably thinking whatever it was could wait or be immediately forgotten upon hearing her amazing news.
it so well. Harry's heart hurt. His chest squeezed, enclosing on his heart painfully. He was having trouble remembering how to
-"I don't hate you anymore."

-"First,
He started screaming with laughter, as they moved on to tickling his sides.
Harry hated them - hated himself.
-"Oh Merlin. I'm so sorry. I should have looked it up before. Oh, baby, please forgive me."
-"But that's not what happened at all! And besides I said eventually that I'd mistaken his love for Jealousy."
He loved Draco.
, that cannot be unsaid." Draco whined.
Everyone followed.
. He was also wearing a headband with a white and pink, glittery unicorn's horn in the center.
Harry's heart stirred to life at the sight of Draco, and tears streamed down his cheeks. He missed him so bad, it felt like he'd been walking with his chest sliced open, and his severed heart was
Hell existed, that they were
Hell and damnation. He needed a drink right the fuck now.
-"What the fuck? Have you heard of knocking?" Draco said.
Both, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy knew that Harry could never deny Draco. Not even if it was in Draco's best interest. Because while Harry had no power over Draco,
Theo kissed him again.
AAAAACK'
new office. Which turned out to be a normal office, no cauldrons, work-tables or potions' ingredients in sight. Granger explained that the brewing rooms were located separately.
-"You know. Now, that I'm settled in at Gringotts and have a somewhat predictable work schedule I'll pop by and have lunch with you sometimes. I'd like to see how your office turned out and this kitchen and food you've been talking about, alright?" Theo whispered in the dark.
It was a cold, gray, miserable, late November day. Draco was standing in front of four, long, neat and parallel lines of seated people. They all looked up at him. They've been looking at him, for quite sometime. There were words he wanted to say. No. Words, he
Draco stood straighter, nodded to his friends signaling for them to leave. Blaise wrapped an arm around Pansy's shoulders and led her to their seats. While Theo dithered, looking scared and uncertain. It was such a foreign look on him, it slightly startled Draco. He'd have certainly felt more alarmed if things were different, but as it was, Astoria was gone. And Draco wished he were dead.
-"God?"
He'd been busy the first few days because the ministry hadn't probably had a proper potions master since before the war— busy cleaning up the potions laboratory that nobody used, writing down basic potions ingredients he might need, sending owls to the previous suppliers in Saint mungo's to cancel their contracts with the ministry since they were no longer needed, they'd certainly be happy about it since Saint Mungo's healers and mediwizards are actually overworked, Draco thought.
Except it was time to leave soon.
He hated her - hated himself.
After an awfully short period of time in Harry's opinion —about ten minutes— Harry moved to leave. Harry didn't really want to but he was sure Draco's patience and sympathy were simply an aberration, and soon he'd be glaring in disdain at Harry. And Harry really,
, understood that Harry
. Every breath felt wrong. Everything felt wrong. Because Astoria was gone.
-"Fucking hell! I don't care. Go ahead, you don't need to ask my permission."
-"There's also Theo."
-"IT'S RINGING! FINALLY. FUCKING FINALLY. THAT BITCH DAISY—"
But no matter how long he wished it. He was still...existing. Or was he? Maybe he
-"This is so weird." Harry whispered after some time.
He visibly shuddered.
-"I'm not going to lie and say I'm confortable with this new job, Theo. I'm so tired. I'm exhausted. I feel weak. So weak. I just want to crawl into bed and hide. I hate it. I hate everything. I'm in so much pain, Theo. So much pain. But the thing is you're right, all of you. Because I always feel like this ever since she died, Theo. I'm always suffering. If I were to indulge myself, I'd never leave the safety of our room. I'd never want to get out of my head. I hate my head and my own thoughts but I need them because that's the only place she exists now. She's nowhere. She's gone. The only thing I've left of her is Scorpius and almost eight years worth of memories. I can't live without her, I can't live with her." He was crying. They clearly suspected that Draco wasn't doing okey, yet knowing something so dreadful and having it confirmed were two very different things.
Harry immediately jumped to his feet.
They were real.
-"YESSSSSSS!" Draco enthusiastically nodded but stopped upon their foreheads' painful collision. "Ow! Do it again, do it again." Draco hissed.
Harry Potter then realized, that his unborn child was keeping him away from his Heaven, that he couldn't love it, be a good father to it, when his heart was carved out of his chest, leaving long jagged scars and excoriated flesh behind, and miles away from him, in a magnificent Manor in Wiltshire, right now, probably wearing fancy clothing and staring at himself in a mirror out of pure vanity, or maybe talking about how beautiful his hair is or about how much of a mean cow Pansy is, or how he would scratch Blaise's eyes out if he wore the same color as him that day, or he could be kissing Theodore Nott, or perhaps playing with Scorpius, maybe staring adoringly at his beloved Father.
-"Greg, dearest, you have nothing to worry about, we've all seen the impressive snake in your pants." Pansy said.
Sometimes Draco wouldn't be numb nor having difficulties thinking straight, he would be neither excessively tired or obsessively thinking about death.
save us all. It wasn't you. It was never you.
He'd have arrived way earlier and waited for Draco by the atrium if not for Ginny demanding they have breakfast together. She'd come home only yesterday evening so Harry hadn't wanted to tell her no.
Draco's whole body wracked with his sobs.
They both trudged down the stairs. In the kitchen, Draco sat down, while Harry searched around his muggle fridge that he'd been able to install, along with the TVs, thanks to Hermione.
-"Don't you dare—"
-"Rude. She was my aunt. She'd cared for me in her own way, taught me Occlumency, which admittedly didn't help against The Dark Lord but still. . .She was insane, she was my aunt—Mother misses her very much."
But Draco wasn't going anywhere. He'd ask the house-elves to move his things to Scorpius's room in the morning. He needed his son. He was all Draco had left from
. As Draco's sleep gradually eluded him, he opened his eyes to watch Astoria a little, maybe he'd wake her up just to be annoying. But as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, and as his senses fully awakened and sharpened, Draco Malfoy who knew his wife's body as he did his own, realized that the strong hipbone under his hand was undeniably and distinctly male. It was
-"YES!" Harry yelled. He didn't mean to yell but he did anyways.
-"Come on. Forgive me, please,"
More silence.
Draco grabbed his hand and squeezed it.
-"Oh, Potter, Théo doesn't feel lowly emotions such as jealousy or insecurity, the rest of us mere mortals feel. Theo was my first love; and I've never moved on from him. He knows it, so did Astoria. Admittedly, although he would hate for me to tell you, he'd been—we'd both been really miserable in the beginning of my marriage. We were younger, I was married but struggling with my undying feelings for him, I'd begged him to stay, stay with me, live with me, Astoria, Pansy and Greg - he'd refused. Theo had left France but he was never capable of staying away longer than a month. He'd always come back. Come back to me. And we'd hold onto each other and properly breathe again for the first time since we'd last seen one another. We'd talked about everything and anything back then except our true feelings for each other. I'd been scared, thinking I was somehow being infidel to my wife, although I loved Her. I'd felt horrible for hurting him, felt guilty for loving him, suffered greatly from being away from him. I'd cry whenever he had to leave, yet I hadn't been able to bring myself to tell him with words, how much I
-"D—"
-"You're married." Draco whispered.
Harry thought. Draco.
Draco pushed away from him when Harry's hold only tightened around him. He stood up. Harry sat up and instantly felt cold all over, and not because of the elements.
He spit water from his mouth, put his toothbrush down and leaned fully against Théo's warm chest behind him.
Hours or years later, Theo couldn't be sure, Pansy and Blaise burst in. They stopped by the bed, on the other side of Draco. At the sight of his vacant countenance, Pansy started shaking, she swayed where she stood, Blaise absently steadied her and pulled her to his side, he wasn't looking at her, no one could take their eyes away from Draco. What was left of Draco. Which was nothing, nothing at all. Draco Malfoy was seemingly dead. Breathing, yet by all means and accounts he was dead.
Astoria.
lost within his head.
-"What the hell is that supposed to mean? I killed
-"Merlin, Theo." Draco said jumping off the bed. "A month long trip! We need to go. Fucking hell. He just lost his mother—" Draco trailed off.
When I walked through heavens gates I felt so much at home.
-"We, as in the highly respectable ministry of magic—"
-"Merlin, stop asking me questions, I'm unable to keep my mouth shut anymore!"
-"Dead." He stated.
-"Yes, well, they're dead so why should he care? Can I kill him?"
What if the agony of the moment of severance never faded? And what if the same limb was cut off time after time? What if acute pain was relived over and over again? Can one live for the pain-blotting darkness of unconsciousness that comes after unbearable pain? What kind of life would that be? Pain or darkness. Pain
-"Hmmm?"
Theo plopped down on the love seat defeatedly. Blaise wordlessly followed suit while Draco stood up and pointed a finger at Pansy.
Theodore Nott had never known anything but Heaven in his life. Harry didn't know which one of them had it worse. Théo'd always had Draco and always will. But adult Theo's Heaven wasn't the same as when he'd been a child. Théo had had a chance to leave his younger self's Heaven once but he'd missed it and now he was living in a Heaven that he'd long since grown out of. It was restricting him, paining him. It had become, on its own, his Hell. He was forever stuck on what might have been.
-"I just want to be in your life. Please." He whispered, his voice came out raspy and broken.
-"Fucking hell. Ginny decorated it. We're not all the sole heir of The Malfoy, Black and Lestrange fortunes combined, Draco."
So, he'd made his way towards Malfoy promising himself not to start a duel in the middle of the party—since Hermione was just somewhere around the atrium, and he didn't particularly fancy being the recipient of her threateningly disapproving glares—and trying to convince himself that he wasn't interested in talking to Malfoy in the slightest but was simply doing his duty as an auror and sizing up a person of interest.
?" He croaked out.
-"With me, of course."
, Theo, you already have your own place."
Harry Potter sighed and stepped into a fireplace that'd take him home. He felt like shit for really not thinking about what he'd done to Draco. He felt dreadful for ever hurting Draco, but above all, he felt cold terror stabbing his heart at the thought of never being able to make it up to him.
Harry Potter had a sickening feeling, almost a premonition, that Draco was somehow wrong.
-"He'll take the job." Theo said.
-"You know I don't think Father hates you anymore. He thinks you're pathetic, I have high hopes he'll find you endearingly pathetic in no time and then you can go up from there to amusing, adorable and so forth, maybe one day he'll like you."
to, he carelessly invited Draco over for movie days, at least three times a week. Sometimes even Scorpius would join them and Harry would feel so at-ease, so happy, so warm all over...
Harry was seriously starting to believe Zabini when he'd said that Harry wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, although Zabini didn't put it as nicely and muggle-y.
-"I want you to do something for me." Draco said. They were facing each other in the neglected—the entire fucking ministry was dilapidated—dimly lit office. Draco moved closer to Harry.
Harry and Draco sat down on the sofa, facing each other, knees touching, Harry smiled at Draco, because he didn't ask what's wrong—he already knew, but instead tried to take Harry's mind off. . .ironically, his
He should have ran.
On Friday, Harry Potter spent the entire day following Draco around and arguing with himself, weighing the pros and cons of endeavoring to pick up every bit of his famous Gryffindor courage to try and convince—in other words pitifully beg Draco to not go see Emma The Doppelgänger.
It didn't make any sense to Harry.
He was met with a cloudless, dark-blue sky, a few stars here and there, glittering like Astoria's diamond-rings, muggles running around to Merlin knows where. Draco sighed, watched his breath condense and disperse away, the chilly late-February cold prickled his skin making his cheeks pink, he subtly cast a warming spell on his person. But no one was paying him any attention, they were all hurrying with their heads down looking at the tiny muggle telephones like the one Pansy had. It was a good thing Pansy was so much into muggles these days because it meant she made him carry muggle money around, and encouraged him—
The corners of Draco's lips lifted in a small, but genuine smile.
, the Healers said.
-"Break it off you idiots." Theo said, standing between them.

So Draco Malfoy needed Harry Potter after all.

through with Scorpius. Draco knew that he would break down, sob and be unable to articulate coherent words in literal minutes.
Draco would kiss him on the cheek and walk away.
Hadn't Tom Riddle charmed and deceived the best of us? Hadn't he beguiled Dumbledore himself?
Draco walked the few steps between them and wrapped his arms tightly around Théo's neck. Théo hugged him back just as tightly. They stayed like that for a while, drawing comfort from each other.
-"My worth? Have I ever had any, in your eyes, Parkison? Didn't you try to give me up to Voldemort?" Harry spat.
-"She got sick."
-"Hello, Harry. Do you like my clothes?" Scorpius asked, in an awfully adorable french accent.
Whatever.
-"Delightful. You must hate her."

-"Well. At least Scorpius likes me, right?"
, meaningless, dull, the world had become, feel a lingering sense of suffocating wanting, of despair, of being
Draco couldn't help but laugh. It came out like a weird noise since Theo had his tongue down Draco's throat. The noise was hilarious, and embarrassing if he were to utter it in front of anyone else, but this was Theo, they'd literally bathed together as babies. And...a few weeks ago. Well, not together per se, Draco had just been feeling too depressed to even breathe—
Harry felt hopelessness and despair creeping up on him, winding around his ankles, fastening them together, tying him up, shackling him down.
The air was thick with grief and despair.
Abraxas Malfoy had agreed to follow a brillant, magically extraordinarily-powerful friend, who'd wanted to rule over muggles, who'd allured him with talks of wizard supremacy, who'd promised him a much-desired world where Wizards didn't have to live in hiding, especially considering their time period. They'd went to Hogwarts from 1938 until 1945,
The following day, a Thursday, Harry Potter didn't bother with checking in with his own department and waited for Draco patiently by the door to The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, he'd debated upon his arrival earlier to wait for Draco in the atrium but he'd dithered and reluctantly admitted in the privacy of his own mind that he really, really didn't want to confront Zabini, seeing as he...slightly intimidated Harry, made him feel small and insignificant, regarded him as if he were a particularly repulsive and distasteful specimen that was indisputably unworthy of Draco. The truth was Harry felt self-conscious, increasingly-anxious and deathly-scared that Draco would grow bored and unamused with Harry and stop entertaining or tolerating Harry's constant proximity, pleading-looks, touching and undeniably problematic and burdensome feelings towards him. Add to that, the awful fact that he was practically deceiving his friends and family, and in a way, cheating on his wife. He really didn't need Zabini's contempt and revolted glare to fuck him up further. He spent the entire day with Draco, to Draco's great irritation. He rolled his eyes so much, Harry feared they'd get stuck if he kept at it any longer.
-"Come on, talk to me,"
Fucking Hell.
-"Why, yes. My muggle boyfriend showed me."
Theo smiled encouragingly at Draco and rested his chin on Draco's left shoulder. He tilted his head and brushed his nose against Draco's hair and kissed it.
-"P—"
-"Yeah...he's up to something."
Silence.
Harry entered the huge department and walked for a little while to Hermione's office, she'd said Draco's was right next to hers, directly in front of the children's playroom. Not that Harry cares. Fuck. Malfoy was standing right there, leaning gracefully on the door frame, talking to the kids. He wasn't whispering. His pale, blond strands were cascading down his shoulders, they were thick, shiny, lush, Luscious—where the bloody fuck did that come from? Probably out of envy, since unlike Malfoy, Harry had an unruly mop on his head. But he was so incongruous, so conspicuous, so different, so enthralling—Harry walked up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, accidentally brushing his fingers against Draco's hair. Harry couldn't help but gasp at its otherworldliness. It was so much better up close, Harry wished he could properly touch it, run his fingers through it—and then he remembered it was
But Astoria's blood-curse made no promises, left no room for hope. He'd had to hopelessly watch the thing he loved most weaken and die.
-"I'm sure they weren't that bad," Draco said.
-"Quite odd, indeed. Was it you, Uncle Lucy, dearest? haven't you mentioned how you're utterly incapable of forming two words in English—Pardon, in Italian? However will you find who you're looking for amidst
-"Draco I promise you I did not—"
Harry raised his hands in surrender and acknowledgement, because Draco had a point.
Draco, Scorpius and Zabini walked out of the elevator into the atrium to head home. Harry watched as Draco saw him, groaned and picked up his pace walking to the farthest fireplace from Harry. Zabini's smirk was different. It was evil but, like, its evil was directed at Draco instead; moments later Harry understood why. As Harry ran towards Draco and Draco ran towards the fireplace, Zabini with Scorpius in his arms shoved Draco out of the way and stepped into the fireplace Draco was about to use. Harry reached him just as a cackling Zabini and a disapprovingly frowning Scorpius vanished in green flames.
When Draco was done, he nudged Harry away but he wouldn't budge. Draco sighed.
" He screamed.
-"You said I'm your boyfriend."
Draco grinned.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh Merlin.
Draco gaped some more.
Ron was cornered, outnumbered, unarmed for his wand was still up his sleeve, and out-skilled because these were trained Death Eaters who'd always done better in school than Harry or Ron.
-"Let me go home. Don't you fucking understand? You're the last person I want to be with right now. You disregard my wishes, I tell you no, you hear yes. You follow me, spy on me, force yourself on me, insult me, take away my fucking wand, forcibly kiss me. Who the fuck do you think you are?!"
He knew that the house-elves weren't back for a reason, which was probably that they were caught by Lucius and that if Harry kept at it, Lucius would greet him next time, which Harry really, really, really didn't want to happen. If Zabini made him feel less, Lucius made him feel like a slimy, stupid and pathetic slug that was only alive as long as it continued to amuse Lucius with it's slow-moving wading through life and would obviously be neutralized and stomped on as soon as it no longer held his interest. Lucius Malfoy made you believe the world revolved around him, and if you were part of his little circle, you won the jackpot at life, otherwise, find the nearest bridge and end your miserable existence. Now, ordinarily, Harry would never seek the presence of such a cruel, narcissistic man, except Harry was madly in love with his son. Fuck.
-"KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS!" Blaise and Pansy chanted, loudly.
-"REALLY?"
-"Harry no." Ron warned.
-"It looks different now. More...hmm, cheap? Or what do you people like to say? Cozy. Yes, homey and cozy and other words with similar suffixes. Ugly sounds about right too."
Theodore Nott.
-"What do you think?" Draco whispered harshly through his erratic sobs. "If I'd truly fucking known what it would do to me to lose her, I'd have run away with Theo after the war and never looked back. It's the truth. I hate myself for it sometimes—she's given me Scorpius. And there's absolutely nothing, no one,  I love more than my child. But it's true. If I could go back, if I could forget it all, not know of my son, I wouldn't want to know her."

-"Italy?"
Pansy Parkinson was dressed in a silky, long, dark-green, backless dress, with a tightly coiled, golden snake holding it together at the center of her back. Blaise Zabini was dressed, unsurprisingly in everyone's opinion, in a very tight, black, designer muggle suit. It was probably the compromise he and Pansy had settled on for his earlier insolence. The couch would have to wait for another night. Maybe even tonight, for the night was still young.
-"See? do you see what I was telling you, Draco? He literally brings it up all the time. I thought I made him feel guilty and contrite. I thought he'd be self-recriminating and seeking penance, but fucking look at him! Im sure he cries to sleep, but

-"I need him with me at all times. He makes me feel better." Draco said quietly.

Draco seemed amused, but Harry didn't believe what he saw in Draco's face anymore, not since he'd seen him preform accidental fucking magic.
