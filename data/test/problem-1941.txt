They spend ages laying lazily in bed, watching the patch of sunlight through the window tell time across the walls like a sundial. What felt like the last barrier in their easy companionship had disappeared, and they lay together without care for personal space, more of them touching than not, as if to make up for lost time.
“You feel it,” Harry says. “I can tell. It’s that
Merlin, he wants to get this over with.
“My god, you’re brilliant, the next Sherlock Holmes! Man alive!”
“Erg,” he says.
Blaise snorted. “Do you
“But anyhow, how’s work, darling?”
He wants to impress upon Harry that he can barely grasp that any of this has happened. That he’d thought of this, in his weakest moments, but never with the imagination that it could come true. Not, at least, until last week, from which point it’s been an almost constant train of thought in the back of his mind. That already, still hot and breathless, it wasn’t enough. He hadn’t prepared for Harry to have such an immeasurable effect on him.
“What? Oh, right. Sorry.”
“It’s a bookstore? Public property.”
“When you’re not around, it’s so boring.”
*****
Harry’s face is solemn, his voice toneless like an angry parent. “Draco, can we talk, please.”
A centre section of Harry’s curls might be held in a small tie, but he thinks he could give Draco two braids at least past his ears with minimal fly-aways. He’d gotten Pansy to trim it once since they’d been friends, before it could reach a ‘Lucius-adjacent’ length, as he’d described it to Harry.
More surprising in the early light was that his hair was a mess in the back from tossing and turning, that he slept on his stomach with his head smashed into the pillow facing Harry, his mouth wide open, that his long legs had completely taken over the foot of Harry’s side of the bed. Lovely, still.
He nods into her hair.
“Merlin’s saggy—” Hermione elbows Ron before he can finish the thought, though she looks equally stunned.
“Not an issue. Although his professionalism was rather off-putting. As if we didn’t spend all of school loathing each other.”
“What the
Draco's not wrong about Marlon Brando...
“Sure,” Draco busies himself with a hand that drifts through Harry’s curls as though he himself is perfectly composed.
“You were angry with Draco when you left,” Teddy starts.
“I’m excited that you’re here,” he was saying, “Even if you’ve given up Jab for the day, because I diagnosed the necklace, and it’s more amazing than whatever you’re imagining. I know why the magic was traced so strong without being a curse, and it has you written all over it. Well, as in you, especially, are going to die for this research, I—so what—wow—Merlin, you look… why are you… wow.”
Draco watches him leave as if he’s surprised to receive just as much alone time as promised, but to Harry, this is the most important feature of the trip. This is what makes it a success.
I did it more for Harry than for you.”
She pats his hand. “I know.”
“Welcome in!” A keen shopkeeper greets him as he enters. It’s a weekday, and there are only a few customers. “Looking for anything in particular?”
The interest in Draco’s face flickers briefly into something else, greater and complex, and Harry takes a deep breath, sobered by the solemnity. And then his wrist feels too cold—Draco has let go, exposed his flesh to the air’s chill again, and he has a strange thought of
A minute even before
“I didn’t know it was required to run through the five W’s and an H every time you’ve asked a question.”
The Junior Auror he was once upon a time wouldn’t have even left the Ministry without requesting backup. The Auror he was last year would stop here instead of even
“I’m not a student,” Harry shrugs, “seemed sensible. Not my problem if you have a heat stroke in September.”
“We’re not,” Hermione adds quickly. “We’re just making sure, given the facts we have; he was alone at your flat the night before the curse was instigated, and we’ve never known his whereabouts for the others. He’s had

in his left hand for light reading, until night falls. The evidence boxes Harry had left remain untouched. Slowly, as the cauldron simmers down, so does his anger.
Harry purses his lips but accepts his answer. After confirming too many times that Draco needs nothing else, he sets a glass of water beside him and reclaims his spot above him on the couch.
Hermione’s case had been a yearlong process, during which Ron had taken on many nights of putting Rose to bed alone and losing his wife to the library. A win would mean rights for non-Being creatures with sentience like Centaurs to seek medical care at the hospital. It would be precedent-setting.

way. Like a snow day. Or peppermint. Sharp. Like… like the whistle of an arrow,” he says into the silence of the room. He pieces his words together slowly, thoughtfully, like he’s translating from a foreign language. “Almost… insidiously quiet. Precise—dangerously so, or… like that last breath before you release a bowstring?” he whispers. “It’s… patient. Unmissable.”
“See you around, Harry,” he says, and that’s clearly the cue to leave, so Harry reaches down for his bag and slings it over his shoulder.

jealous of Jack,” he says. He twists on Draco’s next lunge, stopping him from cementing a hold around his waist, and they pull back to run it routinely.
Harry groans and closes his eyes again. The room is spinning horribly. “Tell me you’re okay.”
“We’ll go to St. Mungo’s,” Harry says to the wife, a caring hand on Leonard’s shoulder. “He shouldn’t side-along but there’s a floo in the building.”
“Agh, shit, the speech,” Harry grimaces.
He lowers his arms from their bent position, stretched behind his head, not sure what to say.
More than her detached, dependable assessment, the almost-pitying look she’s granting him now is hard to accept. It’s exemplary of exactly why the Dark Mark is his magnum opus, just as exemplary as how he feels when he closes his eyes and sees Harry delicately tracing the Dark Mark. It doesn’t matter what others think. Not if his editor pities him or Harry doesn’t. He hates it, and that’s enough to cause problems.
When Ron leaves again he falls back on the couch in a slump, letting himself react to the aches and pains that he’d sat rigidly through for the past half hour. His head is killing him, as is the introspection that he’d felt the need to look healthy and invulnerable to a man who’d been first on the scene to his underdressed personal emergency just yesterday.
jump.”
“I thought your speech was going great!” Neville objects with a cheerful smile. To Harry, this seems generous. “Your true talents are wasted in the Auror Department.”
“Alright, no ‘please’. Come.”
The head nods gratefully and vanishes. The fire immediately smokes out. Harry almost disapparates without remembering why he’d been putting his shoes on to begin with.
“Fantastic. I’ll tidy the gym. Come over as soon as you’re ready.” He leaves through the study fireplace and Draco throws his head into his hands, sure his face is more red than not.
’,” he offers, mouth tipping up conspiratorially. “I’m sure it was nothing, though.”
They do, and as the two men huff it up the stairs, they catch muffled team introductions by the young Wood.
“That’s when you knew it wasn’t working.”
He’s wandering down the hallway, aiming past the study and the kitchen and the toilet to the rooms he’s never seen, suddenly caught up in his earlier wish to know every corner of Draco’s life. He’s drawn magnetically, heart still speeding from his brush with almost loneliness.
Orsix hoots from his post on the dining room chair.
“We’d have to wait a bit after I submit this evidence to avoid suspicion that we’ve discovered anything,” he mumbles to himself again. Draco watches him in full calculation mode. It’s his favourite—an inward gaze, fingers drumming on the table, his other hand running across his lips in concentration. “
“Honestly, no. But for his
Draco nods.
! Red card for sure!”
Still, the nervous excitement of a new chapter in his life can’t quite soften the strange blow he’s feeling today, at the idea of losing the bright spot his best friend offered at a job he’s increasingly growing to resent.
“Ah, that leads to the second discovery I didn’t add to the form.” He puts the book back in with the evidence and lowers the shield. “I fixed the dating spell. The book was cursed days in advance, but the flowers were cursed
, darling,” she tells him gently, patting his arm. “I think it’s good to stand out.”
“Draco Malfoy!” He freezes. “Did Harry leave you on your own before he’d even gotten you through a round of introductions? Isn’t he a rude one.” Molly Weasley is walking towards him even as she beckons him forward with her hands. She’s smiling, which is nice, and she’s already insulted Harry, which is nice, too.
“Mum couldn’t think of any relation. I couldn’t either. But it seems likely, doesn’t it? That it’s a pattern? Or am I being narcissistic?”
He lifts his head. Her eyes are soft, and for the first time, he notices the messiness of her own attire, the red under her own fingernails. She’s dressed for the office, her hair pulled back into a quick top knot. Whatever there is worth saying, she’s more than earned it. With a sigh, she turns to face him directly and places her hands on his upper arms with a firm grip.
“It’s just enjoyable to see something different.”
Monday morning finds Harry preparing for an inevitable verbal spar with Malfoy in a way he knows works best—physical sparring, or at least wailing on a punching bag at Jab Gym. He’d woken early, restless, to searing golden light shining through the crack in his curtains and, acutely aware of the difficult task set before him today, scowled at its beauty.
“It’s wonderful,” he murmurs, eyes still glued to the view. Immediately, he drops his work on the table in front of it and begins to unpack, so Harry takes both their bags upstairs to the bedroom. It makes him think of their last trip, with its two double beds and the crippling fear he’d experienced when he thought he’d have to share. He’d have it no other way, now.
Draco says nothing. He can’t find any words. He wishes he’d left, even as Harry yelled after him.
Draco looks at him carefully, that same look in his eyes that leads Harry to believe that there’s What He Says and, separately, What He Thinks.

marry in this dream? Some tall blonde Veela that’s made all the parents jealous?” he asks, wiggling his eyebrows.
This, unfortunately, is met with their Keeper missing two goals, and by the time Blaise returns with a second round, England is so far behind that their half-attentive chatting has transformed into a full conversation about Pansy’s consideration to switch careers entirely and give up radio broadcasting for something “much more appreciative of my beauty.”
They speak at once.
“You could stay,” Draco says, catching his wrist.
“…Are you just angry?” he asks softly. “Are you frustrated?”
*****
He blinks in surprise. “Thank you, Mari. That means a great deal. Do you… ever feel like the slowness of all the bureaucracy just ruins your case?”
“Flitwick?” he prompts.
Meanwhile, his own gaze drifts back to the collar of Harry’s dress shirt, buttoned high, and wonders what occasion called for it. Almost mindlessly, his hand reaches over to the stiff band and fusses with it gently.
He hasn’t slept well the last two nights, hardly at all, and it shows in his eyes and the rings of purple under them. There’s a dark shadow underlining his jaw that he usually remembers to shave. His hair is getting especially unruly, too. He’s been too busy to consider any routine maintenance, and with a twist of embarrassment, he sees himself fake-smiling at Hermione looking like this.
She smiles and he can tell that she doesn’t believe him.
“We were a force.”
“I don’t know.”
It’s hard not to feel content with the feeling of Harry against him so fresh and the smell of spices and the sound of the kitchen radio slowly seeping into the living room. Draco’s been refused exit until Harry’s cooked him dinner, so he’s sat with a book from his potioneer friend,
Her expression is genuine, full of love that he hopes he’s reciprocating, and his smile builds slowly as he fills her in. It’s a history lesson, regurgitating his family’s entire timeline, from the earliest mentions of their lives in Tamil Nadu, through Delhi, to England, to his grandparents. He explains how much work it was to piece together an unbiased story, and how Ron had given him an invaluable book to help him just after the Three Broomsticks night where they’d last seen each other.
The radio fades out and he’s confident that this briefly picturesque moment is dying with it, but Draco holds him close and he hears him suck in a breath when the beginning brassy notes of ‘The Way You Look Tonight’ chime in.
“This is completely unofficial, make yourself at home,” he clarifies in response. She’s watching him with careful concern. “I’m doing some inquiries related to the case, but I’d like to keep it highly confidential in this environment. Given the nature of the curse…”
“Well
Ron joins in from his other side. “Look, you and I will go tomorrow. We’ll sort out your hunch about Murray, see if we can find anything on him before he knows we know. Malfoy’s in holding, so… he’ll be alright, so long as he can handle spending the night in a room that shares a toilet and bed with little privacy.”
to the
Draco is almost hanging off the bed when he wakes the next morning, his face halfway past the mattress, an arm dangling through the blankets toward the floor, and Harry is tucked against him, an arm flung over Draco’s back while his side of the bed lays cold and empty. He groans a little at the ache of his muscles and immediately feels movement beside him.
He’s just closing his locker and zipping up his knapsack when Jack arrives, looking surprisingly disappointed to see him.
She grins, and Harry is filled, not for the first time, with so much pride for her successes that he’s hit with a dormant pang of sadness for the loss of their relationship. Ginny turns her gaze onto him, a quick glance up and down.
Draco nods curtly as the chess pieces get in formation. “Nice set.”
Harry shrugs. He needs a distraction, without discussing Draco at all. And he misses Ron. Seeing his friend solves both.
Draco looks murderous, stuck in silence, his eyes flitting between them as they speak. Harry tries to catch his gaze, but he glides past his face too quickly every time.
“Oh yes, it’s about time we turn the tables on idolatry around here,” she laughs, and it’s all in good fun. Harry chuckles too.
“HAR—“ he hears. Then absolutely nothing else.
Blaise had brought a few books over, a notepad, a pair of reading glasses Harry had never seen nor imagined would exist, and he spends a lot of time scribbling things down while glancing at the list from Draco. The black eye and cut, while unfortunate, could help them in court, he says bitterly, as will the libel of the newspaper article, if argued properly.
“I don’t know…” Harry surprises himself with uncertainty, despite having thoughts similar to Ron’s while standing in the holding room with the man in question. “I’d be pretty on edge if I saved a woman’s life and then got arrested for it because some wand-ready Aurors were judging me for my past.”
She turns her lips down in a pout. “’Potter’s Auror training is really toning his body’—“
isn’t very threatening.
Harry looks sceptical of this. Draco understands. It feels certifiable to walk away right now. Blaise would be incensed to hear such a thing. He briefly wonders if leaving will kill the momentum. Let Harry rethink and regret. But he really does have a Portkey leaving in under half an hour, and his mother is daunting.
“And there will be questions.”
He waits for the retort, another scowl, but Draco decides rather suddenly to hide his face by turning away and setting his mug down on his bedside table. Only after a few moments does he turn back but, hands free of anything to fidget with, he pulls at his sleeve. Without thinking, Harry reaches out and settles a hand over his fiddling ones. Draco’s fingers are cold.
Draco follows his finger to see her at the tail end of a chase out the window; Victoire following Teddy, Teddy following Harry, Harry following Rose, whose short legs were slowing the entire chase to a crawl.
She gifts him one of her rare but warm smiles, looking hardly a day older than when he’d last seen her, sometime during the trials. She’d stood tall, confidently speaking of—no, ordering—clemency for every school-aged Slytherin. Despite everyone promising him that his testimony was incomparably influential, he’d found it near impossible to follow her. He could think of no one better suited to lead a school with the best interest of all her students in mind.
Draco looks towards him, his wrinkled brow and a quickly deepening frown, his gaze frozen to the bathroom floor. He lays his arm across Harry’s shoulders and pulls him closer, pressing his lips to his head.
“You lost
“No! No, and I didn’t say anything. I was at Finsbury Park with Rosie and all of the sudden there he was jogging past us. I’d know that blonde ponytail anywhere.”
” he asks again.
He turns to point the girls out to Pansy but she’s already acquired her target and is pressing a mysteriously procured drink in his hand like a hostage exchange for her company. She kisses his cheek before leaving his side to weave through the mob.
In the phone booth, he holds back a smile at Draco’s appalled look, watching him pin the Ministry guest badge to his coat for him, but the somberness returns when they open into the bustling main Ministry hall. Draco’s chin rises higher, and only Harry from so close beside him can see the last deep breath he draws in and out through his nose. His stare is stony, eyes steadfastly set on the lift, and only once the doors of the lift close and leave them unaccompanied does his chest cave again.
. Were tailing
By the lockers, though, Harry sees a familiar figure walk by. It’s not even seven in the morning so he’s almost convinced that it’s not him. He’s seeing ghosts everywhere, he decides, thanks to this weird phase of his personal life and the lack of sleep it’s included, so he just stows his things and walks towards the weights.
“Just wait till they hear I’ve quit.”
“Alright.” She sighs and looks up from her work fully. “
Draco tears his eyes away from her sad ones, wishing they could visit once and have nothing worth mentioning but the weather.
“Are you alright?” He nods, despite the warm feeling on the back of his neck, the searing on his arm and his side, the throb of his nose, the ache everywhere else. “I got your Patronus, and then half the team got a warrant to investigate Bode’s office while we came here. I’m glad you contacted me.”
He supposes, now that a curse has been cast at a Hogwarts-affiliated event where he was speaking, it would look unseemly not to hand over to him. Murray cares for status more than anything, and he’s still watching, waiting perhaps for the fact that Harry’s reputation is on the line to persuade him against Malfoy’s release. Instead, Harry breaks their eye contact with a tight nod and turns for the door without another word.
“Yes, I’ve got everything I need,” he says, a hand running through the other man’s hair. It’s gotten long again, and he’s been trying to find a way to say he’d loved it short just as much. “Now who’s worried.”
” he somehow yells in a whisper. “I could’ve—“
“That’s simply not true. We shouldn’t be sitting around waiting for more people to get
There’s no sign off this time. He doesn’t need one. Harry already recognises the loopy script, indicative of a plush childhood with activities like penmanship classes, and he runs back upstairs for the initial note, which he slides into his back pocket.
“That you invited
“Oh, that’s
The default smile drops from Jack’s face, and he puts weight back on the leg he had folded up to stretch behind him. He leans close to Harry by the edge of the ring.
“Yeah, well. There haven’t been any girls since,” Draco says. “So question answered.”
As he finishes, he glances at Harry with a glint in his eye, and there’s that perfect light-speed conversation he knew they were capable of. He’s buzzing with intensity, and Harry doesn’t need to be told that it’s time. When ‘
“…It was just some messing about, if you must know,” Harry says, voice lowered to an almost-whisper. “At the gym—“
The Four Johns is unsurprisingly crowded for a Friday evening, and Harry begins to worry that he won’t be able to find a seat for himself. He clutches
Now Harry looks truly sour. “You’re
“Didn’t ask.”
“Feeling for one cursed book was an emergency, but I can’t sit around all day doing the Ministry’s job. They have the tonics.”
!” Harry enthuses as he sets him back down.
“Of course I wanna know.”
After a minute of scribbling, Draco sweeps the book and papers into his arm and drops them on the rug in front of Harry. He levitates the skull over, too, and sets it between them as he settles in on the floor. Harry sits quiet. Patient.

“I think I
“The hunger is the curse,” he explains. “It’s that pit in your stomach.”
“What?” Draco and Teddy say in unison.
. And I’m the one who needs to communicate better? Huh?”
When the green fire falls back to ash, Draco collapses into his reading chair. It’s impossible that he’s only been up for six or so hours; he feels disproportionately exhausted. Tonight felt like a flashbang. Like he’d accidentally hit a switch, and he wishes he could knock the switch back, just for a night, and deal with its confusion tomorrow.
“Painful but uneventful. No less than five people asked if I was in fancy dress.”
If you can't handle me at my exposition, you don't deserve me at my enemies to lovers slow build romance... In all seriousness, no worries—most chapters won't cover the exact same events. We'll press on, what's Harry up to?
“Do me and yourself a favour and keep your mouth shut when we pass Murray,” Harry instructs when they stop at the door, praying he’ll get no backchat.
“I’ll never get used to seeing you looking this athletic,” she says, taking the offered glass that he pours.
He tells him about knocking into the toiletries while checking the water temperature, about how he had about five seconds to feel his hand start burning and his vision begin tunnelling, and how the last two were spent trying to shout Harry’s name.
“Everyone needs Pansy points,” Harry and Blaise say in unison. They turn to each other and grin.
They emerge from the travel building onto a manicured garden in New Delhi’s governmental centre and the heat hits like a wall. It’s a sharp contrast to London’s dropping temperatures, and Harry stands still for a moment and closes his eyes to soak up the sun.
When Draco turns back to him, he expects a challenge for framing a solo picture of him, but he says nothing. The docility takes Harry by surprise. Maybe he’s feeling like the friendship is too fragile to say such a thing. It’s a shame, really—Harry had an entire rebuttal prepared.
“Erm, well with the evidence results, I… there’s work I should get done at the office. So maybe I’ll just see you Wednesday, send Orsix with the details.”
“I was just thinking,” Harry tells him easily. “My favourite and least favourite thing about us is how good we are at not talking.”
“Tell them what? That you’re gay?”
“This didn’t count, obviously. I didn’t know.”
His mouth quirks up as Draco talks, hands running down his hips distractedly. “Is that so?”
Harry smiles graciously. “It was fine, Draco did well.”
Grimmauld Place lasted two nights. It was nightmarish. He tried to cook, one of his few newfound joys, but the kitchen felt full of ghosts. He couldn’t walk the halls without running into Kreacher, and he couldn’t
His opponent clicks his tongue. “Rook to d8. Checkmate.”
“You two look radiant there.” She’s pointing to the picture of Harry and Hermione dancing at her wedding, spinning and looking overjoyed.
“The warding was… more advanced than I thought she wanted. The property was massive. And then—Can I come in? It’s important.”
.” Harry drives them towards the nearest wall, Draco leaning right beside the coatrack, lips already on his neck, and he can feel the urgency, the desperation in his breath against his throat.
and ‘
Such cheerfulness should be off-limits, Harry thinks crankily, especially when he’s barely gotten both feet off the lift and onto the Auror department floor, but he smiles back at Cassie anyway. He’d barely made it to work at all—travelling with a morose determination to focus on the case; where he’d been dissuaded by bureaucratic challenges before, he’s now feeling positively defeated. Still, he

“Aw, you’re too kind,” she says to his right.
“Well, I’m happy for you both about nothing at all,” he offers.
Hung in a fittingly old frame he’d found at a charity shop is the Potter family photo, beside it a triptych-looking frame with three photos from India; Harry and Pratik at the Potter store counter, Harry and Draco smiling stiffly in the store’s façade, and in the centre a picture of just Draco in the rowboat, his linen sleeves rolled to the elbow, hair blowing slightly in the occasional breeze, and face in profile staring beautifully and stoically out to the water. When he’d come home from their fight, heart still beating and body tense, he’d stood in front of it and pictured the quiet rowing in India until he felt the fight leave his body.
He lifts his chin high at his name, shoulders back as she approaches, hexes his wand from his hand, and produces a binding spell to tie his wrists behind his back. “You’re under arrest for five counts of attempted murder. You do not have to say anything. Anything you do say may be given in evidence…”
When Draco walks back over, he sees
When he opens one eye to sneak a look, Draco’s face is lit dimly by his wand hovering over the book, and he licks the tip of a finger to turn the page. Harry sighs in contentment at the day and at Draco before he can stop himself and quickly snaps his eyes shut when Draco’s head begins to turn. After a count of thirty, he opens them again, but Draco is still staring right back. Harry closes his eyes again.
“You know, they say she and Vita…”
Ron scoffs. “You are all mad—I have to count it as the Hogwarts gala.”
“Typical,” he mumbles, not the least bit surprised anymore.
Harry blinks, caught off guard.
“My looks stopped a
Harry’s eyes sparkle at the validation. “I knew you would. Now again.”
“Harry. Fine, thank you. Tough case,” he adds boringly, for lack of better conversation topics.

“I love when you say that.”
“Face the bag, then?”
you are second to none.“ Draco rolls his eyes at this. “Besides,” Harry adds, flashing a smile. “There’s a party this afternoon.”
“Another round?” is all he asks, easiness in his voice.
“Pardon?”
“Yeah,” he responds faintly.
Thanks for reading!
His eyes widen and Harry grins as he switches the oven on for a late lunch. He’s caught him in a game of chess. One where he knows his opponent too well to lose; forfeit his strangely gallant need for an equilibrium of favours or take a trip to Jab. He’d bet money on his choice.
considered assault. You might like to try it, or at least see it.”
He hesitatingly then firmly pats Draco on the knee under the table, a gesture of support, and stands. “Off to the gents,” he announces, abandoning his newest friend to his two oldest.
“How far did you run this morning?” he questions into Harry’s chest.
“What?” Harry quirks the right side of his mouth up to match his drowsily screwed shut right eye.
It’s a tad cooler in the shadow of the mangroves, but they’re both still sticky with sweat when they reemerge into the sun and Draco beaches them on a small island shaded in coconut groves. He removes his life jacket and pulls out sandwiches and waters.
Draco leans in even closer, making Harry’s breath catch in his throat. They’re too close. He resists the urge to flinch, to move. Then, Draco pulls back.
He had thought he knew what Harry would act like. Hurried, he guessed, and spontaneous like he was on the Quidditch pitch. Or mouthy and confident like he is in the ring, and indeed, there’s a confidence, an adept way with which he moves his body. But mostly, he is quiet and incredibly perceptive, as though the same skilful observation he’s used to attune himself to the smallest twitch or movement in an opponent is useful now, and with every shudder or gasp he seems to log it away. And he talks, but it’s not cheeky. It’s whispers in Draco’s ear, asking if something is alright, telling him he’s wonderful, responding to what Draco says.
He leans back to prop the door open for her and she screeches past them, the crown falling to her neck like a necklace. Now, they sit alone across from each other on a purple rug covered in fairies.
By now, Draco is chewing on his lip with absentminded anxiety.
Harry laughs bitterly. “Anything to get my contentious love affair out of the headlines.”
He grants her a small smile and almost says something else just before the pub doors open again and the rest of their small group spills out.
“Murray is on the sheet, sir. I wasn’t here.”
Still, he feels a bit emasculated by the truth tugging at his memory, as he walks the empty midday hall towards the Charms classroom. In reality, he’d been decaying wandless in a holding cell. And if anyone had ‘defended his honour,’ regretfully, it was Potter.
“Me too,” says Harry, sitting next to her. “Have you eaten, Draco?”
“Or alternatively, the moral is ‘Don’t fall in love with another woman and let your Patronus give you up’.”
can hear the warmth in his voice but Ron bristles. Hermione seems undecided and challenges him back. She lifts her chin.
Malfoy looks up from the file, a face of casual consideration, then back down nonchalantly. “Possibly. I’d need the silverware, and the book if you wanted. And I couldn’t make any promises.”
“The story my
“No, I mean, it’s brilliant, Hermione. You’re so good at this.”
And that
! I knew you would.
“The storefront in those photos is the old Potter shop from when my family was still over there.”
“Alright then, swot?” Blaise would say, tossing whatever book Draco’d requested from Flourish and Blotts his way and collapsing onto the settee.
Of course, they’re apprehensive that there’s any way to fight a corrupt authority figure at the Ministry—especially if the Head Auror and his number two are both involved. Harry’s offering of the parchment list to Blaise had seemed to spark hope, but the optimism doubles when he mentions Hermione’s interest in helping.
“Must I have a reason?”
“Oh, Kreacher’s going to love you,” Harry says.
Harry sets everything down on his bedside table. “Just for breakfast.”
“No, well, you know what I mean. You have Rose and—“
But mostly it was thinking about Harry’s declaration carrying across his home, voice pained and broken and calling, “Good people don’t walk away.” He tucks the book away on his desk and turns back to that same man.
“Auror Shohre,” Harry says.
Harry feels a familiar flutter of love for the game when they turn into the pitch—he can see the lines of freshly manicured grass on the field, hear the croaking of the steps leading to the stands on either side of them, and if he closes his eyes, he can almost feel the thickness of Quidditch robes sit on his shoulders.
Draco peeks in the paper bag, smiling when he spies three chocolate croissants. The boxes hold, unsurprisingly, the cursed gifts from last week, but there’s one missing: a mysteriously wrapped package addressed to Harry. For now, he’ll have to start with the bouquet and chocolates from reception.
“He said he doesn’t bite his prey, he… chews excessively. But that he wouldn’t chew us.”
He takes in a raggedy breath that he hopes is quiet, feeling his ears heat, and clears his throat quickly. Platonic. Friends. The Blaise Method: watch him puke, watch him get a girl. Why had he been so quick to offer his hangover cure?
The curry is delicious, even cold, as though it’s been made with love.
“—of balance is the fulcrum to overturn him. I know.”
“Can you picture Rose in a little England kit? On a little broom?”
Jesus, today was long.
“About that,” Harry starts. “Does it matter
“I don’t think a dead grandparent requires admission.”
Harry’s attended a few events in the Ministry ballroom, but it has never looked like this; the usual dark mahogany walls and tall, coffered ceilings are affixed with Hogwarts regalia from all four houses and several beautifully gilded Hogwarts crests. The podium, too, on the raised stage that stands against a curtained partition, holds the Hogwarts insignia alongside the Mind Healers for Survivors emblem.
“And what did you think?” Harry asks.

He folds it in his fist, closes his eyes, and traces it, just to feel the comfortably unique power built into its spellwork.
“It answers to you, though. So does Kreacher.”
“Potter?” he calls. “Potter!”
“Obviously,” Draco mutters, closing the door behind him. He’s performatively unhappy, face pinched, stature impatient. Harry considers drawing it out just a tad longer, but it’s been hard to keep a secret as it is.
“Breakfast?” he mumbles.
Draco tilts his head robotically. “Someone like who,
“Anything what?”
“Wonderful,” Draco mutters, head dropped down to the path in front of them.
There’s an anxious part of Harry deeper down that whispers a greater fear; that Draco has a problem with who he is, innately. He can admit to himself, in a moment already heavy with vulnerability, that he shouldn’t get too attached to Draco so long as he’s still piecing together whether he can be comfortable with a friend like Harry. He stares hazily down at the spot where Draco’s shoe had been a moment ago.
?” Harry splutters.
“It was a skin-stretching curse, sir, wasn’t it?” Harry’s head tilts innocently. “Those can’t be cast. They’re brewed and applied to an object. Over days.”
Harry wills his brain to quiet, but it’s as if it’s out of his control, and he’s thinking of his own body, the slats of a locker digging into his back, the sound of their breathing, their kissing, their moving, fearing that his breath smells, that he’s a bad kisser, that someone will walk in, what he’ll say when they pull apart, whether he’ll have time to shower before work.
“We went through a war,” Hermione continues. “So did he. And we came out on the other side, damaged of course, but not permanently marked as the horrid thing our parents required us to become. However far we’ve climbed to escape our associations with Voldemort for newer, better things—“
. Or you’re receiving no further intel.”
. He’s practically shagging for two!”
Draco thinks back to how tetchy he was in the holding cell, assuming Potter was there to rub salt in the wound. How quickly he’d turned sour when Potter asked for his help. He hadn’t given the man much reason to think he’s changed.
,” her mother chides, looking entirely embarrassed to be having this conversation in front of Harry.
”—Draco rolls his eyes—“for the night. Drumroll, please…”
Draco manages to keep sight of her long enough to clock the visible change in her features and watch the blood slowly levitate off the floor and back towards her flesh, which is slowly seaming itself back together, before his wand shoots from his hand and an Incarcerous spell hits him square in the chest.

“Of course.”
In the reflection of the teapot’s silver exterior, he swiftly fixes his hair again, tucks his shirt back in, and checks that his sleeves are rolled down. Even though she’s his mum, Draco hopes she hasn’t seen his forearm. He winces in memory of the way her face would plummet upon catching a glimpse of his mark. In those early years of recovery in the Manor, especially, the sight could cause a serious emotional setback. Privately, he thinks seeing it prolonged her disappointment in him, as well.
A snort, from directly to Harry’s right. He turns to the seat normally occupied by Ron, but the man seated there is looking intently at the quill and planner on the table before him.
“Fine then, go ahead. I’m listening.”
He tries not to look as disappointed as he feels. Instead, he opens the front door for Harry, whose hands are full of dangerous items. The man turns in the doorway and balances the boxes on one raised knee to fix his glasses.
that I think you couldn’t bag—“
And still another part of him questions whether the tensions that had led to such a fight ran deeper—that it was less about the unhealthy amount of time they’d begun spending together without opening up any deeper to compensate. He thinks, sadly, as he steps under the water, that it might just be proof that they’re not as good for each other as the best-case scenario had got him thinking. If it was fate that brought them back together, how was he to question the fate that’s knocked them back out of alignment?
At this, Narcissa nods seriously, raising her chin in pride at her son’s importance. She’s already walking to the door as she says, “Never mind, I must be off regardless.” She kisses him once on each cheek and sweeps a hand across his hair behind his ear.
people tend to want after they split up.”
“Doing alright right now.”
“That’s a lot of books,” he says after a minute, nodding to one of the bedside tables. Draco follows his eyes.
The crisis he’d walked into had banished the thought from his mind but he ponders now, as he applauds himself for a so-far upstanding and properly friendly afternoon, whether the curiousness of that stag had been the first chip into dismantling the predetermined version of Harry Potter that he’d so stubbornly built up.
Harry writes quickly. “Do you know anything else?”
, the dedication reads.
Only now, following him back through the pub, does he notice Harry’s entire table watching them. He’s sure that if he looked back, his friends would be doing the same. A few people are sitting on one side of the garden so Harry walks the opposite way, until they’re out of earshot and mostly out of sight. Only then does he turn back, arms crossed.
Harry and Teddy both turn to him, so he hesitantly steps further into the room. The nine-year-old walks confidently up to him.
“Lucrezia Bode. As in daughter of Broderick Bode?”
Blaise sets his hand on Draco’s other shoulder, and he suddenly feels embarrassed and a bit pitying for Harry, like he’s been ganged up on. Blaise is just trying to be a good friend, though, and Pansy is doing the same, which in ignorance of their updated conflict involves being warm and open to Draco’s new friend.
“Wine?”
Satisfied, he begins to move about the kitchen, tapping his wand on the kettle, finding what he can to make breakfast. He keeps glancing at Harry. He’s melted into his propped-up hands on the table, eyes shut. Draco’s not sure if he’s sleeping or not. Last night, he’d been drunkenly flushed with colour and heat, but this morning he looks pallid.
Draco’s mad at him. Harry is almost positive. He’s been present, but extremely quiet, which—under the rules of
“Come in.”
“I tell everyone about this place, it’s my new favourite.”
After years feeling trapped at home, memorising every crack in the wall in the rooms of the Manor he’d willingly enter, Draco had been pleasantly surprised to find Hogwarts feeling like home again.
“I know,” she said quietly. “Does she still work in criminal justice?”
and he doesn’t know what that should feel like if it’s a danger to him, but he remembers Draco touching Leonard in the bookshop and looks at the curse running through his veins—already almost to his elbow—and chooses to risk it.
Equally tense and feeding off each other’s tempers, Draco and Harry don’t need to speak a word aloud before agreeing to stalk out of the Ministry, furiously fast, and only come to a stop when Harry collapses onto an empty bench a couple blocks away.
He nods.
“Oh, he’s not bad. His reputation precedes him, really. You can tell he cares for his clients. Besides, he’s usually in very different courtrooms than me, so we hardly cross paths.” She shakes her head. “More charm in him than he knows what to do with, though.”
Ron looks up at his wife. “I’m going to try to put him into one of those slowing spells the Quidditch healers use,” then to Harry, “Do you have a first aid kit?”
“That would’ve taken me a good think—without being placed in an emergency. Between that and my… personal experience… I was able to look through my books and narrow it down to either hemlock or nightshade.”
He doesn’t miss the fact that Draco’s leg, the one not tucked under him, stills when it brushes with Harry’s shoulder as he readjusts. He chews his lip, trying to focus all his energy on his book. He’s just gotten to the chapter on Asian wizarding hierarchy, which has taken a delightfully more laudatory approach than the biased, though educational, pro-Malfoy books from the Manor.
It’s a while before he receives a response, and he’s just beginning to think he’s annoyed Draco into radio silence when Rose giggles excitedly at the approaching owl.
“Potter! Will you
The last thing Harry manages to see before he’s separated from the chaos is Malfoy, wand pointed directly at Agnes, staring furiously and unblinkingly at her bloody form.
“I’m not, I just
“No,” he said aloud the moment he saw her name on the back. “No, not happening.”
“You and me?”
“Mr Potter, I believe it’s been too long,” Professor McGonagall says as he reaches the stage.
“I keep seeing you on the floor.”
“I’ve never seen him,” she says, fixing her husband with a hopeless smile.
“What do you think?”
Teddy scrapes Andromeda’s legs with the twigs of the brooms as he pushes through the doorway, dragging them behind him.
Did he really destroy his belongings over a man? Lay in bed all morning? When had he become a dog that lost its bite? He decides he’d grown fond of Harry incidentally—as the one who happened to patch some holes in his life. Purely circumstantial, he told himself.
“Wonderful to see you, Mr Potter! Happy to help, anything else you need, I am your man, eh?”
“No, you
“He has to climb so much further. I’m sure he’s distrusting of the most well-intentioned, neutral-grounded wizards out there, so learning to trust that Harry Potter of all people is trying to rise to the occasion can’t be a simple task. It’ll take effort.”
“Then I guess I’m coming.”
Draco shakes the ash off his shoes before stepping through, gifting McGonagall a polite smile.
“Please, just—Pansy will talk my ear off and this weekend has already been a fucking lot. This— I’m not ready to do it all again.”
The gates were only half open when he slipped out of the lift, stalking to the floo before he did something he’d regret. He’d gone straight to Pansy’s, not needing to be told she and Blaise would both be there.
of all people…” Ron says, “You’ve always been stuck on him, especially.”
Harry’s biting his lip, brows furrowed in concern still, and Draco holds his gaze steadily, trying to convey a lack of personal distress—past his initial surprise, it’s being quickly replaced with a frustrated desire for Harry to stop worrying out loud.
He’s gotten teary-eyed twice since; when he saw the look in Ron’s eyes as he announced that Hermione was pregnant, and the day in St. Mungo’s when Harry first held her. Lately, there’d been talks of a second, too.
“Did you know him, my dad? If you went to school with Harry?”
“It doesn’t hurt.” He speaks softly, hardly audible, hardly breathing.

,” he whispers to Dante. He looks back at Draco with a smirk. “See? Dante thinks you can trust me. Friendliness becomes us.” For a quiet moment, they stay there, meeting each other’s eyes. Then the kettle whistles and Draco pushes himself off the door frame.
Draco knows what disappointment looks like on Narcissa’s face, so he recognises it when the millimetre quirked tips of a smile fall. She’d written weeks ago to visit, he recalls. Before the mess of the Hogwarts banquet, or working for—

While Harry slowly works through the open space, he lays back and looks at the framed photos, thinks about the images from a life Harry lived after him and then before him again, only rising when he’s beckoned again.
wants to see, and how is Harry supposed to deny him anything when he’s gifted him this entire day, even if he’s dead on his feet, so he smiles and takes hold of Draco’s bicep without another word.
Harry drops his duffel by that same blue front door, now crowded with kicked off shoes and mail, then heads upstairs for a quick shower.
His expression is unreadable. He’s already kicking his shoes off and setting his water down by Harry’s feet. His jaw is tight and he stands with poise and attitude that’s completely unnecessary for the situation.
When Draco had first sucked Harry deeper into his matchmaking, it was over a quiet breakfast at the dining table in his flat. It had only been a few days since the case had closed, Lucrezia and Hadrian Bode locked away, Aurors finally done badgering him for testimony. Suddenly boringly jobless, he’d been tasked by Draco—who’d spent just as many days hearing how little direction he now felt his life had—with making a list of his interests. He'd thrown the balled-up parchment crossly towards the study about three minutes ago.
As he worked his spellwork outwards towards the edge of the land, he discovered even more; an old barn, a few gîtes, and a small, empty chapel that stood on the auburn-toned edge of the land’s woods. He spent a lot of the time alone, during which a handsome man with emerald eyes often came to mind.
“Spare
Draco flashes a grateful smile for the no-nonsense start. “Well, you may remember I’ve been working on de-escalation charms for cursed objects. The way I worked it out went great for smaller instances, like the stinging-hexed diary. I’ve charmed it down to where the diary just feels like a static shock.”
“How did you know what to look for at Flourish and Blotts?” Harry blurts, a surprise even to himself.
It’s hard not to smile, and despite his best efforts, he can’t hide a smirk when Hermione plunges her hands into her hair with exasperation.
“What else?” asks Hermione.
She studies his face, then reaches a hand across her chair and sets it on his arm. “But last time an era ended we found ourselves here. And how exciting has this been?” She smiles. “Who knows what’s next for us all, right?”
He laughs and knocks his head on Draco’s shoulder amicably.
“Yes.”
Harry shrugs, immediately uneasy with the serious implications. “Nothing’s going to happen, but… yes. Just between us.”
“Are you warning him?” Hermione’s voice rings from the kitchen, then grows louder as she turns the corner. She’s got three plates balanced expertly and sets one before Harry, the others in front of her and Ron.
“Sod it,” Harry says, breaking through the line to kneel beside her. She’s shaking, and he takes his robes off to drape around her shoulders. One hand lingers there for comfort.
But the conversation is driving forward without him.
“That’s a fine one.”
Bafflingly, Harry’s face contorts into a level of surprise and confusion that doesn’t seem fit. He stares at Draco as if he’d just spoken perfect Mandarin. “
“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t think Draco had company, I’ll—“
“The kind you
“I’m being practical.”
She was striking. Often, she kept her chin-length hair half-tied back, like a little sprout at the crown of her head, and when she bent over a potion and felt the front pieces fall out and into her eyesight, dark hair masking darker eyes, she would cuss in beautiful French.
Something was intriguing about both the Malfoys he’d met; the man who patiently reschedules to fit Harry’s needs, and the man who can match Harry’s animosity with exacting insults.
Harry hears Luna and Neville laugh at something funny that Ron says behind him, and catches Ginny’s slight glance back. He can’t help but compare the evening to a recently comparable one at a muggle pub.
“Ah! How well said!” Blaise pipes up, voice booming theatrically. There’s a mischievous smile on his lips and despite the way Draco’s heart is quickening, no clue where this is going, he has to fight a smile. He’s always been fond of his friend’s dramatics. Zabini, most likely inspired while observing his mother throughout his youth, was becoming a rather formidable barrister.
“Is that on record?!” asks a keen young witch.
The girls continue chatting, but Ron desperately drags Harry toward the bar, the quick drink at his flat quickly proving insufficient for the evening ahead.
“Blaise, you’re spilling beer,” Pansy interjects, patting his wrist.
“Too much history, I suppose?” Jack is watching him closely, nodding along but trying to parse through whatever Harry isn’t saying out loud. “Alright. I just know… there’s a thin line between love and hate.”
They walk under strings of warm lanterns that cross the wide passageways, nestled alongside steep stone staircases, covered market stalls, wooden latticework adorned in gilded lamps and ivy. Past it all is a keyhole arch tall enough for two dragons to pass under with ease, through which he can see the afternoon sky and the smoke of food vendors. The air is warm, not just from the climate but from the yellow glow of light across the market.
Harry’s hold on Draco’s shoulders is tightening, his eyes prickling. Finally, she picks up her wand and begins a spell with the book propped open in her left hand. When she lowers her wand, they all lean closer.
“I won’t be hungry for

“Yes, an urgent meeting with Professor Flitwick, I’m afraid. He’s squeezed in my appointment.”

“What did you want?” Harry snaps.
He considers lying again, but that doesn’t seem genuine, and so he provides a vaguely true answer instead, shrugging. “Just… jittery.”

Then, against all odds, he’s even managed to get him back to the gym, and in honest-to-god trainers and shorts. They’ve arrived at his usual time on a Friday, and the gym is moderately busy with the usual suspects. Draco’s overconfident agreement must be too good to be true, he thinks, as he drags him to the lockers. A glance over at him as Harry stows their things leads him to believe that there might have been more self-assurance in his agreement than his actual demeanour presents.
The atmosphere Harry’s entered is so charged with exhilaration that he can’t help but be pulled in.

“Oh my god,
“Come on!”
“Essentially, the spellwork on this necklace combines a sort of locator charm, I believe an adaptation of the Homonculous Charm, strengthened by only focusing on an individual recipient, and cast with enough love that you can feel it as powerfully as you would a curse. I believe you know a thing or two about the strength of love in the use of magic.”
Harry shakes his head solemnly. “It’s not.”
“Ron,” Harry’s gone beet red. “And we didn’t shag, alright? It was just some…”
Harry smiles into the next kiss, and his hands leave Draco to find purchase under the back of his legs. Within a moment he’s lifted off the ground. It’s a strange experience, as a full-grown adult. Harry gives only a light huff, making him feel weightless, and he hooks his arms around Harry’s neck, his ankles behind his back. For a moment he really is at a loss for words.
“Yes.”
Harry kicks off his socks and shoes then leans down, smiling softly to himself, to look at Draco. He startles when they make eye contact.
“I—he was r-removed.”
“It’s because the skull’s been cursed
The addition of training is evident on Draco’s body, in the tone of his arms and legs especially, but he’s still competing against a man who lives at the gym and has for years. His face is spotted pink and his chest is rising quickly, while Jack remains aggravatingly calm. Nevertheless, his jaw clenches and he carries himself stubbornly as though he’s not fatigued at all.
“Let’s walk this way!” Blaise puts his arm around her shoulder and waves back to Draco as they turn away. “Have a good night. Nice to see you again, Harry!”
Draco smiles fully. “Hi.”
“Agreed.”
“Similarly, it is exceptionally difficult to involve charms and curses in the same object. The witch or wizard would need to be an advanced spell caster, capable of casting both highly intentional Light and Dark magic. Do you see where I’m going?” he prompts, ever the teacher.
If the roles were reversed, Harry would go for a run, the madman. Draco groggily brewed a batch of his own Dreamless Sleep recipe just as the sun peeked in instead, wondering as he finally drifted off what had left him so willing to invite Harry in.
The first time Harry feels like Draco has fully rejoined the conversation is while he and Ron are lamenting about the current authority figures in the Auror department. Compared to the strong-armed occupation from the second wizarding world, Harry thinks Murray’s human errs of incapability seem like a blessing.
Draco kisses him, really kisses him. The kind that feels inappropriate in public, not because it’s explicit but because it seems to say something rather private about adoration and fondness. He returns it, feeling Draco’s hand under his coat on the small of his back, and it keeps them close even once their lips pull apart.
? Come eat, you lunatic.”
“Thanks.”
He ignores her, walking away and cracking the bedroom window. He exhales smoke with his head bent awkwardly to the open air.
Draco can feel his ears heating while Harry looks back and forth, recognising that they’ve brought up separate instances at Jab. He meets Draco’s eyes with a refreshingly different expression—one more familiar, pleading for intervention.
“You know what’s funny?” she asks.
“Hm.”
” Harry shouts each time he lands a well-formed hit. “
He picks out Draco’s first book,
“It’s weird having Muggles in class,” he muses, taking a sip of his soda.
“See,
With one last deep breath and a quick fruitless run through his hair, Harry steps up. His ears seem to close, the roar of applause sounding muffled like there’s a pillow over his head. He spells a quick Sonorous charm through the roar of applause, amplifying his voice, and sweeps his gaze across the hall of people, landing on Hermione’s encouraging smile. His collar feels exceptionally tight again.
speaking of this again. Ever.”
He extracts his arms, electing to make himself useful getting plates, and when Harry glances back at his leaving figure, Draco’s encouraged by the expression that meets him; one that seems to mirror his own internal distractions today. His gaze is exploratory and deep, flitting between Draco’s eyes and mouth, and his lips drift apart for a quiet moment before he stammers, “Bowls, too.”
“So,” he hums. Harry can hear the cheek coming before he’s gotten more than a syllable out. “This…
Draco smiled into the counter, bested.
He’s right, always right, always thinking cleverly. Harry’s been a useless wreck but even now, Draco’s thinking critically. He’s already holding the other man up but he leans forward and touches their foreheads for a secondary point of contact, closing his eyes and imagining the magic within him pouring out.
Harry blazes through the door with the incongruent happy tinkling of a bell and comes face to face with… a face. Upside down.

“Indeed.” Draco leaves his tea to turn the corner into the kitchen, parsing through the drawers for a snack. “It gives the flat a much less insidious
“That bath was your best idea ever,” he says, feeling intoxicatingly comfortable. “Your best in the history of ideas.”
“They’re his friends, too.”
Before Draco, Harry didn’t think much about what he wore past warmth and a way to avoid public indecency. He doesn’t think on it much more now—though he sometimes worries whether what he’s chosen will be so fashionably abysmal that he’ll be pestered by his friend all day—but he
Quite honestly, he’d been worried about having any Weasleys at the party, imagining that they’d judge him for the posh location and guests, even if an entire evening celebrating Draco’s success was a once-in-a-few-years event. He should have known Pansy would make it a smashing success, enjoyable and messy and the perfect combination of class and fun.
“Fucking hell, Draco. Are you
The reply comes soon enough:
With a gulp, Harry holds the cell timer in his hand and, only slightly reserved, shouts, “Go!”
“Wonders never cease.”
There’s a weight on the bench beside him. They sit in silence, Draco with his eyes on the grass, trying to get it to stop swaying. After a minute, Potter speaks.
“Honestly, it’ll be good to have a break. I’ve been overworking myself.”
Draco
“You know I’m doing
“That settles that then,” he says.
“Stay?” he asks softly. Then, in an afterthought of explanation, “It’ll make it easier to leave in the morning.”
Ron claps his hands together. “Yes, we’re all in agreement, my wife loves books. I should get them home to her.” He taps the bag that he’d set down with his foot. It makes a sound like he’s kicked a brick wall.
“We’re not exactly royalty, these days, are we? I decided an event I’m actually invited to would be a good start.”
. Our first mistake was turning to romance as if we weren’t Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy turning to romance.”
“Oh god, is it the shorts? They’re regulation length.” He grimaces, one gloved hand flying up to sweep his hair back sheepishly. “It’s the shorts, isn’t it?”
“It doesn’t take much, and it should just dissolve,” Malfoy says now, scooping some of the paste onto his makeshift spoon. “You will probably feel a warm sensation and some tingling as the blood recirculates. I’ll do it now.”
He leaves Draco’s side, presumably for his wand, and in his absence, he sits down on the floor and leans against the sofa. Vaguely, he registers the television is on. It’s black and white. The voices are reedy. When he closes his eyes, he can focus enough to hear them.
“Of course, not now. You’re right, we had fun last night, but as friends. She stayed over because we haven’t seen each other much lately, what with the Ministry work.”
Finally, after ages of eyeing him from afar, his hands can investigate. He cards his fingers through Jack’s long hair, not yet pulled into his usual bun. He moves up under Jack’s shirt, hands delicately tracing his chest, mind spinning in a chorus of
“Yeah, alright.”
“Wonderful, Mari, that would be brilliant. Is there anyone—“
“Am not.”
“Want to go sit in the garden? It’s chilly but that’s what warming charms and fire pits are for.”
Harry feels his temper rise. “Get him here. Now!” No one moves.
“So I’m going to mention, completely neutrally with full acknowledgement that we can speak openly with each other, perhaps more than with anyone else, that you mentioned Draco Malfoy
“Ooooooh…” Pansy and Blaise goad him as he slides out. He shoots them a murderous glare, while Harry glowers at him like he’d instructed them to act so childishly.
“You’re hard to argue with.” Draco smiles. “And you’re right, the juxtaposition with the later chapters will be good. It matters greatly to me that this isn’t seen as some… condemnation of Dark magic. Nor an appraisal. Light magic is just as powerful.”
, Harry. But Lucius Malfoy took something from us. So we must take something from Lucius Malfoy. An eye for an eye. Took this one long enough to crawl back into society, I’ve been waiting. Oh so patiently.” She yanks Draco up onto his knees, too, mirroring Harry’s position, and it makes him nauseous to see. He might be sick.
“Y-you too,” Harry speaks from just behind his shoulder and he almost startles. He’s too jumpy. He hadn’t known Harry stood close. Pansy waves back too, a bit perplexed, and he watches Blaise lean in and speak quietly to her.
It shakes Draco from the strangeness. He clears his throat, feeling too hot for his jumper, and sits back. “Good,” he confirms. Then, because he can think of nothing else to attribute his minor arrhythmia to besides guilt, and because being close enough to Harry to hear him breathe through his nose has toppled over the last semblance of balance in his conscience, he says words with a sincerity he never thought he would.
Turning the corner around the kitchen with surprising speed, he takes the spoon from Harry’s hand and lays it by the stove, grabbing his shoulders and pushing him towards the back of the flat.
“Ginny, hi! Sorry to leave you to an empty home.” He sets the wine on the table and goes to hug her. “It’s not lax, there’s just a lot of people who need to be able to firecall me quickly. A Weasley having permission is certainly the least disconcerting situation imaginable.”
The boy’s eyes widen, face souring quickly. “It’s done! I want to hear!”
“Honest, we are. We can make a special handshake if you need convincing.”
Ron sits forward. “Mm, Mum was just asking after you.”
“There’s dried drool on the corner of your mouth,” he replies, reaching a hand out. Draco slaps it away and rubs at his face self-consciously.
“I work the perfect number of hours and relax plenty,” Hermione sighs. “I won’t hear you say anything to the contrary.”
He’s the lead investigator and yet in the brief minute of silence at his disposal, his voice had escaped him. He sees icy locks and permanent frown lines and grey eyes on the inside of his eyelids and yet recognises nothing in the man he’d known every snickering, glaring inch of for the better part of his youth. Draco Malfoy is a stranger.
“I thought you were angry with me. So… I was trying to decipher why.”
He lifts the necklace now, too, and sets it in his palm. It’s flat gold, shiny enough to spot a warped reflection of his eye on the surface, with no inscriptions or marks. A complete mystery object he has no context for. Suddenly, he understands what Draco meant by the tunnel-vision fostered by a particularly puzzling cursed object. He wants to do nothing but decode this.
and the very fact that it grips him with jealousy is embarrassing. Still, he tilts his head as casually as he can as he asks, “Why not?”
The longer their lessons dragged on, however, the more he felt a growing sense of uneasiness in his chest. It was the same as he’d felt in the pent-up anger and vulnerability he’d experienced outside the Ministry. A need to return to equilibrium. A desire for balance. On Saturday morning, he felt a flicker of inspiration.
“Draco planned it for me, actually,” he admits, surprised by his candour.
“UP HERE!” he shouts out the door.
gave the Potters one sentence:
Then Ginny had haunted his dreams and left him feeling more tired on waking than he had going to bed.
“I’m not telling you to quit,” Ron says. “But the entire wizarding world expected Aurorship from you. So if no one else is going to tell you it’s okay not to be one, I think I want to.”
Hermione looks nervous but Draco just raises his hands in surrender. “No, Merlin, me too. But I hated him
For a couple days, Draco stared at the Ministry file until the letters swam across the page. Nothing jumped out at him. There was more to curse studies than the actual counter-cursing and origin potions—he was the first to preach that. It was analysis. Maths and arithmancy. Problem-solving. Loads and loads of reading.

“Oh, she’s brilliant at writing arguments,” Blaise says. “I’d be pleased to work with her.”

“Is she right? She’s always right.”

He can’t help it. Harry’s smile is too contagious not to match. His own answers for him.
“It’s not illegal. Just… improper.”
“He’s not here. Murray. I requested him, but he’s out and likely won’t bother, so… you won’t see him.”
“Bloody hell, Mr Auror Hero Harry Potter, sod the fame and save some girls for the rest of us!”

“When you’re better at it, it feels like a thousand voices shouting at you when you’re trying to hear someone whispering directly in your ear,” he explains. “And then once you’re even
It’s very easy to forget, in hatred or jealousy or admiration, how famous Potter is, how he speaks of this event that threw Draco’s afternoon into a whirlwind like it’s just another day. Inexplicably, he manages to express the casual frequency with which he faces it, while making Draco feel no less validated for having a mare over a single instance.
“Is this—sorry, I… er, I wasn’t suggesting—we’ve just been standing for a while, erm…”
“Enough.”
Draco’s arms tighten.
“Someone’s attempting to kill you,” she says. “Try to stop us.”
“C’mon then, I’d never miss a chance to say goodnight to Rose.”
“A curse breaker?”
The Three Broomsticks is warm and inviting, if not a bit smoky, and every bit of it puts Harry at ease—the smell, the rumble of conversation from every corner, glasses clinking at the bar. They slide into a booth comfortably, shoulder to shoulder the four of them, and he can feel eyes on him before they’ve even got scarves and hats removed.
He hesitates. He can’t put into words what came over him to think of Potter first when he escaped the journalists, but it had proved enjoyable, and so he listens again as it tugs on his tongue.
“Blimey. Who got your knickers in a twist?”
*****
Yes, he thinks. That’s what he’ll say when he sees Harry again. He’ll act casual and unaffected and professional. The last thing he wants to do is scare him further away.
No one’s asked him this in a very long time. He reaches for memories of telling Ron and Hermione and then reconfigures them for the first time to tell someone who’s not the brother and sister-in-law of his ex. He narrows his eyes at Draco, trying to calculate what he’s up to.
It hurt to see Potter and his posse’s faces in the Prophet just about every day for a while, always in headlines referring to him as “Hero Potter” or “Savior Potter,” as if they needed to clarify which Harry Potter they meant. Meanwhile, he was shunned, forced to spend his waking hours in the same home where Voldemort had tormented his family.
“Small.”
He tips the omelette onto a plate and takes a seat at his small table, summoning the files from his Ministry office. A stack of manila folders falls with a slap onto the table—he’d pictured his entire inbox, hoping the gala curse had already been added to his itinerary—and sure enough, it sits on top. He pages through with his free hand as he eats.
Harry’s shaking his head vehemently.
He gives her a weak smile, a bit surprised, and she takes one final, deep, satisfied breath before turning to mention something to Ron, smoothly giving him a moment to himself. And thank Merlin she does, because his stomach is dropping out, like he’s fallen unexpectedly from a great distance, and his heart is twisting, ever so slightly, into knots, reflecting on the boy he’d once met—desperate always for his father’s approval, taught to live on admiration, seeing no other way to feel whole. And he reflects on the man he’s met since—fiery but trying. Defensive and passionate. Wronged and lost, but seemingly recovering.
“Indeed,” Harry replies, and he hesitates only enough for Draco to notice when Pansy links her arm through his.
“Curse,” Harry stammers unhelpfully.
“What’re you thinking about?” Harry tilts his head, looking down at Draco and narrowing his eyes. He sees in them the flecks of olive and brown, in his cheeks the still-fading freckles of summer.
“Hm,” Potter studies him carefully. “There must be something in the air.”
Blaise holds his hands up in surrender.
would find to run. I’m just listening to myself.”
It’s a cheap shot, but Murray at least succeeds in sending Harry into his thoughts—ones of Malfoy sneering and scowling and saying any horrid thing he can about anyone Harry loves, among the lesser of his evils.
In a breath and only a pace or two, his feet carry him across the room, past Pansy and Blaise, and he gingerly wraps his arms around Draco in a close embrace, feeling the sigh of the man against him.
A week of dread later, Draco is parsing through everything he’d said that night, wondering just what stroke of daring had come over him. When Flitwick assured him that his only availability was while in London, he should’ve argued more. When he’d mentioned the gala offhand, he should’ve insisted on meeting elsewhere. Maybe then he wouldn’t be digging through posh robes he hasn’t worn in years for something to dress in for his death march.
He disapparates on the spot, leaving Harry alone in astonishment on his doorstep, a hand tracing the pockmarked contours of a carved duck.
Only when she says this and hurries back towards Draco’s bedroom does Harry register that she’s dressed for sleep; her nightgown is so luxurious that he’d mistaken it for fashion in his distraction. And she’s running to Draco’s bedroom to change. And Draco had been buttoning his shirt rather breathlessly when Harry arrived…
“I know more about you than you know yourself. Hence all my books you’ve borrowed.”
“Yeah.” There’s a creak on the bed, and Ron lays down beside him, staring at the ceiling, too. “I’m sorry if… I’ve been resisting, I think. But I’m with you no matter what. It’ll just be easier when it makes sense.”
“Do what?”
“I’ll be there. Just tell me when and where.”
Harry looks away, accidentally making eye contact with Ginny in the process, who recognises something in his face and gives him a slight shake of her head in fair warning, but he’s too irate to let it go.
She lets him sit in peace. She asks him no questions and silently fields the return owls. Narcissa, once hearing that Draco was going to be okay, requests updates and only sends a basket of sweets—dark chocolates, which Draco doesn’t like. Blaise and Pansy arrive separately but within fifteen minutes of each other, and Hermione even fills in during his retelling anytime he starts to trail off.
“Indeed,” Harry says, hiding his own smile.
Harry continues as if he hasn’t heard him. “I went home and changed and found this book from Ron, which reminded me just how drunk I’d been last night, and I thought ‘oh god, I showed up at Draco’s, three sheets to the wind, slept in his
is the new curse specialist?” he asks instead, not moving an inch. “I wasn’t informed, and I’ve been researching specialists all week.”
He narrows his eyes challengingly and Harry narrows them back, grey meeting green, soul meeting soul. He can see the brazenness leave Harry, watches his face soften into an easy smile before leaning in, capturing his lips soft and tender.
“Are you sure?”
“The Potters were Healers. Or well, at least had a Healing shop in Delhi—after they moved. They were a big part of the wizarding sector once the community retreated into secrecy. Once the family moved to England, they stayed mostly to the Godric’s Hollow area. I can’t find anything on why they went from such a large operation to something so small. Or why they moved at all. They didn’t approve of the Twenty-Eight’s blood purity rules, maybe that was part of it. Draco’s books spoke mostly about the Potters in response to the Twenty-Eight, not so much their personal motives.”
“Yes…” Draco keeps his eyes on the uncomfortable-looking man standing across from him, who seems both intent on leaving immediately and staying to supervise Draco. “Sit,” he adds, to save him from the decision.
“I get it! Believe me, I’ve been humbled. It’s a sign of my
It’s mid-afternoon on a Thursday and Flitwick’s schedule hasn’t changed in half a century, so he doubts it’s changed since he’d attended in 2002. He’ll be available if Draco goes now, so he gathers his courage and confidently steps into his fireplace, green flames licking up his legs and smoke fogging his vision, finally dissipating into a view of the Headmistress behind her large mahogany desk.
Hope you've enjoyed it thus far!
Draco offers an easy shrug to affect an untruthful level of ease, and he sees Harry blink in surprise at the gesture.
That does it. Potter’s face, which had just been flushed with anger, pales ashen, his breath catching. He almost speaks once, twice, but shuts his mouth each time.
“I can’t.”
Draco shrugs and takes another bite. “Just like, er… he—you.”
to look at Draco. That face, those eyes—imagining seeing any of it for the last time will kill him before she does. It’s hard enough to stave off the thought that he could’ve already heard Draco’s voice in finality. “Draco doesn’t like him either. Are you going to hold someone responsible for their parents’ actions?”
He wonders which of them will weaken and reach out first.
She smiles at him warmly. “We send letters. They’ve grown more frequent as time goes on. She mentions you, of course, so I feel as though I’ve already known you for years.”
“In the Ministry?”
“Thank you,
Harry chuckles politely. He had gone so easily, hadn’t he? Draco Malfoy not putting up a fight. It was frustratingly confusing, but suggests that he’d corroborate Hermione’s plan of action. In a way, he’d known this was coming, too. He’d just been too hopeful that they’d outrun it to be pragmatic.
“And then he goes, I
to get in trouble.”
There’s a strain in his voice that doesn’t seem pain-related, and Harry can imagine he feels like he’s lost most of his dignity in the last ten minutes, so he listens, stabilising him with one hand under his armpit and another around his waist. Slowly, they move through to the bedroom, where he drapes his old fluffy maroon robe around his shoulders. When Draco speaks, it’s so soft that he has to lean in to hear the words.
“I think he’s aware, ‘Mione,” Ron supplies between mouthfuls of pudding.
“It’s not a problem, I was happy to,” Lars replies, opening a locker near Harry’s and retrieving a duffle bag. He glances towards the two of them. “Draco, Draco, you are dressed differently this evening. Is there a chance we are getting you in the ring tonight, eh?”
“Picture of health,” Draco lies.
“So I don’t see how we’re left to write about Cross-Species Transfiguration without mentioning Human Transfiguration.” He points past a still stunned Pansy to the dish by Draco’s elbow. “Pass the peas? Pans, close your mouth.”
He’s already mounting his broom, hovering a foot over the ground and showing Harry how he drops.
“We’re training
“Dark magic.”
Ron bites his lip, looking past Harry in contemplation.
But Draco had certainly put himself out there today, came to the Ministry for Harry, and so he makes his next offer hesitantly.
To his surprise, Harry steps closer without checking the emptiness of the room and presses close to him from behind, one hand slipping under his shirt to touch bare skin with a warmth that makes him shiver. “Are you
When he lifts his head to look at him, Draco looks back as if he’d heard him calling, and something deeply caring passes between them, through the thin centimetres of air between their faces. Harry smiles and chooses to ruin it.
“Forget it, Harry, just get ready,” comes his voice from the edge of the bed. He’s wrestling on a pair of shoes too nice for hiking, but he says nothing. Just complies, letting his hands leave his hair and hanging a scarf around his neck.
“I love a challenge,” Harry grins, genuinely and hungrily.
His face pinches up, seemingly physically pained to sit across from Harry.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Harry asks quietly in return, setting his coat on a chair and gripping the back of it as he turns to meet Draco’s eye. His stomach drops sadly.
and makes great contact this time, pivoting his weight forward and pinning Harry’s legs in place. He narrows his eyes. “Perhaps,” he says.
He would like, so after another minute of quiet rested eyes, he extricates himself from the soft cushions and makes his own breakfast, yawning uncontrollably. He sits across from Draco at the table sipping at a mug of coffee. Only then, slowly, does he feel himself coming back to life, recovering from a night of fragmentary sleep.
“Hi, Mari. It’s been warded,” Harry says without standing. “You’ll need to get them upstairs the Muggle way, there’s no magic down here.”
, Draco, my turn. I was a dick. I started shit, too, in case you’ve forgotten. I could’ve been the better man. And maybe you’re right, maybe I’m too forgiving with the
Harry’s day has been so consistently thrilling that he feels as though he’s flying in the same rush of golden, glowing light as Liquid Luck. He’d happened upon a Draco this afternoon happy as a lark, gifted him the rarity of more cursed objects than he knows what to do with, and discovered something of Sirius’ that he couldn’t shake from his thoughts.
In his mind, he is completely on the defence, scrambling to salvage an ill-executed mistake. And while this is true, he has no way to know that Harry’s own heart is beating insanely fast, too. That he feels as though he’s falling headfirst into a temper he didn’t mean to have tonight and didn’t wish upon a man he so greatly and consistently found himself wanting to please.
in my bed.” He finally drops his arm from Harry’s touch and rolls abruptly on top of him, head buried into the pillow.
“Oh, yeah, well, of course. It’s all just banter, we know there’s nothing there. For Circe’s sake, he almost killed you in that bathroom. And his best friend was tortured in your bloody drawing room. You’re not shagging in secret.”
“Merlin’s bollocks,” he whispers.
Draco laughs. “He’s a menace.”
Ready or not, the night eventually draws to a close, even with an after-dinner coffee, and all four of them reach for the check. Draco comes away with it. He doesn’t miss the increasing glances from Blaise, tries to ignore them, and when they walk out the front entrance his friend speaks before anyone else can.
“Erm, hi,” Draco says, sounding surprised, and when Harry drops the weight of his head onto his shoulder instead of responding, he takes his arms from behind his back and slowly returns the embrace. “Are you alright?” he asks softly.
“Nine years,” he says after a long silence.
Harry sighs, reaching for his quill again.
He hums thoughtfully, reaches to set the necklace on the coffee table, then slides a hand under Draco’s shirt with the confidence of this response, up to where it sits on his heart. It’s beating slow, calm. Draco doesn’t ask him anything, just squeezes his shoulder with his free hand, likely thinking Harry’s merely offering affection.
It’s a warm day for October so he has the windows behind him cracked, letting in a light breeze that occasionally unrests his papers from their careful piles. He drops a hand distractedly when the edges lift, without stopping his edits, covering Marta’s ruthless red ink with his own responses.
man is on the case!’ If there was ever someone fit to take over from my, er, impending resignation—“
He stretches his arms into the cold of Harry’s side of the bed. Three days and two nights together should require a night away. He’ll get up in a minute, go get work done, sleep in his own bed
“I’m gasping,” Blaise responded with a suave smile.
“Mmhm.”
“With your mere presence,” Draco goads. Blaise offers a rude gesture. “Er, it didn’t work this time, however. Unfortunately. It just… got worse.”
“And you
“You look like death warmed up.”
—sorry—Slytherin seems to have scored? Yes! They’ve gotten a Bludger, or no, a Quaffle… obviously… past Gryffindor Keeper Christina Ackerly. Bad luck, Christina.”
of all people.”
“Year and a half, and yes, in the study.” He scowls at Harry’s expression. “Don’t look so bewildered, potion ingredients come in cans too.”
“Me too,” Draco says.
Harry sets the book on the bedside table, stopping in fixation when he spots a red envelope, too. Draco follows his eyes, then quickly grabs his hips and tries to pull him back into bed. He succeeds, but the envelope comes with him in a quick, blurred grab—those Seeker reflexes. Harry twists and pins him down expertly, almost as an afterthought, straddling him with a knee on either side of his hip.
And so the careful list of what to do should it occur is kept private as well. Harry’s impersonal focus is key. No distracting worries. He’s written it today; where to find his notes on the information not handed into the Ministry, a list of impartial curse specialists to call in, Blaise’s office information, and where to find his diary for an account of his locations and activities. It feels disturbingly like a will.
He watches Draco’s face tighten and knows him well enough to tell that he’s deciding what to say. How much to let Harry in. He’s surprised by the candour he offers when he opens his mouth.
“Was it bad?” Teddy grins.
Harry continues to practice with the skull. Draco changes the environment by adding more magical objects to the room or moving the skull further. He tries to focus on teaching—especially with such a receptive student—but he has trouble keeping a full daft grin off his face. He’s busy imagining that there are much worse things to be than minty gum.
She giggles when he pokes her playfully, while Hermione shares a meaningful look of weariness with Harry—he’s well-aware of the new ‘training Rose to stay in her toddler bed’ phase.
“Fine,” he sneers. “You want even? One school trip for another?”
Harry frowns. “Well, do you want to? I want to do what you want to do.”
He shrugs. “An eye for an eye.”
“It’s—I just didn’t expect to see you.”
At the promise of research, he can tell he’s won her over, much faster than expected. Her eyes brighten. “Oh, that’s a great idea! Did Molly’s book help?”
Draco raises delicate fingers too and removes his glasses, folds them, and sets them by the sink, then runs a hand gently around the back of his head.
“You’re insufferable,” he mutters, narrowing his eyes in response to Draco’s grin. He nudges the bedroom door open with his foot and this time, he sets him on the bed, climbing on top, hands already fumbling with buttons even as he speaks. “Absolutely intolerable.”
Oddly, Draco almost smiles. That makes more sense than Weasley suddenly caring seriously about his wellbeing. They have this in common; Harry’s emotional welfare is near the top of their priorities.
He watches the ghostly stag gallop away and hopes Ron and Hermione will forgive him later for not contacting them. It’s been a while since Harry has considered inviting his best friends into any immediate danger they hadn’t already been involved in without picturing Rose’s face. And if Draco’s been removed by force from the holding cells, it’ll work in their favour to make it proper protocol, an Auror-exclusive operation. Ron, unfortunately, is also now a civilian.
He nods distractedly, looking down and flipping through papers until he stops, presumably, on his copy of the latest case report.
“How’s that?”
Draco seems caught off guard by the question, sitting back up and setting his glass on the table. He hesitates a little long for what Harry thinks is a simple question, and his mouth opens for a few seconds while he looks past him in thought before responding.
When he opens the door and kicks off his shoes, Ginny’s sitting comfortably on the sofa.

Luna smiles and nods. “I do miss him at the games… Neville’s picked up the slack wonderfully,” she says with a pat on her friend’s wrist. He blushes and fixes his shoelaces. “But he was so amusing! And Godric forbid he bring
He nods.
“Thirty-six hours,” Harry repeats again by the floo. He’s scanning Draco’s face as if this has been a dream, as if it’ll disappear for good when he leaves his home. He leans up, kisses him firmly and sneaks his tongue past Draco’s teeth again. He’s trying to get him to stay. It’s almost working.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Yeah, alright. Skip the flirting and get to the point. The sooner I get done, the sooner we can fraternise.”
Harry nods, eyebrows raised in mutual understanding, then finds the nerve to tap Draco’s knee with his own socked foot. “You were excited about something?”
Once he emerges, they say goodbye to Pansy and take a floo in St. Mungo’s back to his. Draco stumbles immediately upon crossing the hearth on his books, and when Harry reaches for his arm he wrenches it away.
“Yes, I
“Then I’m doing it.”
Draco pushes him with his foot. “Make the picture go back. You talked through the last five minutes and it looked important.”
“The five—“
“Merlin, I know it,” he mutters, feeling rather sloshed by now. “Tasteful of the

“I thought Harry was still being a prick, it was defensive.”
Ron shovels his food in twice as fast. Hermione sighs. “It can wait until after dinner.”
flat—near Diagon Alley. He’d looked a mess; dark purple circles evident even against his dark skin, hair unwashed… It was a miracle that he’d changed clothes.
In a moment of paranoia, he almost thinks he sees Flitwick’s eyes flick to his arm, but the small man looks towards the ceiling in thought so quickly.
“Thirty-six hours,” Draco says sternly when he parts them, reaching for the powder. “I’ll
for scholastic work,” Hermione is saying. “It’s… narratively educational.”
,” he murmurs.
It’s too easy, Draco thinks. Slipping back into old habits. Hitting right where he’ll cause the most damage. Like a surgeon in a swordfight.
He slaps his hand on the table conclusively, and as everyone begins to rise and exit, Harry looks for Ron by the door. Mari briefly lays a supportive hand on his shoulder, offering him a smile, and when he looks back, the tall man is nowhere to be seen.
“Actually, if you’re up for it, I was hoping you’d stop by my office later. I’d like to speak about the case.”
Harry laughs, so genuine that it startles Draco, and then he turns and locks eyes with him again. The smile falls a little, from a full grin to something shrewder, his eyes sparkling darkly, and Draco’s hit again with a twisting feeling that he’s out of the loop.
Draco feels as though his arm is close to falling off. “Thank you, Professor Flitwick,” he says earnestly, extracting his hand.
If he were to risk a guess, it would be a sobering one; Harry stares into Draco’s eyes like he’s guessed every thought behind them. Or like while Draco lives in this huge what-if, he knows what’s going to happen next. If nothing else, he at least knows what he wants to say—
… He lets it wash over him like a quick breeze, long past latching on to whatever inaccuracies keep her from falling apart.
“Blast,” Draco growls, kicking the pieces. He points a finger at Harry. “Don’t laugh.”
, he writes beside a passage. Or
“Yes. Well. Regardless, you’re a huge help, I couldn’t have gotten this far without you, and you work so hard… I’m hoping you’ll still help me.”
Ron’s face twists and he whispers despite the silencing charm. “Are you insane? They won’t let you in. It’s a bad idea. And you don’t want to implicate him further by causing problems.”
“Mm. You look dashing, but it needs to hang.
“Jesus! I didn’t think you were awake! Your eyeballs caught me by surprise.”
Draco nods slowly.
At the first sip, he recognises it and downs the rest quickly. It fills him with warmth and slows his racing heart. He finally risks meeting Harry’s eyes. Instantly, he groans in anticipation. “I don’t want to hear it.”
“She moved in from France. Seemed unnecessary to get a second property. Why did you separate?”
of it. I don’t want to be just a dad, I want to be a best mate and someone’s favourite coworker and a good husband, and that involves hearing your shit, yeah?”
“She always does this,” he’d grunted as he lifted the bag off the counter.
“Then
“You too! Barely got to catch up at the gala!” Harry replies. “No lion’s head this year?” He nods to her cap.
He doesn’t think, just acts. It’s everything Draco might disprove of, but he has trouble believing Draco wouldn’t do the same if he were here tonight and Harry was in danger and there’s no time to be an improved version of himself so he tears the map right from the wall, charms it smaller, and escapes to the pavement outside. He disapparates as accurately to the coordinates as possible, within a few streets, then charms
“Merlin’s fucking bollocks, here to gloat?” he jabs instantly. Wounding Harry must still come as natural as breathing.
They begin as they always do, with drills focusing on specific skills, but the tension Draco felt in the study has followed him into the training room like a shadow. He ignores it the best he can. Harry, meanwhile, spurred by his proficiency at Jab, is challenging him more than usual, and pushing him to work harder.
“Yes, all silver. Been Ministry property for probably a century.”
“Tall with a blonde ponytail,
“Er, why the hands?”
“You’re being nice.”
“Malfoy?”
sartorial advice.”
An hour after their dinner break he’d felt for a trace on Draco’s wand and described it as “like, er, magnets, maybe.” This, at last, encouraged Draco to call it a night, only after promising Harry he could come back the next day.
“I don’t know,” she sighs. “Because all I can do is feed you.”
“Want me to talk about mine?”
“Okay. Okay, Harry.” Hermione dives after the books, running a shaking hand down the index of one. She tosses it aside and grabs the second—Harry recognises heart wrenchingly that it’s the curse diagnostics book he’d picked up in the Mayakara Bazaar—to do the same, and this time flips open to a page halfway through a book. “This might work,” she says, but doesn’t act. She continues reading the page, almost leisurely, though Harry knows this is his panic talking.
“Maybe some breakfast?” he chuckles. Shock and not disappointment, then, if Harry Potter is forgetting a meal.
Until now, this had gone unmentioned. The rest of the Black family was a sore subject for Narcissa, and he didn’t want to offend by leaving the property while she was expecting his help, but if she was proposing it too, it would be a rather helpful trip to make.
get along with. We hated each other. Always trying to get under each other’s skin. It completely threw me off. Then
He grants Draco a warm look, thoughtful and overfilled with appreciation, then nudges Draco’s shoulder. “You know what’s funny?”
*****
He smiles. “Love to.”
Draco catches Jack’s eye with a wide smug grin, eyes wild and stature pompous. He bends at the waist and leans his head forward, cheating his left cheek towards his opponent. With his teeth flashing, more disturbing with the mouthguard in, he taps a pointer finger brazenly to his jaw, as if to say
All that considered, Draco has not planned on enjoying his time at the Ministry. He wonders, not for the first time, if Flitwick had ulterior motives for forcing his attendance, considering his tendency to challenge Draco into taking the harder path.
Harry hadn’t been watching, though, and is instead sitting concentrated with his eyes closed, lighter than before, his mouth softly shut. He’s focused.
“Better not,” Harry says.
“Of course,” Ron shakes his head. “The moral of the story has been right before us this whole time; your
Draco props himself up rather abruptly, meeting his eyes for the first time in half an hour. “You know that speech was terrible?”
Draco parts his lips to say something, to find a way to call Harry something, too, but it all feels insufficient, incapable of providing an appropriate description for the man above him.
Flustered but satisfied, Draco sits across from him and focuses on his breakfast quietly.
“No ‘and’. That’s it.”
“Where is he? Draco Malfoy was in this cell,” he asks, spinning abruptly to the approaching wizard. His eyes are wide, mouth open, clearly not expecting Harry Potter to cause such a commotion during his run-of-the-mill night shift. He stammers nervously.
…” he tries.
“Thank you,” says Potter, as if Draco has complimented him. “I worked very hard on that.”
“Oh, no. That went over my head. I assumed that was your usual concern for a colleague.”
Ginny pursed her lips and shook her head with glassy eyes. “Then we’ll ride out the worst of it.” As she closed the gap between them, she lifted his chin with delicate fingers to meet her eyes. Her face this close was splotchy, her nose redder than Harry thought, and when she spoke again, her voice broke. “I can’t-
The question holds Malfoy’s attention more than the last. He meets Harry’s eyes at length for the first time today. “Pardon?”
He knows only that he’d been woken from sleep by a harsh pounding, thrown behind a closed door yet again, and forced to listen with an ear to the wood to hear anything at all. He couldn’t place any of the voices, but he
Harry crawls onto Draco’s bed and sits beside where he stands combing his hair. It had taken a moment too long to tell him whether he slept well, and when he did it was followed by a nice smile that would have been acceptable if Draco hadn’t gotten to know his expressions so well. When he says, “Where to, O holder of secrets?” there’s a flicker in his eye that doesn’t quite match his cheeriness.
Suddenly, Draco swivels up, his feet falling to plant themselves on either side of Harry, almost knocking his coffee over. It’s hard not to laugh at the dichotomy between what had been occupying his anxieties and the very limbs in question, now so close that they’re pinning him in. He won’t flatter himself—Draco hasn’t noticed his foot on the biscuit plate either. He’s too preoccupied to be allergic to Harry’s touch.
Mondays. A sort of start of the week, end of the week catharsis.”
He does his best to explain the very specific terror he felt outside the Ministry—at this, Blaise meets his gaze more knowingly than Harry could ever manage, something he’s always grateful for from his Slytherin friends—and then the surprising way that tracing the cursed package to Harry stilled his heart.

“Erickson doesn’t mention once in his interview that he recognised you,” Harry says from the floor, flipping through some papers with confusion.
myself pushing him away before I’d comprehended it. I think there’s just too much on my plate, what with this big Ministry case, and… yeah.”
“Hair’s getting long,” she says absently.
“Open it,” he instructs before Harry can get too excited. The pages are all blank. He fans through them anyway. “It’s a mock-up, because I’m on final edits.”
“Alright, no need to patronise me.”
He follows Draco out of the store like a puppy and pays for dinner in a continual apology for the mess he made at Kanpai, despite his friend’s protests. There’s a single reporter outside Draco’s building and she looks incredibly excited to see them. Draco sighs beside him and he fights the urge to apologise again, for existing, maybe—sweeping through Diagon Alley during rush hour in his black Auror robes was an invitation for the press.
“What

Many many thanks to those who've read this story, commented to bolster me through weeks of daily edits, and left kudos, and thanks to those who find this finished and get to read front to end!
Harry considers saying nothing, just as he had when he rejoined them from the beer garden. But it’s clear that he’s been found out regardless, and he reckons disparaging Malfoy had always been therapeutic in the past...
“Going somewhere high-class after this, mate?” he says to Draco in lieu of a greeting.
“Draco Malfoy,” the woman says as she enters—one of the Aurors he’d seen at the hospital. Murray stands looming in the shadows behind her, staring him down intensely, alongside two more Aurors.
“Would you… care to extend your stay?” he says with an eyebrow raised when Malfoy stays frozen.
“I think that’s the one thing you don’t need to worry about,” she tells him. “I know what it feels like to receive your love—I’m not jumping ahead to say that’s what this is. But you obviously care about him, and… if he’s on the other end of that, then he’s won the lottery. I would know.”
Harry laughs at the presumption that this is a temporary improvement. “I am going out. After I drop you off, I’m meeting some mates.”
Twelve Grimmauld Place is scraping into view, uprooting concrete and brick, and when the old stoop is complete Harry walks to the door and unlocks it with his wand. The familiar raspy voice greets him as he crosses the threshold.
He’s opening the door before Draco can contemplate the added confusion in his answer and gestures for him to enter, so he does, Potter right behind him.
He’s angry about being the Ministry’s puppet, only respected when PR finds it necessary. He’s angry at himself for caring about his job enough to not let all this affect his efforts.
Draco’s quill stands at attention.
Pansy slides out of the booth so he can get by. The bar is crowded, and so when he pushes through, he perches by the corner, waiting patiently to get the barman’s attention. He might have never noticed the group seated near the entrance if it hadn’t been for an extremely angry, towering man yelling at the radio over the din.
“Can’t miss them. I was thinking of pinching some for Hermione.”
The second interruption begins with a polite knock later that afternoon, and when Harry calls out to come in, he’s surprised to see his first interruption’s wife. He beams when Hermione peeks her head, setting his work down completely.
“His son was Fleamont Potter, whose son, obviously, was James.”
“Draco, you were Obliviated,” he says urgently.
When Ron falls into the office chair, it’s with a bitter sigh that Harry wishes he didn’t recognise. It’s one of exhaustion—with the job and with the people—and the fact that he’s most definitely had the same reaction sends his thoughts spiralling towards Ron’s most recent suggestion of resignation in the garden.
*****
For a moment, he looks shocked that after it all Draco’s had the gumption, but he breaks into a rueful, tight-lipped smile, a tired lightness in his voice.
He left with new friends and memories and even new work with his own name on it—Flitwick had been impressed when he’d managed to invent a new charm as his final proof of mastery at the end of his second year. It was a protection spell that, when placed on thresholds, sank deeper than the foundation and became a part of the building’s construction, without changing the essential nature of the structure. It was practically foolproof and would take a talented wizard hours to break—plenty of time for anyone inside to apparate to safety.
“I’d like to request honesty, this once, and after that do as you will,” he says quietly.
Hermione gasps and Harry slaps a hand over his neck where Ron is pointing, scandalised.
“It’s Harry Potter, he could sneeze and we’d find a write-up,” Blaise shrugs.
?” Harry sounded sceptical, but stretched tall, feeling for the tool and settling back on his heels successfully. The fridge is an antique, like much of Draco’s furnishings, and closer to an old-fashioned icebox than to Harry’s stainless steel model. He said as much.
“We’re coming,” he says, looking to the side where Harry guesses Hermione’s appeared.
“Luna’s a compassionate girl. If she’s somehow made me a friend, you’re a shoo-in.”
“Yes, I expect we will,” she said warmly in return, swirling the wine in her glass by her nose and setting it back down with a frown. “I’ve heard diverse things about you, Harry—good and bad—and it’ll be a delight to put some of them to rest. To discover this relationship through a
“Er, where’s the chair?” he asked immediately, dropping his papers to the floor with a slap.
The gathered crowd looks down at their feet, or each other. Anywhere but Harry.
Just wanted to say a quick thanks for the comments and kudos! I've been prioritising updates to responding, but every one is the sweetest encouragement. I'm glad everyone's enjoying... almost halfway through!
Harry shrugs. They stand for a minute together, but Ron’s the spotlight of the party and it’s not often that Harry gets to disappear into the background, so he pats him on the shoulder and escapes between two heartfelt goodbyes from colleagues, walking past to the other end of the table where the young Auror Shohre stands picking over the sandwiches.
“Cassie’s father once had a small legal battle with your parents about land that was settled amicably, but looks worse on paper—the curser is obviously using minimal information to set you up. The case has been tabled by Murray, it’s no longer under my jurisdiction, and an anonymous curse specialist has been hired, and all the case evidence has disappeared to that unknown person…”
“I walked
They glance at each other. “Harry, we love Draco,” Ron begins.
“We did fight this,” Draco says, shifting so that he’s eye-to-eye with Harry, their noses almost touching.
“I fought the other day,” Draco clarifies dismissively, hoping to move on fast.
The door slams and Draco is glad for him to go.
They fall easily into their habit—him flopping back down in the reading chair while Harry heads for the kitchen, grabbing a handful of biscuits and making a cup of coffee.
“Oh no,” Draco cringes.
He grabs his arm, drawing him from his sun-soaked trance and towards the busy streets of the city. He has ‘
Somehow not a single complete sentence, and yet Draco completely understands. Moreover, he feels a rush of guilt swirl through his belly, knowing that Harry’s having the very prevalent straight friend paranoia of
Draco stops and faces him, their hands still linked. “Do you want me to let go?”
He falls into the seat opposite him, against the wall, with a tight nod and a file clutched closely to his chest. Malfoy’s cup is half empty, and the tail end of a croissant remains on his plate.
,” ripping one from the branches and sending it speeding towards them like a Bludger. They dive towards the centre of the boat when it hits the water with a loud smack, leaving a momentary crater and spout of water before sinking.
“We certainly can’t tell him, it’ll just make things worse—Rosie, Uncle Harry is sleeping, we need quiet voices! Shhhh—he’s in a state as it is, and he’s going to want to take you to the Ministry today, which means it’s in both of your best interests to keep him on his game.”
“We have Rose. We also have you. And Ginny. And George… There’s no priority on who we can love and care for.”
Draco’s smile grows slowly as he waits, feeling the tingle of the kiss still lingering on his lips.
“Yeah,” agrees Draco, begrudgingly.
“I never thought… There was—thank god,” Draco says, inarticulate and inadequate.
The next hour is spent contently. They keep an eye on the game (England was closing the gap) while catching up on each other’s jobs, lives, and old wizarding family gossip. The web of intermarried pureblood families made for complex drama. Blaise, of course, is usually a bit tight-lipped—a Venn diagram of old pureblood families and his clientele was often a circle—but this always inspires Pansy to declare her hypotheses and watch his face for any tells.
“He what?”
He follows her finger, then turns with his brow furrowed in disbelief. “Well, I’d expect you to look a little out of breath after you’ve just won the World Cup.”
“Don’t be, the ink disappeared so easily. And it was funny.”
He’d wanted to kiss him so badly that whole trip, could barely think of another way that would thank him sufficiently for what he’d done, though the feeling had never surfaced in his thoughts as more than a general skip of a heartbeat and a lingering stare when allowed.
“Auror Potter, what an ordeal! Thank Merlin, I said, ‘my
Draco looks over his shoulder to see his spot, then nods approvingly and turns away. While they sit in this quietly shared moment, Harry feels, once again, a deep affection for this friendship he hadn’t expected.
He takes it, holds it close to his huddled form. “Thanks,” he says.
Harry pulls a face. Hermione chuckles and Ron grants them a tight humouring smile, too, but Draco doesn’t catch the quick look between them that Harry does. It raises his stress level higher.
Draco’s emotionally and physically exhausted by the time he climbs the spiral stairs back to McGonagall’s office. The delightful effects of a Cruciatus. Or possibly tea with his mother. They present similar symptoms.
information, just a warning… No, a 'quick update' I believe you called it, in the message. I don’t know who’s denser—you for going in alone or me for really thinking this would be a paper-pushing operation.”
There’s something robotic in Harry’s voice as he recounts the story, like the words pack less punch each time he tells it again. By the time he’s gotten to Malfoy’s stumbled exit, his soreness for the past has paled into concern for how to move forward.
Draco thinks. “Four days, maybe, to get through it all?”
Harry shrugs.
“It’s just you and me here. Let your…” He searches for a connection, for words. Draco loves words. “You know, put… your soft animal in charge, or whatever.”
—so long ago but it’s like he can feel his family in the walls. He pictures his ancestors stocking the shelves, standing behind the till, dashing out for lunch. He wonders if they lived above.
“Bloody hell,” Ron starts. “Forget tomorrow’s paper, you’ll be the front page for a year.
He looks around, hands shaking, and he can’t unlock the door—it can only do that for her—but he can lay his hand flat to it. That magic,
to-to friends, and coworkers, and fucking
“Tamil Nadu!
It reminds him of the identifiably specific traces he’d picked up the one time he’d traced Draco. As though he could feel the trace of just who charmed the necklace as clearly as if he was holding his arm like he’d held Draco’s.
“You know what? No. I’m not okay.”
His mouth is turned down grimly, his eyebrows low and his eyes intense with an anger Harry’s never seen and can only pray isn’t directed at him.
Something passes between them—the companionship of mutual hatred. “I hate to say it,” Ron adds, “but he’s worse than when Malfoy had an Imperius on the department. No offence. You can’t just Vanish a history of hating Malfoys, especially Lucius.”
“I’m starting to think you’re stalking me,” Harry says as he approaches.
“Just
Flitwick stands at that, coming around his desk to stand in front of Draco’s. He meets his eyes.
Ron rolls his eyes with a scoff. Hermione taps his hand and shakes her head before he can open his mouth, and Harry watches him visually unsour, popping the umbrella open and sticking it in Hermione’s curls.
, I was sharing something,” he says, rolling his eyes. He wants to mention Sirius again, but Teddy is young, and he has so many years to share stories. He takes their empty plates to the bin instead.
“You don’t smoke,” Harry mumbles.
She smiles sweetly, a distraction from how ruthlessly she’s about to steer the conversation back to him. “So, what happened outside the pub? Because you didn’t seem like you’d returned from a professional discussion of work.”
He watches Harry attempt to shove an object that must be his present—it was Disillusioned, so to him it just looks like something he’s forgotten the moment he looks away—into a smaller bag and resists the overbearing urge to remind him of Engorgement charms.
To an outsider, their occasional and growing inclination to finish each other’s sentences when they get going would be a good reason to spend some time apart. But there’s no outsider here to slow down their orbit.
She’ll see them both when Teddy’s home from school around half three, and this gives them time to kill while they wait. Harry lays on his back by the fire when the call ends, holding his hands up to the flame. Draco rounds the couch and lays next to him with a huff, staring up at the ceiling.
“I have to go,” he sighs.
“Other than me.”
“Yeah, her and you both,” Harry teased. “After your speech, of course.”
“Yes…”
“That’s very easy to say in hindsight,” Draco scowls. “I find you repulsive, so don’t let it go to your massive head.”
Beside him, Harry sees Draco’s mouth open and close, speechless, but he says nothing. Harry wouldn’t know what to say either. Even Hermione briefly widens her eyes in exasperation staring down at the table, but Ron’s an adult, and neither of them can do anything more to speed up a valid forgiveness process.
“Sure. Well… I guess we were wondering what your goal is… today?”
Harry’s presence was accepted as a professional inevitability and stayed that way for a long while. It was days before they spoke with anything past stiff formality.
A smile crosses her lips and she shifts the bag on her shoulder to sit better. “Tale as old as time, dear. I’m off, Draco, owl me soon.
, it says across the top, and then at the bottom, in a font a touch smaller (He’d argued for this; Marta said that by book four, an equal-sized author name was expected),
He doesn’t tell Draco this—he’d likely have to stop and explain spaceships and outer space and NASA and wormholes—but he does attribute it to this brief moment where they move on as if they both know about Flitwick and Hogwarts. In years of friendship, after all, such a mention should go unnoticed.
Rose looks at Ron’s outstretched hand but circumvents him to hug her mum, who gives her a big squeeze and a loud kiss with a ‘mwah’. Ron’s hand stays extended towards her patiently as she continues round the table to Harry, who leans down and kisses the top of her head twice, then nudges her back towards her dad.
“Article you’d appreciate. Page 10. Charms.”
“RON?!”
reasons. It’s not hard to imagine, is it? Even if we can’t find the specific motive?”
“How many books have I recommended over the years?”
Unfortunately, everything in the way he hasn't taken a lung-filling breath since he woke, hasn't stopped picturing a lifeless body, hasn't taken a moment to think before acting tells him it’s not this.
he thinks, glancing back at Draco’s still form. His own heart is pounding wild, accelerating steadily with his discovery and much faster than the gold charm that’s beating a slow pulse under his hand, but he’d wager that, were he to place his other hand lightly against Draco’s own chest as he drifted to sleep, the heartbeat underneath would match rather well.
at her office.”
They share a glance that, to someone in their orbit, would sound like Harry asking
It’s so quiet and strained and Not Draco. Neither is the distressed look on his face or the way he’s shifting from foot to foot.
“It’s not?”
Ron’s voice, once he’s folded his arms and tilted his head, is lax with wonder. “So that was odd.”
Harry’s eyes dart from Draco to Pansy to Blaise and back. “I already ate—“
“My love…” She reaches a palm out for his across the table and sandwiches it between her own manicured hands. “Hear my words when I say: this is not a call for you to add
She laughs and wags a finger at him. “That’s what you said last time.”
“Not a
“Why, are you
"When?"
“Jittery.” Harry moves closer to crouch on the rug in front of Draco’s seat, looking up with eyes sparkling darkly.
Was it worth it, to kiss Harry once? To risk destroying what they’d found? He could’ve held onto something amazing. He could’ve gone to sleep tonight without the image of Harry frozen in disgust. He could’ve worked on the locket tomorrow. He could’ve made it a full night without pacing the rooms like a phantom.
He orders it, with the same emergency tone he’d used at Flourish and Blotts, when urgent precision was of the utmost importance, and Harry looks stricken by the order. He’ll want to make a case for arguing for Draco, or stepping between him and the Aurors, and there’s no time for a Socratic seminar on the subject so he points his wand at Harry and selfishly studies his face one last time.
a curse, I suppose.”
“Even though it’s unsolved.”
He stops pacing and turns on his heels to study Harry. “Your
He dives in as quickly as though they’d never slowed into a diverted topic, rambling with a captivating excitement, his expression alive with thrill. It is infectious.
“I would.”
From the kitchen, then, he hears Andromeda shout “Volume!” dispassionately, but the sound of thundering feet draws his attention quickly back into the room as a blur dives at Harry. He swings the boy up over his shoulder easily into a fireman’s lift and Draco blinks in surprise when his hair flashes from blue to red to orange and back to blue, seemingly without Harry’s doing.
“And you’ve brought the most unexpected guest,” she says, looking to him now. He steps forward stiffly and holds out a hand, but she dismisses it to wrap him in a hug of his own. He’s too startled to return it, but she doesn’t seem to mind.
“I guess that’s first on my list. Start hunting down a specialist.”
“I should have you sign it.”
Draco smiles lightly, and Harry keeps glancing at him as though he can feel his stiffness and carefulness. He lays a hand on Draco’s knee and squeezes quickly, masking the brief affection by leaning in for his tea.
As dinner arrives, Pansy finally dives into her work gossip, which seems to entail an on-air argument between her boss and a fellow radio host. From the thrill in her eyes, it’s out of place for the station’s usual atmosphere.
“You’re
“I would’ve loved to see your face when he implied that any cheese potion was edible. Ah, Draco!”
Draco slides into his coat elegantly, in one fluid motion of long, flowing lines, and it settles onto his shoulders effortlessly. His hands reach up gracefully to flip the collar out and then run through his hair, as if to purposefully test Harry’s restraint when the locks by his temple fall forward from behind his ears. Perhaps on a less eventful day, he’d have the wherewithal to question why his first instinct is to fit them back in place.
hatefully. Draco turns and throws his coat at the table.
“It’s stagnant, Potter. Between Malfoy’s unproductive consultation and the inactivity on your end, there are no developments to follow. This classifies it as a dormant case, and as a result—“
“I. Stunned.
Pansy wipes her eyes and Draco grips the base of his seat firmly to keep his cool, face frozen in a scary smile. He feels a bit like he had when he walked away from Potter on the lift—a moment from cursing the next person to breathe too loud—but this time he can’t run to his friends to calm him down.
“I’m okay. How did you find me?”
And Sirius. Oh, Sirius. He saw his godfather leaning in every doorframe. On the second night, he laid in bed in the room he’d once shared with Ron, stared at the crackling, flaky ceiling and imagined a younger Sirius lying in bed two floors up, all swagger, cigarettes, and invincibility. Surely he too had spent his nights counting down the days until Hogwarts stole him from his miserable family? Harry ached for the stories he’d never hear.
He’s grinning like a cat. Draco’s reaching for any instance where he’s seen him quite like this. None come to mind. A new side of Harry is an intoxicating possibility.
The hand on Harry’s waist pushes and pulls steadfastly, and slowly he loosens the tight grip he has on Draco’s shoulder until he’s let himself be swept under his influence, a kite on a string.
“Small?”
is the first word that comes to mind. Unprincipled. That could’ve… are those my books?” He’s looking past a rather petulant Harry to the shelves by the telly, where all three of his published works sit in a neat stack.
“This case! I know. I’m sure it wasn’t supposed to reach the papers, but it sounds sizeable.”
“Alright, yeah,” Harry narrows his eyes as he nods, Draco seeming to confirm something with his swing. “You’re twisting your hips, but it needs to be lightyears faster than what you think. Like a snap.”
“Knowing what it tastes like is probably just as helpful as knowing what’s in it.”
She points a finger at him, vaguely threatening. “You’ll catch flies like that. I know when a compliment is well-deserved.” He closes his mouth, not sure when he’d let his surprise show so openly. “Off you go. And get that necklace owner’s permission, young man. Whatever it takes. A gentleman never tells.”
“It’s for repotting mandrakes—what do you
and kept as souvenirs, thanks to Pansy’s brilliance—carried him and Harry to the Malfoy chateau night-of, they looked approvingly handsome, like a perfect pair.
“Why the evasion?” Seamus replies. “You seein’ someone, Harry?”
“Harry, this is quite possibly the longest it’s ever been,” she chides even as she pulls him into a warmly-reciprocated hug.
His eyes widen. “I’m not going in, I’m staying here. I’ll work from the room, and-and if I need something, maybe Cassie—“
“I don’t have to give one Wednesday, for the record. Just sit and look pretty.”
“I was just thinking about getting some recommendations.”
“That’s too
“Yes, I… was, indeed.”
“Oh, I’ve stepped in it. She mentioned you two had been together previously. I’m sure she just assumed—“
He grins widely.
The veins in his neck tense, nostrils flaring, as the Aurors who had just been staring unhelpfully at the woman grip him unnecessarily hard for someone who’s already magically bound.
Draco can’t argue with that—if he were Harry he’d also feel as though he’d had enough change for a lifetime. “Well then I’m glad this was a good surprise,” he says, “It seems… long overdue. I’m sorry it took reuniting with someone you hated against all odds at twenty-seven to get here.”
They share a happy glance and Harry smiles while he chews, eyes shifting from one friend to the other. He doesn’t feel the strangely latent jealousy that used to hit him sometimes. He shares glances too, these days.
“Pizza? Okay, I’ll… find a pizza shop. Just… er, sit. In there.” Draco shuts the fridge and guides him to the couch.
He conjures back that feeling in the bookshop, of expecting the nudge of magic from a cursed book and instead getting hit with a crashing wave from behind. He’s not sure how he kept his composure.
Ron cheers up at this with an easy grin, and he snatches the hat off. “Yeah, alright. Ready?”
Ron arrives just then, calling his name and listening to his shaky shout from upstairs and his eyes widen slightly at the sight of Draco. Harry had thought he’d looked dead when he’d walked in, with his unseeingly open eyes and the pinked patch of hair where his head had hit the sink on the way down.
“I have something to show you,” he buzzes.
“The dead man?” Harry repeats faintly.
“Yes, like… what’s that one I saw when—before?”
Draco does both, incapable of shutting up, and afterwards Harry props himself up over Draco, one arm on either side of his head, and stares down at him with a lopsided smile.
falls off his lap and onto the study floor.
Draco laughs out loud. Just yesterday, Blaise had appeared in his fire and asked him to play the part of the defence in a case he had a hearing for the following week. When Draco told him he was too busy
“Selfish!” He swings up and crashes the legs into the floor. They splinter off in all directions, and Dante, who had been lurking, no doubt feeling his anger, skitters away.
powerful trace. I’ll have to run diagnostics, but,” he turns to him again. “It didn’t
“Yes, I did and now he’s too smitten to think straight and we’re sitting in a hospital room. The situation at hand has changed. I’m just doing my due diligence.”
It’s baffling to him that Harry’s had this for so long, since that day in September. That though so much has changed, it’s still a perfect choice.
“Having tea with my mum in Chalais.”
“There is
that Draco found a cursed item addressed to you. A deadly one.”
“What about the rest of your heritage?” Draco points out, taking a bite of his sandwich.
“I think you were jealous.”
As they clean their plates, the conversation moves away from Draco and towards Hermione’s latest case; it included an issue of infidelity so confidential that she hasn’t even let Ron in on who it is. He’s busy guessing random wizarding celebrities, and Harry notices the ease with which he sits now, the way he leans back in the booth with his arm laying lovingly across Hermione’s shoulders.
He chuckles, returning from the locker alcove, at the sight of Draco sitting with perfect posture on the bench, looking strikingly out of place in a dress shirt and a pair of perfectly fitting charcoal grey slacks, complete with an iron-pressed crease down the centre of the legs. He looks like Harry’s agent in all ways but his inattention on the ring; instead, he’s actively studying the laces of his shoes with grave importance.
