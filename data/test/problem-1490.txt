"Thank you" Draco muttered to the elf as he vanished back to the kitchens.
"Calm down Potter, you'll be fine" Malfoy sounded exasperated as he continued to pack his luggage for the week "now come help"
Draco was slightly nervous about him coming to the Manor not only because of his father but also because he'd never had anyone in the house except Blaise. And here they were, about to go into his very private room.
I'm sending you some sweets, your favorite. Give some to your friends.
"What's wrong with you?" growled Malfoy, and he tightened his grip. Harry squealed. Yes, squealed like a little girl, and Malfoy loosened his grip while a little smirk printed itself on his face. Harry pouted.
The next morning, two letters were brought to him by Hedwig. He had been waiting for them anxiously. Harry immediately opened the one from Ron and read it, then read Hermione's. They were both going back! Harry had never been happier. Ron wrote about his summer, how they'd bought a new place to spend their time, and how everyone missed him – especially Molly and Ginny. He wished Harry was there with him, and couldn't wait to see him at the train station. Hermione's letter, on the other hand, was a bit scary. She was upset with him for not writing much, had pestered him because she'd been worried, and then told him that he should've known better than to ask her if she were going back…because, well, that was obvious! Harry was happy to receive her letter nonetheless.
"with Dumbledore" Harry's voice didn't sound very reassuring.
Harry felt a twinge of sadness. He wanted to hang out with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was alright, but he missed his room and his friends. He also missed the adventures they had together. Malfoy didn't seem to be the kind of person who would enjoy that.
He cleared his throat nervously “er…what do we do now?”
"Malfoy…" his voice sounded like a whisper "wha…what are you doing?"
As soon as Zabini closed the door, Malfoy yanked the sheets off the bed leaving Harry a bit taken aback.
Harry read the letter twice. T, he thought. Who is T? But before he could continue figuring out whom this T was, Malfoy opened the drawer so fast that Harry fell on his back.
"What for?" Malfoy asked, lowering Harry to the bed and sitting next to him.
"He'll stay with you, Mr Malfoy" he addressed Malfoy again "you shall not tell any other student of this incident, do you understand?" Malfoy nodded "very well, take him and follow me to see Professor Dumbledore then, we have a serious matter to discuss" he finished and started to the door.
"Draco doesn't show what he feels" he heard his mother say "he takes that from his father"
A pure-white peacock appeared, walking stiffly, arrogantly tossing his feathers in the air.
"Nott…it's too early, why are you here?" Harry heard Malfoy say grumpily and stiffened.
Harry drew closer to Malfoy, put his left hand on his shoulder, and when the blonde looked at him, he held his hand to him, which Malfoy reluctantly took. Ron did the same, before they all went in. A minute later, the Professor started explaining their new lesson.
Dumbledore eyed him suspiciously before starting "Harry, the time has come"
"I…er…well…" Potter was stuttering like an idiot "er…"
"I went to Snape's office to redo the Shrinking Solution and accidentally dropped the entire potion on myself" Harry sighed "I was even smaller than this!" he exclaimed pointing at his body, "they told me to stay with Malfoy because he's the only one who saw me" he continued to tell them the whole story. Both Ron and Hermione were still standing until they eventually sat down when Harry finished.
Wednesday, September 11th
Harry looked at him, and tried to push back the thoughts that were making their way to his mouth. He wanted to ask Malfoy why he was ignoring him, but he knew it didn't sound appropriate.
She smiled gently and glanced back at Harry, urging him to respond.
"Quite the romantic, aren't we Potter?" Malfoy smirked at him and Harry blushed "shut up"
"you noticed that, huh? Ok, it's a deal" Harry said, trying to recompose himself and sound unaffected by Malfoy's condition.
"Were you asleep?" asked Malfoy "sorry to wake you up, but I've brought you some toast with jam" he put the tray in front of Harry "didn't know what you'd want" muttered the blonde before sitting on a chair near his desk. The slice of bread was too big for Harry to carry, and Malfoy must have noticed because he grabbed his wand and cut it to small pieces. Harry ate silently after thanking Malfoy.
If someone had told Harry he’d be having dinner with the Malfoys in the Manor, he’d have laughed in their faces. Yet, here he was, with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy seated at their table while Malfoy finished getting dressed.
"Look Potter, I'm sure Dumbledore called Weasley and Granger and explained something to them before breakfast, I didn't notice anything strange in their behaviour" he said, putting the bag over one shoulder and preparing to go out "I'll try to ask Snape about it, but I'm not promising anything" he said in finality.
"you should tell him" Granger urged.
It wasn't as if Harry was attracted to him, but just the way Malfoy had just ignored him plain and simple, was driving Harry mad. It was quite disrespectful, in Harry's opinion, to ignore someone so. But nonetheless, he managed to pretend to listen to what his Professor was saying, and also managed to pass Hermione's critical eye.
"What's wrong, Harry?" Hermione began, and no matter how many times Harry assured her that there was nothing wrong, she didn't seem convinced at all.
Malfoy eyed him suspiciously, but Harry kept a blank face.
Harry was not jealous, of course he wasn't. He just wanted students to respect the school, and obviously that was against every rule! Well, there weren't any rules against it. But maybe there should be! They were basically snogging in the middle of breakfast! The Professors needed to do something about this foul behavior. Malfoy backed slightly, and Harry relaxed again in his seat, but then Malfoy smiled at Nott, drew closer, and whispered something in his ear. Harry felt like a dragon, blowing fire from both ears, and mouth, and he still felt like he was burning. But before he could do anything, Malfoy and his gang of four left the room.
"My great-grandfather" Draco answered "he built the Manor" Potter nodded and continued his explorations, Draco following behind as if taking someone on a tour.
Harry took a step back "almost where?"
"I levitated…so what happened?" Harry wasn't interested in explaining this now. He wanted to hear about the incident from Malfoy.
He grabbed his wand and noticed that it was much easier to handle now. He was about the same height. He must have grown a little last night too.
"You have been living with Mr. Malfoy for a while now. How are you two getting along?" Dumbledore asked.
"How would I know?" sniped the blonde "it's not like he announced it during breakfast. Nobody noticed," he muttered "except your friends, I suppose," he continued upon seeing Harry's face. Harry's chest felt tight for a moment but he disregarded the feeling "did they look confused or upset?" he asked again, this time a bit reluctantly.
"I…I also liked…kissing you" Harry stammered, a blush creeping up his neck to his face.
"Er..." he muttered.
He berated himself as Malfoy's eyes snapped to him, shock written on his face. A moment later, Malfoy's face relaxed and Harry was met with a rare sight – Malfoy grinning.
Malfoy's playfulness immediately turned to his normal cold demeanor as he picked some clothes from his luggage and went to the bathroom to put them on.
"I told you, Potter, some things have to wait until you're the right size" Malfoy said as he arched his eyebrow and when Harry just looked at him with surprised and somewhat terrified eyes, Malfoy added "I'll let you finish" as he walked right out the door.
"mhm" answered Malfoy as he laid him down on the bed covering him with the sheets. But Harry didn't want to sleep at all. He wanted to know what happened between him and Nott.
When he laid his eyes on his previous home, he was surprised to find that it looked almost the same. There were, of course, a few cracks here and there, but other than that, it was just perfect.
Harry's ears perked up at the mention of the blonde "what do you mean?" he asked Hermione, as all of them sat close to the fire.
They reached Snape's office, and Malfoy was asked to put Harry on the desk and leave the two for some minutes. Harry was a little confused by all this. He was thinking of passing this year like any other student – normally. But that was not going to happen, again. And Harry had to deal with that.
They sat across from each other at his father's brown desk, which had taken most of the room's space.
"n-no…everyone" Harry muttered passing Malfoy and heading for the couch again "so…what else should we know?" he asked as he rubbed the back of his head.
Malfoy gave an exasperated sigh "I won't be late" he said while rubbing his forehead, clearly annoyed. He strode to his bed and grabbed Harry with his right hand. Harry felt like being on a broom. He flew up while the cold air rushed through his hair. Malfoy brought him up to his face and, to Harry's shock, gave a little chuckle "I never thought I'd see the day when famous Harry Potter would depend on me for entertainment."
"a few things that will come in handy" she said vaguely "I'll send you a letter soon" she added before she cast a spell on him, and within a moment, he found himself in front of the door to his room.
Please comment and review!
Harry ate lunch alone – one of the house-elves brought him some food – and he took a long nap.
"Dumbledore will close the school this weekend, he will tell everyone it's for a full cleaning against bugs, which have infested the castle, apparently" Zabini waved his hand dismissively "and all students will go back home…Potter will stay with you because you have become friends and you have invited him over"
Harry had no doubt he was going back to school. Even if his job as an auror were ready for him, he wouldn't feel right leaving school without finishing what was necessary. He wondered if the school would be the same or if it'd be ruins, like the last time he saw it. He wondered whether his friends would return as well. How would he feel when he's there without Hermione, Ron, or Neville? Maybe they'd choose to go back as well.
They all looked at him for some moments before Hermione asked "well, what do you think, Harry?" and Harry regretted not staying silent "I…I don't really know" he stammered.
It was almost ten at night, and Harry had to meet Malfoy. He made his way to their previous dorm, shuffling his feet as he did so. He kept imagining himself in the manor with Malfoy strutting around, sending the family servants to do his errands. Malfoy was no longer like that. A voice in his head reassured.
Harry looked up at Malfoy and smiled back.
"what's that?" Harry asked as he grabbed it.
"Password?" the fat lady said as he approached.
Malfoy looked so peaceful and Harry suddenly found himself inching closer to him. There was definitely something alluring about the blonde that Harry couldn’t pinpoint. He edged closer and he could feel the blonde’s warmth exuding from his body and Harry had an urge to touch him. His gaze lingered on Malfoy, but he didn’t dare move.
Malfoy chuckled again "did you miss me, Potter?" he said teasingly, and Harry's stupid heart thudded with excitement, but when Harry pouted and said "n…no" Malfoy laughed…actually laughed "of course not" he said, still chuckling slightly, obviously making fun of Harry.
Flitwick started explaining a new charm, and they were asked to perform it afterwards. Harry noticed Hermione going over to Ron and lifting his wand, while correcting his pronunciation. He smiled at his friends, and tried to do it himself. Instead of turning his quill to stone, however, he ended up blasting the whole desk. Apparently his pronunciation of "Duro" wasn't correct. The whole class started laughing, and while Flitwick tried to repair the desk, Harry noticed Malfoy look over and snicker. Harry smiled inwardly, and was thankful for his mistake.
When they stepped in, Harry suddenly became very aware that he and Malfoy were alone in the room.
"But there's already a Head Boy, Professor" Harry's low voice had succeeded in getting the three's attention.
"Look, Potter, I can't tell you anything except that Dumbledore knows what he's doing. So, shut up and help me pack" he ordered and got up, walking to the trunk by the wall.
"Silence" Snape drawled in his monotonic voice. "What is Golpalott's third law?" he began, and the class was dead silent, except for Hermione's huffs of annoyance because Snape won't see her "no one?" he drawled again "yes, Ms. Granger?" he asked, surprising everyone in class, especially Hermione, who looked taken aback for a second before she went on explaining what she knew: "Golpalott's third law states that the antidote for a blended poison cannot be created by finding an antidote to each poison separately, thus the potion maker must find a single ingredient that would make all the antidotes together a one combined potion that will counteract the poison" she finished proudly, but Harry was lost, and didn't quite understand what she just said. Instead, he was staring at the back of Malfoy's head, trying to figure out why he was staring. As Snape began to explain what the law was, and demonstrate how it actually worked, Harry slipped into his own daydream. He was on the Quidditch field, riding his broom, looking around and trying to find the snitch, Malfoy inches away from him, staring at Harry, obviously not caring where the snitch was. Harry stopped looking around, and stared at the blonde. The snitch hovered right above their heads, but none of them moved. They kept looking at each other, and Malfoy looked like a masterpiece, with his forehead dripping with sweat, and his eyes fixated on Harry.
Hermione looked at Harry with worried eyes, and he smiled at her. She managed to smile back, but the worry in her face didn't disappear. Immediately after they sat down, Snape came inside, his robe bellowing behind him.
Saying this while looking at Malfoy's face made Harry feel nervous, so he averted his eyes and blurted out "I like you Malfoy."
"I was just distracted" Harry waved his hand dismissively. Both his friends looked at him with wary eyes, but didn't say anything anymore.
With a frown on his face, he climbed down the dresser and into the bed.
"Harry" the old wizard whispered gently "Professor Snape won't be giving you any detention. However he does have a few words to say" and as soon as he finished his sentence, Snape came in from the next room – a tiny room filled with shelves and potions.
Breakfast was over soon. Harry had sat down, had some bread and butter, talked about Quidditch with Ron and Seamus, and headed to class with his friends walking along.
"there you are" and not waiting for an answer, "we're leaving" he continued with a tone of finality as if Harry didn't need any explanations.
Harry figured Malfoy wanted to hear him say it out loud. He felt embarrassed. He definitely did not want to elaborate on that "no, not like Ron" he said as he looked down at his shoes as if they were the most fascinating things.
Malfoy was clearly struggling to find something to say. He seemed to be pondering whether or not Harry's confession was true "what do you mean you like me?" Malfoy finally asked.
"Hey, what did Dumbledore say about my whereabouts?" asked Harry.
"but Professor, why would I do that? Why him? Can't we just…"
Malfoy tried to tease him as he has been doing lately, but Harry wasn't in the mood. He sulked all night as Malfoy went about doing more homework and reading. Harry ignored him and fell asleep.
As they walked towards the gardens, they noticed a house-elf with some juice standing at the elegant table near the fountain.
Thursday, September 12th
Saturday meant he'd have to stay with Malfoy all day. There were no classes, the Quidditch games haven't yet started and the Hogsmeade Weekend wasn't till next week. Whether Harry was happy about that or not was questionable.
"Shut it, Malfoy! It was all your fault" Harry wasn't really angry, he was just too excited. Malfoy stood abruptly, held Harry carefully in his hand – while Harry almost squeaked – and put him on the desk. He looked him over, and after a slight grin, offered him a handkerchief to cover himself.
"Oh don't mind him" said Narcissa, waving her hand dismissively "now Draco…" she walked over and laid her hand on Malfoy's shoulder "you'll show Harry…" she looked at him "can I call you Harry?" she smiled, more gently this time and Harry nodded "you'll show Harry your room and let him settle in...he must be exhausted….I'll send a house-elf with some food" Malfoy nodded.
“too risky, my father is always in his study at night. Tomorrow morning, you’ll carry me to the study and make sure no one goes in” Malfoy explained, and Harry nodded.
"What's wrong?" he sounded scared and upon seeing Harry with his hands grappling for the top of the sink he started laughing.
"What's wrong?" Malfoy asked softly, ignoring Harry's question. Harry was speechless. For the first time in his life, he was feeling something he'd never felt before. He was excited and scared. He couldn't explain how he felt…he wanted…he wanted Malfoy to kiss him. Harry felt like his heart was going to burst out of his chest. He was about to take a step back and try to regain his composure when Malfoy slowly slid his hands to Harry's waist gripping him and tugging him closer.
Harry drew a staggering breath, a wave of heat coursing through him as he heard Malfoy’s heavy breathing.
Draco gaped at him "where did you live?! A cottage?"
Disclaimer: everything belongs to J.k Rowling.
"I don't know" Harry said, but stopped when he noticed Hermione and Parkinson walking through the doors, both of them laughing with each other.
Malfoy was inches away from him and Harry wanted to kiss him again. He saw the blonde lean forward cautiously when a knock on the door caught them off guard.
Lucius's lip curled "I see" he said as he suddenly got up and made his way past them, heading for the door.
When Apparition was over, Ron joined Harry and Hermione in their common room. And Ginny joined the three of them.
"yeah Malfoy, I know what you'll say" Potter smiled "finally someone with some sense" he imitated Draco's voice very poorly and Draco couldn't help but smile "or something else about how you also don't like me" Potter said, somewhat sulkily.
Harry was bombarded with questions as soon as his foot was out of the door.
Snape moved closer to the desk, and pulled a chair to sit down. Malfoy followed as well. He laid Harry on the desk, and Dumbledore inched his head closer to look at Harry. All Harry could see were his twinkling eyes and his glasses.
Draco walked with Potter along the corridors of their house and went up the stairs to get to his bedroom, which was at the other end of the drawing-room where they were seated.
Hogwarts was left shattered after the war, he'd remembered, and it pained him to think of his school as mere ruins. But when he had received a letter from the school, he was surprised to say the least. He looked it over for about five minutes before daring to open it.
Monday, September 2nd
When he woke up, he felt extremely tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. Malfoy was already awake and had apparently just finished showering.
"I'm afraid we need your help one more time, Harry. The Death Eaters are getting stronger and we haven't found out who has been leading them. Professor Snape and I have been working on this since the beginning of this year, but to no avail."
"you know? Nott would pay to trade places with you right now" Malfoy teased as he raked his fingers through his wet hair, looking straight at Harry.
"Yes, Professor" Harry finally muttered. He knew he could trust Dumbledore, he didn't trust Malfoy or Snape however. Snape has been nicer to him, granted. But it was still Snape, it was very difficult for Harry to believe Snape could actually like him.
Chapter 14
"how exactly?" Harry fretted in his seat "well…I knew you liked green and silver, you always wear them together. I know you like Potions most and that you work really hard, especially in your studies. I know you want to work at the Ministry, like your father, and that when you feel like you've upset someone, you get angry and lash out at them, but you don't mean to" he stopped and then added "oh, and I know Zabini is your best friend"
"Thanks, Malfoy, that makes me feel so much better" Harry retorted fiercely.
"that's why no one asks you Potter" Malfoy said playfully. He then glanced back at Hermione "let's think this through, alright? If we can't think of something else to do, we'll go with your idea" Harry stared at Malfoy, trying to figure out if the blonde was actually serious, and when no one argued and he saw them all nod, he looked between his friends and Malfoy "you can't be seriously considering this? I…I can't be your boyfriend!"
"Potter" Malfoy started as he raised his head and rested it on top of both hands "I had a chat with Snape today" he continued. His voice sounded cautious, and a little pitiful, as if Harry was about to receive some bad news.
Harry rose from his chair and looked up at the figure now beside him. Lucius was much taller than Harry, with a pale complexion like his son, and similar grey eyes, except his were unpleasantly harsh and seemed to be piercing right through him.
"you can and you must" she told him before she turned to Malfoy "Harry is going to be bait"
Harry squirmed and scratched the back of his head. He had to meet Ron and Hermione in an hour, and he couldn't sneak out if Malfoy was there.
About an hour later, Malfoy was comfortably lying in his bed while Harry fidgeted, too shy to join the blonde. He stood there for a few moments before Malfoy noticed him.
"you're back" Harry mumbled lazily.
"I thought I'd come back before you wake up" said Malfoy as he looked down at Harry.
Harry frowned. He was still upset with Malfoy and he couldn't explain why. It's true that Malfoy had ignored him, but it wasn't the Slytherin's job to keep Harry entertained. He had done enough for him. Yet, Harry still had a nagging feeling of disappointment that Malfoy had left him alone all day.
"Mr. Potter" he said curtly "welcome to Malfoy Manor"
Malfoy sat up and grabbed him with his hand "you've always been an idiot, haven't you?" Malfoy smiled a little then sighed "it'll be alright Potter" but seeing Harry's still anxious face, he added jokingly "I even think it's better this way."
"I have to put you in my pocket again" Malfoy said, and Harry was sure he heard a tone of pity in his voice. He nodded and was immediately shoved into the tight place. Malfoy walked down the stairs and got out of the door very fast. He didn't talk to anyone on the way – he may have nodded to a few people, but Harry wouldn't have known, being inside his pocket and all. As soon as they were in the corridor of the cold dungeon, Harry popped his head out of Malfoy's pocket and started looking around as Malfoy continued to walk to their new room.
"Thanks" mumbled Harry "what should I do now? Just stay here alone?" He knew he sounded a bit sulky.
“in my defense, I didn’t know you were in love with someone” Malfoy winked at him.
Harry had finally gotten some time alone when Malfoy went out to talk to Nott after the latter came knocking on their door.
He was thinking about how it would have actually happened had Malfoy really asked him out when Malfoy almost yelled "Potter!". Startled, Harry snapped his eyes to look at the blonde "you scared me! Why are you shouting?"
Shortly after, a house-elf appeared with a tray full of food for both of them and laid it on the table. They sat and ate in silence, a bit awkwardly, until Potter commented "nice room" as he drank his juice.
Harry did not like this side of Malfoy at all. He made Harry act like a stupid girl with a crush. Harry pouted again and crossed his arms but said no more on the subject.
As he sat in the water, he relaxed his muscles and closed his eyes. He tried to think of himself flying on the Quidditch field and remembered an image he had seen before: Malfoy and he were staring at each other while sitting on their brooms in midair, the snitch hovering above their heads.
Harry was taken aback as the blonde sauntered towards him with a smirk plastered across his face. Harry kept opening and closing his mouth unable to say anything.
Hermione sat down, and was met with a pair of questioning eyes "what?" she asked, still smiling slightly.
Malfoy kissed his jaw down to his neck and Harry gasped which spurred Malfoy on even more. He bit on Harry’s shoulder through the fabric of his shirt and let his hands fall to his waist.
"don't get all upset" Malfoy nudged him playfully "I'm sorry…I'm an arse sometimes" Harry's eyes widened at the comment before he chuckled "yeah, you are"
"How exactly is this going to work?" Harry asked skeptically
"or maybe…in my shower?" Draco twirled his fork between his fingers "wherever you prefer"
Harry read aloud:
"Harry…" he heard Dumbledore's whisper-like voice and turned his head back up "you are the only person I trust. Lucius might be hiding information, the Ministry might not divulge all either, and Mr. Malfoy...well he has definitely changed, but he has always been on his father's side" Dumbledore gave a small sigh "I wish I didn't have to put you through this again." He looked grave as he stared down his crooked nose at Harry.
When Malfoy joined him in bed, Harry took a deep breath "Malfoy" he poked the blonde who had laid there with his back to Harry. Malfoy turned his head towards him, and unable to see him clearly, turned the rest of his body.
He'd laid on his bed, grinning like an idiot, but couldn't stop himself. He could only hope Ron and Hermione wanted to go back, because it wouldn't be the same without them.
"I don't have my wand" Harry pouted.
"Weasley" Zabini began, smiling "Potter" he nodded. Malfoy stood there, but didn't say a word.
When he finished writing his letters, he attached them to Hedwig's legs and opened the window for her to fly – after giving her some treats of course.
"I…erm…don't you have class?" The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them. Malfoy smirked "is that the problem Potter? Worried I'd miss class?" and Harry just lay there looking puzzled and unsure of what to say or do as he watched Malfoy.
He wasn't sure whether or not his eyes had deceived him. He was very small indeed, and the dresser was a bit far. He tried to walk on the huge bed, stumbling more than once on the curves of the sheets. He was lucky he was this small, to be honest. Malfoy didn't seem to hear a thing.
Malfoy huffed "I finished packing, I'll be back later" he told Harry in passing as he left the room, leaving Harry no time to comment or object.
"of course not, you idiot, not since 4th year"
"so you're snooping on me now?" Malfoy's expression hardened.
"Not staying long" Harry blurted. He had wanted to thank Malfoy for saving his life from the horror-sheets, but Harry's mouth had a mind of its own.
"Yes, one" replied Harry automatically as if rehearsing for a test.
Harry's brows furrowed as he eyed the letter. He was glad he could get some information in his current state, since Malfoy didn't seem to care about telling Harry anything. He sighed exasperatedly and continued reading:
"What?" she asked, after shaking her head disapprovingly.
"You could shower with a spell" Malfoy offered, but Harry wasn't a fan of that. So, instead, Malfoy suggested Harry shower in the sink, to which he agreed.
Ron muttered the password as the three of them went inside. He told his friends what happened as they sat on the squashy armchairs.
As they approached the front door, Harry was about to knock but Malfoy stopped him. Instead, the blonde moved in front of the door and it swung inward. Harry had never seen anything like this in his life, and he wasn't sure he liked it.
"I didn't sleep on you! I must have rolled over accidentally!" Harry said, sounding frustrated.
Zabini didn't say anything else. He held his hand to Ron, and waited till Ron took it in his. They shook hands, and Harry did as well. Malfoy just stood there.
Draco smirked. Sometimes, he forgot how alike he and his father were.
Malfoy sighed and got up from the bed "you think too much" he replied as he walked to the couch and sat there. "I've had to think too much" Harry muttered under his breath, more to himself than to Malfoy.
"how?" Malfoy looked between Harry and the bathroom on the other side of the room.
"Oh, I'm so sorry Harry" she let go of him "I just miss you! You didn't write much" Hermione looked at him with an accusing expression.
"So, you're telling me you've been with Malfoy all this time?" Hermione asked incredulously
"oh shut up" Harry pouted "what were you going to ask me?" he sat back on the couch as he eyed the blonde next to him.
"you've always been a child Potter" Malfoy chuckled as he looked at Harry, who couldn't help but chuckle as well.
Chapter 1
Malfoy didn't move. Instead, he gave his father a stern look and said "Potter is staying in my room, father"
"where were we?" he heard Malfoy whisper right next to his ear and felt goosebumps run down his entire body. Malfoy started slowly kissing his neck down to his shoulder. Harry wanted to say something…anything…but he couldn't. He was shivering and trembling, his body betraying him as he let out a small moan.
Harry took off his clothes and grabbed the edge of the sink then went down slowly. It felt refreshing to sit and bathe in the soapy water. He washed and was trying to get out, but he kept sliding back down. He tried again and again but he felt slippery and kept falling back into the now slightly cold water. He called out for Malfoy and he could hear the blonde rushing over.
"It's just so sudden. I mean, there's already a Head Boy. We never have two Head Boys," Zabini sounded almost hurt. Harry didn't think he sounded jealous though.
"what if you say he's your boyfriend?" Hermione suggested and Harry almost squealed "what?!"
They met Malfoy, Zabini, and Parkinson outside, while Crabbe and Goyle stood behind. None of the Slytherins even so much as looked their way. They stopped talking as soon as they saw the trio heading their way, and entered the class silently. Harry eyed Malfoy. He had definitely changed. His hair was no longer slicked back, his eyes were darker, his slender form had grown immensely, and his expression showed some tiredness behind it.
"What kind of question is this Malfoy? I doubt your mother will ask me that!" Harry said a little edgily as he tried to regain his composure.
"Awake at last" he said to Harry as he dried his hair.
He made his way to his dorms, and explained to his friends what had occurred. Most of them didn't believe him the first time. It was just too surreal.
Harry mused before he answered, "what's the condition?" he needed to weigh his options. Malfoy was a Slytherin after all, and he wouldn't divulge information unless he was getting something worthy in exchange.
"what? You overreacting again and bursting out of the room, then talking to my mother?" Draco asked rhetorically "don't worry, it's nothing" he waved his hand derisively.
"you are so obvious" Malfoy got up and stood in front of Harry "get up…let me see how tall you are"
Harry's hand moved up to the back of Malfoy's neck grabbing a fistful of hair, and Malfoy pulled him closer against his body.
Harry got out of the water as fast as he could, levitated himself while still naked to the edge of the bathroom door where he could try to see what was going on without being noticed and his heart fell.
Chapter 3
"he's been busy!" Hermione explained, moving her hand behind Ron and slapping Zabini on his head.
"you can be such an arse sometimes" Potter said, pushing his chair and marching back inside the house.
He still went, however, to his Muggle Studies class since it was an elective, and not many Slytherins were there – maybe one or two. Harry spent it remembering his embarrassing attempt at brewing a perfect potion.
"Good morning" she said, and Harry turned to see who it was. He was met with a very sleepy Padma. She had her hair tied back, and was wearing what looked like a nightgown. Harry smiled and returned her greeting.
"it's triple the size of the room I had" Potter muttered and Draco looked up at him "what? That can't be"
A knock on their door made Harry jump in surprise. Harry heard Malfoy struggling out of bed and making his way to the door.
“stylishly late, father” Malfoy said as he sauntered into the room and sat next to Harry.
The door suddenly snapped open, and he heard someone call "Professor!" he turned to look at who it was, and knocked the cauldron in his way, which fell all over him, covering him with green liquid. He barely noticed a patch of platinum-blonde hair before he felt himself shrink and couldn't see anything but the foot of the desk.
"Why?"
Malfoy moved in his spot, he turned so his back was to the other side of the couch, and he faced Harry directly. "you like me like you like Weasley, you mean?" Malfoy wondered.
Malfoy's face was directly above his, and Harry could only look up in surprise, opening and closing his mouth while his body lay there motionless under the weight of the blonde.
"You're finally awake" Harry heard as he opened his eyes. Malfoy was lounging on a small couch at the side of the room, a book in his hand.
Harry was nervous. Not only was he going to someone else's house, but that house was also Malfoy's. They moved forward in silence, Harry looking around him, taking in the amount of wilderness that had enveloped the area.
"Mr. Potter, should I bring a pillow for your comfort?" Snape almost sneered at him. Well, that was definitely an improvement on the last insult Harry had gotten from him. Perhaps the war and everything that happened last year changed him.
"Is this about my father?" Malfoy sounded like he expected all of this to happen, which perplexed Harry even more.
Harry avoided eye contact with the blonde "so you liked kissing him before?" he uttered with a tinge of jealousy in his voice.
"What time is it?" asked Harry, rubbing his sleepy eyes.
The Gryffindor had to listen to Zabini's singing – which wasn't pleasant, to say the least. Crabbe and Goyle had joined later. They were chatting about the Quidditch game on Saturday, and Harry wanted to join the conversation as he had some comments of his own. To his surprise, Zabini was telling them how great Ron was as a Keeper.
"Who has changed?" Harry asked intrigued "Seamus, Dean, and Neville are all the same, doubt any of the girls did" Ron nodded in agreement.
"We saw him yesterday, he was with that Parkinson girl, I think they are dating, lucky witch! He is so bloody handsome" she continued, and went on and on about this person and that person, and who they were dating, and Harry wasn't interested anymore. He didn't take that walk either, because he didn't want to be rude. So he sat down next to her, and tried to ask her about Malfoy again until his friends joined them, and they headed to breakfast together.
Why on earth was Potter saying this to his mother?
"What on earth are you doing?" Malfoy sounded mad. Harry looked up at him innocently "nothing" he muttered. The note was still in his hands since he had no way of hiding it.
"I don't bite, Potter" Malfoy arched his eyebrow "not yet, at least" he said teasingly, and Harry rolled his eyes and walked over to sit next to him.
"why can't I just sleep in another room then?" he opted to ask
"oh shut up" Malfoy replied but laughed with him anyway.
"I'm sorry" Nott said quietly and stared at the floor for a moment before he raised his head up to look at the blonde, still unable to say anything else "I thought…I thought I would try" he said then smiled sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head "you're not going to curse me, are you?" he chuckled.
"you know your father, Draco, always keeping busy" he gave him a suggestive look that both terrified and reassured him.
He exclaimed "you're taller!" and Harry looked down at himself as if he could have noticed the difference. Looking back up at Malfoy, the blonde carried him to the mirror on top of the sink in the bathroom and put him on his shoulder.
"Later tomorrow"
"Potter, I leave you with the simplest potion this year, and look what happens" Snape said "how pitiful" he drawled, he did look sympathetic though. Malfoy just stood there, looking down at Harry, with a grin all over his face.
"don't get all cocky" Harry puffed and crossed his arms together.
"That's not fair Malfoy!" Harry complained "you only answered the easy ones!"
"Mr. Potter" Snape drawled "you will come to my office later to brew another one. Meanwhile, let Ms. Davis finish this one without any further complications" he turned his head and walked back to his desk. Harry couldn't meet anyone's eye. He just sat there until class ended, berating himself for messing up again.
Lucius walked to the head of the table on the far end and took a seat, indicating for Harry to do the same.
Harry headed to their common room with Ginny and Dean, and was reminded of his detention before reaching the Fat Lady portrait. He huffed in annoyance, and headed down to the Dungeons.
"Er…" Harry muttered as he got off the couch and walked around the room "I just notice things, I guess" he said awkwardly, his back still to the blonde.
"no one is asking you to be my boyfriend, Potter, you'll only have to pretend" Malfoy explained "I think the hard part is going to be me pretending I ever asked you out" he chuckled seeing Harry gape at him. Hermione, Ron and Zabini laughed and Harry just sighed in resignation.
"I'm sorry…this is strange…us…doing all this" Harry said still wrapped up in his own thoughts and not entirely focused.
"stop laughing at me and help me out!" Harry yelled at him. Malfoy took the towel he had shrunk for Harry and helped the young boy out of the sink.
"Draco…" she drawled with a warning tone to her voice.
Hermione was beyond busy, scribbling down every syllable, and ignoring Harry and Ron's attempts at conversation. She gave them stern looks, and shushed them a few too many times. But neither of them did. The lesson was just too long and too boring for their taste, and they basically ran out of the classroom as soon as the bell rang.
I know you're upset, but I want you to let your father deal with all of this. He is taking care of everything and will send you a letter soon.
Malfoy leaned back and shrugged "I've got nothing to lose, plus he's not a bad kisser"
He was so proud of himself, and couldn't wait for Snape to see how well he'd done. He grabbed the cauldron from both sides and inched closer to look at it.
He saw his mother smile as Potter glanced around absently.
"Well, then I'm not going to answer" Harry bellowed as he got off the couch and stomped to the bed, his hands clenched into tight fists at his sides.
Harry averted his eyes "no" he said unconvincingly
"How did we start dating?" Malfoy asked him.
"No, Sir" Harry muttered and lowered his head "Sorry" but apparently Snape wasn't quite done with him.
"I'm glad you came" said a voice and Harry turned around.
Sunday, September 1st
Malfoy dressed quietly, only glancing in Harry's direction once.
"what?"
"yeah, I'm a child now" he said pointing at himself.
If he told Malfoy the truth that he's been staring because he thought the blonde was up to something then Malfoy would definitely not tell him what Nott was thanking him for. He probably had to play on Malfoy's big ego to get a real answer.
After what felt like an eternity, Malfoy finally reached his bedroom. Harry only heard the crack of a door, and Malfoy's hushed voice telling Crabbe and Goyle to leave the room – to which they had no opposition.
"No one will believe this Blaise. I wouldn't invite people to the manor, even if we were friends, especially with my mother and father there…drop it, you need to find another way"
Malfoy got up and moved towards the chest at the foot of the bed. He bent down and opened it slowly, reaching down for something Harry couldn’t see.
He inched closer to the tray of food and started chewing on the bread and butter Malfoy had brought him. After he finished eating, he had a wild thought of trying to leave the room and go out for some air. He walked up to the head of the bed, the action becoming easier now, and when reaching the stand near it, he climbed up rather easily and opened the first drawer where he remembered Malfoy had put his wand.
Dumbledore finally turned to Harry and smiled slightly while both his eyes twinkled.
Scanning the room one more time, Potter turned to Draco with a confused expression "where will I sleep?"
"about Potter…" Draco started. He didn't want to talk about the Gryffindor at all, but he wanted to start a conversation that might lead them to a clue. The faster they find something, the less time he has to spend with the brunette.
"Then don't go out with Nott, simple as that"
They reached Dumbledore's office, and saw the headmaster sitting on his chair as usual with his hands knotted before him.
"I saw you earlier when Nott kissed you" Harry hastily explained "but I didn't want to say anything" he added, hoping Malfoy wouldn't be upset with him.
Harry looked taken aback. How on earth was he supposed to stay in this house for a week?
They sat for a while in awkward silence and sipped on their juice till Potter moved his chair slightly backward and said "sorry about earlier"
It was six in the morning, and Harry was much too awake to sleep again. He headed to the bathroom, took a quick shower, brushed his teeth, and went down to the common room. It was empty, and Harry was about to walk out when a girlish voice stopped him.
After breakfast, the trio headed to their first class for the day – Potions. Harry was even excited; he had promised himself to try harder since Snape seemed to have changed his attitude towards him. He was going to concentrate, and was going to brew any potion Snape assigned perfectly.
"Don't worry, Professor Snape will of course take care of this" he said, and Snape made a discontented huff, but said no more.
"What was that all about?" Harry asked, while Ron dug in his food again.
It took them about an hour to get to Wiltshire, where the Malfoy Manor was located.
Your father and I are very proud of you.
"I'll be stuck here with Crabbe and Goyle, you know that right?" the voice said again, and Harry figured it must be Zabini.
Harry rolled his eyes at him "nice to see you too Ron" he smiled at his friend.
The letter had been taken out of its envelope and was folded in half. Harry opened the letter cautiously after he eyed the room, making sure no one was there but him.
It was almost 23:00, and Malfoy would not sleep. Harry had tried to subtly convince him to sleep early and when he failed to do so, tried to persuade him to go see his friends.
Chapter 6
Harry! Sorry I couldn't send you anything before, I'm trying to be as inconspicuous as possible!
Harry scoffed "alright, fine. What do we do now, then?"
He even noticed that Malfoy would change the meal here and there and wouldn't bring the same food. Malfoy was nice to him. Harry thought, remembering Hermione's words. He wondered whether Malfoy knew Dumbledore's intentions, thinking about the unspoken conversations Malfoy seemed to share with both Professors. He thought about Narcissa's letter to her son and how she had told him that his father would take care of everything.
"it's not all my fault, you know" he pursed his lips and looked away from the blonde.
He went into the shower, happily humming to himself, no longer having to sit in the sink, when he heard the door slam. He kept quiet and turned off the water.
Harry didn't really know why he wanted to ask about Malfoy. Perhaps because last year was just all over the place. Narcissa had helped him, and he couldn't watch Lucius go to Azkaban, no matter what he had done before. Malfoy had only talked to him once. Harry had found him after the trial, and had given him his wand back.
As Malfoy sighed and closed the door moving further inside the room, Harry noticed that he was still naked. He quietly dried himself and put his clothes on before levitating back to the bed where Malfoy was now seated.
Harry met his friends at the train station, just like his first year. Hermione wasn't there, but they figured she was already on the other side since they were a bit late. Ginny went first, then Ron, and Harry followed afterward. Molly had told him to take care of himself and both her children before he rushed between the two isles.
"So you have someone…or?" Nott asked, keeping a fair distance between him and the blonde this time, which Harry was glad of.
But when he went to sleep, a feeling of sadness crept on him. He felt like something was missing.
"I told you you'd be this tall" Hermione said as she inched closer "Harry…" she continued seriously, "I think Dumbledore asked you to stay with Malfoy for a reason"
"Do you love me?" Malfoy asked simply as if he's asking Harry about the weather, and Harry choked and started coughing, his eyes watering slightly.
"why? how?" Draco was searching Potter's face for a hidden joke. Potter just shrugged his shoulders and, smiling, continued munching on what's left in his plate.
"Well, when I got there, they were already in the middle of a game, Malfoy won, but didn't brag about it, which is weird because he's an obnoxious prat, but when he saw me, he nodded and left, I played a couple of games, and I didn't see him come down again" he finished "oh and Zabini said Malfoy was acting strange lately, and when I asked him why, he just changed the subject" Ron said, seemingly proud of himself for gathering so much information for his friend. Harry thanked him wholeheartedly, and pretended not to be thinking about every little detail.
Draco dear,
"Come, Potter" Malfoy said as he lowered his hand for Harry to step on. Harry did as bid, and Malfoy had to carry his robes and wand before following Snape out of the door.
"and I embarrass myself" he sighed "look 'mione, I know he doesn't love me…I…I think so at least…sometimes he acts as if he might, but you never know with him"
"Fine!" Malfoy said, opened the drawer and gave Harry the box of chocolate "will you shut up now?"
Harry sighed as he walked over and got in bed, making sure to stay at the edge, as far away from Malfoy as possible.
Malfoy smiled faintly at Harry before he turned towards the three across from him "I've thought the worst of him for the past six months" Zabini nodded sympathetically.
“I accidentally heard you talking to Granger” Malfoy explained as he sat back in the chair and put one leg on top of the other.
Harry moved his hands up, slowly placing them on Malfoy's chest "Malfoy…" he said in a whisper "I…we should stop" he finally said. The blonde looked at him through hazy eyes before he nodded.
"you noticed that, huh? Ok, it's a deal" Harry said, trying to recompose himself and sound unaffected by Malfoy's condition. What the hell was he going to say to him now? It needed to be convincing too.
"I brought you some food" he said as he laid the dinner tray in front of Harry.
Harry felt excited as he read the last part. He grinned, returned the letter to the envelope, and hid it inside the drawer.
"how long have you two…" his mother asked
"you said you liked me" Malfoy feigned a hurt tone as he moved a bit closer to Harry "you know if you like someone, you're probably attracted to them"
Harry was getting worked up, so he shook his head and willed himself to relax, finally managing to roll his eyes at the blonde "I would pay to trade places with him" he said unconsciously, thinking about Nott kissing Malfoy. Luckily, Malfoy thought Harry meant something completely different since he commented "alright Potter, I will put some clothes on" in finality, sounding annoyed.
They went to class after they were done eating, and Harry's stomach dropped when he saw Malfoy approaching. He started looking around as not to make eye contact with the Slytherin, but his eyes kept wandering back. Charms was going to be a disaster.
He felt somebody nudge him, and he looked over to see Ron staring at him with a questioning gaze on his face. Harry just smiled and nodded, and looked over at the board.
Harry felt jealousy rush through him. He pursed his lips and tried his best not to contort his face at the thought of Malfoy shagging Nott…or worse…Nott shagging Malfoy. He shook his head.
"Harry!" Ron almost shouted before Hermione shushed him "sorry 'mione. Harry, I'm glad you're here" Ron said as he moved closer to Harry. Ron laughed a little when he saw that Harry barely reached his thigh.
"no, partially mine for thinking you have a sense of humor"
Neville picked advanced Herbology, so he didn't have to wake up early like the rest of them. Their schedule this year wasn't very difficult, it was the exams that Harry was afraid of. Dean was perhaps the only Gryffindor in Ancient Runes, since most of them had picked Arithmancy, because it was the most bearable of the three.
Harry hesitated. He didn't want to mess this up, and he knew this was an important part of brewing the potion. But he also didn't want to seem like he didn't know how to do it. He nodded, and she smiled gently at him.
Harry looked away, biting at his fingernails.
He hadn't realized how much he'd missed his friends. Living with the Dursley's wasn't half bad now, but it still wasn't nearly the same.
"accidentally climbed on top of me?" the blonde raised an eyebrow "lucky you're so small or I would have assumed you had other intentions" he added slyly.
Harry and Davis had only just begun when she turned to him and asked "can you shake the peeled Shrivelfig, Potter?"
Malfoy looked at Harry for a moment before he smiled and said "someone looks bigger"
"I can't believe this!" Hermione said "Dumbledore lied to us! I knew something sounded fishy about the whole thing! You would never have left without talking to us about it first" Harry nodded.
The trio made their way to lunch, and were met with a friendly Parkinson at the door to the Great Hall.
"Mr. Potter" Snape looked up from the parchments he seemed to be grading "take a seat" he indicated to one of the desks, and Harry sat down where the ingredients were already assembled.
Draco was intrigued. Potter was in love? He held his breath and continued eavesdropping on the conversation.
"Potter…" Draco started "you are my boyfriend, it's only natural you'd sleep on my bed. If I ask for a couch to be put here, they'd just give you another room" he explained
Zabini looked straight at Malfoy and nodded "Yes"
Malfoy was kissing him passionately as he tightened his grip on Harry's waist. Harry suddenly became very aware of what they were doing and of the close proximity between them. He moved both hands to Malfoy's chest and was about to push the blonde away, but Malfoy might have realized that because he maneuvered Harry towards the bed till the backs of his knees hit the edge of the mattress. Harry let out a small gasp. He looked up at the blonde's face who had stopped kissing him, and he could see the heat glittering in his blue-grey eyes. He opened his mouth, trying to say something, but Malfoy didn't give him the chance. One hand grabbed Harry's leg and the other tightened on his lower back before he lifted him up. Harry's arms flailed helplessly for a second before he gripped Malfoy's shirt tightly. "Malfoy!" he squealed, but the blonde ignored that, pushing him on the bed, and climbing on top of him, pinning him down with his knee.
Lucius came in, his long cloak flapping around his ankles as he marched towards them.
"Last question" Malfoy announced and Harry nodded.
"maybe he also likes you?" Granger reasoned with him "if you tell him, you'll know. Either he likes you, then you won't be so miserable, or he doesn't, and –"
"I'm fine" Harry could feel a blush creeping up his face. He had no idea why he was blushing, but he hoped to god Malfoy didn't notice "thanks" he muttered under his breath looking pointedly downwards.
Harry crossed his arms "and you're not?"
Some time had passed and the Gryffindor hadn't returned. Draco checked the time and noticed that it'd been a bit more than half an hour and decided to go search for Potter who might have actually gotten lost in the Manor, and even worse, bumped into his father.
"Start brewing, and make sure to pay attention to the Shrivelfig this time" Snape said, and Harry noticed that there was a certain gentleness to his voice that wasn't quite there before "I'll come check on you later" and with that he left Harry to again try and brew a perfect potion.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy walked forward to the couch where he usually sat. "there's a lot to go through. Father might not ask any questions, but my mother definitely will" he muttered, eyeing Harry who was still nervously standing in his spot "well don't just stand there!" Malfoy said sharply and Harry went to sit next to him.
"we're here to scheme, Potter! Not to make ourselves comfortable!" Draco was getting irritated and he didn't understand why "if you're not in the same room, how can we plan and go about figuring what my father knows?" he hmphed as he slumped down on one of the green and golden chairs.
“Don’t be. I wish it was me instead of Dumbledore sometimes.” Draco hadn’t admitted that to anyone before and was unsure why he had said it now.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly. "Whatever, I'm his boyfriend. I'm allowed to be a sap when it comes to him."
Hermione rubbed his back. “It’s alright, Harry. You have every right to hate him.”
Harry and Hermione exchanged a glance, thinking for a moment of time turners and wings. Hermione shook it off first.
“That I what?”
she’d said. Like a given.
Harry looked sheepish at that. "Oh. Well in that case: no. I really, truly didn't and I don't know who did."
But he decided right then that he was through with that. Hermione
"Right now?"
Draco's eyes snapped towards him, and Severus felt a surge of protectiveness go through him.
Harry's eyes, of course, went to Draco first. He was tied up between Hermione and Cho Chang. The fourth person appeared to be a little girl, her skin and hair nearly as white as Draco's. She couldn't have been more than eight, and was obviously a Delacour. They each appeared to be in a very deep sleep, faces relaxed and heads lolling to the side. Streams of bubbles occasionally flowed from their mouths.
"I-I'm sorry Pr-professor Snape s-sir but I've nev-er had this h-happen before and-d I-" Hermione sobbed. Harry kept his eyes on the scene, not daring to acknowledge his missing partner.
“Oh,” Harry said, resuming their walk towards Thunderbird. “That’s… nice of you.”
A minute later arms came around him and he jumped at the unexpected contact. Since when did Blaise hug him? But when he opened his eyes, he understood. Pansy held onto him tightly, though where she came from Draco had no idea. He could see Blaise over her shoulder, back on his bed and pretending to be deaf like any good friend should.
She groaned at the sudden ache in her bones. When she opened her eyes, Draco gave her an apologetic look. "I'm sorry to tell you, you slept on the floor."
"Dare," the blond decided immediately.
Ron cut him a cold glare. "I shouldn't have to deal with seeing you two suck each other's faces off, no one should be subjected to that. It's disgusting."
"Alright mate?" Neville cut into his thoughts to ask. "Look about ready to blow a fuse."
Hermione raised her eyebrow, and didn’t attempt to hide pleasant surprise in knowing she had a potential companion in her campaign. However, it would be a topic for a later date as she responded to his last statement.
“I think,” she’d began, “the source of the pain—the headaches and nausea you feel, is an almost direct result of your intense dislike for mind magicks when compared to your counterpart.”
exactly. It was more that sharing each other’s lives had just become a natural sort of thing during the past few months, even amidst all the fear and worrisome goings on. So if, say, someone came into Draco’s dorm room and was met with the two of them cuddled together in the same bed, it was doubtful there was anyone left who would even so much as blink.
"Oi!" Hermione protested. "It's truth or dare. You can't send me away on errand."
colloportus
"Such as?"
As it happened, Draco did not ask again. Nothing Granger had said was plausible. Especially after Draco overheard Padma Patil complaining about being roped into taking the weasel, since her sister was going with Potter. Draco's stomach twisted with jealousy, and his wits temporarily abandoned him. Which was how, Christmas Day, he showed up to the Ball with Millicent Bullstrode on his arm. She didn't stay there for long, however, as Draco could hardly stand the girl. She seemed happy enough to go off on her own, and Draco was far more concerned with the punch—thankfully some upper-year had managed to spike it with Firewhiskey—than keeping track of her.
His rising panic and dread were forcefully put aside, though, when the muscles in all four Auror’s shoulders tensed and Not Fleur murmured, “Someone’s here. Hide.”
Draco nodded.
Parvati beamed even brighter, somehow. “Thanks, Harry. So, how come you haven’t been round the past few days? Lavender wouldn’t say… a lot, really.”
Harry shrugged. "I guess. No one's told me that for sure."
It hadn’t yet gone two weeks since their fight, but Harry was already tired of pretending he wasn’t constantly itching to talk some sense into Malfoy. It had been much easier to simply hate the prat and be done with it when they’d been at Hogwarts, in different Houses and sharing a handful of hours a week together at best—or worst, at the time. But here, he was all Harry had of home.
"Hush. We were talking about your dad."
I promise this isn’t really a song-fic. I just can’t seem to help myself sometimes!
He was glad he’d had the feeling to put on better clothes before leaving his flat, or even the money might not have done it.
Harry knew this, of course. He had to be aware of the group’s history before he’d signed on as publicist. Chris, Alfie, and Bradley were a few nobodies from Lincolnshire, who’d moved to London and been playing in pubs for roughly three years before Neville—fresh out of Hogwarts and looking to make himself known—responded to a poster they’d put up a few months prior about seeking a lead singer.
however you wanted?!" the man demanded.
It was extremely lucky, Harry thought to himself, that he’d spent significant time in muggle London. All the entrances to the wizarding world were the same, so once he’d pinpointed exactly where his flat was, it had been simple to find the nearest one to it. And from there, the information about Neville had held up.
"Right um, are the stories about your mum true? No offence," he added hastily. Hermione wouldn’t have found this line of questioning odd, it was natural to be curious about Veela heritage, and Blaise’s mum was quite infamous, but the look on Neville’s face was making her second guess it. She shook her head in an attempt to clear it.
“Where else was I supposed to go?”
Even when it was laid out for him, point blank, by the only person that could possibly be called a professional in this, he’d swept it under the rug. Had refused, with the sheer power of the subconscious, to even question
?” Draco asked after a moment, sounding incredulous.
“He’d love to hear you say that,” Neville said, rolling his eyes good-naturedly.
It hadn’t been real. None of it had been
Draco nodded. Yes, his father most certainly had ties to the
Later, Draco would tell him what he’d overheard and, thanks to growing up a Malfoy, what it meant. Harry, Hermione and Ron would all agree that the Dark Mark was something they’d have to discuss with Sirius tomorrow. And, with only a sight grimace, Draco would concede.
“Hermione,” he said. “That’s the last thing that matters and you know it. I mean, gods, they thought Harry and I were crazy; we were
I've been chasing skirts ever since."
The Slytherin chuckled softly, his smile widening a bit as if to say
That… was fair, Harry thought, wincing even through his surprise. Small things clicked into place, like how Lavender had a standing dinner date with her that one time. And how there tended to be strands of long black hair on the sofa the times Harry had visited. And the two toothbrushes he always saw in the bathroom near Lav’s bedroom.
think about my past… everything. The bad stuff, I mean.”
“Me?” Harry asked. “I haven’t been that much of a burden, have I?”
She'd thought Professor Snape even more mad than was usual when he paired the two boys up, or that perhaps he wanted to make Harry as miserable as possible while in his class—even if that meant a sacrifice on the part of his star pupil. And, usually, the two boys acted just as to be expected. Furious whispering and scathing insults could normally be heard, and thus ignored, by everyone all throughout class. It was not uncommon for this to escalate into a full out row, ending with a borderline gleeful Snape swiftly taking points from Gryffindor House. But today, more than halfway through the period, Harry nor Malfoy had traded even a single word.
Harry was not innocent of affecting pain. He was not immune to making mistakes.
Just being up in the sky was breathtaking, and Harry basked in the glory of it as he watched the Slytherin score again and again. It was warm and mildly humid out, the fast air whipping against his face a cool relief, negating the sweat gathering on his forehead. By the time they landed, Harry was exhausted in the best of ways.
“—and dad told me she’s been trying to pass a new law that allows certain healers to discriminate against no-majborns. Like if they’re pureblood and they don’t want to heal someone, they won’t have to,” Celine said, dejectedly pushing around bits of pancake with her fork.
“How exactly is my life in danger?” Harry blurted from where he stood next to Draco. They’d been waiting for his parents to show for nearly ten minutes, Draco didn’t blame Harry for wanting answers. He wanted the same, only he’d had it drilled into him to never interrupt when the adults—meaning his parents and any other
"Take a bath and–er–take the egg with you, and–er–just mull things over in the hot water. It'll help you think... trust me."
Grey eyes met emerald ones and the words flowed from Draco's lips. "I really do, you know. Love you, I mean. I know people would say I don’t know what I’m talking about and all that rubbish, but you've always been... I'll never feel about anyone the same way I feel about you. I've known it all along practically, that I love you. All the reasons why not be damned."
"Always so overdramatic," Blaise commented, and then his voice shifted to a mocking pitch.
an inner voice helpfully pointed out. Harry sighed and tried to push the blond out of his mind. Everyone was focused on defeating Voldemort, it was only right Harry be as well.
Draco shrugged, remaining silent.
Neville looked at them like they’d somehow lost their minds. “Of course not."
Malfoy was so upbeat at breakfast, Harry jokingly checked him for fever.
Neville looked at Harry with a raised brow. “What, is she in on your change of heart?”
That evening, Draco still sat in the library across from Hermione, searching through a useless book about eggs, when Pyxis—his family owl—approached. That was odd, since his mother's letters usually came at dinner. When he opened this particular letter, however, he understood that this couldn't have waited until dinner.
Ron only shuddered, and then left. Leaving the Hall, however, proved to be a mistake of epic proportions. Harry and Malfoy hadn't made it very far at all. Worse, they didn't appear to notice him. It looked as if Malfoy was trying to leave the world's most noticeable hickey on Harry’s neck. Harry, who’s head was tossed backwards, was staring at the ceiling as though he could see the stars beyond it. Ron could only watch in horrified fascination until finally, finally he remembered how to move, and left to sit and possibly obliviate himself in the common room.
So. That was a bit brutal, I know...
“You could be hunting the person responsible,” Malfoy suggested.
"I wish you lot had been able to appreciate his face when Harry's cauldron went up, it was priceless!" He exclaimed, laughing some more.
The chuckling Slytherin waved him off. "Draco was perfectly fine, had plenty of time what with the way Snape tore Nev’s head off for five minutes. No one even came close to noticing he was gone."
That was when time seemed to slow down. He’d called for help, and with it came the attention of everyone. Including the Death Eaters.
“You are suggesting that Aurors replace the Champions,” Snape clarified.
It was still odd, she thought, that Draco Malfoy was truly treating her as a friend.
"Get out of my way, Severus. My son clearly needs to be taught a lesson."
“Look,” she went on patiently, “what say we go back to yours and talk things out. I could go for some tea about now.”
Wide blue eyes snapped up to meet his in surprise. And, for a moment, Harry simply forgot himself.
“Malfoy.”
"What," he stressed, "is the meaning of this?"
The recent marketing campaign direction really wasn’t helping matters, in Harry’s opinion.
"Er, if you fancy truth or dare."
Thankfully, she had done so less and less as time had gone on, seeming more content simply to talk with him about what details he found important. None of which had to do with his current everyday-life, anyway.
Harry's eyes widened. "Your father was here?"
Harry was hardly even moving anymore, he couldn't break Malfoy's stare.
While they had been talking, Neville had introduced the headliner—a band of boys led by a female singer with coloured hair, who were welcomed with a healthy level of enthusiasm—and then exited just as planned.
Merlin, he was tired.
"Sorry," he said. But Harry was already resealing the distance between them. He'd wanted to stay there just now, and his body had moved almost of its own accord.
But that didn’t seem to be too much of a problem, since Ayesha had become somewhat awkward since they’d told Amjad goodbye. Harry figured he would wait for her to say whatever she was thinking, and started getting the stuff out to resume making himself a now-late breakfast. It had been easy to ignore, but he’d been hungry the entire match.
“Hey,” he said.
Blaise found the entire situation unbelievably hilarious, which he made very clear that evening in the Slytherin common room before dinner. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Neville and Pansy had all had taken up various positions in front of the fireplace, listening to Blaise laugh and retell the story from his point of view.
"Maybe start by showing him you actually like him, not taking the piss," Pansy suggested.
"Why are you doing this?" Malfoy asked quietly, breaking the silence between them.
Draco’s smile dropped entirely now, a scowl forming. Weasley hadn’t been a prat in a while, there was no reason to be now. “Yes, how lovely of you to rub it in.”
"Thanks," Harry barely managed to say.
Lily’s eyes—so like his own—misted, and before he knew it, she had all but yanked him down into her embrace, like he was still a little boy in need of mothering.
"I love him, Ron."
But the resulting pain from legilimency lingered without anyone’s notice.
, just like everyone else always is."
“I’m tired of being upset with you,” Harry admitted.
Harry’s heart squeezed painfully. He fought to keep it from showing on his face, but must not have quite. This seemed to result in the wrong impression.
“Hermione dear—” Molly started gently, sending a look like ice in Ginny’s direction.
“At least you understand you’re the invader, that’s promising.”
Draco closed his eyes for a moment before looking back up at Snape. "How long has he been here?"
a pillowbiter," he said through clenched teeth.
"No," Blaise said, mildly annoyed that he wouldn’t be allowed to complete his game. "We don't think that. But that doesn't mean you can start assigning blame whenever Potter hurts your feelings."
Harry sighed and walked over to Draco’s bed, sitting down on the edge. “Well too bad, I’m not gonna do that.”
"Probably not. Well, maybe Vince. Go on and find out, I'm going to get back to what I was reading before you decided to grace me with a heart attack."
’ such as it is.”
“You don’t understand.”
"Yes?"
unfair.”
Now said blond was staring at him, hands still over his ears and grey eyes wide. Slowly, he dropped his arms.
Harry nodded, catching sight of the girl easily, her hair a curtain of red against the lavender.
he thought at her, incredulous.
That was when it finally occurred to Draco that it might be really nice to get home and have a shower, change his clothes, and, Merlin, eat actual food again.
It turned out that Draco was, in fact, asleep. Vincent was also, but Greg appeared to be doing last minute homework and Blaise was idly painting the ceiling with the help of his wand.
Cosima scoffed bitterly at that. “They didn’t want to deal with us anymore, and it’s not like we could convince them of anything different because we’d been obliviated. We had no proof someone else was responsible.”
But Harry could now see what the dark, inked lines concealed. The scarring would have almost blended in perfectly, had it not been ever so slightly raised.
At that, the blond's eye twitched dangerously. "I didn't ask for this," Draco complained.
"It's not right," she said.
“Time to get up.”
Harry smiled gratefully. Parvati seemed like she was a good friend. Harry felt a pang of regret about his sort of writing her off.
Harry grinned widely at him, but the blond just swallowed funny and looked away.
Ron had yet to say anything about his girlfriend’s enthusiastic antics.
thought Draco. Instead, he only nodded.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but there was no need. There was a scream of "Gabrielle!" from the shore, where Fleur could be seen wrapped in a blanket and looking relieved even from their distance. Draco shook his head in mock disbelief, obviously understanding the situation.
“Fantastic. Who’s got some?” He glanced at the girls.
Shock flashed across her face, there and gone in a blink. Then she offered him a small smile and nodded, almost hesitant. “Yeah, we could. If he’s on break from Hogwarts, I’m sure Sirius would like to see you too.”
How easily he had just gotten caught up in it, he marveled—the seemingly bottomless well of love for Draco that truly could only have come from over a decade of wanting. The sheer magnitude was too powerful; it swept him away without producing even a single dissenting thought from him.
she said, but nothing happened. The wand produced no light.
Parvati smiled wide. “I’m finally moving in!” she said excitedly. “My lease is up on Thursday. Never thought I’d see the day, if I’m honest. I shouldn’t have renewed it even last time, but Lavender was still… well, nevermind all that now.”
Everyone appeared satisfied with this, but Draco's face fell when Pansy chose him again.
But he blinked it determinedly away, and took a step forward.
Harry took in a deep breath and released it. His resolve seemed to disintegrate all at once, and he clapped Ron on the shoulder and smiled.
“You’ve got friends in Gryffindor, don’t you?” Theo asked after a moment of thought.
“Weasley,” Draco hissed at the sleeping prat, who did not so much as twitch. “Weasley,” he tried again, “Weasley get up.” Draco nudged him with his foot a few times before giving up entirely and kicking him swiftly in the gut.
“Because I love her, but she’s... a lot sometimes,” the redhead finished lamely.
Snape handed Draco the rolled up paper in his hand. Draco's eyes flicked back to Harry just in time to see Granger hand him the same paper and his face darken. Draco took the paper, knowing what it would say but needing to read it anyway.
“You’re mental,”
"Just help me with her," Harry said. "I don't think she can swim."
It’s All Coming Back to Me Now by Celine Dion
“Might have something to do with how I slept in a cupboard for the better part of ten years,” he snapped all at once. An instant later he was already regretting the words.
Harry gave a surprised yelp, but Ayesha didn’t even blink. “I hope you weren’t planning to give the student body a show,” she said mildly, eyeing her watch. “Doubt Amjad would appreciate that too much.”
"I regret that," Draco said quickly. "I regret a lot of things. I'm all but sure you don't believe it though. Still, being awful to you and your lot just made it easier."
Lavender laughed like this was an adorable joke instead of a barb. “Good looking and funny,” she said.
"I shouldn't of expected anything less," he replied.
"Bloody hell," he said. "I'd ask where you were, but even I'm not that daft."
... Harry isn’t always in top form but we love him anyway right? He’s got a lot of his plate.
Harry had to be better than that.
Harry’s heart lifted.
"Something wrong, Granger?" Zabini asked suddenly. "You've been quiet. Assignments
The blond looked up, surprised again. “What?”
“Wasn’t your fault,” Neville mumbled into her shoulder. “I never told you.”
And Harry latched onto that thought for all it was worth.
“You and Blaise.”
While Harry, Hermione and Ron concerned themselves over Sirius’s safety, Draco appeared to be concerned over each of their own safety, despite reassurances that Sirius wasn’t in any way dangerous. Harry supposed that Draco would simply have to see for himself before he would relax.
"You sounded like Hermione just then," Harry told him.
And perhaps it was that some small part of Harry, the part that had so secretly wanted that type of all consuming, awe-inspiring love story, had not put up enough of a fight.
“You said we’re gods compared to them,” Harry said. “Why? Why are we so much more deserving of life than them?”
“Be distracted later,” Joshua replied. “You might get away with slacking on the first day, but Hanson doesn’t make this subject easy.”
Ron whirled on her. "Did you
“And it’s been nearly two since the last time you split,” Neville put in. “Maybe it’s different this time.”
"You already know that, Panse," Draco bit out.
“Well isn’t this a revelation,” interrupted Pansy’s voice. She perched herself on the arm of the sofa next to Ron, a glass in her hand. “I’d been wondering when you’d get yourselves a screaming infant.”
Harry blinked, then, once the question had registered, yanked his arm away, anger and embarrassment returned full force.
“Nerds,” said Maria playfully.
Harry had promised, and no sooner than they both arrived at breakfast—late—was it to be put to the test.
Draco scowled. "How could I forget?"
The more people gathered in the crowd, the less Harry expected to catch sight of that particular shade of blond hair.
The other boy’s jaw clenched. “I already apologised to him for all of that.”
right?” she went on venomously, relentless. “And there’s no reason at all you’ve not sought her out despite knowing how for ages. Why you’ve avoided all your supposedly wonderful friends. It’ll all work out splendidly—no Janus Thickey Ward in your future, certainly! You know what Harry? You’re right, I don’t give a damn. Get the hell out!”
"But. But you didn't even tell me your name. We didn't even... We were eleven. How..."
“But I need to,” Harry confirmed tiredly. “Sheila says it’ll get easier the more I do it.”
That rendered Harry silent. Lavender Brown was Harry’s best friend? How had that come to be?
"My father's here already?"
Oh my god look guys an update! I know some of you were beginning to doubt you’d live to see it, but I am back again. I actually stayed up pretty late last night in kind of a concentrated burst of writing and then fixing this, because I was just so excited to have something to post again. I even got a bit of a start on the next chapter, so ideally—hopefully but don’t quote me—there shouldn’t be as long of a break between updates next time.
Harry and Malfoy exchanged a sour look with each other. “We were only talking about the… missing student, Sir,” replied Malfoy before Harry could come up with a way to phrase
“It doesn’t matter,” said Timothy. “We’ve got to go immediately. Tell the others.”
It’s simple fact.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I-”
to the Headmaster to be dealt with. I doubt I can do so objectively. I will be giving you a zero on this practical, however, in case there was any doubt about it. Now get out of my sight.”
"Rejected by
they were?"
“That’s Matthew,” said Maria as she slid in to his right, confirming Harry’s suspicions. “They’re always going at it because once upon a time Matt wanted to fuck and Josh didn’t.”
"You might be exaggerating just a bit, Panse," Draco said dryly.
And Voldemort hated him for it.”
It wasn’t until he’d almost gotten near enough to knock on the door that it suddenly flew open, and a small, giggling blur shot through. Or tried to. Rather, the form all but bounced backward off of Harry’s legs, very clearly not having expected the way to be blocked.
He was mulling over everything that had happened since the beginning of term, and where he ended up.
“Where is Draco?” asked Lucius, a hint of annoyance in his voice.
"Well, Parkinson wanted to talk with Hermione, and now Zabini was staring at me, and he smiled" Harry said suspiciously, and looked at the Slytherin table again.
Malfoy, on the other hand, ran his hand through his hair and sighed "you think my parents would believe that this…" pointing at Harry "is my boyfriend?" Zabini gave a snicker.
"Er…" Harry rubbed the back of his head "you didn't tell me that" he answered honestly.
Potter can be so dramatic, thought Draco as he, too, walked back inside.
"Yeah, mate, I had to nudge you three times before you noticed!" Ron agreed with Hermione energetically. And Harry just wanted this day to be over. How on earth was he supposed to explain to his friends that he was having daydreams about a bloke? And Malfoy no less?
Harry didn't understand anything of what had just happened. Malfoy was going to take him, and they were going to keep Harry with him of all people. And why weren't they allowed to tell anyone else? It's just a laughing matter, isn't it? Voldemort was gone, most of the Death Eaters were in Azkaban, and there was no threat anymore, was there?
When they got out of class, Malfoy and Zabini approached them.
"you taste good" Malfoy said huskily as his gaze shifted from Harry's eyes to settle on his mouth.
The death eaters you told us about are on the loose, and Dumbledore warned all the students. They even canceled Hogsmeade next week!
"Not really" Harry hadn't thought about it "I have none of my stuff" He hadn't considered any of this at all. Malfoy sighed and went over to his dresser again. He pulled something Harry couldn't quite see, whispered some spell, before turning and handing Harry what seemed to be a shrunken green pajama.
"What can you do now mate?" Ron asked, looking at Harry with a worried expression.
Lunch passed eventlessly. And the trio made their way to their next class. Neville and Seamus joined them, and they went in together. Harry stared at Malfoy some more, but wasn't noticed by anyone.
Harry started brewing the potion, determined not to ruin it this time. He didn't know why Snape wasn't giving him a detention, and was actually giving him another chance, but he wanted to prove to him that he can improve, and that he wasn't going to disappoint him this time.
"What do you mean?" his ginger friend asked, looking as intrigued as ever.
"Are you alright?" the Slytherin sounded worried, but as he noticed his own voice betraying him, his face turned passive again.
“huh?”
"why?" Harry asked a little disappointed. He was almost sure it was Nott from the beginning, but he had hoped Malfoy would tell him more than that. Clearly, he was mistaken.
"so, am I comfortable, Potter?" Malfoy smiled at Harry. Malfoy looked like he just woke up as well. Harry had never seen the blonde's hair disheveled before, and it made Malfoy appear less cold.
As Malfoy closed the door, Harry had an epiphany of whom this mysterious person could be. Theodore Nott, he reasoned. He didn't know why he got so angry after that thought.
Harry was finding it almost impossible to look away from Malfoy. His eyes traveled from the blonde's exposed chest to his long neck, finally locking on Malfoy's heated gaze.
He yawned as he sat up "what were you doing?" he asked, trying to sound as casual as possible.
Harry tensed but Malfoy answered calmly “no, we have other plans” and then noticing his mother’s disappointed expression “some other time, maybe” he added with a smile.
Harry looked over at Malfoy “Er…yes” and helped himself to some pudding.
Harry heard Malfoy snicker and he scrunched up his face "you're unbelievable" Malfoy laughed harder as he looked at Harry's petulant expression.
"mhm..." Draco agreed.
“you’ll keep an eye out, and, when necessary, entertain my parents” Malfoy chuckled at the expression Harry made.
Crabbe started looking for the wand with Goyle, which was found at last tucked in Goyle's robes.
"Potter, it's almost midnight, I'm tired and I want to sleep" Malfoy retorted, moving away from him.
He hadn’t realized his body was so close to the blonde till he saw the latter’s eyes open sleepily, then stare at him. Harry froze in place.
Sunday, September 8th
"What do you think about our house, Mr. Potter?" Lucius asked, drumming his fingers on the table.
"I…like you…" Harry murmured "more than…" he unconsciously fiddled with the edge of his shirt "like Hermione and Ron" he uttered eventually.
“What will we do about your father?” Harry’s voice faltered as he tried to stir the conversation to a safer topic. He sat back in the chair and rested his chin on his hand.
Draco's eyes widened minutely at the unexpected response.
I have class, see you later.
Draco looked at Potter in front of him and, for the first time perhaps, didn't know what to say. He'd thought someone like Potter had every luxury growing up, being famous and all.
"Yeah, I heard" Harry started "why did you agree to all this?" Harry questioned. Malfoy didn't have to do this. He was leaving all of his friends to live with his rival. Yes, they had started going along after everything that had happened, but they weren't friends, and Malfoy didn't even argue with Dumbledore. Harry knew there was something going on that they weren't telling him, and he'll surely find out soon enough.
Warnings: slightly sexual.
"How much of the potion had gotten onto his skin?" Snape asked Malfoy, as if Harry wasn't even there, or as if he were a small child who wouldn't know what to answer.
Chapter 10
Harry just nodded and asked him to open it, which Malfoy did while sighing exasperatedly. Harry ate one and asked Malfoy if he wanted some too. Malfoy looked at him as if he were some creature he had never seen before. Malfoy ate a piece of chocolate, after which Harry asked him whom T was, again.
"Potter" Harry heard Malfoy say and peeped from under the sheets.
Draco choked on a piece of bread. He coughed and wheezed till his eyes were watery "here" Potter handed him his glass of juice and Draco sipped on it. He looked at the figure in front of him with wide eyes "you slept in a cupboard under the stairs?" he repeated, unable to believe what he'd heard. Potter nodded.
"We can play miniature chess if you'd like" Malfoy suddenly said as he got up and headed to a box on the floor next to his dresser. He looked back at Harry, and when he nodded, Malfoy bent down and got the game.
"what makes you think that Hermione?"
But Harry did.
"good morning" Harry muttered, trying to divert Malfoy from the previous line of the conversation.
Harry stood up as Malfoy smiled at him "almost there, Potter" he said amusedly
"right here" Draco pointed at his bed "next to me" Potter was clearly not expecting that as he opened and closed his mouth in embarrassment.
"I'm sorry, Hermione…" he smiled at her, and she couldn't not smile back, which always made him feel better. He and Ron sat down, and talked animatedly all the way to Hogwarts.
Harry hurried to his room and wrote two letters – one to Ron, the other to Hermione – asking them if they'd be going back to Hogwarts for their eighth year. He'd love to go back! He wanted one more year with his friends, and with his professors – even Snape! It would be like his first year, when he didn't have to worry so much about Voldemort and the Death Eaters. He still couldn't believe he had gotten rid of him. He'd sometimes sleep thinking this was all a dream, and he'd wake up hearing Dumbledore telling him to be ready for the Dark Lord to strike, or listening to Snape pestering him about his lack of concentration in his Occlumency lessons.
He made his way to the couch and climbed it to sit down.
Malfoy glanced at Harry before he walked to the door and opened it "Granger" he saluted as Hermione came inside their room. Behind her, Ron and Zabini entered, to both Harry and Malfoy's surprise.
Chapter 15
Harry shrugged his shoulders "I don't know…wait till I'm the right size I suppose"
When Malfoy didn't receive an answer for a few moments, he arched his eyebrow and withdrew his hand.
Harry couldn't be more thankful since he was stifled under the sheets, which were too heavy and felt like they were choking him on purpose.
"What? The room?" Malfoy asked "I suppose, it's bigger than the shared room…the bed is also nicer, and it has a shower for one, which I'm going to enjoy immensely" Malfoy pointed out as he continued his sauntering. His head looked huge, and Harry could see his facial expression only vaguely. He could see the blonde's neck – which was very long, and his chin – quite pointed, and the blonde locks – which looked very soft. He couldn't see the eyes – which he was thankful for. Malfoy's eyes were always so cold, looking down on him. Harry didn't like Malfoy's eyes very much.
"did you…you know?" his mother winked.
Harry looked around desperately as if trying to search for a place to escape to. Malfoy was too close for comfort. "or maybe…" he drawled "you just notice things about me?" Malfoy added smugly.
Draco wanted to go in and stop this nonsense when he heard Potter say "the closer I get to him, the more I realize he's unaware of people's feelings" he sighed quietly.
Malfoy looked at him quizzically "what?" he wondered as Harry continued to stare at the blonde.
"don't get me wrong, the house was big enough" he explained "I lived in the cupboard under the stairs"
"Merlin..." he sighed in exasperation and moved away, laying on his back with his hands behind his head. He yawned and closed his eyes and soon drifted into an uneasy sleep.
"Then how, Potter? Just spill it out! I don't have all day to wait on you" Malfoy sounded irritated.
"Last week, Theodore and I were having breakfast in the Great Hall…" Harry remembered that incident "he told me that he'd been trying to ask Blaise out since the summer, and Blaise wouldn't budge…so I gave him some pointers" Malfoy said "he sent me the chocolate box to thank me because Blaise finally agreed to go out with him" the blonde finished and waited for Harry's reaction. Harry sighed in relief as he mumbled, albeit not quietly enough, "so he likes Zabini instead" but Malfoy had apparently heard him because he chuckled "jealous, Potter? Thought he liked me?" and upon seeing Harry's startled face, Malfoy laughed harder.
Malfoy had shrunk the game for Harry's sake, and kept knocking the pieces until he finally gave up and flung them over. Harry had first laughed, but when Malfoy looked angrily at him, he sat quietly.
Dear Draco,
He couldn't hear anything, but Malfoy shouldn't be here now – he had potions for another hour or so.
Malfoy suddenly moved away, his smirk still visible "I think I'll do the rest when you return to your normal size" he said as he winked at Harry "good night Potter" he ended their conversation by turning his back to Harry and covering himself with the blanket.
Their next class passed quickly, and Harry tried to pay as much attention as he could. McGonagall was going on and on about something that sounded very important, but even though they didn't share this class with the Slytherins, Harry was still imagining Malfoy.
Malfoy grabbed Harry and together, they made their way to the couch Malfoy was previously sitting on.
"not yet, you're not" said Draco as he got up and strutted over to where Potter was sitting, as still as a statue "I think you won't be able to talk much once you are really full" Draco spoke slowly, standing inches away from the Gryffindor's face.
"what can I do?"
As soon as they got to Hogwarts, Harry breathed in, closing his eyes. This was his home, he grew up here, and it was the safest place for him. He knew he was very lucky to have been a wizard. He hadn't stopped thinking about what it'd have been like if he weren't, and he'd shuddered every time.
As they were eating, a hand grabbed Ron's shoulder gently. Ron and Harry looked up to see none other than Zabini.
"that's not true!" Harry retorted, sounding incredulous, deciding he had had enough of Malfoy's tormenting conversation. But the blonde was persistent.
Deputy Headmistress
It was clear his father didn't want to be detained longer, so Draco nodded and left to his room.
Today's schedule was definitely not easy. Harry didn't like Arithmancy very much, and picked it only because he thought it would be easier than the rest. There were students from all four houses, and Harry prayed to the Gods that Malfoy had picked some other course to attend, which is exactly what happened. Harry looked around for the first five minutes of class just to make sure Malfoy wasn't around. Once he was satisfied, he tried to focus and listen to everything their Professor said.
“And my bed is okay?!”
As soon as he reached Draco, he hugged him without thinking, warmth filling Harry when he felt the other’s arms returning the hug.
“I feel like this is going to be the start of an idiotic friendship.” Harry declared, excitement filling him at the very idea. He had been certain Maflo- Draco would have shot him down and ignored him.
“Yes, Mother.”
“Lidl.”
“Really, Potter? Whenever? Perhaps the 13 of May 2045?!” Malfoy waved his handoff into the distance.
When Draco finally spoke his tone was light, “A penny for your thoughts Potter?”
“I mean you had nothing, it all got destroyed in the war."
“You shop at Waitrose, don’t you?”
“Why are you here?” Ron questioned with a weary look in his eye once he retched the pair. Placing the two drinks on the other side of the table from Pansy.
Swallowing down his reply, Harry continued to climb into his bed, turning his back to Draco. He took a deep breath, ‘just pretend this was normal Wednesday behaviour' he thought. He could sleep with Draco in the same bed. Surprisingly, sleep came easily that night.
H: Such sarcasm in such a little text.
A first-year Hogwarts letter.
“The mighty ‘saviour’ Harry Potter defenceless?” Draco snarked. Yes back to my usual self. “Ouch, what was that for?” Draco jumped, as he grabbed his arm.
“I know the feeling.”
"Potter, are you aware it's called a spring clean and not an autumn clean?" Draco added to his already long string of useless comments.
A very chatty chapter today, Also the shortest chapter of the entire fic.
Scrambling back up, Pansy straightened her shirt, “Potter.” She was so shocked she had used his real name.
The next morning came far too quickly for Draco’s liking. He was getting too old for all these parties one day after another. It had nothing to do with the fact he’d been up most of the night texting a certain someone.
Draco spotted him looking around and sighed “Don’t even ask.” He said. Lowering coffee to the table before running a hand through his hair, slinking backwards in the chair.
“But you don’t like each other?” Albus asked, a small frown on his face.
“What?” Pansy pipped up, baffled by the entire situation. She felt like they had knocked her off her post and she did not like that feeling whatsoever.
“Would you stop being such a prat and actually help? Also, It's not autumn.”
“Edward apologise, you’ve just hurt Draco.” Harry attempted to scold the child again.
“Not Bad,” Malfoy glanced over the letters, a mock look of disinterest while his eyes contradicted him. Harry realised how much Malfoy’s eyes would give away. “I’ll write the names and addresses, you fold and stamp.” He commented, picking up the first invite. Oblivious to Harry’s inspecting gaze.
“I still hate you, though.”
H: No, come back!
“They don’t need to be in the living room,” Harry argued, vase still in hand.
“Naturally.” Malfoy nodded, starting on the first letter. Only to be interrupted moments later.
“Okay, you need to get some shoes on, come on,” Draco interrupted, picking Scorpius up and shifting him from the chair to the floor.
It didn’t take long for the other two to get bored and join them, again settling themselves up to help make a complete mess of the table. James ignored them as he hyper-focused on his task.
Harry’s brain stuttered to a halt. That made sense. That was logical. Yet there was something about Malfoy having his number and doing nothing with it, which confused him. Confliction filled him, He knew Malfoy wasn’t the same kid as he was at school, however; he kept waiting for him to act like it.
“Or better yet, don’t volunteer next year.” Draco chuckled.
Written for the Feb 2020 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge;
Draco tried to not smile at the idiot, “Spit it out, Potter.”
“Oh. Hey. Nagini?! Are you really acting like finding the Dark Lord's, once-dead-now-alive-snake in our room is no big deal?!" he practically shouted.
Harry: What happened? What’s wrong?
“Just because something is true doesn’t mean you have to say it out loud, Potter,” Malfoy said with a shrug as if it were the most obvious thing. Before holding out his hand, waiting.
“Pansy, I need the confirmation file on the…” His words cut off as he looked up. “Potter?”
Once again thank you to my beta,
You didn’t ruin anything, my uncle, however…
His eyes did a once over before speaking, “Let me guess Pansy told you?” Draco pressed his lips together and did not pout, regardless of what Harry would call the expression.
Draco pulled the ski-cap everyone had been given further down around his face, At least no one had to know he was here. Against his will, he might add. It was all Pansy’s fault. There she stood leading the charge of Slytherin as the self-appointed leader. Also, the entire reason he was bloody here. She had forced him to come. He should really stand up for himself. Go right over there and… Do nothing.
“I convinced him to accept the invite. Well, technically he wasn’t invited, but there was an invite, so I convinced him to come, anyway.”
Ron seemed to miss her confusion and nodded along, “I know right! it’s a total cop-out! I’ve been able to drive that car since I was 12, I should get it. They both have their own motorbikes, anyway.” He waved his arms in complete disgust.
H: Because otherwise you’d miss out on the luxury of texting me.
“Draco. He likes me,” Harry giggled, hugging a pillow. “I hope I get to fuck him. That would be my ultimate school dream.”
Catching Pansy off-guard, “How did? Oh, course, I’m surrounded by such idiots I sometimes forget other people are smart.” Pansy laughed.
“Wait, What? I thought you were explaining why that’s a bad idea?”
“Bullshit. Even you’re not that much of a dick.”
Earning a laugh from Draco, as he stepped out of Harry’s embrace. Looking more relaxed.
“I’m amazing.” Harry shrugged it off with a chuckle.
Big thank you to PenguinAnimagus & unicorn-in-the-library for helping to name Luna's Omnonoster
Harry hugged him, keeping his arms over his shoulders. “It’s okay, we can have a breather and think of words, address situations you know responsible adult jazz like that.”
"Hiss - Go jumpsss himsssss."
“Are we not decorating today?”
“Yer… Friend,” Harry slowly muttered, confliction replacing his joy, as he kicked the ground.
“I thought I’d surprise Draco,” Harry smiled holding up the two cups of coffee, “is he in a meeting?”
The entire place looked different from his last visit. The deck was covered in paperwork with various boxes and decorations dotted around the place.
“So everyone would host a ball?”
Harry itched his head and shuffled in his seat again, before blurting out, “How-much-do-I-owe-you?”
Harry wasn’t prepared for a text from Pansy. He nearly had a heart attack when her name flashed across his phone. He wasn’t sure why her number was saved in his phone, but he ignored it. That seemed like a question with a scary answer he’d be better off not knowing. At least receiving a text meant he didn’t have to phone and speak to her in person, which was ideal. The thought of having to speak to Pansy had become his biggest fear in relation to planning Christmas with Malfoy. Compared to her, Malfoy seemed like a Scottish fold kitten.
“Don’t call me the mighty saviour.”
Draco glanced at Harry, then away again. Debating just getting up and leaving, he could make it to the floo faster than Harry; he was sure of that.
Kreacher had already set up several bowls of healthy snacks by the time they arrived.
Word count: 120
Harry sat forwards studying him. While Draco tried to ignore him. The realisation slowly covered Harry’s face, filling Draco with terror. “You never planned on taking my money, did you?”
Harry thought he heard Draco huff, but he wasn’t sure. After a while, Draco lent back so their faces were on the same level. Harry only realised Draco was stood in between his legs when the other placed his hands on either side of Harry’s thighs. His face with the unreadable expression once more. Harry wanted to wipe the look straight off his face. Dropping his eyes to Draco’s lips as he caught Draco doing the same.
“I knew it. Just knew it.” Harry shook his head, leaning into the chair.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No Potter,” Malfoy sighed, “There’s no point. Unless you’re willing to risk the Tree off-balancing the entire Feng Shui of the room and us having to redecorate again?” He lifted an eyebrow.
“You know, when he admitted his undying love in the middle of the war, I kind of expected them to get together then and there,” Draco commented watching Longbottom disappear into the distance.
Draco let out a sigh, rubbing his forehead, “Did you just fall down the stairs?”
“How do you cope?” was his first words as Ginny answered the video call.
Pansy tilted her head, “When did you get this?”
As soon as the ball left his hand he realised the error: it wasn’t going to hit the intended target. Aborting mission, Draco ran straight into a clump of trees. Finding shelter, he sat down and hid until someone else had the same idea, and flung themselves down next to him.
Changing the topic with a distraction technique, Harry knew it well. Inspecting Malfoy’s actions and face as he handed over the list, the slight pink blush got worse when he spotted Harry staring.
“I'm not moving.” He replied, thinking ‘
“I was forced, if you must know, Potter.”
Draco easily caught up, laughing, “Sure you aren’t scared?”
“Naturally, Potter.”
Meanwhile, the other party dared not move until he heard the click of the bathroom lock. Then he curled into a tight ball. He couldn't believe he had done that! HOW did he allow himself to climb into Harry's bed so openly last night? And now he had been draped over his body like a scarf. What if he had dribbled on Harry? Did he drool? Digging his face even deeper into the pillow, & finding comfort in Harry's scent, Draco realised exactly how screwed he was. Taking a deep breath, He utilized the chance to escape.
The leaves behind them rustled seconds before the confident smirk on Draco’s lips disappeared. He jumped forwards crashing into Harry. Harry instantly caught him holding him upright, while Draco snapped around looking behind him. “Something just hit me.”
After a while of silence, Draco opened his eyes. “Do you ever wonder why most of the ministry shuts down for Christmas? I mean, nothing else shuts down, so why would the government?”
“So, a friendship is all you want?” Harry asked, sounding disappointed.
“They both have similar views and personalities on certain topics.”
“What?” Both Pansy and Hermione replied in sync. Feeling twin bolts of shock cross them. Clearly Pansy wasn’t the only one out of the loop.
To think he was voluntarily leaving Draco alone when only the other day he was on the edge of panic at the idea of Draco left unsupervised in his house. How had things changed in such a short amount of time?
Prompt: Warmth
Malfoy was looking curiously around as he entered the room, “You’ve cleaned.” He said without looking at Harry, his voice remaining neutral.
“I mean Game of Thrones, It’s shortened to GOT.”
He still wasn’t sure what to make of it, While it was Albus handwriting, he had followed the dots; it was Harry’s handwriting. So had Harry been inviting him through Albus? However this was back before they were a thing, they weren’t even a thing now.
“No.” came the guilty response.
“Woahda” was all Draco could manage as a reply, feeling his entire body going red. When did it stop being so cold?
Photo Prompt 8:
“Good that’s exactly what we need!, A change, something different from our normal.”
Glancing over, his heart partly sank as he noticed the glitter bathed tabletop, with added glitter in Albus’ hair. Who was still working away on his ‘list’ Harry could feel himself smiling like a fool. But he didn’t care. Pulling out his phone, he took a quick snap of Albus and sent it to Ginny. Harry hadn’t appreciated how much work Ginny put into Christmas. She always just got on with it. To imagine she would do all this alongside training for quidditch. He shook his head, amazed by her achievements.
Harry only caught part of what he was saying, “Good news?” He repeated back, confused.
Pansy sighed, taking a deep breath, “Let’s start from the beginning, how do you know Draco is coming Christmas day?”
“That’s not important.”
Draco bit his lip, clearly attempting to fight back a laugh. Harry wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and attempted to break him. While he came close, sadly it didn’t work, Draco stayed firm. Only speaking when his face was back neutral once more, “Considering the price of life, £7500 per week is pretty reasonable, don’t know why you are complaining.”
“So I should leave then?” Harry smirked raising from the bed.
A big thank you, to Jeldenil &Thestarryknight for helping come up with names <3
Draco just nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
“Fine. What do you think genius?” Harry exaggerated the words.
Draco nodded, eyes still closed as he itched his forehead. “Yep, so now, however many hundreds of years down the line, it’s still a tradition. Where Purebloods still spent the two weeks before and after Christmas partying all night every night. With the exact same crowd, but now it’s more of a show of money and status.” Draco picked up his drink, nearly slipping and spilling it.
“I just don't get why she can’t see how much of a rubbish character Cersei is!”
“If my arm wasn’t so heavy from lifting that 2-gram stamp, I’d punch you.”
“The majority of people around here.”
“Oh, you mean that TV show we are watching tomorrow.”
Greg laughed, shaking his head, “Well if you ever wanna help a mate out, you know where to find me. So where is Harry? Didn’t he join ya?” Greg looked around.
“Your stupidity has never been in question, Potter.”
“Get your cold feet off my legs.”

Harry’s smile fell from his face, “What? Have you put a pen lid up your nose?” Harry shouted, diving across the table.
Hermione frowned, “Why would he think that?”
“Seriously.”
That was until Potter opened his big gob and ruined it all….
The pair dissolving into an awkward silence, listening to the shouts and splattering of snow around them.
“Why not have a potato? Pass that pillow.”
“Fine. Bye.”
The welcome to Hogsmeade sign.
"Look who's talking at 3 am now," He could hear Draco’s smirk.
“Are we doing cutting and glueing?” Scorpius joined in, his eyes just over the edge of the table.
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
Malfoy’s jaw hung open, “Yes, but you can’t write that on the invite! People won’t reply?!”
Hermione sighed, “The two idiots have danced around each other for too long, We are trying to set them up, starting with Getting Draco to attend Christmas day.”
Before Draco could reply, he collapsed onto the ground with a thud. Gripping his thigh. Harry was amazed he didn’t make a sound, especially with the pained look shooting across his eyes, as he attempted to move his leg.
Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and assisted him up. “Sorry, he wants to be a Rhino today and Rhinos can’t use human words.” He explained.
“You get them!”
“Bad memories,” Harry unsteadily said.
A three covered in thick snow, with coloured Christmas lights in the background.
Sirius shook his head, “Nope. He helped Teddy finish his work, then said he wanted to leave before any other injuries happened. Something about my little Rhino having a powerful headbutt.” Sirius chuckled at the idea. “And he’d see you again Christmas eve if not before.” Sirius shrugged.
“Yes, I’ll see you on Sunday.” Within that one sentence all traces of hope vanished, Harry could feel his stomach drop as he came crashing down to reality. He was so close and so sure that Sunday would be cancelled.
“First thanks for calling me boring.” Harry joked, then started a tickle war he knew he’d win.
“She says she likes you too much to eat you.”
Harry elbowed him, “Lie.” He shuffled forwards in his seat again so he faced Draco.
Draco looked down at the cup “Thank you.” He muttered. Then made some space at the deck for Harry to sit down at. The pair sat in silence, sipping their drinks until they made eye contact.
“Harry.”
“I’m terrified,” Harry quietly muttered standing by the door, “How are you so calm?” He looked the man up and down.
(I took some liberty with this and they've gone to a wizarding place inside london)

Draco was still stood against the wall, debating a reply when Pansy arrived with the first issue of the night. He shoved his phone into his pocket. Not getting another chance to check his phone till he got home.
(vive le vent) JingleBells!
Harry burst out into a face splitting smile as he dived forwards, trying to hug Draco tightly and nearly knocked him off the sofa. Draco attempted to save the little of his dignity he still held and shoved him off. Failing epically. Only pausing when the pop of Kreacher arrived made them jump. Draco looked up to find a rather embarrassed looking house-elf. “Master Potter’s potions. Please continue.” Kreacher placed the bottle on the table and was gone.
