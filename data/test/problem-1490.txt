Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. Persephone rolled her eyes at them and took a great leap over the tree, using her newfound powers. When Ron caught up to her, not in the slightest surprised at her talent, he was still mad.
She watched them peck at them, wondering if she was mentally okay. Did she finally lose her mind? Why were they eating so vigorously?
She hesitated before taking his arm, her chest filling with a nervous buzzing, “It won’t be so bad. If it’s a duet, usually the guy supports the girl so you can support me, and lift me in the air. It’s really casual and we all have our little groups. We can be in the same group,” She smiled at him and she felt like the luckiest girl in the world to be the one he smiled at so genuinely.
“Saved you a spot,” Hades nodded to the seat by him when he caught her eye. He barely looked up from his textbook, and she clenched her jaw.
It was remarkable how he could show every one of those uncomfortably white teeth even when he wasn’t talking.
“So…I take it you’ve met Malfoy before?" The tall boy asked, turning once more to look down at her with dark grey eyes.
Persephone ignored him, “Firenze saved me but he should not have done so because he interfered with my being killed by Voldemort—it must be written in the stars that I will be murdered by Voldemort. I escaped him once but the stars are there—and MARS IS BRIGHT WHICH MEANS WAR OR SOMETHING RIGHT!?”
She knew she was not ever travelling by Floo powder if she had the choice not to ever again when all she could see was green. It was like being flushed down the toilet, spinning very fast with the roar of fire in her ears. She saw the blur of what looked like rooms and fireplaces but at some point she couldn’t really focus on any of them. She tried to keep from fidgeting but she, at some point, felt her stomach turn over and her nose sting and she sneezed, loudly, and fell onto a cold stone floor.
Neither Uncle Vernon nor Aunt Petunia seemed concerned about this—Aunt Petunia quite literally burst into tears, saying that she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so
Susan continued to blush, and Persephone thought it best she not get her hopes on Malfoy. She would much rather not have her friend exposed to scum like that.
Horror-struck, Persephone waved madly at the others to follow her as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, Persephone warning them silently not to move the door by even a wind sweep. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Persephone on a stool next to him and immediately, a measuring tape took to wrapping itself around her slim waist and took her arm’s measurements, as well as every other measurement. She was so amazed by this—she’d had some sewing experience, always cutting up Dudley’s clothes and sewing it tighter for her own personal fit. In her moment of amazement, she nearly missed the boy’s stare. He was staring, unashamed, with his eyes wide.
“ANYWAY!” George said, “Fred and I have been betting each other on who can throw you highest so would mind if we threw you in the air?”
"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you—you're Nearly Headless Nick!"
She took a great step up on the air as it solidified to her will and pushed herself up over the door, just near the ceiling. Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. For a wild moment, she thought she saw something rotten under the turban but he had been walking away now. Good thing too—it would be terrible if he looked up.
September turned into October very quickly and she had much to think about—mostly about her father. She’d nearly forgotten than her father was Mexican (as she had heard Uncle Vernon talking about), or at least of Spanish heritage. She didn’t know who to ask about it but she thought it best to assume he was Mexican, making her Mexican, though she didn’t have the olive skin. She reminded herself that skin tone didn’t make you a race.
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side.” Her heart thundered at the mention of her parents, a new picture exploding in her head of them.
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Persephone privately agreed, wondering if it would have been better to just say she knew so they could go back to Privet Drive, but she cheered herself up with wondering how cool it would be to be Poseidon’s daughter. No better than her actual parents but sort of.
"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than her already short frame.
It was quite the job getting the crate up to the castle and then even more of a job to heave the crate up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the darkened corridors. It seemed like the castle truly seemed endless when they needed to pull along a crate with a dragon in it. Persephone nearly cried in relief when they finally reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
“Right—” He smirked, “You’ve got a number of admirers, you’re what’s considered very pretty, you’re observant, and your eyes are considered somewhat ocean like.”
“You would definitely get the part! You look so much like her!” Susan gushed. “And I’m trying out for the part of Dorothy,” She smiled.
It only made it an inch away from the floor before Persephone could find it in herself to control the air. Just beneath the pudding, the air had solidified. Her arm stretched out, she tried with much concentration—and stinging—to keep it in the air long enough for her to get it in her hand.
“Alright, that’s enough!” George shot back. Everyone looked at him. “This is utter rubbish—she lost fifty points. Not a hundred and fifty. Just fifty. Let’s not forget that she’s the reason this team is doing so well and winning this year. Let’s not forget she earns more points in one class than any of you do in a day! And let’s not forget that without her we wouldn’t even have a chance at winning the cup. So for all of you giving her a hard time, remember that we’re supposed to be a team that we’re supposed to treat our house members like family.” He fumed, throwing his hands up.
“Both mythological, both middle names starting with ‘L’…” She smiled. “I suppose our names have a theme, too—mine is of the underworld, like hell. Yours is of the moon.” How strange—a siren meets a girl named after the moon.
“Well, no…” He said, flipping through his long parts of parchment, “You’re probably a siren from the Mediterranean—warmer water equate to more beautiful sirens and you’re obviously not a selkie of Scotland or…a Merrow of Ireland.” He flipped to pages in the books and she stared at the ugly fish being.
He did this very thing to wake her up. When she opened her eyes, she found her cat on her chest, pressing her paws against her face. She reached up to stroke her little head, and listened to her purr. Persephone leaned up to stretch before her head hit something that definitely did not feel like the bed. She looked down towards her pillow, towards the head of the bed where her feet were and gasped.
It was undetailed that for a moment, she needed to go over these words. The next moment, she was examining the room—and then the cup of water inside the cage of a mice, with a mice next to it. Okay. She glanced at Professor McGonagall, who was watching, before she approached the glass of water. It was sat on an old looking stool. She pursed her lips before examining underneath the stool. Key. She grinned.
interesting—she ended up reading a few of them twice. Her potions, mostly. She was sure she would enjoy the class, as she’d already memorized most of the books. She did end up going off to the library to find some more books, mostly on flowers and such that were included in her school books.
This was another reason why Persephone spent as much time as possible out of the house, inside the Johnsons’ home and in Diana’s room. A few years ago, she’d attended a boarding school out of London—now she’d been packing up her trunk of old school things in a trunk, some clothes, a little badge with the letter P on it, etc.
Speaking of Slytherin associated with energy, "Bulstrode, Millicent" became a Slytherin and she definitely had the energy of those girls that bullied other, smaller girls. (Maybe it was her imagination, but she swore she could hear ‘boos’ from the Gryffindor table).
Then, the Thestrals parted and she saw something so horrible and beautiful, it brought tears to her eyes.
“No-maj soil doesn’t work for wand making.” He told her. He shifted through the dirt, pulling out the seeds.
“Yeah but you could have chosen to be with the twins and me,” She said and almost faltered with the latter person.
Back in the Room of Requirement, Persephone was sat in front of the fireplace with a heavy blanket over her shoulders and her hair over her blanket, red and curly again.
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed. Persephone was half asleep over her books, her glasses pushed up into her hair. She should not be so vulnerable around a common area for George and Fred to sneak up on her but she was
“Well…I’m sure Slytherin aren’t all bad…” She muttered, looking away and gasping, “Oh Hagrid, can we go in there!” She pointed to what looked like a cosmetics and hair salon.
“Oh! Thank you, that’s sweet,” Cedric was the definition of nice boy. “I bet Flitwick’s the most disappointed, eh? He was really looking forward to it…”
She wished she could simply use her metamorphmagus powers but they seemed to have simmered. Ever since that she’d gotten back to the Durlseys, she had been unable to do anything with her appearance.
She rolled the window down, to let Hedwig go, “Alright, Hedwig, to Dumbledore, alright? As fast as you can!” And she sent her owl flying.
She walked in almost a trance like state to the Gryffindor common room, with the book in hand, trying to understand what had just occurred and how. She climbed the stairs up to the portrait of the Fat Lady.
“But, neither will know because we’ll get it back in the garage without anyone noticing it’s gone. Besides, Dad worked tonight.”
She was staring at bright golden eyes. Salem was coiled up in a defensive manner at the end of her bed, making a low, glowering sound. His ears were down and he was hissing. She reached for him, confused, and he yowled at her loudly. She jumped back and decided she ought to give him space.
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
A few minutes later, after opening about ten of them, Hermione resurfaced with Dumbledore’s card. “Read it!” Persephone shrieked in excitement. Hermione’s eyes quickly read through the words and her eyes widened when she looked back up at Persephone. Persephone nodded excitedly.
“What books? The only stories I’ve seen you read are those Greek Mythology ones,” Hermione gasped knowingly, “Lily, please tell me this is not another scheme to try and get me to read those, you know I have no interest in the greek myths.”
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. She looked to her table, looking down the table. She scanned the Ravenclaw table and caught the eye of someone on the other side of the table—it was a girl with slightly caramel hair, who caught her eye just as she noticed her. She smiled at her but before Persephone could smile back, Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
“Closest natural body of water—the lake,” He said, mostly to himself she had to guess. “I can’t get you out into the lake right now—you’ll freeze or someone might see,” he was muttering now, taking her bag in his hands. “Okay, I know what to do—get you into the lake and find out if youre immune to water temperature.”
She had taken a little snack from the cupboard in the kitchen, a little one of those bags of very small round cookies. She found it out of her bag, and, without opening it, she made sure she crushed most of them inside. Then she opened it as much as possible so it was now just a shiny little plastic placement with crushed cookies on it. She placed on the ground and hopped away as they hopped towards it.
Her eyes—and mind—were far away, “Have you ever thought about that first war? The one my parents died in?”
She explained that the school prided itself on the academic excellence, as it offered summer programs for those who were able to attend to them. They passed what could only be students, dressed in savoy blue robes with a golden bull clasp. Evangeline told them that the bull was the emblem of the city of Turin, as it appeared on both uniform and school crest. The blue was the color of the Royal House of Savoy that once ruled over Italy before it became a republic. She cheerfully added that this was why the national football team had blue uniforms despite the red, white and green flag.
He straightened, “Oh—oh okay, sorry—I just…he said he wanted to talk to you alone and I just thought…since you were joking when Patrick asked about who you like…”
She dried herself off easily—siren power? Maybe—before putting the dress on. The dress looked old-fashioned, more 50s inspired then modern. It was baby pink, with lots of slippery silk above the actual skirt. It was a collared dressed with see through, loose silk adorning the bodice. The bodice was heart shaped, with button to the skirt that hugged her waist.
"It's not my fault," Wood said. "We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
“Wood will kill you if you faint from hunger—and then kill himself,” Fred told her, “You wouldn’t want that on your conscious, would you?”
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. "You never told her? Never told her what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer her? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from her all these years?"
"Fred and George are in Gryffindor," he said, probably glad she didn’t mention what had just happened. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again, and she was glad he left the situation alone. "Mom and Dad were in Gryffindor, too, see. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but I don’t think I’d want to be in Slytherin."
At the end of the meeting, Hades slid something into her bag under the table. She shot him a confused glance and he mouthed to her, ‘Later’. Her heart sudden took off and she looked away, flushing a deep red. What could it be? What would he write to her?
“Seph,” Hades was panicking now, unsure of what to do when he put his hand on Persephone’s shoulder.
“I have to go.” Persephone said quickly. She ignored both of her friend’s pretty faces that were guessing that she had to go to get out of the question.
The Gryffindor common room was noisy that evening—many were hyping up for the game tomorrow. The trio sat together by a window—Hermione was checking Ron’s Charms homework for him, while Persephone was hyping herself up to go get her book back. It wasn’t that she was afraid of her potions teacher—she was just…just….
“We’ll be just a minute,” He threw over his shoulder and she didn’t get a chance to see Daphne’s expression at this.
It didn’t matter where it was, or how ominous this statement was, because she wouldn’t be opening any chamber, especially not one that would end up killing muggleborns, or anyone for that matter.
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. Hermione tried to keep calming her down and she slept with her in the same bed. They spoke only of exams, Hermione trying to calm her down. At some point, the two girls fell asleep, but not before Persephone thought of something—was Quirrell not there that day, in the pub, on July 31
As soon as she was out of the water, she snapped into reality. She immediately started shivering and she snapped down to pick her robes up and throw them over her. She tossed her hair over the robes as for it not to touch her—and, “Woah! My hair!”
His face softened an inch, “You can support her by being there for her,” His voice had softened too. “You can support her by offering to help her talk through it, or by accepting her and her feelings. You can support her, first off, by apologizing.”
"SHHHH!" Hagrid urged them once more again. "Listen—come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh --"
Persephone was still laughing and gasping for air at her sudden burst for exercise while Ron collapsed on the floor, heaving.
There she stood, in front of what looked like at least ten others. She glanced over her should, and was assured that she was alone, still. Were there other invisible people, too? Was she in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? It reflected her perfectly fine.
She’d been kept in the hospital wing overnight, though Madame Pomfrey had healed her broken bones in minutes, apparently. She was unconscious for it. Oliver Wood had been her very first visitor, coming into the hospital wing in hysterics, asking if she was still able to play right on a broom. It was much like how the student director of the play had come up and checked out if she could still dance.
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?" Persephone frowned in contemplation—it seemed like a simple mistake, as it was solved so quick with just a wave of his wand. Shouldn’t he be concerned
He winked dramatically and Persephone snorted. Five minutes later, they were marching up the hill, broomsticks in hand. They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, because it would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. She’d leave her Nimbus Two Thousand in their care during the weekdays and found it smelled like apples.
"Well, now, Mr. Malfoy, that is no way to speak to a young lady!” He squeaked. “Apologize this instant or I shall be seeing you in detention!”
From Daphne, she got what felt like clothes but when she opened it up, she found it was not just clothes but a witch outfit! Like, actual
She finally slowed, her heart beating wildly. Where had she gone? She could no longer hear the screaming—but the large suit of armor in front of her didn’t make sense. She recognized it immediately as the one near the kitchens, but it didn’t look like the basement. No pear painting in sight.
God, Harry thought as he pushed off of the river wall and made his way over to Draco. Why does he have to be so damn endearing?
“Fuck you,” Draco spat on the knight's face, who was unfazed. “What are you going to do to him? He's not…?” Draco's voice tapered off as he saw another knight practically toss Harry’s body into the carriage behind them.
“Christ,” Draco said, scrubbing his hand over his face. “What’s gotten you in such a spectacular mood this early?”
“I was originally planning on killing him. My change of heart is purely for the sake of our Kingdom. Some appreciation may be in order for your mother, however,” He shook his head, irritated. “She begged me to spare him. Not that I would have listened, of course. Endless rhetoric about true love. Utterly ridiculous.”
Draco seemed to soak up the praise as he kissed Harry with growing enthusiasm. Harry took this opportunity to nibble Draco's lips. He drank in his boyfriend's responding squeak of surprise and pulled him close. He could feel Draco's heart beat even through his thick robes.
“Bossy,” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips, pushing into him nice and slow. Draco threw his head back in pleasure, mumbling out a “thank God” as Harry filled him up.
He was still for a moment and Harry rolled his eyes, hoping to Merlin that Draco knew how to kick upwards by now. In a moment his prayers were answered and Draco’s blonde head popped out of the water.
Harry kissed Draco once more, sloppy and sated, and lay down next to  him. He flung his arm across Draco, who cleaned them up with a quick flick of his wand and a mumbled spell.
With a tactile movement of his fingers both of their clothes were gone, neatly folded across the room, and Harry grinned. He still hadn’t gotten used to the many perks that came with being someone who could utilize their magic.
Draco looked down, moving his wiry legs about and giving Harry a good kick to the shin. Harry sucked in a breath of pain but Draco failed to notice, too absorbed in his own failing attempts at kicking.
“He bloody better be!” Ron slammed his butterbeer down in front of him, causing yet another spill. “Takes everything in me not to punch his pretty face every time I see him at the Ministry. I can’t believe they gave him a job after what he did.”
Though this resentment was somehow...different, than that of his school years. It made Draco’s chest feel tight, and made his stomach churn. Draco sighed, head now in his hands. This resentment was different because it was not directed at Potter at all; it was directed towards himself. Draco did not deserve any amount of politeness from the Boy Who Lived. He deserved hatred, disdain, disgust. To be spit on, stepped on, perhaps. Not this complete and utter horseshite.
“I know damn well about his magic,” Draco spat, voice pure venom. “Never show your smarmy face anywhere near my Castle again, or I swear I'll have you executed.”
“Dammit, just let me out! I’m the fucking Prince, for Merlin’s sake! Can’t I at least see what’s going on?”
“Shut it, they suit my face just fine. And they’ll suit Scorpius’ too,” Harry said, hand on his hip. By now, Scorpius had run off and was bouncing around the living room, giggling and screaming a lullaby about Babbity Rabbity.
“I know he’s not. I could sense his magic from a mile away. I just like to rile you up. Now, if you’ve finished interrogating me about my romantic endeavors, I’ll leave you to go track down...what was his name? Perry?”
“Yes,” Draco mumbled, shifting his weight from foot to foot. “Yes, you should. Make it snappy, Potter, or I’ll leave without you.”
“Where is he being kept?” He asked one of the knights awaiting his arrival in the hallway. “Tell me at once.”
Harry grinned slyly; Draco would sometimes slip back into his petty “Potter” stage when he was frustrated; sex was no exception. And if Harry liked it, well, no one would ever have to know.
All of the blood drained from Vernon’s face. “N-No, Good Sir. Please, do take a seat. Harry will cook something up for you in a moment, isn’t that right, Harry?”
Ron snorted, looking around the manor which, although large, had decayed with time. “You should see where I grew up. Mom and dad call it the Burrow, which I’d say is a fitting name.”
Harry, flustered, uttered out a desperate “What?!” only to see that Ron and Hermione had gone on ahead, arm in arm. Traitors, Harry thought with a huff. He cursed under his breath, completely alone now, and stared at the scene before him. At least a hundred people, all dressed in absurdly flamboyant clothing, were dancing to a rather obnoxious symphony. No one had noticed him, at least not yet; he was obscured by the shadow of the silver awning above him. He waited for a few moments, allowing a three more royals to pass him, and then made his way down the staircase.
Draco rolled his grey eyes and continued sifting through the sand. It wasn’t long before his sharp voice cut through the awkward silence.
Draco rolled his eyes theatrically, blowing his un-gelled blond hair away from his face. “No, you imbecile. I cornered you at the ball for fun. Yes, I’m fucking attracted to you!” Draco knew he was bright red, now, and despite his strong posture all he wanted to do was curl in on himself.
Draco sniffed proudly.  looking down at Harry with false contempt. “Excellent. I could use the company, even if it is from a good-nothing-squib such as yourself.”
Before he knew it, Ron had ordered the three of them a round of shots. And then another, and then another. Harry’s head was spinning by the time Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes and apparated back home.
Draco blinked, lips parted slightly, and sunk to his knees to be level with Harry, who was still sitting on the red couch. Harry's throat was suddenly dry. Draco on his knees was a very, very good image.
The intrusive thought hit Draco like a freight train. He’d had Crabbe and Goyle, sure, but they’d never actually given two fucks about him. He’d had a painful realization a few years back that they really only spent so much time with him under the direction of their fathers. Pansy had been good to him--well, she’d tried to be. But she had gone the moment the War ended. They all had.
“Father, perhaps we should invite commoners as well? They may not be of royal blood but you and I both know that status doesn’t actually dictate the purity and power of someone’s blood.”
“He’s not a Muggle!” Draco bellowed, eyes suddenly stinging. Lucius stood and pounded his fist against his desk, causing many decorations to wobble precariously.
PS: what pairings would you like to see from me? I'm planning on writing another 30kish fic. Also, I am ALWAYS looking for fic requests!! Any pairing, go ahead and try me!
“It’s quite alright, Ronald,” She said. Her feet were suddenly dangling in front of Harry’s nose and then she had hopped down, clad in a set of tattered blue pajamas. Her hair was practically an actual nest at this point. “I take it he was wearing a disguise of some kind?” She said through a yawn.  Ron looked at her with wonder as she took a seat next to Harry on his bed.
Draco realized then that he himself hadn’t the faintest idea what day it was. He flushed and folded in on himself slightly, shame and embarrassment creeping in-- that was until Potter began to laugh. The sound seemed to bubble up from somewhere deep below and explode out of him-- a warm rumbling that Draco wanted to bottle up and save for rainy days. It was almost painful when Draco felt his own grimace twist into something resembling a smile.
“Hold on…” Ron said slowly, eyes flitting between the other two. “The Prince. You were making out with the Prince?!”
The days that followed were incredibly uneventful. Dull, drab, dim; everything that Draco Malfoy was not. Harry shook his head in an attempt to shake away the invasive thoughts of the ponce; they seemed to be constantly nagging him ever since that damned lesson. But who could blame him when the man was so bloody attractive? Harry was only human, after all.
“Malfoy. It’s alright, you’re dreaming. Wake up,” Harry had never been good at this whole comfort thing. He squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder and the man stilled for a moment. Harry thought his job was done, until Malfoy gasped and sat up in bed.
“A-Anything, Good Sir. I’m sure your advice would be of much help to us,” Vernon said, looking up at Draco hopefully. Harry repressed the urge to scoff at Vernon’s obvious, desperate thirst for money.
Harriet sighed at that, tucking hair behind her ear. Her features smoothed themselves back into a facade of forced neutrality. “Are you finished, Draca? I’ve places to be.” Harriet, without waiting for a reply, attempted to walk past Draca and her friends, only to be blocked by the lithe blond.
Typically, Draco would make use of the countless secret passageways, hidden doors, and winding corridors of the Ministry in order to prevent this very thing from happening, but today he had been in quite the rush. Draco had overslept--nightmares again-- and arrived to work just one minute before he was set to begin for the day. Much to his chagrin, Draco had practically sprinted to his office. And of course, while running like a fool with his arse on fire, he had locked eyes with Potter of all people. And the bastard, rather than smirking or laughing, had smiled. Politely.
“Hello there,” The brunette said, placing a manicured hand on her hip. “May I ask why you’re wearing suits on the beach?”
Draco was still for a moment and then did as told, lifting up his head and standing up. His movements, normally poised and calculated, were far from graceful now.
“No, I don’t!” Harry snapped, turning away from Draco and crossing his arms defiantly. “And if you don’t like it then you can get the hell out of here and find someone else who will deal with your incessant whining.”
Draco rolled his eyes, grumbling under his breath about “incompetent squibs”, and pulled out his wand. It was dark and smooth, probably crafted from hawthorn wood; it fit Draco perfectly. He flicked it with a graceful wrist, and a modest tent materialized before them. Harry rose his eyebrows, impressed.
Draco sputtered, flushing further. “Of course I don’t, Mother! I’m simply anxious about who my future spouse will be! That's natural, isn't it?!”
Harry simpered, eyes twinkling. “Sure, Draco.” He swam towards him with quick and graceful strokes, revelling in Draco’s look of wonder.
“Hello, my lovely Kings,” She said sweetly, heels clicking as she walked towards harry and kissed him as well. “How are we?”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed and he looked the chair up and down. He seemed to consider  protesting, opening his mouth for a moment and then closing it. He dusted off the chair with his hand and then sat down.
“And you didn't bother to look?” Draco asked coldly, repressing the urge to spit on the groveling sod who was practically licking his shoes.
Harry turned around and looked at Malfoy strangely.  The way Harry’s name fell from his tongue was acidic, so eerily similar to how he had sounded when they were teenagers. “Would you like help with that?”
“Oh, shit,” Harry said, realizing that it was probably high noon by now. “I do. And I’m going to be late because of you.”
“Would you shut up and walk? I’ve asked you to take me home and fuck me. Don’t make me change my mind.”
Harry huffed out a breath and shook his head, but did as told. God, Harry thought as he wrapped his calloused hands around Draco’s white waist once again. His skin is so soft.
“Mum made him tea,” Ron said. “So he’s probably sitting and waiting for you. Mum knows what’s going on, so I’m sure she let him know that you’re here.”
Harry, at a loss for words, simply looked back and forth between his two friends. "I...alright, thanks? For saving me."
“Something funny, boy?” Vernon turned towards Harry, face purpleing. “Shut it or I’ll lock you out.”
“Be patient,” Harry murmured, kissing Draco’s neck sloppily. “I don’t have anything to prep you with.”
“Let’s go!” Ron yanked Harry outside and gestured towards the grand carriage that awaited them. It matched Harry’s robes; it was a creamy shade of ivory and seemed to be encrusted in gold. Two black stallions, all muscle, stood still and complaint in front of the footmen, who donned a silly white wig and glossy shoes. Harry was rendered speechless; all he could do was follow Ron inside.
He ignored the incessant knocking of his servant, who normally prepared him for the day if requested. But today, Draco was in no mood to be fretted over.
Harry was still. He was in a daze as he watched parts of the granite ceiling fall in. Had he done this?
“Sure thing! Here, look at what I brought you,” Ron opened a leather satchel that he’d slung around his shoulder and pulled out a white, high-collared dress robe with shining golden buttons and silk embroidery. Harry had never seen something so fancy in his life, aside from Draco himself, and he couldn’t hide his shock.
“Your Grace, your Royal Highness, I apologise from the bottom of my heart. Had I known it was you, such a pleasure, I would not have--”
They kept this up for a few moments, still-clothed bodies pressed impossibly close to each other in desperation.
The Burrow was cluttered, but that was not to say that it was not in order. Somehow, the countless cracked dishes were in neat piles, some so high that they brushed the low, oakwood ceiling. The aging furniture welcomed Harry’s weight, creaking and groaning greetings as he sat. The walls, a soothing beige, were lined with mismatched paintings of landscapes, wizards, and yellowing art created years ago by the Weasley siblings. The family itself was a vision. Mrs. Weasley, plump and as red-faced as her son, treated Harry with unyielding kindness and respect. At times, her words proved to be overwhelming; Harry had never been treated with such grace. He was, however, a bit tired of all the food she was constantly serving him. Harry had never been a big eater. The rest of the household had welcomed Harry with open arms. Mr. Weasley, a soft and quiet man, seemed to produce a continuous flow of conciliation. If any conflict, no matter how friendly, arose between Ron and Hermione, Mr. Weasley would step in and mollify both parties with a simple touch of his hand.
“Oi! Watch where you’re going, Draco,” Pansy Parkinson said, dusting off her jewel-covered dress. Draco idly stared at her from where he had fallen after the collision.
“Not at all, Sir.” Harry said, eyeing Malfoy curiously. It had been five years since the War, so why did Malfoy’s face look like something crawled up his arse and died? Did he still see Harry as a rival even after all this time? Harry wouldn’t put it past him.
“Yes, my guards witnessed it, as did I. As such, Harry Potter will be your life partner and my second heir.”
“Later,” Hermione said quickly. “I’ll tell you about my night later, if you must know. But you first.”
“You useless, good-for-nothing Squib,” Vernon said through his teeth, continuing to stomp down the stairs. “Dudley and I have been expecting lunch for the past hour. Can’t you do anything right?!”
The next morning, Harry took care of his numerous chores and then headed to the library. He jumped from cobblestone to cobblestone, and this time decided to talk to Neville.
“No?” Harry removed himself from Draco, devilishly slow, and crossed his arms over his chest. Despite their similar height, Draco looked so small, vulnerable and turned on all at once and Harry suddenly wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep playing this game. “Alright then.”
“Oh,” Draco gasped when Harry shoved his hands into Draco’s underclothes and grabbed his cock. Harry released a shuddering breath; Draco could have came right then when he realized that Harry was just as far gone as he was.
Pan’s mouth dropped open and he glared at Draca pointedly. “Are you serious?! There’s no way that’d be allowed--”
“My father is capable of anything,” Draca said proudly, pointed chin held high and glossy lips in a proud pout.
As soon as Harry entered his office, he was barraged by countless memos. His eyes narrowed-- this was way more than usual. He gingerly opened up one of the little birds and began to read the neat handwriting:
“Well, I suppose I’d better get back to my cleaning and laundry. Enjoy having actual careers!” Harry said, chest lighter than it had been a while.
“On the floor,” Harry replied, humiliated. God, why did he think this was a good idea? Ron was a knight, someone of a much higher status than he--
“You can check out anything you like, Harry. As long as you bring it back,” Hermione said rather sternly. Harry laughed.
Harry’s chest ached with genuine empathy-- he knew the feeling, after all. He sat there, watching Malfoy with a frown. For a moment, he considered getting up and waking him but then thought better of it-- it wasn’t any of his business. Was it?
“You’re so fucking hot,” Harry said, voice hoarse. Draco was chanting his name over and over, voice strained from begging to be fucked harder. Harry obliged, and soon he was past the point of rational thought. Draco seemed to be as well, mumbling gibberish into the crook of Harry’s neck.
“That’s not--You can’t put it back in the dirt after you wash it. You’ve never done this before, have you?” Harry asked, deciding that maybe he should try to be a little more patient. He was making a rich nobleman wash clothes, after all.
Someone cleared their throat from the other side of the room and both Harry and Draco jumped a mile, pushing away from each other in record time. In the doorway stood an awkwardly-posed Mr. Weasley, staring at the ceiling and whistling a tone deaf tune with a stiff hand at his side.
Harry flushed and cleared his throat awkwardly. He was definitely not excited to see this pansified nitwit without all those clothes on, definitely not. “Oh, you weren't ? I suppose you’re not as thick as you look, then.”
Harry decided to try and sleep through the noise. But as soon as his head hit the pillow, Malfoy mumbled something incoherent. Harry strained his ears and tried to make out Malfoy’s words.
“Hey, all else aside, I’d say you’re doing pretty well. Now you know how to survive if you ever fall into another river without a lowly servant nearby to save you.”
“Draco,” Harry said over the crunching of their feet. “We’ve been walking for half an hour. Can you please tell me where we’re going? Or are you too ‘mysterious’ for that?”
The Prince grabbed his hand before he could protest and pulled him away from the crowd. Countless murmurs shadowed their path until the Prince had taken them to some sort of empty hallway complete with ornamental marble and gold-framed portraits. The ceiling was high and Harry had never seen anything so obnoxiously gaudy.
Draco grumbled. “You could buy another pair, you know. A better pair. You know, one that actually suits your face.”
“Ronda!” ‘Mione hissed, placing two large, dark hands on his hips. “Stop it, you’ll only make things worse.”
“We’ll share it,” Potter said, before Malfoy could even get a word of protest in. “The Ministry will have the payment to you by tomorrow. You’ll be receiving an owl.”
Draca froze at that, removing her hand as if she’d been burned. Her grey eyes were wide as her face heated up. Ronda barked out a laugh at this reaction, and ‘Mione shushed her hurriedly.
“Yes, Father.” Draco replied, wondering where his father could be going with this. He was already well aware of his duties.
“Bloody hell! This is a library and you don’t even have any of the King’s Speeches?!” The knight practically bellowed. His nose was long and his ears were large. Freckles were sprayed haphazardly across his ruddy cheeks.
The color had drained from Vernon’s cheeks and he swallowed, sinking impossibly closer to the ground. “Y-Yes, your Highness. Of course.”
An Encyclopedia of Dangerous Magical Items and their Properties, he finally made out. Harry was intrigued.
Harry continued on the path to the market, leaves crunching beneath his feet. Fall was ending, and soon it would be spring; this thought made Harry uneasy, although he was unsure why. But before Harry could become fully immersed in his own thoughts, he spotted two familiar figures sprinting towards him.
She was pleasantly surprised when Draca nodded, wrapping her thin arms around her neck and kissing her cheek in an awkward, stiff motion.  “Alright. Treat me well, and perhaps there will be more.”
“He’s insisted that I hold a ball to search for the proper partner who will keep our bloodline pure and powerful.”
“What?” Harry asked, finally turning around and looking at him incredulously. “I should be apologizing, I’ve disrespected you, I’ve insulted you, I’ve--”
Harry adjusted the bandanna on his forehead, trying to keep as many stray black hairs out of his face as possible. He struggled but to no avail; he could not tame his ever-present bed head. Sighing, he returned back to the gargantuan task of cleaning Dudley’s room. He was about halfway through after spending four endless hours on it yesterday. On the left side of the room, Harry could now see the ornate purple carpet lining the floor, although it had a few stains that Harry had not been able to get out. The other half of the room was still trash hell. Piles of rubbish, dirty clothes, broken toys, and half-read books lined the floor. Trying to breathe through his mouth to avoid the pungent odors coming from the piles of mess, Harry grimly set himself to work.
Hi everyone! Thanks so much for sticking with us for this long. This is a shorter chapter, hope that's ok! In the next one the sexual tension is gonna be ridiculous, so prepare yourselves. The ball will also be coming soon, so stay tuned! I hope you're enjoying the story so far. Please comment and let us know if you enjoyed it! I really had fun writing Hermione. She's so cute and amazing. Also...notice any hints about what's going to happen as far as harry's magic is concerned? ;)
Draco made a face at the flowery language and the obscene amount of glitter stuck to the parchment that was now covering his hands.
Harry placed his hands on Draco’s cheeks, pulling him in once again, and for the first time in his entire miserable existence, he was home.
“I hate to ask for such a thing,” Draco gasped in between gulps of water. “But can you please help me?”
Draco was aware of how he must have looked; he was gaping at his father like a child who had just received a precious gift.
The King stood a safe distance from him, unfeeling eyes locked on his. He took a moment to answer Harry’s inquiry, although his gaze did not waver. When he spoke, his thin lips just barely moved. “You are to wait here until further instructions.”
“There’s one problem with that, Dudley, since I wouldn’t have anywhere to cook your meals,” Harry said, crossing his arms in annoyance.
“Bossy,” Harry stripped himself of his shirt absently, completely unaware of Draco's’ lingering gaze fixated on his broad chest. Harry shook his head when he noticed the color of his very basic T-shirt.
Draco swallowed nervously after locking eyes with his father. “And how do you propose me to find a suitable heir in such a short amount of time? Surely they must meet your standards.”
The room before her was a smaller version of the library but also of the Gryffindor common room. Shelves lined the walls and in between, from bottom to top. Though the room did not seem too big (much, much tinier than the library), there were a ton of shelves and a ton of books. A fire roared to life somewhere against a wall. By the sole window right next to the fire place was a desk with two chairs, ink and parchment ready for whoever’s use. She had to squint to see it.
She thought for a moment he could read her mind, but then she caught sight of the page he’d turn being titled with the same name. "There's a Ministry of Magic?" She asked without thinking.
Persephone and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think, each fidgeting nervously. Neither girls had ever won a game of chess. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—"
She ignored the stares and took a seat with Ron and picked out an apple while Ron got himself some eggs. She was nervous for the day—first day of lessons as a witch and she had no proper wand. Only dirt and seeds. No seedling, however.
She dodged another Bludger, which spun over her head, and in the moment that she did, her broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.  She thought for a moment she was going to fall right off and with this in mind, her hands tightened and she crossed her ankles underneath the broom, as to keep a hold on it.  She definitely never felt that before.
“She thinks you have a disease, yes, we covered that,” He said impatiently, “Why does she think that you have a disease?”
“We do!?” Mrs. Weasley looked sternly at Ron, who was so confused. “It’s too early in the morning for this.” She set down eggs in front of Ron and Persephone continued.
She wasn’t sure what house he was in—after knowing him for what felt like a good portion of time, she still had no idea. He never had his house colors on him. She’d never seen him in uniform or in robes. It made her feel as if though he didn’t really belong to the school, that he was a figment of her imagination. She didn’t spend much time on that conspiracy as several people she knew made contact with him—the Weasleys twins, the teachers…
As he sat, he stood up quickly—he pulled something off his chair, something of a molting, gray color, breathing heavily.
A sudden noise outside in the corridor made them both freeze, staring at each before Percy panicked, “The mattress—!”
They had reached the end of the passageway now and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, the ceiling arching high above. It was full of small, shiny birds, all fluttering around the room in different directions. Persephone nearly lost her mind at the sound—sensory overload, maybe.
A letter arrived for her the second time that week. Curious, she opened it to find a paper that look like it had been ripped from a notebook and written in ink. The handwriting was slanted and interesting.
Jumping, she looked around, her heart racing, “Who’s there?” She sounded a lot braver than she felt.
Persephone was disbelieving that Snape had been the one to jinx her broom—but she had to believe them because they had seen him, staring at her and mumbling. It seemed the girls were finally finding the same page about Snape, though Persephone was hesitant while Hermione was full force into Snape being the bad guy.
She thought for a moment and smiled, “Actually, you can help me with what I need.” He raised a brow in interest. “About the wand I need to grow—or make, or whatever. Remember?”
“Wait, lemme see!” George said. He took Ron’s place and his face fell in amazement—“It’s—it’s us, Freddie, and we’ve…woah! We’ve got out own joke shop! And—” His face suddenly reddened and he glanced at Persephone in the mirror, “You sure you can’t see this?” When Persephone shook her head, he looked at his heart’s desire once more.
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
, people were pointing up at Persephone as it rolled, over and over. She could barely understand what was going on when suddenly, it jerked her unprepared self and she swung off, barely able to catch herself with one hand.
“You’re acting rather brave for someone who doesn’t know how to throw a proper punch,” Someone spoke before she could.
“No!” She suddenly hissed. She pointed to the side and he turned to stare in the direction. They watched a hooded figure marching swiftly down the front steps of the castle and, to her great surprise, right towards the Forbidden Forest. There was no doubt in her mind that the figure was Snape—she knew that prowling, dramatic walk. He was always passing right by her in class, walking away from her in every given circumstance.
Now, she understood that any original castle like architecture on the inside had been updated. It was somewhat the height of luxury, with high ceilings with Greek styled columns or white marble and intricate crystal chandeliers. The windows were high and framed with thick, expensive velvet curtains with paintings dotting artistically here and there along the walls. There were long, winding staircases in the large entrance hall with a large
"Did you get it?" Ron asked when Persephone finally remembered the password and got in. "What's the matter?"
Persephone listened to the old radio by the sink announce, “Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.”
The crowds lessened by the end of it and Persephone was one of the ones that could move on after dinner. She was amongst Justin and Susan, unfortunately Hannah had not passed. Cedric Diggory complimented her acting and wished her luck in the vocal portion. She thought he was very nice.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Two more centaurs appeared—one had red hair and beard with a gleaming chestnut horse body with a long, reddish tail. The other was a black-haired and bodied centaur. He looked significantly wilder looking than the red haired centaur.
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Pur’sephenie."
She pulled her hair up into a high ponytail and took her little pot of wand seeds. She was planning on heading down to the Herbology greenhouse—there was a pretty garden of color changing roses that she wanted a closer look at. And perhaps she could run into Professor Spout and ask her if she’d ever heard of wand seed growing.
“Cupboard under the stairs. There’s a flap under the door but I can’t fit and my abilities aren’t working anymore so I’ll need help.”
It was slightly strange, having the cloak over her, dragging on the floor behind her. She had to double-check every minute that she was still completely covered, as her anxiety rose. She walked, keeping her eyes on her feet to make sure she would trip. If only she were taller…but then again, if she studied Hermione’s book, she could probably learn to make herself taller…
Professor McGonagall started to quicken—she was sweeping along without even looking at her. She had to now jog to keep up, up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, without either of them saying a thing. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Persephone trotting miserably behind her.
Cho. Cho Chang. She’d performed beautifully—when Sinistra had applauded her, Cho turned and beamed at Cedric. Cedric had beamed back and hugged her back when she launched herself at him. Cho—perfect straight hair, perfect grades, perfect flying routine…She shook her head, “No but I’d love to audition! Where can I get the form?”
Okay, bear with me. This chapter is all over the place but it sticks to the original plot with some tweeks. Also, where do you guys hope I go with the wand situation? I'd love to hear your ideas! Comment down bellow!
A lot of what was written about ancient magic was about being level with magic. Wandless, non-verbal magic is so advanced because of the respect held for the magic. The books talked about magic as if it were a living being that simply needed a heart, a soul and a mind. She understood that much—magic depended on a user’s vital force to be able to be used properly but at the same time, it was also a force more ancient than humans. It recognized when it was used with disrespect and sometimes simply didn’t work for it. It was why some wand cores were affected by its owner’s mood. Some magic need a very specific life force but it all came down to respect.
She bit her lip and started walking. Ben had survived this long without her—he would survive a night.
The egg was lying in an odd fashion on the table, cracks popping out of it. There were some deep cracks still forming as the egg popped. It was rocking back and forth, a funny clicking sound coming out of it.
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. Persephone’s mouth fell open.
“You can make it on your own from here, right?” They stopped in an empty corridor near the Fat Lady’s portrait. “Don’t forget the book.”
She lifted her head to find Gary Weasley staring at her. He looked away quickly, turning a tomato red that reached his flaming hair.
But as the water hit her and started spraying the bathroom floor, she looked to the faucet and point her palm at it, thinking of that mermaid show from Australia, and then she made a fist. It made a squeaking sound but then stopped and Persephone stared at it, cold and wet but absolutely astonished.
Quirrell snapped his fingers and suddenly, ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves around Persephone. She was bound tightly by the ropes that quickly solidified to some sort of harsh rock.
As soon as he spoke the last three words, food filled the golden plates with a large assortment of vegetables, meats and drinks. Persephone grabbed for the mashed potatoes, passing the peas to Hermione. Conversation changed to different subjects of everyone’s summers. Persephone pursed her lips, staring over at the Slytherin table, looking for a specific, irritating boy.
“You should ask him to dance,” Ron said plainly. Harry blanched at the thought, but Hermione nodded eagerly.
Harry took a moment to answer him. His ears were still stuffed with invisible cotton and his vision was still tinged with red hot panic.
“Hmm?” Draco mumbled, his translucent eyelids fluttering. “Oh. Well of course. Father wants us to marry at once, actually.”
“Good, Draco. So fucking gorgeous,” Harry mumbled almost drunkenly, and Draco couldn’t take it anymore, all he could think about was how Harry would feel inside of him, how full he’d be.
An awkward silence fell upon them. The only sounds permeating the stillness were the soft croaking of frogs and the whispering current.
Draco snorted, scrunched up his face (which made him look something like a grumpy fox) and awkwardly thrust his body into the river. Just as Harry had expected, he sunk like a stone. Harry was not so cruel as to let him suffer, so he grabbed Draco by the shoulders and pulled him up immediately. The man was surprisingly light; Harry could handle his weight without much of a problem.
“You two,” Narcissa shook her head. “You speak to each other with such malice. If I didn’t know better, I’d assume that this was a loveless marriage.”
Harry opened the gate, an  obnoxious creaking filling his ears. The brick path led to the small, wooden building complete with a cracked roof and a shrivelled garden. As soon as he walked through the door, the comforting scent of worn parchment and book polish welcomed him. Normally, Harry would escort himself over to the lore and fairy tale section, read silently on his own, and then choose his monthly book to hide beneath the rippling cushions of the Dursley's couch. This time, however, a dark-eyed, bushy-haired witch greeted him, blocking his intended path.
“Sure you can. One day you’ll be drowning and I won’t be there to save you and you’ll get yourself killed.”
Draco gasped when Harry placed a kiss against his neck, gentle but somehow dirtier than anything Draco had experienced. Harry was smiling against him, he could feel it, and damn him for being such a smug arsehole about this--
“We...we did not think a useless boy such as him was worth worrying about, surely you agree Your Highness, his magic is--”
Harry shrugged nonchalantly. “If you don't want to then that's alright. Just thought I'd like to teach you.”
Harry was more alert now, mind spinning in confusion. The living room was always freezing at night, without fail, but tonight Harry felt warm and...cozy? He hadn’t felt cozy in years.
“It’s...making a strange noise. What do I do now?” Draco asked dumbly as an obnoxiously repetitive sound blared from the device.
Ron was leaning out of what looked like a car—and actual car—parked in midair. An old turquoise car was parked outside her window and her best friend was grinning at her from inside it. And then—“George! Fred!” They were grinning at her from the front seats.
They were alone—and he was standing closer than usual. And the hammering in her chest wasn’t all due to fear, she didn’t think. She didn’t like the feeling.
“How will we know which one is the right grate?” Persephone asked nervously, her palms starting to clamp up. She started to feel her breath elevate.
“You would be a very nice ballerina,” She commented. “Hm—I think I’d like to be a fashion designer—oh, have I shown you the uniform at Beauxbatons? It’s so pretty and made out of silk!” Persephone did not blame Ben for excusing himself—Diana was overwhelmingly passionate about a dizzying amount of things that it was almost hard to keep up.
Catching herself, she jogged to keep up with him, “So…so when you said you came here because of family stuff—?”
“I—I don’t think those are birds.” Persephone said, watching them, fascinated for a moment by them. “They are…shiny.”
Hermione hesitated, “Sure…but I’ve actually always wanted to try mascara but was afraid people would call me a ‘girly girl’.” She admitted. Persephone straighten.
Persephone thought back to how Susan's face flushed when she talked about Malfoy--pretty Susan and awful Draco. She felt no remorse when she said,
"Can you see all your family standing around you?" Obviously he did, with his brothers standing behind him.
She grew warm in the face. “Look, all I know is that he’s…Spanish. I don’t know from which Spanish country—could be Latin America…or European Spain…really, I have no idea.”
“No, no I’m just…not supposed to tell,” He pursed his lips, looking very indecisive. He looked at Persephone and finally gave in, “Tickle the pear.”
Quirrell was too busy talking to himself like the lunatic he was, "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands...well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do…”
Somewhere to her right, a bird screeching, making Persephone nearly jump out of the tree. Ben reached out and caught her by the arm and she situated herself better. She caught only the last bit of Snape’s next sentence, "—your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting."
Speaking of Snape, Ron and Hermione were growing suspicious of his favoring of Persephone. They still believed that he was the one after the stone, as ridiculous as it was. They believed he was trying to lure her into a trap by making her trust him but never could explain for what reason.
It was awkward for a moment before he laughed nervously, “Persephone…like the Greek goddess of flowers…” He nodded.
“For the love of god, just admit it! You went berserk on the night of the twenty second because it was a full moon—and it was the very first time because those pills aren’t for your ADHD but for your fishy problem!” He exclaimed. “It ties in perfectly!”
They had to double back and get under the cloak once more and finally quieted down, slipping down the spiral staircase, feeling a lot lighter—Norbert gone, Malfoy in detention, her favorite person in Privet Drive a witch (!). She would look forward to the letter.
“He fancies you, poor bloke,” Fred snickered, making Ron choke, when the Diggorys dropped her off at the end of the day. She slapped his knee and he threw his arms up, “Don’t be surprised! All dance kids are inbreed.” He winked and she rolled her eyes, grimacing.
Persephone felt her heart lift—going to a party with Daphne? In the Slytherin common room? “Well—sure, I’d love to!”
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Persephone. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Persephone was forced to stay in the house all day and in the living room under strict supervision from Uncle Vernon. When in the kitchen, under aunt Petunia’s supervision.
"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. "If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.
Uncle Vernon sputtered into his drink and Persephone spoke up, “Oh, no, we’ve already decided that I would be too sad to lose my name, as it is the only thing I have of my parents,” She said quickly, earning sympathy points, no doubt.
So that’s what they did. They went all the way back to the car, carrying their trunks and the animal cages that contained Salem and Hedwig. Unfortunately, the car was locked. She pursed her lips…this car was pretty old.
Persephone woke bright and early the next morning and, unable to go to sleep, made to get herself ready. She put on the witch uniform she’d laid out last night, leaving the robes to put on once she was on the train. It reminded her slightly of a non-magical school uniform—black skirt above her knees, button up blouse and black silver lined neck-tie. She put on her normal school shoes on, a pair of shiny, pointed, black T-strap Marry Janes flats with hidden wedges—it looked normal enough. She had also put on her mother’s locket, of an actively growing flower on it…it was good Aunt Petunia had not realize it was magic, otherwise she’d have thrown it away.
She really wanted to make sure she made a good impression to the Potions teacher. He didn’t seem too happy to see her that first day during the feast and she was sure Potions would be her favorite class. She wanted her favorite class’s teacher to like her and like her he shall. Even if she were a Gryffindor. And even if his classroom was cold and creepy with pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
As soon as they were gone, everyone relaxed, moving out and away from the tight compartment. Persephone felt the cat purr in her arms, untouched by any of this drama.
She never did get to experience those unimaginable wonders because she was, to put it nicely, upset. To put it rudely, she was murderous. She’d never been angry like she was now—she felt her blood boil and she wanted to choke something.
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Persephone fell off. She got slowly and shakily to her feet—he couldn’t possibly believe she would tell him what she saw in the mirror?
She blinked. Huh. How weird. The snitch wasn’t a snitch but her glasses reflected on a pitcher of water.
“Just some observations,” He told her. She frowned. He sighed, “About you? To help you in the future?”
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Persephone made a sharp turn without wavering. A few people below were clapping.
"Ahem—just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy and the female prefect, a brown haired girl with severe acne, whose name was Audrey through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
Persephone thought about this, a really long moment, before replying, “I understand that, as girls, we need to work harder than any boys do, and because in this school, we’re from a non-magical world, you and me, which makes us need to work even harder. And I get that it may seem like I’m not struggling, but, trust me, I am.” She looked at her, “I mean, I’m famous for doing something I don’t remember or know how to do, so naturally people expect me to be brilliant and have all these expectations. And trust me, I try very hard to learn everything I can, because I don’t
Persephone considered for a moment, before getting up to examine the food on the cart while Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. She didn’t recognize anything—Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and an assortment of things that she still did not recognize. She bit her lip for a moment before picking some of everything, just to be safe, and paying the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
When several people stepped away hurriedly, she stormed passed them, dragging Fred by the front of his robes behind her towards the kitchens. George jogged after them, looking at her in complete awe, “MAaaaaate!”
Persephone winced as the idea came to her and she stepped forward, “Neville, I’m really so sorry about this, but you’ve left us no choice.” She raised her hands and concentrated on the floor he stood on. Slowly then all at once, he was knocked off his feet and she had him hover over to the couch before she pulled her wand out.
Persephone pulled at her hands nervously, “I just—how can—okay, I am, I am not qualified to be—I’ve never even played Quidditch, how can Oliver—or anyone expect I won’t mess this up? That I won’t literally lose so badly—”
The sound grew louder and she coiled up into a ball in an empty portion of a shelf, watching the happenings of below. Then, she saw it.
All over, the trip was filled with very non-magic things with a sprinkle of magic here and there but it was only after a three hour train ride to Turin on the third day early in the morning that Persephone was fully indulged in the magical roots of Italy.
Persephone piped up, “Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so—so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it—should it?” she finished, watching her anxiously.
An evil smile spread through her face as she caught sight of the most qualified candidate and she looked at Draco. She gestured for him to lean in with two fingers and he did so she could whisper in his ear. His eyes grew off and he jerked up, “No—no way.”
The rest of the time before dinner was spent watching Fred and George being chased by Percy, until Fred threw the badge to Ron and then to George. George signaled for her to climb the stairs of the girl’s dorm and then it was tossed to her, at the top of the stairs.
She led them through the warm-up barre, “Everyone space out on the bars, please, enough room to wave arms and to be able to breathe without hitting another dancer, yes, that’s good. A little here,” She came around, adjusting students here and there, and then began once again, “I’ll ask you now to face the bar, and we’re going to start with a tendu front, rotate in, and back out and flex plie, and to the side now—”
“Or a chance at all,” Ron said miserably. Persephone sighed and pulled her books out of her bag—non-magical books, mostly just science. She was going to focus on something non-magical for a while, to calm her nerves. Chemistry seemed distracting enough.
“No, I’m wasn’t,” She told him but again, he glanced at her bare feet. She blushed. “I wanted to put my feet in.” She bent to grab her socks and shoes. She’d been standing barefoot for too long and she couldn’t feel her feet.
She pulled her shoes off as she moved, unusually losing sync with her body and gaining sync with the water, while staring at the mermaid. She felt something strange charge the water, like the air that brushed her hair back was nothing she could breathe in, that she wanted so desperately to breathe in the water, how cool and delicious it looked.
The trees were so thick, she could barely make out what it was, but the path of blood became thicker leading up to the thing and there not a doubt in her mind of what she was looking at.
Now there were five gingers, all staring at the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris, which had come around the door. They stared at her, frozen, all thinking the same: Did cats see through invisibility cloaks? They did not know. Maybe she did not see them but she could probably hear them—smell them too.
