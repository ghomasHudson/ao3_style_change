“Your grandad had some pretty nasty ideas, and Mal- your dad believed them all because he was loyal. He cared about his family. Usually that’s a good thing. It was just bad luck that his dad was awful.”
. He didn’t use his wand, and Draco followed the movements of his hands with a distracted expression.
Harry remembered how smug Draco had looked, in second year, when Lucius had bought the Slytherin quidditch team Nimbus 2001s. At the time, Harry hadn’t understood: he would have been embarrassed, to have so blatantly bought his way onto the team. But now he saw that to Draco, the brooms had been proof that Lucius loved him.
The Aurors came the next day. Draco was writing in the study when the wards broke, and the alarm went, and suddenly it was like the war again, explosions and shrieks and curses streaking through the house. It did not last long. Fifteen minutes later, Draco, Tertius and Adelaide had been herded into the sitting room by the Aurors. Tertius was unconscious. Draco was immediately handcuffed. Adelaide, pale and tear-streaked, gave her deposition to an Auror with a clipboard. Potter wasn’t there. Draco had thought he would be. He couldn’t decide how he felt about his absence.
The wind was loud. They stood on the wet, unprotected platform, and Harry suddenly wondered if they had gravely misjudged. Draco was thin-lipped and pale.
“Hey,” he’d said.
She pushed her plate forward, resting her arms on the table, fiddling with her bangles. Draco suspected she had shoplifted them.
“All right. I’m not arguing with you anymore. Back off.”
at me, when you were with Neville, and I knew you wanted me, but you never—it made me feel like crap,” said Harry.
“Is that not what I said?”
“I don’t know. The film that’s on?”
“Er… a bit?”
“Thanks,” he said, taking one.
“Because you wanted to have me… er, cowering beneath you, was it?”
“Do you mind if we eat at the Gryffindor table?” asked Harry, as they walked downstairs the next morning.
It felt, to some degree, as if Draco had the right idea, in cutting them off. Nothing had changed between them since they were sixteen, clearly, when Harry had found him crying and reacted by gutting him.
,” said Draco. “How can I not
Merlin, he was going to drive Harry mad.
“I don’t want to come,” said Harry.
“How long’s he been missing?”
“Merlin,” he said shakily. “It hurts so much more when
when you’re a kitten?”
When Draco returned to the table with a pint glass of water and some chips (which, bizarrely, Madam Rosmerta had told him were on the house), Steven Hodges was sitting next to Harry.
Scorpius looked anxiously over his shoulder, to where Malfoy was hurrying out of a bookshop, scanning the crowd.
Draco undid the other strap. She kicked the shoes off and slunk into bed, yawning.
Twice, Neville came over.
“Draco. Stop being crazy.”
“Is it grammar,” mused Draco, “or syntax? I never know.”
“Connemara,” he said.
, something indescribable, unearthly, beyond human comprehension. He realised, too, that magic was not something wizards understood: because magic came from the sublime acceptance of one’s own ignorance.
“Do you like thinking of me with other people?” he asked.
“Please,” said Draco again.
“A little under four months.”
“No,” said Draco quickly.
“That’s very brave of you.”
Draco hastily put down the files he had been looking at.
“They are
“Oh, shit, yeah, good point,” Harry would say, and get up from the sofa.
“Well…” Hermione hesitated. “Draco said, about the war.”
“Harry. You were right. There must be another spy in Mysteries, and it’s up to you and me to catch him. How are you supposed to do that if you and Draco are madly professing your love for each other? But if you claim to be against him, you’ll have a chance to look around!”
“We’re in public,” she said.
“I thought we were done with this,” said Draco. “The gift thing.”
“She loved it,” he said. “It’s beautiful. It’s everything I wanted her to have.”
But the next morning, Harry still had not returned, and, as Draco’s increasingly frantic firecalls confirmed, neither had he slept over at a friend’s house.
“Well, that was irresponsible,” said Draco.
“I only—I only told Goyle,” he said.
He wasn’t always neat. Harry remembered what he looked like in bed; begging, wild-eyed.
“Are you guys hungry yet?” asked Draco. “I was going to order something in.”
“Goodnight,” said Harry.
“Dinner tonight,” he said.
“Oh, thanks
“It’s just like sixth year,” said Ron.
Harry shook his head and sat cross-legged on the long wooden table. Malfoy exclaimed.
Draco did as he was told. He had always been rather obedient, in fairness. It was not a trait that had served him well.
“He’s started to ask me about myself,” said Draco.
“Sir…” she looked shifty. “It is not good to sit in the window. You… you will be catching cold.”
“Er,” he said.
I become,” he said.
The music changed, becoming fast and anxious. Draco dragged the tips of his knife fingers over the lipstick cuts on his face and and they began to drip—it was a clever, subtle piece of magic.
“No, I’m serious,” said Harry.
“We’ll go together, yeah?”
He took it that afternoon, when the opium wore off.
“Scorpius,” said Malfoy.
“I’ll just make some up myself. How hard can it be?”
“You… you beat her?”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry.
Potter followed him to the door. He still had that troubled expression, and he put his hand on Draco’s wrist when Draco reached for the knob.
“Oh!” said Draco, smiling still, mellow and trusting, “thank you!”
“You’re not ashamed of me,” he said.
to eat them,” said Draco.
“No, it’s okay,” said Harry. “It’s sort of cathartic, actually.”
“I brought you a drink,” said Astoria, appearing as if from nowhere in front of them. She gave Draco a mug of Firewhisky and Draco broke off glaring at Harry to drain it.
“What,” said Draco.
Parvati leant forward eagerly.
Timothy sighed and sat down.
“You should drink a glass of water,” he said, after a while. “Come to the kitchen.”
Malfoy stepped away from the hospital bed and bent his pale head over the clipboard.
“I’m not complaining. She dusted behind the fridge this afternoon,” said Harry.
Potter appeared to wholly misinterpret Draco’s question. He grinned.
“Anyway,” said Draco. He put his feet in Harry’s lap and tilted his head over the side of the sofa. “It’d be good to have someone to casually have sex with.”
“He was so insistent,” said Ainsley.
Draco paused, hope flickering wearily to life in his chest. Potter came to the door. He looked so raw and hurt that for a moment Draco wanted to reach out and touch his hair again, to soothe him.
“OD’d,” she said. “He’d been sober and then relapsed, so his tolerance was low.” Her eyes grew warm with concern. “You be careful with that, yeah?”
A year after they first slept together, Harry presented Draco with a card. On the front was a drawing of the Ship of Theseus.
“You should have told me you had a boyfriend,” said Klaus.
“A yahoo question?”
“You got a
“Don’t the billionaire art dealers ever tempt you?”
“The proximity thing,” said Harry. “I forgot!”
“You’re not angry?” asked Draco.
“Money, Potter,” he said.
“Don’t,” said Draco.
There was an awkward silence.
“You’re not supposed to hit women,” said Draco, slicing into a poached egg, “so I am keeping my distance from Astoria until the urge passes.”
“What—”
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, trying not to think about telling Malfoy he was a very good boy. “So the curse was cast with malicious intent.”
“You think?”
“I don’t think you’ll feel like this forever,” said Harry.
He heard Malfoy moving about in the room, and then Malfoy’s voice, just on the other side of the door.
with him.”
“Deadly. He’s fun. And sort of wistful. I think he needs rescuing.” Draco sighed. He met up with Harry, as Lamorak, a few times a week. Harry laughed at his jokes; complimented him; confided in him. He had taken Draco’s advice and written a long list of the things that made him happy. He and Draco—Lamorak—had gone through it together, figuring out ways that Harry could incorporate joy into his life.
“No!”
Draco broke off and swallowed. Everyone had become very quiet, all of a sudden.
Harry looked at Ginny.
“Not till you’re twenty-five,” he said.
“Of course I miss him! I’m going mad—he thinks I
There was a long silence while Draco tried to think what to say. He had been furious when he saw Potter holding Adelaide, the way he was always furious about Adelaide—not only was Potter too old, but he had every societal and economic advantage, the dynamics would have rendered Adelaide essentially powerless, and Draco hated that. But there had been something else, too, some uprooting of his heart, as he watched Potter hold someone else, look at someone else, and remembered what that had been like. How worthy he had felt, for an hour. How worthless, afterwards.
Oh, right.
This made sense. Eve and Flora and Scorpius all made Malfoy feel loved, so when they reminded him that they were there, they pulled him out of himself.
“What?”
Draco leant forward confidingly. “The quotation is ‘Something is rotten in the state of
“I’ll talk to Astoria,” he said.
“How’ve you been?” asked Pansy.
“I’m sorry I’m not the right person for you to talk to, that’s all. Shall I call Ron or Hermione?”
“Oh, I’m sorry, do you
“Wow! You deserve a lil’ sumthin sumthin for that,” she said. She handed him the baggie. “Have it.”
“Very.”
“Have you been back, since sixth year?” asked Harry, as Hermione and Ron faffed about with the potion. Draco shook his head.
“You’ve never been easy, Draco,” Harry managed to say.
“Don’t be insensitive. We’d adopt.”
Things changed a little after that. Draco had decided that, to keep Harry off his back, he would volunteer harmless information about himself. Harry had as good as told him that anything relating to Draco’s mother counted as harmless, which opened up a rich vein of Draco Malfoy anecdotes. Not that he dipped very far into them. Anything he shared had to pass a fairly rigorous set of filters. Before he opened his mouth, he asked himself:
Harry took a sip of his redcurrant squash.
said Draco. Harry blinked.
“I’m touched,” said Draco.
Harry wondered what Draco thought was the reason Harry “put up with” him. Harry worried Draco thought it was sex. Which would be a weird line of reasoning, really, given that they hadn’t
“You have to help him,” said Cassie. “He’s innocent. And they had no right to attack us like that.”
“Anyone I know?” he asked.
. But Draco couldn’t face Azkaban again, and he didn’t delude himself into thinking anyone would believe him if he claimed self-defence.
“Real.”
Malfoy’s shoulder’s jerked, but he didn’t reply.
“Terrible,” said Harry.
“I don’t want a house,” said Harry, but as he said it, he glanced up, and Draco spotted it: that same wistful look he had got the first time they saw the house. When Harry had pulled Draco aside from the estate agent and said, urgently,
“What the fuck, Malfoy?”
“Fuck off,” he said, instead.
“Is the agent okay?”
“Draco,” said Harry, eventually. “This feels amazing, but I don’t think I can finish.”
“Do many people think you’re a dick?” asked Harry.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. “Scorpius. He’s starting at Hogwarts in September.”
Harry thought he understood.
“It can be quite serious,” said Ron.
“Would you mind, if he made you?”
Adelaide laughed.
“Sex makes me happy,” said Draco.
“As an earthquake. Goodnight, all,” said Blaise, and disapperated, which was both rude, and proof of his (in Harry’s opinion) sinister sobriety.
“The house didn’t approve of Sirius. Not after Great Aunt Walburga blasted him off the tapestry.”
“In a sense?” He paused. “I’m going alone.”
Malfoy had apologised to all of them, in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it sort of way.
“Congratulations,” said Harry, to the window jamb.
“It seemed like you were lonely,” said Harry, carefully. Draco made a strained sound.
“Look,” said Harry. “Just because I didn’t want you to go to Azkaban doesn’t mean I want to spend time with you.”
, Harry, anyone with eyes can see it.”
“But that’s changed,” said Harry.
“I haven’t had any dreams, since I came back,” said Potter.
He decided to act immediately.
Marcus met his eye seriously.
“But it hurts
Harry reached for his hand, and was surprised when Draco let him take it.
“He was vulnerable. I took advantage.”
“I appreciate it, professor,” said Draco, desperate to get away. McGonagall smiled at him and opened the door. Draco stopped himself from breaking out into a run as he raced towards the astronomy tower.
“You should come to our movie night,” said Scorpius.
“What did you want to tell me?” asked Michael, starting to massage Draco’s hand. Michael was clearly off his face as well.
“It just
“How about purple?”
Ron and Hermione managed all right, but they had each other. Or maybe that wasn’t it, because they were always there for him, of course. Maybe it was just that Harry was boring, when it came down to it. Maybe the most interesting thing about Harry had been that someone wanted to kill him, and now that no longer applied. Certainly that was what Malfoy seemed to think.
“No, no,” said Draco, “no, you’ll have to tell me, come upstairs with me to my bedroom and tell me—”
“I can’t fix you, Draco.”
Draco’s smile became horribly false.
“Er… I guess I’ve been worried about the same thing since I was eleven? And now I’m not. And every time I remember that it’s over, I’m filled with this, like, intense rush of gratitude… sorry, I’m rambling.”
“For what?” asked Draco, looking so genuinely confused that Harry didn’t apologise again. Draco liked looking after him. He never saw Harry as a burden. It was strange to realise that, in slow but steady jolts of understanding.
It took several times, but finally he cracked her. She had picked a subject beforehand without telling him, and when Draco stumbled upon it (eighth century dream magic) she began talking enthusiastically. It felt to Draco like eating shellfish: one had to break through the clunking armour to access the meat.
“What on earth,” said Draco. Potter shrugged, as if it was no big deal. It was so hot that if things had been different, Draco would have jumped on him and gone again. Instead, he dressed quickly, not saying a word. Potter lay naked on the sofa, watching him.
“Yes. Go back to your own bed, before everyone wakes up and thinks we’re shagging.”
“I don’t care who you sleep with, so long as you’re discreet.”
“I’m sorry,” said Draco. “You’re right. I don’t understand you at all. But I really hoped you would be happy for me. Neville
“But you are upset.”
“See you next week, then,” said Harry. Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose.
“She does
“What?” he said. His voice sounded oddly hollow. “Are you serious?”
“You made divisional head of aurors at
“I’m wasted,” he said, and left the kitchen.
“See you on Sunday,” she said.
“That you loved him back. When shall we go to Diagon Alley? Can I get a snake?”
“It’s pretty great that we’ll have privacy, even at Hogwarts,” he said.
“Thank you,” said Harry, taking it. Draco fiddled anxiously with the flower stems.
“He’s in love with me,” said Harry. “I don’t even know what to do with that.”
Sebastian put his head to one side and narrowed his eyes.
“I’m sort of seeing someone,” said Harry.
“And I’m still the person who nearly murdered you in a bathroom.”
“It’s not for me,” he said.
The page buffered, and then Malfoy was there. He looked tanned and handsome in a pale blue shirt.
He flooed into the Ministry feeling as if he was pushing a dagger into Malfoy’s back. He was desperate to get it over with, but to his dismay, the auror department was hectic and busy. Robards was too busy to see him.
“She’s fine.”
“Oh, probably,” said Draco. “Harry, let’s break up, shall we? Weasley thinks we’re a bad idea.”
Jealousy, hot and miserable, spiked in Harry’s stomach.
“He absolutely is

“You would…” said Kevin.
Harry laughed.
“That’s not true,” said Harry, into Draco’s silky hair.
Malfoy followed the train with his eyes until it was out of sight. The platform cleared (Harry was aware of several people taking pictures of him standing with Malfoy, and knew that he would be in the
“Are you sober?”
“You must hate him,” said Malfoy, after a while.
“They’re fast,” he said.
Draco breathed out heavily.
“Hogarth,” said Scorpius reverently.
“Just ignore them,” he said.
Also just wanted to say re: the bonus ep, Chesca is not someone who likes sympathy, so there's a few times when she says something appalling and I just laugh, and I'd like to stress that this is because I know her and how she likes to be treated, not because I am callous, soulless psychopath lol
tricking me. He was in disguise for perfectly legitimate reasons, and I just happened to fall for him! I’ve gone over it a thousand times. At no point did he try anything with me. I made all the moves.”
Ten minutes later he was back. He handed her double what she had asked for.
“Cassie,” said Malfoy warningly. “Don’t pry. And don’t, for the love of God, attempt to enact revenge.” Malfoy looked at Harry. “Is vengefulness a Potter trait?”
“Not really,” frowned Harry.
Harry spent all day fending off reporters. In his lunch hour, he called a press conference, where he explained that there had been a misunderstanding when Cassie was conceived, that she was definitely his, and that he was neither under the Imperius curse nor being blackmailed.
Draco grabbed his wrist.
“It was accident. I didn’t come looking for you. I wouldn’t have done that. I remember how it felt when people used to try to pry me out of Grimmauld Place.”
“No,” said Draco, but Harry didn’t believe him.
“Thank you,” said Harry. His throat felt dry.
“You breathe differently, when you’re asleep,” said Draco. He closed his eyes. “I mean,
Hermione and Ron exchanged looks.
him to have sex with him.
Blaise stared at him, wounded.
Draco took several deep breaths.
“You manipulative little pseudo-Slytherin,” said Draco. He was trying not to smile.
“Yes.”
Adelaide goes missing. Draco seeks help from the only person he can think of: Harry.
“Oh,” said Potter, sounding surprised. “Yeah. Er…” he shook off the last of the house elves and addressed the room. “Be nice to Misty, yeah? She’s a pal of mine.”
“Malfoys die with dignity,” she said. “Stop feeling sorry for yourself.”
Adelaide was quiet as they packed her bags.
Adelaide squeezed Sebastian’s hand, and his scowl lessened.
There was a picture of big wheelie bin, for instance.
“Fuck, you’re so hot.”
Draco stared at him silently, his lips tight.
“I made you tea,” said Draco.
“One more word out of you, and I’ll shut you up the only way I know how.”
“I don’t know,” said Draco. His eyes were vague. “We’ve got five minutes until lessons. I was wondering if I might have my wand?”
“Fuck you!” Draco surged to his feet. The hostility was all his, this time, fuelled by rage, not by Steven’s orders.“How
“I think I left the oven on,” said Draco, which was ridiculous, because he didn’t know how to use his oven. He would have to learn eventually, for
“Please call me Harry. And honestly, I’d like to. We’ll get your robes and go to Florian’s.”
“No,” said Draco. Harry didn’t stop stroking his hair. “It’s better.”
“It was—”
“Thank you for saying that,” said Parvati, which made Harry wonder if she was lonely, and if he should invite her over more often.
For years, Harry had very, very consciously not thought about Malfoy. Whenever Malfoy popped up in his mind—which was uncomfortably often—Harry turned away from the thought. At first, he thought he didn’t like thinking about Malfoy because he was ashamed, not only of having slept with a Death Eater, but of having
Hermione’s open expression dimmed slightly.
“Hang on,” said Zacharias Smith. Draco finally managed to stand and started picking his way towards the door, knocking over countless mugs of alcohol as he went. “Did you see me hit that bludger at you?”
“No, I… I know that,” said Draco, although it hadn’t really occurred to him. It sounded so obvious when she put it like that.
“Oh,” said Draco. He straightened up, dropping one suitcase to push his hair out of his face. He looked surprised. “Yes, I think so. Thank you.”
“Ron,” said Harry.
“Sure you want to spend your last months on this good earth with a toddler?”
“Doesn’t the floo hurt you?”
“Er,” said Harry sheepishly. “I’ve agreed to go to one of his functions in order to tacitly condone his administration?”
But Astoria was hurrying out of the great hall. Draco watched her go.
“I need you, Draco.”
It was surreal, sitting on a stoop with Harry Potter, talking about ancient Greek thought experiments, but so much about the past few years had been surreal that Draco didn’t even bother fighting it.
“Take me to the kitchens,” he said.
“Do you have any suspicions about the identity of the assailant?” asked Harry, trying to focus on his notebook, and not on Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy had his head tilted back against the kitchen wall, and his long throat bobbed when he swallowed.
“He didn’t have anyone,” said Pansy. She looked as if she was about to be sick. “He was all alone.”
asked Harry. Draco cast him an astonished look.
“I… it’s hard to explain,” said Draco.
“… and do you think this is a healthy addition to your life?” asked Draco’s therapist. His name was Kevin, and with every passing session, Draco grew more certain of his idiocy. Like now, for instance.
“—you pull it out and remind yourself of how bitterly you were betrayed by someone you loved? Yeah, I know. That’s what my idiot therapist, Kevin, would call
Harry buttered himself a fresh piece of toast.
. The safeword is
“Are you okay?” asked Harry.
“Do you want to talk now?” asked Michael. “Would that be easier?”
“It’s always been Cassie and me vs. the world,” he said, finally. “Allies, and enemies. I suspect she doesn’t know where to place you.” He brushed down his robes. “If you like me, you’re an ally. If not, you’re an enemy. But she doesn’t want you to be an enemy. So she feels conflicted.”
“Yeah. He’s amazing. Ron and Hermione came and saw a show with me the other day.”
He could hear L breathing. Harry wanted so badly to open the door and force his way in, to sweep L up in his arms.
“Your aunt and uncle,” she repeated.
“Oh,” said Draco faintly. “That’s rather good.”
He shook his head, still laughing softly, and left.
“Oh,” said Draco, exasperated, “you’re impossible to talk to.”
“Only fair,” said Harry. Draco blinked a little wildly.
“So, how was it? Are you religious now?” asked Harry.
about—how Ron still felt threatened by him, how Ron still had secret fears that Hermione might have preferred Harry, how Ron resented that Harry’s vast inheritance continued to smooth his path. Had he told all that to Malfoy?
“Your hesitation is suspect,” said Malfoy. “I think you’re ready.”
Ginny rolled her eyes.
“Just,” said Harry. He hadn’t thought this through. He never thought things through. “If someone made—a mistake. In a potion. Could they fix it.”
“It was peaceful, falling from that broom,” said Draco.
“Right, well, I won’t be home tonight,” said Harry.
“I’m happy to switch it up,” said Harry. “You top.”
“A… a drink?”
Harry laughed. He laughed so much. He was so solidly
“I doubt I’d even like Draco if you weren’t around,” said Harry. “What would we have to talk about?”
“Not to him,” said Malfoy, tapping his fingers lightly on the table.
“Erm, you don’t have to live in it, if you don’t want. It’s in Godric’s Hollow. It’s made of stone. It has roses growing up the walls.”
“She wasn’t.”
“It’s like ripping off a bandaid,” said Daphne.
“My mother—” Draco stopped himself.
“Of me, then, which to Cassie amounts to more or less the same thing.”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“You’re better looking than I thought you’d be,” he said.
Draco tossed him the notebook with his Bucket List. Harry bent over it, reading it carefully.
“You poor thing,” said Harry, holding him close. “You’re being so brave.”
“Hey,” said Harry.
“So you’ll do it?” prodded Harry.
“What did you say?”
“And that’s still not what you want,” said Draco.
Harry hurried into the auror office. Kinloch held Cassie’s arms firmly behind her back, and Spooner was handcuffing Malfoy to a radiator. Both Kinloch and Spooner’s eyes were red and streaming. Harry could smell the remains of a sort of homemade tear gas.
Harry fell asleep more easily than he had in ages.
“Because I know she forgave me. The minute I said it, she had already forgiven me. Because she loved me unconditionally.” He turned his head. She turned hers. They looked at each other for the first time since they had arrived home. “The way I love you,” said Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But will he get his memories back?” asked Hermione.
“You always tell me what book you’re going to read, as if
talking.”
“Don’t hurt yourself, Potter. I get it, you don’t want to control me.”
Draco shook his head.
Suddenly, Harry realised what Scorpius reminded him of: himself, when Aunt Marge had come to visit. Except it was obvious that Scorpius had far more self-control than Harry had had, at that age. Scorpius managed a tight smile and took a sip of water.
“There’s a fifth year girl getting badly teased. I’m in the process of… revamping her image. You’re to take her out on a long and highly visible walk on the grounds, and tell three different people loudly in the Slytherin common room that you think she’s pretty.”
“What are you doing here? Hello!”
to help Draco. What do you suggest?”
“Mate, I don’t know if that’s a good idea…”
“Cassie thinks I don’t love her,” said Harry.
When Tertius was in a good mood, he treated Draco the way Draco had always
“Teddy doesn’t exactly have much family, Andromeda. Do you really think he’s going to thank you for keeping him from the few members he has left?”
“What if I checked on your dad, now and then? Would that make you feel better?”
reckless,” said Draco, scrubbing at his spotless oven, “given how many people want me dead, you know? And Dean was just as bad. He used to go home with the thuggiest fucking men. I’m astonished he wasn’t murdered.”
He was distinctly nervous about returning to Hogwarts. Nervous enough to crack out his old diary, the one he used to keep before joining the Death Eaters. It had been too dangerous, then.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “He definitely is. What did he do this time?”
“I mean, yes? I think you’re handsomer now.”
“I got drunk and ordered a bunch of sex toys online, want to see?”
…! He took a few breaths. “I just didn’t like it, okay?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Maybe, a bit.”
“Oh,” said Draco. “Well… what do you think I deserve?”
“You know, he’s actually become much kinder,” said Draco. “All his edges worn off. It’s easier to love him.”
,” he said.
“Yes, of course,” said Healer Bussell.
Draco started putting a strand of his hair in Harry’s weekly potion, which helped, but didn’t stop Harry from waking up in the night, alone and lonely and frightened.
“Ah,” said Draco. “No. But I am an expert on the subject of guilt and innocence, and you can trust my judgment.”
“It was good,” said Harry, leaning against the door and letting his throat stretch long as his head tilted back. “It was really good,” he said, quieter. He looked at Draco, moving only his eyes. “Ship of Theseus. I like that. I think I replaced quite a few pieces, in Ireland.”
She and Draco both looked at him with incredulous expressions, but neither of them disagreed. Cassie reached out for Draco, and the three of them walked home like that, in a chain.
Harry stared at him. Draco bit his lip.
“Thank you,” said Harry.
It only happened a few nights a week, but after the first four or five times, Draco didn’t even hesitate. One night he climbed into Harry’s bed only to realise that Harry was still asleep. Draco could easily have left, then. He could have gone to the sixth floor alcove window and hoped that Misty would leave him alone long enough to give him a chance to jump.
“You’re friends?” repeated Scorpius.
“It has character,” said Draco defensively. “How did you get in?”
to me that I could matter enough to make you feel bad,” said Draco. Harry shook his head in disbelief.
“Scorpius asked that of you?” asked Malfoy carefully. “He knows better than to bother you for favours.”
“Seventeen. It wasn’t exactly planned.”
Harry didn’t say anything for almost a minute. He was trying to figure out what to say, because part of him wanted to shout for joy, but the rational, adult part—the part that knew to avoid pain—wanted to more information before it celebrated. Draco waited patiently, hunching smaller and smaller as the seconds passed, his chin on his knees, his eyes lowered.
“Yes. I think you can work your way back from here. But you’re not going to like my idea.”
Lamorak was clearly deeply uncomfortable in Grimmauld Place. He kept looking around as if he recognised the place, and then lowering his eyes quickly to his hands.
Kingsley sat behind his desk. He did not seem surprised to see them.
Harry shook his head. He had a lump in his throat. It was bizarre how jealous he was of Malfoy. Or maybe of Scorpius. He genuinely couldn’t tell which of them he envied more.
Harry had gone missing exactly a year ago. He’d simply never returned from quidditch practice. They had cycled through a million stages before this one, the funeral stage.
give off a weeping into his sort-of-ex’s bedroom in the middle of the night sort of vibe, but his voice gave him away.
Harry blinked a few times. Draco’s ears were pink, which was generally a good sign that he should change the subject.
“See,” said Draco, noticing that his fork was dirty and cleaning it on his sleeve, “no one is perfect for anyone else, are they?”
Bridget Jones.
“Ahh, the mystery unravels,” slurred Draco. “Sex. That’s what this is all about, isn’t it?”
The next morning, Draco did not come to breakfast. Cassie was reading a book of war poetry at the kitchen table when Harry came downstairs.
“No one will love you if you don’t,” said his mother.
They lay on their sides on the bed, their kisses straying lazily from each other’s mouths. Harry kissed Draco’s eyebrows, the corners of his eyes, the hollow under his ear lobe. He paused at Draco’s hairline.
and the slippery idea that had half-formed in the back of his mind would be lost. Over and over it happened, and there was no way out, for him or for Adelaide, and after a while he stopped worrying about it. There is a level of misery which makes higher thought impossible, and Draco slid easily into it, unsurprised and resigned to what adulthood meant for him.
The images disappeared. The classroom blinked back into existence.
“No,” said Draco automatically, but then he remembered. “Yes.”
“You really think I could date him?” asked Harry. “It felt as if the world would end if I tried. As if I had to pick between him and everyone else I loved.”
“Do you want to come in?”
Malfoy had been
“Don’t let Dean have it back for a few years. Until the contacts are out of date.”
“I hated visiting my father in prison. Just… please.”
“The stakes are rather high, for me,” he said.
“You’re lying to him,” said his mother.
“Why— why are you
“I’ll clear the table,” said Timothy.
“Yeah. Comes in handy,” said Harry.
“I’m not letting Blaise anywhere near my biography,” said Harry. “Go on. But skip the part about me being all… war hero-y or whatever.”
“That’s not the point!” said Timothy.
“You didn’t.”
“And because you wanted people to fear you,” said Harry.
So the real estate agent took him round the cottage, and Harry fell in love.
“Come on,” said Harry.
Draco knew
“But you said—”
“I know you’re gay,” he said.
She appeared about ten minutes later. Draco had almost fallen asleep, despite Teddy yanking at his hair.
Why not? That was, indeed, the question. The question that Hermione asked gently, and Ron asked bluntly, and Mrs Weasley avoided, and Luna Lovegood mused on— why hadn’t Harry found anything to fill his days with? Usually he made a joke and moved on, but under this small, Malfoyish eleven-year-old gaze, he felt disposed to be truthful.
, but I…”
“What happened after you got away?” asked Draco.
striking,” said Hermione.
“Let’s go back to the room,” said Harry firmly. Draco nodded and fumbled to pack his things into his bag. Harry ended up doing it for him.
Harry came back from the pub wasted.
“That’s why you want me,” he said.
“Just… hard to… do anything. Or think. Or manage.”
“What did Malfoy tell her about why you weren’t there all her life?” asked Hermione.
Harry stared at Malfoy. The only sign that he had even heard was that he was clenching his jaw.
Harry stared at the note for several seconds without understanding what he was reading, and then it set in.
“We could tell him!” said Seamus. Ron dropped his eyes. His ears went pink.
Harry stroked the kitten under the chin, and he tipped it up rapturously for Harry’s fingers.
“It’s up to you, of course.”
“Right, yes, that’s what I’m here to discuss,” said Draco, kissing his way down Harry’s neck.
“Good,” he said. “I like you that way.”
“Why not?”
“Oh, you’re
“Of course,” said Draco, “that’s good, that you’re vigilant; is she okay, they didn’t tell me…”
“Cheap date,” said Malfoy.
“Right, well, sure,” said Draco. “I let you in under my armour, too. Which I suppose suggests that in some other version of the world, we… but then, I wouldn’t be
Draco took his hand off Blaise’s back.
“No,” said Malfoy, but he sounded less confident now. “No, because… because I
“So…?”
“Lovegood!”
“The first pancake is always rubbish.”
“I’m the age my dad was when he died,” said Harry. “Twenty-one. I’ll be older than my father, next birthday. How old is your father?”
let me have this.”
“Try and stop her,” said Draco dryly.
“My father just
Draco had a long shower. Harry set the table with the fine china Kreacher was always pressuring him to use. He went outside and picked a few white English roses and put them in a small crystal vase. He made a stack of pancakes, keeping them hot with a charm, and put them on the table with the butter and syrup in their blue porcelain pitchers. The sun streamed through the kitchen window, soft and tranquil. It was a Saturday. Draco was safe.
Draco flicked her in the forehead.
Malfoy was looking at him now, with his silvery grey eyes. Would he mention Harry’s letter? Had it angered him? Had he liked it?
“I won’t ever make him choose between us, Weasley,” said Draco, leaning suddenly forward across the table. “You can treat me like shit every time we meet from here to fucking Judgment Day; I don’t care. I’ll still show up and be polite. That’s a fucking promise. Are
Draco’s shoulders were moving strangely.
At first, Harry had been annoyed by Malfoy’s relationship with Kreacher. It reminded him of how Kreacher and Narcissa Malfoy had conspired against Sirius in fifth year. But he quickly realised that Malfoy had known Kreacher all his life, and it was obvious that the wizened old elf really loved him. There probably weren’t many people left about whom that could be said. Harry stopped feeling irked by how well they got on, and started feeling sad, instead.
“No, because she’s right. I hate it, but she’s right. It’s too much angst and talk, not enough action. But I
you to talk.”
“It’s wet,” said Draco.
“Easy,” he said. “Oh, you’re lovely. Oh, I think I like you better like this. May I pet you? Is that rude?”
“Treatment. It’s important to see a mind healer.”
For a few weeks, Harry and Draco were the hot gossip of the group, with Blaise ostentatiously telling anyone who would listen that he had known all along, and Harry blushing whenever anyone asked him about it. Draco was much better at spinning the narrative. He simply told extremely graphic bdsm sex stories when anyone asked him about Harry, until everyone learnt a) not to believe a word he said and b) to avoid asking him about it. His imagination was both vivid and disturbing.

and come to the library?”
“You could get seriously rich if you published all this,” said Draco.
“Fuck,” said Harry again. Pansy rolled her eyes.
“You weren’t in love with him,” said Cassie.
“Yes,” said Scorpius. “I know.” He looked at Harry then, with wide grey eyes. “I trust you.” Harry tried to say something, but couldn’t. Scorpius hopped off his father’s lap and left the kitchen.
“What even
“I don’t mean just tonight,” said Harry. “I mean, at all. Do not misunderstand me on this.”
“That doesn’t mean you have to snog me!”
“Oh,” he said. “You’re a werewolf. God, you weren’t special enough, were you?”
They nodded.
“Let us never speak of this again,” said Draco.
Draco bit his lip and squinted at the sky, clearly trying not to break into tears.
Misty blinked at him.
dating Malfoy made him feel desperately, heart-wrenchingly lonely.
“Well, when Ham got me—”
“Stop worrying,” he told Ginny, now. “You’re Blaise’s type.”
bookshop than to
“I’m being dramatic. I apologise. I think I ought to be alone; don’t let me keep you.”
Malfoy looked rather dreamy.
“Harry… are you seeing someone?”
“Yeah. And if he’s up for it, I’ll bring him to our rooms after breakfast.”
“Just me,” said Harry.
He booked the next session in order to tell Malfoy that he wouldn’t be booking anymore sessions.
Draco stayed in St Mungo’s for a week. Hermione went back to Hogwarts, but Harry and Ginny stayed at Grimmauld Place to keep him company. Ginny spent the nights with him.
“A good egg,” he repeated.
“Come here,” he said, and she obediently let him scoop her into a hug. She wasn’t stiff, the way she usually was. She wrapped her arms quickly around him and clung tight.
“That didn’t kill him. The Dark Lord did.”
It was funny, that after all that had passed between them, it was
“You’re hurting her, Kinloch,” said Harry. Kinloch loosened his grip on Cassie, who instantly broke free and rushed to Malfoy.
“No,” he said, and something heavy settled in his chest.
“I think it’s a great idea,” chimed in Cassie. “Can we go to Verdun? I’d like to see the German trenches.”
“Harry, no one else had both access to the case files and a motive,” said Hermione, as Draco was dragged towards the demolished floo. He still only had eyes for Harry, wide, wild, supplicating grey eyes. His hair was all dishevelled from sex. Harry had kissed him in this very kitchen less than an hour ago.
Harry ran his hand through his hair.
“He’s not nice to anyone! He’s not
So Draco brought over his laptop and showed Harry his Myspace profile and they didn’t talk about Dean again.
Once Draco had gone through, Harry took a few deep breaths. The green light had made his heart rate spike. He calmed himself down, took a handful of floo powder, and managed not to flinch at the green light that followed his words.
“Hang on, stop,” he said. Potter pulled back instantly, eyes blown wide.
Draco gave another jerky laugh.
“Sit,” he said, and pushed her into a chair. “I’m making you food.”
your friends,” said Harry. “And I earn about 90 times more than you. When you make more money, I’ll happily charge you rent. You’re a student, you should get free rent, really.”
“I’m feeling for a head injury. I’m sure you’ve got one,” said Draco.
Harry thought of Draco getting out of prison and falling straight into Croome’s clutches. He thought of Timothy, and of Erica, who came to the store, and taught Timothy about gaslighting. He thought of how complicated love was, once it had been used against you, and how Draco deserved something simple.
“Than
“No,” said Harry. “I like you better, on MDMA. Maybe you’ll tell me all your secrets.”
He had come out to his father in the Christmas holidays in sixth year, just when he was beginning to understand what dirty fucking swindle he had fallen victim to when he joined the Death Eaters. He went to his father’s study, determined to be reckless.
killed anyone, and anyway, it was just a stupid dream. But Harry’s heart pounded as if he had just really seen someone murdered. His whole body was cold with sweat. He pressed his hands to his head, almost wishing his scar would hurt so the pain would focus him.
“I read that sometimes, people hit their heads, and then they’re fine for like a week, but then suddenly they just
Yet, after all, his denial proved true. Harry had been gone for a year and a half when a panicked underling burst into the operating room. Draco was in the process of removing a teapot that had grown arms and wrapped itself firmly around a small boy’s head.
“Listen, I’m starved,” he said. “Can you cook?”
“I’m sorry. You don’t deserve this.”
“I think you need to write down all the things that make you happy— little things, like mint tea in the summer, or roof gardens, and big things, like spending time with family—oh, I’m sorry.”
Malfoy frowned and placed his glass on the side table. He stared at it very hard, licked his finger, then began to make the crystal sing, running his index along the rim. He glanced at Harry.
, he thought. He was there because Potter missed sleeping in a tent with Ron and Hermione. He was there because Potter had shit to work through, and Draco was available. He was there for all sorts of mysterious, incomprehensible reasons, none of which suggested that Draco was actually important to him.
“I can’t,” said Malfoy.
Lamorak took a pensive sip of coffee.
“You’re clever,” he said. “It’s a pity you fucked up your life so badly.”
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. They had scarcely talked since the era when they had fought on opposite sides of a war. But Draco had looked after him when he was vulnerable. Draco had fallen in love with someone Harry knew to be decent and kind. Draco had read hundreds of Harry’s letters and never once used them against him.
Astoria let go of his face and returned to her toast.
Malfoy nodded and ripped over the envelope. His eyes scanned the letter.
“Draco, he’s your
“But you liked me?”
Potter sighed and rubbed his scar.
Draco shook his head and stopped talking. His breathing was strange.
“I’m fine,” answered Harry automatically.
“Thank you, Hermione. For testifying for me.”
Harry laughed and kissed him. It was such a nice, friendly kiss.
“How was your wanky Slytherin party for twats?” asked Ron.
-----
“You must be gay,” she said. “Everyone wants to fuck me.”
“I don’t— I don’t know if I will,” said Draco.
Pansy had the nerve to actually pout.
“Just let me touch your Mark,” said Harry irritably. Goyle held his arm closer, looking strained. Harry suspected that was his thinking face.
“I have to go,” said Draco. “I’ll be late picking her up.”
“Yes?”
“I guess it hasn’t come up.”
They were walking over to collect Draco from Arithmancy. It was one of the few times when Harry could discuss him behind his back.
“Hair,” said Draco.
“I don’t understand when she’s even had time to see him,” said Draco. “She’s been so busy with cooking club.”
“‘Yet’?” asked Draco.
Ron laughed.
“What d’you reckon he deserves?” asked Harry, swirling his fresh glass of firewhisky.
“It’s magical, isn’t it?” asked Draco, eager, eyes shining. “It’s just like magic.”
Draco glanced at him. He looked as if he might say something, and then the chips arrived.
Draco’s hands grew still as Harry talked. He winced from time to time.
Harry was working on a piece of werewolf legislation when Roseveare came into his office.
Blaise looked pained.
“It’s really hard, okay? Imperatives are an important part of our language!”
“I don’t really believe in good and evil,” said Harry. “Not since Snape. Are you all right? Did you hit your head?”
“All right. What I’m trying to get at is that it didn’t help the… the wanting to kiss you thing. Which was a particularly dangerous crush to have in that household, with all the bloody legilimency that went on. And then you went and
when Harry touched him in anger. Harry knew quite well that in school, before he had been bitten, Malfoy would have fought back. He hadn’t ever scared Malfoy, at school—even after Sectumsempra, Malfoy had regarded him only with loathing, never fear. It was very clear what had changed: Harry. Newly bitten, newly dangerous.
“You’re a very embarrassing boyfriend, aren’t you?” asked Pansy, although she seemed pleased.
“Very,” said Ginny.
“Anyway,” said Draco. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Draco looked at him with an unreadable expression.
“Straight boy who had a confusing wet dream?”
Harry lay curled around Draco, his head on Draco’s chest, almost asleep. They had had sex twice, and he was so happy and tired that he almost couldn’t stand it.
“All the time,” said Harry.
,” said Harry darkly, and Draco laughed and kissed him. Harry hadn’t been sleeping well, hadn’t been functioning in general, but Draco still made him laugh almost every day.
“Yes,” said Draco. He turned to look at Astoria, who looked perfectly calm and composed. “Fuck you.”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger.
“I—you just said you didn’t want…?” said Draco.
“Yes. Take him, and shower him with affection, and maybe people will think of you instead of me when they call his name to be Sorted. Oh God, if he’s a Slytherin…”
“Hey,” said Harry. “Sorry to disturb you. I was wondering if you remembered a guy who was here the other day? Blond, slim, sort of… over-the-top posh?”
too old to be read to,” she said, looking deeply insulted.
“Yes,” said Harry, and pulled Draco onto the bed with him. “Fuck, I love touching you.”
“It only counts if he feels remorse, Harry.”
“I knew, anyway,” said Harry.
Draco dropped his eyes.
“We can’t be casual, Draco,” said Harry. “You do know that?”
Draco pushed his fists further into his coat pockets.
Harry nodded, but couldn’t answer.
“Winderly’s been on fire this season,” said Ron.
“You’re hopeless. I’ll help you.”
“There’s some pain potion in the bathroom?”
The point was that Draco was gorgeous, popular, rich and successful. Harry was spent. Draco was an ascendent power, and Harry a waning one. He did not delude himself into thinking they were equals. They had never been equals. Immediately after the war, Draco had been nothing, and Harry had been the single most famous person in Britain. Now, photographers followed Draco on the street. Harry, meanwhile, was spoken about in the same bored and respectful tones as the Minister for Finance.
But they carried on talking all the way through—
Hermione healed the sting on Draco’s cheek without another word.
“Harry!” said Blaise, opening the door of his extravagant townhouse with a crocodile smile. “Are we to be best of friends again?”
“Draco!” cried Dean, springing forward to hug him. “Draco! I
“What NEWTS are you doing?”
L shook his head.
“Right,” he said. “So—”
“What’s Tuesday?” asked Harry. Hermione flushed red.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, just. You know. Mistreated as a child.”
“I never thought it was fair, that you were so good looking,” said Draco. Harry laughed incredulously, and when he opened his eyes, Draco was smiling.
Hermione still had that awful, pitying look. Far from convincing him, it made him think of another reason to trust Draco.
He stopped talking.
Potter blinked a few times.
“What do you mean? Are you claiming Harry Potter broke your wand and exiled you?”
Malfoy hadn’t moved an inch since he came in. He stood by the door, motionless.
Draco gave him a look that Harry might almost have called fond.
“Harry,” said Draco.
Malfoy laughed.
“I can’t do this anymore,” he said.
“No,” said Harry firmly. “I’ll do it.”
“We’ll fix it, Draco. You’re not dying. You’re twenty-two.”
“You should see the way they look at each other,” Cassie told Harry, reminding him inexorably of Peeves the Poltergeist.
To his relief, the secretary took him at his word, and ushered him into Kingsley’s office.
“Would you want to?” asked Hermione.
“K,” said Malfoy, his voice soft and abruptly near. His hand was lightly shaking Harry’s shoulder. “K, you have to go. K.”
“No one will be alive who remembers my childhood,” said Greg.
“We still don’t know if he
After Neville’s party, Harry started seeing Draco more often. It was as if a seal had been broken, and all their friends stopped bothering to keep them apart.
“There are different forms of power,” said Draco. “Different ways of being wanted. Do you even want to be The Chosen One all your life?”
“Anyway. I just wanted to explain myself.”
“Are you
The next time Draco came over, Harry had stocked his pantry full of a variety of non-alcoholic drinks.
The next day, Harry came over to Draco’s to watch a film with him and Adelaide.
“Shhh,” said Draco, tying up her dangling arm into a sling. “There. He’ll fix it when he gets back, won’t he?”
“Why won’t you tell me?”
He woke up to a familiar sound: Draco gasping himself awake. He did this a few times a week. Harry waited and listened. He heard Draco lie still for a minute, then get out of bed and slip out of the dormitory.
“He wasn’t being—that’s just how he and I are, Hermione.”
“Sorry. Have you any special skills?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
Even though you were in love in school?”
Draco licked her face, Mirth shrieked, and it wasn’t until an hour later that he noticed he had barely thought about dying all afternoon.
“Would anyone like some tea?” asked Harry.
“Yeah, well, I’m not in a place for a bit fun, right now.”
Harry thought about challenging Blaise—
“I pushed him into everything,” said Malfoy. “I pressured him to become a Death Eater. If I’m innocent, he is too.”
“He wasn’t a twat. That was why it was so horrible,” she said.
“Yeah. Three years.”
“He’s not wanking,” said Harry.
“I know. Fuck. I know.”
“Maybe I’ll go mad,” he said to his reflection in the mirror. It was a rather appealing prospect. He envisioned himself wearing… oh, silk dressing gowns and elaborate hats. Smoking a pipe. He’d collar children in parks and frighten them with nonsensical aphorisms, and never think about anything at all.
“If I talk about it? Sometimes? Like, if it comes up?”
“You don’t understand,” he said.
“Firstly, yes, he is, and secondly, that’s irrelevant, because Scorpius isn’t his father.”
Draco didn’t move. His therapist had told him that when Adelaide pushed him away he shouldn’t let her. But it was hard, because her words had twisted under his ribs.
“Mother, please…I’m sorry… of course it’s been the worst year,” said Draco.
The music built, and suddenly, one of those long, knifelike fingers ripped its way through the silk. It widened the tear, more and more fingers appearing, and Harry realised that they really were knives, long, thin knives that had somehow been attached to smooth grey gloves, and then the creature tore free of the silk.
Blaise’s flat was the most archetypal bachelor pad imaginable. Blaise himself was staring out of his enormous glass windows when they arrived.
“Hang on,” said Harry. “What did
Harry grinned.
Then he would think of Scorpius’ pitiful letter, of the men who had left Malfoy for dead last spring, and something in his rib cage would clench painfully.
Draco didn’t realise it was Potter’s house until he was standing on the doorstep, ringing the bell. He didn’t have time to do more than think
Harry wasn’t sure why he did it. It certainly wasn’t something he had planned on doing. But he reached up behind his head, took Draco’s hand, and squeezed it.
“Trust me,” said Pansy, and, as it turned out, she was right.
“Don’t be boring, Pans.”
Harry sighed and sat next to him.
But then he thought of that apology. They had barely spoken since then. There had been something rather fragile about Draco, that night; something delicate about his brittle jokes and swift glances.
jumpy,” said Draco. Harry squeezed him tighter, as if to remind Draco that he wasn’t answering the question properly. Draco sighed. “I’m not jumpy, right now. I don’t want to die.”
“Crushing regret?”
“She’s my best friend, you see.”
“Really?” Malfoy put the books down and started looking at their prices. He had obviously never had to do that, before. Harry suddenly wished he had said Malfoy’s allowance was slightly more. He’d only be able to afford one book out of his stack, if he wanted to get clothes as well.
Ron frowned at his drink.
“The only reason you’re not in prison is because of Harry Potter’s goodness,” said the man; and Draco had to agree with him, although he wasn’t sure that it was relevant.
“Can’t tell you,” said Draco. “You’re not seventeen yet.”
Lamorak looked puzzled.
Draco tossed and turned. Occasionally he would open his eyes, stare at Harry, and say, “Pansy?”
“Wizard prison,” said Eve.
“Don’t,” said Draco.
have understood the premise, because if you did, you’d be coming to Draco and Neville’s viewing party,” said Dean.
“Toast?”
Harry put his head in his hands.
“I didn't say he was my friend.”
“You’ve had a lot of experience healing your own wounds, haven’t you, Draco?” she asked, her voice thick with sorrow. Harry could feel sympathy building in him as surely as if Astoria were casting a spell. But to his surprise, Draco seemed entirely unmoved.
“Yeah. Hi, Harry, take care of him, will you?”
“I don’t want to leave you,” he said.
“All right. Let’s ditch these losers.”
“Um,” said Harry.
“Potter. Chill out,” said Draco, knocking gently into his side.
“I actually came here because I’ve, er, been hanging out with Draco,” said Harry, when she was gone.
“How about we leave each other alone, Smith, yeah?” he said. He scanned the list, saw his name (just above Harry’s), muttered “Oh,
“That’s because you were at nerdy wizard school,” said Adelaide. Their social worker had advised against sending Adelaide to Hogwarts. Said she would stand out too much as a new fourth year student, particularly one who had been through as much as Adelaide had. So Adelaide went to a Muggle state school, and Draco tutored her in the evenings, convinced he was failing her.
“Do you think Etta knows?” Harry asked Draco. Draco hadn’t answered right away. They had been in bed, quiet and close.
Timothy pulled the covers up to his chin. Harry wished he would leave, then hated himself for being so callous.
"They're honourable. I swear."
Draco suddenly cringed.
“Ciao!”
“This spell is ridiculous,” said Draco.
“Yes, all right. Although I’m warning you, he’s going to hex me.”
“How you going to die, then?”
“Hi,” he said distractedly to Ron, not seeming to register that it was Ron he was talking to, “I was contacted about Adelaide Lovell, I’m her guardian, is she okay?”
. There was a way his life was supposed to go, and he had fucked it up in every possible way. This wasn’t how things were
“No! You were already in the Knutters—”
“Sorry,” said Draco, the instant they arrived. He wouldn’t look at Harry. “Didn’t mean to, to, er, to cockblock you. Sorry. The glass just slipped. I’m sorry.”
“Where’s Draco?”
2. No, I don’t miss them -
“We were all so worried,” said Nick. Draco turned to look at him, and his expression immediately went blank again.
“Yeah, I mean, I’m dead proud of him, he’s been smashing it at his new job,” said Harry. Timothy was working at Ollivanders as a shop assistant. It turned out that he knew a freakish amount about wand cores, as that had been one of the ancient,
“No.”
“You were right,” said Hermione. She looked a little shaken. “He really does love you.”
“I don’t know, I’m sure there are cases where people with a history like that could work,” said Harry.
Harry was very glad to have Blaise with him, the morning of Draco’s trial. Blaise burst into Pansy’s house like the magician from
“He must have another stronghold,” said Bianca. “Harry, I know you don’t like to use your connections at Mysteries, but…”
“I’m just tired and trying to compose aphorisms. It’s a bad combination.”
Which, of course, he was.
Draco chose that moment to come into the common room. Zacharias Smith went puffing up to him, guns a-blazing.
“I’m sorry you’ve had a shit day,” he said. “It will get better. I promise.”
“You are
They were standing right next to each other. Harry turned to face him and put his hand on Draco’s forehead to feel his temperature.
“You admitted, on veritaserum, that you want to kill yourself,” said Hermione.
“Pizzas on me,” he said.
Harry told Draco every one of his cringing memories, and Draco laughed at each one in turn. They vanished, boggart-like, at the sound of his laughter.
“I’d love to,” said Draco. Next to him, Sebastian was putting his number into Adelaide’s phone.
“But sometimes you have to be,” said Michael.
“Clarence,” said Draco. “Shopping for… artichokes?”
“Ha.”
“Surprising, isn’t it?” she said. “Cassie! Your dad’s here!”
“Her name’s Narcissa? She sent you a parcel full of chocolate last week?”
“Talking about quidditch is better than sex,” said Harry.
“Oh! I wasn’t thinking…!” she said. “Draco, I’m so sorry…!”
Draco cast a warming charm on both of them.
The week in which Pansy stayed at his house passed in a haze of red wine and weeping.
“Of course I like him. Fascinating chap. Always talking about plants.”
her. Today, I saw her—” Suddenly his eyes went round. “Oh,” he said, softly.
“…so…” said Draco, after about fifteen minutes, because he sensed he was talking in circles. “So you see, it’s—I know, I can
Draco let his head roll to the side to look at him.
Malfoy felt around in his pocket and withdrew the potion bottle, handed it to Harry.
Etta von Ranke beamed at the photographers. Next to her, Blaise’s smile was brittle and false.
want to be my boyfriend,” said Harry.
“What if Draco’s different when he comes out?”
Harry nodded. Draco paused by the door, his hand on the lintel.
” said Blaise. “Yes, that will go over well. No, like it or not, Draco’s fucked. You might be able to save Cassie by association, but Draco is going to spend the rest of his life poor as a churchmouse, doing a job he hates, knowing that everyone in the Wizarding world wishes he were dead. So you owe him.”
Draco sighed.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” said Harry.
Cassie gave him a long, cool look that made him feel about three inches tall. Her eyes were really quite a brilliant green.
“Sorry,” said Marcus.
“And these are for you,” he said, passing the flowers to Hermione.
They had almost got into a fist fight the last time they were in Flourish and Blotts together. Harry knew they were both thinking of it, when they stepped inside.
“But is Draco okay?” asked Flora again.
“I wake up all restless in the night,” he told Draco, in one of their stolen hours.
to explain to them, Potter. They won’t listen. Maybe you’ll have better luck.”
“Oh, don’t be so selfish. I was going mad, grieving all on my own.”
“In a bit,” said Draco. “I’m just, uh, I’m just going to go home. To the house. You keep him. And when he wants to talk, I’ll be there. There’s no rush.”
At St Mungo’s, they prodded and poked Draco to within an inch of his life. They healed all his surface wounds, but the spell damage was more complicated. They dosed him up with potions and put him to bed. Harry stayed by his side through it all, talking about quidditch with false gaiety.
“Yeah, nice try, mate,” said Mark roughly. “Still not as good as the one about the magic wand fight in the bathroom.”
“It’s fun!”
Pansy laughed.
“Remember that thing she told you, about distracting yourself from existential moral terror? Rather than ruminating?”

Draco blinked up at the ceiling.
“You’ve really got your shit together,” she said.
He was aware that it was a little weird. It was why he didn’t mention it to Mirth and Astoria. He knew he was being a creep. Potter would have been horrified if he knew how it titillated Draco to sleep in the same bed as him. The only reason Draco didn’t stop was that it felt so warm. You never got
That night, Harry watched fondly as Draco wrestled their spoiled, ridiculous cat to the ground in an attempt to trim his claws.
Andromeda smiled fondly.
Draco fiddled with the buttons of his shirt.
“Don’t want to attract bears,” she said.
“Yeah, well, Hermione said he’s not a massive twat anymore, so I thought…”
"Oh, uh, yeah."
me,” said Potter, grabbing Draco’s wrists, and terror surged up in Draco, metallic and paralysing. Tertius had taken his wrists like that, had dragged him, screaming, to the kitchen door, had—
“If you still want me,” added Draco. He blinked, strange and fluttering, as if there was rain on his eyelashes. “Do you?”
“Recently,” said Draco, under his breath.
Everyone seemed delighted to see him. Robards took him aside and gave him a little speech about how Harry could come back anytime, he knew that, didn’t he? He just had to say the word. Ron lounged around in doorways, grinning, bright-eyed.
“Paper ripping?”
“No more than everyone else, apparently,” said Harry, feeling abruptly hopeless. He had literally no reason to believe that Draco viewed him as anything but a painful reminder of his harrowing past. “Look, can we not talk about it anymore?”
spoken like an insult. In school, Draco would have responded to anger with anger. But his brain had been recalibrated in the past few years, by Voldemort, by Tertius. He felt the flooding terror of having angered someone and not knowing what he had done: only that he would be punished for it.
“That’s so often the case,” she said.
“Harry?” asked Hermione. “Are you okay?”
“That’s what you meant,” he said. “About us being like the Marauders.”
“Can I have a word?” Harry asked Draco. Draco straightened up, ruffled Teddy’s hair, and walked out of the room. Harry followed him down the corridor. When they were out of earshot, Draco turned to face Harry.
“Well, I’ll be back soon,” she said.
“Have you even ever slept with anyone else?” she asked. Draco made a heartbroken laughing sound.
“I’m quite good at this,” reflected Steven.
Harry summoned his laptop. He tried not to show how affected he was by Draco curling up closely to him on the sofa as Harry pulled up the geography quiz.
Harry paused before answering. They hadn’t
“I think he was joking,” said Harry.
“Will you be all right?” asked Harry.
“You,” said Draco. “Just you.”
Hermione came tumbling out of the hearth, Draco Malfoy draped over her, grinning from ear to ear.
“You’re in a right mood tonight,” said Harry.
“I don’t—I want him to go down,” he managed.
Tertius saw the Muggle price sticker on the bananas and was even angrier than if Draco hadn’t brought them back at all. He smashed his fist into the kitchen cabinets, bloodying his knuckles, and then brandished his bleeding hand at Draco.
“Draco needs to stay with you while you figure this out, Harry,” said Hermione.
“Potter,” said Draco, turning around. “You fucking idiot. No.”
“Okay,” whispered Harry.
“Ten.”
“You know that’s fucked up, right, Draco?” asked Harry, pausing in his furious pacing.
“I have something to tell you,” said Malfoy, lurching to his feet. He had to hold onto the wall to stay upright.
Harry paused, trying to imagine Malfoy in some sort of Hugh Grant-esque bookshop, recommending novels to muggles. It was unthinkable.
“Oh… Scorpius… I didn’t mean…” Harry sighed. “Does anyone ever tell you nice things about your dad?”
shag him,” said Draco. “In the flat.”
He thought of the way Scorpius’ eyes lit up when he called Malfoy brave, as if he had said something magical.
The fact was, Harry
“It gives me context, when you tell me about your version of the story,” said Draco. “It helps me see all the places I went wrong.”
Cassie smiled shyly and tucked her hair behind her ear.
“What’s the capital of Montenegro?” he asked, to make Draco smile. And Draco did indeed smile, although he looked puzzled.
“And Adelaide hasn’t had another relapse, so that’s a weight off my mind,” said Draco, conclusively. “I suppose, between all that, my outlook has—”
Harry smiled.
“Are you real?” he asked her.
Harry threw the velvet box at Draco, who plucked it neatly out of the air.
Tertius had hated it when Draco flinched. It always made his anger more violent, so Draco and Adelaide had both learned not to, to hold very still when frightened, and take the blows.
“Nice piece about you in Witch Weekly,” he said. “About you and Marcia Snicket.”
“Do you think he inherited that country manor? I never asked,” said Draco.
“No. You were right. I asked if you thought I should never be forgiven, and you said you shouldn’t have to forgive me. And that’s… about right, I think.”
Draco shrugged.

“It’s for you, really. Got to have a plan, so that you don’t go mad.”
Harry was sad.
“There isn’t
“All right,” he said.
with him.
When Draco tried to return the favour, Harry looked sheepish.
“Don’t say peacock,” said Potter.
“Greg,” said Draco, struggling to sit up. “Stay.”
Harry tilted his head up to look at Draco.
“There’s no shame in—”
“Honestly, Scarhead, do you even read the paper?”

“Misty,” he said. It was past three in the morning, and Draco wished he were dead.
The light was still on in Draco’s room when Harry slipped the letter under his door. Harry lay awake for hours, but no response came, and finally he fell asleep.
“Which side were you for?” he gasped. “In the war?”
“She’s gorgeous.”
“And he lives among muggles now, does he?”
“I should really get going,” said Harry.
Dean Thomas. He refused to come to pub nights, now. Harry missed him. Ron said he would come around. Harry couldn’t separate his long-held fondness for Seamus from the pain it caused Draco to think of him.)
Draco took a few steadying breaths and opened his eyes.
“Teddy! Sweetheart! What’s wrong?”
Draco’s flat was dark. It was two in the morning. Draco was asleep. Clarence was probably in bed with him.
“No, I don’t dye my hair,” said Draco. “Yes, my tongue piercing does make blow jobs better.”
“You’re doing all right,” said Draco, with a kind smile. It was shocking and wonderful that it didn’t look out of place. That Draco had grown up to be someone kindness suited, that Harry had been allowed to witness the change.
“Stop,” said Draco, but he was smiling. “
Harry moved slowly, as though she were wild and he wanted to tame her.
“He hated it.”
“That’s not fair, it’ll be all muggle stuff,” said Ron. “Luna and I will be rubbish.”
he thought.
“How much?”
“Sorry. Well, in fairness, it’s quite a toxic message, really. Also, is unperfect a word? I don’t think it is. Shouldn’t it be imperfect?”
He had intended not to reach out to her until he had the energy to write her a proper letter of apology, but there wasn’t time for that now. He wanted to find out what was going on with Malfoy right away.
“Do you?
Draco stood straight as a rail in the centre of the room. Harry hovered by the door.
“I’m sorry, too,” he said gruffly. “About… do you want me to list it all?”
Malfoy, to his credit, mastered his expression almost immediately.
we were friends,
“You can go,” she told him. “But I would never abandon your father.”
Harry held her gaze.
“Don’t like flooing,” said Harry. Draco waited. He was good at that; knowing when there was more. “The green light.”
“It’s good of you to take pity on a Death Eater child,” said Florian, in a carrying undertone. Harry could feel the blush spreading up his face, could see the way Scorpius had become impassive and straight-backed, like a tiny marble statue.
“Well, night, love you,” said Harry. He realised what he’d said a split second after it had left his mouth. Draco’s eyes widened, and Harry fled.
“Yeah,” said Harry. He leant back into his pillows. He hadn’t talked about Cedric in a long time. There had been so many fresher, closer tragedies to process. But it felt good to talk about him. Like exploring a wound in his mouth with his tongue. “He wanted me to take the cup by myself. Said I’d won it. I insisted we take it together.”
“These… suggestions Mr. Croome made,” said Harry. “Do you reckon Draco Malfoy would have taken him up on them?”

“You giving me a chance.”
, you don’t want that git in your house.”
“I’m going to fuck you,” he said.
Misty seemed to take in the damage of library for the first time.
“Everything?”
“What?” asked Harry.
“I’ve missed you like mad,” said Draco, and then Harry was speaking over him,

“Then I’ll have to kill you,” said Draco, seriously.
“I know what you’re thinking, and it’s not like that,” said Timothy. “I don’t know what you think you saw, but he’s never forced—I’m very
“Yes,” said Draco.
“It is.”
Draco put his face in his hands.

“Hmm,” said Draco. “What did you call him in return?”
Harry shrugged.
Draco shook his head sorrowfully.
“You’re not an evil Death Eater,” said Harry.
“George would
“I didn’t think you didn’t,” said Harry.
“Too many plants,” said Pansy. “How did you get on with Teddy?”
“February, Harry.
“How come you’re sober?” asked Harry, trotting to keep up with him. “Aren’t you always on drugs?”
“Cool,” said Harry, smiling into Draco’s mouth. “Makes sense. How long until we can fuck, again?”
“Sort of? It’s more of a feeling. And some speculation,” said Harry. The waiter brought another basket of breadsticks. “Thanks,” said Harry unhappily, taking a breadstick with a look of near-defeat.
“It’s… it’s about my father,” he said.
“It’s not a fucking scratch!” said Draco.
it felt to be around people. Harry flew around the indoor quidditch pitch his house had provided for him, and felt his loneliness like an injury.
“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe not. I’m perfectly happy to sleep with both of you.”
“How long do we have?” asked Dean.
“Aw, yeah, that was Hugo’s problem, too,” said Ursula. “Posh git. You know he once asked me why I still kept my Nan around?
Harry wished, more than anything, that he could go find Draco and hold him.
“What
“I don’t know why you’re making such a big deal out of your favourite colour, Malfoy,” he said. “Honestly, you act like you’re hiding state secrets. It’s very dramatic.”
“A bird animagus. I didn’t specify what type of bird. But you can decide that later.”
“I meant it,” he breathed. “You can fuck me if you need. If you want.”
and sometimes longer and more rambling (
“You’re cross because I didn’t share; I’m sorry, darling, I’ll get Dean to give you some—”
“Feels that way.”
Potter laughed.
“What a tragedy,” murmured Draco. “Have you been drinking?”
“Draco, wait,” said Harry, belatedly regaining the use of his faculties. Draco turned jerkily on his heel and fled into the driving rain.
“Dear God,” said Draco. “You actually mean to go through with this.”
Harry couldn’t answer him, when he did that. It felt too wrong to correct him with a name that wasn’t his own.
“Should I just ask him out?” Harry asked Pansy. They walked down a shaded path by Regent's Canal in Kings Cross. Pansy was sober. She had been sober a lot more, lately.
“Is everything all right with you and Malfoy?” asked Hermione, looking concerned.
“Whatever you want,” said Draco. Everything was surreal, as if he had already fallen asleep.
“I’m scared too,” said Harry.
“Er,” said Harry.
“It’s good thinking,” said Astoria, staring intently into space.
“I’ve told them a lot about you,” said Harry. “They’re not expecting you to come in all,
“Yeah, yeah, that’s right!”
“Teddy will look after him.”
“No,” said Harry. “Go on. I want to understand.”
Harry thought it best to distract him from this train of thought.
“Lightweight,” said Draco.
“I am pretty experienced,” said Harry. “I’ve been with a lot of people—”
“I just wish I hadn’t fucked up my life so badly. I feel so
Draco hastened to Harry’s side in Transfigurations.
“Shut up, shut up, you’ll lose him!” shouted his mother.
“You were wrong, you know,” said Harry. “When you spoke to
“Dad,” said Scorpius. “Dad—”
Out of sight of the camera, Seamus reached out and poked him in the leg. Harry yelped.
He was quite right. Narcissa was so hospitable it was almost uncomfortable. She took Harry’s jacket. She had made sandwiches with the crusts cut off—herself, because it seemed that part of Draco’s arrangement with his parents was that they couldn’t use house elves when his friends came over. She had found out Harry’s favourite bakery and bought a selection of cakes, and she used the formal family china. She smiled at him and asked him gentle questions and told him repeatedly to have more cake. It was like having tea with a very polite, expensive Molly Weasley.
. I know he turned out not to be fully evil, but he’s still a prick.”
“Oh,” said Harry. Astoria came gracefully to Draco’s side.
“That’s a new one,” he said. “Why?”
“What?” asked Harry.
Around midmorning, Draco staggered to the bathroom. There was an IV drip there. The muggle healers had told him to leave it in, but he couldn’t stand it, so he unhooked the tube from his arm most of the time, and reconnected it only when the pain became unsustainable. There was a piece of plastic in the crook of his left elbow that made it simple enough, and he understood the dosage. It wasn’t all that different from potions.
“It helped you,” said Malfoy. “You said it made everything easier. Cleared your head. I don’t know, I just thought… it might help.”
“You should go for it,” said Hermione.
“Anytime,” said Draco.
“Yeah?” said Draco.
“I don’t use coasters.”
Timothy wiped at his eye with the inside of his wrist. There was a small carpet bag on the floor beside him, and nothing else.
Draco nodded slowly.
“False alarm,” said Nancy, although she was still holding onto Draco’s arm, as though she thought he would make a run for it if she let go.
“Cass, take your father’s hand,” he told her. “He’s had a tough day.”
Harry felt, childishly, as if the lilies were
At eight p.m., Narcissa arrived. Everyone got out of the bed except for Draco, so that Narcissa could reach to embrace him.
“We got off,” said Draco. “He was horny, I think. And, I don’t know, drunk, maybe.”
to talk to him, do you?”
“Hello Cassie! I didn’t expect you to come,” said Harry.
“Don’t—don’t be boring about it, Pans.”
“You lot are all so bloody dramatic. I’m fine.”
“Sorry, sorry,” said Ron, and mimed zipping his lips.
Things got better slowly. They always did, which was one of the reasons Harry felt so stupid for letting it get to him, when he
“Oh, so I should go back to him, should I? Try harder? Do you know how fucking hard I tried?”
L’s breath hitched. Harry was surprised by how near it sounded, just the other side of that crack. He couldn’t tell if it was because of what he had said, or because L was in pain.
“You want me to leave,” said Draco blankly.
Draco blinked several times up at the canopy.
“Cheeky top-up, boys?”
Harry smiled.
Draco nodded and waited patiently while Harry tried to formulate his question.
Draco’s furious expression was replaced with something more like surprise.
He was using it less and less, anyway. By the time he’d been at Grimmauld Place a week, he walked with a cane, and they only used the wheelchair if he got one of his headaches.
“Uh,” he said, wiping himself with a napkin. “I don’t have one.”
Theo: Draco’s not in a position to be a Sugar Daddy.
He looked suddenly huge in his awkwardness, and ran a hand through his hair.
“Will you be safe?” asked Harry. “With Neville?”
“Scared?” asked Draco. Potter made an eye-rolly sort of expression.
to us about it—”
“You think I’d risk Azkaban? When I’m Cassie’s sole guardian? Fuck you.”
“Are you okay?” asked Harry, sounding concerned, maybe, so Draco lined up their bodies, wrapped his arms around Harry’s strong, steady body, and kissed him.
Timothy laughed that hopeless laugh again.
“I want to help,” she said. “And when you get him back, I will do everything I can to make it easy for both of you. I promise. I love you, Harry.”
“Oh, right, cool,” said Harry.
That night, luxuriating in the painlessness, Harry realised that Malfoy cheating on his girlfriend was probably a rare instance of Malfoy’s cruelty working out in Harry’s favour. It lessened his incentive to sell Harry out to the papers. The secrecy contract made very little difference to Harry’s paranoia. Malfoy was plenty clever enough to work out how to break it, if he decided he wanted to.
At first, he thought it was simply because spring came early to the castle that year, and the whole earth seemed awake. But as he stood in the Cloisters, grieving his mother without wanting to join her in the ground, he knew that something fundamental had clicked back into place.
Timothy blushed and looked back at his ledger.
“Are you okay?”
Draco reluctantly looked at him, and Harry took a tentative step forward. When Draco didn’t shy away, he took another, closing the gap between them. He plunged his fingers into Draco’s hair and tugged their faces together, so that their foreheads touched. Draco’s hands rested on his chest.
“I is not liking to come to you when you is with people, sir,” said Misty, which is how Draco realised he hadn’t been alone for a long, long time.
“Please, call me Blaise.” His voice was a low purr.
Nor did he answer the next three letters Harry sent him.
Draco obeyed. He stood by the sink and looked at his reflection. He thought how strange it was that he could once have been so loved, so prized.
“It’s not my…!”
“People have chilled out a lot,” said Ron.
The blackbird landed next to him, right next to him. He opened his beak and sang, so Draco did the same. When they had poured out their hearts, the blackbird hopped closer and jerked his head into Draco’s neck.
Adelaide smiled at him.
Harry laughed.
“I want to see if it’s really thought damage, and how bad it is. I need to talk to him. Take me with you, next time.”
“Which do you think Granger would prefer?” he asked. “Ah—that’s another thing, should I start calling her Hermione, all of a sudden? Develop some charming nickname? How do you think she’d take to
“Voldemort used to do that,” said Harry.
“He’s alive!” said Draco, although his smile was rather strained.
“Er, yeah, of course,” said Harry. He cast a patronus telling Hermione to come over immediately.
“What do you
All of it made Harry miss Draco. He slipped away into the shiny kitchen, and that was how Neville got him alone, which, it transpired, was something Neville had been trying to do for a while.
writing a think piece.
“You don’t know what this means to me,” he said, sounding as if Harry had just given him a million galleons, or his first born child, or a whole new life.
“Weird,” said Goyle, but he lifted his sleeve and held out his arm. Harry took a deep breath and looked at it.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry. “I love him.”
“You…?”
“…and then I played with him for an hour, and by the end, Aunt Andromeda was practically inviting me to live with her,” he told Pansy that evening, as they broke into Kew Gardens (#84 on the Bucket List).
They gave him a muffin in plastic wrapping. It had fruit in it, the bad kind. Draco ate it and decided that he could stick it out with Tertius until he was twenty-one and got his wand back. With his wand, everything would be easier.
“I’m here,” he said, and although that didn’t change the fact that Harry wasn’t over the war, it did change
But afterwards, Malfoy returned the favour; Harry sprawled out on the stairs, Malfoy on his knees before him, and Harry wanted to touch him so badly that he had to hold on to the bannisters to stop himself.
“I’ll quit the aurors if they don’t let him go,” he told her.
“Oh, thank God,” said Harry. He closed the gap between them in two strides, seized Draco’s face, and pulled him into a furious, open-mouthed kiss.
Bitterness, or redemption. Draco could not have decided to become a better person for selfless reasons: not when he crouched alone in Azkaban, orphaned, despised and imprisoned. Had he tried, he would likely have awoken the bitterness. So instead, he had found a self-serving reason to push himself towards redemption. He was Slytherin through and through (Harry remembered how the hat had called out Draco’s house almost the instant it touched his head), and so his goodness was different from Harry’s. But the issue of whether it counted as true goodness struck Harry as more or less linguistic: some might call it calculating, but it could just as easily be termed purposeful.
“Earl grey and a chocolate eclair?” said the waitress.
you,” he had wept.
But Malfoy didn't know that Harry had been a crazed stalker, so from his point of view, Harry hadn’t seen him since the summer after the war. They had run into each other a few times then, at funerals, or trials, and once at Luna’s house.
to do, though?” asked Harry.
“Fuck ‘em,” mumbled Harry. He pressed a lazy kiss onto the nearest part of Draco he could reach, which was his collarbone, and Draco momentarily stopped wriggling.
“Ow, fuck,” said Harry, as one of the kitten’s claws caught his skin. In his moment of pain, the kitten leapt out of his arms and fled underneath Harry’s bed. Harry licked at his scratch, then remembered he was a wizard, and healed it with his wand.
“I’m not a child,” said Draco, happily dipping his thin slices of toast into the buttery yellow yolks.
“I asked him to marry me.”
“Oh, don’t be so hetero,” snapped Draco. “You know what I mean.”
“Er, yeah, probably.” His voice hardened. “Only you can’t be a stuck-up prick about them.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Er. Letters?”
“Is everything okay?” he asked, even though it clearly was not. However neatly dressed he was, Draco was evidently on the brink of collapse. His hair flopped into his eyes. It looked good, but also deeply and shockingly unkempt. He turned his head towards Harry.
“He’s
“The more I hear about this Henry Biggs, the less keen I feel on him,” said Harry, weakly. Scorpius didn’t say anything. He didn’t even look at Harry.
Harry was genuinely curious.
“It’s okay.”
“No, no, it’s fine, I have a plan in place,” said Draco, his fingers flickering the way they did when he was craving. “Are you ready? I’ve set a timer. Let’s go.”
To Harry’s great surprise, she threw herself into his arms and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
“Did you… did you know that in muggle schools, they teach English? All the way up until OWLs?”
“Doesn’t mean anything. He always was a nosy bastard.”
“Harry,” he said. “Don’t.”
“No? It helps me. My turn. Did you mean—”
“We can’t not eat every time I’m unhappy. We’d starve.”
“Er, that’s fine?”
“Of course not,” said Malfoy. “I’m just as shocked as you are. I thought you were some wise-beyond-your-years twenty-year-old. I felt a bit weird about it.”
The second time he ran away was when he realised that Tertius’ little anger problem was going to kill either him or Adelaide, and that the only question was who would go first. This time, there could have been no doubt that Draco had done a runner: he stayed away for two nights, sleeping on benches and trying to figure out what to do. He ended up at a Muggle homeless shelter, but he didn’t understand any of the questions they asked him, things like Did he have a National Insurance Number? and Was he registered with a GP?
“I’m sorry,” said Harry automatically.
“I’m a bit gay. I think. I mean, I’m definitely quite gay.”
“Can I kiss you?” asked Sebastian.
“Jesus,” said Harry, “what a fucking mess.”
When Tertius came back, he didn’t hit Draco. He showered Draco with affection and gifts, made Draco feel as if he had been crazy to run away in the first place. But there was a blood stain at the bottom of the stairs that lasted long beyond Adelaide’s bruises and hastily healed broken arm, and whenever Draco looked at it he remembered that there was a timer hanging over both of them. He knew this feeling, had felt it before, with Voldemort: the feeling that he was expendable.
, exactly,” said Ron, apparently not finding Harry’s sudden declaration of love worth remarking on. “Just thought it might be a bit rubbish for him, you know, his first Christmas without his family.”
Harry asked the girls a few more questions. Draco seemed wholly incapable of saying anything else. He only stared at the concrete steps, looking as though he was running through a list of all the mistakes he’d ever made.
Draco was packing away his crown into a bag. He shook his head.
“I’ll walk you out,” said Pansy, and the healer gladly let himself be led away.
“He used to apologise all the time,” said Nick. “In these weird, excessive ways.”
“You and Harry are still mortal enemies, then?” asked Ron.
He explained about the horcrux, how bad-tempered they had been, how hopeless. They walked aimlessly as he talked, so he didn’t have to look at Draco.
“She’s nervous,” said Draco, his voice low, but Adelaide still caught it.
“So then what did you say?” asked Pansy eagerly.
“I’m famously lovely,” pronounced Draco.
“A free elf,” said Harry.
Draco’s eyes flicked to his face. He looked almost bored, but Harry could tell from the tenseness of his muscles that he was scared.
“Would you like the dessert menu?” asked the chirpy waiter.
“You know what else might make you proud of me? I’m gay,” said Draco, the blood thumping through him.
You can find me on Instagram and (newly) Twitter at @let_them_eat_books if you're interested in seeing the books I've been getting excited about lately!
“You’re free,” he said. “Didn’t you hear? All the other elves have gone to Hogwarts.”
“Soon,” said Harry. He wanted Draco to settle in a bit, first. He was clearly still shaken by his time in Azkaban. If Harry used the loo in the night, Draco always woke up when he was gone. Harry would come back and find him sitting with his head between his knees, breathing deeply.
Returning to Hogwarts had been about as unpleasant as he had thought it would be. Around Potter, people kept their distance. But they more than made up for it in the moments when Draco was alone.
“I wish that, too.”
“Therapist.”
“Do we have the ingredients?”
“I’m not sleeping with you, Harry.”
“You don’t have to ask,” said Adelaide, but he always did, before they did anything serious. Always moved slowly towards her, and stopped to ask if she was okay.
It was somehow both exactly what Harry had expected, and nothing at all like what he had expected. It was small and clean and crammed with books (this all made sense). But it was also cosy and unpretentious. It seemed thoroughly lived in. And just now, it was filled with laughter and noise.
“She apologised for hurting my feelings, if you’d believe it,” said Draco.
“But I love you,” he said.
“It’s a tolerant late-night restaurant,” explained Harry.
“All right, Draco?”
“Are you still awake?” asked Harry, when he was done.
Both Draco and Goyle seemed to have forgotten Harry was even there. They allowed Kingsley to take them by the elbow and then the three of them were gone, on their way to the Ministry by portkey. Harry stood alone in the Cloisters, a sick, tired feeling in his gut.
“Say you tell him, and he forgives you,” said Hermione, frowning. She seemed rather dazed. “What then? This is
“I don’t know why you would be. You’re great at it.”
he try to make nice with Harry, now. How
“So, what, you’re pity-shagging him?”
“I didn’t,” said Draco.
“Draco,” said Ron, taking his hand across the table. “Don’t stress out, okay? He just does this, sometimes.”
“Hey! Where’d my hoodie go?”
“Okay,” said Harry, “but they’re both shit. Not equally shit, but still both definitively shit.”
Harry locked the door, then set about trying to make him more comfortable. He turned out the studio light altogether, casting several small balls of glowing light, instead. He cast a cooling charm on Draco, and a cleaning charm on the bedsheets, which were soaked in sweat.
“I hate falling asleep somewhere random,” said Harry. “Makes me wake up all achey.”
“It’s going to be okay.”
The words came pouring out of Draco, as if he had been dosed with Veritaserum:
“Fine,” he muttered. “It was just a suggestion.”
“Contact me through Potter,” said Pansy. “Please.”
I have.”
“I’m just doing it so Hermione will fancy me.”
,” he said. “Christ, put on some clothes, Goyle, I can’t handle feeling insecure this early in the morning.”
A week later, they met at Harry’s flat instead of the pub. Harry was numbly amazed that this was really happening.
“You were the cutest bird I’ve ever seen,” Harry told him.
“Yes, well, you gave up to right to be comfortable with my actions when you fucked my cousin in our bed on my birthday, didn’t you?”
The wounds on his head had not yet healed the day that Adelaide came into his room, her eyes huge.
“I do. It was to kill Voldemort. I did it already,” said Harry, emptily. He didn’t know why they were talking about this.
“I’ve invited Ron and Hermione to come to the museum with us this afternoon,” said Harry.
All the way home, Harry thought of different ways he could answer that.
“Harry?”
“They knew there was a mole,” said Malfoy. “They changed the plan at the last minute. I had put all these protections around the wife, and then they went for the girl instead.”
Malfoy’s expression tightened.
sorry,” he said. “Of course I’m sorry my Aunt and Uncle are dead.”
two need to go there?” he asked.
“Fine. How glamorous are you?”
“Did you love him?” asked Harry.
He flicked his wand at the record player and electronic music began to play. Instantly, Harry started to dance. It felt great, amazing, good. Draco poured out the coffee into the mug, drained it.
“May I kiss you?” he asked.
When Draco ended up in Hell, and Potter ended up in the other place—Draco hadn’t really understood much beyond Hell, when it came to Muggle religion—would Potter think Draco had chosen that, too? That it was what he had
“Did you sleep okay?” asked Harry.
“Exactly. But I do want to do
Draco started going out alone a lot more, after that. Sometimes he was fine when he got back. Other times, he was silent for hours after, and when he spoke it was only to start horrible conversations—
with, apparently.”
“Potter! Spare the rod and spoil the child!”
“I wasn’t sleeping with Steven,” said Draco. “Or anyone else.”
“You look hot,” he said.
“There’s no ‘of course’ about it, Harry,” said Hermione. “You were horrified when you found out you were married to him.”
“I don’t usually like these things,” said Potter, looking around at the other guests. He seemed a little nervous, which Draco found unnerving. “Everyone always expects me to be interesting.”
“How would you know?”
“Do I have a say in what topics you decide are too sensitive for my traumatised ears?”
“Yeah. Cool. Good.”
“I sleep better, when you’re here,” said Harry, and Draco’s grin dropped.
“You weren’t joking,” said Ron.
Blaise put his hands on either side of Draco’s head and squeezed.
Harry nodded.
“All resolved, is it?”
“It wouldn’t have made a difference, if you had done more.”
“Whatever.”
So Ron bought her a lager, and Harry told her the whole sorry story. She looked slightly taken aback when Harry told her Draco had been camming, but less so than he might have expected.
Adelaide made a snuffling sound and turned over.
When the hour was up, Draco looked shiftily down at his hands.
“Sorry-sorry-sorry! I forgot!” she said. She looked like a toddler desperate for the loo.
, where bad things happened to Malfoys.
She chewed on the inside of her cheek.
“We have to do something about this.
The last one had been to Blaise. They hadn’t spoken for a month afterwards. It was Blaise who had cracked, of course, because Blaise was the lonelier one out of the two of them. He had shown up at the flat, miserable and sharp, and said “I still think you’re a bell-end.”
“Shit,” said Neville.
“You were a finance administrator.”
“Let me,” said Harry. Draco stood very still as Harry unbuttoned him, and gently took his shirt off. He folded it over the arm of a nearby chair. Draco stood, half naked, staring at him with wide eyes. He was covering his Dark Mark with his hand. Harry helped him into his pyjama shirt, but did not button it.
“Oh, God!”
It was a picture from some glitzy society party, the sort Harry always refused to attend. Draco looked arrestingly handsome as he smiled at the camera. Clarence stood behind him, his chin resting on Draco’s head, his muscular arms wrapped around Draco’s slim body.
self-involved.
“You don’t even show your real fucking face to me, Draco, and if that’s not an apt metaphor for our relationship, I don’t know what is.”
Draco kicked off his shoes and crawled under the covers.
“Let him come in!” said Fiona.
“So why do you always come here?”
“We always knew it was something like that,” she said.
“Er,” said Harry.
“No,” said Harry. “You can just send them to me. I’m at Ron and Hermione’s.”
“What do you mean?”
Draco became aware of another individual voice out of all the noise. He turned his head and saw Zacharias Smith, sobbing into his hands.
Draco spiked another bite of salad with his fork. She’d ordered it in. Draco hadn’t known you
She put her knife and fork neatly on her plate.
“So I’m in love with him, and he fancies me, and we live together, and there’s nothing we can fucking do about it?” said Harry, kicking at an old cigarette butt.
Maybe it was selfish to say yes. Draco wasn’t sure. He knew that Clarence loved him, and he didn’t think it would, realistically, get better than that. He made Clarence happy, he knew that— or he made Clarence look good at parties, which amounted to more or less the same thing, for Clarence.
“It changed,” he said, which wasn’t really an answer at all.
Harry had too many questions to know what to ask first.
“You don’t know a thing about me and Neville,” he said. “Don’t pretend you do.”
“Let me know if you experience any uncomfortable side-effects, and I’ll make something up for you, to help,” he said, speaking a little too quickly.
Draco shrugged.
It was as he told Draco about third year that Harry realised he was in love with Draco.
“Well, I’m sorry if I’m not fun enough for you. I’m trying to be an adult.”
Harry, and everyone else in the coffee shop, stared as Draco stalked out the door.
“—Me too, I’m going mad, I was probably staring at you like an utter psychopath all afternoon—”
“Do it,” he said.
“Thank you for taking me to visit him,” she said, and Harry had the feeling that her politeness was a bad sign. What had she said to Malfoy? She behaved much better around Harry
“Fuck,” said Draco. “What if I hacked off his head with a butter knife!”
“Could hardly help it,” said Draco, running his fingers along the spines of his books.
Hermione blushed.
Draco clenched his jaw— how had Harry not
“You poor thing,” murmured Harry. “I wish I was there. I wish I could take care of you.”
“I don’t know what to think,” said Draco. “I don’t know what I feel.” He pushed away from Harry, climbed into the bath, and drew the shower curtain so that Harry wouldn’t be able to see him.
“Sounds like a lot of pressure,” said Harry. “I just want you to be happy.”
“Right, I came to give you a get-well gift,” said Ron. “But I’ll just fuck off, shall I?”
anything!”
“You should go to his house,” said Ron.
“You what?!”
“I’m allowed to stare,” said Harry. “She’s cute.”
“I was given this when I was eleven, but I want you to have it now.”
Harry slowly put the letters back into the drawer and rested his head against the sharp wooden edge of the desk, a hollow feeling spreading through his chest.
His Dark Mark felt heavy and disgusting on his arm.
“I’m sure Draco wouldn’t mind if you came along,” said Hermione.
Hermione pursed her lips.
“Didn’t it make them suspicious?”
Chett again. Harry wondered how, exactly, it went.
it was like living in a Shakespeare comedy. He got Theo to admit he was bisexual by organising a strangely aggressive crossdressing night.”
They had been
“Maybe I should wait until you’re free to spend time with her,” said Harry, because Malfoy couldn’t seem to look at him. “Would that make you feel better about it?”
Malfoy looked delighted. Ron made an outraged sound.
“Yeah,” said Draco.
“I love you, too.”
“I don’t know,” said Ron. “Something. To embarrass him. Does he do private shows?”
“So three is…”
“No, really. He’s handsome, funny, well-dressed. Just the right amount of bad. Lives in the real world with you.” Draco was looking at him intently, but again, he didn’t seem hurt or closed off. He seemed… concerned. “I’m serious. You could do worse. If anyone could make you happy, he could.”
“Really?” asked Draco.
“You’re so tightly wound,” said Malfoy. “Relax. Just watch me.”
But Draco folded his arms over himself, looking suddenly slight and small.
“No,” lied Adelaide. Draco sighed.
“I know what I said!” said Harry, running a hand through his inky hair. He was clearly bristling with frustration, which Draco didn’t understand at
Fear gripped Draco. He chased after Potter, terrified that he would be too late.
The lift juddered to a stop.
“I didn’t mean—” said Harry. “You just kissed me, so I—”
“Blaise would let you.”
“You’re my best friend,” she said.
“I’m not over it either,” said Dean, quietly, when he hugged Harry.
Harry sat on the changing room bench and looked at Marcus expectantly.
“Yes, you can.”
There was a pool of blood where his head had been. Adelaide handed him a clean hand towel, not looking at him.
“Easy enough, when no one knows who you are,” said Draco, because he knew full well how this evening would go if he had his own face on.
“So?” said Harry, once they were back at his flat.
Harry dropped to his knees.
“That’s not an answer,” said Harry.
“You’re Harry’s only family,” said Draco. “And now you’re going to start your own, without him. Or at least, I imagine that’s how I would feel, if I were him.”
“That’s really good of you,” he said.
She had been much warmer towards him since he’d given her the cloak, but it occurred to him that it was more than the gift. He had got Draco safely back to his cell, the day she broke in. He had dealt with the ministry alarm. Clearly, this action had convinced Cassie that he wasn’t trying to harm Draco. That, and whatever it was that Draco had said to her, before Harry found them.
“Hermione!”
“Yeah, because you love the pub. You were upset.”
“What?” asked Pansy.
“He drew his— his
“How’s it all going with Malfoy?” asked Ron.
“That was in the
Harry wondered what the change was. He suspected it was that Draco knew Harry wouldn’t have brought them if they were going to be dicks.
“What did he say?”
“I’m,” said Harry. “I’m— I don’t know if I’m in love with you yet. It feels like I am. But I
Harry laughed so hard he had to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’m sure,” said Harry. “You said, ‘Can I tell you something?’”
“I have thought about it,” said Harry. “And it’s my turn. What changed? Yesterday, you didn’t know what you wanted.”
tell you. And do you remember what you said? Because I do. I’ve never forgotten. You said that I was still a fucking Death Eater, that you didn’t want anything to do with me, and that you’d only shagged me because I was easy. You said if I wanted help I should have taken it when Dumbledore offered.”
“I quit my job because of him,” said Harry, unable to focus on what she was saying. “I don’t understand. You could have just said you didn’t want me to be with him.”
With a dizzying lurch in perception, Harry suddenly remembered who he had spent the night with.
“Are you terribly lonely without Pansy Parkinson, Harry?” he asked Harry, pulling her close and kissing her on the cheek. “Are you like a flower in a winter of no sun?”
“You read my letters?”
“I’m sorry your ex was a short-sighted, scheming twat,” Draco said into his ear. “That’s absolutely shit.”
Draco burned bright red and turned away.
Ron and Hermione stared at him in appalled silence.
“I’ve got enough for about twelve, mate. Come over.”
. He was just trying to convince himself.”
“Yes,” said Draco, nodding forcefully. “Just now. Congratulate me; I’m enlightened.”
said that, although not in so many words.
A muscle twitched in Draco’s jaw. He lowered his face into his hands for an instant then raised it again.
,” said Draco, getting to his feet.
The explosion was nearer than usual, and he heard the Dark Lord’s high, shrieking curses, and he sat up in bed
“No one deserves that,” he muttered. He blinked, hard, and looked away.
“I haven’t told anyone.”
“Hold still. Fuck, you’re tight.”
“Why does anyone want anything?” He looked away, then nodded slightly to himself. When he looked back, he wore an expression Harry had never seen on him before. It made Harry uncomfortable, because it was so fake, so out of place.
“Stop!” said Harry, finally, finally getting to Malfoy’s side. “This is
“I’m not sure anything did,” said Harry.
“Okay. And I don’t need you to suddenly trust me completely. But I can’t be in a relationship with you if—” Harry was struck by the sharp fear that he should never have spoken, that he was in the process of giving an ultimatum he had not intended to set. “—if you’ll never be able to love me again.”
“I love you too,” said Malfoy, his voice husky. Harry wished he hadn’t come. He was intruding.
“No, I have…” said Harry, but Malfoy had already carried Hermione out of the room. “…a sandwich.”

it sometimes felt as if Harry was onto something, although Draco wasn’t sure what.
Misty took the quill and ink. She stuck her tongue out as she doodled. At the end of five minutes, she presented him with a photographic portrait of himself.
“Mhm,” said Malfoy, not looking up from his book.
“Lam,” said Harry, putting his hand on Lamorak’s left forearm. “I know you. I respect you. There’s nothing I could learn about you that would change that.”
All the house elves had been freed. Draco drifted through the harrowed rooms. From time to time, he paused, and catastrophic loneliness closed over him.
“My father says it’s sexist to praise little girls for their looks and nothing else,” she said haughtily.

“Only if you get this right, and you do your other homework.”
to. He really, really wanted to.
He wasn’t even sure how Harry had put it there without him noticing. He folded and unfolded it, reading it too many times, until it made both too little and too much sense. He fell asleep with it in his hand.
Draco laughed indulgently as Timothy went to embrace him.
“Breakfast,” said Hermione.
“Oh, yeah, perfect.”
” said Teddy.
“I think it did. Listen, I have to get back to work. I’ll see you after your trial tomorrow, yeah?”

“Your house is lovely,” said Luna, as they finished their ice cream. The crystal dishes disappeared when they were done, and tiny porcelain bowls of mints appeared in their stead, along with a silver cart laden with tea paraphernalia.
Draco looked at Harry.
He left the room—and his wand, which was on the bedside table. Draco scrambled for it and cast hasty Healing spells at himself. He glamoured his fucked up hand. He even healed the things that hadn’t bruised, like his twisted ankle, then threw the wand back on the table just in time.
Draco covered his face with his hands.
“And Draco has almost no control. He’s working on it, but until we break the curse, he’s liable to be killed any time he turns. He’s quite vulnerable as a kitten.”
“Is Dra— Malcolm here?” asked Harry.
“I think you should see him,” said Susan.
“You turned into a kitten. I guess something must have stressed you out.”
The door opened. Scorpius came barrelling through it, looking tiny and terrified in blue pyjamas.
“Look, are any of you actually planning on doing work?” asked Hermione.
“Oh. No, I do,” said Harry, with the tone of someone clearing up a minor misunderstanding in the workplace.
deserve.
“Oh!” she said. Her hair smelled like her, concentrated. His aunt had tortured her in his living room, and yet here she was, nuzzling into his chest. “Oh,” she went on, catching her breath, “oh, it was wonderful! Wonderful!”
Harry stared at her, baffled.
Stop!”
“Papped!” he said. “The Golden Trio engage in sick, fully-clothed sexual perversion! Turn to page three to find out more.”
But no fear, Harry, I’ll buy you something so extravagant for your real birthday that you’ll
“Yeah, because you call me Potter!”
“You said you forgave me,” wept his mother.
Hermione smiled.
“We’re friends when we’re drunk, at least,” said Harry. Malfoy laughed.
“To not give up on him. I take full responsibility for your happiness.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and took a long drink of wine, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand afterwards.
He tried not to think about it. He was very bad at not thinking about it.
Harry looked confused.
“Yeah,” he said. “Something like that.” He started towards the dormitory stairs. “It’s late.”
“Happy to, if you like,” he said.
“Oh,” said Malfoy. “Yes. You do.”
“Really?” Blaise looked suddenly earnest. It was so like Draco that Harry startled. The abrupt dropping of the veil, the flickering between laconic charm and sincerity— it was like a glimpse into a parallel universe. Blaise was who Draco might have been, if he hadn’t been a Death Eater. Confident. Well-dressed. Hitting on Harry in a wizarding bar.
“Oh, you are something else,” said Harry, desperately fond. “Obviously
“Yes,” said Draco.
“Yeah,” said Harry blandly.
“You haven’t seen my memories yet,” he said. He had sent them in to St Mungo’s so that Harry wouldn’t have to talk to him in order to see them, but it was obvious Harry hadn’t watched them. If he had, he would have been gentler. Draco was sure of that.
“Have we scared you off, Potter?” asked Draco. “Will you be fleeing to the warm embrace of the Gryffindors?”
Draco flexed it experimentally.
about you, but then I saw how miserable you were without him, and I hoped you’d get over it, but you just
There was a pause as Harry tried to think what to say. He settled on,
“Disgusting Sweaty Tim asked me out on a date!” she continued, barrelling into Draco’s bedroom. “Oh,” she said. “Potter.”
“Harry!” he said now. “Out and proud! Penny did a good job, didn't she?”
There was another year of training after the reveal, so Harry’s life was, structurally, much the same as it had been before. Four days a week, he trained at the Department of Mysteries. Three days a week, he worked at the Auror department.
“Waffles and tea please, Kreacher,” said Draco. “Have you got any chocolate spread?”
“Waffles sound nice,” said Draco drowsily from the other side of the bed.
Draco moved his head warily, as if he were trying to get water out of his ears.
“I was a terrible boyfriend to Neville. I drove him mad,” he said. He didn’t seem to notice that Harry had moved away.
“Boethius’
There was a long pause. When Malfoy spoke, it was with fierce quietness.
Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at him.
Harry knew he shouldn’t look. He knew, and yet he couldn’t stop himself from picking up the first letter. It had a date at the top, showing that it was from almost eleven years ago. Harry glanced at the next piece of paper and saw that it was also a letter addressed to him. The next one was, as well. It was a whole drawer of letters to him, and interspersed throughout were pictures: pictures of Cassie.
“It’s hard to tell without seeing him, of course, but it sounds like spell damage,” she told him. “Make him come to me.”
“You don’t think he actually wants to be friends?” asked Astoria.
Draco shrugged, looking at his hands.
“How did it go?” asked Pansy. They were in the Oxford Botanical Gardens. Pansy was eating an ice cream.
“Let me take you home,” said Harry, and this seemed to get through to Draco.
“That’s not what I’m saying. I just want you to be careful. Who knows how he’s reacting to the bond?”
“Sure. I’ll see them, if you’re there.”
“Even though I’ve had a shit month,” Harry went on, “it’s been so much less shit than this time last year, and
“Why don’t we go to my place,” said Harry. “It’s near.”
“I told Hermione everything,” said Harry.
“Your roots are showing,” he said. She sobbed harder, but didn’t tell him to go. He sat on the edge of the bed, put one hand on her back. “I brought you tea.”
“He hasn’t had any in ages,” said Draco, feeling oddly defensive.
Draco drew his head slowly back into the room and shut the window. He felt calmer. Misty put a tray down on the coffee table with a mug of redbush tea and some ginger biscuits.
“You’re terrifyingly efficient, sometimes,” murmured Harry.
Adelaide sat on a pleather sofa sleeper bed, painting her toenails. She looked up when they came in.
“I’m sorry—”
“I’m sorry about what happened last time I saw you cry,” said Harry, tightening his grip around Draco and nuzzling his back with his cheek.
Potter’s glare was filled with loathing. He kept it fixed on Draco as he summoned a quill, ink and a stack of parchment.
“Potter,” he said. He was cold and impenetrable, where before he had been elastic with emotion.
“It’s really mine?” she said.
“Fuck’s sake. Malfoy, if I ever want to date you—which I won’t—you will know about it, okay?”
“Er, no?”
“I washed them less than a week ago!”
“That might work. He’d do anything for her. Even,” Blaise sneered, “marry
And Draco always seemed interested.
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” he said, in that same, hollow voice.
Draco noted that the “please” negated the order of the “tell me.” But Steven’s previous command took hold.
“Do you have to? I’m honestly so rich.”
Nick shrugged.
Harry shook his head, and then, because he could feel L’s breath in his ear, allowed himself a fragment of honesty.
Draco kissed him.
“Do you like him back?” asked Hermione.
“I got cold,” he said.
They were all in a bit of a state.
Harry frowned, but decided not to argue just then. Not when Malfoy’s eyes were still sharp and watery. Harry hadn’t forgotten that the last time Malfoy cried in front of him, he had tried to cast the Cruciatus curse at him.
“You mustn’t mistake his humour for callousness,” she said.
Draco put his hands in Harry’s hair and drew him up.
“There isn’t time to be upset,” said Draco. He sighed. “I’m just so bloody
One recurring dream featured Colin Creevey. In the dream, Harry ran towards the quidditch pitch. Colin ran after him, his camera covering his face, saying
His auror partner was a woman named Bianca Rosenthal. She stared at Harry when he asked her about patrol shifts.
Draco closed his eyes and smiled.
“Independent since 1991, so suck on that, motherfucker,” said Malfoy, who had apparently discovered muggle swear words, along with emojis and sex work.
“Excited…?”
“Okay.”
“It doesn’t matter if you have a good reason to do bad things. Evil can’t be undone,” he said.
“I’m not going to work today,” said Harry. “I’ll give you space if you want, though.”
“What shall we do today?” asked Draco, his fingers moving languorously back and forth through Harry’s hair.
“So Neville sort of pressured you into dating him,” said Harry.
“Oh, no,” he said.
He meant when Draco’s mother died. It was strange to have him bring it up, but for some reason, Draco didn’t mind.
“Head,” he said. His voice was rough from screaming.
“I never lie about geography,” said Malfoy. “But is this your plan? A chaste, hour-long capitals quiz?”
“It’s good to see you,” he said.
“Don’t use Cassie to manipulate me.”
Draco realised.
“Yeah, I’ll stay,” said Harry. And he kept saying that, over and over, for days and weeks, until his toothbrush fit better next to Adelaide’s pink one and Draco’s fancy electric one than it did in his on-suite at Grimmauld.
“It will make a lot more sense when you see them together,” said Hermione. “And he really has changed, Ron.”
Draco’s door burst open and Potter poked his head through. Draco noticed unhappily that Potter clearly couldn’t see his mother. He knew she was dead, but this fresh evidence hit him harder than expected. He carefully straightened his face.
“I heard you guys broke up,” said Harry. Draco jolted.
Ursula took Harry’s arm and dragged him over to Lucius.
Draco came back to Harry’s bedroom, of course. He hadn’t slept in his own bedroom since he broke up with Neville.
“Anything else I can get you, baby?” she asked.
“A fucking cupboard?”
“You need some sleep,” said Harry.
“A friend like me, how?”
“Thwart their evil plans!” said Draco, which Harry took to mean, Yeah, That’s Fine.
“The more the merrier,” said Draco, before Timothy had time to be outraged at the prospect of being left out.
Zabini?” asked Harry.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Because I was going to say, I could cancel. The Society for the Preservation of Grindylow Habitats will be disappointed, but—I mean, I’d like to come.”
“That’s not really on your list, is it?” asked Harry.
“I don’t like it for
“Oh, we’re going to have such fun! Right. Draco, you are not to tell anyone about anything that just happened. You cannot tell them in words, writing, or gesture. When I say the word, you must obliviate Harry. When he asks why you did it, you must tell him he told you to do it because he drunkenly embarrassed himself. If he mentions it further, you must become hostile and aggressive until he stops.”
“Stubborn,” he said.
“You want me to go to bed with you?” he asked.
Draco raised his eyebrows.
. But it was too late. She knew he had meant it. Knew she was the only person Draco had, and the realisation had filled her with a weighty horror, the dread of knowing she couldn’t do it—she couldn’t take care of him. She could barely take care of herself. It was awful, knowing that Draco needed her like that.
“You’re useless. Go open a bottle of wine and
, kickassboy1978, I’m trying to
“Weird kid,” said Harry.
Malfoy laughed.
“I’d have to tell him first.”
The look she gave him was full of disappointment.
Ron came jogging towards them.
“I’m sorry I’m such a twat,” said Draco.
Draco shook his head sorrowfully.
“What does it feel like?” asked Harry.
The first thing he noticed was how loud it was, and how confusing. He felt just as if he had had a dream about falling, and had woken up with a thump feeling flat and pancake-y on his bed. His body felt strange. Not unpleasant, just strange. Empty, as if it had been pumped full of air.
“I shouldn’t have felt him up in bed,” said Harry into his pint glass. Ron glanced up sharply.
“You can be upset if you want,” she said.
“I tried to fuck Draco, once,” said Dean, in a confiding tone. Draco sighed and looked away. He seemed very old, all of a sudden. Very tired. “He wouldn’t,” said Dean. “Frigid cow.”
Draco ate another ice cube.
Draco wasn’t looking at him. Harry leant his elbow on the counter. He kept getting distracted by remembering that he had been
“And I’m telling Ron and Hermione and the Weasleys.”
So Harry slipped past them, to where Eve was hovering in the hall. She put her finger to her lips.
Harry felt terrible when they got back to Will’s place. It was filled with posters for films Harry didn’t recognise, and reminded him of how fundamentally he and Will didn’t know each other.
“Let’s lie down,” said Harry. So they did, Harry lying on his back, Draco slotting next to him, his head nestled in the crook of Harry’s shoulder.
much. I don’t know. I need space.”
Draco apparated them to a long, straight path. It ran neatly through the tailored fields.
Harry stared at the letter for a long time. The exclamation mark. The fact Malfoy had sent it at all. It occurred to Harry for the first time that he and Malfoy might sort of be friends. He wrote to Malfoy in rather the same way someone might write to a diary, and Malfoy wrote back just enough to prove that Harry’s musings weren’t, in fact, lost to the void. But he still hadn’t seen Malfoy since that last party, over six months ago.
“Can I touch your hair?”
Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
“Get married and have three children.”
“How ominous,” he said, with a small kiss.
“You can’t still like him, now that you know he was tricking you all that time,” said Ron.
He gave Dean the note with bad grace and stabbed angrily at his sausages and eggs.
Adelaide went into her bedroom when they got home, and Draco straddled Harry on the sofa, alternated between kissing Harry’s collar bones and starting guiltily away whenever he thought he heard a sound.
“Working out,” said Pansy. She hovered by the window, all black hair and snagged tights. Blaise seemed, for a moment, as if he wanted to go to her, then went purposefully to the sofa instead.
“It’s hard enough as it is!” said Draco, louder, less controlled than he had meant to. He forced himself to be calm. “It’s hard enough, to be dying, and in unrequited love, and in pain. It’s hard enough, without him rejecting me.”
,” said Draco quietly.
has good—” she stopped herself.
Once Harry, Ron and Hermione had all drunk, they looked at each with jittery anticipation.
,” said Astoria.
“Funny,” said Seamus, not smiling.
Harry shook his head.
“No,” said Harry bitterly.
He talked about the Dursleys, about how he still had trouble identifying hunger pangs because he had become so immune to them growing up. He talked about the cupboard, and relating to that boa constrictor in the zoo (Malfoy laughed when Harry told him about setting the boa free). He talked about his horrible second year summer.
Eve grinned.
Harry smiled.
,” said Harry.
now?”
in half a day. It ended on a cliff hanger. He shut the book with gusto and Malfoy glanced up. They were both in the living room. Malfoy seemed to do nothing all day but pour over
“He’s proud of you,” she said.
Sometimes, Harry would watch his memory-self realise for a split-second who it was that he was sleeping with. It was usually when Harry kissed his way down Malfoy’s arms, and encountered the Dark Mark. Harry could see his past-self pull back in surprise, and then the horror disappear from his expression as he forgot what he had seen.
