And after a hour of Harry holding his hand and patiently instructing him on the casting of a spell, Draco was able to produce a faint, silvery mist from his wand, so feeble it was barely visible.
Sometimes he'd invite Ron and Hermione to come take a quiet walk along the Thames with him, but most of the time he liked to be alone, lost in thought.
His best friend hugged him silently, Harry's tears flowing down his face as he quietly sobbed into Ron's shoulder.
was all he said as he sat up, extricating himself from Harry's grip. If Draco had been paying attention, he would have seen the surprise and hurt in Harry's eyes, but he wasn't.
He brushed his teeth and splashed more water on his face, and wondered if his hair still smelled awful.
Harry was surprised. Given Draco's magical ability he should have at least been able to conjure silver mist, if nothing else.
, he muttered, his world foggy though his eyes filled with tears and his glasses foggy from the tears and the cotton balls in his ears and the numbness of his hands on his wet face.
Harry had gotten off the phone with Hermione. To his dismay, the shirt had gotten crumpled again and he grabbed his wand, trying to straighten it.
Harry was drowsy and languid with contentment, feeling a deep sense of happy fulfillment just to wake up to Draco's warm slumbering form beside him. He snuggled deeper under the covers and even closer to Draco, if that was humanly possible, pressing a kiss to his cheek and listening to his chest rise and fall as he softly inhaled and exhaled and breathing in Draco's warm scent.
It was actually getting fricking ridiculous, but Harry didn't have the heart to get rid of any of it.
Harry held the roller dripping red onto the green rug that he'd forgotten to throw out. Not blood, although that was what it looked like.
Harry felt his face and chest fill with an excited warmth as he left the bedroom, shakily closing the door behind him and walking into the living room while pulling down the cuffs of his shirt. The sound of his loafers on the ground was muffled by one of Draco's green rugs.
And all Draco could do was shrug as he stood up and began to walk out of the room, Harry storming after him.
He especially liked the Reptile House at the zoo. Harry couldn't understand Parseltongue anymore, but he found the slow, languid movements of the snakes relaxing.
Harry stood in front of the forest green wall, feeling hesitant. Another blob of paint dripped onto the rug.
Harry closed the door quietly and sat back down beside the armchair, nudging the ashes on the floor with his foot.
That Sunday, it rained again but was warm instead of icy cold. The scent of spring was in the air. The rain thumped softly against the wet pavement outside.
Harry stood in the bathroom, staring at the blotchy skin on his face and the puffiness around his eyes. His hair looked even messier than usual, sticking out of his head in a bizarre tangle.
Anyway, he'd felt bad about lying and decided to turn up anyway, against his better judgement, and now he was here, half-drunk in the darkest corner of the Leaky Cauldron and not wiliing to reveal that he'd cared to come.
The Harry in the picture was grinning ear to ear and pretty much sparkling in effervescent happiness. He wasn't looking at the camera; he was looking at Draco, who was staring blankly at the photographer.
He constructed nightmare situations in his mind, thought of the kidnapping scenario from Auror training they'd been through last week.
Draco sat down on the edge of the bed, Harry sitting beside him. The wrapped box slipped to the floor.
Harry no longer believed that was the case once it got to 7:45. He got up from the one armchair in the living room and walked across to his small kitchen, and poured himself some coffee.
Harry discovered the true extent of Draco's fondness for green when his flat became overtaken with it. Green apples, Draco's green Quidditch jersey draped over the green armchair, green paint on the walls, green curtains, green plants, green keychain ornaments, green candles.
Killing affects me in good and bad ways, depending on the day and how I’m feeling. But I knew that many of the assassins we worked with had problems in feeling remorse and guilt in the act of slaughtering strangers despite the actions these strangers have done. Weasley shouldn’t ask them to do more than they should.

With a plate of waffles on my lap and a jar of jam placed on the counter to my right, I ate with a joyous bounce in my sitting position, thanking all hell that I put on cotton grey shorts that prevented my arse from feeling the cold of the marble beneath me and helped give somewhat of a cushion for my sore fucked out bum. I had on one of Harry’s black rock band T-Shirts on too.
Blinking back the rapid colors varying across my field of vision, my eyes wandered from every which way of direction. The fluttering of my pale eyelashes in quick succession against the flush of my cheeks matched with the fast pace of my heart ramming itself repeatedly against the inner cave of my chest made my eyes start to clear up.
I was about to ask Harry just that, but my words were prevented from escaping my curious mouth when I saw how we reached the end of the tunnel, no ladder or any given source to show
People here often called me “the cold prince” and I didn’t care. It made them stay clear of me. I didn’t need someone to bother me anyway. I liked keeping to myself even when inside I wanted to just give it all up.
I clenched my teeth together, a significant frown turning the corners of my lips down as my eyes formed into slits in their stare down with my alarm clock.
Weasley grunted in front of me. “Harry taught me it. And since you look sort of pale in the complexion, I’m guessing you’ve been put through many apparating spells. This one won’t make you sick, so just walk on through. I’ll be fine.”
Something akin to golden armor pasted itself like second skin to the creatures lower half, covering their groin and the tops of their thighs as it warped around and to cover their bottom half at the back.
I could feel my magic barge it’s way up my throat and ready to spill out and draw in Draco’s essence, like Kitten was it’s prey and it needed to feast upon his flesh and light like the second coming of Christ.
That’s when I felt a hot breeze sweep around the rim of the hole settled between my bumcheeks from the constant stretch of my legs being pulled apart further and further from Harry’s doing, displaying the twitching nervous pucker of my hole to the Gryffindor’s dark gaze.
I was left on my own here and I was going to have to deal with my newfound mentality of my love towards killing someone.
“Remember how dark magic has a mind of its own? Remember how, during the war, every death eater I came across died by my hand. Well, of course, their magic residue didn’t die off, no
Just as I was about to lean back so I could do another series of grinds along with the music that was coming to an end, Harry had snatched a fist full of my hair in his left hand in a blurring motion and made me give away a keening sob when he forced my head to come back down to meet his. He turned my head sharply so he could brush his mouth against my ear lobe as he snarled out his words in a sinister drawl that had my damn lower half jerking over his in response, his breath hot over the skin there. “You’re a fucking
the wrongness of the magic I carried around, from the very beginning I liked the violence and the blood as well as the manipulation I lived through all my life. But being seen and expected to be a good wizard made me try to stop such sickening thoughts. Eventually, I gave up on trying to be someone I wasn’t. It’s just that the dark magic I gained after defeating Voldemort enhanced my conscious thought about all the shit I tried denying myself for years on end since I was a child and made me realize that
“I don’t know what happened, Harry. I was putting dinner away with Ron when I saw Draco sound asleep, and then there was this black smoke seeping into the kitchen from the living room where Draco was. Ron and I ran to Draco to see what was happening, but w-we couldn’t
I deserve you and you deserve me. I handled myself fine and it’s not your fault that a stupid demon got ahold of me. I’m sure it was hard to even find me. And I know I’m basically having a mental breakdown but I-I-I-
With an irritated huff of air, I pursed my lips after swiping the tip of my tongue across the bottom flesh of my mouth in a nervous habit of mine.
Staring at the red digits on my alarm clock, my brows furrowed together in perturbation, the tip of my tongue flicking out to run along the flesh of my bottom lip as my thoughts derailed at the sight of the crimson colors blinking back at me and reminding me of the ruby hues of Potter’s eyes.
Potter’s eyes bore into my own, causing my prick to strain against my pants and my chest to heave up and down with the beating of my heart beneath my chest, fast and scared and thrilled all at the same time.
So I called him out on it with a heavier pressure of my nails digging into his scalp but not to the point that it would hurt, forcing his gaze to snap back up to meet mine again as I raised my brow up at him and voiced my question.
Huffing out in annoyance, I took one step onto the first set of the stairs leading down before I yelped out when a hot breath grazed over the sensitive skin of the back of my neck, causing me to stutter in my walking. “I'll give you some ice cream. Only if you keep your mouth shut for the rest of the night after.” Harry’s voice rumbled over my flesh, and I let out a shuddering breath at the sound of it.
The ceilings were high, the large of the room seeming to stretch on for miles as people clad in combat outfits slammed against one another with a smack of fists, feet and grunting exhalations.
I didn’t even get the chance to say anything. The Gryffindor decided to apparate both of us out of the shopping district immediately after the words he so carelessly drawled out.
I started to huff and puff, hissing through clenched teeth right at the moment the Gryffindor stopped to stand right in front of the chair, my heart hammering wildly while I tried to wriggle my way out of Harry’s tight grip around my lower back.
The demon was silent, the surprise of my attack causing it's brain to practically short circuit it seemed. Zereth had a look of affronted disgust at having me do damage to him, especially since they most likely thought themselves up to be invincible just because they were a demon.
I had to settle the tube of the shimmering amethyst colored newly made potion into it’s metallic tube rack right next to another potion that had the same shade as it since I had to use that one to mix into my potion and I didn’t want to spill any of them.
Hermione had become a dear friend of mine in a short amount of time just by having hung out and talked with me for a single moment. And I appreciated her kindness for what it was. I was oftentimes was wary around others in fear for their motives behind being “nice” to me, but with Hermione and even her husband, I couldn’t find any contempt aimed towards me.
The Assassin blew out an exaggerated breath, rolling his eyes heavenward as he played with my hair, jaw tensing in aggravation as he spoke around a low lilt. “Hezian wants to talk with you and I right now. Says he needs to have a conversation with us face to face instead of using the mind link communication.”
I fiddled with the hem of the plaid fabric of my mini skirt, the tips of my trembling fingers shifting restlessly across the downy material that waded around the upper soft skin of my shaking thighs. The fine silver sheen of the moon spilled across the gleaming jet black color scheme belonging to the Harley Davidson motorcycle perched in its dark glint of obsidian hue steel, the milky froth of the moon’s light catching the sleek, powerful, and dangerous machine.
“Yeah … I dragged you over to the couch by your arms. I couldn’t lift you, you massive log,” I whispered sheepishly to Harry, my gaze stuck on his hard chest that was displayed before my eyes with the way his shirt stuck to his torso from our combining body heat.
The vampire blinked at me, stunted for a moment before I saw the corners of his eyes pinch aggressively into a gnarled fixture that had made my blood run cold. I could feel some people around us stare with fascinated curiosity.
My attention was always on Draco ever since I met him when we were children. I didn’t know why, and for the life of me, I thought the blonde meant nothing but a nuisance and was too much of a pretty boy.
Trees started to gather up around us once again as we trailed up the slope of the mountain, my thighs tensing and relaxing around the machine between my legs, the leather already heated up and sticking to the soft skin of my thighs to create a sort of sticky sensation that made my skin prickle with vibrations from the engine, my breaths fast and covered in simmering heat.
My body, the traitor that it was, had a mind of its own. From one second to the next, I found my feet shuffling about in an awkward jilted walk towards “Thanos”, my brain short circuiting from hearing Harry's simple demand that the whole of my frame seemed to follow without a given thought. The skin on my arms heated up as I grew closer to Harry and the bike with an anxious chew to my lip and a glower from the pinch of my features to show the irritation and shocked warmth wrecking havoc inside of my body at having not protested as much as I thought I would against Harry’s order.
I swiftly ran down the hallway, up the stairs, ordered a shot of tequila from the bartender women, and walked out of the building with my dignity barely intact.
Harry’s head was turned down, glowing eyes taking in the way my body was being jostled in his grip, angling his body slightly away from my torso so he could watch my cock bouncing against my flat tummy and his dick constantly ramming in and out of my ass with a severe focus in his handsome features, a cruel strain that shown in the threateningly sexy curl of his lips.
My breaths were unsteady and rapid, my hips having a mind of their own as I did a figure eight motion of a rolling with my lower half, dragging the length of my cock up the slope of Harry’s thigh, a fever pitch building at the base of my spine.
Even when I was worried about Harry keeping himself out of danger, I did well to remember that Harry specifically told me that he would be meeting with “someone” in the singular sense so obviously he wasn’t getting himself in trouble with a group of dangerous wizards alone.
This party was something that I had to sign up for, like a magically inclined signature that ensured that I would be attending this celebration so that the people who were throwing it would know that I wasn’t some fresh meat trying to get in and have a fun time. This party was solely for seventh and eighth years because we were old enough to get fucked up and take care of ourselves. The sign up papers were like a biohazard.
Sucking in a sharp breath, I tried encouraging myself to get situated on the seat in front of Harry, but before I could, in my moment of panicked movement without realizing what I was doing, it was as if my body decided to take matters into its own hands and I noticed that I had bunched up the material at the front of my skirt and with my trembling hands, lifted it an inch or so up, the fabric running up the bare skin of my thighs before my brain could click onto what action my body was going through.
“What’s your favorite smell?” My words came out with a curious tint, my eyebrows rising up in a question as Harry let out a languid grunt, like some slumbering predator, his eyes searching my face as he pushed himself off of the edge of the counter to slip himself into the V of my thighs after settling the plate I had on my lap on the counter to my right, his body looming over mine and the heat of his skin touching the cool of my own.
When Harry inched his lips closer to Kikue’s exposed, slender neck, his gaze started to slide away from mine with a flash of that magnetizing sadistic shade of ruby turning into a drowning splurge of
Blaise and Pansy both often took great amazement at the color of my hair, usually whining and groaning about how absurdly bright my hair was. It had an odd ivory tone, the color unnatural in its pearl tinge. My hair was ridiculously pale, often falling into a chaotic state or turning pin straight depending on the amount of moisture in the air during the day, but I enjoyed it’s weird shade, especially after I step out of the shower and watch it practically glimmer beneath the fluorescent bulbs from how light my hair was.
Zereth had weakened over the expanse of the time I've spent down here, them feeding me and doing the work that was most likely given to them at the same time taking a toll on their body.
Rolling my shoulders back in a minutely shift, I let the quiet hearing charm reverberate with a chant from the inside of my head, echoing forth and non-verbally splaying out into the open as I felt the deep seated sadistic magic I’ve learned to cultivate over years of practice fester from within my stomach and seep out through the pores of my flesh to shoot forward towards Draco and Caetia’s space.
Before I could turn around and face the person with the oddly familiar, feminine drawl, I was grabbed at over my upper arm, nails blunting into my clothed flesh as I felt the dizzying sensation of an apparition suck me into its energy streamed portal. The significant
In that moment Harry should've known that I didn’t give a rat’s ass about him torturing some demon that kept me captive for well over a month almost.
I was internally drowning in sexual frustration while Harry looked like he was not bothered at all by our lack of intimacy.
I was speaking before my mind could catch up to the words escaping my moving mouth. “I-I-I’m sorry. I just wanted to go out and have some
.” I mumbled beneath my breath, urging myself on to keep trodding across the wet, granite floor with the naked soles of my feet as I approached the vine like ladder and hefted up my right leg to fit the tops of my toes into the dewey green shrubs with a light gasp escaping the moist of my lips.
But dancing, well, I mean, I’ve often done that in the lone presence of my apartment where I knew people wouldn't be watching me and I could be myself. To do so in front of bystanders made my hands tremble more in anxiety, although it was a curious, adrenaline drugging sort of nervous perpetuation that stilted inside of me.
Harry’s skin was smooth to the touch, heated like a flickering flame catching alight on a spillage of gasoline. His skin was burning compared to the cool temperature of my own.
Looking back at Harry, I saw him lift my arse up into the air, making the curve of my spine dip down and leave my lower half suspended with the arch of my back pronounce and my hard prick dangling between the spread of my legs. The assassin released my hips to grab onto the front of my thighs and without further warning, spread my legs apart, easing my limbs away from one another as he settled my the thighs over the meat of his burning ones.
My head lifted up off of the ground from where I laid limp across the floor to snap it back in unadulterated striking bliss as I let out a small squeak like small moan, my hair falling backwards to cascade over the sweat that covered in a thin sheen over the tops of my curved back, bum bouncing as well as my lax limbs, over the wet countenance of the granite floor while I shivered in the wake of my ecstasy.
My voice seemed to have left me as I tried to breathe steadily and calm both my heart and boner down.
My heart was beating erratically beneath my chest, the admission of my liking for Harry spewing forth out of my mouth with a raw, indignant sharp hue of my voice that shook in its tone as I shivered in the exposing of my thoughts that I wanted to keep to myself but didn’t have the strength to contain anymore.
And I about choked on my own spit when I heard the familiar static intro and drumming beat to Nine Inch Nails’ song “Closer” at the same time Harry let the back of his head thud softly against the back of the wooden chair as he tipped his chin up at me. His jaw tensed enticingly as Harry had the nerve to let his magnetizing mouth turn up into a salacious dark smirk when he mouthed the song's first sentence of lyrics to me, lips forming around the words “you let me violate you.”
I went to lift my head up to see the assassin’s face, only to be grabbed at the sides over the still harsh expanding of my ribs from my deep, worn out breaths by the man with his hot hands, plucked off of his lap like a rag doll and dropped precariously over the silken sheets of the bed.
“Let me ask you again, just one more time. You going to be a good boy, Malfoy?” Harry’s deep rumbling timbre of a voice seemed to have slipped along with the heat of his magic around my groin and arse, confining me.
I found myself being lifted up on weakened limbs by the scorching touch of Harry’s hand grasping my upper arm in a vice grip, the lax of my frame tugged up roughly from the solace of the bed while my eyes wandered about with hysteric horror as I scrambled on the two clumsy, stricken feet of mine, trying to keep up with Harry’s long legged strides.
Harry grinned up at me slowly, his smile dirty and sensuous as the red in his gaze seemed to shadow over the green while he stared up at me with his lids lowered over his eyes charmingly.
Granger snapped her gaze my way at the same time Potter slowly dragged his towards my figure standing awkwardly in the hallway entrance. My cheeks grew immediately red from remembering our encounter just a few minutes ago, causing my heart to pick up its rate and my nervous gaze to slide over to Granger whose eyebrows were raised in a placating, cool gesture.
What if the Gryffindor’s dark magic powers only made him like me because of my own magic while Harry himself didn’t notice?
Harry let out a rumble of a hum, making me cut off my own words, the sound harsh and wicked as it sunk into my abdomen and shook my body from inside and out, my frame giving a subtle jolt at the sound as I felt a rush of heat gather more in my gut and spread out over my lower half, the Gryffindor’s voice resonating around the forest surrounding us and the silent, deserted road. “No. What you’re going to do is spread those long legs of yours and straddle the seat in
Because there were times, when we were in Hogwarts, where I’d find him curled up against one of the many large floor to ceiling window sills in the building, where he’d let his guard down in the latest of nights. Draco would either be reading a book, doing his schoolwork, or staring out the damn window with the moon playing across the soft of his striking features. Those were the times where he’d let himself be vulnerable. I’d watch him cry silently to himself, his small body trembling when he figured no one was watching.
“I’m here to bring you to a man who runs an underground wizard assassination facility that no one knows about unless we want them to. What you’re seeing around you are a bunch of people who have trained themselves with their blood and bones to be the most highly wanted killers known to both human and wizard worlds. You’re here because of a sticky situation that requires this facility to take you in and make sure you’re not dead by the end of the day. You won’t know of the location this company resides, nor will you ever know. Our boss will be explaining more about the problem you’re in once he gets here, so why don’t you just stand there and take in what I’ve just told you as we wait.” Granger’s words seemed to be rehearsed, long and drawn out with a dull murmur as if she had recited this sort of explanation over and over again to countless others.
My lips parted on a gasp of a breath leaving the strain of my lungs, heart humming wildly beneath my chest.
then, releasing an obscured, slick sound that made my body burst with heat when I felt Harry’s fingers embed themselves deeper into the skin of my bum, careless and brutal, eliciting saltine water to gather up in the corners of my eyes and shadowing my vision over as I blinked rapidly in a shocking aroused haze from the pain inflicted grab the assassin branded into the flesh of my arse, a delicious hurt that I fucking quaked in.
as the wobbling of his bottom lip poked out the slightest bit and that pretty little wine red flush of his gathered up his slender, long neck and over his delicately defined cheeks.
The odd sensation that roiled within the pit of my stomach whenever I apparated started to ease away as I shook my head the slightest bit, clearing my peripheral view by every passing second as I felt Harry’s hot arm press flush beneath the plush of my bum with each minute movement he made as we touched ground from the teleportation.
I literally did nothing to the woman yet her body was practically vibrating with anger towards my person from where she stood as she eyed me with her almost black eyes. Yes I was an ex death eater, and I was used to the hate from others, but the Asian was emitting her loathe too much and it felt
Narrowing my now crystal clear eyes, I snapped my head down to stare at the top of Harry’s head, the tousled strands of his pitch black hair gleaming beneath the light fluorescent brightness beaming down on both of us.
And then Harry caught my bewildered gaze with the calm set of his emerald orbs that darkened like the deepest forest green, his smirk sharpening into a brutal magnetizing grin before he shoved two fingers into my mouth, slipping something jelly like on my tongue with a flick of his hand while the smooth pads of his fingers pressed down on my tongue at the same time his thumb reached down to press the tip of the appendage into the bottom of my chin to tilt my head back and force me to swallow around the thing he put into my mouth, my throat convulsing around the object I swallowed easily without thinking twice about what Harry had just put into my mouth.
Nibbling on the insides of my cheeks, I stepped out of my room to walk through the wide hallway and into the living area. My eyes caught sight of Granger with her arms crossed over her ample chest talking to Potter in hushed tones beneath her breath, the glossy curve of her lips barely moving with her quick stream of words.
Rain beats a steady rhythm against the stained glass windows in the dormitory. Harry adjusts the blankets on his bed, pulling them up around his waist. Already the chill of winter creeps into the castle during the night, and Harry shivers.
Harry looks at her, startled. She shrugs, not wanting him to search for meaning where there is none, even though she wasn’t sure why she told him that.
Younger Hermione sits erect and focused, one hand holding a quill and the other smacking Ron in the back of the head to pay attention. Shockingly, Harry has shifted forward in his chair, eyes alert and almost burning with intensity, locked on Professor Slughorn and drinking up every word.
“I’m going to marry Luna Lovegood,” Ginny says abruptly. He goes quiet, his face startled. “We decided on the trip. I’m telling you this because you deserve to know. You’re my best friend, and I want you to share in my happiness, because I am really fucking happy. And I also could not live without her. I love her more than anything in this world. I would
“What things?” Harry asks, pleading, placing his hands on Draco’s cheeks, forcing him to look at Harry. Draco stares at Harry longingly, then coldly looks away.
“First, I must acknowledge the pain and suffering we all have endured these last few―nay, many years―by the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many in this room have lost family and friends fighting against the hatred and evil that he spread. But it is in trying times as these when friendship, patience, and understanding are most needed. That is why I have decided not to cancel this year’s education at Hogwarts, despite the horror that these walls have seen so very recently. The Battle was won, but the scars of the war still need time to heal.
Harry already knew Draco’s morning routine, his quick, steaming shower, the short review of homework and test material in his bath robes, and then pulling on his outfit for the day (picked the night before).
“Oh.” Pansy deflates a little, then that familiar worry clenches at her stomach. Why is Hermione interested in Draco? Has something happened at the Ministry? Did Hermione find out he was illegally brewing Potter that potion?
Then Draco was pulling away, and he felt Draco’s mouth on his stomach where his shirt had lifted up. Each kiss was the brief fluttering of a butterfly’s wings, trailing down his skin. A pause. Harry’s hands were released, and fingertips brushed against his crotch, achingly hard inside his briefs.
“It doesn’t work like that,” Draco says, and he has his wand out protectively, feet set in a dueling stance. “Put down your wand, Harry.”
Because she saw him that night, looking at Draco. Those two boys, looking at each other. Two boys destined to hate each other; two boys destined to fall in love regardless. Perhaps because of it.
“Hello Granger,” Pansy says with her red-lipped smile. “Were you, perchance, about to go up to my office?”
“Oh that’s not too bad,” Ron says, grinning. He slings an arm around Hermione’s shoulders, who rolls her eyes. “Wanna get cuffed, babe?”
“Oh.” Draco reminds himself that he doesn’t care about Harry’s life anymore, and should stop asking questions lest Harry gets the wrong idea. “Lead the way, then.”
“I suppose,” Longbottom says quietly, sounding oddly solemn, “she means us not to forget, but to forgive.”
Draco stares at her silently for a very long moment, at first stunned but then gradually resigned, even grateful. Then he nods.
Harry’s heart aches, wishing he could explain, but knowing he can’t. He looks down, his face burning at what he doesn’t know, even about his deepest, most delicate desires. “I wish you wouldn’t.”
“Already hard?” Draco murmured. Harry blushed, embarrassed. Draco kissed him again, slipping his tongue inside Harry’s mouth, his fingers finding Harry’s belt. But before he could get them open, Harry pushed Draco’s hand away.
At first, nothing. Then, lights, red and green and gold, glittering against the walls. Hermione squeezes Ron’s hand, and he squeezes back.
She turns, pats down her hair, and straightens her suit. Draco stands near the door, the floor plans in hand. Hermione smiles, though all she can see now is a younger Draco, looking at Harry thoughtfully in a Potions classroom.
Hermione looks at her sympathetically. “We just thought you should know. You’ve always known how to deal with him, and he just won’t listen to anything we say.”
“Ron? Hermione?” Harry calls from the living room. He dusts some remaining Floo powder off his cloak, pausing when he hears voices in the kitchen.
Hermione shivers as the words are echoed like a dark and dangerous enchantment. And for a moment, she understands everything perfectly.
“Nearly,” she says, scanning the list. “What worries me is that seven of those fourteen classes which in past years were mandatory core classes have now been labeled ‘highly selective’ and optional.”
Light fragments in the air. Draco moves quicker and Harry’s head falls back, silently, like a gasp, the axis of his body pulled like a magnet towards Draco and the rhythm of heat on heat on heat. His breath stutters in his chest, rattling like gusts against windowpanes. His legs shake and his mouth falls open, helpless, as his hands grasp at nothing, the white ceiling swinging wildly overhead, the light flashing in his eyes, flashing like a lightning bolt right through him, sends spasms of pleasure throughout his body.
“I guess that’s true enough,” Ginny says, looking away from Harry’s probing gaze. “I think it would be the biggest mistake.”
Harry threw his head back in exhaustion, panting, his curls damp on his forehead. He felt the absence of Draco’s mouth, and then he was lying beside him again, his body radiating heat in waves.
But Draco still loves every moment of it, the burning pleasure, the way Harry says his name, eyes shut tight, burying his face in Draco’s neck, lying still, so still, after they finish, as if afraid any slight movement will make it all a dream.
But still, she must go. Time has run out, and her stay here is winding down to a close. She feels it in her bones, just as the animals know when winter is coming, and so they hunker down, curling in on themselves for warmth.
Harry waits a few minutes for her to leave the common room and disappear up the stairs to the girl’s dormitory. Then he checks his Map.
Harry snarls, lashing the curse so that it splits and sends sliced up ropes flying behind him and scattering across the floor. He barely glances at them before lifting his hand as if to cast a wandless spell, though Draco can hardly dare to believe he has the power and control.
Harry twirls the ends of Draco’s hair between his fingers. Another hand skates along his spine, brushing the soft skin below his hips that always makes his abdomen tense with a new pulse. It’s something Draco noticed about Harry these past few weeks, being his
“Nonsense,” she says. “We shall see each other at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, not to mention the several classes we share together.”
Something inside Harry protests violently against this, a wild beating of the fists against the prison of his heart, and his arms tighten their hold around Draco subconsciously. He hates that the thought crossed Draco’s mind, that he spoke those words out loud, that he’s now heard them and can never unhear them.
“Sleeping.” She eyes him, smirking, her right hand falling on the opening of her robe and revealing just enough to confirm that she has nothing underneath.
Harry relented. Too easily. He closed the door behind him with a gentle click and walked over to the side of the bed that Draco was not sitting on. Then he slipped under the covers. They were already warm.
Draco moves to leave, and Hermione smiles apologetically. They walk out of the kitchen together, and Harry sits back down slowly. Ron sighs.
Together they rush back up the tunnel and out into the hallways, breathing harshly and never slowing down until they come back to the doors of the Great Hall, hiding in a dark alcove narrow enough that it could have been the archway of a door, Draco’s back against the wall and their chests pressed up against each other. Harry can feel Draco’s breath in the scarce space between them.
He looks up at her, and he knows his sadness is reflected in her dark eyes. “I can’t. I never will.” She nods, slowly, understanding him better than anyone else. She was there, after all.
“I can’t stop thinking about it,” Harry says in a low voice, ignoring what Draco said. His grip on Draco’s arm tightens. “I can’t stop thinking about you.”
“I suspect,” Miss Granger says, her voice darker now, “he is referring to Death Eaters and those associated with them who received a lighter sentence on account of, well, special circumstances.”
“You heard me.” Pansy sighs, tired of beating around the bush. “She hasn’t figured it out yet, but Hermione’s the brightest witch of the century. Sooner or later she’ll connect those dots and you will have some explaining to do.”
“That’s exactly why we should,” Ginny whispers back, grinning. They slide back an old tapestry that reveals a rotting wooden door. Ginny scrunches her nose. “Gross.”
Harry smiles fondly. This has always struck Ginny as odd; he’s always had a soft spot for Luna, even before Ginny noticed her. “How is Luna, by the way?”
Harry sighs. “I suppose I could have, but I thought perhaps Herbology would be useful for aurors. At least for me, as I am already familiar with the Muggle world.”
He doesn’t like to think of what he would have done if Ginny wasn’t there to hold him at night, to kiss him with her sweet lips and melt away the nightmares.
“My dreams. I...I have the same one, all the time. I know it’s not from Voldemort, somehow, or any dark magic, but still. I can’t tell if it’s normal or not.”
Tonight Slytherin is hosting. Harry feels less apprehension than perhaps is expected for such a notorious House. His reasoning is that the aftermath of the war and the mass arrests and raids from the Ministry have subdued any desire to take revenge, though in some cases more on account of fear rather than change of heart.
“Do not judge him so harshly,” Mr Weasley says wisely, his eyes clouded. “After all, the Wizengamot has already done so.”
She pauses on her way to the stairs, her mind already drifting to long blonde hair, blue eyes, and soft, searching hands; the hands of an angel, of a rosy-fingered dawn. Harry’s voice breaks through like a blade cutting water.
One day they hated each other to the point of dueling, and the next that hatred seemed to boil over into something else, something no less intense, but no longer hostile.
“I wouldn’t bother,” Harry says loudly, and the man turns around, puzzled and annoyed. When Draco sees Harry his eyes go wide, and then he blushes. “He only likes the taste of wine that’s too expensive for you to buy him.”
Ron sets the kettle on the stove, turning up the heat. He looks over his shoulder at Harry, sitting silently on the couch, staring into space. Recently he’s been very out of it, staying in his apartment more often, rarely stopping by for dinner, and when he does acting quietly and reserved like this.
She watches Harry carefully, but he makes no movement signaling he even noticed Draco’s arrival. Younger Harry stays stoic and still, and Draco whispers intently with Pansy, whose eyes flicker over to Harry almost too quickly for anyone in the memory to notice.
When she’s alone, Hermione’s smile fades, and her mind returns to the memory, turning over every expression and every word she saw. Something wasn’t right in their argument, which at the time she had simply dismissed, writing it down to their boyhood rivalry.
The space between them suddenly shrinks. Harry hesitates, lowers his head, Draco shifts, rising, meeting him, and Harry shivers, right as their lips touch, awkwardly, closely, so closely, closer than ever.
“As long as I’m with you, I could never die,” Harry whispers, his eyes reflecting the warmth between them, before leaning in and kissing Draco again, shifting his weight so that Draco lies underneath him, Harry’s legs straddling his waist.
Harry doesn’t drink it until he’s under the covers, and from one blink to the next, he falls into a deep sleep.
“I felt betrayed,” Harry says, and his voice has a fresh honesty like it’s the first time he’s confessing these feelings to anyone. “I trusted him. I chose him. But when it came down to me or him, he chose himself.”
She doesn’t like to look at Harry’s face. He’s often pale for one moment, then flushed hot as if he’s caught a fever the next. His eyes are empty, void of emotion, like looking down a dark, dark tunnel.
“I love you.” Harry lifts Draco’s hand and kisses the knuckles. His eyes are a flaming green, the pupils black as death.
Ginny knows that Draco and Harry have been spending time together again recently, that much is certain. She had hoped that this time…
late at night. The end of the cigarette catches, and he flicks the lighter off, putting it away. He’s left in darkness.
Harry’s green eyes sparkle in the dim firelight. “There’s a dream I have over and over again. I’m on the Astronomy Tower, and I’m falling over the edge, like my—like Dumbledore did, that night. And then I wake up in another world, and I have everything I always wanted.” He looks almost dreamy, his mouth subconsciously lifting into a smile, and his eyes glazed over like he could see something Ron couldn't.
“What? Who? It’s not possible,” Hermione says, scrutinizing Harry’s face for any clue as to who this mystery love might be. But his face is as impenetrable as ever.
Slowly, blue and grey return to the world. Draco looks at him intently, questioning. Harry nods, struggling for breath. Then Draco’s frown lifts into a smile.
Harry couldn’t have possibly noticed, the transition from Malfoy to Draco too slow, an imperceptible change in the larger picture. He blamed it on sharing a dormitory, sitting next to Draco in potions, and always flying a few laps over the quidditch pitch at the same time.
Hermione glances at his black shirt which clings to his skin, and the dark jeans and slightly heeled boots. She raises an eyebrow. “A fun night?”
Harry takes a step closer, but Draco doesn’t back down. He looks at Harry with troubled grey eyes. “You don’t trust me anymore.”
They stare at each other for a long moment, before bursting into hushed laughter, Draco’s smile a warm crescent against Harry’s cheek.
Harry looks at her with a dangerous ferocity, understanding that she’s beginning to pick apart the riddle. “Hermione? What is it?”
Harry pulls him towards him and kisses him roughly on the lips, salty from his tears, unable to see Draco so distressed, wanting to make it stop, however he can. Draco yields slightly, his body relaxing against Harry’s mouth. He kisses Draco’s jaw, then his neck, murmuring against his skin, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.”
His words hurt Harry enough to stop walking, leaning against a nearby wall, but he finds the pain welcome, almost necessary, like taking a cold shower in the morning is both excruciating and yet the only way to wake up.
“Harry?” a voice calls out from far away. Harry jerks back, breathless. He doesn’t look at Draco, his face dark and storming.
“Deciding whether I should smoke or not,” Harry says with that peculiar honesty that provides absolutely no useful information, and in fact does not really answer the question. “You see, I quit when Rose was born.”
Sweet and sharp, like the wine. Harry slides an arm around Draco’s waist, a strong hand reaching behind and squeezing. A gasp from Draco only encourages Harry more, and dazedly, his pulse spiking, thudding in his brain right behind the temple, his hips aching to move, to arch against his solid, lean-muscled body, Draco melts into Harry’s arms.
At this Harry goes silent, then he calls over the bartender. “Two shots of vodka.” Draco raises his eyebrows, and Harry shrugs.
Draco nods wordlessly, and then the pressure on his arm is gone and Harry disappears around the corner of the bookshelf. When he’s gone, Draco takes a deep breath in, one hand on the nearby shelf for support. His mind whirls with a thousand thoughts he does not understand.
He feels torn in two directions, and only one holds his heart in a vice-like grip. Why is it that all the choices in his life feel like picking the lesser of two evils? After all, no matter how painful it is to love Harry in secret, it has always been much worse not loving him at all.
Hermione opens the bedroom door an inch, looking inside the darkness and trying to make out a sleeping Harry on the bed. Ron nudges her side, and she opens it all the way.
“Oh, piss off.” Ginny rolls her eyes, but there’s a serious set to her jaw. “I mean we’d be awful together. It’d never work, and people would just get hurt because of it.”
“I know,” Harry replies, and the memory of Dumbledore falling flashes through his mind, except this time it’s not Dumbledore, it’s him, falling and falling and falling, into another world.
Beside him, Draco adjusted himself in the bed, pulling the covers up over his chest. Harry stared at the ceiling, the peeling green wallpaper. He realized he was holding his breath, and tried to release it slowly.
“You’re fine fucking a Death Eater as long as no one knows about it, right?” Draco asks harshly, and Harry flinches. It brings a rush of satisfaction, almost triumph if he didn’t feel so hurt, that no one could quite pierce through his Chosen Boy facade except Draco. He alone possessed the power to bring Harry to his knees.
“Well, Harry was saying…” Hermione begins, then chews on her bottom lip, glancing at Harry who resolutely looks into the fire. “Harry?”
He sees Pansy move out of the corner of his eyes. She has her robe on, and she walks mechanically to the kitchen, perhaps for a glass of water. Harry’s stomach tenses anxiously. Draco shakes his head, as if to advise him to leave her alone.
“Oh I know for convention sake everyone will say Harry Potter but anyone with eyes and a little bit of courage will say that Blaise is far superior in looks and personality,” Pansy says confidently, examining her long nails which today are painted a bright blood red for the start of the Halloween season. She smirks when Draco scowls.
They were all on the couch, drinking wine, Pansy between them, the thin straps of her top slipping down her shoulders. Draco pressed his hand subtly on her thigh, so that she would know his thoughts, and she barely smiled, barely changed expression, and Harry remained ignorant, flushed from the wine, trying to pull his eyes away from the curve of Pansy’s neck, the delicate breadth of her collarbone.
He takes his Marauder's Map, pointing the tip of his wand at the blank parchment. He whispers, “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.” In the dim light of the moon through the windows, he can barely make out the map unfolding gently across the parchment.
The words stung Draco like a slap, and he flinched. He started for the door in a mechanical movement of limbs, as if on autopilot, his face blank. He had lost not only the battle but the war as well, and like a good soldier, Harry knew it too. And like a good Malfoy, Draco knew when to surrender.
“Do not trouble yourself,” Weasley says flippantly, though he does not meet Harry's eyes. “It is very common for a witch or wizard’s magic to cease working properly for a period of time. A second cousin of mine a few years ago experienced trouble with her magic. She could hardly cast even the simplest spells without either injuring herself or others.”
And she remembers the darkness in Harry’s voice, that night on the Astronomy Tower. That night when the world she knew both clicked into place and shattered before her eyes.
“Dinner is ready,” she says abruptly, clearly offended by Harry’s reaction. “We should set the table. Draco will be down any minute.”
“Breathtaking,” Pansy says, that rush of satisfaction when she gets an outfit down perfectly; the sharp, plunging neckline that is a breath shy of too much and how the color brings out that rich tone of brown that she has always found so beautiful in Hermione’s complexion.“Has anyone ever told you that blue is your color?”
“Thought about what?” Harry asks in a strained voice. Draco leans even closer, his mouth brushing Harry’s cheek as he whispers in his ear.
Then Harry climbs over him, lowering his hips carefully, his hands grasping Draco’s hips, sliding around his shoulders, his head falling into Draco’s neck, kissing him there over and over, each time his hips rock forward, carrying him over Draco’s body.
Hermione just doesn’t understand. If Harry wanted so badly to catch Malfoy, why shy away from the chance simply because he’d have to speak with his father? She’s definitely missing something glaringly obvious.
Draco stirs at his serious tone, and Harry’s arms tighten their hold around him. “That’s interesting, because for me it’s the opposite. With you I feel real, and the rest of my life is a nightmare.”
Ginny squares her shoulders, facing him. “If there’s a war, then there’s no one I’d rather be fighting beside than you.”
And it’s like dragging Harry back to reality. He reluctantly looks at Hermione, then Ginny. When he notices everyone looking at him, Harry blinks slowly, then shrugs.
“Quite the reader, are you?” Harry comments, and Draco curses to himself before turning around. To his dismay, Harry is leaning against the book shelf, looking at Draco with eyes like burning coals, as if his gaze could burn a path through Draco’s mind.
She puts out her cigarette when she hears footsteps on the stairs, and walks back inside the kitchen.
“This year is a stepping stone, a time of healing and also a time of growth. It is my mission that upon receiving your diplomas, you are most prepared for the life you have chosen. Now, are there any questions?”
He hunches over, the heels of his palms pressed against his eyes, barely containing his sobs. Ginny wants to comfort him, but she knows with her unswerving certitude that this is something Harry must do on his own.
Draco laughs, but it is harsh and Harry flinches.  He feels his body hum at the reaction. “No, I’ll leave that to the Dark Lord. But perhaps I could hurt you enough to land you in St. Mungo’s for a few weeks—until Christmas break, at least. I don’t need much longer than that. Or maybe a
They take staircase after staircase, and Harry begins to wonder where they are going. Finally they reach the metal steps that lead to the Astronomy tower. Harry clenches his Cloak closer, praying to Merlin that he’s still small enough that his shoes won’t peek out from under.
The question nearly makes Harry squirm in his seat as if Snape were about to lecture him. And why should Hermione lecture him about his relationships? It’s not as if her and Ron are perfect, with the unplanned pregnancy after Hermione began working at the Ministry. But Hermione is his friend, and she only wants him to be happy, and, after all, she’s probably right.
“Blessed,” Ginny finishes quietly, her mind which has always been a whirlwind of chaos has settled like dust floating down to the ground. “I know. Thank you. And Luna, it means—”
“Sorry, students, I was just talking to Professor Dumbledore about...about...well, it doesn’t matter what, let’s get to the lesson!” He smiles anxiously and then turns around, fiddling with a few textbooks on his desk.
“Now you’re somewhat presentable,” Draco mutters, to which Harry rolls his eyes, but follows after him nonetheless.
if it only exists behind closed doors, in lost rooms tucked deep in an enchanted castle. When it comes down to it, and they face the world instead of each other, will Harry still take his hand?
“Sorry, but I can’t tell you.” He sighs, but she can tell it is not genuine, like he does not feel sorry at all. “It wouldn’t do any good. Better not even to talk about it, as it only brings me pain.”
“Don’t move!” Draco shouts, pointing the wand at the intruder, a tall figure in a dark cloak, the hood obscuring the face in shadow.
Draco, on the other hand, didn’t fare as well as he had hoped. He thought his power and status as Pureblood would bring a flock of followers. Instead, his opposition to the charming, well-known Boy Who Lived would bring him more hate than fear. He was left with a few loyal followers in Slytherin, but other than that, he was unpopular and shunned.
Draco’s face turns very serious. He turns around, kneeling on the couch, which Harry mimics so they are eye-level. Then Draco takes Harry’s hand and guides it to his chest.
“Were you and Harry ever...friends at Hogwarts?” Hermione asks, hesitantly. She somehow can’t imagine it, but it’s worth a try. Draco flinches, then smiles tightly.
Ginny sits up at this, but only Hermione notices, with Harry and Ron too busy staring each other off. Should Hermione intervene? For some reason, a small voice inside her head tells her to stay silent and watch it play out.
“Well, it is understandable. Professors of core classes under normal circumstances only teach First through Seventh Years, but this year they will also teach Eighth Years. Thus, they have lowered the number of students allowed to take their classes.”
Soon Harry falls asleep, Draco's head on his chest like an anchor, sinking him down to the bottom of the sea.
“At the time,” Hermione says in a low voice, “I had thought it was about Dumbledore. But it wasn’t. That’s clear enough to me now.”
“What were you expecting?” Harry asks, in such a casual, innocently curious way that for a moment Draco is fooled that he hadn’t picked up on Draco’s meaning.
“I never said you were,” Harry mutters, already forgetting what he said to make Draco so fussy, his attention lowering to Draco’s mouth, slightly parted and ever so close. Draco’s eyes flutter shut, and Harry notices his breaths come out short. Draco curls his arm slowly around Harry’s neck, like he’s still afraid that Harry might resist him.
Draco swiftly pulled his shirt off instead of replying, and Harry’s mind went blank, and all he could do was make a weak sound at the back of his throat in question, eyes trained on somewhere right next to Draco’s face.
“...acting like a child…” An insult Snape should take to his own heart, in Harry’s opinion. “...your
Harry has never been close to Dumbledore, that much is apparent, but still. He’s already lost his biological parents, would he be so willing to lose another, even if their relationship is strained?
Perhaps it didn’t start so much as blind side Harry, a hit that came when he least expected, and had received no warning.
Harry shares a silent look with Weasley and Miss Granger. Then the Eighth Years are dismissed, and the Headmistress leads those of Gryffindor beyond the gates and across the lawn, where a small white tent with a Gryffindor flag flying at the top looks over the lake, glittering under the moonlight.
But Harry barely spares them a glance, his eyes trained on the floor once more, apparently deep in thought elsewhere, brooding over some trouble or other that Hermione and Ron can hardly begin to fathom.
about these letters and have not deigned to mention it to me? After all, am I not in charge of these children’s happiness?”
“But don’t you get it, Harry?” Draco turns, letting his cigarette fall to the ground and crunching it under the heel of his boot. “I’ve already won.”
“First, let us finish our schooling,” Harry says dryly, the overwhelmingly lovesickness of his friends bringing him out of his reverie, and they walk together through the platform wall, with Miss Weasley and Mr and Mrs Arthur Weasley behind them.
Hermione knows exactly who she needs to talk to. But she sighs irritably, crossing her arms, because there’s just one small problem.
“But don’t you want to date someone? Call someone your own?” Harry asks, and the heat in his voice scares Ginny.
“Harry,” Ginny says with a sigh, “is my best friend. I will always love him. And I know he loves me. But…”
Harry waits and waits and then suddenly Draco cries out, pulsing and shaking above him, and Harry holds him steadily until Draco collapses in his arms, defeated, a victor. They find each other’s arms, find the warmth and solidity of each other’s chests, each other’s legs like vines mapping the forest floor, tangled on the couch.
“You’re still young, Harry,” Ron says awkwardly, feeling the dark turn this conversation has taken. “I was just wondering if you were even planning to settle down. I mean, you have time, but…”
“Oh she doesn’t mind, do you, Pansy?” Draco asked, looking up. Harry snapped his head around to see Pansy with a bottle of wine in one hand, and wearing nothing except for a black lace thong.
She spots him across the common room, sitting on the couch next to Hermione, with Ron spread out messily on the ground by the fire. It’s their designated spot to hatch plans that nobody asked them to make. Ginny does not feel like listening tonight, or any night recently.
Draco goes downstairs, hyper aware that he’s still in his clothes from the night before. Merlin, what he’d do for a shower. He needs to get back home, desperately.
Harry stares at Draco, his lips parted. He takes in all of Draco, drinking up the sight of him, knowing that this
Draco is at his best half-drunk on wine. His cheeks flush, his eyes brighten, and his body becomes languid and loose. Harry never knows what to expect from him when he gets like this.
Malfoy has Harry pinned against the wall by his wrist, which is still tied, their champagne bottle lying half finished on the ground beside them, and one of Malfoy’s knees is pressed between Harry’s legs. Harry has the same miserable expression on his face, but Hermione realizes now that it’s not at all on account of hatred but…
“If anything I’m angry,” Draco says, his voice flat, and the words ring true as he says them, though they had never crossed his mind before. “Angry that I thought this time around would be different. Angry that my life always gives me hopes just to crush them.”
Hermione nods, pensive. “Yes, I’m almost positive. And something must’ve happened recently. Again. It’s hard to tell, though. They are both very reserved.”
The entire compartment goes silent, even Weasley and Miss Granger stop their bickering and everyone besides Longbottom looks at Miss Lovegood and Harry apprehensively. Harry wonders if Miss Lovegood knows about his uncontrollable magic. Would he fall to disgrace so soon? The thought makes him tremble.
Harry walks in and a House Elf appears on the counter with a pop. It’s Lucy, a small Elf with large eyes and wrinkly skin. She’s old but still spritely. Harry has known her all his life. Indeed, in many ways, she raised him.
“Sleeping Draught,” Harry says quietly. He pulls his hand back, and turns to Draco. “But I’m afraid to take any more. You see, I was quite dependent during school, and I haven’t touched a drop since.”
“Tom stole from kids at the orphanage. He tortured people, Ginny.” But he doesn’t sound enraged about it, only flat and disdainful. She feels miserable.
Soon the dinner and probable awkwardness can't be avoided, and everyone sits down on the magically extended dining table. Harry sits between Ginny and Hermione, with Luna beside the former and Ron beside the latter. Molly and Arthur take the head and tail of the table, with the rest of the Weasleys and other guests scattered throughout with their partners and plus ones.
“The Map never lies.” Harry squeezes his eyes shut, a hand raking through his hair. “I just don’t get it. One second he’s there, the next, gone, as if the Map lost connection to him somehow. But where could he have gone? Some secret passageway the Map doesn't know about?”
Harry opens the door to the shop hesitantly, wondering if he was right in what he saw. The inside is empty upon first glance, but then Harry sees Mrs Malfoy sitting in the corner of the room. She rises when he notices her.
“I suppose so,” Weasely mumbles, clearly not satisfied. Miss Granger blushes profusely. Harry looks away. He does not understand why they tiptoe so much around the obvious.
“Me too.” He looks down at his clothes, and grimaces. “I had a bit too much to drink and—let’s just say I didn’t wake up in my own bed. But the moment I saw the time I rushed over here.” He looks at the mug of coffee in his hand, frowning. “Clearly.”
A flicker of approval appears and quickly fades in Hermione’s eyes. “I would like to buy a pantsuit. Something functional but still…”
Harry smiles and it’s twisted with bitterness. Draco’s heart pangs. “But that’s exactly what I want. I don’t want to be
The doors swing open, rattling on the frame. Harry rushes in, disheveled, and sits down at an empty seat near the back, only a few seats down from Draco. Hermione and Ron sigh, shake their heads, but Draco sees them smile at him, their eyes all fond. Draco just doesn’t understand it.
“What do you want? Do you want me to go on the radio and announce that we’re together? It’s nobody’s business what I do in private,” Harry said coldly.
“And I know you have a little...obsession with Malfoy,” she continues hesitantly. He tenses. His mouth works, as if he’s considering what it would be like to confess his love for Draco, but then his mouth settles into a frown, and she sighs.
“But I don’t understand, darling,” Pansy says in her posh accent, lounging by the fireplace in black knee high stockings and an oversize green sweater that spells SLYTHERIN in silver thread. If she pinned her short, glossy black hair with green snake clips, she’d look just as she did in school.
But nothing ever came of it. Harry would never ask him out. His friends encouraged him to make the first move, but Harry refused. Harry might like Draco, but there was no way Draco liked Harry. He was a Gryffindor, Draco was a Slytherin. It was impossible.
He hears Hermione snort ungraciously behind him. “Oh, but how could I forget! Ginny and Dean are dating now. Aren’t they a charming couple?”
“Bits and pieces,” Draco says, then pauses. “I can remember...the bar, and coming here. It gets a little hazy then, but I remember...we kissed.”
Draco is a wonderful kisser. She knows this, having kissed him before, but it is apparent even while looking at him kiss. His jaw is sharp against Harry’s face, and she can see his tongue slip inside Harry’s mouth. Draco is beautiful like this, his angular cheekbones, his throat gleaming in the firelight, his pale hair curling at the nape of his neck.
“Whoa,” Ron says, breathless. His eyes are wide as he takes all of Hermione in, and out of the corner of her eyes she glimpses what he sees in the mirror, the way the white lace leaves nothing to be guessed, the way the delicate straps outline her soft curves and trace a path across her most sensitive skin, the way her breasts—which she has most recently been self conscious of ever since Rose’s birth—spill from the thin bralette in full, lush crescent moons.
“How do I know you won’t tell Dumbledore about me?” Draco asks, and he tries to hide the shakiness in his voice.
“Mr Potter, it is a pleasure to see you again,” Miss Lovegood says in her airy voice. “I was afraid you would not come back.”
They kiss one last time, sweetly, before Draco settles his head on Harry’s stomach, still breathing fast, still flushed and vibrant and alive. Harry traces patterns on Draco’s skin, and it spells out love.
When she enters the house, the first thing Ginny hears is a baby screaming. She grimaces, then continues walking into the living room, where Hermione and Ron try to soothe a very upset Rose, whose bib is stained with what Ginny hopes is apple sauce.
Ginny walks over to Harry, leaning down to kiss his cheek. “And don’t be ashamed to love him, Harry,” she says softly, only for him to hear. She straightens up and leaves to the girl’s dormitory before Harry can respond.
Harry looks sharply over his shoulder, arms gone still around Draco, and sees Katie Bell from the Gryffindor Quidditch team staring at them in shock. Harry looks at Draco, who looks back at him with wild eyes before whipping his wand out and pointing it at Katie before she has time to react. Harry doesn’t make any move to stop him.
He doesn’t look nervous, which only makes Harry more nervous. Harry hangs his coat and scarf by the door while Draco puts the flowers in a white vase and fills it with water. He places the vase on the dining table. Harry stands awkwardly in the middle of the apartment, hands by his sides.
Harry grips the front of Draco’s robes and roughly draws him closer, silencing his protests with an unyielding kiss. And it’s like water breaking through a dam; the tension drains from Draco’s body like he’s taken off all his armor, leaning pliantly into Harry’s touch, his mouth melting like butter against Harry’s tongue.
When it’s only them, and even Hermione and Ron say their goodbyes while casting worried glances towards Harry, Ginny decides to break the silence. “I think it’s time to say goodbye.”
His whole body stays at rest until Draco sits up again, then Harry’s pulling him toward his chest again, Draco’s entire body over his on the couch, kissing him, not a care in the world, his limbs languid, his skin hot and tender, where each touch from Draco’s fingers is like a spark against stone.
He pulls away, and she looks up at him, almost pleading, her breasts bared before him like an offering.
Harry turns and watches with horror as Katie suddenly goes still, her whole body going limp, before moving slowly towards them, taking the box from Draco’s hand. She then walks sluggishly out of the bathroom, her eyes glazed and glassy.
“Pardon me, Professor,” Draco says tightly, “but class has almost finished, and this potion is not on the syllabus. I think my classmates will agree with me that we would much rather hear the material that will be on the exam.”
If he gets in trouble because of that stupid Golden boy, Pansy will finish the job the Dark Lord could never get right herself.
Harry slides his hand across Draco’s skin, down his back, across his stomach, up his chest, tracing the bones, the muscles that tense under his touch. He loves touching Draco like this, with no intention of doing more, just a simple caress, watching Draco’s eyelids droop, then close, then flutter open again, a sleepy smile curving across his face.
If she knew then what she knows now, ten years later and in love with someone so very different, wondering if she will always be the one putting back together the broken pieces of a boy that only ever wanted his father to love him, only ever wanted to be normal and fall in love and live his life like a brilliant, bright star streaking across the sky, would she be so quick to hold out her arms, to love him so willingly and openly?
At first, Draco was worried that Harry and Pansy would hate each other. And it certainly appeared that way in the beginning. Pansy could not fathom why or how Draco came to be involved with the most Gryffindor of Gryffindors, the most Dumbledore-loving, Slytherin-hating, Savior-complex of all wizards. Harry just thought Pansy was rude.
“Merlin, Harry, is that all you can think about?” Ginny shakes her head, exasperated. Still, she misses banter like this, the natural energy that sparks between them. She knows she won’t find anything quite like it with anyone else. “I miss my best friend. I feel like ever since we ended that part of our relationship I ended up losing all of you.”
Pansy hums low, the sound vibrating throughout her body, and Harry works his mouth faster, the low sounds unwillingly escaping from her lips causing Harry’s head to spin, intoxicated.
He glances at her distractedly, then looks out the window above the sink, into the dark of the night as if he can see something there that she can’t. Maybe he can.
Glad to have a solid conversation topic, Ron rambles a rough summary of Harry’s thoughts on dating Ginny, concluding with, “In other words, he said no.”
Ginny glances worriedly at Harry standing along in the kitchen, leaning against the sink. This entire Christmas break he’s been suspiciously quiet and pensive, often sneaking away from Hermione and Ron to look into space, or to lay down and flip through his Map, though for the life of her Ginny doesn't know what he hopes to find there.
“I still want to see it. I was born here; this is where I spent my only time with my birth parents. I need to see where they were killed. If I see the destruction, maybe it will help me not to feel so numb. I’m losing steam, Dad. I don’t know how much longer I can handle searching for these Horcruxes, fighting just to stay alive. I’m so tired of it all; I just want to go to sleep and not wake up again.”
Severus brushed the hair back from Remus’ worried eyes, caressing his slightly stubbly cheek with the back of his hand. “Nothing will happen to him, Remus; I’ll make sure of that.”
Harry shivered at the very thought of being anywhere near Dementors again. He could remember perfectly the feeling of icy cold dread that wrapped around his heart and threatened to squeeze the very life from him whenever the damned creatures were near. “Yes, that’s all I really hear…and see.”
Severus was sitting up and halfway out of bed before Remus caught his arm, pulling him back down. “Is he alright? Was it another vision?” Severus asked, unaware of just how worried his voice sounded.
Remus had run as fast as he could, had given the counter-curse to the Healer’s in a desperate rush, and then he was told to sit back and wait. They couldn’t cast the counter-curse yet, and Remus was highly agitated. After all that searching, that desperation to get the counter-curse to the Healers, he still had to sit and wait. He wanted to be angry at the Healers, to rant and rave and tell them to do more, to save his husband, damn them! But he knew it was not their fault, they were doing all they could.
Harry smiled and nodded bemusedly, wondering what the Herbology Professor had to do with anything. He pulled away and headed towards the door of Scrivenshaft’s. “Come on; let’s see if we can find anything in here for Remus.”
“Ginny, I really need to go get some homework done before my Occlumency lesson, I’m sorry. Look, I told you I didn’t want to play reserve, so my answer is no,” Harry said coldly, getting highly annoyed with the way Ginny was talking about Draco; never mind that, this time last year, he would have agreed with her.
But now…now things were all amuck again. Ron had a lot of good qualities – he was brave, loyal, and honest – but he was also foolishly stubborn, and once he made up his mind, there was no changing it. His prejudices against Snape and generally all things Slytherin blinded him to a lot of things, but mainly how much his best friend needed him. If Harry was that important to him, Ron could have ignored it, he could have accepted Harry’s decisions to trust Snape and live down in the dungeons. So, maybe Ron Weasley wasn’t so loyal after all.
“Oh, I see. Well, I’m afraid a large party is out of the question due to the possibility of uninvited guests, but I might be able to convince Professor Dumbledore to allow you to speak to your friends through the floo network for a few minutes that day,” Severus said, feeling completely out of his element. He had no idea where these fatherly urges were coming from, but they were extremely strange to him.
Remus and Hermione pulled their cracker next, and a loud bang reverberated around the hall as Remus sprouted two rather large reindeer antler. Severus laughed even harder, garnering most of the table’s attention as they became entranced by his laughter; they’d never heard him actually
“It was my dad’s coming of age gift from my Gran. She saved it for me,” Neville explained, obviously quite fond of the watch as he stroked it absently.
Harry felt his heart sink. Draco must be completely devastated to have lost his father. And Tonks…she was so young. She and Charlie barely had any time together. It was so senseless and sickening. “It’s not fair…I did it, I killed him; I got rid of that bastard, but people still had to die. I hate this, Moony.”
The feeling of being an outcast was not one that Lucius was very familiar with. In any group, he had always been charismatic and charming enough to be accepted, to be included. Now, however, he felt he had no place, no direction. He was there for his son, and he was there to help the Order in whatever they may need, but he did not feel he had any business being where he was.
They both gasped in surprise as a loud explosion rent the air above them. Harry was glad for the vaulted ceilings as he watched Fred and George’s wet-start fireworks light up the room and reflect colourful patterns on Draco’s alabaster skin.
Harry had the mother of all headaches. He was half listening to the argument going on between Draco, Moody and Kingsley about finding a way around the twin wand cores, considering the Elder wand would be useless to Harry since Voldemort was its master. They’d come up with any number of plans that had holes, gaping ones that would most likely get multiple killed. Switching wands with others, disarming Voldemort to gain mastery of the Elder wand, using the Elder wand anyways; everything they came up with included a body count.
“Thank you for obliging us, Aurora,” Severus said, standing from the table in respect as the witch stood to leave.
“Enter,” came the answer after Harry lifted the phoenix shaped knocker and let it fall. He turned the ornate handle and entered the large office, spotting Fawkes’ perch right away as the baby phoenix crooned at him.
Severus was glaring over at his husband, who didn’t dare move from his submissive position, lest he upset the magic protecting the Horcrux. Stupid man. “You may not be able to retrieve your wand at all, Remus. Just because I remove the Horcrux, doesn’t mean the curse will end. What were you thinking?”
An hour later, Harry woke abruptly as someone slammed a book down on the table in front of him, making him jump nearly out of his seat. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and felt his insides go cold as he realized it was Ron.
“Remus had to go back to wherever Voldemort is. He said he was on a mission for the Order under disguise and that’s how he got to you. We cleaned your wounds and Remus healed them. You had a few broken bones, but Remus healed those, too. You have a concussion as well, so you should take it easy for awhile. Remus said he would inform the Order that I was here alone with you, but I haven’t heard anything from anyone since he left nearly four hours ago,” Harry said, a bit miffed that no one had bothered to come check up on him or Snape. Didn’t they even care that he had nearly died? Yes, Remus had sent Charlie to tell Dumbledore, but didn’t he want to check on Snape himself?
Harry was looking between his father and step-father, feeling quite uncomfortable. He didn’t know who to agree with, or what to do. He feared that if his father did question Lucius, he wouldn’t be very nice about it. However, Harry wasn’t all that concerned about Lucius being treated fairly. But he knew it would hurt Draco, and so he was torn.
“You’re just victimizing yourself now.” Pansy sighs. “Life doesn’t owe you any favors, Draco. You take what you can get, how you can get it.”
“Ronny baby, will you give me a kiss goodbye?” Lavender coos from beside Ron, her voice sweet but with an underlying urgency that makes Ron cringe. It’s not that he doesn’t like her constant doting and attention, but sometimes those very qualities reveal a deep insecurity that unsettles him.
“Yes, I’m going. Just going to check a chapter in the book one last time,” Harry lies, smiling. Hermione nods, but he knows she’s suspicious. Ever since he hinted at his secret relationship with Draco, she’s been silent but curious whenever he’s alone.
Harry plants feverish kisses along his neck, pulling Draco’s clothes and his own off hurriedly in between them, and then following the trail down his chest, across the delicate expanse of skin between his hip bones. With each kiss Draco’s body arches to meet Harry’s mouth, heat like he’s never known searing his skin, like a white hot band of pleasure that radiates and fragments into small gasps, eyes rolling back as the stars swing wildly overhead, his hands grasping fistfuls of grass beside him.
Draco had bit his lip. “It’s nothing. I should go.” He slid out of bed, avoiding Harry’s searching gaze, slipping on his clothes from the night before.
Miss Granger sighs, but says nothing more. They have had and will have this argument many times again.
“Hermione’s a romantic,” Harry interjects, his green eyes sparkling, as if he knows something about Hermione that Ron does not; this is probably true, as Ron has always been hyper aware of the closeness between Harry and Hermione that Ron has failed to achieve.
“I suppose if you are happy, my dear, that is all that matters,” Mrs Weasley says, though looking quite confused, as not even Percy had wanted to take more classes. “And you, Mr Potter?”
“Come here.” Harry opens his blanket with his arms, and like with all things Harry-related, Draco can’t resist his welcoming embrace. Draco scoots over, fitting himself against Harry’s body, the heat already spreading through Draco’s limbs as Harry wraps his blanket around them. “There. Not so bad now, eh?”
“Well, Draco and I were just talking about McGonagall as the new Headmaster,” Ron says through a mouthful of pie, oblivious to the new tension that sprung up with Harry’s arrival and Hermione’s urgent warning with her eyes. “Must be strict, no doubt. Dumbledore was the best, of course, and McGonagall can be right terrifying, but she’ll get the school in proper shape again.” He stops, looking at Hermione and chewing slowly, before looking at Harry and Draco, swallowing. “Is something wrong?”
A beam of light shines across Draco’s sleeping face, turning his eyelashes translucent, highlighting the fine veins in his cheekbones. Harry stares and realizes he is trying to memorize this face, those pale, sharp features, delicate and refined like a carved marble statue.
She remembers that secret love he’s harboring, but doesn’t dare bring it up. Instead, she asks if he’s sleeping well. He narrows his eyes at her.
“Harry.” Draco’s eyes plead with him, and Harry looks around, before slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. He kisses the crook of Draco’s neck, inhaling that familiar sharpness of cologne, a scent of wealth and dark money and bitter childhoods. “Harry,” Draco warns, for a completely different reason now.
He hears Ron sink into bed, the springs creaking. A few minutes later and snores erupt in the silence. Harry smiles briefly to himself, before swinging his legs over the side of the bed and leaving the dormitory, his bare feet padding softly on the warm wood.
“And what if I won’t?” Ron counters, and he can’t quite explain the blinding rage that seems to simmer beneath his skin except that it is directed entirely at Hermione for standing there with that smug superiority and righteous anger.
Vaguely, in some part of his mind, Harry knows his parents will be coming home soon. But if this affects him at all, it only serves to heighten his senses, each touch branding, Draco’s mouth moving against his, dizzying.
curse on Katie Bell and Harry letting it happen, Harry has been trying to understand the nature of this task the Dark Lord ordered him to complete. But Draco never tells him anything, asking Harry to trust him instead.
At that moment they walk past Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, where Harry glimpses a familiar face in the windows. He quickly excuses himself from the bickering pair on the pretense of quickly buying a new robe, but they hardly notice his escape, as they are so caught up in each other’s company.
“I wanted to.” Harry grabs the bottle of wine, a nice Burgundy that Draco has been fond of lately. He wonders how Harry knew. He pours two glasses, hands one to Draco, who takes it with averted eyes and a murmured thank you.
“Well, no matter,” Miss Granger says, trying not to roll her eyes, as that is considered highly improper. “The classes you may choose from are as follows:
Harry continues down the dark hallway, turning and taking two flights of stairs, jumping the last three steps when the staircase begins to move. He supposes he could have brought his Invisibility Cloak, but then again, what could anyone say if he got caught?
“You should tell him you won’t be a secret anymore! Back in school it was different, there was a war, and lives were at stake. But now? What excuse does he have?”
Elegant script covered his left abdomen. Colored flowers and symbols he didn’t recognize decorated his stomach and continued around the curve to his back. His arms were bare, save for the Dark Mark, which didn’t look quite as odd next to the other ink.
The Headmistress calls for them to come closer near the podium. They rise and settle at the front of the long tables. Malfoy sits as far away as possible. Professor McGonagall walks down from the podium and stands before them. This close, Harry can see how exhausted she looks, and he realizes how much this must cost her.
“Did you know,” Ginny had said the other day, smirking, “that the entire Fourth Year thinks I’m a top and you’re a bottom?”
Harry seems to calm down at that, closing his eyes. “Please don’t go.” His voice is small and tired. “This will work, I promise. We just...we shouldn’t talk about the past. Soon I won’t remember it anyway.”
This time Hermione sits up, narrowing her eyes. Ron’s heart beats fast. “And what type of girl is that?”
“They’re worried sick,” Ginny says, trying to bite back her anger. “And you know, I would be too—more than I am, at least—if I didn’t know what was going on.”
Even then, Dumbledore had rarely been around. And if Harry went back now, he would be painfully reminded that Dumbledore would never be around again.
Kissing awakens Harry’s body again, so that he can move, placing his hands hesitantly on Draco’s thighs, then with his pulse quickening, he dares to slip them under Draco’s shirt, flat against his skin, which dips and twists under his touch, a warm, living body rising and falling to meet him like waves at sea. He likes this, feeling Draco under his shirt, as if it were not allowed, the cloth trapping him in a third dimension that’s been created between them.
When he sees that she is close, Draco grabs Harry’s cock, which jerks in his hand. He feels Harry tremble beneath him, and Draco delights in the effect he has on Harry, even more so now, how a single touch can make him lose focus. Pansy does not let up, starting to move her hips, so Harry must pay attention, even though his body yearns towards Draco.
Draco sighs. “Okay.” A pause. “Yes, Harry, I’d love to be your date. You can even wear a Slytherin tie.” Harry’s lips quirk, but his shoulders stay drooped. He looks as crushed as Draco feels, though they both knew nothing would come of the conversation.
“I was wrong, that day,” Draco says, his voice trembling. “I thought I knew you. But I didn’t. I don’t think anyone does. You make sure of it.”
Ron and Hermione are thrilled, of course, that they finally started officially dating. The whole school is abuzz with rumors of their new relationship, much to the dismay of Harry and the delight of Ginny.
“It doesn’t matter why you came back, Harry,” Ron says firmly, and Hermione loves him more for it. “It just matters that you did. You chose to come back.”
“Hold on,” Ron says, his mouth working as if trying to figure out how to begin. “Harry told you this? And you never told me?”
Apparently Harry’s lack of a response is answer enough for Draco, who nods slowly, as if expecting it. He smiles, but it feels false, and Harry wonders how everything good always slips so easily through his fingers, like trying to grasp the wind.
“Clever way to make me wait,” Draco says sharply. His eyes, though, glitter with amusement. Harry’s lips curve into a smile.
“Well, we had better be off to bed,” Miss Granger says. “All of us have Transfigurations at nine o’clock tomorrow, and if my inclination is correct, we will be put to work right away.”
friends. She had told him nearly everything, and now that he was gone, she’s found herself feeling adrift.
Without warning, Harry spins Draco around and pushes him against the wall, caging him in with his arms. “I should turn you in right now,” he growls, and Draco gasps in fear. “After all, you are a Death Eater.”
But she remembers the weight of him in her arms, the utter dependency, and how she held him up, kissed his cheek, asked him what happened, but he just shook his head, over and over and over again, like a child, tears running freely down his face, and all he could say is
“You’re lying to me,” Harry says with a strange calm he does not feel, and he walks towards him, grabbing the box easily from Draco’s unsuspecting arms.
So as of late Ginny has been hanging around Luna, whose calm and peaceful quirks bring a lightness and steadiness to her days that she hasn’t felt in a long time. But Harry stays always on her mind.
“Look,” Malfoy interrupts, pointing to the bottle. Harry looks and sees champagne bubbling to the top, foaming as it spills down the sides, wetting his hand. He looks up at Malfoy, whose face is much closer than before. His blue eyes look grey this close, and they stare at Harry challengingly. “Do you understand?”
“Don’t call me that.” Draco sighs, shutting his eyes tightly for a moment, his thoughts racing like pixies in his head. “You are asking me to brew an illegal potion, Harry. I will not do it. I will not risk any more for you.”
Draco drops his wand, and the spell ends, and Harry comes to life again, sprinting forward and kicking Draco’s wand away. They look at each other, Draco shaking all over, and Harry breathing hard.
“Malfoy,” Harry says without inflection, inclining his head ever so slightly. Draco stares at him and then looks down at his plate, which still has half a blueberry pie on it. Harry must have come right during dessert, which is Ron’s expertise.
“It’s not about what I want to do,” Harry says gently, rearranging himself so as to shift more of Draco’s weight on himself. “It’s what I should do.”
“Doesn’t he?” Draco asks bitterly. “He’s the Savior, the Chosen One. I’m the Death Eater everyone wishes had been sent to Azkaban with the rest of them.”
He liked Draco. They got along, better than Harry had expected. It was not so much their similarities—which were many, to Harry’s surprise, like their loss of family and dark humor—but their
Harry ignores him, watching Malfoy from the other side of the room weave through the crowd that has grown significantly larger as more and more students trickle down to the dungeons. Malfoy avoids looking at Harry directly, addressing Pansy alone.
Hermione looks slightly flustered, but doesn’t back down. “Yes. I’d like to surprise my husband. I’ve been so busy at work, and he’s been so wonderful with the baby at home, and I thought…”
Harry’s hand moves quickly and blocks the hex silently, his palm deflecting it to the side, where it crashes into a large heap of lost items haphazardly thrown together. Draco can barely believe it, and he stares at Harry, speechless. Harry smirks.
And then Ginny appears, right in front of memory Hermione, a glass of wine in one hand. She’s wearing a slim fitting pink dress, and she had recently cut all her hair off so it was cropped close to her head, making her blue eyes large and bright in her freckled face.
“You didn’t think Dumbledore was going to leave me so unprepared? No, I’m his greatest prize, his most valuable treasure. He made sure I knew how to protect myself before I even had a wand.”
Everything jumbled inside his chest. There were no words to fix this. Had he really not known? Had he not known from the moment the other boy walked in?
“You can wear something of mine,” Harry had said, quietly, and Draco had stared at him with an unreadable expression. “If you want.”
Draco stares at the space where he just was for a beat longer, before swiveling on his heel and disappearing into the curtains behind him.
A figure up ahead emerges from a pub, looking around with all the suspect signs of someone wishing not to be followed. Harry tenses when he recognizes the blonde hair under a warm cap. Draco pulls his cap lower over his face, then walks quickly down the street. Without a second thought Harry follows him.
He likes to let Harry wait, to make him work for it, just a little. And Pansy makes him work for it. That’s her specialty. And she is beautiful, Draco cannot deny that, especially in sex. Her hips are wide and her legs long and shiny as she expertly straddles Harry. She barely makes a noise, her head lolling to the side, her bare neck a curve of beauty, like a swan, nearly immobile on a glassy lake.
“No,” Hermione assures quickly. “Well, yes, but not with you. It’s Harry.” Draco grimaces at Harry’s name, and stands stiffly by the door like he’d rather be anywhere else. Not for the first time Hermione wishes things were different.
“Yes, it’s time a woman takes charge of things,” Hermione agrees sternly, still carefully watching Harry. “Merlin knows men have done enough damage for a century.”
“It’s true enough. I just forgot to mention you have a penchant for vodka,” Harry says, and Draco laughs. The sound is not delicate or musically enchanting by an means, but it makes Harry dizzy as if intoxicated nevertheless, a little like the invincible feeling you get after drinking Liquid Luck.
Harry could not sleep in this room. Not tonight. He already felt anxious as it was, no need to add a sleepless night.
“Come on, Harry, let’s just go,” Hermione says, casting one last resentful look at Ron before grabbing Harry’s sleeve and dragging him away.
“She has a point,” Ron mutters, blushing when Harry raises an eyebrow at him. “Look, Harry, you’ve been pretty out of it lately. Ginny needs a friend, and you two were always close. I’m sure you’re going through a lot, what with Dumbledore and the memories, and I don’t want to take that away from you mate, but sometimes all you really have are the friends you make. It’d be a shame to lose them.”
Ginny wants to tell her that if Harry doesn’t believe it, it might as well be true, even if it’s not. Instead she asks, “Why are you guys worried?”
Ginny sits down next to Harry on the grass, leaning her head against his shoulder. She holds out her hand, and Harry passes her the cigarette. She examines it, before stamping it out in the grass. Harry sighs.
“This is quite enough,” Draco says, almost choked, standing up and gathering his things. He ignores Pansy’s hand on his arm and storms out of the classroom. Hermione watches Harry close his eyes briefly, before straightening in his seat.
A heavy silence blankets the room, so that the only thing heard are the fluttering wings of Cornish pixies. Then Draco murmurs, “A way into the castle.”
Then Draco noticed new things in Harry, how he would fail to speak when Pansy addressed him, how his eyes lingered on Pansy’s breasts for a second too long, how he blushed when he saw Pansy walk down in her robe.
With a hesitant smile and a nod, Draco takes the parcel gingerly in his hands. The magical binding glimmers momentarily, then fades. Draco nods again, then starts towards the door.
“Please, open it. I need the Room of Requirement. I need Draco. I know he’s in there,” Harry whispers, his forehead pressed against the wall as if in prayer, his eyes shut tight. But the wall remains stone, and Harry slams his fists against it in a burst of frustration.
girls, with Draco being the first, of course. It had happened by accident, one of the first nights she spent with Blaise, when she had realized he might be the best person she knew. Pansy could sense her love for Blaise settling on her like a second skin, and so out of fear she blurted out the only thing that might scare Blaise away.
Is it everything Draco ever imagined? Is it the unfulfilled hope he’s always held on to as his world burned down in front of his eyes? Is it the beautiful, enchanting happy ending he’s always wanted?
Draco huddles up in the blanket, wincing when something sharp pokes his side. He twists and removes the branch from underneath.
“I am not worried in the least,” Miss Granger says matter-of-factly, but Harry wonders who she is trying to convince. “To begin with, your magic is not lost, only temporarily...out of tune, let us say. Secondly, although you deny it every time I suggest it, your wand could just as well be the problem as your magic.”
“Ron!” Hermione blushes, half-heartedly pushing him away. “You can’t choose your partners. And anyways, I’m shackled with someone else.”
Harry stares at the bed sheets for a long time, before he speaks quietly. “Draco wanted me to tell everyone. To love him and to not be ashamed of loving him. He doesn’t understand. How could I ever be ashamed of loving him? I could never—you must understand—he is—I can’t—”
But Pansy pushes away from him, sitting up. “No, you don’t. I need you two like I need air to breathe. But if I were to walk away, you would still be whole. But I am never whole, and if I’m honest, I am not whole even here, with you and Harry, my moon and my sun, without which I would float in empty space, lost. But it’s a temporary fix and we both know it. And I’ve finally come to accept that. Have you?”
Hermione's cheeks flush at his investment in her thoughts. Merlin, it never gets old. “A Christmas party, last year. Ginny and I, we were talking about my pregnancy. I think we broke the news to family at the party.” Hermione pours the memory into the Pensive, watching the blue tendrils curl in the silvery white liquid. “What he told you, Harry, that is, about finding another world...it reminded me of this conversation.”
He knocks on the door before he changes his mind. Draco opens it immediately. He wears a pressed dress shirt and pants, making Harry feel undressed in his dark jeans and sweater.
“I should go,” Harry says. Hermione starts to protest, getting up, and then Draco stands up solemnly.
Luna looks genuinely puzzled. “No. Her name is Irma. It means universe in Old High German. A very beautiful language.” She looks dreamy, but then again, Luna always looks dreamy.
Sorrows fade, new hopes grow, and the sun rises every morning and sets every night. Draco does not pretend to believe in fantasies he no longer has the luxury to enjoy. Sometimes a smile is all you get, and if you keep busy looking at the horizon for something bigger, something better, you’ll end up missing it.
“Come on, Ron,” Harry says, cutting him an irritated glance. “I know I’m not the nicest person. I know I can be selfish and insensitive and rude. She needed someone else, someone different." He’s staring off into space again, and his voice grows quiet. "There are times I wonder…”
And then there’s the pitch—pristine, glistening green grass—Harry’s safe haven. The moment Draco stepped into the locker room after him, he knew that would change.
Harry stares at the bottom of the tower, at the green grass below that suddenly darkens and expands into a bottomless pit. What awaits him?
Then Ron looks up at her face and smiles so lovingly, that suddenly all those wonderings and doubts and worries disappear, and her heart speaks a single name, and it’s not a question at all.
She puts a hand on his arm, gently. “Draco, darling, listen to me. I will say this just once, and then we can never speak of it again.” His eyes darken to a slate gray as if he’s guessed what she’s about to say. She drops her voice to a whisper. “Be careful with Harry. Even if he loves you and trusts you, not everyone else will. I know the Dark Lord—”
When Ron’s gone down the hall and she hears their bedroom door open and close, she reaches for the button on her suit jacket.
Harry smiles, and it’s disarming in its subtle arrogance, that glint to the edge of a sword that tells you this person will unravel you and that they know it too.
“Good morning,” Harry had mumbled, stretching. He remembers how Draco had glanced away, frowning, his shoulders tense. It was an unmistakable sign. “Is everything alright?”
Draco Malfoy is glaringly absent from the funeral. Supposedly he went back to You Know Who, Snape too, though it’s only a rumor. Ginny doesn’t really care. She only cares about Harry.
“And that’s your problem, Harry.” Draco reaches out a hand, as if to brush his fingers against Harry’s jaw to feel the roughness, the texture of a past long settled in the dust of a war. His hand pauses midair, then lowers to his side. “You only ever thought about yourself.”
“They were fighting?” Pansy asks, not catching her meaning, while Ron stares at Hermione for a beat, then begins laughing, as Pansy looks on confused. “What are you snorting about, ginger?”
Ron sighs, then walks back to the couch, sitting down with a grunt. Ever since Rose’s birth, he swears his lower back has tightened up almost overnight, as if a marker of adulthood and age. He wants to ask Harry if he’s experienced something like this in the last year, but instead what he asks is very different.
He looks up. Draco’s eyes plead with him. His hand reaches out and takes Harry’s, who does not resist, but does not reciprocate, not at first.
—Harry was bold where Draco was cautious, Harry loved a wintry night sky while Draco loved a hot summer’s day, Draco’s formal use of the surname and Harry’s Muggle slang—that brought them closer.
“You don’t get it,” Draco whispers, looking at Harry frantically, a mouse trapped in the claws of a hawk. Is Harry that much of a monster?
“Just because you’re the smartest witch in the class doesn’t make me an idiot! You act like you’re so much better than me, but I don’t see you with anyone. You’re just lonely and jealous that someone actually loves me,” Ron says, and he knows he went too far the moment the words leave his mouth. Even Harry grimaces.
“Why that’s wonderful news! If only Eighth Years were allowed Prefect privilege, I am sure you would be made one again!” Mrs Weasley exclaims, kissing her son on the cheek. “And what about you, Miss Granger?”
And yet, there was something, something unnamed, that held them apart. A certain tension when they were together, a glance at the wrong moment, a brush of their hands as they stood side by side that sent Harry's heart beating. He did not know what it was and yet he knew. Of course he
His heart stirs with Harry wrapped up in him, their legs curled around each other, their breaths mingling, dancing between them shyly, and Draco understands then that this feels more like an end than a beginning.
“Thought so,” Draco said tersely. He grabbed his wand and stormed out of the room. After a beat, Harry hurried after him, haphazardly pulling on a pair of joggers. He went down the steps quickly, looking to stop Draco before he Apparated, but he found him seated on the couch, head in his hands.
“Who do you think did this?” Hermione asks, sitting down and tying back her hair. She feels frumpy today, and worried. Rose woke up screaming with a fever and she and Ron had spent all night trying to lower it.
“Don’t you always have the simple solution,” Draco mocks. Harry clenches his cigarette in his fist, then opens it and a small pile of ash is at the center of his palm where his cigarette was just a second ago. The breeze scatters the ash, and it spills between his fingers like sand.
They stare at each other in pensive silence before Ron yawns big and loud. “I dunno what’s going on here, love, but I need to go to bed. If anyone can figure this out, you can. And you will, but not tonight.”
They stare at the ground, an awkward silence ensuing. Harry briefly remembers his first visit to Diagon Alley, when he was only eleven, and had met Malfoy buying robes. He realizes now the multitude of things he said and did that would have offended someone like Malfoy, who had grown up in such an old fashioned world.
Their bodies collide before their lips do in a mutual effort of domination, Draco twisting around, wanting to straddle his waist, to have Harry under him, but Harry wants that too and he finds a way to pin Draco’s wrists on either side of him, and his mouth descends like a magnet back on Draco’s, sweet and slow and rich like honey, and he never wants it to end.
Harry had been sitting next to his friends at Hogsmeade, in a dingy bar that served them firewhiskey on the weekends. He was already tipsy by the time Draco, Pansy, and Blaise sauntered in.
But as soon as she heard that Draco and his family were cleared of any charges, she fled from Paris, and appeared on Draco’s doorstep with a suitcase and tears in her eyes. There was only one thing to be done.
The Wizarding world, much to Harry’s surprise and most other Muggleborns, is quite formal. As Miss Granger likes to joke, the magical population had no need for technology, so it halted progress in the eighteen hundreds and has hardly budged since.
“And if someone recognizes it as yours?” Draco asked sharply. Harry was reminded of that night in the Slytherin dorms, all those years ago, the
When they disappear upstairs, Harry feels Draco’s hand resting right beside his thigh. He bites his lip, ignoring him, but it’s no use, the memory like a delicate breath on the nape of his neck.
Draco felt sick. The tie wrapped around his eyes scuffed his cheeks. He had protested the blindfold, but the others insisted the game would be more entertaining if they knew Draco wouldn't see who came in the closet.
She always imagined funerals to have music, the somber violin wailing on the wind as the camera pans across the attendants, faces streaked with slow-falling tears, one woman silently sobbing in the front pew, before focusing on the open casket, a pale face with eyelids closed, dressed and groomed for an eternal sleep.
Slughorn calls on him, flustered at the interruption, and especially more so because it’s Harry Potter. “Yes, Mr. Potter?”
“I believe what the Minister means,” Miss Granger says, her voice hollow, “is that the Battle of Hogwarts did not just leave scars on those fighting, but on the castle itself.”
“You hammer us about reading all day long, and now that he’s reading, you tell him not to!” Ron exclaims. “Leave the poor boy alone.”
Harry walks faster, and over his shoulder tells the report lagging behind, “Voldemort killed my parents. It’s not harsh, it’s justice.” He turns and continues walking, leaving the reporter panting by the fountain, where statues lounging around the water gleam gold in spelled sunlight.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. She gives him a look full of pity, and he suddenly hates her for it. He wishes he had never kissed her, had never touched her, that she had never moved in with them, that this whole fucked up mess never happened.
She feels him embrace her from behind, stroking her hair, touching her body. Half of her wants to push him away, the other half wants to be closer. She turns into him, seeking his warmth, his protection, that no one else can give. Her Draco, her love, the only one she could ever count on.
“‘The Ministry, along with Headmistress McGonagall, have decided to open Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this school year. After many weeks of deliberation, we have come to the conclusion that students who had occasion to miss a year at Hogwarts, those who were taught under less than satisfactory conditions for their last year, and those who must complete another year to fulfill special requirements, must attend another year at Hogwarts in order to receive a diploma. Unfortunately, many of the core classes will have limited space, as their professors teach other class years. Therefore, more electives will be offered than usual for the attendance of Eighth Years only. While I am sure you may have concerns, I assure you that under the guidance of myself and the new Headmistress Minerva McGonagall, the castle and its students will heal and learn more speedily after the horrors of the war
And that, my friends, is why Draco Malfoy died in his Eighth Year of Hogwarts, or at least, why Pansy was really, really mad at him for a month and only really forgave him for it five years later when he and Potter finally got married.
Their mouths ghost against each other, Draco’s teeth lightly scraping his bottom lip, hands fingering Harry’s curls, pulling so that his neck prickles. His hands inch farther up, searching his breastbone, the hollow above his collarbone, the movement of his throat like a trigger beneath his fingertips.
The Lumos from his wand cannot shine on the Map and his surroundings at the same time, so Harry makes the slow trek stopping to look down at his map and noting where Malfoy is, and then holding his wand out to make sure he’s in the right place.
“Pardon me, Headmistress, I could not help but notice the damage done to Gryffindor Tower. Where will the Gryffindor house find accommodations?”
Harry looks at all of the food prepared for them, but he cannot find his appetite. All he can think about is where they will live, if not Gryffindor Tower. However, so as to show good breeding, Harry places the appropriate amount of food on his plate and begins to eat.
Harry finds Pansy on the balcony, smoking a cigarette. Her eyes are red but Harry would rather die than ask her about it.
Suddenly his curtain opens a sliver, and Draco silently points his wand at the opening. Then he sees a ripple in the air and Harry pokes his head in, grinning. Draco lets out the breath he had been holding in irritation.
“Of course,” Draco says, carefully stepping away from her desk. Hermione has noticed he’s more careful now than in school, as if he’s scared with any small movement he might upset someone.
“Jealous of what?” Pansy asks exasperated. “Honestly, Draco, you know I’m currently hooking up with the hottest boy in this damn school.” A few heads passing in the hallway turn towards her loud claim.
Harry cannot respond. He slides a hand up Draco’s arm, whose smirk fades into that delicious frown. Harry leans forward and kisses him again, except it’s different this time, more purposeful, more open, and Draco tilts his head, causing Harry to taste more of him, his mouth inviting and foreign at the same time. He desperately wants to stop and never do anything but this for the rest of his life.
He hears footsteps upstairs, and then Pansy appears at the top of the staircase, wrapped in a dark green robe and slippers, her face makeup free except for a faded tint on her lips.
“I am perfectly fine,” Harry says harshly. “Thank you, Weasley,” Harry adds, hoping he did not offend. The last thing he needs is a breach in friendship with one of the only people who understands his pain.
“It’s the only way and you know it,” Harry says darkly. Draco turns, and tries to hide the pity that he feels. Harry hates pity above almost all else.
Harry’s face had been turned away from Ginny from where she was hidden, but Draco’s expression said enough. She knew that look, like staring at a brilliant star dying before your eyes, knowing nothing you could do would save it, but wanting to anyway.
With a deep sigh, Hermione begins to gather her things, but just then Harry jolts upright, staring at the Map in astonishment.
Hermione nods, grabbing the shirt from Pansy’s hands, apparently too stunned to speak. She goes into the dressing room and closes the door. A minute late she reemerges in the black pant suit, and Pansy tilts her head, examining her.
“As a matter of fact, my sweet sister,” Weasley says, narrowing his eyes, “I have been accepted into all of my classes.”
Draco looks at him sideways, his shoulders tense at the proximity of his boyhood rival. “I suppose. Never really thought about it.”
The Muggle station falls away and reveals Platform 9¾, the black and red Hogwarts Express gleaming in all of its glory, with steam puffing from the engine as it prepares to depart.
Harry was speechless, so Draco crawled towards him and kissed him, one hand palming the front of Harry’s jeans.
Miss Weasley notices as well, and looks down, annoyed, her lips pursed. Although Harry once thought of courting Miss Weasley, the sentiment passed as quickly as it came when they both realized there was no real feeling attached to their mutual affection. It was brotherly and sisterly love, and that is all. Unfortunately, her brother still wishes for his sister and closest friend to unite their families and make Harry a true brother to himself.
Harry shrugs. “Why should it?” He turns around, as if to block Ginny from his mind not just mentally, but physically too. This has always angered Ginny, and it still does now. She strides over to him and yanks his shirt sleeve. Harry whirls around, stunned, looking at Ginny like he wonders how she got there.
Harry returns home with his head full of Hermione’s warnings. They live in a very luxurious apartment with two floors and more rooms than seem possible to fit in the space, most likely thanks to Draco’s illegal extension charms which he pays the landlord to keep quiet about. He opens the heavy wooden door, passing through a shimmery ward.
A beat later, Pansy quickly removes herself without looking at Draco. He lies down beside Harry, smiling past the hurt. He knows one wrong look and Harry will demand an explanation, will want to convince them that love conquers all, when, in fact, it won’t this time.
“It is necessary now more so than ever,” Harry says. “Perhaps many things would be different if people only told the truth.”
“Ginny, why don’t you sit down?” Hermione asks nervously. “Harry was just telling us about the memories Dumbledore has been showing him. About Tom Riddle’s past.”
At this Draco laughs, and Pansy wishes she could bottle up the sound for later. She’s always been able to tell just by the taste of the wind if a storm was brewing, and Merlin knows there’s a dark and thundering one just on the horizon.
“It was pretty obvious to anyone who knows you two well,” Ron explains, scratching at the back of his head.
“Please, Malfoy, it would work. I know it will work.” Harry comes back to the front desk, leaning on it again and looking at Draco imploringly. Desperately. It reminds Draco of that night, the first night when Harry sacrificed Draco to save himself from Snape’s punishment.
“I thought you said we were going to visit Hagrid today?” Hermione asks coldly. Lavender makes a noise beside him, but he hardly notices.
“Why, Miss Granger, we will not see you at all outside of class!” Weasley cries upon looking at her schedule.
Harry nods, his throat constricting, unable to form a coherent thought, before placing his wrist beside Malfoy’s. He does not know why he is so nervous. Pansy raises a brow, then points her wand at their wrists.
Hermione and Ron stand next to each other in an awkward silence. These silences have only grown since Lavender Brown keeps following Ron around. He doesn’t understand why, although naturally Harry always smirks at him when Ron brings it up. Harry has always been more perceptive than Ron, especially when it comes to other people. Sometimes cruelly perceptive, dissecting a person’s motivation or insecurity with a few witty remarks and that razor sharp smile.
“I forgive your presumption, Miss Lovegood. I might have wished to become an auror once, but with my poor marks I have not been accepted into the classes which will allow me to apply for the program.”
“You’ve got to be more careful, Draco,” Pansy says in a low voice. Draco wrenches his eyes away from Harry when he finally turns a corner and out of view, brows furrowing as Pansy’s warning registers.
Harry’s voice is hollow. “We can’t be together. I thought...but I always knew, deep down, that it couldn’t last.”
Harry kisses Draco’s throat, sucks on the tender moving muscle that ripples under his lips. His fingers fumble under Draco’s robes only to find the long row of buttons on his starchy pressed shirt.
“What courses will you be taking? I am most looking forward to Herbology, though I doubt there is much surprise there. Professor Sprout sent me a personal letter to tell me how excited she is for us to work together one last time. And you know, she mentioned that you will also be taking Herbology! Who would have thought! I was very pleased to hear it, I must say, Mr Potter.”
“Honestly, both of you had better study when you can. This year will be much more challenging,” Miss Granger says sternly.
No, he could not go back and teach at Hogwarts, his first and last home, the place of his beginning and his end.
“I wanted to see you,” Harry says, smirking. He lies down beside Draco, and Draco puts down his textbook, having forgotten about it completely. Harry lifts the side of the covers and slides underneath, his pajama covered legs finding Draco’s and curling around them possessively. “You’re so warm.”
“Indeed it is, Mr Potter,” she replies with a small smile. “And now I must excuse myself. There is much to do and very little time. I look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow at nine o’clock sharp for our first Transfigurations class.”
He knows Harry will talk to Pansy, will try to reach out to her and reel her back in, save her, like he has always done with everyone he meets.
Harry approaches the stairwell to the Headmaster’s office, and says the password before entering. His heart beats ever so faster as it always does before speaking with his father.
And sure enough, the memory begins to focus, like a camera lens honing into the main actor on screen, and the noise of the party fades to the background as Hermione and Ginny’s voices raise in volume, clear and familiar.
Draco does not know exactly why he finds pleasure in watching Harry and Pansy together, except that he knows exactly why, as he watches Pansy lower her cunt over Harry’s mouth, and Harry struggles in the position, his jaw working, his cock exposed, waiting, untouched, nestled in dark curls.
Hermione sighs, and folds up her books. “I am exhausted. A good night’s rest should clear up my mind.” She slings her book bag over her shoulder and walks over to Harry, kissing him on the forehead. “Are you not coming up?”
Harry rolls to the side, out of breath, cheeks flush and green eyes bright against the dark wood around them. His head lolls to the side, and he gives her a lazy, satisfied grin. Ginny props herself up on her elbow, letting his eyes rake her body from her red hair down to her toes.
As he falls, Harry feels the wind against his cheeks, his stomach drop as his body plummets like a stone through the air, and the darkness rushes up to greet him.
“So can you.” Ginny takes his face between her hands. “We’re in this together. Promise me, Harry. Promise me you won’t do this alone.”
Pansy shakes above him, bringing Harry back to the present. He grabs her by the waist, pulling her down, closer, sliding his tongue fully inside of her, then reaching with his finger and caressing her clit. He can barely focus, though, stars bursting behind his eyelids as Draco sinks himself lower, increasing his pace, rocking their bodies to one rhythm. Pansy guides his hand with her own, faster and faster and faster, just like Draco riding his cock, building intensity, their bodies glistening with sweat, the symphony of erotic sounds cascading around him like fireworks.
“They stop pestering me about being an Auror if I show up and speak at these events,” Harry says, flushing, though he doesn’t know why.
Malfoy raised both eyebrows. Harry thought he almost looked amused, although his eyes still held a steely grey that sharpened on him.
Harry shakes his head. "It's complicated. We...could never get married. Ginny needed someone steadier, calmer, less dark and heavy. She was there for me when I needed her most, and then after the war, we tried to make it work. But people change, she as much as I."
“Sometimes,” Harry says in a far away voice, “this feels like a dream, being with you. And then I go back to real life, and the nightmares.”
“Ten minutes late,” younger Hermione says, cutting Harry a slightly worried glance. For a moment Hermione forgets why she would have been worried about Harry, but then she recalls Harry’s break up with Ginny that wasn’t really a break up because they were not together to begin with. Perhaps that’s why, but somehow Hermione doubts it now. But what else would she be worried about, then? “Honestly, it’s outrageous.”
He knows what is going to happen next, and yet he cannot prepare for it. Draco’s legs brush against Harry’s sides, then Draco’s hand guides Harry’s cock into him, carefully, Draco exhaling loud, Harry grasping the couch with his hands, his vision going black.
The Headmistress pauses, appearing to compose herself. Harry can hear others, including Miss Granger and Miss Patil, holding back their sorrow. The sniffles and sighs amongst them echo pitifully in the empty hall.
“Oh? But then are you dating someone? I hadn’t heard…” Hermione trails off when a flash of pain briefly twists Draco’s features.
“That hardly narrows it down,” Hermione says, then smiles apologetically. “But thank you, Draco. You’ve been very helpful.”
Hermione tries her hardest not to glance at the clock in the common room. It won’t do her any good. She refocuses on the Potions reading at hand, but the words blur together. With a sigh, she gives in and looks up at the large ornate clock hanging above the fireplace.
“Well, I do not know exactly, but I suppose he will have abilities and insight that wizards and witches do not.”
He frowns, and takes her hand affectionately, and it feels like a path diverging, one she’ll never take stretching one way, the other she’s destined to walk even if her heart wonders about the former. “You don’t love him.”
Draco thinks of his mother, his darling mother, holding him tight one last time before he left on the Express, so rare in their conservative ways, and then he imagines the Dark Lord with his blood red eyes and snarling mouth pointing his wand at her and shouting—
“You left me, Draco!” Harry yells, his voice trembling, with rage or despair Draco cannot tell. Maybe it’s both, or maybe it doesn’t matter. “I chose you and you threw it all in my face—”
Harry looks around at the shelves lining the walls. Glass bottles, vials, and jars of a variety of ingredients, both common and rare, as well as ready-to-buy potions, sit crammed on the shelves. When Harry looks at one in particular—a vial of deep, violet liquid so thick and smooth as to appear velvety—a shimmery price tag hovers below it alongside a name.
After she closes the front door behind her, loud enough for Draco to hear, she stands on the doorstep, just as she did two months ago, no less lost and alone, but determined, to find her way, knowing she must now. Her heart bleeds with the wounds left from two beautiful boys who have pierced through her in different ways. Where can she go from here?
After all, Pansy had loved them, because they proved that no obstacle is too great, no hatred too much, for love to conquer. They are the symbol of love conquering all. She held onto that like she used to clutch her mother’s hand as a child, knowing that as long as she held onto her, she would be okay.
as Pansy likes to call them. He’s touchy and affectionate with Draco in an unexpected, reverent way, as if having his hand on Draco’s skin somehow means something more, something almost akin to a language.
Harry finds Draco’s cock with one hand, between Draco’s body and the mattress, sliding against his palm. Draco’s body shudders, easing open even more, so that Harry falls in deeper, groaning, and then Draco tightens, spasming around Harry, and Harry calls out his name, riding his pleasure out, feeling Draco pulse in his hand the next moment, so that they grow still together, breathing heavily.
Harry tried not to watch as Draco accidentally pulled too hard and the scarf came undone, revealing a black tattoo—the edge of a bird’s wing, Harry thought—peeking from underneath the collar of his t-shirt.
He tries to slow down, to make love to him, but his pulse stutters, his legs tense, and he can’t control himself anymore, like running downhill, the pace quickening without meaning to, gasping for breath as they fuck, Harry’s hand grasping Draco’s hair and pulling so that he hears Draco moan.
Pansy smiled. “Of course my love.” Then she leaned over and kissed Draco on the lips. Harry stared at Draco, shocked, but not upset, as she sauntered to the kitchen. Draco looked at Harry, waiting.
“Ginny? What do you mean?” His eyes are steady, but his mouth is tense, and Ginny realizes he’s terrified.
“To let the Death Eaters into the castle,” Hermione finishes sadly, remembering the terror of that night, the Dark Mark flashing green against the stormy grey sky.
“Yes, I know what you mean.” He moves Harry’s hand down his chest, his stomach, dusted in fine golden hairs, to the belt, stopping there as if that’s his answer. With shaky hands, Harry works the belt buckle off, then unzips his pants. He pulls them down, along with Draco’s briefs, sliding them down, down, until there is nothing left to see except everything.
This truce they had between them, a momentary peace where they could forget their past mistakes, their past betrayals and past losses. Harry had known his time with Draco was short, so preciously short.
“Professor McGonagall will be teaching Transfigurations even as Headmistress?” Weasley asks doubtfully.
“Walk with me,” Malfoy says before Harry can protest, and then he feels Malfoy’s fingers thread in his. He matches Malfoy’s long strides as they rejoin the rest of the group with all of the couple’s wrists tied, champagne bottles leisurely passed between lips.
The man had a very familiar being bent over the large space of his desk, his cock shoved up Cho Chang’s pussy as he pounded away into the pretty Asian with barely restrained strength.
But it’s been years since the war and I haven’t seen Potter during all this time. Everyone had slowly recovered from the bloody war, some still healing from its damages like me. I threw away any contacts that I had in Hogwarts and all of my Slytherin friends hated my guts while they went around and blamed me for everything whenever that annoying journalist, Rita Skeeter, asked them questions about how awful it was to be acquainted with me so she could type it up in the Daily Prophet and make me look even more like a fucking wanker.
And if I was the person that had to take their life away for their mistakes, then so be it. Harry does it. So I can too.
Please leave any comments if you want! I'm forever grateful for the support of this story. It makes me happy knowing I can give joy to my readers. Go on and read!
Besides, it’s not like I wanted to go out anyway. I really was tired and people being kind to me like Granger and Weasley were doing right now made me feel uncomfortable and on the brink of paranoia.
Was this reverse psychology or something that Caetia was using on me? I already knew that I wouldn’t be going anywhere near drugs or people for that matter.
back. Come on baby, let me watch you fall apart this one time and I’ll stop. I don’t want to. But I’ll stop.” Harry’s voice seemed to fluctuate between the normal, deep honey drip of his voice to that of the demonic essences that spewed out of his mouth terrifyingly so. He sounded like he was in strained ache as well, like he was holding back something.
I was momentarily left bereft of any logical thought as my eyes soaked in the sight of the assassin standing oh so casually beside me.
“Come on, Kitten.” The tone in Harry’s words were laced with a dark foreboding sense of an impending threat, the sound dripping like burnt candle wax cooling over the twitching sweat of my flesh, curling an invisible hardened grip over my lungs and causing my stomach to dip profusely with an alarming heat.
But I knew Caetia would be the last one to judge me, given how he stripped for a living and constantly wore these sort of things.
that magic out of said person carrying around a bright source within their body, and drink it in until that person gives out and becomes a shriveled piece of meat. My magic is
The air hitched in my lungs at the sensation of Erus’ cock, hard and long and large, nudging against the line between my wine kissed lace panty covered arse, insistent with its hard pressure prodding at my bum cheeks in an inevitable penetration that was surely to come to fruition in the next few minutes or so.
to not be okay all the time. So don’t keep everything in, try not to, and I will too.” The assassin’s voice was barely heard over the whine that escaped my throat as I dragged the bottom of my lip across the length of Harry’s hot bronze smooth neck and up to the curve of his strong jawline, letting the bottom edges of my teeth graze the vein that pulsed beneath the assassin’s flesh the way up and hearing the way Erus’ breath turned heavier, slow and dark.
I decided to use the magic that the ministry allowed for me to keep but kept a harsh eye on if I were to use it for anything wrong. The Ministry and Hogwarts wouldn't notice anyway, so I was practically in the clear.
I was always such a good boy to my parents and never did anything scandalous with my body or hobbies. So in a way, I was finally doing things that were both frightening and exciting. I was finally taking my own interests in my own hands and doing what I wanted with them.
I had a plan and Harry was going to learn that I wasn’t just going to do whatever he says, whenever and however he wants.  I also needed to know if it was Harry that wanted me or the dark magic tricking him into wanting me just for my own magic.
All the while, I hoped the assassin would be staring at me, my bare back, and my perky ass so he could see what he would be missing out on for the time being since he didn't compliment me.
The man’s cock practically felt like it was inside of me by the way he eye-fucked me so brutally and slowly.
I released my right hand from the back of Draco’s head to instead, swing my right booted foot up to press it against the left of his temple, stamping my foot down against his head as I reveled in the yelp Kitten gave away when I all but rammed my cock into the plump of the blonde’s arse in a quick, violent succession.
To make matters worse, the assassin made a tiny shift in his still motion, leaning slightly forward and tipping his head down to let the disheveled black of his locks fall over the glow of his crimson, jaded gaze as he let the broad of his back show the lines of his muscled shoulder blades, crouching the tiniest bit low in a look of animalistic intent.
I didn’t even know this man and he expected me to take his words to heart? What’s this about warning me of something that was significantly wrong for me? Instead of it being “something”, what if it turned out to be “someone” instead? I barely knew anyone anymore. No one seemed to want to be anywhere near me let alone want anything to do with me, so how could I be in danger if I didn’t associate myself with anyone.
Pansy, with her tall stature and fit body that rivalled a model, looked stunning with her brown hair down and the milky white of her skin. Both her and Blaise made a brilliant couple.
My insides felt as if they vibrated from the quivering of my contracting inner muscles, having constantly taken Harry’s violent cock whenever and however the man wanted me without any such protest on my behalf.
Harry simply stared straight ahead at Hezian, the glow of his eyes gleaming with devilish bemusement at the situation he put me in, the only sign giving away his dark satisfaction with how his face was set into a look of utter boredom.
But I had a feeling Harry would be able to calm me down, although my body was already in a hyperventilating state once I landed back on my own two feet when the apparating spell had been completed and I found myself in the assassin’s kitchen once again.
And as Harry wound his bike through the lines of awaiting cars in traffic, I could feel my face heat up from hearing unmistakable cat calls as we passed groups of middle aged men and women that were out and about having a drunken night or simply showing their enthusiasm for what I wore as the momentum of the bike speeding up caused my skirt to ruffle about wildly over the exposed skin of my thighs.
I had taken notice of the demon's physical and mental stability every time they were in my presence. Sometimes Zereth's movements were sluggish after bringing me back someone to kill, as if their energy into entrapping a person took a toll on their body. Perhaps having to use their power in order to consistently pop in and out of places without being seen or known somehow took a lot of energy out of the demon? And surely the creature had their own work to be doing except feeding me magic all the time. The thing
And then I found myself flopping face first into the fluffy sheets of the mattress beneath me, my breath wheezing out of my lungs as my voice elicited a wet gasp, the tendrils of my shoulder length hair splaying every which way as my heart rate kick started up once again.
My skin felt touched by his warmth, the heat of his magic outrageously strong as if it were trying to scorch its way into my lungs.
of the gloves, the velcro tearing itself away with the easy swipe from Potter’s left hand peeling it off. The sound induced my stomach to roil as I felt my bottom lip tremble at the violent, rough movement. An enticing, sinister motion that was shamefully arousing to my person.
your kind because of your blood. Those two children I read about were both killed by them. But the history of the children’s murders were large and too devastating that the ministry hid that part of history away from everyone and forbade elves and wizards to fornicate. My magic is attracted to you because of the purity you hold when you also attract the most dangerous creatures and demons even when you hold such pure thoughts but at the same time, have some fucked uo thoughts as well. You’re a contradiction, and my magic likes that. You're filled with a good mixture of purity and darkness. The children never had a pure bone in their body because they were cast aside from the start and were made into monsters from the very beginning, it took you some time to get in touch with your dark magic because maybe you were too scared of fearful of where how dark your thoughts could become. The children were easily swayed to do the dark creatures’ and demons’ bidding because they were already so far off their rocker to consider morals, thus how they easily became mass murderers.”
Mentally shaking my head to rid them of my present thoughts, I looked over again at my cousin with a slow raise of my brow. “I appreciate you making me breakfast. I’ll be out in a couple minutes. So please let me get changed.”
The dark smoke seemed to manifest into a thicker substance, a smoky silhouette forming into itself until a solid figure developed into the bulk of shadows, an assaulting carnality displayed in the midst of the smoke while I was left stunted.
you’ll be fucked to death and I fear I won’t be able to stop it because of the amount of pleasure I’ll get from taking your energy as well and taking you physically.”
I saw Granger peering up over Potter’s shoulder to fix her amused gaze towards me. Of course the redhead was delighted by all of this.
An abrupt frigid air shoved its way into the lodge of my throat as another thought passed through the frantic workings of my mind.
“You can’t seem to do anything without my help, Kitten.” Harry’s warm breath tickled at the back of my ear, voice low and thunderous as his chest shook my back with the way his tone vibrated through me.
coming from Harry. Crossing my arms over my chest, I scuffled my left foot against the dirty ground in a fit of abrupt brattiness that could only be reasoned for being a result from the damn Gryffindor disregarding my question. “I am
All I could make out through the rush of heavy adrenaline and rage was the thing that caused such a reaction out of me.
that were disembodied and containing such carnal cruelty, all came from the upturn of Harry’s lips, roughened and slick with smooth, Stygian pleasure, rolling off of his tongue like a second, unearthly language that was directed towards me.
Bright colors significantly obscured my view for the briefest moments before dimming down into the soft, calming lull of low colors that my room provided.
My eardrums seemed to pop from the garbled hysteric and shrieking scream the guy let out as his heart gave way to one last pulsing throb in the curl of my hand before it died out completely, sudden and worn down.
Everything was shifting colors and the visuals around me were disconjointing, the only thing clear enough for the hooded stare of my blood red eyes to see was the figure of Draco’s body twitching like he was being electrocuted from the inside his frame, his screaming intensifying as I watched with satisfaction spreading out over my warmed flesh at the spill of cum dripping out of his sore, cute prick while his hole vacuumed my cock in and out as if it had turned itself into the tightest boypussy I’ve ever fucked into.
Perhaps I should go to the doctors and check for any head injuries? Abnormal things keep happening to me. First Potter, then a fake Kingsley getting killed by the Golden Boy and now a skeleton looking kind of man giving me a series of riddled words.
The long line of his back arched like a wanton harlot, his lithe body curvaceously small beneath me, the delicacy of his shoulder blades a protruding state that had my cock pulsating viciously with dark craving to plunder into Draco’s dainty figure to shatter him whole and make him into the fucking wrecked, broken doll that he reminds me so much of.
I wanted to make good use of myself and if this was how I could help others, then I would, despite the obvious need to cause mayhem since I’ve awakened my dark magic. I still had the large part of me that wanted to help others and the innocent people who needed it.
Remus tugged Harry towards the lift, which clattered and banged as it stopped and opened its wiry gate for them. They both stepped in and Remus closed the gate before pushing the round ‘four’ button to the right of the lift. They made their way steadily up until the lift jangled to a stop and the gate slid open noisily.
“Well, congratulations to you all. However, I’m sorry to say that I must cut into your celebrations...” It looked as though she were steeling herself to say the next words, and as she looked directly into Harry’s green eyes, she said, “The portrait of Albus Dumbledore has appeared in the Head’s office. The Headmaster is gone.”
. Stay here with Remus, Harry. I don’t want you wondering around the castle with the wards tampered with like they are.”
Severus stopped just outside the doors of the hospital wing as Remus whispered his name. He didn’t turn around or respond, but just waited for his one-time lover and ex-enemy to speak.
The potions master gently took the tea cup out of Harry’s hand, which was still trembling slightly, and pulled his son into a tight hug. He felt Harry practically melt against him as the tension bled out of his body at last.
Severus blinked a few times as he stared at Remus. No one had ever said anything like that to him save Dumbledore, but he knew the old man had a knack for lying to make people feel better. Remus, on the other hand, was a very honest man and would sooner tell you the harmful truth than a protective lie.
“Harry, it’s alright. It’s just an owl,” Severus called behind him as he lowered his wand and moved towards the owl to retrieve the letter. He cursed as the owl nipped sharply at his finger, refusing to give up the letter to anyone but Draco.
“Oh, you got the internship?” Harry asked, happy for his boyfriend, but also feeling quite jealous that Draco was going to be spending so much more time with his father.
The Order members present looked a combination of worried and frightened; the end was nigh and things were coming to a head. This was it. It had taken so long; they had all lost so much to get to this point. Everyone there had lost someone to this war, to Voldemort’s senseless violence and hatred. It would be a relief to get past this once and for all, but for now, it still seemed they were at the foot of Mount Everest with only dental floss and a paperclip to grapple with.
Molly moved to greet Snape, looking even smaller than usual standing next to the notoriously tall man in draping, billowing robes. “Good evening, Severus. It’s nice to see you again.”
Remus gripped Severus’ hand in his own, noticing how the man was rubbing his own wrist, as if the phantom bracelet was still there. “You had no way of knowing its true nature, Severus. There’s every reason to believe it’s still where you buried it; all hope is not lost.”
“Come Harry, we must be quick with this information, especially if Severus is none the wiser yet.” Remus glanced around nervously before leaning close to Harry’s ear and whispering, “Lucius Malfoy was probably one of the escaped Death Eaters, Harry. He’s probably making a hasty line towards Hogwarts to get to Draco.”
“A rule, eh? And who made this rule?” Severus asked as he grudgingly accepted the piece of cake that was being shoved into his hands.
“Come, Harry; we have much to do and very little time to do so. There’s only a week until term starts, you’ll see them then.”
Harry didn’t realize he had screamed his last thought out loud at Remus, who was trying to comfort him. The hand disappeared and then was replaced by a larger, warmer hand that snaked to his shoulder and pulled him around against a chest that smelt of herbs and sandalwood; his father.
Severus watched Harry carefully to see if he was actually Occluding, or just attempting. After ten minutes with his eyes closed, the boy opened his eyes and began placing the puzzle pieces together. His slow movement and carefully measured blinks made it immediately apparent to Severus that he was indeed Occluding while putting the puzzle together. The boy was a natural when he received proper teaching. Not until Harry had completed the puzzle did Severus move or speak.
Later that night after most of the guests had left, Harry was led up to the drawing room by Draco, who wouldn’t answer his questions about where Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and the Twins had disappeared to earlier as the party had started to wind down.
Tonks’ hair, which was the exact shade of green of Harry’s eyes, seemed to droop before said eyes, turning to chocolate curls that reached the middle of her back. Harry recognized that hair; it was Sirius’ hair. This must be what Tonks’ natural hair looked like.
Remus cocked an eyebrow at the Potions Professor, feeling like he should know the name Abigail, and failing to remember from where. “Abigail? You’ve never been one to use first names, Sev. Someone you know well?”
Harry’s look of chagrined guilt made Ron’s face grow dangerously redder. “I didn’t have much of a choice, Ron. Dumbledore thinks it’s the safest place for me until Hogwarts starts up again. It’s not as horrible as you may think, actually. Snape has helped me loads this summer, not to mention saved my life –”
Harry could see that it was jealousy talking, not actual malice, and felt himself relax. “Sorry, I just wanted to see if I could do it. I didn’t ask to be a natural Legilimens; trust me, I’d rather have been a natural Occlumens.”
Before Severus could reply, there was a faint knock on the door. Their eyes met for a second as they both took deep breaths and stood up. Severus moved closer to Harry and put an arm around his shoulders giving him a half hug for luck. “Don’t worry. Things will work out just fine, you’ll see.”
“I can get to my room on my own; I do remember where it is, after all,” he snapped, getting more irritated by the second. He had just specified that he wanted to be alone, yet they still stood around like he was an invalid who needed an escort wherever he went.
Draco was sitting mostly by himself, though Pansy Parkinson was attempting to lean across the table to talk to him. Crabbe and Goyle were sitting on either side of Blaise Zabini, who looked much too smug for a simple Hogwarts breakfast on a Sunday morning. Harry didn’t really care about all that. What he cared about was the dull look in Draco’s eyes as he stared down at his plate, swirling his eggs around without interest.
Harry felt his heart sink at the tone of Draco’s voice. He sounded really confused, and the way he said Potter didn’t exactly sound kind, not to mention Draco hadn’t called him ‘Potter’ in some months.
“I’ve yet to discuss it with him, but I’m sure he’ll agree. He cannot stay in the castle, and though I’d like to trust him completely, I will admit that I don’t. I want to keep him close, just in case,” Severus admitted with a wary look. So far, Lucius had proved useful and trustworthy, but Severus had dealt with enough betrayal in his life to be wary of falling into a false sense of security around the man.
“Oh I am sure you are quite right,” Mr Weasley says, his eyes twinkling. “I thought perhaps I would surprise you as well.”
Suddenly Malfoy looks up, catching Harry’s eye with his grey ones, before his gaze slides away and Harry is not sure that Malfoy saw him at all. That same feeling returns to his chest, and he has to look away.
As she is poised over Harry’s face, she feels his breath against her cunt before his tongue slips inside her, and she shivers. She does not understand, cannot comprehend, how he takes her in his mouth so innocently, so quietly, as if it were the only thing he had wanted to do right now.
Of course, Draco doesn’t work. He never planned to do anything with his life except live in luxury, and his family hardly lost any money after the war despite certain fines and fees during the trial. So he spends his days sleeping, eating, and shopping for his apartment. What more could a Malfoy need?
Then Slughorn turns with a large book in one hand, and addresses the class. “Today we are learning about illegal potions. Why do potions become illegal? How do they become illegal? And if we have time at the end of class I will touch upon some illegal ingredients as well and their usage.”
“Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Government, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Alchemy, and Care of Magical Creatures.”
“It must have slipped your mind,” Malfoy says, narrowing his eyes at her. Finally, he looks at Harry, a glance of his usual indifference. He holds out his wrist. “Ready, Potter?”
“It really accentuates his arms, doesn’t it?” Pansy says, and Draco nods, a wicked smile forming on his face.
Draco flushed. “I suppose not. I’m not attracted to women. But Pansy is Pansy. She’s the most beautiful woman I know.”
Mrs Malfoy looks away. Harry thinks he might have gone too far, and she would not answer, but she looks at him again with pleading eyes. “Mr Potter, though I know it is not my place, I must ask you a favor. Mr Malfoy, you must know, will be attending Hogwarts for his Eighth Year. He will not have many friends there. I fear for his safety.”
The shock was subdued by the shame, a dark black shame that coated his skin like oil he couldn’t wash off no matter how hard he scrubbed. Harry knew he could never look at Draco the same. He represents every awful choice he’s ever made, the deadliest of sins he can never ask forgiveness for, because the person he would ask for forgiveness from is dead and buried.
After the war, Harry ceased to speak with his aunt and uncle, and only occasionally communicated with Dudley, so he rarely needed to remember his Muggle habits. It was quite disappointing, and worrisome, then, to discover that his magic did not work properly anymore. Suddenly the simplest spells became impossible to execute without some disaster. One day he nearly drowned the entire Weasley family after he casted an Aguamenti spell in the kitchen to make himself oatmeal. He blamed the war, and the grief, at first. But as the months went by and the summer came to an end, Harry quickly realized that something was very wrong.
“Sorry, I have a charity event in an hour,” Harry says quietly. Draco sits up, yawning. Even such a domestic, simple gesture pains Harry profoundly, like a single small blade to the right spot can sever the spine.
“You know, Draco, darling, come to think of it, Hermione asked me a few questions too.” Her tone is full of sarcasm, and Draco narrows his eyes.
If Harry were Weasley, he would have proposed several months ago. Weasley had tried to court Miss Granger last year, but what with the war and the hunt for Horcruxes, love-making was not the top priority. At the final battle, afraid that he or she may die before the day ended, Weasely had professed his undying love and Miss Granger returned his feelings with the same enthusiasm. However, with the aftermath of the war, with Mr Fred Weasley’s death and the death of many others, nothing came about from such a grand profession, and they returned much to the same place they had always been, bickering and staring at each other longingly when they believe the other unawares.
He thinks of Draco, the only person on earth to see every dark and blackened piece of his soul and take his hand and kiss it. To look in his eyes and brave the monster lurking within, the monster he feels slithering under his skin, rippling its shiny scales.
Beside her on the couch Harry yawns. Hermione turns to him. He had been sleeping with his stupid Map draped open across his chest like a blanket and his stupid Potions textbook across his face like an eye mask. Now he stretches his arms, reflexively looking at his Map and scanning it expertly.
Mornings are the hardest part of Draco’s day. A part of him longs never to wake up, and the rest of him must convince that part of him that nothing will fall apart when he opens his eyes.
Harry pounces immediately when Draco slips off his briefs, sitting back for just a brief moment completely naked, his skin cold and prickling, and Harry staring, just staring, like he had never seen anyone else, then jump-starting into motion.
Ginny and Harry always seemed to be, and now how they keep their distance even having technically made up. When his mind is far away, Ginny already has trouble reaching him. But now his heart has gone to a boy with a dark, twisted Fate and Ginny has no hopes of reaching Harry now.
Harry knows this too, that Draco will always give in, will always try to save him. That’s why he came in the first place. Harry grins smugly, and starts to walk away, and all Draco can do is watch him walk away.
“Will you have enough room?” Harry asks, looking around the small square space and minimalist design.
Now their love glows in a different way, but Hermione wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. But sometimes she does remember those nights with a little nostalgia.
He glanced up, surprised, and found Draco staring at him with wide eyes. Before he knew what he was doing, Harry jerked his head towards the door, and Draco hesitated, before nodding. They both got up, pushing their chairs back.
it had never been explored, that makes Hermione pause and wonder. How much had the war taken away? Did only people die, or did experiences die as well?
A clamor from the door to the lockers makes her look up sharply, and suddenly Harry stumbles towards her, blood on his hands, a sharp bleeding gash across his cheek, tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
“I find forgiveness in this instance as quite worse than forgetting,” Miss Weasley says carelessly, though it is only to hide her true sorrow. “If the Headmistress asked me, I would rather pretend nothing happened than acknowledge it.”
She had always known deep down that some day people would start asking questions; she just hadn’t known that day would come so soon.
Hermione is surprised to see Harry arrive at Molly and Arthur’s Christmas Party, albeit an hour late. He looks just about as awful as she expected, dark circles under his eyes, barely brushed curls, frumpy Christmas sweater from five years back. She wonders anxiously how he will react with Draco also being invited to the party, arm in arm with Pansy Parkinson.
“Because of Draco,” Harry repeats reluctantly, his head hung as if in shame. “I’m a horrible person.” It takes a few moments for Hermione to realize the slight shaking of his shoulders is because he’s trying to hold back sobs.
“You also have a lovely name,” Luna says, her blue eyes steady but her lips curving in a smile. “Ginevra. It comes from the Welsh
He would only ever see Draco. And she had to keep his secret, because no one else would understand. No one else truly saw the darkness, the coiled green serpent in his eyes.
His green eyes look at Draco steadily, waiting. Draco can barely breathe, he has so much to say and so very little time. “I always thought I’d be the one to say it first.”
Their last encounter makes his stomach turn. Overhearing Snape offer Draco help, Draco refusing and running off, barely able to even kiss him without holding back tears. A one-sided duel in the Room of Requirement didn’t help.
Pansy’s lips tremble, but she nods, and they remain in each other’s arms on her bed until Draco drifts into a fitful sleep. Later, he feels Pansy untangling her arms, wrapping the robe around her body, and leaving the room. He hears Harry’s voice downstairs, distantly.
“Level four, please,” she says in a gravely voice. Harry nods, pressing the level four button as well as level two. The lift shoots sideways, and the bluebirds fly into the sky crying out, before settling down again, clinging fearfully to their nest. After a moment, the lift drops swiftly, and Harry’s stomach drops with it, never quite used to the terrifying speed of the Ministry lifts.
Draco has gone deathly pale, staring at Harry with an odd, yet almost familiar expression Hermione can’t quite place. What on earth happened between them, Hermione wonders, to elicit such strong reactions?
“One can hardly expect me to know, can they?” Weasley cries. “Fourteen classes to choose from! Why, have
Draco brightens at this. “That’s brilliant, Pansy. Good publicity, and you’ve always fancied her. You must have been over the moon yourself.”
Draco wrenches away, shaking, but Harry keeps him close with a painfully tight grip. “Stop saying those things!” Draco cries.
After Harry left in the morning, Draco can hear Pansy crying in the room across the hall. He tiptoes towards the door, then opens it. She is curled on her bed, her shoulders shaking.
“I simply worry of the divisions at the school, especially with the Slytherin house. How does the Headmistress expect us simply to forget the horrible things done by them during the Battle?”
“But who are we to say what should be easy or not, right?” Harry says, his voice straining in a foreign attempt at lightness. He hastily kisses Draco’s cheek, and Draco turns his head and kisses him on the lips, fully, solidly, without hesitation.
“I did have a choice,” Draco says slowly, sounding almost sober. “Not an easy one, that’s for sure. But I had a choice. You always have a choice.” He pauses, looking down. “I’m not ashamed of those choices Harry. I’m ashamed of our secret. Of letting myself be kept a secret.”
As she walks back down the stairs, she hears a murmur of a familiar voice coming from behind the staircase, hidden from view unless she were to peek over the railing. She pauses and strains her ears.
“All this time?” Pansy repeats faintly. After briefly closing her eyes, she takes a deep breath, and screams,
“I thought that you said the exact opposite, if I recall correctly,” Draco says, trying to hide the utter bitterness he feels. Even drunk, the rejection had a nasty sting with it.
her, and how Ginny saw her too, the rosy cheeks and golden curls, the suppleness of her waist and the trembling of her voice in the air when she says your name like a lone note from a violin.
“Of course you have,” Weasley mutters moodily. “Well, at least Professor Hagrid will be cheerful. Meanwhile Mr Potter and I must manage through Charms ourselves.”
“Can you not play nice for a second, Harry, I mean honestly!” Hermione shouts. “You humiliated him, and he was a guest in my home! Do you have no shame?”
Younger Ron shakes his head as he looks at the doors slamming shut, stunned. “What a nut, that Malfoy, am I right?” He looks to Harry, but he’s barely paying attention, shoving his textbook carelessly in his backpack. Ron frowns when Harry shoves past him, striding determinedly out of the classroom.
Pansy didn't say anything, too wrapped up in Blaise’s honey brown eyes. Draco let his gaze slide back on Harry, like it had been trying to all night.
Was he really going to do this? His brain must not have been working properly, because he continued walking until he reached the door.
She smiles sadly. “Harry put his faith and love in someone who broke it. He will forever blame himself for it. He will forever yearn for some other world where that never happened. And I will forever be the healer of a heartbreak that will never go away.”
He climbs onto her bed and places his arm around her, stroking her hair away from her face. She turns and curls herself against him, hiding her face against his chest.
“You get upset if I don’t see Hagrid, but if I do see Hagrid you get upset anyway!” Ron exclaims, and Hermione whips around fuming, and Harry barely manages to stop before colliding with her.
“Oh all right.” She opens the seals. “This one is for you, Ron. ‘Dear Mr Ron B. Weasley, we are pleased to extend an invitation for your Eighth Year at Hogwarts. Please find enclosed a list of available courses for Eighth Years and their necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September first. We await your owl by no later than July thirty-first. Please reply with your chosen courses.’ Goodness me, it is already the twenty-third! What do they mean by this!”
“Well let’s see,” Pansy says sarcastically, examining her sharp black nails that glow in the firelight. “The boy who broke your heart is asking you to brew an illegal potion
He doesn’t regret it, falling deeper and harder in love. Back in school, sure, they loved each other, they needed each other...but this time it was different. They didn’t
“Good night, Miss Granger,” Weasley says, rising and bowing. Miss Granger and Harry rise with him, then Miss Granger curtsies, and leaves the room.
“Of course!” Hermione smiles. “The Room of Requirement!” Then she frowns as Harry sits back, all the energy leaving him in one fell swoop. “But that’s hardly suspicious, Harry. He might be trying to find something he misplaced. It’s not uncommon.”
He stares at the liquid, a silvery blue color reminiscent of a thread of memory, then he goes back up to his room. After carefully setting the vial down on his nightstand, he goes to sleep.
“I would like to be an auror, though I am not sure my marks from previous years will allow me to do so,” Weasley says, suddenly embarrassed. He steadfastly does not look at Miss Granger.
“Harry?” she calls out. No answer. She climbs the stairs next, trying his bedroom first. The room is dark as death, and she can just make out a curled up figure beneath the blankets. She sits down gently on the edge of the bed. “Harry,” she says, full of pity.
Harry whispers, his wand in the free hand shining on the dark steps to the underground passageway, the fastest way to the kitchens. They reach the portrait, and this time Draco tickles the pear.
Ginny glances across the room at Harry, who is still talking with Ron. They seem to be laughing over something. Harry sees them looking and raises his glass, a small smile on his face that Hermione notices now doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
If he’s learned anything tonight, it’s that he still can’t resist Draco no matter how hard he tries. And oh how he’s tried.
He recalls, unwillingly, the night on the Astronomy Tower, frozen under the Cloak, unable to do anything, unable to look away, forced to watch Draco, sweet, witty, loving Draco, point a wand at his father. And then Snape killed him.
“Mr Malfoy, then,” Harry says coldly. “I am surprised the Ministry would allow someone who plotted the death of Professor Dumbledore inside that very castle ever to return.”
All her clothes save her underwear and robe are bundled up in her arms. She feels satisfied and yet restless, almost anxious. Dean has always made everything so easy for her, even when she made everything so difficult for him.
“I mean,” Harry says, slowly, forcing himself to push the words out. “I thought I was only a friend.”
His legs fall helplessly open, shaking, his mouth open, gasping for breath, his muscles seizing up as his orgasm floods his body, pulsing deep inside until he cannot see, he can only call out Harry’s name and lift his hips up into the burning heat of Harry’s mouth, who swallows, his throat working, the vision beautiful in Draco’s half-intoxicated state.
“Can you still see me?” Draco teases, smirking, but his eyes remain serious. They must not immediately recognize the betrayal of their friendship which they have just committed.
Hermione smiles but she’s sure he sees right through it to the worry that she feels. He’s been more down lately, and it’s quite obvious to anyone who cares to look. She makes a mental note to ask if he’s even showered.
Something grabbed his arm and pulled him in. The door closed and locked behind him and then it was dark.
The doors open wide, and she frowns, having expected Professor Slughorn. Instead, Draco Malfoy trudges in with his usual pride and contempt, sitting next to Pansy in the middle table on the left side of the classroom.
Hermione relents, putting away the Pensive and following Ron back to the bedroom. She thinks she understands, now, but she’s still not certain, and in something like this she would have to be absolutely certain.
“You’re joking right?” Draco wants to laugh and scream and strangle him. “This potion takes weeks at best. It’s a very complicated and dangerous process, not to mention the risks I’m taking acquiring all of the very illegal ingredients. Honestly, Potter, did you do any research?”
He swivels around. It’s Pansy, his best friend, black lipstick stark against her pale face, the same color as her short black hair, the edges devastatingly sharp. She has a dark green scarf around her neck, and an inky black cloak bellowing around her, flowing just below the ankles of her boots.
“I can’t lie to you, Draco,” Harry says with a horrifying honesty and relief, “I’ve wanted to kiss you the moment I saw you at the charity ball.” Harry sighs, pushing even the thought away. “But it’s too dangerous.”
He knew Harry was attracted to women, but for some reason, this new development did not scare him, did not even excite a drop of jealousy. He even liked to watch Harry watching Pansy, and felt a thrill when Pansy saw that Harry was watching, smiled at Draco who she knew had seen this, and accidentally let her robe fall open just enough while Harry was in the middle of speaking, so that he stammered, and looked down, and mentioned that her robe had come undone, and Pansy would act surprised, and Draco would smirk, and then she would refasten her robe.
Harry’s eyes had dilated, his mouth falling open slightly, confused and aroused at the same time. Draco took his momentary distraction to kiss him again, his hands working Harry’s belt open and sliding his pants off.
He leans down and kisses her, tightening his hold on her. But she pulls away, and untangles herself from Harry’s embrace.
Harry turns around, his shoulders tense, blinking away tears. The worst part is that he doesn’t feel conflicted. He doesn’t have a doubt what he is going to do. He just feels ashamed that he already knows.
Though the letter from the Minister alluded to it, and Mrs Weasley herself warned Harry, there could be no preparation for the state of the castle upon arrival.
“Wait here.” She quickly walks over to the other side of the store dedicated to her famous lingerie, and heads over to one of her newer lines. She picks out her favorite one—the one she designed as an homage to a certain schoolgirl crush that has long since faded away, a mark of a simpler time and a more innocent girl, before everything she loved was crushed under the indifferent weight of the war, like a cigarette crushed under the heel of a boot.
“I don’t trust him, Hermione,” Harry says in a low voice, with the smooth persuasiveness that has always struck Ron as somewhat unsettling. “He’s a Death Eater.”
She had felt something with Pansy, something undefinable, almost unexplored, which probably was undefinable
The fire burns out to glowing coals as they kiss, and the room darkens a shade. Draco moves again, this time swinging a leg over Harry’s waist, straddling him. He pulls his shirt off, and helps Harry do the same. Before they kiss again, Harry glances at Pansy, whose robe has become half undone, revealing a narrow strip of stomach, quivering in the dim light.
Pansy says nothing, taking a sip of her coffee. Harry knows her well enough not to ask any more questions. He nods stiffly.
Draco curls his legs around Harry. They can’t sleep without each other. Too many ghosts in the dark, too many secrets better left unsaid.
Harry stands nervously before the door. His scarf tickles his neck uncomfortably. He feels flushed, hot, despite the winter chill creeping past his coat.
“If Harry’s there, what?” Ginny demands. “It’s his apartment, did you think I was just going to waltz back in there? He knows I’m coming.”
are the unspoken words, but they sound very loud to Draco, who bites his lip to stop from screaming out.
“I know that,” Draco says, annoyed. “I’m not stupid.” He starts to pull away, but Harry tugs him closer, and Draco stumbles forward, steadying a hand on Harry’s shoulder, the book falling to the ground with a thud but both of them pay it no notice.
They do not all always get along well. Though Draco and Hermione had long since made amends, he could scarcely look her in the eyes, and they avoided each other’s company alone. Ron always deferred to Hermione, but occasionally he was able to joke around with Draco, though most of the time they were merely cordial.
“Can I?” Harry asks, hooking a finger under the waistband of Draco’s briefs. Draco nods wordlessly, his mouth going dry.
Harry’s heart beats loudly in his chest as he lets Draco pull off his sweater and toss it on the ground, then remove his undershirt with a smirk. They stay apart for a moment, and Draco takes the time to admire Harry, to pass his hands over Harry’s bare chest, with his heartbeat loud like a drum, down his abdomen, tracing the thin line of hair that disappears beneath his jeans.
The chance to tell Harry that he loved him back was gone. And Draco looked down at the pavement, his eyes welling with tears as he realized it.
Of course, he could have just changed the walls with the Color Changing Charm, but Hermione had agreed that it would be more cathartic if Harry painted over them himself.
Harry staggered like he'd been shot. His bottom lip quivered and Draco began to feel a tiny bit bad.
Draco turned to face him. His face was red and swollen from crying. Tears rolled down his face, and he didn't attempt to wipe them away.
Draco decided he was sick of Harry's anger. His nerves felt frayed and he was exhausted from screaming at the top of his lungs.
For a former Slytherin, she was quite chatty, talking about how she and Draco first met, their first date, how he'd proposed, et cetera.
-And that was how Harry Potter found himself sitting on his twin bed in his small flat in his small bedroom in a busy Muggle neighborhood, sobbing his eyes out with Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger on the other end of the phone, because he was
But it didn't matter because Harry was bawling and grasping at empty air, and Draco was never going to listen because Harry was speaking in an emotion Draco didn't understand.
Draco had noticed that he was the only one who liked to encourage Harry's anger, probably because he knew Harry would hold himself back from hurting Draco, because Nott picked up his shirt and scrambled out of the apartment barefoot.
There must have been a faint knock on the door, because Nott had his trousers on all of a sudden and had walked towards the door.
Harry checked the alarm clock in his room, and it was indeed 6:29. He pulled on a clean pair of trousers and went in search of a button-up shirt that wasn't rumpled.
Draco thought with a sudden pang of guilt. Especially given what he had just done, forgetting about their date and sleeping with Nott, and to top it all off, Saint Potter turned up at his apartment
Harry looked like he'd dressed nicely for a change- and Draco's heart dropped. He was wearing the cologne Draco bought him, and Draco stared at his hands because he couldn't bring himself to look into the green eyes that were probably shining with tears.
Maybe it was because Harry was sunshine and grass and the way the wind whipped through your hair on a spring day and Draco was the coldest and stillness of winter.
He didn't want to be in the kitchen in his apartment, holding Harry Potter amidst the shards of glass from the argument earlier scattered on the floor.
Harry looked down at his hands and began to talk shakily about what haunted him most, about watching Sirius fall into the veil and living in the cupboard under the stairs at the Dursleys, and the Dementors.
Sometimes, Harry liked to escape. To find himself in some corner of some Muggle coffee shop where the baristas just smiled blandly or not at all like they did with every customer, called 'Harry, please,' and ignored him as soon as he picked up his coffee.
He didn't know why he even bothered as he tried combing his hair, grimacing at the result in the mirror and dripping a copious amount of water onto the bathroom mat.
Harry smelled like that damned cologne again (Draco was beginning to regret buying it for him) and his confidence was infectious.
amongst other things. She reminded Harry that Ginny had her tryouts for the Holyhead Harpies tomorrow, and Harry made a note to call her and wish her luck.
, Harry thought dreamily. Draco had made no attempt to put a label on their relationship (he just needed more time). But Harry knew he was in love because when he looked at Draco sleeping peacefully beside him, he felt a warm, happy feeling in the pit of his stomach as if he had just cast the Patronus Charm.
Usually, that would have elicited a chuckle and a sassy retort from Harry, but all he'd been able to manage was a weak small fake smile.
It was the third time he'd ever used the Cruciatus Curse, and the first time he'd truly meant it, taken pleasure in seeing someone squirm on the floor, the white-hot rage and anger and
He didn't intend to be noticed. When Harry had told him that he, Granger, and Weasley were going out to celebrate him and Weasley graduating from Auror training, Draco had mumbled some kind of excuse not to come.
And because Harry was a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors are brave, and because bravery means doing something even when you're terrified, he continued.
The cup of coffee wobbled in his hand and spilled all over his favorite pair of jeans. Harry yelped as the hot liquid made contact with his skin, momentarily forgetting he was a wizard and frantically dabbing at the stain and his poor leg with a fistful of napkins when all that was required was a quiet
started to trail its suffocating air around my still frame, my breath halting in the confines of my lungs as my heart gave one last stutter before it seemed to stop in its pulse as I felt a sensation that was threateningly, and magnetically familiar.
“I enjoyed the way you spoke up in each class we had together whenever the professor called on you to answer a question. Those cocksucking lips of yours formed eloquently around the vowels in your seraphic, soft and downy voice. Posh and haughty yet intellectual in its tone. It was addicting to listen to you drone on and on with your answers. You still sound that way. Your arse has gotten even more plump in this tight, petite body you have with the perfect amount of slim, filthy curves you carry around with you.” Harry murmured darkly down at me as he let the hand pressing down on the back of my head, inch the long heat of his fingers through the mess of my strands and grab a fist full of my pale locks to tug my head back in a whiplash motion that made me cry out in warmed pain.
“I’ll be fine. You’ll be with me. I trust that I’m in the right hands for protection. Please Harry? Let me do one good thing for once in my life.” I whispered the words out to Erus, my words barely audible to my own ears as my lips were practically immovable as I looked up at the assassin from beneath my lashes, not caring that Hezian was watching such a vulnerable moment on my behalf as someone who was seen as a stuck up pure blood bitch.
My gaze, heavy lidded and observant, followed down the slim, petite frame of Draco’s graceful figure, the wide width of his hips sluicing from side to side in a subconscious, enticing sway as the long stretch of his stripper legs moved forth and displayed the curvaceous underside of his perky arse. The black, plaid skirt he wore stroked across that creamy pale skin of his, specifically over where Draco’s shapely thighs met his juicy bum.
Having to be in the same outfit Harry put me into when we saw Hezian early this morning save for exchanging the Gryffindor shirt for a simple white long sleeve top, I noticed that the goblins were even more inclined to have their attention on my figure what with how I rarely dressed so casually out in the open.
My stupid prick starting to rise against the towel wrapped around me as I gaped up at the man prowling towards my nervous frame. I let out a indignant huff, shaky and hot as I snapped at Potter for his insults, trying to hide the anxiety and damage to my erratic heart from the assassin’s assault on my person. “Fuck off Potter, you don’t know anything about me. I-If I’m so disgusting then why don’t you leave me the hell alone?”
“This is my motorcycle. It’s called Thanos, you know, like from Avengers?” Harry’s voice was dipped low in the deep of his husky timbre, making my heart slam painfully against my ribcage as I bundled up the fabric of my skirt and entangled it with my nervous fingers, aroused at the sight Harry displayed and the bike he owned.
Harry had me stay with him at his place and had declared that I would be living with him from now on. Which I had no problem with after having pronounced that we were both in love with each other and became an official couple.
” The assassin drew out the deep timbre of his voice that whispered over my thrumming mouth, causing an uptick in my pulse from the way Harry kept his gaze fixated on the nibbling on my lip.
I couldn’t help but watch the way Harry’s veins in his forearms stood out beneath his flesh, the strength evident in the way his biceps and triceps flexed beneath every casual breath the Assassin inhaled and exhaled, dangerous hands left almost dangling off the edges of the chair’s arm rests with how laid back the man was before me.
Every thrust of the Gryffindor’s fingers into my mouth and down my throat made my cock ache with the need for friction, but I couldn’t
