‘We’ll go first thing in the morning,’ Draco agreed. ‘Or now, if that’s what you wish. You’ve been more than—’
‘Knowledge. Secrets. Information from the inside. I know what Riddle is trying to do in the Caribbean. I’ve seen his plans. And I‘ll be… ’ he leaned back and ran his tongue slowly on his upper lip, ‘... very
The mattress dipped. ‘Harry?’ Draco whispered. ‘Are you asleep?’
‘He’s—'
‘Please.’
The corpse opens milky white eyes, staring into Harry’s.
Draco gave him an unfathomable look and shut the door behind him. Harry opened the window, letting the wind cool his clammy face. He didn’t need sleep after his visions — in fact he dreaded it, because it’d be easier to slip into another one. What he needed were strong sensations to ground him to his body. Harry leaned outside the window, the wind lashing at his hair, whipping it back from his face. The rustling of the trees sounded like sea waves if he closed his eyes. He filled his lungs with the smell of spring, buds and grass and pollen, and he mulled over the news.
,’ he gritted out.
Momentarily stunned at the beauty of the man, Harry launched into speech. ‘Help me,’ he said. ‘I’m lost, and it’s cold, and I can hear the wolves coming near.’
‘They didn’t stay long,’ he replied. ‘It was similar— but not exactly the same.’
Longbottom turns redder than Weasley, a true beetroot red, and Draco laughs. ‘I was kidding, I’m sorry.’ He shrugs. ‘My mind’s all Potter, I’m afraid.’
Harry’s brain stilled. ‘You… er… kissed a boy?’
Draco coughed lightly. ‘That would be me.’
Draco looked away. ‘I don’t dare to hope.’ He tossed another pebble in the water.
A light in the distance promised salvation. A farmhouse probably, offering the chance of a dry bed and some food. He picked up his speed, pushing through his fatigue to get there faster.
Draco’s drowning — he’s not sure in what. All he knows is he can’t breathe. ‘I want to make love to you tonight,’ he hears himself say.
that particular smell clinging to them all. He swallows hard.
Draco had never enjoyed such bliss before—so, naturally, Potter (the real Potter, not
‘Usually about Voldemort.’
Malfoy downs his champagne in one. ‘I prefer vodka,’ he says and heads to the exit.
‘I won’t wear a flower crown!’ Blaise objected.
‘Don’t want you here?’ Dawn asked.
Tears run down his face, and a warm hand is cupping his cheek.
‘Yeah,’ Harry blushed. ‘A bit. Well, a lot. Twice I spilled bubotuber pus on me in Potions, because I was looking at your hands. I sort of—er, showed up where I thought you might be. And once I wrote your name in my textbook and Ron saw it and—’
At first Harry assumed his friend, Ron, had followed him to the tavern, but the red hair belonged to a stranger in dark grey with a freckled face. There was something about his posture and the tilt of his head that pleased Harry. He ordered another goblet of whatever the man was drinking to be sent to him.
Owls whooshed overhead and a
‘Sure,’ Harry chimed in. He glanced at the picture of Lady Di on the assistant’s mug and was struck by another desperate idea. ‘I don’t know if you’ve recognised him, but Fenston here is seventeenth in line to the throne.’ He crossed his fingers behind his back, hoping the lady didn’t know the order of succession too well.
Potter scuffed the toe of his shoe on the ground. ‘Has it changed much inside?’
Harry busies himself with his drink for something to do. The reality of who he’s with suggests that this idea — Malfoy and Harry together, having a drink, talking their way into bed — will lead to catastrophe, but it’s not enough to make him leave. That wet dream with Malfoy has left its hooks in him, and he’s nothing if not curious.
‘That’s not my hand, Potter.’
Draco fed him another piece of cheese. ‘The first time I sampled your local delicacy,’ he said, eating a piece and licking his fingers, ‘was at a tavern at the edge of town. I had a casual encounter, too, dear husband. Someone that I couldn’t take my mind off for days.’
‘What do you mean?’
?’ she replied fondly. ‘And— when I asked him out— did he—?’
‘You knew I’d be able to touch it. Only me.’
The tavern was known for turning a blind eye to the casual encounters of men in the loos and the back alleys. Harry’d been there before with some of his knights to drink and mingle with the commoners, but never to indulge his carnal desires. Now he sat at the bar among farmhands from the fields around the capital, potters and painters of the city’s ceramic workshops, and fishermen from the villages half an hour’s ride away. Drinking his ale, he idly examined the men until bright red hair snagged his attention.
‘That had
I am happy to hear your convalescence is going well. […]
They were in the grounds now, climbing the hill to the castle.
‘Did you hear…?’ Malfoy asked. His eyes glistened in the night.
‘Just all right?!’ Draco let out a peal of laughter. Harry marvelled at how he could tuck away his pain like that, shove it somewhere out of sight. At dinner he’d been quiet and introspective, picking at his food. Now, propped next to Harry on his elbow, he preened, his expression elated. He leaned over Harry, his breath on Harry’s mouth. ‘I think you like my hair.’ A brush of lips. ‘No, you
And almost had a heart attack.
‘Like you said,’ Draco says. ‘She didn’t see it coming.’
‘No, no!’ McNair wrestled against his bonds. He knew a death sentence when he heard one. ‘I’ve money! I’ll pay you!’ The indifference to his promises enraged him. Harry had already turned away, signalling to Dennis and Seamus to take him away. ‘Don’t touch me,’ the man spat out, ‘you filthy scum, you—’
He digs his fingers deep in Draco’s sides when Draco doesn’t reply immediately. His pelvis presses down on Draco’s; short, intense rolls, the movement punctuating Harry’s words. ‘Do.
‘I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that,’ Longbottom apologises swiftly. ‘It’s just what people say. I’m not really clear on what Incubuses are.’
‘Yes, but—’ Draco paused. ‘Are you really going to make me say it?’
The lake came closer, widening, and Harry and Malfoy fell in the cold, murky water, scaring the birds that took off with loud cries. Malfoy grabbed Harry and pulled him towards a patch of tall reeds, a little off the shore. Letting go of Harry’s hand, he sank under the surface and reappeared, rubbing his streaming face. Then he reached out and touched the back of Harry’s head. Harry stiffened.
Weasley, however, seemed unaware of any bad blood as he joked with Pansy about Saturday night. Two badges gleamed on his uniform: Head Boy and Captain of the Quidditch team.
‘Hush now. Let me take care of you.’ Malfoy’s robes rustle as he grinds his pelvis against Harry’s throbbing cock. He moans softly as his movements become faster, his own erection digging in Harry’s groin. Keeping both of Harry’s wrists pinned with one hand, Malfoy shoves Harry’s robes out of the way and unzips his trousers. His probing hand wraps around Harry’s prick. ‘Merlin, this feels good.’
Amused, Harry waited on the platform, keeping an eye on the train notices, while Draco marched to the shop’s counter. He peered at the menu high on the wall and poked at the change some more before ordering.
Draco cleared his voice. ‘Let me…’ He rose to his elbow. Propped over Harry, Draco gazed at him with enigmatic eyes, cupped his cheek and kissed him.
‘I knew a Bob who died in the war.’
He ran out of words but didn’t need to finish. Draco grabbed him, arms wrapping firm around Harry. Harry held tight, savouring Draco’s summer-storm scent, his familiar warmth. His heartbeat thudded against Draco’s, a small symphony of life, while the night whispered around them.
It was as if everyone had decided to trust him with their most precious secrets. His past self (Slytherin, Malfoy), trained from a young age to look for ways to use a situation to his profit, would have been delighted at all the opportunities for blackmail he’d have if he returned to the real world. His father certainly would be over the moon. However, every moment Draco spent in this world of laughter, a world where people’s main source of anxiety was the amount of coursework piled on them, resolved his decision to stay put. He wasn’t going anywhere. In fact, he much preferred this version of Potter.
‘Please, do it,’ he repeated, his hips grinding against Draco’s hard cock.
Draco said, ‘The forest took them.’
of them and also so afraid of what might happen to them. His hatred of Voldemort consumed him; everything circled back to
. The thought made Harry breathless as he fucked Draco harder with his fingers, slick and hot and snug inside his arse. A tremour travelled over Harry’s skin, desire rising like the tide, saturating every part of him with one, urgent desire: to enter Draco. Smearing oil on his cock, he settled between Draco’s knees and pushed in, holding his breath as he breached Draco.
‘Which is the nearest room?’ Draco nips on Harry’s neck, pushing him backwards into the house.
Draco laughed. ‘I agree with you, they’re terrible.’ He didn’t dare admit he was becoming very fond of his.
Malfoy looked sick, but not particularly surprised. Harry rose to his feet. ‘He Crucioed your parents. You can imagine what that was like.’
He kisses Draco fiercely, mainly to shut him up, and Draco responds with an unholy kiss that would make the devil blush. It’s wet and messy, filthy, deep, hungry and desperate. He kisses like a man condemned, wrapping his legs around Harry and grinding their pricks together. Harry’s stupendously hard already. He shoves Draco back, and asks breathlessly, ‘The books say my arousal feeds you. What about yours?’
Harry pulled back to look at him in the eye. ‘Can’t say I’ve tasted you to know.’ He paused before adding meaningfully, ‘Yet.’
‘Yeah?’ Harry mumbled, eyes closing.
, his groin a pool of fire.
‘Painful?’
‘Do you think he’ll fall for it?’ he whispered, as Rookwood blundered into trees, exclaiming ‘There you are!’ and ‘I see you now!’
It must be a dream, it
She looked heart-broken. Draco blinked fast as he held her and he murmured something in her ear. She patted his back and whispered something back to him, glancing at Harry. Then, she cupped his face. ‘B’ezrat hashem.’
‘Are you alright?’
Nariyoshi stares at them. He stares for rather some time, and Draco frets.
‘That was me.’
‘I missed you, ‘sall,’ Draco murmured, as he wrapped a hand around Harry’s cock, and stroked it slowly. He looked his fill as the cock responded to his strokes. It was by far the best thing Draco had ever touched. Something so spectacular surely belonged to a museum. Draco ran his thumb over the vein and the silky soft top, enjoying the warm throbbing weight in his palm. Harry moaned, a happy smile on his face, and Draco shuffled down and ran his tongue on the underside. He met Harry’s eyes, taking courage from his blissful expression, and took the head in his mouth, sucking lightly. His own erection pressed against the sheets, but Draco kept his eyes trained on Harry and continued his exploration. He licked his balls, putting them in his mouth gently and sucking softly before returning to the shaft and mapping it with his tongue, slowly, carefully, trying to imprint it in his mind. Harry made delightful noises that spurred Draco on. Hollowing his mouth, he sucked faster, harder, using one hand to stroke his own cock. Harry, eyes dark and glazed with lust, lifted his hips, fucking Draco’s mouth, looking so beautiful and so decadent that Draco came on his sheets a moment before Harry came in his mouth.
It was farther than Harry had assumed. He let his thoughts drift back to the Manor, back to the things he’d heard there, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. His thoughts beat with the rhythm of his footsteps on the ground. Hallows… Horcruxes… Hallows… Horcruxes… The obsessive longing for the Hallows burned in him, but his worry about his friends and the predicament he found himself in had dimmed the fire. No matter how much it’d cost him to lose the holly and phoenix wand, he hadn’t had to do without one completely. Despair filled him. He felt impotent. The loss of his wand crushed him more than before, because he was beginning to understand, and he knew — he could feel — Voldemort beginning to understand as well. He knew where the Elder Wand had been all this time and Harry, unable to stop what was about to happen, knew that he’d lost. He’d lost one of the Hallows.
Harry was, once again the first to show up at dinner and the first to leave, gulfing down as much food as he could before Ron, Hermione or Draco arrived. He didn’t know why he was avoiding them, since they were the ones who didn’t want to be Harry’s friends anymore, but Harry was gone before most students started trickling into the great hall anyway.
All three of them were up on brooms, with Blaise and Pansy both holding bags of Ping-Pong balls. They threw the balls far and wide in the court, and Draco flew around for hours and hours until the sun went down, and Pansy complained of the cold.
get any tears on that book.” She edged closer to take a look at the cover and realized it was a book that was more recently written. At least miss Granger was not damaging an old and irreplaceable book. She watched keenly as Hermione pushed the book away from her face but was angered to see that she kept sobbing.
“Blimey Harry, I think that’s the first time Professor Snape’s ever taken points from Slytherin!” Neville whispered into Harry’s ear, but Harry was too preoccupied worried as to why Draco had been in the infirmary. Why hadn’t he known?
“You can see for yourself and leave.”
“Of course I do, Malfoy.” Ron glared at him a little.
Checking to ensure that no students were around, she sat down next to her. “Why has reading about blood purity made you so upset, miss Granger?” She was only concerned for the state of her book, she told herself in her mind, not of the student.
“Harry, what’re you — ?”
was Harry Potter such an idiot? Draco stood in front of the mirror, glaring at the golden script on his torso. All his life, the words had been dull, almost yellow. Now it stood as gold as ever, stark against his skin. Of course, the scrawl would be in gold, it was Harry Potter after all.
let's go.” Draco descended sharply, flying faster and faster still. The snitch, as if realizing that it had been spotted, began to whizz away from them both. Draco realized then that he and Terrence were on a collision course headed for each other. He turned his broom sharply, missing Terrence by an inch and almost getting thrown off in the process.
‘What did you expect, turnips?’ said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
“Just an hour since the end of class, Professor Snape told me I should come visit you.” Draco smiled at his friend and tried to sit up in bed, feeling surprised when he realized he could.
Harry woke up the next morning not quite able to decipher the events of the previous night. The four of them had faced a giant three-headed dog, and barely escaped from it. He hadn’t been able to tell Ron or Hermione where he had disappeared to, but Hermione wasn’t speaking to any of them anymore, exceptionally annoyed at the amount of trouble they got into the previous night.
“Lastly, your father has
“But why can’t we fall asleep here?”
She even pulled out several cookies from her bag for the disgruntled looking owl, who after inspecting her, gave her an approving look followed by chatter she did not understand at all.
“Harry-“
She glanced at her own on her wrist and stepped away from the changing table, breathing becoming erratic. She knew immediately that her life and Draco’s had changed in a drastic manner. Narcissa wasn't a death eater, but being married to one, and coming from a family that closely associated the Dark Lord and his pureblood ideologies, she knew who the Potters were. She knew how terrible Draco's fate would be if anyone found out who his soulmate was. She thought, briefly of Andromeda and how she had barely escaped with hers and Ted's life, banished purely because of who her soulmate was.
“What’s the book, Harry?” Hermione asked him casually as they waited outside the dungeons for Snape to let them in for their potions class that morning. Harry knew that she had seen the cover but showed it to her anyway. She gave him a nod but didn’t talk to him again. He did hear Ron asking her if it was okay to be friends with Harry again, but missed the rest of their conversation when Neville asked him if he wanted to partner up. Harry had no choice but to agree.
“But Master Dra-“
She noticed that a house-elf had already arrived with Draco's bottle and his freshly laundered clothes. The elf sped around, bringing Narcissa Draco’s diapers, clothes, and other things as she began to undress Draco.
Draco stared at the last sentence and gulped, wondering where his thoughts were taking him.
“Hullo,” said the boy, having noticed Harry. “Hogwarts too?” He had a posh sort of accent, and Harry immediately knew he was rich, compared to the Surrey accents he was used to.
Harry didn’t have the time to respond as Ron’s attention was diverted by the knowledge that he was in the presence of a Nimbus 2000.
Draco sat at the foot of his Christmas tree with his mother and grandfather. His father was not at home, but that was usual. Lucius Malfoy was never at home for Christmas. He got the promised Nimbus 2001 from his parents, although he was sure his father didn’t even know his mother had bought it. His mother had gotten him several new robes, all rich shades of navy, purple velvet, and green silk. He secretly wanted to make Harry try the silk robe, knowing it would bring out his eyes beautifully.
He had expected anyone at all except for the boy he had met at Madam Malkin’s in the compartment.
It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled, and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
“I’m coming down there with you. I can’t let you go alone.” The dark-haired boy whispered.
“The sandwiches will get cold if you don’t eat them, Mr Malfoy.” Draco picked one up gingerly and took a bite, then another when he realized how hungry he was. “It is also imperative that you do not allow
Harry felt so happy unwrapping Mrs. Weasley’s jumper, followed by Hermione’s chocolate frogs. This was by far the most presents he had ever received in his life, and he had two more presents to unwrap!
When Harry finally drifted off to sleep, he dreamed of pale silver eyes.
“I must, I must bind this knowledge in your mind, dobby.” Narcissa was gentler as she pulled her wand out. “It is for all of our safety.” Dobby looked too relieved, and Narcissa wondered if the elf had been expecting her to kill it.
With his sights set on the snitch, which was still whizzing away, Draco gave chase. He knew once Terence turned around that only he had sights of the snitch. Terence was following him blindly.  He reached out for the snitch, now only feet away from it, and then realized Terence was on his tail. Deciding in the last moment that the risk was too great, he took a sharp right turn, leading Terence away from the snitch before diving back down suddenly.
“How are you?” Draco asked, standing at the foot of Harry’s bed. Was this the same boy who had been his best friend for most of the year? Was this the same boy who had been so angry at him for no reason after that quidditch match.
Hello, this fic is slowly being revised and edited. At the moment, there aren't any major plot changes happening during the revisions, but please bear with me as I work on making this a bit better!
“The dark lord has told me of the importance of having more pureblood children in the world today.” Lucius offered as an explanation. He stood up and circled her, and she felt none of the romance nor anticipation she used to with him. Only cold dead fear.
“Can you call in sick and not play?”
“Yes,” Draco responded patiently. “They are the ones who cook our meals and cleans the whole castle.” Harry felt very warm and comfortable next to Draco.
“Mom,” Draco gasped, but remembered to stay quiet. He lost consciousness before he could say Harry’s name.
Narcissa made one last stop that night, standing over the great big sleeping body of Vernon Dursely, she cast a hex ensuring that he would not sleep another restful night ever again in his life. Of course, she would have loved to outright strangle the man in his sleep, she felt, for once in her life inexplicable hatred towards a muggle, enough to even cast an unforgiveable curse.
the entire Slytherin quidditch team with brand new
“What are we going to do about that?” Remus muttered from beside her, stroking Sirius’ hair absentmindedly. Only the four of them knew about Harry’s soul mark, but they didn't really know what to do about it. They only knew Harry needed to be protected, and maybe having a soulmate who was the son of a death eater would have some form of advantage.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.
“Fred.” Draco nodded carefully, unsure what to say. It wasn’t uncommon for wizards to be gay, he knew that, but it was sometimes difficult to explain soulmate connections with light wizards to parents.
“Snape will be refereeing the next quidditch game.” Harry moaned into Draco’s robe, and although he knew Harry was trying to play it off, he felt Harry’s fear.
TW: Slapping a child
“Seriously, why are you so slow? Should we call Dobby for help? Or is Dobby too busy intercepting my letters?” Draco closed his eyes and went on picking up pixies from the floor, ignoring his side entirely.
Why oh
“I noticed how the other boys walked straight through the wall there.” He lowered his voice a notch. “is that the way to platform nine and three quarters?”
“No, Hermione. I’m leaving.” And he took off running from the classroom, Hermione and Ron were left with no choice but to follow, leaving Draco behind. Draco was more worried about having to walk to the great hall for lunch when a shadow emerged from behind the door. Draco glanced up at a set of familiar dark robes and paled even further.
“Yes, yes they do.” She took in a breath. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in?” She asked suddenly, changing the subject, but before either one of them could reply, “I’ve been asking around and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I hear Dumbledore himself was one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad… Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” And she was gone as fast as she had arrived. Ron blinked twice as if to shake himself awake from a daze.
He followed them closely, nearly shouting out loud when the oldest disappeared between the two platforms. He kept his eyes glued to every movement each of the next two boys made as well, and after the third had gone through, he approached the woman.
“Harry...” They finally made eye contact. “Harry why are you so mad at me?”
“Are you a muggle?” It was a word Hagrid had used to describe the Dursely's and Harry had an inkling that word meant that they were ordinary people and not wizards.
Thankfully, he and Ron had Hermione to help them out through the original muggle technology barriers from the get-go. Eventually, all the students at Hogwarts were on their phones non-stop. Harry often had to stop some of the younger years from running right into him in the halls from not paying attention to where they were walking, too enamored with their handheld devices.
But out of the corner of his sight, he noticed Malfoy stand up from his booth and head over to the stage in a manner similar to the last time. Harry felt his heart speed up as Malfoy grabbed the microphone, adjusting it to his height once again.
He eyed an album with a man with an orange lightning bolt painted on his face, and the current song changed if the small scratching sounds were anything to go by.
“Reading about them, yeah,” Ron sniggered into her shoulder as she punched him lightly in the side.
It was clear Potter wasn’t the one who wrote these so-called ‘rules’, if the use of ‘him’ was anything to go by. Brushing aside the worry he felt at that, he sidled closer to Potter, who seemed to be somewhat twitchy with the expectation of what was to come.
genres of stuff out there.”
The room was eerily silent for a few seconds before Harry looked over to Luna and the rest, and then conversations started anew slowly.
He watched as water rained down on his cock as well, and wondered what was shower water versus precum that was making Malfoy’s dick glisten like that.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised as he raised a finger to his lips, tapping lightly on the lower one, and Harry gritted his teeth at the nonchalant act.
He did have a lot to thank him for, that was for sure.
He didn’t want to keep Malfoy waiting, he thought a tad hysterically, as he got into his position.
"Yeah well, Head Auror Potter didn't have the same ring to it." Harry stated dryly, and almost jumped in alarm when Malfoy laughed.
Harry glanced between Rodrick and Malfoy and then back at Rodrick again before muttering thanks to the man, who seemed much too smug.
Harry had a pained look on his face as he tried to convey to Ron that he didn't need any vacation and that he was perfectly fine, but of course, Ron just stood up from his spot at the table and pecked his wife on the cheek.
Harry wasn’t paying them much mind, as he looked up from his butterbeer, watching Malfoy levitate a plate full of multi-colored shots to another table where his Slytherin comrades were waiting.
However, his attention was drawn to a few others taking their chance at surfing further out in the water.
Especially Draco.
Luna must have finally broken away from greeting guests and floated over to Harry at some point; he wasn’t sure when. He was too busy trying to count the number of sequins on Draco’s silver vest.
“And why in Merlin’s tits did they have the Department of Magical Accidents and-
Once, he sat down Harry felt someone else looking his way and turned to see Hermione giving him one of her favorite looks, the one she gave him when he did something foolish.
Draco watched, delighted, as Harry pushed back onto the toy, back and forth, trying desperately to get that vibration feeling where he needed it most.
Humming in thought, Draco turned to walk past Potter towards the exit in case he needed to make a hasty getaway when he felt a hand come up to stop him, lightly holding him back on his chest.
“Are you trying to kill me, Potter?” Malfoy drawled as he eyed the man before him with a particular glint in his eyes, “Do you know how sexy you look in those trousers. I bet it took you ages to get them on before coming out here.”
“Brilliant.”
Harry wasn’t quite sure what was going to happen, and he had a sudden chill of embarrassment for Malfoy who hadn’t even begun singing!
At the sound of the floo, Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. "Oh, thank Merlin, they're here!"
Harry always thought that sort of thing was a bit much personally, but he was still keenly aware that it brought a soft smile to Draco’s features when his boyfriend would lean down and kiss his pale cheek.
He figured he was already pushing Malfoy’s patience as it was. He knew how desperately Malfoy himself was craving a glass of whiskey, and knowing the prat, he will wait till Harry is out of the shower to open the bottle.
“He’s rather good, isn’t he? Wouldn’t have suspected a former death eater of having many talents, yet here we are.”
For starters, he didn’t want to see Draco’s boyfriend and his work partner snuggling by the fire all night. Or
As he sat in Potions class later that day, Harry’s mind drifted to the peephole again, wondering if Malfoy would even be there again that night.
Harry was patting down his ‘too-tight’ trousers as he stared at himself in the mirror, he hated Ginny and her friends for harassing him into wearing these ridiculous pants that showed off a bit too much for his typical liking.
Everyone but Malfoy.
“I gather you figured it out then?” Hermione’s mouth was upturned in a humorous grin of sorts.
_____________________________
Harry imagined bucking backward into the feeling, sitting on his face and forcing him to go even deeper as a punishment for eating him out in front of his bloody boss. He felt more sweat run down his face from holding back, and eventually, he felt the upper half of his body sag, defeated in knowing Draco had him right where he wanted.
Then Draco had to go and push his tongue inside him as far as he could, and Harry raised his hand to cover his mouth as a groan almost escaped.
That makes sense, Harry thought mutely, before he moved back in position to see through the hole again before his brain happened to come back with a win against his cock, wouldn’t want that after all.
“The name of the muggle singer from that record you’re eyeing. Do keep up, Potter.”
“This was a great choice on your behalf, Mr. Potter, as this is one of our most popular floors, as it’s the very top of the condo. You have a perfect view of the ocean from your room in particular.”
His body turned again, but this time he was facing Harry fully, his right shoulder leaning against the wall where the shower head was connected, so his body was still under the water, but his front was taking up most of his vision.
He had his fill and needed to get as far away from Malfoy and his amazing cock and spectacular body as he could and never mention his escapades to anyone ever.
Ron would probably kill him, then vomit. Or vice versa.
"But you didn’t do anything...?" Harry said but Malfoy was already at the fireplace.
His eyes caught grey ones from across the Great Hall, and he almost dropped the egg spatula.
He wanted to hex himself for being so blatantly obvious.
Draco tsked before pulling out his wand and quickly whispering a spell, loving the fight or flight instincts that kicked in with the man on the bed, as his wide, curious eyes become darker and angrier for a split second as ropes wrapped around his arms, tying him to the headboard of the bed.
He wasn’t burnt down there as far as he could remember and he felt Malfoy’s hands press down a little harder where he had a few knots in his lower back. Harry bit out a groan as one of the knots loosened under Malfoy’s magical hands.
It was all over every wireless station, every magazine, and shop sign in Diagon.
And that particular thought only reminded him further that he genuinely needed to ask Hermione’s advice on Mind Healers soon.
But instead, he had a ball to attend later that week.
He moaned wantonly, pressing up even more towards the man above him, wordlessly asking for more, and Malfoy seemed to be in a giving mood then.
Just the two of them, and no one else to watch.
“What do you need?” Draco asked in his still magically enhanced voice, clenching his jaw, the need to move inside  Potter so overwhelming he could hardly hold back. But Potter just leaned his head back and  said unabashedly, “Fuck me harder.”
“I love you. And if you don’t know that by now, you are an idiot.”
“Harry! Come come, how were last week’s raids? Are the new recruits up to snuff?”
His blood pounded as his body hit wave after wave of sublime release, but then his mind caught up with what just transpired, and he was confident that his heart stopped. For one terrifying millisecond, he was sure the Slytherin had caught him.
A millisecond passed before Draco whisked them both out of sight without letting Pansy know.
Malfoy finally reached down slowly and slid the wet undergarments off, throwing them to the side under the bench somewhere.
Harry kept relatively silent for the remainder of the night as he watched his mates get progressively drunker as the evening wore on into nightfall.
A few more seconds passed as Harry stared down at the man lying partially on him, the moon coming through the windows and shining on his pale back beautifully.
Hermione sighed, "Yes, I believe you now. I've never heard of a curse like this, though."
- Harry was more than amenable to having a calm and relaxing eighth year, and doing whatever the hell it was he wanted to.
“You should be,” Harry muttered into his salad, feeling the other man’s gaze on him from across the table.
He knew he sounded rather cross, but it was either that or him moaning wantonly to his department and boss from the perfectly aimed thrusts his boyfriend was currently treating himself to from behind him.
Harry barely noticed that Malfoy had forgotten to take his collection of soaps and conditioners back with him this time, and Harry could only assume he would be back again tomorrow. With a thrill at that tantalizing thought, Harry quickly left as well, after casting a quick cleaning charm on himself, then stood up on trembling legs and exited the narrow space for the night.
“Good boy.” Jakob hummed towards Potter, clearly pleased, as he strapped on the new o-ring gag tight over his mouth.
He shucked off the outer layer of his dress robes while he was at it and headed towards the entrance to give it to the man who was in charge of watching the invitees’ belongings.
The man strode up quickly towards Draco as he stood his ground, eyeing him with discontent, “I could ask you the same question.” Draco felt relief when his fingers circled his wand under his robes.
“Ouch! What the hell was that for?!”
It gave him an excellent outlet to sit and think without Ron and Seamus badgering him consistently.
“It’s quite alright. Jealousy is a completely normal feeling. Though, average and below you, if I do say so myself.”
He bristled then and turned around again to face the array of soaps at his disposal. But the thought of Harry using the sex toy was enough to entice other parts of him, as his cock came to life, and Harry groaned pitifully, staring down at it woefully.
of an accident.
Instead of washing up like his schedule usually demanded the past few nights, Malfoy went straight into the good stuff, his hand reaching down to touch his already hard prick, a barely-there touch that had him groaning deep in his throat already.
Harry wouldn't even call them trunks at all, more like a wet towel the man draped over his nether-regions.
“Oh no, Potter. We have something special in store for you.”
In response, Potter only bit his bottom lip as he gazed up at him, and Draco wanted to rip it out and bite it himself.
“Oh, I didn’t even bother to ask…”
And there he was, down by the shore. Harry almost stood up to stop whatever he was doing to the other man, but he slowly realized he helped him learn how to use his board.
Sighing and muttering under his breath, Harry fidgeted in his seat, desperately trying to think of any other reason why he would be staying here later than usual.
Was it just him, or did the Slytherin was staring fixedly right at Harry from the other side of the wall, almost as if he could see through the stone?
The Slytherin was wearing a dark burgundy robe, tied up in the front but enough leeway to allow his lithy chest to show, his pale legs strutting up to the shower stall as he bent over and laid his shower supplies in a cubby hanging lowly on the wall.
Surrounded by a myriad of people, stood Harry sodding Potter in the flesh.
. All you have to do is ask, and you shall receive. I was wondering what I was going to have to get you for Christmas, but I think you’ve answered that for me.”
Most hardly did or forgot halfway through and Harry would need to remind them.
Harry should have known better to try and deter him, though, as his clever hands pushed at the back of his thighs, maneuvering Harry’s straight legs back into his earlier position, on his knees.
He slapped him on his arse once more, relishing in the red mark left, and smirked down at the answering whine from his lover as he walked over to their closet and opened up the uppermost drawer where they kept their most prized possessions.
The sub looked down towards the ground before shrugging. “Jakob said I never needed one with him.”
And horrendous it was, Harry thought, laughing out loud at the performance with Dean, Seamus, and Ron cackling beside him too.
“Are you...erm. Gonna stay for a while?”
“I’ll tell Molly you said that.”
Once he finally got around to listening to the blasted song in question, he couldn’t blame Typhon for sending all the hate his way.
If only his dad knew the circumstances he was using his cloak for.
“What do you need? Tell me." Harry groaned as he saw Malfoy staring down at his face and his arse, where he greedily took in the plug from where he was fucking him with it.
Harry then realized he was nude, which generally isn’t an issue around Malfoy with their professions. But considering the circumstances, he felt like he was seventeen again, and Malfoy was here to rough him up a bit.
No, it was both, he realized as he felt his erection rub up against his trousers. The worst day to not wear pants, he decided, but he couldn’t find that he minded much. The roughness of his trousers felt nice against his cock, which was plumping up at the mere sounds coming from Potter’s mouth.
But in a deep, dark trench of his mind, Harry knew it was more than admiring a simple beauty. But he wasn’t about to travel down that road.
This was his first vacation, after all, well, if you don’t count that one time that Hermione dragged Ron and him to Disney World.
“Yes, yes! I know what you mean.” Harry then realized Malfoy was talking about the song Typhon had sent him, which was still playing inside.
Draco sniffed unpleasantly; he wouldn’t be needing that. Then again, he wondered who was in charge of this whole shindig if they allowed wizards and witches to bring their wands into a room where a man is clearly in a position in which he is entirely unable to defend himself.
“Oh, erm, hey Ron. Just uh - popping in the kitchens for some late snacks, I’ll be right back.”
That was enough permission for Harry then, as he dove down and nosed Draco’s trousers, sucking lightly on his already leaking erection popping through his jeans.
Well, except perhaps the ropes Draco keeps in the bottom drawer of his bedside table.
But a part of his mind wonders if he ever had him to start with.
“Well, glad it was more your speed than
Harry eyed the drink menu and decided on a Mai Tai, never having tried one before, and having heard from Luna that it was a rather good Muggle drink.
He tried feeling put-out by that, but honestly, the fact that he didn’t have to acknowledge his presence was one of the bright spots of his day thus-far. Even if he couldn’t discreetly hex Justin’s not-so perky arse like he was so used to doing.
The bartender smirked knowingly at him, and Harry didn't really know what to make of it, as he watched the man take two different mixed drinks and began shaking them simultaneously, keeping his eyes on Harry as he did so.
He always hated it when the old lump did that.
“Yesss!”
He had felt morose about it many times before. This time, however, he found himself wanting to grab Malfoy by the waist, push him against the wet, tiled wall, and kiss and lick every single one of those scars until the other man was writhing from his ministrations.
He did have to wonder where his oaf of a boyfriend was. He hadn’t come in with him; that much was evident unless he met him at some point after. Or perhaps he had other obligations and was planning on coming here later.
Harry wrapped the towel around his damp hips and chanced a glance at his partner’s way, to see his own gaze watching him intently.
As he was passing the couch, a rustling sound came out of nowhere, and Harry initially summed it up to be a side-effect from the dragon juice at first, but then a few others looked upwards at the ceiling towards where the sound was coming from as well.
Harry tried to hide the jolt of aggravation at Draco calling him by his last name.
Hermione pulled out her wand and tried the same incantations and a few more Harry had never heard of, but she got the same result. Nothing.
Malfoy kept eyeing him, giving him a long look of
He watched as the mistletoe floated over his head and past him. That was when Harry realized some sort of invisible force was forcing him to walk faster, practically dragging him across the sitting room and towards Draco and Justin.
“Merlin, I am such a fucking lunatic. Like some stupid fourteen-year-old girl in a sad movie.”
Draco blinked.
He resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes.
Harry sucked in a breath at that, as he squeezed the bottom of his cock.
Dean managed to transfigure an old tattered book into an old ragged...piece of wood set up by one of the outer Hogwarts walls. Harry added some stone steps and charmed the wood to hover off the ground a few feet.
It was almost too much to bear.
He started to eat his salad.  Thankfully no more broken plates ensued as the evening transitioned into a lighter mood. Malfoy began telling him a story about how Neville almost broke his leg when Malfoy tried to teach him how to surf when he came down one summer.
“What’s got you so down, Harry?”
Almost.
Draco remembered how closed off Harry,
Or twenty.
“The song that’s playing in there, you know the artist?”
“Let’s get this over with, shall we, Potter?”
Harry bottled up the argument that was forming on the tip of his tongue as he looked back up at the happy couple before him. His best mates’ genuinely hopeful expressions were hard to stay angry at or quarrel over.
He had fallen asleep with that plan in mind, but when he woke up, he found himself pretending to forget the little promise his old self made only six hours previously, as he got up and prepared for the day, feeling out of sorts and incredibly horny.
Harry jumped a good foot in the air, searching for the voice and finding Malfoy casually leaning against one of the cobblestone arches, watching him intently.
Harry couldn’t help but notice that the mistletoe was hovering, not between Draco and Justin, but Draco and
Harry was frozen in place as the water kept falling from the shower. The water had rinsed all the shampoo from his hair at this point; as water droplets ran down his face, Harry blinked, studying the cock sheath intently.
Perhaps the War had changed more people for the better than he realized.
“Clifford pissing you off again?”
It seemed the opposite as Harry let out a breath of air while he thumbed his leaking cockhead and threw his head back deeper into his pillow in frustration at how hard he was.
His glasses weren't cooperating either and smashed up against his face. But he figured there wasn’t much he could do about that and just ignored them, figuring he could live with the red marks that were probably going to be on his face from them pushing into his cheek.
“Erm - right. Sorry lads. But not going to happen. Excuse me.” Potter turned back to Draco, to his immense relief, and followed him through the crowd, closer to the back wall.
. Malfoy, please! I don’t care; I just need -”
So when Malfoy started showing up to Luna’s parties every time she had one, which was quite often, Harry was nonplussed at first.
“Yes! Oh god, yes - yes.” Harry kept up his babbling, and Draco groaned in reply, his hips thrusting forwards into him faster, chasing his own completion and knowing he wasn’t going to last.
"Don't be ridiculous, Harry, your house is not out to get you."
The song really was atrocious. He wasn’t sure who Cher was, but they could kiss his arse for all he cared.
“One thing you ought to know, Potter, is that Malfoys never apologize. So take this as a one-time thing only.”
Draco himself took his other hand and rubbed his restrained prick, knowing he was seconds away from coming in his trousers
“You don’t agree?” Draco cleared his throat to hide the dryness there. “Agree that our past could be a hindrance to our relationship?”
In fact, her current expression of unimpressed annoyance was quite a sight. Her arms were folded tightly around her front, but Harry could see that she was shaking slightly, trying to control her emotions.
“Now now, don’t be like that, darling. I have a special surprise for you tonight. Besides, you know the rules.”
Draco had to remember how to breathe at that and nodded against Harry’s sweat-sheened throat as he slowly pushed into him.
Think of the devil, and he shall appear.
come inside it, I want to see you do it now.”
, Harry thought with a frown as he stared at the ceiling of his room, the song still ringing in his ears. Maybe he shouldn’t want to figure out who is sending these damned songs to him anyway if they were going to keep sending him songs like that.
Not that the last bit sounded all that bad if Harry thought about it...
Gritting his teeth, Harry sucked in a breath and pulled out harder this time, but whimpered in pain when the underside of the tip of his cock got stuck, and the damned sex toy pulled him back in again wholly.
“Oh, yes. The Stones were always pushing boundaries. Jagger was and is, a true Slytherin, or would be if he were a wizard,” Malfoy replied, a smirk evident in his voice.
Theodore Nott seemed to be filling a similar role, except without Millicent’s brains, as he was staring off into the abyss and not paying a lick of attention to the proceedings.
And Harry had to make up his mind, fast, on whatever the hell it was that he was going to do.
A few seconds passed before Neville and Luna both decided to join in on the havoc on the dancefloor, Luna performing what looked to be some sort of ceremonial dance to bring about - something or another.
He replayed the song for the fourth time in a row.
Or perhaps the class prior to them had brewed an Amortentia, and the residue fumes were catching up to him.
After what seemed like ages and after all the snacks were consumed (mainly by Ron himself), Ron yawned heavily after getting his stomach full and waved idly to Harry as he trudged up the stairs to his room.
“I would like to know more. More things about erm - you. On multiple levels.”
Malfoy took that as a cue to keep going.
“Thank you for granting Harry with what I’m sure was excellent company- but it seems your time has run out.”
“I like it.” Malfoy’s eyes were lit up by the lanterns that hung outside, embellishing the quiet fire underneath that stare.
Not to mention Potter coming to speak at his trials, which was a whole other topic of conversation Draco hadn’t even brought up to Pansy, let alone Potter himself.
“It was only that ugly vase you got from Molly last year, and I repaired it immediately! Plus, Hugo got a big laugh out of it.” Harry gave his friend a small but hopeful smile, but she wasn’t falling for it.
His legs were bent at the knee and pulled outwards and to his sides, wrapped up thoroughly to ensure no movement.
Instead, he pocketed his device and joined his friends in their drinking schemes for the evening.
Harry knew she was trying to stay positive, but even her optimism was beginning to wilt under the onslaught of flying Christmas decor.
But then Harry had to go and open his mouth again.
His haughty voice turned softer on the last words, and if this hadn't been Malfoy, Harry would have sworn a light blush had crept upon his cheeks.
He never was much fond of her, to begin with, even after Hogwarts, which Harry found odd.
“Are you gonna come with my cock splitting you open?”
"Oh, no! Not the tree!" Harry raced up the stairs after Kreacher into the living room.
A sudden, painful wave of jealousy hit Draco particularly hard as images of others having their own go with Potter suddenly stampeded through his head. With those thoughts in mind, he swiped a hand up, magically cleaning off Potter of any extraneous fluids lingering around his mouth and the rest of his body, scouring him of anything
Malfoy was going to kill him.
eyes as he pulled his key out of his pocket, opening the door for Malfoy and shaking his head at the ridiculousness of this whole situation.
“Well, come on then. I don’t have all day,” Malfoy drawled. Harry heard the clicking of the aloe bottle; Malfoy must’ve added more to his hands.
Draco’s hand halted.
Harry rubbed his eyes because he can't be fully awake. But no matter how much he shakes himself, Malfoy still seemed much more jolly than Harry expected him to be after just finding out that the Gryffindor accidentally slept over in his wicker chair.
“Oh my... Well, I’m sure we can fix this…” Hermione’s voice cracked as she attempted to pick up the massive tree and immediately discarded that task to pick up some broken pieces of glass from the vases.
He wasn’t exactly sure what he was expecting to gaze upon at that moment, perhaps some old forgotten books in a dusty forgotten classroom, or maybe even some brooms he could hijack for Quidditch.
Malfoy was trying to get his wits about him, and Harry could have sworn he heard him mutter something along the lines of: “Bloody hell...Potter doesn’t know his magical strength....” before sleep overtook him.
Harry clenched his eyes shut, his knuckles white as he gripped his hands to the point of aching under the cloak. Worse still, he felt the familiar stirrings of arousal. He forcibly moved his attentions from Malfoy and turned his head a few inches to the right from the minuscule opening, leaning his forehead against the cold stone wall.
Malfoy heaved in a deep breath, his white teeth gleaming as he snarled at Harry. He looked like he was close to punching Harry in the face.
But he handed her the journal, which she took animatedly and read with interested vigor.
Harry took in each sigh and groan, holding on tighter as their positions eventually changed. Draco stared down at him with dark eyes full of longing and so much more swirling in those pale grey eyes.
Malfoy’s jaw ticked as he ignored him in favor of stirring, his gaze on the potion rather than Harry. Harry tried not to sulk into the cauldron for the remainder of the class as any attempts to talk to the other man went entirely out the window.
Potter then clenched around his cock, and Draco groaned as he leaned over his body, grazing Potter’s cock, which was still wrapped up tight, unable to come himself.
Slowly, he began moving his hips to and fro, allowing the magical fleshlight to do half the work as well.
The dazed look Potter gave him as he came down from one of the best orgasms he could remember having in a while if he was honest, was still imprinted in his mind, and he almost tripped over his last step up the stairs as his thoughts were still back in that classroom.
Harry didn’t especially feel in the Christmas spirit this go-’round. This whole season had been quite a damper, and he blamed his uninspired mood on his workload this time of year.
He had the sudden urge to
“Well,
At that, Harry pushed his elbows into the floor where they touched to prevent his upper body from moving from the force of Draco’s thrusts from behind him. But he stayed firm, and stock still on his end, watching intently at the time in the corner as it slowly ran down.
He always made the trips with him to the stores, just to hear for himself the catch in Harry’s breath and the darkening of his eyes each time they walked past the line of dildos.
At that, he popped the plug out of his mouth and watched as a line of spit followed from Harry's mouth and groaned at the sight.
He couldn’t understand why he allowed himself to get so riled up about stupid things like how many times Draco has looked his way versus Justin all night and why Justin felt the need to kiss Draco’s cheek at least once every half-hour.
“Bob” is smiling at Harry’s narration. Harry — heart in his mouth with his own daring — puts his hand over his. They’re far from the hospital, no one can see. Anyone coming down the path will be heard long before they arrive.
‘They’re coming,’ Harry swallowed.
‘It might surprise you to know this, but I
Nariyoshi suggests they move to the living room for their tea and biscuits, which they do. Harry takes the opportunity to glance around in rapt fascination at the place Malfoy calls home.
‘You were saying you wanted to be me. What did that involve?’
Harry stiffened as the edges of his vision darkened; a wave of fury pulsed through him. His knees hit the ground with a thud.
‘Is that why you tried to stop me? To prove yourself to your Master?’
Draco was a virgin. In real life. In his dreams and fantasies he was a sex machine. He hoped this was a dream. He wanted to make a good impression.
Before the week was out, Draco was invited to his first four-a-side game—by Dean this time. Potter seemed pleasantly surprised to see him on the pitch, and even more startled when Draco asked him for a Catch the Snitch game the next day. Draco wasn’t sure what the hell he was doing. Perhaps the sojourn in the Mirror changed him in fundamental ways. He wondered if he should be worried, and spent a long time staring at his face in the mirror, trying to find what might be different. In any case, the only way to avoid feelings of pity was to strike first.
!’ Draco snapped. ‘It’s all that I have left other than the clothes on my back. I have
After lunch, he met Granger in the library for a brutal study session. They both took Arithmancy. The way Granger responded to the numbers and figured out the connections between them was a kind of magic all of its own. Draco had never loved Arithmancy but, as one of the most prestigious subjects, Father had highlighted the need to achieve at least an E in the N.E.W.T.s.
They had no choice. They kept walking, keeping the sun to their right.
Harry followed his example and sat close. ‘My first question is: can the hounds find us here?’
He was rewarded with a deep blush. Draco’s gaze changed when he felt aroused, became soft and full of yearning. ‘Is that so, Potter?’ he asked, maneuvering Harry against an oak. ‘You planning to—’ he licked Harry’s neck and whispered in his ear ‘—
to win?’
Magic alone, of course, wouldn’t suffice. While the Slytherdom’s navy was a force to be reckoned with, they didn’t have the numbers to resist Riddle. They needed Gryffenland just as much as Gryffenland needed them.
‘You’re late, sleeping beauty.’ Esther sat by the kitchen window with a cup of tea. It was drizzling again and a gust of wind rattled the glass, but an Aga warmed the room and the smell of fried eggs, mushrooms, and tomatoes filled the air.
Malfoy returns to the bedroom as Harry’s pulling on his jumper. ‘How are you feeling?’ he asks.
‘You know what I‘m sorry about in this whole affair?’ Draco said, affecting nonchalance. ‘That I’ll die a fucking virgin.’
As the fatigue of the evening washed over Harry, he dropped his head against the wall and closed his eyes. He wondered if he should keep them open, if he should be alert with Malfoy around — c
‘Two teenage boys and you can’t seem to track either one of them down! The Malfoy boy especially! A spoiled, spoon-fed, coddled brat!’ He spat the words, each one a lash.
‘The fuck’s wrong with you?’ Draco erupted at lunch when Harry passed him the salt without a glance.
‘That he’s
‘Please,’ Potter gasps. ‘Please, I want to…’
So, the stirring inside him when he looked at Malfoy’s lips didn’t surprise him, and he didn’t make a big deal out of it. He knew that as soon as Malfoy woke up and wore his habitual disdain, Harry would go back to disliking him.
‘Let me see you. Open your eyes.’
‘On the table then,’ Draco says. ‘Like a good boy.’
A richly-dressed man sweeps into the building, silver hair glowing. Harry knows who he is. The family resemblance is uncanny.
He figured he wouldn’t bother Floo-ing in his whole body, Harry knew how his boss was, and if he had decided to completely and thoroughly Floo in to take a seat at the table, he wouldn’t be able to get away in time for supper that Draco was planning on cooking for them all.
And he twisted his head to see his snake of a boyfriend settled in on the bed, one arm behind his head as if he didn’t just fuck Harry’s brains out in the middle of an important work meeting.
“I can come too.”
Harry hadn’t been sure of what to think about it at first.
Harry only shook his head in disbelief, biting his bottom lip in amusement before airly replying, “Oh, right! Remind me again, who was the one sending songs behind a mask all year? Songs that, more or less, professed love to the other? The other being me in this scenario.”
Luna’s party rolled around like clockwork that year, and of course, Harry wasn’t prepared in the slightest for it on Christmas Eve. He found himself lying in bed, contemplating his life choices and wondering if he should even bother showing up.
The tragedy is his inability to come using Malfoy’s own sex toy, he thought rather hysterically.
It wouldn’t do much good. Harry figured McGonagall herself could catch him in the act of watching Malfoy jerk off, and he would still watch for as long as he could manage before being dragged away to detention.
“Potter! What in Merlin’s name are you–”
“I can see that.”
A loud yell came from further down the beach, closer to the water, and Harry started, quickly realizing it was two men screaming in laughter as one attempted to stand up on their wakeboard while the other helped.
After the Iain debacle, Malfoy seemed more inclined to shut his mouth and relax, which Harry was desperately thankful for, the only sounds for the next few hours were the few people around them in their own small talks and the faint sounds of the waves crashing at the beach.
He did have bigger things to think about, though. Number one on his list: finding out who was sending him these sodding songs.
At that, Malfoy threw his head back in a laugh, his glittering eyes watching Harry, amused. “Right. Whatever you say, Potter.” Malfoy took in a long, drawn-in breath, and Harry almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. “Oh, and apologies. For how you oh so eloquently stated for my mouth
If he ever got out of here, he was going to kill himself.
He felt his cock harden even further as he could hear the rain of the shower water and the way Malfoy let out soft “oh, ohs” each time his fist reached the tip of his cock.
The toy’s tip became wider, and Harry’s open mouth of realization of the toy’s capabilities was so stunning, Draco wanted to frame it for everyone to see.
It almost reminded him of…
Hermione pursed her lips. “I’m not so sure I believe it’s only anger that he’s feeling right now, but go on.”
He had tried many times.
invited him to the scene. That alone made Draco’s head spin as he shakily took a sip of his watered-down gin.
“What colour is my name? On the mark, I mean,” Harry smiled at the boy sitting next to him.
Harry and Ron were on their way to lunch, Ron definitely zoning out on Harry’s chatter about how he was writing a letter to Draco but wasn’t sure if he was being too descriptive about something when they passed Filch scrubbing away at the writing on the wall. He felt bad for the man as they passed by.
Elsewhere on the train, whispers had already reached a compartment carrying Draco Malfoy that Harry Potter was on the train. At first, he felt a wave of panic threaten to overwhelm him, but as Crabbe and Goyle began to conspire about how Harry potter was a liar who was pretending to have defeated the Dark Lord. Draco felt himself relax a little.
Later that day, Draco unwrapped Harry’s present from bed. There was a blossoming red bruise on his cheek and a cut on his forehead that had already been healed using a salve. His head still hurt though, and the veil of sadness that had enveloped the house on Christmas day was a familiar one.
“He’s probably faking it, Harry, you know how Malfoys are.” Harry felt a little uncomfortable at that statement.
Of course, reckless Harry knew this.
“Go to my chambers and be ready.” He drowned the rest of his drink and poured himself some more. “I will be there soon.”
“I don’t trust Lucius Malfoy. He’s a proper git, remember how he gave dad a black eye at Flourish and Blott’s the other day?” Hermione bit her lip and nodded, not knowing to agree or disagree.
“No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!”
everything in a school full of magic,” Ron said again, thinking about what Draco had said that morning. Harry nodded in agreement as they entered the Great Hall, gaze intently searching for Draco, who seemed to be in the middle of an animated conversation with Vincent Crabbe and Blaise Zabini. He felt a little jealous at the sight but sat next to Ron at the Gryffindor table.
The evening Harry and his friends had gone down to save the philosopher’s stone, Draco had felt an unmistakable pain on his forehead. He knew it had something to do with Harry’s scar and he knew it had something to do with the dark lord.
“You know what I mean.”
“Just like how you’re Slytherin but not like other Slytherins.” Harry piped back.
Burn this letter. Don’t tell Harry.
He did, however, notice on the train when Crabbe suggested they go terrorize the Gryffindors. Malfoy sauntered past every single cabin, hoping to see a familiar mop of black hair, but returned to his own compartment worried when he couldn’t find Harry. Could Harry be hiding?
“No need for all that, Dobby. Fetch me some water, will you? And where is Lady Malfoy this er-“ he glanced at the clock, “evening?”
“I know you probably missed me, but may I ask why?” Draco asked, snapping his book shut.
“They made fun of me, they did. I was not as smart nor as well read as you were when you first came here miss Granger.” Hermione looked surprised and Irma felt satisfied by that. “They called me nasty slurs, too, and I, like you, was devastated. All my life, my mother had nurtured me and raised me alone. She was a well-recognized lady in London society. She was well learned and kind.” Irma’s voice did not break, neither were her eyes wet.
“Say that again.” The Weasley said. Draco watched Harry get up as well and immediately knew the two of them wouldn’t stand a chance against Crabbe and Goyle.
“I’m here to see Harry.” Draco bit his lip and stared at the older woman hoping she wouldn’t ask any awkward questions. From the beginning of the school year, almost everyone knew Draco and Harry were sworn enemies, and ever since that one quidditch match they certainly played the part for real.
The boy’s door was locked with several padlocks, and what seemed to be a cat flap was attached at the bottom of the door. She had a bigger shock when she apparated inside. Narcissa knew that she had to expect something bad, from the way Draco had been the entire day, but the sight of Harry made her heart ache.
“Gryffindor doesn’t have a reserve seeker,” Hermione said, she looked worried too. Draco didn’t know what to do or what to say except hold Harry. He suddenly remembered that he had one last chocolate frog in his pocket. He gave it to Harry, smilingly declining when his soulmate bit the head off and offered him the rest of the frog.
After successfully winning the match, Harry found himself to be the last one left in the changing room. He heard the cheers and chants of excited Gryffindors from the quidditch pitch and yearned to be out there with him.
“Because you’re never here. It’s Christ-“
“Or he just genuinely wants the castle to be clean and expects us to follow the rules,” Draco said quietly. Ron’s ears went a little red.
“Potter. Granger. Weasley.” Snape drawled as they entered. He completely ignored Draco and allowed him to shuffle to his cauldron. “You’re late.” Snape looked, even more, greasier than usual.
I do not support JKR's disgusting transphobic views.
She didn't know if it’s a good thing or bad when the news reached her of the Dark Lord's demise and how Harry Potter lived.
This hug felt warm too, and secure. Draco felt angry he had missed years of his father’s love because of Voldemort, he felt angrier than he had ever felt before, even though he was glad of the way things were at that moment. Maybe that was why he didn’t notice Dobby standing by the wall as the Weasley’s ran in, and maybe that was why he didn’t look for Harry in the crowd as he got in the train and went looking for Blaise and Pansy instead.
“Why? What happened?” Draco didn’t respond. They were reaching the staircase that led up to the main floor.
“Um, Harry, I meant-“
TW: Mentions of physical abuse
“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.
“I wanted to know if you were okay.” Draco all but whispered.
“We all deserve respect and understanding from our soulmates, Mr Malfoy. You are no different.” Draco nodded, and Professor Snape finally stood up. He waved his wand again so that a bottle of pumpkin juice appeared on the bedside table.
“Apologize.”
“I wonder why they couldn’t get in. Harry loves coming to Hogwarts, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t skip on purpose?”
“I will tell you something about myself, miss Granger.” She did not wait for the girl to respond. “I was raised by my mother, who was as muggle as they come. She was a Professor, though.” That caught Hermione’s attention, which pleased Irma. “Yes, she was a professor at a very well esteemed muggle university, and our house was always overflowing with books.” Hermione Granger had now stopped crying and was listening with rapt attention. “My mother was also from a very well-educated muggle family that regarded knowledge above anything else.” She smiled when she thought of her mother and their old house in London.
He wanted to title it, to address it, but he didn’t want anyone to read the contents either. Was this a diary entry?
“We need to find a better spot to meet up in the winter.” Hermione sighed. They had hurried outside right after breakfast and knew that the bell for their morning classes would ring any moment. It was the last day of class before Winter break.
(See the end of the chapter for
He knew that Terence was confused by his trajectory and had stopped following him. While Terence was too busy trying to locate the snitch, Draco changed directions again, flying low, almost parallel to the unoccupied stands on the side as he followed the snitch.
“Are you sure Snape is trying to steal whatever Fluffy is hiding?” He followed up.
“As a prefect, I have to report you to the head of the house, Pansy,” Marcus said, looking grave.
“What do you mean, Padfoot?”
“Is Draco doing okay?” she glanced at Ron in surprise, “What you didn’t think I’d be jealous did you? He’s gay for Merlin’s sakes!” Hermione blushed a little and edged to the side so that Ron could sit down next to her.
“Mr Malfoy?”
“Are you sure that’s a real spell?’ said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard – I’ve learned all our set books off by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough – I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
“-that Hermione Granger,” Draco was saying,
Professor Snape was well on his way to writing down a recipe on the blackboard when the door creaked open and Draco and Blaise walked in. “Mr Malfoy. I hope you didn’t think that your stay at the infirmary has warranted your tardiness to go without consequence.” Harry’s eyes widened as he glanced at Ron and Hermione, who both looked just as surprised. Draco had gone slightly red.
“We should be friends with Harry again.” Hermione blurted out.
"Wow." He muttered, and Hedwig tittred in agreement.
Ron seemed a little annoyed too. Harry knew it was mostly because Hermione kept ignoring him, but he also knew it was because harry wouldn’t tell him where Harry kept disappearing to. He had known Ron for long enough to know that the boy was extremely loyal, and figured he deserved to know the truth. But Harry knew he had to ask Draco first.
, I don’t put you above doing that to me or Ron.” Harry looked up at Hermione, whose eyes were shining but she continued on.
(See the end of the chapter for
Slowly, his brain formed the connections. There still were gaps, and most of the information were things they had already discovered, but it helped to have some clarity.
“You’re definitely going to get that seeker position, Draco,” Blaise commented as they rushed their way to dinner, all a little filthy from spending all that time outdoors, but they didn’t really have the time to clean up properly.
“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring everyone’s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps —
“I know!” said Lockhart. “Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!”
A fire roared in the corner, and a few comfortable looking armchairs were scattered around. Draco had barely sat down for a few minutes when the door slid open. He stared at it for a few minutes, seeing the dimly lit hallway beyond, but nobody came in. The door shut on its own accord.
“Harry did you sneak into my bed!” Draco was wide awake now, but Harry Potter was hardly conscious. The boy was deep beneath two velvet blankets and a plush quilt Narcissa had sent for Draco, surrounded by a familiar smell, and finally next to his soul mate.
“It seems odd that Dumbledore expects him to
She picked up a slice of bacon leftover from breakfast and handed it to the animal before untying the letter, receiving a friendly bite to her finger in return.
“Hi Harry.” Draco looked as flushed as Harry did, and took Harry’s hand in his own to lead him away from the trophy room. Harry didn’t ask questions, only allowed himself to be lead away. He knew he would follow Draco anywhere. Harry was surprised when Draco lead him into the kitchens though.
They are fine. In Snape’s office. I’ll write again about what happened in the summer.
“Herbology, I think. What about you?”
“Like what?” Ron edged closer. “Do you reckon Draco’s gone bad?” He was so much warmer than her, Hermione noticed.
“Have you seen Harry at all today? Except for in class?” Ron shook his head, thankful Hermione hadn’t been asking why he wasn’t writing faster. He didn’t want to say anything that may anger her but spending all this time with Hermione was making him miss harry a good bit.
“Guess she likes the golden boy more than she likes you, Draco.” Draco didn’t realize he had been clutching his wand tightly until Blaise’s hand was on top of his own.
On any other day, Draco would have admired Harry’s cloak, but instead, he ran right into Harry and hugged him instead. He felt Harry’s surprise first but felt so much better when the other boy’s hands wound tightly around him and reciprocated the hug.
horrid. I’ve just been bottling everything from last year up and-“ Harry had to fight himself not to cry in front of Draco. “There’s no one to blame.” Harry sniffled. “My parents were killed and I live with the Dursleys who are-“Harry shook his head and wiped his tears. “I thought it would be easier to blame you. And I’m sorry. It was a terrible thing to do.” Harry reached for Draco’s hand, but Draco drew away.
“I’m going to stretch my legs a bit.” He said to no one and was out the door before anyone spoke.
“I didn’t know you liked Mrs. Norris, Ginny.” He said after she had tried to explain her sadness. “I’m sure they’ll catch the maniac who did this soon.” He added quietly, hoping to cheer her up but she seemed to become sadder still.
Apologies for this being a little late.
“Hands-on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. “Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing —”
“I’d work for a really long time! Hundreds of years!! That would mean I could save up tons of money, right?”
“I was studying in the common room when I noticed you leave,” Hermione explained. Harry internally groaned at not realizing Hermione would be there. “I supposed you were going for a walk but you never came back!” She looked very worried then. “I had to wake Ron and come looking for you.”
For most of his life, Harry Potter had been alone, ignored by his aunt and uncle and bullied by his cousin and his schoolmates. When Harry came to Hogwarts, he had thought everything was too good to be true, two amazing best friends, a soulmate who, Harry realized, was perfect, people who were just like him, people who accepted him and
“Don’t you want to be my soulmate anymore?”
“Harry!” Hermione’s face looked worried in the dark. “Where have you been!”
“Maybe master Draco can have dinner with his friends.” The elf’s big eyes shone. “His real friends.” Draco looked down at the elf and felt himself grow a little warm.
Harry wondered if this was Draco and secretly hoped not. “Speaking of pets, I tried to turn Scabbers yellow the other day, but it didn’t really work.” Ron rummaged through his trunk to pull out an equally battered-looking wand. “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway-“ the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy had brought a girl with him.
TW: Mention of physical abuse
TW: Mention of rape/dubious consent
“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for —” Lucius continued on, and Harry felt that this observation was unfair. He was pretty sure the only person who had better grades than Draco was-
Narcissa heard the death eaters cackling with glee that afternoon from her study. She stared in interest as Peter Pettigrew scurried off, only momentarily catching her eye. She barely paid any attention to any of the Marauders while she was at Hogwarts. At first, they had been too young, noisy Gryffindors she couldn't care any less about as she went about her days as a fifth year, and later they had become a family to Sirius, who was too careless in the Black family system and then she had been grateful for their existence, though she hadn't told anyone so. Later on, as hers and Lucius' ties in the dark side deepened, they were only seen as foes, annoyances to weed out. She knew that Peter Pettigrew had switched sides that night, and took Draco to the solarium to get away from the loud banter of the Death Eaters, knowing the Dark Lord would be killing tonight.
“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one.” She said in a bossy voice.
“Have you spent the day with him? What has he told you about Hogwarts so far? I bet lots of insider’s things!” The boy looked excited now, and Harry smiled with him.
Draco finally came to a page he spotted a keyword he was looking for, and began to scrawl away on his parchment, his thoughts about Harry, Hogwarts and even elves far away in his mind.
“I have some news, though,” Harry told Draco after he had slowed down his eating. He explained the Gringotts robbery to Draco, telling him about Harry’s visit that day with Hagrid as well.
Harry zoned out on their conversation, still angry, but more focused on Draco, who drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining objects for sale. After turning away from a long coil of hangman’s rope with a smirk still plastered on his face, Harry saw Draco notice the cabinet right in front of him. He thought Draco looked wonderful smirking, and his brain clouded even as Draco moved forward, his hand stretched out for the handle of Harry’s hiding place.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Draco. Draco Lucius Malfoy.” She felt her husband squeeze her hand tighter at the revelation. She had kept up the Black family tradition of naming her son after a constellation, this one she had spent countless nights watching with Lucius in one of the solariums in the Malfoy mansion.
“What’s the card?” He asked Harry gently as he watched Harry wipe a little bit of melted chocolate on his own robe. Harry looked at the famous wizard card and gasped, staring at the back of the card.
“Hermione?” Hermione looked up from a book she’d been reading under an alcove. They still had a good amount of time before having to head to DADA with Professor Lockhart and she wanted to be as thorough as possible in her revising.
Draco woke up the next morning and found himself in bed with his mother asleep on a chair next to his bed. The clock on the mantelpiece read a quarter to six, so he knew he had been out for a while.
“Defense Against the dark Arts. See you tomorrow?”
There was a sudden knock on their compartment door and a boy walked in, one Harry had noticed on the platform earlier. He was looking for his toad. Once the boy had established that his toad was not hiding under the growing mound of chocolate wrappers between the two of them, he left, immediately knocking on the next compartment.
Ginny didn’t know what she was doing. She didn’t know why Tom was being so persistent. Her head felt full and her limbs felt like logs as she stood in the girl’s lavatories on the second floor. She watched without really seeing as the sinks moved apart to open the chasm below. She watched without seeing with the diary clutched in her hands as something big slithered up.
“I jus-“ he tried to explain his thoughts a bit further when Hermione touched his shoulder.
“It was after a quidditch match. Harry basically said all Slytherins are bad.” Draco leaned against a desk inconspicuously. Hermione glanced at Harry, indicating that it was his turn to speak.
Draco had tried to compose the promised letter all week, but he simply didn’t know what to tell Harry. Well, he did have a lot to say but didn’t exactly know how to put them into words. He knew Dobby was around the castle somewhere and knew that the house-elf could be used to deliver the note if necessary, but he couldn’t quite gather up the courage to approach Harry.
Why has nobody noticed the fact that Harry’s broom was maimed during that quidditch match? He could have been hurt or worse, killed.
“I’m leaving.” Neither Pansy nor Blaise followed him as he hurried out of the great hall. It so happened that he crashed into his actual soulmate and his two friends on his way back to his dormitories.
As always, I love reading your comments! It absolutely makes my day!!
Harry knew at once that Pansy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Pansy to stop half the team from jumping on her, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you!”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, Parkinson!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at Pansy’s face.
‘I see that Diamond Lass needs a haircut,’ she joked, shaking her curls around her face.
‘I invited Feng Mian up for some tea,’ Nariyoshi needlessly adds.
‘You could say this painting is almost
Draco thought about it. He’d assumed that the Manor’s air of constipated elegance came from his grandmother, who’d made the major decorating decisions before he was born.
?’ Harry asked Ron.
Harry moaned at the touch, breaking their messy kiss to suck Salazar’s neck. ‘I’ve wanted you since I sat down.’ He buried his nose in the crook of the man’s neck and inhaled, while Salazar’s hand did delightful things to Harry’s cock. ‘Your scent… I’ve never met a commoner who smells like this.’
Draco shook his head.
‘Hey.’ Harry poked him, smiling. ‘That’s
Draco’s face rippled with emotion until it settled into a grim, cold mask. ‘Do I, really? You’re going away. And you still don’t trust me.’ The hurt was undeniable in his voice.
it. By all accounts, a night with you is phenomenal. And it’ll keep you fed. The debt will be cleared… You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain by doing this.’
‘Of course,’ Malfoy said. ‘I always carry a few galleons.’
Three faces stare at him. ‘Malfoy,’ Weasley starts, not precisely friendly. ‘You look—’ He glares at Draco and comes out with ‘…sexy.’ His cheeks swiftly turn as red as his hair and he clasps his mouth while everyone else bursts in laughter. ‘
just because he didn’t enjoy his roast.
He looked as if he’d been carrying the fear with him all day, unseen, swept under the carpet of their planning and shopping and travelling. He cast an anguished gaze at Harry, his hands fidgeting in his lap, his back rigid.
Harry envied her certainty. ‘We’ll need to get to Cadgwith as soon as possible. If you know anyone that could help…’
. Harry considered visiting Luna and asking her if someone had cast a spell on his husband, or if it was severe mental illness. With Harry’s luck, it’d be the second.
Then he heard it: Draco’s voice, coming from the forest.
‘You suffered a terrible ordeal,’ she started, pouring him a cup of tea.
power,’ Draco said. ‘The Dark Lord has cast my father in a… different light. He h—’ Harry’s heart bled at the expression on Draco’s face. He looked in pain as if his words wounded him on the way out; a confession in blood. ‘He humiliates Father in front of others,’ Draco continued, voice almost inaudible, ‘and
‘Nariyoshi might need me. I—I need to leave.’
Mora is the Muggle name for his kind.
‘The debt to be cleared.’
Malfoy’s smile is nothing less than predatory. ‘Can I have a go at persuading you then?’ His eyes bore on Harry’s, the insinuation unmistakable.
Draco rose to his feet, exchanging a glance with him. Harry would bet faeries didn’t hold conversations about laundry. He trod as silently as he could towards the noise, parting branches before his face, stepping over exposed roots, Draco on his side, his hand on his wand. They reached a clearing and crouched behind a thorn bush.
. If it uses up the blood…’
Harry bent his head, still trying to calm down. He moved at the front of Draco, crouching between his legs to cut the rest of his ties. ‘They’re coming.’
‘You’ll ruin everything.’ Harry left the changing room and started putting the clothes back.
‘Yes.’ It came out clipped.
Potter’s eyes widened almost comically. ‘Seriously?’ He stared at the Shack, presumably trying to figure out what Draco saw in it. ‘Did your father lend you the money?’
‘What about the blood spell? The Ichnilato?’
‘...I, er, don’t mind if—’
Malfoy glanced at him in alarm. His eyes fell on Harry’s open palm and the soft, swollen pink tissue where the dagger had nicked him.
She flashes a smile at Nariyoshi, who glows. Damn him and his flirting. ‘I was talking with Mr Miyagi here about his work and he mentioned an apprentice. Imagine our surprise when we realised we both know you!’
The light from the window behind the bed bathed Draco in muted grey tones, softening the angles of his face. His eyes didn’t meet Harry’s and he went back to staring at the bed cover. ‘Not one of my finer moments,’ he said, his voice hoarse.
The witch nods appreciatively at Malfoy’s nonsense, while Harry’s caught by surprise at his sudden appearance in the gallery. A thrill runs in his veins at the sight of Malfoy in the flesh after seeing him naked, lean and glistening in his dream the other night. He feels naughty just recalling those images while standing next to him.
‘Your wand’s ruined.’ Harry pocketed it, unwilling to part with it, no matter how broken, and brandished the dagger. The wind howled as it whipped the dark waves below them into fury and cut through Harry’s jumper, goosebumps erupting on his skin.
Clutching his handset tightly, his pulse racing, Harry spoke into it. ‘Hello, Anton.’
Panting, Harry raised the wand. He glimpsed the unforgiving chasm behind his back and took a step sideways, while in front of him, on his knees, Malfoy clutched his shoulder, blood oozing from his robes from where he’d been Splinched. Harry took a few more careful steps, walking around Malfoy, keeping the wand trained on him. The roar of the waves drowned out any coherent thought except for the pounding of his heart, but his hand remained steady.
‘Look how much you want my cock,’ Draco rasps.
Draco blinked, curious, but he obeyed. Harry kicked off his trackies that’d been stuck on one leg. Now they were both naked.
The boils disappeared, leaving behind a Draco burning with shame. Potter was always
Draco hasn’t realised he’s spoken until they stop and stare at him, shocked at the vitriol in his tone. He clears his throat, feeling Potter’s eyes on him. ‘I was merely suggesting, dear Longbottom, that it’s species-ist to attribute such negative characteristics to a Creature without proper knowledge of what they are actually like. Am I wrong, Granger?’
‘You asked Blaise out.’
Malfoy removes his obscene mouth from Harry’s cock and crawls over him, bringing his face close to Harry’s. ‘I’m going to fuck you, Harry,’ he says, his whisper like a midnight breeze. ‘I’m going to take so much pleasure from you you’ll be unable to get out of bed tomorrow.’
‘Sure you were. That why you were spying on us?’
Draco glances at the tea service — apparently Nariyoshi’d felt the need to take out the good china. ‘Let us not keep you,’ he says.
Draco’s hair is fanned on the pillow, his eyes cautious. Harry’s heart clenches with the desire to say everything he’s wanted to all this time. He wants everything out in the open, he wants to make Draco
The meeting with Hermione shook him. When they left the library for Charms, he stayed silent while she kept a stream of chatter about the Ministry duties she’d already assumed, spearheading a campaign about house-elf rights and attempting to bring a groundbreaking legislation to a vote in the Wizengamot. Draco couldn’t help admire the idealism and the sheer
Harry concentrates on the feeling of Bob stroking his face and his hair. How warm and soothing it feels, how solid and real, how far away from the Somme and France.
. He hasn’t even touched himself, but he’s leaking pre-come, his balls aching. He rubs himself, shutting his eyes as his orgasm crests.
Harry was just a reflection of my—’ He swallowed. Was Potter going to make him say it? He hated the feeling of being exposed, of Potter knowing that he was what Draco desired the most.
? Did you think I was waiting for
‘You want to come with me? It’s just a dispute,’ Harry said, stunned at Draco’s insistence.
‘Is it true? Did the Nazi,’ Draco pronounced the word carefully, ‘kill all those people and hold her prisoner?’
‘Probably not, so I will tell you.’ Draco smirked at Harry’s groan. ‘It’s similar to Aurors and Dark Wizards, you know?’
‘Oh, you can, sweetheart, can’t you?’ Draco murmurs, finding an easy rhythm. In and out, he watches his cock disappear in Potter’s arse. He’d fantasised about this when he was in school, but the reality exceeds even his wildest teen dreams — the dream sex he had with Potter not ten days ago pales in significance.
Feeling Salazar’s erection against his thigh brought Harry out of his post-coital bliss. He pushed Salazar against the wall. ‘Let me taste you.’
‘I… er,’ Harry tried to mumble something.
The door opened to reveal a young man, slender and pale, fair like a dream, holding a candle in his hand and wearing an expression of confusion when he saw Harry at his doorstep.
‘Um, can I walk with you?’ Potter said.
‘There’s a spell— ah, fuck it.’ Dolohov called the dogs to him and they Disapparated, leaving behind them a brief silence broken by the buzzing of the pixies. The creatures flew around the boys, pulled Malfoy’s nose and Harry’s hair, and disappeared towards the west with a shrill sound that echoed in Harry’s ears for a long moment.
But it wouldn’t do any good to start a fight. So he crouched and unlaced Malfoy’s shoes. He cradled each foot, making sure Malfoy held the wall for balance, and removed the shoe and the sock. It felt strange, touching Malfoy’s bare feet.
Malfoy glances at the bar and the other patrons, his voice distant. ‘I work with my hands. Long story.’ He turns and faces Harry, a too-bright smile on his face. ‘But tell me about you. Being an Unspeakable. It must be fascinating.’
He wouldn’t be a captive anymore. Not that he really was now, but Harry couldn’t help but worry that Draco wouldn’t need him when he was a Governor. Things might change. Things
‘It appears some Muggles are aware of what’s around them, even if they can’t explain it. I bet it’s Dawn. Dawn is Cornish. She knows.’
‘Come here.’
He slowly grins and opens the passenger’s door. ‘I’d love to come with you, Draco.’
Things were similar to the world he’d left behind. Almost: apparently, Voldemort existed, the coup happened and Harry vanquished him. However, he didn’t do it alone. Draco was mentioned as a war hero. In this— timeslip? Hallucination? Mirror world?—Draco and the four Gryffindors saved Britain from Voldemort, a feat which earned them some pretty awful nicknames: the Golden Boy, the Silver Hero, the Diamond Lass, the Ruby Warrior, and the Steel Heart; nicknames which reeked of Skeeter’s touch, who was named as the
After the initial awkwardness and silence, things didn’t seem as bad as Harry first assumed it would be.
“Hmm.”
at him, well, he wasn’t quite sure if he was hallucinating that or not. Or if he was going to be able to stand up from the table, period.
The hole itself couldn’t be larger than the tip of his thumb, but it provided a perfect view into the specific shower stall, small enough that he didn’t need to worry about getting caught.
Harry stared at the sand, grinding his teeth for a split second before back-tracking back towards the tiki hut. Malfoy was standing out like a sore thumb as he leaned oh so casually against the bar top in his way too short swimming trunks.
He immediately blushed from both the whine that came from the back of his throat and how much harder his cock got from the feeling of being held down magically. He had only done it to himself in the past, never allowing a lover or ex to do so to him.
mistletoe allowed, per his request.
As he searched in their colorful collection of toys, Draco’s lips upturned in a smirk when he saw his newest purchase hiding below their usual go-to’s. One that he hadn’t been able to share with Harry yet.
need us to help them in planning next year’s retreat? And so soon? This year has already been a migraine; the least they could do is give us a break, for Salazar’s sake.”
Potter’s head snapped up, and Draco felt his blood run cold. He almost wanted to double-check that the blindfold was working, with the way that Potter’s face was just...there. Staring him down, unnervingly.
Instead of standing up from his ball in the tight space he inhabited like he knew he should, Harry stayed put, a specific invisible string keeping him tied down on the ground for some reason.
Draco watched him, mesmerized until he felt his orgasm hit him like a freight train, holding onto Potter so he wouldn't fall over since his legs decided to turn to jelly.
“Besides, it’s kinda witty, innit? ‘Little Lion Man’? A Gryffindor nod, I suspect.” Ron bobbed his head with a satisfied grin as if he had just solved all of Harry’s problems with that simple statement and dived in for more pudding.
As they walked up a spiral staircase, Draco noticed how
He did manage to convince Ron to take the food back to the common room and eat there, and Ron didn’t care or pay too much mind to Harry’s rushing, as long as he got his snacks.
One of Draco’s eyebrows lifted, “Oh, you mean one of the cold cases that Robards specifically told us to wait until after the New Year to break into again?”
Harry leaned forward, inhaling Draco at the base, mouthing around it and wanting nothing more than to stay there forever, with Draco’s hand in his hair and his oh so perfect murmurs of approval he was whispering down to him.
But Malfoy’s eyes lit up, before immediately dimming when Harry shook his head towards him.
Draco watched unblinkingly, infinitely pleased. His cock twitched again as he watched Potter ultimately come undone by his hands.
“Potter!? Are you alright!?”
“You have to fuck it.”
Knowing Draco, though, Harry imagined he had been on edge for a while now. The idea of fucking him through the Floo as he attended a work meeting was something that would get his filthy mind going haywire.
Damn Potter, always making him so sentimental.
He spread his thighs as much as his trousers allowed him as the first wave of orgasm hit him in a surprise. Harry let out a low groan as spunk pulsed over his fingers, spurting up and hitting the wall.
It just drove him up the wall in madness how nonchalant Draco acted about it all.
Harry reluctantly did so as well, choosing the name ‘Prongs,’ since it was easy enough for him to remember, and he figured other students wouldn’t realize it was him to the point of being bombarded with ridiculous messages, and Merlin knew what else twenty-four-seven on his device.
Harry could feel Draco’s eyes on him as he carefully observed him, sipping his wine all the while.
Draco bristled at that, “Speak for yourself.”
Harry snorted at that but decided to indulge Ron, agreeing to the night out.
Harry bit back a whimper.
Now, the tip of the tree was touching Harry's shoes. In its fall it had taken with it everything that stood in its path: the knickknacks on the mantelpiece, chairs and side-tables, a whole row of Chinese vases. And –
Draco understood that sentiment completely.
“You shouldn’t have to be just for someone else’s
, I’m sure this was all one big misunderstanding on your part. I’ll just be off then.”
But this was a whole new level, and Draco was drunk with the power of finally having Potter here, against him, kissing the living hell out of him.
He must be good in the sack, Harry assumed with a grimace, as he refilled his glass of firewhiskey as George rambled on about something or another to him after they cut into the birthday cake later that evening.
“Oh, Harry, we are going to have so much fun together. You have so much to learn!”
Harry asked why not just use magic to amplify the music, but Seamus shook his head resolutely. He didn’t ask any more questions.
when I did some bad things as well and -”
Before Harry could respond with a meager sigh, he was gone with his eager girlfriend, and Harry was left there to sit, alone, until Draco showed up after his tea with his mother.
His brain needs to hit up the gym, clearly.
But Potter only groaned incoherently again at him, and Draco furrowed his brows.
At that, Potter’s face grew ten shades darker, his mouth gaping open like a fish, and Draco had to hide his swell of approval at his own ability to turn Potter inside out.
Harry recklessly kept singing off-pitch as he heard whispers in the crowd. He didn’t care in the slightest. His eyes were glued to Malfoy, who was looking more and more likely to cut his throat as the song went on.
An earthy, sandalwood smell hit him with a bluntness that blindsided him.
Slowly, he turned back around to face the fleshlight and swallowed, feeling sweaty even under the shower water. He then looked out of the shower door, wiping the steam off and peering out to make sure no one was there, watching.
And it especially didn’t mean that Harry wanted him around on his supposed to be solo-vacation.
Draco gasped, shocked at the display, but managed to answer the soft kiss back with one of his own, one he had wished he had given Potter that night two months ago when he had him laid out under him.
Potter nodded, and Draco pushed him face-first against the brick wall, nibbling down his bare throat, undoing his bow-tie. “I’m going to fuck you so hard that your bastard of an ex-boyfriend will be able to feel it.”
But deep down, Harry knew this wasn’t some random young girl with a silly crush. These lyrics were too thoughtful for that.
He figured with all the times he’s saved his life over the past seven years, Harry could forgive him for any interesting kinks the man may have, and he bit back another snort at the simple fact of Malfoy having something so trivial hanging up where anyone could see.
It seemed to drag on slightly, and Harry cast a
Harry grasped at the coverlet under him, mulling over if he should say he was alright and there was absolutely no need for Malfoy to help him further. Or if he should flip over and let Malfoy at him from the front.
Harry only sighed into his tea, which had gone cold during Hermione’s reprimanding.
But there was a strange glimmer in Malfoy’s eyes as his face transformed from its original pleasure induced one to a more steadfast and focused one, his grey eyes steely for a half-second before closing them and moving abruptly to turn the water off once he cleaned his own spunk off.
Harry downed his drink.
It wasn’t as if Harry didn’t already have enough to worry about this year.
Potter managed to speak between kisses and began his descent down Draco’s pale neck.
Even if Draco was in the middle of writing up important paper-work for Robards, it didn’t stop the brunet from attacking with his diabolical face kisses.
All Draco knew as he stared down at Harry’s prone, steadily breathing figure beside him, was that he was very keen to continue this little arrangement Harry and himself found themselves in —
This time he had to hold himself back from jumping back again for a slightly different reason.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t think that’s how it goes, but go on.”
Whatever this is.
If last year’s Christmas gift didn’t clue him into Harry’s feelings towards him, he wasn’t sure what would do it. Perhaps a lap dance and a nice make-out sesh would do the trick?
“I - I love you, Draco. And I guess I wanted to hash out our past before I said that. But - I don’t know why? I guess I thought it would be good to squash old silly things like that, but now, looking at you tonight, that’s really all I wanted to say.”
Once this whole debacle was over, Harry wasn’t ever going to step foot in another karaoke bar. Well at least for another month.
wasn’t the correct term…
Without another thought, Harry slid from Draco’s lap to the floor suggestively, his eyes on a particular blushed Draco the whole time.
He could feel Malfoy’s lingering gaze on him after he reluctantly looked away.
Ron laughed at that, and Harry felt a little better.
during your stay. Anything at all,
But he could admit a tentative friendship might be in their future.
Either that or risk hearing them go at it, which was not on his list of to-dos for his last year at Hogwarts, thank you very much.
Harry nodded in agreement, knowing he would soon have his lover trading out those complaints for more lovely sounds.
Bright brown eyes blinked up at Harry as the man in question nodded with a broad grin, his whole face brightening up at the sight of Harry. Harry immediately reached a hand out for the man to shake, only for it to be ignored entirely, and Harry felt unfamiliar arms wrap around his torso instead.
He folded the paper up and stashed it inside his robes.
“Oh! That would be the nargles. I knew they would show up,” Luna replied with a dreamy expression on her face that didn’t quite equal the feeling of confusion in the air as everyone in the room stared at her with looks of bewilderment and frustration alike.
Malfoy stared at him, clearly suppressing a laugh if his bitten lips were anything to go by.
Draco quirked one eyebrow, his eyes still trained on Harry. “Levels?” he breathed out, one hand coming up to trace Harry's collarbone, causing goosebumps to erupt in his wake.
But all of a sudden, Potter muttered something low in the back of his throat, and Draco found himself leaning backward, away from him, and back in his seat. He found himself getting hot and wondered if Slughorn ended his cool air spell.
Harry was met with the sight of one enraged Pansy Parkinson right below him, arms crossed, her manicured nails tapping incessantly at his elbow.
“I didn’t know you could sing.”
At that admission, Draco’s face lit up in pink splotches, and Harry didn’t know if he wanted to pummel the man or snog the lights out of him.
Draco’s eye crinkled as he attempted to hold back a smile of adoration. He was always jealous of Harry’s ability to brave anything he set his mind to, including uncomfortable conversations, it seemed.
“I didn’t realize how kinky you were, Malfoy. Good to know, though, never know when that particular skill-set will prove useful out in the field.”
Harry kept pushing his luck, his hand with his mic shaking as he stared Malfoy down, unable to face anyone else right now.
Harry closed his mouth, which had been hanging open in lieu of not knowing what to say.
Harry watched as Malfoy then ran a hand down his chest, rubbing at his nipples and biting back a louder groan at that. Harry almost wished he hadn’t, wanting to hear it all.
So he chose the latter.
"Yes, Kreacher. I get the idea. I'll stop," Harry felt his cheeks burning and he was getting very uncomfortable about the amount of information Kreacher was divulging. Malfoy seemed to find it amusing, judging by the smirk on his face as he looked Harry up and down.
That included sucking Draco off, to Draco’s utter delight, of course.
“You don’t have to worry about Roddy anyway. He’s a top. Not my type,
Malfoy’s thin pursed lips turned up slightly in a diabolical smirk. “Oh, doesn't he?”
“No need to worry about him. Or even serve him, for that matter, Roddy. He is completely sober.”
Justin nodded after a few more seconds and leaned in to kiss Draco goodbye before turning around and leaving, no words said to Harry in the process.
Ignoring the jibe, Harry muttered a balming spell on his elbow before taking the spot to Malfoy’s left, staring down into the violet-colored potion. “Looks about right. How do you already have it almost done?”
He could watch Malfoy floating in the water all day and all night, his pale skin ethereal as it blended beautifully with the light blues of the pool water. And when he opened his eyes to look up at him lazily, Harry was entranced by their stark greyish hue, the water almost bringing out the color to the nth degree.
“Slytherins are a loyal bunch and wouldn’t say anything the other wouldn’t want out. They were annoyingly close-mouthed about certain...things.”
Harry didn’t buy it for one second. But he appeased the man and jumped into the pool, making sure to soak the blond man thoroughly with a rather large cannonball.
After the mission, Malfoy offered for Harry to come over to his flat to take notes from the raid before work the next day. Knowing how incredibly meticulous Kingsley had been lately regarding paperwork getting turned in on time, he figured it wouldn’t hurt to put some extra time on it and agreed to take Malfoy up on the offer.
Harry felt the fleshlight retract from him, and he was able to pull the rest of the way out with a satisfied sigh.
“It’s very nice to finally meet you, Harry! Draco’s told me so much already!”
As he slipped through the same hole, Harry tried not to think too hard about the fact that he was willingly escaping past curfew again, to see Malfoy
He spent most of his time planning the mission ‘GTFB’ or ‘Get the Ferret Back’ as Seamus lovingly called it.
Harry licked his swollen lips, tasting a bit of come that landed on his bottom lip, and moaned in appreciation, smiling in the realization that his jaw was rather sore, but in the best possible way.
Parkinson managed to look somewhat sheepish. “Well, Draco doesn’t like it when we get involved in his personal life. And acts like a petulant child whenever we do. There’s nothing to be done about it.”
“Fuck, oh -
-- Draco thought, maddeningly struck with the knowledge that he was going to tip over the edge soon. Potter’s illegal voice suddenly sounded deeper and gravelly, almost as if Potter was intentionally doing this to him, the sounds coming from the back of his throat.
He truly appreciated McGonagall, but sometimes she really ground on his nerves. And with the way Ron was going on that morning at breakfast, his sentiments mirrored Harry’s own.
“I haven’t been able to take my eyes off you all night. Those bloody robes of yours -” Harry licked his lips, and Draco clenched his fists, his cock hardening in his trousers, and a sick part of him hoped Potter could see it.
He grabbed his wand from the table and vanished the cock holder from Potter’s weeping erection, and the man in question sobbed aloud in apparent relief. Draco then reached out and grabbed his cock, tugging twice; when Potter erupted, the entire length of his body froze in sensations as he finally came.
Seamus, Ron, Dean, and of course Harry himself, were working on an all-out plan that the Slytherins had concocted for him that consisted of Cher, fancy lights, and of course...more karaoke.
He watched as Harry’s back arched, and he was coming suddenly, all over himself, and Draco let out his own groan as his orgasm ripped through him.
A sharp nudge to his side had him shaking out of his reverie.
Muttering a
A few seconds passed, Harry sipping lightly at the drink, noting with fondness that Malfoy must have charmed the glass into something else when he wasn’t looking because he now tasted his familiar go to firewhiskey.
Looking down at his drink, Harry wasn’t sure if he was fearful for the night to come or looking forward to the atrocities of what could only be drunk Hogwarts students singing off-key as if their lives depended on it.
He stepped under the water once more, leaning over, one hand grabbing at the stone wall in front of him, his arse sticking out like it was made to do so.
Harry was currently going through all the possible ways Malfoy could have tracked him here in his mind. Perhaps Malfoy had been stalking him since that last New Year’s party at Luna’s; he had seemed pretty inebriated…
Maybe they were right after all.
But what was awaiting him certainly wasn’t anything near what he would have even guessed if anyone had asked him seconds prior.
He could hear Potter swallow from where he stood, his eyes still trained on his crotch, and Draco felt the same heat sweep through him as before from earlier, practically swaying where he stood.
“Alright, I think it’s done. Would you like to test it to make sure? I’ve smelled Amortentia so many times, it's harder for me to tell if it’s perfect.” Malfoy asked,  as he stirred the potion.  Harry grimaced.
Harry was sure he wasn’t the
It was almost entirely dark, minus a small lantern that looked virtually out on the other side of the bathrooms.
Blaise rolled his eyes.
“If I had known a simple thank you would have me in this position; I would have done so months ago.” Draco nipped at his bottom lip, earning a deep groan in his back of Potter’s throat.
Draco adored the differences between them, his pale skin versus Harry’s darker color. Yet, he was still able to mark Harry up for days onward, and he could even see the reddened blush scattered on his skin from the teasing Draco loved to give him.
"You must have visited when Cygnus Black was still alive?" said Hermione.
incident that Draco would never have thought would ever be even close to a possibility for him utterly changed him, and these past few months have been torture for him in almost every aspect of his life.
Harry hummed into the soft pillow under him, and Draco got to work then, grabbing the lube from the bedside table and prepping him the usual way, attentive to his every move, every sound, every whimper Harry gave.
He wanted to watch him as he fucked him.
If not an exercise in self-restraint. Especially on the days when Malfoy would wear his low hanging joggers that framed his arse so deliciously.
“So, Amortentia. Easy enough.” Malfoy organized all the notes in front of him on the bed into one stack. “We will need to find the ingredients, which shouldn’t be too much of a bother.”
Draco’s eyes rolled so far up into his skull; Harry was worried about them not being able to find their way back to Earth until the gray found his green, looking more amused than anything else.
But Harry didn’t particularly pay much mind to his hair products, his eye too transfixed on his pale arse, as Malfoy leaned over to grab whatever other soap he needed at that moment from the ground, causing it to stick out from under the water, begging to be stared at.
But Harry wasn’t sure what more he could
The music started intensely, but Malfoy seemed to know all the words by heart as he sang out into the microphone strong and sure, not missing a single beat. Harry was pretty sure his jaw had dropped down to the table, but there was no way he was moving an inch.
Harry scooted as close as he could to the wall, his knees on the cold ground, and one hand supporting his weight as he peered through into the men’s lavatory at a better angle.
At the same time, the other Houses merely stared; even Ron gave up and slid in next to Harry on the loveseat to watch his dance partner win the competition easily without his help.
Harry cleared his throat, remembering his breathing exercises and not giving him the satisfaction. A few moments later, Malfoy looked away, moving to face the sun as he stretched out again beside Harry by the pool.
Muggle songs that probably ever existed on the face of the planet.
He wasn't even certain where it was she had booked; he didn't bother checking.
Pansy’s stern expression softened minutely.
The more he thought about Malfoy being Typhon, the more irritated and amused he became. He became much more upset with himself for not figuring it out until he had him right in front of his face singing practically to him.
read. I just saw that list as more of...guidelines than anything else.” Draco had to bite back his smirk as the man's eyes twitched, clearly fuming before him.
He could still smell the stink of old cheese even after scrubbing his cheek down with a napkin.
“Here,” Malfoy shoved a bottle of clear looking liquid into Harry’s hands. “This is for your awful skin. It’s a Muggle remedy. Rodrick showed it to me once.”
It was one thing to watch Malfoy rub one out without him knowing; it was quite another to get off to him getting off ten feet away.
Potter’s chest vibrated in amusement, but leaned forward and opened his mouth against Draco’s ear.
Harry was able to get a hold of himself right as Draco added another finger. “N-no Hermione, I’m alright. Just a bit hot in here is all. A-anyone else hot?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry assumed this was just part of the toy’s magic in some way. He wasn’t sure what or how yet, but he figured it was alright.
Draco tried to forget about how peaceful it was before Harry piped up, the music playing inside, the warmth of the fire at his feet as he held onto his spiked cocoa.
He continued his ministrations, bringing his hand up and down Potter’s shaft, gathering speed as he jerked him off similarly to how he would bring himself off, with a slight twist at the tip, which he seemed to enjoy just as much, even more than Draco himself.
What in the sodding hell. Draco truly wasn’t sure if he was actually getting off on Potter’s made-up language or if he was ultimately and utterly losing it as well.
The green-eyed git looked up at him, pink-cheeked, wide-eyed and confused, his hair in even more of disarray than usual. “Huh?”
Draco saw red.
Harry's throat clicked as he swallowed heavily.
Another week went by, and Harry finally did manage to crack open the hellish history book Hermione had been forcing down his throat, reading through a chunk of it before falling asleep in Malfoy’s chair during one of their meet-ups for the potions assignment.
body.
Harry muttered an incantation and suddenly another familiar song started in from the DJ.
Of course, his mind quickly replaced the knife he was using to chop up beetles with something else entirely in those delicate hands.
And as soon as he was complete with his last sordid adventure that night, he would hang up the cloak for the remainder of the year, and that was that.
‘Mrs Li?’ Fear and rage sink their claws in him, and he suppresses the instinct to snarl at her. ‘What are you doing here?’
For the first time, Harry doesn’t believe him. Something in his tone, in his immediate reply, rings false.
Harry doesn’t date much. After his divorce from Ginny, he went out with Anthony, but the relationship fizzled fast. It’s been a while since someone has blown him – and Malfoy’s doing it so exquisitely, his fingers fucking him so sweetly, that Harry’s toes are curling with unbearable delight.
won’t. The attic room is yours for as long as you want it.’
, the painting that gave its name to the exhibition. He spots Ron’s red hair next to Seamus, who has an arm around his girlfriend and seems to be in the middle of one of his tales. ‘Where did you learn to talk about art? Can’t remember us being taught anything like that at school.’
,’ Draco spat the name, ‘is for you to leave me alone. You’ll have my gratitude then.’
They speak in whispers. Hands seek hands, and suddenly Harry can’t bear it any longer. He draws Bob — Draco — to him, pressing his body against the warm, solid body of the elusive man. ‘I wish… I wish for so many things.’ He turns his head to brush Draco’s lips. ‘I wish for a kiss most of all.’ His heart is galloping, his breath coming short, praying he hasn’t been too daring.
Six days later Madam Pomfrey pronounced him fit as a fiddle. His parents returned to the Manor and Draco took himself to the lake. Staying in the castle was unbearable. Back at the Eighth Year table, Teresa went by Terry, Pansy cast furtive, longing looks at Blaise, Smith wasn’t anyone’s pet or half-naked in leather (which was a
‘Just because she’s Jewish?’
‘In a minute,’ Draco said. ‘I — I need a minute.’
During the wedding reception, all Harry could think of was Salazar, who had been vastly more exciting to be around than Harry’s husband. Sure, Draco didn’t turn out to be the sallow, skinny man Harry’d expected; in fact, he was quite handsome, tall and nicely-shaped, with hair so bright it looked silver. But he was also icy cold, entitled, and seemed to hate Harry.
‘Didn’t you know that?’ Suspicion gathered in Pauline’s eyes and Harry froze, his mind frantically searching for a way to cover the faux-pas.
Dawn saw them off. She pointed at a new direction through the woods. ‘Got any iron with you? Good. Now, go straight through here and in a mile or two you’ll see a road. There’ll be a sign for St Cleer. It’s the nearest village. By the time you get there, the first trains will be running. You’ll need to change in Falmouth and take a bus to Cadgwith. Got all that?’
They shared a few moments of stunned silence as they both digested the news.
Harry hadn’t consciously thought of his suggestion to Draco until he made it. Back in Camelford he’d assumed he’d reach Tinworth and shake off Draco, but now things had changed. They were getting to know each other and tolerate each other; they worked together and ate together and slept next to each other (
’ve taken to visiting him as well?’ Hermione asked before Harry had a chance to enter his office and shut the door behind him.
‘The Dark Lord is pretty spot on,’ Draco says. ‘And the greedy humans.’
married to my cousin. They have an
‘Can you stop talking about his cock, and besides I haven’t… I mean, you don’t even know—’
‘You could have said that in a letter.’
‘He’s only trying to help,’ a voice said behind him. ‘Finite Incantatem.’
The fire warmed Harry’s back, and his pulse had finally settled in a sweet, fluttering beat, like a bird trying out its wings. The others would be arriving any minute now, and they had to separate, look professional, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to let go of Draco, not after the yawning abyss of terror he’d felt when the Patronus had brought the news of his abduction. He traced Draco’s neck. ‘What did you want to ask me before? Before I—?’ Had Draco read his emotions on his face?
‘We should be getting along,’ she said, and Harry started as if from sleep and grabbed Draco’s forearm. He didn’t speak as they climbed the stairs again.
The old misconception rankles Harry. ‘I never wanted the limelight, and if you’re suggesting—’
After breakfast, while Harry was washing the dishes and Draco was drying them, Esther put down her third cup of tea. ‘Have you decided what you’re going to do?’ she asked Harry.
‘Well, they were following my scent, but I was wearing a bunch of clothes from different people. Even if the clothes had been washed, some scent of the human remained; also maybe people handled them at the shop. All the different human scents confuse the hounds.’ Draco threw a pebble in the gurgling stream. ‘If I’d been wearing my robes, they’d have managed to find me more easily, I believe. Those second hand clothes saved us.’
The dark, narrow alley in which they stood twisted out of view. Harry motioned to Draco to leave one handset on the steps and follow. They crept down the street, glancing behind them until they turned the corner.
Draco knocked his leg in irritation. ‘I was annoyed. And you kept on annoying me.’ Under the fall of his hair — it really was getting long, brushing his cheekbones— his eyes gazed at Harry, earnest. ‘It’s not an excuse but— I was quite spoiled as a child.’
‘Let me return the favour.’ Draco kneels in front of Harry, who leans his head back on the window and loses himself in that warm mouth.
The loud ruckus in the background took on a more deafening crescendo as some drunk man wobbled up to the mic, breaking him from his reverie.
But no, the sounds were starting up again, and Draco leaned a tad bit further in his seat to hear clearer.
Harry still watched him with an air of distrust. “Oh? What is so special about this place? Did you somehow figure out I was staying here so you could watch me from afar?”
There was clearly magic involved, Harry deduced, as the feeling intensified when he moved his hips faster and pushed in at a certain angle.
“Harry…” Hermione proceeded cautiously, her eyes knowing, and her brows raised in anticipation of whatever he would do next.
He opened his mouth to respond when a particularly hard thrust had him seeing stars. “
He nodded to him to continue what he was saying.
He then pictured Malfoy and what he would in this position, and a tantalizingly filthy image of Malfoy taking a shower next after Harry was through and having a turn with his toy had Harry growing harder inside the toy.
After last year’s crazy events and almost - well actually
Before Harry could even blink in surprise, Malfoy turned around on his heels, his glittering grey eyes locked onto the very spot of the peephole again, and Harry felt a sudden cold chill in his bones as the cunning bastard smirked grandly-
Malfoy gestured to one of the colorful slim covers that lay beside the stack of others; this one, in particular, was darker in color, and Harry swallowed back his tongue as he grabbed it to take a closer look at the picture on the front.
Draco then grabbed his cock and started again, jerking him off efficiently and quickly, and Harry’s head was thrown back at that, mouth agape with a jumble of words escaping every few seconds.
But the right kind -- the type of tired where all he wanted to do was go down to the beach and lay around like a useless slag.
He grinned as he resurfaced and heard Malfoy’s loud cursing, quickly covering his mouth with a hand, smiling apologetically at Iain, who for the first time in Harry’s stay there looked at Harry with an expression other than wanting to rip his clothes off.
“So care to share with the class your research findings, Granger? On why I can’t kiss my boyfriend under the bloody mistletoe?!” Draco’s voice cracked a bit, and Hermione’s face turned a deeper red as she cleared her throat.
The Slytherin got a light smack on his thigh for that. Still, he only laughed as his boyfriend rolled his eyes good-naturedly.  Harry dipped down, running his tongue thoroughly over each line atop the other man’s pale form below him.
That seemed to be the final straw, and Harry heard rather than saw the door open to the bathroom. He was utterly too embarrassed to look at the man, who’s clicking footsteps had halted within a few seconds of entering.
What Harry found the most maddening was the fact that most students had paired a nickname to their device, unwilling to put out their real name. McGonagall had mentioned on the first day of classes that anonymity might be a good thing anyway in the beginning as they tested out the new technology.
Use protection (condoms, etc.)
Hermione shot him such a strong look in response that he stood up from the Great Hall table and scurry off to his room to grab the sodding book after all.
Once the words finally caught up to him, Draco grinned lightly down at the crumpled paper, and embarrassment subsided for the time being.
“Yeah! Erm - does next Monday work?”
"The Chosen One himself," Draco said, raising an eyebrow in his direction. "I was just about to swallow my first Firewhisky of the festive season when I was rudely called away from Zabini’s Christmas party. Still, it shouldn't be too difficult to put pay to this little problem. Potter, could you give me a rundown of the phenomenon you've witnessed?"
Draco relaxed under the touch, allowing the kiss to linger for a few more moments before Harry pulled back minutely. “I mean, I want you. Every part of you all the time.”
Harry caught the smirk that erupted on Malfoy’s face at Seamus’ words and had an urge to look away but found he couldn’t.
Harry glowed at the praise; his mouth was slightly open, ready for whatever Draco was going to give him.
Potter stared over at the other man for a few more seconds in an attempt to gain the higher ground but then visibly collapsed in defeat.
Not tonight.
Draco’s hand tightened in his hair as well, as he gently brought him back further to his aching cock for more.
Harry managed to grimace on behalf of Ron, understanding his frustration. It was as if all the professors felt the need this year to make sure the students were having a ‘normal’ year since the last few weren’t quite what Harry would describe as
Harry’s hands grabbed the wall in front of him, his fingers scratching against the stone in a desperate attempt of balance as the fleshlight’s suction was immediate on his prick.
; his reading glasses perched on his nose in a way that made Harry want to strip the man of everything but those damn glasses.
He opened his mouth to reply that he was perfectly fine and was in no imminent danger (except for perhaps his cock coming entirely off the rest of his body thanks to Malfoy’s magical dick sheath). But at that exact moment, the sex toy tightened around the tip of his cock, and Harry cried out in pain/pleasure.
Draco thought, his gaze set on the dribble of saliva trickling slowly out of Potter’s mouth.
“Yes, I gathered. Since the title says as much.”
Draco rubbed hands up and down his thighs, and Harry cleared his throat loudly in an attempt to stop the proceedings behind him. Ron only glanced his way once before finishing up the bit of his notes.
He stared at Potter’s bright eyes roaming all over Draco, not able to stay in one spot for longer than a millisecond.
A few hours into the party found Harry standing awfully close to the drinks, eyeing the attendees of the party as he drank glass after glass of some concoction that Charlie brought with him, swearing that there was some sort of Dragon substance that made it glitter.
As soon as his body disappeared around the staircases, Harry quickly pulled the cloak over his head. He then spelled a silence spell onto his shoes to prevent any more Filch incidents like last night; before briskly making a turn out of the common room entrance and straight to where the alcove was.
“But what if they’re a man?” Harry asked the last time Seamus had mentioned it during one game night in the common rooms.
Draco stared down at his boyfriend as he did so, adoration painted over his features.
Harry could relate. This was getting ridiculous.
“It reads the room. The mistletoe, with the help of the nargles, of course,” Luna chimed in again with a broad smile. “So once you two kiss, it should leave you alone since its job would be completed.”
“Looking good, Mr. Potter! The sun is doing you wonders.” Iain gave him one of his famous winks as he strolled by the two men by the pool.
“Shhh,” Malfoy then gently raised his other hand that held the plug and pressed the metal tip against his lips, "I know what you need."
But he had Malfoy to attend to for the present time. He sighed and made his way up to his room, the blond following him.
Draco pushed his hair back. ‘I’d like to apologise. For that day, when you tried to help me get up. I felt ashamed by what had happened, and I lashed at you, and I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have.’
Harry nodded. ‘He asked you to Crucio Rowle.’
It was early evening by the time a rickety bus deposited them in the — ‘disgustingly pretty’ according to Draco — seaside village of Cadgwith and they trampled up the hills in the direction (they hoped) of the magical settlement, based entirely on an early memory of Draco’s, who’d visited the area as a child. The more they distanced themselves from the Muggles, the less they spoke, the enormity of what they were about to do weighing heavily in their minds. They had to let Dolohov know they were both in Tinworth — and to escape him. The cool sea breeze bit into Harry as they trudged on, slicing through his sweater, chilling his insides.
It couldn’t be. Harry’s brain refused to accept it, denying the truth of his eyes even as the news showed smiling pictures of the two ladies he and Draco had bought clothes from in Camelford.
‘No, you haven’t,’ Draco smiled. Coming closer, he wiped Harry’s forehead and the drops of blood there. ‘Yours?’
He snorts. Potter trusting Draco — what a joke. Sue isn’t laughing, though; she’s looking at him intently. She’s been trying very hard to convince him, and Draco’s suddenly sure that he’s not the first person they approached. They must have had people try to sneak into the Ministry and steal the figurine, or even thrown other, more likely candidates for Potter’s affections into his path. They must be desperate. The realisation makes him breathe a little easier. It’s like a card game; the moment you read your opponent and can sense you’ve got the better hand.
Voldemort made the world a darker place. Harry hated the visions, because being in Voldemort’s head, he sensed the void inside him: a black hole that swallowed everything that was light and sweet and kind. Sharing Voldemort’s mind terrified Harry for he feared one day the black hole would devour him, too; gobble him up and spit out a hollow shell.
‘Come with me,’ Draco said. He held Harry's hand and led him upstairs to the bedroom at the back of the building.
, he wanted to say,
‘I heard your voice,’ Harry insisted. ‘I saw you — or well, I thought it was you, but I definitely heard your voice.’
Outside, Malfoy veers down a twisting alley, and Harry follows him, exultant and impatient. When they’re not in sight of the main road, he pushes Malfoy against the wall, catching him by surprise. A faint growl comes from his lips as Harry presses down on him.
‘This is where we first slept together.’ Draco made his voice flirty; suggestive rather than enquiring.
The land changed. They entered a forest full of gurgling streams and birds calling in the night. The underbrush caught at his feet making him stumble. Malfoy started sneezing. Hunger made Harry dizzy, which was possibly why he felt that the trees reached out to touch him, to caress his cheek. He heard whispers coming through the woods, soft talk, laughter, even a snippet of a song. He looked at Malfoy, who’d turned towards the sound.
realises Rookwood isn’t coming back, he’ll think we killed him or something. He’ll know Rookwood found us here in this area.’ He took a deep breath and let it out. He’d made his decision. ‘I’ll go to Tinworth. As soon as possible. And— I’ll show my face around there.’
‘I could touch you whenever I wanted,’ Draco replied. ‘And I did. All the time.’
‘Do you call each other by your surname?’ Dawn asked, slicing peppers by the sink. ‘I assumed you were friends.’
‘Well, he plays better chess than all of youse. It’s a distraction. I only played with him twice—this week.’ He mumbled the last part.
‘Do you regret it?’ Draco asked a few minutes later. He was fully clothed now, back straight, face indifferent, even disdainful. The face that infuriated Harry.
‘He gets these… fits.’ Draco explained and some people nodded.
They Apparate to the stoop of Grimmauld Place and Potter lets Draco in, ushering him to the drawing room. He wraps himself around Draco, kissing his neck, his hands moving under Draco’s robes, but Draco’s attention is drawn by the tapestry on the wall.
‘Well, then we don’t need Nariyoshi. He’s out.’
‘What’s that?’
They argued for a few moments about the prudency of sending back a reply. In the end, they reached a compromise: the bird flew away with a bluebell in its beak. Watching him fly off, Draco said wistfully, ‘My mother was named after a flower.’
?’ Weasley rolls his eyes.
‘You were crushing on me?’
A gasp. ‘Again,’ said Harry, and Draco, kissing him sloppily on the jaw and the corner of his mouth, did it again, fucking him desperately, pumping swiftly. He was starting to lose control again and Harry revelled in it. ‘Faster, Draco, fuck me until the end,’ he rasped nonsensically, and Draco, a wild laugh escaping him and betraying a loss of control, thrust deeper and deeper.
Draco grabbed the handset soaring through the window, and they slunk out of the back door to the dark alley running along the side of the church. A bright yellow light illuminated the darkness: the Death Eaters had set the oak on fire.
Potter doesn’t notice. He’s laid back, gripping the table with his hands, taking Draco’s cock as if he was born for it. Potter’s cock is leaking, flushed and engorged, and Draco can tell he’s about to come. He grabs the base of it tight, ignoring Potter’s whimper. ‘You’ll be begging me for release.’ Draco’s veins have flooded with so much power he’s intoxicated. ‘
‘Don’t say that, They’ll hear!’ Draco hissed. He sighed at Harry's uncompehending look. ‘Do you remember learning about faeries?’
‘But—’ Malfoy pointed at the blouse.
Draco jumps.
‘I love
It was a twig that alerted Harry. A tiny, insignificant crunch behind him that ended up saving their lives. Instinctively, he dove to the ground, pulling Draco down with him, a second before a red spark hit the oak where they’d been standing; a non-verbal Stunner that gouged the bark.
‘Who the fuck knows that code?’
P.S. YES, I CAN DO IT. I WORK IN THE TIME ROOM.
‘Probably sent with him to bribe the right people. We’ll need some of that to help Draco with taking his new post.’
Harry had moved to the clothing section, picking up jumpers. He shrugged. ‘It got the job done.’
,’ she spits. ‘Viola.’ Draco dimly remembers a Great Aunt of his grandfather’s. ‘Cursed,’ the portrait says, her malicious eyes blazing. ‘A demon. A
Harry glanced at him. The instructions were a little
The men scurried out of the room in a hurry, making their useless promises, and Nagini slithered in and curled at his feet, sensing his agitation. Voldemort reached down to her and stroked her head. ‘Potter’s mine, Nagini, but you can have Malfoy.’ The snake flicked its tongue.
‘Tonight,’ Draco insisted. ‘Or else.’
Draco lets the use of his first name slide. He pulls Potter to the edge of the table and enters him in one long slide, sucking in a deep breath to calm the onslaught of the magical energy that pours in his veins like a tempest. Potter’s a feast for the senses, and Draco almost whimpers at how delicious it feels, at how tightly Potter’s arse hugs his prick, at the touch of his hands on Draco’s skin, and the softness of his lips on Draco’s mouth. He thrusts inside once more. Potter groans.
Meanwhile, his parents, in the real world, would witness the death of their only child.
‘Useless fucking dogs.’ Dolohov spat. ‘Magically trained, my arse. Goyle is full of shit. Greyback would have been a better choice. The werewolves can smell better than the mutts.’
‘Um, sorry, I didn’t mean—’
Part of what would be the sitting room in a normal house had been transformed into a bird habitat: owls and sparrows and thrushes flew over their heads or nestled under a wing on one of the numerous perches. A duck strolled in, quaking and leaving wet prints on the dark wood floor. On a windowsill lay a blue tit, shivering from the cold. Draco traced a finger over its … well, its
‘We decided you needed a stronger incentive,’ her mother adds.
Malfoy leans closer over the stand. ‘Can you talk about your research, or is it something you keep…’ he gives Harry a smooth glance from top to bottom, ‘hidden?’
Potter stood furthest from everyone and stared unblinkingly at Draco. Then, he turned on his heel and stormed out. Well, that was that then.
They both take out their wands. ‘Any tips in that leaflet of yours?’ Harry asks.
Malfoy sighed and looked at Harry, who tried for an approximation of the truth; they owed it to them, even if it meant being kicked out.
‘How did you— um. Why do you think it was me?’
Harry was talking. ‘… I wanted to be ready for you. I felt like bottoming tonight.’
‘So,’ Harry cleared his throat. ‘In the Mirror…’
‘I was in the Somme,’ Harry volunteers one day. The man hasn’t asked, and he probably doesn’t care. They all have stories like that. The Somme, the Marne, Gallipoli…
Harry had never imagined receiving an apology from Draco. Of course, he also hadn’t imagined receiving a blowjob from him, but life had taken a turn. ‘Thank you. I appreciate it.’ He wondered if he should be equally formal, perhaps add a “One accepts your apology, old chap”, but Draco leaned back, looking satisfied.
Draco lets a long moment pass, hoping Potter will change his mind and leave. He doesn’t.
me, but you refuse to see it.’
‘Hush.’
, he’d exploded.
But no one’s coming now, not this time, and Harry crawls in the water to reach Draco.
‘Speaking of dreams…’ Malfoy says.
She gazes at Harry in clear expectation of a reply and Harry stalls, nodding and sipping his champagne, furtively glancing around for Hermione in the hopes she’ll swoop in and translate what he’d just heard because he’s not sure it was English. Half of the words sounded made-up. He initially liked the portrait; harrowing eyes in a hollow face, tones of muted grey. Made him think of a face that has seen the depth of human darkness, but now his words sound poor and clumsy.
Struck by the silence in the room, Draco glances at Harry, who stares at Draco with a curious frown. ‘What?’
A bird cawed outside the window in the morning. Harry pulled the cover over his eyes, trying to prolong the lovely dream he’d had, but it dissipated like mist. Pleasant dreams rarely visited him these days and he wished it had lingered. Warmth enveloped him and his stomach rumbled with normal morning hunger rather than that gnawing, empty feeling he’d got used to in the last few months. The sheets smelled stale, but not unpleasantly so. Clean, but unused. He registered another pleasant scent near him, a combination of musk, hair, soap. He turned his head. Malfoy was still asleep.
. I don’t want to know your private fantasies.’
’ll pay.’
‘Some do. But a Bob is usually a confirmed bachelor. He doesn’t marry. But, sometimes, he might take a lodger. A roommate. To cover expenses, you understand.’
Harry doesn’t shut up. ‘Only when I had a good reason. Only because I—’
Harry couldn’t last much longer. Grabbing Draco’s waist, Harry raised his hips and buried himself as deep as he could inside Draco, listening to the sweet, broken sounds he made. The pace grew erratic, Harry helplessly descending into a mindless state of pure lust, and fucking,
Harry smirked. ‘You’re familiar with our “kind”, then? Did you dream as a kid to become a pirate? Run off to sea and sink your teeth into gold, booze and women?’
‘I’m all right.’ The mortification of collapsing after sex with a new lover and needing to be fed is something Harry’s pushed to the very back of his mind, and he doesn’t want to be reminded. He’s already decided he’ll take the story to the grave and hopes it hasn’t ruined his chances with Malfoy. ‘Thank you for looking after me.’
Malfoy’s shoulders relaxed. ‘Truce?’
— assuming they’d made it through the night — reared its head. Harry had a destination; Draco didn’t. Letting him walk off on his own wasn’t an option Harry was prepared to entertain. In fact, only one solution presented itself to Harry; it wouldn’t be
Harry says it, because he feels it needs to be said: ‘It’s half eight on a Wednesday. We’re in a
‘Don’t call her that,’ Draco rasped, his voice still scratchy.
‘All right then.’ She stalks to a concealed window, flinging it open, and whistles. An owl lands on the sill, blinking slowly. ‘You can use her to send it to the hospital now. It works immediately. Write a note to the Healers to confirm the recovery. Bao will fly back with the note, you can give us the figurine, and this whole sorry affair will be over.’
‘You’re awfully quiet,’ Draco said. He sat up and touched Harry’s face. ‘I’ll miss being on the ship, too,’ he said, as if he’d read Harry’s thoughts.
‘Thank you for not giving us up. For feeding us,’ Harry told him.
Potter shuts the door carefully behind him and takes a few steps inside the studio. He examines the colourful glazed bowls and the terracotta pots on the displays, the new pots drying on the shelves in the back. He pauses in front of the kintsugi shelf.
It’s not. It’s been three months.
‘Potions would help,’ he agrees, his lips muffled on Potter’s shoulder. ‘But I’m not sure how he’d take to learning about magic. And I don’t want to give him something without his knowledge, even if it’s for his health. It feels wrong.’
Harry’s coming out of the bathroom when he sees the man waiting. He’s holding a razor. Harry gasps and the man hastens to explain. ‘I’m only going to shave my head.’ Harry exhales with relief; Crabbe’s suicide three weeks ago has shaken him.
got up to!’ He cackled. ‘Oh, dear old Lucius is going to have a heart attack when he finds out his boy is spreading for Potter!’
?’ Potter stared incredulously at Draco. ‘Babe, I’m coming with you.’
In an indirect way perhaps, but still. The day had dawned for Draco not dissimilar to many of his Eighth Year days: he was leaving the Arithmancy classroom when three sixth-year Ravenclaws cast a hex behind his back, causing boils to erupt on his face. The sudden, sharp pain made him trip on the stairs, and he fell, books and quills scattering around him. The girls laughed themselves silly, while another Ravenclaw from his year reached a hand to help him stand up.
‘Is that supposed to scare me?’
Draco considered the bird. ‘Melor’s probably instructed to return with some acknowledgment that the letter was received.’
‘Do Bobs get married?’
‘It’s alright. Here,’ Harry scraped them onto Malfoy’s plate. ‘I’m full anyway.’
‘I thought I’d killed you. I thought—’ Harry can’t speak; sobs rake his chest.
Draco had to put his cup down to hide the trembling in his hands.
‘It has to be you.
Harry had spent most of the past months surviving on mushrooms, but what was Malfoy’ excuse? He should've had access to three square meals a day, but he looked as thin as Harry. Perhaps having Snape as Headmaster had ruined the quality of cooking and that’s why Malfoy hated being in school. He wouldn't put it past him to call school
‘Of course not!’
, and Ron and Hermione have forgotten him, they’re having a baby, they’ve all—
‘You know,’ Harry says, taking the swirly straw in his mouth. ‘No one would ever
Climbing the stairs after dinner, Draco headed to the first floor bathroom and Harry paused at the landing. Last night he’d promised Draco he’d help clean his wound again, but Draco shut the door behind him without a backward glance, his stiff back the only indication he was upset.
‘I can do it to you every day,’ Harry says. ‘If you let me keep you.’
On their way to the food, an obstacle presented itself in the form of a plump older lady. ‘First you wash your hands before dinner.’ She led them to a tub of water next to a blue wagon but remained there, observing them as they picked up the soap in turns.
Harry smiled at him before he gave in to his ardent desire and explored every inch of Draco’s body. He caressed Draco’s stomach and the fair hair that led to his resting cock; he stroked all the way down Draco’s leg, touching his ankles and his toes one by one; his hand travelled up the inside of Draco’s leg, cupping his balls and weighing them in his palm.
‘Ah,’ Harry smiled. ‘You mean Patsy and Eddie from Ab Fab? It’s a TV series. How do you even know about this?’
The magazine was Granger’s idea for an appropriate Eighth Year project. People bandied about words like “cooperation” and “learning to live together” while at the same time throwing hostile glances at Draco or spitting in his tea. Words were easy; overcoming years of animosity, mountains of prejudice and oceans of recent grief not so much.
In the morning, breakfast was a silent affair. Esther had stayed in bed, and Draco and Harry made their own breakfast, under the watchful eye of Dawn, who darned socks by the window. Draco looked like he hadn’t slept much, but neither of them made any reference to last night’s conversation. Harry’s thoughts now revolved around the risk these two women were taking by letting them stay. He itched to talk to Draco about it, and Dawn gave him the opportunity when she sent them to the forest to gather wood.
‘You absolute fucking
‘Is your other daughter coming?’ Harry asked. They’d learned by now the names of Esther’s children: Hannah and Talia, and the late Elijah and Levi.
He stalks to the back of the room and places the statue on her feet, pressing the little bump. He’d added that one last night, knowing they couldn’t come close enough to check. A tiny signal flashes to the Aurors hidden outside.
Harry chuckled. The train was crossing a viaduct, the town of Penryn, according to the signs, spread at their feet. White and red boats bobbed in the water, bathed in pale sunlight.
It took Harry a moment to get his voice to work. ‘Probably not as a deep. Or they’re newer. In any case, we should treat them, too.’
The next morning, Draco kept his eyes shut, trying to hold on to what had been the best dream he’d ever had. He wasn’t ready for the disappointment of waking up to his real life.

‘I…er—’ Harry paused. What do you say to the man who fucked you into unconsciousness? ‘I’m grateful,’ he said. ‘About
Draco finds he can’t breathe. He’s protected this secret with his life, and the only people who knew — a warden in Azkaban and his mother — are both dead.

‘The Headmistress wants to see you.’
world has no place for us. I’m only trying to make a living.’ He stared into Malfoy’s eyes and his voice hardened. ‘Do not overestimate my willingness to be reasonable. If your father won’t pay, we have no use for you on the ship.’
‘You’re getting rid of it?’
‘What are you doing these days?’ he asks, careful to avoid saying “after prison.”
‘Explain.’
Alone in the cold room, Draco pads to the wall and checks his genealogical tree. Like Granger said, he’s not a full Incubus — the actual son of a Veela and a vampire — but merely a descendant of one. He’s entertained the thought for a while now that the Creature ancestor must have come from the Black side of the family — he likes to think it’s what named them Black. It’s an idle thought, but tracing the gold thread with his finger, he finds what he thinks is confirmation.
and the stairs had been rebuilt. Draco had ordered a similar wallpaper to the one in the Mirror world. He touched the wall with a finger. ‘It’ll look nice when it’s done, Potter.’
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. ‘Why, Hermione? He’s as rich as Croesus, the reports said.’
‘Of course not,’ Malfoy sneered.
‘Excuse me?’
‘Exactly. So let’s hope that dear Lucius pays what we asked him to.’ Harry turned to leave but paused at the door and addressed Colin and Seamus. ‘Move him to Cho’s former cabin. If he annoys you, gag him.’
, shut up.’
he’d been feeling all day when he caught glimpses of emotion and vulnerability behind the mask Malfoy hurried to put on. It disturbed Harry, this uneasiness that settled in his chest. His mind warned him that it could only mean one thing: deception. This could all be a ruse, making Malfoy look like a decent person before the carpet was pulled under Harry’s feet.
To cover his momentary display of vulnerability, Malfoy put the bomber jacket aside and stood with open arms, imperial and haughty, an invitation for Harry to dress him. Pauline beamed at the sight of a ritual she would never herself experience. Harry stepped closer and put the parka on Malfoy. It was large in the shoulders and perhaps a little too long, but the olive colour suited him. His eyes met Malfoy’s in the mirror, and Malfoy looked away.
‘Just like a kitten,’ she said fondly to Draco, who still glared sideways at the vacuum cleaner. ‘We had cats in the past. Ezra, my late husband, loved them. They were scared of the vacuum, too.’ She settled the mint plant by the window, still shaking her head with laughter.
Dream-Malfoy grabs Harry and turns him over. He opens Harry’s legs and positions himself behind him. Everything happens too fast, but it’s a dream and dreams don’t need preparations or explanations as to how Malfoy could have ended in Harry’s bed. No, what they need, Harry thinks, his cheeks pressed on his pillow as Malfoy enters him, is a good fucking.
, Harry. That’s what I am. I take and take, and sometimes — sometimes it’s hard for me to stop. And you make it
?’ She gathered her braids in a bun on the top of her head as she spoke.
Alone, Harry clutched the vacuum tightly and tried to control his breathing. Snape and Voldemort had given two of his worst Death Eaters free reign to take these kids’ minds and twist them. They allowed the Carrows to
And it was done. Harry wiped the sweat off his brow, his ears ringing with the silence that followed the noise and the screams of the battle. His crew piled the dead together and took the wounded to Cho, the ship’s surgeon. He assigned a few of his men to make McNair’s ship presentable. Harry hadn’t yet told them of the plan to have Draco take McNair’s place, but he’d need to do it tonight. It was an ambitious plan. Risky. Possibly insane.
‘Sixteenth,’ Malfoy corrected, and Harry pressed his lips to stop himself from snorting.
She turned to him, surprised at the urgency in his voice. ‘Nothing. I see only me. Draco, what is it? You’re scaring me.’
‘Draco’s absolutely right,’ she says, using his given name as if they’re friends. ‘We can’t rely on false stereotypes from the past to shape our understanding of such an elusive Creature.’
‘That’s very sad,’ Harry said. Had his mother sung to him? He could never know. ‘No one has ever sung me a lullaby. Or maybe my mother did, but I don’t remember it.’ He hated how his voice croaked. ‘It’d have been a Muggle lullaby anyway.’
‘I’m worth a
of all people, but there Smith was, a sub leashed to a tall, blonde Dom, and in the kind of outfit that had no place in a school. Or anywhere outside a special kind of club, really. However, no one batted an eyelid and Professor Sprout even stopped to speak to him; Smith nodded his answers.
However, despite his posturing, Malfoy seemed reluctant to take advantage of his direct line to Voldemort. The hand that held the dagger fell limp by his side.
Unbetaed. Apologies for any errors.
The news continued with a report on the devastation caused in the touristic areas by hurricanes. Harry remained standing, his mind churning. He’d have thought that after all those deaths he’d witnessed he’d have an easier time dealing with casual murder. He’d seen Sirius fall in the Veil. He’d seen Dumbledore murdered by a man he trusted. Harry had clutched Cedric’s body; he’d raged at the mindless death of someone who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
And maybe even a lifetime.
It wasn’t a farmhouse but a modest castle, perched on a steep cliff. Harry urged his legs on and on until he passed the open gates and reached the front doors of the keep. He knocked and waited, holding onto the stone wall to keep himself standing.
‘How?’
With a pang, Harry noticed that it was the same cheddar he’d eaten in the tavern before kissing Salazar. He hoped that eventually such small things would stop reminding him of that night.
‘We?’
A tap dripped in the shower, the sound echoing in the hollow silence.
Harry will miss the almost-white hair. He’s grown used to seeing it from the distance as he limps to the pond. He doesn’t say anything, though. The war has gouged them all, and if they want to indulge in a little fancy, who’s to blame them?
It hasn’t escaped Harry’s notice that the man hasn’t let go of his hand. ‘No one deserves those.’
If Harry hadn’t been around Draco so much recently, he’d have missed the subtle way his expression brightened. ‘It didn’t do much good, did it?’
Draco brushes his lips. ‘Maybe you love Bob. I’m not Bob.’
He tugged the parchment loose and opened it between them. Harry leaned over him, reading these words:
‘Are they an idiot?’
‘Really?’ The relief Harry felt at this news was accompanied by a pang of loss. He was startled to realise he’d miss Draco.
Camelford’s narrow streets led to a pretty river where Malfoy sat on a bench in muddy, bloody robes, attracting hostile looks from the locals. Harry stood for a moment, clutching his purchases, and watched him. Malfoy looked defeated, head in his hands, staring at the ground. A little voice told Harry that he could leave. He owed nothing to Malfoy. He could simply walk away and start figuring out how to reach his friends.
‘What was that?’ Draco’s lips brushed Harry’s neck.
, of course; Incubi and Succubi might not be as compelling as Veelas, but their sex appeal isn’t negligible; in fact, the very opposite. Even straight men fall under Draco’s spell occasionally. Slips of the tongue are the brain’s way of suggesting their subconscious caught some of the pheromones Draco’s exuding.
Harry’s mouth went dry. He hummed something indistinct.
They drank in silence for a while. Harry glanced at Draco, hoping for more glimpses of his unrestrained side, but he’d withdrawn into himself again.
‘Oy, you two, stop snogging, this is a raid we got here!’ Weasley shouts from behind them.
It wasn’t unexpected. In the Mirror world, Draco had found himself in an existing relationship with Harry, but here he had no idea how to proceed. He didn’t know if it was a one-off for Harry, or if he’d want to see Draco again. Uncertainty stopped every word in his throat.
This also sounds like flirting, and Malfoy’s eyes sparkle.
They ordered a carafe of wine and a platter of cheese and grapes and the more they talked, the more Harry felt entranced by the man. Salazar exhibited a wit that entertained Harry. His sharp mind was accompanied by sensuality in the way he licked his fingers after bites of cheese. Harry’s desire for him increased as the night progressed, every muscle tense with the effort not to jump over the table and kiss him.
When no one walked in, Harry’s heart thumped in pure terror. He instinctively stretched a hand to the bedside table for a wand that wasn’t there — he cursed himself for forgetting — and then… Draco padded in, shutting the door gently behind him.
‘Who created the Sanctuary? Who keeps the place clean and warm?’
‘You don’t eat mushrooms?’ Malfoy asked now with a nod at Harry’s plate.
would fix them perfectly — no cracks or faults, the original unblemished again. But Draco likes kintsugi, because he knows life isn’t like
of what he was meant to do and prayed to Salazar that he wouldn’t mess it up. With a light shove, he pushed the head in Harry’s arse and gasped.
Harry chuckled. ‘Fourteen presents, Draco.
Somewhere Voldemort was looking for wandmakers to threaten for information about his wand. Somewhere Narcissa Malfoy stared at the sky, waiting for the owl to return, fearful for her life over this betrayal. Somewhere in Hogwarts Harry’s friends were fighting a cruel system. Somewhere Ron and Hermione waited for a scrap of news about him. And in Tinworth Dolohov waited for a sign of them. Heart beating fast with anticipation, Harry marched down the path with Draco by his side, heading straight to give it to him.
Harry looked into his eyes — grey, wide, terrified beneath the irritation —  and made his decision. He grabbed the dagger and slashed his hand, wincing a little. He clutched Malfoy’s palm, bringing the cuts together, mixing the blood. Harry’s wound stung like hell, but they both held tight, their eyes on the silver thread that slowly faded into wisps — and then nothing. The tug vanished and Harry breathed out heavily. He glanced at their handshake and met Malfoy’s eyes, who let go quickly.
‘Are they Hufflepuff?’
‘Ah, don’t fret. We move a lot these days anyhow. These are troubled times.’ He cast a look over them both. ‘Look after yourselves, yeah?’
, he’s never really experienced true pleasure. Trust Potter to differ in this, as in everything else, from the garden variety wizard. Of course, Harry Potter’s always been different; Draco’s willing to accept that.
‘I know.’ Draco stroked his palm with a long finger. ‘I know you did.’
‘Anyone want to play darts?’ Potter interrupts.
‘There’s loads of stories about the moor,’ Malfoy said as they walked. He rambled about the Arthurian legends associated with it. ‘Some people say Dozmary pool is where Arthur found the Excalibur.’
It seemed the bad news wouldn’t stop. Harry had to hope the Malfoy house-elves performed their duties with diligence, but he couldn’t worry about it now. His priority was to find a way to Tinworth and his friends.
‘I’m OK.’ Harry rose on hands and knees. Draco held him under the arm and lifted him. Harry blinked at the firelit faces of the assembled, worried Romani. ‘I’m fine,’ he repeated dully.
‘I love it,’ Draco said, realising he wasn’t exactly lying. Sure, his vanity would prefer it if he wrote the kind of incisive articles that Granger, Padma Patil and Goldstein wrote, articles about how the Dark Lord’s coup had split their society in two and suggestions as to how to mend it, but the horoscopes turned out to be creative and fun. Besides, he was still tickled by how many people—Libras presumably—sported flower crowns last month.
Mrs Li ignores him. Her hair is elegantly tied back and she wears a dark blue dress that probably cost more than their sofa. Draco’s certain the sapphires on her ears are genuine; spoils of her victories at poker. She’s the picture of understated wealth and power; incongruous next to Nariyoshi in his suede fringed waistcoat and peace-symbol necklace.
that he hadn’t managed to sleep with his husband yet.
Sometimes he thought two good weeks were preferable to a life of this.
‘Aren’t you kind.’
, slithered towards Harry’s stomach. Inch by inch, Draco explored the soft skin there. A tremor built in Harry’s muscles, which he suppressed with effort; he didn’t want to pretend to wake up and break the spell. He wanted Draco to keep touching him.
‘You can thank your lucky stars I saw you walking right into the forest like an utter
‘Easy now,’ a voice speaks behind him.
Draco until Draco shuddered and let out a yelp, ropes of come spilling on Harry’s stomach. His arse clenched around Harry’s cock, pushing Harry over the edge. Harry thrust one last time and came with a muffled gasp, his orgasm tearing through his brain, leaving behind nothing but the image of Draco seared in his mind.
’ Malfoy replied, tight lipped.
and that was exactly what he’d wanted.
Draco faced Harry, allowing him access to the hurt shoulder, but Harry’s eyes fell on the long, thin scars on his chest. He froze, unable to look anywhere else but the white, raised skin crossing Draco’s chest and flat stomach. He realised he’d been staring, but the reminder of almost killing someone stopped the words in his throat.
Dumbledore laughed. ‘But of course. The Shack is a magical house. Draco,’ he turned to him, ‘Have you heard of wizards and witches saying that a house “has character”? It’s an expression that has passed in the Muggle society, although for them it means something entirely different. Victorian moulding or an antique fireplace, for instance. Magical houses, though, have actual character—and, it seems, desires, as well.’
Harry picked the card up with shaking hands. Dumbledore winked at him and straightened his hat. Harry was seized by the irrational desire to shout at the image of the man who waved at him, oblivious to the feelings of grief and love and resentment warring inside Harry at the thought of his old Professor. He gave vent to his frustration, not towards the portrait on the collector’s card, but to the flesh and blood man sitting some feet away.
‘Noooo,’ he says, shaking the corpse as if he can stop what’s happening. ‘No, not an Inferi, who did this, who
Harry meets Malfoy’s heated gaze. Desire crackles at his veins; he’s tempted to drag Malfoy to the nearest dark corner, but, for now, he savours the anticipation of what’ll come after. Hopefully.
idiot you are, trying to get yourself killed before the Dark Lord has a go!’
The man was sitting in the shadows, a lone lamp lighting his cheekbones and the expensive cut of his clothes. Harry knew he’d been stripped of jewels and weapons upon his capture. He took in the man’s long legs and his insolent posture and continued, ‘Your father will indeed hear about this—and then he’ll pay us the ransom, like they all do, worried we’ll hurt their precious little heirs.’
‘Both.’ Draco gasped as Harry stroked his cock with a firm hand. ‘Mostly you fucked me.’
Draco clutched his wand tighter but didn’t move. Heart thudding loudly, Harry glanced around them, trying to think. Their spot was vulnerable, exposed as they were in the fringes of the forest. They were also near the cottage.
Only one part of Draco’s body was excluded from Harry’s exploration: Draco’s left forearm. Neither made any mention of it, but the shape of the Mark squatted between them, the ugly elephant in the room. Harry had no idea what was going to happen with him and Draco now; what it’d all meant. If it meant anything. Kissing was one thing, but this — this had been something else, something that had branded Harry in a way. Draco had left his mark on Harry now; an invisible one but no less searing.
. A darling friend asked for:
, and got up to date with the lurid details of Potter’s life. The early marriage and the swift divorce; his ex-wife’s relationship with Cho Chang of all people; the few dates Potter’s been out with. Mostly women, but also Goldstein from school. Three days later and Draco was none the wiser as to a way into Potter’s life. Visiting Potter in sleep was a last resort.
Neighing drew Harry’s attention to the other side of the clearing. ‘
‘It was a lucky guess, that’s all,’ Dumbledore said. ‘Miss Lovegood found you in front of the Mirror. I simply put two and two together.’
Harry abandons the food. ‘I don’t think I can look Kreacher in the eye,’ he says, his eyes wrinkled in a smile.
‘You OK?’ Draco rushes to him and holds him tight.
‘Out of curiosity,’ Draco’s voice squeaked and he coughed. ‘What did the man look like?’
‘—because you were a twat—’
Draco stood, his face stormy. ‘I need to talk to someone. Excuse me.’
‘You should get out of your clothes. I’ll ring for a gown.’ Draco pulled a rope dangling on the wall and returned to Harry’s side. He took his dripping coat and left it on the back of a chair, then stretched a hand for the rest.
One of the advantages of being part-Incubus is the ability to enter and influence the subconscious of others at will, feeding from the sexual energy released in erotic dreams. It doesn’t provide the same nourishment as real sex does, not even close, but nor does it affect his… (‘prey,’ his mind supplies)

, and the tiny photograph they took at the photo booth. ‘I’m— stressed.’
‘Liar.’ Malfoy’s smirk lights a fire in Harry’s gut.
‘I need to find Ron and Hermione.’ Saying their names aloud brought to the surface all the worry Harry’d been suppressing. He’d dearly hoped they were safe. ‘We have… somewhere to go.’ Draco nodded. He looked a lot more miserable than a moment ago, and it pained Harry to see him like this. He took a step closer, stretched his hand. ‘Which is why I think you—’
Their footsteps echoed down dark corridors and past sleeping portraits until they reached the hospital wing. They didn’t speak, although Potter glanced several times at Draco.
‘Do you remember your battalion?’
Cancer:
‘I’m not trying to drown you. Put your head under water so they won’t smell you. Hurry. I’ll hold your glasses.’ When Harry hesitated, he whispered, ‘I haven’t given you any reason to distrust me this last day, Potter.’
‘A bastard you were frotting against just now.’
Dawn spoke. ‘He’s one of them wiccans, isn’t he?’
When Nariyoshi is gone, Draco will have no one.
Malfoy grabs two champagne flutes from a floating tray and offers one to Harry. His countenance changes from sweet and playful to something darker, but infinitely more exciting. ‘Wanna get out of here?’
‘I can’t even imagine what it’s like in there. Even with the Dementors gone. I shouldn’t have mentioned prison last time. I was angry and—’ He huffs a low laugh. ‘You’ve always managed to push my buttons, you know? Anyhow, I’m truly sorry for being so callous and upsetting you.’
Harry sat up. ‘They found out — from Beth and Pauline, I suppose — that we’re heading to Tinworth. Dolohov will go there to wait for us.’ Draco blanched. Harry continued. ‘There’s more.
The man Draco is supposed to con.
‘These are sweet, Draco, thank you,’ Dawn said, when she received the bouquets. ‘And — unusual.’
Silence followed his words, murky and heavy, full of dark moving things. Harry’s blood boiled. The lack of a wand seemed fortuitous, because otherwise he’d Apparate to school straight away, Horcruxes be damned.
Turning to his side, Harry stared at Draco’s empty pillow. He’d been a while coming to bed — had he discovered late night TV? Harry ignored the desire to go seek him out. Draco would come to bed when he wanted to, Harry wasn’t his guardian. He’d just thought… Well, never mind that.
thinking of you. Knowing that I could have you again.’ He bucked his hips hard, his voice a low gasp, as he added, ‘…and again, and again…’
Ginny.”
Harry kissed him hard. ‘
‘Soldier. Or “dear”.’
‘Where do you think you’re going?’ Harry snapped.
‘Not anymore?’ Harry asks.
That night, Draco was late to bed again. Harry’s scar ached; closing his eyes dragged him into the mire of the dreaded visions. Voldemort hunted wandmakers in his unceasing — and, so far, futile — effort to find out why the Elder Wand failed to be the exceptional instrument he’d expected. Answers eluded him. His frustration on top of his lieutenants’ failure in apprehending Harry and Draco enraged him, a fury he barely kept under control. He lashed out and punished and struck. Harry struggled against the bleak tide of his visions, trying to cling to the burnished memories of the last couple of days. Kissing Draco. Touching him.
‘No,’ she said, vigorously soaping him. It was the most thorough hand-washing Harry had ever witnessed. ‘We’ve got few wands between us as it is. Not many
Malfoy took out the dagger. ‘Only one way, Potter.’ He cut the flesh of his palm and stretched it towards Harry.

? Why couldn’t the Lis have asked him to seduce some other person, someone bland, someone whom Draco could shag perfunctorily and extract the figurine from, before walking away unharmed? Draco drops the noodles in the broth, raging with impotent fury at the Lis and Potter and himself and even Nariyoshi’s stupid, ailing kidneys.
They found several others in the pitch and the game turned into an impromptu Eighth Year four-a-side match where players disregarded House loyalty, and different Houses played side by side. This was similar to the real life’s Eighth Year games, except that this time Draco was a part of them, teaming up with Dean Thomas, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Padma Patil. Draco failed to catch the Snitch this time, which was to be expected as he spent most of the game time ogling Harry on his broom (not unlike what he used to do in real life if he was honest with himself).
Guilt
‘You’re not from around here.’ She eyed Malfoy with curiosity.
‘Ehm…’
‘I’m not an invalid,’ Harry protested.
After a long shower, Draco’s head cleared. Blood returned to his brain, though memories of the night before flashed in his mind sporadically, causing his prick to remain half-hard at all times. However, the unwelcome guest of rationality had visited him, impressing on him the urge to figure out where the hell he was.
‘You know, since he’s in your life now, the Statute can be waived. I know magic can’t Conjure a working kidney for him, but it can help alleviate his symptoms,’ Potter suggests. He moves to the sofa, and Draco abandons his water and slips next to him. Potter opens his arms and Draco rests against him. Relief and gratitude overwhelm him. He’s had no one to talk about this before.
Boot waited, his body tight in apprehension. He probably wondered if Draco knew and if he’d tell. Draco lowered his voice and said, ‘I saw you. You were happy. You were

‘Lady Diana is
. Bring the Malfoy brat so he can die, squealing, in front of Lucius. The Malfoys need to be taken to task. I’ve allowed their incompetence to go unpunished for far too long.’ Fury coursed through his veins at the thought of Potter escaping his grasp again. ‘But don’t speak of this. Pretend their son is coming home.’ This would make it all the more painful for the Malfoys. All the more edifying a lesson.
Draco nodded.
‘Dolohov. Getting punished.’
‘You’re squeezing my hand too hard, Malfoy.’
‘Nah, didn’t you see the birds? Something startled them.’
‘Unusual spices,’ Malfoy commented. ‘Delicious, though.’
Wanting to make an effort for the alliance’s sake, Harry forked a piece of duck confit and offered it to Draco. What he received for his effort was a frightfully condescending look and the response: ‘I’m a pescetarian.’
‘Nothing.’ Malfoy turned to the wall. ‘Find me a jacket. That sounds like a valet’s job.’
During the rest of the day, Harry wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes for fear he’d see right through him and sneer at his pathetic attraction. Harry avoided even glancing at him when Draco handed him a cup of tea, or dried dishes by his side, or walked in the forest in the morning in a strained silence, picking up wood for the fire and flowers for more elaborate and bizarre bouquets, which Draco then placed at specific locations in the house. Harry’s early morning wank had unlocked something inside him and now Harry couldn’t look at Draco and not notice his arms flexing when he lifted something heavy, or his arse in the Oxfam jeans, or the way his eyes wrinkled when he smiled — which he did to the ladies, a lot.
