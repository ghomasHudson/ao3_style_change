Draco removed his hand from Harrys throat, putting it on his chest, exactly over the boys beating heart instead.
Shadowfax came to a halt too and stumped his hoof into the ground impatiently. He let out a little neigh and looked at Harry expectantly. The thestral seemed in excellent condition after his long sleep and he was obviously full of energy.
Draco nodded in agreement. They decided it was best if they erased their tracks in case the Death Eaters followed them.
After they found a decent amount of mushrooms and some more herbs and berries they returned to their camp. Harry pulled out his wand.
Harry finally took his wand in hand and started enchanting larger pieces of wood to slowly build up a small circular fence around the area around the tree, Shadowfax and himself. When there was enough wood stacked up so the wall was around 3 meters high (enough so Shadowfax could stand up if he needed to) Harry used Wingardium Leviosa to summon some huge green tree branches to work as a roof.
Harry stalked towards the cowering blonde figure on the ground until he stood right in front of him. He felt his wand in his pocket but decided to leave it there, there would be no need for it since he saw Draco dropping his own wand back at the astronomy tower when he saw Harry stepping out of the shadows.
Suddenly Draco moved, turning to face Harry but his eyes were closed. Sleeping Draco moved impossibly closer and now draped his one arm over Harrys stomach unconsciously.
At the same time Shadowfax came outside too, stretching his Wings to their full extent and also raising his head as far up into the air as possible, his bright white eyes glaring at the two boys in front of him.
After they finished demolishing the camp from last night and scattered the remainders of the fire, they started heading down the clearing, letting Shadowfax lead the way, hoping his instincts would lead him to find water.
Malfoy seemed to consider this suggestion briefly and Harry almost thought Draco would rather freeze to death than willingly coming within touching distance to him.
Draco lifted one hand up to close it around Harrys throat, placing his fingers exactly on Harrys windpipe. He pressed down for a moment to make his point.
„What in Merlins beard are you doing, Potter?!“ Draco squeaked blushing, too dumbstruck to turn his face away from Harrys almost naked form.
Finally Dracos breathing began to slow down and his body also calmed from ist previous shivers. Harry was actually beginning to feel comfortable and warm, with Shadowfax‘ protective wing still being on top of them. He rested his head against Dracos neck, involuntarily breathing in his smell which reminded Harry a bit of minty rose petals and fresh green apples.
Shadowfax moved in a slow walk towards the edge of the clearing, laying down under a large tree. It was only now that Harry turned around to see Draco sitting on the grass, his knees pulled up towards his chest and his head resting on his crossed arms.
After having processed his shock Malfoys expression grew sour as he watched Harry Potter laughing himself crazy on the ground over Dracos fear. Even the damn Pegasus himself seemed to be amused, even if he had folded up his wings by now and lowered his head in a less intimidating manner. Draco wouldn’t put it past the cunning animal that he scared him on purpose.
Draco flinched a bit at the thought of the thestral might being interested in his precious flesh. Anyway he agreed to preparing the huge fish for them. He bossed Harry around, describing to him which herbs he needed to find to make a meal. When they had everything together and got the fire going it was already sunset.
With a growl Draco took Harrys hand and let himself be dragged on Shadowfax back, sitting behind Harry just like yesterday.
„Listen, Shadowfax“ Harry began and put a hand on the thestrals neck in sympathy „I don’t know why you decided to safe us last night but I am really grateful about it. Thank you. If possible I would be glad if you could stay with us for a while longer, we will need your help out here.“
Harry was having the time of his life plunging in the water, swimming as soon as it was deep enough. When he felt he was as clean as he would get he gripped the stick from earlier and was happy to see the water was shallow enough for him to actually see the fish swimming there. Actually catching them wasn’t as easy though. That didn’t stop Harry from trying and it was a full 45 minutes later when he stopped to have a break.
Well at least someone had regained their confidence, Harry thought. „Shadowfax is not a Pegasus. And he saved our lives if you didn’t notice.“
„Coming to look for something to eat for dinner?“ Harry shouted the question to Draco who still hadn’t left the spot next to the river where he threw up earlier.
Harry felt his legs go weak as the adrenaline left his body. He let out a shaky breath and let himself down to the ground. He saw Malfoy lowering his head into his arms again.
It felt like Draco was about to say something but couldn’t get himself to. But Harry already understood.
„Well then“ Harry said „Don’t you even try doing something funny like stealing my wand while I’m sleeping.“
They left Shadowfax grazing on the field next to the tent while the both of them headed into the forest to find something edible. To Harrys surprise Draco was not only gifted at finding berries but also knew which mushrooms to eat.
Terrified by the impressing pace and the sudden heavy movement under him Draco gripped his hands onto Harrys hips for safety again. This felt different than yesterday when the thestral used his wings instead of his legs. Yesterday it was a soft swinging motion but todays quick trot on the ground had Draco jumping up and down. Harry sat somewhat more relaxed holding on to the thestrals mane.
Harry again closed his eyes, trying to give his thoughts a rest. And to ensure they wouldn’t become cold while sleeping again, he wrapped his arms around Draco under the blanket of their sleeping saviors wing.
And that was when Harry started laughing. Laughing like he didn’t remember laughing in ages. It was just too hilarious seeing Malfoy scare from a peaceful creature like this. Harry just couldn’t stop himself, tears already forming in his eyes. His stomach startet hurting and his legs gave in letting him fall to the ground, still not able to stop laughing.
„I’m going to catch your majesty a fish“, Harry shrugged. „I might as well get a shower while doing it“, he said before he walked towards the river.
With that the boy behind him stilled, still not letting go of Harrys hips though, as if making clear that if he was to fall, Harry was going to fall with him.
„Shit! Shit! Shit!“ he shouted out loud, punching his fists into the ground, which earned him an angry growl from the sleepy thestral.
This actually was more of help than one might have thought, Harrys body soon warmed up and even Dracos body felt warm against Harrys chest by now, but for some reason the other boy was still trembling.
Shadowfax started lowering towards the ground in circles until his hooves finally hit the high grass of the clearing.
Shortly after, Harry heard Draco enter the room and groaning when he got down. His body must still be hurting from all the walking and riding today.
Draco pondered for a moment. He wasn’t exactly freezing like yesterday, the fire warmed him up alright, but he wouldn’t mind physical comfort.
Draco made a confused sound, mumbling something about wondering who Harry meant by ‚he‘, as if taken out of deep thoughts. But shortly after he let his hands slip away from Harry and threw his leg over the hindquarters of the thestral, landing smoothly on the ground. Harry was quick to follow. When his feet hit the ground he finally felt able to breath normally again.
Draco had to swallow a guilty clump down his throat as Harry mentioned the headmaster. Would Dumbledore even allow Draco to return to Hogwarts after what he did? After what he almost did? He didn’t know an answer to that, but he assumed the old fool wouldn’t be his biggest problem if they decided to go back. No, the fact that he failed the task he was given by the Dark Lord himself was a much bigger concern. But Draco didn’t want to deal with any of it right now. He couldn’t help but to feel relieved over the fact that Harry took the decision from him yesterday, that he stopped Draco from having to kill someone. He’d never admit it out loud, but the way Harry allowed him physical comfort yesterday was a greater relief than anything Draco could have wished for. It was the first time someone had hugged him in his sleep and the first time Draco had actually felt save after a long period of restless nights filled with haunting nightmares. So it was just fine by Draco if he could have a day or two just being able to blend everything out and seek comfort in his enemies presence. That‘s what Harry Potter was after all, his enemy. He had to be. And Draco felt weak for letting himself go, for not maintaining his pride. But all he wanted right now was to forget what they fled from. Forget whom they were running from.
Malfoy had calmed down a bit by now, or at least he wasn't shaking against Harry anymore, merely his arms were still wrapped around Harrys waist, but with no force.
„It’s alright, we should give it a few days to give Dumbledore time to sort things out there. He must have seen us escape with Shadowfax so he won’t be too worried.“
„Alright okay, sorry… Shadowfax.“ Draco offered and the thestral seemed to think it was good enough for now.
A part of him, the angry little 11-year-old Harry Potter, couldn’t believe what his grown up self was doing, couldn’t believe that the person he was now would consider neglecting Malfoys countless sins in the past. But that’s all Harry wanted right now. He wanted there to be peace. He wanted to bring out the good in people and if someone like Malfoy had the courage to apologize despite their rivalry Harry just wasn’t the one to not try and make Draco see that being on the good side was worth fighting for.
But then Draco decided he’d rather not die here, in the middle of nowhere next to the worlds damn wannabe savior Harry Potter. So the skinny figure moved until he was in a similar position as Harry, laying on his side, his back to Harrys front as Harrys back was pointed to Shadowfax.
To Harrys amusement Shadowfax also yawned, being the first to walk into the cabin, curling himself up on the ground and tucking his head under one of his wings.
But since the thestral couldn’t seem to care less about Dracos departure Harry left him to finish the rest of the apples alone and instead followed Draco outside.
He thought about trying to Accio the fish but even if it worked it wouldn’t be any fun. So he found himself a stick with a pointy end and started stripping down to his briefs.
„Oh“ Draco hadn’t expected an honest answer like that but nevertheless he felt somehow grateful that Harry trusted him with this.
„We're here because of you Malfoy, so why are you looking at me like that! What were you doing up there, huh!? If I hadn't stopped you, would Dumbledore be dead by now? Is that what you want? It can't be Malfoy, it can't be...“
An unpleasant thought crept his way into Harrys head. Could it be possible for Draco to be wanting to be found by Death Eaters?
„That was good“ Harry said happily, the fish was big enough to fill both of their stomachs and Malfoy managed to make it taste marvelously.
The food was actually pretty good. When they finished everything there was a weird silence. Like none of them knew what to say.
Quite satisfied with the little cabin he created he put his wand away and started collecting some moss to stuff out the ground inside.
„If you had payed more attention to Hagrid in class you’d know that thestrals actually can feed off both meat and plants just like us. Shadowfax just seems to prefer grass over meat. Which I would say could count as an advantage seeing you two don’t get along all that nicely yet“, Harry grinned.
„Accio wood!“ he said and a pile of dry wood came to rest in front of them. He used Incendio to light a fire and Draco took charge of preparing a decent breakfast.
Tonight the Boy Who Lived had dreams filled with a heard of wild thestrals roaming through the night sky while a hint of rose petals and green apples filled his mind.
„No, I didn't fucking want to kill him. But I… I had to. I mean… I have to. You can’t understand. Nobody could ever understand.“ The last part came out shaky.
„Don’t take it personal“, Harry addressed Shadowfax „He’s just not a big fan of any magical creature bigger than a house elf.“
This time Dracos head moved up a little so Harry could see his face. His eyes were looking up at Harry wide and confused and... they were red from tears. Harry thought he must have imagined Draco crying when they fled the tower, he thought his brain played a trick on him. But there was no denying it now. Dracos expression made Harrys anger crumble and when he didn't say anything suddenly Harry didn't know what to say either.
Dracos tone was angry but when he saw Harrys embarrassed face he couldn’t help but to smile a little when he pulled his zipper up and turned around to face Harry.
„Let’s just look for some food for now, I’m starving.“, Harry suggested and Dracos empty stomach didn’t seem to protest.
Draco couldn’t stop himself from acknowledging Harrys defined backside. His spine shone threw the skin but his shoulderblades seemed wide and strong, his hip small and delicate. Draco couldn’t stop himself from blushing, why did he even bother?
Harry couldn’t help but realize that nothing of this situation made him think about defending himself. A part of him trusted Draco not to hurt him, even if he was physically able to. So Harry just lay there, waiting for Dracos actions to lead to the point.
With that the thestral strode towards the water to drink and roam around feeding on grass again after.
Harry couldn’t explain why his body reacted the way it did but he slung his arms around Draco again, holding him to his chest.
Now Harry was the one to burry his face in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief of this whole terrible situation.
„Do you think we should go back to Hogwarts?“ Harry asked Draco. He could see the blonde boys face go pale, his eyes indicating discomfort.
What a pathetic little pile of creatures they had to look like, Harry was thinking. To his displeasure Draco still didn’t stop shaking, now even more annoyingly since his back was almost pressed against Harrys chest. Harry sighed and after a short moment of hesitation he put his upper arm around Draco, drawing him closer.
“Oh no, I’m mad, but I know I shouldn’t be. I can just be a bit dramatic about these sorts of things. It happens more often than you’d think.” He showed Harry a small smile, “I guess that’s just a me-problem.” Cole frowned into his cup, cradling the porcelain for some comfort.
“Why would It be?” Harry questioned, fully aware of why, but he wanted to see what Malfoy’s view on their history was.
The blond made a disgruntled sigh before attempting to move again, within one step he had completely lost his balance, hitting the floor with a loud thud.
“Ah… Hello there – Ginny.” He awkwardly patted her back, scowling at Harry’s amusement from his stiff shoulders.
“Is that all you’ve been hiding.” Harry asked, he could accept Draco for this. It would be hard but, they would work it out. He could see how Malfoy got sucked up into this, and at least he had stopped, all for Harry.
“Surely -the boy who defeated the dark lord- isn’t too scared to say the word prostitute.” Harry felt heat rise to his cheeks at his lack of maturity. He pretended that Malfoy’s words had no impact on him.
But thank you for reading (I always say this but I mean it) you lovely people and please leave a comment if you can. I like knowing peoples reactions :)
He wiped it quickly, swallowed the lump in his throat and pretended it hadn’t happened. Then it’s twin fell from the other eye just as quickly. His hands caught it, not letting the water last in the air for even a moment. But then another fell, and another, and another until his hands couldn’t possibly catch them all at once.
“I’m not a prostitute Harry,” Malfoy revealed, ploughing his face deep in his hands “and I never have been.”
He had already had about three men proposition him whilst he was here, all of which he had declined with a polite ‘No thank you’. But now Harry had kind of wished he had accepted, just so he wouldn’t be sat here now like a lost puppy.
“It’s just, maybe you need to, maybe, get a job, do something new.” Hermione suggested. Harry could see the silent signals between Ron and Hermione. They didn’t want Harry there anymore.
Was it weird for Harry to be watching? What if Malfoy saw that Harry was watching? Would he stop? Harry tried to pull his head away, he really did, but his whole body screamed at him to look back after he pried his eyes away for half a second. The smart thing to do at this time would be to stand up and walk away. But, Harry never was very smart, was he?
Harry went back up the staircase and began the search around his house. He double checked the kitchen.
“Hi there, Ginny.” Harry laughed, tying his arms around her neck. Draco hated the pang of jealousy that rang through him.
A sudden chill ran up his spine, he was freezing. He quickly realised that his chest was bare, he moved his hands in an attempt to warm himself, only to find that they were being constricted back by something.
The sky was dark as coal by the time the two left the skate rink, a waft of cold air chilling them to their bones.
“What is it?” Harry asked, looking down the man’s hand, where he saw a nasty looking, blistered burn running across his palm. “Oh Merlin, that doesn’t look good.”
He tightened his fist over one of the glasses and lifted it to his eyes, seeing a label with scribbles written on it. He could hardly read It in the dark light, he squinted until he could finally decipher the name.
“I dare Toby and Anabelle to go into the closet for seven minutes.” She dared, leaving two people in the circle to sport fiery blushes.
. He would start a painting business and sell his work, maybe even get the occasional commission. Draco would work in the lab downstairs, inventing new cures and potions - they would move in together. Domestic mornings, endless nights, trivial arguments, breakfast in bed. Maybe they would even adopt a child, a long way down the line, eventually grow old together.
Harry had spent the entire morning at the cottage. Things had been going slower without Hermione there, but he’d managed. He was amazed by how much of a short notice the masonry worker had come around and evaluated the walls, but that probably came down to Harry being an ‘important client’. Apparently, they were safe enough in structure to live in and were unlikely to collapse. The man even gave Harry a number to contact for cleaners that specialise in black mould.
“You sure you wanna do this?”  Harry asked, pulling away from Draco and looking at him in a way that made him want to melt.
“Another date! Already?” Draco turned to face Harry, flipping the bacon. “Were you already planning for this one to go badly?”
He went back to his table and sat the Prophet down in the centre. He didn’t have the paper delivered, he hated reading it. Someone had to of sent it to Harry.
However, when their eyes met, the only acknowledgment Harry got was a bite of his bottom lip before Malfoy averted his eyes.
If Ginny knew he was talking about Malfoy, Harry was sure she would be telling him that he was insane for even stepping near the git, let alone dating him.
Harry pulled some ice cubes from his fridge and wrapped them with a tea towel. “Hold this on your hand for a few minutes.
“I don’t know Harry, it’s just an alleyway…” She paused, aiming her squint at the paper even more intensely. “Ah, wait a minute.” She jumped up from the sofa and began poking through the draws and under the coffee table. “Here it is!” She exclaimed, pulling out another copy of the daily prophet from underneath the coffee table before chucking it in Harry’s direction.
“That’s… really cool.” He bent over Harry to get a better view; Harry could feel the warmth radiating from his skin along with the scent of woody cologne.
Harry moved down into the seat opposite his desk. Draco placed his half eaten croissant back on the table, placing his right hand on the neck of the guitar.
Draco blushed at the thought. Was he really going to do this with Harry? His heart filled with excitement instead of the cold it had felt just a second ago. There was no hiding anymore.
Draco stared and stared. Harry shirtless was a breath taking thing : tan, smooth skin covering defined angles and powerful muscles.
“They really are, since learning to cut hair, I’ve actually managed to tame mine.” Draco glanced up to Harry’s head of hair.
Once Malfoy was all the way back to his tip, he pushed back in, filling Harry up again, this time, the pleasure hit Harry tenfold. “Merlin.” He mumbled, letting a wave of pleasure crash over him as Malfoy thrusted deep inside.
“Really.” Hermione couldn’t help but roll her eyes. “They’re less volatile with reactants and therefore will give you less trouble. But, if you want to take up potion brewing anytime soon, there’s always a chance for planting magical plants.”
He’d just wanked, in front of his roommate’s door. Whilst he had fantasised about his roommate fucking him.
Harry’s hands moved to cover Draco’s, stopping him. He cupped Draco’s jaw in his palm and kisses him softly. Yet it would never quite qualify as chaste. His tongue slips in and out of Draco’s mouth – slow and deliberate – until Draco is practically trembling above him.
Mia quickly scurried to the other side and attempted to lift it. The two of them let out a loud groan at the weight and immediately dropped it down to the ground.
Draco looked just as vulnerable as Harry felt in that moment. He took three steps closer to Harry and turned to sit next to him on the bed.
This was exactly what Harry didn’t want to happen. He didn’t want – or need – to kiss Malfoy. This was the worst outcome he could have possibly imagined. Harry really wished he had put his clothes back on after he’d stripped, if only his Gryffindor pride wasn’t so big.
Luckily, Draco had been learning how to cast the spell wandlessly. The idea of learning it made his head fill with heat, but he’d spent so much time recently learning about the ins and outs of the male anatomy that he’d gotten fed up with needing to grab his wand every time he’d wanted to shove his fingers up his arse.
“Probably nothing to worry about.” Harry turned back to the client’s head only to be interrupted once again when a yellow beam shot out from across the street.
So, there he laid, with his lover’s arms embracing him, a blushed hue on his face and a knowing smile that maybe everything was going to be okay.
“Talk about what?” Draco played innocent, deciding to scoop the left-over oatmeal around his plate into different patterns and shapes.
Draco couldn’t believe this was going to be his first time with a man, here with Harry Potter, in their small apartment complex, on a bed that had definitely been well worn, but it was all Draco had ever wanted. It was perfect.
Harry gasped, parting his lips, Draco took advantage of the opportunity and pressed his tongue inside, stroking and sliding and plunging, until Harry’s head flew, making him grab onto the armrest behind him.
“If you didn’t realise that was a ploy to make you sleep with me, you’re thicker than I thought.” Malfoy sassed, looking up from his hands, revealing sour, red eyes. Of course, Malfoy would always resort back to playground insults the second he felt guilty.
“Here.” Catherine rolled an empty beer bottle into the centre of the circle. “Time for spin the bottle.”
She had a light covering of fine ginger hair over her head, which looked as soft as a cloud and slightly damp. Once she opened her eyes however, Harry was almost punched with the striking shade of blue. A warm shade of water around her pupils, brimming over with personality and promise despite the fact that she’d only been alive for minutes.
“Even after you left.” Harry continued, this time Draco didn’t reply, instead choosing to neck down the entire glass of water. “Speaking of which… What did you do after you left?”
He felt the same trepidation in his stomach as he had months ago, when he was last facing Draco’s door like this, debating how hard he should knock.
Draco panicked as he pulled himself up from the ground, his legs silently wobbling beneath him in objection.
They lay there in complete silence for a few minutes, listening to the sound of each other’s breath.
“I’m- I – Sorry… I didn’t know you had someone-” Draco spluttered, trying to pick himself up from the floor to grab onto the door handle, but his legs were weak.
Maybe if he acknowledged what had happened and spoke to Harry about it, all of the awkwardness would sink away. Harry was always forgiving (sometimes too forgiving), he remembered how he’d forgiven him after the war, and surely a simple, little crush was a far easier thing to forgive.
“You’re an utter twat, that’s what you are!” She shouted out reaching for another object to throw at Harry. He didn’t even really know how he’d ended up in this position, Hermione was angry when he’d first come home but after telling her about the house, it was like he’d ignited a bomb.
He’d hoped that he would fall asleep quickly, into a comforting lull of dreams, but instead he’d been trapped awake, tossing and turning underneath his bed sheets. He glanced over to his alarm clock.
“Bloody Hell Draco!” Harry cursed, swatting Malfoy’s hands away from himself. “That’s my job.” He smiled.
In truth, Malfoy was right, it did take them less than an hour to set up, but that was mainly because of Malfoy’s, frankly, amazing organising skills. Harry was in awe at how Malfoy could just switch off the surrounding world to complete his task. After fifteen minutes, Harry had decided to just sit on the staircase with a new cup of tea in his hands as he was just slowing Draco down really.
Harry opened his eyes to see the same muddy owl sat on his windowsill, violently pecking away at the glass. Harry had had enough of getting woken up by random owls.
“Quite.” Malfoy smiled, flashing Harry some teeth in the process. Harry practically felt himself swoon.
“I was sure you weren’t going to go through with it.” Malfoy whispered, looking Harry up and down once over. “I can’t bloody believe it.” Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t meant to hear that, so he pretended he hadn’t.
Malfoy’s tongue began to circle the crinkled skin of Harry’s hole, making the rim flutter beneath him. Harry arched his back up into the ceiling as a moan fell from his lips. Draco didn’t stop or slow the torture of his tongue slowly and carefully wrapping around Harry’s hole, circling the skin, but never digging inside.
Malfoy elegantly slipped out of his bench, only to swiftly slide himself onto the other, so that half of his body was pushed up firmly against Harry’s. Harry couldn’t help but revel in the heat radiating off of Malfoy’s body.
Harry thought back to how Malfoy used to act with his mother, they always had had a strange relationship, but it was no different to any other pureblood family.
“Bloody hell, Harry.” Malfoy mumbled, his eyes glazed over as he thrusted his fingers into Harry’s mouth.
They had managed to cut his hair in a way that looked more rugged than straight up messy. Harry thought he would put some gel in his hair anyways, just to tie in the strands that even the spell couldn’t fix.
Then he thought back to the night him and Draco had made love, the look of longing in his eyes, like Harry was the only man in the world. He had treated him so well, never pressuring Harry to do anything.
“I am not a bloody pansy!” Draco was faintly aware that he had the entire shops attention on him now. “I would never sleep with Harry and Merlin knows I would never even come within three feet of you!”
Now that Harry was inside, he grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled the fingers out, deciding to let his tongue do all the work without obstruction. He thrust himself deep into Draco, rolling and curling his tongue until his mouth pressed up against Draco’s arse. Draco wreathed against him, almost pulling away from the intense pleasure.
“Are you just going to knock on the door?” Harry asked, wondering if there were any other procedures to get in the manor.
Alex placed his lips back onto Harry’s, kissing him back with the same unrestrained force, this time moving his hands up to thread through Harry’s hair. Harry tried to kiss back, thinking through every movement his lips made.
“I mean, I’ve never asked.” Harry looked to where Draco had just left the room. “Why? Do you think he’s gay?”
The Gryffindor pushed himself up from the bench and promptly skated onto the rink floor. He’d been skating a ton of times with Ginny, although, he remembered how difficult he had found it when he’d first tried, and how Ginny had watched him flounder about trying to get to the skating floor.
Malfoy’s eyes had dark shadows threaded beneath them, and whilst his eyes were still a striking shade, they had developed from their old neon silver to a deep granite-grey. His skin was paler and Harry was certain he could even see a few pimples bubbling up around his chin and hairline, surrounded by a small amount of blond stubble. Which Harry now realised had been scratching against his neck as he hugged him.
“I would, I need to check it’s big enough.” Malfoy’s eyes shot down to Harry crotch beneath the sheets. “But I’m pretty certain it’ll be big enough for me anyways.”
Harry easily added another finger to Malfoy’s already streched arse and began thrusting the two in and out, unable to look away from how his fingers disapeared and reappeared into the ring. Harry copied Malfoy’s scissoring movement, ignoring the small resistance offered from Malfoy’s hole.
Harry’s body was still rigid but softened into the bed a little more. After a few minutes he heard the lull of Malfoy’s breath slow and deepen. Was he asleep? He must’ve been.
“Bloody Hell.” Harry murmured as he bent down on his knees, scrambling his hand around on the floor to find his glasses. Once his hands were wrapped around the frame, he lifted them up and placed them back on his face.
Without warning, Alex’s lips were on his, a harsh force against him. He kept his own mouth unmoving for a few seconds in shock before Alex pinched the back of his neck and whacked Harry out of the daze he was jammed in.
“Oh my God! Malfoy!” Harry shouted, shock radiating from his body in waves of glee. Malfoy turned around, suddenly cursing a white beam out of his wand directly into Harry’s chest.
He stirred the tea Draco made him. No, he couldn’t. He would either leave here and miss them twice as much as if he’d never met them, or he would end up staying in this timeline and losing them again. He might even do something stupid and change the timeline of the entire universe. His head was thumping.
“Malfoy told me that he used to be a drug dealer. It sounds bad but I didn’t particularly care that he dealt drugs, I was just upset that he didn’t tell me.”
But he felt Draco’s hands begin to fiddle with his belt buckle. The small compression of the belt against Harry’s cock made him almost scream out. He was so sensitive.
Harry looked down at the tent in his trousers, he supposed he could just leave it, pretend it wasn’t there and take a cold shower, but he hadn’t had an actual wank in far longer than a man should abstain from. He hadn’t wanked since the last time he’d had sex, now he thought about it. He had always thought it was sad for a fully grown adult to have to resort to wanking but – why not?
“So…” Harry paused, placing his own tea on the coffee table. He stared down at the ankles on his lap before looking up and meeting Draco’s waiting gaze. “Do you think we could be more than this?” Harry asked, immediately looking away, hiding how anxious the question made him. He held his breath as Draco waited to answer.
The two walked around to the front garden, where they were greeted with two delivery men attempting to haul Harry’s furniture out of a truck.
“Time for breakfast.” Hermione diverted the conversation after the smell of smoke began to fill the room.
Harry lifted them up and Draco slid the cushion below Harry’s arse, leaving Harry at the right angle for Malfoy to enter.
Harry set to the treacherous task of fixing his hair, whilst his black locks were always a mess whenever he woke up, since getting a job at the barbers, he’d managed to learn how to tame it and (in his opinion) it looked pretty darn good now. Who would’ve guessed that muggle hair gels would work miles better than any hair spell he’d ever used?
Harry let his body settle further and emptied his brain, think of random nothings as his body drifted into sleep.
“Don’t worry, I will definitely not be brewing potions anytime soon.” Harry reassured, causing Hermione to flash him an amused smile. Whilst Harry did have immense respect for his old potions teacher, he had managed to make Harry resent even the thought of the subject.
Out of his peripheral vision, Harry saw Malfoy shuffle a wooden glasses case out of his bag, opening the hinges to reveal a pair of thin, wire, golden glasses. Harry snickered at the irony.
“Yes.” Malfoy whispered. Harry moved his thumb to drag over Draco’s bottom lip, amazed by how soft the skin was beneath the hard, calloused plane of his thumb.
“No, they’re too hot and I need to dress them first.” Hermione warned. Harry chuckled as he imagined his stack of pancakes wearing a tiny, little dress. “I’ll go get you the house folder whilst they cool down.”
“Mother.” Draco shouted down the hall. “Where would she be?” He muttered. “Narcissa! Cissy! Mother!”
“Well, what do you want?” He asked, moving his fingers so that they ran in circles around Harry’s chest.
Harry cautiously pushed the door open to see Malfoy still under the sheets, but now with one hand covering his eyes. Harry let out a deep breath and walked over to his wardrobe where he pulled out his usual work clothes. A black shirt and black jeans, and a fresh pair of underwear.
Yesterday, he felt a welcoming presence cast over the whole place, the full dance floor -whilst intimidating- felt inviting and exciting. But now, the club seemed predatory, he could see a whole new world that he hadn’t seen before. Somehow when he was with Ginny, the undertone of lust had completely gone over his head, as if he was wearing rose-coloured glasses. He spared a second to wonder if Ginny had noticed it either.
“What is it-“ Harry started, before looking down into the box. He let out a howl of laughter. “Oh My God! That’s brilliant! Look! We match!” Harry reached into the box and grabbed the fedora before harshly plonking it down on Draco’s head.
“I must say, I hadn’t expected to see you here.” Malfoy informed, his tongue shooting out to wet his lips. Harry’s mind was suddenly filled with inappropriate images of Malfoy dancing against that man last night. He felt his cock twitch and internally groaned. No, he was not going to sit here with a raging hard-on opposite Malfoy.
Then Harry pushed deeper, and deeper again, and once he was fully rested inside Draco, he let out a deep exhale of breath.
“I’m sorry to say that I had never thought of you as anything more than a git, Draco.” Draco chuckled out a strained laugh. “I hadn’t even realised I was gay until about a year ago, I just thought every man could appreciate another man’s perky bum from time to time.” They both smiled at each other. “But maybe I did have a crush on you, and never realised. Thinking about it, I did stalk you like an obsessed fan, didn’t I?”
After that, he had managed to remove the rest of the wallpaper in the house and all the remaining furniture. Meaning that the house now had a pile of chairs and tables stacked up in the garden, slowly melting into the swamp land.
“How very curious.” The man tugged his finger down the page. “I studied a case a bit like yours during my course. It was only a time jump of a week, but it sounds similar.” Lucius expression shifted, “Ah! Here it is…According to this passage it appears the time turner was tampered with. Maybe it was being held as a ticking bomb to time jump someone away. I doubt it was made for the two of you though. I’m almost surprised that you didn’t rip apart the fabric of time itself with such a leap, but anything it possible.”
What if Draco could tell Harry hadn’t ever been with a man before? Would it be obvious? Harry took in a deep breath through his nostrils.
The room they were now in was a carbon copy of a professional potions lab. The grey, concrete walls were lined with stacks of shelves filled with ingredients and bottles of potions. There were four different cauldrons sat of a central table, one of which held a gelatinous purple fluid that was practically bubbling over.
“He deserved it! Could you not see how obviously mentally ill he was? And he had his hands all over you when you came in. Putting his arm over your shoulders like that. What a creep!” Harry chuckled, the air of his breath brushing over Draco’s ear, making him stiffen in place.
“Yes! And even if you don’t get good – which is unlikely – you obviously find drawing entertaining, otherwise you wouldn’t be sketching so much.”
“I’ll see you soon.” Draco backed away, let his arm fall and walked up the stairs, leaving Harry alone. After a few seconds, Harry heard an echo of the front door closing.
There was a moment of silence as the two met eyes and stared at eachother, unsure of what was going to happen next. Malfoy lifted his hand and with a click of his fingers, Harry’s trousers had suddenly evaporated from his body, leaving the cool air to prick at the hair of his legs.
“Don’t worry Harry.” Hermione reassured. “I would go mad if I stayed at home all day. Anyways, it’s all good exercise.”
He showed some teeth through a mischievous smirk before placing his fingers over Harry’s crotch and groping down onto his dick. Harry pushed his hips up and chucked his head back so he was staring at the ceiling. The blond massaged his fingers against Harry and Harry was sure he could come just from this.
“I thought it might be worth going muggle today.” Ginny suggested, pulling out of the hug. “Just so the Daily Prophet doesn’t have a field trip with an article about how were dating again.”
Lily sighed, rolling her eyes, “Men.” She instantaneously went rigid as a knife before letting her shoulders relaxed again. “I’m sorry, this is rude. I haven’t even asked your name yet.”
“That’s Josh, that’s Toby, that’s Anabelle.“ Cole began, pointing to random figures around the room in turn, each of them momentarily turned out of their conversations to wave at Harry upon hearing their names.
She began dragging Harry down the pathway to the front gate, tugging on his arm with all her strength.
“That is an absolute bargain Harry.” She exclaimed, “Those extension charms themselves would’ve cost at least 250,000 galleons to get done.” She stared at the paper in amazement. “How did you even find this house?”
“Here goes nothing.” He closed his eyes and pressed his hand to the gate lock, after a second of silence the gate creaked and shifted, the intricate carvings moulding to slowly open up for Malfoy.
“That’s a great idea Harry, but first, we need to get the house sorted. Do you want to come and see the painting so far?”
Two of them were paintings of Harry’s garden, both far better than Harry’s first painting. Admittedly, the flowers were still a bit off but, they were good enough that perhaps someone would even want to buy them.
“I’ll be back in a minute then.” Harry turned his back to Malfoy and made his way to the door. “After that, we really need to make a start on your lab.” Harry smiled back to Malfoy, who nonchalantly raised his hand and shooed Harry away.
“Um… No thank you.” Harry politely declined, despite how his body was screaming to go and kiss Malfoy again.
“I think we best stick to cereal today.” Draco looked up, meeting Harry’s gaze for the first time that morning. It felt awkward. Harry’s mouth slid into a frown.
He waited for another five seconds before realising that nothing had happened yet. He cautiously peeked out of one eye to see Malfoy, with his lips parted and eyes wide, staring at Harry’s erection.
When the alarm stopped, he almost lost his breath for a few seconds when he saw quite how close Harry was. Draco’s arm dropped down from the alarm to his side, but Harry still remained in place, his eyes looking down to Draco’s nude chest pressed against his.
“And now you’re back. Even letting me take you on a date.” Draco’s smile was wide, eyes disbelieving.
Suddenly, Draco speared his tongue inside Harry, the wet muscle being accepted inside him with little resistance.
Harry felt bad about asking Hermione for help on another of his problems, but he knew that her lack of activity from being pregnant was driving her crazy, so she’d probably accept it happily. So, Harry strolled down to the living room and chucked the paper at her resting body.
He skidded to the room next door until he was face to face with his own door. At which, he ran through the wood and slammed the door behind himself. Flopping down onto his bed.
“You’re gorgeous Harry. Absolutely gorgeous.” Draco stroked Harry’s chest, Harry could see Draco’s eyes drooping slightly. He looked exhausted.
“I suppose you know that he told me he was a prostitute.” Harry revealed, making Cole roll his eyes.
Harry turned and led Malfoy across the road, ignoring the gaggle of confused muggles staring at him.
Harry can’t help it before the words fall from his lips. “I’m such a slut for you Malfoy.” Harry immediately regrets his words, pausing in his actions, but Malfoy lets out an even louder groan than before and begins to meet his slowed thrusts.
One was orange with pinks and reds and oranges and white, it made Harry think of the sunsetting away. The other was a dark blue with more angry paint strikes, like the moon during a hunt. They both made Harry smile and his heart flutter. Although they had no objects in them, they showed Harry’s inner thoughts far more deeply than he could of possibly imagined.
A small smile adorned Draco’s face, whilst warm feeling settled in Harry’s. Suddenly, Draco’s eyes minutely shifted to the right, passed Harry’s head, and a far wider smile lit up his cheeks.
He opened the wood to find Draco standing there in the cold. At first his stomach wooshed up high, still exhilarated by the realisation that he wanted something deeper with Draco, but then it slammed back down when he saw the expression written all over Malfoy’s face.
Harry smiled when Draco’s skates slipped from beneath him, pulling his body away from the bar at a 45 degree angle. He slowly wheeled himself back up.
Malfoy replied with a small nod, he raised one finger to wipe away at his eyes, hoping that Harry wouldn’t notice.
Now he picked up a steely grey, one that swam with hints of blue and splatted again, similarly to the black dots. But this time, instead of random swoops of colour, they somehow looked more like teardrops against the green. On a few of the drops, a black swoop would outline them, resembling dark eyelashes wrapped around cold eyes.
“But that’s beside the fact. What else happened?” Cole probed. Harry felt uncomfortable dissecting his argument with Malfoy whilst having someone else listen in, it felt like a massive invasion of privacy.
“I don’t have to kiss a dude, do I?” The first shouted out, being swiftly followed by mutters of agreement by the second.
“What a shame. It was nice to meet you, Harvey.” James held his hand out to shake, Harry gripped the tough skin with his own. Their hands were exactly the same, from the grubby, thick fingers to the size.
“You should be, so now you’re just going to lie there and let me use you.” Harry felt himself take another sharp breath. He looked up at the ceiling hearing the zipper of Draco’s trousers undo and a soft woof of air as they his the ground. His own erection stirred through his clothes furthur.
“Okay… There’s one more thing.” He tried to reach out for Harry’s hands and this time, Harry let him. “Those potions… in the box. They’re not for selling. I need to chuck them away.” Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
“You were right, Harry. He’s an absolute weirdo!” Draco laughed. Harry had no reaction, instead he was just staring blankly at his hot chocolate. “Really weird! Right, Harry?”
“Well…” Draco paused, shell-shocked. “I suppose, I would probably sleep with you…” Harry’s posture straightened, “But only, if like, I was going to die otherwise.”
Firstly, they walked down some steps in the hallway to the basement. Mia cast a Lumos when they reached the bottom. The room was stained with an eerie, cold silence, the air itself seemed stale. The room must’ve been a good five degrees below the rest of the house, causing Harry’s breaths to occasionally flutter out as white steam. The concrete room had a lot of potential, but Harry couldn’t quite imagine what he could use it for. Maybe he would figure it out after a while.
Kissing Harry was like lighting a fuse. It felt like there was no way back. No way to dampen or lighten the heat. It made him pant against Harry, endlessly searching. It felt like years of frustration slipping away, settling into nothing more than an intense want in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
The bed was so warm when he shared it with Draco. He hadn’t shared a bed with someone in three years, and whilst things with Ginny hadn’t been perfect, sharing a bed had always been Harry’s favourite part of their relationship. The warmth and comfort of having someone next to you, it was the only time where Harry could sleep the whole night.
But then it shot up again, and again. Harry attempted to move slightly to see the face of the bobbing head. It almost appeared as if the crowd had parted specially just to give Harry a view of Malfoy’s face bopping up and down, eyes searching for someone who might be interested. Harry could hardly look away.
It wasn’t anywhere near as good as butterbeer. That was a big claim in itself, however, for a herbal tea. It was
The aftermath however, was not quite so pleasant. All the memories from last night flooded into Harry’s head, and whilst the majority of them made him roaring for a round two – maybe even three. His stomach kept curling in an embarassed scream when he remembered calling himself a whore.
“We haven’t got all day you two!” A voice broke through Harry’s thoughts making him vaguely realise that he was staring intensely at Malfoy’s nose. He raised his eyes to Malfoy’s, only to see that the man was staring directly back.
“You really had me fooled.” Harry tutted his tongue. “At least I haven’t said something I’ll regret.”
They couldn’t look away from each other, neither wanting to break the closeness of their stare, even as Malfoy’s thrusts began to speed up inside Harry, they were still slow. Not in a rush to get anywhere, no final destination, they were instead savouring, savouring every second as if it would be their last.
“Blow job, Malfoy.” Harry stuttered out, hardly able to breath. He hadn’t even gotten his dick out and this was easily the best sex he’d ever had, he was already practically falling apart. It wasn’t even real for merlin’s sake.
Harry much preferred the role of a seeker. He loved watching them during a match, they were always the deciding factor of a win or a loss, chasers always had lower stakes. Therefore, he loved the risk of playing seeker, but he wasn’t going to pet Draco’s ego with that information.
“Oh indeed.” She began. The kettle steamed up with a loud hoot, she picked it up and emptied the hot water into the cups. “I would’ve figured it out anyways, despite the fact you two reek of sex, you both also walked in well presented -albeit dirty- and left looking like there was a troll attack. I’m not completely stupid you see.” She finished making the tea and passed one to Harry, who couldn’t even make eye contact with her. “Oh Harry, don’t be like that, it’s okay.”
So, he poured out his new set of paints, and he’d be lying if he said that he didn’t have Malfoy on his mind the whole time he was painting.
He debated waking up and going to the kitchen, to show Harry how to cook bacon for the fiftieth time that year or casting a silencing spell on his door and burning to death.
For some reason, Harry’s stomach tied itself in knots at the statement. Draco had remembered Harry’s favourite dessert. It was probably because he hated him. That was probably it.
The day had been almost too perfect thus far; he’d woken up on time, managed to not burn his toast, had made an extraordinarily good cup of coffee (good for instant coffee anyways), arrived to work well dressed and in a good mood, been greeted by his secretary with a perfectly buttered croissant, and to top it all off, the weather was satisfyingly warm with not a cloud in sight.
The bodies were sweaty and made Harry feel slightly claustrophobic, steam seeming to form in the air from all the people.
His lips pouted once again when his biscuit crumbled into his tea, getting lost to turn to mush in the hot depth.
Draco shrugged before rolling out of bed, mildly surprised when his legs didn’t get caught in the bedsheets like they did every morning. Perhaps Harry’s functional bedsheets were superior to Draco’s flashy silk. He glanced down at the red once again
He lifted the Daily Prophet up to his face. “Oh My Merlin.” Cole whispered; his face drained white. He folded the paper over under his arm and stumbled back to the table.
All he had managed to achieve from this visit was the conclusion that Draco Malfoy was a very strange man indeed.
“Yes of course.” Harry shoved the spoonful of tart into his mouth and moaned at the taste. It tasted just like the one he used to have back at Hogwarts. “This is amazing.” HE explained to Malfoy, who was slowly picking away at his obscenely large waffle.
“Oliver Wood!” He heard himself exclaim, his momentary proudness at his brain storm was soon quelled when he saw Ginny’s reaction. She simply rolled her eyes and said:
“I kept him out of the limelight, I didn’t want him to be associated with me. I didn’t want him to be hated just because of his father.” Harry frowned at the reality of it. He’d lived as a hero ever since the war, he couldn’t imagine what Malfoy had to deal with after fighting for the dark side.
Catherine’s palm suddenly shot out and shoved Harry forward, so that he was pushed up onto his knees.
“That’s exactly what I mean Potter.” Malfoy pushed his lips against Harry’s neck and began to softly nibble at the skin.
“Good.” Draco huffed in relief before turning around and leaving the office, shutting the door behind him.
But as they reached the metallic door, a certain redhead appeared on the other side, shock written all over her face. Malfoy quickly turned a sneer towards Ginny as they appeared to share a brief few words. Ginny’s face slowly morphed into an angry red as she shouted something in Malfoy’s direction and then stomped over the floor to the table.
Harry decided to prepare their camp for tonight. He chose a place a few meters away from the river, just under a huge tree. He summoned some wood and branches and busied himself building a little cabin, just like yesterday. It was again around three meters high and roughly large enough to fit the three of them inside. This time though Harry put in the effort of disguising the cabin a little, putting some delusion charms over it so it wouldn’t be as visible and obvious as the last one. When he was confident about the cabin he prepared the firewood in front of it for later.
Before Harry could react they had already reached the riverside and the thestral stopped and bowed down again for them to slide off his back. Draco rather fell off instead, towing Harry along.
So Harry just sat there. In front of his supposed enemy. In front of his known arch nemesis in fact. In front of Malfoy. In front of Draco? He'd never seen the blonde arrogant and proud Slytherin like this. Somehow broken and vulnerable. His skin look even more pale than Harry remembered and his normally ridiculously neat hair was standing up in all kinds of directions in a way that almost could be called curly. Wait, why was he, Harry, even looking at Malfoy? What did he care if Malfoys hair curled? Just like an hour ago Draco was threatening Dumbledores life and Harry was sure if he hadn't done something to stop him Draco would have attempted to kill the headmaster. What Harry didn't know the answer to was as to why exactly Draco would do something so terrible and stupid. Sure, Harry knew Draco disrespected Dumbledore for accepting muggleborns at Hogwarts, sure, Draco was on the everlasting mission to earn his fathers respect, but would even Lucius Malfoy go as far as ordering his own son to commit murder? No, it must be something else. After keeping a close eye on Malfoy over the past few months Harry had his suspicions. Suspicions that Malfoy was aiming to become a Death Eater and serve Voldemort. But todays events just now made it real. Draco must have already committed to serving the Dark Lord truely. But then why was he crying? Why wasn't he fighting Harry for interfering his mission, why didn't he do something instead of letting himself just be dragged along by Harry? Harry had no answer to that just yet. And he couldn't let himself think about it anymore, he could be glad he didn't have to deal with a fighting Malfoy, right now he had more important things at hand. Understanding Malfoy would have to wait.
And with that Harry got up on his feet walking towards the place where Shadowfax laid. He wanted to thank the Thestral for rescuing them but since he was still snoring Harry decided he didn’t want to wake him up again.
Malfoy rubbed his hands over his eyes, frowning as he took them away. Only now he seemed to remember where he was. He looked up at the thestral, who appeared to be a good 2 meters tall now in full lighting, wings not included. Dracos eyes went a bit wide and he quickly made an escape through the entry of the cabin.
„Anyways, Potter, here, do with it what you will“, Draco said and pointed towards a considerable amount of what appeared to be wild raspberries and a pile of apples.
Everyones eyes grew wide in surprise and shock. And in Dracos case; fear. Sheer and utter fear was radiating off of him.
„If okay includes my thighs and arse hurting like crazy then yes, I’m okay, Potter, thanks for asking“ the blonde boy snapped.
After Draco stared at him for a few seconds with a pale face he eventually started maneuvering himself to sit up properly on the thestrals rear back. When Harry felt that Draco wasn’t supporting his weight on him anymore he now somehow managed to get up himself, having to put his back towards Draco, in favor of seeing where the thestral was headed. He leaned forward and whispered into the thestrals ear that it should keep flying north over the forests. As the thestral reared up a bit in agreement, Draco gripped Harrys sides in terror.
Just when Harry thought he might have pulled them to fall to their death their tumbling came to an abrupt halt when they landed roughly on some enormous moving object. Once Harrys eyes were able to focus on what was happening he realized that a huge thestral just caught them on its back.
Shadowfax must have noticed Harry shaking against him because he let out an unamused yawn, turning his head towards the two freezing boys, his white eyes glowing scarily in the dark. The thestral sighed, closed his eyes again and rested his head back on the ground while spreading one of his wings over both Draco and Harry just like a thick black leathery blanket.
So Draco wasn’t cold, not really. He was shaking because he was sorry for what he had been about to do, for all the things he had done already. Harry couldn’t help but to grip Draco a bit tighter.
„It’s your lucky day then I assume, it’s not like I could actually go anywhere even if I wanted to. We’re in a forest in the middle of goddamn nowhere and I don’t even have my wand.“
Harry didn’t let himself consider Malfoys words, instead he said: „Doesn’t really matter now. We should prepare something to spend the night, it will get freezingly cold soon, and I’m not interested in waking up dead tomorrow.“
So the only thing Harry Potter could do was to stare. To stare and wait for Draco Malfoy to speak the words - the words that would undoubtedly enable his shaking wand to end Albus Dumbledores life.
Draco was watching everything with amusement, while Shadowfax seemed a little annoyed by Harry disturbing the silence with his attempts to catch the fish with his stick. The large thestral stood next to Harry, fixated the surface of the water for a bit before his head shot down coming up with a huge fish in his mouth. He let the fish fall onto dry ground and walked away to look for fresh grass again.
Harry was already as close as possible to the thestral so if Draco wanted their warmth he needed to get closer himself.
„So… - what’s your damn plan now savior? Are we going to ride into the bloody sunset with that nasty Pegasus of yours?“
Harry growled a bit but moved so he was laying closer to Shadowfax so Draco could lie down next to Harry if he wanted to. The next thing he felt was Dracos arm accidentally brushing against his back as the blonde boy lay down next to him. Harry had his back towards Draco, his eyes towards Shadowfax who was still snoring peacefully. Draco must have been laying on his back facing the ceiling of branches above them.
To hell with this, Harry thought as he summoned all of the magic inside of him to break the body binding spell that the headmaster put on him just seconds ago. He felt his energy built up until suddenly it broke free and he was able to move agw. Immediately he pulled off his invisibility cloak and stormed out of the shadow.
Harry never thought that there‘d be a day when he’d be thankful for having a creature sleeping next to him that looked like a dying horse with wings attached to it but there it was. He didn’t want to risk waking Shadowfax so he went outside to call Draco and took a few steps until he realized Malfoy wasn’t there anymore.
Harry felt so well rested that he almost couldn’t believe what happened yesterday on the astronomy tower. He hadn’t slept that good in ages, not a single nightmare disturbing his dreams.
One of said problems was the fact that they were out in the wild on their own, the sun long gone, with nothing to help them but Harrys wand and Shadowfax the thestral (who was already snoring loudly from under the tree).
Harry found himself stuck in between the thestrals moving back and Dracos full weight laying on top of him. At some point during their fall Draco must have reached for Harrys arms, because now he had a death grip on them, as the thestral was flying them away from the battleground.
Harry turned his head around in anger: „If you dare say one more word, Malfoy, I'll push you down myself.“
Shadowfax answered with another encouraging neigh, so Harry climbed on his back. Immediately the thestral walked towards Draco whose eyes widened again seeing Harry sit on the huge thestral.
„Would you please try to stop shivering so hard? I can’t sleep like that“ Harry grumbled against Dracos neck.
Draco realized in horror that he must have lost his wand during their fall, or maybe he dropped it when he saw Harry appear next to Dumbledore. It was only now that anger washed over Draco. Of course it was stupid Potter to ruin his task for him. Stupid Potter who stopped him from killing Dumbledore. Stupid Potter making him lose his wand. Stupid Potter who gave him an escape from doing what he was more afraid of than anything ever before...
So this is for the two kind souls who commented on the first chapter of the story, I hope you will enjoy the second one as well :) I'm sorry it took me so long until I found the courage to upload it.
A weight dropped against his shoulder when Draco let his head rest against him and Harry could feel that he boy was shaking although he wasn’t sure if it was because he was afraid, cold or something entirely different. Then he felt the other boy sobbing. Harry tried to remain breathing steadily. This was Malfoy, he reminded himself. Malfoy crying had to be just another one of his tricks and manipulations. Harry mustn't let himself be fooled into feeling actual sympathy for Draco, let alone trying to find out what the hell was wrong with him, or stop him from bloody crying on his shoulder.
Harry was woken up by bright rays of sunshine breaking through the roof. He blinked a few times to adjust his eyes to the sudden brightness. When he could see clearly again he noticed that Draco was still sound asleep in the same position as when he driftet into sleep last night. By carefully lifting Dracos head off his chest, trying not to wake the blonde boy just yet, Harry attempted to get up. Doing so he accidentally nodged his elbow into Shadowfax‘ side who blinked awake and turned his head to Harry, his remarkable white eyes looking at him somehow deeply. The huge thestral withdrew his wing from both of the wizards, folding it back up. Harry managed to sit up on his knees without waking Draco who still slept sincerely.
„I spent some more time with the thestrals than the others in class. After Sirius died I felt like they were the only ones to understand me so I visited them regularly during fith year and they took me on rides through the forbidden forest.“
Harry turned around to get more comfortable, him being the one laying on his back facing the ceiling now.
He heard Draco take in a sharp breath, breathing in and out deeply for a few times before he answered;
„His name is Shadowfax“, Harry said „And you’d be better off being nice to him. He doesn’t seem to be handling your insults as calm as I do.“
Draco got up groaning, „I can’t even move, Potter, my arse fucking hurts.“ With that he heaved himself next to the cabin and sat down again. „Fish would be nice.“
Draco shouldn’t, he told himself. He should keep the rest of his dignity and resist basically cuddling up to his enemy and his pet.
Harrys attention returned to Draco who stopped purging by now but still looked a little bit green in the face.
„If you payed a little more attention in potions, Potter, you’d know what to look out for“, Draco said proudly.
Draco hadn’t even finished the sneering question when Shadowfax lifted his front hooves up, rearing towards Draco. With his mouth open Draco fell on his butt into the grass next to Harry.
Draco wasn’t noticeably moving anymore and his breath was steady meaning he was probably sleeping already. His body felt decently warm now so Harry could surely take his arm away from him.
Without waiting for Dracos reaction he entered the cabin, which was padded out once again with soft moss. Harry briefly considered choosing the other side of the small room to lay down just to see if Malfoy would have it in him to lay next to Shadowfax. The thought put a smile on Harrys lips but he decided against it, not wanting to be woken up by a screaming Draco because he had a nightmare about being eaten by a thestral. It appeared Shadowfax was already fast asleep when Harry made himself comfortable next to him.
Just when Dumbledore made a move to cover Harry up behind him the boy jumped forward to grip Draco by his collar. Harrys eyes daggered into Dracos - acid green staring into stormy gray. He made use of all the built up adrenaline in his body and pulled Draco towards the edge of the tower. Just when a warning „Potter...!“ escaped Dracos lips Harry tightened his grip on him with both of his hands. The Boy Who Lived furrowed his eyebrows in full concentration and drew both himself and Malfoy over the edge.
“Do you want a hand job? Blow job?” Malfoy asked, running his fingers down Harry until they were slightly below Harry’s balls. “Finger you?” Harry felt a shiver run over him as Malfoy pressed his thumb against Harry’s hole. Fuck.
So, this is the introduction, it is far shorter than a normal chapter so don't worry, upcoming updates are far more substantial.
After this the three set to unpacking everything, setting up chairs and sofas and blankets and tables and counters and kettles and beds and cabinets. The cottage finally appeared to be coming together, and Harry couldn’t be happier.
Harry didn’t know how long it went on, it was like he’d flown to cloud nine, never to come back. His mind blurred with nothing but Draco’s skin rippling each time Harry’s pelvis hit his deep red arsecheeks and how Draco’s legs had somehow ended up being wrapped around his own head.
“Draco. What a pre’ty name. To go with such a pre’ty face.” Draco already felt creepy shivers running up his spine. “Per’aps I could join you two one day?” He propositioned, pulling his hand away and back into his pocket.
Harry hadn’t realised that he’d been crying, whether he’d been crying since he’d taken the painting down or if it had only just started, he had no clue.
“We can when the delivery men leave, anyways, muggle furniture is made better. Magic furniture is just… weird.” Harry explained, peeling away some of the sofa’s cover-up to marvel at the grey plaid fabric underneath.
Harry looked down to his crossed legs, very aware of the now prominent erection pushing against the fabric of his jeans. Harry made a groan of discomfort, not wanting to expose himself in such a way to Malfoy.
A cold chill ran over his body without warning when a memory flashed into his mind. He remembered how he’d jacked off in front of that door (which was enough to make his hands shake) but he was more worried about what he couldn’t remember. He never remembered cleaning up his spunk from the floor, but when Draco looked at the wooden floor now, there was no sign of the white liquid.
He kicked a small stone along as he walked, it jumped across each of the pavestones one at a time with Harry, turning into a game of endless push and shove. But somehow, the small pebble could bring his mind away from Cole and his stupid revelations, that all made Harry think that maybe Malfoy wasn’t that bad.
Harry moved his hands to slip underneath the hem of Draco’s shirt and ran them up his cut stomach almost whimpering at the feeling of Malfoy’s hard skin below his fingertips.
“Why were you outside anyways?” Harry asked to which Draco turned around to show Harry a box filled with some form of pastries.
“Don’t worry, it’s not important.” He concluded, deciding to give up on the idea. Malfoy would surely think it was ridiculous.
Harry chuckled this time, before his face fell focused. Draco felt one of his fingers push against his entrance, putting pressure on the skin, not entering it just yet.
The sudden wet, hotness of Draco’s mouth made Harry’s eyes roll to the back of his head, pleasure running down Harry’s stomach into his crotch then down to his toes in endless waves.
He bent down to pick it up, rolling the thick paper in his hand until he saw the front, where, in cursive, neat writing was his name.
“Im going to make you cum so hard.” Malfoy absentmindedly rambled, stroking his hand up to the tip of Harry’s cock and back down. “Then you’ll fuck me… yeah, would you like that Potter?”
At this, every sensation grew, making Harry feel like he was only an inch from death as Draco kissed him until they were both just moaning into each other’s mouths, then the edge of his orgasm grew close, only seconds away.
“Wash that toothpaste out of your mouth, Ron! That’s disgusting!” She scolded, batting her spatula angrily in his direction.
After all, Hermione and Ron were about to have a baby. They were going to be a family. They didn’t need Harry to be slouching around on their couch every single day, they needed to be on their own.
“I mean… Look, Draco, I have lived with you for two years now.” Harry began, in a hushed tone, “And I’m sorry to tell you this, but you’re not straight. You like
He would take his shoes off as soon as he got into the house to avoid any awkward shoe removal moments. What if his jeans got stuck around his ankles? No, they definitely wouldn’t, he’d been careful to pick a pair that would never get stuck.
Harry closed his eyes when a twinge of pain echoed through his body, but it was numbed within a few seconds as Malfoy paused. Harry opened his eyes again and was almost punched when he looked up to see Malfoy’s expression.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Draco.” Harry cursed, before bending down against Draco until his own face was level to Draco’s arsehole, his eyes watching from an inch away.
“You would think that you would’ve retained perhaps even a gram of what I’ve taught you over all this time.” Draco continued, grabbing a new frying pan from the cupboard and turning the heat up.  “But alas, your utter stupidity amazes me, even after two years of living with you.” When he popped the pan down on the stove, he felt the hard length of Harry’s thigh pressed lightly up against his.
“Of course.” Harry presented his arm, revelling in the warmth of Draco’s touch as their arms interlocked.
“Are you really still doing that puzzle?” Hermione quipped, her eyes momenterily flickering away from an egg that was sizzling on the stove. “I mean, it’s been at least a week Harry.”
Draco began to rock his hands up and down Harry, from base to tip, occasionally stopping to run his thumb over his slit. Which made Harry let out a small whimper every time, the sensation having almost too much pleasure.
Malfoy cautiously popped his head out of the bathroom, Harry faced him and waved down at his now dressed body.
The blond paused next to one of Harry’s nipples before tweaking the nib, Harry bit down on his lip to stop his moan.
Harry let out little gasps every time Draco thrusted his finger in and out, repeating the motion until he decided Harry was ready for a second finger. This finger was harder to get in, but Harry closed his eyes and willed himself to relax. Suddenly, the second finger slid in just as easily as the first.
Within half a second, Draco was transported into the floo at the Weasley’s, with Harry stood only a metre away in front of him, one hand jutted forward for Draco to accept. Draco accepted gracefully and stepped out (not so gracefully), laughing when he spotted a small streak of soot on Harry’s cheek.
“Dobby, I would like to request the presence of Lucius Malfoy.” Draco calmly asked, ignoring Harry’s bewildered state.
“Fine, he can do it. As long as I don’t remember meeting you. You’ll have to do it to Narcissa as well.”
“How did I know?” She continued, finishing Harry’s question for him. “Whilst I did tell you that the basement is soundproof, I meant it is for normal activity levels and bangs, not for moans that hit the same amount of decibals as a nuclear blast.”
. In reality he knew that his filter always threw itself out of an eight story building around Harry. Especially around a completely naked Harry.
Maybe it wasn’t too bad. He still cringed upon seeing Draco’s tear stained shirt, but hopefully Draco would let Harry forget all about this night. They’d never have to talk about it again.
Harry was pretty happy with whoever he had polyjuiced into. He’d even congratulated Ginny on her pick. He was definitely more attractive than Harry. He was about half a foot taller and had lean muscle instead of Harry’s chunky muscle. His hair was the same shade as Harry’s but it was far more manageable, feeling silky in his hands and quickly settling into an effortless style that would take Harry at least two hours to recreate.
Without warning, Harry aligned himself to Draco and slammed his cock inside, immediately filling Draco up all the way to Harry’s hips.
“I said, bullshit.” Cole began. “Malfoy set the lab up in his house to be absolutely pristine perfect, there’s no chance it would break.”
Draco settled into the covers further until after a few minutes, Harry could hear the comforting drawl of small snores.
Harry had to cast his eyes away as Draco did, an overwhelming tingle in his low stomach built up at the sight of Draco’s red lips wrapped around the spoon.
“Oh my god, Malfoy, if I say we can go out for a drink tonight will you leave me alone?” A gleeful expression suddenly rode all over Malfoy’s body as his posture shot up straight and he bounced back from the door.
“My father used to own a time-turner, he spent a few years studying them, I’m sure if we found him then he could help us.”
Harry thought back to Cole’s party when he embarrasingly had to admit that he wanted to sleep with Malfoy.
“He’s brilliant.” Draco began, “Pansy says he’s a little version of me – just without being as spoiled.” He laughed, “I really miss him.”
Draco chose to ignore Harry’s sub-par cooking skills and instead settled on quizzing Andy, who was now sat opposite Draco.
“Where am I going to stay?” Draco asked. “Can I stay here, in the Manor? I know you have enough rooms.”
Malfoy’s fingers slowly began to slither down to the hem of Harry’s shirt before slipping under the fabric and caressing Harry’s chest. Harry wanted to scream at Draco to hurry up, but something about the foreplay amplified every sound in Harry’s thoughts, making speaking impossible.
Harry swallowed his pride and followed her into the kitchen. Her back was facing him and she was putting two teabags in two new cups.
“Malfoy.” Harry whispered, running a finger along the man’s arm. He was offered a small, sleepy snore in response.
Harry handed over a ten pound note, told him to keep the change and picked up his drinks to practically run away from the bar.
Harry let out a loud huff of air and stopped kicking the pebble. He was acting like a child. At least he was almost home. He should probably cut the bushes again; they hadn’t been cut since yesterday.
“Okay, fine!” Draco finally looked up from the guitar to meet Harry’s eyes. He unwrapped the croissant and took a small bite, Harry pretended not to notice the oily residue left on Draco’s lips. Or the way Draco’s tongue slipped out of his mouth the lick it up, or the way that- “Well, being the irresistible gay man that I am, I managed to pick up a super hot band guy from the club last night-“
“What the fuck was that, Potter!” Malfoy screeched stomping over to Harry and pointing his wand at the man’s face. “What did you just do?”
After a particularly strong hit to his prostate, Draco chucked his head back and closed his eyes. Something about doing this in front of Harry made the feeling ten times more pleasurable than normal. Draco had gotten into the groove of his thrusts, so he was hit with surprise when he felt the warm, strong sensation of Harry’s tongue flicker against his hole.
Now he wasn’t even sure he had a plan. His only plan was Malfoy, not that he’d ever thought about them having a family consciously, but in the back of his mind, the thought had settled, even if they had only been together for a short time.
“Here you go Draco, Earl Grey and a peach tart.” Cole brought over Malfoy’s food, knowing his order without having to ask. Malfoy flashed Cole a large, genuine smile, one that brought a small flutter of butterflies to buzz in Harry’s stomach.
“Oh, sorry,” He apoligised, “read this, I’ll be back in a sec.” Ron chucked the Daily prophet in front of Harry before swiftly sprinting out of the door. Harry felt Hermione’s body move to linger over his in curiousity.
Draco felt so full. Merlin… Harry was so deep inside him and Draco wasn’t sure he could cope with the sensation. It wasn’t that it hurt, exactly. It’s just that nothing – not even shoving his fingers up his arse – could prepare him for the feeling of letting another man do something so shockingly intimate to him. He felt so vulnerable that it almost overwhelmed him.
“I have someone really cool for you guys to meet!” Cole continued, turning his voice to a lower volume. “And we’re kind of a thing so make a good impression.”
“Trim it down into the same style, just more defined.” Harry nodded and picked up his scissors, grabbing a section of the man’s hair, when he noticed a single fluorescent earring in his left ear.
Harry moved himself between Draco’s legs and aligned his dick just in front of Draco’s loose, shiny hole. He looked up to Draco’s face to see the man staring down at where their two bodies were about to meet. He whispered a small charm and Harry’s cock was liberally coated in a new layer of lube.
All he knew was that eventually his hand wrapped itself around Draco’s cock, pumping with the same rhythm of his hips, his orgasm close approaching.
Hermione was half asleep being checked by a mid-wife on the couch, her skin was so pale it almost looked see through with dark grey circles formed beneath her eyes. Ron was sat on the arm of the sofa and was rubbing his thumb over Hermione’s temple in a gesture so loving that it almost broke Harry’s heart.
Harry had a sudden flashback to last time he went clubbing. He’d ended up drinking to the point that he was flat out drunk and had apparently tried to dance on the club tables before being kicked out by security.
“Well, what now?” Draco asked, lounging himself over the plush chair, one leg carelessly slung over the arm. “I’m bored.”
“No way! When?” Harry smiled down at the table, squinting his eyes at the cutlery. “More than once? Oh My Merlin!” Cole gassed.
“What did the sandwich ever do to you?” Draco asked, Harry was glaring daggers at the sandwich. Maybe it’s because he’d used wholemeal bread instead of white. Harry liked white bread.
And it worked. Harry leaned into his embrace and felt a tear fall from his eyes into Draco’s shirt. He must’ve felt it, but still, no comments. Harry let a few more fall, the pressure in his head eased with each tear until his eyes were set on full flood gates into Draco’s shoulder.
“Maybe I don’t want to go back, Malfoy.” Harry revealed. Malfoy’s mouth fell open and then closed again like a fish.
“Oh wow, we could be gym buddies!” Andy proposed, leaving Draco with a distasteful smile on his lips.
Harry smiled, and the next time he lowered his fingers, he flicked his tongue out to taste the tip of Draco’s dick, collecting a drop of precum on the end. Draco felt a long whine in his throat when Harry repeated the motion again, this time keeping his fingers on Draco’s hole and lowering his lips to the crown of his cock.
“Huh, I didn’t know you cared so much about basements.” Harry plondered, Malfoy quickly shot him an exaggerated eyeroll.
Harry looked around himself. He didn’t actually know how to get out of Malfoy’s house. He didn’t even know where this bedroom was. But he did know that the mattress beneath him felt like a cloud and that his eyes must’ve had weights draping them shut.
A pair of black, tight, ripped jeans clung indecently to his long, athletic legs and rested low on his hips. Harry found himself hypnotised by his body, but what stood out the most was the beam of platinum, blond hair which shone out like a beacon underneath the light.
But the feeling soon subsided when Harry pulled all the way out and began circling the outside with his tongue. Draco couldn’t bear it any longer, his stomach was screaming with want, he needed to be filled with something, anything.
Harry let out a small moan every time Malfoy’s hips would smack against his arse, the muscle of Harry’s bum rippling up with every thrust. Harry felt a small tear begin to form in the corner of his eye. He’d never felt so cared for in his life. This wasn’t just sex. He wasn’t just having sex with Malfoy.
“What do you mean ‘straight act’?” Draco asked, feeling his stomach fall out of his body. Harry rolled his eyes, filled with pent-up anger.
“Do it! Do it! Do it!” A random voice began chanting, causing a chain reaction where within a few seconds the whole crowd were shouting “Do it!” in Harry’s direction. He could hardly think over the noise.
I haven't written anything for a while, but I've had this saved on my laptop forever and never ended up posting it.
“I’ve noticed.” Harry told her, her eyebrows drew together, “You’re more confident now and I can see just how much happier you are.” Her eyes immediately lit up at Harry’s complement.
“I would hope so.” Harry looked just as nervous as Draco, worriedly squeezing his lip between his thumb and forefinger. “As long as you don’t run away screaming afterwards.”
“I thought we were making something more Malfoy. And you’ve just lied to me. Built our whole relationship on a foundation of lies.”
They all walked over to the middle of the room and sat down in a circle. Harry was sat between Cole and Catherine with Malfoy sat directly opposite him. This was not going to end well.
He made his decision and lowered his wand down, holding his breath as soon as it touched the sphere.
They stood silently staring at each other for a few seconds before the world around Draco came back to him. The dull thump in his ear swapping around to take in the sound of a roasting oven and bubbling pans.
Harry starts fucking him faster, bouncing Draco’s arse off his cock each time, giving little rhythmic grunts of exertion.
“Excuse me?!” Draco began. “For one, I would never let your grimy hands anywhere near me, and secondly, me and Harry aren’t… We aren’t… lovers!”
It was Draco’s favourite breakfast, he always made it when he had enough time in the morning, but he’d never asked Harry to make it before. He presumed that he wouldn’t know how to cook it properly.
Draco drew his mouth up so that his lips only wrapped around Harry’s crown and his tongue flicked over Harry’s slit at a mile a minute.
“What do you think then?” Harry asks, shooting a Lumos to the small light bulb so the two could finally put their wands down.
“The night shall never end!” Draco shouted, slamming the door behind himself, he dug a bottle of champagne out of a brown bag and immediately set to pulling the cork out of the top.
However, Harry was now regretting his excessive alcohol consumption when a sudden wave of discomfort shot over him. He shuffled his body slightly to get in a more comfortable position. Harry paused suddenly, his body bristling.
“Oh Merlin, you look like you’ve just been hit by a car, come in here. I’ll pop the kettle on.” Mia left the hallway and turned back into the kitchen, the faint sound of a kettle echoing her.
“Yes.” Harry replied, looking down into his cup of tea. “It would be a shame to let such a beautiful place go to waste.”
