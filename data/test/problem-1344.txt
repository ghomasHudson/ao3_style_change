“I understand that you can’t be touched by anyone since you came back to the manor?” Mrs. Bellke said.
“This works both ways, you know?” Draco said and Harry reached out to run his finger along the graceful curve of Draco’s cock. Draco inhaled sharply. “I almost forgot how it felt to be with someone else.”
"Will they? I don't think so. And if they do, how long am I supposed to wait? Years? Decades? Do you think when I'm an old man, they'll deem me safe and let me live out the last few years of my life in freedom?”
Harry's forehead wrinkled, his eyebrows pulling together. “What do you mean? I saw you the other day! When I went to St. Mungos and invited you for lunch with Terry Boot. You declined because you said the Spell Damage ward was jam-packed and you couldn’t afford free time.”
Outside, it was a perfect summer day. The sun was shining brightly, and the warm breeze through the trees was a familiar and comforting tune.
“You have feelings for him, mate.” Ron’s face looked wretched as he said it. “You’re not the type to fool around with just anyone.”
"Tastes good though, kinda zingy,” Nevertheless, Harry put the pot down. Malfoy leaned his head back. Harry rested back on his hands, stretched his legs out, digging his heels into the cool sand of the cave floor, and stared. “So?”
"You can't,” was the first thing Harry said, still gasping for breath, bent in half with his hands grasping his knees, but his head pulled up to meet Draco's gaze (
Harry's fingertips were rough and yet gentle as they brushed over Draco's throat, making him swallow reflexively. When the touches reached his eyes, he closed them obligingly, letting Harry feel the soft skin of his eyelids and the skittish movement of his eyes underneath as he tried to keep them still. “Draco,” he heard Harry sigh just before he opened his eyes, feeling Harry stroke down the side of his face. Draco had heard Harry say his name before, shouts and screams and desperate cries and even softly, late at night when Harry thought he was asleep, but never
"So what's your favourite memory?” Harry kicked his heels against the ground impatiently, lifting a hand to scratch below his ear. “Mine is when Hagrid told me I was a wizard. And maybe when I learned about Quidditch. No, wait. When I found Sirius,” Harry’s voice caught at his late godfather’s name but he plunged on a beat later, ”and Lupin. Oh, when they told me about the Order. Well, actually,” Harry paused, grinning teasingly at Malfoy. “It’s probably when you promised to come back to London with me.”
"Watching me,” Draco clarified. “I'm fine. You don't need to keep checking up on me.”
"Forget it,” Draco said briskly, moving to the kitchen, hearing Harry follow him. “I said things too.”
to do with what I want.”
Who...?
"Nothing,” Draco said, “you just taste like you.”
Andromeda looked at him with something akin to pity. She reached out one hand and ruffled the top of Harry's hair.
Harry slid his hands down to either side of Draco's face, holding him there, feeling puffs of air against his lips. Harry sucked it in greedily, making Draco squint at him. “What the hell are you doing?” he asked, his words soft as he dipped his head slightly to lick along Harry's parted lips.
"I put him on a high dosage already,” Pansy said, biting her lip. “I know he lies about how much pain he's in, so I went straight ahead. The thing is, the headaches are just going to get worse and worse until he completes.”
"I see,” Pansy said evenly as they walked down the main street. “Have you noticed anything else? The treatment's in its fifteenth week,” she hesitated, glancing at Harry's face before continuing. “He should be completing soon, but I haven't noticed anything, and when I ask...”
Hermione’s lips thinned ever so slightly and she gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head.

“I’ve sent us to The Muggle Liaison floor, we’ll have to ask Kingsley to connect your dad’s office to the floo network temporarily.” Hermione finished writing her note, folded it into a delicate origami bird and tapped it with her wand. The bird lifted both its tiny wings and flue up into the air and straight out of the lift doors as they opened onto Ministry corridor.
“Na mate, we’ve got The Weird Sisters, can’t beat a classic” Ron said with certainty.
A bright warm smile lit up behind Hermione’s eyes, as tears started falling down her face once more. “I’d like that Dad. Thank You”. She rushed forwards to give Mr Granger a tight hug before stepping back with a smile.
“Right, yes, er… thanks” Harry said feeling very awkward. He still wasn’t used to experienced professionals treating him like their equal or even in some cases superior. It was a trait that had been popping up around the ministry alarmingly often in the last few weeks.
Harry was immediately suspicious.
"Well. Yes. A bit. Granger said you wouldn't find out…"
Unfortunately, Harry did know. Still, he couldn’t help lifting up the lid to take a peek inside, and. Shoebox. It even had a sheet of white tissue paper tucked snugly inside. But one look at Rosemary convinced him not to press his point. If she said it was a charmed receptacle of Splinching accident specimens or whatever, he’d just go along with it. Easier all the way round, like that.
he barely stopped himself from saying aloud. “...are looking into it.”
"Right," Harry said. "Centuries. Whatever you say. Look, can I get rid of it now?"
be all those things. He'd seen it. But she also terrorized the floor with her charts and schedules and
Harry frowned. "Wha—?"
“Well,” he said finally, looking back up at Harry. “It was very kind of you to wrap it up for me.”
The reprieve lasted just long enough for Harry to drop the paperwork and pick up his fork, and then the cock started vibrating again. The lampshade swayed as the masochistic penis responded readily.
“Neither did I. Now, however, I do.” Harry glared at his pint, and took a large swallow.
"Hm. How they expect him to find room for it with that stick shoved so far up his arse…" Malfoy's words trailed off as he reached for the box of gloves.
,” Harry said into the tabletop, “is not
Malfoy stopped writing. “You keep them on your desk?”
His half-panicked brain took that last thought and ran with it; his hands opened, the smoldering box dropped to the ground and, to Harry’s horror, the penis flopped out, a bright jet of sparks still shooting from the tip. Then there was screaming and confusion as everyone tried to put as much distance between themselves and the sparking penis as they could in the confines of the lift. One particularly brave woman kept her head about her and doused the burning box with a firm Aguamenti. The penis twitched when the cold water spreading across the floor touched it, flopping over to shoot sparks in the opposite direction, and there was more chaos as everyone scrambled to get out of its path.
"Mm. I notice you’re not saying you didn't want to." Malfoy gave a little wriggle at that, causing his cock to slide a bit in Harry's grip, and Harry could only shake his head. "You obviously need more practice. I can send you more."
Dinner went downhill from there.
Harry dumped the Vicious Cockmonster in its original packaging before Flooing to St Mungo's. Sparing a wave for a harassed-looking Muriel (and the dozen or so people clamouring at her desk) he took the lift to Spell Damage.
"Much better after a pint in me, thanks. I still can't believe any of them will be in any shape to pass their Apparition Exam next month, but I'm surviving them at least."
“You’re joking, aren’t you? Malfoy, that thing is covered in silver and gold glitter and shooting rainbow sparks. I may not be a Healer, but I’m pretty sure it’s not real.” He shrugged. “Hitting it only works for a little while. You should get your exam done before it starts up again.”
"Mr Potter. Yesterday you brought what you thought was a Splinching accident to St Mungo's. Is that correct?"
stuck to the fucking chair, to take back to his cubicle in the Auror Department.
Harry could feel the blood rushing to his face, what blood wasn't headed south, that is, and he coughed, eyes skittering around the room. "You're the one mishandling evidence."
"Prestissimo Erectus?" Harry read aloud without thinking as he tried to parse his way through the Latin.
The absolute last thing he needed was to bring a disturbingly realistic sex toy to St Mungo’s reeking of Indian food, so he grudgingly took up a paper napkin and gingerly dabbed it clean. At first he tried to ignore how it firmed up a little from the attention, but that just made it easier to wipe down so Harry went with it. He tried not to think too hard about it, and it all worked out all right.
“You do recall that you’re the one who gave me a clear glass jar to put it in?”
He hadn't misheard. He hadn't really thought he'd misheard, but he'd certainly hoped he might have. Harry sighed and picked up his box. "Thank you," he said, for lack of anything better to say, and headed off to exam room 12.
“I assure you I’m more than capable of handling parchment,” Malfoy sniffed, briskly filling out his name and credentials on the first page of the form.
But no, with his luck, that would end him up in St Mungo's, waiting for Malfoy to reattach something.
Rosemary's shout brought his head up quickly enough his neck twinged, and he stood and raced around his desk to the door. Looking around the department, it all seemed completely normal, and he frowned. "What's up?"
He'd never realized how busy St Mungo's could be on a Wednesday morning. The Welcome Witch's desk was surrounded. There was a tired looking man holding a toddler who seemed to be belching fire every twenty seconds. An elderly pair of witches were supporting a third, who was clutching a viney plant and whose skin was beginning to turn green. A large family was standing to one side, each clutching a vial and with steam coming out their ears. A crup was barking and straining at its leash to make brief lunges at a pair of teenagers sitting on the floor eating pasties.
“Not when Harry’s trauma involves purebred kneazles and him getting hit with purses, no,” Ginny said. “Then I want to hear more about Harry’s trauma.”
"But," Harry said, looking down at the cock. Lacking any further attention, it had begun to droop a little, like a flower in need of watering. "It looks real."
“Oh, fuck
and he just needed to Obliviate that out of his head right now. "And someone sent this to Bartram?"
"Yes."
At that point Harry was rescued by Malfoy sliding into the seat beside Pansy, and Harry’s irritation with her was swept away in a wave of gratitude for the timeliness of his appearance. Then Harry realized he was feeling
half-hard from watching Malfoy wave a cock at him.
Rosemary gave him a high-five just inside, out of view of Robards, and he grinned. It felt like the first thing to go right in the entire stupid case.
Harry clutched the plate, and then grabbed his cup for good measure.
“Just bothering you,” Seamus said, wandering in and picking up a quill from Harry’s desk. He poked idly at BDSM cock.
There was indeed a way to undo it, Harry discovered unhappily. There were three ways. The instruction card assured him that the cocks would respond 'realistically' to 'manual stimulation.' Which. No. No way. Option two was another charm Harry could activate that'd ensure the cocks would 'come' when he did. Which. Also no. Absolutely not. The third option was to simply leave them be. The card informed him that the Extra-Strength Endurance Charms would ensure him three hours of continuous use after which the cocks would return to their inactive states on their own.
"Potter…"
He stood a moment, staring down at it and concentrating on his breathing. He was uncertain if he was more likely to chuck the stupid thing into the wall or break into hysterical laughter. Because there was a dick in a box waiting for him. There. On the floor.
Harry looked over to see Robards rushing across the room towards them, red-faced and fuming. He grabbed Seamus by the arm before he could duck away. By now, most of the department was standing on their desks or crowding out of their cubes to watch.
After the flirting, it was pretty clear what his goal was. And Harry couldn’t deny that it’d rather worked.
,” he said, swishing his wand at the vibrating penis. Then again, more desperately, “
to Arthur's kindly face. "Please don't say penis again."
Malfoy visibly gritted his teeth. “My holiday was perfectly lovely, thank you for asking. It’s the coming back to find that they’d arsed up my schedule and put me on the overnight shift that
“I ought to write in the Wily Willie one,” Malfoy said, pulling a pair of exam gloves from the box on the counter. He was still smiling.
Malfoy started laughing again, a low chuckle, but now he was kissing Harry so that was okay.
Harry heaved another sigh, and Hermione came around his desk and gave him a quick hug. "Have fun with your cocks. Good luck at St Mungo's. I'll see you at the pub this evening."
“No luck?” Seamus asked when Harry passed by his cubicle. He came out and trailed after Harry.
On the fourth floor, Harry was directed to exam room 9. He set the vase of flowers on the counter, considered unloading the cock from it, but figured what the hell. He sort of wanted to see the expressions Malfoy’s face would make if he had to do it himself.
"What I don't understand is why they needed eight Obliviators. And why didn't anyone Obliviate me? I'm the one who saw Mr Smythe naked in his tub. Who takes a bath at half two, anyway?"
“You liar,” Harry said with a laugh. “You had no idea about the flowers."
Which was true, unfortunately. That was exactly how Harry’s life worked, which was why this sudden normalcy left him on edge.
"Apparition, yeah?" the Mediwitch cut in. She nodded toward the box and gave Harry a rueful smile. "We see a lot of you folks in here. Especially round holidays. Don't even get me started on Beltane. It's a madhouse in here, arms and feet everywhere! One year we had an entire box of ears. Had the devil's own time matching them up to their owners again. Somehow we ended up with one left over." Her gaze went a little distant. "I wonder what happened to it..."
"And where are they going to transfer me? I'm already in Apparition. And Kingsley put me on this case specifically." He grinned. "He can hardly fault me for having case notes on my desk. It shouldn't be my responsibility to Apparate people places, anyway."
"Rosemary?" he asked.
"Your
After the war, there’d been an enormous debate over whether the fountain ought to be restored to its original design or if it should be replaced by something else. Hermione and been heavily involved in campaigning for it to be replaced, and she’d dragged Harry into the cause right along with her. Member Bartram had been the champion for having it restored to its original design, citing
Malfoy leaned in, all hot breath along Harry's neck. "But it got you all hot and bothered, Potter."
"Along with a note telling him to shove it up his arse."
Harry had a moment to be grateful that he'd managed to get Malfoy shoved up against the wall, because leaning in on him was really rather brilliant. Much better way of flirting, snogging up against the wall like a normal human being, than sending fake cocks by the dozen.
A few minutes later, Malfoy swept into the exam room. He came up short when he caught sight of the flowers.
Robards rounded on Seamus. "Stop them!"
"They look so real. Like someone's real cock. Like it just..." His face had gone somewhat green, and Harry was reminded of his own initial reaction.
Harry decided the best course of action was to ignore the both of them or they’d get caught up in a conversation about the outlandishly outdated forms that churned sluggishly through the Ministry’s official channels. Which, fair point. Some of it was ridiculously antiquated and the ones that required being filled out in triplicate especially were an astronomical waste of time. But. Mrs Periweather. Persimmon. Harry plunged onward in his tale of woe. “So there I am, neck-deep in paperwork when there comes a knock on my door. And do you know who it was?”
had opened that box?" And he never knew she could do such a spot-on impression of Bartram.
Pansy raised a brow at him when he didn’t respond right away, and Harry sighed and took another drink from his pint. “Go bother Seamus, then, if you think he’s so unprofessional. He’ll be more than willing to blab about an open investigation.” And right now, having Seamus lay out the particulars of how Harry’s life had gone particularly pear-shaped over the past few weeks was preferable to being forced to do it himself.
“No,” said Rosemary slowly. “It is a very carefully charmed Containment Receptacle for
"It is an outrage! An affront to public decency! What if my grandchildren had opened the box? I want whoever sent this arrested!"
Back in his office, he set his lunch and his drink down on his desk, then carefully slid the cock out of the bag so it sat on the edge of his desk beside the other five.
It was well past two thirty in the morning when Ron fell asleep. Harry and Dean had been playing two against one with him for the past two hours, and had still lost three games.
Dean looked away from Harry, into the shadows. “Um I think I want to sleep now, would you mind if we called it a night?”
“You lost some of my trust, when I realized what you had done… I am not going to lie, it scared me, it scared me that someone could just lift a stick and change who I was and the fact that that someone was my own daughter that was the scariest part of all.” He looked past Hermione at the French windows for a second before he looked directly back into his daughter’s eyes. “So I cannot say you haven’t lost some trust. But you have most definitely not lost my respect. To have been able to face the things you have, to have made the decisions you have had to. Those are incredible achievements and I am more proud of you than I ever thought possible… Maybe we can work on that trust again? Now that we are back and we know who our daughter really is?” By the time he had finished this he was standing in front of Hermione with his hands clasped firmly around her shoulders.
“We can’t be there yet,” Mrs Granger said looking up in surprise. “It’s nearly an hours drive from Heathrow to our house and that’s if there’s no traffic. We’ve hardly been on the road for twenty minutes.”
Harry stared at the parchment. So they were about to begin. Harry had known that the trials would start soon, but he had been doing his best to avoid thinking about them. The idea that he would have to sit in that cold cave of a court and talk about the events of the war, some of his most traumatic experiences, probably multiple times was terrifying. Not to mention that Harry would be forced to face people who had been trying to torture and kill him, only two months ago.
Harry stared after the two wizards in horror; they had been talking about Malfoy. Harry couldn’t quite get his head together; they had been talking about Draco Malfoy an eighteen-year-old human like he was some kind of filthy animal. Malfoy was an arse and a bigot but he was still human!
“There’s something Hermione still hasn’t told you about. Something about last year.”
him, he could barley breath when he got back. Don’t think Malfoy actually knew he’d done it until after.”
When Harry got down stairs the first thing he saw was Seamus and Dean curled up on the sofa fast asleep, a game of chess lay abandoned on the mosaic topped coffee table before them. Blacks were winning, which probably meant they were Seamus’, he was the only person who would still play Ron even if he never did actually win. They were slumped over each other, Seamus’ head resting comfortably on his best friends shoulder. The pair had become entirely inseparable since the end of the war, Seamus had confessed to Harry one rather drunken night a few weeks ago that the time Dean had spent on the run had been some of the Irishman’s most terrifying months. “I didn’t even know where he was yeh know? If he was even alive, I had no way to help him. We kept hearing about the people they found, what the snatchers would do to them and all I could think was, is Dean one of them?” he had slurred to Harry in an intoxicated whisper. It was Seamus who had gone with Dean to see his family straight after the battle only to find a burnt out shell, his entire family still inside. Dean’s eyes often became vacant as he got lost in his own grief and Seamus was often seen talking to him quietly in a corner or else taking him away for long walks in the Devonshire countryside.
“WHAT WAS THAT?” came the horse, overly loud voice of Mrs Granger. The trio whipped around, drawing their wands as one. They had forgotten they weren’t alone.
“Yeah Mione, I kinda do” he replied giving her a small shrug before continuing.
Ginny and Neville both started sniggering, Mrs Weasley was not similarly impressed, giving Ron a swot around the ear.
“Good morning Harry, did you sleep well?” Mr Weasley asked looking up from a pile of paper work with a tired smile. Mr Weasley had been given quite a serious promotion after the war; he was now head of the Muggle Liaison Office and was responsible for repairing all the damage the Muggle community had un-knowingly suffered at the hands of Voldemort and the Death Eaters.
Mr Granger had stood up at some point during Hemione’s retelling of the war, he was staring off into space a look on his face that was almost completely impossible to read.
The doors shut on the lift before the cramped mettle box zoomed off backwards and up towards the Ministry atrium.
The song Ode To Potter is real its by the Switchblade Kittens and you should definitely look it up... its a blast.
Harry sheared Ron’s excitement for the morning’s activity, although he imagined for slightly different reasons. Hermione was finally returning home from Australia with her parents this morning. She had left for the far side of the world two weeks after the final battle to find them, and hopefully restore their memories. Harry and Ron had wanted to go with her, but she had insisted they stay with the Weasleys, reasoning that the family needed their support more than she did then.
In all honesty Harry couldn’t find it within him to find any humour in the situation, he’d been in the stand four out of the six days Umbridge had been on trial and was absolutely exhausted.  Four days of watching, analysing and explaining his own memories to a group of strangers had taken a lot of his energy. Matters hadn’t been helped by the number of Wizengemot Bench Members who had been unconvinced that one of their own could have done so much damage even before the war, they had still seemed dubious even after seeing the numerous accounts of Umbridge torturing students in her short tenure at Hogwarts. Harry suspected that the Benchers who had sided with the toad were in fact more scared of what she would do them if they didn’t, Umbridge had held a lot of power and discovered a lot of secrets over the last year after all.
“Prosecution if you would make clear your opening statements?” Kingsley said to the tall man with a black widows peak and a nose so hooked it could of rivalled Snape’s.
Harry goes to see Teddy and Andromeda.
“Looked after me!” Hermione screeched. “Looked after me! I was the one looking after you!” at this Hermione whipped out her wand, pointing it directly at her own head before pulling it away and throwing what looked like a silver liquid at the glass conservatory doors.
After an age of silent contemplation she took a breath and appeared to shake herself, pulling together all her thoughts before addressing Harry once again.
As he turned on the spot apperating away from the small council house Harry couldn’t help but think about Andromeda. How easy it had become to talk to her about his worries. She was as friendly and straight talking as Tonks had always been but she also managed to understand and support Harry in a way that couldn’t help but remind him of Sirius. Funny Harry thought, how he always seemed to become so close with descendants of the Blacks, especially considering that families normal views.
“Why not?” Harry laughed “Muggles make kids books about Lions all the time.”
“Bloody awfully if you ask me” Ron said a little too loudly making Harry drop the rubber duck Mr Weasley had on his desk. Clasping his hands together quickly to stop them shaking, Harry took a step back from the surface so as not risk breaking anything.
“Good riddance if you ask me. She called me in for questioning when my Ted went on the run. My skin was crawling just being in the same room as her.”
At this the young witch lifted her wand, pointing it at one of the stained glass Tiffany lamps in the corner. She muttered something under his breath and soon five people watched as the lamp started to shift, the leaf like patterns pulled themselves away from the glass as they transformed into real plant leaves. The lamp plant grew until it filled the entirety of the room’s corner. Small pale pink and blue buds opened to reveal delicate glass like flowers every few inches along the sinuous stems. And then, as if someone had plugged it into the mains, the plant began to glow, a soft warm light that filled the room.
Then to Harry’s utter amazement, a high peel of laughter escaped Hermione’s mouth. It was an oddly jarring sound, completely devoid of humour. Harry was briefly reminded of Bellatrix’s mad cackles. It was a thought he pushed away very quickly.
“I can’t” Hermione said her voice a dry rasping sound barely audible at all.
“Well, yes that’s how its started Dad, but…” Hermione began, but was quickly interrupted.
Harry receives a letter. Thoughts start to shift and Dean needs a hug.
After taking a breath to wipe her eyes, she spoke of Neville killing Nagini and fighting Bellatrix with Ginny and Luna just before Molly killed her. At last she spoke of Harry and Voldemorts final duel and Harrys victory.
They continued in this manner for a couple of minutes, each taking a turn to perform a charm or transfigure something in the room into a pretty or often comical object.
Harry woke the next morning certain of one thing. He could not stand by and let Draco Malfoy suffer for the mistakes he’d made and the decisions he’d made to protect those he’d loved.
None of the estate’s residence would expect that behind the hawthorn hedge and lace curtains lived the last full blooded descendent of one of the oldest and most powerful pureblood houses in the world. They would be even more dismayed to learn that with her lived the infant child of a werewolf and a woman who could change her appearance at will. The strangest of things it seemed, were often found in the most likely places.
“I’m sorry, I keep forgetting… Arthur” he said with a smile, opting not to tell him he’d gotten the two very different Muggle devices mixed up.
“Hermione played a huge roll in the war effort, quite frankly without her and Ron here” Harry gestured to his closest friend “we wouldn’t of won. That on top of her friendship with me put her in a very dangerous position. The Death Eaters would of been keeping an eye on your house incase any of us showed up looking for help, the spells we are looking for would of most likely of been meant for one of us.” Harry finished looking at the two Granger parents who had gone an ashen shade of grey. Harry looked quickly at Hermione and realized too late that he may have said entirely the wrong thing. His friend’s eyes were glistening with tears as she looked at her Mum and Dad sitting on the seat next to her.
Dean nodded that he could and Harry got up to leave.
“You still have no idea do you!” Hermione laughed in her father’s astonished face. “You think you could have protected me? You think you could have protected me from people who hold more power in the palm of their hand than the atom bomb? You don’t even know what real magic can do! The most you’ve ever seen are the few parlor tricks I did in my first week home before I wiped your memories!”
AHHHH I know I'm sorry it was too good to not do. I will put the next one up as soon as I can. Please stay safe in this time of total madness. love P&U
“What will you say?” Harry asked, unable to suppress his curiosity.
Harry just stared at his friend unsure how to respond.
“If you’d told us what to expect we could of prepared ourselves. You could of put up some defenses and we could of looked after you” Mr Granger roared.
“Thank you for explaining to us what was going on last year Harry” Mr Granger said. “At least we know what was happening in the country and what this whole war business was about. It hasn’t escaped me however that you have not really told us what you and my daughter were up to whilst you were looking for these
It had been Bellatrix’s work in the end. There had been evidence of the cruciatus curse as well as a sickening amount of mundane torture. Truly the worst of it though had been the spelled rope holding them to their chairs. Trapping the young wizards family as that mad witch had burned their house around them. Dean hadn’t even known until he and Seamus had apparated onto the scene the morning after the final battle. He hadn’t spoken for two weeks after, unable to process what had happened.
Harry, Ron and Hermione attempted to answer all they asked. Explaining what they could and offering the best suggestions they were able to, to those they could not.
“Yes, yes, it all been so very exciting to meet you all, I can’t wait until my Milly hears about it. Once again thank you to all three of you, you have no idea how much your heroics mean to so many, they wont be forgotten, I can promise you that! They most definitely will not!”
“Harry mate, you all right?” Ron asked. “Take a deep breath, in… and… out… that’s it.” Ron held Harry’s shoulders firmly calmly looking into Harry’s eyes. This was by no means the first time Ron had helped Harry through a panic attack. Attacks like Harry’s had become a common occurrence at The Burrow in the past few months and the occupants of the Weasley family home were all used to helping one another through them.
“Magic isn’t all terrible Mrs Granger” Harry said looking up at the small woman from his seat. “On the whole it’s actually really quite beautiful”.
Any fears Ron may have had that their blossoming romance had wilted in the weeks since they had seen each other last were quickly put to rest when Hermione quite literally flung herself at him the second they were within reaching distance. Planting a firm kiss on his lips her arms wrapping around him with such force Ron actually had to take a couple of steps to balance them again. The two separated quickly, Ron sending a sheepish glance at Hermione’s parents, who were giving the couple a rather surprised look at the exuberant show of affection.  Hermione didn’t even glance at them, instead swooping Harry into an equally bone crushing yet markedly less passionate hug, before stepping back to run a critical gaze over them both.
She told them about fifth year. About Dumbledore’s Army and what really happened in the Department of Mysteries. How it had been there, as she and her friends fought for their lives, that she had realized Voldemort and his followers would stop at nothing to get what they wanted, even if that meant killing her or her family. That had been when she had decided she couldn’t risk telling her parents about the war.
“I’m afraid I still don’t understand” Mrs Granger said, looking around the car in confusion. “Why would these Death Eaters want to attack us, we have nothing really to do with your world other than Hermione. The closest we’ve come to magic is buying schoolbooks in Diagon Ally at the start of each year, what could we have that would be so important to them?”
“Do you?” Neville asked.
After discussing details and payment for another thirty minutes Harry found himself outside again with Draco.
“Yours and your mother’s,” Harry said.
He was reading the Prophet and drinking his second cup of tea when Harry finally came down to the kitchen.
Harry nodded. He had noticed that. “We should maybe look into the Muggle victims again. Maybe they had some witch or wizard blood in them.”
Draco answered with a smile. It was that smile, that made Harry snap. It had been so long and he had fed on half remembered dreams and elaborated fantasies and now Draco was here and he was smiling and a bit mean and a lot beautiful and yes, hot as hell and Harry wanted to touch him, needed to touch him so he did.
“Was it like this between us?” Harry asked later once they cleaned up, lying in the bed with Draco in the middle.
“I’m glad you said yes, Draco,” Harry said. He was too close, a few times as they walked down the street their fingers nearly brushed.
“So, he has no money, no friends and only a cursed house to stay in.” Why come back at all then, Harry wondered.
Harry didn’t answer for a long second. “It feels familiar. When you say my name like that  it seems like the last fourteen years didn’t happen.”
“As I was saying: I am Harry James Potter who is in love with Draco Lucius Malfoy and the future is looking bright.”
“We have people on her,” Astra said.
“What we’re doing is real sex, Harry,” Draco said, holding up a hand when Harry tried to say something. Draco was clearly not done yet. And he had called him Harry and not Potter, which was happening more and more often these days and told Harry that Draco was getting more comfortable with their relationship. It gave Harry hope for the future. “Because not every couple queer or not has penetrative sex. But I get what you are trying to say, or ask, okay?”
Fuck, Harry thought, he got sidetracked again. “Draco, you didn’t answer my original question.”
Luna poured tea for them once they were settled in the parlor, then moved to sit next to Draco, leaving the usual space between them.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Henri said. He never used Draco’s first name, which was fine with him. When Draco had gone to the Ministry, nearly ten years ago now, and told them about his visions, they had thought it was a joke. They had assigned Henri to him as a kind of punishment. Draco never asked what Henri had done to anger the higher ups, but thanks to Draco's visions and Henri's uncanny talent in deciphering the clues in the paintings, cases were solved left, right, and center. Draco refused to work with anyone else. Many others had tried, mostly to boost their performance ratings, but Draco liked Henri. He thought they were kindred spirits.
"You don't want to be there?” Andromeda enquired politely.
“I hope you’re not making a mistake, Harry.” Hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. “I won’t be present as I’d like to anymore, what with me going back to Hogwarts.”
Draco’s lip curled, a thread of control snapping at the claim. “And what exactly is that? A prejudiced pureblood prat that acted as if he owned Hogwarts since he was young? A guy who’s smart but did nothing but stupid decisions in life? Someone who cursed and tortured people and took the Dark Mark? A coward who escaped with his parents? An ungrateful child for giving them up at the last minute?”
Harry nodded thoughtfully, slipping one hand under the table to clasp at Draco's. "Okay. So how does this work?" Though Draco's hand tensed for a moment, he didn't pull away.
"Draco, look at me,” Harry panted, licking and biting against Draco's neck before moving up to meet his eye, his forearm propping himself up while his other hand rubbed gently at the skin on his hipbone. “Draco.”
"Harry...” Shacklebolt sighed heavily. “Maybe it's better this way,” he suggested. “It could be like a fresh start for him...”
- and somehow that made it alright.
Trying to muddle through the words just confused Harry more, although he felt that he should be upset on Draco's behalf. “I don't understand.”
"It's been twenty two weeks,” Pansy continued. “You'll be happy to be finished.”
And each time Harry made a new claim, Malfoy gave him a look that plainly voiced his skepticism, but said nothing.
The corner of Draco's mouth lifted in a weak facsimile of a smile. “And when they send your friends after us? Will you hold back and run the risk of us being caught, or go all out and live with their blood on your hands?” The smile dropped away. “You wouldn't do that. And I wouldn't let you.” He frowned, reaching up to rub at his temple. Automatically, Harry batted his hand away and replaced it with his own, rubbing small, soothing circles. Draco looked irritated, but it fell away into resignation quickly, and he didn't attempt to stop him.
Taking a deep breath, Harry bumped his hand gently against the one Draco had laid on the table, before walking around and sliding into the chair next to him.
remember.”
"What memories- which ones?” Harry asked, instead.
"You don't know what I'm going to say,” Harry replied, watching as Draco’s fingers flexed and relaxed around the bottle.
Cringing a little at the intensity of Malfoy's glare and the pain in his voice, Harry leaned forward and grabbed the hand that was resting on Malfoy's knee, trying to convey some of his warmth into the cold skin. “Malfoy, I-” He was roughly shook off as Malfoy stood, presenting Harry with a view of his back.
During the twentieth week of his treatment, Draco awoke to soft fingers trailing up his arm. His mind felt cloudy, and as he opened his eyes, he struggled to get a grip on his thoughts, feeling them pull away from him, escaping like a fluid dream.
Satisfied, Draco closed his eyes, pressing his face into the crook of Harry's neck and sighing, feeling a hundred years old as he surrendered to sleep.
"It doesn't help,” Draco said after a few seconds. Harry's touch was surprisingly light and relaxing, in comparison to his usual all consuming, fiery touches. Occasionally he paused to brush the fingers of one hand through Draco's hair in gentle, firm strokes.
"No headaches?” Pansy ventured, the tapping of her pen against the table the only noise in the kitchen.
"What matters is that right now, you remember me. That you remember us.”
Afterwards, they lay panting, side by side, letting their bodies cool and listening to the way their breathing fell into synchronization, and then back out. Absorbing what they had done, and what it meant, and trying to work out if things were different now, and if they weren't, why not.
The answer slipped past him as easily as breathing. “Okay,” was all Harry said, his mind going back to the War. The way many had died. The way
Gnawing her lip, Pansy spoke slowly. “Neville said that they would consider freeing Draco.”
"Sorry,” Harry said, utterly unrepentant. “Couldn't help it.”
"Hey,” Harry returned. Draco waited for him to say something else, but he didn't. Just continued the slow movement of his fingers, drawing an invisible line down Draco's collarbone, brushing a thumb over his sternum.
"Draco..”
"You'd better not,” Harry said lowly, his voice scratching slightly.
After a few blissful seconds, spent floating on sensation, Draco pressed weakly on his hip, signalling that he wanted Harry to move, making him roll back, so they laid side by side. Ignoring his exhaustion, and the sticky wetness they had created, before falling asleep, Harry forced his eyes open. He watched as Draco's breathing evened out, his face perfectly relaxed, and memorised it.
"At least you'll still be the Draco I know when you get out!” Harry insisted. He glared at the bars, wishing so much that they weren't there. He felt, if he could just touch Draco, physically, he would be able to convince him. “If you agree then...then what about
Harry kissed the edge of Draco's eye, his lips slipping a little on the moisture there, tongue lapping it up. “I hate this.” His voice seemed to rumble right through Draco. “I hate this so much.”
"I don't know what it is you expect me to do,” Shacklebolt said. “You do know he took the Dark Mark, right? He let the Death Eaters in Hogwarts, putting everyone’s lives at risk. He attempted to murder Dumbledore. He tortured muggles, he said so when we gave him Veritaserum.”
"Yeah,” Draco said. “But you know, that doesn't matter.” His cavalier attitude was enforced by the purposeful swig of alcohol he took. “You know why?”
"You don't need to explain that to me,” Harry said quietly.
But Draco couldn't find it in himself to regret his decision of coming back with Potter.
"I know that,” Harry said, his words practically a whisper, “but I am.”
Giving him a blank stare, Draco shoved weakly at the elbow. “Who?”
"Draco,” Harry found himself gasping. “Draco...” He had no idea why he was saying it, only that it was the only thing that his lust-ridden mind could comprehend right now; the body moving insistently against his, and the person that Harry was...that he’s in...
“Blaise is right. We need to go on the offense on this one. You dating Potter will help. You might be a former Death Eater and war criminal-”
“They had him under a curse and I think they have been starving him too. Giving him just enough to make him able to heal people, but not enough to free himself.”
“I know who you really are, Belladonna. I think it would be in both our interests if you declined your new publisher’s offer and instead took mine. You will understand that I can’t offer you your old contract anymore, now that I know who you are and what you’ve done. After the way you treated me. But I’m willing to keep your secret, Malfoy, for the rights to your next three books. Find the new contract and terms attached. I hope I will hear from you very soon.
Draco sat up and closed his eyes. He breathed for a few minutes and Harry watched him. Watched his chest and his face and his neck, so tempting, really. Had Draco always been so tempting?
“You’re clearly more experienced than me when it comes to being with men.”
“Harry,” Harry said and looked away from Draco’s face. He could feel a blush creeping up his skin and he wasn’t sure why. It wasn’t like Draco had meant anything by his comment about Harry’s eyes, right?
“If I had, I wouldn’t share any details with you anyway.”
“Whatever for?” Draco asked. He waved his hand so the painting was covered up by another tarp. He didn’t want it damaged. Maybe because it was the only evidence, aside from the visions, magic, and scars, that proved that night happened. Maybe it would... what? Help? Who was he kidding?
“You know how Harry’s wand hadn’t been found with him when they found him in that inn all those months ago?”
Harry grinned. “Amazing.”
“Not the Manor,” Potter said.
“Well, yes, obviously. So have I,” Draco replied. He wasn’t concerned in the least. He and Harry were meant to be. He knew it, Harry knew it too. Their fucking houses knew it. Sooner rather than later everyone else would also know it. “But me and him were a long time in the making, Auror Bain.”
“I know. The Ministry wanted to have a look at it all, wanted to get their hands on it, but your mother has very good lawyers.”
“Really? You get off on verbal abuse?”
“Oh,” Neville replied.
“Not surprised,” Draco said.
He knew that, so he nodded, but he had no idea why she was telling him that right now. What the hell did she think would happen?
“But Julien is where we need to start digging,” Harry continued that thought.
“I shot you down every single time you asked, Potter. Why keep it up?”
Blaise gave him a look that clearly said he knew Draco was full of shit, and yes, that was the bloody truth too, but he was glad that at least for now Blaise was going to let it go.
“You’re not worried, really?” Harry asked that evening over dinner.
“Why, thank you, Auror Potter,” Draco said in a sultry voice.
“Pretty, young men and women, magic and Muggle both,” Thompson answered smoothly.
“Starting something?” Harry asked, his breathing was a bit too hard and his heart was beating a bit too fast, but that was the effect Draco had on him.
Henri had taken a million pictures of Vision No. 33, and the canvas was covered up with a tarp now. It loomed in the half darkness of the room and Draco was strangely fascinated by it. He should have put it in storage like all the others before, but for some reason he hadn’t. Maybe it was the fact that there was this white blank space. Maybe this wasn’t finished yet.
“So, she is fine with Belladonna being, well you?” Pansy asked.
“I think that’s wonderful,” Luna said, who was stroking Mr. Starlord, who in return was looking with disdain at Draco.
“He says it’s not a vision, but a memory; the past, his past, and it’s...it’s messed up because it’s beautiful but also horrific.”
“I know,” Draco said, because he really was aware of that fact.
“Maybe I will,” Harry said.  His hands were on Draco’s hips now, his thumbs caressing Draco’s pale, pale skin. He had no idea when that had happened, but he wasn’t going to question it either. When Draco’s naked skin was involved things were just going to happen.
“Isn’t that sweet?” Pansy asked.
Harry nodded.
“You just like to complicate things, don’t you?” Draco asked Antoine.
Harry hadn’t thought about Draco in years. In fact, not since the trials years ago. But now Draco Malfoy and what he was up to, if he was still in Great Britain, if he had children was at the forefront of Harry’s mind when he went about his days. All of these questions seemed to be burning inside him.
“Ah...and how did you find that out?”
“Not the point, Draco,” Potter huffed.
“No,” Harry answered, truthfully. Because it didn't. It was wrong on so many levels what the Ministry was doing with Draco and any other vampire they had captured that it really didn’t matter if he or Antoine knew a captive. The decent thing to do was to help them.
“You’re starting,” Draco said.
Draco grabbed his hair in fistfuls and deepened the kiss until they were both desperate for air.
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco gasped as he fell into the old, battered, but still very comfortable pale green armchair. He had dragged it up here with Blaise by hand since the cursed thing couldn’t be moved by magic because one of his ancestors had wanted it to stay at the manor forever. Draco wasn’t living at the manor anymore—thank Merlin—but he had still wanted the chair, come what may, so they did it the Muggle way.
“Finish your tea, and I will,” Draco replied. Potter smiled.
“Did you fight?”
Two days later Draco found himself in the unfortunate position to finally write that letter to his current publisher. There was nothing for it. The current book was nearly finished and Blaise, Pansy and Draco were already brainstorming cover art and marketing.
"How is he?” Pansy asked gently, as they walked past a row of restaurants and cafes, brightly lit.
"Then,” Harry paused, tasting the words, rolling them around his tongue to gauge whether or not he could say them. “Then we can leave.” He lowered his voice, brought his face close to Draco's. “We can just go. Your strength is coming back and I'd be there too. We could just go.”
The Wizengamot had given Draco a week to decide what he wished to do. Harry spent the seven days locked up in his flat, Draco refusing to see him in his cell, with nothing to do but stew over what had been said.
There was silence for a while, only a quiet dripping coming from the tap above Malfoy's washbasin, the faucet of which wouldn't close properly. Harry thought Malfoy wasn't going to answer, and was surprised when he spoke. “What's on my mind?”
"But there was a condition, Harry,” Pansy said. Sensing her lack of elation, the nervous way her eyes were scanning his reaction, Harry felt a cold fear grip him.
"Yeah.” Draco was finding it difficult to pay attention, but looked up in surprise when she stood to leave. “You're going?”
"Harry?” Draco rubbed his eyes again, trying to gather himself. Normally when he woke, he was more alert. He shifted again, feeling the sheet slip on him. That he wasn't wearing anything occurred to him, and he felt his heart rate increase just a little. He felt suddenly self-conscious, which was ludicrous, because the situation was hardly a novel experience by now, and yet he couldn't mistake the fluttering in his stomach for anything else. It had something to do with the way Harry was looking at him. The way he was looking, not talking, as though the dips and swells of Draco's body were a secret language and Harry was reading it. And at the same time, as if Harry was contemplating something far removed from their bed and the warm sheets, and the grey watery light filtering through the gap in the curtains; something that Draco had no part in.
Pansy's eyes were slightly narrowed. “Are you sure?”
"I wish you'd leave me alone,” Malfoy mumbled into the space between them.
"Yeah,” Harry said, somewhat relieved that Pansy had mentioned him first.
"True, but you managed to swallow the dinner that took me two hours to prepare in about thirty seconds.”
Collecting himself, Harry waited until they were through the door to speak. “Draco, about last week. That day...” Draco looked at him sharply as he slipped off his shoes, closing the door. “I said some things.”
Before Draco could adequately process this, Harry reached out and guided their faces together, capturing him in a short, sweet kiss, like he was closing a deal. Draco thought he tasted salt, but Harry's eyes were dry when he saw them for a second, before their positions changed and Harry was much closer, pressing his nose into the patch of skin behind Draco's ear, close to his hairline and inhaling deeply. “Not enough,” he said, his breath damp against Draco's neck, causing goosebumps. “It's not.”
There was something wrong with what Pansy was saying, something about what she was saying, that he should pay attention to, Draco thought as Pansy said her goodbye and left.
Draco considered this. “I'll miss you.” The words sounded awkward, unused, on his tongue.
"Oh.” Draco felt like the time span was very significant, like there was an event taking place, like something would have changed by the time Harry got back, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He did know that he didn't want Harry to go. That if Harry walked out of their bedroom, out of the apartment, and out of the London today, something very bad would happen.
"It's a two part treatment. First a healing spell is used, requiring direct contact. That's what I'll be administering.”
"What-”
“Mr. Malfoy was already aware of the arrangement. In fact, he was the one who insisted that he’d preferred you over any other Auror. It’s only for awhile. Just until his treatment finishes.”
"Get out,” he said quietly. “I want to be alone.” He threw himself onto the bed, effectively ignoring Harry who left with a heavy heart, wondering exactly what he had done.
Immediately, Harry panicked. “You do? Why didn't you tell me? Is it bad? Rate it, on a scale of one to ten. Do you want me to get Pansy?” Draco punched him in the shoulder, but not hard. Despite this, Harry looked affronted, holding his jaw and glaring. “Well excuse me for
On the floor adjacent to Draco's left foot, was a head of lettuce with a knife sticking out of it. Harry sat down. “I'm sure we could get another recipe.”
“But that’s not what bothers me, Harry.” Hermione’s face looked worried, her brows furrowed and his lips pursed.
"Maybe that's because I don't want to,” Malfoy snarled, throwing off the hand that Harry had placed on his shoulder, only to find himself shoved against the uneven wall of the cave with Harry infringing dangerously on his personal space.
Draco blinked. "I don't know,” he said truthfully. He hated crying. He would never cry in front of Harry. And yet he couldn't stop the tears- couldn't even identify why he felt like his heart was being ripped in two.
“Don’t you want to appoint me as the Voice of Reason in your absence?” Ron laughed, but it sounded shallow, his eyes melancholic. Harry pinched Hermione’s hand before pulling his hand back and tapped Ron on his shoulder, wanting to comfort him but not knowing how. They all knew Ron wanted to be with Hermione wherever she went to, but he didn’t want to go back to Hogwarts.
One, two, three steps and Harry reached Draco, kneeling next to him, ignoring the crumbs of something that dug into his skin. The fridge was open, its humming filled the whole room. A bottle of something was dripping in there, hitting the white shelf with a splat. Harry swallowed. “Remember what?”
"I don't like thinking about it,” Harry said with a shrug. When Andromeda didn't say anything, he added: “It's been six weeks already.”
"Of course I am,” Pansy said, a little too heatedly. “But it's okay. I know you've been busy.” She hesitated a moment. “With Draco.”
"Did you write it down?” Harry ventured, eyeing Draco as if he was a cobra that might lash out at any second.
"They'll release you eventually,” Harry said weakly. “They'll have to. You don't have to accept this...”
"Why would I?” Draco asked, eyes closed. “That's what's supposed to happen. I just didn't think it would be like this.”
"I lied,” Draco said in a low voice. He didn't look at Harry, just carried on staring at the ceiling. “When you asked me what my favourite memory was, and I said I didn't have one. I lied.” He glanced at Harry, lying peacefully on his side, no worry in his expression, and couldn't resist reaching out a hand to run down his arm, feeling the soft hairs and warm, solid muscle. “When you saved me from Fiendfyre. When you willingly risked your life to save mine. I don’t think you realize the gravity of what you’ve done for me.” Draco faltered for a second, wetting his lips and continuing. “For one moment, I felt like my life was more important to you than anything else. I was going to die, and it was okay.” Draco let out a low, shuddering breath. “That's my favourite memory. Even when I tried to forget it, I couldn't.” He paused. “But I'd give it up, if I could keep you.” He turned slightly, slinking closer to Harry, trying to forget himself in the warmth, the soft rise and fall of his chest. “So I'm giving it to you,” Draco whispered, “ as sentimental and stupid as that is. Keep it safe.”
"Things keep getting messy,” Draco muttered at length. “In my head. It's like I've got two images and they keep flickering in and out. I keep losing the details, and it's getting harder and harder to know which one's right, and which one's made up.”
"He didn't say anything?” Harry asked, clearly irritated, “I knew it. I
Turning back to her, Draco realised she was right. He tried to concentrate on her, but like he was being pulled in that direction, he kept wanting to turn to look at the door. “I don't know why I'm doing it.”
flat, was so far removed from anything Harry associated with Draco that it felt surreal. Harry hadn't wanted to rush, but today, they had eaten lunch, been halfway through washing up, when Harry had looked up and caught Draco's eyes looking right back at him.
"Nausea,” Pansy said thoughtfully, nodding to herself. “I can see why that could happen. I can give him something.” She looking up at Harry, “anything else?”
"The worst part,” Malfoy interrupted in a low voice, so quiet that if Harry hadn't been concentrating, he would have missed it, “is that I actually look forward to your visits, no matter how utterly pointless they are, because without them, trapped in here with no contact with any one, I'd go mad.” Malfoy let out a little bitter laugh. “Maybe then they'd deem me a danger to myself and kill me. I wish they would.”
“You call this
Pansy looked at him for a second, then nodded to herself, before changing the topic slightly. “You know, the Wizengamot isn't keeping Draco a prisoner because they think he's a danger.”
Draco cut him off with a quick but firm kiss. “Forget it,” he said seriously, leaning his head against Harry's for a second, so his grey eyes dominated Harry’s vision. “I don't want to spend any more time on the past.”
"How can you want that?” Harry said, disbelievingly. “How can you want to let it all go just like that?” Draco's eyebrows pulled together.
Opening his eyes felt like the hardest thing to do, but Draco managed, breath catching at the intensity of Harry's gaze. He stretched up, wanting more contact, but Harry pressed him back down the hand on his hip squeezing in warning, so he fell back down, breathing heavily.
When Draco still didn't answer, Potter started to fidget a little. There was nowhere to sit, and Draco saw Potter shift his weight from one foot to the other, still clutching the white box. “I...I know this is crap for you, but it's only temporary. Just until The Ministry is sure you're not a threat.”
Shacklebolt didn't smile when he came in, just looked at him, taking in his appearance; tired eyes, dishevelled clothes, and slumped, defeated shoulders.
Seconds later, he found himself pushed against a wall, kissing Draco like it was all he knew how to do, like if he stopped, if they lost contact for a second, something terrible would happen.
"I'm not a thing,” Draco said, but didn't move. “I know that's not all.”
"Y-you know I didn't mean that,” Harry said, panicking at the abrupt turn of events. “I just-”
"What?!” Harry practically shouted, making Pansy shush him. His eyes brightened and he let out a tiny disbelieving laugh. “No way?!”
Pansy had left the previous day after giving Draco the first of his treatments. Harry had watched as she placed her hands on Draco's temples and let her magic flow out. It had only lasted a few seconds, and before she finished she had asked Draco to drink the mixture she herself had prepared, and promised to return the next week.
"Malfoy, what's your favourite memory?” The damp walls of the cave, along with the persistent rain outside, made Harry's voice echo into the darkness. It had been three months since he had vanquished Voldemort for good. Three months since he volunteered to search for the Malfoys right after they vanished without trace the day before the trials. But what was three little months when added to seven years?
Eventually he untangled himself carefully from Harry and stood, managing to pull the sheets out from underneath him and lay back down, draping them over the two of them. As Draco settled back down, lying on his back, feeling the soreness of his muscles, thinking that they should have showered, and now he couldn't find it in himself to do so, Harry shifted slightly.
"Damn right I will,” Harry agreed. “So just
"Oh,” Harry said lamely, his face falling a bit. “I guess.”
"You sure you won’t use the Floo? You’ll be fine walking by yourself back home?” Andromeda asked just as Harry closed the door behind him. He’d just made Teddy take his afternoon nap, and the house was finally quiet.
"As soon as we sensed the Aurors, I should have run. I could have outrun them, could have been far, far away from here. But I looked at you, and I could see you were afraid of that exact thing. You had this stupid look on your face. And I hesitated. Just for a second.” Draco's eyes met Harry's. “And now I'm here. Stuck in these four walls, with nothing to do but think about how fucked up my entire life has been.”
Harry’s heart ached.
"I don't have one,” Malfoy said after a few seconds, his eyes fixed on the opposite wall of the cave they had stopped in for the night.
It was dark now, but both of their eyes had adjusted to the dimness, so that Harry could clearly see the look on Draco's face, and keenly feel the hurt, before any words were spoken. “Us?” Draco echoed, incredulously. “What hallucination are you living in? How can there be any kind of 'us' while my life is restricted to this cell? You should be happy, this way, you could get the relationship you want.”
It was a typical day. Draco was happy-not that it was obvious to anyone but Harry –because it had been four weeks since his release, and The Wizengamot had declared that he could start his training at the Auror department immediately in order to help catch the remaining Death Eaters on the loose. Harry decided to join as well. They had spent the majority of the day alternatively sparring and lying flat on the ground, exhausted, until their easy banter turned to insults, and a fight resulted. Towards the end, their fighting had taken a different twist, leading to an extremely satisfying make out session.
"Get off,” Malfoy grumbled, prising Harry's fingers away from the cloth of his shirt. “I'm not going anywhere.” Harry's grip loosened minutely, so that Malfoy could pull his hands away, but Harry didn't move out of his space.
"That doesn't,” Harry paused to latch onto Draco's neck, intent on leaving a mark, “make any sense.” He lifted himself briefly, trying to get some air between them as he felt his skin start to stick to his clothes, but fell back down quickly, unwilling to let there be any distance between him and Draco.
"Draco,” Harry started, tipping his head slightly and stilling the movement of his hand momentarily. “Have you ever had sex?”
Potter was holding a white cardboard box in one hand and grinning. “Good news! I brought you onigiri!” Draco said nothing, not even looking in Potter's direction. Harry ploughed on, unaffected. “I remembered when we ate at this Japanese restaurant and you gobbled it down in one go. I was also going to get you ramen, but then I ate it on the way over, so then I was going to get you dango, but I remembered you don't like sweet things! So I I went back to my flat and made you some onigiri and brought it straight here.” Potter paused for a few seconds, facing the bars that marked the front of Draco's cell.”I heard that you might be getting moved to a different cell. Might have a bigger window. That'd be cool, right?”
The pounding in his head was making spots dance in his vision. Had he been waiting for someone? (
"Quit it,” Harry snapped, shaking Malfoy's arm roughly, oozing dangerous, addictive warmth into every part of Malfoy's body he touched. “Stop pretending you don't care about me when it's obvious that you do.” Malfoy looked as though he was about to interrupt, but Harry ignored him. “Do you think I'm blind? That I can't see the way you've been looking at me ever since we started travelling around?”
Draco's cell was pleasant enough. Grey walls, stone floor, one high, barred window. A bed in one corner with a thin mattress supported by a rickety bedframe. The other corner held a sink and toilet. It was clean, and he didn't have to share.
Having managed to find an extra mouthful of rice by scraping the bottom of the pan and thus ensuring he was probably eating metal, Harry spoke with his mouth full. “'S'not my fault you suck at hunting.”
Harry stood slowly, not saying anything for a few moments and staring at the back of Malfoy's shirt. “You don't have to push me away all the time, Malfoy,” he said after a little while before placing his hand on Malfoy,
Harry wanted to say. Except he already knew the answer.
"Harry, what's going on?” she asked, falling into step with him, noting the frown on his face.
Blinking sleepily, the image of Harry came into focus, looking at him seriously. From the light, Draco surmised that it wasn't quite morning, or at least, quite a bit earlier than he usually woke up. He didn't recall waking up the previous night, so assumed it had passed nausea free, and was grateful. Even his ever present headache that now refused to be calmed by anything was hardly pronounced, just a quite throbbing that was easily ignored.
On the table, the drink was waiting. He was supposed to have it, Draco knew. That was part of his treatment. (
Brushing off the insult, Harry looked intently at Malfoy. “I'm sorry you don't have any favourite memories,” he said quietly, almost a whisper. “But things'll be different now. Starting from now on.”
"I would for you.”
Frowning, Draco nodded, watching as Pansy opened the box, pulling out a familiar flask which she put on the table.
"Says who?” Draco asked darkly. He was standing in front of the bars, staring through at Harry. “You? You think I give a damn?”
"Draco. Look, I get it, but listen to me-”
"Just, because. We might not have that much time.” The last few words came out in a rush, and Harry brought his face up to look Draco in the eye, desperation lacing his features.
"How can I not?” Draco answered back, his voice harsh. “Do you think it's nice to look back on my life and see everything I've done?” He laughed cruelly. “You have no idea.”
When they left the flat, Draco locked the door, making Harry smile a little at the normality. How long had he wanted to see Draco outside the confines of his cell? Now, he could. Even if there would be consequences, for now it was hard not to feel happy.
"But,” Draco frowned, feeling disjointed, “you always stay and make sure I have the drink.”
"That hurt, idiot,” Draco said into Harry's hair, arms wrapped around him as he rubbed the small of his back before pushing his top up and moving against skin.
It was so unfair. The rest of their journey back had been...incredible. Amongst other things, Harry had discovered that sleeping rough was a lot more enjoyable when you had another person to wind yourself around, and even if Malfoy grumbled about it, he didn't push him away. Much. And although increasingly distracted, they had explored...a little. Harry didn't think Malfoy would have minded but he hadn't wanted to rush, and tried to set them a slow pace- they'd only just managed a tentative companionship, he didn't want to run the risk of destroying their already shaky relationship.
"Really?” Harry asked, having not expected such a confession.
The heavy door on the other side of the bars of Draco's cell swung open with a screech, causing him to glance up from the bed he was sitting on.
"I know,” Harry said grimly, glaring at the ground. “It's not like he could do anything with his magic currently suppressed anyway. They're doing it to punish him.”
"I don't
"Hannah Abbott.” Harry frowned. “Hufflepuff. Same year as us. Ringing any bells?”
Harry left.
Eventually, by the time the moon was high in the sky, covering everything in a cool glow, Draco stopped in front of the doorstep.
"Not that,” Draco shook his head, knowing what Harry was thinking. “You wouldn't have convinced me if I didn't want to come. At the Ministry, when we arrived.”
"Yeah but, you were stuck in prison, and you were right it-”
Watching Malfoy now, even from the back, the light from the window blurring the side of his silhouette, seeing the way his shoulders were curled in, ever so slightly and the way his muscles shifted as he moved, was enough to make Harry's mouth dry with want.
Sighing, Harry stopped rolling on the balls of his feet and placed his hands on the desk, leaning so that he was more on the Minister’s level. When he spoke, his voice was quiet and serious. “He didn’t do it because he wanted to. He was left with no choice. He’s just like me, still too young yet forced to do things bigger than us.” Harry didn't have to mention who he was talking about. It had been obvious this was about Malfoy as soon as Harry had stepped into the Minister’s office. Everything had been about Malfoy since the two of them had returned.
Draco's eyes widened at the question, especially given their current position, but there was nothing sexual in the touches, no tension in the air or hunger in Harry's eyes, just gentle, gentle curiosity. He considered for a second before answering. “No.”
Draco gave a brusque shake of his head.
"Right.” Harry coughed again. “Well. We could. Then. Uhm.” The hand that had fallen out of Draco's hair when he sat up was clenched in his lap. Harry stared at the coffee table.
And then, just as he was mapping the freckles on Draco’s face, he remembered what he kept on trying to say a while ago.
He was about to ask again, although he didn't have a clue what the hell he was asking, when Harry spoke.
"It's just a headache,” Draco said, when Harry found him sitting on the edge of the sofa, head cradled between his hands. But Harry knew Draco, and knew that for him to have admitted there was a problem meant he was in a lot of pain. Harry knew this, not because he was the one who healed Draco's wounds, sat by his bedside and traced the scars with the tip of one finger, but because he did the exact same thing.
"Why?” Draco asked, watching Harry's expression carefully.
“Harry. I remember all of that. So don’t worry.”
But that didn't make up for the times that Draco went quiet, tucked his head down and said in a small, wavering, furious voice:
"Harry,” Draco said very slowly and clearly, “I won't forget you. I promise.” Harry produced a watery smile and pulled on their joined hands, tugging Draco towards him. He came willingly, obligingly letting Harry wind around him, his warm, somewhat clammy skin press against his, and Harry's scent engulfed him.
Harry wondered what it felt like to walk away from your home. But he didn't speak as he followed Draco out, afraid to break the silence between them, leaving Draco to do so when he was ready.
Since then, Harry had been keeping a careful eye on Draco, but had noticed nothing abnormal in his actions. Although Pansy had warned that it was a progressive treatment, with the effects accumulating towards the end of the term, Harry couldn't help but hope that there was something wrong with it, and Draco would remain unaffected.
And that meant he couldn't touch Malfoy.
Harry curled his lip in disgust. His previous fear about the agreement had all but disappeared, as he listened to Draco speak. Harry had never heard him speak like this, Draco was rarely vocal about his feelings (
“It’s not only the fact that you lose any semblance of common sense when it comes to that prick,” Ron chimed in, and Harry saw Hermione gave her boyfriend a grateful look. “It’s also because you want to shag the daylights out of him. I don’t know who to pity between the both of you, honestly-”
One sunny afternoon, as Pansy was leaving the apartment that Harry and Draco shared, she was surprised to see Harry sitting on the banister that ran around the apartment block, one leg pulled up and the other hanging down. What surprised her was that when he saw her, he raised a finger to his lips, prompting her to stay quiet.
Harry snorted. “You can be my caretaker if you want to, Ron. Follow me around and report back to Hermione. Surely that would be a fascinating chore.”
"Don't ask me stupid questions,” Malfoy said coldly. “We're not friends, you don't understand anything about me.”
"Yes, that makes sense.” She scribbled something on her paper. In front of her was a large grey box, stamped onto which Draco recognised the Ministry symbol. He tilted his head, something niggling at the back of his mind. “I'll make up your drink.”
"The Wizengamot refuses to release him until he proves himself, as I've told you before.” Shacklebolt tried and failed to be stern, and landed on consolatory.
"You-Draco, you don't have to,” he said, seizing onto that little bit of hope. “Listen, I can talk to Shacklebolt, it might take a while, but you don't have to-”
The journey back home lasted for two weeks, twice as long as it should have. They could’ve used the Portkey that the Ministry had given Harry, or they might have chosen to Apparate several times across the continent for convenience sake. But Harry stuck through with his word.
“Oh come off it Luna!” Ron said “Malfoy was a dick all through school, he probably leapt at the chance to be just like his precious Daddy. Get branded by that madman and become an even bigger arse than he was before.”
“Honestly its fucking pitiful, it’s not like he’s gonna get the kiss.”
It had been nearly two months since the battle, two months since the war had ended and Harry had defeated Voldemort. There had been funerals, so many funerals and Harry had gone to them all. He had spoken at many, asked by family members who thought he would know what to say. People always came up and thanked him for coming, thanked him for everything he’d done. Harry knew they meant well but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he could of done more, if only he’d been a little stronger, a little faster, if he’d just put all the pieces together just a little quicker he could of stopped them from suffering at all.
As the five figures watched on in amazement images started flashing in front of their eyes. Slowly at first but gradually gaining speed until they only had enough time for the image to sink in before they were moving onto the next.
“Well Mr Granger the threat from the radical group known as the Death Eaters has indeed passed and it’s now safe for those in danger, such as yourselves, to return to normal life. But we have no idea what, if any, curses were placed on your residence or the surrounding area during the war. These could be anything from simple tracking spells to highly lethal hexes that could be triggered by the presence of certain people. As we speak Ministry Aurours”
After a minutes silence, in which the two friends took turns moving their respective pieces, Dean turned to Harry “You alright Harry? You’ve seemed a bit off all night.”
Mr Granger gave them both a small nod. “It’s good to see you both again boys, I’m glad we’ve been given the chance.” He said rather gruffly, the note of accusation in his voice wasn’t hard to miss.
“Err… Hi Mr and Mrs Granger, how are you both?” Ron asked the two senior Grangers whilst simultaneously trying to shrink into his jumper.
The Auror took out his wand and pointed it at the magical device. “Alright, go” he instructed.
At first he didn’t think anything had happened. But then the green liquid in the globe started to glow, brighter and brighter until it was practically pulsing with light. It rose into the air an inch or so above Harry’s hand and the two golden rings started to spin erratically around it. For the briefest moment Harry had the strangest feeling as he stared at the floating object, it felt almost as if he was looking into a mirror. The feeling only lasted a second however as the next thing he knew the ball had sped off towards the house. It paused for a second as the front door opened of its own accord, allowing it in, and then it was gone.
“Stan Shunpike though! He was obviously imperiused. I mean come on Hermione, the guy’s a bus conductor.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone would seriously think Stan believed in blood supremacy.
