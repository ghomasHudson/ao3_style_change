“Not right now, right now we cuddle and rest.  That was rather intense.”  With that  he wrapped his arms around me and we were encircled by his wings.  I fell into a deep and dreamless sleep almost instantly.  The feeling of peace was overwhelming.
They were saved by the sound of the floo. The pair ran in and whisked Harry and Draco away before Molly could see them. “What’s going on, mate?”  Harry asked, confused.  Draco just held his hand, looking uncomfortable, his face back to his old Malfoy mask that most would see as snobby. “Aren’t we allowed in?”
He yawned adorably, still trying to wake up.  “I have plans with Hermione later anyway.  She wanted to go shopping for school.  I should jump in the shower.  Did you want to join me?”  I bit my bottom lip in response to his blush and nodded once.  He held his hands up for me to help him up.  Instead I leaned over and picked him up, making him laugh while I brought him to the shower.
“The plan was always for me to get Teddy once my life settled down a bit.  It just so happens to be that Draco is settled down with me.”  Harry smiled again as he thought of his godson.    “Draco was aware of that before we decided to get married.”
a lighter heat and worry
“Damn slut, you moved fast.  I’m leaving now, you get to deliver the message to the buyers. Good riddance.”  I could still smell the nervousness emanating from him as he backed out of the door.  I just focused on the idea of the burrow to try to help my mate ignoring, for the moment, the feelings of betrayal.
I could hear him open the soap, feeling every inch of my skin as he lathered it over me.  He lightly massaged the muscles as he went.  Next he gently placed my head under the spray.  I could smell the sandalwood scent of the shampoo as he gently washed my hair.  The tips of his fingers felt electric.  My whole body felt alive, my eyes still closed, my hands holding onto the wall of the shower.
“Your godfathers are coming home today.  They expect to meet me apparently.  I was thinking it might be as good a time as any to do the obligatory family meeting.  Even if there was a chance that she would react badly, my mother saw how much you mean to me when I felt the bond flicker. Even she could not be cold enough to hate you now.  What do you think?  I don’t want to force you, especially with the chaos of the day.”
“We could take some time to ‘de-stress’, but I’m so tired I just want to lay down.”  Harry said as he yawned.  This brought a yawn from Draco as well.  They just laughed it off. Draco took his own suit jacket off and helped Harry off with his.  They both kick off their shoes, Draco putting them away neatly.  Harry strips down to boxers and throws himself on the bed.  Draco looks at him for a moment, following suit quickly.  He pulled the brunette into his chest, feeling his breathing.  “This is certainly enough for me as long as you are with me”
I had to admit I liked the sound of shopping, though I prefer classic to extravagant.  “Alright.  I think after a shower we start on the nursery.  We don’t tell anyone until after we are actually expecting though.”
“What are the stakes for the bet?” He asks with a glint in his eyes.
“Come on boys, take a seat, I’m sure this will be an interesting story.” Molly gestured to a pair of chairs that were open.  Harry took in George’s grin and Arthur’s confusion.  He was a little upset to see Ginny’s hostility, but it wasn’t completely a shock either.  He knew she had had a crush on him once, even though she’d accepted that he just couldn’t be with her. He also knew that she did not have any good things to say about anyone named Malfoy.
“How long has this been going on?”  Hermione asked, though the question caught in her throat for a moment.
“Well, anyway, I was looking through my mother’s things and I found this.”  He pulled a photo album from his jacket.  “I thought you might want it.”  He handed it to me gently.  I just held it, afraid that if it held what I suspected I would cry.
“Yes, Remus, Sirius, this is Draco.  My mate.”  Draco was tense.  I could sense his nervousness through the bond, but he masked it well behind an arrogant smirk even his scent gave nothing away.  I looked to the floor for a moment in an effort not to give away that I noticed.
Rays of sunlight broke through the curtains, hitting an old couch. It’s battered, blue fabric had seen better days.  It also hit the green eyes of my mate.  Seeming to light him up from inside.  All conversation dropped from my mind as I stared into their emerald depths.  My trance was lost when Harry unknowingly moved away from the light.  Shaking my head to clear it, I caught Sirius laughing quietly at me.  My skin could not hide the blush creeping up my neck.
“As for me, my friends new that I was gay a long time ago.  Partially because of Harry to be honest.  I never hid it from my family either.  During the trials there were far more important things to worry about.”  Draco added.
“It’s just as hard for me you know.” He whispered into my ear, his breath causing the hair on the back of my neck to raise.  He lowered his nose to my neck slowly, breathing me in.  “Your scent is stimulating.”  He whispered as if he had read my mind.  I felt goosebumps on my arms and an immediate reaction from my crotch.  I did say slow however, so I just shuffled my feet and ignored it.
Draco looked miserable.  Harry was trying to figure out how to start when Molly dished out food to everyone.  “So, what’s been going on in your life Harry, you’ve been gone for a month.”  She said with a reassuring nod.  He knew she was trying to nudge him into talking.
Harry’s P.O.V.
Mrs. Weasly looked understanding, but sad.  “There’s a lot of people against it in the wizarding world as well, as you know Draco, you won’t find that judgement here.  Harry is like my son, so now you are like my son in law, and just so you know you are given a clean slate now. Even knowing who you were, we understand that you were a child put in the middle of something you should never have dealt with.  You are welcome here..  Now, enough with all of this, eat up everyone.”  Draco looked around the table and with the exception of Ginny, everyone looked like they agreed.  Even Ginny had lost most of her anger, she seemed resigned to him. Draco knew that his mother was okay with him, but the letter had been pretty cold. He felt a warmth here that he would never have gotten at his own home.  He gave Harry a small smile and squeezed his hand once more before digging into his food.
The faire was almost over by the time we woke up.  Draco assured me that there was more fun to be had after hours.  After making ourselves presentable we went to join Pansy at her tent.  "Alright Potter, you are new here so pay attention.  After hours in the adult section we let go.  This group is a family.  If you insult one person it will make the rounds fast.  As long as people consent and are of age, do not interfere.  No shaming will be tolerated.  Now boys, let's go find the party. "  She took each of us by one arm, and led us into the field of tents.
not the best chapter I've written, but.. wanted to get something up.
As Harry stepped onto the steps outside, the crowd quickly grew silent.  Their eyes staring as though they were trying to see his soul.  He lifted his wand to his throat and called for attention. He kept his gaze over the people, not looking directly at anyone. Draco stood behind him mostly hidden in a shadow.
“Well, between Remus and your mother our wedding will be taken care of.  It would give us something to do.  My next heat will be in a few weeks.  Think we have time before then?”
Harry huffed in annoyance. I just rubbed his back as I considered my reply. “Yes, your dad got away with a lot in school, but he also came close to dying every year. We aren’t exactly going to let you follow his example.” When he went to speak I just held up my hand. “Don’t follow mine either. I can guarantee you don’t want to go where I almost went. We are not going to be any harder on you than your classmates, but you are expected to keep yourself out of trouble.”
“Well, how about you tell him the being gay part first, and then we come in and deal with the rest?  Helps break some of the suspense, and doesn’t leave Hermione doing all of it herself.” The blond stated.
"As the only friend of hers willing to try it I learned with her.  We made a good team, but, I knew I was a veela, it didn't seem right to use my allure for money.  As my mate it all went to you while I was performing.  I don't think I had full control of it, as we both obviously became a bit, .. well, a bit too into it."  At my nod he smiled.  "Okay, shower, cuddling, and snacks for the rest of the day to recover."
Draco’s P.O.V.
Draco’s P.O.V.
Harry’s P.O.V.
“Thank you for sticking around.”  I said with a soft sigh.  “Is what Molly said true though?  Am I somehow dangerous to her alpha kids?”  I asked sadly.
“Um, well I guess it would be nice.”  Harry answered distractedly.  I noticed that he was trying to avoid having our eyes meet.
He looked down at his trainers self consciously.  “I’m more than okay with it, though, can we do this slowly?  Maybe actually go on some dates before we decide.  I don’t want to rush into it.”
I didn’t want to wait anymore.  The connection was too strong.  His tongue, his breath, his scent.  I felt a need I could not explain.  I rushed to get my jeans off, helping him with his own when he took too long.  He pulled away from my neck long enough to come up for another kiss.  His hands wandered down, palming my erection.  Which could have finished me right there.  A throaty whimper from me had him gazing into my eyes again, looking for permission. I nodded.   He ran kisses from my neck down, sucking bruises along my hip bones. I felt his tongue playfully lick the drop from the tip of my cock.  He grabbed lube from the bedside table and began to prep me.  It took all of my self control not to rush him, not to slam back against his fingers.  I could not keep another whimper from coming out.  “I need to know now, do you want a mating mark?  It will be the last part, marking us as mates.  I am willing to wait if you prefer.”  I looked deeply into his eyes, feeling a deep sense of safety and love. Every instinct in me wanted this connection NOW.  I nodded and smiled breathlessly as he finally entered me.  I wrapped my legs around his waist pulling him in further.  Encouraging him to move with more speed.  This felt primal.  I could feel what he was feeling, and by the look on his face I would guess he was feeling me too.  As we both finished he leaned in, biting just under my scent glands.  He then encouraged me to bite him in the same place.  It should have felt strange, instead it felt natural.  It was followed by a tingling down my spine as my wings came out.  I opened my eyes to see that his had as well.  “Baby, they’re beautiful.”  He whispered into my ear, touching the feathers reverently.
“I bet you he will be in Gryffindor, he reminds me of you. Well Love, I think we should find ourselves some privacy. It seems like a waste that we haven’t done anything on the train.” Harry’s only response was a raised eyebrow. I say something similar every year. “Alright let’s go pretend to be responsible adults and find the other teachers. .”
Harry’s P.O.V.
I was in tears, crying into my mates shoulder as he was wearing nothing but his boxers.  We were both still kneeling on the floor when my dads walked in.
Reporters surrounded the steps of the ministry.  Their excitement felt tangible to the men as they waited.  Draco kept his Malfoy mask on, including the sneer. Magical cameras and quills readied and waiting for their moment. The voices were deafening, doing nothing to help Harry’s nerves.  The press jumped at the chance for a new savior story.  They gossiped among themselves trying to guess what this was about.  Draco was blending in; well, as much as he could with the Malfoy bloodline’s   Many of the conversations he heard seemed to be along the lines of Harry being in a relationship with Ginevra.  Some more creative stories were being bandied about. Like Harry looking for new followers for a cult or going back to teach potions at Hogwarts, as if he was ever any good at potions.  After a little while he made his way to the room where Harry waited.  He had heard what he wanted to hear, no one had any clue.
“Veela did not originally try to assimilate, so for a Renaissance faire I prefer to keep my wings out.  Even though veela are not rare, most keep their wings hidden now, so this seems to get the kids excited.  Expect a lot of people asking for pictures.”  I could not help but look at him.  The whole effect was amazing.  His shoulder length blond hair was loosely tied back, his traditional smirk giving him a haughty yet regal appearance.
“Mother, something is wrong. I felt a flicker in the bond, now it feels faded.”  I said worriedly. I looked at her with the question on my face that I knew she’d have no answer for.  They were going shopping, he shouldn’t have been alone.  I was starting to feel panic as the need to protect my mate was struggling for control.  I needed to do something quickly.
“No, Dudley, let him come.  I was not trying to cause a scene, but if he wants to show everyone how abusive he is to his own nephew I say let him.   Yes ‘sir’,  My mate is male, how observant. I have a family now.  One that actually cares.  We own a house of our own, we have the ability to travel the world.  I may even be pregnant right now.  You didn’t beat me down.  I am a happy, mated, veela.  I doubt you have ever known this kind of happiness. I pity you.”   If I just happened to pull my mate down into a kiss after saying that, who could really blame me?.  “I came to let this part of my past go.  I am not afraid of you any more.”
“Are you planning on having more children?”
“Will it help if I went instead?  I wish I could avenge you like that.  I wasn’t able to do anything to the Weasley’s, but maybe I could get one back for you with your relatives.  I am not much good to you if I end up in jail though.”  Draco pulled a small chuckle out of me with that.
“Thank you Dudley.  I appreciate how hard it was to apologize.  I forgive you.  I can’t forget nine years of torture, but, I know your father was the instigator.  Have a good life.”  Realizing that this was his cue to leave he walked away sadly.
I kept my arm around Harry’s waist while leading him over to a large bay window overlooking a large tree lined garden at the back of the property.  “Love, if you want this one it’s yours.”  He smiled openly at me.  I immediately leaned in to kiss him.  The kiss was interrupted by a forced cough from Remus.  I laughed softly as we parted.  Harry’s face was red and he was looking at his shoes.  “Alright, I think it’s time to get the paperwork out of the way.”
Draco’s lips stopped my rambling.  “You are my mate.  I am okay with this.  We are together for the rest of our lives.  If you feel like starting now would help you feel whole, I’m on board that’s why I didn’t stop you during.”   He kept his eyes locked on mine as he spoke.  Then playfully licked the tip of my nose.  “Besides, you will thrill my mother if you are pregnant already.  She’ll love you just for that.”
He turned over, pushing me onto my back.  He sucked a trail of bruises down my neck.  “Um, I think the embarrassment is gone.”  He shut me up with his mouth.  I felt my own body responding now.  My mate's heat had caused my rut to begin.  This is the first time I have felt the thickening at the base of my cock that preceded a knot.  I did not have time to focus on it, as my mate was making my body react to every move he made.  Something as small as a finger moving down my chest had me feeling sparks of electricity.
“We’d better get going, I want to rush right to getting you out of those clothes.”  He said as I turned around.  I laughed and shook my head.
As Hermione was checking one last book store I decided to enjoy the weather and wait at a fountain nearby.  There were fewer people, but somehow I still felt a prickly feeling running down my spine. I felt too out in the open, too alone.  I was about to call Draco when I smelled a sour, yet familiar scent and then everything went black.
Draco’s P.O.V.
“Technically, a “mated pair” is not married, there is a lot of technical mumbo jumbo to basically say that Veela mates are less than fully bonded unless we take that extra step.  I want it all with you.  I want no chance that anyone sees us as anything but fully bonded.”   He said as he placed the ring on my finger.  I looked carefully at it.  A simple silver band, with an emerald stone embedded in the center.  It was beautiful, but simple, not something I’d be afraid to wear.
Draco laughed at that, “you guys and that invisibility cloak got away with so much more than I ever imagined during school.   I used to wonder how you guys snuck around the castle so much without getting caught. I wish I knew I had that much attention, maybe I wouldn’t have tried so hard to get you to see me.. They are right though, love, I never had to tell you how I took my tea.  You already knew.”  The glint in his silver eyes made Harry smile brightly.
“I’m not sure.  They are generally very personal.  I do know that with some bonds they can communicate just by thought, so I would not discount them.  Show up, if he does not show, you’ll have to do it the old fashioned way and search, or just wait for school to start again.
I just rolled my eyes and sigh. I just want my partner, I don’t care about second gender at all. She is sure that somehow my transition will straighten me out or that I will luck out and find one of the rare male omegas.  If I am right about who it is, I will be happy regardless as long as he is willing.  I am anticipating an interesting conversation when that happens.  “Mother, thank you for trying to be helpful.  I am not closing myself off to my potential mate, just refusing to go right into having kids, even for you.”
“No, they have not heard from anyone but Charlie since it happened.  They had not been living at the burrow.  They could not understand why it all happened.  I was asked to apologize on behalf of them and Charlie, and to let you know to watch out.”
Sirius gave me a disappointed smirk, leaving me to wait on Remus to respond.  He took a deliberate breath before deciding on what to say.  “Well, it was great until we found out that so much had been going on here.  You should have let us know when you changed.  You have a mate and we don’t find out until you are kidnapped? Really Harry.”
Hermione managed to get me back to the flat I shared with my godfathers and held a damp cloth on my forehead as I cried through the pain.  “It will be okay Harry, you’ll be through it soon. Are your dads going to be here?  I’m sure Remus can help you. I can’t believe Molly would turn you away like that.”
“Oh come on honey, we were like this once.  I am sure Harry was not thrilled with being around us at that point.”  Hermione rested a hand on Ron’s knee, shaking her head slowly as she remembered them when they started dating.
I felt the thrum of positive energy from my bond as I watched Vernon’s face turn deep red.  Dudley pushed him back towards the front again, while telling him he shouldn’t be making a scene.  My uncle's mouth just kept open and closing like a fish on land.  When he finally gave up and stood where Dudley had put him, my cousin came back.  “He deserved that.  Harry, I am glad that you found what you needed. I do believe my mother regretted the way she treated you.  She was jealous of her sister, but I know she did love her deep down.  Together my parents were toxic.  I really am sorry for my part in it, and if you ever need anything from me I am here.”
“Fuck.”  Really what else could I say to that?  I noticed Draco’s fingers gripping the edge of the table.  His scent became overwhelming.  I tried soothing his anger with my voice, but I finally resorted to putting his face against my scent gland.  His anger slowly died down to a simmer.  Hermione wisely stayed silent during this interaction.  Gently, I let go of my mate, moving my chair closer to him.  “Do they know anything else?”  I asked hesitantly.
We spent the rest of the day cuddling in a pile of blankets and pillows.  I kept finding myself sniffing his neck.  As I laid my head back onto his chest I heard him sigh. “What’s on your mind?”
“Yeah, I know, would she mind if I added a plus one to dinner?”  He asked tiredly. “I don’t want to make her think about the past too much, but, I agree she needs to know. She may even decide we are getting another ceremony just because she wasn’t there.”
“If those responsible show up around me, it won’t be me that has to watch out.”  Draco growled.  I knew that he had been angry that he never got to avenge me, but an upset veela can be a dangerous foe.
“We both knew we couldn’t hide forever, being us we would eventually be caught while out in public.  I’d rather it not seem like we were embarrassed of each other, or being gay. We’ve both survived worse.  Plus, I have the savior to protect me.” the blond teased, rolling forward to dodge the playful swat to his ass.
Damn, part of me regrets that we had to leave the house.  His scent had to have matched mine for intensity.  It’s hard to be too upset about it while seeing his face light up to the sights around him though.  Harry has been watching a harlequin act for a few minutes.  The man had walked by us on seven foot stilts, dressed in Italian Renaissance garb.  Immediately Harry’s attention was caught.  I am enjoying the looks on my mate’s face, and the feeling of our joined hands even more than the show.
These tents varied in size and shape, the one thing that seemed uniform was a lot of color and people going in and out of tents.  Many stayed in their character garb, others chose to change to something more comfortable.  There were people playing instruments by the fire, others had started their own dance, others singing along as they could.  Once we were introduced, though some already appeared to know Draco, we were taken is as one of the group.  There were stories told, from things that had happened today, and others that had happened since they had done previous faires together.  It was hard not to smile, this really did feel like a close knit group.  The smiling turned to blushing as Pansy decided to let them all in on Draco's turn dancing.  She even made sure they knew that my own scent was noticeable from the stage after he started.  This encouraged them the group we were with to lure Draco and I over to where people had started dancing.  I am not much of a dancer, but, when my mate asked me to dance with him I didn't have the heart to refuse.  Others also joined in, but we had a bit of an audience as he danced slowly to one of the slower songs.  There was alcohol passed around pretty freely, but while we had fun, we didn't really drink enough to be drunk.  As the night wore on though, the scents of those around us started changing.  I noticed people leaving the group in pairs or more. Some would come back, but others wouldn't.  I noticed a few longing looks at Draco, but, he wasn't paying attention to any of that.  Instead of getting upset I found myself getting even closer to my mate.
He laughed behind me.  The scent of his joy overwhelmed my nervousness and caused me to stumble.  The scent was overridden by a sense of worry through the bond at my fall.  “I’m fine, your excitement made me dizzy.  Come on.”  I assured him as I began to strip teasingly into the bedroom.
“How dare you show up here you freak?” He had obviously noticed that I was holding one of Draco’s hands in my other hand though I had dropped Dudley’s hand.  “Figures, you weren’t enough of a freak already,  of course you’re a faggot as well.”
“As for my mother, she owled earlier, congratulating us, so I’d say she is happy enough.”  Draco said dryly.  He gave the reporters his trademark sneer and wrapped his arms around Harry, putting his chin on the shorter man’s shoulder..
“Draco, you need to stop saying that.  I am not good, you are not bad.  We both went through hell and back and managed to find happiness anyway.  I count this as a win.  You are brilliant, fit as hell, and underneath generations of Malfoy masks you love me.”  Harry sang the last part teasingly.  He rested his head on the blonde’s shoulder, wrapping his arm around his waist.  “We are both perfect for each other.”
“That blond guy from school?  Strange.”  She muttered.  “Veela’s have dreams of their most likely mate right before they change.  It’s not set in stone or anything, just supposedly it’s more… electric than normal relationships. An intense connection.”
“Don’t you get it Har, you are a male omega.  It is not a common thing anymore.  Your body is growing a womb on top of your veela traits.”
“Just noticing the differences from before.  Nothing much really.”  I pulled him into my arms so we were both looking into the reflection.  “I am still not sure how you could suddenly got over how rude I used to be.”
“Too early, I’m going to take a shower love.” I kiss his lips gently and squeeze his hand in solidarity. I undress in the hall as I walk back to our room, smirking as I feel his eyes on me the whole way. By the time I was showered and dressed in tight charcoal gray trousers and silver gray button down the argument had apparently ended. I found my boys in the kitchen as they worked together to make breakfast. “I take it we are done arguing now?” I ask while laughing. “Did you give him the pranks, Teddy?”
“So, you like this one?” Sirius asked, looking bored.  It was obvious that Harry was in love with the house.  I kept my face blank, but it was a nice choice.  The fourth house we looked at seemed far more suited to us, even though it was nothing like what I grew up in,
My mother was looking at me fondly when I woke up.  “I couldn’t help it, I rarely see you smile anymore.  Must have been some dream.”  She said with a knowing smirk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do actually.  Pansy does an act at a faire.  I think you would enjoy the Renaissance faire.  It will require some clothes, which I have already bought for you.  Will you go with me?”
“Where are you?”  I could not stop the deep growl from coming out with the question.  As soon as she told me where they had been my wings came out automatically and I left the manor.  Every once in a while there was a twinge in the bond, but I could not get any sense of place or emotion from it.  I had no more control of my thoughts, finding my mate was priority. I ignored all looks from the strangers on the streets when I landed near Hermione.
“Don’t lie.  If they ask again we tell them.  If they don’t we speak up when we know for sure.  I would never ask you to lie.”  A few strands of blond hair covered his eye.  “Same goes with my mother.”
Harry’s P.O.V.
“Eventually, yes, we both want more children.”  They both answered, chuckling.
Draco’s P.O.V.
I went to sleep early, as I had since my transformation.  I kept hoping to get more from my dreams than just the green eyes.  I apparently got lucky this time.  “Is this really a dream?”  He asked me, blinking owlishly.  He was exactly who I had been hoping for.  His messy black hair, jeans and a jumper.  Looks exactly the same as at school.
“If I had known in school that you were gay, I might have tried a different tact.”  Draco shrugged again.  “I used to dream about what would have happened if I asked you to the ball.  You, all dressed up remained one of my favorite fantasies.”
Well, this chapter was difficult.  I could not make myself really happy with it.. It has been completely rewritten about ten times.  This one feels better than all the others.. (I apparently couldn't cheat and have no contact with the bad guys)  Hopefully it doesn't suck for ya. lol
I turned the water on, stripping slowly as I waited for it to heat up.  Gray eyes not leaving my body until after I walk into the spray.  It was only a moment before he joined me, water dripping down the blond locks as he gently pushed me to the wall and our mouths met.  I closed my eyes, wanting the feeling to take over my body.
I started waking up to the sounds of movement and conversation in the apartment.  I still had Draco’s wings wrapped around me, so really wanted nothing more than to curl up and fall back asleep.  The creak of the bedroom door opening and the disgruntled sigh from Sirius stopped that from happening. I gently kissed my mates lips, while nudging his leg with my knee. “Baby, they are here.  It’s time to get up.”  He slowly pulled his wings back, letting me get up.
“I think that is a good idea, love.  I think, since you are feeling it already we should go rest, and you can nest if you need.  Finding a house will wait until after.  I will just make sure there is food and water set up.”
I decided to go to bed early.  Melancholy wearing me down.  Draco stayed up, no doubt working on plans for the dinner he wanted to set up with our friends.  My mind was still spinning with thoughts of a baby that I couldn’t shake.  At some point sleep overtook me where my dreams kept the thoughts going.
“Really?”  She sighed.  “What do you want me to do?  Tell him before you come over or support you as you tell him?”
“I’m not unbonded.” I spoke gruffly.  I wanted to control the conversation, make him realize that even as an omega I was stronger.  I held my collar away from my healing mark.  At Ron’s hesitation, I decided to keep going.  “I doubt that these buyers will like that now, will they?  I doubt they are going to let your family get away with the double cross.  You better be  really good at hiding, because I doubt they will care which members of your family were involved when they look for you and that’s if you're lucky. Right now there is a very angry alpha veela who can sense where I am while I am awake.  I imagine he is thinking about ripping you apart right now.  I have nothing left to say to you, you are beneath me.”
Someday I want a relationship as close as my dads’, but, why do they need to start my first year by embarrassing me? Part of living in the school with them was making friends with the older kids, so I could not exactly pretend not to know them. I found a compartment that was free and settled in, waiting for others to arrive. This year I could meet kids my own age. I watched out the window as my dads slowly made their way to the train. I guess I should be glad they let me get on by myself. I turned from the window and focused on the potions book, hoping this sense of foreboding was nothing. Eventually a few of my friends joined me and I managed to forget about them.
Harry sighed.  “No, I have to do this.  Once it’s done I can go back to ignoring the press.”  He laughed softly.  “Is it too late to just let them catch us?”  Draco joined in a laugh, then stood up, holding out a hand for Harry.  The men stood there just looking at each other and holding hands as Harry’s breathing returned to normal.  “I guess it’s time isn’t it?”
“How did you meet Mr. Malfoy again after the trials?”
“Oh, there you are Ronald, I had wondered where you… “ Mrs. Weasley looked past her son, seeing Harry first, hand in hand with Draco. “ Harry, it’s been ages since you came for a visit. Um, I take it you have news to share?”  She hugged Harry,  trying to look happy as she noticed they still didn’t drop their held hands.   “Let’s get everyone in so you don’t have to say everything more than once, okay?”  She called the others in, Arthur sat down, not really noticing the group that had just come in.  While Ginny, and George came in with wind chapped faces, stopping dead as they noticed the assembled group.
Harry’s P.O.V.
Later, after all but Hermione had left we sat down at the table to talk.  She nervously kicked the legs of the chair beneath her.  Looking at me, she seemed to be asking for permission to speak.  Whatever she saw in my face gave her the courage to start.  “Okay, so I went to the twins’ shop.  They apparently had nothing to do with the kidnapping.  They were very upset about what happened.  “ She once again seemed to be looking at me to go on, then she sighed.  “They told me they had seen Ron around town, but he takes off at their approach.”
He sighed loudly, dropping the pencil to the desk.  As he wrapped his arm around my waist and rested his head against my stomach I brushed through his hair, attempting to bring it back into some order.   “I can’t sit around waiting for this guy to show back up. I want to take you away, but part of me knows that it is just a way of delaying whatever is going to happen.  The instinct to protect and avenge my mate is making me feel this intense energy to do something." I didn’t have any response to that so I laid his head on my shoulder, hoping my calm scent would ease his mind for the moment.
Everyone at the table just looked at each other.  “Mate, we already guessed that much.  We’ve known you long enough to notice.”  George replied to that.  He looked carefully at Harry.  Harry, knowing that he had to keep going ruffled his hair with his left hand jumping slightly when George’s eyes widened. “You have got to be joking, right?  A wedding ring?”
As we were walking back the way we came I saw something that made me gasp.  I stopped suddenly bringing Draco’s protective scent back instantly.  “What’s the matter?”  He followed my gaze to a bench where a man was sitting, looking at his hands.
awkward conversation and househunting.
Press conference.
“I’m not sure I’m ready for this.” He sighed.  I looked at him longingly.  His hair was delightfully rumpled, his clothes as well. The idea that just weeks ago I was too afraid to even talk to him, and now he was lying in my bed looking imperfect made me smile at him. I used my fingers to comb his hair mostly back into place.  “Well, I guess I should probably meet them before mother shows up.”
Dudley had moved to block his father from coming closer, and I could tell that my mate was holding himself back with an effort.  “Dad, I told them about it. Just let them be.”
“You were right by the way.”   I said as we were walking back into his flat. I had my wing around his back as we walked.  Some part of me still feeling a deep need to protect him.
“It’s nothing, just hoping he’s not late.”  He answered guiltily.  She always knew when she was being lied to, and he knew it.  “He had a pretty rough day today.  He is bringing someone with him, asked me if it was okay earlier.  I figured it would be fine.”
He took a deep breath.  “Okay, so, I’ve been hiding something for quite awhile.  I’ve been meaning to tell you, but, it just never seemed the time with everything that happened.  So, I’m gay.”
“He’s not in heat yet, he’s just transitioning.  Why would you say he was disappointing?  You have always treated him like a son’” The girl speaks up, a look of agitation as she notices the sadness on my face.  “He’s still Harry.”
I held Harry for hours as we cuddled in bed.  His fingers lightly stroking the sensitive skin of my inner arm.  He seemed to be in his own little world until he looked at me with a determined glint in his eye.  “I want to go.”  I did not need to ask what he meant, so I just gave him a reassuring smile.  “Dudley is the only blood family I have left.  I am tired of fearing them.  I want to show them that not only have I survived, but found my own family and thrived.  I want them to know that they didn’t beat me.  I have you, my dads, and between us we do not ever have to worry about money.  It’s time to show them who I really am.”
If he was trying to make me laugh it worked.  I handed him a cup of tea,   “Oh Gods, thanks Love.”   He took a slow sip before putting it down and grabbing my hand.  “I wanted to take care of you.  You were perfect.  I do have one question though, “ he said,  biting his lower lip and shaking a long strand of blond hair out of his eye.  “How dead are we when the dads find out?”
“What the hell?  That’s why you left for so long.  How could you keep this from us for so long?”  He was starting to get angry.  “We have always trusted you.  I can even deal with you and the ferret, uh, sorry Malfoy.  Honestly we all knew you both were way too obsessed with each other, so this isn’t that crazy.  You hid it from us though.  You’ve never hidden such a big thing before.  It kind of hurts Harry.”
“I’m not pregnant.  I found out yesterday.”  I wasn’t quite sure how to react.  I could tell that there was more he wanted to say so I just took his hands and waited.  “I…”  He shook his head as if to force the words out.  “Finding out should have been a relief , but instead I felt crushed.”  A tear escaped his eye.  His scent subtly turned sour and acidic.  I wrapped him in close to me and let him cry.
“You have what you need, right?”  Sirius asked, with noticeable embarrassment.
Harry’s P.O.V.
Draco picked up with “Harry was sick of being a news story.  We wanted to see what we could be without an audience.  He was also afraid of how Ron would take him being gay and with me.”
Molly Weasley was excited that Harry was coming to eat with the family.  He had been gone for awhile and she wanted to finally get a chance to catch up.  The house smelled like baking bread and foods of all kinds were in the process of being made.  Ginny and George were currently outside on their brooms, Arthur was fiddling with one of his muggle tech devices at the kitchen table.  “He’s going to be here any minute, go and put that thing away.”  She admonished with a dramatic sigh.  Hermione and Ron came down from their bedroom with matching grimaces.  Hermione immediately started to help her mother in law, though she knew if she asked she would have been told not to worry about it. Arthur stood and followed his wife’s orders as always and Ron just sat down, looking around nervously. “What’s wrong Ronald?  You look worried.”
“I will be teaching potions.  It was always my best subject and yes, Harry is DADA.  They still have not had a teacher stay in the position. I can’t imagine why” The blond said jokingly.
He looked at me for a moment then shook his head.  “I’m not sure.  Is she going to hate me?”  He asked me as I felt sadness through our bond.  I could tell he was truly worried how I’d react if my mother did not like him.
“Oh, really.”  Harry kissed his husband hard, biting his lower lip as he pulled away.  “I think you should be punished for that statement.  Don’t you?”  He trailed his mouth down the blond’s neck to his chest, tracing the light scars with his teeth.  Draco’s low moans made Harry’s heart beat faster.  His tongue followed the lines of his abs.  Instead of going lower he went back up and kissed Draco, this time a lingering and gentle kiss. He then gave him an evil little smirk as he rolled away from his husband.  Draco was left to come down on his own. As Harry regretted the punishment as it punished him as well.
“Nice to meet you both.  I am sorry it had to happen the way it did.”  He sat when Remus gestured to the chairs in the kitchen.  I sat next to him, our hands were clasped.
“Before that, are you hurt? Since the bond was faded I assume you were knocked out.”  I looked him over, noticing some blood dried on the back of his head. He nodded.
To be honest, although it’s only been a few hours, it feels like days since the pain started.  I wasn’t sure why she was asking about this, but decided to answer because I was too tired to ask.  “Strangely enough, Malfoy, why?”
“Assuming I am not just having a very vivid dream, I will see you there.”  He smiled, then he was gone.
We did not have much to say in our dream that night.  He just wanted to be held as the talk about his childhood had hit him hard after the date.  It was in some ways even more intimate than talking.  Just being together in silence.  We saw each other a few more times, just us before we decided to get our friends together.  He was a bit ashamed to say he only really had one after his best friend since childhood turned his back on him, but I think he believed me when I told him that happens sometimes even without all the extreme changes he just went through.
Draco’s P.O.V
This time I was in shock to hear what Dudley had said.  I couldn’t get a word out, my mouth probably imitating Vernon’s for a moment. Draco stepped in to speak. “Thank you for stopping that scene, and I’m sure after the shock has worn off Harry will be thanking you as well.  I know his past has haunted him for a long time.  I am glad he is able to get at least one good memory to close it with.”  With that I leaned into him, my hand shaking in his.  He nodded at Dudley once, glared at Vernon who was doing his best not to notice the other mourners talking about him.  Then with his nose in the air and his beautiful yet arrogant smirk in place he led me away.
“Why did you wait this long to come out about your sexuality and your relationship?”
“Of course Harry, but, I think Ron wants to know how you want to do this.  Just bring him in and then explain, or more like we did at your house where he stayed back until you had explained most of it.  There is a bit of bad blood as you know, we don’t know what her first reaction will be. “
“I know you will understand when you meet them.  Just trust me.  I would not have hidden my relationship if I thought there was another way.  The more private we were the less chance of the press catching up.  Now that we are married we are going to give a press conference.  I did not want the public judging us until we were settled.”  After he said this Hermione jumped at the sound of the floo in the other room.  She watched as Harry nervously ran his fingers through his already messy hair, then spun his wedding ring around on his finger.  He looked once more at Hermione before letting out a squeaky “We’re in here, love.”
“It’s training, she started years ago.  I used to do it as well.”  I only received a blank expression.
Harry’s face flushed, and all the weasleys except Ron stared at his hand. “Uh, yeah.  So, I’ve been seeing Draco for quite awhile, we got married.  I was on my honeymoon when I went on that trip.” Everyone started talking over each other trying to ask questions.  “I really did mean to tell you earlier, but we were trying to make sure we were settled before letting it be common knowledge.”
“Yes, dad, we have everything.  We get it, no babies.” I could not help but grin at the fiery temper that had come out.  He hugged both men and we walked up to his room, my arm around his shoulders.
“You looked pretty good yourself.  I definitely noticed you that night.”  Harry smiled as he spoke.  “I had several interesting dreams of you in that suit.”  Being so fair, Draco’s blush was impossible to hide, winning a smirk from Harry.  “Aww babe, did I embarrass you?”
Teddy just put his head down on the table to end the conversation. After Harry and I finished eating and washing up, we went back to preparing to leave. We were all packed, it was just a matter of double checking everything. Teddy did not even need to ask, as he has done this more than a few times with us. We managed to get to the train with no further arguments. Once there he immediately ran to find the friends he had made previously.
“So, do we tell them now?”  I asked him.  He stopped, leaving the tea cups on the counter.  He smiled, pulling me into his arms.
“I’m right here, Ron.”  Harry said as he walked out of the room alone.  “Before you say anything, yes, I trust you, but this was something I wanted for myself first.  We wanted to see what we were before having anyone else know.”
“I promise.” He said, kissing me gently again.  I let his tongue in, tasting the orange mint of his toothpaste.  We separated for air so I got up and led Draco to the shower.
“I’ll call if we find anything, but he may still have left on his own.”  The officer said before walking away.
I woke, watching my mates uneven breathing.  The sight soothed something in me.  The dreams of future children helped to clear the sadness.  I sat quietly, watching the birds playing in the cold morning air through the window.  I lost track of everything around me until my mate’s arms encircled me and his lips brushed my forehead.  I blushed lightly, still feeling a bit raw from yesterday’s emotional outpouring.  “Good morning, got any plans for the day?” I asked him as he cuddled into me.
“How far are we going, baby?”  His only response was to kiss me even harder.  So  I carried him to the couch.  Harry started unbuttoning my shirt, pushing it off of my shoulders with a small whine.  So I helped get his off before tracing his nipple with my tongue.  He gasped, throwing his head back.  I could feel  little shocks with every touch.  I let him explore my chest with his mouth, my breathing ragged.
Harry's heat is coming up.
“I didn’t expect to see you here.  How are you doing?”  He asked my mate quietly.
Our guests arrived right on time.  Hermione arrived first, surprising no one.  Pansy and Blaise came next, followed by Remus, Sirius, and my mother.  We all sat down to enjoy the food Harry and I had prepared.
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t have a specific time frame.  I just do not want anyone to rush us.  I want us to be settled a bit.  I am sure we could handle kids right now, but, we should have some fun first.”
“Yes and no Harry.  It’s a mate dream.  We can really talk here while we are both asleep.  When one of us wakes the other will return to normal dreams.”  I answered.
A sob came from his throat, but he nodded.  “Okay.”  I watched as he got up to rinse his face in the sink.
“I’m game.  When is it?”  I asked him, excitedly.  I knew his answer when he just looked at the clock on the wall and grinned.  “Well, you’d best get me dressed for this thing then.”
“I swear that the first thought in her head when my birthday hit was about future grandbabies.  I think she’d be absolutely thrilled.  Probably even through a party in your honor.”  Draco answered with a forced posh tone.  I just hope your dads are okay if it ends up that way.  I know they are big on planning it all in advance.”
“Nothing yet. The Weasley’s took off before we got there, and the ‘buyers’ had not showed up yet.”  Draco said quietly.  I know he doesn’t want to be reminded of it.  “It does mean I am staying by Harry’s side until his pheromones catch up.  Most people would never think to touch a mated Veela, omega or not.”  I squeezed his hand and looked up at him trying to smile.
The next morning I was embarrassed to see that the tree we had used for cover was actually visible to anyone who wanted to watch.  I tried not to catch anyone's eyes while we packed up the tent and brought it back to Pansy's.  Draco did not seem to be worried about it at all, and kept trying to reassure me that it isn't uncommon there.  He told me that plenty of others had probably been doing something similar all over the grounds.
We stretched out on the large brown couch that we had chosen to match the wood.  Harry was reading, while I did my best to distract him.  “Now that we are firmly settled in I think we should have people over.  I know you have barely seen Hermione since that last shopping trip of hell.  What do you think?  Just a nice dinner.”
"So, did you have fun?" He asked as we headed back home.  He gave me a mischievous smirk and looked away laughing.
“No, you are charming when you just let it go.  Just follow your gut and I will follow your lead.  It will be over soon.”  Draco held the shorter man in his arms and kissed his forehead.  “No matter what happens we will deal with it.  We are forever, okay?”  Harry took a deep breath and nodded before taking a step towards the door.
Ron and Hermione were waiting for them.  Eagerly wanting to know how it went.  Hermione was wishing they had television here to watch press conferences.  When they arrived in their bedroom they kissed quickly, then joined their friends in the kitchen.
My next step was to focus on the dream I had woken from.  I vividly recalled the emerald green eyes, but the rest seemed a bit blurry in my memory.  From what I have been told that means my mate has not transformed yet.  The eyes from my dream are familiar to me.  Without the full dream I cannot be sure, but they have been haunting my dreams for years.  Sadly enough, the owner of those eyes doesn’t even know I’m alive.  I’ve been so desperate for his attention. I can not take my eyes off of him in class.  I once again have hope as the veela only chooses potential mates from those who have a pull towards them as well.  Though it’s never a guarantee that they will accept.
I rolled over to face him with a smile on my face.  “You are my home, that is all I need from you.”  I gently kissed his lips before leaning my head into his chest and falling asleep.  In the morning, his side of the bed was cold.  Finding a note saying he had an appointment I rolled over and breathed in his scent on the pillows.
“Don’t worry, the slytherins didn’t even bother trying to hide their bets.  I was not subtle enough to hide it.  Luckily, with my family being who it was, I did manage to avoid some of the hate for being gay.  Though, Blaize and Pansy would tease me relentlessly as I told them everything.” Draco shrugged.  “I hated the fact that I wanted you, but, figured it would never happen. I was also terrified of what might happen to you.  I didn’t eat or sleep well through school with thoughts of you. I still think you are too good for me Potter.  If I had known that we’d end up where we are I would have been a bit less of a jerk.”
“Honestly, I think we just go in and do it like I would if he was anyone else.  It would not be fair to leave Draco alone in the house while I try to explain to a room full of people.  Who knows how long it would take.  I will bring him in, as usual now while it’s just Molly and maybe Arthur.  Once she knows, she’ll help wrangle the others in if they get too weird about it.” Harry said as he looked over at his husband. Draco was apprehensive, but, he had been taught to hide that part of himself so he just nodded his head stiffly.  Harry looked him in the eyes.  “I promise, it will be just fine.”   As a group they walked back towards the kitchen with Ron and Hermione in front.  Draco was taller so his white blond hair still stood out as they walked up.
Harry tried to stand up, but started to fall.  The sudden need to catch him bringing my caring instinct to the forefront.  I lifted him effortlessly and not for the first time noticed that he was thinner than he should be.  “I have you, love.  Let’s try to cool you off a little bit.”  Quickly removing the sweat and slick soaked clothes, I gently placed him in the tub.  The beautiful old claw foot tub glistening in the light.  As he soaked I ran out and changed the sheets with a new one I had piled up near the bed.  I replaced the pillows and scented blankets around the edges of the bed then grabbed a bottle of water and a protein bar.  “How are you feeling?”  I asked as I walked into the bathroom, immediately handing him the bottle.  I moved a lock of hair that had fallen in front of his eye, feeling a bit more warmth than I expected from his forehead. I saw him hesitate to answer so I began to wash his hair, taking my time to massage his scalp.  I felt him lean into my hands with his head tilted back.  I felt the need to pamper him.
We had spent most of our nights at Harry’s, with a few at the manor.  It was not as much of a shock as I expected when we moved into the new house.  A few light hearted arguments over decorating, but mostly our lives blended together seamlessly.  Maybe because mates are meant to complement each other in all ways.
“Painful, but you know that.  Just to keep you from asking. No, my mate dream was blurry.  I have an idea. Don’t be expecting grand babies yet, mother.  I am far too self absorbed for that yet.”  I give her my best smirk, then sip my own tea.  She raises a knowing eyebrow at me.
Harry turned his face into my stomach trying to mentally check out of the conversation.  “Well, we had not specifically decided, but I am not sure we are ready for kids yet.  I was hoping to use protection until we’ve had some time as just us.  What do you think, baby?”  I asked my mate gently.
“School will be fun.  Happy Birthday to me I guess.”  I just shrugged, making Hermione decide to hug me.  “Do you think I should call Ron?  He didn’t say anything to us and just looked mad.  I’m not sure what he was thinking.”
“No.” He answered roughly following with whispering in his ear.  “Possibly going to need you alone soon, but not embarrassed.  Maybe we could reenact some of these fantasies we both had.”  This caused Harry to blush as well, and Hermione gave them both a knowing smirk.
“Well Mr. Potter, are you asking me out?”  I moved in closer to him slowly, keeping a bright smile on my face.  “I may even be able to get you a late birthday drink.”  He blushed again, but did not back up as I kissed his cheek this time.
I decided to call his cell phone when my growling became uncontrollable .  A freaked out Hermione answered.  “I don’t know where he is. He decided to stay outside at the last store  I came out just minutes later.  His phone is here and there’s blood.  Not a lot of blood, but I’m still worried.”  I left tear marks where my fingers had been gripping a counter.
“How did you manage to keep this relationship a secret for so long with the  press watching you both?”
She rolled her eyes at him, but ignored his lie.  “Of course it’s fine, the more the merrier. So who is it?”  She asked curiously, watching him out of the corner of her eye as he shifted nervously in his chair.  Instead of risking another lie he just shrugged then stumbled over to help Hermione.  His wife managed a smile at him for running away from his mother, but didn’t add to the conversation.
The pain in my back and neck have subsided, but the burning in my abdomen is getting worse.  “I am an orphan ‘Mione, no, I didn’t know.”  I tried to focus on my breathing.  “Why does this hurt so much?”
“It’s a valid worry baby.  I understand.  I will not feel rushed.  I think part of this is built into alpha/omega biology.  I want it too.  So let’s keep it on our minds and we will try for it purposefully.  Okay?  No fears.”
Every time he rocked back, the moan that escaped him made me want to kiss him.  He was not being gentle. I could feel my release coming, my knot already catching on his rim.  It was so tight it was painful.  It felt so good though.  As I finished, the knot brought Harry over the edge and we carefully moved so he could lay down.  I kissed his shoulder tenderly as he gulped down the bottle of water by the bed.  He was spent. He didn’t say anything, just pushed as close to my chest as he could and fell asleep.  I fell asleep soon after, still connected to my mate.
We decided to get together at the Three Broomsticks again.  This time with Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise.  It went fairly well, Hermione was as supportive as she had been for him already.  Blaise was a big flirt until my growling made him rein it in a bit, and Pansy, well, Pansy decided to show her jealous side. Harry survived.  After Hermione pulled her aside to talk to her alone, she came back as if she was a whole new person. They got along great then.  I’m not sure what she told her, but, whatever it was seemed to solve the problem for now.
“I was not much older when I had you.  Your father said that his line almost always feels their mate long before inheritance.  While it is never a guarantee that your mate will feel the same, they generally feel something too.  Just keep yourself open to it.  If you close yourself off it may make your potential mate think you are unsuited, especially an omega.”
Some news
“I’m sorry we are springing this on you like this.”  Draco said with a nervous breath.  “I’m also sorry for being a total prat all those years.  Harry wanted us to tell you before the press finds out.”
I think this was my favorite morning ever.  I have never felt this loved, cared for.  Once the water reached a good temperature and my sudden giggle fit had stopped we stepped in.  I reminded him that we really needed to actually shower and instead of making it lurid, he simply said “I’m going to take care of you.” as he poured shampoo into his hand.  His hands were firm, but gentle as he massaged my scalp with the shampoo, sneaking in gentle kisses along my neck.  He cleaned me from my head to my toes, leaving kisses everywhere as he worked.  I took the initiative  to do the same, hoping he would feel as cherished as he made me feel.  While I can’t say it was a fast shower, it was certainly thorough.
“I have a date tonight.”  I said quickly, jumping up to pick an outfit.  “And, yes mother, it was quite a dream.”
“Hmm”, she mumbled to herself.  “Can I ask what you were dreaming about last night?”
I watched him walk on stage.  I was overcome by his confidence.  He still had that smirk which was making me lick my lips subconsciously.  I had a knot of worry when Pansy brought out the swords.  He winked at me and I felt reassurance through our bond, though he stayed in character on stage.  I lost all track of the audience as he locked eyes with me and the music started.
Harry unrolled the paper and looked at the front page.  “Well, at least it’s a good picture of us.  I might want a copy of it.  The headline could be better though.”   Draco looked over his husband’s shoulder to see the text. ‘Savior married to former death eater!”  His silver eyes rolled back dramatically.
The pair looked at each other for a moment.  Then Harry sighed.  “Not at the moment but we haven’t really decided.  Alright, thank you for coming.  That is it for today.”  Draco kept an arm around his love’s waist as they walked to the nearest floo.
“We are living in London,” Draco answered. “ we actually both have offers to teach at Hogwarts.” He unconsciously held his chin up waiting for their anger to appear.  It didn’t though, Ginny still seemed annoyed, but, everyone else just smiled.
“You get the fire started then, and I’ll get the box for the regular letters. We should probably cast a charm to not have the owls noticed by the muggles.  I’ve enjoyed living mostly magic free for awhile, but I don’t want to freak people out.”  Harry said as he put their dishes in the sink to wash later. “Just remember, we did this for a reason.  Nothing they say is going to change us, right?”  The blond only grunted in acknowledgement as he focused on controlling a small fire.
“I need you to be a bit more specific.  What was I right about?”  Harry said airily while scratching at the bandage they had wrapped around his head.
Harry thought for a moment.  “Part of me wants you to tell him, but that feels wrong.”  He sat down next to her while looking into Draco’s eyes.
Once the food was set out and Ron’s arrival was imminent Harry and Draco made themselves scarce.  They decided to wait in their bedroom, Draco rubbing circles into his husband’s back.  They heard the floo, then Hermione greeting Ron with a kiss.
“Well,  it gets better from there. It seems to be mostly positive aside from dragging my history back out. ‘Potter’s childhood nemesis’?  Come on.”  The blond shook his head with a smirk.  “Children do mature, but, over all I’m not unhappy with the article.  It could have been so much worse.  How long do you think it will take for the howlers to arrive?  We should probably have a fire set up to throw them right in, we’ll still hear some of it, but not all of it.”
Harry’s P.O.V.
“So, do we know him?” the redhead asked curiously.  Hermione tensed up, causing him to look at her sharply.  “Based on that reaction I’d say that’s a big ‘yes’.  What’s going on? Just let it all out. I’m hungry.”
Having no important plans for the morning, the pair stayed in each others’ arms whispering sweet nothings to each other.   After a couple of hours, their bodies told them they had to get up so they did, grudgingly.  After getting their bodies’ needs taken care of they went to the kitchen to make breakfast together.  One batch of blueberry pancakes later they sat down for a leisurely breakfast, almost forgetting the onslaught they would have to deal with after the Prophet was delivered to everyone.  They were focusing on each other, lazily entwining their fingers as they drank their tea when the first owl appeared at the window.  Draco sighed at the owl being in muggle London, but fed it some treats as he took the paper from it’s leg.   As the owl left, he threw the paper on the table and looked at his husband.  “Shall we see how bad they did. I didn’t see Skeeter there, so hopefully it came out alright.  I think she got fired when they realized she was an unregistered animagus.”
“I told you I am already packed, you don’t need to check!” Teddy screams as I slowly make my way towards his room in just my pajama bottoms.
“I’m sure I do, and you will know all of them during our lives at some point.”  I smiled when he said this.  It was that moment that I realized that his scent was different.  “Um, Why do you smell different?”
I came home as the soft light of day was giving in slowly to the gray of the night.  The lights in the house had not been turned on yet as I made my way through the rooms following the scent of my missing mate.  I found him in our study, his obsession obvious by the fact that his hair was a mess.  I watched silently for a while, noticing the details and filing them away in my memory.  It was not often that the man showed his anxiety.  It was normally hidden behind a mask that few ever got to see behind.  The way he held his pencil, his left leg nervously beating a pattern into the carpet.  Even like this he was beautiful.  Not wanting to scare him I knocked lightly before turning on the lights in the room.  I leaned over to give him a kiss on the forehead.  “What’s got you so out of sorts today?  I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this.”
“Alright dear, how long have you two been seeing each other?”  Molly spoke softly, trying to ease some of the tension.
Draco’s P.O.V.
“Okay, but, I really should have written something.”  Harry stated worriedly. “Maybe if I knew what I was going to say I wouldn’t be so nervous.  I would be able to just read it and it would be done.”
The date continued
An obsessive mate
As Ron’s mother enters the room her nose wrinkles in distaste.  “How disappointing.  We can’t keep an unmated male veela in here.  Can you get him home?”  She asks Hermione.
eek... sorry this took so long.  I have not been in a great head space.  It isn't helping that I've been reading Snarry obsessively lately.  Finally decided to push myself to open my computer and start writing.. It's a little shorter I think, but, it seemed like a great place to stop.
“I was always a bit sad you wouldn’t call me by my name.  I could not convince myself to try and get closer to you.  It all worked out though.  That is all I want to focus on.”  His smile lit up his face, his emerald eyes shining as bright as the sun.  I kissed his mating mark and finished getting dressed.
Draco’s P.O.V.
“Well, the good news is that none of them know where we live now.  I won’t go out alone for awhile. I won’t completely lock myself away. Then they win.
“We started talking after the trials.  I wanted to prove that we could all get along.  We turned into friends, but quickly knew it was more.”  Harry started.
“Honestly,” Hermione interjected, “ the fact that he’s gay will not be a shock, it isn’t to me.  It will be to reporters, but Ron won’t care about that.”
I saw Remus squeeze Sirius’ shoulder gently.  He gave a sad smile in return. I could not help but notice their easy communication.  Suddenly I felt a warm love inside myself, and noticed the beautiful gray eyes staring into mine.  I finally realized that I had found my own person. It was at this moment of realization that there was a polite knock on the door.  Draco smiled and stood up.  “I’m sure that is my mother.  We decided that since we had to do a family meeting at some point, we might as well do it all at once.”  He said, “would you like me to answer it?”
Draco’s P.O.V.
Not sure where this came from ... I did not start writing the chapter with the intention of smut, sorry not sorry.   (Normally I allude to smut instead of actually writing it.)
"Love we need to get back to the tent soon."  I said as I got up to lead him away.  It was difficult to walk while he was still trying to make out the whole time.  We didn't make it all the way to the tent however.  Suddenly Harry pulled me behind a tree.  He did not waste any time, just pulled down my pants and started sucking me off.  Once I had finished I pushed him up against the tree and kissed him while using my hand to bring his release.  We dressed again, but I could not stop kissing him this time.  "I think this faire is a bad influence on you, love."   Sated now we casually walked back to our tent hand in hand.
“What’s the ferret doing here?”  Ginny asked, rudely.  She threw herself down in her chair and looked at Harry.  Harry cleared his throat, looking quickly at Draco.  Hermione pulled Ron’s arm leading him to their seats leaving only the couple standing at the entrance.
“We wanted to know we were settled before we let the relationship be known.  No audience to judge our fragile beginning.  As for sexuality, that was not something I felt needed to be addressed.  I am who I am. I never actively tried to hide it.”  Harry said with no smile.
I tucked my face into Draco’s neck to let his scent soothe me.  I was still fighting off a panic attack, but I managed to sob out a word.  “Dursley.”
“Mother, we have not even talked about any of that yet.  You do know my take on it though.  Eighteen is too young to be tied down like that.  I am hoping my mate will let me take him away.  We could travel for a while.  Today just made it more important to me to have time alone, for our bond to grow.”  He looked deeply into my eyes with a smile on his face.  "Give us time to explore just being 'us'."
“It was fine.”  Harry said. “I wish my life was normal enough not to require press conferences, but, my life will always be watched.”  He shrugged.  “The boy who lived will always have an audience won’t he?”
“Oh great, just what I always wanted for my birthday.  A womb.”  I reply while grinding my teeth in irritation.   This was certainly one gift I can say I’ve never wanted.
Not sure how I feel about this chapter, but.. after going over and over it I have to just let it be.
He must have seen it in my eyes because he gently kissed down my neck and led me to the bedroom.  “Let’s think about something more pleasant for a while.”  I just angled my neck to give him more room as his fingers started unbuttoning my shirt.  After our clothes came off we let our wings out.  Draco started running his fingers through the feathers gently, sparks of fire running through my nerves at each touch.  We worshipped each other’s bodies until sunrise.   Then we fell asleep, my head on my mate’s chest.
He sighed.  “I found your godfather’s name in my mother’s papers.  I was on my way to the house when I saw you come out.  I couldn’t think of a good way to approach you as you were not alone, so I sat down to plan what to say.”
Ron laughed nervously, “um, I am fairly positive ‘spitting it out’ requires less build up ‘Mione.”  She gave him an annoyed eye roll, but sighed.  “Any chance we can start in on the food while you talk?”
“Yes, Harry.  I’ve always noticed you.  My mother says it’s normal to feel something for a mate long before inheritance.”  I answered equally soft.  “Are you okay with this?  I am not going to force you to choose me, but, I am happy it’s you.”
Hermione kept giving me knowing looks.  She had seen the healing bite mark.  I know she wanted me to talk about it, but I was not sure I was ready.  It was already weird that people knew what I had been doing.  I nervously tried to keep the mark hidden while we were out.  It was higher than the collar of my shirt though, so every once in a while I’d see someone glancing at it as they walked by.  I also noticed eyes on me wherever I went, causing me to break out in goose bumps.  I’d see people, some betas, a few omegas, but a lot of alphas sniffing deeply as they neared.  I find that a bit rude to be honest.  I’m sure I had a sour nervous smell as the attention was really starting to get to me. I was ready to either go home, or go to Draco.
I started getting images when the bond came back to normal.  The word Burrow.  I finally called Hermione and asked if she knew where it was so I didn’t have to go by scent.  She told me and then offered to meet me there with the police.  When we arrived we found it barren.  I smelled his scent coming from a nearby shed.  It was a nervous scent, but had more anger behind it than anything.  The police went about searching inside the house while I ran into the shed.  I ripped the door off the hinge without even checking to see if it was locked.
The first thing I noticed was that Dudley did not have much of a scent.  Beta, I assumed.  The next thing I noticed was how upset he seemed.  He had lost weight and had he not been a big part of my nightmares I would have thought he had grown handsome enough.  I sat on the other side of the bench while Draco stood behind me reassuringly.  “Dudley, why have you been watching us?”
Harry’s P.O.V.
The story continues.
“Whichever one wins gets to do whatever they want to the other tonight.”
Harry managed a small smile.  “I decided that I needed some closure.  She was my aunt after all, even if she really didn’t want to be. Thank you for the photos by the way.”  He held his hand out to Dudley who looked at it curiously.  I could sense that this was a big moment to Harry.  This was about more than a handshake.  Dudley took his hand firmly and nodded.
When they arrived back home they immediately got undressed and in bed.  They just laid there with their fingers entwined and stared into each others’ eyes.  “Are we ready for this?”  Harry asks, swallowing nervously.
Hermione, unsure of what to expect looked around herself while she waited.  She noticed that little in the flat had changed.  The organized chaos of Harry.  Her musing stopped as she took in the white blond hair and the strong bone structure of Draco Malfoy.  Her jaw dropped.  “Wow, um, congratulations.”
“What’s wrong, Love?”  His first response to my question was a sigh as he marked his place in the book he had been reading.  He sat up and put his face in his hands.  “Okay, you are worrying me now.”
As she seemed to be pretty happy to see me I felt a little better about this meeting.  “It’s still a lot to take in.  I don’t know how I feel about it yet.  I was more than thrilled when I saw Draco walk in the door to get me though.”  She looked at Draco knowingly.
“Have you eaten anything today Dray?”  I asked him, trying to read the answer through the bond.  I frowned a little when I noticed a faint guilty edge to what was coming through.  “Well, that’s a ‘No’ I take it?”  Without waiting for an answer I lured him out to the kitchen and made him help me make some sandwiches.   “ Alright, so, tonight we are going to sleep early because you have obviously not taken care of yourself today. To make you feel better, there were no redheads in sight all day today.  I was paying attention the whole time I was out.  Tomorrow we will decide together how we go about this.  I want it over as much as you do.  I saw them as family, and now I am constantly looking over my shoulders hoping they aren’t there.”  I took off my shirt as I walked towards the bedroom, feeling his eyes following me before he finally made a move to start walking.
He curled up around me in bed, both of us in nothing but boxers.  He didn’t seem inclined to talk, so I just held his hand and felt his breath on my neck.  This was home for me.  I felt him calming down slowly. As I was just starting to doze off, I heard a faint whisper from my mate.  “I need to feel like I deserve you. You are my everything.”
“No, I felt a bit of calm,  then a flicker of downright panic and now.. It’s distant.  Something feels wrong.”  I tried unsuccessfully to hold in a growl.  By this time I was beginning to pace aggressively.
Once back at the house I asked for my dads to join us.  I opened the book at the kitchen table and slowly took in the first picture.  Tears started to form with each new picture.  These were my mom as a child.  I’ve seen the photos that Remus and Sirius keep around, but those start when she was a teenager.  Now I was seeing pictures of holiday meals, snowball fights, her red hair covered in mud outside.  Draco made us some tea and as the light faded to dark we talked about a past that none of us had known.
Draco’s P.O.V.
Hermione sat quickly as she took in Harry’s words.  Her best friend was married.  She hadn’t even known he was seeing anyone.  “Why didn’t you tell us?  You know we would have supported you, right?”
Harry’s P.O.V.
“Hey, if that’s what you want let’s start planning it.  I still want to travel with you, but not at the expense of what you want.  We have room, love, and plenty of money.”  I tried to assure him through the bond, but I could feel he was holding something back.  “Love, what else is in your head right now?”
“I, um, well.  I wanted to apologize to you.  I realize it may not make a difference to you, but I know how hard I made your life. I also thought you should know that mother died.  Her funeral is coming up next week.”  He looked into my eyes for a moment, lowering them again quickly.
He looked at me, kissing my scent gland before answering.  “I think I have an idea.  We don’t have to, but, to help with what we discussed last night, Why don’t we design the nursery?  The room next to ours would be perfect.”
I could not help blushing.  I had been crushing on him with the silver eyes for years.  The pain was slowly beginning to ebb, so I started to perk up with memories of Draco.  “That is interesting.  I doubt he’d want me though.  I have never even managed to say ‘hello’ to him, besides even my best friend and his family bailed on me.”
Harry’s P.O.V.
I woke up suddenly, the room spinning as I took everything in.  I wiped the sleep from my eyes.  It was then that I noticed how warm Harry was.  He was fidgeting and whimpering softly in his sleep.  My instincts told me to help my mate, there was not a whole lot I could do though. I got out of the bed to start filling the tub with cool water.  As it filled I went back and laid with my arm around Harry’s waist.
“To our knowledge neither of you is currently working, will that be changing anytime soon?”
“I’m not stopping our walk because someone is watching.  Let’s go.”  I pulled out of his grasp, catching his hand as I did so.  “I refuse to be afraid.  It’s probably just some homophobic idiot.”
“I need you Draco.”  Harry said, his eyes blown with the building lust.  He straddled my chest, panting, breathing in my scent.  Before I could react Harry lined himself up and took me in fully. His passage was warmer than normal, the slick sliding out with noises that ordinarily would cause Harry to blush.
The meeting I had with my financial advisor took a couple of hours.  While walking in the direction of the house I felt a prickling sensation on my neck.  I rubbed my neck quickly while looking around surreptitiously. I notice a flash of red hair before it disappears behind a wall. “Gotcha you bastard.”  I whisper to myself.  Acting as if I had not noticed anything unusual I leisurely walked in that direction.  Once I saw that the person I had seen was running, I let my wings out and stretched them, glad I had made sure all my shirts had been designed for wings.  I took to the air to follow. I caught up with ease, hiding in a tree to watch as Weasley met up with his mother outside of a building.  It was one of those buildings you pass by everyday and never notice.  No sign to give you an idea what it is being used for.  I caught the scent of another alpha nearby, but it didn’t come from either of the red heads.  I watched as they headed into the building.  I took out my cell phone and called the police.  While I want to avenge my mate, I have no desire to end up in jail myself.  I stayed perched in my tree, hoping that my mate was only catching calm energy through my side of the bond.
We took our places at the staff table looking over the excited students at their house tables. I felt Draco hold my hand under the table as the first years made their way down the center of the room. He’s always been better at hiding his emotions, so I wasn’t surprised to see the Malfoy mask up. He could not however hide his gasp as he caught sight of the boy who may as well be our son. Teddy had changed his hair to black, which he often did when he was nervous. His attempt at not drawing attention to himself. He had chosen a new set of robes that fit him perfectly. We could not help but smile proudly at him as he took his place to be sorted. I’m sure my nerves were visible to everyone in the room. My breathing stopped as I waited to hear the sorting hat.
Once the students had all made it to their seats, I couldn’t help but turn to my husband. “So, neither of us won, but I am still getting some tonight.” I had been letting my hand travel up the inside of his thigh under the table. The Malfoy mask was still in place until a blush quickly crept up his cheeks. His smirk turned to a laugh. I looked back out at the tables just in time to see Teddy blush and put his head in his hands, embarrassed by his dads again. Oops.
I watched with a half smile as he shrugged.  “No, you are probably right.  It might be better to just get it over with and maybe they won’t be so mad about finding out last if there is someone else in the room.  After I sent a message to my mother about meeting, we collapsed on his bed, the stress of the day finally making us fall asleep wrapped around each other.
“This is too sweet for my taste, what are we drinking?”  Ron quipped lightly as he leaned back casually in his chair.
A low growl was pulled from Draco’s throat.  “I hate feeling like I was not able to protect you before.  I won’t feel safe until I get my hands on them.  Please stay in very public places.  Every instinct in my body wants to convince you to stay by me.”
He shifted slightly, his fingers brushing through my hair.  “Just thinking.  When do you think you want to have kids?”  I could feel him looking down at me.
Before Harry could completely melt down I held him up against myself with his face in the crook of my neck.  My scent calming him slowly, while I looked at the man on the bench.  My first impression was that he was uncomfortable.  He seemed hesitant to even look in our direction.  He was about the same height as me, though he had obviously tried to do something with his hair, he looked fairly plain.  Not bad looking, just average. He looked to be around the same age as us, so I had to assume that this was Harry’s cousin.  “Hey, you don’t have to talk to him.  We can turn back around and leave by a different path. Or I can find out what he wants if you prefer.”  I whispered, loosening my arms enough for him to look at me while he answered.
He looked quickly over at the man, then swallowed nervously.  “I think I have to do this.  If I don’t I will never get past this feeling.”  I sighed, but knew he was probably right.  When he walked forward I was all set to let go and give them privacy.  Harry gripped my hand even harder and pulled me with him.  I followed quickly, ready for almost anything knowing that my mate needed his alpha’s presence.
Harry’s P.O.V.
"How did you learn to dance like that?  It was, um..."  I looked down shyly. "Impressive."
I could feel worry creep in through the bond, his scent giving off a slightly acidic tang.  “Are you sure that’s a good idea?  She can’t protect you if he shows up.”
“Ron said I was to be sold, there were supposed to be buyers coming to get me sometime tonight after the Weasleys left.  I’d keep watching the road, they aren’t going to turn in if they notice all this going on.”  Harry sighed.  “Baby, I need my phone.  I should probably call my godfathers now that I am safe with you.  They will never forgive me for not calling sooner.  I have not even told them about you or being a veela.”
Draco’s P.O.V.
“I wouldn’t have believed it, honestly.  I had never had a family that wanted me, so the idea of marriage seemed unlikely.  When I first met you I will admit, I was totally awestruck.  You were beautiful, and then your Malfoy arrogance scared me off.  So, even if I had visions of us, or somehow knew the future, it would not have made me change anything because I would not for one moment see it as a possibility.”   Harry said, remembering some of their more lively exchanges over the years.  Picturing the love of his life as a child he first spotted in a robe shop, the over the top arrogant smirk.  Picture perfect blond hair, molten silver eyes, and alabaster skin all standing out in stark contrast to the black robes he was being fitted for.  Draco laughed at the dreamy and far away look on Harry’s face.
Draco’s P.O.V.
“I don’t get it, why would someone who had been my best friend chain me up to sell me?  Is it really that bad to be what I am? “ I asked sadly, remembering the conversation I had with Hermione.  I leaned heavily into Draco’s side, a feeling of melancholy washing over me.  Draco’s arm going back over my shoulder and pulling me in even closer helped push the feeling away for a while.
“‘Mione I was hoping you could help me tell him.  I don’t want him finding out from the papers.”  Harry spoke up nervously.
Hermione decided that this was the end of the important conversation.  “Boys, let’s talk while we eat.  I think we have gotten over the hurdle.  Now about your press conference.”
“As romantic as that sounds, you told Pansy that we would be there.”  I know he could smell how aroused I actually was, but we both focused on getting on with the date.
“That’s a long story, better served with food, but before that,” with this Harry took the blond’s hand. “We are married!”
The family.
This heat was far more enjoyable than the last one.  While the last one was rushed and painful, this one was unhurried.  The uncomfortable heat still needing touch to alleviate it, but this time we were able to go slow.  My mate’s scent even became stronger to me, leaving me more calm than I expected.
I held his chin and kissed his forehead.  “Whatever you want.  I am in no rush.”  He blushed some more and I could see tears in his eyes.  Before I could ask about them he asked if I knew where the Three Broomsticks was located.  I nodded.
*****Draco’s p.o.v.*****
“Aren’t we basically married already? Of course.”  I threw my arms around his neck and got down on my knees to be closer to him.
I did not really know how to react.  I took a deep breath, my gaze lingering on the trees in the distance.  I felt warmth through my bond giving me a sense of strength.  “I am sorry for your sake that she died.  How did you find me?”
“Wouldn’t the fact that he’s mated make it less likely he’d be a target?”  Hermione asks quietly.  She looked up at me hopefully.
“Show off.”  Harry dead panned. I chuckled as I went to his side and started to check the locks that held him.
Harry’s P.O.V.
We lived through the ‘talk’ without spilling the news.  Remus basically just wanted to make sure we were both okay after our first heat. Apparently there are some pairs that end up getting too rough during their first heat.  I could say that wasn’t the case without lying.  After my dads went back to their own room I encouraged my mate to take a walk with me.
Hermione had not quite figured out the best way to go about her task.  She led Ron to the table, not answering his questions about where Harry was until he was seated comfortably.  “Harry wanted me to talk to you about something before coming in.  I am fairly sure you won’t have a problem with this part, so I’m just going to spit it out.”
“Our scents are blending.  No one can claim they don’t know you are mated now.”  He got down on one knee, kissing my hand.  “I have one more question before we get ready to go look at houses with your dads.  Do you want to marry me?”  He pulled out a ring box from a bag he had left on the floor before my heat started.
Harry smiled shyly at the question.  “We have only told a few people.  My two best friends are happy for us. “  Harry started.  “I plan on telling the rest of my chosen family today, but I am sure it will be okay.”
“6 p.m. tonight, yeah?”  He asked.
“Do you enjoy torturing me?”  I asked, trying to steer the conversation to safer subjects.
“Are you sure you weren’t in Slytherin, you definitely know how to manipulate me when you want.  That was devious.”  The blond rolled onto his side, spooning his husband and pulling his back onto his chest. “Good Night Love.. Tomorrow will be what it will be.  We burn the howlers and deal with the rest as it comes.”
“Why is your back bleeding?”  Hermione asks, gently lifting my shirt as Ron went to get his mother.  I heard her gasp before they came out.  Wings.  Black with gray tips.  They were trembling.  “Did you know that you were a veela Harry?”
“I know that if you have loved him for this long, he must be a good man.  Your gut has never proven you wrong. I can accept him as part of your family Harry,  you really didn’t need to hide it from us for so long.”  Molly said gently.  She gave Draco another reassuring smile.  “So, what are you going to do now that you are back from traveling?”
“We ran into each other, while I was on a quest to prove that we could all exist together after the war. We talked a lot, which turned into more as we spent more time together.  Next question.”
Harry's P.O.V.
We spent the weekend shopping for new furniture with Hermione.  She encouraged this new fearlessness in her best friend.  I think she wished she could see his uncle’s face when we showed up.   I could not help but agree, judging by last night that fearlessness brought side effects that I certainly did not mind.
“Bedroom.”  He managed to say clearly.  I picked him up again and threw him lightly on the bed.  I laid myself over him, watching for any sign of resistance.  “I want you Draco, Please.”
At Harry, and the entire audience’s urging.  I took my shirt off as I walked, tossing it to my eager mate.  Even with the scents of all those around me, I could only focus on his.  Excited and already in a state of arousal.
“Are you afraid of the reactions as your godson grows up with two dads?  This is still not fully accepted.”
Harry’s P.O.V.
“‘Mione, I know that.  I wanted to try to live off the radar a bit.  I didn’t want you to have to keep secrets either.”  He held her hand.  “I am telling you first because Ron won’t be happy.  He still has hopes for me and Gin, which was never going to happen.”
“Draco, you’re thinking too hard.  I can feel it through the bond. What’s on your mind?”  Harry’s words break through the haze.  I shake off the lingering doubt?  Anxiety?  Whatever this feeling was.
I was laying on the couch with my head in his lap, his fingers idly running through my hair.  I turned to look into his eyes.  “Do you have any ideas?  I certainly don’t have any objections.”
I find myself staring at my reflection more often lately.  I can see differences from before my change.  With everything going on I had not really paid that much attention.  My hair, still the same white blond, and styled perfectly.  My eyes more silver than gray now.  The lines of my jaw a little sharper than I’m used to.  I got lost in my reflection until my mate’s scent hit me.  He was in our bedroom dressing for our friend’s visit while I lost myself in memories.  I was no longer the self obsessed pratt I once was.  My mate knew me then, and I did everything I could to live up to my parents expectations. I pushed away my feelings until my veela inheritance kicked in.  Now, here I was with Harry Potter, and few traces of my past me were visible
Draco sat close to me with his arm around my shoulder.  “Do you want to look at it here, or at home?”
