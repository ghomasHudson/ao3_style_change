Glancing back and forth between them both a few times, Ginny sighed gently before giving him a small nod. “I’ll see you at home?”
She nodded, digging around in the drawers below the counter. “What name am I looking for?”
“Wait.” Harry thought back to forth year and realised maybe he had an answer, after all. “If I take Dreamless Sleep at night I won’t need Wideye anymore, right?”
This was easier, he reasoned, as he turned back to what he had always known. Harry thought it had died with Voldemort. Instead it seemed like Voldemort had diluted it; now with every breath he could feel it building inside him and that chest pain was back, his throat was closing and though part of him was screaming to push down the pain and reject the rage that voice was being drowned out by the ringing in his ears and what felt like his entire body convulsing.
Perhaps he did have a New Year’s Resolution after all.
“Lovegood? Why?”
Harry was at a loss for words, not sure they were both participating in the same conversation. “Just Harry’s fine.”
“I just… I don’t really see how they’ll be able to help.” Shrugging, Harry withdrew his hand and downed the last of his Butterbeer. “Unless they’ve got some magic that’ll get rid of the… y’know.”
Despite his hair being plastered to his forehead and feeling drenched in his own sweat, Draco was freezing. He couldn’t stop shivering though every blanket he had was wrapped tightly around him to prevent any air getting in. There was next to no light coming in through the stone walls and even the gap in the ceiling above him wasn’t illuminated, so he presumed it was still some time in the middle of the night.
“Not at all. You weren’t in the place to look deeper when everything was happening and then the war fucked you up too much. I see that every single day. I know you still have nightmares.” She looked at him as if to deny it but he knew better, certain that some nights she heard his screams even through the strong silencing charms on his room. Nodding, she leaned forward to rest her hands on the table. “I know you struggle to think of doing anything other than your Auror job because you’ve always had to be responsible for fighting the bad guys. But maybe it’s time you let someone else do that. Maybe you deserve to be happy without winning everyone else’s battles, Harry.”
“I’m just saying that maybe you should figure out if you’re happy with how you’re living your life now. If you are, and you definitely seem to be lately… Well, it’s hardly a waste of time to keep doing what you’re doing and either waiting out whatever he’s working through, or seeing what direction your life takes without him.” She paused, biting her lip as she glanced over at their three children before looking back to where he sat, watching. “Unless you’re unhappy, in which case I don’t know what else to say.”
“Er, excuse me.” Sharing a look with Ron, Harry was glad to know he wasn’t the only one completely lost. “What would do me good?”
“I’m not really sure what you’re talking about,” Harry admitted with a grimace. “Can we talk about this some other time? I don’t feel so good.”
Harry didn’t like the sound of that but chose not to push the subject, knowing when to take the win. He put the horribly cheesy positivity posters and harshly lit rooms of the psychological rehab facility out of his mind and instead focused on the warm air around them. It was a rare sunny day and Harry had to acknowledge that perhaps being outside wasn’t the worst thing for him right now; Hermione may have been on to something when she insisted that they walk back to the Ministry.
“I wouldn’t necessarily say that,” he said cautiously. “Not sure I really prefer one to the other.”
Draco opened his mouth to respond, cut off by Andromeda calling out from the barrier between platforms nine and ten. “Sorry to interrupt, boys, but we’ve got to get this one through before he misses the train.”
“Er… We could skip telling that to Kreacher? Stop on the way home? The Indian place?”
Shuffling his weight from side to side, Potter fidgeted with his too-long robe sleeves—would someone please find him something that fit?—as he took a moment to answer. Draco waited impatiently, sensing the shift in the air around them as Potter finally made up his mind.
“Like, you don’t like anyone right now?”
Draco took a deep breath and started once more to feel the warmth in his toes. This time, he imagined he was putting his toes out towards the fire and letting it slowly heat them, the heat then spreading to his feet, his legs, his stomach, his chest. He could almost feel the flicker of the flames as his face started to warm and he thought of stretching his hands out to the fireplace, palms warming as the echoing voices of his housemates filled his ears. Soaking in the warm memory, Draco felt almost like he could manage this. The place might reek of misery and despair but without the Dementors here, he could hold onto thoughts of a better time without the constant fear of having them taken from him.
Walking to close the distance before taking the proffered hand, Draco felt like a weight had been lifted as he repeated the words slowly. “
“How odd.” Hermione’s tone next to him was curious and he could feel her eyes boring into the side of his skull. “And if it splits in perfect halves? What’s that story?”
“Just Harry’s fine,” he interjected as he tried not to suddenly curl in on himself. Why did his chest feel like it was burning from the inside out? What had she done?
Realising he had spent far too long fixating on Malfoy’s face, Harry flushed. “I live in the village,” he explained.
Heart swelling with appreciation for his boyfriend, Harry gave his hand another squeeze. “They’re going to love you. You’ve already met most of my family anyway. The kids love you.”
“Oh, shit. I’m sorry.”
“You’re moving back to France?”
Heart in his throat, Harry nodded slowly. He had misunderstood, too many years too late. “You’re not interested in me.”
“Best gift anyone’s ever given me,” he murmured.
“Thank Merlin for Christmas miracles.”
“Er, yeah. That’s why I suggested it?” Cowering slightly at the glare she shot him, Harry raised his hands defensively. “I was joking?”
“You’re also going to finish that, because it’s hardly fair that I’m the only one with protesting tastebuds in this family. Then we are both going to forget this conversation for a few weeks if only to get through Christmas without a Weasley family breakdown or worse, an intervention.” She shuddered, standing to take her glass to the sink. “I know you’re incapable of not thinking about Malfoy, so perhaps you can use the next few weeks to think about everything you’ve finally realised and then we’ll decide what to do once everyone’s done breathing down our necks. Think you can manage all of that?”
This should have been better. This shouldn’t have been such a struggle for him, honestly. He had been fighting his whole damn life to beat the bad guy and now the battle was won… So why did he felt like his entire identity had died with Voldemort?
The tone in her voice had him meeting her eyes once more, chest tightening at what he saw.
Rolling his eyes, Draco shook his head even as the hesitance was still plainly written across his face. “Ever the dramatist, Potter.”
Standing quickly, he squeezed past his friends and made his way into the kitchen, ignoring the whispers that broke out behind him. Rounding the corner he stopped dead in his tracks as he saw Draco frozen across the room at the sight of him.
“This isn’t funny! It could be really serious. We should get you checked out.”
“That’s a Dragon Claw blade,” Hermione said in awe-filled tones. “They can cut through anything.”
“You say you don’t know what you want.”
“—you still understood that I needed to put him first. And even now, knowing that the world is used to us being together as a family, you’d probably say the same thing.” Laughing quietly, Draco’s hands stilled. “You’ve always been so bloody selfless, Harry. Even when it goes against what you want, or sometimes your best interests. It’s downright infuriating—
The next time followed quickly after: he was eating his dinner with Hermione at the dining table. Harry gasped suddenly and clutched his chest before he could think and Hermione turned to him, concerned.
“Thought we agreed not to mention it before you got home,” Harry muttered under his breath, a soft snort from James the only indication anyone had heard him. “Er, right. Yes, Al. I was going to tell you all when we got home.”
Harry cut off Draco’s muffled apology with a raised hand, keeping his gaze locked ahead. “I might not like your parents much, but at least they got to raise you. My aunt and uncle, they…”
Nodding slowly, Harry tried to find his voice as he felt the emotions start to well up in his chest. “Gin… I did love you, you know. I do.” His words were shaky but he saw the hurt in her eyes and knew he had to see the discomfort through to the end. For both of them. “But maybe you’re right. I think it was expected of us and now that there’s no more fighting… I don’t know if I can do this anymore.”
“Harry, stop.” Draco had been noticeably silent through most of this, but now he met Harry’s eyes, something in them that made Harry uneasy. Shaking his head gently, Draco sighed. “I think we should go home now.”
With the man you dared oppose?
“I just…” His voice cracked, and Harry swallowed before trying again. “He looked awful. Worse than sixth year. He deserves Azkaban for what he did, but I feel bad about it.”
; Draco’s latest letter atop the pile was dated 24 May asking him not to owl again. He’d been much more forthcoming with frequent correspondence before Astoria had fallen pregnant, neither denying nor confirming what Artur had said last Christmas but at the very least not immediately shutting Harry down after he’d mentioned it.
"Oh my." Malfoy shook his head, the sheer disbelief still painted across his face. "She's got quite the pipes on her, doesn't she?"
Dropping her voice, Hermione glared across the table at him. “You’d better be joking, Harry. Dreamless Sleep is like Wideye on steroids. Or technically the opposite, I suppose.” At his confused expression, she sighed. “See, you don’t know anywhere near enough about these things to just be taking them as you please!”
Seeing Draco at King’s Cross earlier that year had ripped a hole in Harry’s heart once more; it was the briefest of moments that they made eye contact and yet his entire body ached with the weight of what they’d been through. The experience confirmed two things he knew for certain: that he was irrevocably in love with Draco Malfoy, and that he deserved a lot better than what he’d dealt with over the past few years.
Malfoy snorted. “Nice gloves, Potter.”
“What do you mean, up close?
“Miss Granger, I understand your frustration.. Unfortunately there isn’t a whole lot I can do at this stage.”
He paused a moment. “I’m sorry. I just don’t know.”
He nodded, not sure he could trust his words right now.
“Er, mate… I’m kinda with Hermione on this one. I know you’ve never been the best of mates with Malfoy, and I’m still not the git’s hugest fan, but I reckon you should just drop it, yeah?”
“What, Potter?” She said, turning back with an exasperated sigh. “I can’t really spell it out any—“
Seamus laughed, taking a swig of his ale as he thumped Dean on the back. “You’ll be ‘right. Just you wait and see.”
With a heavy heart he saw that Apollo had returned without an answering letter and Harry sighed, fishing in the cupboards for a treat and scratching the tawny feathers atop his owl’s head. It had been fruitless to get his hopes up after all this time. He was a grown man with one child sleeping in the other room and another on the way in a few short months. Draco had made his stance on any communication very clear and he should have respected that instead of taking the other man’s child as an opportunity to reach out.
“Have you perhaps considered that his outbursts are connected to his emotions?”
Tilting his head down to meet Harry’s lips with his own, Draco said nothing, his conflicting emotions clear as day in the urgency of his movements. Desperate sighs, hands tugging slightly harder than necessary at his messy hair. This time it was Harry who had to pull away first, knowing that being late would cause Draco more grief than he ever cared to admit. He led the way through the Floo, confident that Draco would only be a few short moments behind him as he arrived to a bustling room that quickly fell silent as he stepped through.
She snarled, coming closer to Harry and shaking her head. “What I mean, Potter, is that the two of you have been dancing around each other for bloody years now and I am sick to death of hearing Draco complain about it. I told him to be a Malfoy about it and have an actual conversation with you but if he cornered you at work—“
“Draco’s my cousin!” Teddy shouted excitedly. “And he bought my a dragon!”
between his bed and the rest of the room and hated to think of what his nightmares must have brought about in him.
"Haven't you had enough of prophecies for one lifetime? Of doing things because some stupid magical object said that's what would happen?"
“Master Harry was calling for Kreacher?” The elf said as he bowed low, Regulus’ locket just about touching the floor with the movement. Straightening up, he fixed a stern look in Harry’s direction as he took in the scene in front of him.
Trying in vain to keep his teeth from chattering, he kept the covers up below his chin and tried to move his toes just to check that they were still receiving blood flow. Then he worked his way up slowly, into his feet, through his legs, up to his stomach and into his chest. He imagined that as he felt the blood pumping to keep him alive, it was warming him. This wasn’t entirely new for him, he was just adapting the process he had used for the last two years to keep himself from shooting an Unforgivable in his own direction. Instead of warmth, it had been safety. It had been a calm, secluded place he could be alone inside of his body when his mind became too much.
Sighing heavily Harry resigned himself to another night of tossing and turning and with that, pulling the blanket up over his face, he recited every phrase he could remember from
The clinking of cutlery against plates was horribly loud in Harry’s ears after that, with conversations around the table dampened by what had transpired. Tensions were thick in the air, though Harry tried his best to ignore it. He knew that Draco could feel it too, the heavy atmosphere pressing against his skin and the way it made his throat feel as if it were closing in. They made it through lunch in relative silence, Harry sensing Draco’s growing anxiety and taking their cue to leave as soon as could be considered polite, after dessert; it was sinful to leave before Molly served the Yule log.
“Well, that still doesn’t answer the question.”
Harry decided to approach the dragon. He was a magizoologist for Merlin’s sake, this was his job. He carefully moved closer to where the dragon had fallen, holding his hands up in a classic I’m-not-going-to-hurt-you gesture. It wouldn’t have mattered what he was doing, because the dragon was no longer looking in his direction. Instead, the dragon had turned his head towards the ground and looked like it was trying to burrow under.
Setting down his cooking supplies Harry turned round properly towards her, frowning. “All due respect, Mrs. Malfoy, you allowed your own son to be branded by a murderer and a tyrant. I really don’t know if you have any room to talk.”
him like that yet but… Yeah.”
"That explains it," Ron sighed. "Robards has been asking me about where you two went. Off the record. He hiding out at home, waiting for it to blow over?"
"You have to not only see the animal you will become, but manipulate your core to shift your very being
“Yeah, I did, but this isn’t necessarily a social call.”
“Of… course. I’ll be certain to attend.” The older man beamed and stood up again, notepad returning to his hand.
into existence on the counter.
What would my mother think? I could hardly handle the transformation, I don’t want to put that on her, having to witness it. I’m completely trapped. I want to come home.
"Right. Thanks for your help Blaise. Have a good day."
“Like hell I would ever do that to him. And for the record, I’m not telling anyone where he is so another auror team can bring him in.” He caught Ron’s gaze. “Officially, he and I are on holiday. Not together, no matter what Belinda thinks.”
Whenever Draco thought about it too long, the windows nearby would shake and an anguished wail would bubble up from his chest, rattling the tiles of the bathroom. He eventually calmed himself each time with a shake of his head and a wry smile. He was worse than Myrtle, sometimes, the poor girl.
“He’s right back to his usual self, after his last letter,” he said, handing it over to her without a fight.
Everyone in the room went silent, looking at Draco and the young man who’d just entered through the Floo. It was like looking in a mirror. They were of a similar height and build. Their hair was the same color, though the other man wore it slightly longer. They could’ve been identical twins. Draco could only manage to say, “D… Draco Malfoy.”
"I-" Draco sighed in defeat. "Yes, Aunt Gwendolyn." She smiled and kissed his cheek
“That much I already know to be fact.” He smiled, allowing his hand to cover her left. “You would adore my mother.”
I kissed him. I kissed him, and I put my hands at his waist and shoulder, and I wanted to do more. But he didn’t respond. He kissed me back for all of two seconds before he went stiff as a board against me. We pulled away, and he ran out the door and Disapparated before I could ask what was wrong.
there’s something going on. You can talk to me.” He sighed, not making eye contact. “And
“Hurry up.”
“Why?” Ron asked.
manage that?”
Hermione glanced up at him from her book. “Sorry.”
Harry thought about that for a moment. Would it be the student body giving him flack? Maybe… The press? Again, maybe… His parents…? Harry could see Lucius being upset but not Narcissa, she loved him too much. And he couldn’t see Pansy or Blaise being bothered by it… ‘
Harry chuckled at that, eyes moving to where he could see Justin and Tony having a conversation of their own.
He shrugged, wrinkling his nose. “Some days are better than others.”
“Flynn, Ned!”
They looked at each other again, then Blaise blinked at the floor as Ron said, “Maybe. But I dunno for sure.”
“You’re right, you’re right,” Harry digressed, going back to reading the list from Ginny.
The Hufflepuff tabled cheered as their, apparently, second student of the sorting joined their table. Harry had missed the first, and apparently another Ravenclaw as well.
“Shit. Uh, Ron. I am super clumsy and I don’t actually eat as much as Hermione makes it seem like I do.” That earned him a few chuckles. Ron turned to the boy next to him.
“Alchemy?”
He handed it to Harry, his fingertips brushing Harry’s palm. Harry sucked in a breath through his nose, then tried to hide it by clearing his throat. “Thanks.”
Dean handed the sweets to Malfoy. The blond stared at them curiously, then handed them off to Blaise. Blaise pushed it back into his hands. “Come on, Draco,” he whispered. “Try one.”
Green eyes flew open and he pushed himself upright, tears already streaming down his face. “I’m sorry,” he gulped. “I’m so sorry, Ron.”
“You think so?”
The blond picked it up, eyes scanning Hermione’s neat handwriting. An emotion flickered across his face that Harry didn’t recognise. Something between softness and a sneer replaced it, like they were fighting for dominance of his facial features. The note quickly landed back on Harry’s desk. ‘Fine, Mother Hen.’
. It wasn’t fair.
Ron glanced at Hermione, then back at Harry with a look he couldn’t quite understand. “Okay, mate. Is that what you’re talking about, because I doubt he’d just tell you.”
Draco shook his head, pushing food around on his plate. “No. I mostly stayed inside with my mother.”
“No, I mean like, 31.”
Harry nodded. “Right.”
“Sorta?” Ron whispered, leaning closer. “I never thought I’d hear that sound come out of a lot of people, let alone Malfoy.”
“Nightmares?” Draco asked, hitting the landing and pushing the door.
do something though.”
Harry hesitated. “Only a little. She seemed unsteady at first.”
“I know, but even within the houses. Since first year I haven’t exactly meshed well with Lavender and Parvati’s personalities, and Kellah, Fay, and Annie have always been quiet. But they’re
The room went silent for a moment, until a cough drew everyone’s attention. “I’m Blaise. Despite being in Slytherin I hate the colour green, so that’s rather unfortunate…” He gestured to his bed. “Besides that… I really like dogs. I want a beagle.”
‘No… I dont think so. But thanks for talking to me. I have to go study now.’
Stray tears leaked onto Draco’s shirt as Harry calmed. He was still trembling, but Draco suspected that was due to the dream crucio and not so much from fear. Harry pulled back, swiping at his face, watching Draco’s concerned eyes watching him. He sniffed. “I’m sorry.”
The group stopped in front of a stool at the front, where the Sorting Hat, battered but intact, perched. Professor Sprout took her seat at the staff table, and McGonagall held up a piece of parchment.
“Nah. Hold on… Accio, pencil.” A sharpened, wooden pencil flew into Harry’s hand and he tossed it to Malfoy. “They’re made of wood. There’s graphite inside.”
“You can.”
“To my first years, we all welcome you with open arms. If you do not know me already, I am Headmistress McGonagall, as well as the Transfiguration Professor. This school is your new home, and your peers, your family. The staff are here to support you as you develop into wonderful young people and perfect your magical abilities. Enjoy your time here, seven years will have gone by before you know it.
“What’s wrong, mate?” Ron asked as he approached.
“Thanks.” He looked in it and recoiled. “
Blaise smiled. “Someone has to. Besides, you’re looking out for my best mate.”
cards.” A whizzing filled Draco’s ears before a smack let him know that the cards had landed in Harry’s hand. “Draco, do you wanna play?”
Hermione gave him Harry an amused look as he scribbled back. ‘You sure?’
Harry only nodded as the other boy left, staring at the empty doorway. “Okay.” He shook his head to clear the thought, then turned and slipped on his tie. A fist pounding on the door reached his ears and he sauntered over to it, poking his head out.
Harry stared around the room for a moment, taking in all of the different students practicing different charms. Hermione, of course, had a glass of wine in front of her. Sue had dried out some sort of flower. Luna was beaming at the legs on the teacup in front of her, which Ginny was raising her eyebrows at with something between amusement and confusion. As he turned back to the other side of the room, he saw a flare of orange over Ron’s shoulder. Squinting at it, his eyes widened, realizing someone below had set something on fire.
Harry nodded, heading up the way Blaise had just come from. He pushed the door open gently, earning a startled look from Draco. Harry only smiled slightly at the other boy, who was perched on the end of his bed, hands clasped together. Harry strode over to his trunk, knelt in front of it and shoved the lid open. He rifled around inside of it momentarily before grinning and rising back to his feet. He turned to Draco, who looked up at the object in Harry’s hand with astonishment.
Harry, Ron, and Dean strode into the common room with wind-burned cheeks and their eyes set on food. Draco looked up from his textbook immediately after hearing them come in, and watched as Harry spotted the platters sent for them. They strolled over to the area where Draco was sitting, curled up in the corner of the couch with parchment draped inside his textbook working on potions homework. He quickly turned his attention back to his book, and felt the couch dip beside him as someone sat down.
Harry cut the cards once more, then started to deal them between himself and Ron. As he looked up a dark-haired girl flopped down, cross-legged on the ground against Hermione’s chair. Still, she didn’t look up. She flipped her page, speaking clearly, “What would you like, Pansy?”
“Meaning I’m talking to him a lot, both in person and over text.”
“No… I s’pose not.”
“See you,” Ron said. Harry said nothing. Ron waved a hand in front of his eyes, snapping when that didn’t work.
Harry returned back to his phone, this time checking his messages. One from Ginny, asking about the date and time of their next practice. One from Neville—a funny picture of a weird plant in the greenhouse that he turned into a poor rendition of a meme. But hey, at least he was learning, like a lot of the students were who had never been exposed to muggle tech and pop-culture before. A section of the ministry had even been added to make muggle tech work with magic, and to develop wizarding versions of Google and social media that wouldn’t risk exposing their secret to the rest of the world. He laughed inwardly at the thought of his schoolmates using a wizarding Instagram or Snapchat—he could see it now. Hermione posting on her snap story a picture of all her textbooks followed by the timestamp, 3:00am. Awkwardly cute photos of Seamus and Dean, or Deamus as they all jokingly called the pair, on Instagram. Draco posting a selfie with a snarky caption, or maybe, just maybe, a picture of how he preferred to be… bundled up in a sweater by the fire reading a book, his hair loose with no gel, as he had so often been wearing it for the last few years.
“No, Bas,” Alistair laughed. “Draco’s from mum’s side of the family. Over in England.”
“Oh. Alright, what is it?”
"Maybe I really
She raised an eyebrow at him and looked back at the shirt. Well it didn't look very delicate. "You should wear it more, it's nice and soft. Maybe your cousins will take you shopping for more like it." She put it back over the back of his chair. "You should wear more casual, comfortable things, my love. Maybe in jewel tones. Although, a nice light blue sweater would look lovely, too."
“Think I'll keep to myself when they all come back… what with the war on and all.” He ran a translucent hand through his hair. Best to avoid anyone who knew him in life… explanations would be too painful and Draco might bring down the castle with him in his rage and despair.
And he saw the moment the wolf sank its huge sharp teeth into Draco’s pale neck.
without magic? Didn’t he feel… like an outsider?
Draco Malfoy
And all at once, the fight seemed to drain out of the dragon.
Usually, Harry Potter would then spend some time looking over his own research and findings before setting out to tend to the creatures themselves. Usually, Harry Potter spent his days with thestrals, fledgling hippogriffs, and ailing phoenixes, perhaps the rogue flaming salamander nest in Blackpool, or sightings of a grindylow family in the Thames—as had happened last April. He did his heavy academic research on dragons mainly, as well as the handful of other fire-associated beasts like chimeras, salamanders, and the phoenix.
“I guess maybe I just like pale things. I did always have a bit of a thing for Malfoy and that blond hair after all.” Harry said, laughing, “It was just a little bit inconvenient at school when I was supposed to be hating him.”
“Alright. Tipsy, but not overly so.” Which was strange, that he didn’t feel drunk. In most situations, it only took him a few glasses to reach ‘drunk’ but it felt like he’d only just begun to reach that state.
“Maybe he doesn’t… but he’d miss you every day, and he’d be heartbroken for a long time. Just because we’re grown up doesn’t mean we don’t need someone to love us.” Now it was Narcissa pulling him close and… And did she just…?
“But, have you seen a dragon around here recently?” Legends wouldn't help him if he couldn't find the beast.
I’ll bet wandless magic gets you hot under the collar, doesn’t it love? I think we’ll have to thoroughly test that. And dammit, you send me the most gorgeous smelling, softest jumper in existence and then tell me I can’t bloody come until your next letter! Eh, either way, I had a good few snuggles with it in my wolf form.
"Well, he has right to be so," Hermione huffed. "I don't expect you to have read any of the legislation, Harry, it's
Draco's eagle owl Porthos had delivered the letter and promptly decided on a nap. It wasn't necessarily an easy fly, even for such a large and strong owl. Draco absentmindedly pet the great bird's soft head. Damn… he'd have to reply, wouldn't he? Harry might tear up the world in looking for him. (The stalking never really stopped, had it?) Setting the envelope aside, Draco sighed softly. He would have to reply, but it could wait. Flexing his fingers, he stared down at them. Already, he was feeling different. He didn't like it.
“I will. I’m so used to talking with him, even letters. And I want to keep making sure he’s alright. Especially so close to the full moons.”
Hope you enjoy!
She nodded. “Thank you for doing what you can, but I believe we both know that Draco is particularly strong-willed at the worst of times. Why don’t we move to the dining room, though? You must be famished.”
Draco
She opened the door and they both stepped inside to find the room empty. Harry looked around, spying the perfectly made bed. “...where is he?”
"Bonjour! Did you find something?" He pecked his wife on the lips, a quick and casual kiss, and approached Draco. He hadn't spoken much to Remy at Sunday dinner, feeling overwhelmed as he was.
They escaped with Dobby's help, and Bellatrix's dagger had found its mark in the elf's chest even as they Apperated to Shell Cottage.
I grinned and giggled like a third year when you mentioned I'd be a Potter-Malfoy. I really do quite like the sound of it.
Yours,
Harry visible relaxed and sank into his chair, hands coming up to cover his face.
When Malfoy didn't show up to classes that day, Harry was certain the blond git was holed up in the hospital wing, moaning about being bruised from Harry's hexes. All in all, Harry was glad not to see him.
While I did dip into a bit of my funds, I am not entirely responsible for financing Hermione’s work. Plenty of people during the war were infected, as Greyback got more bloodthirsty and cruel near the end. Quite a few people would benefit from these reforms, including Lavender, Bill Weasley, and my godson Teddy. (Your mum and aunt Andy made contributions from the Black vaults, which I’m sure Sirius would’ve supported wholeheartedly.)
“I love spaghetti,” Draco said because he wanted to encourage the hell out of him. “Do you need any assistance?”
The entire thing was about radical acceptance, said Theo. If you owned everything you did from your worst decisions to your most grating personality traits, they were never a surprise when they were brought up in an argument. You held all the cards that your opponent intended to use against you.
After an unfortunate game of strip poker, everyone wound up being naked down to their underwear and decided that skinny dipping was the next logical step to be taken.
Simply trying was always the first step, wasn’t it? His therapist had once said something like that.
Harry and Theo were stunned speechless that Draco would rather throw the girl into the snake’s den than house her. Narcissa and Lucius beat out Harry and Theo’s protectiveness combined.
getting along fine,” Draco huffed before doing the unthinkable.
“Dancing,” Harry offered.
xxxxXXXXxxxx
Ruth could hardly believe it. “Oh, god,” she exclaimed with a bit of a southern twang. “This is so amazing!”
“Let me guess, you want me to rip those off you and breed you until you cry again?” Draco teased, rearing his hand back and bringing it back for a hard slap between Harry’s thighs.
I’ve wanted to write a chapter on the people in Azkaban since forever. Also, Ron and Harry’s bromance keeps me alive and well. Hope you guys enjoy!
Theodore Nott would understand perfectly when Draco told him—if Draco was allowed to tell him—that Harry bloody Potter had been occupying most of his free thoughts and now time.
“Like the magazine,” Harry said. He didn’t even know such parties existed outside of fiction with how limited his social life had been as an adult.
… “We’ll start right away.”
Draco’s heart softened while his cock only got harder to hear this. “Harry,” he breathed, drawing back his hips and sinking them in again, a first experimental thrust that had the both of them reeling and panting. “You have no idea how special you are. Daddy’s special boy—come here, come here.”
Hey everybody! It’s been a tough week, but every time someone favorites/follows/reviews my works, I get an email that brightens my day. Thank you.
Carefully and quietly, Harry shut the door behind himself like he’d been trained to in the Auror Academy. The last thing everyone needed was a convict on the loose.
Thank you for keeping mother company. You know well by now that the days since the war haven’t been kind to her. I hadn’t thought about what my leaving will do to her, but I dread what my return will entail. This is what’s best, right now. It has to be.
He thought about it, nodding along. “Yeah, I can smell most everyone else’s fine, but not mine. I don’t think Draco can really feel his own magic all that well, either.”
where the best money is.
“I’ve got quite the eye, huh? How about we start with the classic black on white?” He called over to Valerie, who was deep in the aisles now. “A low-rise pair?”
“Good afternoon, Tristan. Are you going to eat your lunch, today?”
Oh shit— he needed to let Draco know about her offer! He’d forgotten, with the drama of his first full moon, and Narcissa moving in. He’d mention it in his next one to Draco. He needed to be working on his Animagus transformation, actually… “Anything noteworthy, Harry?”
That sent her into another bout of laughter. "Harry dear, enough, I may blush! We'll not celebrate a thing until Draco is home safe, you hear me? I won’t age a day until he’s come home!”
“Merlin’s pants, he wants me back!”
Narcissa took a long breath in and sighed. “Truthfully, I don't know. The risk is too great for us to stay-- and if anyone asks where we are, you must say you haven't seen us. We were never here, Leesy. That is an order.”
Draco Malfoy had left the shop a pleased man, his forearm wrapped in clear plastic.
"I believe it would, yes, though I did not use one. It seems like something your father would've thought to employ, though. Exactly how many Mandrake leaves have you accidentally swallowed, Potter?"
“Thanks. Sorry for interrupting your Sunday lie-in. See you around, Parkinson.”
“Mmm two weeks ago. The Harpies had a few games, and I believe she is visiting Charlie, because the reserve is so close. Lavender tea?”
Gwen hummed a bit and collected the empty wine bottles from around the room. “Mm, that’s good. Did you have an alright night, my dear? All things considered?”
“No, you tell Mione that she’s got to be eating more, cause she’s eating for two, and maybe she’s not hungry, but the baby might be!” Oh jeez. Right in the middle of one of their spats about the pregnancy. Harry sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.
“Dad, calm down. Brigitte.” The blonde down at the other end of the table gave him a little wave. “Youngest cousin, out of all of us. And Grandma Gwen is holding
"The Mandrake leaf, generously supplied to you by Professor Longbottom, is the first step to seeing and therefore tapping into your magical core. Some say it causes hallucinations for Muggles or those with weak cores. You have nothing to worry about on that front." Harry gulped.
The dragon was staring at Harry now, seemingly hanging on his every word. Harry knew that he had the dragon now, that it wouldn’t be long before he would be able to get close enough to heal his wounds. Just a few more minutes should do it…
She seemed surprised at the question before she smiled and nodded. “Yes, he did. You’re looking to court someone?”
“Yes… Is there any chance I could get you to put it on hold? Just in case.” She raised an eyebrow at him, but opened the case anyway. Without a word, she carefully scooped up the pendant and its chain, carrying it to the counter.
“Aye we have,” another patron interrupted them. “Saw the shadow first on the 6th, was that a Tuesday?”
“You cooked when you were little, love?”
“Andromeda. She would say the camera loved her, but I think she loved the camera far more.” The photo showed a young girl, perhaps between her 3rd and 4th years of Hogwarts, dark curls pulled back into a low ponytail with a large bow. Her heart-shaped face and dark eyes made the foundation for woman Harry knew as his godson's grandmother, but what made him look for longer was her smile.
-he's still an orphan, and had to suffer many years of the Dursleys before Sirius and Remus came to get him (sirius was wrongly jailed for murder)
Interest piqued, he carefully broke the seal and then opened the smaller envelope inside, revealing a handwritten letter, not the usual Ministry memo.
attacking Harry. Even after Harry had directly caused him pain.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, close enough now to tell that the dragon was indeed a he. The dragon ignored him, and continued trying to push his large snout into the ground. Harry continued to observe, fascinated by this strange behaviour. Dragons normally didn’t let humans approach them without keeping a close eye on them, and he’d never seen one completely ignore the presence of a human.
Unsure what to do, and knowing that actually touching the dragon would be a bad idea, he took out his wand. He could at least perform a series of diagnostic spells that would tell him more about the dragon. But as soon as his wand was out, the dragon was back on his feet, snarling.
wine from 2002, they're just getting ready to release the first bottles. Come, meet more cousins." Draco nodded, unable to refuse as more unfamiliar faces turned their eyes to him. His mother always raised him for the aristocratic life, but this was a little much.
Please, disregard my last letter. I wrote that the morning after the full moon. I wasn’t in my right mind. And please —  forget I said anything about your —
"Mmm, you're very comfortable, I'll have you know. Best nap I've had in a long time, thanks." He gently patted and rubbed the dragon's flank, feeling the smooth scales and warm leathery hide under his palm. The dragon let out a crooning sound and a little wiggle rippled down the length of its body. It seemed… pleased?
-this makes explaining a few things kinda difficult, but it also leads to some funny bits of Harry trying to cover up the magic in his life from 5 well-meaning gay guys
“...Trainers?”
Albus bit his lip and stroked his beard, closing his eyes for a minute to think. Even in death, it seemed that Draco Malfoy would ruin his plans. “Heal his wounds, Poppy. We cannot deliver him to his parents in this state.”
much, after all.
“Oh,” he said faintly, feeling himself balk at the thought. Weasleys. He had discovered the French Weasleys. And they were
“Of course, Mistress. Leesy has not been seeing Master or Mistress since two summers ago.”
He watched Neville’s eyebrows hitch up. “She, uh… She left. End of last year.”
Draco Malfoy
and that it was
Harry my love,
Just at that moment, as though he'd summoned him, Porthos flew in with a letter from the very same wizard he'd been thinking of.
As he suspected, there was no Dark Mark on the boy’s left forearm. No, Riddle didn’t care enough to Mark him, but there were telltale scars from at least one session of Crucio curses by his hand. Albus sighed and shook his head. It was time to invent the narrative.
"I think it would be good for you and Mr. Malfoy, as well as the student body. The Gryffindor-Slytherin relations are still nonexistent." Ah, now it was all making sense.
“Okay. That’s… That’s fantastic then, right?” Why did it seem like it wouldn’t be that easy?
His smile fell a small amount. “I expect you will.” Sapphire and Remy turned away, bidding everyone else goodbye as they left. Draco felt someone gently tap his shoulder and turned to find Sebastien standing behind him.
Also, I know.
Narcissa nodded along as she picked up her spoon and took a small sip of her own soup. “Oh, I’m certain you eat just as much as he does." Harry copied her motions, ladling a bit of soup into his mouth. In all honesty, he had to suppress a groan of delight.
P.S. I like that.
Harry snickered at his own joke, not that the dragon would understand. Glancing at it, it was… Smoke was billowing out of its nostrils as he looked firmly away from Harry. What the hell was
Draco turned to look at Sapphire, and she smiled at him, nodding. “Remy and me, we own a shop together. We get plenty of young witches and wizards coming in for bonding jewelry, but just as many parents coming in for watches or earrings. We have a few muggle pieces, but most of ours are magical. You should come by, see what we have. Perhaps we could give your watch a tune-up. Remy always likes showing how it all works, besides."
“And when exactly did you see a werewolf shift before? The night he was bitten?”
“Sport shoes? Casual, not made of high quality leather, relatively cheap and easy to replace?” Draco shook his head, and Bas nodded, looking over at his sister. “Converse.”
Thank you so much for the continued support, everyone! Every email I get about a new kudos or comment brings a smile to my face.
“Sapphire. I hope you’re not too busy, right now?”
“And trés tragic, with all those husbands, hm?” Remy sipped his wine and arched an eyebrow at Draco. “So, her son… you and him, maybe are..?”
“I can’t believe the actual Queen of England came to visit me.”
"...Oh. Well, I suppose," she said with a tone that made it sound like that wasn't what she was talking about. But then what else could she be talking about? Complaining about Harry was his favorite pastime. But he wasn’t about to argue with Draco’s mother, especially when he was newly-bitten and definitely missing.
Attention stolen by
They walked alongside each other in comfortable silence for a few more minutes, Harry taking the time to truly appreciate the summer’s day. Hermione shot him a few smug looks as they walked as if she knew what he was feeling and he couldn’t help the grin that broke out across his face. Screw therapy. Maybe he’d just go for walks in the sun instead.
“What?” Now Hermione was determinedly not making eye contact with him. “Normal isn’t something I’m used to, remember?”
The aggravated noise Draco made across from them was loud and exasperated; clearly this was something they’d spoken on a lot together. Astoria laughed gently, sharing a knowing look with Harry and sidestepping him to exit through the doors near the fireplace.
“Say hi to Molly and Arthur for me, dear.”
“Yeah,” Seamus said with a grimace. “Shame he won’t make it back ’til the New Year but hey, work’s booming.”
Teddy sprinted down the hallway towards the sitting room, not bothering to give Harry an answer. He took that as an invitation to follow and quickly shucked off his oversized coat and snow-dampened boots by the door, opting to keep his beanie and gloves on while he defrosted a little longer. Walking down the hallway behind Andromeda brought him closer and closer to where Malfoy stood, the blonde only seeming to come to his senses and step back out of the doorway as Harry came close enough to smell sandalwood and—was that coriander?
It wasn’t much, but it was more than he had right now. “Yeah, thanks. I’d like that.”
Draco let out a soft, hollow laugh. “It’s the same reason Astoria was so worried about you ruining our marriage. Why I’ve avoided being alone with you, really.”
Hastily opening the door and ushering Malfoy inside, Harry panicked as he tried to think about the state he’d left all the rooms in. The kitchen should be safe, right?
“I want you to know, Harry. We’ll be getting married no matter what. He needs an heir, I need a husband.” She was staring directly into his eyes now, her gaze feeling like it was burning its way through his skull. “We’re both keeping our families happy. Do not dare get in the way of that because of some whimsical—”
Hexes were thrown, pranks were pulled: their friends didn’t seem to understand why they couldn’t come to a truce—
He watched as Harry’s eyes widened slightly before his head dropped, gaze focused on where his hands were tightly gripping his knees.
"You sound like Ginny," he grumbled, eyes staying pressed firmly shut as he tried not to think on how much what he was about to say hurt to think about. “Even if he missed the divorce announcement… That was so long ago, ‘Mione. There’s no way he’s missed all the bloody rubbish since then. If he wanted to talk, he’s had plenty of chances.”

For this life you created
His friends shouts were at first muffled and far away, as if he were in a memory that had been tampered with. It was only after someone touched his wand arm that the noise began to cut through the deafening roar of silence that had overtaken his body, shocking him back to reality.
They left the shop together, Malfoy still wearing his sentient feathered hat.
next chapter at some point tomorrow x
“No, thanks Kreacher.” Harry waved a hand in the elf’s direction as he heard the familiar crack signalling his departure.
Glancing back at Malfoy he could tell that they were both equally confused and he decided to hell with it, he was here now and therefore he was going to help the git find an owl before carrying on about his day as if nothing had happened. So much for making it back to training on time.
It wasn’t until he heard the unmistakably not-Draco’s throat clear to his left that Harry realised he may have been a bit rash in his actions and he froze, heart beating out of his chest.
side note for clarification: despite this chapter being 2017, in this story i am pretending that the wizarding world is incredibly backwards with muggle technology & nobody uses phones etc because we all know the harry potter books wouldn't have played out quite as well if people had been able to simply pick up a phone call to answer questions (no i am not specifically thinking about sirius in fifth year, why are you asking?)
Harry looked up from where he’d been reading at the kitchen table. “Would you like some assistance?”
“And Dean?”
Harry tried not to grimace as he remembered that day, and recognised just how much more interested he was now than he had been back then. Thankfully he’d matured enough not to shout about it anymore. “Does it matter if I am? Besides, I’m not sure Astoria would be okay with it either way.”
“Twenty minutes! Thank you, good bye!”
“You must be Ginevra Potter,” came the familiar voice behind his right shoulder. “I’m quite the fan of your column.”
“What kind of present is dinner?” Harry wondered aloud. “Seems a bit odd.”
“Great. And takeout for dinner? The Thai place looks great.”
“Harry, then. I am Healer Benson, on duty for the fourth floor tonight and from what I gathered during my discussion with Nurse Weilin and your diagnostics, this looked to be a simple case of stimulant overuse.”
Began melting icy hearts
Harry moved his queen across the board, taking out one of Draco’s knights in the process. “Not really.”
Shifting from one foot to the other, Draco shrugged. “Yeah, well. Don’t think about it too much. You clearly needed it and I honestly don’t know how any of your other friends hadn’t already thought of it. How anyone can stand to be in your house with Walburga, honestly…”
“But why shouldn’t we?”
“Oh.” Harry was stumped for words now, civil conversation still feeling like uncharted waters. “Er, that still doesn’t explain what you do all the time. Dating can’t be all of it?”
“I’ll let you finish this chat without me, darling.”
Choosing to simply grin and continue through to where everyone was gathered inside, Harry appreciated the bright colours and slightly unorthodox decorations. He told himself that was all he was looking for as he scoured the rooms he passed, rather than admit to himself just how desperately he was seeking a certain blonde.
“It’s a pleasure,” she said, turning back to Ginny and complimenting her dress. When Ginny perked up and exchanged compliments of her own, Harry tuned the two of them out as he prepared for how to react when Draco inevitably followed his wife over.
“Two friends who have sex sometimes and are hopelessly in love with one another,” she muttered with a glare in his direction.
What a miserable thought. Actually, what a miserable life. There was no point in pretending otherwise at this stage: Draco had long ago given up on the glamorous, exciting life as Malfoy heir that he had been promised as a young boy. What was once a title he revelled in boasting was now a trait that he wished he could run away from, a painful reminder of childhood dreams lay by the wayside. Surely it was better to have given up on a dream than on his life? He had given up all hope of survival in the past year, sure that his end was inevitable in the war or its aftermath, though unsure of the exact timeline. He wanted to be thankful for evading death for a while longer, yet being stuck with no company but his own thoughts for the next few years made him almost wish for it.
“It was a joke,” Ginny said, laughing. “But I do mean it. Don’t settle. Nobody’s worth that, not even Malfoy. No matter what you see in him.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes with a defiant resolve. “This is different and you know it.”
“Hmm?” Draco questioned with a blank look. “Oh, right. I’ll admit, it doesn’t look as awful as I’d thought.”
“Yeah, well.” Seamus shrugged, clearly not that put out by it. “It was a bit of a surprise when he first asked, but I think Dean’s more shocked she said yes than anything. I believe her words were something about his ‘brogue charm’.”
“Did so. I’m amazed the whole train didn’t hear you.”
“What, friends can’t help each other through rough times?”
Taking in the chaos before them, Harry nodded. “I think my parents might have been on to something just having one.”
i know ginny/harry isn't everyone's cup of tea (and this is definitely a drarry story!) but i am sticking to epilogue compliance so we've got ourselves a lily luna on the way. this will be the final ginny/harry relationship chapter though - i'm keeping her around though, i love supportive friend ginny! the epilogue did not do justice for what the two of them could have had as friends 😭
It wasn’t anything new to her, which hurt him more than anything. Maybe she hadn’t expected him to be so forthcoming about it but apparently he wasn’t the only one who had been giving their marriage a lot of thought in recent years. There was no shouting, just a resigned understanding and for that he was grateful. There even seemed to be an undertone of relief, both of them finally having all their cards on the table.
Harry grinned for a moment, realising immediately that he had been wrong about Hermione’s giftee and more importantly, about Draco’s motives all along. He then swore quite loudly, realising that he had absolutely buggered everything up.
Pouting into his lager, Harry was grateful when Ginny took the hint and changed the topic, only half listening as she went on to excitedly tell him about how happy Coach was with the new broom order. He knew he ought to be paying closer attention—it was his products she was chattering away about, after all—but he couldn’t drag his thoughts away from the blonde across the bar.
Taking her in as she stood before him he noticed how weary she looked; the light he used to see in her eyes seemed dulled, understandable from everything that had happened the last few years.
Shaking his head in a feeble attempt to chase the images out of his mind, Harry sighed. “I, er. It’s not really something you can help me with, I think.”
One of the benefits of being unemployed for almost six months was that Harry now had plenty of time to look after the kids. One of the drawbacks of being unemployed for almost six months was that Harry now had plenty of time to look after the kids.
Flickering through your mind’s eye
It took a few moments for each of them to let go of the other—smiling at your ex-rival was bound to distract you, Harry reasoned—and when Malfoy finally extracted his hand from Harry’s grip he took a step back, looking around uncertainly.
“Shut it, Malfoy.”
Harry grimaced. “They’ve got their own stuff going on. I don’t need to make it harder.”
“Death Eater, remember? Not many wizards who spare you a second glance, unless they're into some disturbing things.” Though his tone was lighthearted, Harry could hear the bitter edge to his words. “It’s also part of why I discouraged this from going much further, honestly. I don’t want Scorpius to deal with the world thinking his father’s seducing their Saviour for evil.”
Intending to find something to write on, Harry was instead greeted by the stack of letters that he
Percy was a sporadic attender of Weasley lunches these days, often too wrapped up in working overtime—or being a pompous arsehole—to stop by. Quite frankly, Harry didn’t care much for the man. They’d crossed paths a few times during his Auror days and none of the memories were particularly pleasant, with Hermione’s reports of interdepartmental negotiations reaffirming this; she said they were a downright horror if he was present.
The pleading look in Harry’s eyes as he turned to face Draco was all the confirmation he would ever need. “I never want to go back there. Not even for that.”
Many of the Slytherins hadn’t returned this year. Draco had resented McGonagall’s request for returning eighth-years to occupy the empty Slytherin dorm beds at first, even more so when students became civil with one another and started eating together in the Great Hall. Eventually everyone had accepted it, begun to enjoy it perhaps. Slowly the loss and horror that filled the air had dissipated with normality taking its place. It filled Draco with envy and a confusion he refused to address, for fear of recognising why he was the only person who couldn’t move past it all.
“Alright, alright. That’s not really what I meant,” Harry said with a laugh. “I just remember what you said about not disrespecting your marriage.”
“Being such a goddamn hero! Not everyone needs saving, Harry.”
“What are you doing all the time then? Surely you have some weekends free. Or weekdays? Do you even work?”
And with that she started her walk back to the house, fingers gently brushing against his right arm as she passed him. He dropped his head back, looking to the sky as if hoping it would have all the answers he was seeking right now, but knowing that he wasn’t going to find them up there.
Shaking his head, Draco had to tear his eyes away from Harry’s face. The naive confusion was cute. He wasn’t sure he was entirely ready to see it slip away.
Nodding, Ginny turned to the boiled kettle and poured them each a cup of tea. Harry accepted his gratefully, placing the hot mug on the table and watching Ginny carefully sit across from him. Flicking her wand, she summoned the box of gingerbread men that Molly had sent home with her earlier in the week and offered one to Harry. He declined, laughing as he watched her shrug before dipping one in her tea and biting its head off.
After a moment, Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well. If that will be all I daresay Harry has somewhere to be, wasn’t that right?”
“Her and the rest of the world,” Draco muttered bitterly. Looking up, he cleared his throat before speaking. “You’re the golden couple. Everyone loves you. Of course you’re good at marriage.”
“I don’t think we actually met the Mind Healers, but you make a good point.”
“Take care of this one please, both of you.” Healer Benson nodded to Ron and Hermione in turn before stepping aside to let Harry pass. “Make sure he gets some sleep.”
i've got most of the remaining chapters outlined/partially written at minimum so looking to be on track for finishing up by the end of the month 🎄💚
Shaking his head, Draco sighed. “It’s funny how much some people refuse to move on, Harry.”
“Yes, well. Glad you’ve managed to become more introspective this festive season.” Draco was rambling now, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips as warm breath caressed his face. “Perhaps you’ll start—“
“I know,” Hermione said gently. “Malfoy was just a kid. We all were.”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy uncertainly.
Draco snorted softly. “Do you?”
Draco snorted, shooting him a sideways glance. “Forgive me if I didn’t believe that at first. You were quite determined when I saw you in Diagon that day.”
“Oh?" Draco's eyebrows were up so high they disappeared beneath his woollen hat. "I’m surprised I haven’t seen that splashed across all of the magazines. What’d you do, obliviate the poor buggers when you were done?”
Finally closing the distance Harry cut off the end of Draco’s words and pressed their lips together, pushing Draco up against the cabinet. He pulled away after a moment, breathy.
“Don’t try and act like you haven’t just paced a hole in our kitchen floor, Harry.”
“Yeah, yeah. Saint Potter to the rescue, as always. Haven’t you got some kneazles to rescue from a tree or something?”
“Listen, Draco—I only meant, did something happen that night at the pub, y’know. You left and barely replied to my letters since then.”
After a moment’s pause Harry chanced a glance at Malfoy again, his expression unreadable. With a sigh, Harry ran a hand carelessly through his hair as he thought of how to bring back the mood of a few moments earlier.
Montage of cruel words
World crashing around him, Harry tried his best not to panic immediately. “Why not?”
“For the same reasons as you, I imagine.”
chapter inspired by
“You mean literally a few minutes ago? At the bar?”
Sliding his hand up to Draco’s shoulder, Harry pulled him close one last time and pressed a kiss against his jawline. “Stop overthinking today, alright? Everything’s going to be great.”
“Pay up then,” Seamus said. “Told you it’d happen before the night was over.”
“He has not!” Harry cried, before hastily dropping his voice as he noticed heads turning their direction. “He has not.”
Pressing his head into the back of the armchair, Harry sighed. Curse Hermione’s powers of observation. “Yeah, maybe that too.”
“We’ll be sending our own kids off soon,” he said softly. “Isn’t that scary?”
“Er…When he came by the shop, you mean?”
“Harry!”
“Well, I’m glad you did. Do you think you’ll visit often?” Harry cursed inwardly, shoving his hands in his coat pockets while hoping that his question hadn’t sounded as excited as it did in his head. “I mean… Andromeda could probably use more family visits. It’s been hard for her.”
“Scary?” Harry teased. Squeezing Draco’s hand, he gave a soft smile. “I’ve got you, love. I’ll be right here with you the whole time.”
“—and they’d have you on the front page in front of one of those rainbow flags. Wait, that’s a brilliant idea!”
“What about Pansy? You like her, don’t you?”
It was far from the first time they had seen each other since last Christmas at in Edington. They had first seen each other a few times in passing at the Ministry, though Draco was still infuriatingly silent on
They both paused as a waitress placed their steaming beverages before them. Harry grinned as he saw that the mugs matched the festive decor, looking like hollowed out upside-down Santas with handles attached to their sides. Rolling his eyes, Draco thanked the waitress before looking back at Harry.
“What?”
Seamus winced. “Yeah, can’t even imagine. Say, have you heard from Lee?”
Gingerly using his toe to lift the edge of the pile in front of him, Draco shuddered at his reality and his train of thought halted. He was a prisoner. A convicted criminal, in Azkaban. He knew it was temporary, that surely they couldn’t keep him in here indefinitely; the Wizengamot had been trying to put away as many Death Eaters as possible to make an example of them and instill faith in the public but a few glowing testimonies in his favour had worked wonders for the possibility of spending any time less than life here. His mind was just stuck on an infinite loop of Shacklebolt’s voice saying “Draco Malfoy, you are hereby sentenced to Azkaban,” before two stern guards had grabbed either bicep and carted him out of the hearing room to a temporary holding cell within the Ministry.
“Take you where?” Harry asked, ears catching the name at the forefront of his mind. “What was that about Draco?”
chapter prompted by
Cheers erupted from every house in the vicinity as a new millennium dawned and with it, what felt like a fresh hope for wizardkind. Harry turned his head to Ginny beside him, pulling her close and pressing his lips to hers for a moment before separating with a grin.
“It’s funny, I didn’t expect to care so much.” She left out a broken laugh as her shoulders shook before curling in on herself, arms wrapping around her torso. “These past weeks… Maybe even longer than that. It felt like maybe this wasn’t right for us anyway. Like I’d wanted you because I couldn’t have you and then you left, and I kept wanting this idea I had for our future together. I almost feel like we were just doing what everyone expected us to do. Does that make sense?”
Whatever question Draco had been expecting, that definitely wasn’t it. “You disappeared for three months—
“Your family, that’s what.” Eyes downcast, Draco mumbled his next words. “I want to make a good impression.”
Would do it again
Stepping inside
“Don’t even think about it, Harry. You’ve always been a rubbish liar.”
He dropped his gaze to look at where he was poking the carpet with his trainer, unable to take the loving frustration directed at him.
The eye roll that followed showed that Teddy didn’t buy his excuse, but he indulged Harry nonetheless. “My friend Nick says there’s real cool lights in Muggle London this time of year. Draco said he’d take us next week, ‘cause he can’t be here today.”
“I can hardly be blamed for the whims of dark creatures,” Draco drawled, trying to mask his discomfort. Guilt was hardly a new feeling these past years, but coupled with the familiar tone of Harry’s voice it was almost enough to make him regret agreeing to meet here. “Ow!”
“Why not?”
The ire dripping from her voice sent chills across Harry’s back and he was thankful not to be entirely on the receiving end of it this time. He felt Ron shift beside him, clearly uncomfortable with the tension around them but also not willing to face Hermione’s wrath if he tried to calm her right now.
“I didn’t say any of those things!”
“Almost,” Harry admitted with another sigh. “And then he, I don’t know, panicked? He just ran off without a word.”
“Don’t be stupid. I know you loved me every bit as I loved you, and we will always have this. I just also see that Malfoy has held your interest for far longer than you’re willing to admit, in ways you probably overlooked back then.”
“Then you won’t have to.”
His protest was met with silence as both Seamus and Harry winced, grateful they weren’t in his position.
“Do you regret it?” His voice was low, the tremble in it only noticeable for how well Harry could read Draco after so many years.
“Scorpius, dear. It’s wonderful to see you.” Over his shoulder, she winked at Harry with a playful smile. “I’ll have him at the Manor in the morning in plenty of time for your date.”
Satisfied that Andromeda would handle the situation, Harry stepped closer to where Draco was leaning by the doorway, frown affixed on his face as if he’d been hit with a permanent sticking charm. He watched the blonde’s eyes glance at him as he approached, before murmuring low enough so the others wouldn’t hear. “Come home with me?”
John merely grunted, turning on his heel and leaving the store. Harry watched as he merged into the crowd and became just one of many roaming the streets today, a sea of faces drifting past.
“…You don’t?”
“Are you kidding me?!”
“Malfoy?” He returned, taking a few hesitant steps closer. “What are you doing here?”
“Oh.” Feeling his cheeks heat up, Harry looked away. “Sorry. I just assumed—”
“Draco…” He looked up, meeting eyes that looked every colour of scared under the sun. Dropping his grip, Harry sighed. “I—I’m sorry. You’re right.”
Mary stood before them, notepad and pen in hand as she prepared to take their orders. Harry liked her; dark features and style making her seem unapproachable at first glance but hiding a heart of gold and wicked sense of humour beneath the tough exterior. She’d been the first waitress they’d ever had at
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy took the proffered hand and sealed the deal with a firm handshake. “You’re absurd.”
She sighed. “Your eyes. They’re starting to look horrible again.”
The nights he slept were the worst.
It had been a few hours of dancing around awkward topics and pandering to all of Teddy’s requests while Andromeda looked on fondly; Harry still felt uneasy around Malfoy but it seemed to be more his nerves than any actual lingering resentment. As the hours passed he was also beginning to understand why Teddy had been so adamant on having both him and Malfoy there for their small Christmas morning celebrations. Perhaps it was seeing the way Malfoy and Teddy cared for one another, or the flowing conversation that Harry had witnessed out of the corner of his eye between him and Andromeda while supervising Teddy on his new broom. He suspected the wine also had something to do with it, liquid courage giving him the boost he needed to get through to lunchtime without starting a fight or embarrassing himself too terribly. They were sharing the couch and a bottle of eggnog now, Andromeda putting Teddy down for a nap in the other room
“You can’t entirely blame me for—”
two chapters out from the ✨epilogue✨!
“And the rest of them still remember me as the person I was twenty years ago.”
“Sorry, James is just finally getting sleepy. Do you mind if we go home so I can put him to bed?”
The slight change in tone was enough for Harry to plow ahead. “What do you say to… I don’t know. Not hating each other anymore. Being friends, even?”
“I’m sure Harry doesn’t—”
With a sigh, Draco shrugged. “I want to hope that’s the case.” His eyes searched Harry’s face for a moment, their grey depths seeming to find whatever it is he was looking for before he stepped forward into Harry’s embrace.
“I… Adult things? He’s obsessed with me?”
“I suppose so. Maybe it’s just the Firewhiskey.”
“But you hate letting—oh.” Harry groaned. “No. Now you’re treating me like I’m fragile. I’m fine.” At her raised eyebrows, he continued. “Really! It was just another stupid trial.”
“I don’t know, Gin. I really don’t know.”
Sighing, Harry leaned back and ran a hand through his hair. “I suppose not. It’s just not what I thought I would have.”
Seeing James looking across the room at Draco in the chair above him, Harry tensed slightly beneath Draco’s hands, eyes opening fully to preempt any bad behaviour before it could take off. Something seemed to transpire between them, a conversation held with their eyes alone—it reminded him of Ron and Hermione and his heart ached with the nostalgia—before there was a subtle nod from James. Curious, Harry turned his head up to look at Draco who glanced away as soon as their eyes met.
Chilling wind blows strong
“Was that charm for the store’s protection, or their own?” Draco asked as he followed Harry’s lead and took a seat atop the brick. “Because it seemed too well rehearsed to be the first time you’ve had to do that.”
That didn’t mean he wanted to sleep. The magical flare up earlier had him worried that perhaps another nightmare would be enough to break through the silencing charm and the last thing he needed tonight was another trip to St Mungo’s. The only upside he could see to an overnight stay was that they’d surely get frustrated with his screaming after a while and let him have some Dreamless Sleep, right? It was a low selling point in comparison to having to speak about the hallucinations and his ever-growing loss of control.
You gave yourself to his love
Sitting up straighter, Harry’s eyes came alight as he looked towards Draco. “No pain here. No Latin here. Out here it’s just… Us. Us being friends, if you want?”
“Oh, stop being so dramatic. Here, move your hands.”
Clearing his throat as he stepped out of the darkness, Draco saw Potter’s steps falter, his frame going rigid.
This wasn’t love. “Gin… No. I love you.”
Harry grumbled, quickening his pace to keep up with Hermione a few steps ahead of him. “That was the worst hour of my life.”
“I don’t actually know,” he admitted. “More than three, that’s for sure.”
“If you hadn’t come back for me that day…” Voice barely audible, Draco hated how small he felt. He chanced a look at Harry and found himself pinned again.
The elf raised an eyebrow and with a snap of his long, wrinkled fingers he disappeared. Harry heard a muted crack from elsewhere in the house and wondered if there was a book on wizarding illnesses in the Noble House of Black. He supposed it made sense and he should have just looked for himself first before involving Kreacher.
Shaking now, Harry felt his breath catch in his chest. “Oh. That’s good then—”
about it and felt out of place in this ostentatious Manor room.
“I get it.” Potter nodded, taking a hesitant step closer to Draco before stopping. “What if… Would it help if someone else was with you?”
Percy was the one to break it, grabbing his drink and taking a swig before speaking again. “See what your actions have done, Harry? You could be so much more than this.”
“But then… Why can’t I just take Wideye to cancel out Dreamless Sleep, and the other way around?”
“Alright, John. I’m sure you’ve lost people and it hurts. Trust me, I know. But Malfoy here didn’t kill them and he’s dealing with his own actions now.” Harry paused, trying to think of their deescalation training last week. “Do you think your sister would want you here, threatening someone who doesn’t deserve it?”
“I know, I know.”
“I’ve missed you,” Draco murmured against his lips.
“You don’t have to dance around it, Harry. Friends is what you want. I think… Perhaps not. Not right now at least,” he amended, gaze dropping to the floor once more.
Harry wasn’t okay. Maybe that thought should have scared him more than it did but instead it felt like a confirmation of who he’d always suspected himself to be deep down. The freak who’d been locked away. The boy marked for death before he’d been allowed to live. There was pain in these thoughts but there was also a familiar comfort and he pressed his eyes shut tightly as he vaguely registered the distant sound of objects breaking, something crashing to the floor. Nails dug deep into the palms of his hands as suddenly the room fell silent, moments before his world went black.
“That’s beside the point.”
Taking a seat on his bed once more, Harry summoned his shoes from beside the door where he’d kicked them off yesterday and slid the scuffed trainers on before grabbing a set of crumpled black robes off the floor, tossing them over his shoulder carelessly. One day he might master ironing spells but for now, he knew Hermione would take offence to them and do it for him. He stood and made his way over to the door, checking that he had his wand and grabbing a bag of galleons from atop the dresser to stuff into his robe pocket once he threw them on.
next chap up in a few hours!
“Oh, but where are my manners? Astoria Greengrass, soon to be Malfoy. Apologies for presuming you knew.”
Harry waited until he couldn’t hear her footsteps anymore and decided to apparate back to Grimmauld Place. Ron would understand. He would no doubt be waiting for them both to come back inside and after seeing Ginny’s face, it was probably best to give the house a bit of space for the time being. Beginning his walk up the hill to get outside the wards, he noticed again how cold it was—had the night gotten even colder?—and quickened his pace, thinking of the fireplace waiting for him back at his home. Harry almost felt guilty having Kreacher cook most nights but he was secretly hoping that maybe the elf had noticed Harry’s lack of presence and would take matters into his own hands, assuming Hermione wasn’t home to tell him no.
“Are you sure we have to do this today?” Draco asked,
“Mmm. I don’t think I’d feel comfortable talking to any of those Mind Healers though. They all knew too much about me, it was a bit creepy.”
“Evidently.”
“And Severus would have hated it. How does Ginevra feel about the name?”
Harry gave her a knowing look in response, shaking his head fondly. “Yeah, it’s kinda impressive.”
“Mother wants me to come visit more often. She’s not doing well,” Draco admitted. “The healers think they’ve caught whatever is causing her grief early enough to treat it, but I’m still worried.”
“Er, yeah. I guess it kinda does make sense.”
“The bloody hell it wasn’t. Sirius was my Godfather!”
. “That’s a bloody relief.”
And then Molly was embracing Draco; what little tension had built instantly left the room, Harry taking in Draco’s apparent shock over her shoulder with a grin. Making the rounds to greet everyone, he kept a watchful eye across the room as Weasley after Weasley gave Draco the same warm welcome they’d extend to any of the family and he felt his heart swell so much he thought it might burst.
Stepping forward once more, Harry lifted Draco’s chin with a finger, eyes locked on his. “No. You’re hard to regret, Draco.” Pressing a chaste kiss against the other man’s mouth, he felt the corners of Draco’s lips pull up in a serene smile.
“You know how we spoke about the, um, thing before we left the house this afternoon?”
Taking every ounce of courage not to cower at the obvious disappointment behind her reprimand, Harry schooled his features into a wide smile as he nodded. “Right, no more Wideye. I can do that. Is that all?”
After a few moments of meeting Draco’s eyes and hurriedly looking away at what he found there, Harry cleared his throat. “Er, what are you doing in Diagon?”
A silence filled the room, amplifying the racing of Harry’s heartbeat. He didn’t want to stay in St Mungo’s. Undoubtedly he’d be expected to actually sleep at some point and from the sounds of it, the perceived promise of Dreamless Sleep he’d come here hoping for was entirely off the table, meaning he would inevitably fall victim to the nightmares once more. It was bad enough having Hermione hear them whenever he allowed himself more than a moment of rest; the thought of everyone in the vicinity of his ward being aware of his darkest moments was one that he didn’t even want to consider.
“…And you thought you’d try asking me if he’d already bought it for himself, so you could beat him to it if he hadn’t.” Harry grinned, shaking his head at his friend. “Unless he got it while I wasn’t in, you should be safe. Tell you what, I’ll check the purchase history now.”
“So you’re not shipping me off to therapy?” Harry let out a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding, feeling infinitely lighter than he had since he’d first laid eyes on
Harry put his arms out expectantly. “Here, I’ll take him.”
Never taking his eyes from the boy beside him, Draco felt the corners of his mouth pull up in a hopeful smile. “
Hermione laughed before quickly covering her mouth. “Harry!”
Connecting the dots, Draco raised an eyebrow in Harry’s direction. “She’s also related to me, you idiot.”
“Harry.”
“I will, but…” Casting aside the torrential flood of thoughts as best he could, Harry drew his attention back to the situation at hand. “What about you? What about marrying someone you love?”
“I suppose not.” Sighing, Draco offered a strained smile. “I was sorry to hear about your divorce, by the way.”
Rivals now lovers
It was the use of his given name that made Draco hesitate, it seemed. He paused, turning to face Harry and looking torn between frustration and… Something Harry couldn’t quite put a name to, but felt reflected in his own stare.
“That’s good then. Anything interesting happening?”
“Draco, entertain them for a bit please? Take them to the rink or something. I’ll be a few minutes.”
Ignoring Ginny’s laughter across the table, Harry wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and wandlessly cleaned what he could of the mess in front of him. “You didn’t mention that in your letters.”
“Glad to hear it,” he said as he pasted a smile on his face. “I’m not looking forward to sleeping, but I guess if that’ll fix it…”
Before Harry had the chance to thank him, the elf disappeared once more and after stretching his arms overhead and marvelling at his newfound vitality, Harry stood and began to locate something acceptable to wear from amongst the chaotic mountains of clothing and miscellaneous items strewn across his bedroom floor.
Rolling his eyes, Harry sighed. “That was last Thursday.”
In the past year since their conversation in Draco’s study, Harry had come to Malfoy Manor more times than he’d ever dared to hope. It had been more frequent in the early months, when they’d still been navigating their issues from the years of dancing around one another and keeping the secret from their respective children. Astoria had been able to entertain Scorpius, allowing them the space to be alone and uninterrupted. After everyone had returned to school it had simply made more sense for Draco to stay with Harry, so that on the nights he couldn’t have Ginny watch Luna, Draco could floo over after she’d fallen asleep. Harry associated his own home with their relationship more strongly, but perhaps that was simply because they had become more comfortable with one another during the time they’d spent there.
She laughed, placing her mug back on the table. “Not really. You’re just a very confused man. Have you ever considered that Draco and your job are related?”
There was another Weasley jumper knitted that year.
, you said. Your pain is my pain.”
He sighed. “I did. I just didn’t want to worry you.”
The familiar shout came from the front of the shop and Harry looked up from where he’d been unloading the latest delivery of polishing kits to see Seamus in the doorway, grinning from ear to ear.
“Tell me about Secret Santa.”
to James before I want to hex someone’s bollocks off.”
Draco sighed, leaning back and tilting his head to the sky. “That’s not it, Harry.”
It took all of two seconds for him to give in, slumping against the back of his chair. “I didn’t tell you because there’s not much to tell,” he admitted. “It’s nothing serious.”
Words lost as you stare
Icicles form on your breath
“My point exactly.” With a sigh, Draco mirrored Harry and took his mug of black coffee into his hands. “Don’t worry about it.”
. “You want to know why why I’m scared to let this happen, even casually?”
He felt the hair on his neck stand up as flashes of dimly lit scenes flashed through his mind. A table, a graveyard, a door, a veil, a flash of green light, a white station with the promise of something more.
With that she stood and smoothed out the creases on the front of her Healer robes before gesturing to the door. “You are cleared to go.”
“Yeah.” Harry let out a sour laugh, shaking his head in frustration. “Yeah, because despite how ridiculous you’ve been, I still want this. And I want to believe that things could be different, Draco, I really do. But you have to understand that you’ve gotten my hopes up and then run away too many times now.” Pleading tone creeping into his voice as he spoke, Harry’s words were a desperate whisper. “I’ve given you so many chances.”
He’d already run the scenarios through his mind; Hermione would panic before immediately doing all the research she could, Ministry work be damned, while Ron would grimace and remind them both halfheartedly that “You-Know-Who can’t really be alive… Can he?”
“Of course. No offence, but I’d hardly put my family and friends through that based on a few conversations with you.”
“Do I get to see your new house?” Scorpius asked, excitement practically radiating off him in waves as he cut off Harry’s retort. At her answering nod, he turned his head back to look at Albus. “Al, I get to half-live in London!”
He couldn’t even imagine what a normal life would be like. He’d never had one, not really, and every time it had appeared like maybe, just maybe this time would be different, the people he cared about were ripped away from him again.
“Sounds like Harry about him,” Ginny chimed in, sending both women into peals of laughter.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m going to stay away, like he asked.”
Locking eyes with Harry over the rim of his mug, Draco gave a small nod. “Yeah. Me too, Harry.”
The cell was damp and musty, unsurprising when Draco considered that the island was shrouded in perpetual rain. But for one corner where there appeared to be a crack in the ceiling, there was no light from above and the small amount of light coming in from between the cell bars was just enough to see how dusty they were. The floor was cold beneath his thin prison-issued socks and felt uneven but worn down, no doubt by the pacing of occupants before him. Though he knew that the dementors had vacated their positions he couldn’t shake the feeling of despair and hopelessness that cloaked him; the chill in the air seemed less weather-induced than he cared to admit. Above all, Draco felt lost. He was alone for the foreseeable future and while he was no stranger to isolation, it had usually been his own decision.
It was a crisp Autumn morning when Harry arrived at King’s Cross station to see Teddy off for his first year at Hogwarts. He had begun to make peace with the idea that he may never see Draco Malfoy again, instead focusing his efforts on building up the relationships around him and allowing his friends all the love and companionship they deserved.
Turning on his heel and heading in the direction of home, Harry smiled as he heard the soft goodbye said behind him before the telltale crack of apparition sounded.
“Remind me again why this doesn’t count?”
As he watched Draco making his way back to the stairs, Harry scrambled for something to say but came up blank. “Draco…”
Harry’s eyes were so focussed on drinking Malfoy in across the bar that it took him by surprise when Ginny slid in to the seat next to him, nudging him in the ribs.
“We all had to make choices, John. Be better than this. Make the right choice now.”
“How, what exactly?” Draco questioned, even as he suspected he knew what was being asked. “Words, Potter.”
They’d had quite the year since their last Christmas light adventure. Draco adamantly refused to have Harry over to the manor, or to come visit Harry in Edington despite Ginny having moved into her own flat early in the year. Instead they had met a few times at muggle cafes, reminding Harry of what felt like a lifetime ago before they’d both become fathers and had so much more responsibility. Letters were exchanged with more regularity and even outside of September, they had crossed paths seeing Teddy many times. It was nothing Harry could call more than friendship, but he was more than happy for it to remain so, as long as Draco stayed in his life.
“Besides, after facing the press more times than I care to remember this year… What’s a den of Weasleys?”
“Mister Potter,” came the unfamiliar voice. “Draco mentioned he owled. He was stupid enough to think you wouldn’t come here.”
“If that’s the case, then why show up tonight at all?” Draco stormed around the desk, coming face to face with Harry, rage radiating off them both and filling the room. “You barge in here, throwing accusations and demanding answers as if you actually—”
“Alright, alright.” Seamus raised his hands in mock surrender. “Show me yours, I’ll show you mine. Seems fair.”
Harry snorted. “Maybe because it’s a bit depressing that I’m unemployed and divorced with three kids at the ripe old age of 28?”
“I’m not sure those were my words,” Harry said cautiously.
Pressing his eyes shut tightly, he forced all of his muscles to clench and then relaxed them slowly, one at a time. Without even realising he had moved to touch it, he lifted his hand away from where it had ended up on his scar; though he wasn’t bothered by pains in his forehead anymore, it still seemed to be a reflex whenever things became too much to handle. Harry couldn’t remember the last night he had spent where things hadn’t overwhelmed him and he had given up wondering when it would finally come.
Turning to look at her grimace, Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Yes?” He said, voice dropping to a whisper. “Yes, Draco?”
“Nothing! Why is she so concerned about me ruining your marriage?”
“I just wondered…” She paused, biting her lip as she thought. “Have you heard from him?”
Draco sighed, running a hand through the loose strands of hair that framed his face. “I just… It’s inadvisable.”
Draco had reached the bottom of the staircase now and Harry drank him in, from the loose blonde strands that framed his face to the pale, slender feet that rested atop the carpet. He wore a loose linen shirt, the top three buttons undone to expose his chest, with plain joggers covering his legs.
Sticking his tongue out at Draco, Harry shared a conspiratorial look with the waitress as she hid her laugh behind the notepad.
Harry didn’t know if he would ever stop running.
“You can’t be serious.” She raised an eyebrow and upon realising that he didn’t have more to say, continued. “You keep making time to come here to see Ron! I know you’re at the Ministry a lot but I’m there too sometimes! It’s not hard to come see me, Harry. You just don’t want to.”
“I’ve been wondering… What would you think about moving here? We’re together more nights than we’re apart these days, and I know,” Draco said quickly, silencing Harry’s immediate response. “We spend most of our time at your house. I love it there, I really do, but I can’t give up the Manor, Harry.”
“I think that’s quite enough.”
Jacket cut to fit
Suddenly an idea came to him. Harry removed his toothbrush from his mouth and finished rinsing out the foaming paste. Standing up straight and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he took a few slow breaths to prepare himself.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. I’ll …” He sighed, feeling the exhaustion finally hit. “I’ll find out later, I suppose. Home?”
“That the Prophet’s a load of shit?” Harry guessed, unsure what Draco was getting at. “That we ought to protest outside the Ministry until they gave us better quality journalism?”
“I’m not—”

Drawing his wand he quickly charmed the curtains shock but not before Malfoy’s face had gone into an apparent state of shock.
“Did you want to…?”
How much of that statement felt true anymore? They had been at each other’s throats far longer than they’d kept pleasant company. Maybe Harry had become too involved; not in the same way Draco apparently had, but in that he had pinned too much hope on redemption and turning a new page. Had he become taken with an idea, rather than with what he was actually being presented with?
Deciding that they should forego finding a floo location, Harry let Draco apparate Teddy while he took Nick. If Andromeda was unimpressed or confused by their appearance at the front door instead of the fireplace, she didn’t mention it, taking Harry’s hurried whispers by ways of explanation and assuring him that she’d speak with the boys before sending Nick home.
“It doesn’t have to be complicated, Draco.”
She gave him a peck on the cheek before leaving him sitting at the table on his own, feeling more confused than ever. Harry took that as his cue and with one last lingering glance at Malfoy—which he promptly pretended never happened—he slid off the barstool, grabbed his jacket from where it had fallen to the floor and pulled it on as he made his way to the exit, along with the gloves and beanie he’d left tucked into the pockets.
“About me?” Draco asked, feigning horror at the thought. “Who in Merlin’s name wouldn’t like me?”
“But you are here for something.” It was an observation, not a question, and Draco knew Potter well enough to see his discomfort. “Tell me. Why have you followed me somewhere that anyone with a brain would realise I want to be alone?”
wearing perfectly tailored robes that he used to save for days when he’d visited the Ministry with his father and wanted to seem important. They weren’t enough to make him feel powerful anymore. His mother’s idea to have him dressed to the nines was in hopes of reminding everyone that he was an upstanding citizen who deserved sympathy; Draco thought dressing in rags might have had a better chance at getting him the pity vote. It was unlikely anyone in this court room would forget his wrongdoings because of his appearance.
“This is me telling you that you deserve more than you think you do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
So he nodded, giving her a small smile as he agreed to wait until the new year: the first step in righting his wrongs.
He was the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, and though he doubted the Prophet would ever let anyone forget who he was, he didn’t know how to move forward from here. He hadn’t the faintest idea what he actually wanted to do now that he had the choice. He wasn’t sure how much choice he really had, not having completed any of his seventh schooling year, but the fact was that now he had all the time in the world, and no clue how to spend it. He felt lost. Hopeless, if he was being honest with himself.
They were in the stands overlooking the Quidditch pitch again: the only place where Draco felt like he could be every part his true self with Harry.
Turning, Harry came almost nose to nose with Malfoy; it seemed that even with Harry’s slight growth spurt over the past few months, Malfoy still had a few inches on him. The sharp lines of his face were less harsh than they'd been when Harry saw him at his trial earlier that year. He even seemed less pointy somehow, like he was finally growing into his features, and it wasn't an unpleasant look on him. It was strange, being this close to his childhood nemesis and not feeling any of the usual animosity; the urge to rile him up seemed to have died and in its place was simply... nothing. They stood like that for a moment before Harry took a quick step back, not realising how close they’d been while he stared.
The wind chill had Harry pulling his scarf up over his face and wishing he’d left his Auror robes on for an extra layer of warmth, attention they garnered be damned; even with the jumper and coat he was wearing he could feel the essence of winter deep in his bones. Weaving his way through the hurried crowds Harry once again wondered why he continually scheduled his Christmas shopping for lunch breaks despite knowing that the crowds were an absolute nightmare.
“Well. I hope you die in your cell cold and alone, hoping that someday I’ll come back,” Theo told his father cheerily. How else was one supposed to respond to the person that murdered their mother? “Because I never will.”
“Right. Goodbye, then.” And he turned away from her, leaving the office of The Prophet without a soul spotting him. He’d made it—and no one would know it was him.
But they weren’t.
All of that holding back she’d been able to break through with the two men suddenly swelled back up in her chest like a mushroom cloud. Who was she to make them pay for a party? What if they broke something? What if something went wrong?
Draco snorted. At least Potter could see the humor in that. “Open it.”
Maybe divination wasn’t so bad.
Oh, Draco really wished he hadn’t acted like such an arse earlier. This bloke was actually funny, and he’d gone and fucked it up when he forgot that not everyone was as fortunate as him.
“Want a slice?” he asked Harry and Grace. If they didn’t, Draco hardly minded shoveling chocolate cake in his face alone. Malfoys were experts at filling emotional voids with everything from jewelry to cocoa.
Draco wondered, as he walked the baby to the nursery and away from the family hug that the delivery room had devolved into, if he should introduce himself.
“Watch it, bitch,” a burly man said when she bumped into him. He had a pack of men around him, and seemed to be the alpha male.
“Your first revolution was the abolishment of love potions when you mentioned Tom Riddle was conceived under one. Thousands took up that banner and now those dangerous potions are off of the streets. Your second? You showed the world what real love looked like. That Quibbler interview—I cried, Harry, I did. You’re doing important work.”
“You’re getting
Theo actually felt himself go mad across from Colin, his knee involuntarily bouncing up and down under the table cloth. He hadn’t even touched his lobster dinner.
Draco’s tongue flicked out to lick his lips. Harry was so beautiful, did this man know how beautiful he was? It occurred to Draco that he should probably say it more. “Such a pretty thing,” Draco lilted.
Draco passed Harry the vial of lubricant and Draco’s fingers lingered on his.
“Watch your mouth,” Lucius tried before the panicking peahen jumped right back up onto the neatly-made bed. Nobody had used that guest room in years. In fact, the Lestranges were the last ones to even set foot inside.
As she withdrew her face from the crook of Harry Malfoy-Potter’s shoulder, Rachel realized what a fool she had been, thinking she could go through with this. “I’m sorry,” she said again, terribly embarrassed.
“I can blame you for whatever I want. You made me take three separate trips to the pharmacy! You weren’t satisfied with regular tissues, no, you
“We both do,” Hermione nodded. “And if-and-or-when he breaks your heart, know we will always be your best friends. We will always be here for you.”
“With friend like her is it so hard to see why I’m emotionally disturbed?” she tried at humor.
“How did
Harry got lavish gifts, extravagant vacations, surprise bouquets of flowers and massage gift cards, and chocolate from around the world. Draco treated him at every opportunity, just like he would treat their baby.
Draco shook his head. “There are lots of muggleborn girls you have to choose from now. Poor ones, illiterate ones, even disabled ones!”
“Maybe I want to give you ideas,” Harry replied instinctually, giving himself no time to think of whether it was wise or not.
“Then don’t last,” Harry urged, pulsing up in his thrusts with such effort that sweat dripped down the back of his neck.
The man passed it to Mulciber Jr., who had been seething from the minute he walked in. Mulciber was never a joyous man, but this was different. His jaw was clamped tight enough to break his skull.
Since Draco had been the one who pursued Harry for the date, he decided his kindness ended there and the other man would simply have to come to him if he wanted anything more. Draco didn’t like work; he liked watching men work for him. Half-hard. In heels. This was getting off-subject.
The few grumbles they managed to exchange were strictly fact-based.
He impaled himself onto Draco, hissing with delight when he was finally all the way inside of him. Harry’s knees felt weak even though he was lying down.
He was surprisingly nonchalant about the whole ‘flirtationship with a stranger on the internet’ thing. Harry had his fair share of online friends, some of them from when he was just a kid messing around on Runescape. Maybe it had desensitized him to the dangers of it all and maybe it would be his downfall someday, but it hadn’t affected him yet.
Urquhart glanced to the sky, then back at Harry. “Yeah, sure.” He turned back to his team. “Oi! All of you, down here! We’re scrimmaging Gryffindor!”
Ron swallowed, then gestured to Harry’s phone. “Are you gunna answer that?”
The door swung open, and Draco stepped through, grumbling under his breath. Seeing Harry’s bare feet he looked up, head tilted ever so slightly. Harry pursed his lips. “They got you good.”
Miraculously, Harry slept with no nightmares. He expected to dream about the war, however, being in a new environment in the castle that he’d never seen before might’ve had something to do with it. He smiled to himself upon that realization, pondering how he’d gotten that lucky. His smile faltered, however, when he wondered if everyone had had the same luck.
“Are you sure about that?” Seamus joked.
“Well you also don’t not try not to whoop everyone’s ass with your smart-ass intellect, Granger.”
I have the brains to do it.”
‘No one’s been interested. Thought they knew me already, or just didn’t care enough. Friendship isn’t what they wanted.’
Harry couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face at the sight of Draco, eyes lit up with passion. This was clearly something he truly enjoyed… something that was his own and not pressed on him or tainted by everything that had happened.
The class laughed. Malfoy sneered at them. That seemed normal enough, but something was nagging at Harry. He couldn’t get what happened last night out of his head. Couldn’t ignore the look Blaise was giving the blond that he thought no one else could see as Malfoy kept his head bowed. Couldn’t help but feel like there was something wrong with this picture.
“How’s Flitwick?”
“Okay. I’ll see you later.”
“I don’t care if he isn’t fine,” said Wayne, speaking for the first time in a while. “He was a Death Eater. He
“The very same.”
He cursed himself mentally due to his reply. His brain whirled, trying to come up with another way to get him to talk.
Harry snorted. “Can anyone? Does
“How’d that go?” Ron asked.
“I’m sorry.” His attention fled to the front of the room, taking in the splintered desk, the smoking quill. The dark-skinned boy on the floor next to it, hands over his ears, tense. “I’m so sorry!” Seamus cried, bottom lip trembling as he stared out over all of the crouched students, and back at McGonagall, who had also dropped to the floor. “I… I didn’t mean to scare anyone… I…”
He shrugged them off as he typed back.
Harry shrugged. “I still haven’t found it. Draco and I will have to use the one that’s still out there.”
Harry sniggered. “Hey look, ‘Mione. He’s goth.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“For fucks sake, Potter,” he snapped, raising his head to look at Harry. “Will you just shut up?”
‘I think I should ask for your advice more often ;)’
“Sodd off, Harry,” Ron chortled. Harry made a face, to which Ron only shook his head, grinning.
At that word, Draco flinched, his face contorting and a strangled noise escaping his throat. Harry and Blaise both jumped slightly, looking at each other, bewildered. Harry tentatively stretched out a hand and placed in on Draco’s arm, but he pushed him off, clearly not wanting to be touched. Blaise held his hands out in a ‘what the hell do we do now’ gesture. Harry scratched the nape of his neck. “Wait?” Blaise huffed, clearly wanting to do something else to snap the blond out if this. But eventually his face softened as he watched the terror in Draco’s grimace as he sat with his eyes closed, trembling.
“And I’m enjoying my book.”
He could hear the annoyance in her voice as she spoke. “The Ministry is going after Narcissa Malfoy, again.”
“Well… I heard her telling Susan last night that she’d hooked up with someone.”
“It’s nothing, honestly. Just drop it.”
Harry counted them off on his fingers. “Let’s see… we have highlighters, pencils, pens, Sharpies…” He stopped when he saw both of their blank faces. “Highlighters are bright coloured ink that you put over words in a textbook to mark important stuff. And sharpies are permanent markers.” More blank faces. “Like pens… uh… they’re usually thicker but sharpies have fine points usually… but I guess Crayolas are washable so they also aren’t always permanent like pen…”
Draco tentatively took the parchment from Harry’s hand and read the note, then looked back up at him. “You… you don’t have to thank her, Harry. It’s the least she could do.”
‘What house are you in?’
Harry read the text again, shook his head then typed back. ‘
Harry shook his head, turning to Ron. “Huh? No.” He stood and headed for the shower. He slipped into the shower Malfoy had clearly just been in, as it was the only vacant one. Once the door closed Harry turned the water on so that it was burning hot. He never got hot showers as a child, and now he cherished them. What he was not expecting was the pungent, metallic odour that filled his nose once the steam started rising. At first, Harry wasn’t sure what it was, but his eyes suddenly widened and he gagged on the realization that the smell was blood. Why had Malfoy been bleeding?
Malfoy’s eyes widened in horror as he lowered his wand, staring around the room, taking in their words. He looked back at Harry, eyes dim.
Harry and Hermione exchanged concerned glances, then returned to their potion. They both knew what the other was thinking. They too, as had many around them, reacted similarly to things before. The realization was slightly startling, as he had been on the other side. As reluctant as he’d been, he had still been a Death Eater. But both students also were aware that he’d had it rough over the last few years, too.
“You’re serious?”
Harry had missed flying desperately during the war and was ecstatic every time he had gotten on a broom since. That night’s quidditch practice was not exception. He hovered slightly above the middle ring, watching the chasers weave in and out of each other and take shots on Ron. Ginny managed a few, winking at her brother as she soared around the hoop. He sneered back at her, mumbling a few choice words under his breath at her snarkiness. Harry shook his head with a smile at the two of them. They were always bickering when around each other, but it was humorous for the rest of them to watch during meals or when Ginny had visited the common room a couple of times.
Dean nodded. “Fair point. You want to call them over, or should I?”
It started as strictly a symptom of anxiety, back in sixth year. The stress was too much for him, and when he became overwhelmed, upset, scared, or anxious, he often was sick as a result. However, it had evolved passed that… and he wasn’t in control anymore.
Harry nodded, shrugging his robes on. “That’s true. I just feel really bad when I wake people up because I know how hard it is for some of us to sleep at all.”
“I think that’s his point,” said Ron, nodding. “If we’re gunna spend a whole year with them, we should all know each other.”
His shoulders were shaking with sobs. “I’m so—so sorry! I’m sorry, Prof—professor. I’m sorry.” He turned on his heel, racing from the room, a hand pressed to his mouth to stifle the sounds. It didn’t work. The class watched as Dean, still looking shaken, tailed after him and out into the hall, where Seamus was adamantly breaking-down.
Harry smiled, then silently summoned his deck of cards from his trunk. It whizzed into his hand and he moved to sit on the floor with Justin, the carpet much softer than he’d realized. “’Mione, do you wanna play 31?”
Harry glanced up at the sound of Pansy’s voice. “This would look good on you,” she said to Hermione, pointing to something on a page of her volume of
“I know who you are,” Ned whispered. “Hermione Granger. That’s Ron Weasley, and he’s Harry Potter. Everyone knows who you are…”
Draco made a distressed sound.
“Obviously. What did you think I was doing, jerking off? I’ll have you know that sunscreen actually makes for terrible lube,” he grumbled.
“What?”
As the designated one with manners for the day, Harry was the first to speak. “Hello.”
“Finally!” Harry said and clapped Kingsley on the back. “You straights do love marriage, huh?”
Without even seeing Grace’s sad smile, Tiffany rushed out of the door to her date.
“Sleepy,” shrugged Angela.
“I know, mother.”
As Draco softened it was an inevitability, though, and Draco soon slid out leaving dribbles of come in his wake. “Harry,” Draco panted, sliding up next to him and taking him up in his arms once more. Draco rested his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, kissing the salty skin there. “Harry fucking Potter…”
“And such?” Harry asked maintaining his grin.
“Oh yeah? It says here in your skull fragments that you’re a huge, huge fucking gay.”
“Something to tell you,” Draco finished.
“That’s a rose. You named your child after one, remember?”
“No more re-takes when you laugh so hard you start coughing,” Draco reminded him. “Live TV.”
“You always have a nice view,” Draco reminded him. “Me.”
“Shouldn’t it be your reputation you look out for?” Blaise questioned. “Your whole live-in fantasy would be a field day for the Prophet with how little they understand about what it means to be a Dominant. They’d demonize you for doing this in the Manor especially.”
A little breath escaped Draco. This was his cousin he was staring at, however many times removed they were, and the last of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black besides him. Given that Draco was far from producing any biological children, Teddy was the last hope for the purity-loving Blacks to even maintain a drop of their lineage. How they must be rolling in their graves.
Draco chuckled to himself and anticipated a cough, but one never came. “I have specific needs, Harry. You can’t blame me for going after them.”
Harry was going to fall asleep on the floor of Azkaban, he really was. “Who’s next?” he asked Ron. The question gave him a serious sense of déjà vu from the previous evening.
“But you have a picture of him, right?” Draco asked.
He stormed down the street and out of sight before Grace could turn around to show Draco her armfuls of clothing. The window right behind Draco with little yellow birds painted on it would have given Grace the perfect view of her ex had he not run off.
“The name.”
“Yes!” Grace shouted. “I won’t have to keep the baby, I can get the adoptive parents to pay my medical bills, and my tits will get huge after it’s born. It’s a win-win for everyone!” Aside from the fact that his was the second-worst thing that had ever happened to her.
Part of that was because he wasn’t sure how to answer it.
“Strange?” she laughed slowly, shakily. “Go fuck yourself, ‘strange’. You don’t get to be fucking quirky and clever when my mum is dead. I bet you think you’re so fucking witty and eloquent. I bet your stupid husband tells you that every day and you don’t even think about my mother.”
On the opposite side of the invitation was a single phrase: Crème Brûlée. The password and the safeword.
“But we have nothing else!”
Harry sighed and rested his head on Sirius’ shoulder. “Thank you, then,” he murmured. “I think it was something I needed to do. The Academy training was rough, but now… I don’t know. It feels worth it, somehow.” He wasn’t making much sense, but Harry never had to explain himself to Sirius. Sirius just took things as they were.
“I’m surprised your dads didn’t show up with a magic camera to capture the moment,” Hugo said simply so he would get out of his own head.
“Never.” Sirius kissed his collarbone before entwining their bodies entirely. Their muddy shoes were on and they were a veritable wreck, but they stayed still. “Never.”
Draco and Harry gratefully followed if only to leave the stone-hard chairs behind.
