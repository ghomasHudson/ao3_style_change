Mr. Kreacher has been assisting the History professors as a liaison with the Elf community and is currently working with Professor Stiger on an extensive revision of his “History of Wizarding Travel” book. Did you know that apparition was originally taught to wizards from an Elf that had befriended a Gringotts Goblin?
Arthur can use his license to make PK’s for the evening return to the Manor. He needs a wedding job.
I’ve known Draco since school. I’m Godmother to his son Scorpius. If you think I’m biased you will be correct. If that bothers you? Please know that I don’t care.
After doing some actual sleuthing I’ve found that yes, the Potter/Malfoy wedding is actually exclusive to the (
I like that huge window behind it. That’s more leaded glass like what’s in the kitchen downstairs. It’s dark out now so it must be lit up from the exterior somehow, we'll have to check out the ballroom before we go. The wall tile is nice with the floors.
“It’s a conservatory. More like another room extension. A massive, fancy room made out of glass. I mean look at that roof.”
NO. I did not know this. FUCK. Scorp said that Trandy was going to come over a couple days a week to help out, but I figured Zebb was going to Grimmauld.
Well I suppose I should close this up. We just all wanted you to know. Good job Gin. Say Hi to Jerry!
Well, I’m going to have the family meeting there. Just for the hell of it. Prank the family and tell them this is my new home. The kids always say I go overboard. Wait until they see what one of their ancestors did!
Oh no. That’s terrible. I’m so sorry. About both actually, but mostly about the walking stick. I also think she might be serious about the shoes. I’ll speak with her.
Our Goblin teams are quite competitive, “Tuesday Nite Hurling” is comparable to your quidditch matches.
Mr. Liogell will once again present Harry’s Lordship acceptance paperwork and the addendum. Then he will present Harry’s intent to secure his Wizengamot seats upon immediate receipt. At this point she knows who controls the Wizengamot.
Just to clarify, I have NO intentions of bringing Kreacher back to the Black house as anything other than a consultant. Never would I have ever thought this ongoing situation would have to do with those Elf heads. I’m quite frankly horrified. That’s terrible! It makes me sad. I swear I’ll figure out a way to repair this! Do you really think Walburga murdered them?!
I’ll give tours of my train room and help out Bee if he needs it. I’m actually interested in how it’s going to go. And it really is a rehearsal for the potion convention. We’ll want to see how it works. We can always at least go up to our level if we need to get away from the crowd?
It’s just a simple statement the says you’ve accepted the titles and have intent to take your Wizengamot seats immediately. I can work with Hugo on those if you’d like.
If you have questions about what the wording is, Hugo can provide that to you in advance. It’s very short and to the point.
For years, the public has been curious about Harry Potter and he has agreed to allow an exhibition of some personal items. The exhibition space will be augmented with selected items from his personal inheritances and collections. This will be a unique opportunity for the public.
Victoire will be integral on environmental issues. We’ve been ignoring these things while the Muggle world is struggling with it. It’s real and the Wizarding World needs to step up and take part. Victoire can be that liaison among other issues.
“Now, if you babysit you are going to lock those balconies off. Windows locked. Doors locked. Entrance door too!
Snape said the process was like slowly coming out of a dream. He could slowly see things more clearly as it went along. Could observe McCull and his brushes and potions but couldn’t communicate until the painting was completed. Sounds like he performed some kind of ritual too. What did McCull have access to when he painted it? Of the professor’s things?
“No. I never really got into it with Hermione . . .figured she’d just want to dig and give me a headache, but yeah, I think all stasis and fidelius and umm all that stuff. Gringotts said they’d sort it out. And like I said, Ginny and the kids never showed any interest so I just let it be."
Ask her when she’s available. We can Portkey over to her studio with them. If she say’s no, remind her that her childhood friend will not be pleased!
“We need to pack a couple changes of clothes to bring along just in case. Dry jumpers and coats too. It could end up to be a troll shack next to a dead tree and a moldy mess.”
“Of course you can. This would just make it easier. Besides, I’ve given Al & Scorp the freaking cottage, and Jamie and Ted a whole fucking block of Diagon. If it makes you feel better the lease is the same as Rose and Hugo’s.”
“Oh Harry, the ballroom. There was so much music. So much before Pollux died. Nearly every evening after dinner. Light the stage?”
“Take it slow. We’re just going past the fountain and to the gate. Pull up just a little and it will slow down.”
Well, will you look at that. Scorp hadn’t even finished typing that message and they’re already here. Am I ever going to get my baby back?
“He’ll be home soon. He’s coming with us to dinner. We should ask him to show you the potions lab. That’s his photo here on the mantle with the boys . . . . we're married now . . . . do you remember him?”
Dad and Jerry are the worst by far, don’t kid yourselves. They should NOT be allowed to be in the same room together. And now Dad’s going to force us ALL to sing karaoke. Every damned holiday.
Narcissa’s dish sounds wonderful! I’d like to bring a vegetarian Thai larb to go with that. It’s a spicy mushroom (shiitake) with peanut, lime, mint, ginger and shallot. It’s not an authentic dish but it’s TASTY! I’ll need a prep area and one extra large skillet.
You can tell. He asked about my haircut and said I should go on the perfect pooch show or something. Asked if we would be dancing today, seemed disappointed when we said not today.
The evening was everything one might expect. Fantastic food, camaraderie and even a broom race between James Lupin-Potter and his Uncle Charlie Weasley who was accompanied to “The Burrow” by Mr. Ogden Wahlington. Charlie won the race.
They’ve done that already I think. They’ve got a mysterious patron who annually funds the general budget and special projects. Apparently the budget for that increased quite a lot. Same up in Romania.
It’s just a buffet style dinner. Some of it is probably going to be Muggle takeout if I’m honest. CASUAL.
We’re heading home. I can’t believe how much fun this was. Potter Lodge is a very special place. Thank you again for sharing it with us.
“Then he was angry because he messed up and wouldn’t be able to take care of the kids. That certainly didn’t make sense. So I put him on a calming draught and the drip so I could take the tests. I did a full scan and everything looks fine. Better than fine actually, but I was concerned he had a brain injury from his fall.”
He’s like that. If he has an audience he feels obligated to be cutting and derogatory. Has an image to uphold! Did you talk about your Dad?
Let’s just do that then. Makes it easier for everyone. And then with the agreement saying anything “that day” it can mean to extend to the family meeting?
I’ve changed the wards. You’re all welcome to either floo or just apparate to the front entrance. I’ll have some refreshments.
“Before? This was a room where that fucking Walburga tapestry was hung. It was just awful. Gloomy and dank. This is what happened when they did the restoration ritual.”
“Remember, it’s charmed. From up here it's made to look nice for the residents of the complex. They don’t have access to it.”
“No. . . . This is more important. You spend time with them while they’re here. They took time off from the bird sanctuary. . . .Now, you might want to show them around a bit? Why don’t you and Hugo show them your office and your place next door. Give them a tour of the progress on the house.”
Let me put it this way. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter showed up unannounced in a chauffeured vintage Rolls. With photographs.
Really I’m just fucking pregnant and emotional and I’m stuck in this flat with the television unless I need to go check on the plants and even then Scorp insists on coming with me and I’m about ready to loose it. Like you lose it. The shite is going to start shaking. I might burn something!
Harry’s project at Grimmauld is fascinating. I’m more than happy to be asked to assist. Andromeda too. The project is also by extension a favor for my Grandson, and, as you know, I would do anything for Scorpius. Also, I am looking forward to seeing Mr. Kreacher. It’s possible Molly Weasley may join us as well.
Of course I will miss having you for our watercolour session. The idea to invite Albus to join me leaves me a little intimidated, but I’ll consider it.
I don’t know what to say? I had no idea or wasn't paying attention? You know I get confused about some of this stuff.
“Translation sticks. Free with purchase and for use in the store if they want them. We don’t want to have to repackage everything. Try it out.”
“Well boys, I’m glad you chose this room first. I’m happy to inform that I believe this one to be the worst of the lot. Well, maybe the card room is worse.”
“Not completely, only until Uncle Nev takes the headmaster position and even then I’m only working at Hogwarts three days per week.”
“Yes that’s the best one. Cheng. I seriously doubt it’s still there. WAIT. How in the FUCK is that phone and list still there after all this?!”
“They were ugly. I fixed them. Just a clean-up and I upholstered the seats with the blue leather to match the towel stripe.”
“I know what you’re thinking. . . .they’re protected just like the one I did at the cottage. Little kids can’t get near them. That’s a standard charm I put on all of my water features.”
“He’ll probably do four or five of those big loops and then tighten it up and go into a tall slide and a humpty bump..”
“You haven't made it yet this year. It may as well be a love potion. Makes me all warm and fuzzy, the boys will love it and I miss it.”
“Well, I thought I’d tell you about the marriage and something else while I’m here. Then Draco and I would like to talk with you about a project we’re working on.”
“It would make Blaise happy. Open a storefront for the soaps and perfumes. I don’t know, sell fun stuff that compliments that? Could even be novelty things like Muggle shaving brushes and scarves. Just fun but really nicely made things. Don’t sell the medicinal potions. Just cosmetic stuff. You could even have Ron come up with a fancy version of the chameleon hair brush for it. Decorate it with some of that junk from the old Black vault cleaned up nice. Those old chandeliers were pretty cool. . . Make it look mysterious but classic and bright like your study upstairs. You should talk with Louis about that stuff. He’d be all over it. And just do the French versions of the things. People love that and they look nice on a shelf or dressing table. . . . So then you’ve got a storefront and you know there’s warehouse space in Knockturn. Use that as a central distribution point. We already own the buildings. Team up with Ron and George on the owl orders. They need production space for the custom party stuff like they’ve done up in Wales. Again. Double win!”
It’s pretty bad. The kids really did a number on the dueling dummys this time. Not sure if they can be repaired but I’ll try. They also really went all in on the section I did on non-magical self defense so yes the whole place got pretty torn up. What are you doing?
You may have already seen the photographs of myself, my Sister-in-law Hermione and her Daughter Rose assisting with the clean up. The replacement of the roof created an untenable mess so we stepped in with brooms and spells to mitigate the dust and debris to not only the former Burkes space, but to the efforts of the merchants in the area to the initial cleanup. And yes, we spelled clean many a window while the Minister’s parents helped keep things tidy on the ground level.
NO. I'm not telling. And I definitely don't know, or WANT to know EVERYTHING about your intimate relations.
Liogell is going to hire a small staff for when I’m there. And a couple to make tea while we're touring. Says the place was rarely used.
Yes of course I’ll want them for Grimmauld. But I have to get this place cleaned out and done first. Ask the kids if they want anything. I’m looking around, this is a LOT of miscellaneous. I’m not going to take much other than the family photos and my office stuff.
“Okay here’s another way to look at this thing. It’s now become an issue with the Wizards and Witches. You have more options. Have you talked to Lucy about this yet?”
Proxies please stand. See? I’ve got notes and everything! Printed on cards! Grayson and Hugo did a fantastic job.
You’re talking about our Rose? The one who never shows any interest in anything other than her job and doesn’t date anyone, EVER?
“Because I’ve been working on this case for two years and I’m nervous. You two have no idea how difficult it’s been. I’ve had to fight every day for these boys. They’re special. Jonathan really does love things like the idea of a ladybug bedroom. Some people don’t get it. You do. . . .David makes wands out of random sticks and because of accidental magic sometimes they work. I can’t explain that part.”
“Second floor. . . . .This is going to be the “no children section” then . . . . .another safe room dedicated to the fireworks . . . . . through there are stock rooms. . . . . . .and . . . . . .this is production.”
I love spring rolls and larb! I would like to request Zebb’s chicken and mushroom pot pies with the puff pastry. I’ll do all the usual steamed vegetable side dishes and I’d like to ask Grayson to help me out if he’s not helping Dad? Draco and Scorp will watch Aspen and help wrangle the boys.
“I brought you a croissant and coffee. Just black though. Here’s that Muggle creamer you like. . . . . I’m still afraid of that steam thing. I tried to use it and it screamed at me.”
“I had an idea, Draco liked it. I contracted Millicent and got Scorp and Severus to input the details about what they needed to do it. . . . . look . . . . all of the necessary potions are brewed directly on the site and we’ve added a whole storey just below that for palliative care.”
“I can’t say I didn’t like the floating part. . . . you have my permission to try it again, but give me a fucking warning next time!”
I KNOW. The heel makes the slipper discussion irrelevant. . . . .No rubies and a heel make the description completely inadequate and suspect. Those are court shoes, NOT slippers.
Let’s please just include them all in both events. If the non-family order members choose not to attend the dinner afterwards it’s fine.
Do what you need to do and rally whoever you need but try to keep it to a minimum. Your house is the most protected. I will suggest they stay there.
“Mix it up. Go to John Lewis for basics. . .take him to Covent Garden for some cool stuff. . . .they’ve got great trainers at Ellis Brigham.”
“I can’t tell you or I’m subject to the consequences. But for the recipient it’s nothing but bad jokes for 6 hours.”
Jerry did an impromptu restoration ritual? I think he actually broke a 6-decade old Goblin Fidelius. It was so cool!
I know this is a problem. I can send my assistants down to get an actual count. What I can tell you is that it is more than 100 and less than 200. They all date from a time in the 1500’s.
It’s on. Everything has been moved from the penthouse. Shelving is up along the north wall. Main furnishings are in place. We can spend our time unpacking, arranging and placing. Best thing? Harry has an appointment a Gringotts. 10:00. Meet here then.
“I’ve lost count. . . .but if you take a look they’re separated into set’s. Each piece of the set is called a train car. . . . . when it’s put together with the cars and engine and caboose it’s a complete train.”
“Yes. The automobiles are inside. The doors swing out into the street and block the sidewalk. You’ll want to change that.”
“I know, but I need to know why it’s so popular. Just why did someone think coloured wax would be a tasty treat for halloween. It’s ugly, tasteless has nothing to do with halloween. It doesn’t even look like real corn! I’m calling it bogus.”
“Those fucking articles when Teddy started Hogwarts. We nearly had to release your medical records to the press to prove to the public you weren’t part werewolf.”
“Again, Louis had the idea. He found it when he was touring vaults with Jay. There are others down there too. The Peverell vault is fucking HUGE.”
“I can imagine the wizard news will follow us from here. I brought the Muggle music player with the earphones for you. I’ve even had Scorpius upload the Molly Hatchet and Nickelback."
“Well that sucks. All of that nice green space right off of your house and all you can do is look at it?”
“I haven’t figured that out yet. There’s time. Maybe get Ron to go to Trandy’s wine bar and prank him there. I will get him though, when he’s not expecting it.”
“Narcissa is going to explain the events. There’s the first nights dinner banquet, the morning breakfast. Then the bond ceremony, wedding, wizard’s vow and rings presentation. Then we move to the reception ball, then the final dinner. You must pay attention to the details.”
“We pull in through the vendor loading dock. The twiz is all set up to go through the barrier and we can park in front of the Wheezes!”
“ . . . . . . . . . . Back. . . . . she lost her squid. . . . . .So, I’m helping Uncle Nev set up Darwin once Lucy’s settled in a dorm. He’s HUGE.”
Right. I get it. Gramps would never buy something like that. The hangover potion though? You know how bad the lag is for me with the time change?
“Al and I, we joke about men. Point out the cute ones. But for me, it’s always only Al. It’s only always been him.”
Of course. It’s mostly just her school friends. A couple other parents. She’s into unicorns, rainbows and hedgehogs.
I can agree. Liogell know’s pretty much everything. He can answer almost any question you have or guide you in the right direction.
“Again, your Grandmother wasn’t messing around. Your Grandfather must have sent an actual bonsai master to the west coast of the States to find this one. These are not just pretty plants. This is a collection of some of the best specimens of the art of bonsai.”
Knockturn Alley has been under a slow resurgence for many years. It has become a pleasant destination for magical nightlife with clubs, pubs and other nighttime activities.
I like that idea because we won’t really have the place for fireworks. We might by next year though and we can switch?
“I can’t yet. I’ve got to look around. What the hell. Painting over the fireplace is well, almost peaceful.”
Alright, I have instructed Mindy and her staff to sweep the house for all of Lucius’ remaining personal effects, regardless of value. The remnants should perhaps be only a robe and a few random hair ribbons but we’ll see. Mindy was not happy to hear about that walking stick. I’ve invited her to stay and be witness to its demise. She may also join us for a beverage in celebration after.
Of course I have. And Draco is bringing me around. I want those things as much as you do! We’ve been complaining about this crap forever. We have an opportunity to actually do something in more than piecemeal increments.
Just joking. But let’s lighten it up a little and not go down the war trap? You said it yourself, so let’s put that to rest for today.
At this time it is traditional for the escort to hand the betrothed to the surrogates. Both Mr. Trandy and Ms. Zebb held both Albus and Scorpius back for a heartfelt embrace and kind personal words before letting the wedding continue.
Yes. Today. I’m going to head over there when we’re done here. Cemetery first. Then find a real estate agent!
Suckers! I just get to receive guests at the manor with Mum and Narcissa and you guys have to do all the work!
They are pleasantly surprised with the gesture. I brought in the pamper team. Perfectly appropriate for the dinner. Not too extravagant. Even Rose is excited now. Francois and Vincent did an amazing job. Jocelyn did her relaxing facials, neck massage and manicures all around. Completely spoiled them all.
Okay you kids will not understand. I have been struggling with these fucking muggle carpets for MONTHS. I’ve tried all my best hexes, charms and even a potion that put a hole straight through the floor into the basement. There’s a 2 year waiting list for Dean and Seamus (Thanks to these two jesters who monopolize their time).
Jay! I’m finally on a break! Sorry it took so long to get back. We’re BUSY! Yes that sounds like a good plan. Make sure they’re all on my payroll through this next Saturday. It’s not the merchants fault, I caused this.
Clean up and repaint. Same color scheme (Harry has samples for the olive main color, grey trim and red for widow sashes and doors).
“I don’t think so, NO I’m not doing it Draco. I know you, and to make it worse your Mother is with us so don’t start! I’ll bet Al will try though.”
10 should be fine. We’ll be ready. You go do your thing and text back when it’s time. Send Zebb and Trandy up here!
The floo in the entry is the easiest, but any mode of travel is fine. I’ll open up the wards and key in the guest list.
Those are all technicalities that we’ll talk about at another time. It’s all in the past and nothing can be done about it. Okay. Any ACTUAL questions???
I know! But it really is going to be cool. I’ve had so much thrown at me over this past little while. I think I’m getting used to having change thrust on me.
Most of what you’re asking for is pretty straight forward, just time consuming. The materials are readily available. I actually think we have enough grey marble left over from the Centre to do all of it. A lot if not most of the cleaning/restoring of fixtures, woodwork and the like can be done with magic. One of the women on our crew does fantastic work on stone so the chimneys and fireplaces will look nearly new.
“Alright Lucy, this one is custom. . . .”Retraxitsimul” you have to say it just like that and point your wand at it like this just up from between your eyes. It’s a little awkward, but works. It will put that lemon right back to normal.”
Jerry blew a hole in the side of Rose and Hugo’s townhouse and the Goblins had to be brought in to do damage control.
“More like an enclosed balcony that elevates to the second level. Installed again in the early 1900’s. Very innovative for it’s time.”
Okay, food then nothing too pretentious. Just decent variety. I will be disappointed if there’s not at least a roasted boar with an apple in it’s mouth.
1. Mr. Potter and I have been business partners for years and we frequently meet over a meal in a public restaurant (“clandestine!”). If we didn’t enjoy each other’s company we would not be in business together. We also both enjoy art and as such it should not be “SHOCKING” that we would attend an exhibit of said art. Stop speculating about things of which you do not know.
“We don’t know. It’s possible that it will not be successful. If not, then we will alter the charm to accommodate.”
“They’ve been working on their roof garden strategy. I thought it was cute to look across and see the fairy lights at night before. What they’re doing now is even better. Double roof garden.”
“He won’t land though he’ll just tease us by floating there at eye level. So fucking predictable. . . . . he calls this the “victors lounge chair”.”
“Fairy sounds. We had to promise not to wake the whole neighbourhood. A truly sad development in my opinion!”
Oh and the bathrooms. Draco says we can do a temporary magic fix for the family meeting. But we’re talking basically no plumbing at all. They hand pump water in the kitchens. Luckily we know someone who’s good at a quick magical fix.
Credit that to Jamie and Teddy. They’ve gone to the association and proposed a few things so we’re not competing, but working together on some projects.
“I like my birthday just fine. I just do it different. When I was little I didn’t have birthdays. Mister Hagrid and I spend that day together. I’ll explain better someday, but I like my birthdays.”
Mr. Kreacher casts the first Confingo, Bombarda or the hex of his choosing. I’m teaching him my best and he’s using the wand of Sirius Black with permission from the Minister. The Black Sisters have second opportunity and I’ve got a surprise myself if they’re unsuccessful.
“I can make the kettle heat up really fast. I can turn on and off the lights. I can make pretty ceiling stars. I can rearrange my room, open the blinds? I can make the hoover clean the flat by itself when Dad isn’t home. Things like that.”
Absolutely not. We’re just going to talk about whatever you’d like. No list of questions. You tell me what you want my readers to know about?
“Crazy Bella just says something like: “OH. Cool it’s THE wand”, but for some reason none of them make a connection. It’s so fucking obvious that Harry is sitting in front of them. Anyone could see it, but because I said I didn’t think it was him????
Rose and Hugo are even chomping at the bit. The whole family has been buzzing all night. Ron’s about to burst. Molly and Arthur are another story altogether. They’re ready to head over to Ted and Jamie’s and break the door down. You need to warn them! I have a feeling it’s going to be a very busy day.
“Next year. We’ll take a month off and spend it at the lodge. We can relax in the pools and sauna. Take walks in the forest.”
Well it was quite a while ago when we did it, before any of us knew he was living with Draco. In the middle of the interview he comes downstairs out of the shower in like half of a towel.
You are receiving this notice because you have signed and agreed to the disclosure agreement with Hermione Granger-Weasley, Minister of Magic on behalf of Gringotts and Mr. Harry J. Potter.
I would be thrilled with that. He’s certainly more than capable. It would be real promotion for him. HE will be thrilled with that.
So, including myself that’s 38 persons. There may be a couple more to add at the last minute. Do you think that’s reasonable with the timeline I’ve set out?
“Also, Miss Cam, Please have some light food and beverages prepared for everyone. We will all celebrate the opening of the Lodge today.”
At least the extras don’t go to waste. There’s always someone who can’t get tickets outside the venue.
The bathrooms all need updated. Most of fixtures are in fine working order, but outdated. Except for that blasted shower room. The shower layout is fine but it’s UGH. And the sinks. So I’d say just clean up the cabinetry and go with the same quartz counters we’re doing in the kitchen with porcelain sinks that are square. Who thought those oval sinks were a good idea? We fit the bathrooms all out with brushed nickel accessories. Faucets, cabinet pulls, etc. That shower needs to be AK’d. I don’t understand the muggle plumbing at all. Why did you do muggle for the showers? Just WHY? WHY?
“That card room is fine. Clean up the woodwork buy some new games. The chess set is a classic. I don’t know if you noticed, but there are playing cards that border on pornographic, dispose of those. The kids are going to want muggle Jenga. Shay could probably have that whole floor cleaned and brightened up the way you want it in a day after you get rid of that furniture. His charm work is excellent. And then there’s that second “ballroom”.”
I’m sure they just let him stand there in the conductors hat for the photo but LOOK AT HIM! I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile like that!
Only a couple more hours in France. Dargon Apotecaire now. Then I need to swing back to Wales then to the Cottage. Should be over in about 5 hours tops. AND since your surprise Portkey License my efficiency has been vastly improved!
I know this is getting old, but we promised to wait until after Al and Scorpius’ wedding. I’m reminded that we need to do that interview with Luna.
“The same as at home, just use incendio on the magic lava stones. Or we can go down to the beach and gather beach sticks to add to it.”
“We decided to join you for the fireworks. I understand I’m now the competition for a babysitting challenge. Unfair advantage and all.”
Draco. You’ve got to see this. It’s unbelievable. There must have been at least 20 Elfs working on the place all night. She had the entire interior redone. Put up all of those chandeliers with that massive one in the entrance just as you walk in the door. Shows through all those windows from the street. The whole place is sparkling. It looks like a freaking jewelry box.
“Correct. I have my notes. . . .He attended Hogwarts . . . .sorted Ravenclaw. Academically he is very skilled in theory and written work, however his magic is, I would say impaired. It’s believed that his magical core may have been damaged at a very young age. This may also have something to do with his smaller stature.. . . . . This has unfortunately caused a rift with his family, particularly his father. . . . . Parents divorced. Currently resides on the Isle of Man with his Mother and her current Husband. He did graduate Hogwarts with honours. He excels at organization. His magic, although diminished is adequate for most duties. . . . . I originally thought he might be good for Harry as more of an assistant. He’s very good with people and could run errands in and out of the magical world and particularly around the Grimmauld complex.”
No? I actually like both of us better now. Plus you’ve got this cute little patch of silver coming in just above your right temple. That’s very hot.
I would like that Brock breakfast set that we got from my parents and copies of some more photos? Nothing else I can think of.
“Yes. We’re just getting started. Do this. . . . .it’s a hover hold. . . .this is the goal for when you come in to land. Think about and look at your landing spot and command the broom. Tell it what you want it to do.”
It is at this time that the Fathers and guardians take seats together and are joined by their grandsons Jonathan and David Lupin-Potter. The young boys watch their fathers stand with Scorpius (Edward) and Albus (James) on a platform fashioned for the event (a Black family heirloom). Low to the ground, the platform shimmers like water and a reflection of stars throughout the ceremony. A nod to Andromeda, Narcissa, Draco and Scorpius’ heritage. The platform fills the atrium with a comforting light that extends to the ceiling glass for the duration of the ceremonies, darkening the afternoon sunlight and creating an intimate space of deep blue sky and starlight.
I’m sure. We don’t need place cards and escorts into the ballroom. We can still serve the food as planned but set it out in chafing dishes instead. And the error of not having any vegetarian options to choose from? That was my error. I’ll have that taken care of.
It might not even be that bad. Most likely all hand written texts and manuscripts. Could be pretty limited.
“Well that’s a pleasant change. Draco darling, I believe this would have been your great-grandfather’s potions lab. Probably your great-great-grandfather as well.”
“Do you want some avocado? . . . . . . I’ve been doing my homework. Did you know there’s a meditation we can do in advance to learn what our animagus form will be? Look on page twenty three. . . . . . .It involves potions, tell me if it looks difficult. . . . . . I still like it, but I'm kind of over this avocado on everything thing. . . . . .”
“No, I like the trip. It’s pretty and I like the boat ride. I’d miss that. Makes the wait to see them more special in a way?”
It’s difficult to explain. It works like a memory charm. Once completed the viewer believes it was always there.
“Okay today’s you’re lucky day. Look here. . . . . .place the cup under here and press that button. . . . .that’s the Draco button.”
“Just being honest. I’m going to need your help with mine too. . . . . look at this. . . . Merlin know’s I’m not this scrawny anymore. . . . . . . . .”
“Molly taught me a lot of this shite. Don’t give her corn kernels, I know it looks like it would be fine but they’re too fibrous and can get stuck in her throat and full of fructose.”
Mother isn’t really making this shite up, this is the kind of documentation used for “traditional” old blood/magical bonded marriages. She (and Molly and Ginny) are actually trolling the ministry and not just us. It’s kind of her big “Fuck You” for that clerk giving our boys the cold shoulder when they filed their original ministry paperwork. We can follow her lead. I’m getting a kick out of throwing this BS right back in their face and making sure it won’t happen again to other applicants.
“Yeah. I’m not so sure that’s going to help. Lucy says she thinks she’d like to stay at the school but now she’s worried about me being alone. I am a little too.”
“Draco put the photo’s and art you picked all through the house, but you can move it around or change it out however you like. Make it yours. This is just your starting point.”
Oh. Yes of course. I’m very happy to know that you enjoyed it. I’ve forwarded your owl note to my son. He was very excited.
It was just Dad and Luna out for a walk. I actually love it. And so typical of Dad. I mean really, trains and ice cream?
“Time for you to wake up. But also very, very early in the morning. Here are your glasses. . . . . .Eyes open, look around the room.”
“Yep! I had a lot of help. . . . oh, Dad. The mobile is so pretty and it sparkles and my comforter is warm and Darwin is really really happy and it’s all so pretty and it’s not really in a dungeon and wet and cold and there’s a fireplace in our room and desks and it’s so cool.”
Proxies. Since there was nobody claiming the Lordships, the Wizengamot appointed representatives to hold the seats in your stead.
“Hermione was even mad after that one. We got the high grade over her and Daphne. Snape even looked shocked!”
“If you need it for an emergency, yes. It should last you a very long time . . . . . Shall we head to your vault? I understand you have an item you’d like to put in storage?”
I would hope so but won’t know until we see it. Need to do that extra goblin ritual to open it and see. Are you up for it?
It has been my pleasure to serve the Wizarding Community and I am looking forward to reading The Daily Prophet as a consumer for many years to come.
“First, right up front it’s like a large box. Not a literal box. But it’s where you keep the important recent things. Continue?”
With the history of the shop it is reported that a professional curse breaker (full disclosure it was my Brother Bill) was employed in the early hours to sweep the building and provide a report. All and any remnants of unwelcome magic was summarily removed from the site.
“Professor Kreacher. It’s my honour to inform you that Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter, Lord of Prince along with his Heir and Family have chosen you to receive the Malfoy Lordship! Do you accept!”
I'm changing the subject now, because not one person is going to back out of the wedding. No matter how stupid they dress us, we're going to be there. SO. Who’s up for pizza?
Ha. Okay, throw those questions at me. We’ll see where this goes. Or how about I turn around and interview you? I have LOTS of questions that need to be answered.
“I love it, Harry! I’m just a little stunned. I was expecting an explosion of colours and high topped trainers? Not this!”
The Legislation before you is entitled: “The Abolishment and Repeal of Discriminatory Laws Imposed upon Minorities” It is a blanket repeal of all restrictions on Elf, Goblin, Werewolf, and Magical/Humanoid creatures, It also repeals any and all restrictions based on Gender.
“That’s impossible. Goblins are not allowed to hold a Lordship, nor are they allowed to sit on the Wizengamot. Harry, you know this very well.”
Me, your Mum, Jerry, Molly, My Mother, Andi, Arthur, Hugo, Grayson, Rose, Lily, Eric, Ted, Jamie, Jon, Davey, Louis, Gareth, Danika, Hermione, Ron, Fleur, Bill, Trandy, Decram. Victoire and the other one just arrived.
that’s the bank. . . . . . .Daily Prophet . . . . . . Draco and I own that . . . . . . That is Malkin’s . . . . .we’ll go there too, you don’t have to have robes anymore except the first day of school and special occasions, but they can be fun for some things
He doesn’t want one. He loves his bluebell wand and we’ve been letting him practice with it. We might want to take him to Ollivander and have it looked at for compatibility. He loves his bluebell.
Then I’ll come and see it Tuesday night! We can all go out for dinner at the leaky after? Fetch Iris?
What? Do we need a permit or something to put out some tables? Reba has three reliable sous chefs today and they’re basically just making sandwiches and soups.
“Miss Groy’s parents are Elf and Goblin. They live in magical Colchester. Very tight-knit family. Does not need housing.”
“Of course. Are we done here? I need to help get Lucy’s things together for school tomorrow. It’s a long trip.”
The only request we had was to leave the nursery alone and replace that fucking kitchen faucet and fix that upstairs shower.
That’s weeks away. I’ll do some research and find you the perfect outfit. Weather appropriate. Is it an indoor venue or outside festival thing?
“I’ve got an addition I want you to see before we open it. It think you’ll like it, but if you don’t I’ll have it removed before we open things up.”
“So? Harry certainly won’t care about that. And it would be much worse if you didn’t tell the guy up front. You’d just carry it and be miserable. Trust me. That would be much worse.”
Yes. You do need to tell Draco and Harry about this though. I wasn’t pleased with either of their reactions. I thought they were in on it? And I couldn’t say anything to them because all of the kids were there.
13. She doesn’t really need watching but Seamus is overprotective. Jamie tackled one of the guest rooms that never gets used, and voila Iris has a ladybug guest room.
“The pretty part? . . . . . I’ll take it as a super compliment because my hair is looking particularly nice today, but did you see my fiancé? He’s freaking gorgeous.”
Well they’re going to need all of that. It looks like they’ve outgrown most everything they’ve got and it’s not a lot to begin with. Transfiguration only goes so far and I’m not good at clothes charms.
“We were so worried it was going to be a fiasco. Dreading it actually. . . .And we were prepared for it and willing to go through with it for you and gran. But this is . . . .”
Mr. Malfoy-Potter. This is WM Staunton of St. Mungo’s. I’m contacting you on behalf of your husband. Please retrieve him in room 6 on the seventh floor before 14:00.
LOL well, humour him. He’s going to be a regular fixture at Grimmauld. Teddy’s making paintings for him.
“I have a better idea. . . . I’m fed up with Teddy underestimating his talents. . . . For now let me photograph them. . . . Can you ask Grayson to bring the car out?”
“Gloria, I’m talking as the Minister now. . . .first and foremost this means that man will never see the light of day again. He lived a long time on the run without paying for what he did. He will fester and rot in jail eating cold porridge for the rest of his natural life. And trust me when I say they will keep him well fed with that porridge and monitored so he will live out a very long sentence.”
They aren’t really rare or expensive I swear. They’re just really pretty. And he’s bringing the special food and live bugs for the frogs.
I don’t know about you guys, but the whole first bit, the colour was all fucked up. It fixed itself after the totally fake tornado thing.
“This is like ten christmases at once. Fucking matching ladybug PJ’s. Even custom bracelets from Mrs. Brick.”
I did kind of think that this is where the situation was headed. We will do what we can to keep it as quiet as possible.
Very good. I’ll also arrange for licensing with Muggle registrar for all of the vehicles. They will be ready for use if you choose.
Oh of course, it’s going to nice. I can’t talk about any of the details though. But you’ll know soon enough. You’re still going to write about it right? We loved how you covered the luncheon. But yes. We’re all very excited about the wedding.
“Of course I’m not mad about that. I can share my butterbean. He’s a good man and I love that you’re with him.”
I’ll try. Merlin I’ve got to find something to wear. My clothes keep mysteriously SHRINKING! This pregnancy is not what I was expecting.
“It took some convincing for him to agree but yes, I was very inspired by our delivery and thought it would be different from the dismal french cuisine class I looked into. I got his information from the telephone list in the downstairs kitchen.”
“You know that? I did make it. Just this morning. Oh Merlin it also has pine nuts. You’re not allergic are you?”
“The family also all know this technique. And it really doesn’t happen all that often anymore. We’ll meet frequently to go over things as they come up. I will give you floo call access to my cottage. And you also have that beautiful owl. You can send me a note if you need to.
“So far the only part I like here is the lawn and the fountain. At least the grass is green. I think if we added some huge torches up the drive it would be fitting.”
I’m going through my stuff from the cottage on Friday, I don’t think that’s going to take long. Dad put it in storage. Rosie, you could come with me and we can visit while I do that? My stuff is at freaking Gringotts. Eric is coming too. We’re going to head back late Saturday. We need to be back at the sanctuary on Sunday. 4 days without 2 people is going to put a strain on things. We’re going to owe our co-workers big time.
That would be great. Both! Maybe we can install a TV in one of the lounges so we can watch movies or something?
“I’ll have the background checks sent to the Minister. She must approve and then present it to the Wizengamot.”
“He’ll be busy in the morning with Seamus. Floo over with the stuff. Just keep these pocket doors closed in case he comes through.”
Knockturn pub crawl, I thought you could use your patronus to send the invites? If it’s too much it’s okay. Maybe I can borrow Mr. Jordan?
This couldn’t have been a more perfect stag-do. Thank you so much for it. Jamie really went all out to make this special. We had the best time.
You don’t have to get me anything. I’ve got rings. Or how about something from the vaults? Would you rather have that? I could do that if they’re too simple?
“Not even a little. Davey will want to shower and go to bed right after the salad though. I’ll get his night clothes and a story ready.”
OH. That’s very nice. Depending on what we find, you might consider adding a Wizarding chess display to your “Junk Shop” exhibition sometime.
Okay, So Hugo. I recently accepted some Potter family inheritances. I wasn’t aware that it was as complicated as it turned out to be. It includes multiple Lordships and properties. It also includes a majority of the seats on the Wizengamot. Does that make sense?
“I haven’t forgotten. . . . . We’re waiting for winter when it’s snowy and crisp. I can’t wait to see it all frozen in the winter.”
As adjunct we would like you to join Al and Nev at the main table, but we know you prefer to stay out and think it’s a distraction. Just know the option is available to you.
Excitement is brewing in Knockturn with several new businesses primed to open their doors in the coming months.”
I might have spilled that I wanted to ask you to marry me and she said she wouldn’t publish the interview unless I approved it? And it went way off the rails and I might have rambled off about things like favorite ice cream flavors or something?
. . . . we’re going to go shopping tomorrow for your real present, but I had this brought over. . . . .”
“Uncle Harry a little warning would have been nice! Now I have to meet his mum, he’s crying and I’m covered in chocolate!”
“A lot, We’re supposed to preview the Snape exhibit. Louis has it all set up on the second floor. I think that’s Thursday.”
Scorpius-soon-to-be-Malfoy-Potter don’t you even JOKE about it! You are not leaving your pregnant fiancé for a younger man!
“The connection. I think my dad was my bearer, but there’s no confirmation on paper. Pomfrey never said anything about my dad, but I think that’s how she knew about me and did her tests. Maybe it was a confidentiality issue. We won’t ever know unless Minnie spills, and that’s unlikely. I'll still write her a note and ask.”
Just stand there between the two units and say “Harry Potter lives and Number Twelve Grimmauld Place”.
When they return to their rooms after the breakfast the wedding outfits will be laid out on the beds. And then we’re off to the races. Two hours to the wedding.
After a very long day the mission was complete. A completely transformed building had emerged from the rubble that was once not only an eyesore, but a historical stain on the neighbourhood. Everyone involved was very impressed with the results.
Tell Decram that I’ll ask him to address the family and then he can tell them to read the family “newsletter” and that they’ve been “jested”?
So now you remember that you’re Hugo’s date. When we do things like family functions you’re not my assistant. Separate the two. The only obligation you have is to enjoy yourself and hang out okay?
“I see. Well, before we go for ice cream young man I’m going to fix this little problem you have with these trousers. Stand up straight. “•” That’s better. Now do you want a pink shirt too?”
Merlin. I think I could actually do that. You know he had a wicked dry sense of humour? We could show that part of him too. Even better, ask Draco to do it with me. That would be hilarious. He’ll go all “shut up you dunderhead” on me and fawn all over Draco.
Gareth was Lucy’s teacher all summer and Luna runs the school. Danika and Phil want to play some music in the ballroom AND they’ve got the remixes of Eric’s music they want to hear on the big speakers.
So my new job is really great. I haven’t really had much to do with the actual job yet, but once things get more organized I think I’ll be really busy.
“Okay . . . . . Down there on the very end is Ollivanders you’ll get your wand from there . . . . . next to that is the Cardamom Cafe . . . . . . .That's where we’re having dinner . . . . . Don’t mind me go look around!!!”
“I’m not moving in yet! Just some basics like coffee, tea and biscuits. Not too much food but enough to make a quick lunch while it’s being worked on?”
“Mac. Okay, Phone and computer. We’ll upgrade the crap keyboard it comes with, piece of junk doesn’t even have a ten-key! Printer too?”
They’re coming all the way from Japan! I had to use the Muggle credit card. The one without a limit. That INCLUDES the transport. AND Mr. Maeda is going to personally place them in the ponds. He’s even throwing in some FROGS! They’ll be here on Thursday. It’s the last thing to finish in the conservatory and then it will be ready for Saturday.
They might enjoy the club on mens night. We invested in Knockturn to reinvigorate the area. As you can see, the strategy seems to be working. Your GIRLFRIEND says SHE enjoys the burlesque club. Particularly some act that involves a unicorn horn.
Yeah, Uncle Harry opened up both of the empty ones on either side for the new staff to live in? I think it’s optional. So Grayson is MY new neighbour. Right around the block! I can see his place from here. Right across the park!
I actually understood that. Coming from Harry’s experience as a child, hot water is a luxury. And growing up my Mum limited our use of water like that. In her case I it was more a time management issue with all of us kids and only two freaking bathrooms.
“There. Now they just slide and nest on either side. Poor thing needs a coat of paint. We could have Seamus replace these doors to match the new courtyard enclosure across the street.”
Scarhead, as much as you’d like it I’m not going to disrobe in my office. In any event, you’re not here to make the effort worthwhile.
“Of course I’m coming, but I’m not a neanderthal. I’d like to hang up my clothes and put these things in the kitchen first. You’re already wearing your shower attire. . . . oh, there’s a hook for your bathrobe out there now.”
This is the first half of the "short chapter" that I was going to post tomorrow. It went on far too long so I've split it in two.
“This round table is nice? It's a little heavy looking but, I can imagine some large flowers in that vase.”
“All of that equipment is stored under the island. Grayson has a list for you with the incantations, but we really think what you’ll end up doing is thinking “I want my mixer” when you touch it and it will work.”
It’s called 3-D printing. I generate the sculpture on my computer and it’s printed out using filament. Kind of like string on a spool but plastic heated up by a machine. That piece is in 8 separate pieces then fixed together like a puzzle. The format is still pretty small, at least with my equipment. I can send you a video link of how it’s done?
It’s better. We can have the wings attached once it’s in place. Also have you seen this place at night?
I’ve got a project to go over with you, Snape will be here too. In my library. It's easier to explain once you’re here?
“If we go to the cliffs we could pop over to Overview Point and try to find Creamsicle again. We know she’s there the place has been cleaned up more.”
“You’ve got to give it up. I’ve been through years of therapy over that and other things. It’s okay to not get over some things. . . . I’ll never forgive your parents for what they did . . . . . your Mother gets a small amount of sympathy from me because I think she was misguided and manipulated, but YOU? You didn’t know any better. You were a kid who was taught that shite. You aren’t that kid. Look at Lucy. She’s that wonderful little girl because of you. Let it go.”
“Their Mother was originally from Mauritius. . . island off east Africa. We’re not sure why she came here, there’s no record of any family either here or there. It’s been thought that maybe her magical abilities were exposed and she fled but that’s just speculation. . . .Their Father was a potions researcher originally from Pakistan. This is what I was trying to get across. . . .they have one living biological relative who lives in a small village. . . . .It says Dera Bugti . . . .He wanted nothing to do with magic and he wants nothing to do with his son’s “tainted” children. The parent’s will was very explicit in denouncing him. Very adamant about it in fact. So we’ve had him legally severed. He was happy to do it. Identifying information is not in this file and remains sealed with the Ministry until both boys are of age. . . Here’s a photograph of the boys.”
“If you’re into the vegetarian diet she and her sister will definitely help out. They’re complete professionals when it comes to that.”
UGH. Alright let’s get your message board up. I’ll show you how to do it later. I’ll leave it open. You just leave the first message. The invite and notice will come from me.
Yes, Zebb and her sister Astra were with Augusta before she passed away. Okay I’ll let you go and wait for your invite later?
Yes. That’s what I just said. I believe it’s time to retire the Malfoy name from the estate. I will also let fall Malfoy from my name and just be Black if you think that would be appropriate.
I’m scheduled with Luna for the interview. Two weeks I think. Al and Scorp have already done theirs. OH I loved Draco’s last opinion post. It was very Draco.
“In a certain way, yes. A Family vow, by choice to be clear. We’ll continue this conversation on another day. Today you have school shopping to do.”
SM: My Mum gave me a bag of candies, and then Al came in clinging to his dad. My Mom said chocolate helps everything . . .so I found the best one and brought it to him.
I forgot about that. The symphony. That was awesome. What do you like about him? I mean come on Rosie, you never date.
“OH! You’re early. I wasn’t expecting you for at least another half hour. It's nice to finally meet you too!”
“They’ve done this before, We’re not the only ones. It’s unusual, but they know what they’re doing.”
You may find that Mr. Kreacher and Ms. Ruby may be amenable to a solution to the restrictions, but Mr. Kreacher would loathe the idea of giving up his positions. Ms Ruby is also very committed to Elfin issues/finances.
We’re going to set him up on the wall opposite the dining table and room entrance between two of the large windows. The manor has barware. It looks extremely delicate but is surprisingly sturdy. Not cherubs: clam shell themed.
You know I’m not going to take no for an answer don’t you? I WILL break you Nev! You are taking your beautiful wife on a vacation to Peru. REPEAT AFTER ME: I am taking my beautiful wife on a three week vacation to Peru. . . .
“Draco. Can we go to the place in France that you like so much? I think we need some of that food you like. And then we should eat some of it. . . . .maybe we should go over the plans for that discotheque again, I think it’s too flashy and outdated.”
“But it’s Virgilio duck! Zebb has already agreed to stay on at the cottage I’m sure she would be thrilled with the assistance, but, when it comes to any additional staff she’s definitely in charge. Trust me, she will hold no prisoners. Oh my god that duck is awesome."
I’m allowed to paint for my family without consulting you. It’s in our contract. Anything to do with my family is off limits.
Have the meeting be a dinner? I’m sure there’s a dining space. By that point everyone will be hungry for some actual food.
“Yes and actually that cooling cabinet or refrigerator as you call it is a maker called Sub-Zero. The Ovens and cooktops are Wolf. Those are the same vendors I chose from America for the cottage. The style hasn’t changed much.”
“If you don’t get it on the first try it’s fine. You did it right once already. . . . . . think of the hat!”
Ginny wrote a special report for Witch Weekly. And there was a photo spread of our activities at Borgin. They’re all very curious. Prophet also got the public records on the marriage. We need to op-ed that.
Because you’ll be showing 7 at your gallery opening in addition to the new mural. The other 7 are to be shown at the Muggle Braxton gallery. They’ve committed to a three month showing beginning in four weeks. 4 have sold sight unseen based on the photos provided of your new work. The other 3 are under contracts. This means the exhibit is sold out before it’s been shown. I’ve negotiated the contract and pricing/fees based on your new negotiated rate. The Braxton is very excited to have been chosen to show these new works. They are not interested in taking a commission. The increased foot traffic is enough compensation. Mr. Malfoy has allowed me to copy the book of his extensive collection. Did you know that your works are prominent in a collection of some of the finest works of modern art in Europe?
If people see us going out to dinner with Jay and Gruella as family and friends it’s a big deal okay? I’ll admit I know that.
“Fully clothed? I didn’t say to drown her in your trout pond just rinse out her nose and make sure her eyes weren’t full of gumbo powder.”
Let’s move back to the kitchen, I’m thinking about bringing in these muggle appliances from America do you like this stainless metal? How about one of the micro wavy things would you like that? What do you want for cookware I was looking at this set? Okay so now out on the back patio I thought woven rattan would be nice for the kids, with these yellow cushions.
I haven’t settled on anything. I’m at the point where I don’t really need to do one. School is over in a little less than a month. I’ve already passed everything except the MLAA and I take that MLAA test in two weeks. Why?
Are you sure having “Harry Potter” and Al slinging hash at Reba’s is a good idea? That’s an open kitchen!
“You taught all of your children to ride a broom here on the front field of this cottage. It’s nice to see you continue the tradition. Harry Malfoy-Potter, this one has what you call the gift. Be careful with it.”
“I’m thinking two shades of topaz. Bright yellow for his eyes. The activation buttons will be on the back.”
Yes of course it is! It’s going to be hard work! Hugo will basically be our legislation writer and at times he will write contracts for me and the charitable foundations I want set up. It’s a full time position and he’ll eventually need assistants. He’ll start slow and work up to it. I’ll set him up with an office at the Centre with floo access and everything! Once we’ve decided on a location for the main umbrella foundation we’ll move operations there.
Can you keep Snabb over night and send him back in the morning? It really is a bit much for him to make the round trip in one go. Give him a rest!
“No. Hugo won’t be here for breakfast. At least not now. We don’t know each other that well yet. But breakfast? I’d like that a lot. I can help too and we’ll clean up before going on with our day?”
I want you to come with us to the townhouse tomorrow, show it to Dud and give him the financial information. I don’t want to be involved. Dud is a proud man and he won’t want me involved.
I’m looking at the photo’s now. I’ll bet there are a lot of Wizards and a few Witches hoping to catch a glimpse of Grayson with Hugo in his jumpsuit and hard hat.
“You’re not at school. Besides these are the edited song versions. No bad words just awkward pauses. It's their problem if they don’t like it, not ours.”
“Well, I can use my portkey to get us to the roof garden and go in for their school things, or we can go directly to Jamie and Teddy’s.”
We’ll do it in the front field at Al and Scorp’s place. Family tradition. First broom lesson at the cottage. Be here in 20 minutes. I’ll bring my camera.
Harry wore black muggle suit with gold piping, black shirt (not vested) and a green ascot. A peony blossom attached to his lapel (courtesy of the flower arrangements) set off the bespoke outfit.
Nothing’s off limits. My treat and a huge thanks for all the help. Narcissa and Mr. Liogell have arranged staff to deliver wherever you are. Same as yesterday, Includes all merchant employees. Please have one person per merchant coordinate and one of the four will be by to pick up the orders! ENJOY! THANK YOU AGAIN! I LOVE YOU!
Yes. She’s taking a position at Hogwarts and want’s to live in London. She’s best friends with my niece Rose who lives in number 65? with Hugo. Thought we’d try to see what’s available. Wouldn’t be moving for another month or so.
“It’s a nice day. We’re not hiding from the public or photographers. . . . I have magic to protect myself from the sun. We can sit outside.”
After lunch it was back to work. With Hugo Granger-Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy-Potter once again securing the area and assisting with the direction of activities in jaunty outfits.
Jay will be tasked with presenting paperwork. You will each be asked in turn to accept your seats and if you do so willingly. Harry will formally welcome you to the Wizengamot. It will go in this order:
It might be useful for your purposes to use one of our larger ritual spaces as a place to choose vault items. I could have it set up for you as needed. We could link the room to your vaults and transport items for viewing and selection there. A full category like chess sets could be seen all in the same place at one viewing, catalogued then returned to their proper vaults.
“I can install shelves, yes. They’ll be glass floating shelves? Nothing too heavy. These armoires then are reconfigured for your modeling materials. The fake grass, trees, gravel and things. Paints and brushes. Drawers and shelves all labeled and ready for you. Al want’s to do that.”
Yes. And since you’ve been not giving a fuck what they think in the press it’s been a lot better. And Draco too. . . . . things are changing.”
I did. I told him it was Opposite Day and he agreed to it. He was half asleep when he agreed, but a deal is a deal!
Exclusive to the boutique are some very unusual and beautiful scent diffusers. Ms. Black explains that they are faithful reproductions of diffusers from Decram Rakesh Potter from the 17th century. Very intriguing and surprisingly not overpriced. Produced in France by Françoise Studio, the diffusers are faithful to the originals, but using materials that make them accessible to the average consumer. A perfect gift. Other accessories include hand printed and painted silk scarves and hair accessories. Most notable, a series of simple pearl hair clips that are appropriate for anyone. All accessories were personally selected by Louis Delacour-Weasley.
With Zebb. I’ll bring everything you need, but she’s going to lecture you on feeding. You need to know how to change a nappy.
BOTH. YES. Please don’t say anything about that rant to Draco? At least not the marry me part? UGH. Sorry, I’m breathing again.
“I heard the bones breaking. It was really a bad thing. I’m sure there are several toes missing at least. Did you look? How hideous is it?”
I’d like to but I just don’t think I’ve got the energy to do it. We’ll have you all over in smaller groups?
The are not for hire, but an appropriate donation to the society for an event like this would be in the range of 300 galleons.
“Yes! Then I can look things up. I’ll ask Draco to take a look through the list for potion ingredients! Do you think there’s room for them in here?”
Alright. Get back to me when you’re available. The funds have already been secured and deposited to your personal account. Minus my tidy 5% fee of course.
They’re already stunned but okay lay it on as thick as you want. You know these poor people are very confused? Draco’s Mother looks particularly bewildered.
“Crazy Mouse. I can’t go unless you take me. You’ve got to be THIS tall, and I’m only THIS tall. I can’t go without YOU. You have to take me! PLEASE.”
“Well since we now know that a lot of this can be managed through the Goblins it takes a lot of the pressure off. If you want, I can deal with the lawyers on that part. All you’ll need to do is go to Liogell with Mr. Stark and set up the document transfer.”
“I’m sure you can consolidate and make a whole section for yours. And look Potter, not a single portrait in either of these rooms.”
My Dad can arrange travel. Both ways. You know that. Have you ever taken his first class Portkey? Soo cool.
“Jerry did it. That’s one of his sculptures. Part of your Mum and Jerry’s wedding gift. Jerry’s cleaned up the whole property.”
this one is more like a Wizards tech centre where you can bring in your phone or computer and have all those upgrades and spells done in one place without having to bring in an expert . . . . . . . ”
“But your dreams are interesting. The meadow was nice and that time when you were making potions with the ancient guy. That was cool . . . . we even stayed a while so you could finish the potion.”
Just. I’m going to fill him in on things tomorrow. I gave him a little teaser about what’s been going on and he’s a little stunned. LOL!
Hello and good morning! We’ve set up this message board for the family dinner on Saturday. Just tell us what you’d like to bring or make and we can coordinate. Remember there are plenty of stoves and ovens. So let us know.
“Papa Teddy’s good with the sandwich. . . .if it’s something to stove cook it cooks and cooks and cooks.”
“I just don’t know what to say? She’s definitely not fussy. . . .I’m not going to complain. Poppy says she’s perfectly fine and it’s more normal for a magical birth. I expected a lot more screaming baby and she's certainly got the lungs for it. . . . Jon says she’s just happy to be here so I’ll take it.”
You have no technical obligation to hold the 38 seats inherited in the Wizengamot.

Suprisingly I’m not. I’ve got Zebb helping. She’s got most of my office packed up and ready to go. I’m pretty much down to just the personal stuff I want to keep.
“When you take my hand and we go off to wherever . . . . . next time don’t take my hand. Consider it a test.”
So now the hard part is keeping this from Mum. She knows something’s going on that we’re not telling her!
We’ve contacted Madam Malkin’s and will provide new and refreshed staff uniforms. 4 of each for all staff plus a new casual and sturdy uniform designed for gardening. 12 additional sets for the crew.
“Oh, wait. I’m sorry, there is one other thing that you need to know and I have something for you to take with you. Staff have a magical agreement. You do not have this requirement. I see you developing friendships. . . . particularly with Hugo. It wouldn’t be fair to you to be asked to be under a magical restriction and not be able to speak freely. . . . . You know how to be discreet. I’ve already discussed this situation with both Harry and Draco. Do you understand what I mean?”
“The Paris apothecary is producing all they can and shipping everything available. Wales has hired additional staff in production but the space is limited there.”
You didn’t get the stupid disco duck thing. And Hugo refuses to change it until I’ve learned my lesson or something.
Mrs. Granger took us to tour the summer school. She was GREAT. Thanks for getting her to come talk with me. How do you know the guy Gareth?
“Mr. and Mrs. Brick are experienced in running a very large household. They will be the supervisors for the manor.
“That turned into a mess because it was the dammed most powerful wand ever. Then Harry’s all mad and uses his fucking expelliarmus on me and just fucking took BOTH OF THEM . . . . .”
Mister Lin and Mister Thom just showed up. I guess we’re learning the lodge traditions? One of them is a nightly campfire! Miss Parks is helping put it together. This is pretty amazing. She says she’s going to cook something for us on the fire. Also. There’s so much food here that we all might come back looking like those woodland trolls they keep talking about.
“The potion effects will gradually wear off over the next couple of hours. Are you sure you want to take him home like this?”
“Scorp will be here tomorrow working in the lab. We can get Al over here and say we’re taking them “somewhere”. Bring them to the cottage and let them see it. Then we can just ask them if they’re ready to move?”
it was safe do you think for a SECOND I’d give one to Harry? I’ve been working on this thing for over 10 years! It’s safer than apparition!
I’m going to introduce legislation. The following is what Harry decided on for the first session (with my additional notes):
“Those rooms will be ready next week. Draco and I are moving to that level with Trandy while they do the construction on our wing upstairs. OH! We need another painting! Something for the smoking room so Decram can watch game shows with Trandy!”
So we could just look at them all at once and choose which to show? Or Louis could ask for a list in advance and you could bring together what he chooses from a list?
Heraald James Potter, Lord of Potter, Peverell, Black, Prince and Stinchcoumbe GET YOUR ARSE INTO THIS CHAT!!!!!
“Yes and no. It’s still a big soft feather bed, but I’ve replaced it with a new one. Never again will I willingly get into a bed that was once occupied by my Mother.”
“You have technically started your job but it’s going to take a while before you’ll really need to do too much unless Harry asks. Once they move here that will be different. I want you to take this time to just get familiar with how Harry ticks. . . . He can be a handful. . . . I’ve heard you’ve been getting to know Hugo and the other kids. This is excellent.”
Grimmauld will still be my home. Thanks for coming on the beginning of that journey with me today. The remodel is going to be a bit daunting as you can probably tell from the condition of the place. So in my other news I’m staying with Draco for the interim. Yes, in his penthouse. I know. He has been a gracious host.
2. The details of the forthcoming marriage between my Son and Albus Potter are indeed being covered exclusively by (
“No, I want it to be more natural. When you stand in the center it should be like a kaleidoscope of colours. Mostly flowers and grasses.”
“At least we’ve got the basics and the structure finished. We've been adding things now. Took forever to pick furniture. . .still want some better pieces for the living room and need some rugs in the bedrooms. Not worrying about that too much.”
I have things under control, it’s just a lot and my biggest problem right now is with getting the owls out.
Draco and I will stay in the master. Please prepare a suite for Jamie and Teddy and ask Miss Cam to meet with them about food and drinks in preparation for the party?
Yes, I agree. So we’ll touch base again in a few days. I’ll be seeing you this coming Thursday as well.
“Other than that. . . .oh Hi, this is my nephew Hugo. I’m going to meet with him and Grayson for a few minutes and after that I’d like to take a few minutes with Cibly to show her the conservatory. Zebb and Mr. Trandy are going to give everyone a tour of the house? Also eat some more of this food! Take some home with you tonight please. We don’t like wasting food. Is that enough Zebb?”
Potter Pakistan Estate - Held by Gringotts India/Pakistan Subsidiary - claimed/unused/no activity (1 property held in architectural stasis and fidelius). It is noted that this structure was constructed in 1650 and put into stasis in 1883.
“That’s one way to put it. These dishes . . .Frankoma. . . . Again from the Americas probably 1940’s . . . Red clay from Oklahoma, I think they called this glaze “prairie green”. Your Grandmother was a collector. . . . Look at all the serving pieces. . . . This set is called Poppytrail, Aztec I think. Beautiful and again look at those serving pieces. . . . These counters are soapstone. . . . This all would have been considered fairly casual. . . probably distasteful to the purebloods.”
I know Draco’s head has been spinning already! We need to ask them if they want to keep muggle appliances or go with magical.
I’m going back over tomorrow to get his computer configured. Show him how to work the TV and stuff. If you PROMISE to be nice I might invite him into a chat tomorrow night. But you have to PROMISE to be good.
“Alright I’ve taken quite a bit of your time. You understand the basics of these portkeys and it’s safety. There are written instructions. I’m asking Grayson to teach you his jewelry charm if you don’t already know it. He also knows how to program them. Yes?”
The only thing unusual about this report is that you can’t even pretend your daughter spent more than 10 minutes “writing” this tripe. Who names their child “KEETA” anyway? Is she an unregistered leaf beetle? Idiot.
“There’s a huge lorry out front. And Grayson looks like he’s arguing with someone? I can’t really tell from up here.”
Possibly. Do what you want with the empty units. I think it’s best to ask Zebb and Trandy what they think? At least Zebb isn’t going to hold anything back from you.
“One last text Potter, before I take away your phone. . . . tell Hugo that Mondays are now optional and he MUST take today off to spend with his fiancé.”
“When Poppy gives the word we’ll be there. But just Draco, your mum, Jerry and me at first. I promised the others can come later when you’re ready, but you’ll want some time after.”
People don’t see past his appearance usually and don’t take him seriously. He’s seemed pretty unfocused since graduating.
“Thanks. I’m just glad you thought of it. I put a lounge chair and little coffee table in Trandy’s room in front of the fireplace, and a couple chairs by the balcony. He thinks the room is too big. . . . . . ”
Actual birthday was back on Sunday. She did something with her Mother. But we’re having a small party at the flat on Friday. Have you got a minute?
It can just be exchanged for a UK license. There’s a £43 fee and a form to fill out for the DVLA. Usually takes around 3 weeks but I can have it expedited over night. Have Mr. Elliot come to my office today to sign the form. I’ll need to copy his current license.
Mister Magnús and Miss Jenny have agreed to ring to lodge bells to announce the northern lights. Most likely around midnight.
“Yes. Most unworthy. The Lordship was rightfully passed to Sirius after Reggie and although you burned your precious fucking tapestry it didn’t mean shite. Same as my Aunt Andromeda here. You see the true heir chooses the successor and in this case that would be Sirius who rightfully chose his Godson Harry Potter to succeed him.
Hermione charmed my computer! (She’s even named it Mack and there’s a cord attached to a thing . . .Arthur could explain it) Muggle printer. Goes directly onto the parchment. It’s pretty cool don’t you think? I’m sure she would be happy to charm yours, but please don’t. You were correct, I really do love your elegant handwriting.
Edit: I was making a throwback joke in the beginning of the chapter that I didn't even understand after re-reading, so I changed it.
You need a code for the card. Muggle one is black. For that one you just insert it in the machine and key in the code. Magic one is blue that one you just give to the merchant. Is your pass expiring?
My husband is in surgery tomorrow morning, so this is what I was going to post on Wednesday. Enjoy the early bonus? I'll try to post as usual on the weekend.
“Well, so far according to this there’s a dining hall on the top level. . . . Three kitchens one smaller one down here. . . . Probably that large opening on the left. . . . As you can see there’s a more intimate dining area over there. A private master suite up those stairs on the far right of the fireplace. The center staircase leads up to the guest rooms and 3 “lounges” and continue up to the dining hall and balconies. I guess we’ll just have to wander around.
The reasoning behind not teaching Muggle students about magical traditions was that Muggles would violate the statute of secrecy and somehow weaken established traditions.
“Hermione sent it to me from Australia. It’s a boomerang. If you learn how to throw it right it goes up into the air and comes back to you. Muggle thing. . . I could never get it to work so I would throw it into the back garden and just accio it. I’ll have to show this to Lils.”
I didn’t mean it was a problem it’s just that I didn’t know? It’s a big relief to tell you the truth! I’m stressing out over taking care of the baby and keeping that huge house up. I’m going to need to budget this in.
“Not like THAT! Phhhhht! I’d go to see the jewelry though. There really are some beautiful things. Mr. Liogell has all of the details. Make it free and accept donations to charities maybe? A different charity every month. Different things every month. Not a big thing, just something small. Later if you want something bigger you could do that. I mean it’s YOUR stuff. People will definitely go to see it. Those pirate bowls are cool! Medieval torches! Show them some of your trains while you’re at it.”
“I couldn’t find a case for either of them. I’ve kept them together in this one. . . . . that was mine originally.”
Can’t you use the same type of ritual on it that you did on Grimmauld? One that just got rid of all the dark stuff? Or anything related to Walburga?
I have to warn you though. It’s Diagon so someone might photograph us. It might end up in the paper.
You’re right about that, but I had no idea I’d have to go back in time to do it! I just wanted kids to hold on to some tradition.
That press announcement happened. Every single Wizarding hotel in a 100 kilometer radius is booked solid from Friday night through at least the end of next week. Record bookings.
You entrusted me with your most precious children at a time when my approach to education was being hammered in the press. You stood by my side when I insisted that a rounded education before sending our children to a magical boarding school should include the integration of Muggle techniques and technologies as well as an introduction to magical methods.
Interesting. I’ll bet she built it. Or had it built I mean. It was very fashionable to build a woodland retreat back in the day. It’s intriguing. Okay, yes let’s pop up there.
It’s not going to be that simple. They’re entitled to personal belongings and must be served with termination papers.
“Yes. I found out by mistake that it does. . .Well the rest of the kitchen still isn’t much to look at. Last priority really. Jerry’s the one who cooks mostly and he doesn’t care about it as long as the stove and oven works, but it’s a mess.”
HOW does a metal hollow shell walk around without a heart? Oh Boo Hoo. . . . Never saw a charmed suit of armour before? That’s just fucking shite. PLUS, that whole oil thing . . . . . Rust just doesn’t come on and bind things that quickly. Just ludicrous.
“I think we’ll have to try that one out. I think that’s my new favourite. Looks like we could have tea in it!”
I’m taking my BOYFRIEND (!) to Daisy’s in Diagon. We’re meeting at the entrance at 16:00. Care to join us?
Good evening. Alicia, perhaps I can assist in answering your questions on the final Referendum. You see, I have for many, many years attempted to work with the Wizengamot to accomplish the most basic of reforms, to no avail. As you very well know, the Referendum provides for just the opportunity for myself and Mr. Lovegood-Longbottom to evaluate our programs. No evaluation has been allowed under previous Wizengamot authority and certainly no budget to instigate any reforms or upgrading of systems to reflect current trends and technology. Hogwarts relies on charity for most everything related to technology.
Another term for sterile! Admittedly it is a bit sterile, but that’s intentional. The two upper levels are kind of another box within this box with more glass around the outer shell to preserve the view. Up those stairs to the second level above are bedrooms, bathrooms, and a den I put in for Scorp. Above that are my offices and laboratory. The lab has the best views of all because it sits on top like a hat. Then the roof garden is pretty simple and sits above the lab. That view is particularly stunning in the evenings.
“I can walk that. That’s just a little longer than the walk from the cottage to Zebb’s. I know you’re worried, but I’m not an invalid. I’m just big as a house and can’t see my feet.”
Yes. If you and Harry decide to hyphenate your names the same as Scorpius and Albus I will have the name changed to Wiltshire Manor.
Because NOW I really just want to move my office, family photos and collections into storage and be done with it. I can move my important paperwork to the Harpies centre and temporarily work from there if needed. Give Jamie the kitchen set he asked about. Send you the Brock breakfast dishes. You should come over here and take a look to see if there’s anything you missed.
Too soon for that. No fever. Not hungry. Maybe a little overtired from keeping herself awake. That’s why I think it's a growth spurt.
“At least now they know for sure that we’re not going to just let them bat eyelashes and get our surprise out of us.”
I would say a good three quarters of the decisions are sealed, but the ones they allow into the public record are ones they want people to see.
“Just call them to the patios. Call up there and say something like “all staff please come down here now”? At least try it. You are going to have to create the protocol here. Might as well start now.”
“Ginny loves it. With her schedule this place is really a nice peaceful place to land after a long day. At least now that we’ve gotten this far she can relax a bit more. It was crazy there for a while.”
LOL. I think once school is in session it might be easier for Dud to get out. Juggling the single father thing isn’t easy.
She’ll do it. She already kind of knows about it for some reason. Something to do with work permits and sponsorship deals.
Mostly just on Saturday. Hugo was already way ahead of us. Draco took care of all of the logistics and is helping me write an op-ed to go into the prophet Wednesday morning. Still working on that.
“We get the Goblins to turn the charm into what looks like a tent. Or canvas that stretches over the top of the whole thing. Inform the Muggles that it’s going to be a construction site until further notice. Then we work under it. How many muggles are in these townhouses? The magical tenants will not be a problem we just need to perform the ritual. The Muggles will be more of a problem, but that’s where the fun comes in. I’ve done this sort of thing many times before. We create the diversion. Have them clean out the basements and close them out until we’re done. Give them free rent for a month or something in exchange for the noise and inconvenience.”
We have been in contact with Sean McAlroy and have asked for a statement. The response was a curt email stating: “Confirmed.” Accompanied by the usual profanity laced admonition.
“Yes. They have whole kits that come with instructions. You can pick one up. They have a catalogue you can take to Mrs. Brick too and she can pick out other things if she wants to try it out. They even have owl delivery services.”
“It’s a starburst, sometimes called a sputnik fixture. The sconces too. . . . Go take a look at the bath.”
“Yes. But this is life changing. You have to understand how this will change things and I need you all to be okay with it. It’s not going to be a pretty thing in the press.”
“I have a loose idea of what I want. Nothing set in stone yet. I’ll show you the original plans and photo’s of what it looked like back in the 40’s. That was pretty incredible, but I don’t want to follow that at all. It was too much. . . . boxwood topiaries and palm trees.”
“Oh yes, you definitely do. And then lunch. . . .what did you bring for beverages? I only brought juice and soda. I thought we were riding back home today.”
“I can set up a television for you to watch! We’ll return the main portrait to the manor once Teddy’s completed the new paintings for you?”
“He’s not joking Dud. That’s beginners spellwork, but she’s got it down . . . . and Draco’s counter spell
“Thank you so much Hugo. I really owe you one. . .OH and show him how to get up on the roof? As long as it doesn’t mean apparating. I couldn’t figure that one out.”
Louis, you stay right where you are at the junk shop. You’re going to be needed there to answer questions and collect the donations.
I’m open to suggestions, but to start I’d like to show the boys the garments. They don’t need this stress. We’ve had our fun, but I have second thoughts. I clearly didn’t know the family or these kids when we originally planned things. If I were to start over it would be very different. Some of the elements are acceptable. This whole event, as planned is just not them. At all.
“All fresh from the greenhouse. Dill, garlic, lemon. . . . . . there might just be something else added to the mix if you’d like.”
“I also wanted to keep it a lot lighter. Except for my wanted poster it’s all pretty tame. . . .All of the descriptions and identification plaques were done by Danika. . . . .”
I know it’s not worth my time, but it is officially requested that you refrain from diverting from your official patronus curriculum. First years do not need the extra jinx instruction. Second years do not need the extracurricular water balloon hex etc., etc., etc., blah, blah.
“She hates those fucking pureed carrots. Throw them out and don’t tell Al. . . . . She does like actual carrots just not this shite that Zebb makes . . . . . What’s in your refrigerator?”
“Papier-mâché mountain. It has a tunnel to run the train through it. It’s just the basic form still. Dad wants to decorate it up with trees or moss or whatever. . . . . .let me know if you find the tressle.”
Hurling is a sport. Goblin youth league. Meet here at the penthouse Thursday at noon and we’ll go to Grimmauld together?
We could do something boring like take a walk? Grab something to eat? St James park is pretty right now.
I think you might be surprised. You’ve been putting yourself out there lately. Public opinion has changed a lot.
Funny as hell. Smart as hell. Probably organized to a fault. He’s the reason your grandmother brought JUDO to Hogwarts!
HEY! But in all honesty, Thanks Louis for saving the day I need a break. I’ve got the newest Declan McKenna and Dua remixes. I’ll bring that and Muggle Soda.
“So this book is Draco’s art collection. He has several of Teddy’s paintings. . . . let’s see. . . . This one is quite large and is meant to go with the sculpture.”
“No. But it was scary. I heard the bones snap. I went to the store in the Twiz and never found the billycan powder you wanted. Did you know that if I took an orange to the summer festival at Diagon they’d arrest me for trafficking illegal substances? I don’t want that. I think we should take grapes instead.”
Holding hands waking through the park and smelling flowers? The photographer took particular interest in photographing you from behind.
“What do you think of this shirt? Draco say’s its a psychedelia print? What even is that? And I still think I might need a jumper because it’s getting chilly.”
“Teddy, let me show you the portrait gallery. You should find that interesting . Did I tell you that all of the portraits in the house are going to the manor with Mother?”
“Alphabetical I think. Take a look in here. . . .We tried to organize it, but you’ll put things where you want them.”
Can I have one of your guest rooms tonight? I don’t want to go back to Berlin and just come back in the morning again. I’ve done that twice in the last 4 days.
“Most certainly. It’s definitely a gentleman’s lab from the hint of pink accents on some of the tiles. It really is a handsome laboratory.”
Really there’s not much to be done. My staff will definitely be on board. Just make a few changes. We won’t force people to come the night before. Just have the party at Molly and Arthur’s. I can have the garments delivered. I still think they’ll love them. People can gather here in the morning. It should be earlier though if we want to keep the original schedule. I’ll just serve some light breakfast items and beverages in the library. The rest of the robes and garments can be considered a welcome gift. I'll also keep the rooms ready and available to change in. We just won’t expect overnight guests. We had planned for the actual wedding to be at noon, with the reception to follow. We should keep that part of the planned schedule.
“All of your kitchen equipment that was left in storage at the centre and penthouse is here now. Breathe, Potter don’t rattle the dishes. I did get you a few new things, like these kitchen linens with this blue stripe?”
“It’s a lovely peridot. Please consider it a birthday gift. You’ll want to place the Talisman in a protected place. Does she have a personal vault?”
Yes it is. So it’s an honour for us to be invited I know. And you better start answering questions, Scarhead!
“It’s normally around 10 to 15 percent. I meet with Mr. Faunt at your accountants offices once per year. Taxes are just part of everyday life.”
It’s not that big of a deal, Harry. You call the meetings or hearings and set the agenda. You’ve got Hugo and Grayson to help you with that.
“As for ageing in general? Your Grandfather never looked a day over thirty, so there’s that. Before your Grandmother removed all of the Malfoy portraits from the Manor you would swear it was a gallery of youthful people for the most part. I always thought it was probably a tradition to have a portrait done of a person depicting them in a certain light, but some of it is hereditary. Perhaps that’s a comfort.”
“My books. . . .Can you un-shrink them? They’re in my backpack. I suck at that spell. I haven’t seen them in months.”
“He loves anything with a dog in it. Especially that grooming competition. Want another computer project?”
Start by sharing with us the parts you’re not willing to change. And we’ll go from there. Tell us what you would be really disappointed with if we changed it.
“We’re coming in about an hour or so. Aspen has a surprise. A big squid plushie she want’s to share.”
“Anytime. . . . Cib is helping with them too. Grayson brought his Mum and Pops up here earlier. They checked things out. They have a special food. At least I don’t have to feed them rats or rabbits . . . . . they will eat them if they go out hunting. They’re trained not to bring dead things back into the roost.”
There are other things I’d like to introduce or make changes with, but I think the progress made so far is pretty incredible.
